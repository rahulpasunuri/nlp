Sorry Mario - VERY boring recipe. First time I did it, it was blah, so we went again, adding a few things such as bacon and lemon zest, much better, but really there are easier and better tasting recipes out there

Too greasy. Won't make it again unless I can figure out how to modify the recipe to lessen the oiliness.

Good, but not too different from roasted potato wedges - the potato slices didn't stick together at all because the pecorino wasn't creamy enough to bind everything. This might have worked out better (using the rest of the recipe as written) if I'd used a mandoline to make perfectly even, super-thin slices of potato that I could have overlapped neatly in the dish. I'm making it again immediately with some lemon zest, parsley, chicken stock, and milk added to the potatoes. I'll reserve the crumb/parsley/pecorino mixture and some of the zest for topping and browning at the end. Overall, this came out okay - just not as the gratin/casserole/kugel I'd wanted.
