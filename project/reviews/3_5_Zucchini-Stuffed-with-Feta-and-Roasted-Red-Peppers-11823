I'm always looking for ways to cook zucchini as it's one of the veggies the BF and I both like. We FOUGHT over the leftovers!

This was easy and pretty tasty. I added at least half the zucchini and a quarter of an onion that I sautéed before mixing in the pepper and feta and enjoyed it quite a bit. I also added the pepper flakes- great suggestion.

Very easy and very well received. Into the stuffing I added some chopped Kalmata olives. Prior to broiling, I drizzled a scant 1/4 tsp of high-quality extra virgin olive oil on top of each appetizer. These were very well received by my family.

This was easy to make. I added another 1/2t of oregano, and since I couldn't get any bottled roasted red pepper, I made my own. My five year old daughter asked for seconds! Yummy!

Was very nice as part of a buffet. Make sure to have more filling ingredients on hand though, the quantities indicated in the recipe are on the low side. Very easy to prepare, even without a melon baller. Would be nice with goat cheese too, other herbs, etc, it's a versatile recipe.

Next time I'll add hot red pepper to spice it up (as suggested by another reviewer). Didn't have a melon baller, but successfully used a strong metal measuring spoon instead.

Don´t know about other users but I think they must follow the same logic as I do. After a while of cooking ones favorite dishes even then we look for something a bit different, a bit unusual: browsing through the thousands of recipes I came across, and tried this one, we call them courgettes, which we like, but they all need something "doing" to them. This recipe fits all the boxes, Its different, its very easy, it is very tasty, and its presentation is superb. If anyone out there doesn't use courgettes bacause they consider them bland, try this -you will be amused

I made the half-zucchini boats. I precooked them on the grill before filling them and browning under the broiler. Might have been a tad bland, may add crushed red pepper flakes next time and/or chopped parsley.

This recipe was incomplete. Save the insides of the zuccini? For...? Also, the filling ingredients need to be doubled! I used various hot peppers, rather than roasted red peppers. I liked it, but it was too hot for my "bubbles."

A nice side dish for BBQ steak. My man really liked this recipe. He wants to make it again. I think I would add a little pesto next time. Quick and easy (once you get the hang of scooping out the zucchini).

This was super easy. Rather than steaming the shells, I filled them, then put them on the top rack of my grill while I grilled the main course. Excess liquid evaporated this way, and concentrated the flavors. Pretty with the red pepper, but could easily change the flavors using a variety of ingredients.

Excellent! I took the suggestion of the below posting and ate it as a side dish with sauteed chicken sausage, sauteed very soft red onions and fresh tyme at the end. I didn't have red pepper like I had thought, so I just used a little of the soft red onions instead of the red pepper in the feta mixture. The 2 dishes went well together and it was fantastic. The best part was that it was so easy!

This was fantastic-everybody loved it. I ended up cutting the zucchini once lenghtwise and filling each side with the stuffing and serving it as a sidedish to baked salmon.
