I served this dish as an appetizer at a New Year's Eve Party. It was one of a few appetizers that was complete eaten. A friend that said she didn't like herring or curry even loved it.

This has become a Christmas classic at our house, and herring fans eat it Christmas Eve and with breakfast the next day. I typically triple the curry and double the herring, but it is good as written, too.

This is a traditional favorite with both our Danish and American families. We've found it to be a great introduction to pickled herring for cautios eaters, especially if you serve it with snaps "to make the herring swim!" (Try Ålborg Jubileum snaps, or the new dill snaps variety if you can get it.)Do be aware that the rye bread mentioned here is not the typical rye bread found in America, but a dense, flat slice an eighth of an inch thick found in Scandinavia and Germany.
