This is a wonderful easy recipe. It is very similar to the most popular NZ 'gingernut' bisket. I use a smaller cookie cutter to remove the centre of the gingerbread man. I half bake them, fill this with a clear hard-boiled lolly, I finish the baking, which makes a 'stained glass' effect. They were a real hit with the family, especially with the kids :-)

This is the second Christmas making these cookies and they are wonderful. Not sure where others have had problems, they are moist and rolled out nicely, but did also cut back on the cooking time. Otherwise they are great, especially like the pieces of ginger! Everyone has loved them :)

Warning!!!!! In my 35 years of baking, this recipe is truly the WORST ginger cookie recipe I have ever tried to use. I was hoping to have a "positive" fun experience with my grandchildren helping me make these cookies. After wasting all the ingredients, fighting with the dough to get it to stick together, it was IMPOSSIBLE to roll out. We had to pat and press it to get it to stick together at all!!!!! The cookies were at least a quarter inch thick and VERY tasteless!!! PLEASE do not use this recipe. Should have stuck to my grandmother's original recipe instead!!!! Grrrrrrr! Be fore-warned!

These were not crunchy and not flavorful enough for me. I followed the recipe to a 'T'. I won't be making these again.

From the mouths of babes...While I was making these, my 3 year old said "mama, its not supposed to be this hard". These were a lot of work and while pretty, not delicious and a little dry, I thought. I will try another recipe next time I make gingerbread cookies.

I had the same difficulties as some of the other reviewers. I found these under-spiced, hard to roll out, and that cooking for the specified time was too much. I gave up halfway through the dough and left the other half in the refrigerator. A few days later, I was about to throw it out when I decided instead to try making the remaining dough into bars. I buttered a 9x12 glass baking dish, pressed down the remaining dough, and baked them 15-17 minutes. Much better -- quite edible with vanilla ice cream -- but still underspiced.

I don't believe the 6 cups of flour is a mistake -- the ingredients/proportions worked out perfectly for me. Don't know what might have been the problem for others. One thing I found: When rolling these out, it's easier to just work with a handful of dough at a time (instead of trying to roll out a whole sheet)-- just cut out a couple of shapes and then work the excess back into the next batch of dough. I'd certainly make this again.

I doubled the ginger, and I liked it! Also, they were a little too dry, so I added some water. Everything worked out ok except that it took less time to cook than the recipe called for. Try 9 minutes.

was it a typo to have 6 SIX!!! cups of flour? The batter wouldn't hold together at all, and I had to try to salvage the ingredients into a spice cake.

I cut this recipe in half bec. I didn't want to make a gazillion cookies,and it worked! I also rolled the dough out between parchment paper. Much easier. I'll use a little less ginger and a dash of cloves next time.

Had the same problem as A Cook. Too dry and crumbly to roll out. I had chilled the dough and couldn't salvage it-- sounds delicious so might try again sometime.

'tis true, they are not too sweet, which is a plus. It was also nice not to have the overpowering clove and allspice flavor so typical of gingerbread. After my kids frosted them (they're sweet now!), they gobbled them right down. Just right for the holidays.

Excellent xmas cookie - lots of flavor and not too sweet!

Not sure where I went wrong. I made 1/2 recipe, and as far as I can tell kept the proportions exactly the same.....yet the dough for these was dry and crumbly. I didn't bother chilling and rolling, just pressed them into balls and baked as is. The taste was good...I would add more zest and some fresh ginger next time. A nice cookie.

I haven't made these yet but they look great! i wonder where I can find a good sized angel cookie cutter...that one will be hard.

Really nice spin on gingerbread. I agree with the author and much prefer the ginger/orange approach to the more heavily spiced varieties. I didn't make the angel shapes--I used my turkey and pumpkin cookie cutters and served them with cranberry ice cream and sorbet for Thanksgiving dessert. Everyone loved these cookies, from my four year-old niece to my husband's colleagues. The recipe makes a lot of cookies, but they were very easy to get rid of, I assure you.
