I don't understand the point of this recipe. Cooking radishes like this doesn't transform them into anything. Radishes are there for the crunch, so sauteing them in butter for a bit 'until al dente' just means they will be less crunchy than when raw. If you want to experience good al dente root vegetables, grate some sweet potato and stir fry with some ginger and garlic, just until it tastes sweet rather than floury. It's delicious, because the taste improves - unlike with this recipe.

Even though I used fresh-from-the-garden radishes and chives, we thought this dish was blah. It did add some color to the plate.
