I made these easy cookies and found them delicious. They did take about 5 minutes more to bake after slicing before they were golden brown. Even then, they were slightly tender, rather than very hard. In fact, I preferred this texture to the very hard and dry texture of many biscotti, but it's worth knowing that this is a more tender cookie, even though quite dry. I served them with fresh tangerines and the orange cardamom cream that's on this site as a suggested accompaniment to a very fussy sounding fig tart (1 cup heavy cream, zest of one small orange, 2 T. honey, 1/4 t. cadamom; beat until peaks form). Having the cream was perfect for something moist to accompany these biscotti, as their relative tenderness suggests that they would hold up to a lot of dunking in coffee. I will certainly make them again.

These were very good. I wanted to use up some nuts, apricots and dates, but had no butter. I also had some craisens so I threw them in too. I skipped the sesame (as mine had gone rancid), but had some chopped cashews and sprinkled that on instead. Very different from my other holiday cookies -- many butter based or containing chocolate. Smelled nice too.

I love these. I make them frequently. They keep well. The two changes I make are to omit the sesame seeds as I don't care for them. I don't use the extra egg just brush the cookies with milk or cream and sprinkle them with some sugar in the raw. I've always been surprised that no one has reviewed them. We call them breakfast biscotti. They're also great with a cup of tea or coffee as an afternoon treat.
