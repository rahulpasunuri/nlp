Magnificant use of leftover mashed potatoes! I used white wine instead of vinegar. Italian parlsey. Served with petite turkey sandwiches. I am sending to friends now! Nan

Very good soup. Simple ingredients, easy and quick to make, everyone loved it. As someone said below, it can also be made easily with raw potatoes, you don't have to wait until you have leftover mashed potatoes.

Very delicious and fast to make. I added a clove of garlic and leftover turkey. It was a winner at the dinner table.

This recipe is soooo delicious. The only modifications I made were to double it, use fresh rosemary (and a few sprigs of thyme), and cut the carrots in chunks rather than grate them. I can't wait to make it again.

I love this recipie! Best way to use leftover mashed potatoes. I kick it up with a little more pepper but it's thick, hearty, and freezes well!

Although I didn't find this recipe very gastronomical, husband and daughter both liked it. And I will make it again because after all, I wanted a recipe to use leftover mashed potatoes, and this fits the bill.

This is a great use up for my mashed potatoes. I used fresh rosemary instead of dried but followed the rest. Delicious!

I make extra mashed potatoes so I can make this soup the next day!

I made a few changes based on what I had on hand: Olive oil instead of butter; celery seed instead of celery and carrots; fresh rosemary sprigs removed after a few minutes to infuse the soup with rosemary scent; and no parsley. The kids LOVED this stuff - one 5-year-old friend tried it and asked for 2nds and 3rds. When I told her there were onions in it, she said "but I don't like onions." Yet she continued to gobble it up. All in all, a delicious dish and a great excuse to make mounds of mashed potatoes the night before.

A simple to make yet delicious soup if you have extra mashed potatoes to get rid of. Did not find it so heavy at all although my husband said it was filling. Didn't have celery so added some left over corn and peas.

This tastes exactly like Grandma's potato soup, only with more work! I was mostly done before I realized the similarity. Don't let me stop you from making this if you have leftover mashed potatoes to use up, but you can get the same result by adding cubed potatoes with the broth and simmering it until they're very, very soft, then brutalizing them with a fork. Like another reviewer mentioned, Grandma often adds milk near the end if it's getting thick enough that no stretch of the imagination can call it 'soup'. But it's always very thick and a spoon can stand up in it when it's cold.

This soup is wonderful, I added extra onions along with some green onions. The rosemary and fresh parsley made this soup distinct. My husband and his mother could not stop raving about this soup, it has become a staple in a our diet.

I love this website because of the recipe search. I wanted to make a quick dinner without having to go out and buy anything, and this recipe fit the bill. Plus, I have two picky-eaters (kids). Everyone, except me, loved this soup. I thought it was too thick, but I guess it IS called "mashed potato soup" so what did I expect?! : ) I will definitely make this again for the kids . . .

This was simple and excellent. Would make it again and I've passed this on to other people. Great for a Sunday night dinner.

This is heaven in a bowl. I made it twice last week and everyone liked it.

This is a great recipe. I have made it twice and grated the carrot once, and small cubed it the second time. I definitely think grating is better. I also added about a cup of milk near the end. Absolutely incredible!

This soup was amazing. Super easy and super tasty. However, don't even think of using instant mashed potatoes. It's worth the extra 20 minutes to make fresh.

This was delicious and so easy. It was a great way to use the leftover potatoes from the Garlic Roasted Potato Skins on this site which are also excellent.

This was really good...I would have given 3.5 forks if that had been an option. It was such a good way to use up my mashed potato leftovers- I always make way too many. I used mashed potatoes with sundried tomatoes. The tomatoes really filled out in the soup and added a nice texture, would be a good addition in any case.

Excelant flavor and nice texture. A double batch is not out of line, for soup lovers, as is my family. A slight modification by adding few dashes of Tabasco sauce, not much.
