Since I love roasted peppers I thought I'd try this recipe. The chicken was flavorless as was the sauce. It would take too much work to fix this recipe so it would have any taste. There are hundreds of chicken breast recipes that are far superior. Don't waste your time with this one.

This recipe is a keeper and was a hit. True it wasn't too spicy (I was afraid it might be with "spicy" in the title).

I know I'm in the minority here, but I thought this recipe was totally bland. The puree was FAR from spicy. The amount of spice was too miniscule to even taste. I wouldn't waste my time on this recipe again.

Very colorful, light, tasty, recipe! Don't forget to add a little salt to the puree to bring out the flavor of the roasted peppers.

Delicious and easy to make. I used Indian chili powder which made the dish a bit too hot to taste the yellow pepper. I would cut back on the Indian chili or use a Mexican blend next time.

I used thin chicken breasts broiled in the oven with olive oil instead of spray oil, and also added a teaspoon of honey to mustard mixture, so it wouldn't taste too bitter.I didn't pour peppers through sieve, and it was fine. This was great! My boyfriend loved it. I served with brocolli and the baked cherry tomatoes with parmesan cheese topping found here. The dish was colorful and tasty, definately a keeper.

This was so good, you wouldn't know it was low fat. The flavors were clear and bright, the perfect thing for a snowy Buffalo evening. I peeled the yellow peppers after roasting and broiled the chichen in the oven.

This dish was very colorful and flavorful enough not to taste low fat. My husband loved it.

I though this was just OK. I found the puree to be a little too bitter, even after roasting the peppers. If I were to make it again I'd either use red bells peppers or balance the yellow with a little of something sweet.

This was so easy and so fantastic. I doubled the chili powder in the puree, and added a teaspoon of dried ground coriander. (I didn't have any fresh). I had pounded my chicken breasts to make them more tender and the whole thing was a great success. I served them with a gourmet blend of several brown rices including wild rice, and threw in a bit of coriander to the cooking water. This is definitly a keeper!

A flavorful and easy low fat dish. I used jarred yellow roasted peppers to save time and it was still wonderful. The ingredients blend together quite nicely resulting in a very fresh, mildly spicy dish.

I am really surprised that no one has reviewed this recipe - it was fabulous tasting, easy to prepare, quick and, not to mention, healthy. I wouldn't change a thing. Don't forget the Coriander Rice which is a great compliment and good rice dish to serve with other entrees.
