Love this Tapenade. I added garlic--delicious!

Add a clove of garlic and fresh thyme and this is good. And you don't need that much oil.

Tapenade is a favorite of mine, but i like to throw in a touch of roasted garlic, capers, and raosted red peppers. If you have access to a decent olive bar, I recomend compare and contrast the flavoursof the olives you choose, and not to puree too much, if you like that rustic kinda thing. P.S. Great with Manchego!

While I made this just to try it (and it's not bad), I will probably go back to my much more flavourful classic tapenade made with capers, anchovies and garlic. The reader from San Francisco is right about the name, although I hate to quibble about things like names. But "tapenade" comes from the Provencal word "tapeno" meaning capers.

This recipe is for an OLIVADE, from olive, and NOT for a TAPENADE, using mostly capers, SOME black olives, desalted anchovy fillets, the whole being blended with olive oil and lemon juice. (Laruousse Gastronomique, p.468) I suggest you find a new name for this recipe, like olives paste or something like it.
