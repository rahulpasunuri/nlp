I have been making this recipe for friends and familys since it appeared in Bon Apppetit in 1999. It's always been a huge hit!

Save $: make your own royal icing: mix 1/3 Cup water, 2 Tb meringe powder (you can buy this at Michael's Arts & crafts), & 1/4 tsp crm of tartar until dissolved. Beat to a very thick meringue. Add 1 pound powdered sugar, beat slowly until moistened, then beat 3 min on high speed. DON'T put in frig & keep in air tight container. OR if you don't have meringue powder: beat 3 egg whites, 1 pound powdered sugar, 1/2 tsp crm of tartar at high speed 7-10 min. Use immediately.

This is an easy to do great bang for your buck (in this case time and effort) recipes. Kids love it, it is wonderful to tuck into Easter baskets for others and they taste great. Leave yourself time and space to complete this recipe, after you do it once it is much easier the next time and can be a great family tradition.

I had rave reviews for these eggs! I gave them to my chocoholic friends, as Easter gifts. They are not very difficult as long as you follow the step-by-step process, Extremely rich!!

I made this recipe right after it came out in the magazine at Eastertime last year. WELL worth the time - and I disagree with the other reviewer. It hardly takes three days to make these. I used Van Leer bittersweet chocolate. I made the larger size and gave them to Easter dinner guests as gifts. It's a GREAT recipe. The step-by-step directions are clear and easy to follow. Be patient, though.

You're joking, right? Three days worth of work and $45 worth of ingredients to make 7 eggs? You know, no matter how good they are, some things are better left to the experts. Me, I'll stick with See's.
