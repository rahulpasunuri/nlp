This is my favorite lamb recipe of all time. The lamb is nicely accented by the rosemary and we loved the artichokes.

I used a few lamb leg center cut slices, halved, and arm shoulder chops. Either are great and very tender. I added 1/3 c. dry white wine to the artichokes while simmering and 1/4 c. half and half at the end to thicken. Also, added all of the orange zest to the artichoke mixture at the end. Great taste and easy weeknight dinner. Served with roasted white potatoes, with olive oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper.

Money. Make as directed and invite your boss or a girl way out of your league... This recipe is so good you might even have a chance.

I used concentrated broth, canned artichoke hearts, a lot more garlic, rosemary, and orange zest than called for, and (because, as another reviewer mentioned, loin lamb chops are expensive and deserve better treatment), shoulder chops. Very fine eating! For looks, I serve this with Forbidden (black) Rice and a colorful veg.

We actually cut back on the rosemary & garlic for a more subtle sauce, which we reduced to less than a quarter cup. Very nice!

This is a great recipe in all aspects but the orange zest. (Both my boyfriend and I agreed on this point). It really tasted wrong with all the other flavors. I'd leave it out entirely or use lemon like another chef suggeted.

I'd give this a 3.5 if possible. Very easy and the artichoke sauce adds a nice citrus twist to the whole dish.

Delicious! My 11-year old made it with a little help. Really good and easy.

This recipe was easy and came out Fabulous. I did switch from lamb bone chops to lamb serloin chops. They took about eight minutes per side and were perfect. Just don't over cook it or it gets chewy and tough.

Fantastic...Very easy too. I didn't want to use frozen artichokes and was was also looking to make this dish quickly. I used jarred artichoke hearts in oil and it worked fine (drain the oil first though). Excellent!

Quick and easy -- great for entertaining. Piled the lamb chops on a large white platter, poured sauce over the meat, placed the artichokes around the meat and garnished with sprigs of rosemary. Nice presentation.

One word - DELICIOUS. Do try it. I did make one change - I used lemon zest instead of orange peel. I'ts a personal preference, but trust me lemon and rosemary are made for one and other.

Please don't crack up- I used chicken instead of lamb, didn't have orange and used dry white wine instead of broth. It was delicious! Rosemary and garlic and artichokes really go well together.

This dish was delicious and all my guests have made it for theirs. The artichokes also make a delicious side dish on their own.

I know that the spirit of this recipe is quick preparation, but my suggestion is to add to the prep time to pay bigger dividends. When it comes to lamb, garlic, rosemary, salt and pepper (especially if you have frssh rosemary) is a marriage made in heaven. The orange zest is a really nice touch. But the artichokes- you will get infinatelt better results with fresh artichokes, and a good hunk of lamb is worth the effort. Finally, grilling the lamb brings out the flavor much better. I love the minimalist aspect of the recipe, but the simplicty, while convenient, doesn't do justice for such an expensive piece of meat as lamb chops.

This is a nice way to serve lamb. A few things about the recipe: It's not clear if the 8-oz. measure for artichokes is WEIGHT or VOLUME. 2 8-oz. blocks of artichokes (whether that's two cups, or one pound)is a lot of artichoke. I bought 'em in bulk from the local specialty shop and used a bit more than half a pound ... which seemed quite ample. I used about half again as much stock as the recipe directs. There were so many artichokes, it seemed like more stock was necessary to make it into a sauce at all. Otherwise, really a very lovely dish.
