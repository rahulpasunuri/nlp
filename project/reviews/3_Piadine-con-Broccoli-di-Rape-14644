This is okay, but much better if made according to the classic recipe, which uses lard instead of olive oil. Beware the food police, though.

I used this recipe for the piadine base. I brushed the rolled out base with olive oil and sprinkled basil and red pepper flakes, then baked it at 450 F. While the base was OK, it could not compete with the piadines that I'm used to eating at Tomatina. Next time, I will put 1 tsp baking soda in the dough to make it rise and let it rest overnight. For the topping, I used arugula, tomato and mozzarella with balsamic vinaigrette dressing and that was delicious!

These were great, reminded me of the piadine bought at pizza shops in the south of Italy. Wrapped in a napkin and eaten out of hand. I added Italian sweet sausage along with the rape mixture, delicious!!
