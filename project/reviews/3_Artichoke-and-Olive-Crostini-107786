We really liked this recipe. I did make some minor changes: I processed the artichoke hearts, green olives, shallot (I didn't have any red onion) and about 2 tablespoons dry sun-dried tomatoes with some plain nonfat yogurt (didn't have any cream and wanted it to be lower in fat anyway). I also added a dash of cayenne.

My guests loved it and so did I. For my version, I used the large green olives, stuffed with almonds from my market's olive bar. That gave the spread some additional flavor and texture. Then lightly sprinkled some parmesan cheese on top. Next time I'll add some Tabasco sauce for a kick.

I thought this was just so-so, but everyone else liked it. It definitely needed something else...maybe some lemon juice? I will probably try it again and make some adjustments.

I used kalamata olives instead of green, didn't need to add any extra salt. But there still seemed to be something missing, as other reviewers have said.

I love trying something new! My father stated that this was his favorite! That is a big deal! I did use a mixture of green,black,and kalamata olives. Wonderful!

The salt from the olives is enough for the whole crostini. No need to add salt to artichoke mixture. Also, I added one tablespoon of finely chopped roasted red pepper and one tablespoon of balsamic vinegar to lift the olive mixture beyond salt and onion. Overall, simple, quick, and delicious.

Wonderful! I also added black chopped olives and garlic. Instead of using the store purchaced bread , I used the Pilsbury French Bread and placed into fluted bread tubes. Made a beautiful presentation.

I made this along with the tuna & red pepper (a 4-forker) and the fig and goat cheese crostini also on this site...a great trio...for my best freind's pre-wedding rehearsal dinner cocktail party. Easy, good for hot weather and a crowd, and sure to impress.

This was an easy recipe to prepare and tasted restaurant worthy. I must admit that I substituted sour cream for the heavy cream... I didn't have any in the house, and it still tasted very good.

A very simple hors d'oeuvres to prepare with great flavor and pretty on a platter. I added a generous amount of roasted garlic to the olive mixture as well as some fresh chopped parsley. I used a combo of olives. I used white pepper in the artichoke spread. Be sure to pat dry artichokes well.

Made as written and served with champagne for a New Years Eve hors d'oeuvre. My guests were very pleased. I was a bit skeptical at first because the mix of ingredients seemed like it might be a bit 'briny' but the combination worked after all due to the cream in the artichokes. I would definitely make these again but I will not wait for New Years. (Next time I might serve a red wine instead.)

I definitely agree that the combination of ingredients was a bit strange, but it really worked. Got compliments from guests.

This recipe was excellent with the following changes: Add 1 clove garlic and a dash of cayenne to the artichoke mixture in food processor. Used brine-cured green olives stuffed with anchovies instead of the pitted green olives. Omitted the additional salt. Dinner party guests loved 'em!

Try the Artichoke Bruschetta (Bon Appetit, Jan '99) instead. It's really good. I used parmesan as that's what I had on hand. So next time I will try the olive/onion mix on top of that recipe for better flavor. This one is rather bland.

This was a very tasy appetizers and very simple. I plan on using this again for dinner guests.

Good eats and very easy to make. Easily could be made into three forks. While tasty, I too would like a little more flavor than the original recipe. Next time I'll add some fresh herbs (basil or oregano perhaps?) and maybe pine nuts to the olive topping.

This recipe is quick and easy. The only way to make it faster would be to use a crunch cracker instead of the toasts. I mistakenly thought the olives would be salty enough, so went easy on the salt - not so. Next time I am going to try jazzing this up a little with either some red pepper flakes or tabasco.
