Great use of egg whites left after making custard style homemade ice cream. I use whatever veges I have on hand. Rosemary seemed overpowering the first time, and given I was using zucchini and tomato, I switched to 1 tsp Italian Seasoning and it was delicious.

Good and healthy but not outstanding and sort of a pain to make.

I thought this was really good - made it as the healthy option for a brunch. I made it without the turkey bacon and it still had really good flavor. The only thing I'd say is that I made the veggies ahead of time and the potatoes got a little gray - not sure if there's a correlation, but they tasted much better than they looked.

Made this for my son and daughter-in-law before they set off on a long drive. Very satisfying. I also used whole eggs and regular bacon--not as healthy but it worked fine.

This was really good and hearty for a healthy recipe. A little bland so i might use a bit more salt (i was using kosher salt) or even ad some tomato. cant wait to reheat each morning for a quick hearty breakfast all week!

This is such a good, healthy breakfast. I made it for a group before going out ice fishing and it really hit the spot. Everyone liked it quite a bit.

I used regular bacon, 6 or 7 whole eggs (minimum amt of eggs needed to bind, go with fewer and work up)(what am I going to do with a bunch of yolks, really, just give it up and put it in there!!), and mild cheddar in place of the feta. it was great!! i think this is a great foundation recipe to do with what you have in the fridge and it'll work out just fine, provided you keep the main jist of the recipe for safety. enjoy!

We made this with 10 whole eggs rather than the eggs/whites combo and it turned out fine. I do however feel that there are egg dishes out there which can incorporate just as many vegetables and take a fraction of the time to prepare. Still, this was a nice change of pace.

i love this simple, yet hearty meal for any time of the day and year! i substitute for turkey bacon and use regular feta, of course, adding a bit extra of both. this is a failsafe recipe that can easily be altered to your tastes.

My family really loved this dish. I modified the recipe slightly, forgoing the sliced potato and substituting summer sausage for the turkey bacon. Like the earlier review, I found that the broiling took longer than the recipe stated...I left it in until I could move the pan and the frittata remained still. I will definitely make this dish again.

I had to bake the frittata for about 10 minutes at 500 F instead of broiling due to the restrictions of my skillet, but it still came out delicious. It re-heats surprisingly well. A non-stick skillet makes this recipe immensely easier.
