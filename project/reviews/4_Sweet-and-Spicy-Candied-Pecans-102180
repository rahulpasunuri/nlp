I reviewed this recipe last year and I needed to make it again for a party so I checked out the more recent reviews. The reviewer who recommended cooking on parchment paper was spot on. It worked perfectly. For my taste, I would not include the little candy-like pieces that come off the paper in a bowl with the nuts. The flavor of the coating is very intense, too intense by itself. This is easy and good!

I did as another reviewer and roasted the pecans before. And I did 1/2 light caro and 1/2 dark. Special ingredient: garam masala Adds a nice depth to the spice.

Hey Gang, I used parchment paper to line the pan that I put the pecans on for the oven. I stirred them after 5 minutes and then left them for another 10 minutes. I pulled them out of the oven, pulled the parchment paper off the cookie sheet and onto my countertop. I separated the pecans and just broke the rest up after they cooled. I didn't waste any of the sweet crunchy bits because it peeled off the parchment with the pecans.

Wonderful recepie! The only modification I make is to toast the nuts first. To do this, place the nuts on a cookie sheet in a 350 degree oven for about 10 min (stir occasionally). Adding this step brings out the flavor from the nuts & makes the nuts more crispy!

I followed the advice of reviewer carolo813 on 06/21/09. Perfect and easy. Just the right kick! I will be making them from now on. Thanks.

I agree with an earlier reviewer, too salty (and I decreased salt amount), not sweet enough and generally just lacking much in flavor. I did the part corn syrup/maple syrup and added cinnamon, and ginger. I'll keep looking for a better recipe.

I finally hit it. swapped the corn syrup for agave. swapped dark brown sugar for white sugar. doubled cayenne. added dashes of worcestershire sauce and tabasco. doubled pecans. it's got a kick with a subtle sweetness - not cloying like other, egg white-based recipes.

I used this recipe with a Waldorf Salad and substituted Blue Agave syrup for the corn syrup. It was a hit with everyone and they couldn't believe it had cayenne pepper in it! Just the right amount of contrast to the sweetness.

These are a must add to the Waldorf salad recipe, however I get as many people who just want to snack on them plain. So makes for a great snack treat for cocktail parties.

I've made this recipe twice; once exactly as described and once with the suggested 2 parts corn syrup and one part maple syrup. Great either way. I found it easier to separate the nuts after cooking on a large plastic cutting board instead of foil. This is very easy to make.

These are still cooling on the foil, so perhaps it is too early to write this review. But my early taste test is just OK. I used 2 tbp corn syrup and 1 tbp maple syrup as some reviewers suggested, but I find that this is just not that sweet and not "candied" enough for my taste. I would increase both the syrup and the sugar in the future and double the cayenne.

Rating: 4
My husband loved the original recipe, but I found it a bit salty. I think of a candied pecan as sweet, so I decreased the salt to 1/2 tsp and increased the sugar to 2 tbsp. I also played with different spices; a small amount of powdered ginger is great! Many possibilities with this recipe!

I made these for nibbles for a party last night and they were beyond fantastic! Everyone went nuts for them...pardon the pun...I used two parts corn syrup and one part maple syrup as someone had suggested and it was delicious. I am planning on making a huge batch to give out as little Christmas gifts for my co-workers and friends. I can't wait to try some different combinations of spices and nuts. I think this would work really well with almonds.

Rating: 0
My friends and I LOVED these! I used blue agave sweetener instead of corn syrup and they were delicious! The trick is to separate them so that they are not touching each other, then cool them completely (even over night). One batch is not enough!

I use this recipe for various salads year round and am always wishing there were more nuts by the time the salad is finished. I can use either walnuts and pecans. I like to avoid foods that contain HFCS in them so instead of light corn syrup I used Lyle's Golden Syrup which is an all natural British product that I love!

fabulous. We all love these.

Wow, I should've known with so many positive reviews that these would be wonderful! And they were!! I made a quadruple batch, and just minor modifications. I needed a total of 3/4 cup corn syrup, but only had 1/2 cup, so I added in 1/4 cup maple syrup (just Log Cabin, not even the real stuff) It was wonderful! I only used 1/4 tsp. cayenne for the large batch, and that was enough for us, as the kids enjoyed it too. Tiny bit of heat, not much at all.I did not add the black pepper. The pecans glaze took longer to get to the bubbling point, so I put on the convection mode, and increased the heat to 350, watching it very closely.These turned out perfectly! They had a beautiful shiny glaze, great coating, and were even better the next day!(I'm guessing the poster who complained that the coating wasn't shiny, probably just took them out before the sugar in the glaze had dissolved at a boiling point. That part took longer than the recipe suggests) I will never pay $4.00 for a little bag of these again. They are easy to make, although you just have to tend to them while they're cooking. I think if I were to make them for a cocktail nibble, I would increase the cayenne a bit and add the black pepper, but as far as going into salads, or just eating out of hand, I prefer them not too spicy. My 6 sons kept sneaking back into the kitchen to nibble on them.

Rating: 4
I was buying packaged glazed pecans for about $3 to 4 for 6 ozs. I bought a large bag of pecans at Costco (about $8). From this large bag I can make this recipe more than 12 times -- huge savings and they are much, much better. I double the recipe and store them in a sealed container on the shelf. They last a long time and are great on salads and in other dishes that call for roasted nuts! A great gourmet treat on a limited budget.

Have made this twice - first time with the corn syrup, second time half honey & maple syrup as I read the suggestion after making it. I hate to say it, but I think I like it better with the corn syrup or perhaps would try half corn syrup half maple. The honey seemed to make the nuts a bit too sticky and the heat of the cayenne didn't come through as much as I would have liked.

Rating: 3
Very good. Used honey and maple syrup instead of corn syrup as suggested, increased cayenne to 1/4tsp. I also increased the salt to 1tsp as another reader had suggested, found it a bit salty, would not increase again. Like Dean Fearing's recipe for Spicy Pecans a bit better, but this waz very good and easy.

Rating: 4
Yum! These were delicious. Perfect for cocktails and later leftovers tossed in a salad with gorgonzola and pear. Also great to give as a hostess gift. First time I made them I followed the recipe exactly and they were quite good. Second time I followed another cook's suggestion about using maple syrup instead of corn syrup. Also used brown sugar and doubled the amount of cayenne. Fantastic!

Rating: 4
Super easy and no issues with sticking. I think I'd try the other reviewer's suggestion to substitute maple syrup and honey for the corn syrup (who needs more corn syrup in their diet?). Pecans were a nice level spicy but definitely not very spicey for those who are faint of heart on the spice level.

I love this recipe! I make these for salads. One with romaine lettuce, sliced pears, sliced parmigiano-reggiano cheese and balsamic dressing (equal parts balsamic vinegar, flax/olive oil and agave nectar)and one with sliced apples and crumbled feta instead of the pears and parmigiano.

Normally I love the sweet and spicy combination, but to me these were awful. I tried re-doing them in a plain sugar mixture and they still tasted odd. I am currently re-baking them on a rack so the mixture will drip off. Hopefully the lack of candy mixture will make better.

Rating: 4
I have used this recipe countless times, always returning to it after trying somethinig else, because it is both the easiest and the best. I have incorporated numerous suggestions: I no longer use corn syrup but replace it with 2T honey and 1T maple syrup. I increase the cayenne to 1/4t, the salt to 1t and reduce the sugar to 2t. I use parchment paper or a Silpat. The nuts, no matter what I use, invariably turn out perfectly. This is one of my favorite recipes whether for an appetizer, a snack or for a salad.

I make these at Xmas every year - they are great to nibble on, and are fabulous in salads! I cook them on parchment paper to avoid sticking, and use a heaping 1/4 t. of cayenne, other than that I follow the recipe. They taste better the day after being made when all the flavors develop. I also make a triple batch every time I make them. Yum!!

These were absolutely fabulous and everyone who tried them loved them and wanted the recipe. I didn't have any corn syrup so I used pure maple syrup and that was perfect. I also skipped the ground black pepper and increased the cayenne to 1/4 tsp which made them just spicy enough. I would increase that more if making for someone who liked spicy foods.

these are super! this is my first time making candied nuts and they were so easy with minimal mess/dishes. i lined the baking sheets with parchment paper and it was perfect. i used 2 tbsp honey and 1 tbsp maple syrup instead of the corn syrup. it really boosted the flavor and the maple syrup smelled great! i added just a teeny bit of black pepper because i can't stand it but didn't want to cut out the spice. it was still great. i also added 1/4 tsp cinnamon. i made a batch of pecans and walnuts, and the pecans taste much better. i like how you don't have to cook these super long like other recipes because they still have a nice crunch. i plan on using these in a cucumber salad tonight and i expect that it'll be wonderful.

Very nice. I used honey instead of corn syrup, which after reading Michael Pollan's -The Omnivore's Dilemma-, I avoid at all costs. I took the advice of another reviewer and upped the cayenne to 1/4 teaspoon. That was fine by my taste, but might be too spicy for some guests.

I am making this recipe for Christmas for my friends; putting a cup or so of the mix in decorativeholiday bags. These pecans are great on salads, veggies, desserts in pies, cakes,cookies, bar cookies, and on mashed sweet potaoes on meats and in yogurt or ice cream. The only problem is there is a MISTAKE in the recipe which sates..."put melted spice mixture over the pecans" and then bake them again..!! Well there is no recipe for the "melted spice mixture" so I simply added the spices in the beginning. It is very confusing and I wish they'd correct it...but regadless this recipe is healthy (no butter) and easy as is so try not to be confused about the wording.

Rating: 4
These candied pecans are delicious--easy to make, and even easier to eat. The only thing I changed was that I substitued Chinese 5 Spice instead of black pepper, like some other reviewers did, although some reviewers upped the ammount to 1/2 tsp.--I forgot about that and just did a generous quarter tsp., and turned out fine, although next time I might add more. I definitely support the use of 5 spice instead of black pepper--I don't think I would have enjoyed the nuts as much if I had just used black pepper. If you don't have 5 spice, it's worth buying it for this (and its many other uses).

Rating: 4
I have been making this recipe since it was first published and take it to every football game and cocktail party. I also made small jars for a cookie exchange. I am always asked for the recipe. A few things I learned: Definitely increase the cayenne to heaping 1/4 teaspoon. Don't double the recipe (needs the room on the cookie sheet for stirring), but ALWAYS make a triple batch. They are a great snack, excellent in salads (particularly waldorf) and can be mixed in with Chex Mix too. The corn syrup makes a hard candy crunch and your nuts will not be sticky, as they are with honey. Can't beat the corn syrup. These are delicious stirred into white chocolate fudge recipes--something about the heat with the chocolate--awesome.

Rating: 4
yum! i made this with hazelnuts because i had a ton left over from something that i made a few days ago and it turned out great. i used the recipe exactly as written and it was delicious - i might add a little extra cayenne pepper next time for some extra spiciness. can't stop munching

These are fabulous. I use parchment and it couldn't be easier. As written, they're not very spicy; if you want them hotter you need to increase the cayenne. But any way you make them they're totally addictive.

OK, my only task for Thanksgiving is the Waldorf salad (from this site). I've tried the pecans twice - once as written, and once with honey as one reviewer suggested. They're scrumptious either way. The problem with the honey is that it stays sticky. The corn syrup makes for a more solid glaze, which is easier to work with. That's my take on it.

I can't honestly give it a fork rating since I didn't follow it exactly. Per other reviewers advice I used honey instead of corn syrup and added 1/2t Chinese 5 spice in place of the black pepper. Kept the sugar, cayenne, and salt per directions. Very tasty; difficult to keep from snacking on them when making batches for gift baskets. Taste is even better the next day.

This was fabulous! If I don't find a way to make myself stop eating these, I won't have any left for the Thanksgiving salad. I used honey in place of the corn syrup because I was out, which worked just fine. I also lined my pan with foil, sprayed it with cooking spray, and just cooked the pecans on that, allowing them to cool on the sheet and then breaking them apart. These are going to be my new favorite topper for...pretty much anything.

I too made some modifications because I didn't have corn syrup or pecans. I used 2 Tablespoons honey & 1 Tablespoon real maple syrup in place of the corn syrup, reduced sugar to 2 teaspoons and increased the cayenne to 1/4 teaspoon and used walnuts. I used a silpat liner on my baking sheet and it worked beautifully, and cooled the nuts on parchment paper. They were so Yummy!

These were absolutely delicious. I followed the other suggestions and used Chinese 5 Spice which was so good. I also put foil on my bake sheet which made made sense though you have to work quickly to remove them or the pecans get stuck to the foil as they begin to cool.

These nuts were such a hit the first time I made it that my wife insists that this be one of my tasks whenever we entertain. Last year my daughter's boy friend spent Thanksgiving with us and we almost had no nuts left for the salad. This year our new son-in-law was back for Thanksgiving, so we hid the nuts until the salad was assembled. Unfortunately my wife and I knew where the nuts were hidden, so not all of the nuts made it to dinner! I made extra for nibbling this weekend, but there were none left!

Well! What a surprise! Made this for Thanksgiving and, fortunately, believed other reviewers and made it the day before. Tasted it when I assembled it and thought, "Gosh, this is awful! I better be ready to go to the store tomorrow morning if this doesn't improve." Husband thought it was dismal at that stage,too-- but voila!, by Thanksgiving morning the flavors had melded and a star had emerged! Guests said it was the best they'd ever had. The nuts on top are terrific, well worth the effort, and are even good by themselves as a snack. A definite keeper, and we'll see those nuts in our gift bags for friends this holiday season.

Awesome. I made these to top a salad, but people just enjoyed snacking on them without the salad. I wouldn't suggest cooking them as long as the recipe calls for because my first batch got burnt. The second time around I cooked for the initial 5 minutes, mixed them around on the baking sheet, and then only cooked them 3 minutes instead of 10. Even after 3 the glaze was getting a little dark on the edges, but I think this was the perfect amount of time. But seriously, just make these as a snack and your guests will love them - adults and kids alike.

I made these (with just a bit less sugar) to serve with a salad. They are addictive! My husband even asked me to show him how to make them and now he makes small batches to take with him to work.

It was incredibly easy that way.

I made these in large batches for gifts at X-mas. I put them in canning jars with labels. Every person that I gave the pecans to CALLED to thank me and requested the recipe!

Pretty good. It was easy to make - not as sticky as I anticipated. To make it a 3-fork rating, I'd make it more flavorful - both sweeter and spicier. I'm not sure how to make it sweeter (maybe replacing some of the corn syrup with more sugar?), but making it spicier should be easy. Also, I wonder if I could just line the baking sheet with foil, spray the foil, bake the pecans on the foil, and lift the foil off the pan and let the pecans cool directly on that? That would be even easier and less messy.

This is a very good recipe I have made many times for its ease and consistently good flavor. Of course you can adjust the spice for your own tastes, but I have found it to be an overall crowd pleaser.
