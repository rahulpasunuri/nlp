These are great and it was so much fun to make a traditional s'more from scratch. It would be great if people who complain would not rate the recipe if they have not tried it. Also, if you haven't tried it, no need to complain. To bring the rating down on something fun and good is not the purpose of the website.

i have to strongly disagree with so many of the other reviewers. i try to make everything my family eats from scratch, and i completely enjoy the process! i was thrilled to make a batch of buttery graham crackers incomparible in quality, freshness, and flavor, to any i had ever had before, and isn't it amazingly fun to make your very own marshmallows! they are time consuming, yes, but worth it if you're up for the task. if not, then just go buy a bag of jet puffed, and some keeblers, and quit boo-hoo-ing. the negative reviews on this recipe are silly!

We made this recipe for our gourmet supper club (the theme was cook out) three years ago, and our members still talk about it today! We roasted the marshmallows over a fire pit on long skewers,a fun way to end our evening, lending to conversation and great interaction around the pit.We used Valrhona dark chocolate, making it scrumptious with our big glasses of Cab. Like all Thomas Keller recipes, it is detailed, not for everyone, but if followed you will get perfect results!

I love the Graham Crackers and the Marshmellows. They came out great. I would point out, however, that the marshmellows come out almost identical in flavor and texture to FRESH Kraft Jet Puff marshmellows. I was hoping for something with a more unique / better taste. They taste exactly like fresh store bought. So.... I will be trying variations in the recipe to come up with something different. I am thinking about a flavor, like Cherry, adding just enough to make it different. The Graham crackers were good too. Very tasty. I would imagine the flavor would vary if you change the type and texture of the wheat flour. It was all pretty easy to make, and I will be making it again... but only with variants on the recipe. If you make this recipe exactly like it is, you will end up with Kraft Jet Puff, and slightly better graham crackers. Not vary unique. I'll let you all know how the variants come out.

Something to think about for those of who you feel this recipe strays from the traditional: you're right BUT... This is epicurious. This is a site that's known for foods that are usually gorumet, new, or unusual. Why do you think there's so many variations on, say...an old favorite like spaghetti and meatballs? Because if you had your regular recipe, what's the point of looking up more? Why bother making the sauce when there's plenty of bottled sauces, or making meatballs when they come frozen? Extra work is an expected part of gorumet food. Often, this site includes variations on old ideas...this is one of them: a fancier, perhaps a little different variation of the old favorate.Whether or not its worth the work is up to you. Something else to remember--all of the recipes by epicurious can be made in a well-equipped kitchen. A campfire is not usually part of a well-equipped kitchen. In some places, such as where i live, bonfires are illegal. This site attempts to copy the same (or similar) result without the campfire. There a recipe, I believe, which uses purchased graham crackers, marshmallows, and chocolate instead of creating your own. If you don't believe this is worth your effects--then try that one.

Wow! This was probably one of the best desserts I've ever made. The marshmallows were SO worth the effort, tender, sweet and juicy, they were a million times better than commercial ones. The graham crackers had a shortbread-like buttery taste that complimented the marshmallows very nicely. Combine that with good old Hershey's chocolate and I'm with Nick Johnson-you have one sweet (both ways) dessert.

This is a sweet recipe (in two ways) try it because it rocks!

I think everyone is missing the point - anything that you can make at home with great, natural ingredients will make a huge difference in taste. Isn't that why we log on and print these recipes? I go to great lengths to have a great culinary experience; life is too short. Thanks epicurious for enhancing my life.

Very Silly. All we ever did at camp was roast marshmallows and then slap them between two graham cracker halves, along with 2 squares of a hershey bar. The heat from the marshmallow melted the chocolate, and that was that!!

Figures -- As difficult to make as it is to make a reservation at your restaurant. Get over yourself.

I haven't seen my version of making s'mores anywhere on this site...it is our family's old world version, and all I share it with never deviate again....you must have a long, sharp stick for toasting, slowly rotate the bottom graham cracker on the sharp end until a hole is drilled, slid graham cracker down just about 3", then follow with half a hershey bar, then the marshmallow, then the top graham cracker. Hold your stick over fire, tilted so your hand holding the stick is near ground, and the end with the smore is over top of fire, nearly horizontal, so as the smore starts to get hot, the chocolate is melting onto its graham cracker "bed". Just as the chocolate starts to melt, remove from heat, and lift your delicacy off stick, smash together and enjoy! Marshmallow will not be browned, but will be hot and melted on inside. Graham cracker may singe around edges on bottom layer, this adds to the campfire experience! TO THE END OF TIME, THERE WILL NEVER BE A BETTER SMORE RECIPE THAN THIS. ALL I PRIVILEDGE WITH THIS SECRET RECIPE NEVER DEVIATE FROM THIS METHOD AGAIN.

Try spreading peanut butter on the graham crackers. Elevates s'mores to a whole new level!

Must agree with Grand Haven and Ukiah on this one.

you're right...why bother to make something as basic and cheap as marshmellows?.... unless you live oversea and can't get some of your kids' favorite "comfort" foods. we have scouts, but no graham crackers or marshmellows! the trick is to let the marshmellows set-up at least overnight and mix a little cornstarch with your powdered sugar. thanks for enabling me to share this american tradition with our friends here in argentina

The homemade marshmellows are delicious but pretty close to impossible to roast over a campfire - however, my kids got over their roasting disappointment when I slapped a big piece of homemade marshmellow on their hot chocolate!

I agree with Mountain View, CA. Why would you want to take a wonderful childhood memory and spoil it with all this work? Doesn't make sense.

I didn't make the 'dish'or any of the other 'dishes'. Why would one bother with all of this when the basic ingredients can be found at the local grocery and the KEY ingredient is a real campfire and some good friends! Get a life folks!
