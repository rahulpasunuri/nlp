An oily, time consuming flop of a dish. Two bites and straight into the trash. Great if you want to get rid of your olive oil and waste your time.

I tweaked as follows: Less oil (used only the oil the anchovies were packed in), chopped macadamia nuts instead of bread and goat cheese. Mixed 'em up, stuffed 'em and stuck them on the grill halved while I was roasting a chicken. Good stuff.

4 large unblemished fresh artichokes 1 flat tin of anchovy filets 3 garlic cloves 1 1/2 cups Progresso Italian flavored bread crumbs Extra Virgin Olive oil Cut about 3/4-inch off the tops of each artichoke. With your scissors, snip off the pointed ends of each artichoke leaf. Cut stems off artichokes, flush with the bottom. Spread the leaves of each artichoke with your fingers as much as possible. Repeat with remaining artichokes. In a food processor combine bread crumbs, garlic, anchovy filets, and 2 tablespoons of olive oil, and pulse until garlic and anchovy are completely incorporated into the crumbs. Place the first artichoke on a dinner plate or pie plate. Take about 1 teaspoon of crumb mixture and place inside one outer leaf. Repeat with the other leaves, working in towards center of artichoke. It isn't necessary to fill every leaf, or go all the way to center. Use about 1/4 of the crumbs for each artichoke. This is tedious but patience makes for a great stuffed artichoke. Stand in a covered pan just large enough to hold a single layer. Add water to a depth of about 1 1/2 inches. Pour a generous drizzle of olive oil over each artichoke, letting it seep in. Bring water to a boil, cover, reduce heat to low and steam artichokes approximately 1 hour (depending on size of artichokes) or until leaves pull off easily. Test for doneness by pulling out a leaf and tasting for tenderness. Check the water level after about 25 minutes, and add more if necessary.

For starters, as a well-seasoned cook, the idea of cutting the crusts off bread, then using store-bought breadcrumbs is absurd. What did the Sicilians do? More than likely, they allowed the crusts to dry, probably from a previous loaf. Using a lesser amount of quality evoo would improve this recipe greatly. I report my results...

I have nothing positive to say about the end result of this receipe. The stuffing is very straightforward but it takes a long time to prepare the artichokes. I was concerned about the cooking upside down in water but it was not a problem. I baked for 1.5 hours and thought they were done. They looked beautiful. That's where it ended. the oil overpowered everything and they could probably have used another 45 minutes. Never again.

Because I had only two artichokes and because the other reviews suggested the recipe is heavy on olive oil, I made my own proportions. I used fresh bread crumbs and skipped the soaking part. I had no mint and just left that out. It was delicious. My seven year old son who had never tried artichokes ate half of mine - he loved it! Next time I'm making more...

Don't believe the hype!! This recipe would be ideal with half the amount of called for oil. We loved it soo much, we ate the extra stuffing in sandwiches after the bar!

WHAT A MESS! Everything up to the point of baking the artichokes was fine. Once baked, the stuffing turns into a gloppy mess. The cooking time is too long. There has to be better recipe out there for baked stuffed artichokes.
