Very nice! When the ice melts it drains the drink to the bottom, so serve with a stirrer.

Great for the hot weather here in Suriname! I colored several batches of ice with different (tasteless)foodcolorings, and they were a hit. Got remarks like "adult snowcones", and "not as sugary as the kids cones". Would definitely, definitely make it again!!!

Great for the warm to hot weather here in Suriname. They're like "adult" snowcones. Real hit with (the adults in)the family. Would definitely, definitely make them again!!
