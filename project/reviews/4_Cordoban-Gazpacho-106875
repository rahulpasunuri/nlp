I LOVE this recipe! It is much easier and faster to make than the usual gazpacho and it's delicious! I've made it twice and everyone loved it! The second time I used only 1/2 C of olive oil and it was equally as good! YUM!

Fabulous and I didn't even use the almonds or the ham or the egg! However, it's all about great tomatoes in the summer. Added lemon juice and extra chopped cucumbers. Guests loved it

I served this as a dip with cheese straws, bread and veggies. It was a big hit. I added a half of a green pepper for additional flavor.

I'm with you, Houston. This salmorejo is fabulous! I have also had it at El Churrasco in Cordoba and it is to die for. 4 forks!

It's funny that people have been so critical of this recipe. Salmorejo is fantastic. You have to love gazpacho, that's for sure, but it is one of the most refreshing tastes in the summer-- the jamon and egg are enveloped in the tomato-ey richness... it's just delicious. I don't think that this recipe is for anyone who likes V-8 or canned tomatoes in her gazpacho, and it should never be served as a meal unto itself... Salmorejo is almost a dip for crusty bread. It is extremely garlicky and heavy... Try serving it as part of an appetizer assortment. Don't discount this delicious dish just because some people don't appreciate Spanish cooking.

There are so many wonderful gaspacho recipes (on this website!) and this is not one of them. Horrible!

This was terrible. I don't even know why I bothered to make this. Run away, quickly, and don't look back.
