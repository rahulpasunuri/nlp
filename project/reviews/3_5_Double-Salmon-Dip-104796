This was delicious! I had made it for a cocktail party that ended up cancelled for snow. So I had a lot of it to eat that weekend!

This is similar to a dip I have been making for years---if you want a fantastic smoked salmon dip everyone will love, try this: 1 container whipped cream cheese, 1/4 cup sour cream, 4ounces smoked salmon (chopped into small strips), 4 tablespoons chopped fresh dill. Mix the ingredients together and taste to see if the dill flavor is strong enough, then let the dip sit in the fridge several hours for the flavors to meld. I use leftover dill sprigs as garnish, but I am sure the caviar would make a nice garnish as well. Serve with thin pumpernickel slices, water crackers, bagel slices, or bagel chips. Enjoy!

I had high hopes for this appetizer but I thought it was a complete flop. I doubled the amount of smoked salmon (the very best I could find) and it still was just bland. If you really like smoked salmon don't subject it to this recipe - which I threw out immediately after the party.

Although I am not a fan of smoked salmon, all my friends are. I made this for a dinner party and it was a huge hit! I followed other's advice and doubled the salmon, added a little lemon juice and capers. I didn't buy the row, but I think it would be great for the presentation.

This dip is wonderful! Like other reviewers, I doubled the salmon, but I also used the salmon roe as directed, because I just love it. The dip was really delicious, but this recipe makes a LOT of dip. Next time I'll half it, because I had to throw quite a lot out.

Wow, we loved this one. I added a bit of horseradish and served it with brown cocktail bread. Will definitely make this again :) And it's so easy!

Yum! I followed other's suggestions: doubled the salmon, added capers and dill, skip the caviar, substitued green onion for chives. I didn't have any milk on hand, so I added lemon juice. I realize this is a big deviation from the originial recipe, but the result was fantastic! Also it was super easy--I'll be making it again and again as a low stress party appetizer.

I've made this recipe several times now ... it's always well received and honestly one of the easiest recipes I've ever tried. I too double the salmon and add some fresh lemon, green tobasco and capers (skip the caviar if you worry abou salt). Make this a day ahead if at all possible - the flavors are much more complex.

This was delicious - everybody loved it! I added more salmon and lemon and tobasco (as suggested) and served with flatbread - this will be a favorite!

Thought it needed a little something and the tabasco and lemon did the trick. Used scallions in lieu of chives. Thank you people for your suggestions. So many of the reviews on this site are not reviews at all, but instead consist of attacks, jokes and basically nothing helpful at all. This is the way it should be...very refreshing.

I made the SUPER dip with lots of lemon, capers, double the salmon, and tabasco! It was great. I've also made it with tofutti non-dairy cream cheese which is really good too.

My official "taster" liked this so much, she didn't leave much room for dinner. I liked it better a day after making it. It became much smoother. The flavors mellowed out. A definite keeper.

This was really great! I took the advice of others and used tobasco and lemon juice. Next time, I would definitely add more salmon!!

I have made this several times and always get good reviews. You can use a scallion if you are out of chives. And shrimp works well if you are out of smoked salmon. It's versatile and easy.

This continues to be a favorite. Upon our returns from New York City, we bring some of our favorite Nova Salmon from Zabars. I always save a few slices for this dip. We prefer the dip without the caviar which makes it very salty - however, the caviar does make for a great presentation. I use whipped chive cream cheese as someone suggested, but added the chives listed in the recipe as well. I also tried using lemon juice and Tabasco and liked that as well. We prefer serving this with crackers, as a spread, when serving it at home, but use it as a dip when we take it to a party.

Made this recipe for a party but (being a salmon lover) doubled the salmon. Took the advice of earlier reviewers and added fresh lemon and some tabasco, plus (at the suggestion of a friend)about a tsp. of dill weed. Absolutely too yummy!! This dip will definitely be a guest at all my parties from now on!!

This is very similar to a recipe found in the "Silver Palate Good Times Cookbook". I prefer their recipe which only calls for about half the caviar and the additions of lemon juice and tabasco which gives it some added zip. You need less milk because of the lemon juice and tabasco.

Delicious! I too left out the caviar, but my guests raved anyway...make sure to use best quality salmon. Also you can use chive-flavored whipped cream cheese to save time. People could not get enough of this dip!
