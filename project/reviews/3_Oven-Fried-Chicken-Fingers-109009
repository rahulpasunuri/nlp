I tried it for the first time this evening and it was a huge hit with the kids who asked for 2nds and 3rds. Very easy and definitely a keeper. I used one stick of butter and one egg to help keep the cornflake crumbs on the chicken and it worked perfectly.

I love butter, don't get me wrong. However, I don't see the point in making oven-fried chicken unless you're trying to be healthier that actually frying the chicken in oil. Don't think I'd feel too good about covering chicken in butter to give to my kids, thinking oven-fried means healthier. Has to be a better alternative. Yogurt? Buttermilk? Even egg and buttermilk would be less fat?

I wanted to make this recipe as a healthier alternative to frying. I think I should have stuck to the old way. I don't know what I did wrong but the corn flakes ended up a little soggy instead of crispy like I was hoping. They did stay on though.I don't think I will be making this recipe again.

I didn't think it was as good as I was hoping it to be. Just not delicious. Granted it was a very easy recipe if one is in a rush, but not as yummy as everyone looks forward to...

This is a great alternative to the frozen chx nuggets I usually serve with a side of guilt. I cut the recipe in half & add a dash of garlic powder to the cornflakes. My 3yr old eats it up. I've eaten them cold over salad the next day with blue cheese.

I made this for some friends, along with white rice, french fries, and mini ice-cream sandwiches. I used special k and salted butter. I also salt-and-peppered the chicken strips instead of mixing them with the butter. This recipe allows lots of room to play. Will make these again soon.

My corn flakes didn't stick. Tasted good, but I think I'll look for another recipe.

This review reflects the opinion of the neighborhood children, many of whom view rice as an exotic substance. They gobbled these chicken pieces down, which I had made with Italian bread crumbs rather than cornflakes, and that I served with a yogurt dill sauce (plain yogurt, salt, dry dill weed). My own kid isn't a picky eater, so I'm always at a loss for what to make when his friends stay for supper. This is a keeper.

These are good-make sure to make the cereal very fine so that it isn't recongnizable as "corn flakes". Also, i added a teaspoon of garlic powder and a half teaspoon of chili powder to the butter for more flavor. I might try it with a some ranch dressing mix tossed into the cereal for flavor too. Good without the additions or changes though. Kids loved them.

Nice n' Easy, but definately for the kids. Thought, too, that the recipe was unclear on how to reheat without drying these out, as you were required to let them cool to form the crust properly....?

Great, easy appetizer. Especially good for casual gatherings.

Great choice for a buffet, either for kids or adults. It's fun food. Didn't have any trouble having the cornflakes stick to the chicken, but I'd use less butter.While baking them the house smelled like popcorn. I've even made the cones shown at the picture and it was really fun to have them like that. I prepared them the night before, refrigerate them and baked them a couple of hours before the party.

I had high hopes for this recipe since it looked so good in the magazine. Unfortunately it was bland and the corn flake pieces didn't stick to the meat well at all. I made it exactly as listed. You really need egg and flour to get crumb coating to stick and you need more than salted cereal to get flavor. Ina Garten's parmesan chicken on popsicle sticks is a thousand times better - more work but worth it.

this was posted as a recipe for kids, and that it is. the "crust" was all soggy and smeared off as you picked them up. i was just trying to satisfy a fried chicken finger craving without the frying part. blech!

Great recipe. Have made it twice for my six-year-old. The first time I dipped the chicken strips in butter, as called for. Last night, I dipped the chicken strips in whole-milk yogurt, which I had thinned a bit with milk, and seasoned w/ salt and pepper. I think it tasted better; it didn't have that rich buttery taste that can almost be too much with poultry or meat(like butter on a steak). The crushed cornflakes stick better to the yogurt, too. Definite great kid food.

This recipe was an excellent treat! Extremely crispy and light. Corn Flake crumbs are the essential component to this recipe. In order to cut our the butter, I substituted with 2 large eggs and 1/4 cup olive oil beaten with freshly ground pepper and 2 teaspoons cavender's greek seasoning. The end result was top notch.

My 8 year old gives these her greatest praise: "2 thumbs up, Mom!" And the adults don't mind eating them either.

I used vinegar instead of butter, and it worked great! It gave it a tangy flavor, without the fat! I just soaked the breast bits in vinegar, sprinkled salt and pepper on them while they were soaking (about 15 minutes), then dredged them in the cornflakes. Delicious!

It´s a great recipe and very easy to make. Also try it by adding some parmesan cheese to the coating mix and some chopped parsley. Your family and friends will love it!

Needs more cornflakes than it says. Otherwise - yummy! Great homemade kid-food. Next time I'll add a bit of cayenne for the grown up portions. Honey mustard is also good.

Had this at a First Birthday Party and the adults went crazy for them! I plan on making them for my son's birthday as well.

Similar to what I've been making for my kids for a few years now. I recommend marinating the chicken in (any)salad dressing before the cornflakes go on. I particularly like baking the strips instead of frying them (what I've always done.)Really yummy, a definite hit.
