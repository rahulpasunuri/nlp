Additional comment. Agree with reviewer to try thickening with cornstarch for more elegant gravy.

I followed the recipe exact except used beef shank. Fabulous. Like others served with parmesan polenta (Bon Appetite, 9/98) on this web site. I made the Polenta in advance, sliced it and broiled to crisp. Yummy!

We tend to make this for special occasions it is superb. There is always sauce left over we put the extra in ice cube trays and freeze it. Then when we're cooking say veal cutlets we use the defrosted cubes to make a sauce. Add a little brandy and some cream and you've got a nice sauce for very little work.

Made as listed. It was very good, but I would only remake with very thick shanks, ours were a little too thin. Will put into the rotation, but we still prefer an ossobuco milanese (without tomatoes).

Am in the minority here, but I didn't think this dish all that special. Kind of boring, and I'm rating it after the initial cooking to see if the flavors developed any further. I'd go with a normal osso bucco recipe next time I run across a sale on veal shanks.

This was kind of boring. Maybe needed more onions and garlic.Polenta was good.

What a find! Although I love osso buco and tomato based sauces, this veal shank recipe sans tomatoes and seasoned with fresh sage is outstanding. My picky husband says it's company good, but the recipe takes little time for a big taste and is deceptively simple. I served it over linguine to catch the flavorful sauce. In the future I may serve it over potatoes or polenta. Yum, yum.

Excellent! made the whole menu for New Years Eve and I can't wait to make this veal recipe again. It was so good and so tender........

Very,very good. Took longer to cook, but meat was fork tender. Made three shanks but all other ingredients plus more sage.

Fabulous. I served this with parmesan polenta and it was a perfect side. The only change I will make next time is to thicken the sauce with cornstarch instead of flour, I think the sauce will look more elegant that way.

I thought that this was good, albeit very time-consuming, particularly the final 30 minutes of reducing the sauce. The next time I make it, I am going to pair it with a classic risotto, rather than the polenta with butternut squash, which I found to be disappointingly bland and lumpy.

Excellent recipe. I've made it with veal and with beef shanks and they both work equally well. Wonderful sauce, and lovely texture.

We made this dish for dinner guests and everyone loved the tender, flavorful meat. It was an easy recipe to make and I was able to enjoy my guests since it basically cooked itself up until it was time to make the gravy. We served it over mashed potatoes and all the plates were clean!

This is a wonderful easy to make recipe. It has impressed my family and friends. Lots of good flavors and wonderful with the butternut squash polenta.

We served this dish for company and everyone raved. I found the meat delicious but I probably wouldn't make the polenta again.

Since I could not get veal shank the day I went to the butcher, I substituted center cut beef shanks. As it was cooking, I skimmed off some of the fat from the top. The recipe was absolutely delicious with the butternut polenta! I used steamed spinach as an accompaniment. I would definitely make this recipe again for a dinner party.

This recipe, along with the Butternut Squash Polenta, is my very favorite for a small dinner party. The perfect fall menu!

This recipe is really delicious and worth taking the time to make! Next time I'm going to serve each portion in a bowl on a bed of mashed potatoes.

Have made this dish 3 times now for dinner parties and each time it gets better. Every time I make it someone wants the recipe. Incredibly easy for parties and definitely taste better with time. Sometimes I've added variety of mushrooms which has made a delicious sauce to serve over wild rice. It's a keeper.

Having read the previous reviews, I was really looking forward to preparing this version of osso buco for my dinner party. Very disappointing...the sauce left alot to be desired. The recipe doesn't tell you whether or not to reduce the wine after bringing to a boil. I did and it was awful. I tried to improvise with tomato paste and stock, but it still was a disappointment. Other osso buco recipes I've gotten from this site have been much better.

The flavors are even better the 2nd day, so make ahead if possible. We served it with mushroom risotto-perfecto !!

A terrific dinner party dish b/c it cooks for two and a half hours. It tastes out of this world.

very good. It's better when it's made the day before and reheated.

Outstanding dish - so simple and easy to prepare and can easily be made earlier in the day. Served the bone separately (no one was interested in marrow) but kept shank otherwise intact. Served with caramelized carrots and roasted green beans with pine nuts. An elegant dish sure to satisfy friends and family. This one goes in the recipe box. Added a touch of tomato paste while sauce was reducing which enriched color even more. Great preparation.

This is a great osso buco. I like the liberal use of sage. I even garnish with some fresh sauteed sage leaves in olive oil. I have made this twice since I frirst saw your recipe. Mainly because I hade a quantity of 2" forshanks in my freezer. OnceI put in a covered pan in a slow oven for 2 hours and finished the sauce with a little marsala wine on the stove top and served with a warm polenta and wilted spinich with procuitto. ENJOY

Only problem is making sure you don't cook too long as meat falls of bone. Anyone know how you tell when enough is enough?

I substituted pork for the veal. Everyone raved! Everyone wanted the recipe.A permanent addition to my recipe box. Thank you Bon Appetit!

Have made this receipe twice since magazine came out, and it was a hit both times. First time served the butternut squash and polenta but didn't care for the texture. Second time prepared the squash as in the squash/polenta recipe but substituted mashed yukon gold potatoes. Great combination!! Dessert was the pumpkin-bread pudding brulee. Terrific fall menu. Was always a little scared of veal recipes - but this is fabulous.
