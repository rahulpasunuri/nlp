I've made this twice. The first time, I used cream cheese. This time, I used hickory smoked goat cheese. Major yum! Both times I halved the recipe, and we found it was more than enough for 2.

Wonderful. I made the grits a little differently, using old fashioned stone ground grits. So it took a little longer, but still very easy.

Nice and easy. I was reluctant to mix cream cheese and shrimp, but it worked. As other reviewers suggested, I cooked a few strips of bacon, chopped them up, and sprinkled them on top of the final presentation. Also, my wife loves cilantro on everything, so I sprinkled a little chopped cilantro on it, too. With or without, the final product was very good.

This was phenomenal! Followed the advice of other reviewers and used some cajun seasoning on the shrimp, put a little parmesan in the grits, and sprinkled some crisp bacon on the top. Oh, and didn't cook the green onions, used as a garnish on the hot shrimp. Highly recommend.

Thought this recipe was simple and great! Instead of the green onions at the end I sauteed them with the butter before the broth went in. I also added a handful of mild cheddar and thought it gave the flavor a little kick. For the shrimp I put some seafood magic seasoning on them before cooking them. Can't wait to make this again.

I made this for Christmas, only I stupidly forgot the cream cheese! I had Chavrie plain goat cheese so I used that, even better than the test run! This is so easy and quick.

Wonderful! Made it tonight to see if we should serve it over Christmas. Made it exactly as stated, then added a piece of bacon crumbled on top. Quite yummy. This actually served three of us, not the stated two.

Terrific! I used 2 cups broth and half cup water,only one tbs. of butter, and only one tbs. of 1/3 less fat cream cheese for the grits. For shrimp, I finely chopped 2 slices of bacon and sauteed with a tiny bit of butter and garlic, then added sliced peppers (thawed from a frozen bag from TJ's) with shrimp and sprinkled it with Tony Chachere's creole seasoning (found in most supermarkets). I topped the whole dish with lime juice and green onions to serve. Everyone loved it!

Delicious! I will definitely make this again. Instead of cooking the green onions, I sprinkled them on top of the shrimp right before serving.

I sauted about 1/4c white onion, one clove garlic, and 1/2 ea yellow and red bell pepper. Removed Vegs and then sauted shrimp til just done. Tossed w/ vegs. Cooked grits as directed w/o milk. Put both dishes in oven and held at 150 degrees for almost an hour til everyone got home. Just before serving I squeezed lime over shrimp and thinned grits w/ some milk because I didn't have any half and half. Very good. Some "kick" (red pepper,tabasco, etc) is a good idea. Do try this recipe. It's easy, tasty, and can be tailored to what you have on hand.

I decided to try this instead of another recipe I had and used before. I am so glad I did - much better and so easy to prepare. GREAT... I will certainly make this again!

I made this last night with a bit less butter in the grits and added about half a teaspoon of white truffle oil. I browned the butter for the shrimp then added the lime to make the sauce. It was amazing. I would make this for any dinner party.

EAsy to prepair and oh, what a delight! I added by accident, all fo the butter to the grits but they were all the better. This is a wonderful recipe and I know this will becoe a staple!

I made this back in January for a crowd of 150. Had to keep stirring it with a boat paddle to keep it warm and keep it from sticking. It was divine and very well received. I did add roasted red peppers and thought it was a good addition. A real keeper, although I don't relish the thought of making it for that size crowd EVER again!!

Divine. And very, very rich...

Easy, tasty, and would definitely make this again for southern guests. We substituted scallops for the shrimp, which worked better than expected. For the grits, we added 4 slices of bacon (what are grits without pork fat?) and cayenne pepper because it needed a kick. Yummy!

My husband and I will never make grits any other way. This is a real keep - excellent recipe.

don't yell at me but I needed a grits recipe with what I had on hand, goat cheese, fresh chives and shrimp. Found a recipe for exactly that on epicurious, so used that for my grits and this recipe for my shrimp. I only added some hot pepper flakes and it was fabulous! I'm sure since goat cheese is mild in flavor like cream cheese, this recipe would be great too!

this is a delicious dish but its even better if you sautee red, yellow peppers, and bacon with the shrimp. its also very good to use spicy cheese grits...

Rating: 3
This was very good. I used large scallops instead of shrimp - had them on hand - and they worked just fine. I did like others suggested and added cajun spice to the seafood. I also cooked the seafood in olive oil and garlic to cut down on the butter. I used vegetable broth to cook the grits - we aren't meat eaters. Overall this was very good.

Rating: 4
i agree. to give it a cajun fare, i added cajun spices to melted butter and shrimp. when possible, i use pink argentine shrimp. i have made this dish countless times, and every time it gets better.

This recipe is better than at a very fancy restaurant in North Caolina. I will definitely make it again!!

Thought this was an extremely easy recipe to make -- considering what they charge in lowcountry restaurants, this is a real bargain.

Great shrimp and grits recipe...and it can be modified to a low-fat recipe and still tastes terrific!

Rating: 2
being a true southerner i was interested to try this receipe - while tasty, i found the grits to be extremely rich - and then to saute the shrimp in the butter was just too much for my palate - shrimp and grits and a perfect combo - and i have always made just plain ole grits with water and then added butter and salt and pepper to taste - i think that the addition of the scallions is great though -

Made this for our monthly cooking class..southern cooking theme! It was just delicious! Would be perfect for brunch...A definite keeper!!! I found the flavors to be just right!

I am with Jo Miller - I used the "Shrimp with Cajun Butter" recipe. The grits were great. I also used Neufchatel cheese, no butter and fat free milk. This reduced the fat so that I could use a stick of butter in the shrimp recipe. VERY TASTY!!But you don't need all that fat to get creamy grits.

Maybe with Jo's advise--adding some CAJUN--would help this out. Way too bland and terribly mediocre.

I actually used the grits section of this recipe to go with "Shrimp with Cajun Butter" from the March 1994 Bon Appetit (not in the archives but if you email me I will forward it to you- believe me, you want it!). These delicious grits made believers out of my family. Wonderful!

i have made this dish several times...it is just scrumptious!! i'm a southerner, but even my yankee boyfriend raves about it. yum-ola!!

These are the creamiest, most satisfying grits I've ever eaten (and I'm a Georgia girl!). I used fat-free products (broth, cream cheese, half and half). I served the dish with the Jalapeno Cornbread, and everyone raved.

absolutely delicious!! Never having been a big fan of grits, this recipe made a believer out of my husband and I. Will definitely make it again!!

I have made this dish on a number of occasions. Actually had a party just so I could serve this dish. Everyone raved about it!

Two of our favorites, shrimp and grits in a preparation similar to a favorite Chicago eatery, Wishbone. Wonderful flavors yet simple to prepare.

surpisingly delicious; so rich a little goes a long way. Make this and astound company!

this meal was great, although we substituted quick grits for stone-ground yellow grits, and we added the lime juice and melted butter on top instead of cooking the shrimp in it. It was great!

We increased the recipe to serve 5 at a dinner party. It was a hit. Note: We substituted the 'Grits with Goat Cheese and Chives' for the grits here.
