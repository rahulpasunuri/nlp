I love this recipe! I did change 2 ingredients to accommodate what I had in the pantry. I used red curry powder from the Philippines and boneless, skinless chicken thighs. I read the reviews and cut back the fish sauce to 2 T. I cut the lime juice to 2 T. I only had 1 can of coconut milk. It was plenty of flavor and cut back the calorie count. Can't imagine the soup with 2 cans. Too heavy. The soup fed 4 of us even with this omission. I added chopped baby bok choy and fresh mushrooms. Best soup recipe I have found with the flavors I love.

I'm rating this with 3 forks for "delicious" because it is! It is not exceptional because it definitely does (in my opinion) require half as much lime juice and fish sauce. 3 tbs each is enough, add more to taste. I also added 1 tsp of red curry paste and I will experiment in the future with making this soup with different types of curry powders and pastes.

I actually found the flavors very flat (primarily salty/sour) so I added some red curry paste (I had used madras curry powder) and some agave to the broth before adding the chicken back in. This helped some, but I agree with other reviewers in that at the very least the peppercorns would be better utilized in some cheese clothe and not left free to roam.

I made this one evening to take to a sick friend the next day, it held up well over night even with the coconut addition. I added straw mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and a red pepper. I put too much red curry paste and it was very spicy but still tasty. I really think that at least 2 Tbs of sugar is necessary to offset the pungency of the fish sauce and lime. Overall a great dish, one I would make again.

This was great! Fast, easy. Next time I will add veggies. Likely broccoli and red pepper.

Great recipe-I left the peppercorns out and it still had plenty of flavor-you have to like curry though

I really liked this recipe. Just recently returned from Vietnam and am using this to do a Vietnam dinner. I added the straw mushrooms and green onions, as others suggested. Since this is an appetizer soup, I tried the rice noodles but decided it was too heavy for an appetizer, so I'm skipping that ingredient. I added salt (really necessary) and pepper. Also I removed the peppercorns, lemongrass and ginger after cooking, as others suggested. The result was a fantastic, wonderful recipe!

This has been a staple in my kitchen for the last ten years. Take out the lemongrass and peppercorns before serving through.I double the curry and spices as we like hot. This is a winner :)

i love this recipe but you definitely have to do something to contain the aromatics, since they arent particularly edible. i put the lemongrass, ginger and peppercorns in a cheesecloth sac and fish them out just before serving

I doubled this recipe and only added the noodles to half of it. The other half I added cauliflower, chunks of red bell pepper, and potatoes. I liked the version with the vegetables better. The base of the soup is really tasty - everyone liked it a lot.

a great soup! my very picky daughter even asked for seconds. I doubled the lemon grass and ginger by accident, and it was wonderful.

Wonderful! I didn't have lemongrass, but didn't miss it much. I used one can of light coconut cream and one can of low-fat milk (no cocomut milk on hand). I wish we'd added more rice noodles as others suggested, but the leftovers - with some leftover rice - were delicious.

I played w/ it a little: added a touch of red curry paste, only used one can of coconut milk, served it over rice instead of as a soup. This was really yummy. I will definitely make it again.

A delicious soup, more like a meal than an appetizer. I added the Thai red curry paste for spice as well as thinly chopped green onions, and I substituted Thai basil for the coriander. I also added a small can of drained straw mushrooms for texture and flavor. As another reviewer suggested, I used a whole skinless, boneless chicken breast which removed some fat but did not affect taste significantly. Definitely one I'll make again.

Definietly heed the previous reviews; jullienne, don't mince the lemongrass and be sure to strain it out before eating. Even when minced, the lemongrass is tough and stringy; it will ruin the soup if left in it. It does give good flavor, so I wouldn't omit it; you just have to know what to do with it. Nice soup, and very company-friendly.

There are a number of recipes for soups like this, but this is one of the better ones. A few thoughts: use good curry powder -- i had only the cheap kind on hand this time and it wasn't as good as previous times I've made it. And I minced the ginger this time because the disks were too strong to eat.

Absolutely splendid, just as it is. Perfect combination of spicy, savory and sweet.

Absolutely delicious -- it may even have prevented the flu! I did strain out the ginger root, peppercorns, and lemongrass before adding the shredded chicken, and I added a little bottled ground chili paste to spice it up a bit.

I used 1 stalk lemongrass, bean thread noodles, less lime and fish sauce, less curry, and added 2 tsp. brown sugar. I contained the lemongrass, ginger, and peppercorns in cheesecloth for easy removal. I thought this came out pretty good, but thought it had slightly too much sour taste. I only had a bit of curry powder, so maybe that was the difference. It was even better as leftovers. I will definitely try this one again, with rice noodles, and more curry, possibly more brown sugar.

Everybody in the house loved this! We ate it for 3 days straight. Didn't have any curry so just left it out and it was great. Also, substituted rice in place of the noodles. We are making this again this weekend for company.

This is one of the best soups I have ever made. YUMMY! Here are my changes: more garlic, half the curry powder, add 1 tbs. Thai Chili Paste. I used light coconut milk and 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts. Towards the end, I added: 1 can of straw mushrooms, 1 can of bamboo shoots, and about 2 cups of bean sprouts. Also, as other reviewers have mentioned, be careful not to overcook the noodles. I think that the fresh lime juice is very key to making this recipe work.

Loved this soup. Anything with a thai flavor and coconut milk especially- I'm there! I only found dried lemongrass, so I threw one in to simmer with the soup, then disgarded it later. I also used leftover roasted chicken, just shredded into the soup. I only wished that I had added more noodles, and skipped the boiling part. They were a tiny bit overcooked for me. Will do again. Love the fresh lime, it is a must!!

This soup certainly was tasty, but the recipe should state that the lemongrass must be strained out of the liquid before eating. It was so fibrous and tough, even after mincing in the food processor, that it made the soup unpleasant to eat. Next time I'll know better. Like others, I substituted red curry paste (2 tablespoons, but that would be too much for those with a delicate palate) for the curry powder. I think the paste really improves the soup, and it made for a prettier appearance.

Really really good used thai red curry paste rather then powder

I Loved this recipe!! BUT! I made some changes...For a vegetarian meal I exclude the chicken. Then tripled amount of noodles, excluded peppercorns, added 1 1/2 tbsps.red curry paste for spice( less if your not into too much hotness), it's a perfect meal. Everyone that I prepared this for loved it!!! I Served in a big soup bowl with lots of noodles and the broth on top. It's fabulous!!

We really like this one! It is a relatively simply way to augment a dinner with some Asia cuisine, or as a meal on it's own. I made a boquet garni with the lemongrass and pepper corns in it. Do not soak the rice noodles too long (doh!) and use a large pot so they can separate properly (doh! doh!).

The Lemon Grass is supposed to be strained from the broth and discarded, not eaten, because its blades are very sharp, even after being boiled with the crry broth. I love this soup and my mom also makes it.

Really good! Took about an hour to complete. Only used one can of coconut milk and subbed basil for the cilantro. Will do again. Nice Saturday night supper for two, with plenty of leftovers for lunch on Sunday.

great flavors. not sure if i added too much lime juice or what but it definately changed the overall flavor. next time i think i would add a little, taste and adjust from there.

This was pretty good. I live in gourmet hell so none of the *ed items were available at my grocer. I cannot even find seeds to grow lemon grass. Here are some good substitutions shoould your store be equally lacking: Lemon grass: 1/2 the amount of lemon zest. Their fish sauce: Nam pla or ground down dried baby shrimp. Rice Noodles: regular Italian vermicelli.Unsweetened coconutmilk: Either thawed, frozen unsweetened shredded coconut or a whole coconut, cracked in half then baked at 250 for about 30 minutes. You can then remove the coconut easily from the shell. Shred it or chop it up. Now with either of the coconut choices, put it into a blender or processor with a couple cups of milk and absolutely pulverise it. put that through a sieve and there you are. I think it is better than the canned version really. I made a big batch and froze it in icecube trays then plunked the cubes in a ziplock. I would not want to go though the milking process every time I had a hankering for curry with coconut.

I used red curry paste instead of the curry powder, added mushrooms and red peppers and basil, and it was great. I would never in a million years, however, add the peppercorns or the lemongrass as they are hidden crunchy nightmares in the dish and almost ruin it. The peppercorns don't seem to add anything and while lemongrass had a great flavor, unless you know a way to soften it, you don't need the trouble.

I used only one can of coconut milk and increased the broth. I bruised the lemongrass (since I hate chewing it) and used a bit more than called for to compensate. Also, dark meat is great in this as it doesn't dry out so much. I omitted the fish sauce and used a bit of soy. Yummy!

Wonderful blend of flavors, but very oily. I might try reducing the oil for sauteing the garlic to just 1 tbsp and use light coconut milk. Go easy on the chili oil, it can overwhelm the other flavors.

I loved it! I couldn't find lemongrass, so I substituted lemon zest. My roommates didn't like it, but they're boring meat-and-potatoes people.

excellent blend of flavors. very exotic, will certainly impress your friends, although my 4 year old son still prefers chicken nuggets.
