Awful! Do not make this, so not worth the effort. I got a 40 lb box of fuji apples and this is the only recipe I have made so far that I would NEVER make again.

Because I had a 2 yr old to entertain, I took many short cuts and my recipe is greatly altered. Still, I have some interesting notes. I could not find honey crisp apples at first and prepared apples from a mystery tree down the lane and fuji as the substitute. I ended up doing an apple taste test. The honey crisps apples were really amazing and even much better than fuji. I used this recipe to try to cook up apples quickly and only added butter and powdered sugar and ginger and it was really good. I did not like the automatic apple peeler and it made a mess in the kitchen. Using to learn a knife to peel and slice is very satisfying. This issue shows how to make one long peel from each apple so I followed this instruction. I do not know what the apple should look or taste like when it is carmelized. The apples were just soft cooked but really nicely textured with the spices. I poured heavy cream, just a bit for each. Very simple and nice. Please let me know if you can describe caramelized. I used 5 and 6 inch pyrex bowls as the little ramekins held so few apples and they cook down. Perhaps saran wrap would help hold in more if pile high? I did not use saran wrap because I do not like the idea of plastic touching food especially when heated. I look forward to using this again and trying coriander.

Just delicious. I cheated a little: tossed the slices with the sugar and then the melted butter before layering in the ramekins. I used a glass baking dish on top of all the ramekins to weigh them down. I had no problem with the plastic wrap.

Followed this recipe to a "T" using fugi apples. It was a fair amount of work (thank goodness for the mandolin!)and I thought I would be dissappointed but it exceeded my expectations! It is not a crisp if that's what you're looking for. The flavors and layers were intense and worth the work. Serve with the specified topping. Yummy!

My plastic wrap was fine but I think the trick is to make sure that all of the plastic wrap is covered by foil, not exposed.As far as the actual apples go, I think that they were supposed to be soft, not carmelized, and it did taste like the inside of an apple pie. With the addition of that wonderful orange zest!! That added such a special flavor. But I have to agree that it was a lot of work to make the individual ramekins and I probably won't make this recipe again because of that. A pie pan is probably the way to go. We served it over vanilla ice cream.

Thanks to previous reveiwers, I quickly pulled the plaastic wrap off the pie plates already in the oven. ( Did not do ramekins.) Also suggest grating the organge peel in a shallow bowl, adding sugar and ginger and coriander. Mix with fork and then use fork to sprinkle over buttered layers. I consider this a crust-less apple tartin - the addition of a puff pastry "lid" baked at a high temp on top of pre-baked apples just before serving would be appropriate.

Follow your instincts and skip the saran wrap! Mine also melted. This wasn't bad, but was a lot of work and time for basically the inside of an apple crisp.

To the previous reviewer: I haven't made the recipe, and I generally don't like it when people write about recipes that they haven't tried, but I have some ideas. I actually wanted to try this myself because it sounds delicious, easy, elegant, and not too unhealthy, so I'm glad that I read your review about the problems that you've had. So--I would suggest not covering the apples, or maybe only covering them in the beginning so that they do not dry out. If they're covered the whole time, they will not caramelize. I have no idea why a recipe would suggest putting plastic wrap in the oven. Tinfoil or even parchment paper would be a much better idea. It might be nice to put a tiny bit of a crumble topping on towards the end. Just enough so that the pretty apple slices aren't covered up, though. Good luck!

I was so disappointed!! I did everything as the recipe said...First, my plastic wrap melted! Is there a secret to that? Did I use the wrong kind? The apples didn't carmelize at all. They were just soft like an apple crisp but without the yummy, crunchy topping. I'd love some suggestions.
