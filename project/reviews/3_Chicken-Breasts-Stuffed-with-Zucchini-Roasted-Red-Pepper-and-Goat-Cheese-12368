My entire family gave this raves. I cooked chopped bell peppers and celery in oil with garlic salt, pepper and Italian seasonings. Then added grated zucchini after drying it in paper towels. Next I added goat cheese. I pounded flat two chicken breasts, spread the mixture over them, rolled them with toothpicks, and sprinkled with chopped rosemary. I browned them in oil on the stove before baking them at 350 for 20 mins. To the pan I added chicken stock, two sprigs of rosemary, a little cream, and a touch of goat cheese. I poured the sauce over the breasts when they were done. Gourmet!

Only had skinless breasts, so followed advice to slice and pound thinly and rill up with stuffing. Also added garlic to that, skipped zucchini, used piquino peppers and feta cheese. Amazing results! The trick is to brown the rolls really well on each side before turning to make sure they cook through. And either snip off the ends of the toothpick or place carefully so that you can cook properly on all sides. Served with buttered orzo and sprinkled everything with fresh chopped chives.

We enjoyed the recipe. The first time I made it exactly, however, I did not squeeze the zucchini dry enough. I used a kitchen towel the next time. I also did not like the stuffing under the skin. The next time I made a pocket in the middle of the breast after pounding it slightly. Liked that much better. I also tried goat cheese with red pepper and added more crushed red pepper and sun-dried tomatoes, yumm.The 3rd time I cut a pocket from the top of a bone-in chicken breast down to the bone and along the sides, using herb goat cheese with extra fresh herbs and baked it in the oven, pretty good. I had a little trouble with the sauce. Just couldn't get enough flavor, so I added chicken stock concentrate and 1 TBsp cream and extra herbs.It's an easy dish and worth it.

This recipe was pretty good, but, like most, I did a little alteration. I didn't have goat cheese, so I used feta. Also, I just used thin sliced chicken breasts that I sauted in the same pan and topped them with the zuccini mixture because I wasn't sure my kids would eat it. They loved the zuccini mixture and had no idea it was nutritional!!Served with orzo and fresh baby spinach.

I've been making this recipe without changes since it first appeared in the 07/91 Gourmet issue. Thank goodness the poor reviews weren't written when I first made it or my family might have missed out on one of its favorite meals. I let my butcher debone the chicken breasts and make the pocket, then I follow the directions exactly, making sure each side is WELL browned before turning down the heat to complete the cooking. I serve it with the couscous timbales from the same issue. For my family, and many times for guests, this recipe is a real winner.

This was kind of blah. It needs something--fresh herbs,some seasoning--to rescue it. I probably won't make it again even though we both ate ours without complaint.

I didnt realize how much I had changed the recipe, so Im not sure my rating counts...I omitted the zuchinni and baked the chicken...it was good but the cheese just oozed out when it melted. I think it needed a binder, like an egg...

I made some changes and this was delicious! I added garlic to the saute...and substituted a bunch of fresh spinach for the zucchini. Sauted the spinach until wilted and liquid evaporated, added fresh roasted peppers and goat cheese. Then I used thin chicken cutlets....put stuffing on each and rolled. Browned the rolls in a little more oil, seasoned with salt and pepper and and put in a baking pan. I deglazed the pan and poured over the cutlets, covered with foil and baked about 30 min. at 350. Yummmmm...

I improvised on this dish a bit using what I had in the fridge. I substituted red chard for zucchini and added a touch of bacon grease for flavor to the sautee, used skinless bonlees chicken breast and baked in the oven on 400 rather than on the stovetop.

After many, many successes from epicurious recipies, I've finally found one that isn't a keeper. Goat cheese and roasted red peppers are an excellent combo, but the grated zuchinni created a somewhat unpleasant texture. Also, the skin was unable to lose its looseness, leaving it somewhat fatty and unappealing. The time involved doesn't justify the result.

Yuck! I had to lick the wet spot on the driveway to get the taste out of my mouth! Save your chicken for a better use!

Delicious! I baked the chicken instead of sauteing - I could then use extra filling in the chicken. A nice combination of tastes.

This is a wonderful dish that I've made many times. The chicken is always juicy and the red pepper and goat cheese mix incredibly well.
