i thought it was horrible. i made it for a family gathering and everyone, including me, hated it. it was dry and waaayyy to much breadcrumbs. i felt like it needed milk or something to make it creamy. i will never fix this again.

Good base proportions. I also substituted last 3/4 c cheese with fresh parmesan and used half provolone and half sharp farm cheddar for the other 2 cups. Didn't have macaroni so used penne. Added 1/4 tsp cayenne,1 tsp basil(dried), 2 tsp chives in the white sauce at the end. What's this thing about children? My adult guests loved it with Epic.Veal Gremolata and sauteed fresh spinach! Very moist. YUM!

Made some revisions based on other testimonials. I doubled the recipe. I used elbow macaroni instead. I just put in a dash of Worchestershire sauce. I used 2% milk. I added some finely chopped onions and a little cayenne powder. I omitted the bread crumbs and didn't add cheese to the top of the casserole.

Pretty easy to jazz up. I used quinoa shells and added roasted butternut squash and steamed broccoli. I also added some adobo sauce from canned chipotles, as well as some cayenne to the bechamel. I used toasted panko crumbs on top and added some parm to them. Pretty tasty! If you add veggies, make extra bechamel. They soak it up while baking.

Use some onions and dry mustard and white pepper. Add 1/2c to cup of half and half. Sprinkle fresh ground black pepper on top.

I have noticed that many people have been upset about this recipe's failure as a 'mac and cheese' recipe. The cause for this is because this is actually a recipe for Macaroni Pie, a favourite side of Caribbean and Creole peoples. The dish is served cut in squared and often sits besides greens, provisions and homestyle fried or stewed chicken. IT is NOT the traditional comfort food mac and cheese that say, Canadians make from scratch or buy from the old KD box. Viewed this way, I think this recipe is great and the varied and sharper the cheddars the better. I have completed cooking it for a family gathering and it's samples went over very well. Thx.

I'm not sure what this was, but it wasn't mac & cheese & it wasn't impressive. The comment that it was like pasta in a roux was dead on.

This is good; however mixed reviews with the kids. Definitely double the sauce, and need adjustments with bread crumbs (1/2). I liked it with adjustments.

This was a good. Will make a great meals for kids. We can't get cheddar here in Italy :-( so I made it with 12 oz. of Edamer (milder than cheddar) and 4 oz of Provolone (2/3 of the cheese in and 1/3 on top). As suggested I halved the Worcestershire sauce and added some melted butter to the bread crumbs. For a real kid meals I'll add a few sliced hot dogs...

I liked this recipe and added extra cheese but I thought it needed a sharper saltier tastse. I didn't have it this time, but next time I would use Vermont Cabot cheese, extra sharp. I will make this again and the toddlers liked it.

This was an ok dish. I used extra sharp cheddar and parmesan as other reviews suggested. It was good and my toddler ate it - but it didn't jump off the plate. And it was complicated enough that I am not likely to make it again.

I make this recipe all of the time and it is delicious. I love macaroni and cheese and this is my favorite recipe. You do need to fiddle with the amounts (more Cheddar and milk; mix Parmesan with the bread crumbs) but I always get requests for the recipe. It is perfect to bring to friends who have just had a baby. It is also nice because you can make it a day ahead.

I agree that it should be cheesier. I added some stinky guyere, parmesan and romano but the key is probably extra sharp cheddar to give it the most kick. I thought there was too much liquid prior to baking but I was wrong. Also shells, spirals or elbows are fine, but it's pasty if not al dente.

To give it a really cheesy taste, I substitute the milk for heavy whipping cream, double the cheddar cheese, and add parmesan cheese as the topping mixed with bread crumbs. this dish is a hit at get-togethers.

This dish doesn't have the cheesy flavor I expected from macaroni and cheese. With the amount of sharp cheddar in it I would expect it to have more of a cheese flavor. It is rather bland but maybe the additional ingredients per other readers is called for.

I think that the recipe provided is a good one, however, I also felt it needed a few adjustments. The second time around, I used 12 oz of sharp cheddar cheese as well as 3 oz of parmesean for the sauce, in addition to a few pinches of cayenne. When making the crust, I added a little melted butter to the breadcrumb mixture as well as additional sharp cheddar and parmesean. It was absolutely splendid and loved by all who had a taste.

I've made this a few times now with some nice sharp cheddar (the people who've said it turned out too bland should try it with the sharpest cheddar available), added a pinch or 2 of cayenne, a couple of chopped tomatoes and a wee bit of parsley. Lovely comfort food!

I made this recipe using cayenne pepper instead of paprika and it was the best macaroni and cheese I've ever had -- really.

Excellent mac and cheese recipe! I embellished by adding a few dashes of Tabasco (chipotle flavor) along with the Worcestershire, and used about 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese instead of the 3/4 cup cheddar with the bread crumbs. Plenty cheesy for me (maybe folks are used to the salty powdered instant "cheese" from the mac & cheese boxes). We make this once or twice a month!

This mac-and-cheese is a little bit bland and the worcestershire was a little overpowering. I paired it with meatloaf, which luckily seemed to compliment it pretty well. I wouldn't recommend relying on this for a main dish . . . it is more of a side dish because of the lack of strong hearty cheesy flavor.

I love this recipe for mac and cheese. Its great in the winter and you can spice it up with a teaspoon of chili or cayenne, or add some flavor using a parmegian or goat cheese. The regular recipe is awesome though too!

This should be called baked macaroni in roux with melted cheese topping. It has an interesting flavor, but it's not macaroni and cheese.

Rating: 1
Relatively easy to make, looks good...but absolutely NO cheese flavor! I was amazed at how bland and pasty this tasted. Consistency was great, but a complete absence of flavor--even though I used extra-sharp cheddar. I thought my taste buds had gone on the blink. None of my family liked this. As far as kid-friendly, I'd rather use a box of Whole Foods shells & cheese, & add breadcrumbs, paprika, etc. & bake--easier & tastier.

I did not care for this dish at all. It needs more cheese and less of the starchy sauce. The Worcestershire sauce flavor was overwhelming. I was disappointed. Even my toddler didn't like it.

Pretty darn good-- I'd definitely recommend adding a bit of cayenne and dry mustard to the roux, increasing the cheddar, and mixing about 1/2 cup of freshly grated parmesan with 1/2 of breadcrumbs. I made this with lemon buttered broccoli spears (also from this website)-- yum! And no, we don't have any kids!

Yummy! Just like my Grandma used to make. I added a dash of cayene and a little dry mustard. I also increased the ingredients proportionally to accomodate 1 lb. of pasta, with no problems. I used the breadcrumbs and liked the crispy crust contrasting with the creamy pasta & sauce.

I think this is probably the recipe that I wanted, I just messed it up. I wanted to use a full pound of corkscrew pasta, so I upped the milk to 4 cups, and added a cup of the pasta water. Also, I didn't want the topping, so I left out the breadcrumbs and added all the cheese at once. To spice it up a bit, I added a pinch of cayenne pepper and dry mustard. Unfortunately, when I poured it into my pyrex pan, it looked entirely too soupy. So I poured off some of the liquid before baking. BIG MISTAKE. The dish came out dry as a bone. Now I know. Next time, I'll be smarter. But I like the idea of being able to do all the work ahead of time.

Simple and I had all the ingredients on hand. I went along with the crowd and halved the Worchesteshire but used the full amount of breadcrumbs. I thought it seemed like too much but the kids liked it. Big hit with the kids.

I followed the advice of several reviewers. I DEcreased the Worcestershire by half, INcreased the sauce by half, decreased the bread crumbs, and added parmesan cheese on top. Made this way, it was fabulous.

Best Mac and Cheese ever... everyone loved it. Only used a few shakes of Worst sauce and added extra cheese on top. Instead of mixing cheese and breadcrumbs I just sprikled the crumbs on top of the cheese. Make sure you don't cover it when cooking the breadcrumbs may be soggy instead of crispy. Actually good enough to serve to company. Probably high in fat and calories... but mmmmm good.

I thought this was a great homemade mac-n-cheese recipe. It was very creamy and cheesey. I added a little extra cheese and followed the recommnedations of the previous reviewers and deleted the bread crumbs and decreased the amount of worcestershire sauce. It is even great warmed up the next day.

I loved it! And thanks to previous reviews I put less bread crumbs and added more milk for a creamier sauce. I made enough to fill two plates and froze one which was just as delicious when we pulled it out.

Very disappointed in the results. I expected a great macaroni and cheese and ended up with bread crumbs and dry pasta. Will make again and cook the roux for a shorter amount of time and add more cheese.

Pretty disappointing after all the reviews. I found it too dry - not at all creamy.

My family really enjoyed this recipe, but I will either omit the bread crumbs, decrease them or add more sauce. With them, it was just a little dry. Also agree with reviewers about decreasing Worchestershire slightly.

Why would anyone add parmesan cheese on top of baked macaroni and cheese? It's an authentic American classic!

Awesome mac and cheese! I took past reviews into account and added more cheese, a touch less worstershire, and sprinkled half a cup of parmesan on top. The bread crumb crust was yummy, too! All in all, I was very impressed (and so was my husband). I think I'll make it again for Thanksgiving!

Macaroni and Cheese was always one of my favorite dishes to make. This recipe helped me to improve on an old favorite.

I will make this again, but with some changes. We thought that 1 T. of worcestershire sauce was too much, I will definately cut it down to maybe half next time, and it could have used more cheese. We really liked the breadcrumb coating, I also sprinkled some parmesan on top. My family liked it, especially my one year old.

I found this recipe quick and easy to make with the outcome being very good for the amount of effort. I added a cup of grated parmesan for additional flavor. I would make sure the noodles are very al dente next time before baking.

Frankly, I found this recipe to be a bit dry. Yes, the sauce sounds creamy and other reviewers claimed the result, but I thought it was lacking. While the taste was good in-and-of itself, I would omit the breadcrumbs (which I found grainy and irrelevant to mac&cheese) and increase the cheese topping a bit as well as decrease the amount of time in cooking the roux. I tried these options and it came out much better. (er, at least to my taste)....

This is the first recipe that my family did not like from all of your files. It just didn't taste as good as Mom's recipe. Sorry can't give you a good rating on this one. But everything else I've tried has been a 3 or 4 forker.
