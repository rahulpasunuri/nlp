This was awesome. Made last night for first night of Passover and was a massive hit with both kids and adults. Some of the reviews said to double the chocolate-no need for that, BUT do use high quality bittersweet and only cook for 35-40 minutes for sure! Definitely will make again and not just for Passover. Also wicked easy!

The raspberry sauce made this desert... this is a desert that will stand up at any holiday, not just for passover.

cake is delicious but I have a great deal of trouble straining the raspberries.It takes forever and more seems left behind that i get as sauce. Any suggestions

Very yummy and easy to make. I didn't have a 9'' springform, so used a 9 inch pan, but the sides were to low, so it became sort of mushroom looking, and the center fell after cooling. Not to worry - I cut off the top sides, flipped the cake and instead of powedered sugar used chocolate shavings on top. It received raved reviews at the Passover seder - it's pretty decadent tasting, but not heavy, feels very light. I didn't have time for the raspberry sauce, but I don't think anyone noticed it missing.

This is the best passover dessert ever! I've made it for a few years now and it's never failed. I put the raspberry sauce in a pitcher and people pour it all over their cake, their fruit, and whatever else is out there! DEFINITELY MAKE THIS!!!

I have been making this for several years now and it has never failed. I serve the sauce in a pitcher and people pour it over their cake, their fruit and any other dessert that's on their plate. I take the extra sauce and stick it in the freezer and we eat it like sorbet!

This beats most all Passover dessert recipes I've made that are dry and hard as a rock. After reading the other reviews, I used Pareve margerine and double the chocolate (good quality makes a difference). It was a crowd pleaser for sure.

This was a great passover dessert. I got oodles of complements on it at a large seder. I made a fresh strawberry sauce because they were in season. The top of the torte gets all crusty and ugly as the rest of the torte falls so plan to turn it over.

An excellent recipe. Reduce sugar and butter to half and make only half the raspberry sauce.

I made this dessert for a dinner party as I was looking for something pareve to serve. It is excellent by "Passover" dessert standards, but contrary to some other reviews, I would not say it is great for any occasion. Easy to make and very moist and light tasting for a Passover cake. Next time I would add more bittersweet chocolate as it did not have a very chocolate flavour.

I've made this cake several times, and it's very good, but the time I accidentally doubled the chocolate it became exceptional. Now I make it for all sorts of occasions and kosher dinners, not just pesach. Investing in bars of good pesach chocolate (instead of chocolate chips) also makes a huge difference.

I thought this cake was excellent and light. Everyone took seconds, and I will definitely make it again. The only thing I will change is to use an 8-inch pan, as I found it to be rather shallow.

Rating: 1
Despite all the wonderful reviews, I found this rather disappointing. It was very rich and sweet, but despite using a good quality chocolate, I didn't think it had a strong chocolatey bite. The raspberry sauce (you only need 1/2 the recipe) saved it. I think I'll go back to making my meringue-based recipes next year.

Love this!! This is the 4th or 5th Passover I'll have had it on the menu. I serve it with a frozen (non-dairy) lemon mousse and of course the raspberry puree, and my family goes wild for it.

Very tasty cake. I enjoyed it tremendously. Easy to make and had no problems with it. Best served that day though.

I LOVE this recipe and make it for almost every special occasion. A couple of things: it's great non-kosher (i.e. with regular butter) and I always add a pinch of 5-spice powder and/or pepper (great with anything chocolate).

Made this for 2 seders last week and it was a HUGE hit at both. I sprinkled sugar on top and served with fresh berries. I will definately make this again, and won't wait until next Passover to do it.

I made this last week for the seder we hosted and it was amazing. Several guests were practically licking their plates. I can't wait to make it with better quality chocolate (not the kosher for passover chips)!

This is easily the best Passover dessert we have ever had. Just don't get upset when your beautiful fluffy cake flops. It is supposed to do that. I sprinkled sugar on the top with a doily and put berries around the outside, and it looked beautiful. The raspberry sauce is also the perfect complement for the cake.

Made this for Pesach two nights ago and there was not a crumb left. Delicious with the raspberry sauce (which I saw many people drizzling over all the other desserts as well!) Wonderful recipe.

Even yummier than I remembered. This time I put some fresh strawberries, oj and sugar in the mini processor for a nice topping. A little chunky and less tart than the raspberries. Pesach desserts were not so yummy when I was a little girl.

An excellent Kosher desert that was applauded by many "Mmmmms" at my Seder. I left out the raspberry sauce and just sprinkled a little bit more powdered sugar on top. Also, used canola oil instead of Kosher margarine which seemed to make it less rich and much lighter but still very flavorful. An easy desert that can be made any time of the year!

This ia a wonderful recipe. It would be good at Passover and beyond. Everyone loved it. I would make this again in a heart beat. I didn't make a rasberry sauce this time. I make a mocha whipped cream and garnished the inside with Fresh rasberries.

I'm not Jewish, but made the recipe because it looked tasty and easy, and didn't require me to buy any new ingredients. It was a very big hit at my dinner party -- and I did get a few requests for the recipe. It makes TONS of sauce -- most of which didn't get used -- but I suppose you could freeze it.

Rating: 4
I LOVE this!!!! I first made this torte about three years ago and it has been requested every year since, and not only for Passover! People are usually shocked when I tell them it is a Passover dessert - I can't tell you how many people have requested the recipe. Although it looks beautiful to drizzle the raspberry sauce over the torte, I serve it in a creamer instead and allow my guests to serve themeselves. I also freeze unused sauce and use it the next time I make the torte.

Using Valronha or another fine bittersweet chocolate, this is an excellent recipe, but does require much less time in the oven -- perhaps 35-40 min.

Based on previous reviews, I thought it'd be a hit and not taste like a typical Passover dessert. But it was pretty blah! Wasn't worth the time or effort. More appreciated by my guests was a matzoh buttercrunch recipe, which you can find on the web.

This is a great passover recipe...easy to make and very good. I thought it would be really rich but it was not too sweet and very light. I used unsalted butter, powdered sugar, and decorated with fresh raspberries. WARNING - the cooking time indicated in the recipe is way too long. I cooked my torte 35-40 minutes.

Rating: 3
I have to admit that I didn't actually get to taste much of the torte; however, given the response of my guests, I think it deserves three forks. (And I must say the crumbs I managed to scrounge up were mighty tasty.) I'll definitely make this again -- and hope I get an actual piece next time! (By the way, I served with fresh strawberries and a strawberry sauce -- basically pureed strawberries with a bit of sugar -- since that was also served with my standard almond cake.) Also, not at all difficult to make (though most Passover desserts are not, in my opinion, particulary tricky.) Oh, and I also did use fairly expensive chocolate, which may have boosted the flavor.

Made this today and it was a huge hit. My Uncle said it was better than any he's ever had. I used Droste Bittersweet 72% cocoa butter chocolate. It was excellant, dense but light, moist with a bit of a crunchy crust. Will certainly make this again.

Rating: 3
I was skeptical about this just because of the minimalist ingredient list. However, you can't go wrong with lots of fat and sugar. Of course it was very tasty, but definetly not for a health nut. As a passover dessert, it went over really well and people didn't believe me that it was kosher for passover. They even said they would love it on non-passover meals.

We made this for our large family Seder and WOW! It went quicker than any other dessert serverd. It was so popular that we've been asked to make it next year already! We even made it a second time for the second Seder. I say, Try this one!!! Its easy to make and as long as you follow the directions, a guaranteed success!

WOW! I made this for seder last night and there was not even a crumb left. A 13 year old boy at the table put his hand over his heart and swooned. He was later observed licking the plate. The texture was fabulous and the taste absolutely heaven. This did not taste pesadick at all. I only used one package of raspberries for the sauce and sugar to taste and still had plenty of left overs. I did melt chocolate chips to use as a decoration and slice indication which made for a very attractive presentation. I put 3 raspberries on each slice for decoration and then sifted confectioner's sugar which I had run through the food processor over that. C'est magnifique and a repeat item for sure, even when its not Pesach!

I served this at last night's seder, it was a huge hit! This will permanently replace the Chocolate Fudge Torte. The raspberry sauce can easily be cut in 1/2. Many of my guests also ladled sauce on the Brandied Peach Compote Cake which looked great and tasted delicious.

This torte is fabulous, not too hard to make and tastes great. I love anything with raspberry and chocolate, so this caught my eye. It's not too sweet and not overly chocolatey. The raspberry sauce was a bit too sweet, so I'll use less sugar next time. The sauce recipe also makes about 3 times more sauce than I actually used. I was surprised at the very light texture, much ligher than other tortes I've tried. I made it for Passover last year and there were absolutely no left overs. My fiance who doesn't normally like dessert or chocolate has asked me to make it again this year. Last year I substituted butter, but plan to follow the recipe exactly this time. I'm sure it will be just as good. Even if you don't normally like dessert you should try this one.

This delicious recipe was the best I've ever done for Passover, and the most-eaten, too! No one said, "No Dessert for me". Everyone enjoyed it, even the finiky ones. We liked it so much at the seder I made it again later that week when we had young guests over! The torte itself was easy to make. I baked it over a pan of water. It cracked a little, but the crack becomes the bottom of the torte, so who cares? I used a commercial raspberry sauce (available locally for Passover), which made it easier as well as less expensive. I also used the recommendation on the sliver of chocolate inserted into each slice for 3-dimentional attraction. It looked spectacular, but make sure you allow the torte to cook thoroughly before inserting the sliver or you just have meltdown. Great recipe!

I made this torte for Passover this year, and I agree that this recipe would be great for anytime...not just Passover. In fact, at first my father wouldn't eat it cause he didn't believe it was a "Passover cake"--it was that good. I'd recommend following the torte recipe exactly, cause I did and it came out perfect (except I didn't use the raspberry sauce--just used fresh berries). It was moist and chocolatey, but not overly dense...just right. Don't be afraid to try the decoration with the doily--it's easy and it looks great (although next time I might try the suggestion about using unsweetened cocoa, for a subtle effect). Everyone raved over it and inisisted I make it every year for Passover. Plus, it kept for nearly two weeks wrapped loosely in tin foil (minus the raspberry sauce).

I made this torte for passover this year, when I was looking for any flourless chocolate cake recipe (my poor mom was asked not to make her "special" passover brownies this year - so someone had to come to the rescue!). I was pleased with the result, although the torte was a bit denser than I had been hoping. Still, this was a welcome change to our normal dry and crackly desserts and a fine addition to our staple matzo farfel cookies. The raspberry sauce was wonderful and even better with matzo and cream cheese the next morning!

This chocolate torte is light and almost spongy in texture, yet incredibly moist. It is not a very heavy chocolate dessert. It is not very chocolately either. Nevertheless, it makes a nice final course for the sedar -- when lighter fare is usually appreciated. I didn't use powdered sugar but unsweetened cocao as the last step. I also used less sugar in the raspberry sauce. One thing...could egg whites be considered a levening agent???

I made this recipe for our Passover seder. It was very very good and didn't at all taste like a Passover recipe! The only problem I had was the timing. I followed the recipe but I think it would be better leaving the torte a little undercooked. The cracking wasn't an issue when I inverted the torte but the dryer/crunchier part of the torte extended a good 2 inches towards the center. I think it would have been better if the dryer part was only the outside inch.

I've made this cake every year since it was originally printed in Bon Appetit. This has become a family favorite. Even the "foodies" ask for this one since it would be good even if it was not Passover.

This was a simple and yummie recipe, however the raspberry sauce was enough for 2-3 tortes! I will make sure to cut in half the next time I make it. I drizzled the sauce around the torte and over on individual plates, topped with a few fresh raspberries. It was very pleasing to the eye also!! Everyone at my dinner party raved over it! A sure keeper.

This recipe consistently turns out great. For presentation purposes and to add the illusion of height to the cake, I melt chocolate onto wax paper (creating a circle shape)and let harden. Once hard, I break into large pieces and place vertically coming out of the top of the cake; I then sprinkle with powdered sugar. I have also decorated with chocolate covered strawberries around the cake. Both make for a beautiful presentation.

Rating: 4
This was such a hit at my Seder that it has become a favorite dessert at any time. Because my springform pan is 9 3/4 in., I added an extra egg white and a tad more chocolate. I also used butter. Cracking has not been a problem. I think the quality of the chocolate is very important. I use Callebaut bittersweet, making the torte intensely chocolate-y.

delicious!! the cake falls a lot, but when you flip it over and press it down a bit, it looks great. I improvised a sauce, and put fresh raspberries around the plate. I would make it any time of the year!!

Despite the fact that I baked the torte too long (and it cracked), this was a big hit at my friend's Seder. I was able to hide the imperfections under the powdered sugar and raspberries used for decoration. :-) Even my finicky husband went back for seconds! I'll definitely make this again!

I thought this was going to be more like a traditionalm sponge cake texture, but what I got was much richer and and better than I expected. I don't understand why people are so concerned with the cracking - if you turn it upside down and sprinkle with sugar, it's a moot point. Everyone loved the recipe at our seder. I simply garnished it with fresh raspberries and it looked and tasted great.

Rating: 3
I, too, made this dessert for Passover. It was delicious, but I was disappointed in the appearance. I was glad that the recipe forewarned that it would fall and crack, but I was disappointed to the degree to which the center fell, causing the sides to be higher than the center when I inverted it on to my serving platter. Not a major problem, just not beautiful.

I have a friend who cannot tolerate wheat flour because he has celiac sprew. He said he has eaten many flourless cakes and this is the best . In addition, we all loved it. There were 14 of us and I have already emailed to my daughter-in-law, at my son's request. I made a snowflake stencil out of a sheet of paper and placed it on the cake and sprinkled powdered sugar on it--it was beautiful--didn't even need the sauce. Third time I made, won't be the last.

Nothing special about this cake-I've made other flourless cakes that were better than this one; the lemon-honey almond cake from the same issue was much tastier.
