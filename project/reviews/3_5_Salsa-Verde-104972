This was absolutely delicious and I think it probably is very forgiving. I served it with the roasted spring vegetables. My kitchen was chaotic with company when I finally got around to making this right before dinner. I didn't measure anything but the oil and I added extra of that. I couldn't find the lemons (found them this morning)so used limes and didn't bother with the peel. I used one generous bunch of parsley-didn't measure. The mustard is important as are the anchovies and capers. You could put this on anything and my guests did just that- they said it was really good on the grilled/smoked turkey we had. definitely a keeper.

This sauce, served at room temperature, was the perfect complement to my roasted leg of lamb last weekend. I added a few mint leaves to the parsely to add some punch. I also chopped everything finely with a chefs knife rather than puree it in a processor. I'd cut back on the lemon juice a little next time, and probably double the capers. I've also seen recipes that added gherkins or cornichons that I thought would be a nice addition.
