A good balance of cream and gelatin. Also pretty quick and easy!

Went strawberry picking and was looking for ways to use them up. I also just recently purchased ramekins, so I figured I'd give this a shot. It was restaurant quality delicious! My husband couldn't get enough...he wants to make strawberry picking and this dessert a Father's Day tradition. Very easy recipe, even for someone like me who is usually a baker. My only challenge, despite following all directions in the recipe, was getting the dessert out of the ramekins in 1 piece (fortunately we weren't having company, because they were not very pretty). But they tasted out of this world - fresh, light and sweet!

I have made this desert several times and have gotten great complements from all. This is now one of my sons favorite deserts.

Me again..reason: To tell you, after I posted my old April 2001 comments, I was sent an email from Dominion Republic, from a gal claiming they had the best Yogurt...yet, ASTRO is still selling well @ Sobeys.....It was fun to get the email..she wanted a contest...eb

I reviewed this recipe in April 2001, and gave my old email address. You can find it if you look over past reviews, but my new email address is: EleanorBridges@Hotmail.com The restaurant in Truro Nova Scotia still serves Strawberries Lucien, but it is now under new ownership, Howard Johnson..but they still have their famous Turkey Dinner Buffet every Friday lunch hour [$9.99]. What I did not say back then, but will say now, is I lost my home in Oxford, NS Sept. 23, 1999 [it is still standing, but town shut off sewer pumps and I was given the runaround by my insurance company...], and it was this recipe that made me smile again. I also had not been back to my recipe box since 2001, now it is 2006, and I am in Florida, trying to forget the entire Flood..., but, again, this recipe will put a smile on your face too. I am grateful for the recipe, since the restaurant would never develge their recipe.. [Epicurious kept my user id and recipe box all this time...and I have a new kickass lawyer going after my old insurance company too] Please enjoy this recipe as much as I have over the years!

To the cook from Raleigh: since when do we have cook in such a precise way ? Does it really matter if you don't have the exact amount of puree left at the end? I've made this recipe about 10 times, every spring I'm just dying for the strawberry season to begin in Spain to make it again & again. As far as not being a true Panna Cotta, that is true, but it's got it's advantages: it's light, doesn't make those Lactose intolerant suffers feel sick, and it does have flavour (make sure the strawberries are nice & ripe, usually better near the end of the season). As far as 1% fat milk is concerned we don't have that in Spain, so I just use any milk I happen to have in the fridge (usually semi-skimmed or low lactose) works just as well. All my friends love it and find it a nice change to the heavy Panna Cottas.

I adore panna cotta, but this particular recipe is not very good. One problem was that it is not very specific on certain instructions. It calls for 2 cups of strawberries in the beginning, but does not specify how much unseeded puree you are supposed to have in the end. The flavor is extremely mild. I made this for Easter and one person at the table thought it was wonderful and the other two thought it was just "ok". I would recommend trying one of the other panna cotta recipes on this site.

Very easy to make and looks impressive. The flavor is mild however, so though my boyfriend and I both really liked it my guest thought it was only ok. The strawberry-honey mixture is delicious.

This was quite good. To the reviewer who added low fat ingredients and then complained-- Why don't you try this recipe instead of your own invention. This did not taste like a jelled smoothie. Subtle stawberry flavor and not too sweet not too "jelly" slightly creamy. Refreshing summer dessert and the presentation is nice too!

June 17/00 This is a terrific recipe! It is served at the roast turkey buffet @ Keddy's, Truro, NS Canada, every Friday, noon. It is served in a chamgagne glass, and looks very attractive and exotic, but is called Strawberries Lucien. I have tried this recipe with two replacements [for the health conscious], those being: sour cream [low fat] or for the best ever--use low fat plain or french vanilla yogurt. Keddy's use sour cream in theirs; low fat or regular type unknown. An extra note: if you happen to be a yogurt connoisseur, then the best French Vanilla yogurt IN THE WORLD is sold in Ontario, Canada, specifically in the Greater Toronto area by a company called ASTRO; it's naturally made too and offers several types as well [no, I'm not a sales rep.] to choose from [eg. fruit on the bottom]. The one I use is called Astro Original French Vanilla, Balkan Style, and it's made with honey. Try it when in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. As well, my future daugher-in-law makes a great berry yogurt drink [replacing a milk shake] using said yogurt and boy, is it tasty! For Jaz's recipe, just email me. [She doesn't know she has offered the recipe as of yet.] [The yogurt is so good, I'd pass on a sweet and take it instead, unfortunately, I can only get it when I am in Toronto, but I bring back as much as I can carry on the plane.] Enjoy. EB Update: April 26, 2001, I have had so many requests for this recipe, that I have had to come back and print some out again, rather than to photocopy them, I thought I would check up on any new comments. My new email is eleanorbridges@Canada.com; Jaz has developed a few more health drinks so if anyone is interested in them, please email. As well, a large number of requests for her yogurt berry drink have been sent out, even as far away as, Dominican Republic. To Soroya, and the rest of the healthy eaters, Wheat Germ can be added to any yogurt; it's healthy and it tastes good too! [Sobey's now sells ASTRO in NS.] eb

I substituted low fat sour cream and did not like the results at all. Tasted like a jelled smoothie. No big deal.

I made this with just the strawberries in the Panna Cotta itself--and skipped the honey too. I'd never had this dessert before. Delicious!
