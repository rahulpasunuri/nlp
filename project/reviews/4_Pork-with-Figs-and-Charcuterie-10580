A waste of good salami. There are much better recipes out there. I am not sure what the the recipe creator had in mind, a combination of cornichons, fig, and salami is awful when cooked together. The roast pork part is good but choose other topping, no one like it at my party.

excellent recipe! very easy with an interesting flavor. followed almost exactly (without deglazing, and used 35 min in oven instead of thermometer, halved all ingredients for 1lb pork loin) and turned out perfect. served with sauteed kale, mashed potatoes, and red wine. will definitey make this again!

i don't know what possessed me to make this for a crowd of picky eaters. The whole time i was making it, I was concerned it would be a disaster. I certainly did not tell people ahead of time what was in this dish, because I can assure you, they wouldn't have touched it. Much to my suprise everyone liked it and most asked for seconds. Even the pickiest eater, the man who gets sweaty palms if he thinks there might be Dijon mustard in something he's eating, asked for seconds. I made it just as written and it was perfect. I did double the recipe, though, and ended up with 3 times more topping than I needed.

I found this recipe while looking for something new to do with a pork loin and fresh figs I had on hand. I appreciated the comments so much! It's a great dish--exciting, delicious, unusual--and yet so easy. I also deglazed, with chicken broth. I served it with sauteed rainbow chard with a little pomegranate molasses--went beautifully and looked lovely. Only caveat is that it is so distinctive I would only make it once a year or so.

Yes! Make this dish tonight! Simple, quick, incredible mix of flavors- odd, but wonderful. I served this with Mark Bittman's mashed potatoes and dandelion greens (see NYT) and was just blown away. Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed!

This was so very good. You must make this tonight. You will not be disappointed. I've had this recipe in my file for years and finally decided to make it. The ingredients seem strange but really pull together well. This is impressive enough for a dinner party but fast enough for a weeknight meal. I didn't need extra liquid either. My husband couldn't get enough.

I wonder why more people haven't made this--it's probably the name that's intimidating! I did not need to add any liquid to the topping other than pan juices (maybe the prior reviewers used dried figs rather than fresh)-- I also added more juices as they drained off the pork. I served with the celery root and apple puree from this site and steamed green beans tossed in butter, and a riesling. Very easy for the delicious result!

Perfect dinner party entree -- easy to prepare, beautiful presentation, stupendous taste. Agree with prior reviewer -- the figs, salami & cornichons mixture needs a liquid to help deglaze. I used some port wine I had on hand -- simply wonderful.

I made this with a 2lbs pork roast and it was yummy! I seared the roast in an oven-safe skillet and then put right into the oven. Recc. adding a splash or two of apple cider to help reduce smoking after searing. Also, added a couple more dashes of cider to pan when making topping as I didn't have that many juices with the roast and it helped deglaze the pan.

a fantastic fall meal, an addition of celery root puree is wonerful.
