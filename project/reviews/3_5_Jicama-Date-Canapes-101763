Followed recipe exactly and it was tasty, but "the judges" and I felt it needed a salty component to offset the extreme sweetness of the dates. Will make it again, but with either a bit of crumbled feta or minced green olive.

I really wanted to love this because I love all the ingredients, but it was really bad! The flavors just didn't seem to mesh and I ended up throwing the whole lot out to spare myself the embarrassment of serving them to my friends.

Very yummy and refreshing - was looking for something easy and healthy. The only addition I made was to add a pinch or two of salt (there is nothing better than the combo of salty, sweet and sour!)and a little of lime zest into the mix (all the liquid exploded out of my mini food processor when I mixed this up and I was afraid I lost a lot of the lime juice I added). Took to a church function and got rave reviews as well as a lot of question about what jicami is.

I was shocked by how many people raved about this -- even people who had never tried jicama. I needed more jicama than the recipe called for. Can't wait to make this again.

I have made this recipe for several parties at all times of year and it always gets raves.

Eventhough it's more of a summer recipe...made this for a Christmas Party appetizer. everybody loved it. Easy to prepare. I would not change anything.

Made for an outdoor cocktail party on a very warm summer's evening. Quite easy, refreshing, many interesting flavors from the lime juice and mint. Sort of sweet/sour. My only reservation is that it didn't go well with the crisp, herbaceous sauvignon blanc I served--and perhaps it would be difficult to pair with any wine--because it is a bit sweet. So, although I'm only giving it 2 forks (for that reason) I would make it again if serving a sweeter drink.

Yumm! So refreshing with the mint, and an unusual appetizer on a hot night. The lime juice was a really nice balance with the sweetness. Will definitely make this again!

I made this as an appetizer before a dinner party and it was a big hit. 3 people requested the recipe. I found it easier to mix in the lime juice in the food processor

I served this as an appetizer for a dinner party. We all thought it was OK, maybe a little too sweet. No one went back for more, unfortunately.

Very palate cleansing due to the mint. We served at a cocktail party and it was a hit (though some people were confused thinking the date mix was some sort of meat pate). Perfect for hot summer outdoor parties - light and refreshing

Made this for a going away party during Ramadan here in Saudi Arabia where dates are plentiful...rave reviews...will make again on the "other side".

This heart healthy recipe is easy to make, tasty, and even pretty. We were looking for something to make with dates that had been brought to us from Israel, and it was a very nice dish.

These were wonderful. I was suprised how much everyone in my group gobbled them up.

I made this for a vibrant fresh beginning to a Latin meal. For a really pretty presentation, buy the biggest and freshest dates you can find. Carefully pit them by slitting one side to remove the seed - then stuff them with the jicama mixture.
