This is my favourite recipe for lamb shanks. I've made it numerous times and I'm making it again for Easter. The sauce has such a good fresh flavour I save any extra and freeze it for later.

just made this last on the recommendation of someone else and it came out great. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of only using 1/2 bottle of wine and a little less stock than recommended to reduce the amount of liquid. after it was done, I reduced the remaining sauce for about 20 minutes (prob. could have done less). I strained out the vegetables and chilled it so I could skim off fat. I separately sauteed diced carrot, onion and celery -- plated with polenta, diced veggies, lamb shank on the bone and sauce over the top of it all. Looked gorgeous and was so easy highly recommend discarding overcooked veggies and making fresh ones to serve that still have some life to them when making stews braises -- it makes a world of difference!

Very good recipe- I liked a lot, the BF LOVED! I halved the recipe for two people, added a few potatoes and baby bellas, and a little cumin. Used a combo of sweeter and drier wines, only beef stock. Cooked as recommended, but needed to add some more liquid towards the end when reducing so added more beef stock and some port. Served over garlic rice and green beans, big hit, will definitely make again.

Just made this again for guests who couldn't stop raving. It is easy to make and good for doing a day ahead so you are not stuck in the kitchen and can enjoy your guests instead. Cooking a day ahead also allows the flavors to blend more. And you can skim off the fat more easily. I like more of the chunky stew taste, so did not puree. While it was a lot of sauce, serving over mashed potatoes was excellent to sop it up.

Great Recipe! I didn't use fresh Tyme or Rosemary. Served it with mashed potatos and I added extra fresh tomatos and extra carrots. I had way to much liquid left over. I ended up putting some of it in a food processor and then added to ground beef and made meat pies! Great!

This dish was so flavorful, tender and delicious. The receipe was simple and I felt like a 5 star chef serving this dish.

This was an excellent recipe. After reading the reviews, one cook stated it was a chunky uneven sauce. So I used my mini-processor to process the onion,garlic and carrots into a fine chop. This resulted in a thicker more finely even chunk sauce after reducing at the end. A key point is to use plenty of fresh rosemary and thyme in this dish. The result is wonderfully flavored dish with the tender meat practically falling off the bone. Both my husband and I thought this was a very tasty recipe. I definitely recommended it to everyone.

Four forks. It's a keeper. Used half bottle of wine for four shanks, three cloves of garlic (I mean, really, ten?), and got mixed up by the imperial system so ended up with a 400g can of tomatoes. Even with the smaller volume of liquid the sauce reduction took a while, but not a problem. Meat fell off the bone, lumpy veg sauce was perfect with buttery mash. The women at table expected there was too much meat, but they cleaned their plates. One good suggestion from a country girl was to scoop out the marrow and stir it in to the sauce. Lots of sauce left over. Next time I'll sieve it and add a knob of butter. Thanks for the recipe.

This was an incredible recipe. My husband raved that this was even better than the lamb shanks he had in Paris, of which he has spoken about for years. I did add garlic to the recipe, adding it in at the same time as the rosemary. The recipe had fantastic flavor and the meat feel off the bone. Do not miss the root veggy mash, it really compliments the dish. I highly recommend this dish to everyone, as does my husband.

OMG! This was a fantastic recipe. My husband rated it a 5, on a 1 to 4 scale. I made two small alterations to the recipe as written. First I added garlic to the mix. I added it with the rosemary. Secondly, I cooked the shanks for 2 hours covered, then uncovered and simmered 30minutes longer to thicken the sauce. The shanks were so tender the meat fell off the bone! The root veggie mash is a must to make with this recipe. I highly recommend this recipe to all. It is nothing short of fabulous!

Very good and very simple. Like other reviewers, I cut the amount of liquid by about a 1/3 and it was plenty. I also cooked it for about two hours which was enough. Will definitely make this again. I think it would work well with beef and even chicken (it's really a coq-au-vin sauce). Oh, and there is quite a bit of fat in the sauce once it's done simmering. I used one of those gravy fat separators and it worked very well to get rid of the fat prior to reducing the sauce.

I thought that this recipe was excellent. I would even be comfortable serving it to guests with something like a nice risotto. As others have said, it's rather ideal because all of the cooking can be completed before your guests arrive. I took some other reviewers' advice and made the dish the night before and then skimmed the fat off the top before reheating it and reducing the sauce. This made for an impressive 30 minute meal. While I was cooking it, I was trying to nap, so I kept hitting the snooze button and ended up cooking it for a little longer than 3 hours. I'd have to say that this was probably a little too long, as the meat was tender and falling off the bone by 2 1/2 hours. I think that the overcooking led to the lamb tasting a little less lamby (which may be why some reviewers said that the meat lacked flavor). The next time I make this, I'll keep a closer eye on it. Also, I forgot to add the red wine until at least half the cooking time was up, so I can't wait to try this again and make it properly. I disagree with the people who say that there is too much sauce in this recipe. With a lengthy reduction (like other people said), it turns into a beautiful velvety-rich sauce. I think the sauce may have been the best part, actually. I can't really understand why people had a hard time reducing their sauce. With high heat and no lid, isn't it almost physically impossible for the sauce to not reduce? I liked one person's idea of straining the sauce for a more elegant meal. If it's just a weeknight at home, though, I would certainly leave the veggies in. They're delicious and nutritious! Overall, I think that this is an incredibly easy yet impressive dish.

It turned out great after a lengthy reduction of the sauce. The reduction was absolutely necessary and created a rich, concentrated, flavorful sauce.

After the rave reviews this dish has received I was very disappointed! I followed the recipe ALMOST exactly, the store had no fresh thyme so I used dried, didn't have enough fresh grated lemon peel on hand so added some dried. But the amount of liquid would, as an earlier reviewer said, sink the Titanic. It hardly thickened at all, in spite of no lid on the dish. The lamb, though falling off the bone, had lost a lot of its flavor. I kept the remainder of the lamb, poured the excess sauce into a pan and thickened it up with cornstarch, added more rosemary and seasoning, now it looks and tastes MUCH better. MIGHT make it again, but with half (or less) the amount of liquid. 1 bottle of wine, two cans of stock and a 28 oz can of tomatoes with juices? Too much by far -half the quantity would have been much better.

Phenomenal. Made it with a simple risotto and served the lamb over it. The lamb flavor reallly permeates the whole dish and makes this a really great way to showcase lamb. We loved it. Didn't and wouldn't change a thing.

This is a weekend winter favorite of mine. I usually add another 1/2 hour onto the cooking time to further thicken the sauce. Garlic mash and greens are great along side. A definite keeper.

This is as good as everyone else has said. The secret to a thicker sauce is to cook it without the lid on the pot. The sauce is slightly thick and very tasty. I used 1/3 bottle red wine and followed the rest of the recipe exactly. Delicious!

Rating: 4
This is a classic. I have made this scores of times and never gotten less than fawning, near faint-inducing revues. For a more elegant version, right when you are supposed to partially uncover the pot and cook for 30 more minutes, try removing the shanks, straining the sauce, and skimming the fat. Then return the shanks and sauce to the pot and continue with the recipe. Whisk some butter into the sauce near the end. The sauce is velvety smooth and sublimely rich. Serve this with a wild mushroom risotto -- it could be my favorite meal ever!

Absolute awesome. All six guests adored this dish and meat fell off the bone. It really is delicious. Cooked it for half an hour the day before simmering on the hob and then the next cooked in very low oven 140c for three hours while we went to the pub and it was perfect. Will definately make again.

I skipped on the can of chicken broth; didn't seem to need that much liquid and added a touch of water instead. Instead of fresh herbs I used dried. But it was easy, and got great reviews from the guests! The meat was falling/had fallen off the bones. I'd floured my lamb before browning though and I think it made the sauce murky. Next time I might skip that.

I made this dish last night for my husband, I only made two 1.5 pd. shanks but made all of the sauce. it was delicious. However the sauce didn't thicken as needed, so I used a little corn starch and it came out perfectly. I would make this again, simple to do, and great flavors.

Very good recipe. Everyone loved it. Would definately make it again. I added a little cream and flour to thicken. GREAT!!

I made this dish on Sunday afternoon. I followed the recipe all the way through, with the exception of thyme, as the store I went to had ran out. The color of the sauce is a gorgeous dusky red-orange, the taste beautifully potent---if you like definite tastes. The meat was gently falling off the bone tender. As much as I thoroughly enjoyed this labor of love, I realized that I do not like to eat lamb. I suppose it is marvelous thing I chose the best lamb dish there is available to give myself a first real taste.

A friend made this for me and it was great, we really enjoyed the blend of flavors. Will make myself soon.

A wonderful, tasty dish that we loved. The sauce at the end becomes a dusky deep reddish brown, and is an excellent complement to the lamb. I used lamb chops instead of lamb shanks -- it worked out fine. I substituted Aramont classical beef demi-glace for the can of beef stock. It's pricey, but really worth it! I also reserved about 2/3 of the vegetables before reducing the sauce. I served it over pine nut couscous. Highly recommended.

Delicious. I didn't mind having a lot of liquid leftover since I made extra shanks. I will add tomato paste and the leftover lamb, shredded, to the sauce and will serve over pasta to make another meal. You can braise on a stovetop or in the over, it's the pot that counts.

Rating: 2
The recipe was OK, but have had better. Main complaint is with the author. Does anyone review these things. Braising is stewing in the oven, not on top of the stove, and the amount of liquids in the recipe would be enough to refloat the Titanic, despite author's introduction that braising (never, ever "a braise") requires less liquid than a stew. Heaven help us and save us from wanna-be cooks.

I was disappointed with this recipe especially after reading all the rave reviews. My sauce didn't thicken at all and I followed the recipe exactly. The taste was very good, but it definitely had to be thicker. I served it over polenta and it was just to runny.

This recipe was just delicious and perfect for a cold winter's day. I only used 1 tsp fresh lemon peel as a few reviews thought there was too much lemon in the recipe. Because of the football game that ran over, unexpected company, etc. I ended up simmering it for 4+ hours. The meat fell off of the bone when I took the shanks out so it was more like a stew but totally wonderful and actually made it a bit easier to eat without the bones.

This was really excellent! I added 1/2 chopped green pepper, and used organic, roasted tomatoes, which added a nice rich smoky flavour. Also added a tsp of mint. Did not need to use either of the broths, as there was plenty of liquid for three huge, meaty shanks (4 lbs). The sauce does not need additional thickening, other than cooking down, if the shanks are dredged in cornstarch or flour before browning. I used cornstarch and the sauce had a nice glossy sheen to it. It's a keeper!

Great taste, can be made that day or a day ahead, inexpensive and only one pot! What's not to like? I added celery to the mix, and chopped all ingredients very fine. Also substituted 2 Tbl. tomato paste for the whole can of tomatoes. Cooked at least two hours, and thickened the sauce at the end with a roux (butter and flour mixture). Finally, I agree with previous reviewers that this dish is incredible served over saffron risotto, and leftovers could simply be chopped up and made into a delicious pasta sauce. Veal or beef shanks, and even turkey legs, could be substituted. Stretching the possibilities a bit further, I'll bet you could dump arborrio rice, soaked white-beans, or even a small pasta right into the pot for the last half-hour of cooking and have your whole meal done.

We enjoyed this tasty dish, but we enjoyed it more the next day. When we served this the first evening, I guess the oven thermostat was understated, and the meat was on the bone and not tender. The following day for lunch after another half hour of cooking, the meat was tender and fell of the bone. By the next day, the seasonings were mixed well too.

This was my first attempt with lamb and I was very happy with the results. The sauce is very flavorful and the color is very apealing. There were only two of us so I cut back the recipe and still had left-overs. It tasted great two days later after reheating it on the stove.

This dish was so easy and yet it is impressive when served to guests. I also cut back on the amount of lamb but I did not cut back on the amount of sauce and it came out fine. I served it over rice and it was delicious. Only next time I might cut down a little on the amount of rosemary, I felt like it was a little over powering. This is great to make for guests because all the cooking is done before the guests arrive.

This dish is wonderful! I served it for New Year's Eve dinner and it was a hit. I made one small change in the recipe; I replaced the chicken & beef broths with a rich veal stock and used fresh, vine-ripened tomatoes. I served it with Risotto Milanese...Delicious!!!!

I have made this recipe many times infact I'm making it today to store for leftovers. It's always a hit our friends. It's so easy I have time to spend with my husband and guests. Serve it with the creamy baked polenta thats in the same issue and save even more time. If you have any leftovers serve them over pasta or rissoto.

I've never made lamb shanks before; this was delicious and quite easy! I halved the recipe, since it was for my husband and I only, and didn't use as much wine as the recipe called for.

This was outstanding! The lamb shanks I used were well over a pound each, so it required a good 3-3 1/2 hours to cook. As I only prepared four shanks, I had plenty of wonderful, rich sauce leftover which adorned homemade papardelle the next night.

This dish was wonderful...I can't wait to make it again. I used 2 cups of wine and let it cook for 3 hours. It's a perfect dish if you don't have time to spend in the kitchen. With 3 children, I put it together while they were napping and left it alone until dinner. Great for company too!

Very tasty. We've made it a few times and have been happy every time. Be sure to use good red wine (you shouldn't cook with something that you wouldn't drink), and if you have the ability to get or make good stock, it's well worth it. We served with mashed potatoes (garlic, herb,or whatever)...comfort food that sticks to your ribs!
