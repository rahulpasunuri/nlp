This soup could be a lot better with some modifications. I thought it was thin and kind of blah. Normally I add butternut squash which adds a nice texture and flavor. I had to add rice to this just to give it some body.

I made this soup tonight, its very easy but just a couple of tips, unless you really really like beans I would halve the amount suggested. I would also advise you to put the whole bunch of kale, I added about two thirds as the pan was full and the kale was covering the water, but it really does reduce and the soup is much better with the right amount of kale to balance it out.

Fabulous soup. Added some diced fire roasted tomatoes, and toasted orzo- just for a bit more body. The longer this sits, the better it is.

I recently made this recipe with a few alterations. I used 2 Italian pork sausages and 2 chicken herbed sausages, and only 1 can of navy beans. I also started out using a mire poix instead of just onions. I think soup tastes best when eaten at least a day after it is made so the flavors can meld. I also like to squeeze some lemon in as well. I think the acidity helps balance out the richness from the sausages and chicken broth. It turned out great and was super easy to make. I just made it last week and will probably make it again next week!

this is a good recipe, but there is some questionable grammar, which i interpreted to mean you add the sautéd onions & garlic to the broth. i did it in reverse, adding the broth to a pot with sautéd onions & garlic, used vegetable broth but doubled the sausage, added a drizzle of balsamic vinegar after turning the heat off, of and i really like it.
