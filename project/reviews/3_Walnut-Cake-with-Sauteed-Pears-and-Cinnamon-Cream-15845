Easy, delicious, no-fail dessert. I add spices to the cake, brandy to the pears. Cake freezes well - make two (or use half); next time you'll only have to make the toppings.

This cake is fairly easy to make. I did not make the pears though. The recipe does well with increasing the servings. I make two large cakes. I also added some spices, Cinnamon, Cloves, and Nutmeg. It came out tasty and tender. Nice to make for the fall season

This cake took a while to make, but it was well worth it! I wasn't sure how to serve it (recipe is incomplete) but I store it in the fridge separate from the cream, warm it in the microwave for a few seconds, then put the whipped cream on-- it is wonderful!
