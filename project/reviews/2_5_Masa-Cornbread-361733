This was a very flat dense cornbread. The flavor is good though. I made it to go with chili so it will work well but if you are looking for a cakey cornbread this isn't it.

Very good. Bake (or toast) masa for 7 mins only, otherwise could get a little too toasted or burnt. Cornbread was nice & moist.

This cornbread is really unusual and very tasty. I think what confused the reviewer was the term "bake" -- "toast" might be more accurate. Very nice flavor!

I really enjoyed the Masa Cornbread. It had a distinct nutty flavor and leaves a great taste in your mouth. I used the cornbread for the Masa Cornbread stuffing recipe which was a hit with my Thanksgiving guests who are not use to trying new things. If you are going to make the Masa Cornbread to be eaten alone, I would add maybe 1/3 cup more of buttermilk and a bit more sugar, obviously baking time would be slightly longer.

This recipe is unclear. Why would we have to bake the masa flour? Or did you mean for us to buy the pre-made dough? That doesn't make sense. Dear recipe writer, please make that clear!

To ChefMary: hard to help, because "awful" doesn't offer anything to go on. Did you follow the recipe? Was the masa rancid? Or any of the other ingredients? I haven't made this recipe, but it looks like it would yield a rather dry and not very sweet cornbread. And the masa might contribute a slightly bitter lime-y note, unless it was rancid and then it would have a strong bitter taste. I think this recipe would be great for the stuffing with chili peppers, though.

Made this last night for the cornbread stuffing with chiles. Followed recipe exactly. Tasted awful! Now afraid to make stuffing with it. Help!
