Great recipe. I'm not a huge fan of putting sugar in food (unless it's: 1) raw, 2) for baking), so I substituted the sugar for 2 tablespoons of honey. Turned out well... would reduce it to 1 tablespoon of honey next time.

We loved this recipe- it tastes very authentic! We didn't have access to the bean sauce, so substituted a little soy sauce to compensate for the missing saltiness. Delicious and definitely going into the regular rotation.

Delicious recipe but I add chili oil, a few drops of fish sauce and lots of panfried scallops.

This recipe is one of my all time favorites and has become a standard. I have made it with and without Thai yellow beans -- it is good both ways, but saltier with the beans. You can do just fine with a big skillet, no need for a wok. The trick is to not overcook the broccoli, so make sure everything else is finished (rice, whatever else you're making) and cook the broccoli just before serving for 3-4 minutes max.

Delicous and easy. My kids even liked it. I substitutes Thai yellow currry sauce since that was all I had on hand. I think this is a good base for anything.

Superb - I cut the recipe in half and it was a great side dish for dinner for two (with leftovers). I used fermented soybeans for the Thai yellow bean sauce and it added terrific flavor!
