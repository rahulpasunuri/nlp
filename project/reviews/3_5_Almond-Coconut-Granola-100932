I agree with the other reviewers, it is missing something...it needs more salt. I made it with 3tbls honey, 3tbls brown sugar, added a little vanilla and added a few extra tbls salted butter to the unsalted butter and a little extra kosher salt. No seeds and added raisins.

As written, the recipe is probably only three forks b/c it's a little lacking in flavor with just butter and honey. However, I doctored it up a bit, and I think my version is four forks worthy. I added 3/4 tsp cinnamon to the oat mixture and used 1 cup almonds and no seeds since I didn't have any on hand. I upped the honey to 7T and added a couple T of brown sugar to the honey butter mixture as it was heating. Removed the honey butter mixture from the heat and stirred in 1 tsp. vanilla extract. For fruit, I used a mixture of jumbo crimson raisins, dried cranberries, cherries and apples. Delicious! Really great on yogurt. What I like best about this recipe is that it's super fast and easy, and the granola stays a little soft and chewy, which gives it a satisfying bite.

I am addicted! This is the best granola I have tried-not too sweet. Great with vanilla yogurt.

Great stuff! I used a mixture of almonds and pinenuts-liked the unique taste of the pinenuts. This was great stuff, though I''m sure it's due to the butter-don't want to think about that.Euge

Great! I added vanilla extract to the butter/honey mixture, and used a mix of dried cranberry, cherry and blueberry. It tastes wonderful with yogurt.

This is excellent. I added coconut, almond and vanilla essence to the butter mixture. The aroma whilst making just filled the whole house. Its a must try.

Great recipe--great outlet to express your creativity! Added corn flakes, pumpkin pie spice (as an earlier reviewer suggested), and vanilla. It was very tasty. In another batch, used brown sugar and almond extract. Yummy! It does come out soft, so add a few minutes to the cooking time.

This is a great, base granola recipe. Feel free to play around with it with different types of nuts, fruits, really anything works. What makes this recipe particularly nice is it isn't too sweet which I find is the problem w/recipes using maple syrup instead of honey.

As written - 2.5 forks, nothing spectacular. It did come out of the oven soft, but crisped up as it cooled. I would have preferred this to be a lot chunkier and just slightly sweeter, even though I did use sweetened coconut. More fruit, more nuts, some spices/flavorings, etc. I prefer the Almond-Raisin Granola recipe on this site.

This was pretty good, but I thought it needed a little extra *something*, and I found that something to be 1/3 cup unsulphered Blackstrap Molasses. Added only a little more sweetness, but alot more flavor.

Outstanding! This is the best granola I have ever tasted. I did have to cook it longer to get the crunchiness. I made it for a breakfast meeting and I am still getting compliments and telephone calls about it days later. It's a must-try!

I've made this granola a number of times, and it is always easy and tasty. I've substituted other fruits for the cherries (as the cherries are quite expensive), but I think the versions with cherries are best. It always seems to take longer to cook than the recipe states, but it seems like my cookie sheets are a bit crowded. Perhaps they are too small.

Had I known granola was THIS easy to make and THIS delicious, I would have stopped spending outrageous amounts of money on junk. Now I know what is actually IN my granola, instead of hoping that fats/oils weren't hydrogenated, that dried fruits weren't sulphured, etc. The scent of this granola in the oven was heavenly. I will use this recipe over and over, playing with the ingredients. Three words: Pumpkin Pie Spice! Add about a half teaspoon, give or take. You'll love it!

Absolutely delicious and easy. The possibilities are endless with this recipe.

Delicious! I modified the recipe by using half cornflakes and half rolled oats;pecans instead of sunflower seeds; I added cinnamon and vanilla to the butter/honey mixture as suggested by other cooks; and stirred in dried cranberries after it cooled. I usually make a double batch, because it disappears so fast!

This granola is delicious! I can't stop making it-- in fact, I'm munching on some as I write this. I added about 1 tsp ground cinnamon to the dry ingredients and 1 tsp vanilla extract to the honey/butter mixture. I found that it required longer toasting than specified (somewhat ambiguously) in the recipe. I toast for 25 minutes, stirring every 8 minutes or so.

I have made this several times and it is terrific. I made a maple cranberry version with a little maple extract added to the butter. Use dried cranberries and pumpkins seeds. A little cinnamon is also good. There are so many possible variations.

This is delicious! Melt the butter and pour into 1/3 cup. That is the amount of honey you need. The honey just flows out. I changed sunflower seeds to walnuts and added 1 cup of 100% Natural cereal. This is really a treat.

This is extremely easy to make and I had to make a batch a week around the holidays. I served it for part of the breakfast on Christmas day and it was a hit! I used Craisins, slivered almonds and sweetened coconut for a good flavor combo. Served with yogurt, this is a great brunch item!

For the first time I've made my own granola, it's nice to have found such an easy and delicious recipe. It's also very flexible. I didn't have unsweetened coconut so I used sweetened, and it came out fine...of course, I have a sweet tooth. I took it with me on a camping trip, and it disappeared very quickly.

Excellent recipe, easy, and so versatile. I make it almost every week using rye, oat, and wheat flakes instead of just oat flakes, and I also substitute some puffed grains in for some of the flakes. It has just the right amount of sweetness. If it browns too fast for you, reduce the temperature to 300, cook about 20 minutes stirring at 8-10 minute intervals.

This is the best!! I just got back from a week long family reunion/vacation and thought I'd make a batch of this for our first breakfast. It was such a hit I had to make a new batch of it every other day just to keep up with the demand!! The one addition that I find makes a huge taste difference is to add 1/2 to 3/4 cup of broken (NOT finely chopped) pecans. We all agreed this added an amazingly wonderful taste! Experiment with different dried fruits.....the possibilities with this granola are endless! As another reader suggested, you must stir this granola often to have it brown evenly, and for best results use a rather large baking sheet so it can be spread into a fairly thin layer. This recipe is a definite winner, hands down!!

I've tried other recipes for granola, this one is not only good but incredibly easy. I add some wheat germ and bran flakes. Also used cashews instead of almonds and banana chips for the dried fruit. EXCELLENT!!

This is excellent! I have made it several times and I like buckwheat honey so I use 3T of that and 3T of clover honey. Also, I use slivered almonds (instead of the sliced) and 1 cup of wheat germ. Remember to stir this a couple times while baking because it does have a tendency to brown easily.

This is the best granola my family has ever eaten. I now make it every week, and try different nuts or fruits. It is not very sweet, really healthy and incredibly high in fiber- enjoy!

I am going to try making this again in 2 jellyroll pans. It came out pretty well, but I had too much on one pan and some of it didn't brown as much as I'd like. I added cherries, dates and apricots and the tang of the cherries is especially nice.
