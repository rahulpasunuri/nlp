Fish was great. I agree with the reviewer who said it was bitter. I think it was too much lemon rind. I would make this again with some lemon zest and juice and skip the sliced lemons. Besides, the sliced lemons had to be picked out while eating anyway.

Delightful. Cooking the fish in the liquid helped make the fish very moist and the cooking time were perfect. This may be obvious, but I'd serve without the lemon pieces - I was picking around them all meal. I disagree with other reviewers and do not think it was too bitter. The onions, peppers, olives, lemons, wine etc - everything worked well together. Only change - I may slice the onions & peppers a little thicker (I took the thin slicing instruction to a new extreme).

If you use 5-6 ounce portions of fish and half the oil, this recipe is just as delicious but much healthier - this calls for enormous servings and way too much oil.

An excellent quick dinner recipe. I substituted half a lime for one of the lemons and used a riesling wine rather than something really dry. Result-an excellent balance of flavors. I'll make this one again.

I used preserved lemons from a Middle Eastern store, and the dish turned out to be delicious! Since people seem to be having problems with bitterness, I would recommend the preserved lemons.

Really diffrent and delightful, I only added one lemon which cut down on the bitterness issue. It was great!

I have to say it turned out bitter for me too but I don't think it was the lemons. Maybe it was the olives I used? Anyway, if I could rectify the bitterness it would be a great recipe. The fish by itself turned out great but most everything else was bitter.

Easy. Delicious. Lots of flavor, and not your everyday herb and butter sauce.

I felt the sliced lemon add too much of a bitter aspect. If I made this again I would just add the juice. Otherwise I'll stick to my Puttanesca sauce for fish.

Delightful, the olives offset the fish wonderfully. There was a lot of rich flavor and it is so easy to make!

Very good. I had no wine, so substituted vegetable broth. Slice the lemons very, very thin. Will try again with wine. Excess broth was good on white rice.

THIS IS FANTASTIC!!! I made with Sea Bass instead of Halibut. Very easy for a weeknight dinner. A real winner!
