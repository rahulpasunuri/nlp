Based on the ingredients, I didn't think this sandwich could be anything but delicious. It was, however, utterly forgettable. Not bad, just not worth making again.

I agree with Colorado. I came on here to find some fun finger sandwiches for a Baby Shower Tea Party I'm throwing and 2 of the 3 sandwiches listed by Kimberly can't be eaten by pregnant women. She should do her research better.

Although this sounds like a great party dish, it is not a good option for a baby shower since moms-to-be can't eat deli meat or unpasteurized cheeses like brie.
