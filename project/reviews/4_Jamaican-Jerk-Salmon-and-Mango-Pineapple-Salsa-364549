Great recipe but must add lots of lime in salsa as well as chopped serrano or jalapeno.Great with Mahi Mahi or Artic Char.

Absolutely loved it... such fresh flavors to go with the rub. Maybe more heat and yes to the idea of lime. I only had garbanzo beans which seemed perfect.

Great!!! All our dinner guests love it. No leftovers.

To me this recipe was just screaming for heat. Making it again I would definitely add jalapeño to the salsa and more cayenne to the rub.

This was fantastic and so quick and easy to make! I added avocado and a squeeze of lime as others suggested, but a squeeze of orange would probably be good too. The salsa would probably be fine with less salt, but otherwise, no changes - we'll definitely be having this again soon.

This was absolutely delicious. I made this on a rainy, gray day and the sweet/tart pineapple and mango were just the right thing to brighten the day. I added an avocado, a star fruit and some fresh lime juice to the salsa. I prepared the fish with the spice mixture exactly as the recipe instructs. I used a cast iron pan, started the fish on the stove top to crisp the skin, and then threw the pan into a 450 oven until the fish was cooked to our liking. Served over jasmine rice. A definite make again and just as suitable for a weeknight as for a casual dinner party. If I made this for a dinner party, I can imagine some sorbet for dessert to keep with the light feel of the meal.

I found this recipe to be very bland, I am glad I tested it out before my dinner party I will not be making it again.

Excellent dish! I made this using halibut because I prefer it over salmon, but I think the seasoning would go great on any fish. I added 1 tbsn of olive oil to the spices and rubbed it over the fish, then baked instead of frying. The salsa is delicious and balances out the "spicy" jerk flavors so well! I nixed the beans from the salsa because I served the fish w/ a side of quinoa and black beans.

Great dry rub flavors for salmon. Salsa was pretty good also, but would decrease onion. Great alternative when salmon is plentiful!

We made this last night and loved it. Only changes/suggestions - I used fresh thyme and would add a bit more cayenne next time! Perfect for the summer.

i loved this on the grill, i tried the avacado as others suggested (can't be too ripe, the texture was better when it was firm/added a rich creaminess), better with fresh pineapple/used canned beans. i will make for company this summer. very light. thank you!

**Correction to previous review, I used 1 mango rather than 2.**

Delicious and easy meal. I used 2 mango instead of 2 and I broiled the salmon instead of frying it for a similar amount of time as called for in the recipe. Great week night meal for the spring/summer.

This recipe is great as is! Healthy and very easy to make. Next time I would add avocado and jalepeno to the salsa. I added extra lime juice also.

i loved this dish! it's extremely easy to make, had the meal on the table in less than 30 mins. instead of using whole pineapple, i bought canned, drained and rinsed it (same as the beans) and used about half of the can and found the resulting salsa delicious! even served it to my 3 year old and he loved it too!

This was really good! I usually roast salmon but found this style kept it moist and delicious with very little additional fat. Leaving the skin on is important, though. The salsa complimented the jerk flavors. I did add a bit of lime to the salsa. If I make it again I'd probably add jalapeno for heat. Avocado would also be good. But is tasty as is. Served with brown rice.

This recipe is fabulous, fresh and easy. I made it for a dinner party, and everyone really liked it. I only had frozen salmon fillets without the skin, but I made sure not to overcook the fish and it turned out moist. I only used one mango, and it was more than enough. I had a lot of extra salsa left over.
