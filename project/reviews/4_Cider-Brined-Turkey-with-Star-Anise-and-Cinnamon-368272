We have been brining turkeys for years and this is by far the best turkey we have ever eaten. We won't be shopping around for a brine any more because this is the only one we will ever use. I crushed the anise and cinnamon, used Trader Joe's spiced cider, and fresh mushrooms. I mixed the brine ingredients in a 5 gallon pail with enough warm water to cover the turkey. And I put the turkey in it, covered, over night in our garage (cool enough to prevent bacterial growth). To roast, I put the bird roasting pan and placed in a 500 degree oven for 30 minutes uncovered, breast up. Reduce the heat to 350 deg and cover, roasting until the probe thermometer read 162 degrees on the breast. (Compliments to Alton Brown for this technique). Best. Turkey. Ever.

I got a lot of compliments when I made this turkey for Thanksgiving last year. It came out picture perfect. I used the convection setting on my oven and the turkey was wonderful. I left out the mushrooms because I have an allergy and it still had wonderful flavor. Looking forward to making this turkey again.

This had to be the BEST Turkey we have ever made. Just did a Turkey Breast and cut the brine in half. The turkey was unbelievably moist and flavorful. The Shitake Mushrooms lent a subtle smoky flavor and the star anise also added some unique flavors. This is the only recipe we will use from now on.

OK. It looks like I have to eat crow for Christmas before I get to eat turkey. I just ran out and bought a 16-quart stock pot. It is somewhat larger in diameter and slightly taller than the one I regularly use, but it is not nearly as large as I expected. Since nobody else complained that the pot size was too small for a 14lb turkey and the brine. I assume it will work. It also appears that it will fit in my second refrigerator with no trouble. So ... if you haven't read it already, please ignored my previous review. Happy Holidays :)

I am dismayed to realize that, after having purchased all of the ingredients, I had not read the recipe carefully enough. I am not sure if I will even be able to make this now. I find it hard to believe that the people who raved about this recipe not only have a pot large enough to hold the turkey PLUS all that brine, but also have a refrigerator large enough to place the pot in overnight.

Hands-down best turkey EVER. I'm not going to try anything else, EVER. This is it. We deep-fried the turkey and this brine made it out of this world.

The best brine I've made yet. Smoked a deconstructed 20lb turkey over apple chips. The family couldn't get enough. Great brine for chicken and pork too!

I used this brine for a twenty pound turkey, then smoked it with apple wood chips. It was absolutely wonderful.

Great recipe! I swapped Chinese Five Spice for the cinnamon sticks and star anise, and used fresh instead of dried mushrooms. Very moist! I also added some five spice to the gravy, which had a wonderfully subtle apple flavor to it. This was a hit with everyone!

QUESTION for all you experienced chefs out there: How would the recipe change if we used fresh, rather than dried, shiitakes? Is that a terrible idea? Are there adjustments we should make? Thanks so much, and happy Thanksgiving!

Great recipe. This made the best gravy and most juicy turkey I've cooked in 25 years. I used Trader Joe's Spiced Cider, skipped the cinnamon stick, but added everything else except shitake mushrooms. I stuffed the turkey and cooked it in a cooking bag.

I wrote Bon Appetit and never heard back as I made plans to make this turkey for Thanksgiving. The day is nearing, luckily I found it elsewhere online. I found the full recipe here: http://www.bonappetit.com/recipes/2011/11/cider-brined-turkey-with-star-anise-and-cinnamon Odd this could be considered top rated and the full recipe isn't even available. Crossing fingers at this point, wish me luck on Thursday!

Tis a pity "apple cider" refers to two different liquids. Both pasteurized apple JUICE and apple wine are called cider. Since I have been fermenting apple juice into the hard stuff for several years, cider means only one thing to me. What does it mean in this recipe.

I like the ingredients and would like to try this. Anyone know the proper list including what's missing from this recipe? Thanks

Couldn't wait until Thanksgiving to try this, so subbed chicken for turkey and cut recipe in half. Easy brine to bring together, but we felt it was a waste of cider! Major flavors coming through were soy, star anise and ginger - which, don't get me wrong were delicious! Just missing some of the apple flavor. Maybe next time will try deglazing the roasting pan with calvados to up the apple flavor? Also, be mindful of the bird while it's in the oven - will need some basting during cooking, otherwise you'll end up with uneven browning.

Looks good, but you left out ingredients in your recipe on the web site... like the turkey, cilantro and apples. Good thing I subscribe to your magazine.

I liked the white meat. It was juicy and flavorful so I can see using this recipe for chicken or pork. It also made great soup afterwards. I didn't like the flavor the brine gave the dark meat, which is my favorite meat. The gravy was lousy and the apples simply became mush from the long cooking time. Skip them and roast the turkey on a rack. Make a pan gravy from the drippings. I will make a more flavorful herb roasted bird for Thanksgiving.

Just an observation: Rather than dissolve the salt and sugar in 2 quarts of liquid, I usually use just enough liquid to dissolve and add the rest of the brining liquid when the first bit's cooled. It takes much less time to cool the liquid to room temp. I pound the star anise pods and cinnamon sticks with a hammer in folded brown paper, too, to release more flavor.

Not only was the turkey omitted from the ingredients list as Urbancleaver pointed out, the apples that are to be scattered around don't show up until you're doing the prep for cooking. So, how many apples are they talking about?

Has anyone tried to make this as instructed? Cooking a 14# bird for 2.5 hours seems too short. Was this a typo or is it really going to be cooked in that time? Thanks

I love that the ingredient list completely forgets the turkey. I mean I suppose one really doesn't need it with a title like "Cider Brined Turkey..." It sort of goes without saying that there is fowl involved here. Just sayin'

I tested this recipe on a whole chicken to see if I would like it before going all out for a T-day feast with an actual turkey. I must say that it is the most delicious and moist chicken that I can ever recall roasting myself. I haven't had much success with using a brine that I actually liked in the past, but the apple cider, star anise and cinnamon just sounded so good -- and it is! I'll definitely be making this again whether it be turkey or chicken.
