I found this to be delicious! I didn't put in the breadcrumbs and sprinkled cheese on top. It would have been just as good without the chicken.

I tweaked this recipe in similar ways to others, and was very pleased with it. I sauteed the dandelion greens with a chopped onion rather than boiling them, and added 2 Tbsp of parmesan to the filling. Cut the breadcrumbs to 1/4 c and added 2 Tbsp parmesan to that as well. The binding sauce makes the whole thing very rich in a good way, but I will probably try it with something a bit lighter next time, or a combo of cream and something lighter.

Good comfort food but not too heavy, mild but not bland. I use plain dried breadcrumbs. I make it with Swiss chard, I'd be afraid that dandelion greens would be too bitter.

3.5 forks as written, 4 forks with modifications. I have intentionally left out official fork ratings as I made modifications and know how annoying it is to purists (like myself) who dislike people drastically changing a recipe and then giving it a rating. Looking over this recipe, and reading some of the reviews gave me the impression that this recipe, as written, could perhaps use a little flavor boost. To that end, these are the changes I made: 1. Sautéed chopped chard in 1T. olive oil along with half of a chopped onion and 2 cloves of garlic (didn't need to squeeze chard afterwards). 2. Added about 1/3c. grated gruyére to the cream sauce along with about 1/2tsp each, chopped fresh oregano and thyme. 3. Used fresh homemade breadcrumbs and topped with another 1/4c. grated gruyére before baking. I didn't have cream on hand, so I substituted with a mixture of 2 parts milk to 1 part melted unsalted butter. Worked like a charm. Lastly, I had some chives growing haywire in the garden, so I gave them a trim and sprinkled as a garnish when it came out of the oven. The end result was delicious and, in my opinion, a nicely "amped up" version that still pays respect to the original. Will be making again and will continue making the same modifications.

Good! I doubled the chicken - I'm not sure it would've been enough for four people if I'd used the original amount.

Substituted turkey kielbasa for chicken. Used regular dry breadcrumbs instead of fresh -- 3/4 cup seemed like too much, will probably reduce next time. Mixed in olive oil to breadcrumbs prior to spreading over mixture rather than just drizzling over. Tasty & good use of dandelion greens, but not very moist when leftovers are re-heated - may opt to squeeze less liquid out of greens next time. Seems to yield more than just 4 servings.

I really like this and will make it again. I will use chicken thighs in the future and possibly more kale, chard, etc. I didn't have any milk or cream, so I used sour cream whisked with chicken broth as a substitute. I was going to great some Gruyere on top...I forgot, but I will do that next time.

We thought this was good, not great. I intended to add sliced roasted red peppers, but forgot I was out of them. I think they would be a good addition, along with the mushrooms and parmesan mentioned by Santa Fe. I did add chopped artichoke hearts (canned in brine), which I think helped. I just felt like it needed something else. (I used dandelion greens and boneless skinless chicken thighs.) I may try it again, but would definitely try to jazz it up a bit.

This was a lovely and easy dish to make. I used dandelion greens and chicken thighs, as I was afraid breasts would dry out. For having so few ingredients, this is surprisingly flavorful, and is totally comforting. I will definitely make it again with various assortments of greens (though dandelion was awfully good)

Very easy to make and good use of spring greens although I just realised I had pack choy at the last minute but it was delicious! I didn't have butter so used olive oil and also subbed double cream for whipping cream. I prob put more nutmeg in but then again I love it so no harm done. All in all great!

Made with mustard greens and kale. Forgot to make the breadcrumbs, so I just grated Parmesan on top. It was fantastic!

This was surprisingly good for such ordinary ingredients. I added some Chinese dry mushrooms, which I sauteed after soaking for an hour. Sauteed the chopped Swiss chard in the same pan. After mixing the mushrooms and chard in a bowl, I browned the chicken in the same pan, removed it and made the sauce. I, too, sprinkled parmesan on top, which is maybe why it tasted so good.

I made this recipe for Easter brunch, and everyone enjoyed it. I used turnip greens. I thought it might benefit from a small amount of salt. The nutmeg was a nice addition. I might try to lighten it next time by using half and half instead of cream. Also. I do not feel I need the second Tbsp of butter. I might try to make it with cooked flaked white fish next time. A vegetarian version might be good as well. I will definitely make this again and continue to experiment with it.

This recipe was very easy to make. I followed the recipe as written and used Swiss chard. Next time I think I might add sliced mushrooms and maybe some parmesan or swiss cheese. It kind had a crustless quiche feel to it.
