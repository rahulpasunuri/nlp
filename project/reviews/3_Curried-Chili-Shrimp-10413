Would've given this 4 forks except for the inaccurate measurements: how much is 2 shallots? A small onion? I guess in 1990 unsweetened coconut milk was unavailable in local markets but it's readily available now and purchasing it is much much less time consuming than the dog & pony show you have to go through with a fresh coconut. For less time & money Goya makes a great product for $1.29. Whole Foods Market, however, sells the perfect thick cocount milk (organic too) under their own label. That said, the recipe is excellent, and, with some ingenuity, cubed chicken meat can be substituted for the shrimp with cooking time adjusted accordingly. Cooking rice the way you normally would and adding scallions according to the directions in the accompanying scallion rice recipe is the perfect foil (we use brown jasmine rice). The key is good- quality fresh curry powder--Sun Brand Madras is what I use. The Brits like Sharwoods but I can't seem to find that here in New England. Also, I used a whole fresh jalapeno (about 3" long) with a few seeds and a little rib material which provided moderate heat. Since 1990 a staple in our house.

I've been making this dish since the original magazine came out and it's always a hit. I use canned unsweetened coconut milk and chili paste (samal oelek) from the jar.

I made this with Tilapia and it came out well.

This was OK to good. The paste tasted delicious before it was cooked, then I thought it lost something.

This was a VERY good curry dish. Thought it was just a bit heavy on the ginger though... will cut back just a tad next time. Jalapeno added just the right amount of heat. Served over basmati rice w/ scallions. Also added finely diced swweet red pepper with the onion, for color and texture. Was wonderful.

This is the first recipe I ever made from Gourmet.Now it is a staple.Instead of using a fresh coconut,I stuck with the old standard unsweetened kind in a can,easier and you are not wrestling with the coconut. Also, substituted jar chilies and they work well.Everyone raves aver this shrimp recipe.
