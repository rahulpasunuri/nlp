It was acceptable, the family liked the taste, but there was really nothing special about this recipe. I didn't find it lighter than any other recipe I've tried. I was also disappointed with the crust; it turned out soggy, possibly from the water bath. I'm going to stick with the recipe that comes on the cream cheese package.

This cheesecake is amazing. It is a lot lighter than you would think with these ingredients.

I've made this cheesecake 7-8 times over the past 8 years and it never disappoints; everyone raves and asks to take leftovers home. After the cheesecake slightly cools off, I spread a very thin layer of sour cream over the top to make it prettier (covers up any cracks and/or uneven browning). I use the topping recipe suggested by a previous reviewer (Saugus, MI on 8/14/00); using fresh strawberries and blueberries, served on the side. Fantastic recipe!

I'm going against the grain on this one. While this is a good cheesecake, it's not the cheesecake I'm looking for. It is light, but in my mind that translates to too eggy/custardy. I want something creamie and rich. I'm going to try the original recipe from phili cream cheese. The ratio of egg to cheese seems like it might be a better choice.

Outstanding cheesecake recipe - very creamy and light. My Thanksgiving guests loved it! I used the blueberry/cornstarch/sugar recipe suggested so that guests could add their own topping if they wanted it.

I have made this cheesecake several times now and have received absolute raves from everyone i make eat it. lol. it's a creamy cheesecake (which i love) and is lighter in texture then the usual dense NY style! the only thing that i have changed is the toppings...if i do want to have a blueberry topping i use the given amount of blueberries with the 1/3 c all fruit spread. i put all of this in a saucepan until blueberries are glazed and add about a spoonful of cornstarch a dash of cinnamon and a squeeze of fresh orange juice....put it all on top of the cake (still in spring form pan), cover and refrigerate overnight...and the results are amazing. Ive also used this cheesecake and swirled in homemade lemon curd (also very very yummy). either way this cake is awesome and everyone loves it :)

I cannot tell you how many times I've made this cheesecake! I have demands, YES demands, to make this for every family function and always for my sister-in-law's birthday. I always make it a turtle cheesecake, topping it with chocolate, caramel, and nuts (usually almonds). Also, adding some finely chopped nuts (walnut, pecans or almonds) to the crust is excellant! I have my cheesecake in the oven right now for a bookclub meeting. I know they willl love it!

I made this for a friend's birthday with a little trepidation because I don't like cheescake, which makes it hard to evaluate my work. An hour after I dropped it off at her house she called to tell me that it was "seriously the best cheesecake" she and her boyfriend had ever eaten. Like many others, I substituted the reviewer- suggested blueberry/sugar/cornstarch sauce and it was perfect. I'm making it next week for another friend!

I made this cheesecake for Easter Sunday and it was gone in less than 10 minutes with the last piece having to be split 3 ways. I also used the blueberry/cornstarch/sugar topping and the lemon curd mentioned by previous reviewers. My first cheesecake and it was a breeze! I'll definitely make this again.

I just made this cheesecake for the second time and it is virtually fool- proof. I doubled the blueberry, cornstarch, sugar recipe from a previous reviewer and it turned out fantastic.

I made the cheesecake featured in this recipe with the blueberry topping recommended by a previous reviewer. I added lemon curd using the recipe and technique from the 'lemon curd marbled cheesecake' recipe, also found on epicurious. The cake was fantastic, and the lemon curd was a nice complement to the blueberry topping.

Rating: 4
Oh my god. This is AMAZING. It's so light and fluffy and moist, not like the dense bricks you get at most restaurants. I used frozen wild blueberries with the juice and added a teaspoon of corn starch to make the topping, but essentially it was the same. The large roasting pan with 1" of water is a must if you don't want it to crack, but either way it's a spectacular cheesecake.

I am a pretty good cook but not a fabulous baker but this cheesecake turned out perfectly!! It was a very simple recipe for novice bakers. I followed the recipe exactly as written and it turned out creamy and delicious. I used fresh blueberries and the topping looked beautiful when done, glazed plump blueberries! I piped whipped cream around the outside edges to finish it before serving. Rave reviews from guests. My husband couldn't believe that I made it because it looked picture perfect, like something you would buy an upscale bakery. I will absolutely make this cheesecake again.

this is fantastic! hands down the very best cheesecake. no cracking, no misshaps, just creamy rich good taste and looks. i only changed a couple of things: substituted the sour cream for really-heavy-organic-cream and omitted the milk. i also follwed the blueberry topping suggested by the previous '00 reviewer (my hat's off to you). my inlaw's couldn't stop raving about it; and for me that's golden! they are a tough crowd to please ;)

I have made this cake for the last few Shavuot's. It is gorgeous, looks totally professional and melts in your mouth. The FRESH blueberries are important because they add a lightness and crispiness to the cake. Everyone comments on the beauty of the cake and then rolls their eyes at the taste.

This cheesecake recipe was okay for a basic cheesecake recipe. Used the blueberry compote recipe listed below in the reviews. Recipe tasted good, but it wasn't as creamy as other cheesecake recipes from this site. I prefer the maple cheesecake recipe.

Rating: 4
This recipe has received such glowing reviews there isn't really much more to say. But, for the adventurous spirit, I'd thought I'd offer a few twists I used this Thanksgiving. Instead of the traditional honey graham crackers, I used the chocolate flavored graham crackers---very good and they did not detract from the luscious flavor of the "cheese cake." As recommended, I used the blueberry sauce suggested by the cook from MA on 8/14/00--only I didn't put the topping on the cake. It was much easier to transport the cake with the topping in a container. This turned out to be a good thing, since some at the dinner wanted their cake "naked"--go figure!

Rating: 4
Excellent! One of the most reliable cheesecake recipes I have ever tried. I used a 10 inch pan, and it was still too much filling. I also pureed 1 cup fresh blueberries and swirled it through the filling after I poured it in the crust. This came out perfectly and got rave reviews from my hard to please family! Per other reviews, I used the reviewer from MA's recipe for the blueberry sauce. This is an outstanding cheesecake recipe.

Rating: 4
This recipe is SO good that I'm now making it for a local restaurant to rave reviews. Use a 9-inch springform so the cake comes out higher (batter fills to the top but does not overflow) and use a reader's suggestion for topping by heating fresh blueberries, sugar and cornstarch. Looks like it came right out of a bakery. If anyone knows of another cheesecake recipe that's equally light, please respond!

The vanilla base for this cheesecake is incredible and would probably be great even without the fruit. Cream cheese is hard to find here so I used mascarpone and added a tablespoon of corn starch to make sure it set. And no fresh berries this time of year. I used frozen Serbian wild blueberries and rasperries for the filling and skipped the berry part of the topping. The sour cream layer on top was excellent though. Cooked it in a bain marie and extended cooking time to compensate. It turned out great, but I think it really needs the fresh berries on top.

oh.my.God. This is the absolute best cheesecake I've had in my entire life. Made it for some french friends and was worried a cheesecake wouldn't go down so well with them, but they completely gobbled it up. Even my picky french mother-in-law (whom I couldn't resist sending a piece of cheesecake to with the hubby) called me up to shower praises. Only downside is that it was pricey to make. (Cream cheese here sells at 4.50Euros, and the graham crackers alone were at 7.50Euros!) But I admit that those 30 bucks were well spent! And I won't hesitate to make this again soon. Oh and I too used the blueberry recipe from MA cook in 8-14-00. Nice and easy and tasty, and I'll definitely use it again with different berries.

Everyone loved this cheesecake at a recent potluck. And, it looked fabulous! I agree that it doesn't need the full 60 minutes. I tried it with blackberries instead of blueberries. I also used the berry, water, sugar, and cornstarch idea mentioned by another reviewer for the spread. I couldn't have asked for it to turn out any better. Delicious!

Fabulous, tall, creamy, delicious cheesecake devoured by all. Made the blueberry topping provided by the MA cook 8-14-00 and it was excellent! I needed to make another half recipe of crust to have enough for the sides, but other than that the recipe was very reliable and versitile. This will work with a variety of crusts and toppings and is my new favorite "classic" cheesecake filling.

This is a wonderful recipe for using fresh blueberries(here in Alabama our bushes are loaded with big juicy sweet berries). I've made this cheesecake twice and everyone has raved about it. I substituted a vanilla wafer crust, and covered the top of the cake with blueberries. I cooked berries with a little sugar and water to make a glaze. It made a very pretty and delicious summer dessert.

I first made this cheesecake the month it came out in the magazine. I make it several times a year for birthdays, for company or when I need to take a dessert to dinner. I have been told more than once that it is the BEST(!) cheesecake ever. I use it as a yardstick to judge all other cheesecakes I have tasted and few even come close! The topping, of course, can be changed for the season. I highly recommend it!

Great cheesecake recipe, however I don't like typical graham cracker crusts. So, I made a macadamia nut crust and it turned out great. 3 1/2 ounces of nuts, crushed (a coffee grinder works great for this), 1 cup of flour, 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/2 butter softened. Mix well and press into bottom of 10-inch springform pan. Bake at 400 degrees 12-14 mins. Cool and then use this wonderful recipe for the cheesecake! Delicious! Serve with a lemon sorbet. Mmmm.

This was a great reliable recipe for cheesecake. The topping was restaurant-style and had beautiful presentation. Next time I will have to be more careful w/ the water around the pan, as it soaked through to the crust. Otherwise, delicious!

Recipe comes together very easily, and it bakes up beautifully. No problem with cracking, even though I put it into the fridge while it was still hot. Added some cinnamon to the crust, which was a nice complement to the berries. Superior cheesecake appearance and texture - the fruit really makes the flavor of the cake explode.

I have made NY style cheesecakes for years but this is a great reliable recipe and am glad to find it.( Seem to lose track of my writeen recipe) Agreed any fresh fruit is a hit but also for occasions try using crystalized rose petals and violets or edible flowers for you will be surprised how people will ask for this as their wedding cake! Hey give a try adding a touch of sage to blueberries too it is truly unique with unami. This now will be my old reliable,Also for extra heft when using peaches or raspberries add a touch of honey and buttermilk to the filling as well. Let the secret touches begin. love epicurious site!

Rating: 3
Easy to make for such a great recipe, and always turned out beautifully. However, I added an extra 1/4 c. of sugar to the filling, with 4 pkgs of creamcheese and 16oz of sourcream, you need a little more sugar than the recipe called for. You will definitely have left over filling if bake in a 9in pan. So I'd recommend buying some premade mini graham cracker shell and you can have some mini cheesecakes.

THIS CAKE WAS GORGEOUS. I TRULY BELEIVE IT COULD HAVE WON A PRIZE. FOR THE TOPPING I MADE THE SAUCE FROM STUFFED BLUEBERRY FRENCH TOAST THE MAPLES INN (GOOGLE). YOU COMBINE 1 CUP OF WATER, 1 CUP OF SUGAR, 2 TABLESPOONS CORNSTARCH AND 1 CUP OF BLUEBERRIES IN SAUCE PAN. COOK THE MIXTURE UNTIL IT THICKENS AND ADD 1 MORE CUP OF BLUEBERRIES AND 1 TABLESPOON BUTTER. SERVE WITH THE CAKE. THE FRENCH TOAST RECIPE IS FABULOUS ALSO

I've made this cheesecake 3 times already and tomorrow will be the fourth. Everyone and anyone who has ever taken a bite of this cheesecake agrees that it is four-forks-worthy. Follow the recipe as written and it will turn out perfectly. Don't use light/lowfat ingredients. Use an oven thermometer and preheat accordingly. The right temperature is very important. Remember...it calls for a 10-inch pan, so you shouldn't have any leftover batter. The only addition I make to this recipe is topping it with a thin layer of sour cream after it cools slightly, just to give it a nice smooth look...four forks for presentation when using the sour cream. I don't recommend using frozen berries...fresh is best. Serve the berries on the side. This really is a delicious cheesecake. Your friends and family will not believe that you made this!

Before I complain let me say, this cheesecake was over the top good and I suspect that this may become a signature dish. I'm still getting compliments on it days later. However, I am in the minority as I have complaints regarding the quantities and followed the directions to the T until I had to improvise. First, there wasn't enough graham cracker crust to sufficiently cover - so I had to increase the recipe for the crust by half. Then, I had way too much filling - far more than could be explained by my increasing the crust. I was very worried - recipes that need changes midstream unsettle me and usually end up in the trash bin but I was pleasantly surprised at the final outcome. The cake was tall, creamy, delicious, and had the impressive presentation I was going for. Next time I plan to try a sour cream & fresh strawberry topping & and of course, remember to increase the crust at the start!

I loved this cheesecake. The texture was perfect and not dry at all. It is a very thick and rich cheesecake. My boyfriend prefers a cheesecake which has less cheesecake and more fruit and crust so this was not his favourite for that reason. However when I took it to work it was devoured quickly and people were talking about it days later. I didn't make the topping as stated I cheated and bought some blueberry pie filling. Thanks for the great recipe I will definitely make it again.

The best cheesecake recipe I have come across. If you want a cheesecake to look and taste just like those you see in fine restuarants, this is it. I've made it topped with blueberries, strawberrys, raspberries, chocolate sauce, and plain-all have turned out fantastic! To "A Cook from San Diego-01/18/03" if you didn't make this recipe then you shouldn't be making any comments in the review section-go write a review for "Strawberry Strawberry Cheesecake" at that recipes site!!!!

In any event, this cake is easy to make, not overly sweet, and has a perfect texture. Fabulous!!!

Out of this world! I make this recipe a few times a year, and I hear over and over again, "This is the best cheesecake I've ever had!" Usually I use 2 bars of neufchatel cheese and 2 bars of regular cream cheese (always "Philadelphia" brand), and sometimes I use lite sour cream, and it's still phenomenal. A funny aside: After I made this recipe, I asked my friend in Alaska if she had ever been to the Riversong Lodge. Turns out that she had eaten there...with ME! Wonderful restaurant, not far from Anchorage, if you're ever out that way.

This was so good! It was smooth and creamy and not too dense. I combined this recipe and added the citrus ingredients for the Citrus Cheesecake recipe because I wanted something lemony and didn't want to deal with a topping because I was bringing this to work. I also baked it at 350 F for 1 hour without the water bath, turned the oven off, and then let it sit for another hour, and no cracks! Glazed with the marmalade glaze and looked professional. Received many compliments and requests for more!

I also added some fresh grated lemon rind and 1/8 tsp. of grated cinnamon into the crust which gave it a great little zing ~ accompanied the blueberry very well. YUMMY!

I made this cheesecake for a wedding shower last weekend and it was absolutely "killer!!" Everyone loved it. I made the cheesecake recipe exactly as written, but made a slight change in the topping.

This Cheesecake is wonderful! My personal preference is a cheesecake that is less creamy, but this was so delicious anyway! I don't care for graham cracker crust, so I made a shortbread crust from a 10oz package of Lorna Doone Shortbread Cookies.

The first time I made this cheese cake was maybe one and a half years ago. This has now become my standard cheesecake recipe. I have people who are not fussy about desserts asking me why they have to wait so long between cheesecakes!

Excellent recipe -- creamier than the one I normally use, although I made a few modifications. Substituted heavy cream for the milk so it would set a little firmer yet still creamy, and my friends love another white chocolate-raspberry cheesecake I make, so I added a 12 oz. package of Ghirardelli white chocolate chips, melted, and cut back the sugar to 1 1/4 cups. I am not a big white chocolate fan, but it is fabulous in cheesecakes. Also, instead of the topping, I roughly chopped the 12oz. pkg of frozen blueberries and added them directly to the batter, stirring just enough to leave a nice swirl design when the batter is poured into the pan. Two hints: for the crust, I use the pre-made Keebler shortbread crust (tastier than the graham cracker crumbs) and just crumble it back into crumbs and press it into the springform pan -- much easier and quicker that way. Also, if you don't have a roasting pan for the water bath for the springform pan as the cake bakes, you can just put some water in another cake or loaf pan and put it in next to the cake pan -- works the same to keep the cake moist.

Great cheesecake recipe! I will make this again and again ... however, I did make a different blueberry topping. I made this recipe's topping, and I have to say, it was a little bit unnatractive. The blueberries were too raw and the jam just didn't hold them together good enough. So I scraped them off and made this topping instead: In a saucepan over medium high heat, combine 1 heaping cup blueberries, 1/4 cup sugar and 1 1/2 tsp. cornstarch. Mix until sugar and cornstarch dissolve. Boil 3 min. or until juices are thick, take off heat, and stir in 1/2 cup blueberries. Cool mixture, pour over cheesecake and chill 2 hours or until set. It was AWESOME!!!!
