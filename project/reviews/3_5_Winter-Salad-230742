Rating is for the dressing only. To make the salad work (for me) required a serious reconfiguration of the ingredient amounts. Add many more apples, both red and green, less endive. I didn't try the truffle oil and cheese. Make it to your own taste and it is very refreshing and different. I am making it again for my Christmas buffet.

Good the first night the way written, but this got better the next day--dress all the root veggies, save the extra and let them sit overnight in the fridge and then add the greens/cheese/truffle oil before the final serving. I like my dresing less oily as well, so did 1/2 c. oil to recommended vinegar, could use a tad more tang, so maybe add a bit of lemon juice or maybe use blood orange instead...

Excellent salad. Enjoyed by both carnivores and vegans when I served it for Christmas dinner. Double the apple to increase tanginess. Replace honey with agave syrup and leave out cheese for a vegan salad.

I made this salad for a autumn dinner party and it was a hit! The salad dressing was excellent (I only used 1/2 cup olive oil) and added pomegranate seeds as garnish for color and it was really delicious. The thin stips of celeriac/apple /fennel make this so distinctive and memorable!

Not great for all the work involved. The goat cheese and onions dominated the dish. If you want to make this I would only use a quarter of an onion.
