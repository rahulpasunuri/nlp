The bacon flavour was incredilbly mellow....just right without being overpowering.

A keeper! Very easy and so delicious. I didn't wrap the potatoes, left the foil open so they became crispy outside and soft inside.

The texture of each potato slice was like butter! Held back on the salt with the bacon juice - (hate to call it grease --way too tasty) , next time I will add the full amount. I think the bacon juice helps with that buttery texture more than a full bacon flavor. The bits are for that!

These are great. Followed the recipe exactly except used chives from my garden instead of scallions and cooked partially in oven then finished on the grill. No marriage proposals at book club last night but some very happy diners.

These were good. But, I agree the bacon mixture didn't really penetrate. That's OK, because the sour cream and bacon on top made it really good.

The "hasslebacked" style was a nice tough - easy to separate and guests could take what they wanted, versus the entire potato if they wanted smaller portions. I wouldn't go through the trouble with the bacon mixture before hand - didn't seem to penetrate as stated. Would just add the scallions and maybe some butter in stead.

Absolutely DIVINE. These are without question the very best "baked potatoes" I have ever had. This recipe easily expands or shrinks to as few as 2 potatoes. My new family favorite. Rave! Rave!!

Yum! Used 8 oz. of bacon and 1lb potatoes. This will be my go to recipe for baked potatoes.
