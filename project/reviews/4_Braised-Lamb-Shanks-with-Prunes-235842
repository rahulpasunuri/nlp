I cooked this dish per the recipe but added 1/2 cup cabernet. I braised it in a 7 qt french oven at 300 for 2 1/2 hours. at the last half hour I added a cup of beef broth and 8 oz of couscous. It was extremely tender with a fantastic flavor. The lab loved the bone.

Somewhere I got spoiled with the tenderest lambshanks that appeared on a plate covered in the richest, red wine, sweet, syrupy glaze. This is not them, but they're still good.

I have never cooked lamb shanks prior to this evening. I stuck to the recipe for the most part although, I spent more time browning the meat and more time cooking the veggies. I used only about a cup and a half of chicken broth, no beef broth, and subbed with (Merlot)&(chardonnay) wine, and (some beer once I realized my liquid mostly cooked off). I cooked the shanks a bit longer and I added two dried chipotles, a bay leaf, teaspoon-or more curry powder, 1/2 teaspoon Chile powder. I served it with mashed potatoes. Also, a rough version of creamed spinach found on this site using frozen spinach was a very nice side.

This recipe is great. I make it a day before and reheat it. I have served it with Barley and it was a huge hit!

Fabulous!! I used 4 or 5 carrots, 2 onions, all chicken stock, and about half a head of minced garlic -- and it was very tasty!

Comforting and delicious. Great combination of savory and sweet and the braising liquid is delicious over rice or sopped up in a crusty piece of bread. Fall-off-the bone tender, which means you can make it ahead and remove meat from the bone before reheating for guests who don't find chewing meat off the bone appealing.

Made this for dinner tonight. Easy and delicious. I didn't change anything. Served with pureed celery root from this website. Great taste and not too much work. Will try again with company as it can be made ahead.

Lamb was very nice and a little more every day than a lot of the recipes that call for a full bottle of red wine or port. I made it exactly according to the recipe and agree that there's no purpose to keeping the skins on the garlic. My only complaint was the sauce was very thin so next time I'm going to try thickening it just before serving and maybe adding a little splash of port!

this is an additional note after making the dish a second time. I don't get the point of slicing the whole garlic bulb in half and then throwing into the broth/sauce. I coarsely chop the garlic, with skin removed. The first time I made this, I mostly removed skin (which seems against the recipe) and even then my boyfriend noticed the few skin bits that remained ... so my feeling is the garlic needs to be skinned, at the very least. Better to chop it, but don't press it. What else? Quality broth will make the dish for you ... spend a few bucks more for the REAL stuff at a gourmet store, or better yet, make your OWN! That's the best, and it is on my list for tomorrow ("start cooking the broth!). All in all, this recipe ROCKS! Prunes are invaluable here too ... YUM! I hope to hear other experiences about this dish soon!

This was a MOST FANTASTIC dish! I did it absolutely according to the recipe, although I used a homemade broth (which totally MADE the dish!). But I can't tell you how delicious it was. I made it for a dinner party and everyone (even the ex-vegetarian who doesn't eat much red meat) simply ate & made lots of "mmmmm" "oh my gosh" exclamations. I'm making it again tonight. I'll add notes if I find any tricks that I didn't remember from last time. TRY THIS RECIPE! SHANKS ARE FANTASTIC!
