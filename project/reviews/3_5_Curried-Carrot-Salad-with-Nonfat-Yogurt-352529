I found this lacking....something? Salt, sugar not sure how to tweek it to give it the lift I'm looking for.

I made this because I had the ingredients on hand. It was extremely tasty; I especially enjoyed the curry powder with the carrots. I would definately make this again. I added some nuts for extra flavor.

Also forgot to add that I tossed in a bit of agave syrup as well (might have used maple syrup or sugar but I'm out of both). As another commenter noted, there was a bit of a bitter flavour and the sweetener helped.

This is a decent salad but I think one that relies heavily on quality of ingredients. If you have old, flavourless carrots, ancient curry paste or bland yogurt, it's not going to taste very good. That said, I also increased the quantity of yogurt and lemon juice by almost double (although I did use slightly more than a pound of carrots). I also used a shallot instead of green onions (just based on what I had in my fridge) and left out the mint as I'm not a fan of it in this context. I could see adding sunflower seeds as well. Good way to use CSA carrots!

Disappointing. Really felt it lacked flavor. It needed something - salt? sugar? more currants?

I had hoped this recipe would convert my husband to carrots. I followed the recipe exactly and used mint from my garden. I don't know if the mint was too strong or if it was something in my curry but both my husband and I found this dish so bitter that we threw it out. (Goodbye expensive Greek yogurt!) I didn't convert him today.

I made this salad once and wasn't super impressed. Today I made it again with a few tweaks and definitely changed my mind. Its so fast and easy, fresh, and delicious. I put in chopped parsley instead of the green onion, and upped the quantities of everything in the dressing. I also used golden raisins instead of currants, as that is what I had on hand. Great as a side dish or on top of a green salad, and I think it would even be great on top of a turkey burger (coleslaw-style). I will definitely be making this salad regularly.

Very tasty! I used low-fat yogurt instead of fat free (I don't like fat-free taste). I used more curry. Salt is key to make the curry pop. This is an interesting dish that is great for upcoming summer parties.

Salad was good...I'll do it again for something a bit different but not weekly. It was better on day 2.

Loved this recipe - I felt it was brimming with a fresh combination of flavors. I particularly appreciate how healthy this is - I have a very health oriented palette, which may be part of why it appeals to my particular taste buds. Very easy to make - I will be making this salad frequently in the future. I used non-fat Greek (Fage) yogurt, which works great, and also happens to be healthier than normal yogurt, supplying additional high-quality protein.

I am not a huge carrot or curry fan but tried this (along with the Moroccan Chicken with Olives recipe - also May '09) and I LOVED it!! The green onions give it a little bite and the mint is a great compliment to the curry. Didn't have currents on hand so I used raisins, which worked just fine. I will make this again & again this summer - really healthy and refreshing!

I hate to say this - and I really hate giving negative reviews of recipes because of the hard work that goes into creating them - but I thought this was absolutely awful. Almost inedible. Before the addition of the mint, the salad was extremely bland. After the addition of the mint, the mint overpowered the salad and rendered it inedible. No one could even take more than 2 bites before pushing it aside. Yes, it is healthy and quick and I do appreciate that, but there are many other recipes that are well balanced and more satisfying than this. Unfortunately, I had to give this zero forks. I would not recommend this to my worst enemy.

I liked this recipe mostly for it's ease of preparation combined with 'different than the usual' flavors and high health factor. I used full fat yogurt as that's what I had on hand. It was tasty and I loved the currants with it.

This is better the second day. Healthy & decently tasty.
