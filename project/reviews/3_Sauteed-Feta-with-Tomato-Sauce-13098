This appetizer, while fried, is completely a light bite during a warm summer evening, in an air-conditioned, candlelit room. Jazz up this recipe with a garnish of sliced lemon halves around the dish. Place the sauce in the center and the feta cubes around for all to enjoy!

Depends on the feta, not surprisingly. Grocery feta just doesn't cut it. . . .
