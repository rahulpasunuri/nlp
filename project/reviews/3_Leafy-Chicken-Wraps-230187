Meh. I made this for my kids. They liked it, but I felt it was missing something. Made recipe as stated, but used less oil to make it healthier.

If you're looking for the P.F. Chang recipe, you can find it here: http://www.recipezaa r.com/15865. It's delicious.

Delicious! I used regular mushrooms, doubled the amount of garlic, and added a generous amount of sriracha for some spice.

I was hoping for something like the lettuce wraps you get at PF Changs, so maybe my hopes were too high. I felt the recipe was a little bland, so I ended up pretty much doubling the soy and fish sauce, and added peanut butter, ginger and even salt to add some flavor. I do love the crunch of the water chestnuts and lettuce. I'll probably look for a better recipe next time though.

My husband and I just love this dish - there's nothing not to love. And we calculated it, too, to be 2-3 weight-watchers points per wrap, if you're into that kind of thing. Super healthy, filling dinner.

This was ok. Not great, not bad, just ok. I wouldn't make it again, but I would not discourage anyone from trying it.

This was very good, my entire family liked it and I felt good making a healthy meal. Will make it again and even add more veggies next time.

This was very good. I added some hoisen sauce to give it a little extra flavor. I will definitely make this again!
