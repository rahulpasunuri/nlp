I've been making this for years every Easter. I very much look forward to Easter each year because of this lamb. I'm Greek, and have tried many recipes, and this one even beats my mother's.

I recently made this and was not as happy with it as some of the other reviewers. In the interest of full disclosure, I omitted the fennel since no one I was cooking for much cares for the licorice flavor it provides. Other than that, aside from doubling the greens, I followed the recipe. The lamb came out very well cooked although I think I'd prefer to sear it and roast it at a continuous temperature of 350 - it was beautifully medium rare on the inside but the outside was a bit tough. The greens had some minor issues. As I stated, I doubled the recipe and there still wasn't as much as I would have liked. Also, next time, I'd stuff ALL the greens into the lamb and just pour the juices over. The greens that were poured over the lamb ended up on the bottom of the pan where they got very greasy from the drippings. There's another recipe on this site "Leg of Lamb Stuffed with Wild Mushrooms and Greens" which I prefer and will go back to. The feta, though, is a really nice addition so I think I'll mod that recipe to include feta. In any case, the lamb was still delicious and got rave reviews but, really, try the lamb stuffed with greens and mushrooms - it was seriously one of the most delicious lamb dishes I've ever eaten!

I'm considering making this for my mother's birthday dinner. Anyone have any suggestions for using a bone-in leg of lamb with this recipe? Maybe I'll just have to take it to the butcher. Also, I'm not into anise so I'll either leave out or replace the fennel. Any ideas on a promising replacement flavor?

This was delicious. I used FAR more greens than the recipe called for, and I'm glad I did. I think that I probably used about 10 cups (it was 2 bunches of swiss chard), and is was the perfect amount. The 1 1/2 cups that the recipe called for would have completely disappeared. I used a boneless butterfly cut, and I would do the same next time, as it was easy to prep and to cut and serve. I would recommend this recipe, especially to someone who hasn't made a leg of lamb before and may find it intimidating.

Add me to the consensus--this one's a winner. I'm also with the more-greens faction. I used two bulbs of fennel, three bunches of scallions, and two bunches of chard to stuff and cover a four-pound butterflied leg. That heavy load of stuffing does mean at least 90 minutes cooking time, even starting from room temperature, so time the (fantastic) lemon-garlic-oregano potatoes accordingly.

Fantastic. Made a 6lb. butterflied leg of lamb (rolled and tied as directed). Cooked it on 450 for 25 min. per the recipe and then reduced it to 350 for another 1 hr. 30 minutes to get to 135 degrees. Everyone at Easter raved that it was the best lamb they'd ever had...

Being of Andriotiko decent, I was excited to find this recipe - and it is indeed delicious. My leg of lamb was totally boneless and 3.85 lbs. It took a good deal longer than was listed, I turned the temperature up to 400 and it was a perfect medium rare @ 140 degrees.

Very tender and moist meat, stuffing was good. Argenti lamb shanks on this site still my favorite lamb recipe of all time.

my god! this is REALLY good!

Delicious. I made it with a butterflied leg, and covered the bottom of the pan with the potatoes. I used a Boutari wine, and Swiss Chard. The only caveats: it took a good thirty to forty minutes longer to cook! And though I doubled the filling, I could have doubled it again. My next challenge: I have a full leg, bone in; I need to figure out how to cook it with this recipe!

This was very good. It was almost perfect but somehow took on a kind of citrus flavor that I wasn't crazy about,--that could be my fault with the kind of wine I used. It was an impressive dish to serve to friends and considering didn't take all that long to prepare.

This recipe was delicious! I used fresh mixed greens from my garden and used about 6 cups, unpacked. I can't imagine using less. I left out the fennel bulb because my market was out, so I added a thin sliced red onion. I found that the freshly ground fennel seed and dill fronds added plenty of flavor. I also roasted some new potatoes tossed in olive oil, salt and red pepper flakes in the same pan as the lamb. Just add more wine, the potatoes will soak it up.

Great recipe! I would definately increase the greens because they really wilt. My husband is not a fan of feta, so I used Goat cheese instead, and it was amazing!

Made this for Easter dinner. I soon found out none of the guests like lamb. They agreed they would eat it to be polite. One bite and they said it was amazing, and confessed their pact. I may have made some lamb lovers out of them after this one.

Graced our Easter table, too. Easy and different. Great for preparing ahead and having hardly anything to do the day-of. I marinated for a good 30 hours and I would do it again that long. I trimmed every smidgen of fat from the butterflied leg of lamb and there were still plenty of juices for using with side dishes. Used more greens than it called for (they wilt down so much).

Wonderful dish! Made for easter.

Very good. Don't think that you can make this without a meat thermometer. Because I am a poor student I used a big metal baking pan - it seemed to work fine. The filling is soooo good. I used a boneless leg of lamb - take care if you don't have a nice butcher near you that you trim it well yourself - not much fat will burn off this recipe. Wonderful flavor combination.

This dish was amazing! I too made it for Easter this year (2006) and it was great, but there was one problem that I wanted to let the forum know and maybe get an answer too b/c it has happened before to my mom. I cooked the lamb in a pyrex dish as recommended, but as I was adding more wine the dish burst, I mean broke apart, which could be very dangerous. My mom then remebered that the same thing had happened to her with lamb in a pyrex container. I'm sure it has something to do with adding something at a different temperature (the wine was at room temeperature), but we used the recommeneded cookware. Just wanted to let people be warned.

We had this dinner for Easter 2006 and it was a big hit. Even non-lamb eaters had some. I made it as the recipe directed except I used a boneless leg of lamb. It came in an elastic net casing which I partially removed, stuffed the meat and added the casing again to hold it together. This worked like a charm. I had to cook it longer but used a probe to 135 degrees as directed. After letting it sit, it was done perfectly. I made it with the potato recipe that was included and they were also a big hit. Even the mashed potato lovers came back for seconds. Served this with mashed sweet potatoes, pureed celery root and asparagus. Yum. This goes into my recipe box without a doubt. Several copies went home with dinner guests.

We all love lamb but I didn't know many ways to cook it so we mostly had broiled lamb chops. I decided to try this recipe and was delighted that I did. Not only was it easy to do, the flavor and aroma while cooking had every one anxious to try it.Great success with little effort. The potatoes too were outstanding.

I'd never made leg of lamb before and this turned out to be much easier to make than I'd thought--and sooooo delicious. Made this with the potatoes, which are amazing. I even went out and bought the cookbook. I followed both recipes exactly.

I made this recipe for my family's Easter Dinner 2005. I am returning again to my recipe box to retrieve it as I have had several request to make it again since then. I have to be honest; I did not have the fennel nor any of the greens with the exception of Spinach, which I used with the feta. I cooked the Lamb about 10 minutes longer which I think it needed. It still had the nice red colour, as Lamb should, but not too rare. Eeven those people at my table who preferred their meat well done, could not get enough. Other than that I followed the instructions as outlined. I also made Fontina Risotto Cakes,Broccoli with Roasted Almonds in Maple Syrup and Creamed Pearl Onions. And if I do say so myself,it was wonderful! All of the recipes on my Easter table had been tried and tested on previous occasions from Epicurious.com and all are four forks in my book!

Despite the inability of the butcher to figure out what we were asking for, this is a really great dish! Personally, I think it would only improve if you actually stuffed the leg, rather than fill the butterflied one (as we did, out of desperation!). The flavors are perfect, and we all ate much more than we should have. This will reappear in our house, and definitely for company as well as just us.Don't change a thing!

Having never cooked lamb of any kind in the past, I was a little nervous about this recipe. But it was fairly straightforward. I prepared as much as I could the day before our dinner. I did end up using more wine than recipe called for. Everyone loved the lamb!

Used a butterflied lamb stuffed with leeks, fennel, baby swiss chard and fennel. Was delicious, and very moist and tender. 20 min before done, threw some baby fava beans still in the pod into the roasting pan to accompany. If anything, I would have wished there was more filling -- this recipe makes just a little to go with a large amount of meat.

I followed the recipe exactly and let the stuffed lamb sit overnight. Very easy and so delicious! Made this with the potatoes for Easter dinner. Everyone raved about this dish.

A dish that presents beautifully and is not difficult to prepare. Have your butcher bone and butterfly the meat. Spread the greens/cheese mixture on top. I used goat cheese- creamy and rich. Roll from short end and tie firmly. The whole family loved it on Easter Sunday! Served with roasted red peppers and potatoes. Easy prep the day before so you have little mess the day of serving.
