Very good, super fattening and easy to vary. I made this in small individual ramekins as well as larger containers, topping them with panko bread crumbs instead of the onions (which were chopped and added to the pasta). Ham, bacon, pancetta, cooked greens, green onions-all could be worked in here. Use a quality pasta like an imported Italian one-they hold up a bit better with the sauce. Like other readers, I added extra sauce and slightly undercooked the pasta. The individual ramekins take about 10 min. rather than the 15 for the larger dish. Even my teenagers had seconds!

This is my go-to recipe when I am in a hurry. Can be done in 30 minutes. It also makes plenty for the 3 of us and it is great as leftovers - just pop it in the microwave. I have used sweet onion in place of the shallots and it is just as good. If I use elbow macaroni, the ratio of pasta/sauce is perfect as written. If I use a larger noodle, like penne, I need more sauce. Goat cheese, feta cheese, bleu cheese are all good as the topping.

Very nice. Used Sriracha sauce, mixed half & half with skim milk to cut the fat, and topped with panko bread crumbs for crunchiness. 11-year-old boy who lives on chicken nuggets and pizza gave it a thumbs up, as did vegetarian/gourmand dad. Will definitely make again!

Love this recipe...last time I made it, I used gorgonzola instead of the goat cheese...equally as good. Has anyone made this in advance...mixed it all together and then reheated before serving?

This recipe is a home run and extremely easy to make. I've made it for the last 2 years for a 40+ person holiday party. I triple the recipe and make 1/3 of the cheese another hard cheese, like gruyere. I use DeCecco pasta, Cavatappi, its a large spiral. Plus I add sprinkle bacon on the top. Also easy to do in advance. Cook pasta, store in fridge. -- I've read cold pasta will absorb more of the cheese sauce = tastier mac n' cheese! --- Cook shallots, store in fridge. When ready to assemble, put cheese in a pot, add flour, toss. Turn on burner add cream. Mix until sauce is smooth. Remove shallots from fridge, they will have a lot of butter in them, microwave it so its easy to spread. Meanwhile add pasta to cheese sauce. Assemble and put in oven, about 15-20 minutes, cheese will bubble on the edges.

After making this dish several times, I've found couple modifications that make it spectacular! I undercook the pasta so its still a little chewy. I make 1.5 times the sauce so its pretty runny and mix the shallots directly into the recipe. I then top with panko breadcrumbs and bake at about 350 for 30 minutes. Have tried a variety of cheeses and really anything you have left in your refrigerator will work. Spectacular every time!

I agree with everyone else who said this recipe is great - there are so many mac n' cheese recipes out there that just aren't quite right - but this one is perfect. I also agree with the comments about the sauce to pasta ratio - should be 1.5:1. That's how I made it and it was just the right moisture content. My other changes were to add bacon (because everything's better with bacon) and to use chipotle chile powder in lieu of hot sauce, with a little more sprinkled on top for color.

Rating: 4
This is a great go to recipe when craving a creamy mac and cheese. I always use a really good quality cheddar to really bring out the cheesiness. The shallots really give the dish depth and do not skip the goat cheese, gives the mac and cheese a creaminess that you do not normally get.

Made this for a dinner meeting last night - the dish was scraped absolutely clean and I was asked to send out the recipe with the meeting notes. Added cubed ham steak to appease the carnivores, substituted penne/fusilli mix for macaroni, and doubled the sauce for 1.5 times the rest of the recipe. Proportions seemed great, not at all dry. Definitely a keeper!

Rating: 4
Delicious! I made the recipe exactly as written and it wasn't dry at all. The steps for me were a little out of order, next time I'll start boiling the water first, then do the shallots, then preheat the oven when I start making the cheese sauce. I will definitely make this again.

I have been an epicurious site user for a few years now, and have never reviewed a recipe. This is the BEST mac and cheese I have ever made! I did follow some of the other reviewers and used 1.5 times the sauce, I like my mac and cheese really cheesey and it was perfect!

Rating: 3
Based on some of the reviews of the dish being dry, I made 1 1/2 of the cheese sauce and found that it was way too much (I had to reserve some of the sauce). Next time I'll just stick to the proportions stated. The sweetness of the caramelized shallots really make this dish great.

Rating: 4
Instead of cheddar, used equal parts smoked cheddar and parmesan.

Rating: 3
The previous reviewer is right, this recipe is a bit drier and slightly less cheesy than I would have liked. I used low fat 1/2 and 1/2, which made for a slightly thinner sauce, and sub'd feta and gorgonzola for the goat cheese. generally delicious and I would definitely make it again, next time with more hot sauce!

Rating: 2
This was good, but oddly - especially for macaroni and cheese - a bit dry. I really loved the flavor combination of the shallots and the cheese - the shallots along with the hot sauce make this dish - however, I don't think the cheese comes through. Next time I make this, I would double the cheese sauce and I think it'll be perfect.

Rating: 4
A great key mac and cheese recipe. I altered quite a bit: skim milk instead of half and half, medium cheddar instead of sharp, threw in a half a cup of so of Gouda, and used Parmesan instead of goat cheese. It still turn out fantastic! I was worried the shallots would be too crispy, but it gave just the right crunch, a bit like French's onions. As others have said this is a great recipe to start from and add to.

WOW. So easy to make and so good! I followed the recipe about 90%. Substituted smoked mozzarella for the goat cheese and mixed some of it in with the roux. Used Sriracha for the hot sauce. Delicious!

I made this last night and it was amazing! I will definitely be keeping this one on hand to make again. I did use yellow onions instead of shallots, and it was just as good. I was hoping there would be more leftovers...but looks like I will have to make it again soon! Also wrote a little blog about it, if you would like to check it out at www.aphotographerscookbook.com

I haven't eaten the finished dish yet, but this sauce is to die for! Used whatever cheese I had left in the fridge like another reviewer -- a little Cheddar, Gruyere and some goat cheese. The result is amazing -- I am licking the leftovers out of the pot! Don't skimp on the hot sauce. I will definitely use this recipe again and again!

Just finished this and agree with the accolades. I was short on shallots so used the 1 I had and used a sweet onion to make up the difference. It came out perfect, just the right amount of heat. Thanks to all the reviewers. I am sick of trying macaroni and cheese recipes and being disappointed. Finally I found a keeper!

This was terrific! A great buffet dish for the vegetarians in my crowd and popular with carnivores as well. I used Green Chili puree, Smoked Cheddar and threw a layer of avocado slices under the top cheese layer (Santa Fe style). I was hoping to have the leftovers for lunch, but my buddies scraped the dish clean!

This is the best mac and cheese I have ever had and that includes Moms as well as some amazing restaurant versions. I followed the recipe with the exception of increasing the pasta by 2x, changing the hot sauce as well as using onions and shallots. I was afraid the recipe would be too rich, so I used 16oz conchiglie pasta. We like the favor of Scorned Woman hot sauce, but it can be a little hotter than others so I used 1.5 teaspoons versus 2.5 (next time I will only use 1 teaspoon). Additionally did not have enough shallots, so caramelized a sweet onion as well as used sautéed shallots. I doubt I will ever consider a different mac and cheese recipe  it turned out just too perfect.

Rating: 4
Like most of the other reviewers, I thought the dish was exceptional. I rarely make mac and cheese but this one really hit the spot. I agree with several others in that the amount of shallots was not enough, at least for me. One reviewer said she had a problem with the half and half curdling when adding the hot sauce. I had the same problem. But then I have the curdling problem with half and half in many other recipes. Any sure fire cures out there?

Rating: 4
This is a wonderful gourmet take on mac and cheese. It's a pretty easy recipe, and it's great to add the "odds and ends" in your fridge. I added some fresh corn and rosemary to the caramelized shallots which added great flavor boost (and worked surprisingly well with the Tapatio!) and used fusilli in place of the elbow macaroni, which gave it a great texture. I look forward to further exploration!

Rating: 4
Nothing short of amazing! I made 1 1/2 batch so increased accordingly but also added about 1/2 cup extra Gouda cheese. I also topped with 6 strips of cooked, crispy, chopped Bacon under the shallots before putting in the oven. Everyone loved it! I think it was the first dish I have made that my husband really loved. Would definitely make again.

Rating: 4
Excellent ingredient combination. I did make modifications based on some reviews. I made a recipe and a half, using the general quantities, except I added a bit more half and half, 2 4 oz. packages of red peppper crusted goat cheese, not quite 2 c. cheddar and added parmesan to the mix, as well as the caramelized onions. I like the onion flavor throughout. Just add more atop if you choose. I added more parmesan cheese atop. Made for my family of 3 and 5 other Nascar fans after a race. All loved it.

I used this recipe as a guide,using leftovers/ingredients on hand. Collecting all "still edible" cheeses from fridge: A quarter chunk of Cambazola blue brie, a tiny wheel of mild goats cheese (1/4-1/2 Cup?), medium sharp chedder (mostly this) and added a small handful of freshly grated parmesian (to sharpen a bit). Oddly I had 5 large shallots on hand (bought them just because they looked good before ever seeing this recipe). Am familiar with, and like Cholula and Tapatio hot sauce, both are excellent, though was only armed with Dave's Insanity sauce (used about a 1/2 teaspoon, or so,ONLY) and it worked like a charm with nice flavor and compliment to the Cambazola coming through. Careful with "the Dave's", it isn't the same potentcy as most others (you have been warned). Has nice flavor despite the "corny" name. Didn't have half & half, so substituted with a concoction of Goat's milk, a bit of melted butter and a small bit of cold milk/flour roux mixed in. It worked like a charm and then shortened the amount of flour used later. Oh, and uh, in great exhuberance, throwing cheeses in willy nilly, I forgot to save the goats cheese for the top, and it was great anyhow. (Sprinkled top with a small amount of last minute "freezer found" shredded cheddar and parmesian. Delicious! These are a great many changes, but the basis of having Shallots and a mix of cheeses with a tad of hot sauce worked well. The hot sauce was a perfect foil for the richness of the cheese as this helped it from being overly cloying (as many Mac & Cheese recipes can be).

I'm going to sound like a heretic but I enjoy cheap, instant, creamy mac and cheese. That off my chest, this mac and cheese was good and the caramelized shallots really added to it. I'm a fan of shallots to being with so this recipe was attractive to me. I think that next time I'm going to have to double the shallot mixture as it didn't seem like enough to cover the mac and cheese.

Rating: 1
Tapatio is the best hot sauce to use. 2 out of 5 people enjoyed this dish. They must love shallots because it has a very strong flavor in this recipe. I used 2 cups instead of 3 and it was still too overpowering. Also, the recipes says it makes 6 servings, but it actually makes about 8-10 servings.

Rating: 4
This was so delicious....I doubled the recipe because I had 10 people coming to dinner. I also used two cups of sharp cheddar and two cups of smoked cheddar. And instead of caramelizing the shallots, I flash fried them in oil to give the recipe a crunch. I wasn't too sure about the goat cheese, but added it anyway and I'm so glad I did. I served it with crock pot bbq chicken. It was a great combination.

yum. decadent, rich, easy to make and most assuredly NOT date food. make sure that you cook up this over-the-top mac for folks you are comfortable around or won't see for a day or two. it is delicious but [TMI alert] you'll be burping caramelized shallots and tooting goat cheese for a couple of days afterward. oops! as for the recipe itself, i [obviously] found the topping quantity to be slightly excessive as written and would cut back a bit next time and add more hot sauce. i used 3 or 4 tsp. Cholula and will swap it for Tapatio, as i think it tastes better with cheese, as evidenced by its deliciousness on pizza. enjoy and don't forget the Alka Seltzer!

I was disappointed in this dish, especially because of all the rave reviews it had received.. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using tabasco instead of the noted Cholula sauce.

This was a HUGE HIT with a 30+ person holiday party. Even the little ones ate it up. I quadrupled this recipe. Made shallots in advance and kept in fridge. Made the pasta in advance, ziploc bagged it, put in fridge. Made sauce during the party and just pulled out the shallots and pasta from fridge. I also did 1/2 extra sharp cheddar, 1/4 white sharp cheddar, and 1/4 gouda. Instead of macaroni I used cavatappi shaped pasta (4 boxes of it!). This was a winner. If half and half starts to curdle lower heat, I also never stopped stiring mine with a whisk, came out perfect!

Sophisticated variation on regular mac and cheese. I substituted carmelized onions that I already had on hand, evaporated milk (for the half and half), and also used about 1 cup of american cheese (the rest was an aged cheddar.) The evaporated milk and american cheese made the sauce very creamy without any curdling. I served it with roasted baby beets. Delicious!

This is good. I have tried other adult mac and cheese recipes and I think they are kind of bland - this is smoky and complex with the carmelized onions and goat cheese - definitely mac and cheese all grown up!

Made this yesterday to have with beef ribs, slow roasted in beef broth and beer, finished on the barbeque with bullseye sauce. It really hit the spot after a full day of gardening. Pretty much the same ingredients as for my scalloped potatoes with the exception of the goat cheese. Of course, I will add the good cheese to my scalloped potatoes from now on.

MY boyfriend was recently diagnosed with an allergy to milk, but is able to tolerate goat's milk. I've been looking for ways to feed him his favourite foods without compromising flavour, so I was excited to come across this recipe. I substituted the butter with goat's milk butter and the half-and-half with whole goat's milk. The best find though, was a gouda-style cheese also made from goat's milk, which I used in place of the cheddar. The rest of the recipe I followed as written, and it was the BEST mac and cheese I have ever had! I LOVE cheddar cheese, but I didn't even miss it with this version :)

Wow! So yummy! My husband is a connoisseur of mac n' cheese, and truly loved this version! I doubled the recipe, didn't have enough shallots, although it didn't effect outcome. I ended up making my standard rue ( kind of on autopilot, before I realized that wasn't how the recipe went!) so, I used 1% milk to make the sauce, rather than half and half. Forgot the hot sauce, although would like to NOT forget that next time:)

My stand by mac and cheese recipe is by Barefoot Contessa and this one is ok, will continue with Barefoot's recipe, I won;t make this one again, it is a tad cheesy (not in a good way) and the goat cheese on top does not do much. Shallots caramelized adds another flavor but I love a hardy mac and cheese and this was not it

Super easy to make and very flavorful. Some thought it was all about the shallots - for me it was all about the GOAT CHEESE! I was a little thrown off by the half and half separating while simmering - but once the cheese was added to the mix it all made sense.

Used 3C cheddar cheese (because I used a whole box of pasta) and crumbled gorgonzola cheese on top. Increased flour to 2T and used 1C half and half and a little more than 1/4C 2% milk because I didn't have enough half and half. It was plenty rich. I would've liked a little more sauce so will increase liquid to 1 2/3C next time. Used a whole box of cavatappi (curly open tubed pasta)-14 oz. Could get by with less shallot; I peeled and chopped for a long time. Could use a little more hot sauce, too. Wonderful!

Yummy. And even better...fast and easy! Shallots are excellent. No fans of goat cheese in my house, so I will substitute blue cheese (or go without) next time. I used tabasco but cut it to 1 1/2 tsp. Kids liked it, but still zippy enough for the adults. Very tasty! Will definitely make it again.

I thought this was rich, but very good. I made mine in a 9 inch pan. I would cut back on the half and half next time though as it was a bit too saucy for me.

Next time I would not cover them when cooking or fry them.

I did the opposite of most, and turned the fat content up! Made it with 18% table cream instead of 10% half and half... Hey, it was all I had. Tasted good, and easy enough to make.

Cholesterol Special! I paved the bottom of the baking dish with steamed broccoli and cubed ham before adding the mac and cheese, and it made a deliciious, if rich, dinner. It would be just as good if made with milk instead of half and half, and while the shallots were good I'm not sure that the added fat and the fact that they made my house smell like a gymnasium were worth the extra bit of flavor. Don't count on this serving six as a main course!

Whipped up a pan of this on a cold and stormy night, since we had half-and-half leftover from holiday meals and it was easier than making our usual milk-based roux. The result was a solid mac and cheese, not transcendently different from others, but a good trade-off of effort and results. I have to admit that I made a mistake in the preparation, but I'd do it again: I was halving the recipe to make an 8" pan, but accidentally made the full recipe of sauce for half the pasta. I baked it for a bit longer than suggested, and it turns out that this amount of sauce was good, since pasta absorbs a lot of the liquid during baking. I imagine that with the amount of sauce recommended, it would be rather dry. All in all, a good basic technique, and a good base for flavor modifications. (I added some blue cheese instead of goat cheese, and mixed in some wheat germ and dried thyme to the shallow topping)

Whole wheat elbows make this already great dish even better.

I made this one afternoon because I happened to have most of the ingredients on-hand. We loved it! I did not add the goat cheese (only because I had none) and used rigatoni instead of macaroni. This was amazing and am planning to make again soon! If you like cheese and pasta, you will love this!

I used Jim Beam hot sauce for this recipe, and I thought it tasted great! I also added an extra half-cup of macaroni because I don't like super-creamy mac and cheese. I was pleased with the result, but if you like melted cheese dripping off your fork you won't want to do it.

This is a really good recipe. I added 150 gr of pancetta and used mozerella cheese instead of goat cheese. Next time I will double the cheese sauce.

Fabulous! I also added a bit of grated Huntsman cheese.

I made this for a group of teens who requested a mac & cheese dinner prior to a dance (yes, it's true). I know they were thinking out of a box - like they make routinely. Instead, I did this. These girls were calling for seconds and making yummy sounds all around the table! As for me (and the other adults) we loved it. The carmelized shallots are unbelievable! Next time I will double them! This is real comfort food with gourmet twist. Make it! Make it soon!

This is exceptional! You can't go wrong adding bacon to the top layer.

Made this for casual Thanksgiving get-together to rave reviews. Quite simple - adding flour to cheese THEN whisking into cream/hot sauce good idea. Really nice flavors - was dubious about number of shallots and need for goat cheese on top of an already cheese-laden recipe, but this was a hit in my book. Will definitely make again.

The recipe sounded great, and I made it exactly as published; however, it just didn't wow us. For me, this recipe had great ingredients that just didn't come together well....

Amazing mac and cheese recipe. So easy to make and the leftovers reheat well, with out sauce separating.

Made this for a birthday luncheon... terrific! Amazingly difficult to get plain old elbow mac these days, it seems, but this worked well with the ferretto pasta which seemed the nearest I could get. I made the recipe exactly as specified, and made the pasta and sauce the night before, took it out of the fridge in the mornng and then fried the shallots. Because the recipe is so unctuous, I would suggest a crisp, even slightly bitter salad to accompany - perhaps grated carrot and ginger salad plus a green one. Dessert should not be creamy either, but fruity. Easy to double the recipe too.

Made it last night and it was delicious. Husband really loved it! I did not have macaroni-shaped pasta so I used cavatappi. Instead of the hot sauce, I used Penzeys's Aleppo Pepper & Cayenne Pepper. Also, I used the food processed to crumble up some Ciabatta bread and sprinkled it on top with the carmelized shallots. The crunchy breadcrumbs soaked up some of the butter from the shallots and provided a nice textural contrast to the soft cheese and pasta. Next time I cook this dish, I will try adding little pieces of fried bacon or pancetta to the dish before I bake it. I think little pieces of bacon mixed into the dish will provide a nice flavor and texture.

Unbelievably good. I used 2 Tbs flour and 3/4c cream and 1 1/4c whole milk and it was wonderful. the carmelized shallots really, really make it gourmet comfort food.

This was great! I was skeptical about the cheddar, hot sauce, goat cheese, shallots combo- seemed like it would be a little chaotic. Boy, was I wrong! The hot sauce gave the cheese sauce just enough kick to make it interesting, and the goat cheese and shallots were the perfect accent, they really made the dish! Very easy to make and a very satisfying dish.

This was delicious! I was skeptical about the amount of shallots called for but they definitely made the dish. I put it all together about an hour before even putting it into the oven and it came out great.

This recipe makes the best mac and cheese I've ever had. I made it exactly as the recipe states except that I used a sliced onion in place of the shallots, and I used a tiny bit more flour since I usually prefer a thicker sauce on my mac and cheese. Incredible!
