I'm not much of a baker, and my presentation skills leave a little to be desired, but these tarts were still seriously yummy.

I'd made this several times when we had guests swing by unexpectedly after dinner. I also used Gala apples once in a pinch and that was also delicious!

I have not tried this but will, except to make it even quicker I will leave it in a square shape, fan out as many pears as fit, then, when baked cut with a pizza wheel into a piece per fanned pear. Reviewers suggestions all sound great. Our pears are now just coming off the trees in this fruit growing region. Might try this with peaches or nectarines!

Also loved the delicious simplicity of this. Broiled for two minutes at the end to give the pastry a more golden colour. No cognac so I splashed a bit of grand marnier over and it was delightful.

This makes the third review and the first one who made no changes. It is an easy dessert to prepare and the brandy adds a touch of sophistication. I made the tarts several hours ahead of time.

What an easy recipe to make and so good for summer! Instead of making two separate tarts, I made one big circle from the sheet of puff pastry and fanned one sliced pear around the whole thing. Also sprinkled just a few mini chocolate morsels over it the last few minutes of baking and that was sooooo good!

This was an incredibly easy and tasty recipe. I didn't have any ice cream or brandy, but just the puff pastry and pear together was great and looked really nice. I'd never used puff pastry before but since it's so simple and yummy, I'm definitely going to make this again. I think it would also work well with apples.
