I've made this many times since it first appeared in Bon Apppetit ten years ago. Fantastic! Reheats well also.

I made this recipe substituting the 2 cups water with chicken broth. I only used 1/4 of the honey that the recipe called for. I think this recipe is very tasty and I would definately try it again. The tiny bones from the Game Hens were a bit distracting when eating the sauce so I would try chicken pieces next time.

I will most certainly make this again. The flavors are wonderful and this makes really good leftovers. I cut the honey to a third of a cup and served over couscous. Instead of game hens, I used a cut up chicken. This is a recipe to pass to friends.

I make this dish with chicken parts and love it every time. It reheats beautifully and is quite foolproof with respect to type/quantity of dried fruit, although the amount of honey can be cut a bit with no diminution of flavor. For any cooks who are Jewish, it works beautifully as a holiday option.

Absolutely loved this easy recipe. Would consider using skinless chicken parts next time, I was forever trying to degrease the sauce. The sauce is a little sweet, so I would experiment with less honey and dried fruit.

we made this two nights ago -- no big deal. i must have missed something. why do you need cornish hens if you just split them up anyway? the sauce did not really add much to the flavor of the hens.

For something different, this is a nice and quick dish- the great thing is that you can make it ahead for company and then reheat it. I added extra fruit, so I disagree with the other reviewer who suggested less fruit than the cup called for- I thought adding a bit more was nice. I served this with 2 other recipes from epicurious- Moroccan style carrots (yum), and a saffron/pea couscous dish. Different and easy for entertaining.

Smells incredible, tastes great. Easy to prepare. Used less fruit than what it called for... if you use too much fruit the sauce gets too sweet.
