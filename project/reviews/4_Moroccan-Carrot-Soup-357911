Easy and delicious. Sautéed onions in olive oil till caramelized, used powdered cumin without roasting and used a vegetable boullion broth instead of chicken broth - otherwise made as per recipe. Sorry I had not made a bigger batch as we gobbled this right up.

Simple, yet the flavors are complex. A wonderful combination of spices. New favorite recipe!

This is a very good and flavorful soup recipe exactly as written. I regard this as a 'tasting' soup suitable prior to the entree. I do not see this as a meal. The flavors are complex and delicate, and there is plenty of flavor. I served this at room temperature or warmed very slightly for best flavor. You can also buy ground roasted cumin to save the step of roasting yourself with whole seeds. I took the advice of another cook to add more characteristic Moroccan spices/flavors with the carrot: I reduced broth to 2 cups and added 1/2 cup orange juice, zest of a large orange, 3/4 tsp cinnamon, and a 3/4 oz package of mint leaves chopped coarsely and processed with the soup. This only makes the flavors even more complex suporting the idea that it is a tasting soup and very much worth the relatively small effort. I also made this for a Church event and recevied numerouse requests for the recipe.

Unplanned substitution of water for the stock (thought I was better stocked...) and it was still great. Thanks to the reviewer who suggested the Mrouzia (Zamouri Spices) - that put it over the top. I'd appreciate suggestions from anyone who might have an idea why my yogurt split; next time I'll add a hearty dollop atop each bowl but leave it out of the mix. Also plan to hold a bit of toasted cumin back for garnish.

Maybe we were expecting too much after reading all the glowing reviews, but we were disappointed with this soup. I followed the recipe exactly and used good Greek yogurt but both my husband and I thought it was delicious before the addition of the yogurt and not so much after. I'll probably make it again but we'll leave the yogurt out next time.

I love this recipe! So easy and very good! I did make one adjustment, I added a whole cube of butter!

Fantastic. I cooked this with the cumin and the allspice towards the end. I also used about a tablespoon and a half of a Moroccan spice that you can get online from Zamouri spices called Mrouzia. Mrouzia has tumermeric, cinnamon, ginger, fennel, anise seed, cardamon, galangal, star anise, cayenne, garlic, nigella, paprika, rosebuds, salt, ajwan seeds, lavender blossoms, and mace. I used to live in Morocco. For me, the addition of Mrouzia makes all the difference--makes it really taste Moroccan. I also blended in some fresh uncooked garlic. You could skip the lemon and add some orange and also some mint if you wanted--mint, orange, and cinnamon is a typical Moroccan combination with carrots. Lovely, simple, elegant, and, most of all, scrumptious. I will definitely make this again. I served it with a bit of creme fraiche, but it is so creamy that you don't really need to if you don't want the calories.

This is really quite a lovely and easy soup to make. I followed the recipe but opted to stir the cumin into the soup along with the allspice etc. The yogurt is a great finishing touch. I'll definitely make this again!

We really enjoyed this soup. It was a nice change from my usual gingered carrot soup recipe. I added ground cumin, cloves, and cayenne to the soup as it cooked and ignored the spices at the end. Instead of yogurt, I stirred in some half-and-half when it was finished. I think whipped cream or yogurt would be a nice touch though. Delicious and easy enough for a weeknight!

Rating: 4
This was delicious. So smooth and velvety in texture. I doubled the recipe and added minced garlic (1 t per batch). The addition of the yogurt made it even better. I toasted the cumin seeds and served them whole so they looked great but I'd grind them next time or use pre-ground. I will definitely make this again and love how easy it is.

I give this a solid 4 stars! It is super easy with ingredients I had on hand. And it was delicious. Win-Win:) I did make some minor modifications. When I was cooking the carrots, I added ground cumin and allspice. After I pureed it, based on taste I decided that it needed more seasoning so I added another round of cumin and allspice. Next time I will just double the spices from the beginning. My boyfriend loved it! I loved it! And it whipped together so quickly! I will make this again for sure. I might even buy carrots to make this soup again, and not just find an excuse to use up some carrots.

This does not compare with the similar "Chilled Carrot Soup with Cumin and Lime" which has more complex flavors and is far more interesting. However, i used this recipe since it's simpler and had no time to chill the soup.

VERY good. Made as directed with one exception: I braised some red kale to serve alongside, then just tossed it into the bowl at the last second. Just lovely, and so healthy. The toasted, ground cumin seeds were great. If you can help it, don't use store-bought already-ground cumin.

Wow! This was terrific. I was looking for something other than the usual carrot-and-ginger combo and this was a pleasant surprise. The only changes I made were to add a clove of garlic to the onions and a pinch of cayenne at the end. This is definitely going into the regular rotation.

Great, quick soup recipe! I followed other reviewer instructions and added the cumin & allspice to the carrots in the beginning. I also used veggie broth as I am a vegetarian.

Yes, hello, over here? It's me. The definition of the inexperienced, awkward, totally uninformed cook. Only started attempting to cook food oh... two weeks ago, with largely hilarious and fail-tastic results. Needless to say, this is the first soup I ever attempted to make. And it has totally revived my faith in myself. Here's the deal: this is an awesome soup. It's also unbelievably easy to make, even for those of us who are totally culinary impaired. I didn't bother with the honey and accidentally dumped a huge amount of allspice in mine during the cooking process, but it turned out heavenly. Very thick, very rich. I deliberately added lots of lemon juice (love it), and was glad I did. Four forks, easily. I didn't measure my ingredients -- no measuring implements -- but had 1 lb of carrots to start with. It ended up being a little thick (I may have over-simmered) so I had to add in lots more chicken stock during the blending process. It also made enough to give me at least two full meals, as the soup is very, very filling and just bursting with flavour. So to all of you nervous new cooks out there: dive in! This one is a beauty, and so, so easy to make.

Rating: 4
Really, really good. I used ground cumin, and more of it and the allspice than the recipe called for, to taste. Spices went in with the carrots so I could assess flavor as it cooked. (The previous reviewer's complain of blandness is totally understandable if the recipe were followed to the letter.) Also added some ground ginger. It does take quite a bit of S&P, thanks to the sweetness of the carrots plus the honey, but despite that I don't think I'd skip the honey in future batches. Yum!

I loved this recipe! It is not too labor intensive but the results are exceptional! I used plain greek yogurt as the topping and the tang of the yogurt complemented the soup very well.

This is a very easy and delicious soup to pull together quickly on a weeknight with few ingredients. I increased the onions and carrots and added just enough chicken broth to cover them while they boiled (took 30+ min for the carrots to soften enough). Then used an immersion blender in the pot and added about 1/2 a can of light coconut milk to add creaminess. I also subbed curry powder for the allspice. The toasted cumin is a nice addition to the top (didn't use yogurt because coconut milk was enough).

Wonderful soup! Made it exactly as written, and with vegetable broth. No difference Very easy to do. Toasting and grinding the cumin seeds definitely makes a difference in the fresh taste. Used it as a soup shot, put greek yogurt in a squeeze bottle to make a lovely circular design, then sprinkled with the cumin. So pretty!

Rating: 4
This recipe surprised me! The real charm in this dish is the added yogurt and cumin. I tasted the soup before it and thought, well, that's good, but it's really just some buttery carrots. Then I added some greek yogurt and just a splash of cumin to the soup and it was wonderful. I didn't add any pepper or salt and I thought it was perfect. This dish was healthy, delicious and might even be medicinal - my heartburn disappeared after eating it.

i picked this recipe because my husband isn't a fan of ginger (a carrot's best friend). it was a big hit with both him and my 2-year-old (who lip-smacked his way through bowl #2). the more i ate it, the more i liked it - and the yogurt is a must!

Rating: 4
This was such a light and refreshing soup. It is absolutely perfect for summer and its delicateness revved my appetite in anticipation for the main meal. Rather than filling me up and making me wish I hadn't had any so I would actually have room for the main meal, my stomach and taste buds were stimulated. It's incredibly simple to make but tastes very fancy. The texture was heavenly because it was pureed, but tiny spicules of carrot remain, just big enough for the tongue to recognize as particles but just small enough to still feel smoothly soupy at the same time. It's like you can almost register it but not quite, so you semi-register particles, and this is a large part of making the soup so enticing, and makes you anticipate each additional spoonful and food dish.

Rating: 3
Wonderful! Even better the day after when flavors blended. The day I made it for dinner, the level of sweetness was perfect. Day after for breakfast, I thought it was a little too sweet, so I would adjust honey amount depending on when you'll eat most of it, but that could just be because I don't like my breakfast to be sweet. Also, I didn't "drizzle" the yogurt or "sprinkle" the cumin  I stirred everything into it, and it was great that way. I also used a hand blender, although splattering does occur.

Rating: 4
I really like this soup. I used all the ingredients and followed all the directions precisely. When adjusting the seasoning, I did add a bit more lemon juice. Those who think this is bland or sweet probably did not use enough salt and pepper. It takes quite a bit. Made with Kitchen Basics low-salt chicken stock, my soup needed 3/4 t salt and 1/4 t pepper. The toasted cumin and the yogurt gave so much character to the dish. They are essential to it's overall yumminess. Really, I didn't know how carrot soup would fly at my dinner table, but my kids gobbled it up, and I went back for seconds.

This was really delicious, though I did make a few changes...I didn't have cumin seeds, so I added in the same amount of cumin after the carrots had softened. I also added a generous amount of minced garlic, five peppercorn pepper and a bit of sea salt, all of which added more depth to the flavors. All in all, a really good soup.

I liked this a great deal, although I did make several deviations from the recipe-as-written. I increased the carrots & broth, went easy on the honey, and swapped garam masala for the allspice. Also, I had no yogurt, so to make it creamy (and more filling) I added a pair of hard-boiled eggs and some white beans before putting in the food processor.

I had some extra carrots in the fridge, and thought I would try this for dinner tonight. I liked that it was a soup that didn't take too long, but I had to change a lot of things as I went. I realized after I poured the stock that I added to much... so I added a cup of yogurt to the soup and used my immersion blender. I added some extra honey, and cinnamon, because I found the soup just a little to tart for my liking. It wasn't bad, but I probably won't make this again.

Another thumbs up for this recipe! Sometimes carrot soup can be too sweet and one dimensional but this one is a winner. The feshly toasted and ground cumin seed is far surperior to the pre-ground and the lemon juice gives it a real lift! Like a couple of other people, I also added some fresh minced ginger to the carrots and onions during cooking. I skipped the allspice and the honey, and used 50% chicken stock and 50% water to really let the carrots shine!

This soup is simple and delicious. I made it for the first course of dinner for company and my guests really enjoyed it. The toasted cumin is the key for giving it exceptional flavor. I did add about a tsp. of fresh, minced ginger when I cooked the carrots. Last night, we ate the left overs cold.

So easy to make and very satisfying! I was a little wary of the simplicity + a reviewer's mention that it tasted more like a "Mexican soup" (I am not a fan of Latin soups, usually), but this was quite yummy. The toasted cumin lends a mature, smoky taste that places the soup far out of the realm of Mexican soup and I suggest furthering that with some toasted walnuts and a sprinkling of manchego cheese. Some changes I'd make: for a sharper contrast, sour cream might serve better than the yogurt. Also, leaving the soup a little chunky gives delightful texture.

This was really tasty! I love putting carrots in soup. Here's a recipe I just did for a refreshing RAW Coconut Carrot Ginger Soup. It's beyond easy to make and so delicious!! http://hotandhealthyliving.com/2010/05/raw-coconut-carrot-ginger-soup/

Loved the soup and my reluctant lunch guest (sister) was not tempted by carrot soup but she said it didn't taste like carrots. I used greek yogurt to add the creaminess. Did not roast cumin seeds due to lack of spice grinder... next time I'll up the spice and maybe try some cayenne. I did add a garlic clove. 8 year old daughter finished the bowl but did not rave. ONly made it through with tasty bread for dipping. Loved using my hand held blender - makes soup a cinch.

Light tasting yet filling. Great flavor and very healthy. Serving size is really only 2 full size bowls.

Excellent recipe! It's simple to make, nutritious and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly then drizzled a little honey on top along with the yogurt and cumin . Will absolutely make this again and double it! Thank you

Delicious! My guests said it didn't taste very carrot-y and more like sweet potato or squash. The amount of carrots vs the amount of stock make a very richly textured soup and the lemon/honey and allspice tweak the soup from the traditional carrot soup. The cool yogurt and cumin are the perfect compliment for this hearty, warm soup.

Wonderful. I added one garlic clove and that's the only change. I made pear cardamom scones (cooking light) to go with it and that was perfect. The toasted cumin is fabulous on top. I liked it so much I am making a second batch to freeze so I can have a bowl on the fly.

Quite tasty, and super easy! I used vegetable broth since I was cooking for a vegetarian, still delicious!

Very tasty! I followed recipe - except: *Added one garlic clove. *Left out the honey, after tasting, felt the carrots I used were sweet enough.

A wonderful recipe! I doubled it and it served 4 very nicely. Added a couple of cloves of minced garlic and stirred maybe a rounded quarter teaspoon of the roasted cumin into the soup. Both were recommend by other reviewers and were good ideas. The roasted cumin was fabulous, very little trouble to make and it really adds something extra. I will make this again and again.

i've made this twice already, and passed it along to friends who have all made it. soooo good! it's hard to believe how easy and inexpensive it is. i used ground cumin and also added a little cayenne (we like things spicy). i mixed the yogurt in, and also added about 4 oz of cream cheese. i know that makes it less healthy, but it makes it so nice and creamy. this is definitely a new dinner staple for me!

i make a similar and delicious soup...try substituting some grated fresh ginger for the spices and substitue 1/4 cup of orange juice for the stock at the end to make orange ginger carrot soup. i had this soup at uncle rudy's run by an ashram near woodstock many years ago, loved it and made a facsimile of it as above.

I love this soup. Wouldn't change a thing....

This was amazing, and I just used regular ground cumin from the grocery store. I also omitted the allspice as my husband isn't a fan. The only problem was that it didn't make very much soup. I served three for a light dinner and the portions were very small. Perfect, perhaps, for two. Next time I will double the recipe.

I'm a big fan of carrot soup and was excited to try this recipe. It was super easy and had a very nice flavor profile. For those that resist taking out the blender, an immersion blender works just fine. Also I simply used a meat mallet to break down the allspice.

This truly was a fantastic soup and I would definitely make it again! I used Olive Oil instead of Butter, added 2 garlic cloves after the onion had cooked down and used already ground cumin and it turned out so fantastic. Make sure to add the plain yogurt, it was the perfect finish. Plus, it made it look really pretty!

My Dad made this soup at my house a few weeks ago. We were already having antipasti and an Italian pasta, so, although the soup was very good, it didn't really match our meal. I made it again tonight for my family along with lamb chops and a Moroccan couscous. It was wonderful! This is a very fresh, flavorful and EASY soup.

Execellent! The true test is when my BFF loves it and wants me to make it again!

This was outstanding and so easy! I had to run an errand, so instead of boiling the carrots, I threw all of the spices into my steamer with the carrots. When I came home the carrots were tender and ready to go into the pot for completion. My husband loved it too. Definitely on our favorite meal menu!

OMG - so delicious!! the only thing I didn't have was plain yogurt so I used sour cream which was equally as delicious! I would definitely make this again.

Amazeballs!! I just made this thinking it would be a nice little thing to try for lunch. Wow was I totally blow away by how delicious this is. Its amazing, and then suddenly you get a spoonful with a little yogurt on it and it takes it to a whole new place. I can't wait to make this again. And it is absolutely beautiful. This will definitely be on a very fancy dinner party menu soon. And as everyone else noted it is SUPER EASY.

Wonderful! So rich and creamy even before any milk product was added. What a great way to get more veggies into your system! I also used 0% greek strained yogurt when I served it and I did roast and grind the cumin seeds as directed. This will become a new staple in my kitchen!

Very simple to make. Tasty. Chose to mix the yogurt and cumin into the soup which I would repeat in the future. My husband, who said he didn't want to eat carrot soup, ended up liking it more than I. He couldn't believe he was eating carrots.

Super simple, and a hit with everyone. I actually did go to the trouble of toasting and grinding the cumin seeds, and I'd have to say, it was worth it. I used Fage greek-style yogurt to top it off. I served it along with olive bread and stuffed grape leaves. Very nice easy supper.

Very good, wonderful flavour, only change I made was to add a bit of honey to yogurt swirl. 'Roasted' cumin really boosted the flavour.

This soup was great! It was suprisingly filling and the yogurt was a great addition. I used regular cumin and wasn't disappointed. I would definitely make it again.

Incredibly easy and delicious. Everyone gobbled it up. I had to make it again a few days later and the second time I doubled it!

I hate to give this 2 forks, but I was unhappy with the added yogurt. This soup would go great as a small app before a large meal. The flavors are intense, but I couldn't handle more thatn 3 or 4 spoonfuls.

I made this soup exactly as directed and I thought it was delicious. Toasting the cumin seeds and grinding them fresh like that REALLY made a difference. I don't even like honey, but I used it...still thought it was good!

Was enough for two main servings. Quick, simple.

I did buy the seeds, toast and grind them and I don't think it's any better than sprinkling powdered over your soup. I LOVED this and had it for lunch every day after until gone. The greek yogurt is a bit sour alone I think but great in this and very healthy. My carrots took much longer than said to get soft. I wish I would have started it earlier would be my only tip. Enjoy!!!!

My boyfriend made this for me, and it was heavenly! The rich and creamy carroty base pops with the addition of toasted cumin.

Fabulous light soup. 1 lb of carrots doesn't exactly come out to 2 2/3 cups, tho. I'd say a pound is about right, but that's about 5 cups. I was too lazy to buy, toast, and grind cumin seeds (seriously?). I also doubled or tripled the allspice. Served with olive bread and additional yogurt and cumin on the side. Very nice light dinner.

Simple and excellent. Can be served alongside a very spicy main course, or simply with pita chips or other bread.
