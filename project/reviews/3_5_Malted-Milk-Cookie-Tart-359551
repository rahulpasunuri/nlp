I made this exactly as written. It was really good. I would make it again with some slight changes. I think I would like to add more depth of flavor to it. Possibly using white and brown sugar. Or maybe a little vanilla.

The taste was pretty good but the amount of salt ruined it for me. My friends enjoyed it though. I would back off next time. I used a whole bag of the bittersweet chocolate chips, otherwise, didnt change a thing.

Sweet, very sweet, but very easy and kid-friendly.

This was a hit at our 4th of July cookout. Everyone wanted the recipe. I made it a day ahead and cut into small wedges just before serving.I used Horlick's malted milk powder (found at Cost Plus World Market). I also used a 9" tart pan as specified, but I think next time I will use my 10" (just because I have one and would like a bit thinner crust).

This was extremely easy to make - the crust was ready to go in the oven before the oven light went off! The final result was delicious, with a very slight salty taste that would appeal to people who like peanut brittle. This is a recipe I featured on my blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins.

Fantastic! Very easy and as a friend put it ... "addictive". The perfect ending to anything from a BBQ to a Thursday night dinner.
