Love this recipe. I make no changes except doubling the amount of carrots. Love the beans, love the sauce. Easy and filling.

This is excellent, though not quite a four-forker. I followed the recipe to the letter, though I halved it, in terms of quantity. My husband loved the sauce. When I tasted said sauce still in the pot, I thought it might be a bit too tart, like some other cooks here. But combined with the fish and the beans, it was perfect. So why not four forks? Perhaps this is because I halved the recipe, but I couldnt get it to make a perfect puree in the food processor, even with the addition of a bit more water. So the sauce was a bit rugged. I agree with those who have pointed out the brilliance of the lemon zest in the beans. Fantastic! Perhaps those who were less than enthusiastic about the flavor of the beans left that out or were less than generous with the zest.

I give it 3 1/2 forks. I made if for dinner guests and we all loved it. I hate mushy beans so I would never consider using canned for this. With the dried Great Northerns the dish was perfect. It also went very well with zucchini carpaccio also on this site.

Do you see were it says sun dried tomato sauce click on it and there is your tomato!

I don't know about the other reviewers, but I don't see anywhere where there are sun-dried tomatoes in this recipe. I was searching for an ahi tuna recipe, and this sounded good, but from what I'm looking at, there are no tomatoes at all listed in the ingredients, so I'm hesitant to make it. If anyone knows where the tomatoes fit in, let me know because I'd love to try this recipe!

We loved this recipe. To those commenting about mushy beans, make sure you're not overcooking them. I used canned beans an had no trouble.

Terrific combination of flavors. A touch of fresh, finely minced dill sprinkled on just before serving adds a nice additional taste to this recipe. Organic red kidney beans work as a good substitute for the white, adding both a beautiful color and rich flavor. Also, the sun-dried tomato sauce goes great with a beef or pork tenderloin.

I've made this three or four times now, it is great! tonite I did just the tuna and sauce, I think I prefer it that way....but the white beans are great too. Good on their own. There are a lot of variables in this recipe having to do with ingredients.... the type of sun-dried tomatoes and vinegar will really affect the flavor. That said, even with average ingredients, this is excellent!!! We live in 'Florida where you can find the freshest seafood and plenty of four-star chefe, but I haven't had anything better in a restaurant. One of the best dishes I have ever made, with just the tuna and sauce.

Excellent recipe. I doubled the amount of beans and corresponding ingredients. I made this for family and friends and everyone loved it. A definite keeper.

This is a big favorite at our house--I've made it a bunch of times already, and it's perfect for a dinner party. For the cook concerned with Kashrut, switch to vegetable broth rather than omitting it altogether. On canned beans: if you use organic (I get Westbrae Natural Great Northerns from Whole Foods here in Brighton), the consistancy is quite good--better than I can usually manage cooking the beans myself.

I had expected more of this dish. I thought the beans were rather uninteresting. They definitely needed some garlic or lemon juice or so. And the tomato sauce also fell short of my expectation; it was a bit salty and too creamy. I don't know, I might try this one again and I might not. A bit of a disappointment.

Fabulous...but of course you do have to have some cooking skill with freash tuna so you don't pulverize it in to tough dry shoe-leather. The beans are brilliant and the sundried tomatoe sauce is genious paired with this dish. Signed, Sharon A Minneapolis Chef

We LOVED-LOVED-LOVED this recipe. So delicious! Addition of lemon zest to beans is pure genious. : ) However, did have to make beans twice since first batch turned to mush somewhere between 40 minutes and 60 minutes (which was surprising given package directions indicated a cooking time of 90 minutes!) Nevertheless, cooking beans twice was worth the effort.

This is scrumptious, along with the the sun- dried tomato sauce recipe. I spooned some sauce under the fish as well and rice served with it absorbs any extra sauce nicely. Thanks Jeff.

I have one comment to the cook from Berkeley, CA who gave this recipe a negative review on 07/06/01... Since your complaining about the consistency, I would discourage the use of canned beans, and make sure you get the right kind. Canned beans are almost always mushy, and if you erroneously buy cannelini beans for example, they'll be even mushier. Use dried, great white northern beans as called for by the recipe. --- I have not made this recipe yet, but I think I will try even though the sun-dried tomato sauce makes me nervous.

This was good! Disclaimer - since I am on a Die-with-a-T and a picky eater, the changes below did not turn this into a bland depressing recipe, but very tasty and light. To save calories I just used a scant amount of olive oil when sauteeing the veggies for the beans and half & half instead of cream for the sauce. 2 TB of the resulting sauce was plenty.

Very nice meal. The beans can be prepared ahead of time, eliminating much of the prep work.

Excellent! Would definitely make this again. I plan to use the sauce for other purposes--perhaps chicken? Sun-dried tomatoes do vary greatly in flavor--make sure to use the very best oil-packed kind.

I had high hopes for this recipe as I have loved every highly reviewed recipe on this site so far, but I was VERY disappointed!! I would give it less than a 1 if I could. Like most everyone else, I did use canned beans to save time, but I think it just added to the overall mushy, yucky quality of the dish. I cut the thyme by a third because it is not a favored spice, but it was still too much and overpowered the other flavors, what little other flavor there was. I was expecting a flavorful tomato sauce, but it was bland. Overall it was a big waste of time for an expensive piece of fish.

Great recipe!!! I used canned beans to save time, and made the tomato sauce from scratch using "oven-dried" tomatoes--slice roma tomatoes in half, salt and let stand for one-hour. Place tomatoes in the oven at 300 degrees for 3-4 hours.

This was a great hit. The beans and the sauce made the presentation look as good as it tasted. I will try and adapt the sauce for a lighter version. A great recipe for entertaining.

This was much better than I was expecting. It all goes together perfectly. Using canned beans makes the meal easier to make, and doesn't take away from the flavor in my opinion. Just put them in a strainer and rinse off the goop that they're packed in, and boil them for a few minutes in one can of chicken broth.

We really liked the tuna and the bean mixture. My sun-dried tomato sauce was horrible. We grilled the tuna. We also used canned beans and thought they were super. I think the beans needed a bit of lemon juice. I will definitely make again but look for a different, lighter sauce.

There are sundried tomatoes in this recipe. It's highlighted and underlined.

this recipe says sundried tomatoes? No place in the ingredients has them? Too bad...sounded like a good recipe......

My husband and I made this last night and it went beyond our expectations. We did decide to throw the tuna on the gril for a leaner version of this dish. The sauce was delicious! I think that I'll try it with pasta and chicken.

This one's a KEEPER! Like all white bean recipes I save time and get great results with canned beans. Also use sushi grade tuna if available and cook 90 seconds per side for rare.

I made this recipe twice and still feel the same way. It was not a difficult recipe, just a bit time consuming. It seemed like I had alot of dishes to wash!? It was a tasty dish and I favor a sushi grade tuna as I don't like dry, overcooked fish.

This dish was fantastic, my very picky husband LOVED it. The flavors are an incredible compliment to each other. I made this dish another time with chicken because the ahi tuna was so expensive; not quite as special but still pretty good.

If there was ever a 4 four fork recipe, this is it! I used canned beans and half & half instead of whipping cream for the calorie watch. Our tastebuds had a party!

It was delicious!! A little time consuming but definitely worth it. I used canned beans to elminate the overnight process. I made this recipe for two but didn't cut the sun-dried tomato sauce. So I tossed the left over sauce with pasta and served it as a side. Terrific!!
