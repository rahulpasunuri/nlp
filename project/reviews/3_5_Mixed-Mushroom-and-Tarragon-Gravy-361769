Coached my kids through this recipe to go with grilled turkey Christmas Eve. It was delicious. One note, if you have never hydrated dried porcinis before (I hadn't), be prepared for the smell. The balance in the recipe was very rich, though, and perfect on the turkey.

Not the simplest recipe but well worth the work. I recommend adding 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of ground mustard seed for added dimension. Take care to use a decent sherry or dry white wine. (Don't ever use anything overtly labeled "cooking sherry" or "cooking wine". That's code for "really awful swill"!)

Best gravy I have ever tasted. Really delicious.

This too was part of the fabulous Thanksgiving dinner by Fourth Daughter. THis also struck me as the base for a fantastic mushroom soup. I'm going to have to try that, too.

Very good. As I do the bulk of cooking Thanksgiving dinner, I found this recipe to be very helpful and eased the last-minute preparations. I made the recipe exactly as written, using chicken broth, and it was delicious and consistency was perfect. Only change I'd make would be to use less mushrooms when serving with turkey.

Spectacular. Made exactly as written, it's luscious and flavorful.

I really liked this recipe, and specially the part of making it a day ahead. I also needed to add a spoon of corn starch to thicken the sauce but it turned out very nice, no left overs!

My family thought it was GREAT. Followed directions (even made/used the Ultimate Turkey Stock recipe) made it a day ahead, reheated and it was perfect. Makes a huge amount so I have some to use later - delicious.

Great if you like mushroom soup - bu it's not the gravy I was looking for!

I loved the idea of making this ahead of time and it is delicious but I don't think I like it with "Traditional Thanksgiving Dinner" It would be great on pork or beef!

I used .5 oz of dried mushrooms in one cup of hot water, about 1/2 cup of vermouth, and a homemade/boiled down turkey stock, fresh herbs, and haven't even added the tarragon yet but this stuff is AMAZING. I did need to add more cornstarch to get it to a thickness I wanted, but otherwise, yum!

I was told this was the best gravy people had ever tried. I used regular (non-dried) mushrooms and sauteed them all together. I used white wine and half and half (instead of creme fraiche) and it turned out great. I made the ultimate turkey stock first and let it simmer for 2 1/2 hours. The flavor from the stock really added to the gravy. I doubled the recipe for a party with 25 people and had more than enough. I'm sharing this recipe with half of the guest list by request!

I used white wine, chicken broth and homemade creme fraiche.Thought the gravy was a little watery and did not have the flavor intensity we were hoping for. I thought it needed more salt which is usually a sign that something else is missing.I might make it again with some tweaking but it's pretty expensive to be less than stellar.
