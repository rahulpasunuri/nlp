Wrong, on so many levels. Just wrong. Look for other recipes for why.

I don't know but this recipe should not be on the Epicurious site...it should be on the recipe rejects site. After tasting this chopped liver enomily I decided it was NOT FOR ME so I tried giving it to my dog Muffy and he gently gnawed on a bit. I tell you...after it dawned on him that this chopped liver isn't even fit for a dog...he took one whiff of it and ran. I have NEVER seen anything like it. I have never seen my dog run so fast. They say a dog is man's best friend but, after giving him a taste test of this chopped liver, I'm not so sure he considers me a friend anymore. UGH!!!

Doesn't taste like grandma's. If you're Jesish don't bother with this one.
