My neighbor gave me 6 lbs of rose hips. I divided them into 2 pots and covered them with water (approximately 6 cups each pot). I then followed some of the recipe. Boiled for 3 hours and let sit over night in a strainer (well several). I ended up with 6 cups of juice. I again divided the juice into 2 pots and added 5 cups of sugar per pot, bring to boil and boiling full blast add 1 package of pectin, bring back to boil (I did not add apple juice, I wanted the true flavor of rose hips). Processed in hot water bath. I think it turned out fine, now onto making rose hip syrup. Very much like a rose flavored honey.

I would like to know the quantity of rose hips. Is it 1 3/4 cups or pounds or 1 3/4 rose hips themselves.
