This is the definitive way to grill corn. After trying various methods over the years with mixed results I gave this a try. Be sure to leave the stems intact to use as "handles" for turning the corn on the grill. I did de-silk the corn first: the work is peeling off the layers of husk. Pulling off the silk takes about 1 second. I think soaking the husks was the key because the corn cooked more slowly and did not catch fire. Finishing it off directly on the grill without the husk gave a wonderful caramel taste. I went ahead and cooked up all the corn and now I'm going to make chowder with the left overs.

Took the advice of previous reviewers, and didn't bother with the preliminarey desilking. Did soak first, to keep the husks from burning. Didn't even need butter. This is the way we love to eat the first good corn of the summer.

In Japan they have neighborhood evening street fairs. One of my favorite treats was eating corn on the cob with soy sauce drizzled on for the last minute or so of grilling. Different and delicious

I do soak the corn but it really is not necessary to remove the silk first as it pulls easily back once the corn has been grilled. When you pull back the husk with the silk, just fold it over the stem and you have a handle to hold your corn. No fuss, no mess and delicious grilled corn!

I JUST THROW IT ON THE GRILL. I make this corn about 3 times a week when in season. But, quite honestly...I dont see the need to pre-husk or soak. Grill over a low flame without messing with it at all. When the husk is black on one side, you are done. Let it sit out for 3-5 minutes and let it cool. Then husk with your hands and eat. No dishes, no cleanup...just the husk in the compost.

It was very convenient to be able to find directions for what turned out to be a rather simple procedure. I used my broiler and it worked great. This will be my new standard way of making corn!

I have prepared corn both ways as commented. Both ways are equally good. By soaking the corn first the husk does come off easier and the corn is tender and juicy. But cooking the corn over the grill gives it a really nice smoky flavour. Pare it with some of the really nice butters available for corn and you will have an incredible feast!

This method works fine. But it's even easier to peel the corn completely, spread with butter and the spices you like, then grill over relatively high heat. Turn the corn when you hear a few kernels pop. No soaking necessary. It's done when the kernels are nicely browned in spots--no more than ten minutes.

This is a great way to prepare corn on the cob. Tastes delicious, easy to make and the flavor isn't boiled away. It's also an easy method if you're grilling anyway!
