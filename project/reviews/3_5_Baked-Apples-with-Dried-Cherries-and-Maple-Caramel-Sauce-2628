This was "nice" recipe. One may want to cover the dish during baking so that the cherries don't carmelize and get "chewy." I used "Kirsh" since I couldn't find cherry brandy. Would be a great dessert for a dinner party.

I had it in the oven when my stock group showed up, and they all raved about the scent. I think it would be a good thing to have in the oven when you have your house up for sale and folks are expected to "walk through!" As far as the recipe is concerned, I think I will press out as much of the liquid as possible from the "soaked" cherries--I thought the pot liquor (i.e., the caramel sauce) was a bit runny. I'd have preferred the sauce to be more caramel-thick. But what a flavor--yum! I don't usually use frozen yogurt, but the richness of the sauce's flavor needs the slight tanginess of the frozen yogurt, in my opinion. This is a definite keeper recipe!

Absolutely yummy. Absolutely easy. Served with ice cream instead of frozen yogurt. I just poured the sauce over the apples before baking and didn't bother with basting and still it turned out great.

This recipe is great. You can make it ahead of time and then just warm it up during dinner. Very tasty

Delicious! These flavors really work together. If you haven't tried sour cherries and tart apples together - do, it's classic. And the smell of the apples while they are baking will make a bland dinner taste even better!
