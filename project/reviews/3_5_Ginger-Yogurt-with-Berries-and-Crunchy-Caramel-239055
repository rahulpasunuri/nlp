A hit with my guests after a meal of pork and other filling items. I can't imagine this working with anything other than zero fat Greek yogurt. I did sub regular minced ginger for crystallized ginger, but I only used about 2 T., and didn't find it overpowering. I liked this but was a little disappointed that the carmel gets so hard at the end. I would have enjoyed a softer caramel.

This is wonderful, and is now a staple of our brunches. It is easy to make and delicious. When I made it today I had, for the first time, some trouble with the caramel  I think it's important to wait to make sure the sugar is mostly dissolved before raising the heat. I've never had trouble with the yogurt separating, as other reviewers mentioned.

1 - Make sure you choose a familiar brand of yogurt (the organic variety I used separated big time. 2 - mince the ginger up as finely as you possibly can, and use way less or it becomes hot, medicinal and overpowering (maybe my candied ginger was extra fresh and hot) 3 - combination of textures is lovely: creamy yogurt, soft nubbly berries and hard crunchy shards of caramel. This is worth trying again with less ginger and a non- separating yogurt.

The yogurt was outstanding! I was looking for something to serve with macerated fruit and granola at brunch and this was much better than expected. I added some honey and ginger syrup to the yogurt, but it was also fine without. It is especially good with white peaches.

I didn't have access to good quality yogurt, much less Greek- style, so I substituted vanilla pudding. Although the result was, no doubt, entirely different in flavor from the original recipe, it was deemed outstanding by my dinner companions.

Splendid. Super easy and pleasing to both adults and children (because of the 'candy' content!). My ginger did not flavour the yogurt very well - probably a bit old. I strained out the ginger pieces for those who would not like the texture. I will make this often for brunches or a summer dessert.

This is astonishingly good. Had it at a brunch yesterday, and it was the hit of the day. Delightful!
