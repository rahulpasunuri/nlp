This certainly was beautiful but the flavors of the sauce don't have time to penetrate the ingredients. If I make it again, I'll make the filling the day before. Tip - butter your hands and gently scrunch the filo into balls. It's faster and easier.

The more I make this recipe, the more we like it. The sautéing the chicken and the prosciutto is great; use the phyllo (not biscuits). I have a hard time finding the porcini mushrooms at my grocery, for some reason, but I've found that using regular mushrooms and beef consomme for the soaking liquid at least gives me some of the richer flavor that is missing without the porcini.

This is a great recipe that is poorly written, IMO. Those people who suggested browning chicken (breast or thigh) with the proscuitto...yes, do that. Mushrooms... you can't brown 2 lbs. of mushroom in 8 minutes. At 8 minutes you still have 1/4 cup of liquid bubbling away. It takes about 18 minutes to start browning. At 18 min. add the garlic, and I add 1T of garlic paste. Mushrooms are brown when they are brown, not at 8 minutes. The same with the chicken. Cut it into bite sized pieces and saute until it starts to brown. How long...? when the liquid boils away and it starts to brown! I use titanium cookware and it gets HOT. Things are done when they are done, not in X minutes. If you have runny liquid after the corn starch step, you're not done that step. The "liquid" should be thick. Consider using a butter spray from a can for the Phyllo dough...faster, more efficient. This is a very tasty recipe, especially after you bring out the essence of the wild mushrooms by browning. Also, if you cook with Riesling, drink the Riesling. Enough. Read More http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/notes/Chicken-and-Mushroom-Pie-with-Phyllo-Parmesan-Crust-231598#ixzz0pGonSSg2

I took some of the other reviews to heart and used about 3/4 cup less of the chicken broth and sauteed the chicken thigh pieces with the proscuitto. Both were good ideas. This was delicious but almost too rich - I think next time I will use chicken breast instead of thighs. I cheated with the phyllo preparation and it worked great - instead of separating the sheets (which I hate and always mess up), I just left them in a stack and brushed the melted butter on the top sheet, wadded it into a ball, then kept working my way down through the sheets. I ended up tossing the last 5 or 6 sheets, but who cares.

I selected this recipe for a class lab. We subsituted the phyllo for a cheese biscuit, which we made into slightly flattened balls and placed on top of the mushroom-chicken base. Some reviews say that it's too liquidy, but I think that the biscuits went well with the sauce and so the excess liquids weren't much of a problem. We did cook the chicken first (we used chicken breast instead of thighs, and diced the chicken) in a frying pan before placing it into a casserole dish, which sped up the baking time a lot (we did not have to leave it in for the extra time in the reduced oven temperature as it says on the recipe.) Because we made it in class, our teacher did not approve of the white wine and therefore brought us white cooking wine. Because of the large amount of sodium in cooking wine, we reduced the sodium elsewhere in the recipe. I found the taste to be enjoyable, it wasn't too sweet or tangy. The taste of lemon and thyme stood out. I would make this recipe again.

I love mushrooms, and I loved the flavor of this dish. However I think next time I will dice the chicken thighs and brown with proscuitto as recommeded by Colorado Springs to give the meat more flavor. The broth was so yummy, but thin, like broth, so I think after simmering I'll put it in individual crocks and top with a cut pastry sheets instead of phyllo and/or a slice of cheese ala french onion soup. Will definitely make again.

Want to make this this weekend. Just want to know if you would brown the thighs as well as the breasts?

This turned out pretty well for me, but I was looking for a chicken pie recipe and approached it accordingly: I omitted the phyllo and used premade crusts with parmesean, browned and shredded the thighs, and seasoned to taste rather than relying on the recomendations. I also used a dehydrated wild mushroom mixture and soaked it in chicken broth. A quarter-cup of flour worked as a thickener. Instead of slicing the button (or crimini) mushrooms, I halved them for better texture. This recipe would work well with myriad substitutions: red for white wine, different mixtures of mushrooms, roasted red peppers, chard, spinach, or browned, cubed eggplant could all be added to good affect.

It was quite bland. Needs LOTS of salt and pepper, and LOTS of parmesan cheese.

I've made this dish twice. The first time, I didn't scrunch up the phyllo; I laid it over the top like a pot pie. The sauce was very thick, and the flavor was very good. Guests could eat the dish with a fork. The second time, I baked the phyllo flowers separately and guests put them atop the casserole. I also cut up the thighs into bite-sized pieces and browned them on the stovetop, along with the prosciutto before baking. The sauce was very thin, almost broth-like. Bowls and spoons were necessary. The next time, I will cook the recipe on top of the stove with dumplings to absorb some of the liquid and bypass the oven completely.

Rating: 2
This dish is a little different than what I thought it would be, but still great. I thing it is important to use thighs, as they are moister in the finished casserole. You definately have to like mushroom flavor, I would use this recipe for a "pot-luck" since it looks so impressive, and tastes good too.

I did think that this would be a quick & easy option for a midweek family dinner, however my family found it to be rather stodgy and the leftovers sat around so long that they were finally tossed out - not a good sign in my household - left-over dinner is a breakfast favourite here. I think adapting this to a more tradtional pot pie would probably be better recieved - next time I would use a puff pastry crust and I would reduce the amount of liquid in the sauce.

Bland, though the chicken was very tender. I will not make this again.

Rating: 2
Great flavor, especially the touch of lemon to lighten up the earthy mushroom flavor. My biggest complaint is that it is too soupy. I would recommend cutting back on the broth...although I haven't experimented to what level. Also, I agree with the reviewer who suggested letting the mixture cool before topping with the phyllo so as to prevent the bottoms getting too soupy. However, this may then require cutting the chicken into smaller pieces to allow for proper cooking. In fact, smaller pieces of chicken is a good idea to keep this a one-utensil dinner. I did think it was good enough to serve at a casual dinner party, but I most likely won't choose to make it again.

We really liked the flavor in the dish and how tender the chicken was when it cooked in the sauce. I don't think I let the corn starch mixture cook enough on its on because the dish was a little soupy. It was still very good though. We used biscuits instead of the phyllo dough due to the reviews on how doughy it was in others' dishes. We are going to make this again but maybe with some egg noodles, seems like a stroganoff type of gravy.

I've made this recipe two times and think it is delicious (leftovers are not that great). The mushroom sauce is rich and flavorful. I use chicken breasts, cut into small chunks, and add them to the sauce when I am reheating it (I make it earlier in day). That ensures the meat is completely done in the baking time given.

I made this dish for a friend's birthday party and people attending enjoyed it very much. I didn't use parmesan cheese though... instead I used Kasseri cheese which has a more robust flavor that adds a great intensity with the dish. I also suggest adding Kasseri with the potatos! Yum!

First time I had this dish I split it in half. Half I made with phyllo. I must have got some old phyllo because the flavor was odd. The other half I made with crepes which worked out very nicely. I didn't like the texture of the thighes. My friend made this with breasts and biscuits on top and I thought it was a lot better. I will make this again because I really liked the flavor, but I will use breasts and crepes.

I'm having troubles with all the negative reviews. The only substitution that I made was to use chicken breasts. Served it for a women's gormet dinner group and everyone loved it. Simple enough for a weekday dinner party right from work. Reheated in the toaster oven and no problem with the phyllo being too tough or doughy.

This recipe felt too "casserole" for my taste. Reminds me something my mom would have cooked in the 70's" for some "pot-luck" dinner. Maybe chase it down with a nice bottle of Lancers while humming Gordon Lightfoot tunes.

This recipe is good however it requires some modifications. Season the chicken thighs with salt and pepper and brown them before adding to the mixture. Also brown the prosciutto before adding. I would omit the lemon peel. In order to ensure that the phyllo balls don't get doughy, make sure that the mushroom mixture has some time to cool in the pan. Otherwise the phyllo will melt into it and turn doughy. Also make sure to sprinkle the parmesan at the very end or else it will burn.

We made this dish to use up leftover turkey breast and meat(white and dark) from a roasted chicken. We enjoyed the flavors and texture very much, and used a combination of Crimini, Button, and Shiitake mushrooms. This was a good alternative to chicken pot pie, and it made great leftovers, although the filo lost it's crunchy texture once refrigerated. Nice with a simple green salad and crusty French bread.

Rating: 3
This is a great cold night mid week dinner, suitable for guests. Leftovers the next night highly improved the flavors, in the future I will make this a day ahead. I used cooked boneless, skinless chicken breast instead of the thighs and sprinkled gorgonzola instead of parmesean.

All the critiques of this recipe are valid. I think you sort of have to look at this as a sophisticated chicken pot pie with an innovative topping and make the revisions accordingly as I did. Saute the vegetables, poach the chicken, thicken the sauce and combine. Bear with me on this version: Saute the mushrooms and garlic, adding the prosciutto for the last 2 minutes. Then add the porcini and their liquid. Saute about 2 minutes. Then add the wine, lemon peel and seasonings.Low simmer about 10 minutes. Do not add the broth. Instead, put your chicken in the 2 cups of broth (white or dark meat or both), simmer 10 minutes and allow to cool in broth 10 minutes. Remove chicken to pan with vegetables and prosciutto, reserving broth. Then melt 3tbls. butter and whisk in 3tbls. flour.( I did not use cornstarch as a thickening agent in this recipe). Stir for 3 minutes. Slowly wisk in the warm reserved broth into butter/flour mixture and cook till thickened avoiding lumps. Add some additional wine to get the consistency you want. Stir this into the vegetable, prosciutto and chicken mixture, put into baking dish and proceed with recipe, except don't put the parmesan cheese on till the last ten minutes of baking. You can avoid soggy phyllo by not saturating it with melted butter (although it needs to be covered), and also this recipe produces less liquid than the original. Hope this helps.

The finished product looked just like the Bon Appetit photo, but I'm not sure it was worth the extra effort. I, too, used boneless chicken breasts and I wished I had used a combination of dark and white meat - for more flavor. The recipe certainly made more than 6 servings - so we had lots of leftovers and the phyllo dough does not reheat very well - it gets tough and dough-like.

I really liked this. Prepared the mushroom sauce Sunday & made it Tues., I think the sauce benefited from sitting - was not a bit runny. The lemon was key, tasted great with the prosciutto. I used breasts and cut into just bigger than bite-sized pieces & it was perfect, did not need to brown. The phyllo was easy and made for a nice presentation...

I followed the instructions exactly.. including the suggestions to serve with whipped mashed potatoes w/ tarragon and roasted green beans. It made a wonderful Sunday dinner with plenty of yummy leftovers for Monday and lunch Tuesday. I will make this again

This recipes is a stunner looks-wise. However, I ended up throwing most of the phyllo topping out, because it was too doughy on the bottom side. I should have browned the chicken, because it needed better texture. Also, the left-overs were overly salty, probably due to all the salt coming out from the proscuitto. The flavor with the original serving was excellent.

Rating: 3
I thought the filling was very tasty, but like others it was very runny (and I did add extra cornstarch and water.) I used boneless breasts and 'poached' them in the liquid before baking, very tender and cooked through. I liked the phyllo as a nice change, but do add the cheese just towards the end. I will try again to get the filling thicker. Definately not a weeknight meal, but not horribly labor intensive.

Used previous suggestions for browning the chicken and the proscuitto first. Tasty dish. Putzy comes from the Yiddish word Putz, which means 'fool', and is also a slang term for the male organ. What it's doing in this venue is anyone's guess.

I made this recipe yesterday and took the advice of browning both the chicken and the prosciutto before adding them to the mushroom mixture. I also waited to add the cheese until 10 minutes prior to being done. It was excellant, nice texture for the meat and not runny at all. I will defintely make this again. Thank you all for your tips.

The flavor of this recipe was very good but after having gotten the sauce thickened, it became runny in the cooking. It tasted good but it was very soupy. I wouldn't make it again as it was. I think it could be helped if it was served on top of some wild rice, perhaps. Or maybe with some nuts, like cashews. I also thought a nice green vegetable would have tasted good in it, like string beans.

This recipe was ok at best...I agree with the other cooks that not browning the chicken gave it a slimy texture. Also, this took a lot of prep time...not enough "bang for your buck" in my opinion. However, the phyllo topping did make for a nice presentation.

I prepared this dish for my annual Valentine's dinner. It got rave reviews! I served it with orzo risotto instead of mashed potatoes and omitted the prosciutto. I prepared the phyllo puffs a few hours ahead of time and covered them with damp paper towels to keep them moist.

I thought this would be terrific, and still think the concept of the crunched up phyllo topping is a great idea. And wild mushrooms and proscuitto all sounded great. But it just didn't wow us. The sauce wasn't thick enough....the chicken needs to be browned first (I used boneless breasts.) I like the concept enough that I will probably adapt it...perhaps as a topping for a more traditional creamed chicken pot pie.

This recipe sounded really good to me but was very disappointed with the finished product. Although it looked gorgeous i was displeased with its overall taste.The mushroom sauce alone tasted really good but i did not care for the chicken thighs in this recipe and the prosciutto was a bit slimy...the underside of the filo dough was also a bit slimy and the parmesan cheese was way overdone...i dont think i would make this again because it just needs too much tweaking to make it right...

This is a great recipe! Not only does it taste great, the presentation is also very impressive. I did make some modifications. I left out the lemon peel and for the phyllo, I sprayed the sheets with PAM instead of brushing them with butter. The only suggestion I have would be to sprinkle the parmesan over the top for the last 5 minutes of baking. If you sprinkle it on at the beginning, it will burn. Otherwise, great recipe!

Tastes were yummy but with a few changes for next time. I would brown the chicken and I'd probably use chicken breasts- just tossing in the thighs was too slimy in texture. I'd also add less lemon zest. But the phylo is a great topper.
