I added extra sea salt for a salted caramel profile, and it turned out beautifully. Nervous about burning the sugar, I think I could have let it carmelize more... Resultant sauce isn't as thick as I'd prefer. Big labor saver and impact to combine with candied tangerine peel recipe and served with the tangerine bavarian. Makes a lot of sauce, consider repurposing for vanilla ice cream topping or to add to a shake. Yum.

This is a light, clear, sauce with a bright fragrant aroma. Made this with a dense almond cake and everyone just raved about it.
