These scones were really delicious, and not dry at all. I did have to use about 1 cup of creme fraiche to get a batter that seemed the right consistency, however. I think the flour/creme fraiche ratio depends on the moisture content in both the flour and creme fraiche. When you add the creme fraiche mixture, if your batter seems too dry to mix, you should add a little more.

I have been making these scones for quite some time now. Everybody loves them, sour cream works just fine in place of the creme fraiche. I also like to add about 1/2 cup of toasted walnuts to the mix.

I'm pretty inimpressed with these. The texture was fine, but they didn't have much flavor. Perhaps some grated orange peel would have helped. It was a waste of expensive creme fraiche.

These are truly delicious scones, moist and delicate. Especially delicious hot out of the oven, but I found that freezing them keeps them quite well. You can thaw them as needed.

These are good - but only when fresh out of the oven... they don't keep well at all.

I had guests over for brunch and made these along with another recipe for "plain" scones. While the others were quickly devored, I ended up with quite a few of these left-over. Clearly, the majority of my guests weren't overly impressed with them. I thought they were too dense and dry, and found them rather uninspiring. Since there are so many other wonderful scone receipes out there, I'll not bother with these again.

I thought the scones were a bit too small, but that problem can easily be solved by having two! I served them with butter whipped with a bit of honey and orange zest.

I did add a little more brown sugar and used dried blueberries...wow...the whole family loved them. Excellent with lemon curd.

Very moist and a big hit. I added chopped pecans and they could use a touch more brown sugar, but they turned out well. They get even more moist after a few days!

I have made these countless times. I, too, really like them for their moistness.

best scone recipe I've found. A few changes made it even better. Add 3/4 cup sour cream, omit the cinnamon, use fresh cranberries. Try other fresh fruit,yummy

This is a keeper. I make my own creme fraiche and use that. I pat dough into two rounds and score them. The scones are exceptionally moist.

I was very pleased by these; they're much moister than many scones. They're not too sweet... I like to sprinkle a decent amount of sugar on top if you won't be serving them with butter or jam...

I left the two rounds whole and just scored it into wedges. It probably didn't dry out as much this way. We also spooned a honey-yogurt dip over them and it was delicious.

These were small in size, but had a wonderful texture and flavor. Would sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar next time.

Scones were small in size. Were dense, not light. Tended to be on dry side.
