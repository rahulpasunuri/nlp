The flavors are wonderful and the rosemary syrup is surprisingly good. The only thing was that this cake came out very dense and I'm not sure whether it was supposed to be that way, or if I did something wrong. I might look for a fluffier cake recipe when I try it again.

Nice, but if I make it again I'll use a finely ground cornmeal. The texture was not to my liking with the coarsely ground stuff. My partner liked it a lot, though.

This was fine. I liked the blackberries, and the rosemary syrup was subtle but a nice touch. On the other hand, the cake was . . . nothing special (and I generally like simple, Italian-style cakes). Will try another recipe for my fresh blackberry harvest next time.

I serve this with a sprig of fresh rosemary on each slice and put the extra syrup into individual ceramic pitchers so each person can add as much as they like. Great make ahead dessert. Guests are always wowed!

This is an easy, fool-proof, elegant dessert, if done correctly. So versatile, too...I can serve this on any weeknight, or after a 10-course gourmet dinner -- doesn't matter. Definitely play with the syrups...the rosemary is great, but I've also made various other infusions -- rosewater, lavender, orange blossom, tarragon and grapefruit, etc. When the occasion calls for it, I'll pipe a flavor-infused heavy cream into florets around the edge, but it's not necessary. As a gourmet chef, this has become my go-to dessert when the timing of a meal is such that I need a dessert with absolutely no last minute preparation. Perfect!

This is so tasty and surprising! I love the bright, lemony, rosemary sweetness with the comforting cornmeal cake . The nice thing about this recipe is that I had all the ingredients in my cupboard and the blackberries were growing wild .

This is lovely and very unusual. I'll second what others have said - don't skip the rosemary syrup. It's not about sweetening the cake, it's what gives it the unique flavor.

Underwhelming. Tastes like a pound cake with addition of cornmeal and faint rosemary scent. Cake took well over 40 min to bake.

The cake was quick and easy and delicious. I did not make the syrup and I'm glad because the cake was plenty rich with butter and sweet enough for sure. Served it with creme fraiche and berries and I will definately make it again. I may even try using less sugar and adding some savoury elements to make more of a cornbread and less a dessert.

This flavors combined in this recipe produce a very interesting, aromatic and tasty dish. I'll definitely make this again.

Delicious! I used this basic cornmeal cake to make mini- muffins for Thanksgiving. Then I added crumbled blue cheese and cranberries and made mini-muffins for a party. Simple, foolproof, great muffins that taste good even several days after baking, after being frozen, after being re-heated in the oven. This is a keeper.

Superb. Different. Company worthy. 3 forks rather than 4 only b/c beyond compare is a very high bar to meet. My hostess served this with the blackberries called for in the recipe (as opposed to other fruits) arranged decoratively on top in concentric circles and lightly sweetened whipped cream.

Immediate recipe request from the friend for whom I made it! Good with blackberries, but perhaps even better with strawberries. I used the extra syrup for drizzle before I served it. I like it fully drenched!

I love this cake. The texture is wonderful , and the flavor divine!

Way over the top! Many, many forks. Do not - DO NOT - miss the syrup. I have served this many times, and always make more syrup. Use the syrup over strawberries, etc.

This was delicious and very easy and my guests loved it. I did double the syrup recipe and was glad I did, as it gave me syrup for the leftovers. I think this cake can serve 8, as it is rich, and so you don't need big slices. If you love blackberries though, I would allow 1/2 pint for each 2 persons, so 2 pints total for 8.

The cornmeal cake came out well. I did not think the rosemary syrup added much flavor. I would not make this recipe again.

It was a bit sweet for me but my husband gave it a 7 1/2 so I will make it again. It's easy and different. I may make it in individual cakes to make it look better. I served it with black bean soup. It was good.

Amazing dessert. Not too sweet - almost savory, and very elegant. I double the rosemary syrup and make sure the blackberries are sweet (and if not mix with some sugar.) It looks great, to boot.

Wow, this is tasty. My 8 inch cake pan was only 1 1/2 inches (not 2), but it just puffed over and worked fine. We used aerosol whipped cream. For leftover cake we used strawberries, and that worked well, but wasn't a special as the blackberries were.

This cake is truly different and amazing. My best friend even requested this as her birthday cake this year since she didn't get enough last time I made it. Try it - it's sophisticated yet simple!!

this is a recipe i have been using ever since it first appeared in '96 (i was 13 years old then!). my family requests i make it for any gathering. for sure it is a trusty reliable. when blackberries are unavailable use razberries (i have even used blueberries and strawberries but i enjoy the black or raz best.

A friend brought this to our dinner party. When she told me what the ingredients were,I was sorry I didn't bake a back up. However, it was a hit all the way around.

This is a fabulous cake, and I am not a good cook! The rosemary syrup is key. Very complex combination of flavors, resulting in a wonderfully elegant dessert. A definite keeper. I will make this one again.

I'm always amazed how great - and easy - this cake is. I've been making it ever since it appeared in Gourmet six years ago. If blackberries are out of season, any berry coulis or melange will do the trick.

Delicious!! One of my favorite recipe for a quick dessert.

Delicious! I made the syrup with two parts rosemary and one part thyme, and it was fabulous. I don't have an electric mixer but this wasn't labor-intensive at all - it's very simple. When I was cooking the syrup my boyfriend said it smelled like he'd died and gone to heaven.

Awesome recipe. The rosemary syrup, odd as it sounds, absolutely makes the dish. One of my neighbors wouldn't let me come over for dinner unless I promised to bring this dessert again.

I have made this cake maybe a dozen times since the recipe was first published. Everyone always raves about it. And SO easy to make! It nevers fails to come out perfectly. Don't be put off by the rosemary, it really works!
