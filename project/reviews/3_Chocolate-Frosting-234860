Great recipe! I used half and half instead of cream and added a 1/2 tsp of salt. It was perfect with the double chocolate cake recipe elsewhere on this website. The combo was great, especially for chocoholics!

This frosting is nice and rich. I added the extra tablespoon of cocoa someone suggested and I needed to add almost double the amount of whipping cream to get this to a spreadable consistency. But all in all, I'd definitely make this again!

Given the other reviewers' comments that this frosting was too sweet, I added another 1/2 cup of butter, used buttermilk instead of heavy cream, and used unsweetened cocoa (the recipe doesn't specify). I also doubled the amount of buttermilk and vanilla. I used bourbon vanilla, and the end result turned out great. Not amazing, but very good. Next time I'd add more cocoa, but I ran out.

Chocolate frosting is supposed to be sweet, as far as I'm concerned and this frosting was superb. I added two more tablespoons of butter and I used a teaspoon of espresso powder to make it a mocha frosting, along with a teaspoon of vanilla extract. I used it on my chocolate pound cake and it was a hit! It was very easy to make, also. I didn't want to have to melt anything, so this recipe worked just fine.

I used this icing for a birthday cake for my friend. She loved it, and so did everyone else who tried it, but I have to agree with the other reviewers that it was way too sweet. I would make it again not for myself, but for those who love being overloaded on sweetness.

I reduced the powdered sugar by 1/5, to cut down on the sweetness, and used sour cream instead of heavy cream. I also thinned it with 2% milk. Good and not so sweet, quick to make.

Well it is very easy but it is also too sweet for my tastes. I added a 1/2 t. of salt to cut the sweet a bit. I also used 1/2 and 1/2 per another suggestion and it worked find. Kids loved it, I'll probably look for something a bit less sweet next time

I made this for my boyfriend's birthday to go with my lemon layer cake. I had to use more heavy cream to get a spreadable consistency, but I may have used too much because it wasn't as thick as I like frosting to be. I also added more cocoa powder. I would use this recipe again, doubling it as it was not enough for a 2-layer cake (for my taste). I would probably also experiment with decreasing the amount of sugar and increasing the butter, to make it less sweet and thicker, respectively. Overall, it was a simple, straightforward recipe and the frosting came out fluffy and light.

Nice easy recipe. I did increase it by 25% and had just enough for a nicely frosted 8" cake. Substituted half and half for cream and the results are good and yummy.

This was absolutely awful. Way too sweet, I even reduced the amount of sugar and it was still too sweet with a grainy mouthfeel. Hardly the smooth recipe I expected.

This is good and creamy.Just what I was looking for. Great on white cake, but there is just bearlyenough to fill and frost an 8" cake.

This frosting is delicious! I like rich, creamy, and sweet frostings which makes this perfect, but, because of the simplistic ingredients, it's easy to alter it to taste. I add less than a teaspoon of vanilla, and eyeball it to my liking.

This frosting was alright. Maybe a little too sweet. I did add an extra Tbsp of cocoa. It was a really easy recipe though. Used it on the "Moist Yellow Cake" on this site.

this is simple, but it only makes 2 cups of prepared frosting. I made a bit more because I like a thick frost on my cakes. I also found that if you mix it by hand, the frosting is not as thick, hence the need for less cream. I also used light cream instead of heavy cream, and it worked fine. I will use this recipe again.

yummy and easy. i added a couple more tablespoons of whipping cream because it was quite stiff and my cake was crumbly. it made the frosting fluffy and light. the color is a nice light color (like coffee with cream in it) so we'll be able to decorate it for the birthday girl.

Hands down the best chocolate frosting I've ever made! It's so creamy and has very good consistency for spreading. I did add an extra tablespoon of cocoa which made it a bit richer. I'll definately make this again!

This frosting was as easy to make, as it was to eat. It was very buttery and was easy to spread.
