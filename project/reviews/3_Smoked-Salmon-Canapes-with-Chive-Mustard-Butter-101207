First of all, if you're using butter "substitute" then calling it "chive-mustard butter" is somewhat of a misnomer. I used regular butter and it was divine.

I thought these were kind of boring, although my guests didn't have any trouble eating them up. When I make them again I may play with the recipe a little to make it more interesting.

A really elegant canape as is the entire menu. I have served this at least three times on special occasions and now its a staple for entertaining.
