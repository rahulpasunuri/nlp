I don't like pancakes -- they're always heavy and doughy with little flavor. My kids and husband love pancakes, so I try new recipes to amuse myself. These are, hands down, the best pancakes I've ever tried. Ever. Am now a pancake fan (which may or may not be progress) One change: I read in another recipe to let the batter stand for ten minutes before making them and it really makes them lighter. Makes about 16 pancakes.

My oldest daughter took the Bisquick to a pancake feed for some professional football players for a promo for the radio station she works for. We planned on having pancakes for breakfast that morning so I was miffed that the Bisquick disappeared, but I didn't want to go to the store to replace it. So a-searching on the internet I went to find a four star pancake recipe. I scored with this recipe! Since that morning we've made this recipe at least a dozen times. It is the best. It produces fantastic tasting pancakes that smell delicious and brown to perfection. After making a number of variations on this recipe, I agree with reviewer "eeblet from Oakland". The recipe is best when made exactly as described. However, since I am a consummate tinkerer, I had to try some variations. They were all excellent. One time I substituted probiotic soy yogurt for the whole -fat yogurt. Excellent! Another time I made them using half white flour and half "white whole wheat" flour (King Arthur), also very good but you have to add a little more liquid to get the pancakes to be the right consistency. I added a little more buttermilk. The poor Seahawks! They got the Bisquick pancakes while we dined like, well, Superbowl champs! No more Bisquick pancakes for this family!

Try not to substitute if you can! I've made this many times, sometimes substituting low-fat yogurt for whole-fat, milk w/vinegar for buttermilk, or yogurt for buttermilk -- and it's delicious every time... But it is by far the most perfect when using both whole-fat yogurt and (if you can find it!) whole-fat buttermilk. Best pancakes I've ever had when made as written. I'm just "meh" about the apples though -- a tiny bit of syrup or jam is all that these perfect pancakes need.

Love buttermilk pancakes. I like topping mine with cinnamon infused maple syrup http://ofpotsandpens.com/2012/09/19/whole-wheat-buttermilk-pancakes-with-cinnamon-infused-maple-syrup/

This is the most delightful pancake you will ever eat. Every time I make them I end up sharing the recipe with the eaters. They really are a cross between a crepe and a pancake which makes them delicate and perfectly delicious- not giving you that heavy cake feeling but the perfect brunch feel. You can eat a few or many. I also have added banana or blueberry to the cakes instead of the apple syrup and its a true taste sensation.

This was a pretty yummy pancake. I used white cornmeal instead of yellow and since I didn't have buttermilk I added some white vinegar to 1% milk then let it sit for 5-10 minutes. I would definitely make these again.

Didn't make the topping, but sounds awesome! Tweaked the recipe a bit, no buttermilk, used 2% and low fat plain yogurt instead of whole also used half the cornmeal since mine was a medium grind and I was afraid they'd have a crunch. With the changes the pancakes still came out perfect. So light and airy, crispy on the edges, my new go to pancake recipe!

Yum! I made the pancake without the apple syrup - great flavor, great texture. I tweaked it a little: used vanilla yogurt (1/2c), and sour cream (1/2c) so I cut back to 1T of sugar so it wouldn't be so sweet. It still turned out delicious. I love this pancake. My new go-to pancake recipe!

Having some buttermilk lleftover from Thanksgiving and a hankering for pancakes, I decided to go with this recipe and see. AMAZING! These pancakes were hands down the best flavored and textured I have ever had. Both my friends agreed as the whole batch of these disappeared almost immeadiately. I had to substitute the yogurt for light cream as it is what we had on hand, and i also decided to add a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla because that's how we roll. Take it or leave it. It's really the texture that stands out and substituions aside, the liquid to dry ratio is a perfect, melt in your mouth, spongelike pancake that you will be raving about with your mouth full. We didn't have the apples on hand, so no topping, but we have some of the best apples in NY and I will be sure to try it with soon enough. Final words, DELICIOUS! ENJOY!

I have been on a mission for the best pancake recipe for years. THIS IS IT. I did the batter only, didn't bother with the apples, and they were hands down the best pancakes EVER. I didn't have any cornmeal on hand but will use it next time. Otherwise, followed the recipe to a T. PERFECT.

Very, very good. A cross between a Swedish and conventional buttermilk pancake. Slight modifications: zero fat greek yogurt and made 'buttermilk' by adding vinegar to 1% milk plus used coconut oil and cut back a bit instead of the butter. Beautiful bubbles appear uniformly, to let you know it is ready to turn. Took a couple of tries to make sure they were cooked all the way through. Did not made the apple topping, just used maple syrup. Made about 10 lovely pancakes. A keeper!

Holly crap - I'm salivating all over my iPhone just thinking about how to put the sweet taste and perfect texture into words here. These are easy and delicious and I've tried many a pancake recipe. Tips -Perfect amount for 2 people make more if your really hungry -Substituted whole wheat flour for cornmeal because I get it where I live in Korea - I suspect they tasted even better then with cornmeal as a result and I liked the added texture -Made buttermilk using 1tablespoon white vinegar to normal milk method Now get that griddle going! Pics to follow next time! www.gregsamborski.com -Resisted the urge to over mix as the recipie pointed out and they came out perfect

Grammy and I found another way to make this. Omit the maple syrup apples and after you've finished all the directions put frozen blueberries in the batter, but if the pancakes turn purple, orange,or blue that means you've done it right. It's super delicious and your kids will love it too.

Ran out of Bisquick and Krusteaz mix both, so I had to scramble this morning for a recipe for pancakes for the kids. Picked this one out and made it. Yeow! Was it good!

i have started making these pancakes once every weekend for breakfast! they are the best pancakes i have ever made. i vary some add-ins - sometimes i do blueberries, sometimes i do chopped bananas & 1 tsp cinnamon. you could put anything in them, really. i have yet to try the apples (seems a bit too buttery and sweet for me), but i'm sure at some point i will give it a shot. i always nix the sugar in the batter and save money by using milk & 1 tsp vinegar instead of buttermilk.

This was an excellent recipe. Usually I have my pancake or crepe batter sit for at least an hour before I make it so the the consistency is better, but I made these immediately and they were lovely. My family loves crepes ( and pancakes) but these are a happy medium and were easy to make. I did follow the recipe, although my measurements were approximate on the butter and yogurt and my egg was smallish. I used a little less salt. You have to be careful turning them, and I didn't have enough maple syrup to make both the apples and serve on the pancakes, so we didn't make the apples this time but they were very nice with just good maple syrup. The cornmeal adds a lovely texture to them, but not noticeable enough to freak out a 6 year old who abhors "crunchy" things in anything. The texture is very light, fluffy, and delicate, with just a tiny bit of bite from the cornmeal.

These really are like thick crepes. I made them this morning for a few guests, and they loved them! My dad also complimented these, and he is never generous with his compliments. haha I served these with a homemade strawberry sauce and they were excellent. I had no buttermilk, so I just used 1 c milk with 1 tsp vinegar. I also subbed whole wheat flour for the cornmeal. I've made the apples before, and they are DELICIOUS. Make sure to use 100% real maple syrup for those.

As this recipe is described in the foreward, they ARE crepe-like, so don't expect a common pancake texture. I found this recipe to be delightful and a new experience. The maple syrup apple topping is absolutely wonderful.

I followed this recipe fairly closely. The only things I substituted were white cornmeal for the yellow and strawberry yogurt for the yogurt because that was all I had and I was making them for a 4 and 6 year old. They LOVED them and loved the apple topping... I had granny smith apples, so I used them and they were awesome. I tried one too and I really could barely taste the strawberry from the yogurt, so if that's all you have, give it a try. Yum!

I wanted a fluffy pancake recipe, and this is it! The small bit of cornmeal goes a long way to enhance the crispy texture, which contrasts nicely with the lightness of the inside. I didn't even make the topping, it's fine with maple syrup. We've made this many times. I forgot to add yogurt one time, and it wasn't as fluffy.

The best pancakes ever! Made these with Breakstone Reduced Fat Sour Cream, as I didn't have yogurt, and they were SOOO good! Didn't have time to make the topping, just used syrup. They are light and fluffy, and I loved the sweetness.

Absolutely delicious! The texture was light and fluffy, not at all cakey or heavy like so many other pancakes. I tweaked the recipe by adding a teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 cup of ground flaxseed to the dry ingredients and using fat-free yogurt. Also, instead of the maple syrup apple filling, I just sprinkled chopped fresh apple on top of the pancakes as soon as I ladled them out on the griddle. They still tasted fantastic and were a wee bit healthier this way :-)

Very good, although quite sweet (and I also cut the brown sugar in half). Also used low-fat yoghurt and only 2/3 of the butter called for in the pancakes and the syrup, and a light brushing of oil for the griddle. Everything turned out A-OK. Note: in my opinion, would only feed 4 people for breakfast if they were very very small.

These are very good, if a little too sweet. (Help: Why is brown sygar added to the batter?)The important thing is not to overcook the apples.

Great pancakes - exactly as described... a cross between a crepe and a pancake. If you are looking for big fluffy thick ones - this may not fit the bill for you. These were light and delicious. The apple topping was yummy. I used a combo between red & green delicious and granny smith. I also used 5 instead of 3 apples. I added a tad of brown sugar and nutmeg to the apples while cooking and I let them simmer for quite a long time (40 minutes) so they were very soft and delicious. This recipe is a keeper!
