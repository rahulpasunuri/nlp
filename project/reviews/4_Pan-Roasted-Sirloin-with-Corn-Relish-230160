Blackened the steak, then baked it at 400 degrees for 20 minutes for medium well. I used aluminum to make a tent while baking. Excellent!

I feel stupid wasting even more time on this recipe by writing a review. This didn't taste bad, but seemed a colossal waste of time and ingredients. Maybe if the meat is not so great you *might* want to put the salsa on it. Not a fan.

oops! i made this recipe with just reading the list of ingredients so didnt realize it should have been cooked. however, it tasted zesty and delicious. i used trader joe canned corn, adjusted the vinegar down, basically i added ingredients to taste first making the dressing and then adding the veggies, i used cider vinegar instead of white. i used half as much sugar, substituted cilantro for chives. i plan to make this delicious "mistake" again.

The corn relish is amazing, yet I cut the white wine vinegar to a little over half. Steak cooking time may be a little long as well.

The relish was delicious and so easy to make. I agree, though, that the vinegar taste is strong and could be cut some, perhaps by a third. I will definitely make it again.

I love vinegar so disregarded earlier comments re: cutting down on it. Oops. The vinegar was really too strong and was fairly cloying with the sugar. Next time I will cut down on both substantially. With the ginger & garlic in there I will also try a rice vinegar instead. The steak was lovely--a beautifully tender cut from my local farm. I overcooked a little but would absolutely make it again using the sirloin.

This is so easy to make and tastes fabulous. I've made it twice and everyone loves. Great for a weeknight meal.

This dish turned out fabulous - I used a red onion, an orange pepper, and split the corn between frozen sweet yellow corn and a lovely frozen fire roasted corn that complimented the jalapeños wonderfully. 13 minutes was a little long for the steak in the calphalon pan - it was more of a medium to medium well than a medium rare than a like. All things considered the boyfriend loved the dish and we would both love to make it again!

I followed the recipe and would make it again. Next time, however, I will halve the vinegar (I agree that it was overpowering) and use a better cut of beef. The sirloin was fine, if sliced very thin, but I think a more tender cut would have made this recipe a lot better. I agree that the pan roasting technique works very well for sirloin. The next day I mixed the leftover corn relish with halved cherry tomatoes for a nice salad.

Simple and delicious! Great recipe for the hot summer ahead.Red or white wine and yes, an icy cold beer goes great with this.

I'd made two significant changes. First, I'd use tenderloin. Even though I cooked the sirloin medium rare and let it rest, the meat was too chewy to enjoy. Also, I'd reduce the vinegar by half. The amount called for in the recipe was overwhelming to the nose and totally dominated the delicate flavors of the corn. Other than these two changes, I thought the recipe was interesting and could be quite enjoyable.

Great, easy, and fast recipe for steak. I did not make the corn relish. However this is the first time steak has turned out perfectly for me! Thanks!

I usually shy away from steak because it never seems to turn out right with me. This recipe was fantastic! I used over a lb. of top sirloin and my husband and I totally cleared our plates. The corn relish was delish and the tyme and chives really added a lovely flavor to it all. Also, the steak was nice & juicy at medium rare.

This was absolutely wonderful! I was running out of white wine vinegar, so I used a combination of rice wine vinegar and sherry vinegar along with the white wine vinegar. I used fresh corn on the cob and a sirloin steak that was 1# and about 1 inch thick, therefore I seared for 3 minutes on each side and then cooked an additional 6 minutes and it was perfectly medium rare. The relish was perfect with this. I served with a salad of spinach greens and homemade semolina bread. Delish!
