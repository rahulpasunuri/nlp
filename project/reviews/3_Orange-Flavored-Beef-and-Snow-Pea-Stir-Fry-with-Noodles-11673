Subbed pork for beef. Added 1/3 cup chopped onion. Could have used a little more flavor. Would make again.

If you make the recipe exactly as written, you have an okay but ultimately boring dish.

I've made this many times, and each time a bit different. I agree with other reviews that without help it's bland. I love to add a can of baby corn, and a can of bean sprouts, and some red bell pepper. Nix the sugar, and add fresh squeezed OJ. I love to use leftover beef tenderloin and rice noodles.

Agree with previous reviewers that some "oomph" is needed - next time I'll try the suggested marinade, and maybe a few red pepper flakes. Did double the ginger and garlic already. Boyfriend who's not particularly fond of stir-fry ate it (single bowl meal), so it was a success.

Using the suggestions of the other readers and the recipe as a jumping-off point, this came out great. I used flank steak and marinated the whole thing for a couple hours in a mixture of mostly fresh squeezed oj, soy sauce, garlic, honey and chili paste. Then I cut it thinly on the bias and tossed it with a little flour to help thicken the sauce. After stir-frying and removing, I pretty much followed the recipe as printed. But I didn't use ginger (didn't have it) and added some oj and chili sauce to the sauce. It came out better than I had expected!

I managed to lose the beef between the shop and home, so I had to use shrimp. And I followed the suggestions to increase/add flavourings, like garlic and spices. I thought it was fast, easy, and delicious.

I made this receipe lastnight and used suggestions from reviewers that came before me. If I hadn't have used those suggestions it would have REALLY been bland. The recipe was easy to do; however, was still lacking. In the future, I will probably look for a different beef stir fry.

I can understand why people might think this is bland. I made it and we loved it. I used 5 cloves of garlic, doubled the zest, add 2 tsp red chile flakes, and used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil. I also add mandarin oranges at tossing. Fantastic!

You poor people, All this dish needs is a little imagination. Make it as said but add 2 cloves of garlic, Red pepper to taste. I also added about 4 Tbls of Grand Marnier or to taste while cooking the snow peas. This is a wonderful dish.

A subtle orange flavor with a silky sauce make this a real winner. I added a healthy teaspoon of Viet red chili sauce with garlic to spice it up a bit, though. Other than that, I pretty much just followed the recipe.

In a word, this recipe sucks. I have tried many other beef stir-fry recipes, and this was the worst. I was looking for something different than my old standards - well, I got it and it was BAD. Don't make this recipe - you are wasting your time, food, and energy

I followed the advice of others and marinated this in orange juice, zest and red pepper flakes. I used top sirloin. It was only okay. The meat was a bit tough. I still wonder if there is a good beef stir fry recipe that yields truly tender meat and great flavor. This is ok, but I would either try a better recipe or maybe use better meat.

I marinated the meat for 2 hours in orange juice with ginger and orange zest and added a bit of dried red pepper. Meal came out excellent

Great as a quick meal for two or as an additional dish in an asian inspired menu. Quick, easy and tasty.

I used Top Ramen for the noodles. Beef flavor yields some broth for the sauce too. I agree, definitely needs more flavor. I used 2 cloves of garlic and it still needed more. I also added red and yellow peppers for some color. Some mandarin orange slices and cilantro might be a nice touch for garnish.

I added a lot of black pepper (as usual!) so thought it was great. I also added two fresh tomatoes to the mix for about 30 seconds at the end which gave it some color & extra veggies.

The recipe was great but a little bland. You need to add additional spices to it.

Very tasty recipe and easy to make. I added 1/2 teaspoon of chili garlic paste to add a little flavor.

I would make it again, but I would definitely punch up the seasonings. It was pretty bland as is. It could use a little heat and some more complexity.
