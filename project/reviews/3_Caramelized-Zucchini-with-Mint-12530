This was OK--not great. There are other zuke recipes on epicurious that are much better--the marinated grilled zuke is great!

I loved this zucchini...it had tons of flavor and texture. I will add more salt next time because it wasn't quite salty enough, but it was really some of the best, most delicious zucchini recipes I have ever tried-- excellent side dish to any Mediterranean meal.
