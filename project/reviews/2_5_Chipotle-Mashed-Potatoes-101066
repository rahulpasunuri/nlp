I loved this recipe although I did not have chipotles in adobo. I did have dried chipotles, so I ground them in a spice grinder, mixed a tsp with two roasted garlic cloves, mixed that with thick yogurt (greek),butter, salt, pepper and only added the cilantro just before serving. I am going to try this next with sweet potatoes, as some cooks have advised. Thank you for a nice chanage on boring mashed potatoes.

These are good-with slight modifications. I have been putting cream cheese instead of sour cream in the potatoes and like it much better than the sour cream. Also I love cilantro, but don't think its necessary in this recipe. I have also made the recipe with sweet potatoes and its equally delicious. With the sweet potatoes I omit the milk and increase the cream cheese.

When I make this recipe, I use Chipotle paste, and not chopped chipotles. Just add the chipotles into a sieve and use the paste that comes out, and discard the skin and seeds that remain. This has a lot better flavor than the chopped chipotles.

Try this with sweet potatoes instead! The smokey chipotles and the natural sweetness of the sweet potatoes are made for each other. This is a favorite on our holiday table but I made it throughout the year because it's so versatile and good for you!

I highly recommend trying the Garlic, White Cheddar, and Chipotle Mashed Potatoes on this website. Even though preparation is a little time consuming, it is so worth it! These are to die for!

My first experience cooking with chipotles. Intrigued with their potential but I agree with most of the others that this particular recipe doesn't really work very well.

this recipe was horrible, the I love "chipotle" peppers but this recipe did not work for me. SORRY!

Very tasty with a little kick. Definitely a winner for potatoe lovers.

We added quite a bit of garlic and used regular sour cream - there is nothing "low fat" or "non fat" in our kitchen! Also seasoned it with more salt than called for and it was a great dish.

Have to agree with Clinton, this was a bad idea from the start. I'm not a chipotle purist, nor a potato purist, but these two were not meant to go together, at least not in this context. The chilis added a very unappetizing color to the potatoes, and the smokiness did not play well at all with the potoatoes natural sweetness. Best to add these two ingredients to two separate dishes.

My family liked the spiciness the chipotle peppers added and I liked the dimension that the smokiness of the peppers gave to the potatoes. This really does work very well with the Tex-Mex Meatloaf, though I might want to leave the potatoes chunky rather than have them smooth, offering a larger contrast of texture between them and the meatloaf.

The flavor was sooo weak! And adding more chipotle in adobo just made it hot & oddly flavored. I suppose I could have tried bumping up the sour cream, too. Somehow I think this was a bad idea from the start.

Excellent recipe but I did make a few changes. I added a bit more non-fat sour cream (made it creamier), left the peel on the potatoes (rustic look, more vitamins). Also, I didn't have canned chipotle chiles in adobo so used 4 dried chipotle chiles (that I softened first in hot water for 20 minutes). Would make it again (with my changes).
