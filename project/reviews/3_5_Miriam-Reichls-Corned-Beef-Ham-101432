I love this recipe, though with a few alterations: I always use a whole grain mustard and omit the cloves and peaches. Before preparing it for the oven, I put the boiled corned beef on a bed of vegetables (carrots, onions, potatoes, cabbage wedges) and then proceed. As a corned beef lover, it is one of my all-time favorite meals.

Not bad, but it wasn't anything special, either.

Loved this recipe. I added some of the juice from the peaches to the basting sauce. I also added the peaches to the dish for the last ten minutes in the oven. Everyone raved about this dish and no one left without a take home dish for lunch the next day.

This is an excellent recipe but I made a few changes that resulted in a more flavorful and tender piece of meat with less effort. For starters I sautéed the onion along with 3 chopped carrots until the edges where brown and the carrots tender. Then added the rest of the ingredients and instead of cooking on the stovetop placed it in a 250 degree oven for about 4hours until fork tender. The slow even heating from oven cooking gave the collagen in the brisket more than enough time to melt and resulted in a brisket so tender I needed two large forks to get it out of the pot without falling apart. After letting it rest for 10mins and drying it completely I then added the mustard and brown sugar mixture and put it under the broiler for about a minute or two until everything was golden brown and delicious. The peach syrup I heated and reduced on the stovetop with a little fresh nutmeg and served that separately for those who wanted to part take. Overall it received huge raves from my guests. All of which considered it a very unique twist on corned beef. Oh and leftovers the next day are great and still tender.

Made this last night for a late St Patty's dinner. Served it with colcannon and onions and carrots cooked in the broth after the meat came out and went into the oven. We all loved it. I think this will be the way I make corned beef from now on.

This is very good and is different from the traditional corned beef. If you want corned beef, but something different, this is worth trying. I'd make it again!

Everyone raved about this dish; they were picking up the scraps! I loved it because it was so easy. I'll definitely make it again.

Look no further. The reviews are right on! This is the best corned beef I've ever eaten, far superior to boiled corned beef. This is the only recipe I'll use. I even canned pickled peaches so I'll have them on hand when I want to make this recipe. Yum, yum!

Absolutely delicious and a different way of using corned beef. It is best to simmer your meat for a couple of hours the night before and then bake the next day. To add a little more flavor, I basted the meat with unsalted butter during the baking.

Oh, this was good. Don't know how often I will make the traditional corned beef with cabbage now that I have this recipe.

Finally made corned beef tonight - St. Patrick's day came a bit late in our house. My husband loves traditional boiled corned beef and cabbage while I could really do without. This was my compromise and it was wonderful! I used about the same amounts of a grainy mustard and brown sugar, used about 10-12 cloves for a 2 1/2 lb. piece, added a few grinds of black pepper and poured the peaches and juice around the beef while baking. Served just with colcannon and a horseradish cream. I don't like "sweet" meats and this definitely wasn't. Now we can both enjoy this meal, finally!

unbelievable way to cook corned beef-- i just cant bring myself to boil meat and serve it. the glaze and oven time make this dish succulent, and more exciting than the usual. ps, read the book, it rules.

First found this recipe in the LA Times. It is a definite winner. You just have to start the preparation early. There are never left-overs in this household. To answer the cook from San Diego, this is not a sweet dish, and colcannon and cabbage are the side dishes I serve.

I would like to make this for St. Patrick's Day this year, but have some questions about the recipe: -Should I cover the pot while the meat is cooking? -How much ground cloves should I use? -Is this going to be fairly sweet, or sweet and spicy, and what do you recommend as a side dish (besides 'taters)? Would cabbage compliment the flavor? Many thanks for timely answers to my heavily pressing questions.

I can't wait for St. Patrick's day so my husband and I can indulge in our favorite tradition of cooking this recipe and then devouring the meat before we can even "plate it". The guests who join us around the cutting board are always equally impressed.One adjustment: I'm not crazy about the palate-numbing quality of cloves, so we cut back or use ground.

This is a big improvement over plain boiled corned beef, both in flavor and in texture. I prefer a corned round rather than a brisket, as it is leaner, but use what you can find. This is a keeper.

Lazily I used ground cloves in the mustard mixture and it was delicious! This has made us fans of corned beef, and we will have again many times.

I served this during super bowl and it was a hit! My wife thought enough of it to take leftovers over to the neighbors the next day.

I first saw this recipe in the Los Angeles Times where it was deemed the best that the test kitchen staff had ever tasted. I agree and have made it many times since.

I baked the cooked corn beef with only Grey Poupon mustard because we don't enjoy sweet entrees. It was delicious and I'll make it again.
