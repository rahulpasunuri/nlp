I make this recipe as berry crisp, making my own crumb topping and no pie crust. It has a been a huge hit with everyone I have served it to. I make it with cherries and blueberries. It is now a new summer favorite.

This dessert outshined the main entree --lobster-- at our Summer lunch. Guests of all ages raved and doubled up. I had worried that the tapioca pearls I used (not quick cooking)would end up baked into little marbles amongst the cherries, but I made sure they were all well tucked in within the filling and they melted away in the syrup during the baking process. Be creative with the fruit. I used cherries, strawberries and blueberries. Anything goes. really. In fact substituting the disastrous crust in the Lattice Topped Apricot Tart (Bon Appetit May 2000) with this pie's crust recipe would yield any cook another show stopping sweet-and-tart fresh delight.

I received rave- rave-rave reviews from this pie! The crust is fabulous, it looks terrific, and I made it with fresh picked blackberries and rasberries (there were no cherries..and no pitting to do!) Just the right balance of sweet to tart. Perfection.

I don't like to make pies so I make this as a cobbler with a few adjustments and everyone loves it.

I used sweet cherries as I did not have pie cherries. It was still an awesome pie. I used an old favorite for the crust instead of the crust recipe supplied. All was well!

My father-in-law recently handed me a container of fresh pie cherries from his tree. They were wonderful, but (I discovered after getting home) not enough for a whole cherry pie. What to do? This recipe was the perfect answer. I used a bag of frozen blackberries (organic). Our company was enraptured! Furthermore, I love making pies and experimenting with different crusts - and this one was a delight - effortlessly flaky and flavorful.

This is a delicious, easy recipe. We had no fresh cherries, so frozen cherries were subsituted. I think it came out remarkably well, considering I am a novice pie-baker.

I've made this recipe several times; the first time was probably the best, b/c I used fresh fruit. But during the winter, I've used canned cherries and a frozen bag of mixed berries, which works remarkably well. Serve with a dish of ice cream. Fantastic dessert.

I didn't have any berries, so I made it just with the fresh cherries, therefore I didn't need a deep dish... I also added a tbsp. of brandy to the cherries while they marinated. very good!

I don't know if I just did something wrong or what, because the filing never set for me. Other than that it was delicious and I'm going to definately try to make this again.
