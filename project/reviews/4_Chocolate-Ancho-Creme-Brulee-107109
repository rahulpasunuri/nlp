fantastic, the only thing this dish needs is a scoop of good vanilla ice cream to cut the richness and cool it down

Really easy and delicious. However, it was more like the consistency of a mousse. Didn't over cook/bake...Made once a long time ago, and don't remember that. Still a keeper, makes a great mousse too!

Yum! I couldn't find either a dried ancho or pure ancho powder so I went for the brownest chilli powder I could find without added salt and spices (make sure you check the ingredients, most chilli powders have extra stuff added). I used 3/4 teaspoon with a few splashes of paprika as well and the spice was quite mild. I will use more next time as I think the spice factor reduces during cooking. I love the way the chilli doesn't hit straight away but is like a surprise at the end. Definitely worth trying, and worth getting really nice chocolate.

SO DELICIOUS!! I'm not a big creme brulee fan, but I recently discovered the amazingness of chili-infused chocolate. So, with a little prompting from my culinarily gifted boyfriend, I tried this recipe. He was actually the one who discovered it. OH MY GOODNESS....YUMMMMM! You may be skeptical, but trust me - this is one of the most incredible desserts you will ever eat. We've made it several times and usually put in extra cinnamon sticks, 2 anchos, and a bit of cayenne pepper to make it extra flavorful.

Nice chocolate flavor with a kick, but mine turned out to have a texture more like a souffle. Not sure how that happened. It was good as a souffle, but I wouldn't call it a creme brulee.

I could only find ancho chili powder. Found a conversion that indicated 1/2 oz = 1 Ancho chili and that worked. Proportion of chocolate and spice was excellent.

This was amazing. I cut the recipe down to make this for 2, using a cup of cream and 2 egg yolks. I used the entire ancho chili, skipped the cumin, and added a pinch of cayenne. As others have noted, make sure to temper the yolks so you don't wind up with curdled eggs! And strain the cream before melting the chocolate into it.

Wow - fantastic! One of my favorite desserts I've ever had. Topped it with raspberries.

This has great flavor, but I left the the ancho chili bits in the custard per the recipe, which made for an unpleasant texture, with chewy bits in the smooth custard. If I make this again, I would strain those out.

I love this recipe and get requests for it all the time. If you want to get some real zing from the chile's, put them in the cream to infuse, in the refrigerator overnight, then proceed with recipe.

This was divine! I strained the cream mixture after I whisked it into the egg yolks-I can't imagine why you wouldn't. The ancho chiles gave it a subtle flavor that most noticed after they finished it-not spicy at all, just a little tingle on the back of the tongue. My kids loved this too-my 3 year old couldn't seem to get enough! Very rich and chocolaty-mmmmm!

oh boy this was good..really delicious and different. I also baked it only 30 mins. Used brown sugar for the top instead of white, but otherwise I didn't change anything. I broiled the tops to start and finished with my nifty little torch that I use 2x a year for creme brulee! (The recipe isn't written for beginners, leaving out the straining part and also not advising you to temper the egg/hot chocolate cream mixture.)

Made it twice; just amazing. You can taste the cream as it's boiling to see how hot it will be when it's done; so when the cream is just right I strain out the anchos and cinnamon and then melt the chocolate. I find that just a slight burn is the best, as first you taste the rich chocolate and then after the chile burn. Everyone lives it.

good recipe be sure to strain the liquid before adding the eggs and use a little more ancho and cumin than called for. cooking time is no more than 30 min and instead of doing the usual burnt sugar on top beat the left over eggwhites with sugar cinnamon and cream of tartare pile on and place under the broiler

Awesome. I just wish the recipe had provided specific instructions to strain the mixture (unfortunately I hadn't closely reviewed all of the other reviews which suggested this). After pouring the mixture into the ramekins, I made alast minute decision to strain each cup by using a slotted spoon. Next time, I'll pour the entire mixture through a strainer. Also, based on a prior restaurant experience, I served the creme brulee with a little coffee Haagen Daz on top. Loved the addition.

This recipe was so easy. I could have sworn i was going to mess it up, but i didn't! I woke up early to make this recipe, as i was serving it that evening. Realized my cream had somehow shrank ( what i thought was three cups was only 2 and a drip). So i reduced the egg yolks two five instead of six, eyeballed the sugar and chocolate. I had two vastly different sizes of ramekins. but they both cooked nicely in 30 minutes ( less than the 35 suggested in the recipe) I would suggest maybe using two peppers and a bit of cinnamon powder, as the spice was quite subtle. Don't forget to strain, the recipe doesn't tell you to. And the more sugar on top the better.

This was so easy to make and was a big hit with all my guests (and especially my husband). I made it the day of, as well. So if you don't have time to make it the day before- don't be scared to try it anyway. I also added 2 tsp. of mexican vanilla and strained the cream & chile mixture before adding it to the egg yolks. I let it cool for about an hour before covering and refrigerating. All in all, I started making this at 1:30 and served it at 8 pm. Great Recipe!!!!!

I have made this wice now and each time it is incredibly perfect, toothsome, sweet, lovely and beyond compare. Your dinner guests will love you for this one.

This is one of my favorite brulee's but I used ancho powder instead of the whole chili and it was very tasty.

Thanks to the recommendation from a previous reviewer to strain the mixture before cooking. I can't imagine serving it with the seeds in. I used some good Belgian bittersweet chocolate and added a splash of Mexican aged vanilla after mixing everything together - very yummy. Our guests raved about this dessert and it was so simple to do; we'll definitely keep it on our list of great make aheads.

I was a little unsure how it would turn out but, it was awesome. The only thing I did different was to pour the mixture through a seive, I am not a real big seed lover.

this is really a great flvor combination but what you must be careful of is over cooking. If over cooked, the custard turns into almost a "lello pudding" consistency. Also a nice spice mixture of sugar, cinnamon, cumin, and other SW spices go nicely... Must try

I give this 3.5 forks. This is an absolute must try recipes.

Some of you may balk when you see chiles with chocolate, but that is truly the original way to do it. It's delicious... I will probably add more cumin and more cinnamon next time, and not toast the top.

The idea and the reality - based on Mexican blend of chocolate & pepper - are great! Made a variation this week which I first had at The Church Restaurant in Stratford, Ontario [they use ancho, vanilla, paprika & mace]. Also rec Mark Bittman book creme brulee recipe in "How to Cook Everything" for reduced vol of cream, more stable custard from egg yolk-sugar beaten till light yellow & thick.
