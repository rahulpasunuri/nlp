I've made this or variants on it many times and it never fails to satisfy. The "white wine" must be unoaked and better yet if its a variety from Alsace or vicinity - crisp and clean. I'm using a cheap but refreshing Gruner Veltliner tonight which seems philosophically on target. I always add a chopped apple and bacon (occasionally), but I always forget the bacon needs to be crisped first and reserved for best effect. After some trial and error I buy the plastic bagged sauerkraut and only drain it - I don't rinse.

Works well as a base for regular choucroute... I brown spareribs, use the kielbasa and cook under the sauerkraut for 60 - 90 minutes. For easy dumplings, use a can of canned bisquits - place on top of the sauerkraut for the last twenty minutes - cook 10 minutes uncovered and 10 minutes covered for light, fluffy dumplings!

Great easy recipe, a regular for us in the winter. We usually make it as-written, but with homemade sauerkraut. This recipe is especially nice for last-minute guests, as we usually have kielbasa in the freezer and other ingredients are staples for us.

Loved this dish. Have made this many times, usually around Octoberfest. Goes realy well with a whole-grain musturd and a dark german beer.

For greater flavor - and to be more in keeping with traditional choucroute - I browned several strips of bacon in the skillet at the start of the cooking. I removed the bacon strips when they were ready and set them aside to be added, crumbled, at the end of the cooking. The fat from the bacon was enough to substitute for the vegetable oil in the recipe.

I baked this for an hour as I like the dark flavor. I do not rinse the kraut but drain some juice off. I doubled the recipe as I had dinner for eight and wanted left overs, but one man ate half of this as he was German.

Very fast and easy. In the past I've been a fan of the Skillet Choucroute (also on this site), but I think this is better.

Used smoked bratwurst, and an Alsatian pinot blanc, which we also drank with dinner. Had planned to rinse the sauerkraut until reading other reviews that advised against it. It really was delicious. Not a traditional choucroute garnie, but it took only 20 minutes! Don't use canned sauerkraut.

This was quick and easy and tasted great. The pumpernickle bread is a must.

Not too exciting. I did wash the sauerkraut and my guests thought it took away too much taste. I'll try it again but... will use fresh sausage instead of smoked, add apples, and transfer it to a crock pot after browning meat and onions.

Quick and easy to make. My wife hates sauerkraut, yet she requested me to once again make this dish. Unusual flavors.

I used sauerkraut from the deli section of the supermarket, but soaked it in cold water for 20 min to get rid of the chemical taste. Also used hotdog-size keilbasa. The result was delicious. Hard to believe it was so quick and easy.
