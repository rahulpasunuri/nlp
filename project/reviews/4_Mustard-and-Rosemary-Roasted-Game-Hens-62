Very Tasty and Easy. I chopped the garlic instead of pressing. Used Perdue hens and was more than enough meat on the breasts. The mustard topping kept them moist. I didn't need to adjust the cooking time for 4 birds as others mentioned.

For the surprisingly tasty results,elegance,and extreme ease of preparation I had to give this one 4 forks up! I was a little nervous that a whole tablespoon of chopped fresh rosemary might overpower the hens {because rosemary is a very strong herb} but it didn't overpower at all! I used a whole grain french mustard with two kinds of mustard seeds in it, the mustard seeds gave the hens an interesting texture, a slight crunch when biting in. I usually have all these ingredients on hand which makes this a good go to meal in a pinch. I think this is also suitable to serve to guests, it comes off as being a bit fancy and sophisticated.

I concur with everything all the other cooks are saying: delicious, super easy and fall off the bone tender. I made 6 hens together so cooked an extra 15 minutes. They were fantastic!

Delicious and so easy. I didn't use rosemary as sometimes I find it over powering. I did you whole grain and dijon...

Thank goodness I found this recipe again! Made it a few Christmases back and everyone loved it. This one is a delicious counter to the many sweet Cornish hen recipes. Coating the birds with the mustard mixture keeps the birds moist and succulent. My family loves it, and it doesn't get much easier than this. Keep an eye on the time, tho. Served with a salad with a bright vinagrette, buttery roast potatoes and grilled asparagus and you have a great holiday meal.

This is so simple to prepare and so delicious. The skin is crisp and the meat is succulent and perfectly cooked. A keeper.

This one gets the 4 forks for the double bonus of tasting great and being easy to prepare. Made for a small Christmas dinner, but this would easily scale to a much larger fete. Keep an eye on the time, I did need to cover as it was browning a bit fast. Added a teaspoon herbs de provence to the mixture and recommend using the two types of mustard. A green salad, crispy steamed green beans sprinkled with sea salt and very buttery roasted potatoes made for a joyous holiday meal.

Lovely dish! I rubbed the mustard/garlic/olive oil mixture onto the hens, covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated for two hours, seasoned with salt and pepper, then baked at 375. A definite keeper.

I used this recipe for the first time I made game hens and it was a hit! I will definitely make this again. I had to make 3 hens so I increased the time by 15 minutes; it was perfect. Tender, moist, and very flavorful from the mustard and rosemary. I served them with whole grain wild rice and green beans. Loved it (and my guests did too!)

Tried this with guests last night. Never saw dinner disappear quicker and with practically no work on my part. A keeper!

I just made this for the second time. I had dinner guests and they just loved it.The meat fell off the bones and the flavor was excellent! I did put them together before my company came and refrigerated them for about 1 hour. The cooking time is perfect, then I let them set, loosely covered with foil while I finished the rest of the dinner, maybe 10 min. I will make these again,easy and delicious!!!!

Made this for Christmas dinner, everyone liked it. Used "whole grain dijon" so omitted the plain dijon HOWEVER I think that was my mistake. Maybe the dijon would have given it the flavor I was looking for.

YUM-E! My fan club just loved these birds! The mustard/rosemary combo with the essence of the garlic was just the ticket with my crowd. Those birds were all bones when the meal was said and done. I did four birds, thus increased the mustard/oil/garlic ratio. I think leaving the birds to sit at room temp. is vital for the flavors to develop and "soak" into the flesh of the game hens. The fond that was released from the roasting birds was out of this world (made quick sauce to drizzle over pan fried shallots & green beans). Quick, easy, tastes great... what else could you ask for!

Loved It!! One might think that the mustard was a bit too much, but this was not the case. The skin was crisp and the meat fell off of the bones. This is a keeper!!

Loved It!! The skin was crisp and the meat melted off of the bones. One would think that all of that mustard might be a bit much, but that was not the case at all. This is a keeper!!

I made this recipe for my family and my son who is 12 years old and eats nothing loved it. He asks for it constantly and I served it when friends of his were over for dinner and they loved it too. It says a lot when a recipe like this is kid friendly. I switched the amounts of coarse grain mustard and dijon and the recipe still came out great. The hens drop right off the bone. This is a great party recipe. Easy, but elegant. I would make it again and again. Love it.

This dish is freakin' awesome. I leave out the rosemary sprig since I halve the hen and cook it in the rotisserie. I use a total of 5 cloves of garlic, a little thyme and some dried rosemary. Salt and Pepper to your liking and cook in the rotisserie basket for 45-60 minutes depending of you are using cornish or rock hens. The meat will literally fall off the bone and you might even accidentally eat a finger or two while enjoying these little guys. Try the Mustard on Lamb.. OMG it's sooooo gooood! :~)

I've made these hens several times and it ranks up there as one of my all-time favorites. My hubby adores these. Serve with roasted veggies, a green salad, and a dry crisp white, and you'll have your guests licking their fingers.

YUM! Prepared this easy main dish for Christmas dinner and we all loved it! Lots of meat on those little hens, and this simple mixture made it great. Be sure to add some honey for a little sweeter taste!

I thought this was excellent! And SO EASY. I made it with a little extra garlic. I also threw some fresh broccoli florets in the pan duering the last 20 minutes to roast in the drippings. It came out great.

This was a delicious recipe. Game hens came out moist and with wonderful crispy skin. Definitely need to generously season the inside of the hens with salt and pepper. The smell of the rosemary as they were baking was heavenly.

This hen recipe puts the jam in my jelly roll. Toss away the utensils when noshing on this poultry treat- you'll wanna get elbow deep in that flavah. Add honey. Marinaded meat just ain't the same unless it's slightly charred and crusty. Listen kids, I preach the truth. Happy eating...

Made this as a valentine's dinner for me and my husband. The hens were amazing -- juicy and succulent. And so easy. I'm making them again tonight for a dinner party.

We really enjoyed this! Very flavorful. We've tried it on both game hens and chickens, with good results. Another great twist on roasting poultry!

We liked the taste of the mustard rub and might try using it again at some time. We split the hens and cooked them 45 mins. - the skins did not come out crispy. Would consider removing skin and cooking 50 mins. or so. Sorry we can't 'rave' about the recipe - sounded delicious.

This is, beyond a doubt, the best game hen recipe I have tried. I was stunned at how wonderful the flavor was and what a lovely crust and color the rub gives the hens. I will definately make this again - next time for company!

I made this for dinner this evening and it was really good. My husband loves mustard so I thought it would go over well. I had to put foil over the legs for the last few minutes because they were browning faster than the rest. That done it turned out great. Served with scallion smashed potatoes. Yum!

I made this for my huusband for Valentines Day and it was a huge success!!!! I loved it too! It was so easy to prepare and I can't wait to use this for a dinner party. I am not always a mustard fan, but this turned out delicious. Next time I may double the recipe and roast potatoes in the same mustard sauce.

This turned out wonderfully for my Christmas day dinner. I added 1 tblspoon of brown sugar as I felt the rub was a bit tart and that turned out great. A great dish if you're planning a Morrocan/Spanish style dinner party. I would have the butcher cut the hens in half if entertaining a group as chopping them can get messy after they are cooked.

This was delicious! I was a little nervous with all the mustard but it was not overpowering at all. Definately a keeper recipe, I would make this for company any time.

DELICIOUS!!!!! An excellent dish for a dinner party since you can actually sit and enjoy yourself while its cooking and it makes the house smell divine.

Rating: 4
definitely the best roast bird you will ever eat. i don't particularly like the smell or the taste of dijon but i was amazed how the mustard becomes slightly crusty and tastes completely different after it has cooked. chicken would also be good with this recipe, but cornish hens have more flavour (and they make you feel like a giant!).

Rating: 4
This is definitely a keeper! Did not even measure ingredients and it was DELICIOUS. Used more garlic and rosemary. Cut the hens in half before roasting and slathered the mustard marinade all over, including under the skin. Roasted with potatoes, rutabegas and carrots, in the same pan, at 400 for a little less than an hour. PERFECT! Before adding the root vegetables to the pan I tossed them in a similar mixture but using much more oil and less mustard. Too Easy Too Good!

I had a dinner party last night...had one guest who couldn't eat garlic or onions...she's always a challenge! So I made the base for the rest of us and just used dijon and rosemary, some black pepper and emerils essence(that I made) to season hers. Both versions of this recipe rocked...served it along with artichokes and hollandaise and that potato, feta and mint salad that another reviewer recommended. Fabulous meal!! Served Coppola Rosso ..a wonderful red wine! Do this meal!!!

Rating: 3
Great simple recipe! We roasted the hens at 500 degrees for 30 minutes and let rest for 10 covered. Don't do this unless you have a self-cleaning oven! We served this with steamed artichokes and aioli. Fun food to eat.

I followed the recipe exactly as written, except I only cooked for 1 hour, and it fell off the bone. I used Boars Head Horseradish mustard and Grey Poupon and I put the fresh rosemary in the cavity. The mustard wasn't overpowering and the rosemary really gave a great flavor.

I have been making Cornish Game Hens for over 15 years and have tried at least a dozen recipes. This ranks at the top. I added the honey as described by a previous reviewer, doubled the rosemary and cooked them on a Weber gas grill for one hour at medium indirect heat. They were delicious.

Rating: 4
I have to agree with the other reviewers. This was such an easy recipe and came out incredibly well. I used it to cook Cornish Game Hens, which I'd never done before, for an anniversary dinner. I used a wide variety of mustards (had a zillion little jars left over from a cookout so I had some really hot dijon and some orange coarse grain and some deli mustard...) and it didn't overwhelm the bird at all. I'll be trotting this recipe out for my next dinner party.

Absolutely fantastic, I cannot believe how easy, yet delicious this was. I also quarted some red potatos and rubbed them in my left over mustard sauce and threw them in with the roasting pan with the hens, and in the last 10 minutes, I put some asparagus on top of the hens...Fabulous!

Delicious, the best game hen recipe I've tried. I followed directions exactly for the mustard mixture but added about 1 TBL of honey. My husband and I love game hens, so easy and so good. This recipe goes to the top of the list! I served it with roasted carrots, potatoes and shallots with rosemary. (on this site also)

These Cornish hens merit the rave reviews given them. I used as the whole-grain mustard Moutarde de Meaux (Mustard Pommery)which can be found in specialty stores and some supermarkets. (This brand of mustard is the most difficult jar to open that I've ever encountered, and doesn't get easier with each use. Good though.) I'd suggest using fresh rosemary if at all possible. The meat was moist and juicy, and did fall from the bone. I wouldn't, however, make it for guests as eating it is a very sloppy, hands-on operation. Try it for two with your best friend, as I did.

Made this recipe with 4 hens for a dinner party. The flavor was WONDERFUL. I served it with the fruit stuffing from another Cornish hen recipe, which was the best stuffing I had ever had. Also served Tomato, Basil and Couscous Salad and Red potatoes with Olives, Feta and Mint ALL FOM THE EPICURIOUS RECIPE FILE. Everyone enjoyed the rather unusual blend of flavors. For dessert I served, Apple & Blackberry pie and Bread Pudding with Dried Cherries and Caramel Sauce (the best bread pudding recipe I have ever found).

I've been making game hens for over 20 years now and have never loved one as much as I did these! YUM! They were flavorful, juicy and so tender that the meat literally fell off the bones. I used all dijon, doubled the rosemary and added 2 Tbsp chopped Italian parsley, 1 tsp coarse sea salt and 6 black peppercorns, processed all in the cuisinart, slathered the hens in and out and popped them in the oven. Once cooked, I turned the oven off and let them sit in there for about 15 minutes prior to serving. My dinner guests were blown away. The usual din of conversation was replaced by a prayer-like silence that must have been worship to the food gods. I can't wait to make these again!

The flavor was exceptional. Some may be concerned that two types of mustard is too much - IT IS NOT. If you use the correct mustards, I used Plochman's for the stone ground, the flavor abound. It is not as some would believe, too spicy. On the contrary, the mustard brought out the flavor of the hens. I will try it using a roasting chicken instead of a cornish hen.

Rating: 3
Very good - the cooking time was just perfect and the hens were very moist. I used hens from D'Artagnan and think they're worth tracking down. Has anyone tried this with flavored mustard? I have cocoa mustard and violet mustard, and wonder if it would be odd with the rosemary....

Yummy. The birds were moist and juicy inside and the outside flavor was great. Even my 8 year old son likes it!!
