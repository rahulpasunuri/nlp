Do you toast the hazelnuts before putting them in the pralines / crust? What is the general rule with hazelnuts - assume that they are to be toasted if the recipe doesn't specify, or assume that they are only to be toasted if the recipe specifically directs it?

Have made this cheesecake several times and it never disappoints! Great flavor and texture. I made a hazelnut brittle for Christmas this year so subbed some of that in place of the praline. Yummy!

AMAZING !!!!!! Easy to do ....great results. I kept some of the praline in bigger pieces to decorate. Gave it a "restaurant" look !!! YUM-OHHH

Glad people still love MY recipe after all these years :) Try adding about 3/4 cup pureed pumpkin to the batter ..... for a "Thanksgiving Day" twist !!!

To the previous reviewer: They left it out of the list for the filling, but it does say to stir in the praline while preparing the filling. Just read it closely.

maybe i'm missing something, but where do the pralines go?

Winner! This is my favorite recipe for cheesecake. You do not really need the praline it will still taste incredible without it. This is one of the few cheesecake that require you to seperate the eggs wich is what causes this cake to be so fluffly and tasty.YUM

This was a very labor-intensive dish, but the results didn't warrant the effort. Too much sugar; not enough flavor. Perhaps tweaking the amount of Frangelico would help...

Excellent recipe. The only problem was making the pralines. It was my first try at these and did not go well, so I substituted the Old Fashioned Peanut Brittle recipe and used hazelnuts instead of peanuts. I made 1/4 of the recipe and had some brittle left over to eat. (Note that the user reviews for the brittle are right - it only takes about 20 minutes, not 40, for the initial boiling.)

I made this cheesecake when the recipe first came out. I found it a little labor intensive, but couldn't resist the combination of ingredients.It was not only beautiful, but tasted INCREDIBLE. I'm happy to have found the recipe after all these years and will definitely make it for Thanksgiving.
