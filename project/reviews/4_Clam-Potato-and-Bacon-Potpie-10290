Great starting point to make it your own! Couldn't decide between a pot pie or a chowder so I borrowed the best of both. Subbed the onion for a leek, added chopped carrots, red bell pepper, celery, frozen peas, and frozen corn. Used only 1/2 cup cream, 2 cups of 1% milk and maybe 1 cup chicken broth to make the desired consistency. When my veggies got too dry I added a few splashes of white wine that I was sipping on. I also used clams in the shells, hunks of salmon, sea scallops, and shelled prawns. A slow simmer worked great. Added some diced tomatoes at the end. I baked some puff pastry squares for the bottom of the bowls, but my husband preferred a bread bowl to put his chowder in. Both worked great. Great one pot meal. Loved the added veggies! I would have LOVED the pie crust but short on time and too guilty already using the cream! I am only sad that warm weather is coming soon! I need to make this again!!

I was looking for something different instead of the usual steamed clams, and this was it. It is amazing, like a gooey, creamy clam chowder, real stick to your ribs food. I added some garlic and grill seasoning to the onions for flavor, and also used fat free half and half instead of the heavy cream. I also used a bit more clam liquor in place of some of the milk. And since I am aweful with dough, I used pull apart biscuits (from a can, yes) for the crust, which I rolled out to form a thin layer. They got nice and golden brown, and I used the leftover biscuits to serve alongside the pot pie. This is a great winter one pot meal.

The pie was delicious. I served it with a salad. Next time, however, instead of the heavy cream, I would probably use lite cream, or just extra milk. It was a little rich for me, but overall it was very good, and not too time consuming to make.

Was intrigued by the recipe, but since the pastry recipe was omitted, I was unable to try it.
