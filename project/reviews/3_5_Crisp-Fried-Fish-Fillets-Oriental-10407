We had left over rice with currants and cashews and found it accompanied this dish well. Very good. Used Trader Joes frozen mahi mahi. Wouldn't change a thing.

We loved this dish. We have since made it 3x times for dinner parties and it got rave reviews every time. Eveyone wants seconds! I used flour instead of starch, and ground gingeroot from the pantry since I didn't have fresh on hand. Turned out perfect.

The cornstarch is an interesting change for dredging. It actually made the egg and bread crumb mixture stick better. The sauce was good, but we really did not care for this dish and will not make it again.

Prepared the sauce without the ginger - none in the pantry. Excellent dish. My 2.5 year old loved it! Will make it for company. Agree with other review that it is a light & refreshing twist on fried fish.

This is just a simple variation to fried fish fillets. If you'd like an 'oriental' twist to the ordinary, then this might work; however, nothing too outrageous. Basically, its fried fish with the Ginger Soy syrup over it.

We loved it - a refreshing change from traditional fish with tartar. I diluted the soy sauce a little before serving as a was a little salty. Served it with chilled sesame salad.

This fish was great. I especially enjoyed the crisp nuttiness of the coating.

This recipe did not do anything for the fish or me. I found the combination of sesame seeds and soy sauce overwhelming to the subtle taste of fresh fish.

the fish was great. loved the sesame seeds in the bread crumbs. although i love soy sauce based sauces, i found this one too vinegary. looking back at the recipe (i made it very fast and didn't bother to taste the sauce before serving), i realize i didn't boil the sauce (i just warmed it over low heat)...i wonder if that's why it was so vinegary? next time, i'll try boiling the sauce and will add more sugar to taste.

I served this to people who claim not to like fish. They loved it. I served it with cold sesame noodles and a green salad with ginger dressing. It was a hit. I find the sauce a little salty and like the fish just as well w/o it.

I was looking for something different to do with white fish. This dish was exactly what my mouth was looking for! I substituted the sesame seed and cornstarch for cornmeal and sesame crackers and fried the fish in a combination of sesame oil and peanut oil. For the sauce I used mirin instead of white wine vinegar and added a splash of vermouth, some green onion, corriander and other chinese spices. It was refreshing to find a light and tasty sauce.

Great recipe. Quick and simple to make. The fish was light, crisp and delicious and the sauce gave it a nice zing. I highly recommend this recipe. We had it with a cucumber salad which made it a nice light meal.
