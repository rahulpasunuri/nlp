made this and hubby and i loved it. super easy. great over fried eggs with black beans. i think i added 2 chilis instead of one because we both like some heat. this is one of our favourite breakfast to have in mexico, except they usually add cream and cheese too, which tastes great, but no so great for our waistlines.
