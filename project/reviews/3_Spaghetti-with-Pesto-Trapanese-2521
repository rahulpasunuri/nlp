This is a nice pesto recipe. Nothing earth shattering, but pesto isn't supposed to be. Regarding the garlic, I used fresh, just harvested garlic, so six cloves weren't too overwhelming. I'd definitely use more tomatos and chopped basil than suggested to top off the pasta. Good recipe when your garden is overflowing with tomatos and basil.

Excellent, yet DEFINITELY reduce the amount of garlic. It's not cooked, so the amount in this recipe remained in my mouth, annoyingly, for hours. I'd cut back to 4 cloves. Otherwise, this is easy and quite good. I'd add a little more basil, too, to the mix.

Whew! I love garlic, and I added the amount called for in the recipe, but this has some kick. It wasn't as smooth or as green in color as I would have wanted, but it tasted delicious.

This was yummy, but I think I went overboard on the garlic (8-9 sm cloves). Also, it looks pretty gloppy, so next time I would actually follow the recipe and sprinkle the basil and tomatoes on top -- instead of mixing everything together.

This recipe is a nice way to make use of a lot of plum tomatoes and basil from the garden and it makes an attractive presentation. The flavors are nice, although I prefer pesto with pine nuts. I think you could use many kinds of pasta--I made it with Farfalle rather than spaghetti.
