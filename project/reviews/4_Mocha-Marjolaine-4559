This is fabulous, especially if you simplify how you put it together. Forget all that measuring, just cut the meringue layer into 4 equal pieces. We use the dark chocolate ganache between the first two layers, then a thick layer of mocha whipped cream between the next two, and either the same ganache or some with orange peel added under the top layer. That's it! Even without frosting or garnishing, this is a very special dessert. And believe me, it won't feed 10!

I made this as my contribution to Thanksgiving dinner at a friend's house. It was a crescendo finish to a meal that began festively with a tantalizing oyster and artichoke soup. But the Marjolaine took 6 hours to make, including a couple of de-icing events trying to get it right - one filling didn't pass the 15 second test when it sailed from the refrigerator to skip across three feet of floor. Afterwards I sat down and drew a picture of what went where as a roadmap for the future. If you have MS Visio, an object oriented modeling tool or a home whiteboard, this is a terrific opportunity to cross purpose your business tools for home use and model this event process!

Excellent desert - a lot of work but well worth it for a special occasion. I served it on an oblong plate and piled some tiny miniature truffles and the two long ends of the plate. I did find the meringue layers were sticky by the time I assembled the cake - but it did not effect the taste or how it cut. My challenge is now to find a recipe that is as good

Not the easiest or fastest recipe, but it's a visual showstopper and absolutely delicious. Save it for a special occasion and enjoy.

The thin nut-meringue layers were a bit sticky in the preparation, but in the end the effort was worth it. It received a lot of compliments at the dinner party. It says it's for 10 people, but the six of us managed to polish it off...

This is a fabulous dessert, but I had some problems with the ganache. I let the dark ganache refrigerate for 60 minutes. It got much too hard and I had to re-heat it. Then by the time I had to use the ganache for the final glaze, it needed to be re-heated again. At this point it was totally ruined. Next time I would do 2 smaller separate batches of ganache. The first batch is ready to spread after about 30 min. The second batch I would make just before I'm ready to glaze the whole thing. I would cut down on the quantity also, as I had a lot leftover. You can also make the cake longer than 8 inches and still have plenty of ganache and coffee cream. I'm sure it freezes well too.
