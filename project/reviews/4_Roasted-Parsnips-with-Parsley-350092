Followed the recipe, except added fresh thyme along with the parsley. I didn't read the reviews beforehand, otherwise I would have added shallots too. I think these turned out great and they were definitely easy to make! I like the butter with them, I would definitely do that again. My husband isn't a huge fan of parsnips but he actually liked this recipe, and so did our 5 year old.

Flavors are very one dimensional. Great if you like sweet, starchy taste. I wished I had roasted potatoes instead. Parsley is wasted - a stronger flavored herb you have added some interest.

Very solid. I used parsnips and several types of carrots (both from the farmer's market), added a shallot, and left off the butter, which didn't seem to be missed as one reviewer said. I love the sweetness of the parsnips and the addition of carrots balanced it nicely. Served with carne asada and braised spinach.

So easy and delicious! I added shallots, cut in half, to the mix as well. A great combination...

Simply prepared and delicious! I forgot to add the parsley at the end but they were still wonderful. This will definitely become a standard recipe for our family.

YUM! These are excellent! I was worried at first, because we'd never had parsnips before. But what an amazing side for the short ribs! I used butter and the extra virgin olive oil and thought they were perfect. Will definitely make again!

We add carrots and potatoes... fabulous.

Although most got burned because I forgot to turn them, the ones that didn't were delicious. I'll watch them more closely next time.

Perfect and so very easy! My family hadn't tried parsnips before, so I made only 1 pound as a test. Not one piece left, and everyone wanted the recipe. I skipped the butter altogether, and I don't think it was missed.

I agree--these are fantastic. Perfect with meats in place of potatoes. Just make sure that you cut the parsnips to at least 1/2 pieces, as the smaller ones burned to crisps.

I didn't think I liked parsnips. These were absolutely delicious! I will definitely be making them again and again.
