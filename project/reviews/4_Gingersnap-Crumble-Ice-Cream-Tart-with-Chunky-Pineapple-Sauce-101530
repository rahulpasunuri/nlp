This recipe has become a favorite with my friends and family. It is simple to make yet sophisticated with the taste of the gingersnaps. My boyfriend loves it, and asks me to make it for him every chance he gets!

My family loved the ice cream pie, but weren't wild about the pineapple topping. It worked well with a chocolate topping as leftovers. I plan to use the gingersnap crust with other flavors of ice cream.

Do you top the tart with the pineapple at the time of serving? If using canned pineapple, would crushed be better than chunks?

I am about to make this and I can't get a 10 inch pan in my freezer. Could I put this in 2 smaller tart pans?

Do you think the crumble component of this recipe could be used for other tarts/crumbles with a fruit filling?

Pre-slicing the tart and returning it to the freezer (on the serving dish) was definitely a great idea! The crust does get very hard, but it's a great, crumbley texture when you're eating it... yum. I also used canned pineapple chunks and it was perfectly fine. I made this recipe a few days in advance (like it suggests is okay to do) and that was a life-saver on the night that my dinner guests arrived.

I made this dessert for a Caribbean themed dinner party and it had a phenomenal response. Everyone raved over the combination of gingersnap and pineapple. Make sure you do not press the crust down too hard, it will be too difficult to cut. Here's a hint....once the tart is very firm, slice the portions and return to freezer until guests are ready for dessert. The tart is a little time consuming to slice and serve and starts to melt in the process. Preslicing and returning to the freezer helps with this. Definitely an easy and rewarding dessert!! I believe you could get away with using canned pineapple because the tart stands on its own!!!

This dish was a big hit. It was really easy! I carmelized fresh peaches instead of pineapple, and I thought just like everyone else, the carmelizing procedure wasn't worth the effort. I could think of other sauces that would be a lot better.

What did I do wrong? While this tart is delicious (I used home made French Vanilla Ice Cream), the crust was so hard it was difficult to cut and to eat. I only cooked it for 12 minutes as indicated in the recipe. Everyone who reviewed this was correct; pineapple sauce not worth the effort. The tart stands on its own.

This is absolutely wonderful! Guests go wild over this. However, it's not worth the time and effort carmelizing the pineapple. Straight out of the can would sufficiently suffice.

Wonderful! This was dessert with Easter dinner, and the fresh fruit flavor with the tartness of the gingersnaps was perfect after the saltiness of ham. I highly recommend this one.
