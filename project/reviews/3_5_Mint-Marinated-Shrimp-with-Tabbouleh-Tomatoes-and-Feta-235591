This is the kind of salad I've been looking for all of my life! How wonderful it is. I didn't have arugula so I used baby spinach and grape tomatoes cut into half for better visual appeal. I also followed another reviewer's advice and I cooked my bulgur first in boiling water then added oil and lemon. Other than that the recipe is so great. There is a depth of flavour and texture which keeps you eating well after you're fit to burst.

I make tabbouleh often and this recipe sounds fantastic, although I haven't tried it just yet I wanted to give a tip to all who had a problem with the bulgur or those willing to try it. First you need to boil water and soak the bulgur in the hot water. It cooks it up in say 5 minutes. When it's soft, you run it through a sieve to drain out all the water, I even press a spoon against the bulgur to release all the water. Then I usually add the lemon juice and olive oil. After that you can proceed with the recipe indications and I'm sure it will be great. Hope this is helpful

very nice; I too had trouble getting bulgar to soak up moisture, so took a little longer than I had anticipated, but not a real issue. I had frozen shrimp on hand, so defrosted, marinated and grilled. Served with toasted pita and store bought hummus and a nice chilled rose. Perfect summer salad! Will make again.

Excellent; fresh and filling. Perfect for a hot, summer night.

I have made it several times and it is great. I like it best serving it warm. I have cooked the bulgur and added the rest of ingredients right before serving. It was a big hit warm.

this recipe was a hit with the whole family. I used store bought cooked and cleaned shrimp, combined arugula and spinach, substituted couscous for bulger and had the whole, deelish dish on the table in under 30minutes. More filling than one might expet too!

I used couscous rather then tabbouleh since that was what I had in the pantry. Followed the recipe otherwise adding some chopped Italian parlsey and chopped kalamata olives. Very refreshing and light tasting.

I think I would have liked it better if the shrimp were warmed up.

Excellent flavours. Much better the 2nd day, as we found the bulgar still very crunchy after only a couple of hours. Next time, I will make it the night before.

It was fine; while I enjoyed it, it's not something I'll be laying awake craving at night.

My sister made this and it was great. I had three servings! The salad even without the shrimp would be really good as a simple side dish.

We go to Tanglewood every summer and this made a wonderful dinner for our guests!! I marinated raw jumbo shrimp and grilled it....then I adder it to the rest of the recipe! Everybody loved it....we gave it rave reviews!!!

My copy of this recipe went right into the recycle bin. Tabbouleh was so-so. I had green shrimp so precooked them right in the marinade and that worked well. Perhaps had I doctored this up as some others did, I may have been more enthusiastic about this dish.

Really good! I took the advice of another reviewer and added parsley and more mint and arugula. I also used really good Israeli feta...it was so good.

EXCELLENT!!! Made a SUPER main-dish when served with H/M split-peas soup and that much overworked "crusty bread". The marinate made the shrimp scrumptious (I may marinate them that way for other salads). As usual I subbed fresh spinach for arugula (never any in this town). Since we like lots of veggies in something like this, I doubled the spinach (arugula) and increased the plum tomatoes by 50%. Used low-fat feta, and it didn't seem to matter. Only criticism--a bit too heavy on the bulgur mixture. Next time I will decrease it by 25%, and sub some water for an equal amount of oil. Didn't use anywhere near the amount of salt called for, and added several drops of hot chili sauce to the bulgur mixture. All-in-all, a must try recipe that is worthy of 3-1/2 forks.

The other cheese you can use is haloumi. Haloumi is best when grilled or fried so if you are going to grill the shrimp, grill the cheese until browned and softened and then, while the cheese is still warm, toss bite size chunks into the salad.

Thank you, Boston! I will try your cheese suggestion when I try this.

I haven't make this so I cannot make any ratings. Just want to answer the question Can't cook from Saratoga had. Ricotta salada is a good substitute for non-feta eaters. It's a firm cheese and is less strong and less salty

The ingredients say to start with pre-cooked shrimp.

Cooked shrimp. I'm going to make this soon - I have picky eaters who don't like feta, does anybody have suggestions for a substitution? I'm out of ideas. Thanks.

Can you tell me if the shrimp is only marinated - or is it cooked/grilled?

Excellent- Our family has been incorporating shrimp into TABBOULEH for years. Although true TABBOULEH must contain parsley and a small amount of garlic-Oh My...

Nice, simple. Served it with a kalamata olive yogurt "sauce" and figs with goat cheese & honey. Really nice meal. Simple, no cooking!

I have served this salad three times this month! Just delicious!
