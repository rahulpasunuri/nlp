Delish! Dust chicken with spices before browning. Add chickpeas to sauté pan one minute after adding onions and sauté to incorporate the flavor of the spices left in the pan after browning the chicken. Cook in advance and set aside for 1- 2 hours to let flavors develop. Jalapeño-stuffed olives give it a real kick.

Absolutely delicious, will be making it again. I also made a version replacing the veg and beans with red substitutes, sun drieds, roasted peppers and kidney beans, still lovely but not as delicious as the one here.

I have to admit I was skeptical about this dish when I initially put it all together and tasted it in the pot, it didn't seem to be particularly flavorful. But it was delicious, and I'm happy we've got leftovers. Things I did differently: I added more cumin, stock, and used parsley instead of mint, and I braised it on low longer than the cooking time indicated while I prepared pearl couscous to serve it with. I think giving time for the flavors to meld is key here.

I followed the spices exactly but had to use regular pimento stuffed green olives that I sliced in half. VERY GOOD but a little too much work for a week night. This is somewhat labor intensive but worth it for a weekend. I also used two cans of whole artichokes which I quartered and the whole can of chickpeas. It is good! Also, I used cilantro, not mint. Next time I might try the mint.

This was really good and my first time cooking with turmeric. I made this late one night and reheated the next day; so flavorful. I added a whole can of chick peas and extra red pepper flakes . Yum!

Really yummy! Made some substitutions based on what was on hand: chicken breasts in peri-peri marinade and spanish chorizo, both of which added alot of flavour. Also used 2 Tbs capers in place of olives to suit family preference. will make again!

Very very good. Prepared exactly as printed, with the following exceptions: used chicken breasts sprinkled with the spices before browning and added the spices again when called for., allowed 1 1/2 hours for it to sit before reheating and serving. Served over brown rice...yum! left overs will be amazing.

I really did think this was pretty delicious, with the advice I used from other people who reviewed the dish. I added the turmeric, cumin and coriander to the raw chicken before browning it, and then added the spices again when cooking the sauce. I made the dish in the morning, turned it off to allow the flavors to marry all day, and heated it up again at supper time. Very tasty.

Although I love artichokes and your recipe, as a physician and surgeon, I have to clarify that the LIVER (not the gallbladder) produces bile. The gallbladder stores and concentrates a small amount of bile (usually between meals). Bile, in turn, helps with the emulsification and eventual absorption of fats from the small intestine.

Tried this recipe last night. Overall, it was OK. Certainly pretty healthy meal. I do wish that the chicken and chic peas could have picked up a bit more flavor. If I do make it again, I think that I'll boost the spices by two and use filleted chicken breasts or chicken fingers. Hopefully they will then be a little more seasoned.

I think this is one of those dishes that should 'sit' for a day (or a few hours) for the flavors to meld. It was very good, but I'm not sure why the recipe author used chicken thighs vs breast meat. Also, is it just me, or do others find it takes you much longer to prepare a dish than the 'active' time stated?

Oh my goodness! This is my new favorite recipe! So.. I did have to make some changes.. For example, we do not eat chicken thighs regularly, so I substituted them with breasts. Also, I don't like green olives, so we used kalmata olives. My yellow onion was rotten so I used a red onion. I also added some black beans, maybe 1/4 of a can, and served with cous cous. My husband devoured it and asked for seconds! Winner winner, Braised Chicken Dinner!

Absolutely use fresh artichokes when available. When I lived in the South of France baby artichokes were at the markets in spring and they were better than any other artichoke. This was so delicious.

I added more chicken stock to the pot to give it more of a sauce, added 1/2 tsp more of cumin, a little more corriander, and more lemon zest. When I make this again i'm going to add the chick peas earlier. They didn't seem to soak up the spices as much as I'd like. Also I'd like to add some preserved lemons. That might be the ingredient to push the flavors even farther.

This was a definite win. Vivacious flavors, a wonderful pairing of artichoke and olive with that chicken. Don't skimp on the lemon zest and on the mint garnish--those elements make these flavors pop all the more. I added more artichoke than recommended... This is in our "must do this again" list, for sure!

Delicious! I did use the spices on the chicken pre-browning and in with the onion. Home made chicken stock added depth and richness, and I thickened the broth a little by sprinkling a tablespoon or so of flour and stirring it in before the final simmer. It was a little sharp at serving time, so I added a squeeze of anchovy paste. Served over the Brown Rice Pilaf. Definitely a do over.

Delicious. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this. Made it for the first time with frozen artichokes. I think I will try fresh next time. The spices create a very deep, layered flavor. There is a little heat at the finish. Personally, I love heat and would probably boost that up but my wife loved it as is. Finally, we do try to eat relatively healthy. I think I may try breasts and/or fish just to make it a bit leaner than the thighs.
