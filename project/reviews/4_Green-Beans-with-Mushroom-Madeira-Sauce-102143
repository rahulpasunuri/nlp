This is absolutely one of my favorite sauces. Quite frankly, I have not even tried it with the green beans, but the sauce alone is wonderful and very versatile to use with any number of different dishes. Even with or without the mushrooms, the butter, madeira and cream is delish. It can be used with pork tenderloin or chicken cutlets. I even used the base sauce together with already cooked chicken in a crepe [along with other appropriate ingredients on hand] and it was wonderful. This sauce has been added to my recipe collection, and is one of my favorites

A Fantastic recipe! Iv made this for every thanksgiving since the recipe was published! I don't do the fried leeks because its to much work, instead I cut onions into rings, lightly flour and fry them. They look beautiful all mounded on top of the beans!! A real winner!!

This is just delicious. I made the mushroom sauce to use as a filling for crepes and it was outstanding. Going to try it with morels tonight!

Ran out of time and didn't make the crispy leeks but loved the recipe anyway. The sauce would also be wonderful on chicken breasts.

This recipe is in my permanent Thanksgiving file - I make it every year - however, I don't bother with the fried leeks. I have made them in the past but decided that it wasn't worth the trouble - the flavor develops as this dish sits, it's better the 2nd day.

I made this recipe at this years annual Thanksgiving dinner with family and friends, here in Holland. This got rave reviews. It was a fantastic recipe and I would not change a thing. I highly recommend this recipe, as do all the guest I had at dinner.

I can't stand the traditional "green bean casserole" though I do like to serve green beans on Thanksgiving. As a variation and to lighten the recipe (no cream, please), I sauteed 2 thick slices of lean Kansas City bacon, then added trimmed green beans and mushrooms, along with a few thyme sprigs. Sauteed briefly, then covered and let steam with the Madeira until crisp tender. Yum!

Surprisingly good. Had button mushroooms and shiitakes in the fridge plus some haricot vertes that needed to be used up, so decided to try. The leeks were good on top (I sauteed in a bit of oil rather than deep fried, I think one could use caramelized onions instead in a pinch - would add the flavor but not the crunch. Really liked the sauce - kept thinking it definitely was not dietetic in any way as we enjoyed for dinner. Would make again. Pretty easy to make.

I made this for a potluck dinner and everyone raved about it. It's delicious! I added a little salt and a lot of pepper. Will definately make again.

Absolutely fabulous, with more mushrooms than I'd expected. I did the leeks in about 1/4" of olive oil and they came out light and crispy - with a lot less fuss and mess than deep-frying. Was liked by traditionalists and foodies alike at my holiday dinner.

the mushroom sauce really made the dish. The fried leeks were a good touch to finish it off. We didn't have any fresh shitake, so we used portobellinis instead. Will definitely make it again.

I found it a bit too creamy but my guests all loved it. Substituted no-fat half-and-half for the cream.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner last night -- fried the leeks in the turkey fryer before the turkey. It got rave reviews and there were no leftovers at a table with lots of extra food.

I made a few substitutions based upon what I currently had in the house: dried oregano for thyme, sake with a little sherry instead of madeira, and half & half instead of chream. I also sauteed the leeks instead of deep frying them. Despite all the changes, it still is absolutely delicious! you really can't go wrong! and it's a quick and easy recipe!

I've now made this twice and both times I used canned onions instead of the leeks...other than that followed the recipe exactly and it was loved by all my guest.

WOW!!! Everyone loved this one at Thanksgiving this year. I used marsala (lots of it) and about 24 oz of button mushrooms. Didn't have time to fry onions myself so I used half a can of the already fried kind so popular for the traditional green bean casserole. I'll have to make this way more often than just Thanksgiving

Rating: 4
I make these every year for Thanksgiving. They are by far the most requested item on the table. I skipped the leeks this year and it was less messy and just as yummy. I actually think I'll try it with shallots on top instead. I also use dried porcini mushrooms. They add a nice flavor.

I have been making this recipe for years. My sister-in-law always requests them for Thanksgiving and other holidays. It is one of my favorite Epicurious recipes. Sometimes I do the leeks, but generally not, it really doesn't need them, but a great touch.

This is so far beyond the canned-soup casserole, you won't believe it. Sure, it's rich, but it's a special-occasion dish. I tossed the cooked beans and mushrooms together in a casserole dish, topped them with french-fried onions to save time and work, and let them heat up in the oven next to the turkey for about 20 minutes. Outstanding; my dinner guests said these were the best green beans they'd ever had.

Rating: 2
I liked the leeks, and it's hard to go wrong with fresh green beans. But the mushroom sauce was way to rich for me, and at the same time tasted bland (no complexity at all)! Too much cream, perhaps. Also, a bit bothersome for a casserole 'spin-off'. Can't say I'll make this one again. No one else at dinner cared for it, either.

This has become a permanent stable for Thanksgiving dinner. Sauce is rich and wonderful but its worth spluging once a year. Leeks are nice change from store bought fried onions. Sauce is great for a twist on Chicken Marsala receipe too!

I just made this dish for Christmas dinner. My guests enjoyed it very much and raved how good it was. Yes the sauce was rich, but not over the top. I disagree with the other reviewers and think the fried leeks were a nice change from the greasy and tastless canned fried onions. I thought they were the extra cots. I served the beans along side of mango glazed cornish hens stuffed with fruit stuffing.. Amazing.. this green bean dish is a keeper for sure......

What a nice change from the green bean mushroom cassarole with fried onions. I had to use small portobella mushrooms and marsala. I wasn't disappointed with the results. Please note it is a very rich sauce and I used half & half.

Rating: 4
I didn't replace anything the first time I made it....but have since replaced the beans with....polent, rice and over steak. This sauce is so tremendous that you can serve it with anything: wrap a steak in puff pastry (lots of recipes on how to do that) and pour the mushroom sauce over the top. YUM! Bag the leeks, and OF COURSE add garlic. good grief, who wouldn't!

Wonderful recipe! I've used portabellas in this with great success as well... Recipe easily doubles up for larger crowds. It's a fantastic dish in that it can be made ahead of everything else (and then just reheated to serve) ~ and able to avoid all that last minute prep time with other dinner items that require your precious time. A wonderful way to dress up them 'ole beans! MMmmmmm...

I served this for Thanksgiving to rave reviews. I substituted crimini for the oyster mushrooms. I also substituted the canned onions to speed up the process. This is one that I will use over and over.

I substituted half & half for whipping cream, and the sauce was too thin to stick to beans, so we made a roux to thicken,and it turned out pretty good.

Made it for a crowd and everyone enjoyed it. Sauce seemed to get thicker after sitting in the fridge a few hours (which was a good thing). Heated up well the next day, even though the leeks weren't crisp anymore.

Rating: 3
Very refreshing, and almost too rich tasting. It does have a very nice balance of flavors. I added two portobellos to the sauce mixture. Although tender-crisp, next time I will cook the green beans maybe one more minute or two.

What an elegant dish! It looked just beautiful for a festive New Year's Eve dinner. I followed the suggestion of others and left out the leeks and used the canned fried onions instead. It was a real hit. I made the green beans and sauce ahead, even earlier than the recipe suggested, and it still tasted and looked wonderful.

I altered this recipe - portabello for shiitake and oyster mushrooms; had tot thicken it with flour and water because of the mushroom change perhaps; added garlic (can't hurt); and used canned fried onions because I didn't feel like deep frying leeks and because I like those canned fried onions! My anti-veggie niece re-heated them the next night - what more could I ask for in the way of a compliment? Oh, hello Roseanne.

This was the thing I liked best about our New Year's Eve meal. It seemed as though it could have used a bit more sauce and the leeks were a little greasy but overall it was very tasty. The mushrooms and sauce were excellent. It's 4am and now I wish I'd saved those leftovers.

I tried this recipe because I have a huge surplus of fresh green beans from my garden, and it was great! I had a can of the fried onion rings on hand so I used those instead of frying the leeks,and even my picky kids liked it.

Sorry I can't run with the crowd on this one. I wouldn't make it again, for basically the same reasons as the cook from New York. It was too rich, too much bother, and it just wasn't that good. I much prefer the recipe for Green Beans with Roasted Onions.

I made this dish for a Valentine's dinner party. It was easy to make earlier in the day and chill separately, then quickly reheat for the party. I fried the leeks in advance and stored them loosely covered. It was a very delicious and interesting dish.

This was okay. I don't think I will make it again. It was too creamy for me and completely overpowered the green beans. But it was an easy recipe that looked wonderful. I did not even attempt to fry the leeks - seemed too complicated and messy.

This was SO good. No need to ponder this one. Just make it! You will not be disappointed. If you want to make it easier, you can leave out the fried leeks. I'm sure it is delicious w/them, but it is plenty delicious without them as well.

This recipe is much better than the old Campbells Soup standby. I used Port in the sauce instead of Madeira since that's what I had on hand and it was great. A little sauce went a long way - very rich, but tasty.

An excellent dish and an attractive presentation. We served it as one of the representatives of the "Three Sisters" at our Thanksgiving dinner 2000 (Corn, Squash and Beans). We topped it with the deep fried leek slices, which became hundreds of leek rings when they hit the hot oil. Everyone enjoyed the dish and we will add it to our list of favorites.

I am always looking for interesting vegetable dishes and this definitely fills the bill. I did not use the leeks and it was great. Some of the guests even liked dipping there bread in the sauce. I served it with the salt-encrusted beef tenderloin and twice-baked potatoes. It was a wonderful meal enjoyed by all.

Rating: 3
Really it should be a 3.5 but we cant pick that number... This is delicious... but so rich!! Save it for when you want something very creamy. My one problem with the recipe (why I didn't give it a 4) is that the fried leeks were not really an added plus. To me, they added an undesirable greasiness and texture. Next time, I will probably just do a light saute on the leeks.

Rating: 4
Wonderfully interesting green bean recipe. I didn't think it resembled the old casserole version at all. I substituted evap. non-fat milk for the cream and did not do the fried leeks because I ran out of time. I will try the leeks in the future. I served this to guests along with Basil-crusted Veal Chops (BA12/99) and Scalloped Potatoes with Goat Cheese and Herbes De Provence (BA12/96). Great company menu.

Very happy with this recipe. Even my teenage son liked it! I, like the 1st reviewer, did not have enough time to include the leeks but it was still excellent. I will try the leeks next time though- I can see that they would make for a fully rounded dish.

Really delicious, and a great turn on an old favorite. It works better than you can imagine for Thanksgiving dinner, just don't tell your guests what you're making until they taste it. Then watch them eat.

At a recent dinner club party, this recipe was served as a side dish. It was excellent. The cook decided not to use the sauted leeks, and they were not missed. She made the sauce and beans ahead of the party, and warmed it in the microwave at the party.
