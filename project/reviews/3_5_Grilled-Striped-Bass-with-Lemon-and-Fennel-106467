I made this exactly as directed and it turned out beautiful and delicious. I cooked the fish with the head on and it made a great presentation at the table and tasted fabulous.

Really really nice. Since my rockfish (striped bass) was skinned, I placed the prepared fillets on tin foil on the grill. The fish turned out beautifully -- the flavor of the fish was really enhanced by the garlic, lemon, and olive oil. I highly recommend this -- but do make sure you use the correct fish!

I haven't made it either but it needs to be a higher fork rating to be considered by others, I agree!

Rating: 4
still not high enough. And haven't made it yet

Not quite a high enough rating yet.

Haven't made it but it seems this recipe may be getting a bad rap so I thought I'd throw in a 4 forker since the previous person didn't make it and gave it a one fork! What's up with that!?

I haven't made this yet, so I won't rate it, but I wanted to note that while the reviewer below refers to sea bass, the recipe calls for striped bass, which is a totally different taste and texture, so perhaps that contributed to the poor results he or she had.

The Herbs give off a terrible taste once tasted. Sea bass shouldn't be cooked like this.

Great recipe if you like eating at Bill Knapp's.
