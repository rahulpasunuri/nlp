This was excellent. I did increase the quantity of avocado relative to the cranberries but it would have been good either way.

Follow advice and make sure there are big chunks of the cranberry. Excellent garnish for the pork dish and a great fit for the menu!

We have an avocado grove with over 100 trees - always looking for new ways to use them. We like this very much. Good as a salsa on chips around the holidays with or without avocado. A great relish with the turkey. Want to try it as a topping on brie and crackers. Serving it tonight with "Pan-Fried Pork Chops" and a baked yam.

I thought this tasted more like a chutney than a salsa. Sweet and tart, but not meant to be spicy.

I was a little nervous about this but I made this for Christmas dinner - it was a big hit with everybody. The flavors came together really well. I did not use the bell pepper. I think a little lime juice would be good - we didn't have any.

I also had to substitute dried cranberries for fresh and will probably make that the standard since cranberries are so seasonal. I used 12 oz cranberries, covered with water, brought to barely boiling, turned off heat, and let them sit covered for 1 hr, drained (yummy juices, save for something else), and proceeded with recipe. No need to food process them either. I also heated the oj and sugar as suggested. Lovely presentation and definitely a "do again." Thanks for all of the tips!

A delicious relish for any roasted or grilled white meat. Careful using the food processor on the cranberries; it's easy to over chop and it's better to have bigger chunks of cranberry. Not too spicy, I could have used another 1/2 a jalepeno.
