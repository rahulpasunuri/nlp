I was looking for an easy stock recipe, and this was it! I used a leftover rotisserie chicken carcass (really don't see the need to use the whole chicken - seems like a waste) and measured portions out into ziploc bags for freezing. I'll never throw away those chicken bones again!

I admit I've always been a coward when it came to making stock. It always seemed tedious, time consuming and mysterious. This is shockingly simple; extremely easy to tackle. The stock I made from roasted chickens stuffed with garlic, tarragon and meyer lemons is positively delicious. I have enough stock for about 8-10 portions of soup. Never again will I be guilty of not using my scraps!

I put the chicken in a big cheesecloth bag so I can pull it out easily and separate the chicken from the bones. In addition, I throw in the rind of some old parmesan which just adds richness.

I like the ingredients to this stock, but not the method. If you're thrifty enough to make your own stock, I would imagine you're also thrifty enough to balk at the idea of throwing out all that chicken! I pull the chicken out of the pot when it's cooked, pull the meat off the bones, then put the carcass back into the pot and let it keep cooking. If I don't actually need the chicken meat, I just freeze it for later. Whenever I roast a chicken, I too always make stock from the carcass- it'd be such a shame to let it go to waste!

Thanks to danajill from Denver, I never would of though to use a rotisserie chicken carcass. I made a stock with one the other day and it was wonderful! I used the stock to make tortilla soup and added the chicken from the rotisserie right back in afterwards.

Every good cook should make her own chicken stock. It's so much better than what you can get in the store. That said, I always use a roast chicken carcass, whether from a grocery rotisserie chicken or a home-raost chicken with the meat (mostly) removed. There's really no need to use a whole chicken for this, and it's a waste to throw away the carcass. This is a good basic recipe, easily halved. Do remember to include the onion skins, as this is what gives the stock a nice dark color. You can also throw in parts of vegetables you've cut off and frozen: asparagus stems, broccoli stems, etc. Strain through cheesecloth and freeze in one cup portions in plastic, then when frozen pop the portions into a freezer bag for easy storage.

I'm not able to buy canned chicken broth where I am, so decided to give this a try. It came out so well, I will definitely make it again. I found that it jellified after it cooled, making it difficult to skim the fat. Guess there were too many bones in the meat I used.

This is a wonderful stock recipe. I added 1 medium parsnip (quartered) and a little extra water than what was called for (1 extra cup). The only thing I had a problem with is that it really only made about 8 cups of stock, not 14 as stated.
