ps: one trick for great scones: freeze your butter and grate using a coarse plane grater!! Becomes a "coarse meal" before adding sour crm mixture. Also, do not overwork the dough. Only turn enough to combine the fruit, then form together.

Pay no attention to the other reviewers; these scones are wonderful following the recipe as is. This is a denser scone than some. I have been baking these for 10+ years. One of my "go to" scone recipes! If you like more fruit, add more fruit!

Not a great recipe. Needs far more liquid to make it work, and by the time I figured that out, the dough became overworked and the scones tough and dry. One of the more bland scone recipes I've made as well - definitely pass on this one.

very easy and good wih more liguid. I added 1/3 c creme fraiche, dried and fresh ginger and turned out really tasty

I use this as my basic scone recipe and "tart" it up depending on what I have in the pantry or in the fridge. It's reliable, tasty and solid - the way I like my scones! I usually split the dough into 3 balls, flatten and cut into 6 wedges... the size is just perfect for snacks, and I don't feel guilty when I have two! For a more dessert-like scone, I glaze with icing sugar and lemon or lime juice (I also made a glaze with mango juice once, but it was a little overpowering with cranberries).

This is a fantastic recipe. I cut the butter in by putting all dry ingredients in my food processor. Not as organic of an experience, but it makes them even lighter.

I may have done something wrong, but this recipe didn't turn out to be anything special when I made it. I added extra liquid and extra apricots and it was still just so-so.

Made as written, these are scones more in the true English sense of the word -- i.e. somewhat dry, perfect with tea (English Brekky? Prince of Wales? Yes.) If you're not into that a little bit more cream helps. I too add a bit more apricots than called for. All in all one of my favorite scone recipes.

Rating: 4
Forgot to say, I agree with others re:more sour cream. I used 1 cup and a little chopped candied ginger.

This is delicious!! Food processor easy. I hand chopped the apricots and threw them in last. Also, made TWO rounds resulting in 16 scones. I did not sprinkle with brown sugar, as they browned nicely at 20 minute baking.

These scones have great texture - moist, but they hold their shape in the oven quite nicely. I used a full cup of sour cream, and about 2/3 cup of dried apricots. I skipped the brown sugar on top. My scones were done in 15 minutes. I thought the flavor was a little too mild though - I might add crystallized ginger or dried cranberries next time to zip it up a bit. Overall, a great scone recipe that just needs a little tweaking.

As the recipe was dry, I used fresh apricots I canned last year and left them in 1/4 cup of the syrup. After kneading in the apricots I rolled the dough in granola and brown sugar. They came out perfectly moist and delicious. I drizzled the baked scones with cream cheese icing. All four of my kids gave this recipe 4 forks!

excellent, added just a bit more liquid than called for.

Definitely needs more apricots, and also more liquid (either sour cream or cream). I may have added too much extra sour cream (they were a mess going into the oven) but they look fine cooked. They're a little cakier than I think of scones being (although my scottish husband thinks they're just right), but they're tasty.

Exceptional Scones - My entire family went a bit insane over these during Mother's Day brunch. I was generous with the apricot amount, also added approx. 1/3 c. heavy cream. They are a nice change from the usual scone flavors of blueberry, etc. Also, instead of the sugar topping, I drizzled a tiny bit of powdered sugar frosting on the top to give a hint of richness.

Rating: 3
These turned out very well with the addition of more liquid. As written, it wasn't nearly enough to bind the dough. I added a healthy splash of heavy cream and that did the trick. More sour cream (Greek yogurt also works fine...that's what I used) would also work. I would also add a few more dried apricots next time. Other than that, these are very moist and delicious.

Rating: 4
These are great! I had a lot of dried mangoes to get rid off, so I used that instead of apricots -- but any dried fruit would work. I also used a mix of low fat sour cream and creme fraiche and sprinkled sliced almonds on top. Yum. Froze what was left for quick breakfasts and defrosting them hasn't hurt.

I love this basic scone recipe! So far I've played with using yogurt and it works well. Now I make savory scones (with the sour cream) and a few other substitutions and they're great.

These were very good, but I think next time I'll add a few more apricots, brush the top with melted butter and top with a bit more brown sugar. All my guests, however, loved them as made.

It's a nice not great recipe...it requires more than sour cream to add moisture, however...or lessen the flour to 1 3/4 c.

These are wonderful: in texture, taste, and appearance. I used dried plums and pluots, as I did not have any apricots. This is an easy and fast recipe, and I will be making it again soon!

I used dried cherries instead of apricots. This is a great recipe and the sour cream makes for a rich and heavy pastry. These were better than any scone I've ever bought at a tea house.

This is an easy recipe...I add another tablespoon of sour cream, and top it with a healthy, thick coating of the brown sugar. Sometimes I even add a bit of candied ginger to the brown sugar topping...delicious!

Quick, easy, and delicious. I had one yogurt-sized cup of sour cream, a little more than the 2/3 cup in the recipe, and added all of it to the scones. I didn't have dried apricots, but Craisins straight from the bag worked just fine. They came out beautifully moist and light. They looked appealing, too. The only reason I give it 3 out of 4 fork is because my ideal scone is much more dense.

Super easy and very tasty. I made them for Easter Brunch whose attendees were varied in what they could eat. So I split the recipe and made half following the recipe for those of us that could eat dairy and the other half I made with soy milk and margerine for those that couldn't. Both came out yummy.

Upon others' advice I added some candied ginger, plus threw in some toasted almonds. The texture and flavor were great. Even my very picky friend liked them.

Our family loves this scone. I did make several changes. I use a full cup of sour cream and instead of apricots, I sometimes used softened dried cranberries. I also add some chopped ginger to it. The best part is that you can do the whole thing in the food processor with excellent results!

YEEEEESSSSSSSSSS- now that is a SCONE! YUMMMMMMM

This one missed - pretty dull. Only change I made was substituting plain yogurt for the sour cream. Will probably try again with the sour cream to see if it could make THAT much difference.

These were light and really tasty. I think I might add more apricots next time. I wanted smaller scone servings and made thin triangles. Small rounds would have been a wiser choice as the triangles sort of collapsed in the oven. Didn't harm the taste any, though.

I thought the scones needed a little more. I used about 3/4 c. of apricots and also added a 1/2 c. of crystalized ginger to give the scones a kick and they were fantastic!

This is a very good scone recipie. Those who usually pass scones in favor of cereal for breakfast always have these. Unless you have a very sweet tooth, the sugar on top is a bit too much.

I subbed Stoneyfield Farms whole milk cream on top yogurt, not so much to lower the fat as because I just really like the stuff. Fabulous scones, my 19 month old son gobbled one for a snack and greatly approved.

These scones turned out a lot lighter and fluffier than other recipes that I've used- it was a nice change. I used 0,1% Quark instead of sour cream and that lowered the fat content. I'm not sure what Quark is in English, but it's a daiary product with a consistency between yogurt and sour cream. I had to use more than 2/3 cup though.

this is one of my favorite scone recipes - i'm partial to apricots, but have substituted many other dried fruits and berries with equal success - i've also replaced the sour cream with either plain or vanilla yogurt on occasion, and these scones are always great

I eat these scones for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The first time I baked them for 20 min. on a dark baking sheet, and they burnt to a crisp (the apricots burnt to a rubber). The next time I baked for 10-15 min. on an insulated sheet, watching closely, and they came out like a dream. I think that if you chop the apricots v. small, you get more even apricot flavor incorporated throughout the dough. also, the more apricots you can get inside the dough, rather than on the top, bottom, or sides, the better, since they burn so easily.

Rating: 3
I didn't do the topping (lazy and forgetful) and used 3/4 cup sour cream to finish up what I had in the container. They were really, really good. Next time I'll do the topping.

Rating: 4
This was by far the easiest scone recipe I have come across. I was short on the sour cream, so I substituted a tablespoon w/vanilla yogurt and increased the apricot portion. I also added sliced almonds and the recipe came out excellent. The scones baked in 20 minutes to a light golden brown (depends on the oven I guess). I make this recipe almost weekly it was such a hit!

I've made this recipe for years and people always love them. A tip - use your food prcessor to cut in the butter. My hands fatigue easily so I tried the processor and was pleasantly surpised with an even lighter scone than ususal.

Made these for Mother's Day brunch along with Spinach Puff Pastry Quiche and it was a hit. Followed advice and use 1 cup sour cream. Flattened the dough to about 3/4 inch and cut diagonally to yield 17 scones. They puffed up and were the perfect size. Brown sugar topping was a nice touch.

Scones were done after 15 minutes - in fact, they were almost overdone. I made this with dried cranberries and they did have great texture (very moist), but I found the flavor weak. If you use cranberries perhaps some orange zest would perk these up.

These scones rise beautifully, and the brown sugar glaze is wonderful!! Maybe it's my oven, but the scones were starting to burn at 20 minutes. Next time I'll try 18 minutes.

These are wonderful scones. I followed the advice of adding more sour cream (I added a full cup) which made them wonderfully moist. I brought them as gift to dinner party hosts with a jar of my favorite jam. They were all eaten up before dinner! I can't wait to make these again

These are delicious and are now my favorite scones. I dispensed with the brown sugar on top and like to cut the dried apricots rather coarsely. Think I'll make some today!

Absolutely the best scones! The sour cream makes them wonderfully moist (and adding a bit more is OK, too). I used finely chopped dried cranberries, apricots and pecans. The brown sugar topping makes them extra special. These are my husband's very favorite. They warm up easily (in micro or oven) after being frozen, so I make extra to have for morning tea.

I made this recipe to bring to an Engagement Tea. The response was wonderful...everyone loved them and some requested the recipe! I also increased the sour cream to one cup and used 'craisins' (sweetened cranberries) instead of apricots. Delicious!

I've been making these scones since the recipe was first printed, and they are always delicious. For a brunch menu, I make them small (1/2 or even 1/3 original size). Sprinkle the brown sugar sparingly and it will not burn. Buy pre-diced dried apricots and they go together in a snap.

I love all scones with sour cream in the recipe (the sour cream seems to make moister scones) and these are one of my favorites. They are also delicious with dried peaches or dried nectarines. They freeze really well. Just wrap each in foil and warm in the oven when you're ready to have one.

These were excellent. I used a whole cup of sour cream as well. The brown sugar topping was a really nice touch. Next time I will chop the apricots very very small, they were a bit much this time.

Scrumpdelicious! I didn't have apricots so I used frozen blueberries (tough to incorporate but worth it). These are not like the usual dense and very dry scones. I too used the whole cup of sour cream and omitted the brown sugar topping.

I agree - these scones are heavy. Plus, I didn't like the dried apricots - maybe I did not chop them small enough. I put turbinado (Sugar In The Raw) on top and that worked well.

These are not worth the effort. The scones have a heavy texture & are not as sweet as I like. I also didn't like the brown sugar topping as they tended to burn in places leaving the taste of burnt marshmallows.
