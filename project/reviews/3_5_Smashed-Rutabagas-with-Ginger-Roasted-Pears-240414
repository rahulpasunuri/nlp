Wow! Absolutely wonderful! First time with this dish and it'll continue to be a holiday staple. Used pure maple sugar rather than cane. I was very concerned about the possibility of bitterness overwhelming the dish but it was only slight, and immediately offset by the sweet and savory. Next time, a couple tbspns Sauvignon Blanc to further deglaze the roasting pan.

I gave this recipe 2 forks because I think it's a good recipe, but I won't make it again. We don't eat a lot of rutabagas here in the south, and this recipe didn't change our mind. They were bland, the texture was off - just not good. The ginger pears are great over ice cream though!

I took a chance on this recipe. Remembering the rutabagas of my childhood, I wanted a little nostalgia but wondered if my family would find them palatable. This recipe filled all needs -- I got to experience a taste from the past and my family tried something that was new that they held in suspicion. Six of six adults liked it a lot and one of two children ate some. For the kids we called them "root vegetables" rather than rutabagas, so that we could try later if they didn't want them right now.

While all the adults said before our Thanksgiving dinner they'd either never eaten rutabaga or didn't like it, everyone did eat some of this delicious recipe and commented favorably. One one and a half pound rutabaga and three pears were quite enough for ten adults with a good dab left over.

This was great - at Thanksgiving, a lot of food tends to be mashed, so it's nice to give it a little extra oomph and texture with the pear. A big hit! However, with both heavy cream and butter, I wouldn't consider this 'low-cal' - especially for a vegetable dish! - as the side bar says.

I love rutabagas and often don't get have them at Thanksgiving because others don't feel the same. This year, I found this recipe and was so pleased with the results that it will be a new Thanksgiving tradition! I used 3 pounds of rutabagas and 3 pears as well--YUMMY!

I used 3 lbs rutabaga and 3 pears. I might use another pear next time because I like that sweetness but this was very popular with our guests. Because of gdemartini's comments I was concerned about reheating since I was preparing this dish the day before Thanksgiving, so I stopped at the point of mashing the rutabagas and held the turnips and pears separately. Thanksgiving night I finished the from the point of sauteeing the turnips dish and it was delicious. I rewarmed it slowly as instructed for leftovers the next night and they were just as good as the first night. I don't know what's going to happen with the remaining leftovers!

Rutabagas have been a long-term tradition in my family for Thanksgiving. This recipe is, by far, the best I have tasted. Added pumkin spice and sugar to the rutabagas after mashing. Excellent!

Made these last year. Rutabagas are a must-have Thanksgiving tradition in my family, even though no one really likes them. This recipe is a vast improvement on the basic one my mom always made, but honestly, they still taste like rutubagas. This year I'm looking forward to having my own, rutabaga-free Thanksgiving!

I like rutabagas, but didn't like the thyme with them. I would substitute some fresh grated nutmeg. The pears needed more ginger and sugar.

This was, by far, the favorite side dish at Thanksgiving this year. Everyone loved the subtle sweetness of the pear combined with the rutabagas. We all appreciated that this was something a little different from the usual sides. I thought they were fine reheated too.

This was a perfect side dish to my thanksgiving dinner. When you have so many bold flavors it's nice to have one or two things that are more subtle. The ginger pears and some much welcomed sweetness the rutabega which can otherwise be bitter.

Excellent!! I cut the pear in slices, would even recommend more pear and ginger glaze.

Update - I had some left over and heated them up the next day (as described) and they were horrible so I would not recommend making them ahead of time and reheating.

A really good way of using a much maligned vegetable. I cooked this for my mother, who brought us up on the story of how she and my father, as impoverished students in Edinburgh in the 50s, used to steal swedes from a local field to eke out the rationing that still existed. Nice to see they have gone "gourmet"!

Yes, rutabegas are also known as Swedes.

To Cook from london: Probably your 'Swedes' are our rutabaga. In the midwest USA 60 years ago they were called 'Swede (Swedish) Turnips.

This sounds delicious but I've never heard of rutabaga. Is it the what we call (in the UK) swede?

This is the first time I ever had rutabagas and they were fabulous, however my hubby and I felt it was missing something. We would probably add some nutmeg or clove to give it just a little bit of spice.

This was delicious. I look forward to having this again and again. It's much lighter than mashed potatoes. It looked similar but was just a different animal. I really loved it.

Okay, I'll confess; I didn't make the rutabagas. But the ginger-roasted pears are DIVINE, especially over vanilla ice cream. Oh, good heavens, it is yummy. Now, I'll make the rutabagas too (with an double portion of the pears for dessert!).

Eh! Kinda bland and disappointing!

Really very good. I like rutabaga but we will do this much more often. Also used fresh apples instead of pears. Just a good.

The description for this dish is perfect - the ginger and pears make a perfect balance to the rutabas - making it a delicious side dish.
