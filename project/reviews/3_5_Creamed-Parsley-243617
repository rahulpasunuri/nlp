Excellent! The parsley mellows with blanching. We had lots of parsley from the garden so I decided to try this. My 13 y.o. son who tolerates veggies had a second helping and packed the leftovers for his lunch. I used sour cream instead of creme fraiche. Recommend roughly chopping the parsley before blanching for easier eating.
