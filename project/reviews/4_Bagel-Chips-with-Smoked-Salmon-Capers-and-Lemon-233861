easy appetizer that your guests will devour. Try making this with a good thick potato chip (like Tim's) instead of the bagel chip...

Deceptively good. Who knew an app could be so simple! LOVE IT!

We love this appetizer! The quantity of lemon was a little overpowering. I'll use a little less next time. For the bagel chips, I thinly sliced Asiago bagels and toasted them in the oven for a tasty combo.
