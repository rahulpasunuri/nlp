Really enjoyed this recipe. Did add fresh parsley 1/4 cup and file gumbo at the end- 1 tsp. it was spicy but everyone enjoyed it

I tweaked by omitting oil, blending half of the veggie mixture, used fresh tomatoes (seeded and liquid squeezed out) and seafood stock (less expensive than clam juice, easy to prepare with shrimp shells). Trader Joe's Smoked Andouille Chicken Sausage was great and added a nice heat!

This is a great basic Gumbo recipe. I too used frozen okra and it tasted great to me! Make sure you use andouille sausage. I won't even comment about how I feel about the use of kielbasa in gumbo. ...but then I guess I kind of just did. :)

This was my first time making gumbo, although I have had it many times by friends who grew up in Louisianna. I have to say, that I thought this was just as good as their's, so I was extremely happy. I did double the cayanne & andouille, as I like things a little bit spicy. I also used frozen okra, which worked fine. It was very simple to make (including the roux, which I had also never done before, and was nervous about). Can't wait to taste the leftovers tomorrow!

i can't stand okra. Will it kill the recipe if i leave it out? Cause otherwise it sounds delish.

Forgot to mention. This is a sensibly healthy recipe, especially when made with olive oil. Only other fat will come from Andouille.

Perfect for when your husband goes out and brings home 2 pounds of okra. Great way to learn about roux and gumbo. Mess around with the types of meat or liquid, and it will turn out well no matter what. This type of recipe is hard to mess up. Delicious. Half a recipe worked well in my 8" sauce pan.

Rich flavor.... I would make it again with chicken broth instead of clam juice. You can find andouille sausage in Fairways but not in the local supermarkets.

My husband and I thought this was fantastic and are looking forward to see what the flavors are like after another day. I used this recipe as the base and increased the roux to 3/4 cup oil and probably a bit more flour than that. I used 1 bottle of clam juice, 1 cup of chicken stock and the juice from the can of tomatoes and had the right thickness for us, since I decided to omit the okra. Some might guffaw at that, but I was not keep on the reports of "slime" and did not think it would matter much to the flavor. Next time, I think I will reduce the shrimp and include some chicken as I have seen in other recipes. I had a cajun season blend that I used instead of straight ceyanne and it had the right hot for use. Thanks for the wine recommendations as well as the other reviews as this was a first time gumbo for me!

This has become one of my standard recipes. What I really like about this is the combination of the shrimp and sausage. (We are lucky enough to be able to get fresh shrimp and andouille sausage.) I cook my roux for about 20 minutes on a very low heat until it's a reddish-brown and mostly use low-salt chicken broth. We all really like it here and I will impress my in-laws with this in Florida during the holiday season.

I got some okra from a local farm and decided to make gumbo since I'd never cooked with okra before. I thought the thickness of this was perfect - not sure how "authentic" this was, but my boyfriend ate his entire bowl in about five minutes, which is definitely a success! I would make this again if I happened to have okra.

Although Ive been cooking for years, I had never made a roux before; except for a Cowboy Roux (flour and water). I was a little threatened and afraid to try it. However, when I tried it I found that it was easy. This recipe is easy if you do all your prep work ahead of time (chop your celery, onions, etc.) I used canned stewed tomatoes, but I put them through the food processor first so that the tomatoes would disappear into the stew. This is the best gumbo that we have ever had. I added a pound of chicken breast (chopped), a handful or two of Collards greens (cut up), and about a teaspoon of file just for the sake of tradition.

This has become a standard in our household; easy to make and very tasty. I add more cayenne & a dash of Tabasco. Flavor is dependent on the quality of the sausage, so use good ones!

Rating: 4
used veg oil with the flour in the 300 deg. oven, stirring occasionally until dard brown but not burned. Don't add the shrimp until the last 10 minutes or so of the cooking. Be liberal with garlic as you can't use too much. Use the shrimp stock and don't exceed two bottles of clam juice. Take your time ande enjoy the process! Have made this many times.

This recipe rocks!!!! I cooked the roux slow so as not burn it. It actually takes more like an hour to achieve the good dark red brown but if you prep everything ahead of time the rest is a snap. Now I have cajun food on my mind. Time to look for a etoufee recipe!

I went ahead made the modifications recommended by the Chapel Hill reviewer who merged this recipe with the Forest Gump recipe. OUTSTANDING. I limited her garlic additions to only the first 2T she recommended. I cut the chicken thighs in half, coated a bit with flour and browned them in a little butter in the same pan as the okra before adding to the liquid. I also added muscles instead of the full amount of shrimp, which added a great texture and flavor. Excellent recipe and fun to make.

I served this to my book club one evening... after reading the Secret Life of Bees (as I recall). I used a little too much heat for some of the girls- but I thought it was wonderful.

I LOVED THIS RECIPE! I used half clam juice, half chicken broth. Next time I'll use andouille instead of kielbasa to add extra kick. If you're like me and know nothing about okra, don't worry about the slime. I kept washing it because I thought the okra was bad, but then I looked it up, and you NEED the slime. It acts as the main thickening agent in gumbo. Go slime!

I combined this recipe with another found in Forest Gump Shrimp Co. Cookbook. They had browned 1 pound sliced okra in 2 T. butter. I set this aside for later. Instead I made the roux using 1/2 c butter and 1/2 c flour until chocolate brown, about 20-25 min. You have to watch carefully and stir so it won't burn. I not only used the veggies mentioned in this reipe, but I also added to the roux 1 bunch chopped green onions & 2 T garlic. When it was time to add the liquids I added 2 bottles clam broth to this, plus 4 c.homemade shrimp broth, and 26 ounce chopped tomatoes with juice. I used only 1/2 pound andouille sauage but I also added 2 cut up chicken thighs, the browned okra, the bay leaves, 2 T chopped parsley, 1 T chopped garlic, 1 1/2 t salt, 1/2 cayenne, 2 t. oregano, and 1 sprig thyme. I simmered this only 1 hour and it had a nice flavor then. At the end when you add shrimp I also added a cup of lump crabmeat too., plus a little more garlic. I sprinkled the Gumbo file a little at a time until I got the right taste and hottness for me. This is the first time I have ever made gumb, but I was thrilled with the results and so were my guests.

I thought this recipe was very good. I used red peppers instead of green, couldn't find Okra so I used soy beans and baked the sausage in the oven to avoid all of the grease going in gumbo. Next time I would probably reduce the amount of oil and flour to start.

Rating: 4
This is a wonderful recipe! I added a pound of cut-up boneless, skinless chicken breast with the sausage. (I would've preferred thighs, but couldn't find boneless, skinless ones in my market.) I also added 2 cloves garlic, minced, near the beginning, a large pinch of sugar and lots of freshly ground black pepper. No big changes, but they were good ones for my family. This recipe is fun, not too hard, and the outcome is delicious! This one will go in my Favorites file, for sure.

Rating: 3
I too deviated a bit, in that I used a shrimp stock, like other reviewers, and I used a clove of garlic. The gumbo was fabulous. I just had friends over, who raved and raved. The estimate of 8 servings seems a bit low - I seem to have quite a lot more than that. Enjoy!

Gumbo in Kansas? A friend of mine gave me some fresh okra from her garden so I thought I'd try this recipe. It was simply wonderful! Company fare at its best.

After reading all the comments written about this gumbo, I was hesitant to make it. So many things seemed to go wrong for so many. I am so glad that I did it anyway - It was very tasty! I did make a few adjustments based on previous comments - I added garlic, thyme and chipotle to begin with then added more heat (we like our food HOT). I also added seared pices of salmon in the bolws then gumbo over it - this was delicious! I will definately do this one again!

Carefully read all the reviews, followed the "sage" advise, but still my gumbo came out just okay. It was thinner than I anticipated even though I didn't use as much liquid as called for, and no one asked for seconds. I was eating this stuff for a week.

Being Cajun, I can tell you that everyone here has their own family recipe for gumbo. Some people are rather concrete on what they consider to be "real gumbo". I admit, this is not my idea of a great gumbo but for folks who've never had it, it will do. I like to cook my roux very slowly, up to an hour, sometimes longer. Otherwise it just tastes like burnt flour, which is why a lot of people don't like gumbo. I use oil and a lot more flour, makes a less greasy gumbo. There's a lot of things I'd change here but that would make it complicated.

This is one of our favorite dishes. We love it. We use chicken instead of shrimp. It's the perfect dish for a cold day.

Make sure you get the double-smoked kielbassa for the gumbo. Very nice dish and easy to make as well. Went with the 1/2 clam juice and 1/2 chicken broth and it worked out great.

I've made several versions of gumbo in the past and this recipe offered the best changes to date. Everyone loved all the vegtables and the clam juice added a very nice flavor. I went with 1/2 clam juice and 1/2 chicken broth because we like our jumbo more soupy. I agree with a previous cook who said you can never use too much garlic! Great suggestions about cooling (prevents separating). Thanks.

The rating on this was given due to the response I had from my friends who ate this deeelish dish. I must admit that I improvised and combined this recipe with another on this site. I decided to use this one because it did have Roux. The changes I made were based on my preference so no offense to the recipe originator.I cut back on the celery, a little more oregano and cayenne pepper, and 3 bottles of clam juice, substituting the other 2 bottles with 1 can beef broth. My only claim to its turn out was that I used plenty of spicy cajun saugage when preparing my roux. Everyone loved it.I can't wait to make it again-Thanx

This is yet another recipe I've been making for years. Let's be honest here, if you're on a diet or not into calories, don't make this dish. But if those aren't concerns for the evening, this is a great gumbo and it comes together quick. I'm allergic to seafood so I substitute Campbell's chicken broth instead of the clam juice and boneless skinless chicken thighs for the shrimp, when we don't have company. I season them with salt, pepper, garlic powder and oregano. I then saute them in olive oil until brown. I add the chicken the last 15 minutes of the cook time and this recipe comes out "kickin" every time. I doubled the amount of cajun season salt as well as the other spices as a general rule. I also recommend that you get a dark roux going because that accounts for half of the flavor.

This recipe needed some doctoring, as some previous reviewers have said. I started by using the shrimp shells & tails to make about 28 oz of fish stock. I cut the clam juice down to 12 oz. I added garlic (you can never have too much) and "gumbo file" (basically, powdered sassafrass root). I only used one green pepper and one large onion. The tomatoes went in, WITH their juice. I also cut back on the okra - I don't like it all that much and the file replaced the okra, for thickening.

I was tired of rich food so I substituted scallops for the sausage. I also didn't use clam broth but made a shrimp stock from the shells and some shrimp with the heads on. We just loved it. Not overly spicey but really good and satisfying.

Rating: 2
The recipe itself is pretty terrible looking, so I fixed it before I made it - use all of the suggestions others have made here, plus - only 1 onion, 1 and 1/2 bell peppers, use only 2 bottles of clam juice and make a shrimp shell "stock" with about 24 oz. of water. don't drain the plum tomatoes, just toss everything in. The garlic is an absolute must. Cut down a touch on the okra and put in a bit more cayenne, salt, and oregeno when you add the minced garlic. You MUST darken your roux before adding the veggies.

Rating: 4
Because I had read all of the reviews before making this, I decided to cut the amount of clam juice down to 3 eight-ounce bottles. The other changes I made were: adding 3-4 lbs. of fresh shrimp, an additional 28-ounce jar of plum tomatoes, a few squirts of tabasco, and more salt. I let it simmer for hours! It was fantastic--especially the next day after sitting in the frig all night (but, isn't just about everything?) Also, I definitely agree with the reviewer who said that it paid to spend the time letting the "roux" get chocolate-y brown. I did that, too (mostly because I didn't know exactly what color to look for) and it came out with the MOST DIVINE smoky flavor. If I'd cooked it any longer, it wouldn't gone from smoky flavored to BURNED flavor in no time--so be careful.

This dish is awful. I love gumbo and was attracted by the relative simplicity of this recipe. However, this particular recipe is simply the equivalent of drinking straight clam juice. It's terrible and I would advise you to either seek another recipe or just go out to a local cajun restuarant.

Just came back from the Gilroy Garlic Festival where besides all the great garlic dishes, there is one booth in particular called Louisiana Cajun Cooking and they do the most incredible jambalaya, shrimp gumbo, etc. I am now looking for a receipe comparable to theirs - this receipe looks fairly close. I agree with the rest of you that the person from the South that made the tacky comments has no business being on this site.

Rating: 3
This is a great recipe! Not sure what the problem is with the 'cook form the south' I have been searching this site for a while and it seems that there are just as many Cajun recipes as any other kind of cuisine. If you don't like the recipe, don't use it. By the way, what is a "nimwit"? I have heard of a nitwit and a dimwit, but never a nimwit.

I have yet to make this recipe but I was so infuriated by the cook from the south's comment below that I had to respond. This site is for quality people who enjoy life and sharing good food and recipes. Everyone is entitled to an opinion about a specific recipe, but only a very ignorant person would make unjustified, uneducated comments such as yours about nothing in particular. You don't like what's here, so go back to school, smarten up and stay out of this site so the rest of us can enjoy ourselves. You probably can't even spell andouille.

I thought this was a great recipe and easy to make. I made a few changes, primarily to save money. I reduced the shrimp to 1 1/2 lbs. and increased the okra to 1 lb. Instead of using 5 bottles of clam juice, I used two. Instead I made a stock of the shrimp shells, something I had seen in other gumbo recipes. Overall, a good recipe. I'll probably tinker with it some more.

This is an exceptional gumbo, especially if you take the time to make a very dark, chocolate roux. And hey, where does this idiot "cook from the south" get off talking about 'cajun' garbage and being trashed by that nimwit Emeril? Wake up stupid, Emeril does CREOLE food, not Cajun!

This is a very nice "base" recipe. I added two cloves of garlic and 1 cup of dark stout (Guinness would do just fine). The result was heavenly. This recipe does not feed 8 people, however. I would recommend doubling it (except for the shrimp).
