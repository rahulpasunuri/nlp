The lemon pudding is delicious, light and fluffy. A perfect companion to a large meal. I however did not feel the need to use all of the sweetened whipped cream called for and used about 3/4 the amount for an even more lemon-y flavor. Perhaps it was a mistake on my behalf, but I didn't find the meringue's added much. The texture was a bit off putting and I'd have rather just added some chopped pistachio's to the pudding for a salty contrast. Overall the pudding is a real winner and so easy!.

This was dessert was perfect with our Easter feast! I made the lemon curd and meringue cigars in advance as suggested. There was enough meringue to make way more than eight cigars, so I chopped additional pistachios and made bite sized-meringues with the left overs. This dessert will be on the menu again next Easter!

I made this a month or so ago for a group of extended family and it was a hit. Everyone gobbled it up, and I am sure would have had seconds if we hadn't provided individual servings. The lemon pudding flavor was fresh and sweet (a tad to sweet, my husband thinks, but I thought it was perfect). It firmed up nicely. I had never made meringue cigars before--they were easy, and the pistachios provided a nice salty contrast to their sweetness. Since I made this a while ago, the precise details elude me, but my husband has talked about the recipe since, mentioning how much he liked it and would like to make it again, so I wanted to add this review.
