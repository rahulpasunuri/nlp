This pasta is in our regular rotation. We need to eat dairy & gluten free so use good quality Italian corn fusilli and omit the butter & cheese. I finish the sauce with a bit of extra virgin olive oil instead of butter and serve grated parmesan on the side for guests. I make this with spicy lamb merguez (gluten free) and required amount of dried chillies and at the risk of this no longer being a 'bloke's' pasta, I often add either a cup of shelled peas for the last 5 min of cooking or sauteed zucchini or asparagus to get a bit of green into my two blokes who love this pasta. We love lots of finely chopped parsley for added flavour and colour.

This was delicious. I prepared exactly as directed except for parsley which I don't care for. Tasted even better reheated for lunch! Will certainly ad this to my repertoire.

Delicious and so easy. Picky husband loved it. Made as directed but didn't have a mortar and pestle so I put the fennel seeds on a cutting board and squished them with the back of an ice cream scooper. Worked great. The lemon zest really makes this dish special.

Probably deserves another half a fork from me. Excellent simple recipe for the home cook. So easy, a bloke could make it. I like the "approximate" measure; they could make a cook out of me yet. Invest in the fennel seeds. They're cheap. And then search Epi for other fennel seed recipes. Two years ago, I didn't know what to do with them. Now I don't know what to do without them. Don't skimp on the Parmesan, either. Donate the pre-grated sawdust in your fridge to the local honky-tonk to help soak up the blood, then get some real Parm/Parm Reggiano and grate what you need. If you have leftover parsley from another recipe, this is a great use for it (also try various chimichurri sauces.) I'm not a fan or opponent of Oliver, but this recipe is easy and delicious. Try half sweet Italian sausages and half spicy. As for the wine, the rest of the bottle has to go somewhere...

My boyfriend and I love this recipe on a cold Chicago night. We've made it a couple times now with locally made polish sausage which was surprisingly perfect (it really balanced out the other flavors in the dish). Also, we prefer it with some homemade orchiette pasta, it picks up the sauce nicely and is a lovely shape with the crumbly sausage. Paired nicely with an italian red wine and pear and butter lettuce salad.

For a less than 30 minute meal, delicious, filling, and easy. I never have fennel seeds but the sausage I use has them, so I leave them out. And I use red pepper flakes instead of the crumbled red chilli. I also use about half the sausage and it's still tasty.

Loved this. Okay, didn't follow the recipe but for those who are like me and wonder if this works -- I skipped the fennel (didn't have it) and chili pepper (didn't have it and was serving to kids who don't like spicy). Used fully cooked Italian chicken sausage, sliced. After that, I followed the rest of the recipe and it was simplicity at its finest. A great weeknight meal in our house.

Beautiful. A lovely change from our usual cream or bechamel pasta dishes. I halved the recipe for 2 people, but left the wine and lemon quantities unchanged. There was plently left over. Also didn't have any oregano but didn't miss it. Great stuff.

simple and superb, the way ina garten cooks. the only thing i changed/added was some buffalo mozzarella in the end because i was a little short on sausage and a handful of fresh basil. great quick company meal.

This is a simple and flavorful recipe. I used spicy Italian sausage and left out the chili peppers which pretty much equated the same. I also used lemon-pepper linguini instead of the fusilli because that's what I had in the pantry and being New Years day, no markets were open. My wine was a 2006 Wildhorse chardonnay and I used a Meyer lemon picked fresh off our tree. The parsley was also fresh from our garden. We especially liked the combination of spiciness with the lemon and wine. Delicious!

This was a simple and tasty recipe. It was light but with a kick of flavors. I used a spicy Italian sausage and left out the chili peppers which pretty much equated the same. I also used lemon pepper linguini instead of fusilli because that's what I had in the pantry. It worked well- maybe because it added a little more lemon flavor than called for. My lemon was a Meyer; fresh off our tree. We especially liked the combination of spiciness, lemon and wine.

I think this was great. I used a mild chorizo sausage and the recommended amount of chilis. If you don't like spicy, think about using the mild chorizo but leave out the dried peppers. Also, I couldn't get the meat to brown like it says it should in the recipie. Next time, I will use medium-high heat instead.
