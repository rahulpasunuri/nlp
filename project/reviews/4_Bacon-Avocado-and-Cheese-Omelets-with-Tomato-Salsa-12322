Simple omelet recipe. I used leftover Habanero Salsa and added leftover diced avocado to it for a nice (but HOT) accompaniment.

Instead of the tomato salsa, I served it with Salsa Verde. This was a hit with my guests, and one that will certainly be repeated.

Wonderful blend of flavors! I will make this over and over. I added a little leftover avacado to the salsa. YUM!

Very very yummy! And the only thing I didn't already have was the avocado.

Very good recipe for Sunday morning omelets! At just two eggs an omelet, these turned out to be light and not as heavy as many other recipes. Yum!

This is an avocado lover's dream! This is a 5 fork rating. The combination of avocado, bacon, cheese and eggs is terrific! Easy to fix and soooooo good. I added a little sharp cheddar with the Monterey Jack which gave it a nice flavor. I used 4 bacon slices (2 slices per omelet). I cut the bacon in small pieces, browned it and then used some of the bacon grease to cook the omelet in. That added to the flavor too. The Salsa was really good with this omelet. After placing some salsa on top I placed a big dab of sour cream and a little grated cheddar cheese. This made a nice presentation. This is a favorite for sure!!
