I followed the suggestion of others and baked the eggplant instead of frying it. I also added garlic and some fennel seeds to the onion saute, and half a teaspoon of red pepper flakes with the marinara. Very tasty, and a bit more fancy than plain old pasta and sauce.

Great recipe. Entire family loved it. Took other's recommendations and roasted the eggplant (tossed with 2-3 tbsp olive oil, kosher salt and minced garlic) for 30 minutes at 425F. Used 32oz. Rao's Homeade marinara sauce since it was on sale at WF. Other than that followed the recipe. Love the fact that it is meatless. Even better the next day! Will definitely make again.

Yum! The hubby said "I'm a fan, even though this is EGGPLANT". I added garlic powder and crushed red pepper, next time I might try baking the eggplant as some other reviewers suggested, just to make it a little healthier.

I got raves from my DH. I roasted the eggplant in the oven, as suggested previously, to avoid little oil sponges in the sauce. I also added a clove of garlic, some crushed red pepper to the onions, and threw in some chopped baby spinach at the very end of cooking the sauce. I used Whole Foods Eggplant Marinara sauce (it's what I had...but worked well). I also added a bit of goat cheese on the top of each serving and it was delicious. Will definitely be making this again!

This was fantastic and easy. It makes a TON of food (which is good because my 3 year old daughter and I both went back for more). I made several modifications because I like a bit more spice and the idea of using a cup of oil was a little much. I did the following: 1) Tossed the eggplant in a few tablespoons of olive oil and roasted it for 30 min rather than frying it 2) Added 2 cloves of garlic and some red pepper flakes to the onions 3) Used more sauce (1 jar marinara + 1/2 jar of arrabiata) 4) Added spinach to the sauce and tossed some grape tomatoes into the mix before baking. Kalamata olives would also be great in this. 5) Used smoked mozzarella

The recipe is a good start but I made several additions that made it FABULOUS. I sprinkled the onions with cayenne pepper to add a kick and used smoked mozzarella instead of regular. Instead of sauteing the eggplant in olive oil I dipped the cubes in egg and covered them in seasoned italian breadcrumbs. Then I drizzled them with olive oil and baked them at 350 until crispy and golden brown. The breaded eggplant adds more flavor and texture. I will definitely make it again soon!

I would really give this 1.5 forks -- somewhere between okay and good. I was just disappointed in this recipe because there's not much going on with it. I will make this again, but next time would add hot italian sausage, black olives, red pepper flakes, some green peppers with the onions, etc. This was just way too bland for our taste.

This dish was FANTASTIC. However, I did increase the sauce to 2 3/4 cups of sauce instead of 2 1/2. It was Perfect!

This casserole is wonderful! The first time I made it, I cooked it for the suggested 45 minutes. The top was very crunchy; really too crunchy for my taste. The second time I made it, I only baked it 40 minutes. The results were much better - rigatoni was not so dry and not nearly as crunchy. I think adding calamata olives would be good, too.

Very good. Also used a little more sauce, and added some crushed red pepper to the onions while sauteeing. Good quality, fresh mozzarella really makes the dish.

This was fabulous. I did use more sauce than called for, simply because I like my pasta saucy. I highly recommend using fresh mozzarella for this recipe and the only thing I will change when I make this again someday will be to thin my somewhat thick homemade marinara sauce. While baking in the oven, the pasta absorbed some of the moisture and the rigatoni on top got a little dry. Otherwise terrific.
