Very popular and easy finger food. Some tricks I used to make things easier were: * Dip cookie cutter in a little flour every 3rd or fourth cut to keep the cookies from sticking. * Use a 1/4 tsp measure to make the indendation in the cookie and a 1/8 tsp measure to scoop the fig. Then use the back of the 1/4 tsp measure to push out the fig mixture into the indentation. * I agree that 1/8 inch thick is too thin and I went for the 1/4 inch thickness.

Really good! I'm leaving off a fork because it needed some changes for me: -I rolled some as thin as the recipe called for and others thicker (1/4"). The thicker ones were much better. -Needs less jelly, even though I love it. It melts and spills over. -I took it out after the time stated and it was okay. I put it back in on convection for 8-10 minutes and it was phenomenally better, both the thin ones and the thicker ones. Browning it a tad helps the cheese flavor. The whole family loved it! It really would be perfect to take to a tea, a shower, or something similar.

I made a double batch for a large party. These were SO easy to make and so fast. I got tons of compliments on them.

maybe it was me, but this was really disappointing

Good but not great. I would recommend rolling the dough to 1/4" + and using less than 1/4 t of preserves, the jelly over powered the subtlty of of the shortbread. Looked very nice, but didn't taste as good as it sounded. I probably won't make this one again.

Excellent combination of flavors. Loved by everyone and gone in minutes.

This was so easy and so good. Use a really good quality blue cheese to make it awesome, and I added in just a hint of rosemary and it was amazing!

Easy to make. I followed other's suggestions and added about 1/2 tsp salt.Cut out with a soda bottle top, but had to bake about 15" I also rerolled scraps several times to use all the dough without any difference in taste or appearance.

Delicious, fun to make & unusual. I used packaged crumbled blue cheese which didn't have a strong enough flavor. Couldn't fine a 1" cookie cutter in the local kitchen shop, so my smart husband suggested we use the screw top from an open bottle of red wine. It was the perfect size!

Just perfect! Also yummy with tomato relish...use your imagination.

Easy, elegant and best of all, make-ahead! Served at a Christmas cocktail party. Lovely addition to the appetizer selection.

So utterly easy and so good. I did the blue cheese/fig and the cheddar cheese/pepper jelly for a neighborhood party. Both were terrific. Actually, I don't find a lot of difference in taste between the two. Just good, buttery, crispy yummy. What more do you want? I followed the recipe exactly and baked for just over the max time. Delish!

After reading all of the amazing reviews I thought I would try it out. I found these to be lacking in flavor. The concept is great so I might try it again with different a different cheese.

These are very good and the fig preserves do add a twist to the cracker that is delightful. They are best warm, are okay room temperature, but are not good the next day. (Fig gets too sticky.) Easy to make but messy. May do again.

These are good though a little fragile to work with. I used gorgonzola instead of blue cheese. This is similar to a crusting recopied we got from Bobby Flay. Cibatta bread, gorgonzola and fig spread. Outstanding.

As tasty & easy as everyone says, but wondering if anyone else got DOUBLE the yield? When rolled out to 1/8" as recipe directs and using a 1" cutter (which is very small!), I got close to 100 little one-bite savories. No complaints, mind you, but until I took them out of the oven at exactly 12 minutes, I was kinda worried I'd screwed up. Also, it's a challenge to make an indentation in something only 1/8" high! Next time I'll make them 1/4" thick and just bake them a little longer. Agree a spot of salt is warranted.

Quick, easy and everyone loved them!! I cooked them for 15 minutes and once they cool completely they firm up.

Has anyone made these in advance of a party and froze or stored them successfully?

This is a wonderful recipe. It is delicious as written, and fun to embellish. I added a handful of walnuts to the dough. One time I was out of fig jam so I used Mark and Stephen's Strawberry Mango jam. The dough can be soft and difficult to handle. Instead of rolling it and cutting circles, I make a log, wrapped it in parchment and refrigerated the dough. I stored the dough in a split paper towel tube, which helped it stay in a cylinder. After a few hours I just sliced the tube into nice thin circles.

Very easy and foolproof. Followed the recipe, except chilled the dough before rolling it out. Used the cap of a spice bottle to get 1.5" circles. Made a few with red pepper jelly as well as fig jam. Delicious and very attractive small bites. Guests asked for the recipe.

I made these for my husband while we were watching football. I used small pieces of dried figs because I had no fig jam and it worked perfectly. I will definitely make these again.

Insanely easy for something that everyone loved! We did a taste test with fig preserves and a pepper jelly and the pepper jelly won hands down. The fig was very sweet for our taste. Also, had similar issues with others on lack of salt. We fixed this by adding two little slivers of cooked bacon on top while they were cooling on the rack. This one will be a house favorite!

Such an elegant, easy, delicious appetizer. Took to several parties for appetizer buffet tables. I sprinkled a little crumbled blue cheese on the platter so that grazers would understand that these were not sweet cookies. People love getting a few cheese crumbles on top of the fig jam.

Very tasty and very rich. I think I overworked the dough a bit but it still worked out. Unfortunately, I failed at using the pizza cutter to make the squares (I don't have a one inch cookie cutter) and the crackers where not all that pretty to look at. Which meant they weren't for company but, delightfully, all for the family!

This sounds fantastic but I have not made this yet. Any suggestions on other types of cheeses to use?

Delicious and easy. Cut mine in the shape of stars and used hot pepper jelly. They looked beautiful and festive for a holiday party. Only change I will make next time is to add a little salt to the dough. Although the cheese is salty, I think all the flavors will pop more with thee addition of a pinch of salt.

Super easy, super good. Let it all come together in the food processor. Didn't knead. Rolled into 36 balls and proceeded like a thumbprint cookie. Cooked for the full 12 mins as suggested. Will probably sub the blue cheese for gorganzola (sister hates blue) and do a goat cheese/lavender version for spring. Will try the pepper jam too! Yummy!!

This will be the new Cheese Straw in my Southern kitchen. Also like the idea of some with pepper jelly as a sub. Thanks for sharing!

this was a stunningly easy and delicious recipe. I didn't have figs, but had dates, so pureed them and put on top. Amazing.

Lovely! I ran out of Fig Prserves while making a huge Christmas batch as a result I substituted pepper jam. The added kick was a delight.

This appetizer is a winner...just a few ingredients, quick to put together and delicious!! I had forgotten I had lent my food processor and at midnight it wasn't time to reclaim it so I blended the butter and cheese and then added the other ingredients and everything worked fine. The food processor would have made this easier but it wasn't impossible. These were selected for an office party and my biggest problem was keeping my husband away. Definitely took 12 min+ to cook to perfection.

These were really good. Sorta putsy but still worth it. Looked really pretty lined up on a long platter. A hit at the holiday party.

Followed recipe for the first batch. They were really good. On second batch, added and extra ounce of bleu cheese, 3oz shredded parmesan/asiago/romano blend. Extra cracked pepper and...de-lish!

These are sooo good and easy to make! I ran out of fig jam so I used apricot, yummmm. I cant wait to share them with my guests!!!

Excellent Appetizer. It was a big hit at my party and it looked good too. I had to add a few tablespoons water because I couldn't press it into a ball (I had old flour which might have factored into it). also, go for the longer cooking time to bring out the flavor.
