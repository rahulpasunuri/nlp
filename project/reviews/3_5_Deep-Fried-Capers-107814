I do it much more simply. Drain a 5 oz jar of capers in a seive. Fry in 1/3 cup olive oil in a samll frying pan. I like to fry for several minutes to make them crispy. Makes a really nice topping for Bolognese spaghetti

I served these little goodies over salmon with roasted garlic. Delicious!

A local chef gave me a recipe for sun-dried tomato tapenade that called for fried capers as a garnish. I had never done this before either. Wow, were they good. Everyone was looking for more capers after the "garnish" was gobbled up! The preparation was similar - just saute in hot (but not too hot) olive oil, drain and cool.

I haven't made these, but I'm excited to see a recipe for them. For those of you who think frying capers is strange, give it a chance! I had them on a smoked salmon salad in a restaurant and absolutely loved them! They're crispy and salty and yummy.
