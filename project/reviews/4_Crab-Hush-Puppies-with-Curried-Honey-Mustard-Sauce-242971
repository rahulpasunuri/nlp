So delicious! I added a little extra corn bread mix, as my first patch turned into hashbrown/latke splooge. I used crab meat from a container, because I didn't have time to crack my own. It may have been a little extra moist because of that. Match sure the oil is hot enough too. I had a few other ones that disintegrated because the fat was too cool. But I just scooped the out, put some sauce on, and ate them while I fried the rest!

my forks are not real, yet, but i wanted to encourage everyone to read ALL the comments. the chef's recipe is really helpful and his freezing techbnique brilliant. also, minced clams might be a good sub for crab.

These are delicious however when I dropped the spoonfuls into the oil, they just spread and turned into crumbs. I added some flour, shaped them into balls and they fried up fine. I used 1/2 the amount of crab for cost reasons and they were rich with crab. The recipe is easy and goes together quickly - Sauce is good; they were a hit at my party

Great recipe. My first time deep fat frying. Nice and light. I used Martha White corn muffin mix and added 2 Tbs of dry instant buttermilk to the batter and 2 tsp of roasted dry ginger to the dipping sauce. These were a real hit at our al fresco dinner for 6. Next time I'll try adding some fresh corn kernels to the batter.

These came out beautifully. The oil temperature really drops once you start frying them, so patience is a virtue. I might also add a little salt to the batter, they could use a little edge.

This did not work for me - I don't know if I did something wrong but the puppies did not hold together at all - they just fell apart into the oil and created an inedible mush.

I made this as an appetizer for my families tradition Christmas Eve get together. They were delicious! I also had no problem with them falling apart, I believe the key is low water content in your crab mixture and a sufficiently hot oil temperature. It is really helpful to have a thermometer on hand to monitor the temp of the oil! I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce, it just wasn't what I was expecting. The mustard was nice, I think it may have been the curry that I didn't enjoy. All in all a very tasty, surprising appetizer! Very simple to prepare, just keep an eye on their color. When they are golden brown, pull them out of the oil and blot with paper towel to cut down on the grease!

These are fabulous. I entertain a lot and am a pretty darned good cook, but I have to say that this recipe confused the heck out of me. I bought my crab meat at Costco in an 18 oz. container (jumbo lump crab, about $14). Because it was more than the 12 oz the recipe called for, I initially did 1.5x the recipe. It STILL was a totally ODD consistency; so dry (maybe I squeezed out the crab too much?) and not enough cornbread! I finally ended up using the entire package of cornbread mix (about 3 1/4 c.) and nearly the entire bottle of clam juice (almost 1 C.). I was concerned that the ratio of crab to cornbread would be off but because I didn't dice the crab and just folded and smooshed it into the cornbread the shreddy bits of crab went throughout the cornbread mixture, so it was great. I didn't serve it w/ the sauce (was unimpressed by the reviews); instead I served it with a remoulade (mayo, soy sauce, apricot jam, scallions, ginger, whole grain mustard, dried mustard) and they got rave reviews. Don't load the pan with more than 4 or so, as the oil temp drops quickly. I used a small ice cream scoop to easily dish out the batter, and it worked like a charm.

i made these for my fiance on his birthday and they were an extreme hit. i had fun snacking on the lump crab meat while making these also. i also purchased some "bone smack'n" mustard for the base of the dipping sauce and it was delicious

These were really delicious with the dipping sauce. I tries baking have to cut down on the fat, but they defintely tasted better fried in oil.

Can these hush puppies be oven baked instead of frying them?

I was a little bit weary of this recipe because of the mixed reviews but I tried it and it was easy and great. For those who find it too watery, try adding flour. I didnt need to but its a good rule of thumb. It is also possibly that your oil wasnt hot enough. Mine fried as soon as they hit the oil so there was no chance of them falling apart. Also, is it possibly you added water to the box recipe? The recipe does not call for that. I couldnt find a box of "just add water corn mix" The only ones I found called for egg too. So i looked at other recipes and made my own. It came out pefect: 2 c. yellow cornmeal 1 c. all-purpose flour 2 T. baking powder 2 T. sugar 1 tsp. salt 1 tsp. black pepper 2 large eggs 1½ c. whole milk (I used soy and it came out fine) I then added the curry power and 1/4 cup clam juice as the recipe called. I used 2 tablespoons to shape the balls, and dropped them in the oil without any problems. Try it!

I, too, thought this was a delicious recipe, and simple to make. I had no trouble with the little hush puppies staying together while frying. However, I agree with the reviewer that if felt like a little of a waste to use good crab in a recipe like this, where the delicate flavor of crab is not the centerpeice. I would be interested in trying with another main ingredient, if anyone has any ideas.

I thought they were quite simple to make, and very tasty also. However, I thought that using crab in them was a bit of a waste--with the relatively strong spices in these, you really can't taste the delicate flavor of the crab. I think you could have just as easily (and a lot more cheaply) used a flaked white fish. I'm going to try this again substituting something for the crab.

This was VERY simple to make and very tasty. I had no problem with the consistency.

this recipe sounds great and easy. just make sure the crab meat is well drained, and if still too watery, add more cornbread mix.

Well, I used very dry crab, but mine still swelled up in the oil and got pretty greasy. Three stars 'cause they were delicious, but I'm waiting for someone to crack this recipe for us all.

In response to using a cornbread 'mix': I make hush puppies for my restaurant using 12 cups of cornmeal, 3 tablespoons of baking powder, and 2 tablespoons of salt. For liquid, I use 2 medium onions minced, 6 cups milk, and 2 cups water. (I have added eggs and sugar to make a 'sweet' hushpuppy - try this with dried cranberries! Delete the onion, though!). It makes a slurry like wet sand, but not too wet. The moisture content affects cooking time/appearance. Adding the crab to this mix and adjusting the milk/water amount would work just fine. The green onions sound like a nice touch, too. I freeze my hush puppies in foil lined cookie sheets for 40 minutes, then cut with my handy Graham Kerr spatula- thingie, freeze till hard, break apart and package. To cook, just drop them into a 350 degree pot for a couple of minutes. I'm going to try adding the crab, since we have exceptionally fine crab here (although rather expensive).

I haven't tried this recipe, so the fork is fake. But I do have a question about this, and any other recipe that calls for cornbread mix. One simply cannot purchase cornbread mix where I live. I make a rather good cornbread. Would the right ratio or scale of my dry cornbread recipe work? On the face of it, one would think yes, but the wet ingredients include fat and egg, so I am never sure, and tend to skip recipes that call for mixes. Hope I'm not hijacking, but would appreciate responses, since this does look yummy. Thanks!

I thought this recipe was fantastic! Maybe better as crabcakes, but the crab to cake ratio was perfect. You could really taste the crab. The sauce was a little overkill, would be better with chicken fingers.

I think you are right, the crab must have had to much water in them. I ended up turning them into crab cakes to avoid them melting away. Flavorwise, they tasted great. But they weren't hush puppies.

I completely disagree, orahman. These may be the best hush puppies ever. So flavorful with their curried kick. I didn't have a problem with the water content. Maybe the crab meat you used was watery? I made these for a party, and they were much appreciated. I found that I could form the hush puppies ahead of time, chill them on a baking sheet, and then just fry them before serving. So simple.

This was one of the worst hush puppy recipes I've ever tried! Without freezing or reducing the water content, the puppies won't hold together and disintegrate upon hitting the oil! Will never make this one again!
