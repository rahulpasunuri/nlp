These were okay but I did not think they were anything special. I am going to try a couple of the other recipes, though, notably the lemon bars and the pecan ones.

These brownies were very easy to make and the shortbread crust adds a nice touch to the look and taste of the brownie. I agree... dust on some confectioner's sugar!

I made these for a bake sale. Bad idea - only because after I tasted one I was tempted to eat rather than sell! I am a bit of a chocolate fiend, I confess, but these were easy, sold very well and people who tried one came back for more.

This was a very good brownie recipe, we loved the shortbread base. It was so easy to make and wasn't dry at all. I made this at the last minute with things I had in my cupboard. It's an excellent way to satisfy a chocolate craving.

I decided to bake these on the spur of the moment, and was done practically before I started-- they're that quick and easy. Delicious, too. I pulled the bars out of the oven after only 30 minutes; the extra five minutes would've made them too dry. I also spritzed the pan with non-stick spray, just in case. Sift powdered sugar on top when cool for a prettier appearance.

Very good bars. Nice texture, not too sweet, simple and quick recipe. Don't know what problems others had with this but the only one I had was trying not to eat too many. Only change I made; added chopped walnuts to the chocolate batter. Will make again and again!

This recipe was easy to follow and didn't take long. The brownies were amazing and a huge hit. I don't think I undercooked them, but they were a little on the soft side. They're great to eat that way, but difficult to cut and plate. Oh, I forgot that I didn't have the chocolate and had to run to a convience store. I ended up using milk chocolate with almonds and was pleased with the results.

This recipe is too much. The brownie on it's own is very good but why put it on top of the shortbread which is very good in the lemon bars? These brownies are like lead bricks! I'll stick to my regular brownie recipe.

My kids wolfed these down and asked me to definitely make them again. They are my harshest critics, and when they like something, it must be pretty good.

I didn't really like the taste of the brownies that well the first day, but after they had a chance to rest, by the 2nd day they were much better. But, all in all, I thought they were pretty flavorless; not sweet or chocolatey enough. I also didn't really care for the shortcake bottom.

I made it twice, the 2nd time with salted butter and I poured chocolate chips on top. Everyone loved them. They are very moist and rich. They will remain a family favorite from now on. My son suggests using peanut butter morsels on top.

We have made these a few times and everyone loves them. They have never been dry, infact are extremely fudgy. The only problem with them is that they are too rich, you need to cut them small.

This has become a favorite recipe for us. It is easy and very chocolaty. I was surprised to see the first 2 reviews which called the brownies dry. Ours were anything but.

Not enough fudgy chocolate flavor...and a little dry.

Did I do something wrong? Because I found this recipe much too dry, and not very flavorful. Make the lemon bars on the same page instead.
