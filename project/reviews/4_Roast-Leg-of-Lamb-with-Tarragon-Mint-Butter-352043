I love how the orange flavor infuses the lamb. It was a hit for our Easter.

this was my first leg of lamb complete with bone and it was a keeper. also made spring vegetables as recommended but found them to be a bit bland. lamb was superb. I did not use any butter after the two bastings as I did not want the sauce to be greasy. Will definitely make again.

I made this with a lamb leg half the size indicated but kept everything the same including cook time and it came out perfectly. The orange was an interesting flavor dynamic, but next time I may just do garlic instead. The wine sauce was a bit much by itself when I tasted it but was excellent drizzled on everything. I had never roasted anything of this magnitude before but it came out wonderfully. The tarragon/mint flavor was perfect.

I just made this, and most of the menu for my Easter dinner. Yum. I do not normally eat or work with red meat, so I was nervous, but it came out looking and tasting beautiful. The butter was great, the sauce was delicious, and now I'm looking for reasons to make it all over again!

While the herbed butter was quite good, the wine sauce it got added to was not. I used a good Cab Sauv and homemade chicken stock and it wasn't enough to save the sauce - the addition of the butter mixture and orange peel made it unpalatable. Fortunately, there were several tbsp of the herbed butter left to slather on the cooked lamb and I discarded the sauce. The butter is a keeper, the sauce is a fail.

I loved the tarragon/mint flavours with the lamb and veggies. I left out the orange because it didn't appeal to me. Might substitute lemon for the orange next time.

Excellent. The butter makes the dish, and I followed the advice and agree 100 percent with the other commenter(s) who advised increasing the amount of butter for the vegetables. The wine sauce was tremendous as well.

Very good. We couldn't find tarragon vinegar. I soaked white vinegar with an equal part of tarragon, about 1/4 cup each, for 3 hours (the longer the better). Bruise the tarragon first before adding to the vinegar.

I made this per the recipe and it was excellent. In fact, I also had to make a chicken for the non-red meat crowd and used the same herb butter rubbed under the skin for that. It was also excellent. And veggies were great with this butter! Will definitel make again.

I used a boneless leg of lamb from Costco and roasted according to the packages estimate for time. I thought the butter was great and would make more for the veggies. The menu was fantastic!

I made this for easter dinner (and most of the menu) and it was great. I used slices of garlic instead of the organge peel, which gave even more flavour. The herb butter was a hit with my guests. I would use the butter recipe with vegetables anytime.

This was very nice combination, and the lamb looked great. I really didn't get a whole lot of the orange flavor though. The butter mixture used with the paired recipe for carrots, turnips was very good.

I made this for Easter and it was wonderful. So easy to do and came out amazing. Everyone was impressed, but really it was simple. I used white wine vinegar in the butter. I also used the butter for tossing asparagus to serve with it. My cut was a shank and it was the perfect size for our dinner. I would definitely make this again, even just for a family Sunday dinner, no special occasion needed! You could really taste the flavors of the orange, mint and tarragon, even though they were subtle. I used a merlot in the sauce and it was wonderful.

Don't worry about tarragon vinegar, the white wine vinegar or even cider vinegar will work as well. I always prefer an american zinfandel with leg of lamb, something big and full bodied. Ravenswood Lodi is always good at a reasonable price point.

As a sub, I am planning to use red wine vinegar plus fresh tarragon. And definitely serving some california cabs.

I'm planning on making this for easter sunday as well. However I've had a difficult time finding tarragon vinegar. I am assuming I can simply use some light white wine vinegar (or possibly white balsamic) and infuse it with whatever fresh tarragon I'm not using on the rest of the recipe. If anybody has another suggestion, that would be great. Oh and for the person who's wondering what drink pairing to use, I've always found a good pinot noir or red cote du rhone goes very well with any lamb.

I plan to make the menu on Easter, however it included no drink pairings. Does anyone have a recommendation?
