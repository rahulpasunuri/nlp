Good...think I reduced the sauce too much though because I barely had enough....had split recipe in half but only had sauce enough for three. Did not add celery. Used shrimp instead. Pretty good but not fabulous.

I used 1# of the crawfish tails, a small bottle of clam juice, additional cayenne powder,white pepper and served it on rice. It was great. I will use this again.

I thought these were great! I subbed in prawns and used whole milk instead of heavy cream. I used a few different ground hot pepper powders that I have (Ancho chili, etc) and they were nice and spicy!

This was a tasty dish, and we all enjoyed it. Instead of yellow corn flour, I used 1 tbsp yellow corn meal and 1 tbsp white flour. I also let the cream simmer for a little while (about 3-4 minutes, stirring constantly) before I added the cheese, crawfish and green onions to thicken up the sauce a little more.

This dish was a big hit at our house. I substituted half-and-half for the heavy cream as suggested by other cooks--the sauce was rich enough as it was. Since I was out of chile powder, I added a combination of 2 dried chiles and about 1/4 t. of dried chile flakes. I also included about 1/2 t. cumin to add a bit more depth. I used lobster meat for the filling as I had some on hand. It came out great. The only drawback, which I think is easily rectified, was that there could have been slightly more sauce and/or the sauce could have been slightly more liquidy to cover the entire tortilla surface. Of course, I tried to stretch the sauce over 5 enchiladas instead of just 4. I served the dish with a 'Texmati' rice-and-red-beans blend on the side. All in all, a very satisfying, surprisingly textured meal, though certainly not all too light on the calories.

I made this for dinner last night, I made a double batch and it filled a 9x12 baking pan. Also I had some left over grilled tuna, so I used that instead.I used half and half instead of cream. but this recipe is so good that it would be hard to make a mistake. I think you could use any kind of meat, seafood, or fish and it would come out great!

Quite good. I used a combination of chipotle, ancho, and chili powders to add a bit of complexity. Heating the tortillas in the microwave to make them pliable worked well. A rich dish, so served with black beans, rice, and guacamole to cut the heaviness.

This dish was a bit on the creamy side. It had a nice taste. It's a great way to use leftover seafood, crab, shrimp, fish, etc. I'd either mix with or top with sour cream. For myself, I'd add rice or pinto beans or strips of veggies like red bell, summer squash or diced broccoli to diminish the creaminess and add more "chew" texture. I'd also serve this on top of toasted sourdough bread, sort of a "seafood rarebit".

This turned out really well! Used a frozen block of crawfish tails that I defrosted in the microwave. Delicious, restaurant quality!

Nice Cajun twist on a Mexican favourite. I followed the recipe except for using flour tortillas (all I had on hand), subbed 1/2 & 1/2 for the cream, no oil for the tortillas, and sherry/water mixture in place of the stock. Well, that last was a mistake as it made the sauce curdle a bit. Not bad, just a little too thick. I'll stick with stock (probably chicken or veg rather than seafood, as we can't get it here) next time. I'll also follow the other reviewer's suggestion about adding some cumin and crushed red pepper. Altogether, a lovely dish, although VERY filling.

At first I was a little dissapointed with this dish (It seemed to both lack flavor, and not be spicy enough.) However, I realized that I used about twice too much broth as was needed (I used chicken broth instead of fish stock.) The next day, however, the leftovers were amazing. I'll be a little more careful next time, but I'll make it again.

Double this recipe makes a hearty and generous entree for 6. Like many of you, I can't "leave well enough alone", but with these changes this was a truly extraordinary dish: Use fat free half & half (Land O'Lakes makes an outstanding product), instead of the cream; add 1 tsp. of ground cumin and 1/2 tsp. of crushed red pepper. Not having any corn flour or masa harina, I used ordinary flour, as well as plain flour tortillas, instead of the blue corn. Rather than incorporate the green onions into the sauce, I like them best on top, raw, after cooking, for both eye-appeal and texture. This may look like a complicated recipe, but is quite simple, and there's just nothing not to like. Don't bother passing the tortillas through oil to soften. Nobody needs the extra fat, and the microwave will soften them just fine.

Down here we are enchilada "groupies", so tweaked this a bit and made a formidable entree out of it. We used 2T of bacon drippings for the saute part and substituted "4-Cheese Mexican" for both cheeses. Kicked it down a notch by using only 1/2t. of chili powder. Instead of the heavy cream we opted for 1-1/2 c. of reduced fat sour cream. We used 8 flour tortillas and popcorn shrimp rather than crawdads. It makes 8 plump enchiladas, four hearty entrees. Outstanding! We're "sat. fat." watchers and this is the reason we made some changes. Looked good enough for an entree - and it worked! This addendum, please: we deleted the fish stock, using 1 cup chicken broth - 1/3 c into the mix and 2/3 c to soften the flour tortillas.

Made this because I inexplicably had a cup and half of leftver crawfish in the fridge. The directions are seriously lacking, so it took a little improvisation. I eventually added all the ingredients (except for the tortillas and jack cheese obviously). Then I used a slotted spoon to remove the tortilla "filling." Covered them with the remaining (now strained) sauce, topped with cheese, and baked. Worked out pretty well, but there are a few drawmacks. Next time I would strain out the "filling" before adding the cheddar cheese, adding it by sprinkling on the "filling" inside the tortillas instead. Secondly, I'd up the broth (perhaps using chicken broth) and cut down on the cream as the final result was much to rich for this type of dish. Served with rice and beans for a very filling meal. Recipe only makes four "enchiladas" but you can feed four people if you add two "side" dishes.
