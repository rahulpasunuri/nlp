This is one of our favourite fast and easy weeknight meals.I have always followed the recipe exactly, except for an extra tbsp of chipotle as we like it spicy!I suppose it really is all about the amazing tatar sauce but the simplicity of the turkey is really key to the overall success of this recipe.Sometimes we make the sauce as a dip with homemade potato chips...yum!

I agree that it is all about the sauce,but I sub cilantro for the dill, use lettuce instead of arugula, because I live in an area where those items are not easily found. I have tried it the original way, too, and both are good.

I agree with si_chef below. This is all about the sauce. The burgers are tasteless. I also used dry dill. I found that the sauce overwhelmed the tomatoes, onion, amd arugala. Still looking for a moist and delicious turkey burger. This isn't it. The sauce is worth making for other dishes.

This burger is all about the Chipotle- Chili Tartar sauce! I substituted 2 teaspoons of dried dill for fresh and used lettuce instead of Arugula. I also put a slice of extra sharp (white) cheddar cheese on the burgers.

Anything would taste good with this sauce on it! These were outstanding, will become a regular at our house!

The sauce is amazing! Slightly spicy, it makes the whole thing work when the turkey burgers can be quite bland to regular beef eaters.

Made this last night to rave reviews. I didn't have arugula and used some lettuce I'm growing, but even so it was terrific. Obviously, the sauce makes the dish - yum!

I changed this recipe a bit and the results were incredible. I added about half of a diced apple and a diced onion to the turkey, as well as some cumin. Left the dill out of the tartar sauce because I didn't have any. I can't wait to make this again. It's easy and fast, and with such wonderful flavor.

4675 Sorry I said corn for this recipe, but I was referring to the chicken corn chowder which is outstanding and with fresh corn - to die for. as are as this recipe goes, I used small buffalo burger and used this sauce with carmelized onions - yummy

I made this last week using fresh Olathe Ccorn from Colorado (6 ears) the soup was outstanding and I did use the rotisserie chicken without skin...Outstanding!!!

I used to live in Venice and this was my favorite. Hands down the best turkey burger you will ever have!

I use the recipe for the Chipotle-Chili sauce but not the burger recipe. Instead, we use the "Turkey Burger" recipe which is very flavorful and gets raves. Ingredient list for the burgers: 3 medium yellow onions 1 clove garlic 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 1/3 pounds ground turkey breast 3 tablespoons dried bread crumbs 2 tablespoons barbecue sauce 3 tablespoons quick-cooking oats (not instant) 1 teaspoon dried basil 1 teaspoon dried oregano Mix, and grill or fry. The addition of the BBQ sauce (sugar) makes the burgers prone to burning, so cook over low heat. Serve with the great sauce from this recipe.

Oh my gosh, I made this dish for my boyfriend and I and we both loved it. I used cilantro in place of dill like others. My boyfriend eats beef usually, I don't, but he says it was the best turkey burger he has tasted. We used the left over sauce the next night with shrimp. Thank you for the experience!

This was a good sauce. I added minced red onion, yellow and red peppers, and various spices to the burgers before grilling. I think turkey burgers are much more moist when combined with veggies.

This sauce is SO GOOD! I served with grilled plain turkey burgers, tomatoes and arugula on whole wheat bun. Easy and delicious. Served the sauce on egg sandwiches the next day--even better.

This recipe is all about the sauce-the burgers are a no-brainer-but the sauce was yummy and very versatile. Will plan on having it over veggies, etc. Not too bland-not too spicy-just right!

This is wonderful. My family and I loved it! I agree with everyone else about the versatility of the sauce... last night I made tuna salad with it and it was to die for. I will make this again and again.

My husband says these are the best turkey burgers he's ever had, and he's a tough critic! I used jarred,chopped jalepenos instead of the chipoltes in adobo sauce, as well as cilantro in lieu of the dill. I also jazzed up the turkey burgers with chopped shallots, red onion, and cilantro, as well as a couple tablespoons or so of low fat yogurt. Try slices of avocado in addition to the other suggested toppings. Yum! This will be our standard for turkey burgers.

Great sauce, and so easy! I also subbed cilantro for dill (not a dill fan). Will definitely make many times.

This was a super tasty recipe- the mayo is versatile and may go with almost anything. I'd suggest substituting the mayo for yogurt for a lighter topping on the burger as even light mayo was a bit thick. Was still very good and definitely worth making.

I made the sauce with out the chili's because I didnt have any on hand and added some lemon. It was delicious! If you wanted to make a healthier version use fat free plain yogurt instead. I also added Worstershire and onion to the ground turkey to make it a little more interesting. I will be making this again!

Yum! I made three burgers; my husband took one bite and laid claim to the extra burger. Will definately make this sauce again and again. I will however, make with grilled tenderized pork tenderloin cutlets. Do add the onion, tomato and arrugula.

The tartar sauce, I discovered, is pretty versatile. Not only did we use it on the burgers but the following night on baked potatoes and the next in egg salad.

The sauce really makes the burgers. I made turkey burgers, but the sauce would be great with any type of ground meat. It's was a little hot for me, so I added more mayo to tone it down a bit.

My husband and I love this recipe for a quick week-night meal. Add a salad and some roasted potatoes and you are all set! Yum!

I didn't make the burgers, just the sauce for my Omaha Steak Burgers. The sauce is delicious with a nice kick to it. It turned an already great burger into a gourmet burger! Thank you!

This dish was excellent!! My family ranted and raved over the sauce. I did substitute with the cilantro. Delicious!! I added minced shallots, chopped onions, a little plain yogurt and fresh breadcrumbs to the ground turkey. (I got the idea from two other turkey burger recipes from this site) My husband, kids and parents no longer want hambugers. Turkey all the way!!!!! Can be grilled or pan-fried too! - A definite keeper.

Great sauce! Turns a boiled egg into gourmet!

Yummy, yummy! Love this recipe because I can still make plain burgers for the kids but add the sauce & condiments to ours for a great alternative to bbq blahness...will try the sauce next with crabcakes or roast beef...delish!

Make these all the time because they are so great!!!!The sauce is probably what makes them. I always use low-fat mayo. Use 93% lean turkey,as they have to have some fat, or they will be too dry. YUMMIE! Someone needs to thank Hal's for sharing this recipe!

I thought the dressing was excellant! I even used non-fat mayo and just diced green chili. Cilantro is also the call. I used lean (not extra lean) ground meat and the burgers turned out moist and delicious. Next time, I may try to add some spice to the meat but really, with the sauce, it doesn't need anything.

I can't get enough of that tartar sauce! My family wants me to make it again and again. Much prefer cilantro over the dill. Tried the extra lean turkey with less than desireable results (the burgers were "squeaky").

Loved the recipe. Adding 1 or 2 finely chopped shallots to the turkey meat made it even better!

I paired the sauce w/the "Barbecue Turkey Burgers with Creamy Cole Slaw Holden" recipe also on this site. The sauce was delish & I used fat-free mayo so there was no guilt. Careful with the chilis because they are HOT. The burgers sounded rather plain on this recipe -- I may try them this way the next time.

We loved this sauce! The 2nd time I made it we didn't have dill, so I substituted cilantro and it was even better!

Excellent sauce! And so easy to whip up. We really liked these, and it couldn't be easier, especially since you don't have to add anything to the turkey except salt and pepper! I didn't have arugula, so I used regular lettuce. I also couldn't find the chipotles in adobo sauce, so I substituted with 1 tbsn. of Mark's Red Chile Sauce from Coyote Cucina. It worked out really well, and I plan on making this again and again this summer!

Omigod!!! This is REALLY good! All the flavors come together beautifully -- and that sauce! Think I'll try it on crabcakes next:>)...

This was a fabulous recipe! The chipotles make an interesting change from the usual boring tartar sauce. It would probably be great with fish, too.
