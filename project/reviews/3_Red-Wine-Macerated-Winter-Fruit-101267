Not my normal type of dessert, but surprisingly very good. I would add a bit more sugar to the wine next time, maybe doubling. I used a combo of apricots, dates, golden raisins, and cranberries and it was delicious, served with whip cream and the biscotti. Definitely best after 24 hours, also, make VERY generous servings!

Really nice. I served it to friends who lived in Italy who thought it was quite authentic! Everyone loved the fruits in winter. I also made the cashew orange biscotti which tasted great when dipped in the wine.

This is a great make-ahead dessert. Instead of creme fraiche, I mixed equal parts plain yogurt and lemon yogurt. Ice-cream is also a good accompaniment.
