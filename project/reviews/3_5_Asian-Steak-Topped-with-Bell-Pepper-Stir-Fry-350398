Really loved the marinade and will definitely make again. Wasn't that crazy about the flavor w/the pappers and onions though--taste was a bit off. In the future I will only use the marinade for steaks, not vegetables.

Great recipe. I had defrosted NY steaks I needed to do something with and this fit the bill. Very quick and tasty. The cooking instructions were excellent. I think it helps that the steaks are room-temperature by the time you put them in the pan. I had onions (no peppers) but I put steak and onions over a salad of arugula and baby greens. No other dressing, just the meat and the onions. It was very good.

The marinade for the recipe was really great, a wonderful combination of salty, spicy, and sweet. I didn't use New York steaks but used one I had on hand so I don't know if the cooking times are accurate or not. Other then that I followed the recipe except I omitted the cilantro because it's not my favorite. I served it with plain rice and stir-fried green beans with sesame seeds. Over all, it was quite delicious!

This is pretty tasty and I look forward to making it again. Next time I may add a little pineapple juice and lime juice to the mariande and seve it with grilled pineapple salsa rather than the stir fry in the recipe. Should make the beef a little sweeter to balance the hot from the Vietnamese Chili Garlic sauce I prefer to use.

This is a great Thai recipe. The soy sauce, Thai chili sauce and balsamic vinegar combination is such a nice mixture I not only used it for the steak, but chicken and tofu in separate dishes. Very versatile!!

Good stuff. Nice way to give beef a savory zing. 3.3 Forks

A lot of flavor for something so quick and easy! We marinated steaks about 30 min, made a little more marinade than called for (not much to scrape off) and everyone raved. This looked and tasted like it took a lot longer to prepare than it really did.

Easy - absolutely delecious. I followed the recipe exactly using sirloin rather than New York.
