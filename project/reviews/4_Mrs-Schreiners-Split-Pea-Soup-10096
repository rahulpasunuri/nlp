This was so simple, yet somehow so excellent -- think bacon (and cooking veg in rendered bacon fat) is the secret here. As with many reviewers, I added a couple cloves of garlic and 2 celery ribs and used a coarse lemon salt -- delicious! I also omitted the ham (didn't have any), but it wasn't missed. I liked this so much am planning on making again this weekend -- perfect for cold weather!

Great recipe. I also added chopped garlic to bacon grease and let simmer just until soft, not brown. I made garlic butter croutons to use once soup was in the bowls. They were a hit.

This is a great, basic recipe. In the spirit of Mark Bittman, I would always rather improve than embellish. I have made this soup twice, both times with a pork stock made the day before. You can use either smoked ham hocks or smoked pork neck bones. Throw them into a stock pot with cut up onions, carrots, celery, a generous tablespoon of tomato paste, and two bay leaves. Add water sufficient to cover and bring to a boil. Hold at a mere simmer for 3 to 4 hours. Any meat reclaimed from the bones may be sapped of flavor. Taste it, and discard if it if necessary. Strain the stock, chill, and de-fat. This yields a beautiful, smoky, gelatinous stock. Use it in the recipe and add water as needed. This pork stock adds the gentle smokiness and the umami arguably so necessary for a truly delicious split pea soup. That and the divine mouth feel of glorious collagen make it quite worth the extra effort.

Nice basic soup recipe. Using smoked (applewood) bacon is a must. Also dressed it up with: 1tsp salt, 2tsps lemon pepper, 1tsp white pepper, 1/2 tsp cumin, 1tsp Hungarian paprika, 2 tsps chopped garlic, 1tsp finely chopped rosemary. Used chopped ham instead of ham hock. Used chicken and beef broth instead of water. Next time I will add a can of stewed chopped tomatoes as well. Cooked in crock pot for 6-8 hours on low and tasted good, but needs more like 10 or more hours in the pot for raw split peas to cook fully.

DEE-licious! Added some cubed parsnip and bit of garlic, might try replacing some of the water with stock next time. Thick and wonderful! Great meal for a cold days.

My whole family loves this soup and gets a ham just so I can make it! I use it as a left over recipe, so instead of the ham hock I use whatever is left over from the ham and the bone, I also add chicken broth, a little apple cider vinegar and some dark brown sugar. Yummy!!

Our mom passed away a few years ago and she used to make my brother pea soup for his birthday. I decided I'd take a stab at it and used this recipe since I have no idea how she did it. Now I'm not usually partial to this particular soup but of course tried some before giving - YUMMY! And my brother actually called me later to say he was getting ready to have a second bowl and it almost gave mom a run for her money. I didn't crumble the bacon in later since there was plenty of meat with the ham but agree with other reviewers that bacon fat is definitely a secret ingredient here. Also took another person's suggestion of using a dash of cayenne pepper and chili powder. If you know anyone that claims not to like pea soup, this recipe will make them change their tune!

Served this soup tonight for the 20th time. I have not seen any split pea recipe come even close! Now I have adapted it to my slow cooker and I like it even more. A little inattention and it can scorch doing it in the kettle. But, now I can fry the bacon, saute the veggies and then put it all in my slow cooker on low the night before. With no more attention, it is ready to serve the following day and no chance for it to scorch. Sooo Good!

I had to try this recipe with yellow split peas because the grocery store was out of the green ones, which I didn't think would change anything except the color... and it didn't. The soup turned out wonderfully... I was a little worried that there was too much water in the recipe to actually get the soup thick. But I let it simmer uncovered to its full time and it turned out thick enough. I don't think I actually "simmered" it the entire time, so next time I would make sure it's simmering the whole time to see if it gets a little thicker. The only thing I might change next time is to use chicken or vegetable broth instead of water to see if it adds just a little richer flavor. Other than that, this recipe works fabulously as is, and is extremely tasty with the bacon on top!

Rating: 4
This is very tasty and came together in a jiffy! I'm going to make it for a crowd again this weekend, but without the bacon, so I hope it's still as good.

Rating: 3
I made this with a spiral ham bone and it made it too sweet and gave the whole soup a strange flavor. The consistency, however, was perfect for me by stirring every 20 min. or so to break up the peas as they softened. I didn't blend or process. I will have to make this again with a smoked ham bone. The rest of the flavors (veggies, bacon) were comforting.

Rating: 4
Really loved the basic recipe and very easy.. have made several times and have modified it by substituting chicken stock for 1/2 the water, NOT removing the bacon(or grease) and also browning the ham hock with veggies. Added a celery root for flavor and is also a great thickener. Added Fresh rosemary, cayenne and dill- YUM!

Rating: 3
Easy and delicious! I'm eating it right now. Only change I made was to make half the liquid chicken broth. I agree with other reviewers that it calls for too much liquid. If you want it thicker, then use less water. It's easier to add liquid than to take away. Get the best quality bacon you can for this, it makes a difference!

Rating: 2
I definitely didn't have a problem with it being too thick -- next time I'd not only add less water (maybe start with 1.5 quarts) but I'd also add a whole additional pound of split peas. Beyond being too thin, the flavor was good. I love the smoked ham hock.

Rating: 4
Really good, really simple soup. Instead of bacon I added about 2 cups of diced ham (but I still did cook the veggies in bacon fat). I also needed to add an extra 2-3 cups of water. As suggested by other reviewers I used about 1/2 chicken broth instead of water as well. YUMMY.

My hubby is a split pea and ham guy. So I saved our hambone from our Christmas Ham and decided to make this soup with it. I followed the suggestions to use 1/2 chix broth with water, and that worked well. I didn't feel the need to add any cream/milk at all. I was surprised that the split peas kind of "melt" down by themselves (with most bean soups I have to use my hand blender to give it a velvety texture) The only thing I changed other than that was a little oregano a tiny bit of garlic salt and a sprinkling of cayenne. I did double up the recipe as that was the size of the bag of beans I purchased, so I have already frozen half for a future cold winter's night meal. I purchased a very cheap brand of split peas and they even said on the bag that split peas require no "pre soaking". P.S. Our pug also rates it 4 stars as he got to chew (Supervised) on the hambone today!

Rating: 4
This soup was simple and divine! I followed others' suggestions to use 1/2 chix stock and 1/2 water, and it definitely turned out great. Did just a touch of heavy cream right at the end, which ironically lightened the hefty taste of the soup. Fabulous! I doubled the bacon to 1/2# and used all of the rendered fat because we just adore bacon as if it's a family member. Oh, and I also waited to salt the soup until the very end, as the combo of a smoked ham hock and bacon added good saltiness already. Definitely a keeper and a wonderful chilly- weather soup! Serve with crusty bread or cornbread muffins for delicious happiness through and through. (Don't know why previous cooks had trouble with split peas not cooking properly... I followed the receipe as written and they melted away as promised.)

Instead of water, I used 1 qt. of veg. stock and 1 qt. of chicken stock. 16 oz. of beef stock. I also included one head of chopped fennel. It's a great recipe. Thanks!

Rating: 4
The description is right, the bacon fat is a wonderful addition! Of course, all of our bacon got eaten before the soup was even done, so we didn't have any left to crumble over the top. When all ingredients were added, I thought that the soup was too brothy, so I put in another batch of split peas to thicken it. By the time those peas were tender, the first batch of peas had turned into mush so the soup was REALLY thick and leftovers had to have water added. If you like a thicker soup, this is a really good idea, in fact if I make it again I will probably do the same thing because it was wonderful, thick and hearty. I also added celery and a couple other miscellaneous things I can't remember off the top of my head. At any rate, the soup was wonderful I would definitely use this recipe again!!

Rating: 4
This is a fantastic recipe! I have made it as is, and it is terrific. I've also made it adding garlic, celery, dill and the juice of half a lemon. Both preparations are really good; the dill/lemon combo gives a nice fresh flavor. Definitely a keeper!

I followed the directions exactly (except for pouring off all but a couple tablespoons of bacon fat, instead of a full 1/4 cup). It was absolutely perfect after two hours of aromatic simmering. A previous reviewer who reported that her peas didn't cook through after five hours must have been using *very* old peas (or pea-green gravel, perhaps). The peas in my soup just melted into the broth.

This is a great recipe - so easy and tasty. I did as others suggested and added chicken broth (one 14 oz can) and used leftover ham on the bone from our Christmas dinner. Cooked it for exactly two hours and the peas were perfectly soft. I wish my husband ate pork, then it'd become a regularly-made dish in our household. Maybe I'll try it with the turkey leg per another's suggestion.

Soooooo good (and so easy, too)!! I had baby carrots so just eyeballed it, threw in some celery, 4 cloves of garlic, and a few small potatoes.

This was very easy to make but I found it was only so/so. A bit bland/boring even with more salt and use of chicken broth. I would pre-soak the split peas as I found them still hard. I tried to blend part of the soup as somebody else had, but didn't find that helped.

This is delish. I have been making this recipe since it was first published in Gourmet magazine in the 90's. It is tried and true. I deviate a little by using 2 cups of chicken broth instead of water. And in the end if the peas are not disolved enough I use a hand blender to blend the soup for a just a few seconds. I do like a bit of the rough texture as well. Lastly, I always garnish with the bacon and a good sprinkling of fresh grated parmsean. The perfect winter time soup we do enjoy. Oh and any leftovers freeze wonderfully.

This is a great split pea soup recipe. I did as many have suggested and instead of using all water, added 1/2 the liquid as chicken broth. The only other change I made was blending it with a hand blender at the end. It was smoky without being overly salty--I'll definitely make this again!

A classic, wonderful, old-time soup. It warms the soul. And the perfect base for a world of inspiration. I made it with ham from Easter (because that is what I had on hand). I am hopeful Mrs. Schreiner would approve of making due with your resources. Here's to the classics! And here's to those who make them their own...I added a splash of Sherry right before serving with tons of those crispy, bacon bits on top. Oh! Yum.

My guests just left giving this one rave reviews. I read through the comments and adapted the recipe as follows - I used water rather than stock (as some suggested), but gave it more impact by using a smoked ham hock and a leftover ham bone. Used one whole onion, the carrots, 2 stalks celery diced and 3 large garlic cloves, minced. Also added salt and the bay leaf and 1 teaspoon each dried thyme and marjoram. Used entire amount of water, and simmered slowly for the 2 hour time frame (peas just melted into soup). Cooled to room temperature, refrigerated overnight. Soup thickened considerably. Then warmed gently, removed hock and ham bone, added meat from bone. Added one cup heavy cream and warmed. Delicious with garlic asiago foccacia from my favorite bakery. This one is a definite keeper.

Not for nothing, but this is only a recipe for green split-pea soup [this time with ham], right? So you put dried green split-peas in water, simmer them until tender, puree if you wish, serve and eat. Or am I wrong? What you put in with the peas [ham hocks, ham bone--if you are from NY, do you remember Sonny Becker's 1960's afternoon TV show character Hambone on ch. 5?--smoked kielbasa, and whatever herbs and spices] is up to you. Poor Mrs. Schreiner isn't here to defend her 'work of art'. Almost nobody respected the art. What you poster-types have done is only what a person does with a handful of dried green split-peas and water, simmer them, and savor them. That's called cookin'. You've pleased your palate, justly. So, why even attempt to fork Mrs. Schreiner, or her recipe?

Agree with the other posters about this being a very good recipe as is...but I took the advice of others and added garlic and marjoram, thyme and a potato and it turned out fabulous. I also used chicken stock instead of water. Next time I will use 1/2 of each. It was almost too salty using all chicken stock. I am probably one of the only people I know that will make hot soup in August but it just sounded so good. This is definitely going to be a recipe that I use often.

I was longing for my father's Split-Pea Soup. After Easter was over and we had our fill of ham & eggs,I did what my father used to do. I made split-pea soup. Since my dad was away, I decided to utilize this wonderful site and immediately cameupon several recipes. This one in particular stood out right away. The other reviews eluded to an old-fashioned recipe that wasn't complicated and seemed to satisfy everyone who tried it. I altered a few things like adding rosemary, garlic, white wine vinegar while the onions and carrots simmered and the left-over portions of a Honey-baked ham & bone. After simmering for an hour I tasted it and still felt something was missing..si I added some (a few dashes) of some curry I recently brought back with me from Barbados. The result: FABULOUS! Thank you form helping me to define my own recipe. My family was very impressed. I served it with fresh Portuguese bread & butter. We all fell asleep afterward.:)

Second time I've used this recipe and really enjoy it alot. Second time I used a fresh ham bone AND a ham hock I had on hand. Gave it a very salty, hammy taste that I liked. Note on the ham hock, I would suggest making a slit through the skin to allow for expansion during cooking and to allow the juices and fat to cook off. First time, I cooked the soup for the full two hours plus to get it just right. Second time, I cooked this at a moderate simmer for an hour and it was def. ready, so I'm wondering if the moisture content of the peas had something to do with it. Also used half chicken broth/half water for a richer taste. A definite keeper!

I have never eaten or cooked split-pea soup before this recipe came to my attention. I am in love with it. I had to add water midway through cooking, as it dried up from simmering too long. Added a little garlic, but otherwise stuck to the recipe. Wonderful and easy. I made it a day ahead, chilled in the refrigerator overnight, then added some water and reheated on the stove the next day. MEAL TIP - Serve with some warm and crusty French bread. Excellent!

This is the perfect winter soup. I add garlic (per the other suggestions) and salt and pepper to taste. I usually make this with a meaty ham bone, trimming off the fat to keep the soup from getting greasy. Last time I had to make do with a smoked ham hock, and the soup tasted thinner than usual. I love this soup and I don't eat a lot of ham. Is it strange if I ask my future mother-in-law to send me her ham bones?

I added some marjoram and pureed the soup with a stick blender at the end and everyone really seemed to enjoy it.
