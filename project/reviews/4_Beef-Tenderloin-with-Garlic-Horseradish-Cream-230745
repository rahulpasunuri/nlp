Awesome recipe. I've made it twice now & to fab reviews. The tenderloin recipe is really good and easy, but the sauce is what makes it (and can be served with a tenderloin prepared another way)! A perfect dish for a dinner party as prep can be done early in the day as well.

Made this for New Year's Eve. Was a big hit and quite easy. However, if I was to make it again, I would definitely double the horseradish added to the cream. I did not feel that the horseradish taste was strong enough for my liking.

I made this last night for a New Years Eve dinner party, and it was a smashing success. I had a really large tenderloin weighing over 7 pounds, so wasn't sure how long it would take to cook. I cut back a little on the pepper for the rub, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. After bringing the beef to room temperature, it took approximately 45 minutes in the oven to reach 125 degrees which gave me medium on the ends and medium rare in the middle. The sauce cooked down in about 25 minutes in a saucepan over medium low heat. I made that the day before and brought it to room temperature prior to serving -- I didn't try and rewarm it, and it was great. Rave reviews on both the meat and the sauce. A definite keeper! One thing to note -- be sure your oven is clean prior to cooking at this high a temperature. I learned that the hard way a few years ago!

Made this last night for Christmas dinner, and my family raved! It was the first time I prepared this recipe (a little risky for a special dinner), yet it seemed fool proof ... and it was! This recipe is the type you'll use again and again. The roast and sauce are amazing following the recipe. My family likes pepper so the quantity of pepper was not a concern, but they like (not love) horseradish and each of them said the horseradish flavor in the sauce was both mild and delicious. I roasted two garlic bulbs instead of one, and each of them loved the garlic flavor. I added 15 minutes to the end of the roasting period, and I achieved rare, medium rare results with the end tips/slices being almost well done (my family likes a variety). I served with small red potatoes and green beans just like the photo and it was an easy and delicious combination. My husband asked that I keep this recipe to make again in the future. What a success!

Made this last night for Christmas Eve. Halved the pepper per everyone's instructions and gave myself an hour to make the sauce. Also gave it a bit more time in the oven - 15 minutes at 475 and another 20 at 425. This got me a medium rare tenderloin. It was a huge, huge hit - sadly no leftovers for sandwiches today!

Made for a dinner party for 6 adults, and it was exceptional. Made rub as directed. We were worried about overcooking so took out a bit earlier and it was a bit too rare - so I think recipe as written would be perfect. Some guests felt the pepper crust was a bit too much - I personally loved it. The horseradish cream (or "horseradish butter" as we called it) was delicious and a great accompaniment - it did take closer to an hour to reduce and I personally found it a bit too thick. But the taste was wonderful. Very "fancy" and easy to make. Served with carmelized shallot mashed potatoes, roasted carrots and roasted broccoli with asiago cheese...with White Chocolate Bread Pudding for dessert. great combination.

This is an excellent recipe. I made this for a dinner party for 6 people. I got a tenderloin that was a little under 3 lbs and it was the perfect amount. A notes about cooking times: The cream took much longer to reduce than 20 minutes. Mine took probably took 40. I used 1/4 cup of pepper on the beef rub instead of 1/2 and it was plenty. My tenderloin took much longer to cook than what the recipe stated - it took about 45 minutes to get it to 130 degrees, which was a perfect medium rare. My oven is high end and brand new, so I don't think it was a calibration issue. Also, if you make the cream sauce earlier in the day at have it in the fridge, know that it will get quite firm. It's best at room temperature, so make sure to take it out of the fridge a good half hour or more before you serve it.

Made this for a dinner party and everyone flipped! Don't substitute sour cream for the horseradish sauce, it's worth the effort to make this recipe as stated. I did however, reduce the amount of cracked pepper by half and it was still very peppery!

So easy and so delicous. Very impressive meal to cook. I followed recipe exactly except used fake beef boullion instead of real (I could not find real boullion that didn't have any msg in it so used fake). I have served it at dinner parties and always rave reviews. This is a MUST just as is.

Rating: 2
Tenderloin does not disappoint and while this was good, I can't say it was one of the best on the site. Thankfully based on other reviewers I used 1/2 the pepper and used a skillet to reduce the cream. This recipe would probably work well when serving on a buffet but for all the time and effort, I'll make gravy for our next seated dinner.

This is an exceptional recipe. I made this for a dinner party and the guests went wild! My recommendation is to take this out of the oven when the temperature reaches 125 if you like your meat medium rare as it keeps cooking as it rests. Don't worry about the pepper..it works out great!

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner and it was certainly a hit! I wish I had roasted more garlic for an appetizer to be spread on bread. Beef and sauce were fabulous, although I did not use 1/2 cup of pepper on meat...seemed too much...but was delicious and may make again for new year's eve!

I have made this dish twice and both times there was nothing left! This will always be a favorite! I prepared the sauce and the rub the night before so all I had to do was put the rub on the meat and pop it in the oven. I served this with mashed potatoes and steamed vegies. Perfect!!

I was hesitant to put the effort into making the sauce, but it is worth it and not difficult at all. I served this for a small dinner party and it was a huge success.

Made this last night for a group of 7. I used a 5-pound tenderloin, but didn't change any of the other measurements and everything was delicious. Only catch, as some others have commented, is that there is no way that 2 cups of cream simmering for 20-25 minutes will reduce to 3/4 of a cup. It took a solid hour. Maybe if I let it boil instead of simmer, it would have gone quicker, but I didn't want it to burn. Also, I think next time I'll cook it to an internal temperature of 125 degrees rather than 130--it was closer to medium than I was hoping. Regardless, everything tasted great.

This is truly delicious! I cooked this tenderloin for my daughter and family, including teenage grands, for Thanksgiving; everyone was ready for more the following day. As recommended in other reviews, I cut the pepper to 1/4 cup, used sour cream instead of the reduced cream recommended, and also used the rub, which is delicious, for six pounds of tenderloin. It could not have been much better. I have no idea where Buffalo Gap, Texas, is, but my thanks to the restaurant providing this recipe!

This beef is delicious, and the sauce is a perfect compliment. I served this for a party and got rave reviews but no leftovers! Decided to make this after reading the other reviews. Other reviewers had said the rub was too peppery - I made this per directions and had enough rub to cover a 7 pound tenderloin, and the spice was perfect. Cut it in half if using a 3-4 pound roast. The sauce IS labor-intensive, but using a small non-stick skillet helped the cream reduce in about 20 minutes. Great for a party - made the sauce the night before and left it at room temperature for about an hour before serving. Covered the beef with the rub the morning of the party and let it marinate in the fridge. Easy and just delicious!!!

I used the sauce with some Costco 2" thick beef tenderloins for a dinner for eight. I reduced the cream by half (which will not happen in a saucepan by simmering for 20-25 minutes, plan on a higher heat and a lot of stirring). Although I found the sauce easy to make and my guests devoured it, the sauce lacked a specific taste. Either it needed a more pungent horseradish or two heads of roasted garlic. Otherwise one cup of the reduced cram was plenty.

I am a part-time caterer and just made this for 30 people last weekend. It was a HUGE hit. The beef was delicious (although I would go a little lighter on the rub next time), and the sauce was incredible. The roast garlic had a really nice sweetness to it. I suggest adding a bit of salt to the sauce (after it's cooled and the flavors have had a chance to settle), it really helped to brighten the garlic and horseradish.

this rub is fantastic! I used a little less pepper than what was called for (because that's all I had) and it was perfect. the sauce DOES take a long time to reduce, but I was prepping a salad at the same time, so I didn't really notice at the time. I thought the effort was worth it, but I did have a lot left over.

Made this for NY Eve, and it was a smash hit with everyone. Good thing I read the reviews, and cut back on the pepper. Even after doubling the size of the beef, I didn't use up all of the spice rub from a single recipe. The cream sauce is fantastic, although time consuming. I added more roasted garlic and less horseradish. I made it the day before, and used the microwave on low power to soften it before serving. It separated, but a good whisking brought it back together.

I have made this recipe twice for Christmas dinner and it gets uniformly rave reviews. I agree that the sauce is too involved and not worth the effort, so I followed the other reviewer's suggestion and just used sour cream, fresh minced garlic, and liberal amounts of horseradish, salt, and pepper. Definitely the best steak recipe I've ever made (and I come from a family of big meat eaters).

Great cooking method - tenderloin turned out beautifully. Horseradish cream good, but not worth the effort. It had kind of a strange grainy/buttery texture. I would have preferred just a whipped cream with horseradish added. Made great sandwiches with the meat.

I made this for a dinner with friends last night, wonderful! It does take a long time for the cream to reduce, but it is so worth it.

This went down very well with my husband's cigar smoking buddies. I did not have trouble with the sauce. My read on this recipe is that the sauce is meant to be served chilled. At any rate it was very good that way. You don't have to cook it for ages as it thickens while being chilled.

Rating: 4
After reading the reviews, I used only 1 c whipping cream. But after a little whisking, it reduced and thickened so I added the rest. The secret is to whisk the cream over low heat. I used fresh horseradish, grated. I roasted the garlic on the grill (I have a gas hookup so don't need to worry about using all the propane). I also cooked the meat on the grill and served it with asparagus and multicolored sauteed potatoes, all prepared on the grill. This one is a keeper.

I have reviewed this recipe previously. Once again, it is simply delicious! I must comment on the sauce, however. It takes forever for the cream mixture to reduce down to 3/4 cup. I eventually gave up at 1 1/4 cups and refrigerated over night. It was just fine and thickened to a proper consistency. The cooking time for the meat was "spot on" for medium-rare. A must have recipe for every cooks recipe box!!!

First time I made tenderloin, and it turned out great. I only put 1/s tsp of pepper, and it was plenty. I would also cut out the granulated beef bouillon, because it's borderline over salted with it, andt the sauce went perfect with it. Would reccomend with tweaks.

I wish I would have read the reviews the first time I made this recipe. I love pepper....but we had to scrape most of it off before we could eat. It was terrible. The sauce was great, I agree with the other comments about how long it took, etc. This time I added a little sour cream to cool it down just a bit and it added some richness as well. The basics are there however for a delicious meal.

Rating: 0
There was way too much pepper and I didn't even use the full amount. Next time I'll use about 1/3 of what the recipe calls for. The cream took more like an hour to reduce so this recipe is time consuming. Overall, after scraping the pepper off as much as possible, the meat and sauce was delicious. But then it is pretty hard not to love Tenderloin.

I loved this! I did reduce the peppercorns by half as recommended, and it was perfect. The combination of the peppercorn crust with the creamy, rich sauce was incredible.

Worked forever to create this sauce. Took an hour to reduce the cream and then time to roast and squeeze the garlic. Chilled as directed and then tried to warm it to room temp on a warmer. The whole sauce separated. Ended up in the trash. Roast is reasonable - crust is nice enough but clearly there is a mistake in the instructions for the sauce. Horrible.

Made this exactly as the recipe states. Delicious, but next time I will add more garlic and horseradish to the sauce as it was a little too mild for my taste. I'll also cut back on the pepper -- it makes way too much spice rub. Also, I chilled the sauce and then microwaved it before serving it, but the components separated and it looked pretty dismal. Anyone know how to reheat it so it doesn't do this? Next time I will probably just take it out of the fridge early and let it come to room temp.

This was great for Christmas Eve. Used a 5 lb. roast with no changes in the other quantities. It was VERY peppery still, but really good.

Thanks to all of you who set my expectation about the time to takes to make the sauce! After an hour, it only reduced 1/4 cup!

I made this for Christmas dinner and the beef was a hit!! I give the tenderloin 4 forks BUT don't waste your time (and it takes a lot of it) on the horseradish sauce. I made it exactly as instructed but we had to use a lot more horseradish to get any flavor at all. No garlic flavor either since roasted garlic is so mild. Also the texture was bad, just heavy. I threw it out, whipped some cream and added horseradish and a touch of dijon mustard to that. MUCH better.

Have to agree with the reviews here: outstanding recipe. Not a lot of labor for a superb dish. Also agree that less than half of the pepper is plenty.

This is delicious - my husband who is very picky about his beef loved this. I completed the prep for the sauce and the beef in the first 45m that the garlic was roasting, then only had a short amt of work when the garlic came out - pop beef in oven & finish sauce. I kept it at room temperature, & the sauce is dreamy on baked potatoes. I may add some scallions to the sauce next time. For the cracked pepper, i mashed whole peppercorns with mortar & pestle - the big chunks of pepper were very tasty. We had a little bit of leftovers as the only tenderloin I could find was pretty large, and it re-heats beautifully.

I did the spice rub the day before, wrapped the beef in saran and refrigerated. Flavor permeated entire piece. Can't wait to do it again!

Loved IT!!! I had a dinner party for 8 and everyone raved about it. Cracking the pepper was very easy. I just put peppercorns in a small zip lock freezer baggie (close the bag but leave a small opening for air to escape)and I pounded it with a small hammer. It worked well and within one minute I had cracked pepper with little effort. The sauce was made the day before and it did thicken in the fridge. Great Recipe.

The sauce is incredibly rich and just great with the lean tenderloin. My husband put this on everything on his plate! The simmering took longer for me to get the right consistency -- closer to 30 minutes. Yes, and like everyone says, use 1/3 the pepper suggested, you don't need it. The internal temperature of 130 gave me a raw center of the roast -- I cooked at least 10 minutes longer for medium rate.

Extraordinary recipe. Very simple to make. Had a 3lb 14oz tenderloin and it took about 45 minutes to cook to medium/medium rare. Cracking the pepper was a challenge without a mortar & pestule, but the food processor worked in a pinch! Cream sauce is awfully rich, too.

What a mouthwatering meal.Yes reduce the pepper and be prepared to spend about 15.99 per lb for the meat,but well worth it. Very easy to make, but it's best to use a oven probe when cooking if you can, you don't want to over cook this expensive piece of meat.

This beef tenderloin recipe is wonderful! I've prepared this twice, and both times to rave reviews. Based on other reviews, I used about 1/4 cup of cracked pepper, and it was the right amount. Also, about the sauce... The first time I prepared it, it took about an hour of whisking the cream to get it to reduce, and that was over medium heat so it wouldn't burn on the bottom of the pot. The second time, I used a non-stick skillet, over medium-high heat, and whisked away for only 20 minutes. Once the sauce started to thicken, I reduced the heat to medium to finish it off. The sauce was perfect.

After reading the reviews before I made this dish I had decided to to use only 1/4 c of pepper for a 4 lb roast and I saw my family scapping off the pepper because it was still too much.

I agree with the comment that it took longer to reduce the cream, but I may have simmered it on too low of a heat setting, as I was afraid of scalding it. My dinner guests were really impressed with the beef and sauce, and the beef was incredibly tender. Personally, ny husband and I agreed that next time, I will try reducing the amount of pepper on the meat, but increasing the amount of horseradish in the sauce. If you are serving this to a person that salts and peppers something before tasting it, I'd suggest warning them not to pepper it until after their first bite! :)

Very good! Substituted sour cream for the cream, in the sauce and had a very thick choice rib steak around which I used with great success. Took a little longer to cook, but was wonderful.

It took a little longer to reduce the cream than the recipe indicates, but overall this was a hit! We even made it with a turkey tenderloin and it was WONDERFUL!

Just about as good as beef gets! I added thick slices of onion to the top of the roast while it baked. Nice and caramel'y brown ! Easy and impressive.

Yes, this is quite good and easy to make. The cream sauce cuts the spiciness of the pepper rub. It's a very good combination and delicious served with roasted potatoes.
