I used Mountain Violet sticky rice, which may be why mine came out so gummy. I thought it looked interesting and exotic in the picture, but when mine was done my husband looked at it and, with nose wrinkled, asked "What IS that?" It was pretty sweet and the taste was pretty good, but the texture was just not very appealing. I might try making it again as I love rice pudding, but next time I'll probably try it with a longer gain, less starchy rice.

Love love this recipe!! Rich, creamy and not too sweet--but sweet enough to satisfy. Used forbidden rice and 1 cinnamon stick during initial rice/water cooking then removed.

Searched the web for a black rice pudding recipe and found this one. All of the other recipes call for Thai sticky black rice, which should be soaked overnight before cooking which I'll do for this recipe. This one sounds good and I'm going to try it.

This recipe is just what I was looking for. I read that black rice is very healthful and wanted to make a dessert that I could also eat for breakfast. I soaked the rice for about 20 minutes as another reviewer suggested before putting it in my small rice cooker. When the rice was tender but still wet, I added the coconut milk and some palm sugar balls, then simmered in the rice cooker for about 10 more minutes (need to push "cook" again). It was perfect! Creamy but with a nice bite. Would be delicious with some mango or fresh diced pineapple. Also, very easy to make in the rice cooker.

Used Black Japonica rice, rinsed and soaked briefly (20 min) in cold water. Drained, and then followed the directions. Added a cinnamon stick and three cardamom pods when boiled it in water. Added fresh cinnamon/cardamom when cooked in coconut milk. Used dark brown sugar, omitted salt since I will feed it to an infant. However, I sprinkled salt into my bowl and it really made a nice contrast to the sweet, warm, creamy, pudding. Was not soupy at all. A nutty, chewy, subtly sweet, delicious dish for a cold winter's night. Should make a yummy breakfast, too. Definitely will enter the rotation for this winter.

I recently made this recipe, and it turned out perfectly! My whole family, including husband and 2 teenagers, thought it was really good. I followed the recipe to a "T", using Forbidden Rice. I had read the reviews and was concerned about it thickening enough so I think I may have cooked it just a little bit longer than the recipe called for. That was the only change I made and it was perfect. I will definitely make it again, and am looking forward to serving it to guests...it would definitely impress. And, the drizzle of cold coconut milk for serving is genius! I highly recommend this recipe!

I first tasted Black Rice Pudding in Bali, Indonesia. This recipe is almost as exotic as what I experienced there. When I make it again, I plan on using a little less sugar just to "healthy" it up slightly and make it not quite so rich. The black rice worked very well in a rice cooker.

i liked this recipe a lot, but i made a number of adjustments. i used short-grain brown rice instead of black rice, and reduced the water to 2 cups and the cooking time to 35 min. i also used lite coconut milk and palm sugar instead of white sugar, which gave it a nice caramel-like flavor. everything else was the same. i think the recipe calls for a bit too much salt, i could taste the salt more than i wanted when the pudding was done.

Different but good. Served with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream. Everyone, including my 4 year old son, enjoyed it.

This is an excellent recipe and an excellent dish--I love the thick texture, the sweet coconut taste and the chewiness of the rice. I could have eaten the whole pot myself! I followed the recipe exactly and had perfect results.

This is the best rice pudding! Cooking time is long but worth the wait and everyone whom has tried has loved it. I have reduced the amount of water added from start by half cup, otherwise it is quite runny. I always add a good amount of cinnamon too. This pudding must be eaten warm and is great when first made alone or over ice cream, next day with plain milk on top after reheated. We have enjoyed this for breakfast and desert (even bedtime snack) The color is amazing and the taste even better!!!

Great recipe, very yummy. My family is normally afraid of anything "exotic" that is home made; but they loved this. I may add a little cinnamon and/or vanilla next time. Definitely use water to cook the rice first. Some other rice pudding recipes have a lower cook time but this one definitely does not. If you start off with just the coconut milk you're going to have to add water later anyways, is it evaporates. Put the left over coconut milk in the fridge before pouring over the pudding. VERY YUMMY!!

The recipe is very good. I have ordered black rice pudding in a local Vietnamese restaurant and this was as enjoyable if not more. I did everything as written EXCEPT I did cover the rice in the coconut milk phase just to get it to soften and swell more. I did check it a few times to be sure it was not sticking and I stirred it a bunch. The liquid thickened without any added ingredients. The presentation is so beautiful with the contrast of the coconut milk on the black rice. This a great party dessert for sure.

I made this recipe and i liked it alot and it was really easy to make. The only thing is i used different rice because i didnt know where to find black rice, but once i figure out where to find some ill try and make it again. The only thing i didnt care for about this recipe is that it makes you really thirsty.

this tasty dish is SO easy to make if you do it right. i have a lot of experience making jook (chinese rice porridge) and haupia (hawaiian coconut pudding) so those skills helped me here. the black japonica rice is fine, the key is to SOAK IT FIRST...drain the water from the rice before adding it to the 3 fresh cups water. the most important step is after you bring it to a boil with the coconut milk. you must stir, stir, stir...when you are almost done with that step (about to turn off the heat), add a little bit, like 1 tsp, of cornstarch DISSOLVED IN WATER to the pudding. this will help the texture considerably. good luck and hope you will enjoy this pudding!!

I made this recipe using forbidden black rice, and it had a great consistency. This recipe was absolutely delicious and extremely easy. Both my mother and I have made it several times, always to rave reviews!

The flavors of this dish were nice, but the texture was all wrong. It was less rice pudding than rice soup. It never really thickened, even the next day after being in the refrigerator, and I followed the recipe exactly. Maybe my rice was wrong? (Trader Joe's Black Japonica).

this is quite delicious, actually! i have made it twice now, and it has been enjoyed by all. it has a perfect pudding consistency if made with the correct amount of liquid. the perfect accompaniment to an asian dinner.

More a note than rating. If this is supposed to be our famous pulut hitam aka black glutinous rice, it is more a dessert than breakfast dish. Pulut hitam is actually a Peranakan dish, which is indigenous to Malaysia and Singapore. Us Peranakans can have it for breakfast, dessert or supper. The reason why the consistency would be wrong is because you are using the wrong rice. It should be black glutinuous rice which is soaked overnight before you cook it. The rice must be cooked till it is puffy and you keep adding water and rock sugar to taste, stirring frequently so the texture and consistency is right. We also cook it with screwpine leaves and add some cornstarch solution at the end to thicken it. Remove the screwpine leaves and serve with freshly squeezed coconut milk. The thicker the coconut milk, the better.

I found black rice easily enough at a local korean market. The flavors of this pudding are remarkably subtle, sweet but not overly so. A teaspoon of coconut milk drizzled over a serving is as pleasing to the eye as it is to the tongue.

maybe this is authentic, but it is not the sticky rice i've had in thai restaurants for dessert. this version probably would be better for breakfast as it reminds me of oatmeal. i didn't care for the consistency, too runny, maybe less water in the initial cooking would help. my boyfriend liked the flavor, but agreed that it was too runny. it was a disappointing result after spending $4 on a tiny bag of forbidden rice.

Indeed a true Southeast Asian comfort food! With our abundance of fresh coconuts...I also tried using white glutenus rice in this recipe topped it with crean of corn. Eaten warm with iced lemon tea.
