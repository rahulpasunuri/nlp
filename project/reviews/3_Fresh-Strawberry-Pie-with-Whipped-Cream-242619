Run! Pick another recipe. Not even worthy of a single fork. This is strawberry jello in a pie crust.

We loved this recipe. I would multiply the crust ingredients by 1.5 next time, the crust was a bit skimpy. I made my own shortbread for the crust. I found this recipe to be a bit laborious, but completely WORTH IT!!!

As with the other comments, I found both the crust to be too thin and the filling to be too runny. (Read the directions on the Knox and it is a 1-1 ratio) So I re-made it and doubled the crust recipe and used 2 envelopes gelatin and it was perfect!! I also took the advice of previous comments and used my fridge vs an ice bath with great success. I will definitely make this over and over for guests as well as family!

This pie is delicious!! I decided to make it because it is my boyfriend's favorite pie and this recipe looked like the one his grandma used to make for him. I made a few changes, though. As a time saver, I used a Pillsbury pie crust instead of making one. I also used strawberry hello instead of unflavored because I didn't have any unflavored gelatin on hand. Since strawberry jello is sweet itself, I cut the sugar down to 2/3 of a cup instead of 3/4. My boyfriend and I loved it!! It turned out beautifully!! I wish I could post a picture of it! I absolutely recommend this recipe!

I followed other reviewers' suggestions and used more cookies, etc. for the crust and let the fruit/gelatin mixture gel for a little over 30 minutes before pouring into the pie shell. Overall, it worked out really well - everyone really scarfed it down and loved it, but I found it too sweet. I will definitely use less sugar in both filling and crust next time, despite adding more cookies, or may just make a regular tart crust.

I did not love this recipe. It was perfectly easy and fine to make, but I did not like the gelatin. It set up much to jello-like for my taste. I also thought it did need more sugar. I will go back to my regular strawberry pie recipe, thickened with cornstarch.

I liked this recipe. I made a few changes. Added more berries, and cutting them. The family I made it for needs to have the berries cut. The gelatin set up great. When making an ice bath, I add some water to the ice, it makes it colder. Sometimes I add more ice as well. I let the mixture set for about 10 minutes, then would stir. Like clockwork, 30 minutes it was a good set. I have used one time, lemon zest and another time, orange zest. I am in southern, ca., and used fresh lemons off my tree. I used more berries that I cut small to make the liquid. I tasted--it needed a little more sugar and then a little more lemon juice. I will not use this crust recipe. Not enough cookies. I mix, butter cookies, graham and shortbread cookies, sometimes add chopped toasted almonds and or pecans when mixing in my food processor. I added at least 2 more ounces of cookies. Made it the day b4. For the first hour once the pie was made, I stuck it in the freezer. Came out beautiful.

I didn't have any problems with the recipe, I just thought that it was boring. Kind of tasted like strawberries in jello.

The flavor of the filling is delicious, but my crust turned out really soggy, so I ended up throwing away 3/4 of this pie. I think my problem was that I followed the instructions about 20-30 minutes to let the gelatin filling set before pouring in the pie plate. I wish I would have read the other reviews because this was my first experience with gelatin and although after 30 minutes in the ice bath the filling didn't look ready, I made a leap of faith and poured it in anyway. I'm guessing this is what made the crust soggy. I have to say, though, that my mom's recipe for fresh berry pie, which uses cornstarch as a thickener renders a pie more to my taste. So I probably won't make this one again. (Oh, and 20 berries wasn't enough for my pan. I laid them out before hand to do a test run, so I knew how many to set aside.)

Well, we had such a different experience from some of the reviewers'! It was the best, berriest strawberry pie I've ever had. The consistency was perfect not at all in flavor or texture like Jello. It took the full 30 minutes for the gelatin to start mounding -- after 15 minutes of stirring, just let it it sit in the ice bath and stirred occassionally. These were fresh local berries ... it was just amazing.

Based on early reviews, I made extra crust (increased all ingredients by 50%), and then I had way too much for my 9 inch ceramic dish! I pressed in enough to fill the dish to the rim but probably left too much in as it took at least 30 minutes in the oven to finally set. Next time, I'll stick with the 5 oz per the recipe instead! I had no trouble with the gelatin setting. I've worked with gelatin before, and you really have to let it sit in the liquid to soften, and bring it to a simmer to dissolve. Perhaps if others didn't have luck, something went wrong in those steps? I didn't have to add too much extra water - my drained berries made nearly the 2 cups needed. I kept it in the ice bath for 40 minutes, (stirring while I played Chutes and Ladders with my daughter!) and it was noticeably thicker and ready to work with by then. Twenty berries fit perfectly in the 9 inch dish and I had exactly enough filling. My daughter loved this pie and I thought it was pretty good, light and refreshing and very fresh berry taste. I'm a bigger fan of "traditional" baked pies, but if you like this kind of refrigerator pie, this is a pretty darn good one!

This was fabulous. I've made it 4 or 5 times already. Everyone raves! Not sure why so many are having such trouble with it. The shortbread is easy: Use one sleeve of Lorna Doone shortbread cookies in a 9-in. pie plate. All other amounts are correct, including sugar, which I thought would make it too sweet. Once the strawberries drain into the measuring cup, I typically end up with one cup of liquid, to which I add one cup of water to bring total to two cups. I've not been able to get the gelatin mix to mound; however, after about 30 minutes in the ice bath, mixture becomes thicker and is beginning to gel. That's when I proceed with the recipe. No problems whatsoever. With the whole berries, if they are quite large, then 20 will fill the pie plate. Otherwise, I just place them around the edges first, then fill in the rest of the plate randomly. It's not rocket science. For the 4th of July, I added about a cup of blueberries to the strawberry- sugar-lemon juice mixture, just for fun. I do end up with more filling than I can use, so I pour the extra into a glass bowl and have a fruity Jell-o like dessert. Love this pie. May try peaches.

Not worth the hassle! I grew up in WV and have fond memories of the fresh strawberry pie served at Shoney's restaurants. This recipe seemed like it would be a close match, but I was thoroughly disappointed and would definitely not recommend it. (1) The gelatin did not "mound" in 30 minutes. It took at least 3 hours before I could move on to the next step. (2) The amount of juice the berries yielded when drained had to be "topped off" by water. Consequently, the gelatin was rather tasteless. At the very least, the recipe should recommend topping off with a fruit juice of some sort or should provide a warning that unless there is at least X-amount of berry juice, do not top off with water. (3) I wasn't crazy about the shortbread crust. We used the obvious brand alluded to by the "5oz shortbread cookie" reference, and IMHO the result was very flat. Overall, I think a traditional "short" rolled crust with 1T sugar would do more justice to a pie of this type. (4) The instructions to reserve 20 whole berries was vague. Do you arrange them around the edge of the pie plate, or place randomly in the plate so they protrude like volcanic islands rising from a sea of red? Okay, no more whining. And no reason to try to salvage this recipe. It's a loser.

This is a great recipe...for people who don't own a refrigerator! for the rest of us, I found it works just fine to put that metal bowl in the refrig to cool, then in the freezer, checking it now and then and giving it a stir...took maybe an hour to "mound" but saved 40+ minutes of stirring in an ice bath! I used a store-bought graham crust (ALDI, 75 cents) but just so you won't think I'm a complete dilettante, I did pick my own berries at a local farm! Another time saver: Used a zyliss chopper to dice berries that needed to be cut. (I do this to make jam, too). Enjoyed learning to make my own jello from scratch and will use this again, although I might cut down a bit on the lemon juice, since berries are naturally tart!

cegw - alcohol is an enemy of gelatin... which always takes forever to set up anyways! worked well and tasted great for me, I used a few different types of berries though!

I agree that the ingredient "5 oz of shortbread cookies) is a little vague. I used a 5.3 oz package of Walker's Shortbread and found that I did not have nearly enough crust for the 9 inch pie plate. The gelatin took over an hour to set for me, as well. The flavor of the pie is good, though. I appreciate that it's not too sweet (strawberry jello tastes fake, not this) and I like the lemon. I probably won't make this again, or I'd use a prepared pie crust.

Couple notes ... Recipe isnt particularly clear. what does "1 package of shortbread cookies - 5 oz" mean? There is way too much filling and it does taste like strawberry jello cause that's what it is ... i added a tablespoon of cointreau. It did take forever to set - again - an issue with the recipe. I think the published recipes should be better tested.

My gelatin was taking forever and there was a lot of extra filling, so I just used a slotted spoon to fill in with the diced strawberries (and some blueberries!) and poured in just enough of the gelatin. The crust got a little soggy but the pie looked beautiful once it set and still tasted great. I'll definitely make it again when I have more time.

We thought that this was a really delicious and easy pie. The amount of filling is perfect for a 9.5 inch pie plate - just make some extra crust. Also, it does take for like 40 minutes for the gelatin to begin to mound.

This pie took several hours to really set. There was too much filling for the size of the pie plate recommended. I thought the filling tasted like strawberry Jello, nothing special, but my company liked it.I have other recipes I enjoy more than this one.

Thumbs Up for this pie. Great Pie for sure.

people really like this pie. it really was a unique taste and crust was delicious. mostly easy, but dicing over a pound of strawberries was tough, did them by hand, not sure if you can put them in a food processor

A good pie, but I'm not sure I agree there's "nothing like it" as promised in the recipe intro. Shortbread crust was easy and very good. The filling definitely took longer to gel than the recipe stated. Overall the flavor was fine, but I like a little more juiciness in my fruit pie fillings and have other strawberry pie recipes I like better.

Tastes like summer! A delicious strawberry pie and I love the shortbread crust! I found that I had enough filling left over to fill 3 ramekins. I'll plan to reduce the amount of filling OR have more whole strawberries to fill a second pie.

Rating: 3
I agree it takes about 40 minutes rather than 20-30 for the filling to mound. Very good pie and I really liked the fact that the gelatin filling was soft yet firm enough to not overflow the crust when you pour it in. (It makes a lot of filling for a 9" crust)

This pie has got to be heaven sent- I'm not much of a baker and am normally skittish when it comes to making pie- but this recipe is easy and excellent. Just what one wants on a warm summer evening.

This is soooooo much better than ones you can buy @ any popular pie restaurants! Since I baked 8" pie crust, I made less fillings and added 2 tablespoons of Marsala in it. It came out really good!

I have made this pie three times in the past week. I have made it as written and it was very good. I have also made it with the following change: I placed pieces of bittersweet chocolate on the crust, hot out of the oven. I let the chocolate melt, spread it over the crust using the back of a teaspoon. I then just followed the recipe to the end. One note: It takes about 40 minutes for the gelatine to set enough to mold. I will be using this recipe to make berry pies for the rest of the summer!
