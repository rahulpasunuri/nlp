This is one of my all time favorite tenderloin recipes. I have gone to it more than a few times. It seems that there are two kinds of beef lovers out there: those who like sweet sauces, such as port based sauces, and those who like acidic sauces, such as this one. If you are in the acidic camp, you will love this. And if nothing else, the dressing here is great on salads.

This was a great main dish for a birthday dinner. I agree with the comment from Kingwood TX that it takes much longer to cook than stated. Nevertheless, with the dressing and the watercress it was impressive and very tasty. Expensive, yes, but worth it.

This was excellent. I used more pepper and added a good bit of rosemary-garlic seasoning. Our guests raved about it. Cooking time took another 10 minutes past the recommended time, but it was a large tenderloin. Definitely will make again.

The beef roast nicely. I didn't have any of the ingredients for the dressing. It was acceptable dinner.

We didn't like the vinaigrette with the beef at all. There are many other options on this site for sauces on beef roasts that are much better.

My boyfriend and I enjoyed the sumptuous and bold flavors. The full flavor of the tenderloin shone through while the vinaigrette offered a sophisticated zest. Simple ingredients; although the beef price was unwelcomed. Uncertain whether or not we were to eat the watercress or if it was for simple garnish. -James
