Great fresh and tart marmalade. The MaMade oranges can will make 2-3 times this recipe (~9 good size jars of marmalade). Using sterile canning techniques, this makes a great gift. Would not be the same without the kumquats. This was my first crop of fruit from my kumquat tree and I'm looking forward to using this recipe next season, too. I may experiment with limes, too if my new lime tree produces. I froze the remainder of the Seville oranges; they can be used in other sauces.

This recipe calls for only part of a can of (imported from England) Spanish Seville oranges. Rather than waste the rest you must double the recipe. This makes the marmalade rather expensive. A better marmalade and easier also is to use just the Ma Made Seville oranges (William Sonoma $7.00) and not go to the work and expense of adding apricots and kumquats.
