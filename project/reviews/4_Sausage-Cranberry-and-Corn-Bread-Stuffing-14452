This has been a favorite in my family for 5 years now, was so glad to have found the recipe. My husband is allergic to pecans, so we use water chestnuts instead. I make it outside of the turkey. There's rarely leftovers!

Made this for Thanksgiving after much deliberation... I adore my moms recipe for dressing but decided to try something new. The whole time I prepared it, I was worried I'd made a mistake. The cranberries were SO tart, I'd used a gluten free cornbread recipe, wasn't sure about the italian sausage instead of standard pork. But the end result was REALLY wonderful. I loved it. The presentation also makes this a very special dish.

Everyone loves this stuffing! Followed the recipe except: used two Jiff loaves of corn bread, 1 pound of Italian sausage and 3 cups of chicken broth. Make everything a day ahead except the broth. Add the broth the next day right before baking.

I made this for our family Thanksgiving last night and everyone loved it. Changes that I made to the recipe: I purchased baked cornbread and mixed it with half Italian country bread (Pugliese). I also used half spicy sausage and half regular, and I used a whole onion instead of leeks. Next time I make this I will use all spicy sausage, add some fresh sage. The mix of breads was a good call.

I have been making this stuffing since 1998. This is now my standard stuffing. I get so many requests for this stuffing, that I make it sometimes just because my family loves it! It is so good, a must try! :)

I make this recipe every year, except I use Mrs. Cubbins stuffing mix and add extra chicken broth to make it moist. I also substitute sage sausage for the italian sausage.

I hosted my first Thanksgiving, and this stuffing was a favorite. I had made corn muffins and they didn't come out of the pan whole, so stuffing was actually Plan B. The fresh cranberries add a nice contrast, sweet Italian sausage took care of the spices, and those corn muffins got a second life. I should have let some of the cubes of cornbread bake a bit longer so they'd hold their shape - they came out as delicious mush.

I used this recipe as a guide and it was phenomenal. I used hot sausage, a golden sweet cornbread recipe, shallots and scallion, dried cranberries, pecans and fresh thanksgiving herbs. I threw in a couple of eggs to keep it together. it was great - can't wait for leftovers!

I used this recipe when I was hosting my very first Thanksgiving and it was AMAZING. Easy to make and a bit hit with everyone there--and I had a lot of people to please. I promise if you try it, you'll love it!

See that some have had problems with the recipe, I've made it several times and keep coming back to it. May try a trick or two from here to moisten it up but it hasn't been bone dry but not as moist as our white bread stuffing (family recipe) that we always make along side this one.

I have served this for the last two Thanksgivings and my family continues to rave. I use hot Italian sausage and half corn bread/ half herb white bread stuffing (prepackaged). Don't short the nuts or cranberries!

I've been trying to perfect this recipe for quite some time. Here's what I've discovered so far: 1/The cornbread is key; make sure you make this with a cornbread recipe you really like. Don't use the recipe given here, unless you like your cornbread coarse and dry. 2/Play with the ingredient amounts until you find the balance you like. 3/Use dried, sweetened cranberries instead of fresh, unless you like tart cranberry flavor. 4/Consider using 1/4 to 1/2 dried bread along with the cornbared. 5/Make sure your dressing is *really* moist before cooking. I finally added a lot more bouillon this year, thinking I'd added too much... and it was perfect. 6/If you like your dressing soft and fluffy, add an egg or two. I did that this year, and it brought this recipe close to perfect. Can't wait to try it again next year, with a better cornbread recipe. Oh, cut the corn/bread cubes small.

We make this every Thanksgiving and it is delicious. I substitute water chestnuts for the pecans because my son is allergic to nuts.

This receipe, accidently found in our perennial quest for the best stuffing ever, has become the family favorite of 3 generations. Our quest is now over - and this receipe continues to be passed down as a family tradition.

We love this stuffing! I started with the original recipe in 2000 and have tried variations every year since then. Our favorite is to use Portuguese or Spanish dried Chorizo instead of the Italian sausage. I make the cornbread recipe suggested using 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown for a bit more flavour. You do have to watch the pecans when you toast them. I usually try 300 degrees for 8-10 minutes, watching carefully after 8. It is our Thanksgiving staple now.

This is the first stuffing I've ever made and everyone really enjoyed it. The recipe made a huge amount, but the leftovers disappeared quickly. I used Tofurky Italian sausage instead of the real deal and it still turned out great. If you want to make this veg, the tofurky italian sausage is definitely the best veggie sausage I've come by.

This was a last minute Thanksgiving selection, and everyone absolutely loved this recipe. Easy to make and the cranberries provide an unexpected zing. Short on time, I used a mix for the cornbread, and it was still fabulous. This one is going into my keeper files.

So good. I had never made or had cornbread stuffing, so I may not be the best person to vouche for it, but it really was good. Multiple people remarked how appetizing it looked with all of the colors. So pretty and very good.

I couldn't find any chestnuts last year, so I didn't make my usual chestnut stuffing, which is delicious but a pain to make. This was much simpler and it was a huge hit. A family member who normally does not like stuffing has asked me to make it again, so I will. Goodbye, chestnuts!

This is a wonderful recipe. I used 1 lb leeks (which was 2 fat leeks), 1 lb of sausage ("Fromage & Vino" from Trader Joe's), a 1-lb loaf of cornbread from Trader Joe's, and skipped the pecans. Really delicious, the cranberries & cornbread add a nice sweetness that contrasts with the savory sausage. Baked in a 10" wide, 3" deep round casserole. Try it!

So many things wrong with this it's hard to know where to start. My normally spot-on oven was apparently way too hot for many things here - the cornbread began burning after only 40 minutes (not an hour as specified), the pecans burned to a black-brown char in less than 10 minutes (I picked out what I could salvage to use in the recipe, but they still tasted burned) and the ratios seemed way off - it was really mealy and bland and not savory/tasty at all. Very dry and a very bad taste. I would half the amount of cornbread it called for and cook it at a much lower temp, and I might not even toast the pecans at all if I ever made it again, which is unlikely. This was supposed to be the "highlight" of my Thanksgiving and it nearly ruined the meal - nobody ate it and it got thrown out.

This was really good. I used a full pound of country sausage, which I think gave it extra flavor and substance. I also added some red pepper flakes & cayenne pepper to the mix. That helped give it a kick and off-set the sweetness of the cornbread. I had to use Jiffy b/c that's all they had at the store, and I didn't have time to make my own. I was worried that the Jiffy would be too sweet, but it was perfect. Next time, I would leave out the cranberries - too tart - and seemed out of place. Just a personal preference. I also used close to 3 cups of broth and drizzled more broth before I baked it. We prefer a moist stuffing.

We have made this stuffing several times now and always get rave reviews! Not only are the flavors wonderful, but it is a beautiful dish to present with the color of the cranberries. Watch out for the number of leeks - 7 leeks is way more than a pound where I get them! It's better to ignore the number and just go by the weight, though the year that I didn't and inadvertently doubled the amount of leeks it still came out great!

I have made this for the past 5 years. It's amazing!! I love the tart/sweetness of the fresh cranberries. I would add a bit more chickenstock if you like it moist, or cook covered until the end and then take off tinfoil to brown the top.

I've used this recipe for the last 7 Thanksgivings... it's very good, but needs a little adjustment: 1/Use dried cranberries, not fresh. The fresh are too tart. Some dried cranberries come with less/no sugar if you're worried about it being too sweet. 2/Use a different cornbread recipe. This one is just not that good, way too dense and makes for a heavier stuffing. Other than that, my guests usually love this recipe - it's unusual and all the flavors go really well with a good turkey.

Fabulous! My favorite stuffing recipe. I make it every year. Try toasting the pecans for more flavor, you can also try using the turkey jucies instead of chicken broth.

great stuffing! only thing i might change is the sausage. i didn't love the italian sausage, and i like that person's idea of using sage sausage. i do wonder what it would be like with dried cranberries (soaked in something first), but the tart fresh ones were good. oh yeah, and i had an extra cup of giblet stock (from the ROAST TURKEY WITH CIDER GRAVY recipe) that was supposed to be poured over the chestnut stuffing from that recipe. poured it over this stuffing before putting it in the oven, maybe that's why i didn't think it was dry at all.

I think stuffing is all a matter of taste and it's not that this one wouldn't be great for some tastes, it just wasn't for ours! I cooked it alongside the turkey for a group of four and nobody asked for seconds, much less really finishing firsts. Part of it may be the sausage (something I decided I didn't like in stuffing) but it did look beautiful on the table.

A bust. I expected this to be great, and instead it was very dry and not too flavorful, and a waste of my fabulous leeks. Nothing wrong with the idea, but it just didn't have the flavor of our other stuffings. I'll go back to Jasper White's sausage and sage recipe (on this site) next year.

Incredibly, deliciously awesome! Used two different types of corn bread mix (Martha White and Jiffy and added frozen corn to the martha white). I made it the day before and it didn't lose any flavor or texture. It was a huge hit...

Tasty! I used sage sausage and next time might add spicy sausage for even more zip. A little on the dry/crumbly side, as my family is used to a traditional German wet dressing; will probably add more broth next time around.

This is the best stuffing I have ever made and my guests gave it a definate "thumbs up". Made the corn bread a few days before, toasted it as recommended, and received nothing but raves. Added a bit more sausage but only because I prefer it. It doesn't come better than this!!!

Made this for Canadian Thanksgiving in October and absolutely loved it. Although I've always been a fan of traditionl sage & onion stuffing I think this may become our new staple for turkey stuffing. The accompanying corn bread recipe is very nice on its own.

I am famous with my husbands family for always bringing something "foo-foo" to the gatherings. There was a little nose turning initally to this dressing because of the "un-american" mixture, but they all agreed it was awesome. The pecans and cranberries really add to the flavors. The first time I made it I used storebought cornbread but have always made it myself since and it is incredible!

I made this in 1998 for Thanksgiving and it was a success. I plan to do it again for 99. Go easy on the cranberries if you plan to serve cranberry sauce too.

We made this for Thanksgiving 97 and loved it. When ready, it has a beautiful presentation yellow against glistening berries with leeks. CAUTION DO NOT OVERCOOK. Our turkey needed some more time so we kept the stuffing in the oven all covered to keep warm --it lost its beautiful colors and dried a bit. Better to undercook this one and pop back in the oven for the last 15 minutes! We are making again this year and will watch timing carefully!

I don't care for organ meats in my stuffing/dressing -- the way my mother-in-law makes it. So, for our family Thanksgiving dinner in 1997 I volunteered to make this recipe (in self-defense). It was great!! The savory/sweet/tangy flavors are interesting and a nice counterpoint to the turkey. We prepared it both in and out of the bird, and we decided that we liked it better out. I didn't have time to make it last year, but I will definitely make it in 1999, and beyond.
