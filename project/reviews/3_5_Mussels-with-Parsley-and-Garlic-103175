This recipe is delicious and easy, but it kills me to see people adding Parmesan to a dish like this. I don't get it. Please don't do it.

Scrumptuous, and so easy to make. Also, many variations are possible with this basic recipe (changing the herbs, adding wine, etc.)

We thought this was just OK, and I don't plan to make it again.

I was very disappointed. Mussels steamed are much better(moist) compared to cooking in the oven. I thought this was bland,even though I added white wine & chopped plum tomato....

I tend to agree with those who find adding the extra salt is not necessary. The aroma of garlic from the oven seems to tempt even the most skiddish clam tasters to test.

Excellent! I wouldn't change a thing except that I would not add the salt. The broth is salty enough without it.

This was divine. I was pressed for time, so all I did was zap half a stick of butter in the microwave, chop up a few cloves of garlic, pour the whole mess over the mussels, and bake. My guests made them disappear in minutes, and we sopped up the garlic butter with crusty bread. Unbelievably good and so easy.

It was delicious and so easy! I substituted cilantro for the parsley and added 1/2 cup of white wine. ¡Riquisimo!

This recipie is so easy! I varied it a little, added chopped fresh tomatoes, 1/2 cup of white wine, olive oil and butter and finished it with fresh grated parmesean. I put the pan on the grill instead of the oven and served it with grilled ciabatta bread brushed with olive oil as a first course. My husband loved it!

You can't go wrong with any dish that has butter and garlic. Absolutely delicious! I would definitely double the butter and garlic and perhaps melt it first, then pour over the mussels and bake. Next time I will add some white wine to keep it moist. Don't overcook and don't forget the delicious bread that is a must to sop up the juices!

I too added extra garlic and butter and it was DELICIOUS!!! The soft butter flavors mixed with the kick of garlic was a perfect compliment to the earthy mussels. A decadent dish that is simple and quick to prepare.

I read other reviews before actually making this dish. Some thought it a little bland so I used 5 cloves of garlic and a whole stick of butter. Well let me tell you, they just disappeared. My husband, who claims not to like mussels, ate a large portion of them. I will definitely use this recipe again.

My husband and I both really loved this dish and we are both "Big Mussel" fans. I think next time I will add grated Parmesan cheese for a little extra flavor.

This was a hit at the hospital that I work at!! Everyone was amazed at how easy and tasty it was!! Since mussels are inexpensive you can make large portions without breaking the bank!

This was good but needed something, lacked richness.

Delicious! I served these with a baguette and a green salad for a perfect meal for two.

Good flavor. I strained the "nectar" to make a pleasantly flavored rice side dish.
