So good! I love this recipe and its now a staple...with or without the egg (although the frilly, crunchy egg is really a treat and adds a great texture). I typically amp up the spices a little bit and have substituted swiss chard and even kale for the spinach with equally delicious results. This is delicious winter comfort food.

I absolutely love this recipe and make it on a weekly basis. As others have stated, I do increase the cumin and paprika. I use 1 heaping tsp cumin and 1/2 heaping tsp paprika. I even have used frozen spinach in a pinch as a substitue for fresh. When doing this, just make sure to squeeze the excess water out. To save on calories, I fry an egg in a non-stick skillet and that works beautifully. This is a very hearty and delicious dish!

Like many reviewers I prepared a "drier" version of this richly flavored recipe by omitting nearly all of the liquid. I used the fire roasted diced tomatoes which I placed in a strainer, pressing out all the liquid before adding to the chick peas. I doubled the paprika and cumin seeds, added 1 t. ground cumin and used only 1/2 cup of the broth to deglaze the pan. This resulted in a delicious, drier version. I may use more broth next time to make it saucy. The crispy egg on top added a nice texture and worth the splattered oil in the preparation. I will definitely make this again and again!

AMAZINGLY EXCELLENT!!! My wife and I couldn't stop eating this until it was all gone! I tripled the Cumin and Paprika since I love both flavors (and because my spices were a little old). Also, I added a heaping Tbsp of chili powder, and some crushed red pepper flakes for a little more "zing." I had not read the reviews to drain the tomatoes first, I just dumped in a 15oz can of whole tomatoes and used my wooden spoon to smash them and cut them apart. It added a little more cooking time to thicken up but nothing was close to being overcooked. ***The fried eggs are the real kicker here. Tasty without them if you are vegan, but if not, you HAVE to do the eggs, fried in oil, just like this!***

Very delicious! As other suggested, drain the tomatoes after crushing them. I also doubled the smoked paprika. Will definitely be making this again very soon!

I thought very good flavor. Common pitfall seems to be amount of liquid from the tomatoes. I jumped to the diced, per other reviews, but didn't extract enough liquid prior to adding to pan. So never got caramelized and liquid prevented chick peas from browning. They still cooked up, but I missed a layer of flavor here. Really strain / squeeze the juice out, you can add it later after the caramelizing. Also, my eggs failed slightly. Still edible, but edges over crunchy and oil splattered terribly. Was my oil too hot? Prepared on 'medium.' What temp would others recommend for the oil. Next time will try 'frying' instead of poaching in oil to see if can avoid the mess. Really like this though!

I took some other reviewers advice, and had a delicious meal for two. I used 1can of chickpeas, 1 can of diced tomatoes drained, and about 1 1/2 cups of chicken stock. Also about 1 tbsp of ground cumin and 1 1/2 tsp paprika. Added some lemon and chopped kalamata olives at the end, fried the eggs normally, and served with hummus and pita.

This recipe works breakfast, lunch & dinner. I prefer "bigger" flavors, and so I probably triple the amount of cumin & paprika. Otherwise the aromatics get lost behind canned tomatoes.

Very good but the cook times are off. I had to increase the cooking times significantly. I did not need the extra broth.

This was delicious and hearty. I used 1 can of diced tomatoes and it made the dish very watery. Like another reviewer, I also had to spend time draining the juices, which increased the overall cooking time. My dish was also more red than in the picture. I will use a can of whole tomatoes (drained) next time or just a 1/2 can of diced tomatoes (drained), and maybe cut down on the broth. I'll also add more spinach next time. Otherwise, I highly recommend this recipe.

Can't we do something about the judgemental person from Salt Lake City? She doesn't indicate that she made this dish, but gives it only 2 forks because it has too much oil to be healthy, in her opinion. For heaven's sakes. Don't make it, then. I personally can't wait to try it.

Wasn't sure what to expect, but this was fantastic! Definitely double the spices, and plain fried eggs (vs with crispy edges) would work just fine. A filling, hearty, excellent meal.

I agree with that you should double the cumin and the paprika. I added the juice of 1 lemon, just to add some acidity and it was great. I did use a can of drained diced tomtoes. Very easy, flavorful weekday meal.

This was a delicious and healthy meal that was much easier than I thought it would be. I was out of onions so I substituted a green pepper for texture and some scallions for taste. In the future I would double the Cumin and Paprika and skip the salt.

An easy weeknight meal - this was a hit with the whole family. The sum is definitely greater than the parts. I took the chickpeas in for lunch the next day but didn't bother frying another egg to top it and it was really lacking. We used pita to scoop it injera style. Next time we'll probably double the paprika and add a bit more cumin. Our paprika may be old though...

the general concept of this recipe is delicious. i used 3 cans of drained fire roasted diced tomatoes and saved the juice(which i ended up not using). I doubled the cumin powder and paprika amounts. i found that cooking the tomatoes with the chick peas did not need additional fluids that the recipe called for. don't skimp on the spinach and definitely cook the eggs as directed!

Of course it is tasty--it calls for frying everything and in 1/2 cup olive oil! Olive oil may be the "good" oil, but this may be too much of a good thing.

Loved this recipe and even my doubting husband (chickpeas and spinach and an egg for dinner??) loved it. I also used ground cumin and more tomatoes, but I agree that a can of diced tomatoes would be easier. I found the egg frying to be unnecessary though. I would probably just crack an egg into a non-stick pan next time, and use that, instead of an entire egg frying in oil process. I thought that added unnecessary fat and work.

to those who used canned diced tomatoes: did you drain the cans before cooking the tomatoes and how many cans did you use?

Wow--absolutely delicious with just the following adjustment: I used 2 tsp cumin seeds and heaping tsp of smoked paprika. I don't know if I'll ever eat a fried egg any other way.

Served house guests as an alternative to pancakes. Every loved this, asked for the recipe even.

I can't believe how tasty this was, even before adding the eggs. Made a double-batch the night before for a brunch and was a total hit. I used ground cumin instead of seeds, and only added a total of 4c stock; it reduced nicely while still having some broth to it, but that helped with reheating the next morning. Plan to share recipe with many people.

Made this last night, I used canned diced tomatoes and between them and the 3 cups of stock it was very watery. Spent a long time reducing it to a consistency that wouldn't resemble soup, but other than that, it was excellent, loved the flavours! To quote my husband "it doesn't look pretty but it's delicious!"

Yum! This was a hit at my house - the crispier the edges of the eggs the better. I added about a tsp of cumin in addition to the cumin seeds and it was very flavorful. I didn't scrimp on the spinach and was glad.

Great meal on its own, tried to divide down to 2 servings but was still plenty there, filling and great tasting. I used fire roasted tomatoes as well

Nice meal on a cold fall or winter night. I couldn't get the chickpeas to brown; I think next time I will pan roast them first before adding the tomatoes. The tomatoes release a lot of juice and dont carmelize easily. I had to drain off the juices and then add back with the veg broth after. Wonderful flavours, especially with the egg on top

Delicious, flavorful and light! The only fault that I can find........it was included in the 'fast, easy, fresh' portion of Bon Appetit and it was fairly time consuming. Made it exactly as written and it was met with raves. I think next time I might add a little extra spinach (I used a 5oz box) and canned diced tomatoes (it would be simpler), but otherwise it's perfect.
