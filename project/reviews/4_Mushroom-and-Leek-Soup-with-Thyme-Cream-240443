This soup is amazing! I followed to a tee- found it needed more salt and pepper. I used homemade chicken stock from my own chickens and leeks from my garden. Lots of flavor there! The thyme cream is a nice touch though not necessary- this soup holds its own just fine without. Surprised so many found fault with this recipe. I plan to continue making for years to come!

made this for a dinner party a while back and it was a huge success! Everyone loved it. It tasted better the next day as did the tyme cream. I am making this again for an afternoon get together cooking group that exchange recipes and critique the dish. I picked this one because it is easy and flavourful.

Given the mixed reviews, I debated whether to make this for a dinner party. I didn't used the flour, but planned to puree a cup or so to thicken it. It didn't need thickening. What it needed was flavor. When it was finished, all I tasted was chicken stock and salt. I'm not one of those reviewers who alters a recipe completely and then comments. I followed this one to the letter, minus the flour and it was not subtle, it was bland. So I started improvising to see if I could save it. I added more fresh thyme. I added tarragon,which helped. I added sherry. I soaked some dried porcini in some of the stock and threw that in. I kept tinkering until there was some flavor. But made accorging to the recipe, this had nothing going for it. When I finally served it with the thyme cream, it was fine, but it was a far cry from the original.

quite nice. I added a little extra fresh thyme. Think it may be perfect tomorrow, tonight a little thin. If not, will add another TB of flour next time. Cooked leeks and mushrooms in mixtures of half butter and half olive oil, they emitted a lot of mushroom juice which I included in the soup.

Rating: 1
Very underwhelming. The whipped cream is a nice touch but its bland and unimpressive. The chosen mushrooms are boring and there's really nothing special here. Don't waste your time, move on.

There were mixed reviews in the household after serving this soup. General consensus was that it was not anything special in terms of taste. However, if you are looking for a very healthy choice, absent the thyme cream, this is a soup for you. We will not make again.

I can't believe I am just now reviewing after making this multiple times every fall and winter for two years! This soup is my all time favorite soup. It is the perfect comfort food when the weather starts to turn chilly. It is simple but really fantastic. Definitely make the thyme cream, I promise it is worth it!

Rating: 1
Even with farm fresh ingredients, this was disappointing. After all the good reviews, it was really nothing special. I didn't care for the thyme cream, it didn't add much - and I LOVE thyme and cream. I took the time to properly brown the mushrooms and handle the leeks, but it didn't do much for me.

Absolutely loved this recipe and cooked it by the recipe, no changes. In fact, I had to cook 20 quarts of it for a church soup sale (I was brushing and chopping mushrooms and soaking and chopping leeks for 8 hours). People want me to cook it again. I love it.. for myself.. so I gave them this recipe.

You know a soup is good when Christmas dinner guests say that they loved the whole meal but the soup was their favorite. I used half baby bellas and half creminis. The only change I will make next time is to reduce the amount of pepper, but that may just be my personal taste since I'm not a big pepper fan. The thyme cream is the perfect touch and finishes the soup beautifully.

Omg, YUM! I made this for Thanksgiving this year and served it as a first course. I prepared the soup two days in advance and then just reheated it on the stove before serving. It was a huge hit! I got pretty frazzled on the big day, so instead of whipping my own cream, I threw the minced thyme into some creme fraiche I picked up at Trader Joe's for another recipe. It was the perfect complement to the savory, earthy soup. The soup is really easy to make, and the simplicity of the dish lets the fresh ingredients shine.

Rating: 4
Heavenly! I was thrilled to see the looks of the Thanksgiving guests when they took their first spoonful. Like another reviewer, I sliced the mushrooms closer to 1/8 inch. I used a wok to cook both the mushrooms and the leeks, then transferred them to a soup pot for simmering in the broth. It really is important to brown the mushrooms. I let them cook until all of the released liquid had evaporated and all the sizzling had stopped. I used half the amount of butter, which worked out just fine. I did not do the flour thing. Just didn't seem right with the delicate flavors. Instead, when the soup was finished, I pureed about a cup and added it back to the pot. The texture was perfect that way. And, as others have said, don't omit the thyme cream. That plus a tiny garnish of thyme tips made a gorgeous presentation, and the cream added just the right amount of richness.

The critical thing to remember when cooking classic French style dishes such as this is that the flavours are not supposed to be complex. They feature a small number of fresh, simple ingredients cooked with traditional skills, and the goal is to turn them into a dish with lovely gentle nuances of flavour. But I must emphasize that technique is everything. We live in a delightfully multicultural world, and the skills required for one cuisine often don't apply to another. (Honestly, I'm happy they don't - the world would be so boring!) When I was in French Culinary school we used to compete: With ingredients from the same 'frig and the exact same recipes we vied for best flavour. It was always the same winners - the ones who were really solid on French technique. So if this recipe isn't working well for you, cut it and yourself some slack. French cooking is deceptively challenging, because with only a few ingredients the classic techniques are all you really have.

This mushroom soup is my new favorite. Exceptional flavor! Browning the mushrooms is critical, working in small batches so they don't stew. And the thyme cream is a MUST!

this soup was good and easy to make, but, in my opinion, not out of this world good. I've had thinner mushroom soups that tasted a lot better. I think I would try it again with different kinds of mushroom to make it more interesting.

This is a wonderful soup although I needed to make some changes. I used large white mushrooms instead of the baby bellas (they wanted nearly $4.00 for 6 oz of them and I'm on a strict budget). I also used one yellow onion instead of the leeks. Do not skip the thyme cream, it adds a lovely satiny voluptuousness that would be seriously missing without it. I also added 2 garlic cloves. I'll make this again and again.

Rating: 4
Superb! Fantastic flavor and although the description says it's a "light" soup -- it's very filling. Some of the previous reviewers said that they wouldn't bother making the thyme cream -- DON'T LISTEN TO THEM -- it's easy to do and adds fantastic flavor and depth to the soup. The only change I made to the recipe was to add 2 cloves of garlic (sliced) in with the leeks.

Rating: 4
Incredible soup. I used it as the first course of a special party meal, and my guests were oohing and aahing enthusiastically as they ate it. My only caution: the rest of the meal needs to be good enough not to seem disappointing after this terrific opening act.

One of the best soups I've ever made. The thyme cream is a wonderful garnish. I used a combo of cremini and shiitake mushrooms--I think it would be good with any combination. You get a lot of bang for your buck with how simple this soup is to prepare.

Rating: 2
I'd make this again; the preparation was simple and the flavor was very good. It worked very well with a nice salad pre-Tgiving as a light(ish) meal before a day of gluttony. I liked the soup "as is", however, I think I'd add carrots, parsnips or some other seasonal veg to enhance the texture so it's not only mushroom in each bite.

Have to agree with previous negative reviews. Not bad, just not that special. In this case, the thyme cream business is just presentation silliness that is putting the cart in front of the horse. Not sure if I agree w/ previous descriptions of the soup being "bland" since I associate that w/ undersalting. However, I will say that the flavor of the soup is quite simple and I don't think "leeks, mushrooms, and thyme soup" qualifies as anything special. And, yes, wife and mother both said it was awesome - don't let that fool you. So, I made this last night cream and all and we ate about half of it. Today I was unhappy with the state of my cast iron skillet and once I was done re-seasoning it I was going to fry something no matter what. Starting with one unlucky white onion I made the following changes to the s oup (1/2 recipe!) - 1 baseball-sized white onion chopped 1/4" dice - 1 Tbsp unsalted butter. - fry onion in butter slowly taking perhaps 30 minutes to achieve nice light brown color. - add 1 roughly chopped chipotle pepper (IMPORTANT!) - add 1 clove minced garlic. Fry some more even more slowly - add another TSP fresh chopped thyme - add 1 TBSP fresh chopped cilantro. To finish I added a tsp or two of low-sodium Knorr's chicken bouillon and fried it for about 2 more minutes. I removed heat and added two cups of water. Then I put the entire mixture into the blender and blended it until smooth. Finally, I poured the finished product back into the leftover soup from last night. Much improved.

My wife loved it. I made a 2/3 batch due to having only 2 leeks handy, but left the broth at full 6 cups due to soup getting too dense. Added garlic. I had a cold, so I couldn't taste a damn thing, but my honey says it goes in the "keeper" file. Even my 5 year-old liked it.

A delicious soup! Some have reviewed this soup as being bland, perhaps if you follow the recipe exactly it might be but it wasn't at all with the slight changes I made. - use salted butter instead of unsalted - add a bit of onion (2 parts leek, one part onion) - use both baby bella mushrooms and a handfull of shitakes Others have said the flour isn't necessary, it isn't but it gives a bit of a thicker soup if you use it. Make sure to add it to the vegetables before mixing the broth in. I will definitely make this soup over and over.

Rating: 3
Good, but not great. Adding the flour caused my vegetables to get a bit too congealed. Not sure what that step is for. Also used shitaki instead of white mushrooms and added some dried porcini which were fabulous in the soup. Finally as others have said, the whipped cream is a must.

What's all the fuss - haven't you other reviewers ever eaten GOOD soup. Made as directed, mostly. Had less mushrooms (about 5-6 Cups) so I only used 32oz of broth. I used about 1/2 and 1/2 crmini and fresh shiitake, since I had them on hand. Used 4 leeks for about 2-21/2 Cups after cutting. Took suggestions of previous reviewers and added sherry and 1 garlic clove. Also used my go-to seasoning, Nature's Seasoning to pump up the flavor and added small amount of Minor's chicken stock concentrate. Here's what I think. Slice the mushrooms way thinner. Saute some bacon and use the drippings to sweat the leeks in. (Not much, maybe 1 TBS instead of butter). Puree at least 1/2 the soup to concentrate the flavor and give the soup better body. The whipped cream w/ thyme was a nice touch, but it would work as well to add some cream and thyme directly to the soup and skip the whipping part. I'll make the soup again using my suggestions and re-review it. Curious to see what others think of these ideas. Very labor intensive for the result.

Wow. This recipe is fantastic. My fiance claimed that it was the best soup he'd ever eaten. I made the recipe for a dinner party and every single guest cleaned their bowl! I loved the thyme cream on top, but agree that it's not necessary for ordinary eating. I'd also suggest increasing the thyme to 4 tsp for a little more flavor.

Excellent soup! We loved it. It was right at the edge of being too salty, though. Next time I will go with 1/2 teaspoon salt (I did use unsalted butter and low-sodium chicken broth). I also I added a clove of garlic to the soup. Having the option of adding a dollop of cream is a great addition. I think next time I will make the whipped cream without the fresh thyme though. The fresh thyme was overpowering.

Made the soup 2 days in advance, added a dash of heavy cream and a shot of Sherry. The dollop of thyme cream was good, but not necessary if you are interested in reducing calories. Served with Thanksgiving dinner, and now I'm fulfilling all the requests for copies of the recipe!

I added a touch of cream to the soup while cooking it, as it was just a bit thin, and using the thyme cream alone to get the best amount of dairy would have cooled the soup off more than is desirable. Also added some fancy mixed mushrooms I wanted to use up, worked great. Yummy soup!

So Frickin' Easy! It took less than 20 minutes to throw the whole thing in a pot. And then all you have to do after that is let it do its thing. And the best part is guest loved it. Additionally, I opted to bake soups (after stove cooking was done) in 8oz casserole dishes with puff pastry dough on top for dramatic effect. I think just offered the cream at the table.

OMG. I can't think of anything better to do with a muchroom and a leek. Delicious and super easy to make. I didn't have any thyme, so I used fresh rosemary instead...tasted greate. This one is now heavy in the rotation...I could eat this soup for two weeks straight.

exquisite overall main course but I must comment on the size of the leeks, I made a mistake and cut them slightly on the obese size. This, in the end did not matter, the leeks were soften and were a delicious little treat in the bowl and I did not have to puree the final result. I would also like to comment that the garnish of cream and thyme is a MUST HAVE area of this dish. I made this for six people, all of them were left full and very satisfied. Over all this is a FANTASTIC recipe.

This was an extremely good soup. I cut the recipe in half as it was just for the two of us. All I had were cremini mushrooms but thought it was perfect. I didn't have any whipping cream so I just used 18% table cream. I put the thyme in the cream to infuse the flavor as directed and brought the cream to room temperature before serving,swirling it into the soup. This was excellent.

My sister made this soup and just had to try it after her raving reviews. I did make a few changes, I do tend to do that to all recipes, sorry. I added wine and garlic to the mushrooms as they cooked. I used baby bella and shitaki shrooms, omitted the flour and will use less butter for sure next time. I also didn't use the heavy cream and thyme, personally didn't need. I did blend it all for a little bit before simmering for the 20 min.

This soup is fabulous. I made it the night before I served it, and my houseguest suggested I cancel the dinner party so she could have the soup all to herself. This soup is an elegant and delicious way to begin a meal. It's very tasty and also light. I made it just as written. Wouldn't change a thing.

I served this soup for Christmas Eve Dinner and everyone thought it was delicious. I did follow the advice of another reviewer and used a variety of mushrooms. I also added some white wine with the chicken broth. I pureed the soup when it was done cooking. Since I made the soup ahead (and the whipped thyme cream), I reheated it right before dinner. The next time I make it, I will try using some dried mushrooms to add depth.

Fantastic! I served this soup at Christmas Dinner to a discerning group and got rave reviews! I used tips from other reviewers and it really paid off. I could not find chanterelles, so I used 2 - 8 oz. pkgs. of crimini mushrooms, and 8 oz. white. I had a 1 oz. pkg. of dried mixed wild mushrooms in my pantry and I followed reviewer (gumby14) instructions. I also added 2 cloves of crushed garlic to the saute and 3 - 4 Tbl. Sherry, to taste. To cut down on prep, I used creme fraiche instead of having to whip heavy cream. The little bit of added "tang" really enhanced the soup.

This is the first review I have provided, but I loved this soup so much I wanted to share my experience and a couple of small changes that added. I think that they provided a great deal of depth to the flavor. I used 7 oz. crimini, 8 oz. white and 8 oz. shiitake...as that was what I had on hand. I had some dried Porcini and Chanterelle mushrooms in the pantry so used 1 oz of each. I reconstituted with 1.5 cups of boiling water and let soak for about 40 minutes. Drained the mushrrooms, chopped and added to the saute. Then strained the broth and used that as substitute for part of the chicken broth. Added a great earthy flavor. I used a hand held immersion blender and it was perfect for puree of the right consistency.

I thought the soup looked too chunky/unfinished when done, so I stuck it all in a blender and zapped it til smooth. It was a much more elegant presentation, especially with the dollop of thyme cream. If you're thinking of doing this, there is no need to add the flour - it's quite thick enough. Got rave reviews from my guests and was even better the next day.

This soup is super easy to make and is fabulous! I did half crimini/half white mushrooms to mix it up a little. It was *just* enough for 10 appetizer bowls. My guests RAVED and begged for the recipe. I'm definitely doubling next time for leftovers. Make a day or so ahead - it only gets better!

I have one word for this soup - BLAND. I love mushrooms, and it smelled so great when it was cooking, but the end product was like watered-down gravy. On top of that, it was a pretty labor-intensive food to have such a disappointing result. Maybe if you added a bunch of spices, this would be more interesting.
