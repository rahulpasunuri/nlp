This is now my standard pumpkin pie, classic with a twist!

I have made this pie alomost a dozen times. The orange flavored crust is almost cookie like. The orange gives the pumpkin filling an extra dimention of flavor. It is my most requested holiday dish. I can hardly eay plain pumpkin pie now!

I really enjoyed this pie--a little sweeter in a delicate way--and the orange added a nice touch. Would definately make it again!

Horrible! Found this recipe to be quite flavourless and dry... The orange with pumkin was too confusing as I find them to be quite strong tastes on their own and in this recipe, they battle each other! Not a battle I'll serve at Thanksgiving again! Can't win 'em all I guess...

Made this for Thanksgiving and it is a very good pumkin pie recipe. Most of the guests who said they did not like pumpkin pie liked this one. It's rich and only has a hint of orange flavour.

I - and everyone else - loves this pie. The orange makes it! I use evaporated fat-free milk in place of whipping cream and use low-fat sour cream. I can only imagine how much better it is with full fat!

I had never made a pumpkin pie without using the regular condensed milk recipe. This pie was by far more flavorful and fuller-fluffier like. It even looks more gourmet-like. Make a day ahead so the flavors blend, bring to room temp just before serving.

The orange adds a wonderful twist! Had two people tell me this Thanksgiving it was the best pumpkin pie they ever had.

I don't like pumpkin pie, but found this tastier than most. My taller half really enjoys this recipe, and it has been popular with guests.

Made a trial run of this recipe before Thanksgiving - everyone loved it! I only had fresh orange juice & will use concentrate next time for more orange taste. Texture was excellent. A real winner for our pumpkin pie loving family!
