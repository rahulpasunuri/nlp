Love this recipe. Made it for my grandson's 6th birthday this week and it was a big hit. The instructions were easy to follow for the cake, icing and fondant zombie parts.

phenomenal. as much fun to make as it is to eat. Try using varieties of chocolate - we used mint chocolate chips. Don't even think of making anything less than double the recipe.

I made the cupcakes and was disappointed that they did not rise. The flavor was great. Half and Half is fondant and gum paste. My first set of hands looked better than the second. I also used Milano's with RIP piped on them to add to the decor.

I did not make the cake part of this recipe, I used box cake with the oreo crumbs, ganache, and molded hands. The directions to make the Zombie hands are easy to follow and they turn out really cute! In the interest of time (and to add some variation) I alsom made headstone toppers for some of my cupcakes using a tiny bit of puple gel food coloring. They were a big hit! I would recommend making the hands at least 2 days in advance. I let mine dry with just the fingers resting against a vertical surface in order for them to curl overnight. The next day, after the fingers were somewhat set, I let them dry vertically by sticking the toothpick end in a couple of apples.

How can you make the "hands" out of Half and Half?? This must be an error in the recipe.

Am I missing something? How do you roll liquid half and half in the first step? Should if be frozen, or is it not the creamer that you are including?
