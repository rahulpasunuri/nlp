This is a new family favorite, will be making it for the second time tonight and everyone is really excited. I could not find guava jelly, so used apricot jam which was fantastic. I don't use vegetable oils so I used olive oil instead which also worked out very well.

One of my absolute favorite recipes. The combination of sweet and spicy is simply perfect. I've even added a little more habanero and the dish is still not too spicy. I do cook the meat a little longer than suggested, but otherwise the recipe is spot on. I serve it with grilled vegetables, coconut rice, and spicy pineapple salsa.

It was good but not exceptional. The blend of spices was interesting but there are better pork tenderloin recipes. It was ok.

Rating: 4
It was delicious, easy, and healthy. I would cook the pork longer than suggested unless you like it bloody. My tenderloins were less than 1 1/2 lbs and I cooked them about 7 min a side and they were rare/med rare. My family was complaining a little about it. Very tasty though

So, so, ssssooooooo good! I made this with roasted corn tossed with manchego cheese and green beans sauteed with pepitas. It was great all together! I'm so happy to have found this recipe!!!

Super! I made a couple of adjustments based on the ingredients I had. Instead of habanero pepper I used jalapenos (3 medium), 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes and a splash of habanero hot sauce. I also added some apricot jam to the mojo. And I added habanero hot sauce to the glaze. I served this over quinoa, my new favorite base. Definitely a do again.

I really enjoyed this recipe and will make it again. The mojo is fabulous! The next time around I will cut the requirements for the glaze and mojo in half. I had way too much left over. I was able to store the mojo in the fridge and use on a steamed fish and grilled chicken breasts for healthy and very yummy meals.

Made this about a year ago and had a hankering to make it tonight for dinner. I got home from work at 7 and dinner was on the table at 7:58. Improvisations -- Guava paste, jalepeno and dried red pepper instead of haberno. Served with Cardamon rice and peas. Yum!

What a perfect pork recipe! I'll make this one again. There was more than enough mojo sauce so I froze it for next time. The only deviations from the recipe I made was I added the 2nd half of the habanero to the glaze, it was not too spicy, I also added dried cilantro to the salt and pepper rub. I served it with black beans and rice and a green salad with cilantro-lime vinaigrette, it was a perfect meal. I would double the glaze recipe if I were to make this one for a crowd.

Did a test run with this recipe for an upcoming event and while I loved all the flavours, I am wondering if the mojo is supposed to thicken up? Love that the glaze and mojo can be made the day before.

Rating: 3
This was darned good and very easy. The glaze is enough for 4 tenderloins, so it can be cut in half for two. I thought the mojo needed a little something so I stirred in a bit of the guava jelly, and that made it just right.

I made this recipe for 30 people for a Summer Soltice party. It was absolutely incredible. My only regret is that I didn't calculate the sauce correctly for 30 and everyone was fighting over the last drops!

Excellent flavor. The sauce and glaze both easy to make and could be prepared ahead of time. Made it for a barbeque with friends and everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.

Made this for a party of 12 and it was a hit. The mojo sauce especially - the trick seemed to be to let it reduce significantly (at least half). Leftovers were also great for this too!

Rating: 4
The glazed pork tenderloin on its own was very tasty and the mojo sauce is amazing. It's got a real kick. We reduced the amount of oil to about 2 tsp. The leftover meat was tossed in a chopped salad with tomato and lettuce and topped with the mojo sauce. Delicious and low fat/calorie.

Wow! This recipe was a huge hit! The glaze was excellent, and oh the mojo!! I might make up a batch of mojo to keep around all the time. It was absolutely the perfect mix of sweet and hot, had a wonderful flavor, and scented the house while reducing. Excellent! Try this one!!!!

I made this for Easter dinner - everyone loved it! I did not make any changes. The mojo was to spicy for the grandparents (everyone else enjoyed it) so I & warmed some guava glaze for their sauce. will make again!!!

Wonderful dish! I didn't have much experience w/Cuban cooking, but had a "Cuban Night" dinner party with friends and everyone raved over this dish! The Mojo was so incredibly flavorful - perfect with the pork. And it's an easy recipe to follow. I used apricot preserves.

I cooked this recipe (with no alterations) for our family's last Sunday Night Dinner. My husband and my adult children liked it very much with the mojo and my grandchild, who is a very picky eater, loved the tenderloin with a little melted guava jelly on the side. I personally felt the mojo was missing something. Next time I'll add more cilantro, the other half of the habanero and more salt.

Rating: 2
This was just good for me. I couldn't find guava jelly so I used apricot that I had at home. I found that it too quite a while to cook on my gas grill, but the flavors were nice.

Rating: 2
HOT HOT HOT! I mean, we're from Texas, and this was almost unbearable! I could barely finish, and my husband had tears running down his face! However, I could tell the mix of flavors was delicious, but ruined by the heat of the habanero. I will use jalepenos next time, and yes, I would make it again.

Rating: 4
Really yummy and wonderful combination of flavors. I'd do it again!

Rating: 4
This was really good and very simple. I agree with others that the reduction took longer than I thought it would. I would have liked a little more kick to the mojo, so will probably chop up a whole habanero next time. Even my 3, 4 and 6 year old extremely unadventurous eaters gobbled up the pork (no mojo, of course). Served w/ some rice for the kids and grilled vegies for everyone.

Excellent! Made as directed using apricot jam. Combination of spicy and sweet was wonderful. Will make for guests.

Fabulous! I am so happy I found this. We will definately be making this in the future for company. I am thrilled we have leftovers!! We added one full habenero and extra sugar to even it out. Perfect blend of citrus, then a good spicey kick. We sampled it before adding it to the pork and it was too strong (on a spoon), but once you put it on the pork, it's perfect.

A definite keeper, I make this mojo with everything now.

Used organic apricot preserves PC brand, halved to serve our family of 3. Broiled on the broler pan at top position, took longer - roughly 6min/side then tented and let rest roughly 5 min. Served with coco rice and the Spinach salad with avocado and pear. Lookind forward to trying on the grill - great for company - would make the mojo and the glaze in advance and just bring out to serve. Didn't have habanero so used one seeded small green hot pepper - was perfect in heat and a great complement to the glaze - hot and sweet result.

Not bad, but not worth making again. Liked the glaze a lot better than the mojo (ended up tossing the mojo out).

Well worth the effort. We loved the mojo and used it on chicken as well.

we decided to have a carribean theme meal so we made this recipe with coconut rice (added mango to it)and black bean salad which we found on epicurious as well. Fantastic meal. This tenderloin was so good, everyone loved it. It was so easy to make and the smell in the house was out of this world. An incredible matching dessert was the bread pudding with sauteed peaches-so yummy. Our guests couldn't compliment enough on the meal.

Rating: 4
Outstanding recipe!! Even my picky 7 year old loved it. The mojo really compliments the dish, but needs a little longer to reduce than the amount of time suggested. If possible, use guava jelly or jam - it makes a big difference. Also, the pork tastes even better the next day!

AWESOME!! This is the best and most used cookbook I've ever had. We've made this many times and it is always wonderful. If you like this, get the book - everything we've made in it has been great.

Rating: 4
LOVE IT!! Made 1/2 the mojo and it was more than enough. I used one seeded Red Savina pepper (2x hot as a habanero); next time I will use 2. Use a meat thermometer, but go ahead and stop at 135 because center will continue to cook as it sits for the 10 mins.

Rating: 4
Excellent, excellent, excellent. The mojo was very tasty, but the glazed pork alone would have even warranted 4 forks. Although there seem to be a lot of ingredients, it was a very simple recipe. It did take awhile to cook down the mojo. An estimated time was not given in the recipe, but I cooked it at least 20-30 minutes to thicken it up. This is definetely a keeper.

Wonderful flavors and just the right amount of heat and sweet. I served with black beans and rice and grilled fruit would really round out the meal. Excellent!

Excellent! A big hit at my party. I found I had to cook it longer than the recipe stated. Also, my mojo needed a little sugar to reduce the tartness. Otherwise, perfect!

The glaze and Mojo Sauce could be used with chicken or pork chops as well. Not too hot. Mojo sauce has an asian aroma to it. My husband was not so keen on it but I thought it was excellent. I finished the Mojo off myself. I will definitely make this again.

This is possibly the best pork tenderloin recipe ever! I used cumin powder in stead of whole cumin and put in the whole habanero. You could even use more habanero if you like things spicier.

Excellent. We made the recipe as written with the exception of adding a whole habenero to the mojo. Our dinner guests loved it. We served it with rice and grilled vegetables. We'll definitely be making this again.

I rated this 4 forks because the glaze and pork tenderloin turned out wonderfully. I think maybe I'm just not a big fan of mojo as a flavor profile. I ended up stirring in the rest of the jar of guava jelly to balance the acidity fo the lime. I'm thinking that not cooking the mojo may be better...keeping it fresh.

Rating: 4
Excellent!! I was true to the recipe, except left pepper in half and removed rather than mincing. After cooking the mojo I was convinced that it would not work w/the pork. Boy, was I wrong. It is so good. I served w/plain rice and salad as I was not sure what the final flavor would be. The mojo saved the plain rice. I disagree w/the cooking time unless it is butterflied. It took more like 20 minutes to get it up to 150*. I know that's not the recommended temperature but it works for me.

Very Good. Served with corn on the cob, a crisp salad and Wente Zinfandel. Wonderful. Everyone loved it. Would certainly make this again.

My husband RAVED about this recipe, said it was his favorite pork recipe. I cut the pork into medallions and pounded them to thin them. I will make this again and again.

WOW, this was great. I halved the havanero in the sauce and removed it after cooking. The flavor was wonderful. This is a keeper for my family. I used a rasberry jam glaze as a last minute substitue and the sweet and hot was a great combination. I cannot wait to make this for a more formal dinner party.

Rating: 4
Wow, will this wake up your taste buds. I would give it 5 forks. I used 3/4 of a pepper and that was just right if you want kick, though not too hot. Also used ground cumin and an extra garlic clove. Grilled the meat in a Green Egg smoker at 300 for about 30-45 minutes to internal temp of 160. It came out tender and juicy. If the mojo is a little bitter, add 1/2 teaspoon of sugar.

This won many compliments at my sister's birthday party. The habaneros were not quite as hot as I expected and even though I added the entire pepper, the spice was not very noticable next time I would add another whole one. - The mojo sauce made more than enough for double the recipe and the leftovers went well on shrimp. . . in fact it is hard to think of a meat it would not pair well with. The glaze was lovely but next time, I will look harder for the guava jam, my recollection is that guava jam is generally less sweet than the apricot jam I used.

Rating: 3
I wonder if the sauce recipe is complete (e.g. the intro mentions vinegar and it doesn't call for any). It was good, esp. on the meat with its sweet glaze, but tasted on its own it was one-dimensionally sour (maybe my oranges weren't sweet enough). I made the sauce the day before and added the cilantro before serving. It helps to brine the pork for an hour to keep it juicy (and it takes longer than 8-9 minutes to cook a pork tenderloin, in my experience, so I ignored the cooking time here). This is a festive, yummy dish, and the ingredients are slightly exotic but easy to find. I doubled the meat for 8 people, but the amount of glaze and sauce were fine.

Rating: 4
This was fabulous and oh so easy! Be sure to match your cooking time to the size of meat you have - we had to cook it twice as long for some reason. I will cut the glaze and the mojo in half next time.

My entire family LOVED this recipe!! I did not change anything. I made 4 tenderloins (aprox 4.5 lbs) and there was plenty of glaze and mojo. I served with coconut risotto, modified from the coconut rice recipe on this site. Will make again and again.

Great recipe. Very easy and lots of flavor. My company requested the recipe. Don't skip the mojo it really adds alot of flavor and tastes fantastic. Next time I'm adding the whole habanero!

This was a huge hit for a family cookout! We had to use the apricot preserves b/c could not find the quava jelly. We are going to cook again this weekend and now have the quava jelly. Everyone is really looking forward to having this again.

Fantastic! Followed the recipe to the tee - only substitute was apricot filling for jam. Our tastebuds just tingled with the glaze and then the mojo - devine. Just the right touch of hot and sweet.

Because I live out in the country in Montana, I do have to substitute & improvise per the ingredients at hand. I made the glaze substituting apricot-pineapple jam along with my homemade hot pepper jelly. I pretty much skipped the "mojo" but added huckleberries to the glaze to top off the tenderloins. It was easy and wonderful. I served it with stuffed zuccini, fresh garden beets, cornbread and a cucumber & Celery w yogurt recipee from epi.

I have made this 3 times-the first time for me and my husband and the other 2 times for company. Everyone loved it. I do serve the mojo on the side since it can be overpowering to some. I also add a little more habernero to give it more bite. I don't know what the Middleton, CT, reviewer could mean when she says it is bitter. Sounds like user error to me.

Rating: 4
I made this for a dinner party. The sauces could be done ahead which left just the pork to be grilled. The pork was moist and flavorful. I served both the reserved glaze and the mojo as accompaniments, depending on guests' taste preferences. Will definitely make this again.

Where to start... I've made this dish twice now. Both time I used Mango Chutney instead of the guava, and both times were delicious. However the second time was for 30 people and my cooks got a little confused... the mojo went on the pork while it was cooking and the glaze was served afterwards! It was great though, even though that happened. I guess you just can't go wrong with this recipe.

Rating: 4
Simply delicious. The glaze was incredible and the pork was perfectly tender. However, I wasn't crazy about the mojo -- far too sweet. I think I probably could have reduced the juice mix a bit more.

My husband and I made the mojo for the grilled tenderloins yesterday and ended up throwing it (and the recipe) out. It was very bitter. We have a lot of experience cooking Caribbean (including Cuban) food. The "four forks" reviews that others gave this recipe mystify us. We give the recipe "one fork" ... but it really deserves "no fork."

Rating: 4
Easy, unique, and tasty. I used apricot jam. Had to skip the cumin seeds in the mojo - (where do you get the seeds?), but it was great without it. My only problem was that I couldn't seem to cook it enough - I had to throw it back on the grill 2 times - but it then turned out great! Where are the corn con queso recipes slags, the reviewer, writes of? Thanks

I made this recipe last summer after Bobby had it on his show, Boy Meets Grill. [it was on the Food Network website] It was out of this world. My guests raved. I'll make it again this summer. The corn that was featured with it is great, too.
