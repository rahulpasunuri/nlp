This dish turned out interesting and flavorful, but was off-puttingly labor-intensive. I would be interested to know the results of using precooked canned artichoke hearts- it seems that cooking the fresh 'chokes in broth was responsible for their delicious flavor in the end. Also, the recipe does not say to cut the potatoes up after peeling, but one should as the centers otherwise remain white and flavorless. Quality mussels are hard to come by here in the desert; I would enjoy this recipe just as much with chicken instead (love me some chicken).

Delicious and fairly easy. Next time I will try this with baby artichokes to save some prep time. The recipe is not well written, however. YOU MUST READ THIS RECIPE ALL THE WAY THROUGH BEFORE YOU MAKE IT! (As you always should). For example: the second paragraph starts "Bring remaining ingredients to boil..." - what they mean is the remaining ingredients in the "Artichokes" portion of the recipe. I started putting everything in one pot and realized my mistake before it was too late!

This sounded good when I read the receipe but I was extremely disappointed in the results. Especially because it was rather labor intensive doing the artichokes. I would not bother with this one.
