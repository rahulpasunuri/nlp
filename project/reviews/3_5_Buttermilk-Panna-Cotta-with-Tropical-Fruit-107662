Recipe turned out perfectly but frankly, it tasted like yogurt. Taking this into consideration I'd rather save the calories and just eat yogurt. Will not make this again.

Tasted like cheesecake! Delicious. I also made an all cream panna cotta, but I like the buttermilk version much better :)

My mom and I love this recipe! Usually we make a raspberry crush and serve w/berries. SO PRETTY! We also put plastic wrap in muffin tins or ramekins to help get panna cotta out. Admittedly, you get some wrinkles in the panna cotta - but usually not an issue. This is a light and delicious dessert.

I had guests for dinner and made this. It came perfect, despite the fact that a lot of the gelatin seemed to strain out. I served it with gold and green kiwifruit and feijoas. Personally I found the fruit too tart and acid to match the tart panna cotta, but my guests and extremely fussy husband all loved it.

The recipe worked really well, but it was pretty basic. I don't think I would make it for company again, because it wasn't very memorable.

I loved it. It was the first time I made panna cotta. Easy to make and sooo delicious, not too sweet not too tart. Although my boyfriend said he would like totaste more vanilla. I served it with kiwi, peach, mango salsa. I made everything a day before the dinner. I will definitely make this again!

I love this panna cotta recipe and have made it several times. Sometimes, I put caramelized sugar on the bottom of the ramekin before adding the custard -- in imitation of Craig Stolls at Delfina. Pretty and yummy.

This turned out perfectly: creamy but not too heavy, with just the right sweetness. I followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't dip the ramekins in hot water but only ran the knife around the edges; they released perfectly. I served it with rhubarb-strawberry compote. An easy but impressive dessert for dinner parties!

I thought this turned out really well considering what minimal effort is required. I served it with sliced blood oranges, which went very well. I was scared that it would be too sweet, but it was just the right amount of sweetness. I felt that the shape collapsed a little too, and would be tempted to add a touch more gelatin next time I make them.

So easy and fast, any tart fruit is a nice accompaniment to the smooth sweet custard. Don't leave the ramekins in hot water too long or else it will melt the custard more than necessary to turn it out.

Awesome dessert! Instead of the tropical fruit, I used sliced, fresh strawberries that were sweetened with a little sugar. Everyone loved it!

I loved the tanginess of the buttermilk in this dessert. I felt it was a very light and refreshing dessert. I followed the directions exactly and the result was perfect.

I made this for a dinner party because a couple of guests were allergic to eggs. It was wonderful! Smooth creamy texture, nice balanced tartness and sweetness. I served it with chocolate sauce and berries. It got rave reviews and was soooo easy!

Delicious. The first panna cotta I'd ever made, or eaten - beautiful, easy, and generally delightful.

alittle heavy, the one in Italy was lighter

Marvelous, smooth, but not too rich. Nice and easy to make, too. I used canned tropical fruit.

This was a beautiful, light weight dessert. It was snow white with the colorful fruit. The texture was dreamy. I made the custard the day before and it was very simple.
