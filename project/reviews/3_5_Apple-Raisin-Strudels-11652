this is the easiest strudel ever. I'm Austrian and it was very close to what I'm used to. My son's high school German class prepared this recipe tripled for an October Fest celebration, they had no cooking experience and it came out perfect! This is a keeper.

This makes an excellent strudel - very close to what I ate as a kid in Germany and Austria. If you increase the ingredients to make three strudels, you'll just about consume a whole box of phyllo (two leaves you with excess phyllo; five or so large GS apples). I also double to triple the amount if cinnamon (1T). Add 1T of lemon zest (chopped; about a lemon's worth).

This was very good! My husband gave me a 10 on a scale of 1 - 10! I added walnuts. The only thing I would change is when it says to put in a lightly buttered pan, I would try to use a cooking spray or non-stick foil next time around because the bottom of the strudel overcooked from I believe the butter. Has anyone experienced this problem? The top came out perfect but the bottom of the strudel was overcooked a bit. Also, on the directions to make the whipped cream the recipe called for 1/4 cup of sour cream but in the directions it didn't mention it. I added it anyways and it tasted good. Was this an error?

I love apple strudel and this was a great, standard recipe. Whenever I work with strudel, I only butter every other sheet, since I try to avoid extra fat. This recipe worked just fine this way. I also used a combination of crispy Macintosh and Golden Delicious apples, instead of the green apples. Again, the different varieties turned out great. Finally, I served this with vanilla ice cream. I will definately make this again!

This was really delicious! We own a Bed and Breakfast, and had bought a lot of phyllo for spanakopita for a wedding, and I was searching for a way to use it. This recipe was not difficult, but it wowed 'em!

Very easy and very DELICIOUS recipe!! I never worked with phyllo dough before and it was not that hard. It does tear, although it didn't seem to make a difference. I would add toasted pecans next time as other reviewers mentioned. Hint: to make easy cutting after it is baked, I made several "steam vent" slices in the phyllo all the way through the top layer before I put it in the oven. Made cutting very simple afterward.

This is a great basic recipe. If you have not worked with phyllo dough in the past, be warned that it is not easy to work with. I would add finely chopped walnuts to the filling next time, and I would like to try a glaze for the top of the strudel, although I have no idea how to make it. Confectioners sugar mixed with water, maybe?

Delicious apple dessert! I made this for my Mother's birthday dinner...it was definitely a hit! Warms up as per the directions perfectly. The topping is great! I would have added pecans. (My husband and I just returned from a week in Vienna, Austria - so this dessert was especially appropriate!

Fillo dough is a real pain for first-time user. Lot of problems with sheets sticking together prior to layering and brushing with butter. (is there a trick to separating the sheets?)Too much flaking of crust on top when cutting it after baking. Apple pie or cobbler is better.

So simple to make and got raves from my company

I thought the strudel was fabulous! My only comment is, what do you do with the sour cream that is listed as an ingredient for the whip cream?

EXCELLENT!!!! Wow, what a great recipe. I omitted the raisins. This resipe was such a hit. A definite do-over. The whipped cream was also amazing. I am usually a bigger fan of apple pie, but i must admit that this is both an elegant and outstanding desert, perfect with cappucino.

Very easy to make. Great for a party. I put little slits in the phyllo to let the steam out.
