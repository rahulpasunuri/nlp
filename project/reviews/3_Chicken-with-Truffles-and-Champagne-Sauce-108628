I was very dissapointed in how bland the recipe was. I had made this for a dinner party and everyone was so excited for truffles but the recipe came up with minimal taste.

If I were to make this again, I would roast the chicken instead of flouring and browning in the pan and would use more seasoning. It was a sort of bland.

OK, but far from great as the recipe sounds...Not worth fine champagne and truffles. Pretty dull.

This is 1 manifico recipe. The truffles add the delicious aroma and tastes to the vegestables. It's a keeper!! Some of the recipes I tried from this magazine is O.K. But this one is exceptional. I am actually thinking of doing this recipe again for special occassions.

A nice blend of the standard (chicken) and the not-so-standard (champagne reduction, egg yolk thickener, truffles). But, beware! It's really easy to make scrambled eggs! The cooking liquid should be cooled before being incorporated into the yolks. Classic French cooking technique would have you cool the liquid on ice (below 150 degrees F) then add the yolks then slowly bring up to temp. Also, more yolks are needed for this amount of cooking liquid. Recipe could have been written more clearly.

This was a simple, elegant and delicious dish. I didn't have truffles but I don't think it made a difference. I also used boneless, skinless chicken, which meant that I ended up searing the chicken on a higher heat than called for in the recipe and then proceeded with the steaming. And definately you need to use good champagne - with a dish this simple, you can't skimp.
