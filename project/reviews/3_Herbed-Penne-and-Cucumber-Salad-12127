Really good - got lots of compliments on the 4th of July for this! I added three stalks of celery to the salad, and a bit of dijon mustard and three crushed garlic cloves to the dressing. Definitely a keeper!

Skeptics should try variations of this recipe. Substitute Greek yogurt for buttermilk and blend with herbs on hand...basil, mint, rosemary and thyme comes out nicely.

How anyone can say this a bland and boring salad is beyond me. I made this for a barbeque and it was a hit. I found it to be bursting with a fresh herb flavor. I would make the dressing again possibly with the addition of some anchovy and garlic to drizzle over garden fresh tomatoes this summer.

Bland and boring, even with the addition of garlic, lemon and white pepper. Wouldn't make it again.

I made half the recipe of macaroni but the full recipe of dressing. I saved some of the dressing to use on another type of salad as I'm sure it would be great on a lettuce salad. Also it would be excellent on just cucumbers without the macs. I thought this was very good and will make it again.

I really did not like this salad at all and neither did most of the people who tried it. I found the mint overpowering (and I didn't even use as much as the recipe called for). I feel sure that I could improvise and make a better herbed pasta salad.

Refreshing summer fare. Added a bit of minced jalepeno to spice it up & chopped the scallions for added texture. Also, used about 3/4 buttermilk to 1/4 mayo to keep it light. Quite tasty.

I made this for an outdoor concert last night. I thought it was great but I did add a couple of extras. I added fresh lemon juice and 2 cloves of garlic. It was a hit with everyone. I will definitely make this again.

I have made this salad several times for various outdoor parties. It's easy to prepare and always a hit.

This is a great summer pasta! I have an herb garden in my backyard and I used all fresh herbs. I followed the recipe this time, but I think you can use any fresh herbs you would like. The dressing reminded me of a green goddess dressing. I halved the recipe and it still made a lot. Very fresh tasting and easy to make.

Super easy and very summery tasting. Throw almost all ingredients in food processor and you have an instant dressing. The portions seemed too much, so I halved about everything. Play with the proportions to suit your own taste. I used a lot of dill. I would watch out for the scallion whites, as they tend to be quite strong and overpowering. Be careful of the mint too, unless you really love its flavor. Otherwise, it makes a great pasta salad.
