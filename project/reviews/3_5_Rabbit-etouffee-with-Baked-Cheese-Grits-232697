This recipe was really good with with a few tweaks. Since I am from Louisiana I made it more of a traditional etouffee (sort of) by not adding the tomatoes, adding about 1/4 of a cup of flour, and adding 2 tablespoons of roux. I used the Savoie's dark roux in the jar (which is a staple in my house since it tasts just like homemade roux). I also added a little more seasoning - more onions, more bell peppers, more celery, more garlic, more carrots. IT WAS WONDERFUL!

This dish turned out absolutely wonderful. I have a really nice butcher nearby and was able to get the rabbit for this recipe and honestly I would not make it with the chicken thighs, the rabbit was so delicious. I made this for my Brother-in-laws birthday and it was a huge success. I paired it with rice since I knew ahead of time that no one liked grits. We will definitely be making this one again!

This dish was all right as written, but could use some tweaks. First of all, this is NOT etouffee. Some reviewers call it a stew, but with the amount of rendered fat in this sauce, I think it really is a Coq au Vin. That being said, it was a pretty good Coq au Vin. Second, with the proportions in the dish, it does not end up looking like the photograph, unless you leave all of the great juices in the pan. You end up with a lot of liquid, and although the cheese grits are great, I would recommend saving them for another time and cooking some great bread for sopping up the liquid. As a final aside, if you can't get rabbit, I used several quartered pheasants instead and what's great about this sauce (as Coq au Vin) is that it cuts through the gamey flavor of just about anything. I would recommend doing this with any game bird, or even venison or duck, in addition to the rabbit suggestion here.

Made this with chicken thighs, and made it 2 days before I planned to serve it. Probably helped the flavors have time to meld. We liked it a lot, and it will be perfect on a cool autumn or winter evening.

Four forks simply because it was so rich (I wish I could have given it a 3.5!) I used bone-in skin-on chicken thighs (pulled apart with a gentle fork!), which of course rendered quite a bit of fat... not a good choice for people on a limited diet. Followed the recipe exactly until the end, as I thickened the sauce just slightly. Excellent with a balanced Bordeaux.

Not bad, but unremarkable. Not worth the effort to me. Among other issues, too soupy. The grits recipe was great, though.

wonderful if made ahead, as the flavors are divine...and this way, you can defat from all the bacon (8 oz leaves a lot of fat!). but even so, I'd recommend thickening the sauce as it gets runny. made it w/bone-in, skinless chicken thighs and found that the meat pulled right off the bone after a night in the fridge. cheese grits were terrific but could have sat longer. all that and it still gets 4 forks as it all tasted divine.

Excellent. However, if one is using rabbit, I'd suggest making it a day in advance (which also allows the flavors to blend) then removing as many bones as possible. As with all rabbit braises, bones can become a problem. I served this with polenta and a mixed green salad. Very company-worthy.

An easy dish; great comfort food. Recommend using boneless, skinless chicken thighs if you don't have rabbit. I made it once with bone-in chicken thighs without the skin removed, and they rendered too much fat, even when I drained off all the bacon fat. Still, it had an awesome aroma and flavor.

This is a very good, easy, and flavorful dish. I used boneless chicken thighs rather than rabbit and followed the cooking times exactly. The chicken was fork tender and the sauce was delicious, although runny. A couple of days later, I poured the de-fatted leftover sauce over chicken breasts and rough chopped potatoes and baked for about 90 minutes at 350 degrees. Delicious.

Just finished eating the leftovers--very yummy! I'm not sure I'd call it an "etouffee", though...seems more like a French rabbit stew. The cheese grits were a lovely side with this.

The generous amount of red wine in the cooking liquid really makes this dish in terms of flavor and the incredible aroma. Use something you would drink, full bodied. Absolutely make the grits to accompany, they are a perfect match.

Made this dinner a few nights ago for my husband and he absolutely loved it!! I also substituted the rabbit with chicken thighs and the dish was amazing. Very easy to make. I also made the baked cheese grits and liked those, too, however, next time I may make brown rice instead.

Made this as a "thinking of New Orleans" dinner for my daughter who has been displaced by Hurricane Katrina and temporarily moved back to New England. As a frequent patron of Jacques-Imo's Cafe, she declared this dish the best I've made since she's left her home in New Orleans. Had to settle for chicken in place of rabbit, but otherwise followed the recipe as written, including the Baked Cheese Grits. Even my not-so-southern husband cleaned his plate and savored the grits. We'll make this again and look forward to the day when we can order it from Jacques himself!
