This isn't a great recipe for a novice, but it's absolutely rich, decadent and delicious. I followed all directions except chilling 5 days (I chilled 2 days in 'fridge then 1 day in freezer). I added a lg. pinch of kosher salt, about 3/4 tsp. of vanilla and a hefty Tbs. of instant coffee to the milk/cocoa mixture. The custard took almost 10 min. to thicken, and I stirred it constantly. I also used my Kitchenaid mixer (w/ a whisk attachment) to beat the eggs/sugar then beat on med/hi when (VERY slowly) adding the milk/cocoa/coffee mixture to avoid scrambling the eggs. It's kind of a pain but totally delivers in the end; it really is totally delicious, like a liquid brownie. I was tempted to double the recipe but, since I only have a small ice cream maker (which this recipe absolutely filled to the brim), decided not to do so. I'll make it again but only when chocolate lovers are involved.

This recipe produced fantastic texture and flavor as a textbook-perfect pot de creme, which is how the base had set up by the next day, how we were obliged (!) to enjoy it, and why we gave it 3 stars vs. 4. I used Scharffenberger 82% chocolate, a percentage slightly higher than that which was recommended - perhaps it was just enough to render it too thick to churn. I will undoubtedly make this again, experimenting with other chocolates.

To the reviewer that suggested just buying a carton of Breyer's chocolate instead - that is moronic. This ice cream bears as much resemblance to grocery store chocolate as a Hershey bar does to Domori Porcelana. For those who actually intend to make the recipe before reviewing it - this is easily the best ice cream I've ever made. I let the custard sit for two days before freezing, and the ice cream is now in the freezer to sit for three days. However, I tasted it straight from the maker and it is already amazing. Incredibly rich, with a sublime, truffle-like texture, almost like a frozen mousse. A stand-alone dessert. If you truly love chocolate, give it a try - you will not be disappointed!

it's unbelieveable how rich this ice cream is - good but I wouldn't make it again as it's just too rich. If you're a chocolate lover though this is the one to make. I really enjoyed making it as it's a very different process with the addition of the caramel.

This ice cream is out-of-this-world delicious. Made this for a party and the crowd raved that it was the best chocolate ice cream they've ever had. The addition of the caramel at the end is brilliant - adds an extra note of richness.

Made the custard mixture Monday, refrigerated for 2 days as directed, and then ran through my Cuisinart ice-cream maker. Froze for a few hours, but we were unable to follow the final instruction and wait a few days to serve. This was a wonderful rich chocolate icecream. Not too sweet and definitely worth the effort.

While the recipe is very-very good (I've seen the same or very similar many other places) the cost/time just doesn't make any sense for a simple one flavor home-made ice cream. Now if it were an exotic flavor with fruits and or nuts, it might be worth it. But as it stands, you'd be far better off and FAR cheaper just buying a 1/2 gallon of Premium Dryers or Bryers Chocolate Ice Cream. It will taste exactly the same and you'll be a lot less tired while you eat it!
