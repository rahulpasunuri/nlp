My husband and I made this last night and were REALLY impressed with how it came out. The flavor of the spices was wonderful and the contrast of the Moroccan spices with the beautiful orange honey sauce was just perfect. We made a few alterations - such as brining the hens for 36 hours before cooking them (which made them super juicy) and we did them on the rotisserie of our grill as opposed to in the oven but the flavors really were fantastic! Thanks so much for the recipe!

This spice rub was terrific and delicately permeated the carrots which made them unusually tasty. Didn't bother with the honey orange sauce, will try that next time. Great recipe for a unique,delicious, new way to make game hens! B.J. Harrick

Made this for Xmas dinner. Yum! Served it with wild rice with roasted butternut squash. Instead of the orange honey, I drizzled on some unsweetened pomegranate molasses. Great, easy recipe.

This was quite good but not fantastic, but a good solid recipe for Moroccan food. Next time I will follow the advice of others to add heat and a bit more sweetness.

This recipe is SO easy and SO tasty. I have made it 3 times now and my husband has raved about it every time. I tossed the carrots (pre- peeled baby carrots for me, save even more time) with olive oil, salt and pepper before roasting; they caramelize and are a perfect accompaniament. Tried the orange- honey sauce for the first time tonight; it is terrific but not essential for the recipe. Recipe also halves easily for two. This is my "go-to" Cornish game hen recipe!

This was fantastic! The hens were perfectly cooked, the flavors were magnificent, the carrots were to die for and the meal was one of the easiest dishes I've created. I didn't even use the orange honey sauce. I am definitely trying this at Gary Danko to compare!

The Orange-Honey Sauce is a link at the bottom of the recipe. Click on 'Orange-Honey Sauce', and you will have it.

Where is the honey in the Honey Orange sauce?

This is an excellent dish. I toasted the spices prior to grinding them. It was very easy and got rave reviews from my guests.

I've used Epicurious for years and never felt compelled to write a review until now. Living near top San Fran restaurant Gary Danko (author of this recipe) I had to try this, being a regular game hen griller and baker (beats chicken all of the time, right?. This is truly one of the best new recipes I've gathered in years. Substituted Madeira for the wine as it was all I had in the house. Everyone raved about this, even my semi-slightly sophisticated 6 and 8 year olds. Have already forwarded it to two of my expert chef friends.

This is an easy dish very good reviews from all I have prepared it for. It is very adaptable. I have substituted lamb, and chicken for the hens, and have used a wide variety of different veggies.

I have already made this dish without the sauce (instead I put the wine and OJ on the chicken and bake it) twice and both times it was delicious. The guests loved it. Try it - it is incredibly simple and a wonderful dish for company. I made it with almond rice pilaf instead of couscous.

The hens were delicious, but I cooked them an hour rather than 40 minutes because they didn't seem done, and all of the liquid cooked away. I deglazed the pan with some wine instead. I might try cooking it at 350 for 1 hour next time. Also, I only used 10 figs, and this was more than enough for two people. Since the olives I used were small, I would use more next time.

Very easy to make, very tasty, looks gorgeous, great as a left over in chicken salad. Served caroway cheese as an appetizer and with morrocan couscous.MMMmmmm

I haven't made this recipe, but accidentally stumbled onto this one looking for another on this site called "MORROCAN-STYLE ROAST CORNISH HENS WITH VEGETABLES." Try that one-it's great!!!

This has to be the worst recipe my husband and I have ever encountered! I can think of only one other thing I detest more - Vegemite! Not only did the recipe require a lot of time but the mixture of ingredients produced a very strange flavor. I would not recommend this recipe to even the bravest of cooks - and believe me I am known for my ecletic and unique culinary taste. This recipe is a disgrace to all those who share a love for Moroccan cuisine.

Where's the honey?

Add a starch and this makes a nice meal. Flavor-wise it was good but not great. The rub for the hens was better than the orange-honey sauce. If I did make this again I would strain the sauce - too many shallots.
