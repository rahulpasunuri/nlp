This was a great, easy dish to make...and the flavors were wonderful. I followed the recipe exact except that I used the canned Ortega whole green chiles. Not only did that make this recipe even easier, but I thought it tasted wonderful.

I use double the amount of canned tomatoes. One plain, and one Rotel diced tomatoes with green chiles. We love this stew with spoonbread.

Although this had a nice flavor, the appearance of it was gross. I wouldn't make again.

I was lucky enough to find Hatch chiles to use in this and it was wonderful! Spciy and easy. My husband wasn't even thru the meal before he was telling me it's a keeper.

Having an abundance of Anaheim chilis in the garden this year, this recipe could not have come at a better time. Very flavorful and simple to prepare. Our 13 year old son loved it!
