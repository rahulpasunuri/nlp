This dessert is fabulous. It is so simple and yet is always a big hit with everyone. I made it with fresh whipped cream and used some left over vanilla custard sauce (from this site) that I had. Would also be good with blue berries.

I brought this dish to a neighborhood Bingo and everyone loved it. I did not peel the peaches and I put them out on a platter with a bowl of fresh whipped cream that I added a bit of brown sugar to. It was wonderful! It's nice to have a great dish like that to share that doesn't require much time or effort!

So simple and delicious. I served it with creme fraiche, which was a nice combination. I would definitely try the other fruits the cook from Austria suggested...sounds interesting!

This is so simple and yet so wonderful! I serve it regularly over "Farina pudding with fresh fruit" (in place of the fruit suggeswted of course.) It also works well with nectarines, apricots, prunes, and plums. I want to try it with fresh figs next.

Served this for desert after a BBQ dinner--outstanding. I added 1.5 ounces of Frangelico to this. Served in crepes. Sprinkled all with sliced almonds. Then served a heaping bowl of whipped cream (cream, 2 tablespoons brown sugar, 1.5 ounces of Frangelico) and let everyone spoon on their own dollops of cream. Outstanding and a great hit!
