I used this vinaigrette on cole slaw. It is a nice change from the creamy mayo type dressings.

Jay, I'm sorry this 'soured' you on the vinaigrette...but this is really a great mix..with a good red wine vinegar. I have been looking for this recipe FOREVER! It works great for so many salads...my fave? Corkscrew pasta, red kidney beans, broccoli, red onion & this vinaigrette...totally works!

I use this recipe for marinating my tomatoes in when i get too many to eat right away from the garden and has been a huge hit with friends at dinners when served as a vegetable side dish.

goes well with the Tuscan Bean Salad as intended

I did not like this dressing at all. It is all acidity and sour flavor. It needs something to counter this. I put cranberry "raisins" in the salad - which helped a little.

It was a very good vinaigrette i added more fresh herbs such as basil chives etc and it kicked it up a bit
