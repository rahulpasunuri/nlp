Loved it! Didn't have Ancho chilis, so used chipotle with good effect. Also liked it best without the mayo.

I agree that half the sugar is better. I've also added a little bit of adobo sauce from a can of chipotles, which enhances the flavor of the sauce.

Fantastic flavor! Can be used on chicken or pork.

I used 2 dried ancho chili peppers (instead of 3 )from Frontier Spices but the sauce was too bitter and too sweet

Cut sugar in half, add additional cumin plus ground red pepper to taste. Otherwise the recipe is a bit bland.

Wonderful with the accompanying chicken recipe, but also great with mashed sweet potatoes and with scrambled eggs or southwestern style omelette.

I made this recipe exactly as directed, except that I used dried oregano and added a pinch of salt. I will make it again but cut back a bit on the sugar. It needs to sit over night to blend flavors!

Too save time, I substituted a completely drained, tiny can of Ortega Chili's. Excellent!

I too used the chipotle peppers with 3 T water and then followed the recipe as stated. It was fabulous, but had a real kick, which we loved. It would be great on all kinds of meat and poultry and would def. make again. yum!

I'd like to spice it up a bit more. I used Pablano smoked on the grill, skin and seeds removed since I couldn't find ancho peppers. I'll try it with sour cream next time and less sugar which should bring out the lime juice a bit more too.

Hate to be in the minority here, but we REALLY did not like this. It was way too sweet. Yuck. We loved the chicken it goes with though.

Loved this. I could not find Ancho Chilis so substituted three chipotle peppers in adobo sauce (just the peppers). I could have used more, we like it spicy. Next time I am going to make with sour cream instead of the mayonaise (personal preference). We made with the southwestern lime chicken (awesome) and black beans with garlic, cumin and cillantro (awesome with some changes).

The mayonaise and rosemary are a nice change up from the normal chile sauces I make. I used mexican oregano (dried) because it's floral notes go better with chiles. The gentleman from Austin TX stated that Ancho's are bitter. I cook with these chiles quite a bit and have never found them to be bitter. Even if they were, the brown sugar will off-set the bitterness. If you can find it Pincillo sugar is great. You will get a much better flavor from the chiles if you toast them over medium heat for a few seconds a side. Slit them open, remove the stem and seeds and press flat in a heavy medium hot skillet.

Thanks Austin. My husband actually loved this sauce and said it was "just me." I will try your suggestions next time.

Boston, ancho chiles can be bitter. Try New Mexico chiles, or chipotles (without the seeds).

I followed this to a tee and it tastes so strange and bitter. I think it may be the cumin is overpowering, although I am not quite sure. Any suggestions?

pretty good, made with the southwestern lime chicken, next time i try it i think i will make with half light mayo and half light sour cream or plain yogurt to cut down on the fat

Awesome. Made with the southwestern lime chicken, but I can imagine using this for fish, pork, or as a base for a salad dressing. I used chpotles, and it was quite spicey. Also soaked them whole and didn't seed them (I missed that part of the recipe) but it worked great anyway.

This, when combined with this sites Maple Chipotle Glazed Corn and Southwestern Lime Chicken, becomes a fantastic meal. I do not go through the step of pouring boiling water over the ancho, for the sauce. I just grind them up in a coffee grinder. All recipes are keepers!

This was incredible! I used three chipotle peppers mixed with 3 tbsp. of water, then added the rest of ingredients to 1/2 the chipotle mixture. This way I was able to control the heat. Chipotles are very hot, and although we love heat, sometimes they can get in the way of the taste of the food. I ended up using about 3/4 of the chipotle mixture and it was terrific! I'm using it again tonight on a marinated pork tenderloin!

My family flipped for this. This has a slow burn with a kick late in the palate - a perfect combo of sweet, tangy & spicy; sure to get your palate dancing! Probably not appropriate to serve to kids; too hot - but this sauce will kick flavor into just about any chicken or tofu dish you can come up with!

I agree with Hamilton. This stuff is fab! I didn't have fresh herbs and subbed dried (ground rosemary in coffee grinder) and used ground hot New Mexico chili. This weekend I'm going to make use it as salad dressing for a southwestern style salad. Yum, yum. I think I'll need to just keep a batch in the fridge at all times. This is going on my list of The-best-of-the-best.

I make this sauce frequently. There are times I crave this sauce! While it's perfect with the marinated chicken, it is so delicious that I put it on just about anything! If I had been the genius who created this recipe, I'd bottle it and sell it--it would be a goldmine! Gour-Mayo, shmayo!

Made this twice already and I always get rave reviews! Used chipotles in adobo sauce instead of ancho chili's and it turned out great. I only used 3 tbls. plain water as a substitute for the soaking liquid and it was fine.

Delightful dish, was well received at our dinner party. It is deliciously spicy without being overwhelming. I substituted pepperjack cheese for monterrey jack for added flair. This recipe is a definite keeper.

I made the ancho chile sauce before and only my daughter loved it. She begged for it again, so I made it for her, and also the variation suggested with the chipoltes in adobo sauce (I did not include the sauce, just the peppers). We had both sauces at the same time. We all loved the chipolte version better. The flavor is not bitter like the anchos, but spicier. I served it with grilled chicken and salad, the chipolte sauce was so good we used it on the salad too.

I used chipotle chiles in adobo sauce instead of anchos, and it turned out delicious! You could use this sauce for a multitude of things, on sandwiches, as a salad dressing!

I might use this with another dish (simple grilled chicken) but, be forwarned.. It packs a TON of flavor ...consider using lightly. I made it to the tee (including Mexican ancho peppers and all fresh herbs) and found it overwhelming!

wow...this is tasty... made it with the southwestern lime chicken and boy was it yummy... put some of the left-over sauce on turkey sandwiches...great twist to mayonaise.... used jalepeno peppers in place and tasted just as good...will make again

This sauce was so easy and fantastic. Ancho chilies are not easy to come by in Toronto, so I substituted Chipotles in Adobe sauce...absolutely wonderful.

This sauce is AMAZING! Everyone wanted to take some home to put on sandwiches. Made it with the chicken recipe, but it is good on just plain grilled chicken breasts too!

This was the best sauce for chicken I have ever had. It makes the chicken really juicy and yummy. I highly recommend it!

Love it! The spicy-sweetness is a wonderful balance. I used serrano peppers once, and red poblanos the next time. Wonderful both ways. Big hit with the family.

I don't like mayonnaise but I Loooooved this sauce. It was especially a hit with "Baby" John who likes things on the spicy side! The sauce went well with the chicken as well as the yellow rice, black beans, and green peas served on the side. Great on sandwiches too!

I made this sauce with the accompanying Southwestern lime chicken. Personaly I thought it tasted too "Mayonaisey", however my roomate absolutely loved it, I would make it again, but probaly with more peppers and less mayo

great recipe, easy to make. I used dried chipolte chile instead of ancho and the sauce was wonderful.

Wonderful with southwestern lime chicken. We had a buffet and the guests insisted on bringing more sauce to the table. It was definitely a hit. Used the ancho chilies, but would also like to try it with chipoltes. The color of the sauce and the chicken was a beautiful orange-red.

What a great surprise! The first time I made it with canned diced jalapeno peppers and the sauce had a sweet spicy finish. The second time I made it with the anchco and a much earthier spicy follow through on the palette. To save time the jalapeno is an adequate twist.
