This is pasta in it's very subtle form. Not for those looking for a red sauce with--all of the red sauce ingredients. Not to say the red sauce is offense. It's one of my favorites. But this is subtle, lovely, reminds me of lazy days in the back yard on a hot day remiscent of a hot evening in Tuscany.

Wow... I was very excited to try this recipe after reading it and all the reviews. Other than doubling it, I followed it to the "t". I found this very bland and my usually enthusiastic pasta-eating family was underwhelmed.

I substituted penne pasta for the linguine, in part because I was serving 18 the first time I made it. It was still great. Had even people who never heard of broccoli rabe before raving. But it's not as fast as some reviewers would lead you to believe.

This was a great, fast and easy recipe. Made it with a vegetarian friend and left out bacon--it was still very good

Excellent! Would make again in a New York minute. Which is about what it took!

I love this recipe! I have been making it since it was in the magazine in 1992. It's quick and easy. It's comfort food.

WOW! Great flavor, colorful presentation, very easy. I love lemon so I doubled the zest and juice. I will definitely keep this as a favorite!

I think this is a good recipe. I made it and added pecorino romano cheese at the end when I sprinkled the bacon-it seemed to add an extra level of flavor. It had a fresh and new taste!

My family loved this! My husband and I love broccoli rabe, and are always looking for new ways to prepare it. Adding the onion, bacon and lemon made the broccoli rabe (which can be bitter) palatable for the kids. (We add a little bit of extra bacon for the kids!) This recipe has become a regular, and I have passed it on to other family members.

Very easy and very good. I bumped up the lemon juice and zest and served with lots of fresh parmesan. Served with mixed greens/goat cheese/candied almonds.

The lemon peel and smoky bacon were nice counterpoints to the bitter flavor of broccoli rabe.

I used broccoli florets in the dish. My husband and I found it very tasty, if a bit dry. I increased the amount of bacon, but still didn't get 2 tbs, so I think I would want to add something to make more of a "sauce". I also used a lemon thyme angel hair pasta which completimented the flavor nicely. We'll definitly try it again.

Easy to make recipe. If there is no rabe at the grocery store, I will use broccoli crowns. I tried to use olive oil once instead of the bacon fat, did not taste nearly as good. Try it with whole wheat pasta for a colorful presentation.
