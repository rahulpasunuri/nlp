I have been making this recipe for years and it is by far the easiest and best turkey recipe. I would not dream of using another recipe.

This has been my go-to turkey recipe for the last 3 years and it always comes out perfectly with rave rerviews. It is rare that the easiest cooking method delivers the best results, but this is one of those cases. I think roasting the bird upside down for the first hour on a V-rack is crucial for even cooking - the dark meat ends up is fully cooked while the white meat remains moist and tasty. I use a fresh free range turkey and do not brine - no need. I find using a meat thermometer to know when it is done works every time. I will never go back to the slow roast method!

I've been using this method for years, and it's always a perfect turkey! I use a different gravy recipe, but I love how quickly this turkey is done. No need to get up at 6am!

I first saw Natalie Dupree do this approximately 10-12 years ago and I have been making my turkey this way every since, it is the moistest turkey I have ever made. I use think my mother had a special touch, but you can do this turkey in any oven, I have done it both gas and electric and the results are always the same. This version allows me to make two 12 pound turkeys for my family in the time it would normally take me to make one 16 pound bird. Thanks Natalie.

Moistest turkey I've ever made! We don't usually have turkey because we find it dry, but by using the V-rack and turning it, the turkey came out perfect. You really have to watch the water level though as my pan drippings burned. Next time I will not add the vegetables and garlic until after I turn the turkey. My new favourite way to roast a turkey!

This recipe saved Thanksgiving for me!! I wasn't going to try it but when I ran out of time to spare I gave it a go! My parents said it was the best turkey they have ever had. I made a chimchurri sauce with fresh sage, rosemary, thyme and olive oil in the food processor and loosened the skin over the breast and spread it. Then I rubbed the entire turkey with the sauce. I also brined my turkey for 18 hours before I cooked it. I stuffed the bird with one large onion and some more herbs. It was great!! The skin was crispy and the breast came out moist. It took 2 hours in my convection oven! I can see where a convection oven would be necessary to achieve even cooking. I will definitely be making this year after year!!

I tried this on Thanksgiving and was very disappointed. Yes the bird was moist but it did not cook evenly at all. It's a great idea and might work with a convection oven but I think I'm going back to getting up at 6:00 a.m. and putting the bird in!

I strongly suggest cooking the bird breast side down for the first hour, it comes out much juicier. If the skin becomes too brown you can tent that area temporarily. To avoid the skin sticking to the pan, line the bottom of the pan with celery sticks. This will not only give it flavor, but you will avoid the sticking problem. To flip the bird, just slide the bird towards a corner of the roasting pan and, using a couple of forks or prongs without actually piercing the bird, flip it--you don't even have to lift it up. I managed to anchor one fork under a wing and it flipped right over. Just watch out for the hot juices--I flipped it away from me.

I have a whole new outlook on all of my future Thanksgivings, what a wonderful recipe. The turkey is super moist and the skin nice and crispy. My mom and grandma are going to be using the same recipe next year.

This recipe was awesome! I made my first Thanksgiving meal for my new husband and I and this was the cornerstone recipe. I took the reviewer's advice and started the bird upside down. Our turkey was packaged with the wire around the legs to keep them down. I just used that and the carving fork to flip it when it was ready. It was really easy and came out sooo good. Crispy golden skin and super moist breast meat...14lb bird cooked in less than two hours.

I've been roasting chickens on high heat for years but never thought to try it with turkey before. MUCH better than the standard slow roasted bird. Only negative was that the skin on the breast meat tore when I flipped it breast side up, which meant for a less than stunning presentation. Since I'm a big fan of stuffing, I made my usual chestnut-cranberry sage cornbread stuffing but used previously rendered and stored chicken fat instead of butter and used turkey broth. I stuffed a sugar pie pumpkin, which had been cleaned, and roasted it for about 90 minutes. I had a wonderful rich flavorful stuffing to go along with the bird.

I used a 15 pound turkey and roasted it for about 2 1/2 hrs. I didn't baste it, but it still turned out moist.

I have been using this recipe for the last few years and strongly recommend it. It's an excellent recipe, can't go wrong with this one. It's very easy and quick. Definitely choose fresh over frozen bird. Taste way better.

I've made this turkey three years in a row with flawless results. Last year my (very traditional) aunt and I had a little competition, cooking one bird "her way" (4 or 5 hours) and the other bird with this recipe, and the family voted mine the unanimous winner. This year we did two, both my way! I've always cooked it breast side down first and flipped it halfway. And the rosemary is absolutely vital. I even used a rosemary stem instead of a skewer to keep the neck end pinned shut.

I LOVED roasting the bird fast. This year I didn't spice it at all, just stuffed sweet onion in the cavity. No brining, no oiling. no buttering it up, no spices, no salt, no pepper. I used a fresh bird, farm raised with only vegetable feed and no hormones. I am convinced that buying fresh birds makes a huge difference. I had the bird breast down for an hour and a half and breast up the last half hour. It was lovely and my guests raved that it was delicious. Nothing simpler than this. It will be my turkey from now on....

Very easy to make and delicious! I made this bird for my boyfriend and I at our little thanksgiving dinner. I used the garlic and onion that I stuffed in the turkey for garlic and onion mashed potatoes. Highly recommended!

I made this bird for my boyfriend and I. It turned out great! I used the onions and garlic that I stuffed in the cavity for delicious garlic and onion mashed potatoes. Also, I sprinkled some oregano and red pepper on the turkey when I took it out after the first hour. Overall, very happy with this dish!

The best, easiest way to cook a turkey in record time. I made it for our office Thanksgiving lunch - stuck it in the oven (pre-heated by a colleague who arrives at 8:30!) at 9 a.m. and we sat down to eat at noon.

So easy and so good. We started breast side down on a rack and turned the bird 1/2 way through. Moist and beautifully browned all over. We used a 14 # bird and stuffed it with fresh rosemary, onions and garlic. We will do it again for sure.

I've been cooking turkeys with this method for many years. It's the easiest and most reliable way to roast a whole bird. You can actually serve a turkey that people are delighted to find flavorful and moist. Another fantastic tip is to place a thin (no more than an inch thick) moist layer of bread stuffing between the skin and the breast meat. Do NOT stuff the cavity of the bird. Roast it breast side down until almost done, then flip it and brown up the breast side. Flawless!!!

I used a butterball turkey and the results were wonderful - moist and flavourful! I will definitely be cooking my turkey like this again. Thanks for the great recipe.

I have been making my turkeys this way for the last 10 years since I saw Natalie do it on PBS. The recipe that I got and used for years from Julia was making two 12 pound turkeys for a large family. This method makes the most juicy, crispy and delicious turkeys imaginable. I don't know about anyone else, but I am grateful because my oven is not held up for 5-6 hours and can be used for side dishes and desserts. The only thing I do different is I make a bed of whole heads of garlic, carrots, onions, celery and sprinkle with a fresh herbs, sage, rosemary, thyme.

My turkeys have never been good - UNTIL THIS RECIPE. It was fantastic. I only made 2 changes... stuck some butter and crushed garlic cloves under the skin, and roasted it upside down for the first hour. (I don't think it was necessary.) Extremely moist and flavorful. It was a hit with my in-laws! :)

This is a fool proof recipe. I am not a cook and made this for Thxgiving and it came out perfect. I added turkey broth and mushroom broth to the gravy recipe and it was great.

Unbelieveable! 14 pound turkey in precisely 2 hours - so much for ever getting up early to get the turkey in the oven. The ONLY negative was that the meat was slightly stringy, but it was still very moist and flavorful.

This Turkey was the best I've ever made. We used a 13-lb fresh turkey and it needed to be cooked 2 hours and 30 minutes - the dark meat needed more cooking time so I recommend removing the breasts after 2 hours and cooking the dark meat an additional 30 minutes. I recommend using the rosemary as it added just the right flavor to the meat and was not overpowering.

I'll never make a turkey any other method since this worked so brilliantly! An almost 15lb. turkey took three hours and came out perfectly. I would strongly recommend getting an oven thermometer AND a meat thermometer instead of relying on the pop-ups.

Big success! Spread butter/salt/pepper/fresh rosemary under breast skin and roasted the turkey breast side down for the first hour. Delicious!

Good recipe, BUT the bottom line is what KIND of turkey? IMHO get an ORGANIC turkey for best flavor and no chemical additives. I DARE anyone to this year roast 2 turkeys, one organic and the other not and taste-test them side by side but better yet, do an honest search to see what they are ingesting in the Butterball types. I used to think that stuff was okay since it was FDA approved.

TERRIFIC- I made this turkey last year (It was my first Thanksgiving turkey), and it was superb. I will definitely make it again.

I made this recipe this summer for a large party. Instead of making the gravy, I carved the turkey and put it back in the juices. I served it warm with buns for sandwiches. Everyone raved about the turkey. The great thing about this was I was able to make it in advance and freeze it. It reheated very nicely. I will have to try this recipe the original way and make the gravy.

Very easy and very moist. The turkey was beautifully browned at the end of hours for just under 12 lbs. Will definitely use again

Didn't believe it, but yes, 12.5lbs in 2 hrs! Color was beautiful. Only problem was the drippings kept burning, causing the apt to get smokey. Kept adding broth to the pan, although my pan was only 2in bigger around than my turkey. I will always use this recipe in the future.

The turkey was very simple to prepare. When it emerged from the oven, the flesh was tender and juicy. Perfect. However, my 14-pound bird took closer to three hours! It was worth the wait.

This was a wonderfully easy turkey to make, and absolutely the most beautifully browned one we have ever done! It did take almost 2 1/2 hours in my oven, though. The gravy was perfect, even without the cream. Yum!!
