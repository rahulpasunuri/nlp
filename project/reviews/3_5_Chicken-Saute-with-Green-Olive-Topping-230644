This has a lot of wonderful flavors. I made the following changes: I used olive salad, instead of just green olives, boneless skinless chicken thighs instead of breast halves, black pepper instead of salt and added 1/2 cup of chicken stock to the sauce as it was sauteing. Served with shell pasta and green beans.

I followed the recipe exactly. It wasn't bad, it wasn't good. It was bland and the flavors didn't really meld. No one raved about it, no one spit it out either. I would be inclined to try something else rather than make this again.

I thought this was a tasty variation on the same old chicken breasts. He didn't like it so guess it won't be on our table again.

I thought this was really good. I made it for my husband and mom, and both had compliments. My mom also asked for the recipe. I will make this again.

Delicious! My husband loved it too. Will definitely make this again, next time doubling the amount of topping.

I added some curry powder and fresh chopped parsley directly onto the chicken.

Love this dish, but only made it the first time with the recommended amount of cayenne/cumin. I've cut the amount of spice way down since then, in order to be able to taste the chicken. The chicken and topping is super yummy, but quite hot/spicy - the tabouleh as a side is an excellent recommendation. You definitely want something cool to go with this dish!

Very tasty, easy and fresh. Lose the extra fat and just put the topping from the food processor on the chicken. Makes the presentation suffer, but the taste is better.

Very easy and yummy. I think I'd like to try it with fish next. This recipe is a keeper!

This was ok. Good for weeknight time crunch dinner, but nothing special.

Very quick and easy to prepare. Olive topping was flavorful, and the chicken came out tender and juicy. I thought 1&1/2 tablespoons was a little too much cumin, but otherwise this one's a winner.

This is a keeper. Its a great spice to just have on hand. Make the next time very easy to make.

This dish is amazing!! 4+++++++ stars!! If you like green olives then you will LOVE this recipe! It's so simple to make and incredibly tasteful. I added extra olives and lemon peel. You can't go wrong! The cumin/red pepper makes it spicy and so delicious. I highly recommend this. If you make for guest, just make sure they like green olives (a lot of people don't).

The first time I tried to make this recipe,my chicken was spoiled, so I decided to substitute fresh tuna steaks. FANTASTIC! I made it with tuna 3 more times and would rate it 4+ forks. When I finally got around to using chicken, I was not as pleased as with the tuna. It is tasty enough, but better using tuna.

Too many cooks in the kitchen. Or maybe it was the wine, but we forgot the garlic and still this dish was fantastic. Easy to make! Can't wait to try it again WITH the garlic!

Made this almost exactly as indicated...just didn't have fresh parsley so used that new McCormicks parsley paste in a tube. (Won't buy that again, the chili one is good, but parsley needs to be fresh!) It didn't hurt the recipe; my husband and I both loved it. The topping is fabulous, I wouldn't make this chicken without it. I, too, deglazed with a little white wine before adding the olive mixture. I had the leftovers for lunch the next day, and it was fab all over again. Keeping this one!

This receipe has so many wonderful flavors and is delicious with or without the olive topping. My guests savored it and for the first time, I didn't have any leftovers! Truly wonderful.

This was great! The chicken was very nicely spiced, and the olive topping was delicious. Before adding the olive mixture to the pan, I deglazed with a little white wine. I thought it was very, very good.

My husband and I just loved this. The chicken itself was perfect--golden brown and juicy. The olive topping gave it great flavor. If you love olives, you will love this recipe. It's quick, easy, and yummy. I served this with the recomended sides, and it was a great meal.
