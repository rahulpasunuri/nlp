Wow! I shy away from labor intensive recipes but I had frozen gefilte fish loaves that I needed to use. I defrosted them, squeezed a lemon per loaf, added 1 tsp black pepper, and 1 tbs dill, and chopped in two spring onions. I did add in oatmeal flour (about 4 tbs for my gluten free guests) and followed the rest. It was excellent! The added lemon and herbs cut the sweet taste of the loaf and the steamed method worked beautifully. I used four loaves for 40 people. Easy, delicious, and different.

I made a slightly modified version of this recipe based on prior comments and it was fantastic. Here are the changes I made: - equal parts white fish/smoked fish - did not soak matzo meal; added it directly to the processor but added some kosher chicken stock to the processor so that the mixturewould not be too dry - added some taragon to the mixture for flavor - baked the quenelles in the over instead of boiling them since it was easier; it still turned out great

This was a wonderful recipe for last Rosh Hashanah, and I'm making it again this year. I wrap them (as Wolfgang Puck does with his gefilte fish) in the cabbage leaves (which I soften by par-boiling). On the leaf I put a layer of horseradish before wrapping up the fish. Then I cook it for about an hour or until it seems done. Presentation: wrapped fish, two thin slices of lemon, slightly cooked baby carrot, sauce.

After reading all the reviews, I am sticking to my grandmother's recipe from Latvia which everyone loves. The only thing I'm taking away is the sauce; it sounds pretty good.

I love the idea of this recipe -- it instantly got me at "smoked whitefish", "scallions", and "lemon juice". Who knew??? I have made the basic recipe more than half a dozen times, always with great success. However, I prepare the ingredients the old-fashioned way: quenelles of fish in fish stock, and never even went near the cabbage- steaming method (also added the matzo meal directly to the chopped fish -- forget this matzo meal- standing-in- water deal, which would make the fish too soft). The taste is lovely, and unusual. Like another reader, I added more smoked whitefish. As well, I don't use carrots, as I add them to a traditional recipe, which I make at the same time. You can then present your guests with TWO kinds of Gefilte Fish: one traditional sweet, with carrots, the (pale orange) platter garnished with carrot curls, and served with beet horseradish -- the other tangier, fish flecked with green, (pale green) platter decorated with scallion brushes, and paper-thin slices of a halved lemon, and served with the white horseradish sauce. BEAUTIFUL on a buffet! and everyone will ask you for the recipe!!!

I have not tried this recipe yet. The ingredients mesh with my mother/(grandmother from Russia)'s recipe except the cabbage leaves. The cooking method, however is very different. All the ingredients, especially the fish were chopped by hand in a large wooden bowl with a hand chopper. The fish balls were then dropped into a pot of boiling water with cut up carrots. The boiling water was allowed to boil down and formed a fish aspic when refrigerated with the fish. My grandfather ground the horseradish by hand on the back porch.

I haven't tried this recipe, but would like to offer a suggestion for all those cooks struggling to peel the cabbage leaves. If you put the raw cabbage in the freezer for a day or two, the leaves get wilted and peel right off. I do this when I make stuffed cabbage and it works like a charm without affecting the flavor.

This is a passover staple. Last year I didn't have time to deal with the whole steaming and cabbage leaf process so I followed instructions from the Halibut gefilte fish recipe on this site and baked this recipe in a bundt pan. It cut a huge amount of time out of the process and made a much nicer presentation. I will never use the steamer and cabbage leaves again.

This gefilte fish was very good. I read the other comments before cooking and indeed, had to add more matzoh meal to make the mixture hard enough to form into shapes. I cooked and steamed the fish the day before the seder, so by the day of, the kitchen didn't smell of fish as much as it did of brisket and matzoh ball soup. The day I cooked the gefilte fish, the house was smelly, but if you make it the day before, problem solved. I didn't have a vegetable steamer, so I improvised with a colander over a pot of several inches of boiling water. This worked fine -- although had to have several of these running at once, and make the fish in batches, but it worked out fine. The fish was not raw inside as other commenters noted. I will make this again next year although I think I'll add a higher ratio of smoked white fish to sole, as the smoked fish taste is so delicate it gets lost in the mixture.

I haven't made this one yet but am going to. After reading some of the reviews, I had an idea that might help. It seems that some have trouble with the cabbage. Why not try what I do for stuffed cabbage... freeze the cabbage for 2 days, then let it defrost. The leaves are very pliable and easy to work with. Plus it cuts out a whole step in the process.

I think the "excellent" cook from New York is a bit over the top with her/his criticisms. As a cook, one should know that no recipe is set in stone. You improvise and do what works for your own palate. So I as well followed the recipe to the exact tee with the exception of using a smoked salmon instead of a smoked whitefish. The salmon was an excellent choice - thanks to another reviewer's suggestion. As for my first batch of gefilte fish that I steamed, it was also too soft and did not hold its shape. So I then added more matzo meal, kosher salt and pepper to the fish mixture. I basically eyeballed the measurements until the mixture was drier and dough-like. If i had to guess I think I may have put another cup of matzo meal. As for the cooks that are having a hard time peeling cabbage and layering them in a steamer..I really don't know what to say except maybe you should take some basic lessons at a cooking school. It really is like peeling an orange. This was a fantastic recipe and I highly recommend it. Super tasty. I already have 2 guests from the Seder dinner asking for the recipe and I can't wait to make it again next year.

I followed this recipe exactly and I am an excellent cook. I uaually make my own gefilte fish from scratch and thought this might be nice for a change. It used too many appliances and pots and had too many steps and was messy. The mixture didn't hold its shape, the cabbage couldn't be flattened, it was hard to manipulate the layers of cabbage but the worst thing about this recipe is how it tasted, smelled and looked. I wound up tossing it out and making my regular gefilte fish recipe. This recipe I wouldn't feed to a cat. The sauce, however, works on roast beef sandwiches. It seems the people who liked it liked it with trout so maybe it is better that way but this was so bad I don't think I can eat smoked whitefish anymore either. If a dish can be "NO FORKS" this would be it.

I've made this dish twice to rave reviews, using smoked trout instead of whitefish as it's more readily available. I think the reviewer who complained about it stinking up her house may scare off others who would otherwise try this wonderful interpretation of an old classic. There's no way the store-bought stuff or frozen log comes close - my sister-in-law uses that at her Seder and it's inedible but for the horseradish masking its taste.

I wanted everything to be from scratch this year at passover, so I made this gefilte fish. Never again! It stunk up my house something awful. The cabbage leaves are not as pliable as I'd like them to be (steamed first, they would have worked better), so I had odd-shaped balls. They tasted fine, but not so great that I'd do all that work again. Buy the frozen log of gefilte fish, it's just as good and no hassle!

After trying a small batch of this on husband and self in early April, I prepared the full version two days before Passover. As in trial mode, I used smoked trout instead of the whitefish, as I prefer the flavor. Also, I made the dumplings larger - a heaping 1/3 cup of the mixture - to serve one hearty piece to each of our 15 guests, and steamed for an extra five minutes to cook through. After struggling with savoy cabbage leaves the first time around, also found that Napa cabbage was easier to work with as a bed for the the steaming process. This was a resounding success - gefilte fish that looked and tasted lovely, on a bed of mesclun garnished with grape tomatoes and draped with the sauce. My son's gentile friend even remarked "you'd never know it was fish!" Will definitely make this an annual endeavor - well worth the effort.

This was delicious, and relatively easy to make. Even my non-Jewish friends liked it(!). However, my father -- who is a big fan of traditional gefilte fish -- found it a little too unorthodox for his taste on Passover. Next time I make this, I will try reducing the amount of smoked fish by half and replacing it with regular fish.

After 33 years of trying to make gefilte fish everyone would love, this recipe did it. The three professional chefs at the table raved about it. A keeper. I would not process it as heavily so it has a little more texture. The sauce was good, but some preferred traditional horseradish.

Served this at our Passover Seder last night and everyone loved it. Comments were that it was nice to have gefilte fish without the jelly that normally acompanies the jarred stuff. Two things that make this recipe exceptional - the smoked fish which adds wonderful flavor, and the sauce. I did add chopped fresh dill to the sauce and used the extra hot horseradish since it was being diluted with mayonaise. This was my first attempt at making gefilte fish and I will make it again although probably not for at least another year since it was a lot of work; a true labor of love.

This is absolutely the best gefilte fish I've had since my grandmother's, and certainly far easier than the ordeal she went through with fish heads and bones and broth. I made a 1/3 trial batch of just 8 yesterday, in advance of our Passover Seder, using a combination of fresh cod and smoked trout, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly. The sauce is something I've used before with crabcakes - very nice change of pace from simply horseradish, although the traditionalists in my family might prefer just the hot stuff. Can't way to spring this on them in two weeks! I think even those who don't like gefilte fish will have a change of heart about this new version.

Great recipe! Loved by both the adults and the kids! I used smoked salmon instead of smoked whitefish. I did not make the sauce but didn't miss it. I plated them with watercress underneath. Making them 2 days ahead worked great. One reminder, though. Keep the exhaust fan going. The steaming fish + cabbage is stinky!!!!!

I made a "test" batch of half the recipe to try out before our Passover Seder. It was really excellent. It's possible that halving the recipe had an effect, but I next time, I'll add a touch more salt, and I will puree the fish a bit less so that it has a more interesting texture. I'm also going to garnish it with some chopped green onion on top to give it a bit more colour. I also used a bamboo steamer. If the cabbage leaves are too small, or tear when you remove them from the head, just overlap them.

Although I'm not a gefilte fish fan, family tradition requires gefilte fish at all of our holiday meals. The closure of our favourite local bakery meant I had the choice of shlepping all over the city, serving that horrible tinned stuff, or try to make it myself. With Passover around the corner I tried it for a Shabbat dinner. This was very easy to make and came out wonderfully. You can clearly taste the smoked whitefish and the texture is fantastic. Everyone raved about it -especially the horseradish sauce (which kind of threw the traditionalists a bit!). I made the puree the night before, and steamed everything the next day. I steamed the gefilte fish in a stack of bamboo steamers over a wok -very multicultural and very easy. The hardest thing was unpeeling the too small cabage to lay under and over the fish! I obviously know nothing about cabbage -is there a trick to this? I think I'm going to need to learn because my next experiment is going to be cabbage rolls :)

The extraordinary amount of work it took to make these gefilte fish was worth it! Even guests who "hate" gefilte fish loved this dish. The sauce was wonderful also. From now on, I'll be bringing the gefilte fish to passover dinner.

I made these for Passover for my husband's family. They were so delicious that I made them for my family for Easter Sunday! The fishcakes are light and tasty and the horseradish sauce is to die for! I very rarely give 4 forks to a recipe but this one really deserves it -- it is an excellent dish.
