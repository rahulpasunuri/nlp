This was ok....not great, just ok. The crust was interesting, but filling was, well, boring! Had to tweek it to make it into something much tastier. Won't bother to save this recipe.

Very good with a few modifications: I add 1/2 tsp ground ginger to the crust. I prepare the filling in the blender and add 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice (or nutmeg) for more flavor, and an extra 1/2 tsp vanilla instead of the rum. The recipe makes about 1.5 times the amount of filling you actually need. As for the sugar, I find that adding the water a little at a time and stirring continually keeps it from hardening. Delicious pie, will definitely be making it during this holiday season!

I look forward to Thanksgiving just to make this pie, and then I hesitate to put it out for guests because it is so good leftover. -- I have been making this for several years now, and in previous years I used a non-stick skillet to caramelize the sugar. This year I used an All-Clad stainless skillet and couldn't believe how much more quickly the process was completed. I also used homemade gingersnaps (Cooks Illustrated recipe November-December 2011), and the crust was even better than usual. I love this pie!! The flavors are subtle yet delicious, and it is light and healthy.

this recipe is wonderful! not too sweet, excellent crust, and a crowd pleaser every time. i have made it every year for thanksgiving, and a few times in between for other occasions. my grandmother is diabetic, but she insists on having a little sliver every year.

I made this pie for Halloween and I'm going to make it again for Thanksgiving -- it's yummy and easy to eat even when you've alredy overdone it with the food!! I also don't understand other reviewers problems with the carmelized sugar process. What's so hard about letting sugar melt, turn brown, and then pouring water on it? The carmelized sugar makes the filling -- the slightly burned, "brulee" flavor is a perfect complement to the sweet potatoes. I think the crust is best handled after the initial baking, also, to stretch it to the edges of the pie plate. After you bake it for 6 minutes, as the recipe says, it all slides down to the middle anyway. I smushed it up the sides with a spoon as it cooled, and it hardened into place nicely. It's easy enough to make, and it's going in my recipe box.

This pie is fantastic! After reading other reviews on the daunting sugar process, I used 1/4 cup Lyles's Golden Syrup. The flavor was excellent with minimal effort or headache on my part! The crust is really delicious too.

SO good! I had never made or tasted a sweet potato pie before this one, and now I can't wait for more! (Incidently, I did make it a 2nd time with what the store CLAIMED were sweet potatoes, I should have trusted my instincts because yam pie is no where near as tasty...)

this pie was delicious! We did the caramel, not that hard, and did increase the crust a little. Serve with lots of whipped cream, heavenly!!

Have to admit that I missed the instruction to carmelize the sugar so added a tablespoon of molasses to the mixture. Got rave reviews from all!

This got rave reviews two years in a row, even though I botched the carmelization part both times. It gets hard as soon as you add it to the filling!

I was a little put off by the carmelizing step in here and all the past reviews about the filling, so i only made this crust and used a filling recipe from Paula Dean on food network. It turned out great, her filling took a while to cook so the crust got a little browned, but it looked just like the picture and had a fantastic texture with the pecan and cookie chunks.

I made this dish in Nov 2005. I am making it again this year. I got a lot of raves from it. I was challenged by the carmelization of the sugar. I just tried a few times until I got it. Wonderful pie. My mom loved it.

The best sweet-potato pie I have tried.

This just did not taste good at all. Everyone believes I am a good cook and seem to enjoy the meals I prepare but no one liked this recipe. My sugar addicted husband ate one tiny slice then told me to throw it out. Just not a good recipe at all !!

I used yams and light rum. Aside from the carmelizing the sugar, this is a VERY easy recipe. Use the food processor in the order: cookies, pecans, and then filling. Use the pot in the order: pecans and then butter. It goes very quickly with little to clean. This is a very good pie. It is much lighter (healthier tasting) than pumpkin. The pecans round out the ginger snaps very well. Because it tastes great, looks great, and is easy, I'd definitely make it again.

I'm not sure if I would make this again. It was fun to make, and the result was good, but not outstanding. Maybe it's just not my style. I definitely felt that the rum flavor was too strong. The crust is delicious, though!

The crust was great but I think I must have made a mistake on the filling or the carmelizing. It wasn't that great and didn't look anything like the picture.

Excellent, and I didn't find the carmelization to be a pain, although could approximate the flavour by simply using muscovado (dark brown) sugar. No rum, so added more pure vanilla extract, and used a dash of allspice and nutmeg in addition to cinnamon. Fantastic and addictive, makes a wonderful breakfast too!

the crust was fantastic and easy. but the pie filling wasn't all that great. it was good, but nothing spectacular. to make it better, i topped it with lot of cream whipped with rum. next time i'll try a different filling with this crust.

The BEST - just became our family favorite - however, like others, the carmelizing is too big a pain for the results. Use alternates ie:corn syrup, sugar, etc. I used fat free half/half

The crust is a keeper, and easy to make. The filling was way too much work for the mediocre taste, it wasn't sweet enough. I doubled the recipe, which was too much for my food processor and things got messy. I may try the crust with a pumpkin filling:)

I don't quite understand the complaints about the crust, because I found the crust to be very easy to do (with a food processor to crush everything), and the proportions were right. The carmelizing step, though, was totally unnecessary, difficult and time consuming, and I usually don't mind time consuming recipes. I'll definitely make this recipe again, because people raved about it, but I'll substitute corn syrup for the caramel step, and I think it will be fine.

Great with modifications - the carmelized sugar did not work for me, perhaps because I lack the appropriate skills. I ditched the carmelized sugar and just added 1/2 cup sugar. I also doubled the cinnamon, rum and vanilla and used half-n-half instead of milk. My crust was fine - I made it the day before and used a few extra gingersnaps (Trader Joe's organic ginger snaps). I will make this again.

OK- after reading some of the reviews I made slight modifications. First of all for the crust. I doubled the amount of gingersnaps and used a little more butter to compensate. Since many people complained about it tasting bland. I added 1/2 teaspoon of ginger and 1/4 teaspoon of allspice. The results were magnificent. The crust was delicious and complimented the delicious filling. Also, this pie became EVEN BETTER the day after Thanksgiving.

I'm a big fan of sweet potatoes and their delicate sweetness. I just made this pie at my boyfriend's house in the Netherlands. I did not have a food processor nor a blender or a rolling pin. I crushed the gingersnaps with a wine bottle, and used a whisk to puree the sweet potatoes. A great pie. The crust was just the right amount. Love it.

I was sorely disappointed. The filling was not "pourable" as the recipe indicated. Mine was stiff as mashed potatoes. Should have added more milk, but went on ahead as the recipe stated. The crust also had a over-baked taste.

I thought this was very good. I read the other reviews about the filling being bland, etc. I tasted it before I poured it into the crust, and added extra cinnamon and vanilla, along with a couple of tablespoons of honey, because I thought it could be a bit sweeter. I agree with the comments about the amount of crust. It was a challenge to press the crumbly mixture evenly and cover the entire pan. If I made this again, I would make a extra half recipe of the crust. I don't know if I will make this frequently, because my family has confessed that they prefer pumpkin pie, but if you like sweet potatoes, this is definitely worth trying; just taste the filling and doctor it to your liking!

The crust was very good, but the filling was mediocre. It was somewhat bland. Also, as I was peeling and mixing the potatoes, the dissolved caramel hardened again and was hard to get out of the pan. This pie was too labor intensive to want to make again.

Reading other reviews, I made extra crust...it stii didn't save this recipe. It is extremely bland!

I thought it was really good! However, there seemed to be too little crust & too much filling. With the amount of crust I had, I had almost 1/3 - 1/2 of the filling left that I couldn't use (what a waste!) -- and I was using a 9.5" pie plate instead of the requested 10". Despite that, it was still good. I left out the rum b/c I didn't have any on hand. Next time I'll try it and see if it makes a difference.

The crust is amazing! To my dismay, I realized too late that I didn't have any cinnamon or dark rum, so I used light rum and nutmeg instead, and it was still delicious. Still, next time I make it, I will make sure to have cinnamon, as I can imagine it makes a lot of difference.
