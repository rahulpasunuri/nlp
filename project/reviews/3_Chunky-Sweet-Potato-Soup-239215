I was surprised how much flavor came from such a simple soup. The sweet potatoes made it really sweet. We ladled it over butternut squash ravioli and then put grated parmesan on top.

Made this per recipe except used dried sage and added curry powder. It's a simple, hardy, quick soup and it's a keeper. I could think of throwing some cooked rice and lamb meatballs in it!

I love this soup! I've made it multiple times and it never fails to impress. I add a split chicken breast (bone in) to add some extra flavor since I'm using store bough chicken stock. I think it makes all the difference. I then remove the bone and and chop up the chicken and add it to the soup. I've also added noodles to the soup (I make sure to add about 1/2 cup of water if I do this) and it becomes a hearty one dish meal.

Had a delicate but tasty flavor. A little bland compared to our regular fare. Would be good for a wide range of guests, including children and those with allergies to the nightshade family.

Boring! After all that chopping, the soup looked, smelled and tasted bland. (Remember to get yams, not regular sweet potatoes, if you want that nice orange color.)To perk it up, I added 8 carrots for color and then spices from another favorite recipe: 2 tbsp maple syrup, 1/8 tsp curry powder and 2 sprigs fresh thyme. Then I blended it all for a smooth, kicky soup.

I have made this soup at least a dozen times. It is wonderful! Easy and delicious. My kids love it!
