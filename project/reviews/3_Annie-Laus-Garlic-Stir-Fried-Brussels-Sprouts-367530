Loved this recipe - used garlic and kept adding olive oil as needed. Ran out of olive oil so added butter. Did the cut side down until browned and then turned them over. I love them a bit crunchy - tossed a little parmesan cheese over them when finished. They were sweet with no bitterness.

We did not like them. Our dog Bramble really loved them cold the next day. However dogs and sprouts can sometimes lead to bad smell - kind of like the overlooked sulfurous smell if you know what I mean.......

This is a pretty good recipe, but I second the people who have made a few changes that make it even better. First of all : blanching the sprouts in boiling water first helps a lot in making sure you don't undercook them. It also keeps the inside of them soft and juicy. Secondly, don't be conservative on the olive oil. Keep adding as you need it, you don't want the sprouts to dry out. Thirdly : Don't be afraid to cook it a bit longer. I've cooked this dish twice now and it's definitely better when it's not undercooked. It's not as hard to overcook Brussel Sprouts as the recipe says. Finally : It's a nice side to something like Veal, or another meat dish, but if you want to make this a delicious vegetable pig-out; I second the comments of other reviewers : Add bacon, or other bits and pieces. Be creative.

I always par-boil whole sprouts, ice them, then cut in half before adding to the pan. They will cook faster and not be so tough. I also add bacon/bacon bits for added flavor and I recently saw a recipe that added beer for even more flavor.

I also have been making brussel sprouts this way for a long time. I don't usually bother with the garlic even though I love garlic in almost everything. The key to getting them right is to put the cut side down on the bottom of the pan and cook at a slightly higher temperature for a bit longer. Don't be afraid if they get a bit blackened. My kids love them and fight over the crispy bits.

You will need to cook the brussels sprouts much longer than the recipe calls for if you want them to cook all the way through. I cooked mine for almost 10 minutes in a cast iron pan on medium-high heat.

I have been cooking brussels sprouts this way for years. I par boil them for three minutes before stir frying and fry them longer allowing them to caramelize.
