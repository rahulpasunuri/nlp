I have a tip on how I smash the plantains before the second frying. I Put a piece of plantain on cutting board, cover plantain with a silicone square pot holder. Then I take the FLAT side of a meat mallet/tenderizer, and I pound the plantain moderately through the silicone pot holder until it is smashed to the correct thickness. This works great. The pot holder has little bumps on it which keep the plantain from slipping around. Silicone is resistant to heat, these pot holders are pretty tough and can take being pounded by the meat mallet without tearing. I use a n 'Epicurean'brand cutting board which is also resistant to heat. My plantains were yellow with a few black spots but they came out delicious sprinkled with salt at the end! A bit chewy,crunchy,salty,sweet..YUM.I will definitely make these again and again.

I LOVE PLANTAINS! This was my first attempt to make them. I served as a side dish for pork loin with lime mojo, black beans, and rice - a CUBAN CHRISTMAS DINNER! My family loved them. I followed the directions, using a knife and followed the suggestion to let them cook in the oil a little longer than directed to caramelize. There is no need to add sugar to this (writer from Portland) if you get very ripe plantains. I bought mottled ones, next time I would go for REALLY RIPE bananas, on the black side. These were also a hit the next day as leftovers on a sandwich with the pork loin and lime mojo or served warm with black beans and rice.

Make it 4 forks by: Using very, very ripe plantains. You might have to put them in a brown paper bag for a week or so. They should be mottled black and the skin should be thin. DO NOT use green ones. Try frying them in 2 Tbs of butter and adding 2 Tbs of brown sugar to carmelize at the end of cooking for yummie sweet plantains. Amazing with ice cream or on coconut rice. Our guest went crazy when we carmelized them and served them over cococut rice during a Carribean themed dinner.

These were really fun and easy! Tried both a mandoline and a knife and both results were tasty. The mandoline ones were thinner and crispier, and the knife ones were thicker, chewier and a little sweeter. I recommend doing a little of both to satisfy everyone at the table! Yummy.

Just made this and it was wonderful sweet and crispy. Even My husband liked it. I think I will serve this as a dessert sprinkled with a little cinnamon and served with vanilla ice cream

There is a big difference between GREEN and RIPE plantain. Green plantains are hard and need to be fried or boiled, dried, smashed slighty then fried and salted. Plantains get sweeter as they ripen, the older they are the less cooking they need. Fried bananas are better, especially with a spicy main dish.

it didnt taste as good if they werent fried long enough. The taste is sweeter the longer you fry them.

My aunt is Puerto Rican, and she slices the plantains about 1/4 inch thick, fries and drains them once, then flattens them slightly with the bottom of a glass, then fries and drains them again. Perfect sprinkled with Goya seasoning and served with a sauce of half ketchup/half tabasco!

I make fried plantains at work almost every day. I want to respond to some of the other reviewers, and add my own (hopefully) helpful advice. If you use a plantain that is too ripe, the plantain will become too dark before it becomes crisp (it will probably still taste fine, though). Also, over-ripe plantains are mushy and therefore harder to slice, as thin strips tend to disintigrate. The perfect plantain, in my opinion, should have a peel that's still mostly yellow, but with significant black splotches. Also, ideally the slices should be as thin as possible, about 1-2mm, or about setting 2-3 on a food slicer. This will result in plantain chips that have a nice golden color when fried crisp, with just the right amount of sweetness.

I used ripe (all black) plantains and it was great.

To some of the other reviewers: If you do not fry plantains long enough they will not be very sweet. Raw plantains are very starchy but during the cooking process the starch is broken down into simple sugars. Use a low-medium heat and cook them until they are soft and slightly browned.

I was just curious in the differences between how Ive been making my plantains and how a recipe would suggest.... I learned how in Venezuela and use that methodology still...same basis with less oil, brown sugar, salt, and a sprinkle of lime(while frying) Delicious!

This is a delicious side dish but it's mandatory that the plantain is at the right stage, meaning: the peel has to be almost black but ALSO (and very important), the plantain itself has to be very soft. I live near Boston. The only plantains that I have been successful with, are the ones that I have gotten in Hi-Lo, a Latino supermarket in Jamaica Plain. All the others, even if they are already black, have ended up being dry and hard.

They were not sweet or soft. Just very dry. Do some recipes add sugar or syrup?

I'm frustrated! I love fried plaintains. I've had them at great cuban restaurants in Miami. But whenever I try to make them, they taste bready and barely sweet. I start with ripe nearly-black-skinned plantains. Are there pitfalls I'm failing to avoid? Please help!

Simple but tastes great. Plantains do not need a lot of help.

I have had delicious sweet fried plantains in Cuban restaurants in NYC and that is what I thought I was making. The 1st time I made these I used the black/yellow plantains that the recipe suggests, and I was very disappointed. They tasted bland and dry and noone liked them. I tried them again,waiting until the skins had turned completely black and the plantains were very soft - and they were great. They are much easier to peel than the recipe suggests, no need to cut them in half first, just cut off the ends. Also, the cooking time seemed about right to me.

excellent with black beans. need to fry longer than suggested, more like 10 minutes
