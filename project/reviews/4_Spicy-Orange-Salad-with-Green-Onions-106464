I'm really glad i tried this as it doesn't sound nearly as good as it tastes. we loved it! it was great with a spicy main dish and i wouldn't change a thing about it.

We like this recipe so much that we have already made it twice. It pairs really well with barbecued and spicy foods. It might also make an interesting addition to brunch.

I was extremely skeptical about this, as were all my friends, but it turned out much better than we expected. Toasted slivered almonds would be a very nice touch. I don't think I would ever crave it, but it's a good recipe to have on hand during the summer.

simple and delicious. serving it in a small, steep-sided bowl instead of a plate satisfies the eye without the need for greens. I will definitely make this again.

This salad was delicious. Since I was serving a rather heavy main course, this salad matched perfectly. I will make this again and again!

This was very tasty, and different. I will make it again, but maybe with a little less red pepper. (I may have added too much, but it was hard to eat more than a couple bites at a time!)

I served this as the last course of a typical Italian dinner. It was a perfect finish to the evening. Because blood oranges weren't in season I threw in a couple of pink grapefruit to give variety and colour. A last minute drizzle of very good quality olive oil really makes this salad.

Mixed blood and navel oranges. Cut the orange sections in half instead of smaller pieces and served with a mixed antipasto. Could even have left the sections whole for this. Loved it.

This is a nice, fresh compliment to an Italian themed luncheon. As an other reviewer suggested, I used baby greens as a base. It seemed to need something to keep the "salad" from looking lost on the plate. I made this for an office lunch birthday party and while most of my staff had never heard of Blood oranges--and were not sure they wanted to, it was a very popular item. If/when I make this again, I will mix the blood oranges with the navel simply for color. The blood oranges I bought were almost solid burgundy in color so the total effect was dark. I think mixing in the navels would be a nicer presentation.

I loved this! I served it with chilean sea bass with morrocan salsa (from this site) and roasted asaparugus. It was a big hit. Will make it again and again.

I served this salad on a bed of mesclun and it was very refreshing. A great summer salad.

This was so simple and very good. It was nice and refreshing served with rosemary pork chops and oven fried sweet potatoes. I may serve it on top of a bed of baby greens next time.

Wonderful! Served as first course salad before paella. I tossed a few mixed greens with olive oil and some of the blood orange juice and made small lettuce beds on each plate, then put blood orange mixture on top. Simple, nice, different.

What a beautiful salad! The blood oranges taste great and are gorgeous. This salad is a wonderful sweet/sour/salty/spicy combination. I garnished with very thin strips of scallions. Easy and lovely (and the portion size is nice as well - small, but adequate)

What a nice change of pace...light and refreshing. ..not too spicy. Served it with grilled rib eye steaks with Parmesan, would be nice with fish. We'll have this often.

This recipe dazzled my date and delighted me! So easy and beautiful. I substituted Basil for Parsley and think it's more interesting, I recommend trying it!

I tried this more out of curiosity than anything else and was met with RAVE reviews. It was excellent and took me all of 5 minuntes to prepate. GREAT recipe and so fast... the perfect start to a fabulous italian or mediterranean meal. It may sound a bit unusual, but give it a try because it's wonderful! (And very pretty, too, which is always fun...)

Loved this: it is fresh and citrusy with a great combination of flavors. The spice can be adjusted to your taste, but the amounts listed in this recipe suited us. We made it with blood oranges, but once they are out of season we'll use regular oranges.

I made this with a fish stew and olive bread. Everything was wonderful. I let the salad sit for a little while before serving, and it was VERY spicy. I don't know if that was from sitting? I loved it, but others may not like it that hot.

Tried this at a party and ran out to get the recipe. Wonderful. A great side dish with grilled fish.
