This is a slightly more sophisticated version of a meal I used to make for my children. Recently my son (Steve) wrote and asked me for the recipe and I sent this to him instead, knowing that his tastes had also changed. Try it is f you haven't already.

We made this recipe as written without reading any of the comments first. It was dry and bland and really does need some adjustment...maybe lots of adjustment. But then it becomes a completely different recipe. To improve as written: cut olives in half, don't skimp on the peppers and onions, add garlic, and maybe oregano and salt and pepper the heck out of it.

Following other reviewers recommendations, I marinated the meat in lime juice, balsamic vinegar, garlic, salt, and pepper. I used top round steak. This recipe was fast, easy, and GOOD. I served it as a lunch, which it was excellent for because it was a 'light' meal, and I didn't feel the need for a nap afterwards! My boyfriend, who isn't always easy to please, gave this a 4, too.

Incredibly bland. Oh my lord ... no taste whatsover. That being said, I would make it again but, first, I'd marinate the meat (I used inside round/SF meat), add some garlic or ginger to the veggie stir-fry. HUGE POTENTIAL, but not the way it's written.

I used leftover steak, garlic, red onion, parmesan and lots of salt and pepper. I forgot the crushed red pepper, but it was still delicious!

As my family said, this is a keeper! I doubled the recipe (only because the flank steak we had in the freezer was over two pounds) and it turned out great. I found the peppers to be extraordinary with the steak.

Other reviewers were right, this is a good recipe if you make adjustments. Marinated the meat in lime and balsalmic before cooking, and used chopped tomatoes and oregano at the end instead of olives and cilantro. My husband loved it.

As written, I would not make this dish again. It was very bland. I did make my own pasta, which was really good. Here's how I would change this recipe for next time around. I would marinate the top round steak with lime juice, garlic, salt and pepper. Then I would grill the steak to medium and then slice it against the grain. For the sauteed vegetables, I would double the amount of green onions and keep the yellow pepper as is. I would roast the red peppers so you get more of a variation in the two peppers. I would use fresh chopped cilantro instead of/or in addition to the parsley. Maybe the addition of sliced fresno or jalepano peppers? I agree with the writer--this recipe lends itself to lots of substitutions! I'm going to make a great meal out of this yet!

This was very good indeed. I made no changes. I think maybe next time I will add just a bit more pasta though.

What a delicious dish! I never would have come up with this combination of ingredients, but it sure does work, and it works very well! I left out the parsley because I don't like it. The red and yellow peppers were SO sweet and yummy, even though I'm not crazy about peppers. More cheese is delish also. Over about three days' time, I ate almost the whole amount prepared. Can't wait to make it again! Awesome recipe!

I added mushrooms and thyme. Delicious.

To the cook from Carmel who made a vegetarian version and then gave the recipe only two stars: You shouldn't have rated this recipe at all. You did not make it. If you leave out a main ingredient and make other changes you have created a different dish. Worth two stars? Maybe. But your two stars for a different dish dilute the ratings FOR THE ONE YOU DIDN'T MAKE!

It needs sauce, and the meat was chewey; should buy better meat and it would taste better.

I don't care how much you love peppers; four chopped-up peppers is too much for 1 lb of steak and a 1/2 lb of pasta. After I chopped them, I took a look at the proportions and removed 2 cups of peppers for use in something else. (Actually, I'm going to combine them with ground beef, the other 1/2 lb pasta, tomato sauce and spices for something that I hope ends up tasting a little like inside-out stuffed peppers with pasta instead of rice.) Another thing I noticed about this recipe is that it isn't really enough meat and pasta for 6 entree servings. Maybe omitting so much of the peppers took away a good bit of the bulk, but it just wasn't that much real food for that many people. If you want to have plenty for everyone and are only feeding 3 or 4, then this is a good-sized quantity...but for 6, I'd double it to be safe. Other than these issues, I liked this recipe because it was easy and delicious. Don't be afraid to add a bit more crushed red pepper, and more provolone too. I also added a generous sprinkling of oregano, which turned out to be a good choice.

This was easy and yummy! My husband loved it, and for my one finicky child, I could serve the plain meat and linguine before tossing it all together. I added asparagus, which was very good, and added less peppers, which was a mistake! The veggies were delicious, so next time I will put in lots. A keeper!

When my husband said this was better than his favorite dish at his favorite restaurant, I knew I had a winner! Next, I'm going to try serving it to family and friends. It's so delicious, I'm sure they'll love it.

Easy to prepare and very delicious. If I had company coming over, this is one dish I certainly would prepare, along with hot bread, a large salad with feta chesse. It reminds me of Mediatteran food.

Very tasty. I didn't change a thing.

I altered this dish and made it without meat. In order to add some flavor the meat would have provided, I added 1-2 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar and I always add freshly ground pepper. Because I altered this recipe and left out one of the main ingredients, I couldn't rate it higher than a two fork rating. However, as a vegitarian dish, it was really good with my additions.

Not great, needs a lot of additional help with taste and was quite dry.
