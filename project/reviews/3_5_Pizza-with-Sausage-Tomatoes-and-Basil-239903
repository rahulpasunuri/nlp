I made some adjustments to this recipe, but kept the spirit of it. I added a bit of italian seasoning to the crust, used chicken instead of sausage, and added some garlic- sauteed onions and mushrooms. The dough didn't rise much, but the yeast I used may have been a bit old. The finished product was quite good, and the balsamic is a great touch.

Very good, we added additional vegetables like mushrooms and onions. We also added some garlic. The results were wonderful!

This was my first time making pizza from scratch, and it was totally simple and delicious. I didn't even know you could make pizzas on a regular outdoor gas grill! A few thoughts based on my experience, though: I used venison sausage instead of turkey (it's what I had on hand), and the pizzas ended up a little too salty. It may have had to do with the sausage. Next time I'll omit the salt in the toppings mix. Also, the dough was VERY sticky and difficult to lift from the wax paper. I ended up sprinkling flour on both sides before putting it on the grill, and it worked perfectly. Next time I'll sprinkle with flour before flattening the discs. Finally, the 4" pizzas are tiny. I'd consider doubling the recipe and making six 6" pizzas instead. Overall, though, quick, easy, and a big hit!
