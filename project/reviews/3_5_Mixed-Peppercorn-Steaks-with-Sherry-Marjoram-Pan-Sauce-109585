I really, really liked this recipe. The flavor of the pan sauce was just amazing, and it complemented the peppercorn rubbed filets perfectly. With the mixed peppercorns it stayed just this side of "au poivre", which is a teensy bit to firey for me (but perfect for the other two in my house). I think I'll use this for regular steak sometimes, too, as my 3 year old all but licked his plate clean. Definitely a keeper.

Improvised with onion instead of shallot, vermouth instead of sherry, and had to use dry marjoram. Still turned into a tasty sauce which went well with the pepper-encrusted steaks.

Good recipe...no changes needed. Will repeat this one.

Fantastic! I had to shave off time between courses wherever I could so I also cooked the shallot/sherry/broth mix first, then after cooking the filet mignon, added the mix back into the pan and finished it.

Excellent flavor! Very easy and quick to make. We served the sauce in a gravy boat to let everyone go back for seconds.
