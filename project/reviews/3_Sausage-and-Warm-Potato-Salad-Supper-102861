I use kielbasa which I slice first before cooking in beer. The potato salad has a great flavor and is a nice change from traditional potato salad.

My family and I enjoyed this dish. I blanched my potatoes before adding them to the other ingredients to shorten cooking time. They did not brown as much as I'd like when fried but it didn't effect the taste. Next time, I'll deep fry them for a crispy texture. I also added blanched asparagus.

Very easy and very good. I sliced and browned the sausages first, then removed them and continued in the same pan, and dumped the sausages back in at the end to heat them up again. Rave reviews from the menfolk.

Was very quick and relatively easy. Good comfort food meal.
