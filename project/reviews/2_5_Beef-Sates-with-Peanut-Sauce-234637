I have been lucky to find some excellent recipes on Epicurious for Thai food, but this is defenitly not, one of them. I was very excited to try this recipe,and the extensive list of required ingredients,was not a hinderance. I followed the recipe to the "T", since I obviously had never made it before. Even though I marinated the sliced strips of rump roast for two and half days, the only flavor i could pick up on was that of the shallots, once i grilled the strips. I thought flavor of the marinated meat, was devoid of flavor. As for the peanut sauce, I would agree 100% with the other reviews. I have made peanut sauce before using another recipe, and have had great results, with half of the work, but since i am always looking for something better, decided to try this recipe for peanut sauce. I like a peanut sauce that is dark, like peanut butter. I dont understand the reasoning behind grinding your own peanuts, rather than just using natural peanut butter, but, after i ground the peanuts, added them to the coconut milk, simmered, and then pureed it in my food processor, the color was that of hummus, and the taste was very bland, just tasted peanuts and coconut milk..no complexity. The color was what was most off putting. I will never make this recipe again, way, way too much work, for mediocre results.

The marinade was fabulous. The peanut sauce was not worth the effort. There are many other peanut sauce recipes that are easier and tastier.

Don;t let the kitchen wusses scare you away from this recipe. The PA cook is absolutely right -- you can take a lot of shortcuts on technique and still enjoy the ethnic ingredients. Microwave the water and throw in some natural peanut butter -- you'll come back some day when you have the time and do it right, right?

Absolutely incredible, I used a mixture of beef and chicken and cooked the satays under the broiler. They were absolutely amazing and so was the sauce, went over very well at a party!

I would like to point out that this dish will not appeal to people with no taste for ethnic cuisine. This is a fabulous Malay dish, the preparation of which can be easily simplified without making much of a flavor sacrifice.

Not worth the considerable effort
