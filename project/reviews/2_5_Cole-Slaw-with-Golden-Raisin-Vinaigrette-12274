I really liked this recipe - it was tasty. Also made it for a party and got compliments from my guests.

I tried this recipe because I had a lactose intolerant guest and my regular coleslaw dressing used yogurt. I used regular (sultana I think) raisins and white balsamic because that was what I had. The result was just OK. The flavour was not very interesting. Perhaps with white wine vinegar and golden raisins it might have been better. I'll never know. I can't imagine the improvement would be that great and thus still would not make a keeper. I'll look for another non dairy dressing.

Too bland and tasteless! I prepared this dish the day before I served it and tried adding pecans, extra golden raisins, etc., but it was still a waste of my time and ingredients.

My family and guests really enjoyed this - it is a nice change from the typical slaw. I did add 1/2 c. of pecan pieces and I used bagged tri-color slaw blend, both of which I will definitely do again. EASY!!!

Good and easy recipe. We served it with home made buffalo wings during the SuperBowl and it worked. We also added some whole raisins at the end and a bit of sugar. Definitely got better after a few hours in the refrigerator.

I have made this recipe for 3 different bbq's and it was a winner every time. Very easy and a nice twist on the traditional side salad.

This takes about 2 minutes to make and is a nice variation on an old theme. Using pre-made coleslaw (shredded cabbage and carrots), this is super easy! If you pour the vinaigrette while still warm, you get one texture. If you wilt the cabbage with the warm vinaigrette but then chill, there's another. Finally, cooling the vinaigrette before mixing is yet another. Good with lots of dishes.
