I made this cake yesterday for my daughter's birthday and was disappointed. The cake was quite dry and, as other reviewers have commented, should only be described as shortcake. The recipe is poorly written, combining the cake and cream filling ingredients together so that it looks as if the cake has 2 teaspoons of nutmeg. Following the recipe exactly, even 1 teaspoon was too much (and we like nutmeg). I made the compote with fresh rather than frozen strawberries so it needed an extra 1/2 cup of sugar and some cornstarch to thicken it. In the end, it was acceptable but defintiely not one I would make again, even as shortcake.

I made this cake with cake flour, in order to make it rise more. That didn't really work. No matter what you do, it ends up like a short-cake. But, it was a WONDERFUL shortcake. Everyone raved about it. Other successful changes: I put a teaspoon of nutmeg in the cake and NO nutmeg in the whipped cream or in the compote and it was delicious that way. Otherwise, I feel the nutmeg would have overpowered those. I, too, doubled the compote. I made mine with fresh strawberries, which I quickly boiled with a bit of sugar in a pan. For the top-most layer, I reserved some compote and whipped cream, mixed those two together and "frosted" the top of the cake before decorating with the berries.

Just made this again and everyone loved it. If you have an offset spatula for the layers of berry compote and cream it makes the process easier. It wouldnt be a bad idea to make some extra compote for serving. Holds up well in the fridge for several days-so you can serve several suitors!

This cake is FANTASTIC! I made it for my mother-in-law's birthday and it was a hit! It is beautiful as well as delicious. Make sure to use the parchment paper - it gives the cake a really good texture.

This was my husband's favorite cake ever. It has a very strong nutmeg flavor, which we really liked. Also, picky kids age 6, 8 & 12 LOVED it. Don't be alarmed if the cake batter is more like dough - just keep to the instructions. It will work out! DEFINITELY double the compote, 1/2 for layering, 1/2 for spooning on when serving. We would like it a little more sour too... more rhubarb or less sugar? Our guests left with the recipe and promised their daughter they would make it again soon. This will be a hit for it's unique and delicious flavors. Enjoy!

This cake was a big hit..very tasty and easy to make. I read that the secret to a light cake is to beat the butter until it is very light and fluffy, and also beat it a long time with the sugar. I did this and the cake was very light and I used regular flour. I used less nutmeg as others suggested and doubled the compote recipe and there was plenty of sauce. Everyone really loved this cake.

Man, this was easy and good-good-good. It was fun to put together--I cut the recipe in half and made two 6" layers, then cut each of those in half; and constructed a little tower of rhubarb, berries and cream. I soaked the top cake layer in simple syrup before slathering it in cream and more berries. I think my friends/family liked this cake, but if they didn't, I don't care. I thought it was gooooooood.

Like other reviewers, I did not like the very heavy nutmeg flavor in the cake and the whipped cream. I liked the texture of the cake and baked it in 8" pans (freezing one layer for future use). I put the compote betw the layers and on top of the cake, and covered it with whipped cream since I only had the two layers. With the sliced strawberries on top to finish it off, I can see that the whole four layer cake would be quite lovely. I am glad that I did not make it for company this first time, since the nutmeg flavor was just too overpowering.

This is a perfect spring cake...a dressed-up strawberry shortcake. I could not find rhubarb (fresh nor frozen) at my market, so I substituted frozen red tart cherries and raspberries. I think the effect was the same: some tart fruit to offset the sweet; it was delicious. I agree with an earlier review about not overmixing this batter; it is definitely a shortcake batter and should be handled as little as possible and probably pulled from the oven before the full 30 minutes are up. I went ahead and soaked the top layer in compote and cream as well, since another reviewer found the top a tad dry. With fresh berries sliced and piled on top it made a lovely presentation.

I just made this last night for a pot-luck. It was fabulous and everyone raved about it. It was gone in 10 minutes flat and all the other desserts just sat there! The only alteration I made was that I used cake flour instead of all-purpose. I saw some comments about it being denser than they expected. It was similar to a short-cake, but it was perfect w/ the compote b/c it soaked into the cake making it very moist. Great balance of flavor w/ the nutmeg and it wasn't too sweet. I'll definitely make it again!

I was expecting a "wow" cake, but this wasn't it. I thought the cake was a bit too heavy/dense for the compote. It was definitely more of a shortcake. It seems the compote would have been better suited with a softer cake..... Just my thoughts. Compote was yummy, though.

This was not at all difficult to make and turned out quite well. If I were to change anything I would add a layer of compote to the top in addition to the fresh strawberries, the top layer ended up very dry compared to the other layers. I made this for a friend's birthday and everyone was so impressed they took pictures.

This was ethereal.. I made it for some guests on easter and it was so much fun. The whole thing took me about an hour and a half and it looked like it had taken days! I reccomend this recipe to everyone; from beginning to advanced!

Made this delicious cake for the 2nd time at my parents house, everyone raved, my boyfriend asked why I hadnt made it for him and I explained it was for courting a fiancee--to the reader who couldnt find Rhubarb--It is available frozen almos everywhere and works just as well.

Made this for my boyfriend last week and he has already requested that I make it again. Couldn't find any rhubarb, so I used two fresh mangos in the compote. Next time I think if I make that kind of substitution that I'll cook the strawberries but throw in the mangos last. I normally hate it when people review a recipe without having made it "right" but what can you do - it was great. The nutmeg was too much for me - I'll cut it in half the next time I make this (or rather not put it in bloody EVERYTHING). Great cake for the components - DO NOT SKIMP ON THE COMPOTE! Because this is a shortcake it really needs the moisture.

I made this cake for a summer birthday party by the pool. A perfect dessert for the hot weather, especially since I used fresh local strawberries.Everyone loved the cake, even my kids who had been appalled when they heard it was made with rhubarb! Next time I`ll double the recipe for the compote so we can have more to spoon onto the slices of cake.

This is a lovely and tasty dessert. Based on some of the previous reviews and the appearance of the cake batter, I treated it as a biscuit recipe with minimal stirring when I added the milk. The shortcake turned out well. My whole family gave this cake a "thumbs up."

Fantastic. The cake didn't rise much in the oven and came out more like a shortbread so I only had two layers. That's okay though, it was still fabulous.

Made this for Valentine's Day for my hubby, yeilding great rewards, yet a bit heavier cake than I expected. High altitudes make your 5000' + adjustments. Hope the child in Beverly Hills had some fresh Narcissus to complete the occasion.....

scandalized my fiancee's family when I explained it was a "courting cake" (They've been hoping I'll say yes for months) although I havent, I would DEFINITELY make this cake again..it was very flavourful and I managed to make it look gorgeous. It held up so well in the fridge...you could serve it to several suitors!

This was an easy and yummy cake. Some variations I have noted for the next time I'll make it: reduce to 1 teaspoon nutmeg for the cake and double or triple the sauce. You can never have enough sauce, specially if this cake serves 6 people, you want to make sure to have enough. Besides the sauce also makes the cake moist. Enjoy.

Delicious! Made this with my 3 year old (cake is a little crunchy - next time, we'll crack the eggs into a separate bowl!) What a great way to use rhubarb! Left overs are wonderful - almost like a trifle.

This cake was very interesting. The layers themselves are rather dense. However, they get to be very moist with the compote and the combined flavours are wonderful.

I love this cake! Great combination of flavors. The leftovers do get soggy, but still taste wonderful. It is a fun cake to make for bridal showers and engagement parties.

This is a beauty of a cake! The balance of the tangy rhubarb compote and the light nutmeg flavor of the cake is perfect. It is almost better the second day, after chilling, when the fruit has soaked into the cake a little. Definitely one of my favorite (and easy-to-make) cake recipes.

I made this cake for dessert last night and it turned out very well. It was fairly simple to make and everybody loved it. I may experiment next time by using other berries like raspberries or blueberries in the compote. Rather than spooning more compote over each slice of cake, I thought it might be good served over ice cream.

I've made this twice & both times got rave reviews even from those that don't like rhubarb.

This cake is excellent. Rich moist texture and just a hint of nutmeg make it tasty and interesting. I make it often as a base for strawberry or any fruit shortcake. If you want a smaller dessert, freeze one for later use.
