I made this cake last night and it came out perfectly. The batter comes together easily and the cake is moist and flavorful. I am not sure why others had trouble with the bake time- mine was just right at 30 minutes. I wasn't as impressed by the frosting. It was fine, but the cake is so delicious that I might not frost it next time.

This is really a terrific cake that can be put together fairly quickly. It has a wonderful flavor thanks to the buttermilk and coffee and the frosting is wonderful. As to the comment about the cake sticking to the pan, I don't think you'll have a problem if you liberally butter and flour it. Plus you serve the cake directly from the pan.

This is really a terrific easy recipe. The buttermilk, cinannom and coffee give the the cake a wonderful flavor. We've been making it since March 1994 when it first appeared on Bon Appetite and have always received compliments. If you butter and flour the cake pan liberally, you won't have a problem with the cake sticking. Plus you don't need to remove the cake from the pan like you would for an ordinary round layer cake. It is served directly from the pan.

Made this cake for my husband's birthday...what a DISASTER! Despite a healthy spray of crisco baking spray, it stuck to the pan in a way I have never seen a cake do before. The cake itself was pretty tasty (I know because we ate in anyway, despite the fact that it came out of the pan in about a million pieces...it was more of a birthday 'mound' than a cake), but nothing special. Anyway, Baker Beware, you may need to do some fancy parchment paper job to get this to come out right.

I searched Epicurious for my must- have ingredients: coffee, chocolate and buttermilk. This cake had all three, it is super easy and tastes absolutely delicious. Thanks, Epicurious, for your help.

Based on the reviews, I was expecting marvelous but got "ok" instead. I substituted the buttermilk for 1 tablespoon lemon juice plus milk to make 1 cup, then used the quantities specified in the recipe. Followed the recipe to a "T" other than that, but let it bake a little longer. That could have been the problem, as the cake came out a bit too dry. The frosting is thick and rich, and the coffee flavor comes through in the cake nicely because I used my husband's ultra-strong brew. I'm not a huge chocolate fan, so if I have to have chocolate cake again, I'll probably keep looking for another recipe.

This was a very moist cake. I thought it tasted better the second day. I didn't make the frosting after sneaking a little sample of just the cake. Nice warm flavor. Good with a cup of coffee.

Finally found a way to use my leftover morning coffee! Very easy and very rich. Forgot the cinnamon and will try it next time.

This is a very easy, moist cake. Don't be worried about the very liquid state of the batter. I baked it 5 min longer than stated.

Made even better by using real butter from Normandy.

This recipe was really simple and tasted great especially with some alterations that I made. I didn't need a big cake so I 'halved' everything in the recipe and made it in 9" round pan. I also skipped the cinnamon and used low fat sour cream instead of buttermilk. After pouring the batter in the pan, I also added some semisweet chocolate chips. I also didn't use any frosting and the cake turned out wonderfully moist and tasted great!!! I would definitely make it again.

This is a very easy, but very good cake. I made it without the frosting,and it's fine with no frosting. It's perfectly moist, not too heavy. I made mine with 1/4 cup McSteven's Spicy Cocoa(www.mcstevens.com, though the spicy is no longer available) and 1/4 cup normal cocoa. The cake came out with just a hint of spice, it was great. I would suggest adding perhaps a touch of nutmeg and cloves. Also, I used very strong coffee flavour and can't detect a coffee taste in the cake.

As I am English I had to compromise a little on the ingredients (buttermilk is not widely used here)and hope that I'd calculated the quantities correctly ( what on earth is a stick of butter?). I was rather alarmed that the mixture was exceedingly runny and took longer to bake than anticipated. However, the result was well worth the effort! My husband particularly, who is not famed for his sweet tooth, loved this cake. It was deliciously gooey, especially with the frosting.

This cake is simple to make and lovely and moist. I use Starbucks coffee in the batter for depth of flavor and also add chocolate chips. My six year old son believes this cake makes me the "best cooker" in the world.

If you love dark chocolate this is the cake for you. It is perfect to take on a family picnic.

My husband liked it but it certainly is not the best chocolate cake we've ever had. The frosting is a bit too sweet for me and since the cake is baked in a 9x13 pan, it doesn't look like the "traditional" cake one would expect.
