I made this with the chicken but tripled it so we would also have some for chips. My son took one bite and said 'I hope you made enough for me to take some of this home!' It is our new favorite. I can't wait to make it again.

Simple and delicious. As good without jalapeno for kids or others.

Avocados trees in the garden were bearing so well i didn't know what to do with all of them. Found this recipe, Absolutley brilliant I almost couldn't stop myself from eating it all in the bowl! I skipped the oil it wasn't needed, also I didnt have fresh tomatoes so used diced tomatotoes in a can making sure to drain well. I think the key ingredient are the red onions, don't make without!

I thought this was a great salsa. My Indian husband loved it, as did everyone at a picnic we attended.

This is it. I have been searching for an avocado dip/salsa for years. I guess I will have to make a double batch to please my family. Yum.
