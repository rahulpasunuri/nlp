Eh...just Ok Dawg. Tasted most of tarragon, not really complex. I used the aquavit, but maybe it would be better with a little wine or something else? Would not make again - is easy and quick tho...

Added a little chicken stock and italian mild sausage and served over orzo...it was phenomenal! I didn't have Aquavit, so I substituted a little sherry and some Buca...what a great dish, one that I'll definitely make again.

Because I didn't have fresh tarragon or aquavit, I substituted dried tarragon and Calvados. It was delicious.

Wonderful, easy tarragon recipe. Nice to have something than the traditional tomato based recipe. Used anise seeds which are simiilar to fennel seeds.
