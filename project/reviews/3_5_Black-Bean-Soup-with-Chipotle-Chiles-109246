I have made this recipe several times,always with excellent results. I have used whatever bell peppers and onions I have on hand. Healthy,hearty,tasty and easy.

We liked this. Used a whole dried chipotle instead of the canned in adobo. Had absolutely NO heat, maybe because of this substitution? Had no chicken stock, so used only water and added a carrot, 1 stalk of celery and 250 ml of tomato sauce. Tasted wonderful.

Good recipe. I adjusted the recipe to add half organic chicken broth and a half water. I addeded no salt organic chicken broth only, if you add salted it affects the bean cooking. Recall bean cooking with salt chemistry. :(

this recipe was a hit, even for those that didn't think they would like black bean soup. I did follow suggestion for half water, half broth. I bumped up the chiles a little. At one point it got too spicy so I put in a peeled uncooked potato in the crock which helped absorb the extra heat.

Rating: 3
This was really good. I took some tips from the other reviewers and used half water, half broth. I doubled the chipotle and garnished with sour cream and cilantro, omitted the tomatoes and yogurt. I also sauteed whole cumin with the onions and peppers and then only used 1 tsp of the ground cumin. I really think this took the recipe to a new level. Very good. Would go well garnished with panela cheese as well.

I love this recipe. I make it quite often with a few changes. Red bell pepper isn't necessary but sometimes I use it. I double the amount of chipotle peppers. I use half chicken broth half water and increase the amount of liquid by 1 cup. I like to puree almost the entire soup so the extra liquid keeps it more soup like rather than refried beans. So delicious. I serve it with tortilla chips and sour cream rather than yogurt.

This was delicious! I used water per recipe and it was fine, but the next time I'll use part chicken broth as suggested. It needed a lot more than 2 teaspoons of kosher salt (I used 2 tablespoons!). Limes are not in season so I used bottled juice, no problem. I didn't use cilantro because my husband doesn't like it, but I recommend Trader Joe's frozen-in-a-cube-tray herbs. Next time I'll add a little cube of frozen cilantro to my bowl. Easy recipe and the slow cooker makes it doubly easy.

Not sure what went wrong for us, but our soup turned out to be quite bland and unappealing. I wish I had doubled or tripled the amount of chipotle peppers (I used some chipotles from the same can afterwards for another dish and they were really spicy, but somehow they didn't give this one much of a kick). Serving it with salsa and sour cream helped.

This is a tasty, straightforward black bean soup. I served it with brown rice, which filled out the meal a bit.

We've made a few black bean soup recipes from Epicurious, and this is our favorite. Using dried black beans and cooking them slowly like this makes all the difference - the beans were silky and flavorful. We found the seasonings and amount of heat to be just right, though I might cut the salt a little next time.

I was very disappointed with the way this recipe tasted, smelled, and looked. I don't know if it was because the soup was prepared in the slow cooker, or because it was black beans (I hadn't cooked them myself before), but I had to flush the whole thing down the toilet.

Delicious, easy and healthy!! i plan to double the recipe next time. instead of sour cream, i made a creamy topping using 2% greek yogurt, 2 tbsp. adobo sauce and 2 tsp. of lime juice. Yum!!

This is a phenomenal recipe- healthy *and* tasty! I followed other reviewers advice to add bay leaf and oregano. Next time I may add a little more liquid-- when we ate it right out of the pot the consistency was pretty good, but the next day the "soup" was much more like "refried beans" (it was still really tasty, but not soupy at all)! We plan to include this in our weekly menu!

This was delicious. I added twice the cumin and used green chili's since I could not find the chipotles. I also added the salt / pepper several hours before recoomended. I served the cilantro on the side (let everyone put their own on.) The yoghurt was a great addition - I used Greek yoghurt which is richer.

Enjoying my first batch of this for lunch. Agree that it needs more umph, so next time I will add some classic Cuban black bean ingredients -- ground oregano and bay leaf. I salted my beans 2 hours before they were done - can't imagine why you'd want to wait. Also, I will only add half a chipotle pepper next time. The yogurt is indeed a nice touch. Forgot to add the lime juice, which it definitely needs and I like the idea of lime juice better than vinegar, which most black bean recipes call for. All in all, it's a keeper with some tweakin', plus I love that I can make it in the slow cooker!

This dish was super easy to make and very tasty! The only recommendation that I have is if you have little ones or are sensitive to the heat of chipotle chiles, try substituting green chiles instead. We loved it with the chipotles but I didn't feed it to my 13 month old son because I knew it would be too spicy for him.

Rating: 3
This was a pretty good soup, flavorfull without many alterations. I added a tsp of garam masala as another reviewer suggested, and used a dried chipotle pepper and about 4 oz of tomato paste because I could not find the type canned in adobo sauce as the recipe asked for. I honestly preferred the soup by itself without the added cilantro garnish, and I LOVE cilantro, it just didn't seem to mesh well with the flavor of the soup in my opinion. I will definitely make this again.

I used one yellow onion in place of the two reds. I also added a tsp. of oregano and a tsp. of Garam Masala. I thought this was the best black bean soup ever! Next time I would not puree the soup as it was not very appetizing and I would just simmer the beans a bit longer to tenderize. We used the leftover for quesadillas and on top of eggs. Yummy!

This is very good black bean soup. I used fresh (soaked) beans and made 2/3 the desired liquid stock and the rest water which tasted right. I put a lot more chilies than called for and would cut it back next time, though others liked it. I felt the lime is necessary to maintain balance, otherwise the soup was too mealy in flavor and not very dynamic.

I took the suggestion of the previous reviewer and used the 4 cups vegetable stock and 3 cups water. I didn't have bell peppers - so I used carrots and celery. But it is the lime juice at the end that is key to balancing all of the flavors. I will definitely make this again - so very easy.

I used 4 cups vegetable stock & 3 cups water. It took a little longer than 6 hours for the beans to get the degree of tenderness I wanted. There was plenty of spice with only 1 tablespoon of the chipolte chiles but it was muted once you added the lime juice. I sliced fresh limes and let everyone squeeze it in at the table instead of adding it to the whole pot. I'm a vegetarian and it's always a relief to find a dish my non-veg family enjoys and they LOVED this one.

This is delicious. I did cut down on the Chipoltles, since I lost my heat tolerance with the birth of my youngest, gee thanks kid, but other than that I left it alone. Just warming and filling and so good. I noticed another reviewer was unhappy about the water, instead of chicken stock. There are some great Chicken Stock Black Bean Soup Recipes on this site. I found this recipe when I was doing a search for Vegetarian Black Bean Soup. I am a veggie and this soup is perfect for me.

I really liked this recipe. I made two changes. I roasted a head of garlic, and added it when I pureed the beans. It added a nice earthy flavor. Also, I did not add the lime juice.

Black bean soup should be done with chicken stock added to previously boiled black beans, adding epazote herb for that real mexican flavor. Adding only freshly done "pico de gallo" ( tomato, onion and serrano chilli pepper with coriander, olive oil and garlic)and some avocado and fresh cheese instead of cream ...or cream if you fancy. And decorated with some thin slices of fried corn tortilla and a chipotle pepper...absolut heaven!!! ..and NO LIME please

I love this soup. I use chicken broth instead of water, canned black beans, and top with avocado and sour cream in addition to the suggested garnishes. I also like to serve baked quesadillas with this soup - just brush corn tortillas with olive oil, layer with cheese and scallions, and pop in the oven at 350 for ten minutes while the soup boils.

Rating: 3
I don't have a slow cooker so I followed the advise of another cook and soaked the beans first and then started the recipe. Well, it didn't work out as the whole thing burned because I didn't stir it often enough. HOWEVER the beans that didn't stick to the pot were really delicious and flavorful but not at all a soup. I used 3 chiles and chicken stock instead of water and wound up cooking the whole thing for about 2 hours after the beans had soaked for an hour in boiling water. I am going to use the beans in tacos and combined with rice as a side dish for the next week.

Rating: 3
I like chipotle and adobo, but that's all this soup tasted like to me. And it wasn't even all that spicy - just chipotle flavory. All these other tasty ingredients and the soup just tasted like low-spice chipotle. I left out the lime - maybe that's why?

AMAZING AMAZING!! The recipe is good, BUT... Substitue stock for at least five cups of liquid. I used low-sodium veggie stock. Fantastic! I used a little more lime juice as well. This is such a phenom-soup: spicy, citrus-y, rich, healthy!

My whole family enjoyed this soup, even a certain member who usuall doesn't like meatless meals. It was very spicy, but we like that.

Quick easy and yummy. I did not have chipotle in adobo but did have some dried chipotle chilies. I used 1 Tbsp of these and the result was very hot. I added an extra can of black beans at the end to take the edge off. In addition because it was still quite spicy, I added about 3/4 of orange juice instead of the lime juice. The additional sweetness helped with the heat. Next time I'll just use less of the dried chipotle or make sure I have some of the canned ones. I tend to like spicy but I got a bit more than I bargained for. After so many writers said that the soup was not spicy enough, I over did it.

I made this the other day for dinner and did not have the six hour time to make it in the crock pot. So, I made it on the stove. I did a quick soak,(rinse beans, cover with water, bring to a boil, boil about 2 minutes, remove from heat and let stand for 1 hour. Drain and rinse; follow recipe) It only took about 3 hours to cook completely and it was fabulous.Very spicy! Made some cornbread and a tossed salad and did NOT give any to the kids! Way too spicy for them. But my hubby and I loved the recipe and will make it again.

Good way to use what I had on hand, the soup is hearty, but needs a little doctoring to give it more zip. Instead of chopped tomatoes, I used my favorite salsa, and a little sour cream instead of yogurt. I used homemade turkey broth in place of water.

I think I would substitute at least half of the 7 cups water with broth next time - I felt this lacked a little something under the salt and lime (which as another reviewer noted are essential - it tasted like nothing before I added those!) Still, nice and simple.

This soup was very good...I would probably give it 3 forks, but I gave it an extra fork because it was so easy and so healthy! Careful w/ the chipotle chiles...I used four and it was probably too spicy for the average person. Don't skip the lime and salt...it takes it from ho-hum to very flavorful. The yogurt is also a great addition. I cooked mine for 8 hours on high and it was perfect. I thought it was better after pureeing the two cups, so I wouldn't skip that, either. Hearty, good soup.

This soup is fantastic! I used 4 cups vegetable broth, and 3 cups water. I used 1 large and 1 small chile, which made the soup very spicy, but not overwhelmingly spicy. I don't have a blender, and my food processor is very small, so I didn't puree anything. I served it with mini corn muffins.

This was so easy to make, and full of flavor! I added some smoked pork to it at the beginning and then shredded the meat into the soup at the end. I would have liked it to be thicker, so maybe next time I'll put in less water/broth. We used sour cream instead of yogurt and also added some colby jack cheese. I expected it to be spicier and was actually kind of disappointed with the lack of heat. My eight-month-old ate the soup, so it must not be too spicy!

Wonderful, easy recipie that provided three nice-sized dinners for two. I took the suggestion to use half chicken stock and added some good quality cubed ham for additional oomph and flavor. Two chipotles (I used canned in adobo sauce) added just the right amount of zip though they were a bit more than called for in the recipe. I also added more lime juice than called for in the recipe which along with the cilantro gave the soup a great fresh taste.

I loved this dish. The garnish toppings on top gave it interest as well as presentation.

I used a pressure cooker to make this much more quickly. I sauteed the vegetables (also adding 2 chopped carrots and 2 chopped celery stalks) in the pressure cooker, then added the beans and liquid (half vegetable stock/half water). Brought it up to high pressure, then reduced heat to maintain high pressure and cooked for about 9 minutes, then allowed pressure to release naturally (letting it sit off the heat), which took about 15 minutes. Took off the lid and added my seasonings and used an immersion blender to puree about half of it. Voila--soup done in less than 1 hour! I am planning to serve it over polenta.

Pretty good soup. MUCH better the second day. I suggest making it with some other Mexican dish, such as quesadillas or fajitas. Very good as a side dish, but not as a main meal. I suggest adding beef or vegetable broth as opposed to all 7 cups of hot water. Also, a few cooks suggested adding more beans to the blender to make the soup smoother. I highly second that notion. Overall, a good summer dish!

This soup was delicious! The only changes I made were to use 1/2 chicken broth and 1/2 water and to cook it on HIGH for 6 hours and on low for 2-3 hours more. In our opinion, the garnishes were a must, providing a fresh, delicious flavor contrast to the soup.

Rating: 3
I generally followed this recipe using 1/2 chicken stock, soaked the beans overnight and added a 5" ham bone I had from a prosciutto. I also used about 1/2 the chipoltes since my wife can't eat very spicy food right now. When the beans were done cooking I thought they were OK but kind of bland. I took about 1/3 cup vegetable stock, 1/4 cup red wine and reduced by about 50% with a 3 bay leaves, 2 sprigs of tyme, 3 allspice berries and a pinch of cinnamon added. Strained and mixed into beans. It changed the flavor of the soup but there it was an improvement and not overwhelming.

Rating: 4
What a fantastic recipe! I don't even think it needs the garnishes (lime, cilantro, tomatoes, yogurt). My modifications: I didn't use the bell peppers because I'm allergic to them and I used chicken broth instead of water (as it advises at the end of the recipe). Since a few of the cooks mentioned that the beans weren't cooked after 6 hours, I cooked it for 9...and kinda burned the soup (as burned as things get in a crockpot, more like carmelized, I guess). But honestly, I think that made it even tastier! I did have to add more water, though, and cleanup was a mess. Next time I will cook for 9 hours, but double the amount of water. Yum!

Rating: 3
A good, spicy soup; even better the next day. I added the meat of a smoked ham hock, but it's a fine soup "as is." However, I recommend soaking the beans overnight as they were still quite firm even after 8 hours in the crockpot. I think next time I'll partially cook the beans.

I don't have a slow cooker, so instead I used canned black beans (drained, rinsed) and vegetable broth. To prepare, I added the beans right after the garlic/cumin and before the broth and let it simmer around 20 minutes. I also added smoked turkey sausage as husband is suspicious of meatless fare. De-lish.

Incredible! Very easy. Made it in the crockpot. Added leftover ham from Easter that I had smoked on the BBQ. Scaled back the chipotle for my wife and added more to my bowl. Serve with extra lime (a must), plenty of cilantro, and substitued fat free sour cream for the yogurt. Shared with a co-worker who thought it was "beyond belief good."

To the cook from Missouri: The first two possibilities that come to mind about why your beans might not be softening are that either they're too old or that they weren't cooked at a high enough temperature. Dried beans never cook quite as tender if they're over about a year or so old, so if you've had these beans for a while or if they sat on the shelf at the store, that could be it. I recently learned it's an urban myth that salted water toughens beans--I'd heard it so many places that I figured it must be true, but after experimenting I've had no problems cooking beans with salted bouillon in the water with them the whole time. As for the temperature, have you cooked beans in this slow cooker before? If you have a pressure cooker, you could try cooking some of the batch in that... If that doesn't do it, then it's the beans!

Initially I wasn't too sure about this recipe; it did seem to be missing something. However, I served the soup to a group of folks at a potluck dinner, and received rave reviews. I used 1/2 stock and 1/2 water, I think that did make a difference. Also I pureed more than 2 cups of soup; I think it needed to be a little thicker. Next time I may add more chipotle peppers for added flavor, but overall good & EASY recipe.

Very good vegetarian black bean soup. I've made black bean soup with smoked ham, but with the smokiness of the chipotles, we didn't miss the meat at all. For those of you who, like me, think there's something missing, try adding a little red wine vinegar (a few dashes per bowl or about a tablespoonful per recipe) just before serving.

I was skeptical about this recipe initially (have not been enamored with crock-pot dishes in the past), but the reviews convinced me this was worth trying--and indeed, it was!

We also deceided to add some fresh cilantro to the crock-pot while it cooks next time for some more flavour, and to use vegetarian broth instead of water.

Looks interesting and I'd like to try it....do you need to soak the beans overnight before putting them in the slow cooker?
