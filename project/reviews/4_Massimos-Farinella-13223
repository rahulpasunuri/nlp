Good but not spectacular. The dressing didn't have enough flavor to hold up to the pearled barley -- I upped the basil and that helped. It holds in the fridge for a couple of days without getting soggy, which is good because this recipe makes a lot of salad!

Loved it, and so did the hubby. Bright, summery, quick and easy. We made it with barley. I always love a chance to use one of those grains sitting in my pantry that I have a hard time thinking what to do with.

Oh my heavens, this brings me back to my summers spent in Italy. This is the simplest recipe that packs the biggest bang ever. I am adding this to my weekly rotation! Perfect salad to complete a summer meal. We didn't have a cucumber on hand, but instead added a sliced avocado (my husband's idea). It was the perfect, creamy, rich touch to an already delicious recipe. WOW, we loved it! Going back to the market tomorrow to buy more barley!!

This is a great salad on many counts. First, it is wonderfully light, but at the same time hearty. It's also fast and easy to prepare. I used barley that was cooked in chicken broth and the amount called for of Purslane and basil. The next time I make it, and I definitely will, I'll add an additional amount of Purslane. If I were using Arugula, I'd likely use a bit less than called for because of it's strong flavor.
