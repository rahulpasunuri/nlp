I generally make recipes as they're written the first time I make them. What I discovered with this recipe is that there's way too much brandy for the amount of cream. Even after the sauce boiled, the brandy flavor was still too strong. There should be only a splash of brandy (or cognag) to add a little spark of flavor.

This is easy, and it tastes really good. Not amazing, but quite good given the ease. The timing on getting the breast cooked and the sauce reduced can be tough--there are just so many variables here, like mushroom moisture, how hot your stove is, how thick the chicken breast is, etc. So you may need to add water or stock, or you might need to take the breasts out when they're done and further reduce the sauce. On top of that, I think it's pretty hard to know when chicken is done just by touch, yet it's easily overdone, which makes this recipe not as easy as one might think. If you're like me in that way, you have to cut into it a few times or use a meat thermometer, both of which are a minor pain.

This dish was okay but didn't have a lot of taste. I added the garlic and mustard, but I still though it was bland. probably wouldn't make again.

Doubled the fresh mushrooms, used whole milk instead of cream with a little cornstarch/water solution for thickening, approx 1 tbsp fresh thyme plus 2 garlic cloves and 1 tbsp grainy dijon, as other reviewers suggested. Served with baby potatoes. The end result was really lovely - my husband and kids gobbled it up!

Having read the reviews before I made it, the recipe looked like it needed a little "something." I added a tsp. of chopped fresh thyme and 2 cloves of minced garlic. I'm not a big fan of dried mushrooms so I just skipped those and it came out fine. Served over pasta, which was good but I think rice would be even better.

I'd give it 2 & 1/2 if possible. I think it would have been a definite 3, had I not made the poor decision to buy the cheap cherry-flavored brandy, which got too sweet. I also used milk in a vain attempt to reduce the fat content. However, I ended up with a very creamy sauce with the addition of some flour. You can always thicken a thin, gravy-like sauce with some flour without compromising the flavor. I'd love to try it again with regular brandy.

I made the mushroom cream sauce for sauteed chicken. It was very good, I added some garlic. I will probably add more flavor next time though, it was a little plain.

I typically follow the recipe exactly. It's rare for me to change things... That said, I added 2 garlic cloves, 1 tsp. course mustard, and my secret ingredient - tarragon! Oh, I used chicken tenders from Trader Joe's, and doubled the sauce, substituting 2% milk for the cream. This was so darn tasty!!! I served over noodles. I cannot wait to make this again!!!

The mushrooms and onions in brandy/cream sauce are out of this world! The aroma is unbelievably delightful. Next time, however, I will pound the chicken to even thickness to avoid overcooking - this was the one downside of this recipe as written. I will certainly try this again, as the mushrooms are SO good! Please, do NOT substitute sherry, red wine, white wine, or any other liquor for the brandy - the brandy is essential to the flavor of this dish.

Very good. Do not need to cook the chicken in so much butter; do a TBL butter and olive oil each.

This was very good, and easy to prepare. I added 1T dijon, and used whole milk instead of cream. The sauce was still creamy.

Made this the other evening. It is very good. I will be making this again for sure. The mushroom sauce would be great with a steak too. Loved it.

This is such a quick and easy recipe yet its elegant. The only thing I did different was to use shallots instead of onion and I added 1 lg clove of garlic finely minced. Next time I will, however, double the sauce measurements because after it cooks down, there isn't that much left and everyone wanted more so if you make it, double or double and a half the sauce..

Very quick and easy, with great results. Because of what I had on hand, I substituted 1 tbsp of olive oil for half of the butter, red wine for the brandy, half and half for the cream, fresh wild mushroom mix for the dried, and added a clove of garlic and a chopped zucchini. I used a half of a cup of chicken stock and added about a tablespoon of dijon mustard. Served over egg noodles, and it was a hit! Will probably bulk up the sauce a bit next time because it reduced quite a bit.

Made this for a dinner party. Highly recommend making it a day in advance as the flavours melded together better by the second day. I pounded the chicken slightly just to even out the thickness for even cooking and dredged in flour. I prepared it on the stove and the next day I just popped it in the oven and cooked it at a relatively low heat. The chicken was incredibly moist. I used shallots instead of onions and I opted out of the dehydrated mushrooms due to the texture issue. I chose button mushrooms which I found to be quite mild tasting. Perhaps mixing them with a richer meatier mushroom might help. I also added some chicken stock to taste. Salt and pepper is necessary. I served this with Duchess Potatoes where were devine! Comfort Food for sure...but for the milder palates.

I saw the movie Julie and Julia, remembered the chicken mushroom and cream dish in the movie, decided to make it the next day. I followed the basic recipe except using Marsala wine in lieu of brandy. The sauce tasted flat. I add two teaspoons of Dijon mustard and about a one inch squeeze of anchovy paste. Delicious! The chicken was a big hit with my family and tasted even better the second day.

Actually, try flattening the chicken breast and dip in seasoned flour,It will cook in about 2-3 minutes, I do use brandy(apricot), fabulous!!!

It's all about the mushroom sauce, I gotta say. Based on all previous comments, I expected mine to be soupy and it was, however I cranked up the heat at the end and just let it boil down. Also, I used sherry (instead of brandy) which turned out to be a great substitution. Served over polenta, this uber-comfort-food dish is a winner!

I hate to say this, as I'm sure the fresh version is delicious, but with an injured knee I'm temporarily unable to stand up cooking for long. Four words: Cream of Mushroom Soup. (Quick prep and real tasty) : ) I'll try the real one someday...

A great weeknight dinner. Quite simple and fast to prepare. I made it with mashed potatoes:). More sauce with the mushroom/onions would be even nicer.

A quick, tasty weeknight meal: 7:00 am: took chicken breasts out of freezer to defrost for dinner. 5:50 pm: searched epicurious website for something new to do with chicken breasts. 6:30 pm: arrived home, boiled water for soaking mushrooms, prepped and cooked everything else while discussing the New Hampshire Presidential Primary results with husband (Go Hilary!). 7:00: put thin fettucini noodles in water to boil, steamed fresh broccoli. 7:15 pm: served dinner for family of 4. Continued to discuss primary! We all liked it; a tasty, simple alternative for chicken breasts using ingredients I usually have on hand at home.

Awesome recipe!! It has become my fiance's new favorite. Too make the sauce thicken, I added about 1/2 cup of cream after the "8 minutes of boiling" and a little more salt and pepper for flavor and simmered it for another 5 minutes. Let it cool for 3 minutes and it was perfect. I put it over egg noodles with broccoli on the side.

This is very good. I would like to try to make more sauce next time, it's so good. Please don't skip the brandy, that's what gives it the rich warm flavor. I served with egg noodles and broccoli. I used breasts, but I would like to try it w/ thighs.

This was a pretty decent recipe. It was simple and easy. In my opinion it tastes better with chicken thighs instead of breasts. It tastes fine without the brandy, also.

I would recommend doubling up on the sauce! The main complaint by my food eaters was, "Can I have more gravy?" Other than that, it's one of those in-a-pinch recipes that should satisfy most people's tastes.

I commented in May about how fabulous this dish was, and just got around to making it a second time. This time I used the heavy cream, and I did not get the sauce to thicken despite boiling for quite a while. Maybe the secret was the evaporated milk. The taste was still great with garlic mashed potatoes.

This is a great recipe.I have been making my own version of it for years.Here are some maybe helpful hints for those who had problems with the sauce.First,when you add cream(should be 35%) you should first denature it by bringing to a "first boil" this will prevent it from curdling will also make your dish last longer cause it will not go sour.I always add a pinch of nutmeg to any cream sauces I make.I too use olive oil and very little butter.Butter gets toxic at high temperatures,so you should always add it at the end to blend in rather than cook with it.when sauteing the mushrooms,I use just a bit of olive oil and a bit of butter.My preferred dried mushrooms are the dried porchini,or the cepes.These give a fantastic aroma and flavour to the dish. Your problem of having difficulty in thickening the sauce is because you put too much liquid.If you have so done, and the chicken is already cooked, remove them from the pan,then boil down the liquid/now you can add the cream/mushroom sauce,and return the chicken to the pan to simmer for a few minutes.I hope this has helped those who were disappointed.dont hesitate to ask further questions.It will be my pleasure to respond.Gina1139@yahoo.com

Delicious! Double the sauce (not the mushrooms)- we ran out. I replaced the onions w/ 2 cloves garlic - because I found my onions had died. Used Remy Martin VSOP cognac. Also added a spoonful of goat cheese at the end Served with pasta & steamed spinach. Enjoyable weeknight meal.

I thought this recipe was great. I'm a beginner cook and the directions were clear. I used Trader Joe's dried wild mushrooms ($1.99) and it turned out very tasty. My guest raved.

This was fabulous! Very rich with the brandy and cream. I used chicken thighs because I like the taste of dark meat better than white, and low fat evaporated milk because I was out of heavy cream. Everything worked just fine, and since the thighs needed a little more cooking time than breasts the sauce had time to thicken. I took other reviewers' advice and made mashed potatoes to use with the sauce. The family loved it!

the rehydration of mushrooms can be skipped if you just brown some fresh mushrooms. olive oil substitutes well in place of butter. the recipe can be scaled down to 1 serving if you you use 4 mushrooms, 1 breast half, 4 spoons of brandy, 4 spoons of cream, and pinches of onion powder and dried parsley.

I've been making this recipe for several months now, and it is a favorite with us. It is on our regular rotation of dishes I make when I don't feel up to something new. The recipe has evolved a bit over time. I really don't like the texture of the dried mushrooms, regardless of how long I soak them, so I use two kinds of fresh instead. I also double the sauce, as we like this dish served over noodles. I will say, the sauce takes quite a while to cook down, so you need to be patient. It does not need artificial thickening, just time. I would suspect that cooks having problems with this sauce "breaking" or failing to thicken may be substituting low or no-fat ingredients for real cream and butter. You really can't make a decent cream sauce with those type of items.

Decided to use this recipe as a base for a vegetable-pasta main dish. I sauteed diced eggplant and spinach along with the mushrooms, until tender. Then I added a couple of dashes of nutmeg which really completes the flavors.

This is a lovely dish. For those reviewers who were commenting that the sauce is too thin; I wonder if they weren't patient enough in allowing the mushroom liquid to evaporate. I waited until it was paste-like, added the cream, brandy, and reserved soaking liquid, brought it to a gentle boil, and it took about the 8 minutes that the recipe mentioned for it to thicken right up. I would recommend that you slightly flatten the chicken breasts so they are about the same thickeness throughout. Look an earlier reviewer, I added garlic. (Two cloves, chopped.) Served with wide egg noodles and green peas. Used two types of dried mushrooms (porcini and oyster). Very good, and I will definitely put this on my "favorites" list.

An oldie but a goodie - rich and very flavourful. I used 6 chicken thighs so increased the amount of broth, cream and brandy by one half and added 3 cloves minced garlic to the onion and 'shroom mix. Simmered the sauce for 15 min. to thicken/reduce and added 2-3 dashes ground nutmeg (so good with mushroom dishes). The dried 'shrooms add so much earthy/hearty flavour, so do not omit them. Poured the finished sauce over the browned chicken and baked at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. The thighs were moist/tender with ample sauce of good thickness/consistency. Calorie laden and not a healthy dish, but delicious and very satisfying. We can't always eat "twigs, leaves and pebbles" and all deserve a guilty pleasure every now and again! Cheers!

I always read the reviews before making an Epicurious dish for the first time. When I read the comments here about the sauce being less creamy than most expected, I decided to add some thickener to the process. I mixed the cream and brandy together and then whisked in some flour before adding to the mushroom mixture. The texture was perfect!

The flavor of this dish was great. I cooked the chicken while the mushrooms were simmering in the broth. I also used shitake mushrooms that weren't dried. I had expected a creamy sauce but it never boiled down very much. It was more like a soupy broth that you put over the noodles. Very yummy!

I have made this recipe several times now, and we just love it! I double the sauce, and serve it over wide egg noodles. The only change I have made is to soak the dried mushrooms longer so they are less "chewy" textured.

Didn't use the dried shiitake since I had some fresh ones on hand. Added a little fresh thyme along with the mushrooms and onion. Didn't have any brandy but saw that another reviewer used white wine. Not sure whether I'll use quite so much butter next time, but the chicken was amazing! Didn't dry out and was really easy to make. And the mushroom sauce really was fantastic.

This recipe is great, my life-partner gobbled it down! The only thing I'd change, well, my life-partner likes his sauce extra creamy, so next time I will cook the chicken completely before reducing the sauce and cooking the chicken a second time. Also, my life-partner does not like it when I make a mess, so I recommend using the same pan for the mushrooms that you use later to cook the sauce & chicken. That's all!

My family and I loved this dish and yes we would make it again. I did not have any Brandy so I substituted with chicken broth and I cooked the chicken in the oven for about 16-min, while I sautéed the Mushrooms and onions and then I thickened sauce on the stove. I read that the chicken was not done and we do not like our chicken under cooked. My chicken breast were kind of thick, if I would of butterflied them it probably would of cooked fine. It turned out wonderful. I served it over Fettuccini Noodles with steamed Asparagus on the side. My two-year-old even loved it.

Made with dried portobello and shiitake mushrooms as well as 18 ounces of fresh button mushrooms. My husband is very picky about mushrooms so I didn't think he would like the plentitude of mushrooms in this recipe. To my surprise, he went back for seconds on the mushrooms to finish off his chicken. I'm going to dice the leftovers and make a pasta dish out of it. I've done this before with great results. One word of caution on this recipe: if you are looking for a creamy sauce, this isn't the recipe for you. The previous chef noted that the sauce isn't creamy and thought it was due to the large proportions he/she was making. However, I made the recipe as directed and still did not end up with a creamy sauce. But we didn't mind!

I made this recpie as the chicken dish for a large holiday party, and I cut the chicken into bite-sized chunks for easier service/eating. It kept resonaly well prepared a day ahead of time. The sauce was not the creamy consistency I was hoping for, but that may be due to the large proportions I was cooking. In response to the reviewer who had large raw spots in the chicken, I don't see how that's possible if you followed the recipe, browning the chicken in pan until all most cooked through before simmering with the mushrooms. Note: This recipe calls for ALOT of mushrooms... I used dried shitake, dried porcini, fresh crimini, and fresh button mushrooms. I may cut the quantity of fresh mushrooms in half or even a third next time. I look forward to making this again on a smaller scale.

We did not enjoy this recipe. The cooking time was way too long, causing the sauce to break down. I removed from the heat when the sauce began to deteriorate, about 6-8 minutes short of the advised time, and the largest chicken breast had raw spots throughout. The result here was greasy, and not especially tasty. I probably won't try this again.
