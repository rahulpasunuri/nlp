I found the recipe pretty conventional. The radicchio added a nice bitterness to the taste but I don't understand why it couldn't simply have been added as one of the pan ingredients, sauteed and incorporated, rather than fussed over as a "holder" for the stew. On another note, I struggled finding a jar of onions that weren't pickled. I ended up with ones that were (Ferma brand, in Canada) and the pickled taste didn't work at all. If I were to make this again, I'd skip the jarred onions, cut some large chunks of raw onion, saute/sweat them, and incorporate them into the recipe.

This was delicious. I added lots of chopped garlic, and left out the fennel for our taste. I chopped the sausage and radiccio into bite size pieces for easier serving and eating for a party after a tennis match. Aoli on top was a decadent addition!
