This is a simple recipe for a beginner cook or someone who has little time to spare. I thought the cardamom added and exceptional and unique flavor that compliments the tartness of the rhubarb and raspberries. Great recipe for it's ease of use, flavor combination and simplicity. The only difference for me is that I let it boil for about 2x as long with the raspberries to make it thick enough. If I could do it again, I would boil down the rhubarb longer to thicken and then add the raspberries for the last few minutes so they don't fall apart as easily.

Reduce the cardamon by half or leave it out. I like it without. But half the amount adds a little something. The entire amount is too strong. Have friends who beg me for it every year.

An easy recipe for the beginner (like me). Great for the morning toast. My only criticism is the taste of cardamom was a bit too strong.
