My local grocery store carries prepackaged roasted beets in their produce section, so this was a quick and delicious salad. I was a little worried that the dressing would be too strong with all that mustard, but it was very nice with the beets, snap peas and arugula.

This was quite good. I picked up some sugar snap peas and was wondering what to do with them when I came across this recipe. I already had roasted beets in the fridge, so it was a quick and easy side dish. The fresh dill goes beautifully with the beets, which is why it's such a classic pairing. Since I don't eat sugar, I used honey instead, and since I didn't have arugula I used mixed baby greens. The arugula would definitely match better, but the mixed greens did pretty well. I will definitely be making this again.

A refreshing side dish in the summer which has become a staple in our family and with guests. The colors are lovely, although leftovers look purple after the first serving. The crunch of the sugar snap peas is a nice contrast to the beets.

Pretty good recipe, though having never worked with fresh beets before, I didn't realize what a mess they make- wear gloves when you peel/cut them otherwise you'll end up with stained fingers and nails. I added cauliflower to the salad, which was good even though the cauliflower turned pink. Overall tasty salad but perhaps too much work.

Very tasty way to serve beets, the roasting brings out wonderful flavour. We had served this ages ago and misplaced the recipe, it was nice to find it agian here on the web page.

I joined an organic produce farm cooperative for the first time this spring. I couldn't find many recipes for sugar snap peas until I remembered Epicurious. So far this salad is a favorite. I was able to use the first beets of the season as well. The tangy dressing and the nutty flavor of the arugula make for a memorable salad!

Fantastic...good mixture of textures and flavors. Would definitely make again. I also mixed the dressing into the arugula.
