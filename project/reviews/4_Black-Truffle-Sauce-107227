The flavor of this sauce is outstanding. While I agree with the other cooks that the flavor is delicate, this sauce simply needs to be paired with something delicate. A steak or red meat will dwarf the subtle flavors of this sauce. I highly recommend serving this with shrimp and risotto. Use the solids that are to be discarded and a little bit of the sauce to cream up the risotto. Then saute some shrimp in white wine, garlic, and butter. Pour the sauce on top and your taste buds will do back flips. The **sauce** should be the show case of the dish. Combine it with things that will not overpower it,

This sauce has a delicate flavor, perhaps more delicate that I would have expected or wanted given the amount of truffles and truffle oil added to the recipe. My guests commented, "oh this does have truffles, doesn't it!" after several minutes of eating, to give you an idea of how subtle the flavor was. The amount the recipe yielded was enough to make four relatively generous "primo piatto" sized bowls of pasta, still with half left over to freeze.

This is delicious. I've put it on filet & it is also great on polenta or risotto. Don't discard the solids, save them & toss into pasta for lunch! Also great with mushrooms, but the truffles are amazing for a special occasion.

This is a sauce served in 5* restaurants. Time consuming, but worth every minute. Served it over filet mignon.

We used this to top grilled scallops, with a fresh Oregon black truffle. Pretty much followed the recipe exactly, except used a mix of half and half and cream, which was plenty rich enough. Yummy!

I made this with the crown of shrimp dish for Valentines day. The dish came together harmoniusly and made an impressive presentation. My only gripe is that the truffles are strained out of the sauce, which seems a bit waisteful. I used truffles from Whole Foods, which did not seem to contribute to the flavor of the sauce very noticably (perhaps it's too subtle for my palate). I think just using the truffle oil would be adequate, especially if you are on a tight budget.

I made this sauce to serve on Gnocchi and Asparagus for my gourmet dinner group. Even the fussiest eaters used a piece of bread to wipe the dish clean. I had also served Veal Marsala. I only used 2 cups of heavy cream and 2 cups of half and half. It didn't matter and I have left overs.

I used this recipe with a fresh winter black truffle over pasta for an entree at a dinner party in Provence. It was a hit and my guests were impressed that it was created by an American chef. I saved the drained mixture (minus the thyme sprigs) and mixed it with potatoes hashed with onions in olive oil.

I tried this sauce as a "dress-up" for a client's so-so-hum stuffed mushrooms. She had made the stuffing in advance and forgot to drain the excess moisture out of the seafood, so the caps became soggy--We changed it around by making this wonderful sauce, steaming the stuffed caps and "dressing" them up with the truffle sauce. WONDERFUL!!!!!
