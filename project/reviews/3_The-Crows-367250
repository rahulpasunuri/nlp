Nice, solid, velvety cupcakes. As a big fan of crows, I bothered to look at this recipe when it came up -- too bad it doesn't mention cupcakes. I bet a lot of people have overlooked it, which is why mine is the first review. I filled some of mine with apricot or strawberry jam and used white icing. Very tasty and held up well to being filled. I would definitely make these again.
