The lemon was very overpowering. I would not make this dish again.

I feel I shouldn't review this because I subbed gouda for parmesan and it was well, edible. Maybe it's just me.

Easy enough for weeknight dinners but always popular with guests. The melted parmesan gives the broccoli a delicious texture. Good with and without the lemon.

I've made it several times, it's delicious. The lemon flavor is a bit strong so I would reduce it to 1 teaspn.

Yummy quick weeknight broccoli. I added a pinch of red pepper flakes to spice it up a little. Very good!

Great recipe! We made a few modifications- used broccoli and cauliflower, added toasted almonds, and used about 1 1/2 cups of parmesan just because we love cheese. Excellent recipe, quick and easy, already shared it with friends and family.

not bad, but it said that it served 4 so I doubled the recipe (because i was serving 12) and ended up with enough broccoli for 20!

Quick and easy. I liked the lemon zest. A few red pepper flakes spiced it up a bit too.

What a great idea to add lemon zest. I usually cook my broccoli florets with garlic and a pinch of red pepper flakes. This recipe kicks broccoli up a notch and for someone who doesn't like it, such as myself, it has made me eat more of it.

Really quite excellent! I had not read the reviews before making this and I did not EXPECT the cheese to melt--it is meant to enhance the flavor and texture of the dish and add another taste dimension, which it does very nicely. It's not meant to make a cheese sauce or gratin dish. The broccoli should be al dente with the cheese just warmed and softened. It was delicious this way! I used grated romano and served with spicy grilled salmon from this website with garlic and olive oil couscous. Exceptional meal and a definite four forks!

The problem with this recipe is that I could find broccoli florets, so I used plain flowers instead. Also, the parmesan cheese was hard, so I substituted American cheese. Garlic makes my brother's elbow hurt (of course), so I used garlic bread. What a mess!

I feel you owe me. Mr Kobayashi will be in touch with you.

I don't think this really did much for the broccoli. The olive oil just added fat without adding much flavor. I'll go back to steaming and squeezing lemon juice over the broccoli at the end.

It's getting worse. Jeepers!

Don't waste the stems of the broccoli! Simply cut them away from the broccoli heads, peel then and slice them about 1/4" think and saute with the garlic and lemon zest. I used whole garlic cloves instead of chopped garlic and it made a prettier presentation with the added benefit a sweet flavor from the sauteed garlic. Probably not a good idea for fids though. I too used a shake of red chile peppers. My husbands like the heat!

I quickly sauteed some scallops before I threw int he broccoli. Delicious! The broccoli tastes better than my frozen scallops. I used lemon juice instead of zest that I had saved (frozen) from when lemons were in season here in Florida.

Delicious!!! This is such a tasty combination of flavours! It is definitely on my keeper list!

Very nice flavor. I increased the garlic and the lemon - a good contrast.

Also works with green beans.

I agree with some of the other reviewers that the cheese doesn't melt like it should. But it did taste absolutely delicious. I had no lemon zest so I used bottled lime juice (I know it's not epicuriously correct) but it's what I had and it was a great substitute. I also gave it 4 forks because like the woman whose 2 sons ate it, my 2 1/2 year old son who has sworn off broccoli finished what was on his plate and more. It's true what they say, if you put cheese on broccoli kids are more likely to eat it.

Wonderful! Just be very careful not to overcook the broccoli - it's just perfect when it's still bright green. The lemon added a very interesting twist.

Delicious! Will make this frequently!

The family loved it despite the fact that I left out the cheese and zest. Getting my 6 and 9 year old boys to eat a vegetable until there's no leftovers earns 4 forks no matter what!

This was excellent, quick, and easy to prepare. I cut the recipe in half, used a lid with steam vent while cooking the broccoli, substituted dry Jack for the Parmesan cheese, and added a sprinkling of sesame seeds. I quickly sprinkled on the cheese, tossed to coat, and served. The cheese melted to perfection. We were delighted with the color of the al dente broccoli and with the freshness of the taste, thanks to the lemon zest. We'll have this many more times.

Oops, just realized when I started the review that I forgot to put in the lemon zest. Perhaps this would have made this a 4 fork. I made a half of recipe on the broccoli but doubled the garlic and used a half of cup of parmesan. Use one third cup of water and added about 2 teaspoons of dried hot pepper flakes. The broccoli was outstanding.

This broccoli tasted great, but my parmesan cheese also congealed making it less aesthetically pleasing at my dinner party. I would take the suggestion to sprinkle the parmesan over the broccoli without mixing it and have some on the table as a side.

Great alternative to steaming broccoli. The parmesan melted before serving, however, and didn't look too appealing. Next time, I would serve the parmesan on the side, and add it to the dish just prior to eating.

I normally don't like broccoli but when I saw this recipe I decided to give it a try. Certainly no disappointment; I especially liked the lemon peel in it. It added a bit of freshness which broccoli otherwise doesn't have in my opinion.

I don't know what kind of parmesan the other reviewers used, but mine blobbed up as it melted and looked terrible. Also, the liquid took much longer than five minutes to cook off. All in all, this wasn't much better than my normal steamed broccoli.

Very good recipe! Thanks to other reviewers, I added a lot more garlic and parmesan and it came out delicious. There were no leftovers!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was ok - not great. I think next time I will try substituting feta for more oomph and maybe increase the garlic.

Made this for my grandson's birthday dinner as he loves broccoli and every one loved it. It was easy and I like that. In AZ we don't like to heat up the kitchen in July. I used Elephant Garlic so it didn't overwhelm my grandson. The garlic and cheese combo is wonderful.

OK but not great. There are better recipes for broccoli out there. I had a lot of leftovers.

A pleasant surprise. This was easy and delicious. I cooked broccoli too long, but that was my fault. Will make again soon.

I thought this recipe was MUCH fresher tasting using the lemon zest than simply using lemon/pepper.

I love this recipe. With a couple of time saving tricks like pre-cut broccoli and pre grated cheese, I found it to be very easy and very yummy. It wakes up regular steamed broccoli. And a great meal option for vegetarians (I served it with cous cous and edamame).

I really enjoyed this recipe! I didn't have a lemon for the zest, so I used lemon juice from concentrate and lemon pepper. It was still great! I used Lucini olive oil which made it even better! Quick and delicious!

Like other reviewers, I didn't think this was worth the effort. Just as satisfying (and easier!) to make steamed broccoli.

I make this recipe often and it is really good and easy. I have made with rapini and with regular broccoli.

I've made this several times now. It's so easy and fast to make that it's perfect for weeknight meals AND it gets the family to eat actual green vegetables. I've also used the same recipe with blue lake beans instead of broccoli and it turned out great!

Agree with other reviewer: steamed broccoli is just as good and with less effort. However, I may make this again because my husband, who doesn't care for broccoli, thought it was "good for broccoli."

This was a great vegtable dish for a holiday meal. The lemon, garlic, and cheese were just enough flavor to go with other dishes without being overpowering. Even our picky eaters loved it. This is a keeper.

I think this is the first time I've given a recipe here four forks... I think this dish deserves it for its perfect simplicity as well as its versatility. Just make sure you use quality reggiano cheese. :)
