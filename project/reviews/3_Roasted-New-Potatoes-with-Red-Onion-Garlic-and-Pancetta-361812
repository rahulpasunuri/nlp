If you are looking for more garlic flavour, you could also roast whole garlic bulbs in the oven on medium-low heat until they are soft. First, cut a portion off the top of the entire bulb so that the circumference of the garlic is exposed (save the cut off portion for another use). Gently take off the paper surrounding most of the bulb so that it remains in tact. There will still be some paper remaining. Drizzle a little bit of oive oil or canola/ olive oil blend over the garlic bulbs and roast in a medium-low to low oven (approximately 300-350 degrees Fahrenheit). Be careful not to overbake them as they only need to be softened.

This is an okay recipe. Surprisingly the flavors came out a little bland. I hate red onions, so I used yellow onions instead. Next time I think I'll slice them instead of chop them so you get more of an onion taste when eating the potatoes. I didn't see how you would get a good garlic taste using whole garlic cloves, so I minced the garlic instead. Still, there was only a light garlic flavor. Next time I will definitely add more. All in all, it's a very easy recipe and it has potential with some modifications.

The biggest advantage of this dish is that it leaves your hands free to work on the rest of the meal. While the flavors are nothing special, it is solid and comforting, and it would probably be better with a few modifications. Next time, I will toss the potatoes with the pancetta drippings and cut the onions a little larger to stop them burning. More garlic would be good too - the roasted cloves are great, but there aren't enough to go around.
