The sauce was too strong! I rinsed the dish with water, and it tasted much better, I am no wimp when it comes to flavor, but that was a LOT of hoisin. Maybe they meant 7 teaspoons? I even used 9 oz of noodles and added twice the veggies! Noone in my family enjoyed the dish.

I really loved the favors in this salad. I used my grill pan and used some ginger garlic paste and some fresh ginger, but otherwise stuck to the recipe. I would make it again but maybe a half portion as it Makes a lot.

I did not think this recipe was impressive at all. It was pouring down rain, so I broiled the veggies instead of grilling. I made the amount of sauce called for, but lessened the amount of lime zest. My husband and I agreed that the eggplant and mushrooms were both mushy, and the snow peas were not enough to contrast it. It would be improved with some crunchier veggies. My husband liked the sauce, but I thought is was unoriginal and kind of flat. The one redeeming quality was that it was on the table 45 minutes after I started it. Still, I don't think I'll make this one again.

Fantastic weeknight meal. No grill so I stir-fried those veggies with some tofu and soy sauce and saved some scallions to sprinkle on top. Also, I used buckwheat soba which seemed a little heartier. Seems foolproof...

Based on the other reviews I cut the amount of sauce in half and it seemed about right. I made it with grilled tofu which worked perfectly.

Everyone in our family liked this dish, including our 17-month-old son! We made the following modifications to the recipe: baked the eggplant slices instead of grilling; used a package of extra-firm tofu cubed and stir-fried in the sesame oil instead of the mushrooms; omitted the grated lime peel from the sauce. While the eggplant was baking at 425-degrees, I sauteed the tofu. When the tofu was almost done, I added half the sauce and the sliced green onions to the wok. This helped give the tofu some flavor. Then I added the eggplant to the wok, and after draining the noodles and snap peas, I added the second half of the sauce to the noodles, mixing it in. Finally, I mixed everything together. We thought it was a great dish.

This recipe sounded good but I found the finished product to taste really bitter and unpleasant.

I've made this twice, both times with shrimp and without eggplant. Prepared entirely on the stove. The first time I used the juice and minced peel of two limes which, as much as I like lime, was too much. One lime the second time was just right. Might have gone a little overboard (a touch more than the recipe calls for) with the hoisin sause the first time. Had about the right amount of sauce after letting the mixture set few minutes prior to adding the shimp and serving.

It was really tasty, and easy to make. As far as extra sauce goes, who can't usse extra sauce? It's got a grea flavor and can compliment any extra dish. I'm curious why you rated it with 2 forks because it had too much sauce?

This recipe was simple and tasty. For those who don't have a grill, I modified the recipe by cooking the veggies in a wok and it came out delicious. I will definitely make it again!

The sauce was delicious, but too much for the dish. It drowned the veggies and I had only used half. I did have leftover sauce and I put it on salmon and grilled it- That was a four fork meal!
