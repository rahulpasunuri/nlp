This pie has an intense chocolate flavor. It did not last in this household long enough to be concerned about spoilage. Very nice texture and firmness.

Excellent! Used 8oz ghirardelli 60% cocoa, pow! Gotta be a chocolate lover for this one. I made a basic pie crust since I'm still trying to perfect the technique. The saltiness of the crust was a welcome contrast. I also put some orange blossom water in the whipped cream (its been sitting, neglected, in my pantry). The chocolate cream was super easy.

This was fabulous. I made it using the pecan crust recipe from one of the Lemon Meringue Pie recipes and got the WOW! I love to hear.

I made this pie to the letter, and everyone raved. Personally, I thought it was a bit too sweet; next time, I won't add any sugar to the whipped cream topping. (To be fair, I added more than a tablespoon.) The consistency of the fillng was perfect, despite the fact that I spooned the still-hot filling into the (cooled) crust and chilled the pie only for about three hours before serving it.

This pie recipe is excellent! I've made this a couple times- with the chocolate wafer crust & with a standard pie crust. Both taste great, but the wafer crust made this a sweeter desert. I prefer a less sweet crust so I would probably use less sugar in the wafer crust next time. The custard is delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. Just be patient and let the custard thicken before removing from the heat or it will not set up and will run.

very disappointed in this recipe. It was so highly rated; but why? Far too bitter, and didn't set up firm enough to hold it's shape when cut. Basically just a runny pudding.

Appeals to the inner child of grown men! Excellent custard- rich, not too sweet. I used a simple pastry crus, in a quiche pan (rather than the deep dish presentation) as the 'saltiness' of that balanced the chocolate experience.

This is amaaaaaaaazing. I had to do a graham crust, but I added 1/4 c unsweetened cocoa to make it a chocolate graham crust (totally recommend - worked fabulous). The chocolate filling was silky and rich and delicious. LOVED it. Great dessert, pretty easy to put together and looks great with a touch of shaved chocolate on top.

Amazing, delicious, a total crowd- pleaser.The only change I made was to use semi sweet in place of the bittersweet to soften the flavor a tiny bit. Very easy to make.

Rating: 4
Really delicious. I was out of unsweetened chocolate, so I used all bittersweet and it wasn't too sweet to my tastes. I also doubled the vanilla and used only salted butter in the filling and crust to enhance the flavour. My only issue is that the crust stuck to the pan. Next time I will butter and dust the pan with cocoa powder. I highly recommend using the Nabisco Famous Chocolate Wafers if you can find them. They are about as easy to locate as a red-haired, left-handed unicorn, but if you persevere, you can do it. It only took me 5 stores, but I found them at a Giant. Apparently some Safeways carry them, as well.

I just love this pie and make it often with store-bought traditional graham or chocolate crust. It is a simple recipe that always gets rave reviews. I recommend using good quality chocolate for a pie that is both elegant and a crowd-pleaser. I do not change a thing.

The filling wasn't quite chocolaty enough so I doubled both kinds. I used a classic pie shell and made a meringue with the eggs whites - why throw them away? The result was a beautiful chocolate meringue pie that looks and tastes like a county fair winner!

This is a perfect chocolate pie filling. I doubled the vanilla to make it taste richer. My family doesn't like chocolate crusts, so I made a regular crust, baked it blind, then cooled it before adding the filling. With those two changes, this is the ideal chocolate cream pie and I'll use this recipe from now on.

This recipe performed as described from start to finish. I don't always have luck with custard bases and thickening -- this was perfect. Also made a delicious pie that was devoured. That said, I think that I, similar to another reviewer, would prefer a moussier texture. Next time I will use a chocolate that's not quite as dark and fold some whipped cream into the filling.

Rating: 4
Delicious and straight-forward. Only one issue, I could not source the Nabisco wafers and used Teddy Grahams chocolate graham cookies instead. Major grocery store and no such cookies! Hope to find them for next time.

YAY!!! This pie is so delicious. Perfectly creamy, darkly chocolate and a lovely change from birthday cake! Tips: I used dark chocolate grahams instead of wafers and they worked perfectly. LET IT SET 8 HRS! We couldn't wait to eat this, so we sliced the pie after only about thirty minutes and although delicious, it was still a bit wobbly. Day 2, after setting, it was perfect! This was my first chocolate pie and I will definitely make again!

Rating: 3
This is a great recipe. I had a surplus of cocoa and subsituted just under a cup of unsweetened cocoa powder and 5 tablespoons of butter for the bittersweet chocolate. The flavor of the filling was excellent, chocolatey, and not overly sweet as is would be with a sweeter chocolate. I put a tablespoon of sugar in the whipped cream and this was just enough to keep the pie from being too bitter. Will definitely make again.

Rating: 3
There's something not quiiiiite there with this pie. I think it would've blended together a little better if the chocolate layer was lighter in both flavor and texture, like more of a mousse consistency, rather than a pudding consistency. It also needed something a bit more interesting in the flavor department to bump it up a notch, so I put fresh strawberries on top of the whipped cream layer, and people said this actually made the dessert. All this being said, it's still damn good chocolate pudding, smothered in fresh whipped cream, in a pie crust, so what's not to like?

Rating: 0
I have never liked chocolate pies, I normally prefer fruit pies and something denser for my chocolate-fix. However, this pie changed my mind- it's incredible! When I'm lazy I used a store bought crust- graham cracker works very well with this too. I accidentally bought all semi-sweet chocolate for this pie once, and it was delicious as well! If you are more of a milk-chocolate fan, I recommend this approach. One more praise: my husband's grandmother is the queen of pie-making and she even requested this recipe. Love it!

I have made this recipe on several occasions and have been impressed every time. The crust is good enough I have used with other recipes. The filling is perfectly rich, leaving you with a feeling you could eat just another little slice. I have expanded to 1.5 times to fill my slightly larger pie pan.

This is absolutely delicious - if you like chocolate, you'll love this pie. We've made it several times, for Thanksgiving, summer potlucks; it's great for any season. We use regular Nilla wafers instead of chocolate, high quality Belgian chocolate chips, and we make 1 and 1/2 times the recipe and use a deep dish pie plate to make sure there's enough to go 'round!

This was very tasty, however the only difference between this and the boxed pudding is the richness. So if you are low on time, I would just add melted chocolate chips and vanilla to a store bought mix.

SO good. I'm not a huge chocolate fan but this was superb. The chocolate cream tasted like mousse (I used 4 oz semisweet and 3 oz 60% bittersweet) but with the right consistency and oh man! My friends, parents and I couldn't stop eating it. My mom did say to have a bit more whipped cream on top and that alone it was too skimpy.

This recipe makes a good consistency pudding but it was way over the top with the chocolate. I used 7 oz of semi-sweet chocolate and used regular graham cracker crumbs for the crust and it was delicious! I can't keep it in the house for more than a day! Without these changes it was bitter and entirely too rich to eat.

I used 7 oz semi sweet chocolate and 1 cup of sugar thinking my husband would prefer this pie sweeter. It was too sweet with the very sweet pie crust. Next time I'll make it the way the recipe reads though I may use 5 oz of semi sweet chocolate instead of the bittersweet and then 2 oz of unsweetened as written. This pie was easy to make and very smooth.

This pie is extremely chocolatey, and I love that it does not have raw eggs. But for me the filling was not nearly sweet enough--I upped it to a full cup of sugar and all semisweet chocolate instead of the bittersweet/unsweetened combo. Delicious!

i thought this was really good and really easy. it was the first time i've made a chocolate cream pie (my favorite) and i will definitely do it again. this recipe is very rich and has a nice dark chocolate flavor. i wouldn't mind making it just a touch sweeter next time. maybe 60% cacao vs. 70% which i used this time. i used a store bought crust to save time and it was fine. everyone loved it!

I love this recipe and make this all the time BUT 1/4 c. of butter is too much for 1 1/3 c. of crumbs! It will bake into a rich soupy mix all glopped together at the bottom of the pie plate. I use just over half that much butter. The crumbs should not look moist, but should stick together on their own when pressed.

My 5 year old loved smashing the wafers in a plastic bag using a rolling pin. The trick to this recipe is using fine quality chocolate. I used ghiardelli 85% cacao dark chocolate, and the ghiardelli unsweetened chocolate. I cut out the sugar from the pie crust--no need for so much sugar. I also cut down the sugar in the filling. I skipped the sieve part as well as the whipped cream since. I might use the cream for a party but if seemed like overkill for a family dinner. My husband said it was the best chocolate dessert he had ever had.

Delicious pie! Like many others, I made it with a regular pie crust, which is a nice contrast to the richness of the filling. In place of whipped cream, I made it with a meringue topping--it was divine! I've made this pie twice now, and the filling turns out differently based on the type of sauce pan I used. My regular Revere copper bottom pan--the filling wasn't as thick. The Le Crusette pan made the filling perfectly thick.

I used a graham cracker crust-it was what I had on hand, and Ghiradelli Chocolate. It all came together quite easily. I chopped the chocolate finely just as I would if making a ganache so there was no need for me to premelt the chocolate so I skipped that step. I had been worried that my filling wouldn't thicken up in time as it was a last minute decision (made pie at 10am for 5pm dinner). The custard on the stove thickened nicely and when the whole mixture was chilled for about an hour and a half I transferred it to the pie crust and it was the perfect consistancy. We are serving this tonight and I can't wait. I gave the filling a sneak taste and it is great. Whipped Cream will be the perfect foil to it.

I needed a chocolate custard fix and this was easy and delicious. I only had Valrhona 71% cacao that needed to be used and slightly adjusted the sugar. I only had 1% milk, but the texture and taste were terrific. I highly recommend getting a skinny nosed whisk that gets to every drop of custard in the pot. I have two - a balloon one and a flatter one.

This is a delicious chocolate pie that received the best pie award at our Thanksgiving dinner! I made the crust with the Nabisco Famous wafers two days ahead of serving and filled it the next day. So the pie sat in the fridge one full day before serving and it still turned out wonderfully. Since then, I made the pie again using an oreo cookie crumb crust (premade). We felt that the premade crust ruined the integrity of the pie and my kids would not eat it. The chocolate flavor of the premade crust did not go well with the chocolate filling. Easy to make, I used Nestle's 62% cacao bittersweet chocolate bar and strained the filling for pure creaminess. Delicious recipe as written--no changes necessary!

This pie was the hit of the Thanksgiving sweets. The chocolate filling was creamy, chocolately, not terribly sweet and was oh so rich. Chose to top this with a meringue instead of whipped cream.

Add 3 cups of shredded coconut in place of the melted chocolate (you still need to add the butter and the vanilla) and then continue to follow the directions as listed. After you've filled the crust (use chocolate or vanilla wafer cookies), top with some toasted coconut and voila! Will definitely make again...
