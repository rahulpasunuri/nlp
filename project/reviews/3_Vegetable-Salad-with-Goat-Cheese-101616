I wasn't a fan of this. Found the dressing to overpower the beautiful flavours of the fresh tomatoes and basil - think I prefer a simpler, slightly acidic dressing.

My husband and I love this and make it often. We do not blend the capers or the olives for the dressing but rather throw them in whole. Also we have always skipped the anchovies and onions--felt like it would be too strong of a flavor. I agree that the potatoes could be reduced and more cucumbers added.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I used grape tomatoes cut in half and some thinly sliced left over grilled steak. I was generous with the tomatoes and would defintiely make this again. (didn't use fennel)

We didn't like this. I knew it wasn't going to be a pretty recipe, from the reviews, but we went in with an open mind and didn't find that this was something we wanted to eat (based on how it tasted). I left out the fennel, but I wouldn't make it again, with or without fennel.

I found this to be a delicious summer staple. I love to serve it alone with hot crusty olive or rosemary bread, and a bottle of Zin. I do cook the potatoes al dente and take great care when tossing in the dressing so not to make a mash of it.

This was good, I was looking for a salad that incorporated goat cheese without the usual sweet accompaniments like beets and candied nuts. If I made it again I would reduce the potatoes and add more tomatoes and cucumbers. It definitely isn't pretty, but the dressing was really good.

Everything was fantastic. I would reduce the amount of potatoes. The dish can become heavy as a stand alone dish. I would recommend more cucumbers to replace the potatoes. Yum.

My husband and daughter thought this salad was great, but I agree that the gray/brown color is not attractive. Flavors are nice. Next time I'll just add the olives and anchovies to the salad instead of grinding them up for the dressing.

I must be missing something here. From the reviews I was excited to make this. I served it to a large group of people & the comments were very questionable. The presentation was awful. I should have known that after blending the olives, anchovies & capers together, well muddy gray dressing is not my idea of attractive. Very disappointed in this one.

This is a keeper. I left out the potatoes since I was serving them with the dinner, but added more cukes. Leftovers were great the next day.

This is a fabulous salad--you like anchovies. My husband and I both thought it was one of the best salads we have ever had. I added an extra tomato and had 14 of the very small red potatoes so used those. There was still enough dressing for additional vegetables. The cucumber really added a nice touch and the potatoes with the dressing are incredible. You'll love this!!
