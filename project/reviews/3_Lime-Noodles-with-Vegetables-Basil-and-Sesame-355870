I tried this recipe because I thought the combination of flavors sounded interesting. However, they really didn't work for me and my family. None of us enjoyed this, sadly. :( Cannot recommend it.

The concept of lime-flavoured noodles is novel and works fairly well, but the dish is nothing special and is not worth one's time.

good recipe, I used way less butter and oil and it was still good. Also I would definitely at least double the veggies, more is better.

Made this for a dinner party of 8 and everyone loved the dish and thought the flavors were very unique! Like previous reviewers, I don't understand why the recipe calls for so many different pots and pans. Next time I'm going to consolidate and I'm not going to blanch the herbs. I added some Siracha for more heat and I excluded the sesame seeds since one person was allergic. I don't think we missed anything without the sesame. I also used quinoa noodles to make it a little healthier and added 1/2 of green peas for a little pop and sweetness. I'll def make this again!

Delicious, but kinda extravagant.

this is an ok recipe, but it seems like its too much work for what it is. Maybe it's the way it's written. Like the earlier poster i couldn't understand why it said to blanch the basil and mint. Also, the preview said it's sweet, sour, and spicy, but i only got sweet. Still the flavor is good and i would make it again, but without blanching the greens and maybe less butter. and there's no need to use so many pots.

The previous reviewer was right. If you follow the recipe as it's written you will dirty 3 pots and 2 pans. You only need 1 pot of boiling water (for the noodles and blanching the herbs, as yes I'm not sure that's necessary either) and a large skillet for cooking the garlic, vegetables, and creating the lime sauce. All that said, this dish was ok -- flavors are interesting but I felt kind of gross after eating because of the excessive amount of oil and butter the recipe calls for.

I made exactly as instructed except I used korean vermicelli (like glass noodles), and just a tad less oil. It's delicious and interesting, but it's one of those recipes that dirties a zillion pots and pans. The lime syrup could be cooked in the same big pan that the noodles will be mixed into. Also, do the mint and basil really need to be blanched and dunked in ice water? I'm going to try this again with some shortcuts to see if it still tastes as good. As is, a few too many dirty dishes for the result.

I can't enter a fork rating because I ran out of sesame seeds and had to use tahini instead. I think this affected the texture of the sauce to make it a little too gloppy. I also used buckwheat soba noodles. But I don't think either change altered the flavor much, which is good. The sweet lime with the mint was just perfect. Next time I make this, I'll add more heat to the vegetables. This was a good start to a meal that could be excellent.

This dish was good, and well received by my boyfriend. The basil/mint sauce was fabulous. The quantities listed yielded more than was needed, which is great because I look forward using it on steak tomorrow. When making it, I did not use the suggested tablespoon of salt, but simply a few grinder twists of sea salt. I also only used about 3/4 cup of the oil, and used the leftover garlic cooking oil to help accumulate that amount. I personally was not a fan of using rice noodles, and thought the consistency got old after the first two bites, but would perhaps use Soba or Udon next time. For the veggies, I used red bell pepper, carrots, broccoli, and kohlrabi: all fresh from the farmer's market. best wishes, Melissa
