Really nice flavor match. The avocado mellows out the salad, perfect counterpoint to the cress. Idid back off a hair on the dressing; using about 2/3 gave it a nice coating.

Every now and then my local grocery store offers produce that I've never tried before. If it looks good I look up a recipe on Epicurious and give it a whirl. This is exactly what I did today with this recipe and it was a success! The dressing really makes the dish! It was fun to make and delicious to eat. I included some left over slices of apple that I used for the dressing in the salad. A really nice change up from the every day salad.

Loved it! Added grated carrot for color ala Dojo Restaurant.

My guests and family loved this. I didn't have enough watercress, so I added a similar amount of green leaf lettuce to make a quantity to serve 6 modest portion sizes. I didn't use all the dressing, so next time I will use enough watercress and lettuce to make a salad for 6 or 8 larger portions. I was tempted to add Craisins or some colorful fruit, since the salad was monochromatic. I will definitely make this again. Delicious!

This is quite good. I used seasoned rice vinegar and it didn't seem to matter. Doubled the dressing and added shredded chicken to make it a more robust dinner salad. I'll add this to the rotation for sure.

This is an amazing salad. The dressing is so good, tastes almost like a ponzu sauce at a 5***** sushi restaurant. I have been making this now with everything like spinach or lettuce, added tomatoes, also added a little fish sauce. All my friends love it too. Takes less than 2 min to make this dressing.

Simple and wonderful. I didn't love the texture of the grated apple in the dressing alone, but once mixed together with the watercress and avo, it was just fine. Loved the simplicity of it all.

This salad was delightful! I had never tried watercress before and was a little nervous, but I am glad I did, it has a bit of a tart aftertaste but is not bitter at all! The dressing was delicious too, I put the avocados in the first time I made it, but I made it again with leftover steak slices, watercress, and tomato and that was delicious too!

also, who are the 9% of people who wouldn't make this again? they're nuts. seriously, this is so good!

incredible salad!! i just had one small bunch of watercress so i halved the dressing ingredients and still had some leftover, but i will be making this frequently throughout the summer. i also had a red onion instead of a vidalia, and it was an excellent substitute. delicious.

Rating: 4
This was very impressive, especially for the amount of work involved, and the flavors are not overwhelmingly "Asian" so it can go with other types of dishes. Excellent paired with salmon. Would serve it to company without hesitation, yet it's easy enough for weeknight meal. Even my husband, who's more of an iceberg or romaine guy, ate every bite.

I got a big bag of watercress in my CSA veggie box and I wanted to make something besides cucumber and watercress sandwiches. This recipe was outstanding!!! My husband was skeptical because he thought the watercress would be too "peppery" but the flavors melded perfectly. I served it with soy marinated flank steak and baked sweet potatoes. This one is going to be a keeper!

Yum! But I got 5 cups of watercress out of 2 bunches -- be careful not to overdress.

This was great! I was looking for something new to do with my watercress and avocado. My 13 & 14 year olds even loved it! My husband wants me to make it once a week. We served it with seared Ahi tuna and forbidden rice. Wow!

Totally delicious!

I had a bunch of wonderful hydroponic cress that I needed to use, so I made this salad for lunch and it was pretty good. Because I made it for "one" my ratios could have been slightly off. I was disappointed that I couldn't really taste the onion or the apple, mostly the soy sauce. I have a comment for the cook from Toronto...there is no lemon in this recipe. What were you commenting on in your review?

I really loved this recipe, even though we had to substitute the watercress with a greens mix and the rice vinegar with a white balsamic, it still turned out great! Can't wait to go have seconds!

Delicious! This recipe has the perfect combination of flavors. It's salty, sweet and tart. I used spring mix instead of watercress.I will definitely make this again.

This was fantastic. Of course I didn't use all the dressing, I almost never do, and I still used a TAD too much. I love the combinations, great croutons, and the lemon in the dressing wasn't overpowering which I often find when any sort of lemon juice is. A keeper!

We have a subpar grocery in my neighbourhood, so I can never find watercress. I have made this recipe with escarole and with a pre-packaged green mixture, and the dressing really makes the dish either way. I also eat the dressing with just avocado. It is superb.

This was good - but I found it almost too overbearing. I followed the recipe exactly - although I may have used too much dressing when I tossed it all together. I've tried lots of others that I enjoyed more.

awesome dressing! first time i made I used a big, fresh fuji apple, the second time with a gala apple. I liked the fuji a lot better. Cut up the rest of the apple and added it to the avocado and watercress, everyone loves this salad. Would totally put a fish on top to make a main course.

This salad is so simple yet complex in flavor. I threw in some salty edamame and served it as a main with a crabcake on top. Fabulous flavors!

Delicious! The second time I made this salad (today), I peeled the apple, cut it into thin slices, and pushed it through a garlic press instead of grating. Same with the onion. Much less messy than grating. (Grating the apple was especially challenging.) Yummy!!!

This was very good. Be careful not to use too much onion! I did, but I could tell that if I hadn't it would be a great dressing.

I took prewitt_e's advice and made this with the Black Butter Salmon. Great together. Dressing was perfect for the watercress. Slightly sweet to offset the watercress peppery flavor and fresh tasting.

The dressing is what makes this salad a very special one. There is a complete balance and freshness of flavors.

I served this with a spicy salmon recipe (also from this site; the term "black butter" was in the title) to rave reviews. I believe the term "food bliss" was used. The grating is a little messy, but quick; everything else couldn't be easier or better. Sometimes messy is good.

Rating: 3
Very tasty, and very easy, if a little bit messy (grating onion and apple). The dressing will probably get used for other salads too. I see someone else had the same idea of serving this with the P an Seared Tilapia which worked well.

This was great!!!! I added some julian jicama, and grilled some shrimp in a little sweet chili sauce to serve over the top! I served it as an appetizer but it really could have been an entree and how perfect to see the sun set over the ocean as we munched on this!

Fabulous. I have served this with seafood and with a heavier meat dish. I used an asian greens mix from the store instead of watercress. This is a new favorite.
