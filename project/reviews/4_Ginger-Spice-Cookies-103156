Hallelujah!! You have rescued my favorite cookie recipe! It was the darn Crisco! This has been a treasured cookie recipe until about 5 years ago, when suddenly the recipe stopped working. I could not figure out what had changed. It resulted in hard crispy cookies that spread A LOT, in spite of following the recipe to a T. When I read some reader comments that Crisco had been reformulated about that time, I went out and bought hydrogenated, bad-for-you, grocery store brand shortening and tried a batch. Now THAT'S the chewy cookie I used to love! Thanks so much for helping me solve this mystery. For those of you trying this recipe for the first time, be sure you do not use shortening that is "0 transfat."

I have made these dozens of times. They are known in my circle of friends simply as "The Best Cookie Ever." It is not uncommon when looking forward to an event for a friend to ask "Are you bringing The Best Cookies Ever?" or to overhear at an event. "Have you tried these ginger cookies, yet? They're the best cookies ever." I generally triple the recipe because they go so fast (and a quadruple won't fit in the KitchenAid). I usually add a little extra candied ginger (about an extra quarter cup per recipe). Recently, I had some leftover lemon filling from Glittering Lemon Sandwich Cookies and used the filling to make lemon ginger sandwich cookies. That was a delightful twist. I'll probably try that again.

I started making these two Christmases ago, and while I always like to make new, untried baked goods every holiday season, these are the ones that I consistently receive requests for. They're easy and quick and absolutely delicious -- crispy outside, chewy inside. I bake them when I go to holiday parties, or to give to neighbors, and I have yet to meet anyone who doesn't want the recipe from me afterward. I haven't had trouble with the puffiness or crispiness, like some other people...but I use crisco from a tub and not a stick, for whatever that's worth, and follow the recipe exactly. I've only ever modified to add a bit more crystallized ginger. Protip: The Ginger People sell crystallized ginger chunks, and they are almost juicy, and have the best flavor of any I've tried. I always use those when I can get them!

Fantastic ginger cookies, I've started making these every Christmas. Everybody loves these. After some experimenting, here's how I get them to rise as pictured: I let the dough rest about 6 hours, if not overnight. After rolling, I chill a tray of them in the freezer for 2 minutes, right before I put them in the oven - perfect puffed up cookies every time (even after they cool)!

Rating: 4
I love these cookies, as does my entire family. They are the right combination of chewy and spicy. But I have never been able to get them to have that lovely puffy look like they do in the photo. They puff and crackle while baking, then flatten out. They're still scrumptious, though. I thought my cookies were flat because we live at 6,000 feet, but there might be more going on than high altitude.

Rating: 0
I haven't baked these yet, but wanted to comment about the trouble some people are having. Most vegetable shortening companies have changed their formulas to be "trans fat free", so that could be the source of your flat cookies. I know Crisco changed their formula again in 2012.

Rating: 1
I am so disappointed! I had high expectations after carefully reading the mostly rave reviews, and though some people had mentioned "pancake" cookies, I figured they must've make a mistake, so I went ahead with it anyway. And, of course, "pancake" cookies happened to me. I'm confused because I made the recipe exactly as written, even going out of my way to buy shortening (which I never use), and the cookies came out completely flat, gummy, and wet inside. As an experience baker, I am legitimately stumped.

Rating: 3
Hmm,not sure what's wrong here. I followed the recipe precisely but there's an issue. After 12 minutes they hadn't flattened out much nor had any cracks developed as in the photo. I gave them another 2 minutes and the bottoms were on the edge of burning, so they came out. They taste great but do not look nearly as nice. I'm a pretty accomplished home cook and even attended culinary school, so no idea what's going on. I am using a "new to me" oven so all I can guess is perhaps it's not calibrated correctly, although everything else I've cooked has been fine. Any suggestions/observations welcomed.

Rating: 4
Delicious spiced (but not overly spiced) flavor and a lovely firm but moist, chewy texture. I have used the following substitutions with great success: 1) a little less than 1/4 cup blackstrap molasses and a pinch extra brown sugar in lieu of light molasses 2) 1/2 cup butter and 1/4 cup vegetable oil in lieu of 1/2 cup shortening and 1/4 cup butter

Rating: 4
Everything a soft ginger cookie should be! Pure autumnal coziness... I had to double the batch as I found the first batch WAY too salty (and I like my salt). 10 grinds of black pepper too much, stick to 5 - it adds a nice heat. Chopped ginger was better than done in the food processor as it was nice to have little chunks of ginger for both flavour and texture. Way too much cloves for me too, so I added none when I made the second batch. Topped with chunky turbinado sugar. Yum :)

I have reviewed these cookies before, and am one that uses butter and not shortening. I cut out some of the fat initially (to 1/2 cup from 3/4 cup) and for years had no problems. Then I moved to a new town and a house with a gas stove and things started going south. When my most recent batch came up way runny I did some research. At my former home I had access to bakers cut ginger. Here, I have been using King Arthur ginger chips, and this was the last of a bag, so there was a lot of extra little pieces and extra sugar. I'm guessing that the extra sugar precipitated the flatness. Looking at other recipes, next time I'm going to cut back on butter (to 12 Tbl) and brown sugar (to 2/3 C) and see if that doesn't get me back to cookies that look like the ones in the picture.

Rating: 4
I just checked back here on the site to review this recipe, because I am noticing the exact same thing with my ginger spice cookies seeming flatter and crisper than they had when I made them so many times before. I too like the puffier, softer ginger cookie and mine used to look exactly like the photo for this recipe. I am waiting to see if there is any input from other bakers to see what is causing this problem

Rating: 4
These are a big favorite in my house! However, I am perplexed -- they used to come out just like the photo, but now they spread out flat and are more chewy than soft. Still delicious but we liked the original better. I can't figure out why the outcome has changed, I have always followed the recipe exactly. I use the Crisco sticks for shortening -- maybe their formulation has changed? I have checked that all my ingredients are fresh, chill the dough overnight, and have tried different cooking times to no avail. Any suggestions welcome. Next time I will try using all butter....

Rating: 4
fab recipe!! just my two cents regarding the butter versus shortening debate...i first tried all butter. good cookies, but missing chewy texture, more soft than chewy. then i used butter and shortening as per the recipe, added some ground pepper as some here have suggested, then rolled in turbonado sugar. now they were AMAZING! chewy on the inside with a sweet crunch on the outside. and dont forget the crystallized ginger!

I followed this recipe to the letter (first time actually using shortening) and they came out exactly like the picture...however, I sifted the flour first, chilled for 2 hours, and left out the candied/crystallized ginger for the second batch. found that they had more than ample kick without it. I also fluffed the dough by stirring between batches...made them fluffier. the only down side to this recipe is that you may be tempted to eat them yourself for dinner! perfect holiday recipe.

Rating: 4
The first time I made these they were really good. The second time, I made a half receipe but still used one egg (medium), and they were even better; lighter, and as soft. I did leave them in the fridge to chill a bit longer. A favorite here.

I made this recipe and thought the cookies were very good as the recipe lists. However, I have also made some slight modifications and found the cookie accommodates the changes well. My substitutions: - instead of cloves, I used nutmeg - doubled the amount of powdered ginger - used 1/2 as much molasses as recipe called for Found the recipe very easy to do. One of the times I made it, I was in a hurry, and using butter sticks that were cut differently than my normal brand, ended up accidentally using twice as much butter as I should have. This created a dough with a consistency more like chocolate chip cookie dough, but still tasted very good. Love these cookies and they have been collecting raves left & right!

Rating: 4
These are so good. I used all butter instead of the shortening. Also, I had some cinnamon sugar(made with a fine baking sugar) leftover from making snickerdoodles, so I first roled them in torbinado sugar, and then rolled them in the cinnamon sugar. Some people mentioned feeling that it was a lot of crystallized ginger, and too expensive. first of all, do not scrimp on the ginger, it is super yummy, also, I got mine in the bulk section of Whole Foods, so I was able to just buy what I needed which made it quite affordable.

I just made these again, using all coconut oil for a friend who can't have any dairy. They are just as good!

I thought these were very good cookies, but not exceptional. I made them by the recipe except I used coconut oil for the veggie shortening. The flavor was good, but not amazing - perhaps a little bland? I wanted the texture to be different too - they tasted a little dry, but the ones I baked for less time were a bit raw in the middle. Mine were on the small side; I'll try bigger next time. They made me place smell soooo good while they baked!

it was very easy to make this recipe vegan (containing no animal-derived ingredients) by substituting nondairy margarine for the unsalted butter and Ener-G brand egg replacer in lieu of the egg. because the margarine i used was salted, i reduced the salt slightly (1/2 tsp plus a pinch). The cookies were fantastic.

Best ginger cookies ever.

I made these gluten-free and they were totally amazing. Everyone raved and wanted the recipe. I substituted Pamela's Gluten-Free Baking and Pancake Mix for the flour, and reduced the recipe's salt and baking soda by 50% because they're already in the mix. The cookies come out flat no matter how long I chill the dough, but no one cares. I do pulse the crystalized ginger in the food processor with some of the baking mix. I also reversed the colors, using dark molasses and light brown sugar. Simply grand!

Rating: 4
These are amazing. I have lost track of the number of times I have made this recipe over the years, but I can tell you I get compliments every single time. I like the idea of freezing the dough, because it does make a lot. It is important to mince the crystallized ginger by hand. I use all butter, and they turn out beautifully. I am surprised at the comments about them flattening too much. Maybe don't squish the balls down so much and shorten the cooking time?

Rating: 4
A favorite in our house. The dough freezes well so you can bake just a few at a time. Go with all butter and chill overnight. Cold dough minimizes the spreading as well as the shortening. Cooking time goes down as the dough warms and your pans warm. I think it has almost enough ginger but I love ginger.

Rating: 3
Yum! I made small cookies, not so grand in looks, but the recipe can go a long way for a party. I filled some with chocolate chips, tucking a few inside when forming the balls, yum again! I am a ginger freak and will use more next time. Can't wait to play with this recipe- I'm thinking orange zest and/or cardamom....

Excellent recipe but like others, I ended up with pancakes rather than thicker robust cookies. However the flavor is amazing. One time: Make sure you dice the ginger quite fine as even in the cooking process, you can end up with a chunk and it might be a tad "hot".

Very good recipe. Just to compare, I divided the batter into to two and did not roll the second half in sugar, and liked it a lot more. Also, I skipped candied ginger as I did not have any, and did not miss it at all. I noticed that 10 minutes was enough baking time in my oven.

I try to make these every year because they are just amazing. This year (for some odd reason) I added the salt for the first and last time. These cookies have so many fantastic flavors that the salt distracts from the goodness. I will make them again and again, however. :-)

Yummy! Can't wait to make them again. Tried the food processor short-cut for the Ginger pieces but mine processed to a sticky paste. Worked just fine though but next time I'll just chop the ginger.

These are fantastic! Word of warning: my first batch came out flat as pancakes and turned into a mono-cookie -- the dough needs longer than an hour in the fridge to adequately cool down. (I left my second batch in overnight and they came out perfectly.) I tried using the food processor on the ginger and found that, even with a little flour, it turned into a fibrous mush. Take the time to cut it by hand, it does not take that long and it is worth it. You've got to make these!!

I've made these cookies following the recipe exactly several times and they are always amazing. Today I didn't have any shortening on hand, so tried them with all butter. I'm usually not a shortening person, but this recipe is better with the shortening. They're chewier and they look better too. If you really don't want to use shortening though, they're still good without it. I've also tried adding a little extra flour, chilling for longer, and rolling these out to shape with cookie cutters. It works great.

This is the best ginger cookie recipe out there! This is not my opinion alone though. I get requests for these cookies and these cokies alone.

These cookies have been favorites in our house for decades. I like to substitute virgin coconut oil for the shortening as it is far better for us and it tastes superb. You can find the coconut oil in many supermarkets now and at almost all health food stores. It adds a wonderful flavor.

First of all I make my own brown sugar by food processing sugar with molasses. Secondly, I also processed the crystallized ginger with the sugar to make the pieces smaller.I also have no access to shortening, so for the whole recipe I used butter. My grandson loves them.

Rating: 4
Overall, a great cookie recipe. I did make a few changes though. Because my dark brown sugar had turned into a brick and there was a huge storm outside, I used regular white sugar. I also used 1.25 sticks of butter instead of the vegetable shortening and the butter. I also did not include the crystallized ginger. The textures of the cookies were great but they were so soft causing them to fall apart easily. With the slight flaw of the texture, the cookies had a great flavor. The spices worked perfectly. There is no doubt that I am making these cookies again.

Rating: 4
I made these again this weekend and I stand corrected about using more ginger. I used a different type of crystallized ginger and it was too overpowering. The first time I made it I used the bottled McCormick, which is fairly mild. This time, I used a crystallized ginger that was in much larger chunks and was very hot. Can't recall what the brand was, but it was in a small box and purchased at Whole Foods. I recommend the McCormicks by far.

Rating: 4
So. Amazingly. Good. I followed the recipe with the exception of the crystallized ginger. My bottle of crystalled ginger only had about 2/3 cup, so I was a tad short. To be honest, I had never used crystallized ginger before and was worried even the smaller 2/3 cups would be too overpowering. No worries....the amount I used was good, but more ginger would have been fantastic. The crystallized ginger is so subtle, but essential. My oven temp is zeroed in perfectly and 12 minutes was perfect. The cookies came out fluffy, cracked and soft. We devoured them. I highly recommend these.

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious. I did not chop an entire 3/4 c. of ginger, in fear that it would be too much, but next time I will add the full amount. Also, as I did not have ground cloves, I used ground allspice, and it was fine. My cookies were not as "fluffy" as the ones in the photo--not sure why. Anyone have any ideas? Will surely make again.

Used butcher's lard instead of shortening and chilled dough overnight. Came out great. To size balls by weight 22g is about right or 25g if you want them a little larger.

Best Cookies ever, hands down. I've never had anyone try them and not want the recipe. Couple of things: don't worry about using shortening, use all butter instead. Also, refrigerating for 4 hours is a MUST in order for these cookie to look anything like the picture (otherwise, they just spread all out. Still taste good, but not as pretty). Add a whole cup of chopped ginger-it's worth it.

To the cook in Washington, DC you can get uncrystallized candied ginger (no sugar on top) and crystazllized candied ginger at Trader Joe's for a little over a $1 a bag. I actually have people bring me bags of the stuff. I live on Maui. No Trader Joe's here! ENJOY! I have made this recipe and love the uncrystallized candied ginger chunks, really makes the cookie. I always add EXTRA cinnamon. I get the cinnamon from Costco...SAIGON CINNAMON (from Vietnama)...that is amazing...only $4 for a HUGE container! UNBELIEVABLE is all I can say. Enjoy!

I have made these cookies successfully for years. They consistently turn out well and I have been asked for this recipe many times. However, I just made them substituting butter for Crisco. Bad idea! (I used 1/2 cup plus 2 T) They turned out thin and crispy as opposed to thick and chewy. Stick with shortening/butter combo and you will have great results.

This recipe is excellent - tastes like bakery style cookies! The only change I made was instead of rolling the cookie dough in granulated sugar, I used sugar in the raw to get that bakery feel.

This is the second time I've made these cookies, and they turned out very well. Nice and chewy! The first time, I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I coated the cookies with Turbinado sugar and the sugar left over from the crystallized ginger. This time I could not obtain shortening, so I used all unsalted butter (a little less than 3/4 c total). I used the Swedish product "ljus sirap" in place of molasses, and candied ginger ("syltede ingefær" in Danish) instead of crystallized. I chilled the dough for 4 hours and the cookies were not too flat. I coated them with "rørsukker" (Danish) and I only lightly packed the brown sugar. I used 5 twists of black pepper but it was not detectable; next time will use 10.

I made these cookies for our board gaming group and they ate every single one of them. I used the recipe as is with one small change.

I have been making this recipe for two years now and always get asked for the recipe. But, until yesterday, I've always made the cookies with light brown sugar. Yesterday I tried dark brown sugar as the recipe calls for, and I didn't like how the cookies came out as much. Also, in the picture, they look like they used light brown sugar: with light brown sugar, the cookies are caramel colored, with dark brown sugar, they look more like molasses colored. Also, one other change I make it to lessen the crystalized ginger to 1/2 cup (and chop it finely) and use all butter instead of a combo of butter and veg shortening. Ultimatley, though, prepare for lots of people asking you for the recipe for this cookie.

I LOVE these cookies. They're my new favorite. I think they're even better than gingerbread cookies. I made them for Christmas along with gingerbread cookies and my family went crazy over these! I followed some of the other reviewer's suggestions- put the crystalized ginger to shop it up in the food processor, which was perfect. I made them with Pamela's pancake and waffle mix (gluten-free) since one of the people at our Christmas party can't have gluten or dairy due to Celiac disease- so used margarine and a tiny bit of butter. My cookies didn't rise as much as the picture and were really chewy but I liked them that way. Definitely try making these cookies, you won't be disappointed!

I just made these cookies over the holidays, and they are a hit! I doubled the ingredients, and still can't meet demand - I made them exactly as indicated on the instructions, and they are soft, chewy, and very ginger tasting. Not only that, but the softness of the cookie lasts as well; meaning other recipes I have made in the past, the cookie is soft, but even when kept in an air tight container, they turn to crisps soon after. Not this recipe! What was left over of the few remaining cookies (5 day old cookies) are still as soft and chewy as the day I made them - melt in your mouth. This is definitely the best ginger cookie recipe I have come across. I wouldn't make any substitutions or amendments; I made them exactly as indicated. This is a keeper!!!

These cookies are delicious. My brother has never liked ginger cookies- and is not a fan of sweets generally but he asks me to make these over and over. The crystallized ginger lends a great, chewy consistency without overwhleming the flavor. The cookies spread best when dough is refrigerated for 3 hours or so- more than an hour but not overnight. If I go too crazy with the sugar dipping it will melt and burn onto the pan as the cookies bake...

These turned out exactly like the picture. They flavor was ginger-y but not too spicy/more sweet. Perfect. The crystallized ginger I purchased was in large pieces that needed to be chopped. It stuck together as I chopped it and didn't incorporate nicely into the flour mixture, but I solved this by putting the crystallized ginger in my food processor with the flour mixture (1st 6 ingredients). This whipped it around enough to sufficiently chop the ingredients but also to combine with the dry mixture evenly.

These are my favorite and most requested cookie - LOVE this recipe. To the person who substituted the crystalized and ground ginger because they have not taste, may I suggest getting fresh spices from a spice house instead of the stuff that sits on grocery store shelves for way too long - the fresh ground ginger makes ALL the difference.

great cookies. better with all butter than with butter+shortening. freshly ground cloves make them spicier

I am not a fan off overly sweet cookies, so these spice cookies are definitely my new favorite. Since my boyfriend is allergic to wheat products, I made them using Pamela's Baking and Pancake Mix, which is an excellent, easy to use gluten free mix made of brown and white rice flour, almond meal, and a few other wheat-free ingredients (I use this for all my baking anymore and like it better than wheat flour). Anyway, I followed other reviewers suggestions and cut back the brown sugar a bit, added a pinch of cayenne pepper, about 5 or so turns of fresh ground black pepper, and a full cup of chopped crystalized ginger. I also refrigerate overnight (a must with gluten free cookie dough) and bake for about 11 minutes on ungreased, insulated cookie sheets.

These are delicious cookies! Shortening wasn't available to me so I used an equal amount of butter +2 tablespoons. I used flaky kosher salt and upped the salt to one teaspoon. Don't overdo the packed brown sugar. I packed way too much, but I suspect the recommended one cup is just perfect. About the baking: After my first batch expanded ridiculously, I baked subsequent batches in muffin tins. 3/4 inch ball in each hole. Perfectly round cookies! The sugar dipping makes them sparkly and great.

A exceptional cookie! Plus, it is easy to make. Spicy and soft/chewy: it is a great autumn and winter cookie.

A delicious cookie - sweet, a little salty and definitely spicy. I refrigerated a little longer than an hour, and used raw cane sugar to roll the cookies in instead of granulated white sugar. Made a nicer crunch for the cookie, better for you, and looked beautiful. Easy and great!

I followed this recipe exactly as written, except substituted 1/2 c. of the white flour with whole wheat. I made them on the small side to serve with tea. Amazing! They are still soft and delicious several days later. Next time I will try 1 c. whole wheat flour and 1 c white flour.

Love these cookies - and so easy. I am a novice in the kitchen but decided to make 400 of these cookies as my party gift at my wedding. Put the batter in the fridge overnight and made smaller sized cookies. They were a great hit and I will be making them again (just not as many at one time!)

This is the ginger cookie of my dreams. Chewy, dense, and spicy. If you're looking for a ginger snap this isn't it - but if you're looking for a lovely soft cookie, this is the one. Followed the recipe as written except refrigerated the dough for about 4 hours as another reviewer suggested. I also used Spectrum Organic vegetable shortening - not sure how it would turn out with a different brand. Delicious!

These are hands down the best cookies I have ever made. I used all butter -- no shortening -- and maple syrup in place of molasses.

I used salted margarine* in place of unsalted butter and reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp. Instead of the egg, I used Ener-G egg replacer in the amount suggested on the box to replace one egg. The results were absolutely fantastic! If anyone would like to make the recipe vegan for themselves or a vegan friend, or just to make them a little healthier (no cholesterol, less saturated fat, etc), I recommend doing them the way I did. I used Earth Balance "buttery sticks" margarine and Spectrum organic shortening, both of which contain no animal-derived ingredients and are free of hydrogenated oils/trans fats as well. Great recipe!

I've been making these since the recipe first appeared on the website and they never fail to please the crowd. I've made a few changes. I eliminated the shortening; I use unsulphured molasses; I always use dark brown molasses sugar; and I use a bit less of the ground cloves than are called for in the recipe. Thank you to the cook who suggested a longer chill time for fluffier cookies. I've been having trouble with that since I moved to a warmer, more humid climate. I will try your suggestion next batch.

Best ginger cookie I've ever eaten.

Rating: 4
Delicious, but I made some changes to make them more intense and more chewy/tough. I like to tear into cookies and wanted a chewy one that wasn't the classic, fluffy moist cookie. So here is my recipe. 2 c flour, 2 tsp ground ginger, 2tsp baking soda,1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp cloves, 1/2 tsp cayenne, 10 turns ground black pepper (1/4 - 1/2 tsp), 1 tsp zested fresh ginger, 3/4 tsp salt, 1/3 c granulated sugar, 2/3 cup dark brown sugar, 3/4 - 1 cup chopped crystalized ginger (se Reed's if you can find it, 1/2 c melted butter and 1 egg. I used this recipe to make gingerbread men. I found that it worked best if I rolled the dough out to 3/8 of oan inch, as the expand a lot. This helped them keep their shape a little better. Still, you must leave more space that you might guess between the cookies to ensure that they dont become deformed.

They key to cookies that aren't flat is to chill the dough. One hour isn't nearly long enough. Overnight is ideal, 4 or 5 hours minimum. I make these a couple times a year and we love them.

I should also add that I didn't have light molasses, so I used dark. I didn't have quite enough to make 1/4 of a cup, so I made up the difference with honey. I wasn't expecting them to be so wonderful with those changes but they were fantastic.

These have been my Christmas cookies for years now and am always given a lot of praise. I think the recipe is perfect as written. The only changes I make are very minor-- I prefer to make them a little smaller and therefore cut the cooking time by a minute or two. I also roll them in coarse suger.

Delicious cookies and very easy to make. I used butter rather vegetable shortening and they came out very very well. I also made two batches and that yielded roughly 100 although I made my cookies rather small. My kitchen smells wonderful.

Listened to reviewers and used 1/2 cp butter and 1/4 cp shortening. Added the black pepper. Good flavor, but flat as a pancake, did not resemble the picture at all.Presentation is important to me and I was dissapointed with these...an ugly cookie. perhaps I will try again without changing the butter/shortening ratio

Rating: 4
A follow-up review - it's still the best ginger cookie recipe out there. I use only 1/2 cup butter, and no shortening. I found that by making them smaller (3/4" to scant 1") in size and baking for 10 minutes, they look exactly like the picture - though smaller of course. They also retain the great crisp/chewy texture. Naturally the yield is doubled by this method. While that might be better in theory for the waistline, in practice it doesn't hold - you just eat more of the gingery little morsels. A classic to be enjoyed for years!

These are every bit as excellent as everyone says. My son loves the molasses cookies at Starbuck's, and without the ginger bits (we had none on hand) these tasted similar, but better. I even overcooked them a bit and they were still delicious! Too bad they were all gone the first day...

I made these last night and agree with all the prior reviews. These cookies are great! They have a very strong ginger flavor, which gives it a kick.

If you're looking for a spicy ginger cookie, this is it! Most don't have enough ginger for me. I do use all butter...no shortening and add an extra 1/4 c. flour to compensate for that. I also add the a couple of grinds of fresh pepper...as suggested by another reviewer. I put the crystallized ginger in my mini food processor with some of the flour to mince it really small....Absolutely my favorite...just the right bite, crisp on outside, a bit soft on the inside. Timing the baking is important!

Rating: 4
Excellent - the reviews say it all. Mine turned out a little flatter than the ones in the picture, but I see that others had the same problem and that it could be due to using all butter instead of butter and shortening. I think I'll make them smaller next time - that might help!

I had never made a ginger cookie before, but my husband loves them, so I decided to give it a try. Instead of trying the basic recipe, I combined a few changes which had been suggested by previous reviews and WOW - what a fabulous spicy/substantial cookie I got! Here's what I changed: 1)used 2t ground ginger + 1t grated fresh ginger, 2)used 1C crystallized ginger, 3)used 3/4C butter-no shortening and 4)added a few turns of fresh ground black pepper and 1/4t cayenne - FABULOUS!!! Everyone who tried them loved them and they were gone in a flash! Perfect texture and looked just like the picture, but get ready, they've got a bite!

I do a lot of baking, though not cookies very often. I thought these cookies very easy to make, and very much worth making. Very delicious! Do allow time for the dough to rest, and leave plenty of room between cookies on the baking sheet. Great with a cup of tea or cocoa. I made the recipe as written, they surprisingly did look just like the picture, but I didn't get a yield of 30 cookies, just about 25. Perhaps I made them too large. If you're not sure of the timing, just look for the cracking on the top, and err on the side of under- vs over-baking. For the added ginger flavor I had in the freezer "ginger chips" sold by the King Arthur Baking Co. I don't know if these are technically crystallized ginger or not, but they definitely added flavor and texture without being hard like a nut. Next time I might try the black pepper, more butter vs shortening, and/or orange zest enhancements. Great cookie!

Excellent ginger cookie recipie. The cookies are a bit chewy on the outside and nicely soft on the inside. They taste like a very good gingersnap cookie. I'd like to think that in addition to the crystallized ginger enhancing the flavor of these cookies, that it makes them somewhat healthy(?!).

I've made these cookies every holiday season for the past few years and they are always a hit, both with family in Indianapolis and friends and colleagues in Los Angeles. I've found that the dough is easiest to work with when chillled overnight, and that a 10 min. cooking time makes them come out perfect. Otherwise I stick to the recipe as written, and I get those beautiful crinkles that look like the picture and a soft, chewy, yummy cookie. Enjoy!

Wow! I just made these as my last batch of Xmas cookies and am I glad I did. I also used 1/2 cup butter instead of the shortening. I also reduced the powdered ginger to 2 teaspoons and used 1 teaspoon of fresh grated ginger. I added another 1/4 cup of crystallized ginger. The cooking time was right on. The cookies are hard on outside and a little chewy inside. PERFECT. Also the ginger taste was perfect. You must make these. I can't keep my hands out of the cookie jar!!!

I tried out these cookies yesterday. I was very pleased with the dough. This cookies actually did look like the picture. I didn't have any problems with them being runny. The crystalized ginger makes these cookies that ingredient is a must have. I used another reviewer suggestion of switching the butter and shortening I thought that sounded like a good idea. Will definately make these cookies again.

I'm a big ginger fan and loved these cookies. I thought they might be too much for the "general public", but I took them to two parties in the last week and have gotten rave reviews! In fact I'm baking a second batch this morning because I've run out of them. Please don't leave out the crystallized ginger as suggested by an earlier reviewer- that is what distinguishes these cookies from the boring grocery store variety ginger snap. Several people commented on the "real" ginger in them. I used 1/2 cup butter and NO shortening and they came out great. I only baked for 10 minutes. They look just like the picture and did not spread out too much (as another earlier reviewer commented). For convenience I made up the batter before I went to bed last night and refrigerated overnight. The dough was much easier to work with. I also only took enough out of fridge for one baking sheet at a time.

These are the BEST ginger cookies ever!!! My husband suggested I post a wee warning to you all... space these well, as they will melt into one another (as did our first batch)... two inches apart is not too far apart; I only placed 6 cookies on my smaller cookie sheets, with fantastic results... and as another suggested, I swithced the butter and shortening amounts to be ½ cup butter & ¼ cup shortening. Be sure they come out after 12 minutes or they will burn, and carefully take them off the cookie sheet and get them on a cooling rack within the first minute of cooling. They will be very hard to resist even though they will be very hot... and they will be very delicious! A definite keeper!!! YUM!!!

These are easy and delicious. We were a little short on the amount of crystallized ginger but I'm glad. They are REALLY strong-flavored cookies and I am a fan of strong flavors generally. I was actually surprised our toddler ate them on account of the spice, but he loves them. I would leave out the crystallized ginger or cut down the amount next time but will use this recipe as my go-to ginger cookie recipe in the future.

Excellent, excellent, excellent! I have made these several times and the only adjustment I make is to use all butter instead of shortening.

Next time I'll try rolling only some of them in sugar; my first batch was pretty sweet. They took longer than 12 minutes to cook, maybe because I used double-layer cookie sheets.

These are the perfect cookies for this time of year and also for those people that don't like very sweet desserts. I made them with out the crystalized ginger, because I didn't have any, and they turned out great. Served them with the apples and cheese and they were the hit of the party. There were lots of other desserts as well, but these were all gone. Made them once before with the crystalized ginger and they were awesome, but if you don't have any, they still turn out wonderful! Make them exactly as written to get the perfect texture - that includes the shortening!

used 115gms of baking margarine in place of the shortening/butter here and the cookies came out realy crisp. the taste is good and i also used pancake syrup instead of mapel and it seemed fine. maybe i will take them out of the oven sooner to get a bit softer cookie.

Used full stick of butter (sans shortening) and added a bit of orange zest. Rolled in raw sugar for extra crunch. Did not have cloves so used fresh ground pepper instead. Nice crust on outside with a soft, chewy center. Flavorful and delicious. Easy and fun to make. The crystallized ginger, chopped finely, kind of "dissolves" into the cookie and gives a wonderful texture as well as flavor.

Can't find molasses in Costa Rica as well. I used 1/3 part palm sugar to 2/3 parts dark corn syrup to equal 1/4c of molasses. To those who use all butter instead of recommended mix of shortening: The cookies will be more buttery but also crisper. The recommended mix imparts a chewier and softer cookie but still has butter flavor.

These are easily the best ginger cookies. I always up the ginger to 3 t. and since I like mine a little spicy I also add 1/2 t. cayanne pepper. If I omit the cayanne pepper I'll add finey zested rind of 1/2 an orange. The orange flavor goes great with these cookies. To ensure the crystallized ginger gets mixed in well, I mince it it stead of chopping, that way every taste has a sweet-hot ginger bite! Enjoy!

Wow. I love ginger cookies...and these are amazing. I think this recipe now trumps all others. The candied ginger is a great touch. And to the person who asked about what she could do to keep her cookies from flattening out because of the altitude: add additional flour to the dough. I go back and forth between Hawaii and Colorado and I can see the difference in the way recipes come out between the two areas. I have found that adding more flour to cookie dough works well. Good luck!

These came out flatter than pancakes. I used 1 stick of butter as many suggested, and skipped the candied ginger, but followed the recipe otherwise. After the first batch I turned the heat down to 325 which kept the cookies more rounded for half the baking time, then they collapsed as well. Maybe they need adjustment for altitude, although I never do for other cookie recipes. Taste good, look like store-bought. Any suggestions on the flattening welcome.

These are terrific. I also replaced the shortening with butter, and added no additional fat--instead, I added 2-3 T of spicy pear butter for moisture. I've done this twice, and they come out crunchy on the edges, and chewy in the middle. The first time I added maybe 8 grinds of black pepper, and the second time I left it out--much better with the pepper. And both times I've made this I haven't had candied ginger, so I grated in an inch and a half of fresh--yum! Rolling these in Muscovado sugar makes them to die for. So pretty, and the crunch of sugar is a great contrast with the kick.

Rating: 4
YUM!!! Definately a keeper. I followed previous advice and replaced butter for shortening and no additional butter. I used light brown sugar and would keep it this way in the future. I added all of the sugared ginger I had on hand (approx. 1 cup unchopped) and this seemed a good amount in the recipe. Also, next time I would add a tsp of white pepper for an additional punch of spice. I doubled the recipe because I was making it for a party I was catering and the recipe says it makes 30 cookies, which wasn't nearly enough. Since they are so spicey I made them smaller and definately think this is the way to go and looks so much prettier on a plate. They easily made 100 cookies doubled, so I guess I'll have extra's for family and friends (which isn't a bad thing). By the way, I baked my cookies for 10 minutes each and they came out wonderfully cracked, crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and looking picture perfect.

Very gingery and spicy. Made with all butter (no shortening) and are much flatter than expected. Okay for adults but too spicy for kids.

These are easily the best ginger cookies I have ever had. I used all butter instead of shortening and dark molasses, and also added a few grinds of black pepper to up the spiciness, and they were fantastic. A really excellent texture.

Really great cookie although I used all butter instead of shortening which made the cookies a little flat. Great for around the holidays!

So delicious. My mother and I went out for coffee the other day and spent $1.50 for a big version of this same cookie! She annouced she would have to learn to make them, but I beat her to it with this great recipe. I too made the butter change, as listed in previous reviews. So GOOD. I didn't even have a measuring cup handy, I can't imagine how devine they would be if properly measured!

These cookies are amazing. I've been trying to find a recipe for a ginger spice cookie as good as the ginger cookie that Starbucks carries (the only reason I ever go there) - and these are MUCH better. They are very easy to make too. The only reason I am not rating this 4 forks is because I made changes to the recipe, based on other reviewers and my own lack of ingredients. First off - substituting butter for the shortening is A MUST. I used only 1/2 cup unsalted butter as a replacement for both the shortening and butter in the recipe. A buttery taste still came through in the cookies, and I absolutely refuse to bake with shortening so this is key for me. Secondly, because I didn't have enough crystallized ginger, I used 1/4 cup crystallized ginger, 1 large knob of grated fresh ginger and an additional 1/2 tsp of ground ginger. Thirdly, I baked the cookies for only 10 min instead of 12 min. I would make the exact same changes again, as I think 3/4 cup of candied ginger would be too much. Having said all that, a FANTASTIC recipe, goes well with a rainy November night and a glass of cold milk. But really, I'd take it any time... Happy baking. :)

The flavor was way over the top. It left an aftertaste that lingered. I will try adding a small amount of crystalized ginger finely chopped to my standard ginger cookie recipe though.

I am a HUGE fan of ginger cookies - make them every year for the holidays - this is by far and away the best recipe I've found to date. I doubled the recipe and brought them to the office - they were gone in record time! (they're great with lemon glaze - 1/2 cup powdered sugar and juice of one lemon)

Rating: 4
The best ginger snaps EVER! I am a HUGE ginger fan and have made a lot of ginger cookies, cakes, etc. and this is absolutely the best. Made them several times and they do not last. Send them as gifts, etc and all is forgiven. I didn't have crystalized ginger, so I grated a large knob of peeled fresh in the dough...mmmmmmmm. The relatively large amt of soda and salt keep them from being too sweet and add depth. Also, I really love spice, so I used 1.5x the amounts, AND added .5 tsp cayenne and black pepper each. Rolled in sugar but added cinnamon candies on top--killer taste. Nobody could tell about the pepper and everybody loved them, with milk to help with the heat. A MUST save for the recipe file!

I was trying to interpret cookies that I bought at the One of a Kind show $10 for 12 cookies!! These are definetly it. Substituted the butter as recommended, but also used 2 cups of unbleached, organic spelt flour instead of all purpose. Rolled cookies in organic cane sugar. Fantastic results. These should freeze well (but won't last).

I made these yesterday and they're delicious. I can't stop eating them. I omitted the shortening and made them with 1/2 cup butter as suggested by some other reviewers, but I found that the cookies did not spread much - they were like little mounds. Still tasted great, but next time I will make them as per the recipe. The crystallized ginger is a must - it's what gives this recipe 4 forks instead of 3.

I have been looking for this type of ginger cookie recipe - soft, spicy, and chewy - for years. This is it!! These looked and tasted fantastic. I followed the advice of a previous reviewer and substituted butter for the shortening (and then omitted the other 1/4 cup of butter). I am so happy to have found this recipe!!!

Rating: 4
Delicious and addictive! I had to make a few changes ... decreased the sugar by almonst 1/2, a little less butter (no shortening), fresh ginger instead of dried, a mixture of honey, maple syrup and blackstrap molasses. I rolled them in vanilla sugar. They spread out a lot, much more than planned so leave lots of room in between them. I'll be making them again soon.

I love spicy food of all kinds, so I expected to like these, and U did. I didn't have crystallized ginger, so omitted that, but followed the recipe in all other respects. I took a few cookies to a relative with a very picky sweet tooth, and she is still talking about them! Perfect dunking cookies.

Rating: 4
i followed the recipe except for: adding zest of two large oranges, currants, used honey instead of molasses, and rolled them in coconut instead of sugar, oh! the most important part, i made my own version of crystalized ginger, by grating low fiber ginger and coating it in sugar-loads of sugar. the cookies were incredible!!!

Clarification: substitute 1/2 cup butter for the shortening, and drop the additional 1/4 cup of butter.

Rating: 4
I make these for gatherings, and they routinely get rave reviews. I made some changes to the basic receipe. The first was to simply eliminate the shortening - the cookies bake up softer. Second, I halved the amount of cloves called for, as I found the clove taste overpowering the other flavors. Third, I always use the darkest brown sugar available - Muscovado or Billingtons Molasses sugar. Finally, rolling them in turbinado sugar before baking gives them a bit of crunch to go with the soft cookie.

Rating: 3
Before you jump all over me for rating a recipe I changed, I did the rating for two reasons. First, these are really delicious (the description of 3 forks), secondly, it appears that this "new and improved" website calculates all comments as negatives, so when someone simply makes a statement, and doesn't rate, it says 0% would make again! I don't want to skew the numbers badly on this one. That said, I substituted applesauce for the shortening, used light brown sugar, and used 1 cup unbleached all purpose flour, 3/4 cup whole wheat, and 1/4 cup soy flour. I was generous with the chopped (coarsly) crystallized ginger as well. For all you in the Milwaukee area, Outpost Food Coop carries it in their bulk section, and it is wonderful. I will definitely repeat these, with the same substitutions. They taste like something from the neighborhood coffee shop!

After reading all the gushing reviews I decided to make a double batch, which was good since I made them a little big. I found (8 oz) crystallized ginger for $2.49 at Trader Joe's and sad saw smaller slivered crystallized ginger (4oz) at Sur La Table for $2.95. Unfortunately, I only found dark molasses at the market. And my dark brown sugar (from Trader Joe's) was also made from molasses, which maybe was too much of that flavor. Though I was prepared to love these above all other cookies after such rave reviews, I was a bit disappinted. Even though I measured carefully, the baking soda flavor seems strong to me. What I DO love, it the flavor the crystallized ginger adds(though chopping it all took took awhile), and that they were so fluffy and chewy! Mom and gran didn't like that at all (snaps or bust?), but sis and I prefered it. I think I'll try again, but not until I find light/mild molasses! Also, I didn't think it was too sweet rolled in regular sugar, but will use Sugar in the Raw next time.

This is a wonderful recipe for ginger cookies! Don't skip on the crystallized ginger -- it sets these cookies apart from the others.

This is an excellent recipe for ginger cookies. Like some of the other reviewers, I baked the cookies for slightly less time to ensure their chewiness (note: they don't look completely baked at 10 to 11 minutes but they set up within minutes.) And don't skip the crystallized ginger; it really sets these cookies apart from other ginger cookies.

Rating: 3
Well received. After the first batch, I baked them about a minute less so they would be a little chewier. The crystallized ginger is a really nice touch.

Best ginger cookie EVER. I use all butter, and I found if you make them smaller than called for, you still get the pretty, cracked, pouffy appearance with no trans fats added. The second time I made them, I left the dough in the 'fridge overnight, and the cookies fell while baking. They turned out flat, but still had the same delectable taste and texture (crisp/chewy). If you really like ginger, you should love these.

I have made this recipe several times and it's always a holiday favorite. It's seemingly foolproof and the cookies always turn out perfect - beautifully round with a glistening, crackled top, and they taste fantastic. I had to leave the dough in the fridge overnight once and they still turned out great, although they needed an extra minute of cooking time. Incredibly chewy and they keep well too. If you like anything about this recipe, you might want to make double.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE! I made these cookies for Christmas and we loved them! I like that they are chewy. I made my own crystallized ginger b/c it was so expensive and I rolled them in red sugar for a more holiday looking cookie. If you make them a bit bigger and cook them at the same cooking time as indicated, they will flatten out more and be more crisp like a gingersnap. EXCELLENT!

Loved these cookies, and so did my 10-year old son. Had to triple the recipe for a Christmas cookie exchange, and was a bit concerned about the price of the crystallized ginger (it cost me $9 a bottle and I needed 3 - 4+ bottles when tripling the recipe). After eating them, I felt that the cookies were worth it.

These were a big hit with the ginger freaks in my household, excellent taste, lovely to look at. I'd definitely recommend the turbinado sugar (aka sugar in the raw) to coat the dough before baking - great finishing touch. Also used the dark molasses - they tasted great nonetheless. A bit less than 12 minutes helps to keep them chewy.

these cookies are amazing - REALLY chewy. definitely do not cook them for any longer than 12 minutes or they're husks. also, I feel I should mention that the dough (once the dry ingredients are just combined) is a bit crumbly - wet hands are a must. otherwise these babies are ginger genius, enjoy!

Great cookie!! Only one problem. My husband said "These cookies should be illegal. They're addictive". After reading the other reviews I doubled the batch. That was two days ago and now I'm making them again. I cut the brown sugar by 1/4 cup and I used Dynasty Sugar Ginger from the oriental section in Safeway. I pulsed the ginger in my processor for 1 min. The first time around I slightly pressed down the dough to flatten it, but I found that it didn't crack on top as much. I also rolled the balls of dough in Turbinado sugar (large crystals) which made it prettier. This cookie is a keeper and already placed in my "Great Recipes" file. Don't pass this one up.

Delicious! Had a little difficulty figuring out the correct amount of butter/shortening to use (not familiar with "stick" measurement.

May try "hot" ginger for a little extra zing next time.

I like ginger, so I thought these cookies perfect. I would cut down on the cinnamon and cloves next time. Underbake slightly for a melting, chewy cookie. I kept the dough in the fridge and baked a few at a time over the course of a week so that I had fresh warm cookies with my tea. Yum. Yum.

Lost count how many times I've made these. My father loves store-bought gingersnaps, but these became his favorites as soon as I found the recipe in the March issue so many years ago. My mother requests them often and I bring them to her oftener. In fact when asked what she wanted for Christmas gifts this year, she said, "your ginger cookies." Don't substitute ingredients. Chef's knife and scissors both worked well for chopping ginger. If you can't wait the hour in the fridge, instead of rolling, drop by spoonfuls into sugar to coat completely, and reduce cooking time to 8 or so minutes. Keep a watch and take out just as soon as they are cracked. I've even frozen these to take on holiday trips. Rave review and many requests for the recipe.

I've made these the past 2 years to bring down to my in-laws and they are always gone by the end of the weekend! The chewy inside coupled with the spice of the crystallized ginger makes this the best ginger cookie I've ever tasted! Follow the recipe - it's perfect as is!

Proud guardian of old family recipes, my Swedish grandmother was quite convinced of the supremacy of pepparkakor--delicate, spicy, Scandinavian cookies--in the ginger cookie family.

I've always liked ginger cookies but have never really found any recipes that I was "wild" about. Now I have! They really are scrumptious and, to my surprise, they disappear incredibly fast! The best part about them is: they are SO EASY. (Note: if you have trouble finding the crystallized ginger, try Trader Joe's... they always have it). These are soft and chewy but have the perfect amount of crispiness. These cookies are very spicy - with terrific ginger/butter flavor. The ONLY change I made was reducing the shortening to 1/4 C and using a whole stick of butter. That, and I used Baker's Sugar for rolling the cookies. Other than that, I followed the recipe to the letter. Now my only dilemma seems to be choosing between my old favorite (double, dark chocolate chip pecan cookies) and these little numbers. Oh...and these are wonderful w/ hot chocolate or, even better, a nice hot cup of tea. I'm looking at the last one right now..... (it's a gonner!) :-D

I decided to make these yesterday during our snowstorm - they were absolutely fabulous! The texture, size, and taste made for the perfect combination to delight the senses, and they will definitely become a staple of my fall/winter baking efforts. For those of you who have trouble knowing where to find crystallized ginger, I agree with previous posters who suggested either Trader Joe's or any Asian foods store. In a pinch, check your supermarket's spice section, as I have also found that McCormick offers it in a bottle in their designated spice racks.

These cookies are my favorite! I receive rave reviews from everyone who tastes them and many requests for the recipe. They are easy to make too!

These are excellent, though not as spicy as I expected from the reviews. I used all butter and cut the brown sugar by 2 T., and used coarse turbinado sugar for rolling, which gave a beautiful look and a nice crunch on the top. They were still a bit sweet for my taste, so next time I'll cut the brown sugar by 1/4 cup.

There cookies taste very similar to gingersnaps, but are so good when they are fresh and chewy. They were very popular at Thanksgiving dinner.

These are great cookies. I rolled them in a mixture of coase white sugar and orange sugar for a Fall open house

Everyone LOVES these cookies. Worth your time to seek out the crystallized ginger. Delightful with cheddar cheese and apples as recommended.

Delicious! Thanks to other users of Epicurious, I knew exactly where to get crystallized ginger (Trader Joe's). I imagine you could find it at an Asian food store as well. These cookies are great. I used a sharp knife to chop the ginger. It was simple.

Regarding the crystallized ginger, I've tried a number of chopping methods and found that a mezzaluna yields the best results. It gives you control over the size of the pieces and you won't end up with lots of ginger under your fingernails. I love these cookies!!!

These cookies are chewy on the inside and crispy exterior. I omitted the salt, a good move, as the molasses and spice is quite savoury and the saltwould have pushed it over the top. Using organic hard wheat flour the yield excellent - 3 dozen cookies. Next time I will add lemon zest for a little kick.

Fantastic recipe--I've made them about 15 times since the Bon Appetite issue published. Sometimes I leave out the crystallized ginger--my wife doesn't like it. They come out great either way. The best thing about these cookies is that they aren't too sweet. As a result I can eat many in one sitting. I even make this recipe in spring and summer because I get requests for it from friends and family.

With the addition of 2 tbsps of grated fresh ginger, these cookies were divine. I made them for a bake sale. My favourite customer was the woman who came by, bought two, then returned two minutes later to buy another 16! I'll reduce the sugar by about 1/4 cup next time, but the recipe is definitely a winner.

We just did a ginger cookie competition at work and this recipe won by a long shot. Forget about any other ginger cookie recipes - this one is the best.

These are great--crispy sweet coating surrounding a chewy, fragrant cookie with the spicy surprise of that awesome crystallized ginger. Wow. I will make them again and again. Do not leave out anything or substitute anything.

I made these cookies for a cookie exchange at work - they didn't win first place, but they were darn close. I gave up on the search for crystallized ginger and used actual grated ginger root -- it made for some strange stringy bits in the cookies, but the taste was beyond compare!

I had a hard time finding ground cloves and made the recipe without it, the cookies still turned out great. I'll be making this for friends this Holiday season. P.S. I got my crystallized ginger from Trader Joe's. It comes in a bag for less than $4 and is enough for around 3 recipes.

Great holiday cookie! After reading the reviews, I omitted the ground cloves and crystallized ginger since I didn't have any, and the cookies still turned out delicious. I also put the cookies in the refigerator for about 10 minutes before baking. Will definitely add this to my annual holiday cookies list.

Just made these and they won't last till Christmas! The best ginger cookies I've ever had! HINTS: Crystalized ginger "chips" can be found at the King Arthur Flour website. Also refrigerate the dough for an hour before forming balls using a cookie scoop -- no sticky mess and the cookies were perfect to roll in the sugar.

These came out great. Two suggestions: I decreased the amount of crystallized ginger to about 1/4 - 1/3 cup. Still had the zippy flavor of the ginger. The ginger is a pain to chop - I tried my Cuisinart adn a small hand-held chopper. Nothing works as best as a very sharp knife and patience. Keep the dough refrigerated at all times. 10 minutes baking time (in my oven) was plenty. Excellent recipe. I'd make it again.

I made these cookies the other day and they turned out fantastic! I did omit the crystalized ginger because I had trouble finding it. The only recommendation I have is to refigerate the cookies on the cookie sheets for about 10 minutes before baking them. It makes them crack more on top while baking and look a whole lot nicer.

the crystalized ginger is hard to deal with, very sticky. the cookies turned out really yummy though.

Made a vegan version of these cookies that turned out superb both flavor-wise and texture. Used flax seed boiled in water for egg replacement. Used Sunsweet Lighter Bake for shortening + butter replacement. Had to add more molasses because the ratio with the replacements didn't work out, but the cookies were wonderful.

Just recently, I called my mother-in-law to get her old family recipe for molasses sugar cookies. Well I lost the recipe (after I made them), and so I was so happy that this recipe is almost identical. The only thing different is that the old one does not call for the crystalized ginger, so I used only the ground kind. FANTASTIC! These cookies are superb!!!

These are THE BEST ginger molasses cookies, and I consider myself a fanatic of that genre. I've tried probably dozens of recipes, and this is the absolute best. These will be the ones I make again and again.

I doubled the recipe and found that it needed an extra 1/2 c. of flour when doubling. These are the best cookies! Everyone I serve these to wants the recipe. I made 2" balls for some of the cookies, which made the wonderful giant size cookies. I also rolled them in turbinado sugar which added a nice touch. Don't leave out the crystalized ginger; it is what elevates these to a level above other ginger cookies.

We had these cookies at a friend's house and fantacized about them for weeks until I looked up the recipe and made them myself. These cookies truly are beyond compare, and that says a lot coming from a chocolate fan as these cookies are chocolate-free.

This is a wonderful cookie. I've made it twice now. My family and coworkers couldn't get enough of them. They have a wonderful spicy kick to them. I make thousands of cookies at Christmas time and I'm very selective about what recipes I use. But this one is going to be added to my repertoire. I used a nut chopper to make chopping the crystallized ginger less of a chore.

These are powerful cookies--soooo flavorful. I didn't want to add the partially hydrogenated oil in the shortening so I used butter instead, and the cookies came out great.

My favourite cookies growing up were very similar to these without the crystallized ginger. This addition makes them perfect.

Best molasses/ginger cookies I have ever tasted. Crystallized ginger adds a lot--so does the sugar coating on the outside. It's buried at the end of the recipe...but you do need to refrigerate for an hour--so give yourself time. Took these with two other cookies (chocolate toffee and chocolate chunk, orange and hazelnut--much more glamourous choices) to a dinner party, they all came in a first place tie. Great with a late harvest riesling dessert wine. Would also like to try them with apples and cheddar (in the fall).

Not perfect, but good enough to have made 4 batches in the last month. Has motivated me to find a new supplier for Crystallized Ginger... (Great American Spice - $4.95/lb.) Love the ginger kick. If you have study enough food processor, I "pulsed" the ginger to a mince. A little sticky and chopped too fine, but much quicker.

I omitted the crystallized ginger and still found these to be very good cookies.

Although the batch I made were not as "puffy" as the ones shown in the magazine, these were absolutely delicious! I wish I could think of a quick way to chop all that crystallized ginger, but it was well worth the time (maybe 10-15 minutes) as it is an integral part to the crunchy-chewy part of this cookie.

These are the best version of ginger snap cookies that I have ever made. They were perfectly crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside. The crystallized ginger is a must and really gives these cookies a spicy kick. It also makes alot of cookies , so you'll have enough to share!
