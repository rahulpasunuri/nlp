dumb question, but can someone confirm for me that the nectarines are to be peeled (as well as halved and pitted) before they are pureed? i assume they should be, but the recipe does not specify, which doesn't persuade me to go to the bother. what else did they forget?

I think it was fine, the brown sugar makes the crust pretty hard to cut, but it is tasty.

The contrast between the sweet nectarines and tart lime curd is delicious! I like to add some lime zest to the curd to enhance the lime flavor. The first time we made this it got pretty messy and runny, so the second time we made it I decided to make the curd and crust a day ahead of time, and chill them together overnight. I also added an extra tablespoon of butter to help the curd set up. By the time I was ready to finish the tart, the curd was firm and held up much better under the weight of the nectarines! Yum!

This was a HUGE hit!!! The balance of sweet, tart, and saltiness was perfect! I made this in a ceramic tart pan, but it was VERY difficult to remove. I let it sit at room temperature before attempting to remove a slice and it was a little easier. next time, I will use a springform pan. My pan was a 10.5 inch round and I doubled the recipe...it was just enough. This a new favorite in my house!

My family loved this tart, even though it did turn into a mushy mess when served (as another reviewer mentioned). The flavor of the curd was nice, though I would have preferred it to be a bit more tart. I also used a 9in round pan and had to double the curd recipe to fill it, though there was plenty of crust. The tart did look really pretty with the nectarine slices on top, though they sunk into the curd after a while. Overall worth making.

Incredibly good, and very simple. Well worth the short amount of time you have to spend minding the curd over the stove, especially since you can make it ahead of time. I use Dark Muscovado sugar for the crust, and it is amazing! When nectarines are in season, this is a great way to showcase them.

my friends raved about this tart. Even though it turned into a mushy disaster, it was delicious. I'd never made lime curd before, and it was much easier than i expected. The nectarine lime curd has really great flavor and makes this recipe. The crust was delicious. My nectarines were VERY ripe and the jam on top stayed liquidy, so it was gushy and not very pretty... but it tasted great and we ate every last bit of it!

Didn't have limes, so I made the curd with lemon juice and lemon zest. I actually thought it was just OK, a little on the bland side. But I'm giving it 3 forks because the guests loved it.

I used an eleven inch tart pan and needed to double the recipe. Pretty yummy, but nothing to write home about. Pitting and slicing the tangerines for the top of the tart was time consuming and I quit after 2 tangerines. I'd make it again, but would space out production over two days.

I registered just so that I could rate this recipe. I've made many desserts from Epicurious recipes, but this was perhaps the most sublime! Delicious combination of sweet, crunchy crust and tart filling...added lime zest to curd to accentuate flavor. Topped with peach amaretto jam. Perfect for a fresh, light ending to any meal. Highly recommended!

I couldn't throw away the egg whites. The natural thing to do was... make a meringue and slather it on the tart. I didn't have any jam so omitted that. Baked the tart at 350 just long enough to turn the meringue golden. Fabulous.

This dish was to die for! My husband graciously chose not to fight my son over the last piece(just kidding, barely). I didn't have a lift out pan and so used a quiche type tart pan and instead of the crust, took the easy way out and used puff pastry. Lacking the peach jam and not wanting to run to the store, I used my recently canned strawberry jam. It was still quite beautiful and delicious. It looked like those gorgeous pastries you see in French boulangeries with the pinkish-red hue of the pit side of the nectarine juxtaposed with the orange flesh. Next time, I will definitely make 2 so there is enough for everyone to have seconds. Does anyone know a good substitute for puff pastry that doesn't contain partially hydrogenated oil in it?

I made this into mini-tarts (double the crust and it makes eight) and found it delicious. The nectarines were less sweet than usual on account of the lateness of the season, but I thought that it actally made a nice contrast to the very sweet (though delicious) crust. The curd was delicious and unusual; I might make it again on its own, as well as as a part of this lovely dish.

I made this with peach and lemon instead of nectarine and lime, and it was WONDERFUL! I added lemon zest and didn't strain the curd. I also made a simple blueberry syrup (blueberries, sugar, water, drop of lemon juice cooked together) to drizzle over the top-- very tasty and very pretty!

Delicious and different nectarine curd.

This tart was AMAZING! I added a little extra lime juice and some lime zest to the curd and it tasted great. The tartness of the curd mixed perfectly with the sweetness of the brown sugar crust and the fruit. Other people suggested that the crust was too crumbly but I didn't have that problem.

The guests were licking the dish! I guess they liked it. The crust is really good - crispy and yummy. It is beautiful looking too. The curd is really what makes this dessert. Careful not to add too much sugar. The tart flavor is a nice contrast to the sweet nectarines. The only problem I had was getting the tart out of my pan. I didn't have a tart pan with a removable bottom. With this recipe in mind, I recently went out to buy one...

Wonderful tart! I couldn't get nectarines, so omitted them. Therefore the lime curd was somewhat too tart. The crust was also very good and had character due to the brown sugar.

Really wonderful. I doubled the recipe and used white peaches on one tart and mango on the other (couldn't get nectarines). Guests had seconds even though we were all full.

I too had trouble with the crust -- it fell apart and was too crispy. But the lime curd and nectarines were great, so we just used the broken crust pieces to scoop up the toppings. Yum.

I make this dessert every summer. It's delicious -- the crunch of the crust against the smooth curd, and the strong flavors of both the nectarine and lime. Mmmmm.

The curd was pretty good. I don't know what I've done wrong but the brown sugar crust part didn't turn out good. Maybe because I used individual size pans. So I substituted with sugar crust instead. Good recipe when you have some riped nectarines and don't want to just trash them!

delectable! truly! it was a favorite at a dinner party that i made it for. it's fairly easy. i actually put it into the oven at 375 degrees F for about twenty minutes after i assembled it and brushed jam on top, making the peaches that i used very sweet and very soft.

This recipe was great! I made it with many variations from the recipe. instead of lime curd I made a vanilla pastry cream (what a great way to use up yolks!) and topped the tart with apricots instead of nectarines. I did stick to the brown sugar crust, though. The combination of brown sugar, vanilla, and apricots is terrific! I tried to make the crust in the kitchenaid mixer instead of the food processor; I don't recommend it because the product is definitely tough. It was still very delicious. Be careful on the collking time; mine was overdone when I followed the recipe's time and temperature...
