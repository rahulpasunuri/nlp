I loved this cake. I followed the recipe with the minor following exceptions. I used fine sea salt in place of the table salt, sifted the dry ingredients together three times, and used two 8x2" pans, cooking them a little longer at a slightly lower temperature. I thought the cake looked bare without frosting, so I made some vanilla buttercream and frosted the top and sides because I had already stacked the layers. It turned out a little sweet but the cake was incredibly light and moist. I will definitely make this again.
