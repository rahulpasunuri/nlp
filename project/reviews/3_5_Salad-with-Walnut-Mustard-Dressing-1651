Very good -- will make again. Made this for another salad (Brussel Sprout Slaw w/Mustard Dressing and Maple- Glazed Pecans). I think this dressing would be great drizzled over roasted beets.

I make this all the time, but with mixed baby greens instead od Bibb or radicchio. If I'm short on grainy dijon, I substitue dijonnaise and that works well also. The recipe is a perfect combination of flavors. Everyone will love this, so make it for your guests!!!

Made the salad dressing but for a different salad. A hit with the family!

I made the dressing portion of this recipe with a different salad base: romaine, cherry tomatoes and cucumbers. Dressing was great-I did add more olive oil and 1 minced clove of garlic. I will definetly make this again.

Can I get a, "YUM-YUM?!" I was given a gorgeous bottle of walnut oil from a local winery; one whiff of the oil and I know I just had to find a salad dressing recipe! I didn't follow the measurements and nixed the radicchio all together. I didn't tear the bibbs in pieces but arranged them around a large serving bowl with large shavings of paremesan and a few slivers of tomatoe. My guests were licking their plates clean! (added salt/pepper to taste)

The walnuts were delicious, a nice change.

Great salad. The tangy dressing really is delicious, and easy to make. I would only make sure to add salt and maybe pepper to the dressing.

I used regular dijon instead of the grainy kind, and the dressing turned out fine. It was flavorful and tangy, and the toasted walnuts really added a nice touch. I'll definitely be making this again.

I followed this recipee exactly and wasn't disappointed. My sister and I had made several salads looking for new additions to our company menus and we liked this one the best. I will definately be making this one again.

This is my tasty choice when I want a tangy, garlic-free dressing. I take it to work to have for lunch and have also served it to company. Occasionally have substituted balsamic vinegar for lemon juice. (Walnuts are a source of essential fatty acids.)

This salad was both easy and delicious!! It also worked well with a mixture of fresh spring greens instead of the Bibb and Radicchio.
