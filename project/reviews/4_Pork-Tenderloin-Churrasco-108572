Very good recipe. Definitely make the salsa to go with it. I love the oil infused paprika marinade and would try it with other meats as well.

Excellent dish and easy to make too. The pork was unbelievably tender. I had the butcher slice and pound the tenderloin which made it very simple. Served with potato croquettes, grilled squash and an tasty Rioja. It was great for breakfast this morning too!

I'm doing weight watchers and doing so without giving up great tasting food. The recipe trancends well. Used just enough olive oil to make a somewhat loose paste and then with scraping the marinade off, didn't really miss it. Love the salsa. I subbed habanero west indian salsa and added a little sea salt to balance the sweetness of the pineapple and little bit of vinegar in the habanero sauce. Can see using this recipe over and over again..for all types of meats

Made a half recipe using one pork tenderloin. I also made the Aji Amarillo-Pineapple Salsa. Very easy recipe and you can prepare the marinade and the salsa at the same time as both need about 6 hours to develop their flavors. I actually made a full recipe of salsa leaving enough for another dish with this tasty light salsa. Followed the recipes as written and served with a baked sweet potato and small salad. The spices and chilies are so tantalizing and flavorful!!

Have made just the pork several times and really love it - the marinade seems overly oily but in reality it helps keep the super lean meat succulent. I often take some of the marinade and toss it with sliced peppers and onions or other vegetables and grill them along with the pork - it is awesome on vegetables as well! I will get around to trying the salsa at some point, but the pork is fabulous without it!

I made this recipe and is excellent. My friends enjoyed it to the point that I'm been asked to make it several times. If you don't like Spanish paprika the recipe is not for you.

I followed this recipe exactly, with the exception of using dried thyme, since I did not have fresh. I even used the smoked paprika (which by the way folks, is very different from regular paprika). I found the marinade to have a strange smell, as stated by another reviewer, not an appetizing one. Luckily it tasted better than it smelled, but I was still somewhat underwhelmed by this recipe and will probably not try it again. Maybe more garlic would help this?

Pretty good with Chimichurri sauce.

Made a few changes - extra garlic, chilis in adobo sauce, dried rosemary (no fresh around.) It was still fantastic. I did the whole pork tenderloin, rather than pounding it out, just roasted in the oven until it was 145 deg. Will repeat this one for sure!

I don't understand the rave reviews about this recipe. The marinade was fine, but not great. You could achieve the same flavor with a rub that would be easier and less oily. This will not be on my "make again" list.

Made this recipe over and over everyone simply love it, the hot smoked paprika is essential

I made this following the recipte exactly, but used dried thyme instead of fresh. Came out delicious -- looking forward to trying this marinade with steak. Served it with grilled asparagus & grilled fingerling potatoes.

I did not have access to anything but regular paprika so instead added a dash of chipotle pepper sauce and that added the smokiness. Absolutely wonderful. We could not stop serving seconds and thirds.

Enjoyed a new twist for pork tenderloin! The marinade was terrific and super easy. Like the Miami cook, I served the meat with a chimichurri condiment (using half parsley and half cilantro in the mix). As a side I grilled pineapple and prepared fresh-lime scented rice. Would definately use this recipe again.

I made this last night. I pretty much followed the recipe exactly, except I had smoked paprika, not HOT smoked paprika. I wasn't sure how good this would be - honestly I thought the paprika-infused oil really smelled awful when it was cooking! But much to my surprise, once combined with the garlic and herbs, this made for a nice marinade. I did not make the pineapple salsa, but did serve this with chimichurri, though I do think the pork would have held up fine on its own. I was only able to marinate this for one hour, but it still had a great flavor.

Absolutely delicious, and very simple. I also tried it on talapia fillets and they were great too.

This was a hit in our house. I used dried spices instead of fresh and it was still flavourful, I will make a point to try the fresh next time to see if there is a differnce. I didn't bother with the salsa but made bbqed veggie kebons instead - Yummy! The oil marinade gives the pork and flash-fried, crisp taste on the outside.

Fantastic!! We loved the tenderloin this way and I think it would also be great on flank steak. I served it with grilled red and orange peppers. The smoked paprika is a must; I found it at William Sonoma.

This is such a great way to prepare pork tenderloin! I did make a few modifications - I couldn't find the smoked paprika so used ancho chile pepper powder, and I only used half of the oil called for which was plenty. I also made a Mango Salsa (Bon Appetit, July 1997) instead of the pineapple. So good!

I will never make pork tenderloin any other way!!! This was fabulous. I did not find the spanish paprika and just used regular. I also missed the part about heating the oil and paprika before blending with other ingredients so I warmed all of the ingredients once I blended them. This was excellent and I just enjoyed some leftovers today. I did not make the salsa...it did not need it. I may try it next time.

This is the only way I know to cook pork tenderloin. And I love it! The meat comes out so tender, with a mild, smoky flavor. The "aji amarillo-pineapple salsa" is good. It's also super colorful, AND super sweet, AND heavy on the cilantro; so it tends to overpower the meat. That and it's hard to match side-dishes. Cornbreads and corn-cakes seem to work. Still that's a lot of yellow on a plate. First-timer? Try it without the salsa first.

I love this recipe! I didn't have the smoked paprika the first few times I made it, so I substituted 2 canned chipotles in adobo when I heated the oil, and it turned out great. I also wouldn't marinade the meat more than 2 hours because of the intense flavor and saltiness of the marinade.

Followed the recipe as written. I believe the marinade/meat could benefit from some acidity. I loved the smell of the marinade and the meat as well as the crispy bits as a result of the grilling. I didn't at all like my first few bites, but then the flavor started to grow on me. May try this recipe again with some form of acid added. The salsa was good.

easy and delicious. Could not find the spanish paprika, used hot hungarian instead and it worked well.

Really enjoyed this. I left the tenderloins whole instead of cutting into strips per the recipe, which I think was a mistake. The flavor of the marinade is so good, it's probably worth the extra work and next time I'll follow the directions. But if you are pressed for time, you'll still get a tasty dish by marinating whole.

You really don't have to flatten the tenderloins. Great marinade for other meats as well. Be sure to get hot, not sweet, smoked paprika.

Rating: 4
Fantastic marinade. You can definitely take the shortcut of not cutting the tenderloins into strips. You can leave them whole, marinate them for hours and hours, and then grill them according to the package instructions. We didn't make the salsa, and the tenderloins were still excellent. The special paprika is an absolute must.

I followed the recipe exactly. Fortunately, I was able to get my hands on both the smoked paprika and aji amarillo paste. The pork turned out quite well, got good but not rave reviews from my family. My quibble is with the salsa recipe. I used both the green and red onions, as called for, and found that the onion flavor overpowered the salsa. The onion KO'ed the milder-tasting pineapple. Next time I'll substitute a milder onion, like Vidalia, for both.

This is so amazing. I used dried thyme and rosemary and it was still fabulous...oh, and I used Hungarian paprika with 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne - so so good! Very easy considering the results.

This recipe was fantastic! We only had time to marinate for 1 hour and it still had great flavor. This is a keeper!

I made this for friends over the weekend and everyone loved it and definitely voted it a keeper. Since I make a lot of pork tenderloin, I was happy to find a different presentation. I also used chipoltes in the marinade, since i didn't have the special paprika. I had no luck finding the pepper paste, but used some pickled peppers in addition to jalapenos in the salsa and that worked.

This is GREAT! My friends & I enjoyed this very much. We had it 2 times in 2 weeks. A keeper!

This was an insanely good marinade! I didn't have the smoked paprika so I substituted the same amount of excellent quality Hungarian hot paprika and two chipotles in adobo (which are smokey to begin with), pureed in the food processor with the oil. I followed the remainder of the recipe exactly. Everyone went crazy over the flavor of this! It's also a great if you skewer the pounded pork in thin strips and serve it satay style for an amazing appetizer!

Great flavor combos-- don't even THINK about omitting the salsa-- it makes the whole dish. Recipe makes more marinade than required; suggest cutting in half.

Rating: 4
Super, and four forks because it is so easy to prepare. Coked it under the broiler, and was still delicious. I cut the marinade in half for 1 tenderloin, but would probably use 3/4 uantities of the herbs and s&p next time. Didn't even bother with the salsa, it's good enough on its own.

I've made this a few times, and it's always a hit. One time I couldn't find the Aji paste and substituted generic hot pepper sauce, and it was also good. The magic is well-charred pork paired with the spicy-sweet salsa. I recommend cooking a bit longer to make sure the pork gets a good char. The recipe also works well in a buffet setting. I arrange the pork around the edge of a large platter, then set the pineapple salsa in the middle.

Thia recipe was wonderful! it looked great on a bright platter with fruit salsa is great with the meat! AWSOME RECIPE!
