I would advice anyone reading this to NOT use margarine at all. Margarine is full of transfats that clog the arteries, increase cholesterol and cause heart disease. Stick to butter!

I found this recipe to be a big hit with friends! Coffee or any hot beverage will compliment it nicely. I believe others will find it as an excellent choice for a chilly afteroon treat. A note for others attempting this dish for the first time would be that,in regard to the whipping cream, 8oz. should be used rather than the 16oz./pint as stated first in the recipe.

"parve whipping cream" ? Talk about oxymorons ! Why not call it what it is: non-dairy cream substitute ? It is NOT cream !!

What about this is Persian? If it is totally French, where does the Persian influence come in? Why is it touted as a Sedar item? Totally confused.

Thanks for the two replies. I was going to ask if the lack of butter was to make this was a Kosher Turkish recipe(?)?

This recipe is not Kosher for Passover, and should never be made as part of a seder. There is no Jewish tradition which allows for the use of wheat flour during Passover.

"French" and "Margarine" are two words that do not belong together. I'm French. There's only "Butter"! :-)
