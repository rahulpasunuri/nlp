I made this with 1# ground beef and the spices as listed-- could make it more spicy as other reviewers recommended. Used two cans of ready cut tomatoes and 1 c beef broth -- browned the carrots with the onions -- think that made it more flavorful. Only used 2 cups of onions -- that was plenty. Easy to make ahead and put in oven. We had it with couscous and a spinach salad. Really good I would do this again in a heartbeat.

My family loved this. Was a bit of work, but what dinner isn't when you want to cook a delicious meal? I don't mind a little more prep work when the whole meal goes in one pot and I can clean up while it's cooking! I put the carrots in with the onions and garlic and they made the sauce rich. Omitted the spinach, but it was still good.

Excellent use of forgot-the-parmesan meatballs.

This was delicious - with a few modifications. Based on other reviewers, I doubled the spices. Next time I will make the meatballs smaller, with a few more breadcrumbs in them to make them more tender. I'll also only use 1 lb of meat - as we wanted more of the sauce. 6 servings? More like 8-10 for us! Maybe we just don't eat as much meat as other people. My 7 yr old thought it was too spicy - but she won't get it next time. :-)

Very good. Added paprika and fennel seeds to the stew.

I used 1 pound of ground beef but kept the same amount of spices and the meatballs were spiced enough. I also agree there was too much liquid. I would use half the amount of tomatoes.

Rating: 4
Made this as written... more or less. No panko, so I used regular breadcrumbs, and added a yellow pepper into the stew, as well as throwing in a handful of chopped apricots because I didnt have raisins. I kept the spices as written. Made the meatballs the night before and then threw everything together into a slow cooker in the morning, set on low, and let it simmer for 8 or 9 hours. Perrrfect!

At first this looked disappointingly more like a soup than a stew, but somehow it thickened up as it sat awhile and especially the next day when reheated. Like it spicier? Add more spices. I like to fry one of the meatballs as a test to see if it needs something more, salt, definitely. Making a day ahead so you can skim the fat is a good idea. I made this exactly as the recipe stated and it was delicious. It makes a lot and is easily prepared. Over couscous or Basmati rice, a definite winner!

My husband and I thought the spice mix was very tasty, but will increase the amounts the next time we make this. Also, cut down the amount of broth as it's not necessary when cooking in a tagine.

Wow, this was my first attempt at making anything like this. The flavors are so new, I can't wait to make it again. Since the spices and process are so new to me, I followed the recipe to the letter. Even though it was a very time consuming recipe, I will definitely make it again.

This is a recipe I make quite often, but have made a few modifications...no onions in the meatballs, and I use 1/2 ground kangaroo meat (or 1/2 ground bison when I am in Canada) and 1/2 ground lamb. I also substitute the spices listed with a Ras Al Hanout blend and a little bit of Za'atar (both are well worth searching out at your local Middle-Eastern/Moroccan store). I do brown the meatballs first under the grill before adding to the sauce. I also do not use any broth in the sauce, just lots & lots of canned tomatoes. Also, I love to chop up a half preserved lemon and use it as garnish (my husband doesn't care for this though, as he says it tastes like Mr. Clean...I suppose it's an acquired taste!).

Rating: 3
I thought this would be fast, since you don't need to brown the meatballs, but there's still lots of prep work. This was hearty and flavorful served over plain couscous. I recommend adding a bit of salt in the stew. Oh and added sweet yellow and red peppers when cooking the onions since I had them.

Absolutely yummy - even reheated for the next day.

This was a great recipe. Flavorful and easy. Didn't add the spinach at the end - but it would have been good. The only thing I would do differently in the future is make it far enough in advance that I could put it in the fridge for a while to solidify the fat and meld the flavors. Thought about pan frying the meatballs in advance but I'm glad I didn't - so were so moist as is. Just would like to skim off the fat before serving. Served with plain couscous, steamed broccoli and stewed apples. Delicious. My 21 month old grandson ate 3 servings of the meatballs!!

I cooked this in a crockpot overnight, and used twice the spices for the stew (crockpots dont work well for dried herb), and it was delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this twice now, and both times it was amazing. Tender meat balls, sweet sauciness. Can't go wrong.

This was really good. I only had 1 pound of ground beef, so I added a 1/2 pound of gorund dark meat turkey. I also used a whole 28 oz can of whole tomatoes because I wanted a lot of sauce. It actually turned out really well. Next time I make it I'll use all beef because I'm sure that tastes better.

Rating: 3
To fry the meatballs prior to adding to the stew or not - given the divided opinions of the other readers, I did half and half. I found those not fried prior to be moister and more flavorful. Overall a very tasty recipe enjoyed by the whole family even my very picky youngest son

This is a good recipe,but it needs more salt in both the meatballs and the stew.

Huge hit! Made some tweaks based on what I had - tomato paste and roasted red peppers instead of canned tomatoes, figs instead of raisins, used ras al hanout as the spice blend in the stew (because I love Moroccan flavors), plain couscous, and it was all excellent. Very flexible recipe, so feel free to experiment! (Definitely recommend browning the meatballs first, and using the same pan/oil for the stew. Adds flavor all around.)

I never cook a recipe with improvisation. Anyone frustrated with the prep may want to consider my variation. I created a "chili" rather than meatballs. Simply eliminate the egg, breadcrumbs and oil. The ground beef is fatty enough to cook everything in a crockpot on low. Add crumbled ground beef and all ingredients as described. Slow cook several hours. I also added a pinch of chipotle pepper, a dash of dried coriander, a half teaspoon of cumin and substituted parsley rather than cilantro. To keep the chili hearty I eliminated one cup of broth and used a teaspoon demi glace de boeuf in place of salt. Triple the amount of raisins, and you have a gorgeous and delicious Moroccan chili. It was divine and I can't wait to make it again.

2 1/2 forks really. Husband did not enjoy it, but he's not big on the spices in the dish. I thought it was tasty and different. I halved the recipe and kept the spice amounts the same as the original, due to the other reviewer's finding it lacking in spice power. Did it all on the stove, let it simmer before adding the (pan fried) meatballs.

Made this for Superbowl party to great reviews. Flavors are very tasty and different. Served over plain couscous which worked beautifully. Used very lean ground beef with some ground pork. You need some fat or meatballs will be dry!

Rating: 3
Like a lot of other reviewers, I thought this was good, but lacking something. Perhaps reducing the sauce before adding the meatballs? More tomatoes and less broth? The liquid was tasty on its own, but couldn't really stand up to the other ingredients. I simmered it on the stove for 15 minutes before putting it in the oven (and I would probably just keep it on the stove the whole time next time), but I should have left it on longer, then added the meatballs at the very end. I was worried the carrots would be mushy, but they still had a bit of crunch. The meatballs were well-spiced and not too spicy. I thought the tumeric in the sauce was too much at first, but it mellowed as it cooked. I also put in a little ginger, I think I would try adding more next time. I browned the meatballs as others suggested, then cooked the onions in the drippings.

Rating: 4
I make Moroccan-inspired dishes quite frequently, and this is one of the best I've done. I made it exactly as specified in the recipe, and it was easy and delicious. I might try adding some harissa to the sauce next time, for added spiciness, but it is quite flavorful as it is.

Rating: 2
I have to agree with the reviewers who said it was not as flavorful as expected, especially given how many delicious spices there were in the recipe! I would DEFINITELY brown the meatballs first - I am surprised the recipe didn't call for it. Browning the meat would have added a necessary depth of flavor.

Rating: 4
This recipe was just delicious! Only changes I made were to bake the meatballs ahead of time in the oven and then add them to the sauce. Also being the dead of New England winter, I did not have freash cilantro and did not want to brave the icy roads to get some at the store. Next time I may try this recipe with stew beef to save some time.

Rating: 2
This recipe is just OK. Sauce is very thin, watery and bland despite the spice mix. Browning meatballs before braising might improve.

Rating: 4
Fantastic dish! I make this using cut-up steak or stew meat instead of meatballs; brown that first, remove, then proceed with the recipe. The spices that would have gone in the meatballs get tossed into the stew itself. Cook in the oven for an hour or so - flavorful, tender, perfect winter food.

Rating: 4
Very easy and tasty. I didn't add the onion to the meatballs as I find that to properly cook the onion the meat often becomes tough. I never put it in the oven, just simmered it on the stovetop for about an hour then popped the meatballs in about 10 minutes before serving. The meatballs were delicious and juicy this way, only just cooked through. I added some harissa to the sauce for a bit more spice, and served with some finely sliced preserved lemon for a bit more contrast. Boyfriend loved it. Will definitely be making this again.

I was very excited to try this dish. I used every ingredient as written and my spices were brought from a spice market in India. The finished dish looked amazing and filled my kitchen with exotic aromas. We could hardly wait to eat it! The disappointment was oh so great when I tasted it. It just fell absolutely flat in every way. I need to get out my tool belt because this one requires some fixing.

I followed the recipe by the book EXCEPT for the lemon part. Unfortunately, I was all out of lemon and had to substitute lime. The flavors were okay....but nothing like I was hoping for. I can't imagine that had I had one measly lemon, everything would have been better. This recipe is one, like others that I read about, will be severely tweaked....but will not be repeated.

I had leftover meatballs that I needed to use up, so I didn't make the meatballs in the recipe. I still wanted all the flavors of the spices so in addition to the spices called for in the sauce I added the missing spices from the meatballs (turmeric, cayenne, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger). The sauce was fantastic. I also didn't have cilantro and so used parsley--this worked just fine. I prefer Israeli couscous and toast it before I add the liquid. I melt 1 tbsp butter and then add the dry couscous to toast. In addition, for this recipe, I added cinnamon, cumin, and a little curry powder. Then I add a mix of chicken stock and water. Overall I would say this dish was truly delicious. I will make again and try using the meatball recipe here, though I will probably sub turkey for the beef.

OMG!!! This was so good! I belong to a "foodie" group and we rotate playing "head chef." That person picks the menu and we all cook together. We doubled the recipe but basically followed it very closely, and everyone LOVED it! It was beautiful, delicious and very easy to make. I highly recommend this dish. Very good as leftovers!

I don't know why this doesn't have a perfect score. I've made this 6 times and it has come out perfectly and the same each time. I can only describe it as the Moroccan version of "comfort food" but without the fat and bloating. It's a beautiful dish and worth the effort. And, if you need a perk, squeeze some lemon on the couscous at the last moment. It seems like one of those recipes that came down through many generations and hit the perfect note. This has become a permanent choice among many recipes that I repeat.

This meal was an incredible hit with my family. It was not too hot for the one member of the family who prefers mildly-spiced foods, but it also satisfied those of us who like the heat. The flavor of the dish is complex and unusual.

I made the recipe using a little over a pound of ground beef, no saffron, and dark raisins instead of golden raisins--didn't change the proportions of the spices. My husband ate it over a baked potato. I ate it over couscous. It was superb and a nice change from BBQ (which we eat almost every night). I recommend this for any occasion. It was easy to make and delicious.

When I didn't have bacon for my intended weeknight dinner, I quickly looked up "ground beef" and this one popped up! Lucky me! I had everything on hand! I thought it was about the same difficulty as making a meatloaf - easy! Used parsley instead of cilantro, and stewed tomatoes instead of canned diced tomatoes because that is what I had on hand. I made this with ground turkey and low salt chicken broth as that is our preference for healthy eating these days. We don't care for saffron so I omitted that and cut back on the cayenne to 1/8 tsp. which just gave the meatballs a hint of heat. I thought the meatballs had a decent salt level and even wondered if I should cut it back some next time. The broth, although very flavorful did not thicken. I added 1 Tbsp. of cornstarch to make a thicker consistency after it came out of the oven. I also followed another reviewers advice and added the meatballs directly to the broth as I made them while waiting for the broth to heat up. I threw it all in the oven and took the dog on a walk - should have cleaned up the dishes instead, but found the carrots a little al dente after almost one hour in the oven. Very forgiving about the extra oven time. I also had some leftover Basmati rice from an Indian Rice recipe that I ended up mixing into the stew. Although I made several adjustments to the recipe I still give it 4 forks for the overall flavor. I look forward to making it again and again when I find myself wondering what to do with ground turkey again. I'll bet with ground beef or lamb it would be even better!

WOW! I loved this just as is. I disagree about the lack of salt in the meatballs but would make more of the starch accompaniment to soak up all that delicious broth. My food-adventurer 1 year old gobbled it up even with the cayenne as indicated. I will make this again soon - if anything, to keep me from attempting to lick the stock pot out for more.

Excellent, complex, hearty, wonderful. I used orzo once when out of couscous and have omitted spinach when not in season. Can brown the meatballs in the oven to cut down on prep time. Easy and delicious. Dinner guests are always impressed and my husband eats the leftovers in no time!

I make this with ground turkey and chicken stock (instead of beef and beef stock). The meatballs are so tender and flavorful. I served it at a dinner party last night and everyone raved. Forget arranging the meatballs on a sheet. Just make the stew and drop them gently into it. You'll save some time and effort. This recipe is a real keeper. Wonderful flavors!

I have made the stew part of the recipe twice now. I love it!! I think I may add extra beef broth the next time to have some extra juices. I had some leftovers and put them in the freezer. They actually heated up very well. I just made fresh couscous to serve with it. I have made the couscous many times as a side dish. I add some extra lemon zest and juice since I love lemon - but it is very nice with many different mains!

I'm convinced that any series of recipes from Jean Thiel Kelley is going to great food! Last year I cooked my way through the great "pot pie" series and now plan to to the same with the meatballs. This one was a great way to start. The only change I made was to use 1 3/4 lb of 5% fat ground beef. They were still very flavorful and not the least bit tough. Probably not a weeknight dish, but just because it has a long list of ingredients doesn't make it difficult or labor intensive (especially since the meatballs don't need to be browned). The blend of spices was perfect for us and the Couscous side was perfect as well.

I loved this recipe. I served it with the Lemon cilantro couscous recipe also in the January issue. I agree that the meatballs needed a bit more salt, but would make it exactly the same again. I also only put 1/8 tsp of cayanne & had the perfect amount of heat for my palate. Love the idea of adding chickpeas. This will become a staple to my dinner rotation!

I cooked this tonight and while both my husband and I enjoyed the dish, we do have some comments: - The meatballs lacked salt. I would probably double the amount of salt next time. - The dish tastes great even without the spinach. - We don't eat starch for dinner but we both felt that this would be perfect to be served with rice, couscous or some other product to soak up all the delicious stew.

Delicious. Enjoyed by the whole family, even our toddlers! I cut down only on the cayenne for that reason. All else as written. Served with Israeli couscous softened in chicken broth. Took about 75 minutes start to finish. I was in a rush so cooked at 375 for 30 minutes and meatballs were still tender.

What a wonderful meal to prepare and serve on a snowy (blizzard) day in West Chester, PA. We were prepared with all the ingredients on hand. We felt the flavors blended nicely and had a nice kick. My husband is not a lover of cilantro but enjoyed the dish. Our meatballs held their shape nicely and our carrot slices were cooked to our liking. We also enjoyed the side dish of Couscous with Fresh Cilantro and Lemon Juice. This is a keeper. Havving the leftovers tonight as we wait for another snow storm to hit the area.

This was delicious. The flavors came together very well and I expect it will taste even better the next day after they have melded together even more. I think the time spent sauteeing the onions at the beginning contributed to a richer broth. Although it looks like a long & complicated recipe, it really isn't hard at all. I will make th is again.

I was really looking forward to making this and felt disappointed with the final product, considering the work that went into it. The meatballs were tender and tasty but I felt the stew itself lacked flavor. Followed the recipe except used ground cinnamon instead of sticks, and felt the cinnamon flavor was lacking, unlike some other reviewers. I also used crushed tomatoes instead of diced, which I think benefited the recipe since I dont think I would have had enough cooking liquid for the meatballs otherwise. This was ok, but not worth the effort.

This was very tasty. I only used about 1 lb. beef but added zucchini and it was plenty for 2 people - had left overs. I served it with orzo - delicious! Next time, I will make a separate batch for our vegetarian adult kids, using the same sauce and vegan meatballs.

I liked this recipe, to make it lower in fat I used 1/2 ground turkey breast. I gave some to a Moroccan friend and they thought it was very authentic and asked for the recipe. I also thought you could adapt this in any way you wanted-I'd add more veg. next time!

I found this absolutely delicious. The meatballs were tender and flavorful. I also omitted the second cinnamon stick and tried adding a teaspoon each of cumin, paprika and cayenne to the stew spices for a little more depth and some heat. Quite nice. For the couscous, I omitted the garlic and added green olives. All of the different flavors came together really well. I will definitely make again.

to the cook from merion: the tagine spice blend may work. if it lists the ingredients on the jar, you can compare to the recipe. also, take the advice of the cook from vienna. parboil the carrots and cook the stew more slowly. however, i did think this recipe was worth the effort. very good.

Delicious flavors... not too spicy... perfectly round meatballs thanks to cooking in liquid. Didn't have cinnamon sticks so used 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon. Worked just fine. Does take some preparation time. The accompanying recipe - couscous with fresh cilantro and lemon juice - was also good, but even plain couscous would have worked with the tagine sauce. Will make again on another rainy weekend day.

I made this along with the couscous recipe for dinner tonight and we really enjoyed it. It's pretty labor intensive, so it's a good weekend dish to make. I wouldn't have a problem serving this to company. The squeeze of lemon at the end really finishes it nicely. I did cut the cinnamon in the stew in half, but kept the turmeric the same and I thought it was fine. I think lamb would be even better than the beef and I'll try it that way next time.

This was a wonderful dish! My family loved it. I played around a bit with the ingredients, based on others' comments -- I cut back a bit on the cilantro and turmeric, and I added salt and pepper to taste. I served it with pearl couscous instead of using the couscous recipe provided. I think ground lamb would work better than ground beef for the meatballs, and would be more authentic. But I'll definitely make this again!

We really loved this dish- the colors are so striking, the flavors so fresh, and the warm spices were perfect for a winter evening. The saffron in combination with the other spices made this sing! I didn't cook it quite as long as recommended and didn't find the meatballs hard at all (though they need to be dense to hold together in a stew). It pairs very well with the bright, lemony couscous (Couscous with Fresh Cilantro and Lemon Juice), though I just garnished with cilantro. I did use (thin) rainbow carrots (what I had on hand), a handful of chopped leeks, extra golden raisins, and extra spinach.

So sad. There's a great recipe hidden in here. If I were it make it again (I won't), I'd parboil the carrots first or cut them much thinner; use only one stick of cinnamon; I'd cut the temp back to 300 and leave it in for an hour instead of 35 min at 350. Those meatballs were like hocky pucks! And dude, you have to really love cilantro to serve this with the recommended couscous side dish. Overall -- way too much work for what is essentially Moroccan meatloaf.

I really liked the idea of this recipe- I recently made a Moroccan chicken pie, and enjoyed the combination of flavors. This recipe is pretty good, but it seemed like something needed to be more prominent... one of the spices, or maybe the raisins to add some sweetness? As the other reviewer mentioned, I'm interested in making this again, and experimenting with different portions of spices. I do want to note that when reheated the next day, it did seem more flavorful.

I was excited to try this recipe. Unfortunately the flavor wasn't exactly what I had expected. The cinnamon was a bit excessive, if I made this again I'd use one cinnamon stick in the sauce - not two. I'd also add more salt. I'd be open to making this recipe again but I would need to play around with the spices.
