This is a good basic recipe, but I would add the zest to egg/sugar mixture, not the flour mixture, as well as use the zest of 2 oranges. And, I made an icing of powdered sugar, orange juice, orange flavoring, brandy and fresh squeezed lemon juice and drizzled it across the top of the cake while it was still warm. I also baked the cake in a spring form pan. The crust had a delicious crunch to it.

This cake is very good. It has a slightly firm but fluffy texture, like any good cake that incorporates beaten egg whites should. The orange and brandy flavors complement each other very well. As other reviewers suggested, I cooked it in a bundt pan for 45 minutes instead of the full hour recommended in the recipe. Next time I make this cake I think I will make an almond-flavored whipped cream to dollop on each slice.

It's a shame this recipe didn't get better reviews. It's a Vasilopita, or "St Basil's cake," traditionally made for New Year's day when the feast of St Basil is celebrated. Youll find a similar one made in every Greek home. This recipe is quite fragrant and one of the best around. The Greek New Year's cake is more bread like than cake like and it does take a bit of effort to make. It's reminiscent of challah bread which is more widely known. This is definitely great for breakfast or a snack, not appropriate for a birthday party.

I thought it was a little dry and boring.

I found it more bread-y than cake-y but the orange brandy flavour was delicious.

OK, but nothing wow about it, especially given the time to make it. And the one hour cooking time is way too long: I cooked for only 40 minutes and the sides were slightly burnt and inside too dry.

My Greek mother in law makes a similar cake...I recomend wraping a dime in tin foil and inserting into the dough just before baking. Do slice it all and hand out the pieces...I got the dime this year (pregnant and taking the Bar...will I pass?)

This cake came out excellent. We cooked it in a white Bundt cake pan for 45 minutes at 375 degrees and it was fully cooked. The cake is moist. We did not put the almonds on top and may make a orange confectioner sugar glaze instead.
