Indeed, this pizza was very good; however, it was a lot of meat for my taste. It's possible that the links I purchased (Whole Foods) were larger than average, yet still the sausage over powered the pie, and we couldn't taste the mushrooms at all. I'll definitely make this pizza again, but next time I'll buy one link rather than two. Nonetheless, it was still very good and definitely better than average.

Excellent. Made Wolfgang Puck's pizza dough (recipe on web). It is the best dough recipe and easy. Wolfgang Puck's is known for his pizzas! Enjoy.

Delicious pizza recipe. I have made this several times and it is now my husband's favorite pizza!

Wow! Amazing in every way. Made it exactly to the recipe.

Yum! We make our own Italian sausage and don't skimp on the red pepper, so the end result combined with the extra pepper in the dough was a little too spicy and overwhelmed the flavor of the mushrooms. So just make sure you keep the spice level conservative. If you have a Kitchen-Aid with a dough hook, there's really no reason not to make your own dough, it's really easy. I recommend Wolfgang Puck's dough recipe.

One of the best recipes I have found on the internet!

I followed this recipe to a tee the first time and found it to be one of the best pizzas I had ever made. I have started to take some of the directions from this pizza and applying it to other pizzas I make, such as pressing coarse sea salt and parmesian reggiano into pizza crust. I've made this recipe several times for friends and they are always asking to come over again for more. I have deviated somewhat from the recipe, I use more red onion and a little less sausage. Definitely four forks!

I'm not a pizza fan but I must say that this pizza is the best I ever had!

My favorite sausage and mushroom pizza ever. Love this pizza! The crust is tasty with the added spices, but I do make this with plain crust about half the time and it's still excellent. I use shiitakes and they are great with this recipe. I always use ground Italian sausage as it is easier to deal with.

Golly Woozis, folks, it only takes about 5 minutes actual work to make pizza dough. Otherwise, a promising recipe- too much rosemary and too much grease for my tastes, the fat in the sausage should be way more than enough on its own, and there are better ways to bake a pizza.

Incredible pizza! We used 2 kinds of mushrooms- oyster and a shiitake. Followed the recipe exactly and it was superb. We cook pizza a slightly different way though. We heat the oven as hot as it will go and cook it for about 8 minutes. Watch it so it doesn't burn but it cooks it perfectly. Can't wait to make it again!

Fresh rosemary and cheese pressed into the dough gives the crust a delicious old-style flavour. The onion cooked as reccomended adds a sweetness to this pizza. Very nice.

This was awesome. One of the best pizza's I've had. I did make my own whole wheat dough. And instead of red onions I used ramps because I had them on hand. The house smelled soooo good too!

To JenniferRab: Luckily cooking isn't baking. If you're unsure of how much sausage it calls for and you're making two pizza's just think about how much sausage you'd like on two pizza's and buy that much. Simple! These are some winning flavor combinations, sometimes I also like to add some kale from the garden. Delicious!

SO, SO GOOD! I made the pizza dough from scratch and then added these delicious toppings. It was so incredible! My husband and I were happy we made two so that we had leftovers. : )

We love this. I'm making it two weeks in a row. I use Trader Joe's pizza dough and parmesan cheese. I use more olive oil so the mushrooms don't stick but otherwise I follow exactly. It's spicy and delicious.

Loved this!!! It was a hit at my cocktail party last year and I plan to make it again, this time for a girl's night in party.

This recipe is great. I've tweaked it over time to conform to ingredients that I can easily find at the grocery store down the street. I use a blend of Pecorino Romano and Parmigiano-Reggiano instead of Piave. I use both fresh thyme and rosemary on the dough. I use Linguiça (a mild Portuguese sausage), and I like to use more onions and caramelize them. And I also use quartered baby bella mushrooms since they're always available to me. The original recipe is delicious, but the great thing about pizza is its versatility.

Very light pizza and delicious.I used spicy salami instead of the sausage and used a pizza cheese mix (Mozzarella, Gruyer & Emmentaler) instead of mozzarella only. Will definitely do again!

I use hot sausage and it always turns out very well. This is a solid dish but very heavy on the stomach.

this is a fab recipe! i don't use hot sausages; i use mild instead. also, i chopped the onions one time; that, of course, was ok, too. we love this recipe so much i make it for my husband's poker night. it's a keeper!

Great pie...the rosemary really makes it good. I drizzled some olive oil over the top - just a bit - and it lent a good flavor to the toppings. This will definetely go into our friday night rotation. Highly recommend!

I followed the recipe exactly as written and it was delicious! Since then I've experimented with whole wheat crust (frozen, from Whole Foods) which was also fantastic. Any number of different mushrooms will work, and I go out of my way to get really spicy sausage. This will be a "staple" in my house!

Sorry, I'm someone who likes precise instructions and I was confused by the amount of sausage. Does it really mean two and half sausages and how do you figure out what size they're supposed to be? At first I thought they meant 2-1/2 lbs but that couldn't be. Besides that I went with what I thought would be enough and it was OK, but not great. Different enough from the regular pepperoni pizza that I'm forced to make for my family to do again though.

We used dough that we purchased from our local pizzeria..I have had no success with either homemade or store bought dough...and it was great. Our only issue is that we had to make additional onions, mushrooms and sausage once we had topped the pizza because the amounts in the recipe didn't seem like enough. We also used a combination of hot and sweet italian sausage...YUMM! Will def make this again.

The pizza came out excellent. I added red, yellow, and orange bell peppers and sauteed them with the onions. This pizza didn't need a sauce; it was delicious without it! The crust was nice and crispy in 20 minutes, and was just how I like it - paper thin.

The kind of meal you think about long after you make it... two months later, I still fondly recall the chewiness of the chanterelles, zingy sausage and perfect crust. My two dinner guests and I made quick work of it, and I shall make it again whenever I want a foolproof impress-the-guests meal.

I made this last week, and am making it again tonite, but will try dried porcinis and shitakes instead of the fresh chantrelles I had last time. I did add lots of roasted garlic and used homemade crust. It was yummy!

This was good, but not amazing. The flavors were yummy, but I felt like the whole thing was a little meaty. I know it's a sauceless pizza, but I think it could also use some kind of sauce (pesto, tomato..) to moisten it up. Needs some work.

Fantastic pizza - the cheese and rosemary in the crust is so good - the flavor combination and texture was awesome. This is the best gourmet pizza I have had - I will experiment with sun dried tomatoes and feta cheese - same crust though.

FANTASTIC recipe! I use the fresh pizza dough from Trader Joe's. We used the garlic and herb dough last night and it was delicious. Just one departure from recipe: we sprinkle corn meal instead of flour on the sheet pan. Makes crust extra crispy and doesn't stick!

Nice flavor combinations. Had to use boboli Thin Crust for a pizza. Turned out pretty good. I think I will take this to the next potluck in appetizer sizes.

Great pizza. It was my first time making a pizza and what a treat. We had a Spinach & Strawberry Salad on the side. I plan on making it tonight again. Enjoy this one!

One of the best pizzas ever! Followed the topping directions exactly, including using the piave cheese. Cooked the onions, mushrooms and sausage about 6 hours in advance of making the pizza. Used my own dough recipe. Will definitely make again and again and again.

Excellent pizza. Could also be used for appetizers. I made this with whole wheat flat bread and served it as individaul pizzas. I sprinkled the parmesan, rosemary and crushed red pepper over the flat bread and prcedded according to directions. I added a salad - Spinach and Apple Salad with Crispy Almonds. Wonderful dinner.

I have been making this recipe since I got the magazine, it is fantastic, a family favorite here, the only change is I make my own dough.

Wonderful! The first time I made it I rolled the dough after adding the cheese/rosemary mixture per the recipe, and the crust was tough, but have made it several times since, tossing the dough to it's full width before adding anything, and the results are great.

This was a great recipe. I had a friend over who doesn't like mushrooms, so I substituted yellow and red pepper. The flavor turned out wonderful; the rosemary really shines in this recipe.

This pizza was delicious - I followed the recipe exaclty and thought that it turned out very well. None of the flavors were too overpowerring, they blended together beautifully. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe rates right up there with another recipe from your sight. Grilled pizza with spicy Italian sausage. We really loved the assortment of mushrooms and carmelized onions. This is a keeper I have made it three times since I found it in the March issue.

this is delicious and pretty easy. i too used ready-made pizza crust dusted w/cornmeal. i have made twice already and will make again soon. i used smoked gruyere cheese though.

Made a small pie for my husband and I, used my pizza dough recipe (1 c bread flour, 1 1/2 t quick rising yeast, 6T warm water, 1/2 t salt and sugar, few drops evoo, mix in food processor few minutes, knead few times until smooth, rise 1 hr) turkey sausage and part- skim mozzarella. Fantastic! Have probably made 100 pizzas over the years, and this was one of the best.

Nice Friday night treat. Used a pre-made crust so I made a paste of parmesan, garlic, oil, rosemary and chili flakes to get the same basic flavors. Allergies kept us away from the mozzerella but greek feta worked very well.

This was very good and I made exactly as written. Next time I will omit the rosemary though, I found it a little overpowering.

I made this for my husband and we were very pleasantly surprised. I did change some ingredients, I am not a rosemary fan, and used basil instead, and I used sundried tomato sausage(that's what was in the freezer). The pizza was to die for! The taste was vaguely reminiscent of pizza I had three years ago when I visited Tuscany. Awesome! Nice timesaver recipe too if you have the dough in the fridge and are strapped for time.

This recipe was a lot better than I expected. I was indifferent when I started preparing the ingredients; but by the time I pulled the pizza out of the oven the flavors blended wonderfully.
