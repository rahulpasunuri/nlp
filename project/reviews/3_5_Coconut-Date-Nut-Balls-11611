I've made these a few times now and everyone loved them. I plan on making again for holiday gifts. Quick--easy-- tasty.

BACK UP PLAN: Forming this mixture into balls is questionable, mostly due to the variation of moisture in the dates. I used a back-up plan, which worked well. I added some eggs and salt, spread it 1/2" deep on a well greased shallow pan, and baked it at 325 for 20 minutes. The coconut toasted to golden, and the bite size pieces were delicious.

I love this recipe for a few reasons. It goes together so fast and is a great no-bake summer treat. My kids love to help make these and they're so much healthier than most desserts. It also lends itself to so many substitutions, though a fabulous recipe if followed exactly. I have subbed puffed rice or flax plus flaked cereal for graham crackers, raw coconut for toasted, agave syrup for honey, and sunflower seeds for walnuts. Every variation has been just as good as the original! A great party dessert as well, because it looks as good as it tastes!

Great recipe and easy to make. I substituted rice krispies, instead of graham cracker crumbs. I made a double order and stacked them high on a big tray and took them to a social with about 25-30 people. They were a big hit!!!

These tasted great, and everyone loved them. They're a great healthy desert alternative to bring to parties where there will be a lot of heavy deserts. They're also great when you need a little kick of sweetness-and keep well for a long time if in a sealed container.

This recipe was a big disappointment! My advice to anyone considering trying it is don't waste your time or money. It is truly not worth the effort! Not one of my family or friends liked it. It was so awful that I had to double check to make sure I had made it correctly.

Hello?Boston? It does say to chop the dates in the processor! Gotta read directions.

1 fork as the recipe is; it is impossible to make chopping the things by hand or one by one in a minichop, and in such a case, the recipe should specify that the food processor is indispensable. Without it,the balls were impossible to roll and awful to deal with. I ended up using them as a filling for half a recipe of Basic Butter cookie dough on this site, and that has turned into my favorite holiday cookies ever. So, as a cookie filling, this recipe is a 4-forker.
