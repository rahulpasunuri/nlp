This was a very tasty dish. It was a little messy and time consuming but worth the hassle. All my guests raved about it.

This dessert is also a Cuban Holiday tradition. I'm so greatfull this recipe was simplified & still tasty. Although, to earn the 4 fork award I would suggest you add 1 pound of cooked & mashed Yucca & 1 tsp of anise. Yucca is a type of potato you can find in your spanish supermarkets. Yummy!
