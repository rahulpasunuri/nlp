Added the suggestions of Dijon Old Bay...etc. Made in place of my hard boiled egg recipe. Oh my goodness!!

I made it the way other viewer's suggested: added dijon,substituted basil for tarragon, and I only had 6 boiled eggs....the extra crab I put in the middle of the deviled eggs dish-- which some people chose to add more crab on top of the egg. The eggs disappeared...people loved them.

Delicious. I cooked this exactly according the recipe specs but added a touch of black sevruga caviar to the top for a little salt and festive appearance.

Made the changes suggested by reviews. They were still not a huge hit. Tasted very bland. Maybe more heat from additional seasoning, would help but I won't know because I won't bother trying these again.

These were a hit at our Thanksgiving dinner. The flavors popping out in these deviled eggs were fabulous. Zesty, rich flavors of tarragon, and the cayenne pepper with the hot pepper sauce.......yum!

I added dijon (thanks!) and extra fresh lemon juice, topped with cajun seasoning (theme of the meal) and stuck some chives in each. Yum! and even better the next day on crusty, toasted whole grain bread with wild greens.

As suggested, I used basil instead of tarragon and a sprinkle of Old Bay on top. I would probably add just a bit of dijon as mentioned next time. It is a nice treat for crabmeat lovers.

I made this for a small party and split the filling; half with crab, half without. I didn't have any tarragon so I substituted some basil and dijon mustard. I only used about a quarter of the crab it called for (since I had already used half of my filling) and everyone thought they were quite good both with the crab and without.

Not the greatest deviled eggs recipe I've encountered. If I make this again, I will definitely add some dijon mustard. Someone mentioned to replace tarragon with basil. I can see this being a nice replacement.

Since I am kosher I used immitation crab. Instead of mayonaise (I was out)I used horseradish sauce. I ended up with extra filling so I cut a plum tomato in 1/2 and removed the seeds and stuffed the remaining shell. These were a welcome change from the usual gefelte fish appetizer at our Sabbath meal. They are delicious and different.

This is a GREAT recipe, IF you follow the advice of an earlier reviewer and substitute basil for the tarragon. These didn't last long when I served them at my last party; people were raving about them!

What a disappointment. I love crab and I love deviled eggs so I thought these would be terrific.....that's what I get for thinking. The flavors did not marry well at all. In a word, yuck.

We thought this was great and so did our guests.... Only change, I subbed fresh basil for the taragon (don't like the licorice like flavor). In fact we had some left over stuffing and ate it the next day as sandwich filling. We were hesitant based on the "hit or miss" reviews but were very glad we gave it a try.

These were the worst deviled eggs we ever made. We had our mother and sister over for Mother's Day and thought this would be a special treat - NOT! We will never subject our guests to such rotten eggs again!

I think the recipe is good. I reduced the shallot to 1 tablespoon, added an additional tablespoon of mayonaisse, a half a teaspoon of mustard, some worcestershire sauce and a tablespoon of sweet pickle juice to help out the flavor and consistency. It is a nice change from regular deviled eggs.

I thought these were the greatest deviled eggs. I made them for my family for Mother's Day Brunch and my in-laws are still talking about them. Thanks Bon Appetit!

I am shocked by the first reviewers. While these are very different from deviled eggs, they make a very tasty treat. I made them at Easter and my family could not get enough of them. We have shared the recipe and everyone is in agreement. When are we making them again?

What a disappointment! I made these for my mother-in-law, who makes THE best deviled eggs in the world. What a mistake. She was very gracious and said they were good, but they weren't. Very dry and a waste of good crabmeat.

$12 worth of crab for 16 very mediocre deviled eggs? No. My daughter, who loves crab, said that she likes my traditional deviled eggs much better.I agree.

I'm so surprised that I'm the first reviewer, These eggs were great. I had them for 4th of July weekend guests and we loved them - easy to make too whata bonus!
