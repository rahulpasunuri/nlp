A surprisingly simple recipe for a fun and flavorful banh mi! I've eaten banh mi in New York and San Francisco, and this is a pretty good homemade alternative. When made in bulk, the hot chili mayo and pickled vegetable can last for a few days, and the meatballs can be frozen raw, or cooked.

Rating: 4
This is really delicious! The only thing I would change is that I would cut back to 1/4 t or 1/2 t salt next time in the meat. I used ground chicken instead of pork and it was terrific. Yum!

Rating: 4
Really, REALLY a great recipe! I omitted the salt entirely from the meatball mixture. I assure you that the fish sauce provides ample salt. I used a slightly different recipe for pickled carrots (my store didn't have daikon), and had actually made those a day ahead. I added sliced cucumbers to the garnish. The meatball mixture would make fantastic burgers or sliders, and might be a little easier to serve for a party or picnic. This one is a keeper.

Full of flavors and people seem to respond so well to these! Yum.

I love this recipe. One of my go-to dishes. In my opinion, it makes too much slaw. I cut down the amount of carrot and daikon so there's not so much left over. The sauce (mayo + onion + sriracha) is pretty awesome for french fries too, if that's something that floats your boat.

Rating: 0
This sandwich has fantastic balance. Sweet, salty... a bit of heat from the Siracha.... I have read the other reviews that the meatballs are too salty- I believe it may be the fish sauce and the amount of time you let the meatballs rest before cooking... the longer you wait, the more the salt will go through the meat. I suggest undersalting if you are preparing them overnight. But a fantastic sandwich!! Will definitely make again.

Love this sandwich! I live in the country and do not have access to a banh mi shop, so this fits the bill. The meatballs freeze well, too.

Rating: 3
I doubted all the previous reviews that said the meatballs were too salty, assuming they had used table salt or something instead of the coarse kosher salt called for in the recipe. But I followed the instructions to the letter, including the right grind of salt, and found the meatballs to be too salty. Next time I'll start with half the salt, and cook a test meatball to taste prior to forming the rest. That said, this was really delicious. Oven-baked sweet potato fries made a great side dish, too.

This is an awesome recipe. I couldn't find daikon here in France so substituted with cucumber as suggested by other reviewers. Thank you Epicurious!

Even my picky mother who thinks garlic is an exotic spice loved these. Not all that much more hassle than hamburgers, but a very nice change of pace. Next time, I'll make more meatballs and freeze them.

Really great recipe that is really easy to prepare. Next time I might make extra and try freezing them for easy meals when I'm working late. Formed into patties, this also makes great burgers/sliders.

These are incredible! We don't eat pork but have found ground turkey to be an acceptable substitute. The hot chili mayo and daikon carrot coleslaw are the keys to this dish. And don't forget the jalapeno slices if you like a little extra heat.

If I could only eat one dish for the rest of my life, it would be this.

This was a family hit and easy to make. I would definitely halve the salt next time and use 1/2 the sugar as well. My market didn't have daikon, so I used a packaged coleslaw bag. I used panini buns as well as they're not as hard on little ones mouths as a baguette would be. I misread the directions and added the sesame oil to the veggies, but it tasted TERRIFIC. However, the chili mayo was not noticeable, so I would just save myself the trouble and use regular mayo. The recipe also makes 10X more mayo than a person needs, so definitely cut the amount in half (at least!). Wonderful flavours! Next time I'll try it with turkey for a lower fat option.

Rating: 4
Delicious! The meatballs were FAR too salty, so I'd recommend cutting the salt in half. I served the meatballs over rice with the carrots and cucumber (we didn't have daikon on hand). Exceptional.

I am giving only the meat a 3 "delicious" rating since we made sliders with it, and grilled them. Pickled red onions, cilantro and a hoisin aioli. Turned out great. Served with sweet potato fries. Was a great weeknight meal. Will make again. Am freezing a few to see how they turn out.

This recipe is exceptional. My first attempt at replicating my favorite vietnamese dish, and I was not let down! The meatballs are a breeze to make, and their flavors are subtle, complex and fantastic! The chili mayo was a HUGE hit as well. I made these three times, once for a test batch (to be reviewed by a group of friends), once for a fancy cocktail engagement party, and then again by request for a superbowl party. All three times these were the crowd favorite, and I ran out waaaaaaaay before the parties were over. They are good in the sandwich or without the bread, I just topped them with shredded purple cabbage, julienned carrots, thinly sliced jalapenos & the chili mayo. Will absolutely make again and again!

Rating: 4
This is one of my favorite recipes ever. Recently I became a vegetarian and thought I'd have to give this recipe up- not so! Yesterday I made it with drained, extra firm tofu and it WORKED! I skipped the baking step and just cooked the "meat"balls in the sesame oil and voila. Delicious. I also saved some uncooked meatballs to make the next day and I think they were even better.

Rating: 4
This sandwich was worth the work. I used 93/7 turkey and it didn't make a difference in flavour. I skipped the daikon since I don't like it but added asian pickled cucumber instead (my own recipe). don't skimp on the sriracha in the mayo...the kick is needed to round out the sandwich. My husband said it was even better the next day

Rating: 4
This is a great recipe. I made it exactly as written and loved it. Additionally I have used it as a "base recipe" for what has been my favorite sandwich -- which is exactly the same (pickled veggies, sriracha mayonnaise, cilantro) but with a marinated skirt steak. Use this marinade for that: http://savour-fare.com/2009/04/03/steakbanhmi/ Try it to mix it up a little.

Rating: 4
Wonderful banh mi that we will definitely be making again. I love that you can make the meatballs in advance (even cook and freeze them if you want), so that you could throw this together quickly. And the texture of the meatballs is perfection; they're perfectly meaty and springy! Definitely listen to the other reviewers and do not use as much sugar as they call for. I also used soy sauce instead of salt in the slaw, and since we have no daikon out here, I just used a mixture of julienned carrots and cucumbers.

Rating: 4
Made these when the recipe first came out and like them, but found them to be a bit to "porky" in flavor for my taste. Made them again with 1/2 grd.pork and 1/2 grd. beef. Made them into patties and served them on a crispy homemade foccacia sliced in half. Excellent!!!! So glad my CSA farmer has such great diakon.

A very good sandwich. The spicy mayo was terrific, although I cut back a bit on the sriracha sauce. I agree with those who thought the veggies were a bit too sweet, and would cut down on the sugar there. I substituted ground turkey for the pork with good results.

This is a solid sandwich with tons of flavour! We didn't have any daikon so instead I shred green onion and seeded jalapenos and pickled them with the carrots. It was delicious! I made extra meatballs too and froze them for a quick lunch/supper later this week.

Oh man, are these good! I used a combo of pork and turkey. Since there are only 2 of us, I froze the rest of the meatballs for future. Couldn't find daikon so subbed in cuke, like others. It is a refreshing and flavorful sandwich. This is going into regular rotation for our date nite!

Loved this way more than I expected! followed the recipe as stated- but cut the portions by half, for just the BF and me. I think I skimped on the salt a little, since others mentioned it was a little salty- I didn't measure it, just kind of eyeballed it. The chili mayo, plus the meatballs, plus the carrot and daikon - sos o good!

Rating: 4
Really good. I used half the salt required for the meatballs. I could not find daikon at my store so I used cucumber. Other than those changes, I made the recipe as written. This one is definitely a winner (the whole family loved it) and will be made again. We had a 2003 Riesling with it which was a perfect complement.

Rating: 4
Seriously good. I made mine with ground chicken (mixture of white & dark meat) and froze the meatballs in advance. I prepped them w/o thawing, just baked them off in the oven a bit longer than is called for in the recipe. I omitted jalapenos and diakon. Overall, a great recipe.

Rating: 4
Excellent! I can't remember ever having a sandwich I liked more. Substituted sliced cucumber for the diakon but otherwise made exactly as written. Next time I'll reduce the salt in the meatballs, they were a bit salty for my taste. Aside from that, I'd say this recipe is perfect.

These meatballs are very good, but I think they are very salty and also very garlicy - and I like garlic. The second time I made this recipe I omitted the salt and used 2 garlic cloves - much better. I have also made this recipe with added minced water chestnuts and substituted cilantro for basil. The salad for the sandwich is a must and very delicious, as it the hot chili mayo - yum.

Really good sandwich, and really easy to make again and again once you have all the seasoning ingredients lying around. And if you're feeling lazy you can just scramble the meat instead of forming the balls, which is what I did the second time.

Wow, this just blew my mind. The spicy mayo is my new favorite condiment! The pork meatballs are fantastic as well. Be sure not to skimp on the seasonings and herbs, they are what make this recipe. Don't over mix either, the balls I ended up with were nearly falling apart when I put them in the pan, but this makes for tender meatballs. Daikon is hard to come by in my neck of the prairie, so I thinly shave regular old red radishes. Many of the Vietnamese restaurants use them anyway, and they provide the same sharp bite intended here. A good crusty bread is key, the crackle of a nice crust sets off the tender meatballs and fresh veggies.

Everyone was speaking to the messiness of the dish, so I decided to make this into a loaf. I cooked it until just barely done, drained, cooled, and chilled in the fridge. The next day I sliced the loaf into 1/4 slabs and fried them in the sesame oil in my CI which gave the crispiness needed. Easy Peasy! It was still a little messy, but at least I didn't have unruly, squished meatballs. This one is a winner!!

This is my go-to dinner for my boyfriend and myself. The sandwich is messy but we don't really care. I skip the "slaw" - I just don't feel it's necessary, the sandwich is fantastic without. Also, I substitue hoisin sauce for the fish sauce. Really adds an interesting flavor and the meatballs come out very moist.

Made this for a party as an appetizer by allowing guests to assemble their own "sliders". Made the meatballs smaller (can also cut them in half) and used dinner rolls for the bread. Amazing!

Rating: 4
This is one of my favorite recipes from this site, it's incredibly flavorful. I have an incredibly hard time managing to not eat all of it, but I try to save some because it makes amazing leftovers. The only changes I make are to leave out the jalapenos as the sriracha makes it pretty hot as it is, and I don't bother with forming meatballs, I just toss the meatball mixture in a pan and break it up as I cook it. It makes it a lot easier and faster, plus it's easier to get a better distribution of meat in the sandwich if they're not formed into meatballs.

Rating: 4
To repeat what everyone else is saying, these sandwiches are amazing. I couldn't find ground pork so I used ground turkey- despite my reservations they turned out delicious! The hot chili mayo was yummy reminded me of the spicy sauce I sometimes get with sushi. The pickled veggies were also delicious, although I agree with the reviewer who said they don't hold up well the next day. They kept their crunch find (even though I grated them using my food processor), but were a little overly fermented the next day and smelled very strong. Next time, I'll make a fresh batch for leftovers (and I'll probably pickle the jalapeno as well). I used a soft sausage bun, and really think these meatballs need a heartier bun, like a hoagie bun. Excellent!

I followed this recipe exactly, and I hate to be the one downer, but it just didn't really blow my mind. In particular I thought it was way too sweet. The sugar perhaps? The pickled vegetables were really good and I dug the mayo. The cilantro and jalapeno were both excellent additions as well. The meatballs just didn't do it for me though. Also I used a pretty dense French baguette and wished I had used something a little lighter.... So I suppose my primary suggestions would be less sugar and a lighter bread. I should also add that I made it for four other people, all of whom seemed to really enjoy it... I hope the rest of you have as good an experience as they did. As for me? No thanks.

DELICIOUS! Followed the recipe to the letter and (because I'm ridiculous) weighed out my meatballs to 20-21g each, making them the perfect size for our baguette. Will make all summer for sure. Made the Salt & Pepper Oven Fries (BA May 07) and it was the perfect duo. Only suggestion is that it says this feeds four, but that would be a very polite four, not the hungry-and-loving-this-sandwich type four. ;)

I made these sandwiches with a piece of leftover pork filet. I sliced the meat into thin slices (raw) and then coated it with the mixture of ingredients that should have gone into the meatballs. I browned them quickly in a pan and then we made the sandwiches with all the rest of the goodies, as written. It worked out well, since it was the same combination of flavors.

Loved the hot chili mayo. Meatballs were good but a bit too "porky" for me,when making again will try a blend of pork and grd beef or chicken or turkey or maybe lamb. Grated is not the way to go for the "salad". Started and realized it was going to be way to thin, so stopped and julienned as shown in the picture. Daikon was worth the search. When making again I will also probably try the forming into small patties and using ciabatta as the bread as recommended by others. The meatballs and salad would also be great served over rice noodles.

Rating: 4
This recipe is so good that my husband and I have made it a once-a-month must-have. Be sure to make the slaw *first*. The mayo is quite spicy, so be careful as to how much you slather on your sandwich. The recipe makes quite a lot of meatballs and slaw. I like to take the leftovers and serve them atop salad greens, with just a bit of the mayo as the dressing. Delicious!

I made a few changes: ground turkey instead of pork, baked the meatballs on a cookie sheet greased with sesame oil at 375 for 35 minutes, added sliced serrano peppers right into the carrot salad (didn't have jalapenos), used turnips instead of daikon (didn't have daikon), didn't add salt to the mayo mixture. The sandwiches came out terrific! Next time, I'm going to cut down on the salt and fish sauce in the meatballs since they came out a little too salty. Also I'm going to try light mayo instead of the regular to lighten things up a bit more. I think with the addition of the Sriracha sauce and scallions, I won't miss the fat in the mayo at all.

Having just visited Vietnam and sampled banh mi, I was very excited to see this 4-fork recipe. While I can't actually remember what the sandwiches I had in Vietnam tasted like, these were outstanding. Instead of pork, I used turkey and the meat was declicious. I also made little flattened patties instead of meatballs because I had round kaiser rolls and I thought they'd stay inside the sandwich better. I had trouble with both the carrots and the cucumber on my mandoline, so I wound up grating the vegetables. Contrary to other reviewers' experience, the slaw was quite crunchy, even the following day. I highly recommend this recipe. It was different, fun, and delicious.

ADDICTIVE. I have made these three times in the last two weeks, double batches all. I echo the recommendation to julienne the veggies, and also to cook the meatballs in the oven.

FANTASTIC! My group for the Superbowl claimed that these sandwiches were better than what we get from our local Vietnamese Deli. I took the suggestion to julienne the carrot and daikon and that was definitely a good suggestion, as they held up better in the pickling liquid. I also added cuke, which really brightened the flavor. If you can, try to find true mini baguettes like they use in the delis. The chewy-soft really adds to the whole experience. Will definitely make again soon!

These have turned into a bit of an addiction at our home. I just finished making 4xs the original recipe to have these babies on hand. Full. of. flavor. I used cilantro instead of basil in the meatballs as I can't seem to remember to pick up basil (and the little containers are quite expensive), and it still tastes amazing!! Oh, and I've been mixing ground beef with the pork...good stuff.

Wonderful! So I made some changes for health reasons - I used ground turkey breast instead of the pork, and I was sure I was not going to be happy with my decision. Boy, was I wrong - the combination of flavors from the basil, green onions, and Sriracha made the lack of fat un-noticeable. As a result, we now have a quick, light dinner option for a weeknight!

These were great! I made them for a casual girls' day, and plan on making them again for a Super Bowl party. For this, I will make a double batch. I will cut two large subs into small sandwiches. They were on the spicy side, especially with the jalapeno, but were very tasty. I will only make half the carrot/daikon mixture next time, and will probably still have leftovers. I also made a vegetarian version for one of my friends with fried tofu that had marinated in soy sauce, sriracha, and orange juice. She said it was very good, and definitely had enough flavor.

Moving away from easy access to Vietnamese cuisine was pretty rough, but this recipe brought back such a rush of delicious memories. We don't have daikon radishes in NZ, so we used sliced cucumbers. Also, it's much less fussy to simply cut your carrots and cucumbers/radish into long, thin boards instead of julienne or grated (less filling falls out that way). Used regular mayo slathered thick - it all tasted very close to the stuff from the shops I used to go to. Served leftover meatballs the next day over a rice vermicelli salad (called 'bun') with sliced lettuce, mint and basil leaves, bean sprouts, cucumber, and fish sauce (nuoc mam) - perfect summer fare!

Amazing! Skipped the daikon. Went with cucumber. We did NOT need as much of this carrot / cucumber as the recipe called for. I made half what they suggested and we used only half of that. As most said, I cooked meatballs in a cast iron skillet and put in the oven for 10 minutes after that. I don't like the feel of cilantro stems in my mouth, so we stuck with the leaves. A winner here. I love the idea of using the mayo to dip french fries. I wish I could make fries worthy of the sauce.

Incredible! It was so fun to make and tasty to consume. I did half ground chicken/half pork for the meatballs and could not find a daikon, so I used sliced bok choy. We had some extra meatballs and not enough rolls, so I broke up the meatballs, spread some chili sauce mixed with rice vinegar and siracha on flatbreads, and made pizzas with the remaining grated carrots, sliced bok choy, and mozzarella. Outstanding!

WOW. Make this! I followed the recipe as written but took it easy on both the salt and sugar. Was even better the next day for lunch... especially the mayo and the carrot/daikon mix. YUMMMMM!

Man, just writing about this recipe makes me hungry--it was DE-licious. Followed it to the letter and thought the salt content was fine (but then again, I do love salt). Next time I will double the meatball part of the recipe. Make it!

Delicious! I couldn't find daikon at the store, but otherwise made this as written. We served it with a Vietnamese noodle salad.

Thanks to this recipe I am a "superstar" with the guys. These are perfect - followed the recipe to a "T"

These were absolutely delicious - Also would make again but I would use a little less hot sauce. I also will make more meatballs next time and freeze them for an appetizer or another meal. And ditto on nixing the salt completely don't need it.

Hubby and I really loved the meatballs, sauce and 'salad' portion of the recipe but, we just didn't care for the ingredients in the sandwich format. We will make this again but with noodles or as an appetizer as other reviewers have suggested.

I've been hearing lots of buzz about Banh Mi's and always keep some Sriracha on hand, so when I saw this sandwich on the Today show I knew I had to try it. I made it exactly as written and it was amazing; it's my new favorite ssndwich and now a permanent part of my repertoire.

This was fantastic! The carrot and daikon added a fantastic crunch to the sandwich making it exceptional - well worth it! This is an easy dish to make and party worthy. I will serve this at our next cocktail party - perhaps on mini rolls to make it portable.

very good .... but why hasn't anyone else mentioned that the recipe fails to tell you how long the meatballs should stay in the oven?

Loved it! Great flavors, will definetly be making this again. Did omit the jalapenos, otherwise made exactally as written.

Super delicious and could be served a number of ways -- appetizer, sandwich, super bowl dish. I made the sandwiches as written (only substitute was cucumber for the daikon) and it was gobbled down nearly instantaneously.

Great!! My husband said he'd like to eat them 3 times a week from now on. :) I substituted ground venison but otherwise made them true to the recipe. Amazing, will definitely plan on making them again! Next time I would probably double (or triple?) the meatballs and freeze the rest to have on hand. Would make a great addition to a tapas menu too.. maybe served on toothpicks on a bed of the pickled veggies and drizzled with sauce?

Rating: 4
Delicious!!!! This recipe gets FIVE forks from me and my fiance. I only made the following changes: cucumber instead of daikon b/c I liked a previous reviewer's suggestion of the coolness of the cucumber playing nicely against all the spice in the sandwich (glad I did it - was great!), also nixed the salt altogether. All else exactly as directed and it was amazing!!! This will become a staple - has to, otherwise what will I do with all this fish sauce?! : )

Rating: 4
So much flavor! I just loved it. I used bean sprouts instead of daikon, but everything else followed the recipe. I made oven fries to go with it, and used the chili mayo as a dipping sauce. Delicious!

Rating: 4
This was delicious! The entire family was a big fan of it. Next time I might cut down on the salt as the fish sauce is enough sodium to carry the dish. I'm thinking this would be a perfect Superbowl item.

This was a hit with the whole family. We tried cooking the meatballs in the oven, as several reviewers suggested but didn't like the look or texture so did the rest in the frying pan, as per the recipe, and they were perfect! Only changes I made were to the salad: I added half a finely shredded chinese cabbage and a de-seeded hothouse cucumber instead of the daikon, plus a handful of finely chopped mint. Oh, and I substituted splenda for the sugar. A great family supper with lovely fresh clean flavours.

this was delicious!!! i used cucumbers instead of daikon because i couldn't find any, but otherwise kept ingredients the same. i also baked the meatballs at 400 for 20 minutes to avoid frying and it came out wonderfully.

Super yummy! Loved the spicy mayo. I omitted jalapenos but upped the Sriracha in both the mayo and the meatballs. Perfectly spiced. Even better the next day!

For a sunset cruise I needed an appetizer for our guests that do not like sushi. I wanted to offer a dish that would compliment the oriental theme. I made the meatballs much smaller and served them as an appetizer with toothpicks. I put the meatballs on top of the vegetables with the sauce on the side for dipping. I took the advice from the reviews and julienned the carrot, cucumber, radish mixture and baked the meatballs omitting the pan step. I added the sesame oil to the meatball mixture for flavor and moisture. They were a big hit with my guests. Very, very easy.

Rating: 4
seriously, this was incredible. i've made many recipes off of epicurious over the years, but this was off the charts. i had a kilo of ground pork, so played with the amounts a bit and it was amazing. used cuke and cabbage to sub for the daikon. i agree about baking the meatballs being easier, but worried about losing a little sesame flavor, so browned them and finished in the oven. again, this is 10 forks if done right. if you like asian and pork, you've found your dish.

Rating: 4
Fantastic. Made a veggie version tonight using 2 packs of Yves meatless ground round in place of the pork, and increasing all other meatball ingredients to 1.5x. Added julienned cucumber to the veg, but otherwise left the recipe unchanged. It was easy, flavorful, fresh tasting and delicious. This recipe deserves the raves it has received.

We loved this. It ewas spicy and delicious! I did substitute peeled red radish for the daikon. I also added the jalapeno (which I sliced paper thin) in with the carrot and radish to pickle. I julienned the veggies rather than grating. Fantastic!

Rating: 4
Great flavor, like some of the other reviewers, I baked mine in a 400 degree oven for 25-30 min, turning one. I also basted with the sesame oil. I also julienned some cucumbers to cool off the spice from the sirachi and the jalapenos. I didn't use fish sauce, I just added a little water and few extra dashes of salt.

Rating: 4
Fantastic recipe! I skipped the jalapenos, but did everything else per the recipe and it was a great balance of flavors & spice. I would julienne the carrots & daikon next time for better texture.

Had no pork in the house so used ground beef. It was very very good, though pork would probably be better. Also used julienned red pepper instead of daikon. So delicious. Will make undoubtedly again.

Absolutely delish. Followed the receipe but doubled the meatballs so that I'd have some leftovers for another meal with rice noodles. Will definitely make again but will leave out the salt in the meatballs next time as it is not needed. This is seriously yum.

We loved this. I used 2 ciabatta rolls and 2 hoagie rolls, the hoagie bread was better. Used dried basil and fresh cilantro. Loved the fresh jalapeno slices too. Also halved the salt in the relish and didn't add any to the meatballs. Very, very good.

Rating: 4
This was fabulous and fairly simple. I followed the advice of the other readers and omitted the jalepenos, could'nt find the raddish, and moderated on the sugar and sriracha sauce. We love it. I will totally make this again! It'd be interesting to try with sietan.

Absolutely delicious!! Don't change a thing. Make them just as instructed. Ten times better than any that I've had here in Seatle's Little Saigon.

I ran across this recipe in my girlfriends magazine while flying cross country for the holidays - needless to say I thought about that full color photo for a week! I'm a big fan of the classic banh mi, and was excited to try this twist. We made the recipe exactly as listed except our local market was out of daikon. And like in the magazine picture, we julienned the carrots. I could not believe the amount of flavors in the meatballs, not to mention the wonderful smells in the apartment. This is a top-notch and simple recipe, and the ingredients should not be altered - except perhaps for the jalapenos as they can overwhelm. The next time I will try finishing in the oven to give the meatballs that crisp outside layer of the photo.

Rating: 3
I would agree.....bake at 400 for 22 minutes. Only other revision would be to add only 1/2 a teaspoon of black pepper, not a full teaspoon. A full teaspoon begins to dominate the taste...the combination of the 1/2 teaspoon of the black pepper and the hot chili sauce is more than enough sharpness. But this is a great, easy, and quick recipe. Thanks!

Will this taste right without all the little weevils we always found in the bread in Viet Nam?

This was SOOOO good!! I agree with other reviewers about finishing the meatballs in the oven. We grated the carrots and they got a little mushy, wished we had julienned them.

Rating: 4
Great recipe! I made these when the issue hit, and there are some good reviews that I will take note of: Next time I will try pickling the jalapeno to help tame the heat a bit. Also, julienne the carrots and daikon instead of shredding them to achieve the authentic sort of texture, otherwise you get a little mush instead of crisp. And I love the finishing in the oven idea, less spatter and less fried food smell! I'm all for it. ;)

This was delicious. I am not a pork lover, but decided to try because the flavours sounded interesting. Like other reviewers, I baked them in the oven instead of pan frying. I tripled the recipe to serve 9 people and there wasn't one meatball left. Served it with the Arugula, Carmelized Fennel & Orange Salad from the same issue. Amazing.

This was really, really great. All the flavors worked so well together and it was fun to make as well. I could not find the daikon radish, so I subbed shredded red cabbage for it and it was still awesome.

This recipe exceeded my expectations. My boyfriend is in love with it and wants me to make it every week. The only deviation from the recipe is that I browned them in the skillet and then finished them in a 425 oven. It is delicious!

I made this for dinner last night. Pretty much per the recipe, except as several reviewers did, I just roasted them in the oven to save myself time and mess on a weeknight. They were fantastic. As there are just two of us, I've got leftover meatballs that I'm going to serve with a Vietnamese noodle salad for dinner tonight.

I just had this for dinner and this came out way better than I could ever have imagined. I love the regular bbq pork banh mi so I thought I'd give it a try. Like a lot of others I excluded the jalapenos - the mayo is spicy enough with the sriracha. I also couldn't find the radish; so I used cucumbers julienned, instead (because that is what they put on the banh mi sandwiches in the Viet shops). I browned the meatballs in a cast iron skillet then baked them in the same skillet for 10 minutes because using two baking sheets just doesn't seem necessary. The result was awesome. I will have these for Superbowl!

I made these for my husband who is an avid Vietnamese food fan and he loved them. I used bell peppers instead of sliced jalapenos for the sandwiches, and seasoned rice vinegar because that's what I had on hand, and they were delicious. We will definitely make these again!

the sandwiches were tasty and spicy, and delicious. I made exactly as the recipe states, with the sole exception being that I didn't use sliced jalapenos on the sandwich itself. I highly recommend the recipe's instructions for cooking the meatballs to get the best texture and taste results.

Very tasty and easy. Ground pork was difficult to come by, so I followed the instructions in the back of Bon Appetit for grinding your own meat. Will be making it again.

The best recipe of the year. I seriously have intrusive thoughts about how good these meatballs are. It's the perfect combo of hot and sweet and salt and sugar and crunch and pork. So good. My only recommendation is to julienne the veggies instead of grating them. They hold up better.

Rating: 4
Made these tonight for my family, doubled the recipe and had about 6 extra meatballs I stuck in freezer for next time. I didn't have sriracha, so AGAIN I used sweet hot chili sauce (seems to be a reoccurring addition) it made the mayo so spicy and yet sweet and was a perfect compliment to the salty pork! I can see making these for a (superbowl) party or any other occasion that calls for finger food!

Rating: 4
Nice sandwich! For the slaw I doubled the rice vinegar (1/2 cup) and added juice from one lime (different acid) with just under 1/2 cup of sugar (1:1 is too sweet). I heated the mixture in the microwave for 45 seconds to help with dissolving the sugar. I added enough water to ensure everything was submerged. Next time I might add the jalapeno to the mix since I believe it will diffuse the hot. For the meatballs, I cook quickly over high heat then bake to finish in a 350 degree oven. I keep them from drying out by using toothpicks to suspend them over the individual minimuffin cups filled with a little water. This keeps them moist while allowing some additional fat to drain off. The mayonaise was nice and lowfat will not impact the final product. The heat is offset by the slaw. The sandwich benefits from a softer bread with a wet slaw (don't strain). Whole meatballs as depicted in the photo also work better. Enjoy!

I made these to take to a New Year's Eve party; they were terrific, and I'm glad I doubled the recipe. I used my Cuisinart to chop up the garlic, basil and onions then added all of the remaining ingredients to combine prior to adding the pork. I'm not sure how anyone could say they weren't flavorful (unless they substituted pork for turkey or something?); I was concerned about adding the fish sauce AND salt since fish sauce is soooo salty, but these were perfectly seasoned with just the right amount of kick. To keep things easy, I made them several hours in advance, used an ice cream scoop to portion out the meatballs and baked them at 400 (on a foil-lined baking sheet) for 15-20 minutes. I stuck toothpicks in them and served them w/ the spicy mayonnaise. They were delicious and got great reviews. I'll definitely make them again.

The only sub I made was red radish because our grocer did not have Daikon. I used a food processor to do the grating. Great sandwich and I think it would freeze well (we ate it all in two days so none left to try).

Outstanding. Making this (again) for New Year's Eve. Makes a great hors d'ouerve as well - cut assembled sandwiches into 2" lengths and skewer with toothpicks.

I wish the meatballs had just a little more flavor on their own but all in all I really loved the combination of flavors. I actually made these as lettuce wraps rather than on bread.

This was awesome! We made it with ground turkey (the ground pork I found was too high-fat) and put it over rice noodles with the vegetables. It tastes like a plate full of spring rolls. Even my six- year-old ate it eagerly. It's a keeper! The meatballs are very strong flavored, you definitely need bread or noodles. I highly recommend, and it's not hard to make.

This is excellent! I wish I would have doubled the recipe for more leftovers! A good and fresh bread is key. I up the amount of sriracha a bit because we like it spicy. I used picked jalapenos instead of fresh. Follow the recipe otherwise. I would use less sugar for the pickling next time.
