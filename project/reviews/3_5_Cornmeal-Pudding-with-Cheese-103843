THIS WAS SO MUCH BETTER THAN IT SEEMED AT FIRST. All my guests loved it. Make it with the pork stew, it complements it perfectly.

This was a simple delicious side dish, or main dish for lunch, and I've made it several times. I wanted to try it because I'd met some people from Georgia who were always telling me about their food, and who had described to me something very similar to this dish. When I saw the recipe in Gourmet, I was delighted. Not sorry I tried it.

I'm a hillbilly from the backwoods of Kentucky and I grow all those seasonings in my garden, except fenugreek. (Since it's native to Southern Europe, I could probably grow it, too.) My brother was a pork producer for years and my best friends' daughter, a student at Berea College, dates a Georgian. You bet I'll try this.
