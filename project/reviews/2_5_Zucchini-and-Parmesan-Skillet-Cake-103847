This recipe doesn't work. The flavors are nice and summery, but as a skillet cake it's a total flop. When I tried to flip it out of the pan, the whole thing fell apart and was a goopy-looking mess. It tasted fine but was definitely not a skillet cake. Next time, I'm going to try starting it on the stove top and instead of flipping it, finishing it in the oven and hopefully will have better results. I also think it would be nice to have some texture, so may try a layer of breadcrumbs or panko on the bottom and top to give some more crunch. I wouldn't make this recipe again as written, but will play around with it to see how I can improve it.

I altered this a bit to make it much easier to cook. It's very much like a spaghetti pie (or frittata) that I make, minus the spaghetti. No need to fuss with layering vegetables. I just shredded the zucchini, added minced garlic, basil and grated parmesan to it along with 1 or 2 beated eggs (depending on how much zucchini you've got grated). I mixed it all together nicely and then poured it all in a heated and oiled or buttered skillet. I let it cook about 10 minutes or so then carefully flipped it over onto a plate. Slide it back into the hot skillet to cook the other side. Cut into wedges and serve with more Parmesan cheese or with marinara sauce, which I do sometimes. You could do this with any leftover vegetable on hand as well. It's my favorite dish to make with leftover spaghetti and/or vegetables. Add what you like.

I let it cook about 10 minutes or so until it looks browned on the bottom (just lift an edge and check). Place a large plate over the pan and then carefully flip it over, then slide it back into the hot skillet to cook the other side.

Well, I decided to make this a cake afterall, I sliced the Zucchini as directed. The I coated the slices in a batter of self rising four,one egg, and milk. Fry batches of squash in just enough vegetable oil to brown them. Keep browned zucchini aside as you saute a sliced onion and three cloves of garlic until oion is soft. Layer , in a non-stick skillet, onion, squash, cheese, three maybe layers, depending on all the squash eaten by hungry folks. Although this version has a little more fat, it is delicious and offers more than a side dish.

Boring, greasy, messy, and bland. Much like you would expect from frying zucchini and cheese together for 20 minutes.

Tastes great, looks absolutely disgusting. I added more garlic than called for, one clove of garlic is always 5 cloves too few. This hardly looked anything like a skillet cake, it looked like a glop of zucchini. I was too late in turning the cake and it charred a bit at the bottom, but that highlighted the garlic very well. Next time I won't even bother to try and make this look like a cake, just serve as it turns out.

I'm glad I didn't read the reviews, because I would never have made it. However! We loved it! Granted, it didn't "unmold" as well as I'd have liked, but it was SO GOOD! I thought I was overcooking the zucchini, but not to worry ... it is delicious! And low calorie! Does life get any better???

could have used more flavor, but an easy recipe using vegetables.

I should have read the above reviews first before making this dish. I had exactly the same problem the cook from Oakland, Maine had. Delicious, but I was left with a heap of zucchini. I will try this recipe one more time, but next time I'll follow E. Milne's suggestion of sprinkling parmesan cheese on top, lowering the heat and covering the pan until melted. This should do it. Freshly grated parmesan cheese is ofcourse a must as is fresh basil, of which I added more than what was required. My husband and I liked this recipe alot and look forward to having it again with the minor change.

The ingredients go so very well together. I enjoyed every bite. I didn't layer the zucchini and cheese, however. I sprinkled the cheese over top of the zucchini, garlic, S & P and basil, covered it until cheese melted together and slid it onto plate. Delicious flavor.

I feel I need to add this information since my husband and I both loved it.(he is not a real vegie lover. First question do you like zucchini? Second question is it fresh and young? I used fresh picked small (about 9 inches no longer), a stir fry skillet with non-stick surface and fresh shreaded parmsean cheese (not of all things the kind that comes in tubs off the shelf)!!! Have pan hot enough when you start the it browns fast with out making it into mush. I flip it several times put the cheese over top you could add seasoned breadcrumbs as well. Turn down heat, I cover with lid about 2 mins. and instead of fliping over I slide it out of pan. believe me I have eaten zucchini in any way that I find a recipe for and this one rates top of my list.

I used grated Parmesan from a can and found that it doesn't really melt well enough, it kind of browns instead. I think this might be better with something like sharp Cheddar or something soft that will melt easily and mix with the zucchini.

Very simple and it looks great, everyone had something to say obout it.

I was pretty disappointed with this recipe. Although the mixture tasted fine once cooked, I couldn't get it to stay in any kind of form whatsoever, and flipping was purely impossible. In the end, I wound up with a heap of zucchini mush that tasted alright, but surely wasn't worthwhile.
