I don't give four forks very often, but this is truly a surprising and enjoyable dish. Perhaps the more so for it's humble ingredients. I made this in my wok, an ideal vessel as this is really a stir fry dish with a slow simmer at the end. Also used hot sopressata instead of bacon and had to add a teaspoon or two of olive oil as those who used prosciutto did. The only other modification I made was a mushroom-heavy veggie broth instead of the chicken broth. I liked the earthy richness that added to the dish. I might use 3/4C of veggie (or chicken) broth and 1/4 C dry white wine next time. I'm at a loss to explain why you need to blanch the fennel and celery separately (but for the exact same amount of time); also not sure why you'd use two bowls of ice water ... I did both together in the boil and chill and it worked splendidly.

Absolutely delicious - family and friends raved. I drained much of the bacon fat away. I blanched the fennel and celery together, and I think you could even skip this step - the cooking down in chicken broth is probably enough. Added a little dried thyme which gave a nice depth of flavor and appearance. This was excellent and I would definitely make again (especially if I had someone else to prep the veg!)

This is the first time I have ever prepared fennel. I have been curious about it, however, because I have seen it so often on restaurant menus recently. I was preparing venison and this sounded like a good accompanyment. It was terrific and my wife loved it. I used prosciutto instead of bacon and this was very good. Since this does not render much fat, a little additional olive oil is necessary to finish the dish.

The dish was tasty, sauteed prosciutto would make an interesting substitution for the bacon which was a bit ordinary. BEWARE! The picture attached to this recipe is inaccurate. I referred to the print version of Gourmet December 2000 and discovered this was not a baked dish which quickly changed my approach to make it ahead and reheat it on Thanksgiving day. Not a recipe to make when you are really busy in the kitchen.

I have already made this dish twice. A little different, but not too much so. Everyone liked it. I used onion as I was out of shallots. Worked fine.

While this is something I would have never chosen to make, now that I have I'm sure to make it again. Since it was part of the Gourmet December 2000 Christmas dinner, I decided to go for it. The flavors were mild and delicious. The fennel was not strong at all, and the bacon complimented it perfectly. Everyone politely took a little the first time the serving plate went around the table, but it turned out that there were no leftovers of this dish!
