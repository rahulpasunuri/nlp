I've made this a few times, with burrata when I can find it, or with chevre if I can't. It's festive looking and tasty.

We made this crostini to accompany greek lemon soup, and the flavor combination was scrumptious. The crostini are also visually appealing.

This appetizer is extremely easy to make if you can find the burrata cheese. I have made it twice and both times received raves and requests for the recipe. Don't skip any ingredients because the mingling of the flavors is what really makes this crostini special.
