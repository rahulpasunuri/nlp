Let me start by saying that "frosting" seems a bit misleading - it's more like a thick glaze. I used just a tad of sea salt in the glaze, which gave it an awesome "sated carmel" flavor,I could have eaten the entire bowl. I made these for a dinner party and pretended that I developed the recipe and was inspired by a Starbucks salted caramel latte. The cake was a bit dry. I thought I had just overcooked them, but judging everyone elses reviews, this may just be the recipe. I'm making these again today, but adding some cinnamon to the cake.

I made this as the recipe states, but did add 3 oz of softened cream cheese. I also used a ghirardelli cake recipe.

I loved the frosting (though I added an extra couple of tablespoons of unsalted butter to tone down the sugariness). The cupcakes were ok. More like a dense muffin. Adding pumpkin to it would be a good idea as someone else mentioned. I'd still like to try to make it more butter pecan tasting. Not sure how to fix them.

Frosting was excellent consistency but sweet. I tried adding 3 oz cream cheese, but that thinned it out too much. I will try adding a half cup of butter next time. I think that would be better. After reading the reviews, don't plan to try the cake but will definitely use the frosting on another cake. A Michigan cook

I'm not rating this recipe since I used a different frosting with the cupcakes than it called for. If I was rating it for just the cupcake I would only give it one fork--it had a very coarse crumb and not enough flavor.

I live in Argentina where anything with "caramel" gets turned into dulce de leche. In order to solve the dryness problem mentioned by the other readers, I also added 1/3 dulce de leche to the cupcake batter. For the frosting, I cut the sugar, water, and cream solution and used 1 1/4 cup dulce de leche instead (after all, dulce de leche is sweetened condensed milk that has been cooked for longer). Similarly, the egg yolks are optional for the frosting. You can still get a fluffy texture without them and it helps to dry it out a bit.

I made this exactly as written. I baked the cupcakes only 20 minutes, as they were done then. They were dry and the texture was very open. Taste was very bland. The caramel for the frosting was delicious, but the frosting was not very good at all. Much too loose and very sugary. Whoever said to use the frosting as a dip is on to something. It's way to runny for frosting.

The frosting deserves 4 forks but the cake only two. I thought not only was it dry but also did not have much flavor. Some suggested to use the frosting as a dip for apples.

I made this recipe almost exactly how it is written, altering only the flour. I used half spelt flour in place of the white flour. the second batch I made a tripled, and this worked well. The amount of frosting for the original batch was enough for all 4 dozen, maybe I was light on frosting all of them. I found that the frosting was better the next day, seemed to need to sit to firm up before frosting. I will make these cupcakes for almost any place I need to take dessert through the holiday season. They have been a big hit for grown up and kids.

I decided to use this recipe for a party but make it more Fall inspired. I added one can of pureed pumpkin and one teaspoon each of cinnamon and nutmeg and half a teaspoon of allspice (or 3 tspn of pumpkin pie seasoning). I left out the peacans, since there were some people with nut allergies. They were a big hit! Very moist, and the hint of pumpkin with spices were delicious with the caramel frosting.

Being an avid baker and loving anything caramel/pecan, I found the cupcakes a bit dry. Also, the frosting was too sweet and had lack of consistency..so I blended in some cream cheese to firm up and lower sweetness. All who ate them insisted it was the best frosting they had ever tasted. I will make them again though will moisten more with liquids.
