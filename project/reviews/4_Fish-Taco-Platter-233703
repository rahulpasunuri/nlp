I made the pickled onions and baja cream to go with shrimp tacos. Umm, the pickled onions made the dish! Baja cream was fantastic. Absolutely amazing. I also made the buttermilk mixture to fry the shrimp. Didn't have buttermilk so I combined milk and lemon juice and let it sit for 5 minutes. The flavor of the shrimp was really really good after I let it marinade (I did it for 3 hours). I'm making the onions and the baja cream again today. Excellent!

This is the first time I've ever eaten fish tacos and I was very pleased. Used striped bass and ate most of them right out of the fryer before they made it to the tacos, they were sooo good! The breading is perfect and crunchy. The pickled onions are a wonderful contrast to the rest of the condiments, don't skip them.

This is fantastic. I have to admit though, because I tried it on a weeknight, I subbed in Costco's tortilla-crutsted Tilapia for the entire fish portion of the recipe. Of course it saved time, but it was also delicious! I will make it again and try the entire recipe out.

Really good. I marinated the fish for an hour in some spices and oil, but made all the side dishes. Baja cream was so good...simple and tasty. Onions were strong, and didn't get eaten much, but I thought they were tasty.

The tomatillo salsa recipe is amazing. Great combination of flavors, beautiful presentation! Not the simplest recipe, but well worth it.

WOWEEE! These fish tacos tasted amazing. I made the pickled onions, baja cream and tomatillo salsa the day before Taco Night. It did seem like a lot of work at the time, but it was worth it. I cut up the jalapenos because I enjoy them in my tacos. On the second day, after the flavors have really had a chance to gel, everything came together wonderfully on the tacos. The baja cream is so simple, yet to die for. The pickled onions added a lot to the dish. The tomatillo salsa was my least favorite, but it was still really, really good. In a dish with so many standouts, something had to give! I made my own self rising flour for the fish by adding 1.25 tsp salt and .5 tsp baking soda.

I found this recipe when trying to recreate the pickled onions and creamy sauce on some fabulous shrimp tacos we had in a little taqueria in Cozumel. This is it - just what I was craving! I have made the recipe with both fish and shrimp (use the same batter and cooking process) and we are *almost* as happy as we'd be on vacation in Cozumel!

Love it! I've made this several times and this has become the #1 Fish Taco in the house. Always make the Red Onion and Jalapenos and Baja Cream from scratch. However, I ran out of time and used jarred Salsa Verde, store bought "fresh" red salsa, and jarred Guacamole. No one knew the difference!! YUM!!

Rating: 4
The past reviews are pretty much spot on: 1) this recipe is really yummy but don't skimp or skip anything. Individual parts of the recipe will seem ordinary. It really is how it all comes together in one bite. 2) it does take time to make. (Making the tomatillo salsa was what took the longest for me due to the charring step). So make the pickled onions one night; the tomatillo salsa the next; and then the baja cream. Remember also that you need 1-3 hours for the fish to marinate in the buttermilk mixture. Yes, I'd make it again but next time I'll have people over :-)

This is my favorite recipe on epicurious, hands down. Out of town guests request it every visit, and it never fails to impress newcomers. Don't skip the onions!

When my husband and I went to Hawaii, we had the best fish tacos ever. We continued our search around the continent to see if we could match that experience, only to be sadly disappointed. So, when I found this recipe and tried it, I was ecstatic, as were all my guests!!! It was a bit time consuming, but after several attempts of making it repeatedly, I decided to leave out the tomatillo salsa and just replace it with red tomatoes. That quickened the process and "Viola", it was just as good as without! I always add more lime to give it that special kick, and I no longer batter the fish, but just fry it. Those changes with the same result sealed the deal for me with fantastic results. We have friends begging us to make them again and again. Kudos to the creator of this recipe.

I personally didn't think this was all that great. I made everything from scratch, including the guacamole (the best part, in my estimation.) The fish would be better if it had just been sauteed or steamed instead of fried. The lime cream was average and the tomatillo salsa, while good, wasn't anything to get too rapturous about.

This recipe was laborious. The blender, the chopping, grating, squeezing, frying, etc. very time consuming, clean up went on all day. However, the end result was very good.

This is not an easy or quick recipe, but it is soooo worth it. (I suggest making the toppings the day before.) Make all of the suggested toppings--and make extra so you can use them on everything you eat that week. I especially love the pickled onions, which just get better with time.

The pickled onions and salsa verde by themselves are keepers. I have to confess, I used a different fish (marintated, rather than fried), from a May 2009 fish taco recipe. Also used the leftover baja cream (Mexican crema works great with this too!), onions, and salsa verde to use with tacos al carbon the next night. Also delicious! The salsa verde is the best I have had, and I've made lots of different versions. The green onions really add nice texture to it. Definitely a keeper - in fact, I'm off to make pickled onions and salsa verde now!

Every element of this meal is delicious! I've made it two weekends in a row for 2 sets of friends and they all loved it. I used tilapia which worked perfectly. My recommendation would be to slice the jalepenos and pickle them seperately from the onions so you can add heat to your tacos as you wish. I had no idea how to seed tomatillos so I didn't and the salsa was great, although it was very hot(I used a large jalepeno). I might use a smaller one next time. Baja cream was delicious. Fish was outstanding. The pickled onions and jalepenos are a must. I made everything the night before so all I had to do was fry the fish when my guests were over- pretty easy.

This is my husband's new favorite meal! I agree with so many of the other suggestions so I only have a few to add. To keep the fat down in the baja cream I use equal parts mayo, low fat sour cream and plain, nonfat yogurt. You can't taste a difference. I use coconut milk instead of buttermilk in the fish marinade as it adds a delicious tropical element to the tacos. Finally, I serve chopped cabbage and romaine lettuce for crunch and lightness as otherwise the tacos can be mushy. Oh, and I generally use mahi mahi because it's available so I think just about any mild fish could work.

Amazing recipe! Marinated tilapia for several hours. Diced the jalepeno before adding to onions. Tomatillo salsa was easy to make and delicious. In fact, the whole receipe takes less time than you would expect, especially if you do it in stages.

This is a great recipe with several steps but easy to substitute with ingredients you have on hand. I had frozen whiting fillets, which I thought would spell disaster because the meat could be so delicate and may fall apart while frying. It worked very well though if you don't flip the fillets around too much! One flip is enough. I substituted apple cider vinegar for the rice vinegar in the pickled onions, then added a bay leaf, peppercorns and italian seasonings then poured through strainer afterwards (didn't want any broken fillings or gagging with stray peppercorns!) Also, instead of adding jalapeños to the onions, I added a teaspoon of finely diced scotch bonnet (habanero) pepper, which probably equaled the heat of the 5 jalapeños!! Thought Baja Cream was too thick so added buttermilk. Also, didn't want to overdo it on the tanginess so didn't add lime to cream as salsa and onions would be tangy so added flavor like cayenne, paprika, powdered chipotle, white pepper and tarragon and salt to cream - was delicious!! Kept the tomatillo salsa as is - great basic recipe by the way. Didn't have time to marinate the fish, but did have buttermilk so made a basic batter by combining 1 cup of buttermilk and one egg, more spices, hot sauce (no cilantro or lemon - i heard these create nasty burnt bits in the oil?) I dipped fillets in batter, dredged them in a combination of flour, bread crumbs, salt and pepper, and fried in vegetable oil. I served these fish tacos with small flour tortillas, which I find much tastier than corn when serving fish. I also wish I had finely chopped cabbage or romaine to serve with these tacos and some sliced radishes. I think that would make the recipe even better!!

Everybody went back for seconds for this when I made it for a party. I paired it with the mango-corn-jicama salad found on this website. Here are my suggestions: 1) Make salsas the day before so the flavors can blend 2) omit the salt in the fish breading. The self rising flour has enough sodium and the fish can be salted immediately after it leaves the fryer if it needs more. 3) The SEASONED rice vinegar added a lot of the flavor to the pickle. Do not subsititute, but one 12 oz bottle is enough. As the pickle forms, it extracts liquid from the onions and peppers. 4) Flour tortillas are always preferred to corn for ease of prep and holding a taco together. 5) But since you have a hot fryer, make your own tortilla chips with the corn tortillas to munch on beforehand. 6) The mango-corn- jicama salad recipe can easily be and should be reduced. The recipe as is serves more 12 servings.

we've been searching for the best fish tacos since the ones we sampled in cozumel. this recipe was a great base (of course I can't stick to the written notes). instead of frying the fish, we grilled. I made my own quick marinade of lime juice, cilantro, a pinch of salt and mexican hot sauce. I also pumped up the baja cream sauce with the same mexican hot sauce (valentina), cumin, chile-salt seasoning and garlic. I also thinned it out with a bit of milk to make it easier to drizzle. Also, on the tomatillo salsa, instead of using jalapenos as they were already in the pickled topping, I used roasted green chiles and added a pinch of mexican oregano. the end result was super- delicious and healthy and we will for sure be making it again!!

To make self-rising flour - add 3 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp salt to 2 cups all-purpose flour. I made this recipe with Chilean sea bass. Was sooo good! 1.75 lbs of fish was just the right amount for 4 people. My guests could not stop raving about how good it was. I will definitely make this again and again. I like the fact that everything can be done ahead. I marinated the fish for 3 hrs and then dredged in flour and set on a cookie sheet in the fridge before guests arrived so all I had to do when it came time to eat was to drop into the Fry Daddy. Served Tortilla Soup with Lime as an appetizer and key lime pie for dessert. Magnificent!!

My family loves these! Whenever people visit I try to make a batch. "Cook from San Fran"....Yes I cut the fresh jalapenos and let them pickle with the onions...gives it a bit of of heat. This way people who like only a little spice can use the onions and the rest of us can take all the jalapenos. Delicious!

Has anyone noticed that this is one of the best reviewed recipes on here? Rightly so! My sister and husband couldn't decided what their favorite part was - the salsa verde and Baja Cream were big hits. Also, being that this was the first time we braved deep frying we were very pleased with the results (moist, tender fish that disappeared off the platter!) Fantastic flavors and a great way to bring a little bit of the summer beach side fare to winter!

I never like when a reviewer changed the entire recipe but we did that simply because of the extreme weather conditions in the midwest we worked with what we had. We made the pickled onion, the baja cream (YUM!). we skipped the salsa because we didn't have the ingrediants amd used taco sauce instead. We made this with shrimp and I must say my husband and I loved it. It was different and spicy. Thats why I lov epicurious because sometimes it just gives you a place to start with what you have.

Loved these! I made the onions and baja cream, and purchased the excellent Frontera Grill brand tomatillo salsa. I had recently had fish tacos at La Palapa Mexican restaurant in NYC, and they were served with chipotle cream, so I copied those by making a chipotle cream with 1/2 c. mayo, 1/2 c. sour cream, a minced chipotle, and adobo sauce from a can of chipotles to taste. My family preferred the chipotle cream to the Baja cream. We also preferred flour tortillas to corn. The fried fish and pickled onions were incredible. I will make these again. Very festive for a party!

Besides the baja cream, guac and salsa, I was concerned there wouldn't be enough "stuff" to put in. . .I was wrong! Seriously, the fish and pickled onion/jalapeno was PACKED with enough flavor, that you didn't need anything else. (Yeah, but I didn't learn this fact until after I diced up cherry tomatoes, sliced avocados, shredded lettuce and crumbled up Mexican Queso Fresco. Oh well.) Nonetheless, it was fun having all that other stuff there, even though it wasn't necessary. Everyone ate more than their stomachs should have allowed. (FYI: took others advise not to make baja cream, so I made a chilpote-cilantro-sour cream thing instead.)

Really, really excellent! Onions and jalepeno are not only delicious but add great color to the whole presentation. Like others, I would skip the mayo in the Baja cream next time and we used low fat sour cream. I also cheated and used store bought salsa verde. We cut the oil to a couple of tablespoons to pan fry the fish which worked just fine. We also added a dash of chili powder and a dash of cumin to the fish marinade. Substituted flax, oatbran, whole wheat tortillas for the flour ones and also offered guests corn hardshells. We used sea bass which was great, but I would try whatever fish is fresh. We will probably have this every Friday during Lent and then can't wait to try it with walleye caught out of the lake this summer.

This was great. I only made the sauce and the meat and actually switched the meat from fish to chicken, since none of the fish selections at my market looked particularily fresh. I also had no buttermilk, so I used oil in the marinade instead. It still turned out great.

I've made this 3 times - the first 2 times only 3 days apart! Our local grocery has weekly "fresh catch" specials and they had wonderful halibut! I made pico de gallo instead of the tomatillo salsa. I used way less oil (a few tablespoons in a large skillet) and the fish was crispy & not greasy. To serve, I put chopped lettuce, chopped avocado, pico de gallo on a flour tortilla - topped with fish, crema and salsa - rolled them up -FABULOUS!! We try to eat fish every Wednesday (the day for new fresh catch) and I often resist - but I'm always up for the fish tacos!

We really enjoyed this. I used red snapper. The pickled onions and peppers are great. Based on other reviews, I skipped the mayo in the Baja cream and used low fat sour cream. It was very good. The only change I would make next time is to roast all the tomatillas rather than put half in the oven. I will be making this again.

Delicious! the fish was amazing - had some fresh halibut - folks were just eating it off the platter as it came out of the oil. Made fresh corn tortillas. Also omitted the mayo from the cream, as others have noted. Onions were great - I misread the directions and just added 1 sliced jalapeno instead of the whole ones. The spicy fans loved the pickled pepper.

Wow, what a perfect fish taco recipe! I do have to say that I followed timmylulu's advice on the Baja Sauce. I only added a squirt of mayo and added a little more lime juice. It made the Baja Sauce the talk of my party! Also, I used less vegetable oil, about 1/2 inch deep, to fry the fish in. We had chips and salsa on the side & I MUST recommend the drink I had: HERBALTINI found at http://food.sunset.com/sunset/recipefinder.dyn?action=displayRecipe&recipe_id=1119564. Happy Cooking!

I have made this dish three times, once of the times was New Years Eve. Everyone loved it. I have sent the recipe to everyone who had it. The onions with Jalepenos go really well with other dishes as well. I served them with black beans on the side once, but in general I found I didn't need much.

My five year old son, hubby, and myself loved this meal. We are already planning on making it again. Any ideas on accompanying side-dishes?

I made this 2 weeks ago and it was so good! My hubby and I loved it and I am making tonight. I loved the tomatillo salsa and pickled onions, but didn't like the baja cream, it tasted too much like mayo. In the future I will just mix sour cream with a little lime to flavor it. Tonight I am trying it with tuna steaks b/c the mahi mahi didn't look that great at the store and I will try baking it instead of frying in oil. I hope it doesn't lose too much of the flavor, I will report back tomorrow! I highly rec. this dish.
