USed 6TB brown sugar and 1TB red curry. Baked on rack over sheet pan in oven at 400. Covered on one side, baked five mins, flipped covered and repeated. Good but not super crispy, so I sautéed in the pan after cooling and crumbling. Served in a salad of baby romaine and seared scallops. Delicious. Would be great with lardons.

I too made this using the oven method and brown sugar. It was very easy and delicious. Served it with the mushroom and 3 cheese strata (also from this site) for Christmas brunch and they were a hit.

Thanks to the last reviewer for posting the oven method... it worked beautifully. I used the same baking times/temp, but used disposable aluminum cookie sheets (w/o racks) for easy clean-up. Draining on brown paper is a must. Also, I used turbinado sugar instead of demerara and it was great. The more sugar you use, the crispier the bacon tends to get, so don't be shy! I made some to sprinkle over salted caramel ice cream (recipe from this site), but my guests loved it so much that they ate it all at the beginning, and I had to make another batch in the middle brunch!!

I found a easy way to make it. I use the oven at 400 with a rack over a half sheet pan. Lay the bacon across the rack with the sugar on one side and let bake for 5-8 minutes. Then turn the bacon over and add the sugar to the second side and bake for five more minutes or until done. It works great! I have also used brown sugar and have even added fresh cracked black pepper to it. What a taste with the salty and sweet.I use it when making Brunch or for a garnish. We love it at our house!!

I don't want to rate this recipe yet, as I had some issues with getting the heat/carmelization correct. I am chalking it up to this being my first shot at it. I am going to try again. Regardless, it was still pretty good. If you are looking for Demerara sugar, try www.surlatable.com or get it directly from their source at: India Tree Gourmet Spices and Specialties in Seattle.

Simple and amazing. Do not discount this recipe. I served it cut in half as a finger food appetizer and it was a hug hit.

YUM. Got it in one try, and the results were as delicious as they sound...and unexpectedly pretty, too. Trying them on caramel ice cream sounds unbelievably good (maybe I'll surprise some people this holiday season!), but I'm using mine on salads. So good.

While working in restaurants, we did this with bacon trimmings all the time! We called them *Scooby Snacks* and, wow, they are good on just about anything. We even used them crumbled on salads for specials. People went gaga over them. Never used the demerara sugar, just used regular old light brown, and they rocked.

You put it on the caramel ice cream given with it in the magazine.

What do I do with the candied bacon?
