I love this. Gets better with age, so it's a great party dish since it can be made ahead of time. I cooked the mushrooms as I was making eggs, then used a little of the mushroom mixture for a yummy omelette. The butter yield is bananas. I used MAYBE half of that.

This is the most expensive compound butter ever. The ratio of butter:chanterelles is waaaay off. It tastes like butter with a hint of chanterelle in the background. It's so buttery that eating it like traditional rillettes is not all that pleasant. If I were to do it again I'd cut the butter in half, but I'm more likely to just skip it and just cook the chanterelles and eat them without the additional steps.

this was just ok, not special enough to make again for me though
