This recipe is so simple but so delicious. It totally made my Thanksgiving pumpkin pie. Tonight I'm serving it with pecan pie. I plan on making it for years to come!

This was a great accompaniment to a spice cake I made for a dinner party. Next time I will add another tbsp of the chopped crystallized ginger. I used The Ginger People, Bakers Cut Crystallized Ginger Chips and they were perfect.

I made this to accompany "Pear and Ginger Upside Down Cake" (Bon Appetit 1997) and it was a perfect match. The whipped cream travelled very well to a friend's dinner party and stayed perfect until served about 3 hours later. So simple and so delicious!
