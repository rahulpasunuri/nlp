was very skeptical, but pleasantly surprised! This dish was excellent exactly as written. No changes, no substitutions. Delicious.

Hve made the dish twice. The more you make it, the more flavors you experience.

Phenomenal. Perhaps if folks respected the recipe as written results would be more to their liking. Peanut butter for tahini is another dish altogether. Balsamic for red wine vinegar? When the ingredients are few, substitutions muddle intention. That said, I find the recipe adapts to thoughtful substitutions favorably. I always add a little turmeric (which I add to lots of things for flavor & health). Sometimes Aleppo pepper instead of Szechuan. I've omitted chili oil in a weak attempt to cut calories. Today I made it with ground turkey (see previous reason), and it was divine. Low sodium soy sauce works well.

Made this recipe almost as written, added half of the chile oil thinking people could add more heat if they wanted it. It was delicious

So diappointing! Dan dan noodles are one of my most favorite dishes. I used peanut butter for tahini because the dan dan I'm used to is most definitely a peanut sauce, and cut both the vegetable oil and chili oil in half. I added pickled Thai peppers for more spice. The dish was still super greasy and heavy. Really gross. It looked like sloppy joes on noodles. There is way more meat in this recipe than sauce, which refused to coat the noodles. Too salty and sour (I added another spoonful of sugar, it didn't help). Does anyone have a better recipe for this dish?

4 forks by using some suggestions from other reviewers and just a couple of revisions of my own. Udon comes in 8.8 oz pkg and had a full pound of grd. pork. No chili oil so used Sambal Oelek(same quantity),no red wine vinegar so used 1 Tbsp balsamic and 1 Tbsp. apple cider vinegar. Added 2 minced cloves of garlic along with the ginger and then some julienned carrots and several heads of Pak Coi(sliced to keep in line with size of carrots). Shredded cabbage would work as well. After draining and rinsing the noodles with cold water I added them to the finished pork/veg mixture, tossed to coat and topped with chopped cilantro. Let the 3 diners garnish with the peanuts, scallions, extra soy sauce and srirachi sauce. A great rainy day lunch!! Only complaint was that the sichuan peppercorns were a little crunchy-would grind them next time.

We followed the recipe exactly and thought it was very good. It was not too spicy for us, but we expected it to be quite spicy as is any Dan Dan noodle recipe.

This recipe needs a little help. It was visually one of the most unappealing dishes I've ever made. A big gluey heap of gray/brown. The flavor was pretty good since you can adjust the heat to your taste but it needs a heavy dose of color and texture. I added blanched asparagus but I'd add carrots and maybe cilantro next time as well.

I thought this was disgusting. Way too salty! Dumped it and made something else for my company

This was delicious and fast! The chili oil and sichuan peppercorns really made the dish pop. Sure it was spicy, but you can really tone it down by adding less of either of the two spicy things (chili oil and peppercorns). I substituted turkey meat because I don't eat pork. It was still delicious. I will definitely make it again and again!

Having made my fair share of noodle dishes, I have to say that what I made is not a Dan Dan noodle, because by the time I was through, it was really something quite different. I sautéed garlic with the pork, substituted srirachi sauce for the chili oil, and added a couple of tbs. of creamy peanut butter to the tahini. I omitted the sugar as a result of adding the peanut butter, and substituted the vinegar with lime juice. I added shredded carrot and red pepper to the noodles for a little color and crunch, and added sesame oil for additional flavor. The end result was delicious. served with more lime, cilantro, and srirachi. Everybody asked me to make it again soon.

Both my teenage boys loved this, but everyone agreed, it was too spicy -- and my boys like spicy. They asked for it again, but I am going to try it and reduce the amount of the chili oil and Sichuan peppercorn.

Made it tonight for dinner. Family enjoyed it but thought it was too spicy at 1 T. of Chili oil. We eat plenty of spicy food. 2 T. of Chili oil may be a misprint.
