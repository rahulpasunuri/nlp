I couldn't find the guava shells in syrup so I made the chicken skewers w/o the sauce. This chicken was easy to prepare, juicy, and very flavorful. I only gave the recipe 3 forks because I did not make the sauce, although I imagine it would only enhance the dish :)

I have made this four times and each time it gets rave reviews. I can't often find guava shells, so I sub apricots or something similar.
