The dough got thicker as I went along. I did not have a pastry bag so I substituted a plastic zip-lok bag with the tip cut off. The Bra Tenero cheese was not available, nor were truffles, so on the suggestion of the cheesemonger I used Sottocenere. It is heavenly with slivers of black truffle in the cheese itself. MMMM

Just made these and thought they tasted good. However, I had to add some flour since they were too liquidy when I put them in the water to boil. They puffed up nicely in the oven.

I make this dish often with what ever cheese is available. Gorgonzola, imported fontina, etc. Everyone loves it, it's not difficult. Just make sure to do the final baking thoroughly, otherwise they are heavy.

Make sure you get the Bra Tenero cheese. It is worth the effort to find it. While my gnocchi weren't an artistic success, the flavor was wonderful. Not really hard to make, but trying to pipe them into the water was a challenge.
