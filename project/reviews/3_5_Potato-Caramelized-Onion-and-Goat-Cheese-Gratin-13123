This was really good, and I love the flavor of caramelized onions with the goat cheese. I added a sweet potato, just because I had one on hand and that added a nice color and flavor. I also, as other reviewers recommended, used cream instead of milk, yum!

This has been one of my favorite potato gratins for years, however I do make a few changes. I increase the milk to 1 1/2 cups and make part of it cream. That seems to solve the dryness problem mentioned by other reviewers. I also use fontina or gruyere instead of the goat cheese and dust the top with freshly grated parmesan before baking. People always ask for the recipe.

Use a strong vegetable stock with some double cream instead of the milk and a very strong goats cheese, it needs to be very very smelly or it lacks the kick it needs!

not a huge fan of this one. needs more of a sauce rather than milk which just sits in the bottom of the pan. wouldn't make it again without altering significantly.

I also would cook the potatoes much less; they didn't really staty in nice slices, and by the end I was tossing crumbled and sort of mushed potatoes into a layer. I found that the goat cheese sort of loses its sharpness and punch, and it also doesn't spread at all. I love this dish, or maybe the idea of this dish, and am continuing to look for a better cheese.

This has become a regular feature in our house, and great to bring to family get-togethers. Delicious with all kinds of roasted meats. I use fat-free half and half sometimes to cut the fat, which works well. Definitely use the Yukon Golds. It's even good cold!

The version I made tasted really good but was a little dry. I followed the directions but used fresh rosemary (1-2T) along with a little thyme, cut down on the onions as recommended by others, used feta cheese, and added a little bit of cream to the milk. I can definitely recommend the feta and rosemary. I will probably add a little more milk/cream next time.

I too added more goat cheese & some freshly grated asiago, also more thyme. We love onions, so the amount was perfect!

Just made this dish. Although it was good, the goat cheese was really too bland; needed another sharper cheese maybe. The carmelized onions helped add a little flavor but overall would not make again since there are so many more favorful au gratin recipes to try.

Boil potatoes less (they were too mushy). Could use less onions. LOTS more goat cheese. Lots of FRESH thyme.

This was a good recipe. I think I would probably make it again if it seemed to suit the occasion. The taste of the caramelized onions was wonderful. My only concern was the goat cheese. I *love* goat cheese, so this recipe sounded great to me, but in practice, I think a sharper cheese would work better. Next time, I intend to try gruyere instead of chevre. Still, a great recipe to try!

I wasn't crazy about this recipe. It was really onion gratin with a few potatoes rather than the other way around. If you make it definately increase the goat cheese. I guess unconsciously I was really looking for a more traditional potatoes au gratin & once I tasted this realized that this ain't it. Check your expectations - this recipe is non-traditional.

wonderful--served it as a christmas eve side. Almost doubled the goat cheese and was very generous with salt and pepper. didn't have fresh thyme, so substituted savory. Also added a healthy dash of nutmeg which really brought out the flavors.

This dish was very bland. I served it as a main course. It would have been better with less onions and more seasonings.

This was delicious. The only thing different I would do next time is make sure i crumble the goat cheese very fine. Big lumps were a bit overowering.

Fantabulous! Doubled the amount of goat cheese and didn't bother to boil the potatos before hand. Hands down a side dish winner!

Don't cheat yourself with anything other than Yukon Gold Potatoes. Used a mandolin to slice. Did not par boil these first. Added 1 Tablespoon Parmesan Cheese to the goat cheese layer. Cooked for 35 minutes. A fabulous recipe. Had them cryin' for more.

I made this dish to serve with a pot roast. I found it to be visually unappealing and bland. I would not make it again without major revisions.

My guests and I loved this dish!! I've made it several times since I first tried the recipe back in December. I definitely recommend at tripling the amount of cheese called for, and skipping the part about cooking the potatoes in advance. I put everything uncooked in the casserole dish, and 45 minutes later ... VOILA!! The altered recipe is easily worth 4 forsk!

I found the end result too sweet and it wasn't a big hit at my house

Excellent recipe and good to make ahead as well. I used more goat cheese for a slightly richer result. My kids even ate those onions- the caramelizing made a big difference!

Excellent recipe! I have made ths many times and it is suitable for many occasions. Everyone loves it - esp. vegetarians. I double the amount of goat cheese and use much more fresh thyme (approx. 3 tablespoons). I also don't bother peeling the potatoes - it tastes great anyway.

I really liked this recipe as an alternative to my standard potato au gratin recipe with onions and gruyere cheese. For this recipe, I used yukon gold potatoes, and I think they worked well. I cooked the onions down for probably twenty minutes, adding a little buter and a touch of sugar to facilitate browning. I then made the casserole with two/three layers(starting and ending with potatoes), substituted herbs de provence for the thyme, salted and peppered each layer well, and probably used double the amount of cheese called for including some on top. I agree with previous reviewer that par boiling the potatoes is not necessary. I just cooked the casserole a little longer in the oven covered in aluminum foil, and finished uncovered under the broiler. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.

This recipe has the potential to be really great with a few alterations. The onions were overpowering.

Oh my goodness! I made this with the Roasted Pork with Rosemary and Garlic and what a compliment to each other. The onions and goat cheese were great together. I skipped the boiling of the potatoes, just slicing them horizontally, layering then cook. They came out perfectly!

Very good. I used more goat cheese and thyme too, and boiled potatoes less and cooked them i oven more, so they browned better

Awesome! My husband and I love goat's cheese so I added 3 times more and it was to die for! A really nice change from the basic potato.

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious! Both simple and unusual. I would not change a thing about the recipe. It does take a bit of time, but nothing to difficult. I even made a double recipe and managed just fine. Also, I baked them ahead of time and warmed them up for dinner which definitely works.

I used fontina cheese and fat-free milk, and did not peel the potatoes, and it was, nevertheless, wonderful! I heartily recommend this dish.

I received rave reviews on this recipe. To cut down on fat, I skipped the butter and used nonfat milk. I also squeezed one full head of roasted garlic into the onions(once caramelized) and I substituted sage for thyme, although both work well. Served with pork chops on a rainy night.

I am so happy to find this receipe again, I thought I lost it, and wanted to make it for the holidays. It is such a wonderful dish!

I LOVE this recipe and make it all the time. I am always asked for the recipe when I bring it somewhere. I change it a little by using parmesan cheese instead of the goat cheese. And I agree with the other reviewer who recommends not holding back on the salt.

Rating: 3
Yum! Potatoes made pleasantly different. Don't hold back on the salt, though, and keep in mind that this dish takes some time.

Very good served with grilled steak. I broke the work down into little bits by carmelizing the onion and cooking the potatoes earlier in the day. When it came time to assemble later on it came together in a snap.

This was a very good dish. It took some time to prepare and dirtied lots of dishes but it was worth it!
