MANY things wrong w/ this recipe: - Strudel should be rolled LENGTHWISE, as you would do w/ apple strudel - Follow the instructions on the phyllo dough before beginning, as the dough needs to defrost for 2 hours; you CANNOT use it frozen!. - DON'T use a damp tea towel, use a dry one (as w/ apple strudel) - Way too much butter - can use 2-3 tbls. to sautee, along w/ oil. - I used neufchatel, lower fat than cream cheese.

When Gael Greene allowed this recipe to be reprinted in a magazine (can't recall which one) some 40 years ago, it had an additional ingredient: 2 lbs. sweet Italian sausage. The "mince mushrooms" instruction was preceded by "Remove sausage meat from casings and bake at 350 degrees until no longer pink, then crumble into small pieces."

I made only one strudel used shitake and portabella's and leeks (about a cup and a half). i used much less butter for sauteing the shrooms and mixed them with 4 oz of cream cheese only and about 1/4 cup of fresh grated parm. other than that followed the recipe exactly (he he he). It was delicious and plenty rich.

I have made this dish for three potlucks over the last year -- a hit every time, everyone asks for the recipe. I do halve the cream cheese (I use reduced fat cream cheese), and I also reduce the butter by about a third. I also use five sheets of fillo rather than four. I had no prior experience with fillo the first time I made this, and yet every time it has come out perfectly, including that first time. I do use the towel trick to get the roll started ... it helps to avoid tearing ... after that first bend, you can just use your fingers to complete the roll. You really do need to press the water out of the mushrooms, and then cook the mushrooms long enough to see more water come out and then evaporate entirely. Yes, it is not super gourmet, but it is delicious, and just fun party food.

Total failure - the filling did not anywhere near that much cream cheese and it needs more sheets of phyllo to work.

I made this for an Easter side. I used 5 sheets of Phyllo for each roll, and used only 4oz of cream cheese. It was a hugh hit, easy to make, and really tasty. I will be making it again.

This is definitely a crowd pleaser. The filo part is time consuming and sometimes it is hard to cut them pretty so I started buying the filo cups and filling them. The recipe also makes so much. I save half of the mixture in the freezer and keep the filo cups on hand. You can have an appetizer ready to take somewhere is about 15 minutes.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit.People were hoarding their pieces and literally fighting over who got more. I made exactly to the recipe except I did not bother with the "squeezing them dry in a towel" step. I used half button mushrooms and half a mix of baby bellas and fresh shiitake mushrooms. When I first tested the recipe, I formed the strudel per the instructions and found it not very attractive. Maybe I don't know what a strudel is supposed to look like, but it just looked like a big mushroom loaf to me. So when I made this for our event, I spread a thinner layer of filling on the phyllo, then rolled it from the long side, then sliced into 1.5 inch pieces before baking (you end up with 4 smaller strudels instead of 2 huge ones - need twice as many phyllo sheets). That made little pieces that were pretty to look at (could see the spirals inside) and easy to eat. Sprinkle breadcrumbs sparingly - if you use too many it will make your phyllo layers separate too much. Also, don't use the damp towel underneath the phyllo you're working with (only for the stack that's waiting to be used) because when I did that the first time, it made the first sheet of phyllo completely disintegrate by the time I was ready to roll, and stick to the towel. A big mess. The second time, I just sprayed nonstick on my cooking sheet and assembled the strudels right on it - worked like a charm. Thanks! A keeper!

Very tasty and easy to make. I used a mix of baby bellas and shitakes, and added some freshly ground coriander

My guests went nuts over this. Not incredibly gourmet but a definite crowd pleaser. I don't know if the breadcrumbs are necessary. I will probably do more layers of filo next time b/c the flaky crust was a little thin. The recipe doesn't really specify thawing the filo pastry before putting together, I should have thought of that but was in a hurry.
