Such glowing reviews for this recipe, but I guess I just didn't "get" it. I'm not used to the idea of rosemary and sage being Latin American ingredients (as the cuisine column indicates), so maybe I was overly hung- up on that. I really didn't care for the sage in the rub, or in the salsa verde. I did like the addition of celery leaves though. After tasting the verde, I threw in 1/4 of a chopped onion and preferred it that way. I can't comment on the cooking time because I used a much smaller piece of pork and roasted accordingly.

Delicious. I ended up cooking it a bit slower because guests were delayed. Juicy, savory, easy. Party of 10 loved it. Served with black beans/rice and jicama salad.

The rub is delicious but cooking this roast in the oven leaves it way too fatty. Try it on the bbq, way mo' bettah!

The pork was delicious, but the Salsa Verde was not at all to my liking. I do not like anchovies, so I only used one, but even my husband who likes them was not impressed. Unfortunately, we all had bellyaches and heartburn the next day from this fatty cut of pork that I had trimmed as best I could. Too much trouble and too hard to digest.

Absolutely fabulous! I took the recommendations of those before me. Cooking time for 8 lbs was 5 hours and I took it out at 160 degrees (perfect). I added brown sugar to the rub...again, perfect. I added sweet onion to the salsa and doubled it. Hubby and I look forward to the leftovers! It was amazing and I will be making this for company next time.

Combined this, Mark Bittman, and Joy of Cooking for the same recipe: used peanut oil instead of olive, added dried oregano and red wine vinegar to the rub. Applied the spice rub in advance and refrigerated, uncovered, for a day. Very delicious. Served with clementine and jicama salad on this site.

I agree with many folks about the cooking time. I cut down the time also...so please watch your temp. I also took the pork out at 180 degrees - which was not soon enough in my opinion. I also added a bit of chopped Maui Sweet onions to the Salsa Verde for a milder taste.

Like everyone else, we loved the salsa verde. It's perfect for a pork roast, but could be used on many other meats as well. Our heritage breed, pasture raised pork tasted fantastic, but next time I'll take it out of the oven a bit earlier. It was borderline dry.

In answer to an earlier question, the pork shoulder is exactly the same cut as a Boston butt and is rectangular in shape. I have no idea why there are two names for the same cut. A pork picnic, while similar to Boston butt or shoulder, is cone-shaped with more sinew as it comes from just below the shoulder blade. I have found that this recipe works better with the Boston butt since the cooking temp doesn't melt enough of the gelatin present in the picnic. Great recipe, though. The only thing I add is a bit of brown sugar to the outer rub for an unbelievable mouthfeel.

OK...............but, as a Cuban, this is not the cut you need.............try regular pork shoulder, not butt

I've made this twice now and will make again for a dinner party of 10 people next week. It is fantastic. So far, even the picky eaters have loved this. The salsa is perfect and we have more than doubled the amount of it each time, since it's so good and it all gets used. No salsa leftovers. Soft taco leftovers are delicious. If you follow this recipe, you'll have a great meal.

I have made this twice; everyone loved it! I used bone-in shoulder blade roast both times. Previous reviews have warned that the meat cooks more quickly than indicated in the recipe. It is very true! After the 450-degree searing, I cooked at 275. Also, be careful how long you let the roast rest. It will continue to cook. I pulled the roast out of the oven earlier than I'd calculated and wasn't ready to serve the meal after the 15 minute rest. It was about 40 minutes before I had it on the table. It was still delicious and moist but I thought meat was a bit well done. The salsa verde is absolutely excellent.

I had a 4 lb roast and used appx the same amount of rub although I ADDED more garlic. I put the roast into an enameled cast iron pot -- sitting on a grate -- with the lid on. We put it in around 1 pm and before running out for an errand around 4 pm I thought to check the roast. It was DONE! I couldn't believe the roast had cooked so quickly. Not sure if it was the pan - keeping the heat in or the smallish roast -- but I'm adding this info for anyone else working under the same conditions... Dinner included roasted veggies (parsnips / carrots / butternut squash) with butter, sage and garlic and mashed potatoes with fresh parsley. All in all it was a great dinner - just wish I'd planned better as I had trouble keeping the roast warm without continuing to cook! We'll definitely have this again - but won't plan for such a long roasting time!

I made this for dinner last night and the pork butt was absolutely fantastic! After roasting for 6 1/2 hours, the pork is literally falling off the bone and melts in your mouth. The salsa verde was a perfect accompaniment to the richly flavored meat. Definitely try this recipe; you won't be sorry!

I've made this a few times now for company - it's really an excellent recipe. I just used a picnic cut (this recipe calls for heritage pork) - even though the temperature was very low, I reduced the over to 275 it cooked a bit faster than the recipe. The salsa verde is excellent.

Fantastic! Followed as written. Smells great all day. Doubled the Salsa Verde and used over pasta the next night. Good stuff...

This was absolutely fabulous. I followed the recipe as it was printed. I will be serving sandwiches with the leftovers and using the salsa over the top of the meat. Yum!

This was a simple yet delicious recipe. I marinated the shoulder over night with the rub. Salsa Verde was very delicious as well...

This recipe was amazing. The meat was tender and incredibly flavourful. I couldn't stop eating it.

Made this for friends and it was unbelievable. Followed the recipe pretty closely for both the pork and the salsa. I probably used more garlic in the rub because we love it so much. Raves from our guests and my husband. The pork was tender and juicy. Fantastic. Do not miss out on the salsa verde - it was perfect with the pork - I made double the amount and we almost ran out of it. We look forward to the left-overs.

Oh m'gosh! This was AMAZING!! I want to say right from the get go that I was totally skeptical of cooking the meat to a temperature of 185! I am converted, maybe it works because of how fat the boston butt is. I roasted a four pound cut of meat and it took approximately five hours to reach the proper temp. The salsa verde is a must, it is a great contrast to the richness of the meat. I have added this to my recipe box and this will made again and again. Made this exactly as discribed. My husband is in heaven.

This is really great, but next time I'll reduce the amount of garlic, or use roasted garlic. 6 cloves seems to overpower the other flavors. Also, since I was just cooking for two of us, 8 pound of pork was a little much. We had pork coming out of our pores for days.

honestly this is one of the most complimented dishes I have ever made. It is always a WIN!! It is fail proof....season it with the oil, garlic, herbs and spices....stick it in the oven with an instant read thermometer and go and read the paper.Come back in 6 hours and you have a wonderful succulent tasty dinner. Easy as pie and DELICIOUS!! I used this recipe tonight to make pork tacos and my guests loved it.

Traditionnal ,meaning, one that includes tommatillos & cumin bon apetit

although this is an easy & OK alternative .. i definitely think its worth it to seek out a more traditional salsa verde to accompany pork or any other white meat. a great iddea nonetheless . Tchin Tchin

This is relatively easy to make and a real crowd pleaser. Definitely make double the amount of salsa since it is very popular and goes quickly and also goes well with rice if you serve that alongside. This is delicious!

This was incredible and easy. I used a 4 poind boneless Boston Butt and accidentally used the same amount of rub (esentially doubling it) and will do this again. It was great!

The salsa verde recipe is excellent and works for many different meats. It's especially good with steaks in place of a chimichurri sauce. I usually use sherry vinegar instead of red wine vinegar, throw in a few manzanillo or picholine olives into the processor and stream in the olive oil. I like a creamier consistency and use less oil - maybe around 1/3 cup. The pork shoulder is good if very rich, but the sauce is the real standout in this recipe.

Rating: 4
Followed the recipe to the letter for the sauce and the rub and made BOTH the day in advance. The herbs in the rub discolored a tiny bit, but once the pork went in the oven at 450 that became a non- issue! This makes AT LEAST enough for 8-10 servings. This recipe is an absolute keeper; I'll make it again for Christmas - and as many other events as I can get away with before people start to complain. It's just delicious.

Really good. I ended up taking off the fat once roasted so I wouldn't bother rubbing the marinade into the fat as it is a waste. I would say that the sauce is a must.

This was delicious, and while I loved the salsa verde myself, my guests didn't seem to like it. You really don't need the salsa verde, the roast alone is wonderful.

Amazingly easy and good recipe for 8 or more. My son has a music group that rehearses at our home. The recipe produces a tender and juicy roast. The sauce-don't forget the sauce! adds a more sophisticated touch. Don't stint on the fresh herbs.

Excellent dish. So easy to make. The sauce is a must. Gives it a lemony twist.

To t_curry from Vancouver: although the name is misleading, pork butt is actually cut from the shoulder.

Can anyone comment on the difference between a pork shoulder roast and a pork butt roast?

I will be making this for a dinner party for ten on the 16th of this month. Have not made it before but by reading the recipe I know that it will be perfect. To marianne4; yes. To prox9974; I think that the oil in the salsa would emulsify better if it is poured threadlike, specially at the begining to give the oil molecules time to break up and wrap themselves arround the lemon juice/vinegar molecules. Otherwise the proportion of acid to the oil is perfect.

While I really enjoyed the way the pork was cooked (nice, flavorful crust, tender and juicy inside), I found the salsa too oily and it didn't bring much to the dish. [ and I did cook the pork uncovered, took it out when internal temp was 185 ]

just a question. i want to make tihis.can someone tell me if it's left uncovered??

You HAVE to try this. I just loved that it cooked all day, was tender, different...easy too...delicious left overs....I never make anything twice, this will be an exception!

Wow! This was just superior - I swear, the best roast pork I've ever cooked. I was really concerned about cooking to an internal temperature of 185 - that seemed 30 degrees overdone. I shouldn't have worried. The high temperature initially to sear it, then lowering the temperature & cooking it slowly, worked like a charm. It was exceptionally moist. The only change I made was to debone it - I thought it would make it easier to slice. This is company fare at incredibly cheap prices - pork shoulder was on sale at my supermarket, and I paid under $10 for 8 lbs. This is certainly going into my repetoire.

I added some ground, dried porcini mushrooms to the rub and it was delicious. I added a bunch of curry leaves to the salsa verde and that was an amazing flavor componant-try it!

We loved everything about this: the meat was tender and succulent, the rub delicious, and the salsa verde a flavorful complement. Watch the cooking time, as we ended up taking the roast out of the oven an hour early (when the internal temp was 155), at which time it was done exactly to our liking. One 8.5-lb. roast was enough for 5 adults and 7 teens. Served it with Multi-Grain Salad with Dried Fruit (Bon Appetit, Aug. '96)...YUM!

If you are a slow-cooked meat enthusiast... this recipe is worth a go. Sort of a higher-end rendition of the southern classic of 'pulled pork'... the rub complements the meat perfectly and the salsa verde is a wonderful, tangy addition. Leftovers are great for cold sandwiches!
