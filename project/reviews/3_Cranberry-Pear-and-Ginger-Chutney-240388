The taste was incredibly intense. I made a double batch Thanksgiving and there was none leftover!! I experiment with all new recipes each year, but my guests demanded that I break my rule and serve it again!

I substituted 1 c cider for half the cider vinegar. I also boiled the liquids down to 1 cup and then strained out the solids (saved time grinding and grating) and added the fruit. I used about twice as much fruit as the recipe called for, but the same amount of sugar. It's a great alternative to ordinary cranberry sauce.

This recipe is excellent, and my family has requested it again and again each year since the first time I made it. I didn't find it overly-vinegary at all, but I used a very fine, high-quality cider vinegar, which I'm sure makes a huge difference. It's quite pricey but well worth it, since the vinegar you use will definitely make or break the recipe. Agreed, extremely delicious with other roasted meats and on sandwiches.

Way too much vinegar! We threw it out and had to find a new recipe. Perhaps half vinegar and half cider or aging it a bit (as reviewers suggested) would help. Recipe sounds great, but tastes awful.

This recipe is fabulous with turkey and duck and goose! The pear offers a nice sweetness with the tang of the cranberries.

This is very much like a traditional chutney which should consist of a substantial amount of vinegar. Chutneys should be fiery hot and syrupy sweet. I added some additional pepper and used both fresh and powdered ginger. I also canned the chutney and continue to use it with cheeses, roasted sausages, pork, and other things besides turkey. I would never use it as a traditional cranberry sauce complement to turkey. It is much better with turkey as an appetizer on crostini or something similar.

I was worried by the vinegar smell, but I LOVE ginger and wanted something that was not sweet but more of an adult cranberry sauce. This fit the bill. I loved the ginger; I do agree that the vinegar smell is a bit over powering, so I cooked the chutney longer than recommended to rid it of the smell as much as possible. When I took a bite, to my surprise it was very delicious and everyone loved it. I would recommend this recipe but if you are sensitive to the vinegar smell, you might want to reduce the quantity like other reviewers recommended. I will make this again though.

Served this sauce with Thanksgiving dinner - you know, the usual suspects - turkey, dressing, gravy, spuds - the family loved it! I did, however, only use three tbsp of minced ginger per prior reviews and let the sauce mellow in the refrigerator for three days to soften the bite - truely a great addition to the meal!

This was terrible due to the overbearing vinegar taste. WAY TOO MUCH VINEGAR! I think that the other flavors whould have been fab if not for the ridiculous amount of vinegar.

Good flavor but ginger is very strong. Next time I will reduce by half. Used apples instead of pears- a great substitute.

Do not use 2 cups vinegar! I used 1c. apple cider vinegar and 1c. apple cider and it came out amazing. I will make this again for sure. It takes a while to chop all the ingredients but the recipe is worth the hassle.

too much vinegar

I agree that it had too much vinegar. I'm glad I made is yesterday (a couple days before thanksgiving) so I can try again with less vinegar.

This was a disaster! Way too much vinegar! Had to make a second cranberry sauce last minute to replace this one.

We thought this was great, with just a few changes. Taking advice of previous reviewers, I cut vinegar to 1.5 cups. We also used just a bit less red pepper - but in the end, I think it would have been good with the full amount.

This didn't work for me at all. The house *reeks* of vinegar and the chutney is entirely too spicy. I should have known that 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes would be too much. I tried to salvage it with some apricot jam, fresh oranges, and apple cider, but no good. The heat from the red pepper, ginger, and vinegar completely obscures the other flavors. This one is going in the trash.

Except for the enormous quantities of sugar and cider vinegar, this recipe is almost identical to the much better one from Gourmet 1991,also on this site. For those whose eyes are watering over the prospect of 2 cups vinegar, check that out under "Cranberry and Pear Chutney". It's been our favorite for 16 years.

I made this as written, and it was awesome. The best substitute for holiday cranberry dressing. Awesome on leftover turkey sandwiches. Definitely different, but really good.

Way too much vinegar! I love vinegar, but this was too much. Half the vinegar, at least. Otherwise, good flavor combinations.

AMAZING! I used apples instead of pears, and added fresh figs. The dinner party I fed it to loved it! So did I. I have to say I felt the same way about the 2 cups of vinegar, but it still turned out great. I used all of the 2 cups.

Less than okay. Two cups of apple cider vinegar? Is this a typo? I made the chutney as written and it could not be eaten. Horrible!!!!!

Is there a big mistake in this recipe? I am a fan of all things piquant, but TWO CUPS of apple cider vinegar really pushed me (and my sinuses) over the edge. Perhaps the authors intended to write 'apple cider' instead of 'apple cider vinegar'. I plan to make this again because I really like the flavor combinations, but will probably use 2 tbsp vinegar and 1 1/2 cups apple cider.
