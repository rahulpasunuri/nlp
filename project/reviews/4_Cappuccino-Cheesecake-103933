I've been making this for years, and just did it yesterday with Starbuck's instant coffee, Via, and it was even better than before. My only issue is that I usually have a crack down the middle, I put an extra pan in the oven with water in it. I think this time it just needed a bit more time in the middle to set. But delicious and very popular at dinner.

Excellent cheesecake! Made as written except I used mini chocolate chips (they don't sink) and a very high end Espresso powder. Garnished with chocolate drizzle and curls and it looked stunning, not even a crack. Sold it for $3.50 a slice at a bake sale and made $42.00. It slices like a dream. Had many requests for the recipe! Delicious;-)

Tasty cheesecake - looks nice, easy to cut, yummy. I used chocolate graham crackers for the crust and patted it on after the cheesecake was baked (as in The Cake Bible by Beranbaum). Made these modifications: didn't have enough cream cheese, so I used 24 oz cream cheese and 1 cup sour cream; didn't use the flour (I don't like what it does to the texture - tends to make it cakey, not as creamy); used mini-chips, which stayed dispersed through the cake nicely). Everyone loved it - delicious. I'd like to try it with a sour cream topping with a touch of cinnamon.

I made this recipe exactly as written and it was absolutely delicious. It still cracked horribly, even though I tried doing what one of the previous reviewers suggested. Because the cake was just for the family, it didn't matter, but the next time I make it I would like to try and make it so it didn't crack.

The cheesecake turned out perfect. The crust was a different story. Not having chocolate graham crackers, I substituted crushed oreos. This was a mistake. The crust turned out hard and unedible. I will make again but next time get the graham crackers.

This cheesecake is delicious and a huge hit at any gathering I take it to. I substitute choc grahams for regular.

To the reviewer before me, it's a 1/4 cup sugar for the crust, the remainding sugar is for the cheesecake part. The line space between the ingredients is deceiving. I've made this recipe for years. It's easy, impressive and a crowd pleaser and has just been requested again.

I am thinking of making this for Christmas, but I think there is a mistake in the crust portion of the recipe. It calls for 1 1/2 CUPS sugar in the crust! I'm guessing it's actually 1 1/2 Tablespoons?

Oh my goodness, this cheesecake was fabulous. I followed the recipe exactly. I made it for an office birthday and everybody wanted the recipe. I will try it with chocolate graham crackers next time as suggested by others.

This is one of the best cheesecake recipes. I always get requests to make it. I've used the different varieties of the "Kraft General Foods International Coffees" to vary the flavor of the cake. Eg., sometimes I use cinnamon graham crackers and I use the Cafe Vienna coffee for a cinnamon touch---this went over quite well at my office. I highly recommend this recipe for ease and taste.

Wonderful dessert! Everyone raved and ate every last crumb. I used a chocolate crust and drizzeled, once cooled, with chocolate sauce (semi-sweet chocolate chips melted with a bit of whipping cream) and also with caramel sauce which was a nice twist. I'll definetively be doing this one again. If making it in a place where the weather is very hot, keep a close eye to oven temp. and cooking time, I did have to lower mine to 325F and it was done in around 50 minutes.

Wonderful cheesecake, I brought it to work and got many requests for the recipe, and its now my family's new favorite. A hint to avoid cracks in the top--beat the cream cheese, but when it comes to adding the other ingredients, use the mixer on low speed. The cracks come from whipping too much air into the batter. I tried this with this recipe, and had a perfectly smooth top. It works for other cheesecake recipes as well.

i did things suggested by others including chocolate graham crust and baking with a dish of water but i still ended up with 2-3 huge craters in the middle. how to avoid this? did i do anything wrong? also, are you supposed to use the mixer the entire time? still tasted incredible!

This shall be my new standard cappuccino cheesecake recipe. However, I think the recipe meant TABLESPOONS for the instant coffee/espresso granules rather than teaspoons.

Easy to make, and very importantly, easy to serve. The flour gives the cake a good texture, and hence, it is easy to slice. The chocolate chips provide a flavor boost. I served this cake at an Italian wedding reception.

This was a wonderful cheesecake with just enough coffee flavor. I made this for a wedding shower & got many compliments. I may try the chocolate crust next time. If there are any splits in the top, chocolate shavings & chocolte chips help to hide that problem.

Sorry made an error in previous review.A delicious cake. I made the following modifications. I made a chocolate wafer crust using 1 1/2 cups chocolate wafer crumbs and a half cup of melted butter, NO sugar. I added an extra tsp. of coffee to the filling. I baked it with a pan of hot water in the bottom of the oven to reduce cracking and turned off the oven and let it sit with the door partly open for the last 5 minutes of baking. After it cooled and was refrigerated, I topped it (thinly) with a chocolate coffee ganache made up of 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips, 1 tbsp. instant coffee and 1/3 cup plus 2 Tbsp. WHIPPING CREAM(you'll have extra: make sure to keep the springform intact for clean coverage when topping), then allowed the ganache to set in fridge for about 10 minutes. Decorated it with whipped cream rosettes lighly flavoured with coffee extract, chocolate covered espresso beans, and chocolate curls. It cuts beautifully and looks very professional.

Made this last week for someone's birthday. What a great idea that was! I also used a chocolate graham cracker crust. I can't imagine using a plain graham cracker crust on this cheesecake. Regardless of the steam method I used to bake this cheesecake, and the slow cooling, it still cracked so I prepared a semi-sweet chocolate ganache to pour on top. Worked like a charm! There was not a single crumb left. I might add, this was my first attempt at making a cheesecake.

I love this cheesecake! I have made it several times and get raves from everyone. I use a chocolate wafer crust though. One can never have too much chocolate, no?

A big hit at a neighborhood party - several requests for the recipe. Very easy to make. I did use the chocolate wafers for the crust b/c I thought they'd complement the coffee flavor better, and did use the water bath described below, which I do for all my cheesecakes. Next time will try adding the sour cream frosting from the Bailey's Irish Cream Cheesecake (also a HUGE hit).

I love making cheesecakes, especially when there is company. This one was really easy to make and it was a hit at the last dinner party, although my husband, an admitted cheesecake freak, found it a little too sweet.

This was a delicious combination of two of my favorite things: chocolate and coffee! I did, though, omit the graham crackers and made the crust out of thin chocolate wafer cookies. I also split the chips--half cappuccino and half chocolate chips. I got the cappuccino chips from King Arthur Flour. You'll love this!

My family couldn't stop eating it over the holidays. I made it this year and last. If you love coffee and chocolate ....huge hit. A little hard to cut the pieces, but worth the mess.

AWESOME!! I have made this recipe over and over again for the last year. Everyone asks for the recipe. It is amazing!! I followed suggestion for water in oven which only seems to work if it's almost boiling before you put it in there (microwave it first). I also used instant coffee powder, and have tried small chunks of fine milk chocolate instead of chocolate chips. The best formula I've found for a graham (or chocolate) crust is 1 1/2 Cups of crumbs + 1/2 cup unsalted butter and 1/4 sugar (optional) cause the crumbs are sweet enough, not to mention the cake. I have tried putting circle of parchment on bottom of springform pan and it seems to work with some maneuvering, but could use a better suggestion if anyone has it. Enjoy, it's delicious!

I just made this cheesecake for my office holiday party and won rave reviews. It was my first time making a cheescake so I was a little nervous but it turned out great. I followed a lot of reader's suggestions including: put a dish of water in the oven while it bakes, bake at 425 for the first fifteen minutes and then at 225 for another hour and fifteen minutes or so (read on for the specifics on that one), and use mini choc. chips. I found the recipe to be easy and, most important, WONDERFUL!

I made this cake for dessert for my culinary club. Everbody raved and insisted that this recipe be a keeper. The only change that I made was to use instant coffee instead of espresso, which none of the local markets by me carried.

I made this with an Oreo cookie crust, rather than the one listed and it made this dessert just that much better. I also used 1/4c cold strong brewed coffee and 1/4c whipping cream in the espresso mixture and 2 tsp ground espresso and it was more coffee-ish. Thanks for the suggestion about mini-chocolate chips -- they are perfect in this recipe! Fun and easy to make.

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe! Followed other suggestions by placing cup of hot water in oven to prevent cracks and cutting around the edge of pan as soon as you take it out of the oven. Used MINI-chocolate chips instead (Which I think is MUCH better). Also, for crust, I chose to melt sugar in butter and THEN mixing with graham crackers so no sugar grains are in the crust. Super delicious!

Very good. I did not have espresso powder OR instant coffee powder (I thought I did) but I tried that Nescafe instant Cafe Latte powder and added 8 teaspoons. (Experiment) It was great! The flavor was terrific and the chocolate chips fell to the bottom near the crust, which made for a nice little crunch. I'll try the espresso powder next time also and see how that tastes. Everyone that tasted it loved it also- I will keep this one in my cheesecake file.

This is a super good cheesecake recipe. Baking them without cracking is an art I have perfected. I have tried in the past to explain it, but it comes down to the fact that you just have to have a special relationship with cheesecake batter.

Okay, I think what happened to the crust is that the recipe is confusing. It lists 1 1/2 cups sugar, but does not say "divided". If you don't read the text carefully, you put the whole 1 1/2 cups sugar into the crust when really it should be only 1/4 cup. I wasted my first graham crackers by adding all the sugar, too. Lucky me, I caught it in time! I made this cake for Easter and everyone told me that now I would have to make it for every holidy...it knocked out my traditional rum cake that everyone loves. So this is a great cake. I did the pan of water bit, but still had giant craters. It did NOT affect the taste, obviously!! Can someone tell me how to get the cheesecake off of the bottom of the springform pan for serving on a nicer dish? I cannot figure it out! Thanks!

I thought this cake was delicious - but it was a lot of work. I found the texture a little too heavy. I read comments and used only 1oz of chocolate and had no problem with the crust. thanks!!

I have a small catering business in which I specialize in cheesecakes. This is a great recipe, I always get rave reviews from this cake. To elimate the cracks or "craters" as mentioned by others, I ALWAYS put a dish of water in the oven while baking my cheesecakes. After experimenting with this recipe several times I have perfected the "crack-free" cake by baking the cake at 425 degrees for the first fifteen minutes and then reducing the temperture to 225 degrees and continue cooking for about one hour and fifteen to twenty minutes. Try this method and see if you do not have better results!

I either did something wrong or the recipe is not correct. This crust almost crystalized. Next time I make I will not put so much sugar in the crust. The cheesecake itself is very good and has excellent flavor. I will make again but try something different for crust.

Love this recipe!! Made it for Thanksgiving and it got rave reviews from everyone, even my cousin who's a professional caterer. I followed another reviewer's suggestion of putting a pan of water in the oven with the cheesecake and it came out perfect. I made it a second time, and did the same thing as before, but it split down the middle (still tasted great though). Go figure.

I have tried this recipe three times till date. My results have been pretty consistent. I usually allow 10 mins of extra baking time. The only problem I have had is the formation of one or two cracks in the center after cooling but that does not spoil the cake in any way. The cake is delicious, I made one for a potluck dinner and two for our christmas party. Each time dessert was an absolute hit with the guests and I enjoyed receiving all the appreciation. Simple ingredients,easy procedure, will make it again.

I have made this recipe twice now, with rave reviews both times! The first time, I made it for a departmental party and was informed by both my director and senior director (as they smacked their lips and looked for more) that I no longer needed to worry about my end-of-the-year rating! :) After hearing my stories of its success, my family demanded that I make it for them as well, and they also loved it. My one concern both times was that the cake didn't seem to quite set in the middle after about an hour and ten minutes (i.e. a knife inserted in the center came out only somewhat clean). But after chilling overnight, it turned out fine.

To prevent any cheesecake from cracking always place a small dish(corning, pyrex,etc) of boiling water in the back of the oven, on the same rack as you put the cheesecake, before placing the cheesecake in the oven.

I made this for a dinner party I hosted. What a disappointment!! I've made cheesecakes before and have never experienced such problems! First, I baked it 1 hour and 5 minutes. When I removed it from the oven the cake was "puffed, cracked and JUST set in the middle - so I thought! After lettting it cool for the instructed 30 minutes, the entire surface cracked with a gapping whole down the center, and the complete center "caved in". I have no idea what could have happened. I have left a message with Bonappetit Helpline and have yet to receive a response. I have called previously for help with recipes and NEVER received a return call. Horrible recipe! Waste of ingredients!

I made this cake as a birthday cake for a woman i work with, i got 16 generous servings out of it and would have liked to have more. Everyone raved about it and did not believe I had made it. For the first responder, you should also check your oven temp with a thermometer. Mine had a small crack, no falling at all and I had to cook it about 4 min. longer than stated time.

Heavenly; not the best cheesecake I have ever made, but very wonderful. In response to the previous reviewer, always cut around the sides of your cheesecakes as soon as you take them out of the oven. That way, when they fall as they cool, as they always do, you won't end up with a cracked mess.
