I've made this twice in the oven. I used two smaller fish on both occasions. The second time I didn't have olives but it was great anyway. It's very delicious.

Absolutely delicious! The flesh of the mackerel becomes completely velvety and rich, with that strong ocean taste. I stuff slices of garlic in the fish slits, and you can also put the olives in the fish cavity if you'd like, because adding the oily sauce after the fish is done adds too much fat for my taste. I LOVE putting this mackerel on a portuguese roll for a delicious fish sandwich. It doesn't need any other seasoning!

This was a lovely way to serve a whole Spanish mackerel we had. Only comment is that we should have reduced the cooking time, as our fish was a bit smaller than called for in the recipe. I wasn't sure how to check a doneness on a whole fish, so I ended up overcooking it a bit.

Best recipe I have found for mackerel which we call Sierra in Mexico. This time I didn't have lemon so I made a few changes that I think took this recipe up a notch. I substituted one lime and 2 oranges for the lemon juice and zest. I added a clove of chopped garlic and cracked black peppercorns to the sauce and cut back on the olive oil. I really liked the taste of the grilled orange slices and the combination of orange and Kalamata olives. It gave the dish a more complex flavor than the lemon. It was very easy, very light and fresh. It made an attractive and heathy meal with a side of steamed fresh spinach.

This is the perfect recipe for cooking the Sierra Mackerel we often catch. It is easy and can be made with ingredients we keep on hand. Using pitted kalamatas is best and I have even used limes when lemons weren't available. The result is really delicious

Very good, the sauce was great - I had to put a pinch of sugar cause my lemon juice seemed exceptionally sour. I didn't use mackerel fish but instead a large wild snapper. The fish came out great on the grill. It looked beautiful with the lemon and oregano sprigs tied on as well. For the cavity of the fish, I mixed in a few other herbs by adding in sprigs of thyme, dill as well as the oregano.

Worked like a charm, tasted great. The recipe might be clearer that you *don't* brush the fish with the olive oil/lemon juice mix -- you use that once the fish is off the grill. (Probably "duh"; olive oil would drip and flame.) We skipped the olives in that "post grill sauce" part, and loved it all the same. Will definitely do it again -- we found some whole mackerel for about $3/lb, and it was more than adequate for 4 adults.

I didn't have an outdoor grill so I just baked it in my oven. Taste was a little bland.

I really did like this dish, but know I must make some changes next time. I followed the recipe but used the broiler to cook the fish. This really does need to be cooked on an open fire and I will do that next time. This is a delicious fish and other ingredients were perfect. I believe the open fire would make this a four star.
