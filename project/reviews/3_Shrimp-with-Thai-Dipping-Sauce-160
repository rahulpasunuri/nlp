Mmmm. As recommended in other reviews, I used cocunut milk only. Sooo good.

Used coconut milk instead of milk and extract as suggested. The flavors were bland and the dipping sauce was too thin to stick to the shrimp.

Absolutely LOVED it! Regarding the milk issue, I substituted coconut milk for the unspecified milk in the recipe and omitted the coconut extract. This won raves among members of my supper club! This recipe is a keeper.

What kind of recipe is this? I am from Thailand - we DO NOT put any kind of milk in our dipping suace! No wonder it did not come out as well for those who have dared to try it :(

The flavors were good, complex. However, I would not make it again primarily because I guess I don't like cold sauces for shrimp.

I cant believe that everyone didnt RAVE about this recipe! I forgot the low fat aspect - used whole milk, no coconut extract(rather coconut milk) and also added chopped cilantro. It was the BEST SAUCE I HAVE EVER TASTED. Another epicurious winner

If you love mint leaves I would recommend this. Next time I will marinate the shrimp raw and cook it stir-fry.
