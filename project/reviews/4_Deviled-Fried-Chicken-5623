this is pretty fantastic. I used cut up 'tenders' made from boneless skinless breasts. just amazing. everyone should try.

Just a question...I have made this today and it is marinating as we speak however, I misread the recipe and all the spices are in the marinade! Does anyone think this is problematic? Do I lessen the seasoning in the flour mixture? Do I not marinate as long? Thanks in advance:)

This batter recipe is so wonderful. Being southern, I know great fried chicken. I made a mistake though, and used large breast pieces. The next time I will use various and smaller skin- on pieces.

This is - by far - the best homemade fried chicken recipe I've ever tried. My search is over. I used boneless skinless thighs, using the same cooking times, and it was exceptional.

I've tried making fried chicken a few times but always screwed it up, until now. Using breasts cut into strips I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers, cutting the salt, sprinkling the spices on first before dipping the in the flour, marinating for 2 days, lowering the temp and finishing in the oven and this is one of the best fried chickens I've ever had. Still, I'm one of those who can't leave well enough alone. I'm going to try something from another recipe here on Epicurious, triple coating it. I'm going to double the marinade, first spice the chicken, then dip in the flour, mix flour and baking powder in with the remaining marinade, dip the chicken again and then dip in flour again. If it comes out too think a crust then I will try just double dipping, no flour in the marinade just dip in flour, the marinade and then flour again. BTW, I always brine chicken. It just opens the meat up to absorb more of the marinade for better flavor and a moister piece of chicken.

This recipe is truly amazing - I've attempted many fried chicken recipes and none turned out as good as this one. I think the key is to let the chicken sit in the flour mix so it can settle and dry. The coating stuck perfectly to the chicken producing a crispy crust. I tried this recipe last night and am making the second batch today - I am sure it is even better today. Definitely a keeper!

A recommend for Fried Chicken newbies. This was my second attempt at fried chicken, my first 10 years ago and turned out bland and awful. I was skeptical going in. I read alot of reviews and lightened up the salt and decreased a tad of cayenne. The chicken was very flavorful! Even though I used thermometer and tried to keep temp as recommended, the deep fryer was burning the outside of chicken so I finished them off in the oven. My husband loved it but have to agree it is alot of work and your house smells like oil for a couple of days:) Will definitely be making this again though for only very special occasions;)

I now understand what all the fuss is about. Home fried chicken ROCKS! I've only had the supermarket stuff and KFC before. I've been missing out! Great recipe. I cut back on the cayenne a bit in the flour mixture as I am not a fan of super spicy stuff, and I didn't have mustard powder so had to omit that...but followed the method exactly.I now think I make the best fried chicken on the planet!

Rating: 4
Followed this recipe to the letter more than 20 times over the years and have always ended up with perfect fried chicken! I just learned the hard way though, that using fat-free buttermilk doesn't work. The coating doesn't stick to the chicken, and you'll end up with "bald" chicken in a burnt, oily mess.

I've made a LOT of fried chicken. Cooks Illustrated, Alton Brown, Ad Hoc... I've tried 'em all. I can't precisely say this one trumps them because, since you remove the skin, the result is pretty different. That said, even without the skin (I love the skin so I was concerned about this), this is friggin' fantastic. That's saying a lot because I totally blew the recipe. I thought that since I had a really big skillet, maybe I could trick the chicken into frying into one batch. No go. The temp of the oil dropped, the chicken didn't fry up fast enough, and a ton of the wonderful yummy coating ended up floating in the oil instead of on the chicken. It was still SUPER good. I did the finish-in-the-oven thing, by the way (which is really helpful if you want to make cream gravy to go along with the fried chicken and, um, why wouldn't you?). Preheated the oven to 250, fried the chicken for five minutes per side (til nice and mahogany) and then put it on a wire rack over a cookie sheet in the oven for about 20 minutes (coincidentally, just about the time it takes to make cream gravy...) The coating is absolutely delicious. I think this'll be my go to recipe from now on. I may try it with the skin sometime just to see... :) Ooh, ooh, A really big tip that will help you out... Instead of putting the seasoned flour in a baking dish and then flipping the chicken in the flour, keep about half the seasoned flour to the side, put the chicken in the flour in the dish, and then just pour the remaining flour over the top. WAY less messy.

Great stuff; poorly written recipe (read it through first!). My first attempt at fried chicken--very crispy, generous breading. Saltiness on par with commercial fried chicken. Used just wings and legs. Used a countertop deep fryer--5 minutes each side at 360 was fine for good-sized legs and wings. Substituted sweet paprika for cayenne for the kids.

Rating: 4
Marinated it for 2 days. Made the coating without the cayenne for the kids, but will halve tha coating next time and add it to one batch. Being a fry-o-phobe, I will do anything not to deep fry, but this is well worth the preplanning and effort!

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious. Just enough spice for zest but not too hot for timid eaters. Taking the advice of previous reviewers, I cut the salt in the coating back to 3 teaspoons and upped the cayenne by 1/2 teaspoon. Can't wait to try the leftovers tomorrow.

Very good. Eating it now. Very moist.I made it exactly as per the recipe. I was concerned re salt so I adjusted salt in the coating down to 1 1/2 tsp vs. 3 and it was great. otherwise as directed. the rest is still frying and it is very satisfying. I have been craving it since I read the recipe and all the reviews! Very delicious and I do think there is enough spice in the coating even when mixed with the flour but understand if people like it super spicy they may want more cayenne.

The verdict is in.....yes it is very good chicken....can't go wrong with this recipe....BUT....I like the Paula Deen marinate in eggs and hot sauce...I will double the spices in the coating next time except the salt and then cook longer maybe 5 mintues more....it wasn't done enough for me.

I made this years ago for a Kentucky Derby party I threw. I remember thinking "this is a lot of work for fried chicken". It was SO worth the work! Every time I turned around to bring out more fried chicken it was gone off the table. Everyone loved it! I am having a house warming party tomorrow and I'm frying up a batch as I type ;) I am pairing the chicken with pecan waffles. The only suggestion I have is to cook like parts together...ie: wings, then drums, then thighs, then breasts. You'll need to vary fry times to get everything JUST right!

Rating: 4
My first comment would be read carefully and make it exactly as written....The first time I tried this, I had not read through the whole prep description and used ALL the spices in the buttermilk: very bad, salty results.....The second time, I didn't notice the explanation to LEAVE the chicken in the flour for an hour and toss occasionally to re-coat it before frying: quite edible, O.K. results..... This last time, I made it carefully and did everything exactly as written with one exception: we used boneless skinless breast and thigh chicken meat (my Dear Husband doesn't like skin or bones in meat, so this was my concession to him). The results: FAN- frickin'-TASTIC!!!!.....This was even better the next day, when we warmed it in the oven using a wire rack on a cookie sheet... and more oil dripped off so, healthier, right? This is by far the best fried chicken recipe I have ever made, and I will make it with bone-in with- skin-on pieces next time (and use some boneless skinless breast meat for my DH)..... The other thought we had is to make our own "nuggets" this way for an hors d'oeuvre at a party. We dipped the chicken in BBQ sauce and Hot Sauce, and might try plum sauce next time, too..... We think this recipe is a BIG winner!

I don't know what I missed here, it seemed like a ton of work and wasn't as flavorful as I'd hoped. Mt fiance liked it a lot (but he'll eat anything). Next time it's Popeye's here I come-seriously for the few times a year I eat fried chicken might as well go out!

Oh boy, is this good eats! The only thing I add is a teaspoon of paprika to the flour mix.

Used real onion, green onion, and parsley in the marinade since I had some on hand. Stuck to the powder for the crust. I baked at 350 for 45 minutes. Had to brush some butter on the breasts to crisp up the crust; the other pieces were fine with one turn in the middle of baking. I baked because my husband doesn't like fried food. Next time, I'll fry them. They were good baked, but I imagine they're better fried.

I tried this recipe for Superbowl. We had a number of friends in for dinner. I never fry foods, but thought I would give this one a try as it was highly rated. I can honestly say..it was dreadful. And maybe because we are not used to fried foods. The chicken was sopping with grease, and this was after I had let it "drain" on racks, and I took paper towels and tried squeeze out the rest of it. This is not a recipe I would try Fried again, I might consider baking as one other reviewer had mentioned they had done.

My husband and I love this recipe. I've made it several times. I now use thighs (for him) and some boneless breasts (cut in same size pieces) for me. We've served it up to many friends with rave reviews. The marination makes all the difference -- 1 day is good, 2 days is better. This is definitely a treat!

I have enjoyed this recipe since it came out in 1998. It is excellent. I often use boneless, skinless breasts and they are always moist and delicious.

I made this fried chicken for my husband's birthday and it was a hit! I thought it was a bit spicey but we like it that way. Thanks to other reviewers, I did cut back on the salt and I'm glad because it came out perfectly seasoned. I've always soaked my chicken for frying in buttermilk but never with the myriad of spices used in this recipe. It was a fantastic blend of flavors...so much so that I couldn't pick out one specific spice, and to me that is well balanced and how it should be. Since I was cooking for 15 people, I too finished mine in the oven and it turned out great. Yes fried chicken is a mess, but of course you know that going into it and this recipe was worth every bit of it!

This is a really nice fried chicken recipe. It was a touch to spicy for me, but others liked it a lot. I didn't have buttermilk, so I used whole milk, and it still turned out well. I also browned both sides and finished it off in the oven. I really liked the fact that there was no skin involved in the final product.

Excellent recipe, but I think it is worthwhile bumping this tip from Cal Cook to the top again. Needless to say I messed up the first time. _____________________________ This chicken is very good, but MIND the recipe. Read it from start to finish before you start! First, this takes 2 DAYS to make, so if you're headed to the store with the print-out, you'll be frying this tomorrow. Also, the recipe is deceiving; you think the only ingredients in the coating are flour, baking&garlic powder, but read the directions again! Although the flour coating is separated from the buttermily soak, most of the ingredients that go in the soaking mixture actually go in the coating. I only found this out after realizing that the buttermilk mixture couldn't possibly have 4 tsp of cayenne and 5 tsp of salt! So, once I started over again, I realized that the recipe is not written as you think it should be. Like another reviewer, I cut the cayenne in half, because I do not want my chicken to bite me back. While you're frying, I'm not sure the significance of using the required wooden spoons to turn and remove it, as my trusty spring-loaded tongs worked just fine. All in all this was good fried chicken, just plan on what should take about an hour to take 24.

Yes this is a lot of work, but the results are nice. I think it's WAY too salty and I reduce the salt in the marinade and the batter. I also skin the chicken before marinating, to reduce the fat. Once it's battered and fried you can't tell the difference.

My son won't eat poultry that has been brined. He says that it changes the texture in a way that he doesn't like. The buttermilk makes the chicken moist, but does not make it tough, as brining sometimes does. I have used boneless, skinless breasts and I sometimes cut them into pieces then use this buttermilk marinade. The breading sticks nicely to the meat due to the buttermilk. I don't see why you couldn't finish this in the oven. It's really a very versatile method. I use more spice. Sometimes I add chipotle powder.

I didn't even have half the right ingredients...no buttermilk so I used sourcream and a dash of vinegar. I had to use vegetable oil, and I only had honey dijon mustard.Left it to soak for two days because I didn't read the recipe all the way through and the next day I worked too late to cook. But darn was this good!Maybe the extra day soak made up for the lack of the right ingredients. I did not find this too salty. I started it out with the coarse salt inhalf the flour mix, definitely needed to switch to regular table salt as the coarse salt didn't season the entire coating of flour, only bits and pieces. Definitely worth the time. Do pick out the blackened bits, it makes a difference.

Gotta' add my voice to the choir! This is great fried chicken (especially for skinless). I used 1/2 the cayenne as I have small kids who refuse to eat "spicy" and it was fine.

This is the best fried chicken I've ever made, in a long chicken-frying career. 4 teaspoons cayenne is none too much; you could easily use more, though the recipe as written produced drippings for the world's best gravy. I used canola oil refined for frying at high temperatures, and an electric fry pan, which I recommend to monitor the temp. I doubled the recipe and served it at a work party; people couldn't get enough, even those who normally avoid fried foods.

This was awesome. I took previous reviewers suggestions used boneless/skinless chicken breast cut in half. I might pound them next time to reduce cooking time.

Not sure of how many times some of the previous reviewers have "fried real chicken" but mine came out fantastic!! Loved the flavor and yes it is correct to mix the seasoning in with the flour (it's how KFC claims to have a secret) but I did add a little extra cayenne pepper and onion powder to the chicken before the flour step. Chicken was moist and flavorful. To those who said that the skin or coating was hard your oil is waaaaay too hot. And try vegetable oil not shortening lessens the fat intake ;-).

Rating: 3
To the cook in Fairfax, VA: you had the right idea, just rest the chicken for a few minutes instead of for a full hour. Plant starches like this are the foundation for a lot of glues, and that's why your crust was so hard. The only modification I would make to this recipe is to separate the spices from the flour/baking powder. The "ingredients" section seemed to suggest this, but the "prep" section did say to combine everything. Coat the chicken with the spices first, and then dredge through the flour mixture. Some of those spices can burn; the flour protects them. Also, if you like your chicken spicy, you'll waste a lot of that cayenne if it's distributed through all that flour -- probably why so many here have complained that their chicken didn't turn out as spicy as they'd expected. My personal preference, which has nothing to do with flavor, is to fry this in shortening instead of oil. It browns just as well, but without the house-filling smell others have complained about here.

Rating: 3
The flour coating had a great flavor, and so did the marinade. However, the coating came out really hard after frying -- did that happen to anyone else? The next time I make it, I'll just quickly coat it instead of leaving it in the flour for a whole hour, to see if that helps.

This was ok fried chicken. I didn't think it was very spicy, especially given all the seasonings added to the buttermilk brine and the flour coating.

Oh, what a problem! My family loved it and I didn't really care for it[the only reason for 3 forks] Maybe I just didn't like the smell of the oil frying it.

Maybe not the world's best fried chicken but certainly a top contender. I doubled the amount of chicken and marinade but not the flour mixture (it seemed like a lot). Next time I will definitely double the flour mixture as well. Also, be sure to remove any fried bits of coating which may be left in the oil before adding the next batch of pieces. Otherwise the excess batter bits will burn and/or stick to the chicken pieces as they fry. Served with coleslaw, potato salad and homemade cherry pie for a southern feast. Forget the Colonel, this really is finger licking good chicken.

This is, hands down, the best homemade fried chicken I have ever tasted! I am "fry-o-phobic" of anything containing more than about 1Tbs of oil in the pan, but this was very easy. I only marinated for the better part of 1 day, still came out tasty. I didn't reduce the salt and it tasted fine to me, but I am somewhat of a saltaholic. Works very well with boneless, skinless breasts (what my husband and I ate) AND tenders (what my 2 year old gobbled up). Make this and you won't be sorry!! Oh, and try using the seasoned flour to make a little white gravy to pour on mashed potatoes; yummy!

I thought I'd died and gone to heaven. An incredibly delicious (skinless!) fried chicken. By far the best I've ever had. As with several people below, I fried the chicken for a slightly (2 min) shorter time than called for by the recipe, then put it in the oven at 250 to finish it off and keep it hot while finishing the remaining batches. Tender, juicy, crispy, moderately spicy. Better than KFC, better than my grandma's, amazing.

Loved this dish. I did change a few things. I marinated in a FoodSaver canister for 24 hours. I also fried 3 minutes each side at 360, then transfered to 350 oven on wire racks with a shallow cooking pan under. I baked for 30 min. and turned oven off. The baking released alot of the oil, but the chicken was still very moist and crisp on the outside.

This is such good chicken! I have been using this recipe for a little over a year for my "FCP" (fried chicken parties) get-togethers and I always get raves. One thing I like to do is to use a whole white onion in the marinade instead of the onion powder. I find this gives it a little stronger flavor. Veggie oil is a must for a clean taste.

THIS IS THE BEST FRIED CHICKEN I HAVE EVER MADE, IN FACT I MAKE IT ALL THE TIME NOW! It get's rave reviews from everyone! (I add a little more cayenne pepper than called for) I end up passing out the recipe to everyone who trys it!

Rating: 3
The results are definitely worth the time and effort! We're big on spicy, so I added a few drops of Tabasco habanero to the buttermilk mixture and increased the spice. Also, would validate the other reviewers' comments about the salt, as it was a bit salty.

I have always had a hard time making "good" fried chicken. This is by far the BEST recipe I have found. The chicken is very crispy and juicy on the inside. Fantastic flavor without being overly seasoned!!!!

This Southern cook loves this chicken. It is a great twist on fried chicken that can be easily eaten with a fork! My supper club raved, and many of us have prepared it since.

Love this recipie!! I've made this many times, and it's always a big hit, definitely worth the long prep time. My husband loves it, when he sees the dish marinating in the 'fridge, he gets all excited knowing what the next night's dinner will be! When I make this, I use boneless/skinless breasts - cuts down the cooking time & helps the breading stick evenly. I've also found that using vegetable oil (instead of peanut) gives it a cleaner flavor, and I season the flour alot more than the recipie calls for. This is by far the best fried chicken recipie I've ever tried - makes KFC look like the totally repugnant slop it is!!

I loved it. Great crusty skin with a spicy bite to it. As good cold as it was when just cooked.

This recipe is very flavorful. My Husband and children love it. My husband requests this recipe. My children hate everything to the point of washing their meat off if it has anything on it they can't identify but this is the first recipe they haven't done the above.

I found this recipe to be quite boring. Not spicy at all, guess I am used to really "HOT" dishes. I marinated for one whole day and found that the coating didn't stay on well at all. Frying in peanut oil made it fry too quickly and I would choose to fry in vegetable oil the next time. I have had much better fried chicken recipes and would alter this one BIG TIME!

Rating: 2
I found this to be pretty good, though I can't say delicious. I've never made fried chicken before due to greasiness, mess and a four-year stint of being a vegetarian. I would say that the coating is, in fact, delicious, but was disappointed that if wouldn't stay on the chicken. As per suggestions of other reviewers, I cut back on the salt. Not as good as my grandmother's Maryland fried chicken (but she had a special frying pan she used just for her chicken), but good nonethess.

This was FANTASTIC!!! Me, the cook, raved about it the entire time I was eating it. Sublime chicken. A few modifiations: I let the marinade sit for 1 day and fried it in veg. oil, since the crust was browning faster than the meat was cooking, I let the crust get a golden color than finished the chicken off in the oven at 350. It was still very tasty with just the right amount of spice. I can't wait to make it for company.

Rating: 4
I loved the chicken! Wonderful recipe and very simple to do. The only thing I changed was that I added a little more black pepper but the rest of the recipe is great. The coating stayed on and was very even and crispy. I saw this recipe on the Epicurious show and knew it was going to be great. I would make it again.

Best fried chicken ever! Had the girls over for brunch and they raved about it -- couldn't believe there was no skin on the chicken. They've asked for copies of the recipe. No need to alter the recipe -- it was perfect even the next day.

I've made this twice and everyone loved it. I'm not always so careful with my measuring so it was hotter the first time but wonderful both times. I plan to make it again this weekend for company. I don't even like chicken and I enjoyed this recipe.

This is the best fried chicken we ever had!!!

My gang of good cooks all loved this. I made it pretty much according to the recipe but with less salt. Popped it onto a rack in a low oven after frying for a few minutes, and then drained it on paper towels before carting it off to a picnic a couple of hours later. Wonderful stuff, stayed nice and crispy, big hit with everyone. I used breasts (cut in half before marinating) and legs, and would definitely make it again. Served with slaw, potatoe salad and biscuits - GREAT!

Great fried chicken! I usually stay away from fried foods but saw this being made on Epicurious. I had to give it a shot. I thought the seasonings were perfect.I substituted dried minced onions for the onion powder and garlic pepper for the garlic powder. I also use Kosher salt so maybe that is why mine was not too salty. Served it with garlic mashed potatoes. Great combo.

Rating: 3
Aside from the overnight marinating, this was fairly easy to prepare. I made this for my family last night and they liked it. I increased the amount of cayenne and decreased the amount of salt. It was very good. Even my little one who doesn't like chicken or spicy foods finished all of his dinner. (This was not very spicy.) I wouldn't say that it is better than KFC chicken, but with a little adjustment, it definitely has potential!

Rating: 4
This fried chicken was excellent, but it kills me to wait 48 hours to marinate the chickent although it was totally worth it. Only minor change I made was that I cut back on the salt by 1 1/2 teaspoons after reading reviews and out of fear that the chicken would be too salty, it turned out great.

In Sweden, we don't eat much fried food, but as my American boyfriend is constantly talking about KFC, I decided try this out. What a success! Everyone LOVED it, even my health-conscious friends, and my boyfriend rated it as the best fried chicken he's ever had. The flavours were just amazing; juicy and moist, crispy and spicy. (added some extra cayenne) I served it with different dips, bbq and ancho-chili from this page. Potato-skins, corn on the cob and garlic rolls: What a meal! Only problem is that now everyone is begging me to cook this again, but hey, it's my pleasure!

This chicken was out of this world. No leftovers to speak of, my entire family enjoyed this recipe. I let the chicken marinate for 2 full days, which I think helped alot. Will make again.

This was delicious and spicy. We loved it and I will definitely make it again. I have an aversion to frying so I followed the recipe except for the frying part. I baked it in the oven and the chicken came out very tender on the inside, infused with the flavor, although it wasn't as crispy as it would have been had I fried it. But there were crispy parts anyway. We love spicy, so I did use more of the cayenne than was called for. Delicious!

I thought this recipe was just so-so. I had a really thick crust when I fried the chicken...almost too thick & I didn't find the flavor anything too exciting. It was fairly easy to make though

Excellent! I'm not a big fried chicken fan but this recipe has converted me. I couldn't keep my fingers out of the leftovers all weekend. The spice was perfect for us, but if I were feeding toddlers or young children I'd probably cut the heat a bit.

Wow!! I'm an old hand at making southern fried chicken but this takes the prize. I have tried several chicken recipies that use a buttermilk based marinade and they were all really good so I have decided the marinade is definitely the way to go. I don't like spicy so I reduced the cayanne in the flour mixture by 1t and it was just perfect. My husband raved and I am making a double batch for the weekend!

I made this chicken for guests last night and they rated it as one of their top meals ever. It's not that much work. Excellent Chicken. I cant wait to eat the leftovers.

Incredible! This is some of the best fried chicken I've made. I halved the recipe, and I didn't have any buttermilk so instead I substituted milk with a little vinegar, mixed with Parmesan Italian dressing. I marinated for two days, and had pierced each chicken piece with a knife a few times so it would really soak up the marinade. It turned out so juicy, and the coating was perfectly crispy but not hard. I finished it in the oven after it had browned in the oil and drained for a few minutes. Wonderful, and perfectly seasoned! It doesn't turn out too salty if you use Kosher salt rather than regular table salt.

This is a great recipe! I made it last week only I deep fried it for 10 minutes till it was golden and then put it in a 275degree oven on a rack for 30min. Came out crunchy and delicious!

To the cook from Kent, two thoughts: First of all, please don't rate the recipe if you've never tried it! Giving it one fork is unfair. Secondly, if you want to try this, make it yourself! There are no rules against men cooking that I'm aware of! If your wife likes the end result, maybe it will resolve the problem (or just promote you to chef, at times)

This fried chicken recipe is the best and it is so simple! Marinating the chicken overnight makes all the difference! It was not too spicy as it may seem. It is a favorite! Please try it!!!

Delicious, and in fact, I thought it was even better cold the next day. In future, I will buy already cut up chicken or packages of thighs, legs, etc. To the gentleman in Kent, WA, whose wife didn't want to cook this, it's well worth doing yourself. Put in marinade the evening before and cook the next day!

I liked it but my husband prefers my fried chicken I found there was not much difference,my recipe takes alot less ingredients and is just as good, with my busy schedule I'll stick to my recipe which is less time consuming and just as good. P.S It was better cold.

Unfortunately, I'll never know how this recipe is supposed to taste. One day, possibly two days, means "overnight" to my wife. One hour means, "Why would they want to do that?" Any protestations to the contrary have been seen as 1) Criticism of her cooking 2) "Why don't you do it your d*** self then?" Even though she has not followed the recipe as specified, I'm not at liberty to criticize, if I know what's good for me. As I speak, there is chicken sitting in batter which just might not get fried at all, unless I do the frying. This for suggesting she might follow the recipe. Who would've thought cooking could be so contentious???

Rating: 3
The coating was excellent and not as spicy as you would think. Even my two young children were fine with the spice. However, I did not use an electric frying pan, instead I just used bubbling peanut oil in a regular pan and the coating came out "hard" not crispy. I thought I might break a tooth. Also, next time I will use much smaller chicken pieces. My chicken breasts were way too large for this recipe and took forever to cook.

Every minute on preparation is worth it. When there isn't a sound around the dinner table, you know you got their attention with good food. This one will be done again and again.

I have already made it for easter and made it for my mother when she was laid up in hospital to cheer her up. It is absolutely delicious and well worth the effort. I would agree with the dried mustard comment. Leave it out of the flour. also be aware of a high salt content. It can be reduced by at least half a teaspoon.

I made this for company last night and everyone raved about it. I didn't put the cayanne pepper in the marinade and reduced the amount to 3 teas. in the flour and thought this was just enough bite to it. This IS the best fried chicken I've ever had.

This is the only fried chicken I make. Always tender and always wonderful. It's even better the next day cold. Be sure to make plenty. Add a few of your favorite pieces - wings, legs or breasts, in addition to the whole fryer. If you choose, cut back a wee bit on the red pepper or salt if you think it too much.

My husband Roger and I don't usually fry our food, but this recipe makes it worthwhile. Roger was the person doing the frying and he found the thermometer invaluable, even though I only had a candy thermometer which went up to 320 degrees. I think I'd use a little less salt next time and try adding new flavors, but this is a. very. good. fried. chicken. recipe. Served it with a bulger wheat pilar and fruit salad.

Rating: 3
Wonderful, but some reservations. Marinate at least, at least a day, and try two. Lighten up just a tad on the cayenne, or else it overwhelms. And this is greasy stuff, you know, much more so than the classics in lard and cast iron with brick. But overall, a treat, especially at room temperature. Great job.

Rating: 4
It's the closest I've found to the crunchy take out chicken. I did eliminate the dry mustard the second time I made it- it was a little overwhelming. Also, make sure you don't wrap it right after frying it. I wanted to take it out on our boat, and wrapped it tightly in foil, and it got all soggy. But otherwise it was great!

I made this using boneless chicken tenderloins. It was delicious. Very spicy, but not too hot. It fried up beautifully--not greasy at all. My husband thought the mustard flavor was a little potent, so I may cut back a little on the mustard next time.

Absolutely delicious. There is no other fried chicken recipe out there that will compare to this. It has a wonderful flavor, with quite a bit of kick. It is well worth starting 2 days in advance to prepare this recipe. I have made this several times, serving with a wild rice salad, corn on the cob, biscuits, and plently of ice cold beer! I wouldn't change a thing; I don't think the chicken is greasy if you let it drain long enough on the paper towels. YUM, YUM!!

Great recipe! The people I served it to asked me to make it again for a dinner party for 50 that they're planning. Served it with homemade biscuits, fresh green beans and Yukon Gold mashed potatoes. I MIGHT cut some of the salt, but otherwise, this was a hit! Thanks.

Finally a fried chicken recipe with flavor! I have to admit I only browned the chicken in the peanut oil, then baked it. But my family loved it! Adding the spices to the buttermilk marinade & the flour really gave it zing. The flour coating was crisp even after being baked instead of fried.

Although fried chicken is not the kind of thing I make everyday, this recipe is great. The chicken was moist and the breading was delicious. Of course frying chicken is going to be a bit messy and the recipe does require some planning, but if you want delicious fried chicken -- this is THE RECIPE.

This recipe is really the best, the chicken is moist and tender. I've made it about 10 times, always to rave reviews. We found that wings don't really take the marinade, so I stick to breasts and legs. If you're making a large amount remember to change to new oil after every 3rd batch or so, as it will blacken and ruin the delicate flavors. Great for football Sundays with a side of cole slaw and cold beers!

this recipe is outstanding! the chicken is unbelievably tender. we also added a little more cayenne as we prefer spicier food. i am only sorry that we did not make more of it as the chicken is great cold!

This is a great recipe, and I find it easier to measure out the ingredients for the flour mixture the day I make the marinade. I don't like chicken on-the-bone, so I use chicken breasts cut up into 2 or 3 pieces. I make a large batch so there is lunch-to-go.
