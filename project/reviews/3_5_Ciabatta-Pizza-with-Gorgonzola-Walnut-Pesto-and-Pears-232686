What an incredible mix of tastes and textures! I've made this countless times (sometimes with pizza crust) and, in small squares it's an outstanding appetizer. You have to add this to your recipe collection!

This is now one of my favorites... So easy to make. I bought mini-Ciabatta loaves from the store to use- 2 mini-loaves is perfect for a main-course serving! Skipped the arugula- and also made sure to use a lot of the walnut pesto! I melted the Havarti first and the topped with the prosciutto, pear, and gogonzola and then put back in the oven to melt the gorgonzola. Mmmm....

I wouldn't call this a pizza... but all the same it makes for an amazing dish. It helps that I absolutely love all the ingredients in the recipe. I made it twice. The first time I tried it at 450 degrees (as the recipe says), with a quick 2 minutes for the fully assembled pizza... and it turned out way too crispy. Second time around I only set the oven to 350 for the havarti, turned the oven off and assembled the rest of the pizza. Then I put the pizza back in the oven so the residual heat would melt the gorgonzola. The consistency was absolutely perfect the second time.

I made this the first time as a main course during the week and my family LOVED it! It's always a hit as an appetizer, too. I even get special requests for it at dinner parties. However I should mention that I don't make it exactly according to the recipe. I don't use the arugula. And I use half the oil, FRESH thyme (makes ALL the difference), make sure your walnuts are fresh (old nuts will ruin it), and it can be made with or without the pears. Most of us like it better without the pears. Also, I assemble the whole thing: pesto, havarti, prosciutto, gorgonzola and then bake it for 15 minutes. The gorgonzola melted makes all the difference and it makes it much easier to serve as an appetizer.

Waaaaaaaaaaay too many flavors. I had one piece and think I would have felt ill if I had more. The pesto alone is so rich. It is also pretty messy so I wouldn't serve it while entertaining.

Disappointing. I love the ingredients, read the reviews; but sorry, I would prefer a pepperoni pizza from a local pizza joint any day.

There are just too many flavors going on in this for my taste. Some guests loved it (yes, I experiment on company) most agreed with me. The general agreement was to eliminate the prosciutto. The only change I made was to do this on a Boboli crust. You need about 1/3 less of everything if you go that route. I also reduced the oil as posters suggested (thank goodness).

We served this at a gourmet pizza dinner party and it won "best recipe" with our crowd. A wonderful combination of flavors. Like some of the other reviewers mentioned, I reduced the olive oil to 1/2 cup, otherwise it would've been way too oily.

This was very good but not as a main dish. Better as an appetizer.

This was surprisingly delicious. I used lavender-infused honey and it played nicely with the rich ingredients. Definitely will make again.

I made this as an appetizer for a Sunday dinner. It was a huge hit! I followed the directions exactly and it came out great. I made on half with the prosciutto and the other was veggie. Delicious!

My roommate and I made this for a party over the weekend. We improvised slightly by sticking the assembled pizza back in the oven until the gorgonzola melted. I was a little worried that since some of the ingredients (gorgonzola, havarti, proscuitto) aren't the most common, this dish would be a tough sell. It wasn't. Everyone loved it! We had a little left over and it rewarms nicely in the toaster.

Lovely! I didn't alter the pesto one bit. It laid the foundation for a sweet pizza nicely. I did alter the rest of the recipe a little bit, merely because I didn't have all the ingredients (for just an appetizer this gets to be rather expensive with the two cheeses and prosciutto). I didn't use arugla, pears or Havarti cheese; I substituted an Edam cheese for the Havarti, merely because it was what I had on hand. My husband was expecting to be disappointed by something carrying the name of pizza that didn't look like an ordinary pizza, but he was pleasantly surprised as he ate it to be able to say he liked it.

This pizza, with its lovely mixture of gorgonzola and pears is simply marvelous. Of course, I heeded the warnings about oil and used roughly 1/3 cup instead of the recommended overdose. It seems best to add the oil 'as needed'( that is, until it has reached a suitable pesto consistency). I also added carmelized onions. In short,the pizza is an excellent, easy, weeknight dish.

I thought this was delicious but have to agree with an earlier review, it was a bit too oily. While I would make it again, I feel like I have to play around a bit with the walnut pesto.

This was delicious. It is very rich, with many layers of flavor. I used a focacia type bread, and it turned out very well.

Did you use the full amount of oil in the walnut pesto? I used 1 cup and even drained the pesto a little before putting it on the bread. It wasn't enough, though -- while the combination of toppings was delicious, the bread was an oil sponge. We scraped off the toppings into the arugula and threw out the bread.

This was wonderful. I didn't use the arugula. I served as an appetizer and everyone loved it. I am going to try it as a pizza on pizza dough.
