would I make it again? Already have twice in a little over a week! It is so easy and so yummy, even those who are not fans of 'fungus' poke around to get to the cheese and come back for more. I don't think the fresh thyme is essential, unless you grow it, I have used dried thyme and/or herbes de provence with success.

Definitely making again, especially in the fall. The thyme and mushrooms make me all warm and fuzzy... It is not a life-altering experiencing eating this dish, but it a very welcome change from the pesto- stuffed or praline-topped brie. It is savory but not flashy, earthy not zingy, but oh so satisfying. I probably skimped - a tad - on the wine, and definitely passed on the shitake (not because I had an issue, just not carried at the first store and refused to go on a fishing expedition). would also guess that dried thyme would suffice, tho I paid up for the fresh this round ("try it once as written" being my philosophy == then tweak at will!! right?!) So, a total keeper....

This is an easy, delicious starter. I couldn't find the dried porcini, so I used a dried wild mushroom mix that did well. I think that I will add some garlic next time, and also more thyme. This will be made often!

Amazing! I didn't use dried mushrooms - just a fresh assortment that I had on hand. Served with Stacy's Pita Chips. Will be making again over the holidays!

I couldn't find porcini mushrooms and my husband doesn't like shiitake so I used a combination of button mushrooms and baby bella mushrooms. I also doubled the wine, used 1/2 port and 1/2 red wine and let it reduce over a longer period of time to let the flavors combine more. The app was great and it was very simple to make, but I think it would have been a bit fancier to spread the mix on the baguette rather than have them sitting next to each other.

The flavours are incredible. Easy to prepare. Possibly the best appetizer I have enjoyed. Everyone raved about this one.

The dried porcini in wine are a must...it makes this an exceptional flavor! Even though I had the box I used tinfoil for a nice presentation. definitely a make ahead--easy appetizer!

Love this! Always get rave reviews and have shared the recipe several times. I use a foil bowl rather than the wooden box. I also use whatever mushrooms are available. I do try to ensure I've got dried mushrooms on hand since it provides such an intense flavour. Will be making it again and again....

This is such an elegant and tasty dish. I have made it several times now. I have never used the porcini, but just a combo of mixed fresh types. Fresh thyme is key.

I made this for a dinner party and everyone raved about it. I used a double cream brie which is many times better than the traditional ones and it made all the difference. Since then several persons at the party have made it and they, too, had the same response from their friends

Even after cutting off a 'thick' slice of the top rind, there wasn't enough room in the wooden box to hold the mushrooms, so I had to create a foil bowl around the cheese to hold it while heating up. It was EXCELLENT. Easy, and one I'll certainly do again.

This was just delicious! Great combination. I also just put the cheese into a small oven-proof dish.

Heavenly. Didn't have time to look for cheese in a wood box. Used an oven proof dish. Added a clove of garlic for the heck of it.....awesome.
