This one always turns out wonderful- especially with in season vegitables. I cook the shrimp separately with garlic, butter, white wine, cilantro, lemon & chipotle chilis- then I freeze them and nuke them right before serving- that way my great soup does not go south before it is consumed.

One of the best gazpachos I've ever made! I did make some changes, one because of the herbs I had on hand and the others to suit our personal tastes. We used dill instead of parsley. I didn't bother with blanching the tomatoes and all that--just seeded and diced them and threw them in like that. We much prefer the taste of red bell pepper, so used that instead of green. To maximize the shrimp flavor, I shelled them first, halved them lengthwise, and then lightly cooked them in a no-stick skillet. Of course it helps to have Florida's fresh local shrimp. :) Email me if you would like the recipe for a tasty garlic/cumin/yogurt sauce to put on top.

This was my first time making gazpacho of any type.I made only two deviations from the recipe;I bought an individual can of tomato juice that was 11oz. and used the whole thing, and accidently left out the parsley somehow. It was a delicious soup. And the bench-mark recipe for gazpacho for me from now on. Be sure to let it sit for at least 6hrs, and overnight would be better. Beware if tasting while making it, you will be dissappointed until it has time to sit. Enjoy!!!

This usually rquires more tomato juice to thin the soup out. Additional salt and pepper are unecessary. The shrimp are good with this, but this can be sereved as a strictly vegetarian dish.

We really loved this soup. I added avocado and croutons, the avocado because I had them, and the croutons because I had made another recipe from the list with basil croutons. That was a good one too. I didn't make the croutons, just bought them. I don't make gazpacho anymore without shrimp and croutons. They add the right something to this soup.
