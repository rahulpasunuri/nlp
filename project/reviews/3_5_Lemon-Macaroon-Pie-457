I absolutely love this pie. I make it several times a year. I don't like almond extract so don't include it and also i use unsweetened coconut so the pie is not too sweet at all, It has a perfect sweet, lemony, tart ratio.

Didn't like this at all. Too sweet, too almondy. I didn't think the flavors melded well. My guests didn't seem to like it either. When we cleared the table a lot of this pie was left on the plates.

I made a macaroon cookie crust instead from Ambrosia Macaroon recipe on Epicurious site. Enough dough left over for a few macaroons for my kids. The pie got raves from my coconut-loving friends who had second pieces and asked to take some home.

I thought this was Fabulous. The filling has the consistancy of lemon bars, which I love. Very tasty.

This pie was a hit with my guest. If you don't make the lemon pie filling, atleast make the crust for another pie. The addition of cake flour makes it light, and the shortening gives it the flakeness. It is so easy making this crust you don't need to buy one in the store...it's not that hard, and the flavor is so superior to a boxed crust. The next day, after being in the refrigerator the crust was still flakey- so this is a good recipe to make ahead. I don't eat a lot of sweets, and didn't find the filling to be to sweet. I do feel the whipped cream was needed to cut some of the sweetness. I added 2-3 Tb. more lemon juice, only because I had it, so that could be why it wasn't as sweet. Everyone's taste buds are different, and we all agree this recipe is a keeper.

This was so spring-like and yummy. Easy to make but I used Pillsbury refrigerated crust rather than make my own.

Tastes of summer. Many years ago I made it for a birthday. Everyone loved it. I concur, a little almond extract goes a long way. A very nice pie. one gets a craving for especially in warmer weather.

This is a wonderful recipe - a real taste sensation! The combination of tart lemon and sweet coconut is a tastebud teaser. I have made this pie numerous times using other short crusts (I have never used the crust from this recipe) and I put it in a tart pan with a removable bottom for a beautiful presentation. My only alteration to the recipe would be to reduce both the amount of added sugar (the coconut is very sweet) and almond extract. I never use whipping cream as decoration - the pie is beautiful as is (NOTE: Be careful not to let the top get too brown.), but I sometimes serve it with a rasperry or strawberry coulis. This pie freezes well, looks beautiful and tastes great!

Great combination of flavors. Enjoyed making this pie a few times a year (when I need a lemon macaroon fix).

The pie had a nice texture but an unbalanced flavor. There was not enough lemon flavor and too much almond flavor.
