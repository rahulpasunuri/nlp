This was a huge hit at the party. Very refreshing for the pool side and hot weather. I used greek yogurt so I didn't have to strain and I also used a seedless cucumber. I doubled the recipe and used some the next day as the sauce to a pasta salad with some fresh veggies. Great with the pita chips or fresh veggies.

This was absolutely delish. Served it at along with several other appetizers at a party. The dip got the most compliments. I used Greek yogurt as well so I did not have to drain the yogurt. I will definately make again.

I didn't like this recipe at all. It tasted like something you'd buy in the dip section of a grocery store. It was much too salty -- I tried cutting the salt by adding more of all the other ingredients, but ended up with a huge bowl that I finally tossed. It tasted like a big bowl of salty sour cream. Very disappointing.

I absolutely loved this dip. It was perfect according to directions. It didn't taste too salty after all the water was squeezed out of the cucumbers. I will definetly be making this again.

Made this for my sister's baby shower to accompany veggies & pita chips. Fabulous, easy recipe...and healthy too! Used non-fat Greek yogurt as other cooks suggested. Could have maybe added a bit more garlic and maybe a little bit of kosher salt...but otherwise, superb! Will definitely make this for our next party.

I used to make it according to the recipe and it took forever! I tried TJ's non-fat greek yogurt per other reviewer's advice and I can't thank you all enough for this tip! =)

I absolutely love ethnic foods. I took the advice from others and used less salt (used one teaspoon to soak the cucumber pieces, I did not grate the cucumber) and Greek non-fat yogurt (which saves a significant amount of time since the Greek style yogurt is already strained). If you are looking to impress some friends, be sure to make this dip at least one day in advance so the salt from the cucumber can absorb into the yogurt mixture.

This is outstanding! I used a mix of regular low-fat and Greek low-fat yogurt, because thats what I had. I drained the regular yogurt, and that was good, but if theres not enough time (and I certainly didnt drain overnight), it would still be acceptable. I added the zest of the lemon as well as the juice, and wouldnt skip the brightening lemon flavor. Next time I will grate the cucumber using the food processor shredding disk; grating by hand was surprising cumbersome. This dish would also be excellent as a stand-alone salad / relish, like a raita to accompany curry.

In my opinion, the use of two cucumbers makes a significant difference. It creates a cooler tasting dip and dulls the strong yogurt flavor. Great summertime dip.

The dip is great. I haven't seen anyone else mention this specifically, but if you bake the pita chips at 400 for 10 minutes you'll get burnt chips. Try 400 at 5-6 mins. (or buy some as others have done).

I followed another user's advice and used Greek yogurt (lowfat) from Trader Joe's so that I did not have to drain it. It was a very nice consistency. I was worried about the salt in the cucumbers but I did drain and squeeze them very well. Even using papertowels at the end - which broke. It turned out that all the salt came out with the water so that I had to add a tad bit extra back in. Did not add sour cream or lemon juice per other comments. The dip was gobbled up on Stacy's pita chips, pita bread and fresh vegies. Using the Greek yogurt was key. Oh, and I added a swirl of extra virgin olive oil and mixed it in. Will add this to my repetoire of appetizers.

Great, simple recipe. However, no need for sour cream, lemon or draining yogurt. Do let the cucumber and salt sit in the fridge, then drain.

This was delicious! Greek yogurt makes a world of a difference, Face-Total from Whole Foods. Do not use the 0%! I was in a hurry and since I was using the Greek yogurt I didn't use the sour cream and lemon. I tossed everything together (squeezing the excess water from the seedless cucumber) used 1 teaspoon of sea salt, since I wasn't letting the cucumber sit. Refrigerate for at least an hour. Also, I served the left over with grilled filet mignon tonight and will try the rest with grilled salmon!

I have made this a few times. I just use greek yogurt (lowfat or whole, but not non-fat) and no sour cream. You can omit the lemon juice as it doesn't really add much. With these slight changes it is really good!

Sorry folks... this is not the real deal! I'm 100% Greek, and I am here to tell you that Greeks don't even know what sour cream is! And we don't put lemon juice in our tzatziki either -- maybe a dash of vinegar, but that's it! Might explain why some think it is too sour..... To make the real deal you need Greek yogurt. Trader Joe's sells it, and even has the FAGE Greek brand. FYI -- you can cut Greek yogurt with a knife -- that is how thick it is. Also be sure to strain your cucumber. And my personal preference.... Triple or quadruple the garlic!!! Good for you and TASTY!!!! Kali orexi!(bon appetite in Greek....:)

You should try adding minced onions or shallots in this recipe for extra flavour! I would also use less lemon juice next time and a tad more garlic.

Delicious with Greek food (made it with Spanakopita from this website). I followed the recipe exactly except I had to substitute fresh mint for the dill because no dill was available.

Thought this was great! Easy to make, & served it with fresh veg & pita, later used leftovers with baked potatoes. Yum!! Made exactly according to recipe. A bit too salty for my husband, so next time I'll use just 2 tsp with the cucumber. Some review I saw said that yogurt with gelatin doesn't drain as well, so I made sure my yogurt didn't have that. I found the drain time for both yogurt & cucumber made a difference, so I'll do it again. I mixed the sour cream with the lemon, dill & garlic & had that sit in the fridge overnight while the yogurt drained, to give those flavors more time to meld. Really nice fresh flavor!

This recipe is great ! I made it exactly as written. I did drain the yogurt and got about 3/4 cup of liquid (I used Dannon Premium Low Fat Yogurt); also the cucumber exuded a lot of juice. I will definately make it again - it was very "fresh" tasting.

Rating: 3
Took to a family reunion and every one loved it. I drained the yogurt for 12 hours and maybe had a 1/2 teaspoon of liquid at most.....So in the future I'm skipping that step. I also only let the cucumber sit for about an hour and then drained on a paper towel. Worked fine, and I think you could skip the 3-hour cucember step as well. I love dill, so as many suggested, increased the amount, and next time will take the amount up a bit more. I added 5 cloves of garlic.....Whoa..."too much." I thought the Pita toasts seemed a bit tame, so used a recipe from the Creme De Colorado cookbook, which is 1/2 cup butter melted with 2 teaspoons cumin and 2 teaspoons lemon-pepper salt. Split the pitas and cut into wedges, brush one side and bake at 400 degrees until browned and crisp.

I've made this dip over and over. Add just a little more dill and lots of cracked pepper. Use Greek Yogurt and there's no need to drain. Didn't even soak cumcumbers...I finely chop them, sprinkle the salt and let sit while I prepare everything else. Then add and you're all ready to go. A real bowl cleaner!

Very good. Since we prefer a more subtle garlic flavor I pressed the clove rather than mincing, and it was perfect. I served the tzatziki with baked potatoes to accompany lamb chops and Greek-style lima beans, and my family was very happy.

Yum!!!!! Followed the recipe exactly. Can't recommend a single change. Will make again and again.

I only drained the yogurt for about 3 hours and it was fine. I like the consistency of it. You definitely need to add extra garlic, lemon juice and dill. The flavors need to blend overnight to get the true flavor.

My friends loved this...cleaned the bowl I served it in. No need to drain the yogurt for 24 hours...I did it for three and the consistency was perfect. Also, in addition to squeezing the cucumber I blotted it on paper towels to get out the excess moisture. I will be serving this often!

Most Tzaziki that I've ever had before had a more watery consistency than this recipe. I think next time I would skip the draining of the yogurt, or add a little more lemon juice. Also, the dish could use some extra pepper.

Absolutely fabulous, whether with pita chips or veggies or gyros. Straining the yogurt and cucumber well is important for an appropriate consistency. Also, I've used nonfat yogurt and reduced fat sour cream with no one noticing the difference.

I did the same as the cook from Dublin, Ohio and served it with toasted pita points and all manner of fresh vegies. I made one change to the recipe by adding a generous teaspoon of high quality extra virgin olive oil to the dip. It added another dimension to the flavor and diminished the granular quality of the nonfat yogurt. It's easy and delicious and great for a hot summer's day.

A good simple dip recipe. I served with the pita chips, r. pepper, carrots, y. squash, celery, and green onions. Used nonfat yogurt (only drained for a short time though, next time I will drain longer), lite sour cream and lite mayo and no one could tell.

This is wonderful! It is easy, lowfat, and very tasty. I used undrained fat-free yogurt and light sour cream and it was still great with my pork souvlaki. Next time, though, I will use less garlic.

This was delicious. I made a simplified version - no yogurt straining, and small chunks of cucumber (unstrained). It was still a hit.

Love this dish. I use it with shredded cukes as a sauce over grilled lamb, or with sliced/cubed cukes and less yogurt as a side dish. Perfect for summer. To add to previous reviews...I think regular (not non-fat) yogurt is important, but that said, "all natural" won't work (too thin). I like to drain my yogurt, in fact, I make the whole thing a day ahead. Make sure you use fresh garlic, and cut out any green shoot growing out the middle of the clove (it tastes funny). I like to salt my sliced cukes and drain them in the sink for thirty minutes, that really reduces bitterness. I still think fresh dill is important -- cleaner taste. And finally, agree with previous reviewer, you MUST add a shot of good quality Olive Oil at the very end.

This is DELICIOUS tzatziki! Usually I just buy mine at the supermarket, but it was never very complex, so when this recipe came my way I decided to give it a shot. I actually planned an entire meal around this dip-- so needless to say, I am glad it turned out so well. Based on other reviews, I started with one clove of garlic, tasted it, then added another... and another. I really think 3 cloves is the perfect amount, but Bon Appetit may have wanted to publish a dip recipe with a more subtle garlic flavor. I also planned on serving this the day it was made, but due to time constraints, had to postpone the meal an extra day. The flavors melded so well, I will always make this 1 day in advance from now on. I was unsure of whether or not to use nonfat yogurt, but since I don't have cheesecloth, I went for it, and it was great. Just like everyone said, there is no need to drain overnight at all. I served the tzatziki with pork souvlaki, couscous, grilled pita, and a Greek salad. Delicious and memorable.

YUM, YUM, YUM......All I did differently was use a bit more garlic. I would also suggest making the cucumbers into chunks rather than shredding it for a side dish of accompanyment to a Greek or Middle Eastern meal (if you are not going to use it as a dip with crudités). Also suggest using this as a sauce over lamb burgers from thew grill served in pitas - and as a refreshing sauce over cold poached salmon. Once again, it's yummy.

My daughter & son-in-law have been looking for a recipe for tzatziki since they went to Greece on their honeymoon last year. I made this version (with a few minor changes) and they loved it. They said it tasted like what they had in Greece. The changes I made were: non-fat yogurt (undrained), more garlic (3 cloves) and dried dill (1 heaping tablespoon. I will difinitely make this again!

Loved it! Easy to prepare. I used Fat Free Plain Yogurt and did not need to let it drain overnight. In fact, I didn't let it drain at all and it turned out fine.

We made this for guests and they raved about it. Substituting nonfat yogurt eliminates the time consuming draining step and countless needed calories. We also used nonfat sour cream and more garlic (four cloves) for a heart healthy dip with carrot chips. If you don't have fresh dill, use half the amount of dried dill weed from your spice cupboard.

Rating: 4
This is an excellent recipe for tzatziki! We had a cucumber around that I didn't know what to do with, so we used it in this! My husband and I both loved it, with one caveat: we feel there's too much lemon juice in the recipe. It made the sauce much more tangy than we would have liked, especially since the plain yogurt does add a tang of its own. Next time I make this (and I definitely will!), I'll cut the lemon juice back to 1 tablespoon or less. Other than that, I couldn't be happier with this recipe -- very easy, very delicious!

This was delicious! I had already tried the cucumber yogurt dip from Gourmet and was not very wowed. When I saw this I almost didn't try it because the ingredients and amounts are so similar that I assumed it would taste the same. Still, I wondered if soaking the cucumbers in the salt beforehand might not make a big difference and sure enough, it did - resulting in a more tasty and complex tasting dip. I served this to 5 people (including 3 teenagers)with a shish kebab/couscous dinner and we all loved it.

This recipe required some forethought since you need to start the day before serving. I was happy with the results. Best cucumber dip I've ever had.
