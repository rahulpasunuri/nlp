Admirable dish! I made the recipe exactly and its delightful! I will definitely do this again. Ill include this to the recipe that I found in www.allthemeat.com that I will share to my friends.

I thought this was delicious. The jalopeno added interest but not heat. I think it definitely needs to be strained. Also, flavors improved after a day in the refrigerator, I would plan on making it a day ahead of time if possible. My only modification was to use the full 7 oz container of full fat Greek yogurt to give a little more thickness.

This was a perfect 1st course on a summer night! Very Nice, light and cooling!

I didn't stray from the recipe, although added a little more white wine vinegar to the crab then called for. My family loved it. I loved it. Refreshing, easy, and make ahead. Perfect first course!

Super easy, delicious and refreshing. Pairs great with sandwiches or panini. Only change (which I recommend) is using lemon juice instead of vinegar and adding minced shallots (or red onion) to crab.

A favorite of mine since last summer, I have made the following changes that others might like. Prompted by this year's excellent Watermelon and Cucumber Gazpacho, also from this site, I now totally omit the crab meat and use a dollop of light sour cream with colorful diced peppers sprinkled on top. Also, I make a larger batch and use a cup or two of soup to puree with 1-2 jalapenos.I have this available for people who want the full jalapeno experience. I freeze some in small baggies for easy availability throughout the summer vegetable season.

A great summer soup - the guests loved it. Extremely easy to prepare.

I've made this a few times. I always roast the yellow peppers. I have substituted leeks for the shallot with good results, but i sautee them first with a clove or two of garlic. I use serrano instead of jalapeno because I feel it has a "greener" taste that goes well with the flavor profile. I don't strain it either.

I've made this a few times but only because I fail to find excellent cold soups. I don't think the crab adds much so I"ve tended to leave it out lately. Not a lot of exciting flavour here.

I apologize to the cook from Rockford for thinking that she was the spoiler in the group. I couldn't wait to try this soup. But, like her, I tossed this mess down the drain, wasting a perfectly good honeydew in the process.

While not "beyond compare" to officially rate four forks, I have already made this soup twice in one hot week. Three and one half forks? Fabulous twist on gazpacho. Lovely vivid yellow color. I liked the texture after blending so much that opted not to press through sieve, and would have tried some fresh corn kernels had they been on hand. Whole jalapeno was too strong for me, but too bland with none.

Excellent! We thought we were not really "cold soup people" but we wanted a fresh and light starter that would really feel like summer. Almost all the ingredients came from the garden. It was so easy to make. I would recommend doing it the day before because it really needs to be chilled well. I also doubled the marinade and added salt and pepper to the crab. I used the best lump available and it mounded so nicely in the center. It got rave reviews from our guests and we will definitely be doing it again!

Lovely. The crab toss in vinegar and oil sets the flavors off beautifully. A keeper - and easy and elegant.

THis recipe is an absolutely delicious addition to our summer stables. We love cold gazpacho soup in the summer, and it is wonderful to have found another cold soup that can be had the same way. Not sure if its a 3 or 4 fork recipe. No changes are really needed to this recipe.

This was surprisingly good. Get the best ingredients possible for full flavors. Very good and low fat, also easy. Could be used at a dinner event and will surely please the guests.

I was so excited to try this recipe and so disappointed in the results! The combination of flavors simply did not work. Glad it didnt take long to make - it all went down the drain.

Has anyone tried roasting the yellow peppers?

This is a divine soup for a hot summer's day. It is as appealing to the eye as to the palate. While I like these ingredients individually, I was surprised at how delicious they were together, and I couldn't believe something so good could be made so quickly and easily. I would definitely, with no doubt, make this again!

This soup course was very well recieved by a picky group of dinner party guests. I did not put the soup through a sieve, as I like more texture, and it was perfect. I used Dungeoness crab, and the soup's seasonings showed off the delicate flavor perfectly. I would definitely make this again.

We had this recipe as a first course at our dinner for six last Saturday. Each guest was asked to review his thoughts on the new recipe, and the overall concensus was 3 forks. Thanks for the wonderful treats. Pat
