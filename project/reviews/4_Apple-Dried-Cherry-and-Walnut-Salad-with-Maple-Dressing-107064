I've made this before and had forgotten about it. Last night I was having guests and started with this salad, they could not stop raving about it. I agree, it is that good! I use Romaine lettuce that I slice length wise into shreds, we love it that way.

Fantastic salad...used arugala as the mixed greens in the store looked limp. the peppery taste of the arugala was well matched with the sweetness of the dressing. Good contrast of flavors, The cherries are a must

I used this recipe for a catering of 200 and everyone raved about the dressing!!! I did modify the salad a bit and used spinach instead of the mixed greens and they went well together and omitted the walnuts. I even added cooked chicken breast and toasted almonds the next day (with left over ingredients) and that all married well!

I served this recipe to a group of friends and everyone loved it - you can't go wrong; it is great.

This was like eating a third rate Waldorf salad tossed with lettuce, dried cherries and a too sweet dressing. Slaw comes to mind. I didn't care for it at all, and am surprised at all the rave reviews. The dressing if you tweaked it down for sugar, might work with a goat cheese & greens type salad. I noticed that this recipe did not make the cut in the in the "Flavors of Bon Appetit 2003" (compilation cookbook of the best recipes from the previous year's Bon Appetit magazines), and I can see why. Not up to par, IMHO.

Rated 4 forks for ease and taste. I omitted the sugar and added more vinegar to balance the maple syrup. Added arugula I had on hand which compliments nicely. Used dried cranberries and Gala apples but the effect is similar, I think. Doesn't get easier than this! Fancy enough for company too.

Rating: 4
I made this salad last night for company and it was a hit. There is way too much dressing, but I just dressed the salad lightly, and let my guests add more as they liked. One change I made was to use baby arugula instead of mixed greens. The bitterness of the arugula was a nice contrast to the sweetness of the dressing. Will make again.

Rating: 4
I have made this recipe many times, but often with variations (pears, cranberries etc.) Made it exactly as written and I think that is my favourite so far! One reviewer's suggestion was especially helpful - I put the chopped apples in the dressing as I was bringing it to a pot luck. No last minute chopping and no brown apples!

Rating: 4
I LOVE this salad. I got the recipe from a friend years ago - I should have known it came from here! This salad is always a winner. Even people who don't normally like sweet stuff in their salads love this salad. Don't skimp on the dried cherries. (I've had it with dried cranberries and it's not as good.) I use pecans instead of walnuts though. I'm going to make it for Easter. I might add some goat cheese or bleu cheese this time.

Rating: 4
I am often asked to bring this wonderful salad to pot luck dinners. I make the salad and dressing, and add the apples to the dressing. I then take the salad and the apple dressing combination separately. The apples don't turn brown if there is a delay for dinner, and I just remove the apples from the dressing and toss them into the salad at the last minute. Enough dressing clings to the apples to make the salad perfect, and the greens stay fresh and crisp. This is the favorite salad of all my friends and family. People say to me, "Can you bring that apple salad with the maple dressing?" whenever there is any kind of gathering involving food.

I did a variation for a birthday and Thanksgiving: apple peeled, cored, and cut into chunks pear peeled, cored, and cut into chunks dried cranberies instead of cherries crumbled gorgonzola along with the toasted walnuts The dressing is wonderful/quick and the salad had people coming back for 3rds.

I wanted something with fall flavors for a dinner party I was hosting. I substituted dried cranberries for the cherries and used toasted pumpkin seeds for the walnuts. I also added parmesan cheese, goat cheese, and tomatoes. Dressing was fabulous. This dressing would taste great on anything you decide to use.

I was attracted to this recipe because it was fairly simple and the dressing could be made ahead. I made it without adding sugar at first, tasted then ended up adding the sugar. I added some thinly sliced red onions and crumbled goat cheese as per others' suggestions. I could have just had this salad for dinner and everyone else raved too.

I have made this recipe so many times that my family is starting to refer to it as "my apple salad." I leave the peels on the apples and thin slice them instead of the matchsticks. I also omit the dried cherries because I think it's sweet enough.

Very good, but mayo flavor was a little too strong...second time I made it I used a little less mayo. I also substituted pears for apples and it was very good. The second time I made it I also substituted toasted pecans for the walnuts; it was good, but almost too rich with the maple flavor and the pear. Next time will stick to the walnuts. Also added some feta cheese the second time, which added a nice sharpness. Will definitely make again.

This is one of my favorite recipes for salad! I made some changes in that I use fresh cut pears instead of apples, and sugared pecans instead of the walnuts, white wine vinegar, and added crumbled Gorgonzola cheese. The salad dressing is actually what makes it so special! It's delicious and can be made with low fat or fat free mayo and still be yummy!

Rating: 4
For a low-fat version I used plain yogurt (low fat) instead of mayo in the dressing. I also could not get my hands on dried tart cherries so bought (fresh) strawberries instead and sliced them. I used pecans instead of walnuts. The salad was a hit. The dressing is delicious.

Everyone loves this salad! I use Grade B maple syrup and the sugar specified in recipe when i make it for guests. Omit it when I make for myself--I don't notice a huge difference. Crumbled goat cheese or blue cheese is a must add, and do not skip toasting the walnuts. It makes a huge difference. Pairs well with pork or fowl and sweet potatoes. Great for Thanksgiving.

I made this recently and only made two small changes. First, I didn't add any sugar to the dressing and thought it was lovely. Also, I had pecans, so substituted those for the walnuts. Scrumptious! I'm going to make it for Thanksgiving dinner this year!

Everyone will love this salad. I only add 1tsp of sugar to the dressing, it is really too sweet with 2 tsp. I also had 1/2 C of gorgonzola to the salad, sometimes i omit the apples and add 1/2 C dried apricots.

I used what I had on hand, which was toasted walnuts, Jongold apples, and fresh cherries. The dressing was wonderful. It is light & refreshing, not heavy. My hubby is very opposed to dressing with a heavy vinegar taste loved this dressing. I omitted the 2t. sugar b/c I felt the dressing was sweet enough w/o it. I used grapeseed oil also. I am anxious to try this with salad ingredients listed. This pairs nicely with heavy dishes.

Nice dressing. Enjoyed the dried cherries.

This salad is really delicious. My entire family (12 of us) raved about it during our Easter dinner. I made a few changes at the suggestion of other reviewers. I eliminated the sugar in the dressing, used ripe Anjou pears and roasted pecans. It looks beautiful and has a taste to match. I really enjoyed the dried cherries in the salad, although they are much more expensive than dried cranberries (as some of you tried instead); I find the cherries to be more flavourful and plumper than cranberries, which I prefer. I also agree that the amount of dressing is far more than is required for the amount of greens. I ended up using only half of it.

The Brewhouse in Duluth, Mn has a similar salad with bleu cheese and chicken and cranberries instead of cherries. I toast the walnuts with a little cumin and chili powder. Sugar is completely inappropriate in the dressing, and feel free to cut back on the oil if you're not feeding a restaurant-full.

This is a holiday staple for me, and makes a great addition to a holiday buffet. I usually mix everything but the greens and nuts together, then toss it with the greens when I arrive at the location. As many have said, cutting the dressing in half or doubling the greens comes out about right. I like to use spicy pecans as they give that nice little bite, but several have suggested putting cayenne in the dressing, which would serve the same purpose. I absolutely love this salad!

I also omit the sugar, its such a sweet salad as it is.

I can't stop making this its so good! I added candied walnuts with cayenne pepper (from this site December 2000) and crumbled goat cheese and substituted the cherries for dried cranberries. For the dressing I added 1 tsp. dijon mustard and a bit more vinegar; like many others i also omitted the sugar.

One of my rare four fork reviews. Outstanding. I use two bags of mixed greens, 3/4 of the dressing, 4 breast halves and it feeds 8 for lunch or 5 for dinner. Warm the dressing a bit. A key to the chicken: soak it in salted water overnight, then saute whole in oil before slicing. Makes strips really tender.

LOVE this salad. I've made it time and again and my guests always have second helpings. The tart cherries and sharp taste of the granny smith apples really help to keep the sweetness of the dressing at bay. I find that with the addition of a little chevre it is hearty enough to eat as a meal. I've also fooled repeat guests into thinking it is a different salad by substituting the dried cherries with dried cranberries and the walnuts with toasted pine nuts. Another great substitution is to use pomegranate instead of the dried cherries. You simply can't go wrong with this salad.

I normally don't like sweet stuff in my salads, but I really loved this when a friend made it at a dinner party.

I've been making this recipe for well over a year and tailor it depending upon what's on hand - a few things I do - don't use the entire amount of oil, but substitute walnut oil- you can always thin with a little more vinegr or water. Also, I use grade B maple syrup - it's the darker version, adds a depth of flavor - for our tastes the extra sugar is not needed. Also try using a mixture of Cherries and other dried berries. Sam's Club has a dried Cherry Berry mix that is awesome and then I omit the apple altogether. Alittle feta cheese added counterbalances the sweetness nicely also. My father in law who is south side chicago polish - likes plain basic food loves this salad. He always takes seconds!!

I made this salad recently as part of a "pre-Thanksgiving" dinner party for a group of ladies. I, too added blue cheese and used craisins. I always like to have as much work done in advance as possible, so I cut the apple into matchsticks earlier in the afternoon and then put them back in the fridge in a baggy with a bit of "Fruit Fresh" mixed with a tablespoon or two of water. It worked like a charm! They were still bright green at dinner - and even when people were coming back for seconds an hour later.

I love the do ahead dressing. I throw in more greens rather then less dressing. I skipped the sugar,used roasted peacans and dried cranniberries, as recommended by other reviewers. The tart granny smith apples balance this recipe perfectly. Serve with confidence.

This salad is fantastic if you enjoy fruit in your salad along with a sweet dressing. It is by far, one of my favorite dressings. My husband used to dislike salads in general, but now we're eating salads more to stay healthy and he said he can't wait for me to make it again! I added some crumbled goat cheese, and used dried cranberries in place of the cherries. My family and "foodie" friends always rave about this salad whenever I make serve it.

Great salad. I substituted mixed greens with baby spinach and it worked great. I also used dried cranberry raspberries which were really tasty. I used half the oil which was plenty. I didn't have champagne vinegar so I used rice vinegar which seemed to do the trick. I also substituted low fat mayo. The dressing was very tasty. Next time I will try some of the suggestions such as omitting the sugar and adding dijon. This salad is a keeper!

Made this salad for an Easter get-together with family. It was good, although I wouldn't say it was spectacular. I didn't add the sugar, as suggested in other reviews, and it certainly wasn't needed. I used the dried cherries and granny apples as was called for, and they were a great touch. Overall everyone enjoyed it but nobody raved. [you want one people will rave over? try the almond-crusted goat cheese w/raspberry dressing - to die for!].

We thought this was a great salad. The cherries and toasted nuts add just the right texture and flavor...I double the amounts of both. I will make this again.

I made it as written, and we found the dressing to be far, far too sweet for our taste. It definitely doesn't need the sugar in addition to the maple syrup. If I made it again, I would probably omit the sugar, decrease the syrup slightly, up the vinegar a bit and reduce the oil. Overall, a very nice combination of flavors.

I have made this recipe several times now. My rural grocery dosn't carry dried cherries but I have found dried cranberries to be a good substitute. My husband always suggests this when we are having a dinner party, and the guests rave about it too. Can't get better than that.

(First review didn't get through) Made this salad again for a big birthday dinner - always a hit! A few random thoughts... I've used Craisins in the past; tried dried cherries this time and liked them a bit better. Didn't peel the apples; chopped them instead of cutting into matchsticks. Toasted the chopped nuts for about 5 min. in a 350 oven, just till they got fragrant. Omitted sugar in the dressing and used only half the dressing on the salad. Tossed the cherries in a small amount of dressing before putting them on the salad - helped keep them from sinking to the bottom right away. Chopped up some leftover chicken a couple days later and threw it on top of the salad for a main dish - my picky kids loved it! (Made a new salad...leftover salad would have been too soggy!)

I thought this salad was good, but I wasn't impressed with the dressing. It wasn't any better than a commercial honey-mustard dressing (which is what it tasted like once I added a bit of dijon to it...that helped it a bit). For a salad w/ apples, I prefer the Spinach Sald with Apples, Avocado and Bacon from this site.

I've made this many times as written and with the following changes: omit the sugar, add 1 finely chopped garlic clove, and add 2 - 3 teaspoons dijon mustard. Balances out the sweetness and provides greater depth of flavor. Try it.

I liked the sound of this dressing, but prefer to spend my fat calories on cakes and pies. So here's the variation I came up with: Used low fat mayo, good maple syrup, omitted the vinegar and sugar and substituted 1/2 cup of Girard's Fat Free Red Wine Vinaigrette for the oil. It was pink, but very tasty.

I didn't think this salad was very special. I made it using plain walnuts and afterwards realized that caramelized walnuts would have worked much better. I also don't think the dressing was great. It was OK, but I felt it was a little too sweet (and I usually like sweet salad dressings).

I make this salad tonight with Grilled Pork Tenderloin. The contrast of flavors was wonderful..the sweetness of the dressing and the tartness of the apples and dried cherries. I made glazed pecans and walnuts and it added the perfect touch.

Great salad. Try putting some goat cheese rolled in the nuts for added ingredient. I like sugared almonds instead of walnuts, too. I like the sour of the goat cheese with the sweet of the sugared almonds.

Updated previous review to say this worked surprisingly well as a quickly needed dressing for greens with strawberries, sweet onion and almonds. (previous review)Yummy, sorry to say I had to use Craisons, but will track down some dried cherries for the next time. However, the Craisons were fine. I also used slightly less oil. Delicious salad for the Perfect Pork Tenderloin on this site.

I've made this several times. There is enough dressing for two salads. I've used sunflower seeds in place of the toasted walnuts and I've use toasted pecans in place of the walnuts.

What a wonderful salad. My guests were thrilled with it. I made only one small change. I used a combination of dried fruits, such as blueberries, cranberries and cherries. The dressing was so tasty, and I was surprised the maple syrup didn't overpower it. I will make this again soon.

Excellent. Refreshing salad that compliments savory dishes as it provides some sweetness between courses. The Maple Dressing was out of this world - great combo of flavors. For those that reviewed it saying the maple was overpowered - you might want to check the vinegar you used - maybe it was too strong. I used a champagne vinegar with citrus (slight lemon trace) - also add the oil very slowly as you wisk (I use a food processor) to emulisfy the oil and vinegar. Also - I used Walnut oil instead of veggie oil. I thought the dressing flavors were very well balanced.

I've made this salad 4 times in the past 2 weeks and only get raves about it. It doesn't matter that there's too much delicious dressing because I use it for the next salad. The only change I made was dried cranberries after I ran out of dried cherries, and also used pears and apples. This salad has been devoured during the holidays when I make it. No one can quite place the dressing it seems. I feel the champagne vinegar and maple syrup complimented each other very well

Rating: 4
Excellent! The salad was simple to make: I cheated and just cut the apples up with the peels (no need to peel them), and I only used one apple. Also, instead of just cherries, I used a mixture of dried berries and cherries, which was delicious. There is definately enough dressing for two salad recipes, so just make more. My guests were very impresed with the salad and they ate every last drop. This one's a keeper!

I made this for an office party and everyone liked it a lot. I doubled the recipe but not the dressing and there was more than enough. I also used cranberries instead of cherries. One poster said the maple was overwhelmed by the vinegar. I am sure the maple is not meant to be a standout flavor so that you would recognize it. Anyone that I told that the salad had maple in it was surprised. I would make it again for a special occasion but probably not for an everyday meal.

I've made this salad many times, substituting dried cranberries for cherries, cutting the apples in small chunks (with the peels -- could I be lazier?), and using just enough dressing to lightly coat the greens. I always have more than enough dressing left over to make the salad again later in the week.

Good and colorful. However, I thought that the maple flavor was overpowered by the vinegar, but maybe it was just the vinegar I used. I doubled the salad for a single recipe of the dressing and the proportion was perfect.

This was very good. I'm not usually a "sweet" salad dressing fan, but really liked this recipe.

This salad is superb! I cut the apples ahead of time and just mixed them with some lemon juice to prevent browning. I added just a little less maple then called for - it was perfect, but it did make ALOT of dressing, I think I used about 1/3 of it - which was fine because everyone wanted me to make it again 2 days later!

The dressing is fantastic! But the salad is way too sweet for my taste. I made this for Thanksgiving (as written) and another night as an entree salad with smoked deli turkey, red onions, herb croutons and other vegetables. I thought the entree version was so much better because of the additon of more savory ingredients.

Rating: 4
Best salad recipe I've ever found ... this salad is becoming a staple at all family holidays or "events". I don't change anything in the recipe, but do agree with comments regarding too much dressing. Better to toss the salad with just enough dressing to coat the apples and prevent browning; save the rest for the dinner table but even then, pour on sparingly.

Great salad and very easy. I mixed the apple pieces and dried cheries with the dressing to keep the apples from discoloring and to soften the dried cherries. The nuts were added at the last minute when I tossed the greens with the apple mixture. The prepared salad plates were sprinkled with blue cheese and whole nuts before serving. I was able to get all the preparation done in advance which is a plus for me when entertaining. Raves for the taste too. No one could figure out what was in the dressing.

Since I first gave this a four-fork review several weeks ago, we've enjoyed this dressing many times - not only on salad of mesclun with craisins, apple and pecans, but also on any robust green salad. Also, on a hunch, tried this as a dressing for my coleslaw - excellent! Make a double recipe of the dressing to keep on hand - it keeps nicely for a week or so.,

I've made this twice now and it is very good. The first time I made it, I made the dressing as called for which is a little sweet. And, it tasted great! With this version I thought that you could easily add cooked chicken pieces for a full meal salad...I even thought that you could cut match-stick peices of cheese with it and that would taste good. The second time I made it, I made the dressing a little tart with a little extra touch of vineger...This made it taste like a "better-than" version of a Waldorf Salad and it tasted great! So, it is my opinion that this dressing lends itself to which ever mood strikes you...a little sweet or a little tart. And, I think, they are both great!

I'm a big fan of anything with pure maple syrup in it and this dressing and salad will be added to my list of favorites. I've emailed copies of this recipe to everyone that I've served it to. I left the sugar out the dressing the second time I made it and it was plenty sweet.

This was very nice. Dressing goes well with any fruit/nut/greens salad. I was out of apples---had some dried apples in the cupboard. Worked great. The walnut oil suggestion sounds really good! Being into making my own dressings (where I can pronounce all of the ingredients), this will most certainly be added.

Made exactly as is and was not disappointed. Tasted as good as it looked. The textures of the different ingredients complimented each other and the dressing was lovely.Next time will experiment with the walnut oil and add some cheese. Can't fail with this salad. It's wonderful

I made this for Christmas dinner without the cherries because my spouse stole them and put them in the stuffing. Nobody ate the stuffing. Even without the cherries the salad was a hit.

I selected this recipe on a whim and was apprehensive about the dressing (mayo and maple syrup?), but my tastebuds were wow-ed with the final product! It is absolutley fabulous! A real treat! I even used low-fat mayo and fructose instead of sugar! My sweetie and I plan on having this salad again tomorrow for dinner (topped with grilled chicken! Yum-Yum!)

Rating: 4
Delicious!!!! Well-liked even by picky children. Added blue cheese and spiced the walnuts (toast walnuts in pan, then when they are almost tosted, add a small pat of butter, a touch of brown sugar, and old bay seasoning, or any season salt to the walnuts and stir to coat). Just be careful, if everyone starts nibbling on the spiced walnuts, they may be gone before dinner. I also used balsamic vinegar to give it more of a kick. I suggest serving the dressing and ingredients in small bowls on the table, so that everyone can put the exact amount of ingredients/dressing that they like on their individual salad!

This is the best salad recipe I have ever made! My best critics are my family and they said this was by far the best salad they had ever eaten. I used cherry-flavored dried cranberries and reduced calorie mayonnaise, which eveidently did not detract from the flavor of the dressing. You will not be disappointed with this one!

Tremendous salad! The sauce was easy to make. I would cut the ingredients quantity down a bit for just two. I used cherry flavored raisins and a mix of greens and it was absolutely fabulous. My girlfriend said it was like having dessert before dinner..she could not stop eating it. The sweet taste was a perfect compliment to the Proscuitto Stuffed Pork Tenderloin with Mushroom Sauce (located on this site) which is salty in taste. Will make this again soon!

I love this salad. I use the dressing as my standard everyday - throw on the greens dressing. I mix it up and store it in the fridge to have on hand. For everyday use, I add dried cherries and walnuts to a spring mix or field greens. It is addicting. I have also tried red wine vinegar instead of white when I was out, and I liked that as well. I tend to add a little extra vinegar because I like the tang. I also use the full amount of sugar in the recipe. My sister is vegan, so we made a vegan version (nayonaise - yuck to me!)and it actually came out good for a vegan dressing.

Very impressive salad to serve guests. Instead of the sugar, I added a tablespoon of dijon mustard to the dressing which cut the sweetness and added another great layer of taste. I substituted candied/spicy pecans as I am allergic to walnuts. Delicious!

So...the salad is a good solid start. I added those big Trader Joe's raisins and some crumbled blue cheese, but the dressing is AWESOME. Following other rater's advice, I didn't add the sugar-- and you really don't need to-- the dressing in plenty sweet without it. I will definitely make the dressing again.

I have received nothing but rave reviews for this fab salad. OK, so I made some changes. But everyone I've served this to says it's the best salad they've ever had. I use baby spinach instead of mixed greens. I omit the sugar from the dressing and use walnut oil instead of the veg. oil. And I substitute honey roasted "Almond Accents" for the walnuts. And try adding fresh raspberries.

The overall concensus with my group was that this was way to sweet. While the salad was eaten- but not finished -it provided more entertainment than eating pleasure as the jokes were flying fast about my cooking. Needless to say we are a bunch of purists when it comes to salad dressings and prefer a good vinegraitte.

There's never a forkful left, even when I make it for only 4 of us. My teenager LOVE this salad. No need to peel the apples, do substitute pecans for the walnuts and don't add the sugar to the dressing - it's pleny sweet without it. The dried tart cherries called for are the best if you can find them, if not the dried cranberries work just fine. No need to use all the dressing, either.

Excellent salad. Made for 6 adults, used 8 oz of mesclun mix and 3/4 of dressing. Used dried cranberries and toasted chopped pecans as many suggested and got rave reviews. Subbed red wine vinegar as that was what was on hand and found dressing was perfectly sweet with a lovely tang at the end, would not change it. Thanks to the reviewer who suggested using the mandoline to slice the apples, it worked beautifully and made prep much easier.

I thought this was good but I didn't think there was enough maple flavor. I might up it next time since I was going with a maple theme. I subbed toasted pecans and dried cranberries.which worked very well with it. I still prefer the Waldorf Salad from Bon Appetit September 1999 (listed on epicurious) over this one, but this is very good as well...

I've made the recipe several times (without the sugar) and it's always been a hit. To balance the sweetness, add about 1 - 2 teaspoons dijon mustard and a large clove of minced garlic. Adjust to your taste. Also, try Fuji apples. When all is said and done, the salad bowl is empty.

I couldn't find dried cherries so I substituted cherry flavored dried cranberries, which worked out fine. The dressing is wonderful. I think the dressing would be great with any green salad containing fruit.

There were four of us at the dinner table tonight. The comments on the dressing were as follows: "horrible", "disgusting", "inedible", and "gross". Since the directions were clear, no skill was involved, and I didn't make substitutions, don't think I screwed it up. I'm totally perplexed....but I sure won't be making it again. (First time in my life anybody ever called something I cooked "disgusting". ewww...)

Absolutely outstanding receipe!! This salad is always a big hit any time I serve it. My husband loves it so much that he regularly whips up a batch just to have on hand.

Nice winter salad--flavors really complimented each other. Left out apples (ran out of time) and used cranberries instead of cherries. Suggest crushing nuts well, chopping up cranberries* and mixing with 1/4 cup of dressing. Add this to salad and toss to coat. Leave remainder of dressing on table for guests to add to salad as needed. *Chopping the nuts and berries into smaller pieces will make them lighter and allow them--once coated with dressing--to stick to the lettuce instead of sinking to the bottom of the salad.

I have made this salad many times and always with great results. I subsitute safflower oil and use an eggless mayo and the taste is fabulous. I always get requests for the recipe.

This was excellent. I was a little hesitant to try it when I saw mayonnaise as one of the ingredients because neither my husband nor I care for creamy dressings, but all the other ingredients sounded great so I gave it a chance. It was a top restaurant quality salad. I followed the recipe with the following minor changes: I used white balsamic vinegar instead of Champagne; Fuji instead of Granny Smith apples; and olive instead of vegetable oil. I had some dressing left over, and it was just as great two days later. I really recommend this recipe.

We're very devoted to salads in our house and rarely deviate from freshly made, simple vinaigrette of lemon, strong olive oil, & salt . But I was intrigued by this, and it was a lovely change of pace. I inadvertently forgot sugar, which was fortunate. The sweet-sour-salty blend was just right. Would not have wanted it any sweeter.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving with some misgivings...who is going to eat a healthy green salad when there are so many traditional favorites? Much to my surprise, there was none left! Wow...how did that happen. I made it again last night and brought it to daughter's house for dinner with her husband's "catch of the day"...pheasant. There was very little left again. Changes I made were minor. One pear and one apple, added some chopped celery, some finely chopped red onion and pecans instead of walnuts. For the dressing, I used raspberry vinegar and forgot to add the oil the second time I made it. It was even better. Thanks Epicurious, again, for a great dish.

This is fantastic. Caught one of my guests on Christmas night gobbling the little left in the salad bowl. Have made three times in the last month and never had any leftovers. Left out the sugar each time. P.S. Used Trader Joe's Orange Muscat Champagne Vinegar.

This salad is very delicious especially with a dry cheese. I am making it for the fourth time in a month tonight. The first night I made it with Le Guyere cheese, my favorite so far, and the second time I made it with Gouda. I have also tried it with mixed bits of fruits including berries and cherries, and on another occasion tried it with golden raisons and cherries, all with great results!

Made this for the second time, this time for my parents. My mother absconded with all the leftovers (and those of you who make this know what's left over when only four people are eating!).

The jury is still out on this one in our house. My son loved it, but he's 4. Anything with fruit and maple syrup will appeal to him. My husband politely ate about half of his. He and I agreed that it was overwhelmingly sweet. I used a smokehouse apple, reduced the amount of sugar by just a little, and used cranberries instead of cherries. I think I want to try it once more with no sugar in the dressing and a healthy dose of gorgonzola in the salad. Or not. I may just look for a better dressing.

I have already made this salad three times since my Sept 2002 Bon Appetit magazine arrived! My husband and I love it, and we have served it for informal dinner gatherings. Everyone raves! The only change I made was substituting dried cranberries for the dried cherries. The ingredient combination may sound strange, but it is a fantastic blend of flavors. - YUM! One more thing, this salad tends to get soggy quickly, so it cannot be made ahead.

Relax, Athens. Pittsburgh is kidding--he or she writes a deliberately loopy review for a lot of the recipes. (Read his/her review of the recipe for tuna with ginger-shiitake mushroom sauce.) Smile and go ahead and make the salad.

To the cook from Pittsburgh: mayo, apples, nuts and cherries are ingredients in one of the most famous American salads...Ever heard of a Waldorf salad? It seems as though your recipe of lettuce and vigegar is rather unimaginative and uninspired. Perhaps a simple palate such as yours could not appreciate a salad like this, so I will disregard your opinion and try this creative salad anyway.

Rating: 1
To me this sounded disgusting, but I decided to try it anyway. Big mistake! I've tossed quite a few salads in my day, and never, EVER, did it occur to me to use this combination of ingredients. Mayo? Apples? Nuts? Cherries? Why not just toss together some moldy crutons, cigarette butts and lemon wedges drizzled in used coffee ground vinegrette? I offered the leftovers to the homeless man that lives downstairs but he refused it. Poor man. If you really want what I call "salad," try this little recipe. Lettuce, vinegar. That's it. Best recipe for salad that I know. Sure, it's not "fancy schmansy" like one you'll fine on this web site, but it blows them all away.

Rating: 3
Loved this combination. I did feel the dressing was a little sweet so if I was to make it again I wouldn't use any sugar. I'm not a fan of salad dressing and feel this salad would be just as good with some lemon or orange juice and some olive oil. I used pomegranate seeds instead of dried cherries since I had some leftover. I also didn't peel the apple - why lose the fiber by peeling it? My mother in law gave us some fresh greens from her garden which were perfect for this salad. Can't wait to have it again!

Simple and lovely, this salad really dressed up our leftover lasagna dinner tonight. Hubby LOVED it and it was a snap to put together, as well. I used prechopped pecans and dried cranberries because the cherries looked kind of mushy and not as pretty. This would be a great dish to take to any get together at any time of the year as the ingredients are always available. YUM!!!! Make this salad.

I can't wait to make this one again. It was decicious and very trendy looking without being wierd. I had a hard time finding dried tart cherries so I used "cranberry raisins" that now come flavoured (cherry, orange etc) - they worked great.

The dressing was good and I will make it again, but I think it would go better with a different mix than this recipe calls for. I think the dressing would give quite a lift to a regular mixed greens salad, even. It's really neat how the dressing tastes better with each bite!

Bought a bag of mixed greens and this whipped up so easily. Used Craisins instead of dried cherries. Will be making this for a recipe exchange on Thursday. Perfect fall salad.

Yummy! Made it with the Poblano Corn Chowder With Shrimp recipe from Epicurious for a spicy and sweet combination.
