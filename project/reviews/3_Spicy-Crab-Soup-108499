This turned out really good in the end, but needed modification. I used frozen crab claws, because as the first reviewer said, the amount of crab it called for would be super expensive. Because I didn't use whole crab, I used Swanson's vegetable stock base. I also found that as is it was seriously lacking in seasoning so I added chile powder, creole seasoning and cilantro. I also used ground blue corn chips in place of the blended tortillas. Otherwise I followed the recipe. With these modifications it turned out really well. Use whole crabs if you can afford it!

I would say 2.5 forks, but it depends on what you like. It tastes like a manhattan chowder with crab. Here that much whole crab would cost $50. I simply bought a can of fresh claw meat and turned it into a 10 dinner. A nice heat and semi-satisfying I'm glad I made us a couple seared tuna nachos for apps.
