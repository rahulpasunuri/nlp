This was excellent! Instead of the pastry crust, I used the gingersnap crust recipe for Pumpkin Cheesecake with Marshmallow Sour Cream topping - on this site. It was truly delicious.

i love how easy this recipe is, but the first time I made it, the amount of spice and vanilla obscured the nice flavor of sweet potatos fresh from the garden. The second time, I only added some cinnamon for depth and no vanilla. Much better!

This was a winner and in fact will be making this recipe again for Christmas! I followed the directions but in lieu of whole milk I used 2% and also added chopped pecans...easy and so good! (Even the next day for breakfast with a cup of coffee)

I realized at the last minute that I didn't have any unsalted butter, and I subbed in organic sugar and dark spiced rum. It turned out not to be too sweet, and was a big hit this Thanksgiving.

Excellent pie. Made filling exactly as written.

I really enjoyed this. The feeling was smooth and sweet, but not overly sugary. When making it I substituted a clear rum since that one was a better quality than the dark rum I had on hand, and reduced the nutmeg by half since for me it's a very strong spice. Next time I might substitute some brown sugar or honey or add a bit of maple flavoring to elevate the flavor, but this is a good basic recipe.

I have never liked sweet potatos or candied yams for a side dish, so I was reluctant to attempt a sweet potato pie...but the rum intrigued me and made me choose this particular recipe. Couldn't have made a better choice! Now I have one more pie to add to my Thanksgiving arsenal.

This pie recipe was a big hit. I ended up making it three times over the holiday and already have requests for next year. Like some of the other reviewers I did not have dark rum so I did not include it. I also made my own substitution of heavy cream instead of whole milk. After using a whisk attachment on my hand mixer the pie filling was not very liquid at all and the pie came out very smooth. I have made this pie with garnet yams and with beauregard yams. The beauregard yams were a little more tasty and yielded an even smoother pie but both types of yams are acceptable.

Made for Thanksgiving and was very good but not great. I have other recipes that are better.

Suffice it to say, everyone gushed over this pie at Thanksgiving. Making it again today for a holiday party at work. DELICIOUS!!!

A Thanksgiving HIT! The rum is a very fine touch, especially if you splash in some extra. I also added a bit more vanilla and cinnamon. Cooking times were accurate. I used a Keebler Shortbread Ready Crust and it tasted deliciously homemade!

Great recipe - we left out the flour & cinnamon & added 1/2 t freshly zested lemon peel. Thank you for NOT advocating canned sweet potatoes (they are simply the worst)!

Made it last minute today and used a deep dish pan that was able to contain all the filling...it needed a little longer baking time. Overall we enjoyed it more than pumpkin pie; the texture was lighter (less dense) than pumpkin, and the recipe had just the right amount of sweetness.

Lovely pie! I made this for a dinner group and it was a hit. Simple to make (loved the immersion blender suggestion) and delicious. I used yams instead of sweet potatoes, as I prefer the darker color, but otherwise followed the recipe pretty closely. Other than a crack easily covered with whipped cream, it came out perfectly.

This was delicious. I left out the rum because I did not have any on hand. I will definately make over and over again.

Lighter in color and fluffier than some sweet potato pies I've had. But great texture and absolutely delicious. We started the potatoes in a cold oven and slow roasted them at 325 so they developed a lot of maltose.

I served this over Thanksgiving at my in-laws to a houseful of people who'd never had sweet potato pie, and everyone thinks I'm a genius. My family is from the South and I was worried that this wouldn't live up to what I'd grown up with, but it's wonderful.

just housed my second piece...the immersion blender was aces, though I wish I had made a pastry crust instead of a graham cracker...

I made this for a dinner party. It really is a lovely and simple pie. I was hesitant at first that the recipe called for too few sweet potatoes, but once I mixed everything together the amount was perfect. I did use goat butter rather than cow's butter, which I think made the pie have an exceptional richness.

I made a graham cracker and pecan crust for this and omitted the rum. It was very tasty. It's quite creamy (I used an immersion blender on the potatoes/sugar/butter) and well seasoned. And at 400 degrees, the bake time in my oven was right on. I took it out when it still had the slightest wabble in the middle so it didn't dry out. The crust may have made the pie: 1 cup graham cracker crumbs, 2/3 cup pecans blitzed into sand, 1/4 cup sugar, 1/2 stick melted butter (press it into the pie dish and bake at 350 for ten minutes) was delicious with this. And so easy I can't imagine buying a pre-made one.

I forgot to put the flour in but pie was really excellent anyway. The best sweet-potato pie I've ever made.

I doubled the recipe to fill my extra-deep pie dish, and as you might expect, it took almost twice as long to bake. But it was delicious and even baked without cracking on the top. It was a hit with my guests!

First time making a sweet potato pie - I followed the recipe exactly, using a frozen crust from Whole Foods and light rum instead of dark (which I didn't have). I served it at an office holiday party. Most people liked it, but no particularly rave reviews. I'd probably make it again for a Thanksgiving/holiday party, perhaps with a different brand crust.

This recipe was great, the pie filling had a perfect balance of flavors - not too sweety, not too anything. just perfect! and so easy to make! I ended up baking it for half the time, but that could just be my oven. I would just advise watching the time!

I make this pie every Thanksgiving and it is always a hit! Usually, I leave out the rum and I candy the potatoes. Other than that, I follow the recipe and it always comes out great. Delicious!!

Great simple recipe. We love it.

Fantastic. I increased the amount of vanilla and also used double strength vanilla so you could taste the vanilla. I substituted Barenjager (honey liquor)for the rum. I think rum would also be excellent. I omitted the flour. I used a Wegman's refrigerated pie crust. I baked it in a stone pie dish. It took much longer to bake than in the recipe. Not sure if it was the stone or the oven temp. I removed it as soon as a knife in the center came out clean. I will definately make this again and again. Everyone liked it!

Pie was very easy to make and taste and texture were as they should be. I didn't have milk and substituted whipping cream. Also added 1/4 tsp white pepper.

Excellent. Used Captain Morgan's Spiced Rum, brown sugar, cinnamon et al. Crushed pecans first & sprinkled on top, used Carnation evaporated milk. You have to serve pie warm only. Cold is not the same texture. Great Thanksgiving or anytime side dish. So good you can serve it warm with whipped cream as desert. Used ready made pie shells from store, fine.

This was delicious even though I forgot the vanilla. I added a praline topping of chopped pecans, butter, brown sugar, cinnamon and salt before baking.

NOM NOM NOM. This was delicious. The only changed I made was using brown sugar since I didn't have white sugar on hand. Oh and I forgot the flour. Oops. Still came out great. I tried this with a homemade orange zest crust. The orange zest really compliments the filling!!

This sweet potato pie was great. One thing I did add extra was some apple butter. Not too much. I also sprinkled some walnuts over the top. Serve this warm with Hagen Daz icecream and a bit of whip cream and you are good to go. Great addition to a classic recipe in my kitchen.

I thought this was a great pie. Only had low fat evap milk in cupboard. Used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white and pumped up the spices. Turned out great and easy!

Delicious. A good way to use up leftover baked sweet potatoes.

I, too, had to add extra spice to give it extra zing, and used Pet milk. Never having made one before yet being an experienced baker, I can say this pie is fantastic! It exactly settled when cool to the top of the crust and was a thick, creamy texture. Delightful!

This was really good and really easy to make. Used bourbon instead of the rum. Perfect with whip cream and a cup of coffee

The recipe for the filling of the pie was delicious. I discovered that I had to modify the cooking time for the pie. I added and additional 10-12 minutes at a slightly higher tempature (around 400), the suggested 40 minutes of cooking time wasn't even close. I also used this recipe with a simple pie crust 101 recipe, and it was delicious. My guests loved it!

This makes a great pie with things already in my pantry. I didn't have rum and so put about .5 tsp of lemon extract in as suggested. I didn't really notice it but my sister specifically asked if I had used it. I would certainly make this again.

This is a lovely sweet potato pie recipe. I made it last Thanksgiving and it was just great. Someone else brought a sweet potato pie but this went much faster. I doubled the cinnamon and nutmeg to give more flavor.

Great and simple recipe. I made a homemade pie crust to go along with it, and I used Cognac instead of Brandy as I did not have any on hand. Also used a half cup of sugar and evaporated milk as well. Used only one big sweet potato and it filled a regular dish pie crust. Overall pretty good recipe. Everyone liked it!

Instead of whole milk I use Pet milk and 3 tablespoon of Brandy and the pie was wonderful.

The is not too bad....but the rum gave it an unpleasent flavor...! I never tried to make this type of pie without brown sugar, I think in this case brown sugar was the missing factor.

Liked it, didn't love it...but then again, I'm not a huge Sweet Potato fan, like my hubby. Very easy to assemble. Only changes were a graham cracker crust instead of pastry. Forgot to add the 1T of flour, which didn't occur to me until I went to remove the pie from the oven! I left it in an additional 15 minutes to compensate. The pie has a lovely creamy texture although I found the rum came through awfully strong. (I used Extra Old Barbados rum, 86 proof!!). Next time, I'd leave it out or use only half a T. All-in-all, worth the effort!

I had never made sweet potato pie before and was a little worried that this recipe didn't call for any brown sugar when all the others I reveiwed did. The pie turned out beautifully though, and tasted just as good as any store bought version I've ever had. My only tip...make sure you buy DEEP DISH pie shells if you're not a crust expert (like me!)

We did a taste test on Thanksgiving -- pumpkin vs. sweet potato and this pie won hands down. This was REALLY good!

YUM! I made it with amaretto instead of rum, and I put marshmallows on top for the last 5-10 minutes. It was a big hit at Thanksgiving, but I don't think we'll wait that long to make it again.

Just a question: Did you pile the marshmallows on top before or after baking?????????????

Incredible recipe. I doubled the rum and piled marshmallows on top. Fantastic dish. I baked it one day in advance and then let it sit on the bottom of the oven for thirty minutes while I was the ham & turkey were in the oven. Delicious.

I've never had sweet potato pie before. I did forget the vanilla and deliberately did not add the rum, so perhaps that would have made it better. I think I prefer pumpkin pie, but it was a nice way to use up some sweet potatoes from our garden

I hate when people alter recipes so that they are not even recognizable anymore. That being said, I did make one change. I use lemon extract instead of rum. It doesn't end up tasting like lemon, but it adds a flavor that is really good and people sit there trying to figure out what it is that makes it that good

This is a really good pie. Gives you that feeling of fall. The only thing I changed was, I used a graham cracker crust. Big hit with everyone.

This was delicious and easy to make. Next time I am going to reduce the amount of rum because it was a tad bit overpowering. I sprinkled a brown sugar, butter, cornflake and pecan mixture over the top for a sweet and crunchy topping.

I have never had this type of pie before, but it was delicious. I added toasted pecans to the bottom of the pie crust before pouring in the filling; then after I poured in my filling I topped it with two tablespoons of melted butter so the pie would have a sheen to it when it came out of the oven. It looked great as well as tasting wonderful!

I've never had sweet potato pie before so I have no basis for comparison. I thought, however, that this was very good. I substituted 1/2 tsp. rum flavoring + a little more milk for the rum. I don't know if this dramatically changed the flavor from what it should have been but I liked the results, in any case.

Having a southern mother and having lived for awhile in the south I have eaten my share of sweet potato pies...this was the best. They are usually heavy in nature but this one was light and delicate. Don't know if it was Reichl's recipe or my homegrown sweet potatoes (my first attempt at growing them), maybe a little of both.
