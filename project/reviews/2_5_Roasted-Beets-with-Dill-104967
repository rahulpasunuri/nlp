This is a delicious and attractive dish. Less butter is better.

I cooked this with red, white, and yellow beets and it not only tasted great, but looked fantastic. Not sure you need all that butter. I used about half what was called for.

This was quick (once the beets were roasted) and easy to prepare, and very good. A nice variation is to steam some of the beet greens and add them in as well.

I found that the lemon brought out a bitter taste in the beets.

I like beets and this sounds easy and good, but it's not fettucine with proscuitto, asparagus, etc.
