I have made this twice, both times to rave reviews. I found the Praline Brittle a bit rough on the teeth so the second time just used plain pistachios and it was good. I'm planning to make Christmas cookies with this recipe forming the meringues into little cookies and piping the buttercream on the meringues and sprinkle some pistachios and maybe edible gold and finely minced sweetened cranberries on top.

If you don't like sweet--SWEET--cakes, stay away. If you do, this is it. . .the memory of the lemon, cream, and meringue lingers for a long, long time (and this torte is heaven apres party with a nice cup of coffee). Yes, I heartily recommend it!

I have made a similar lemon/meringue cake from this site that must be kept frozen and it is much better than this one. The meringues were too heavy, tough and chewy -- too much sugar. The buttercream was OK, not outstanding -- I wouldn't make part or all of it again.

This recipe makes 3 meringue layers but only appears to use 2. What do you do with the third meringue?

Although meringue in the humid south is hard to master, leaving the meringue layers in a closed oven overnight helped to ensure they were dry. The buttercream is some of the lightest I've made and is a perfect compliment to the light meringue layers. I took the advice of the other reviewers and increased the recipes for the praline and buttercream--glad I did. I found that cutting the cake when cool was much easier than letting it soften too much. Some guests couldn't get enough of this one; others thought it was extremely rich--more like candy than cake. This is definitely a dessert for a special occasion. I served it with rasberry sauce for a color contrast.

One of the best cakes I've ever made! The meringue layers take a little time to get right but the effort is worth it. The layers are nutty, crisp and chewy and they contrast amazingly well with the tart and creamy taste and texture of the rich buttercream. Definitely double the amount of praline you make and cover the cake with it lavishly-the pistachio flavor is classic with the light and refreshing lemon of the frosting. And do let it warm up a bit before serving. A beautiful and luscious dessert!

Hands down the best dessert I have ever made OR eaten. If you eat this at my house, you know I really love you because it is so much work- but so rewarding when you hear people begging for the recipe. I freely give it out knowing it won't show up at many parties because people are intimidated by all the instructions! The best!!

THIS RECIPE WAS VERY WELL RECEIVED WHEN FEATURED ON MY MONTHLY DESSERT MENU AT PANACHE RESTAURANT IN ZIONSVILLE, IN. THE COMBINATION OF FLAVORS AND TEXTURES IS DELICIOUS. IN ORDER TO COVER THE SIDES AND TOP WITH BUTTERCREAM THICKLY FOR THE PRALINE TO ADHERE, INCREASE BUTTERCREAM BY HALF.
