you can replace the shitaki and white caps with morrels and the wonderful corn fungus mushrooms which come in blue or yellowish white depending what type of corn it has grown on.

I made these for a Day of the Dead feast and they were delicious, and not too hard. My masa mixture never really formed a 'smooth paste', it was more of a crumbly texture, but smoothed out when packed together. The flavor was great and a little fire roasted salsa and crema made it even better.

We LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe. since the first time i made it, nov '04, my family has requested it at every holiday since. it is time consuming, but it also freezes well, make a double batch. local mushrooms from the farmers market are a great option. great for breakfast with eggs, lunch or dinner, or a snack.

Tripled the recipie for a very large dinner party (22 people...4 words - chafing dish steamer insert). My first time making tamales. Was a little intimadated at first but these were easy and excellent! Spreading is overated. Made them in advance and froze them. Plated them opened and topped with "my mole sauce" w/shredded chicken for the meat eaters. Served with a 4-star black bean and corn salad from Cooking Light. RAVE reviews! People came back for seconds and requested the leftovers to take home. The only thing I would note is that a 3 tablespoon portion per tamale is rediculous. We started making them with a quarter cup scoop and frankly that was still a little skimpy so we upped the ante again. Did not tie them but left enough husk to fold over for a neat little package. Yummy. Will make again... and again.

Tamales are traditionally a team effort, so recruit some help and it will go faster. We purchased a mix of fresh mushrooms at the farmer's market and decided to make these. They were a hit and I will be making them again. Great Christmas gift for your vegetarian friends as they freeze well.

I will be making this again, very soon. topped with a touch of fresh salsa, these are wonderful! Great to make with others, as the group effort made things go much more smoothly and quickly.

This was also my first time making tamales, and although the whole process of assembling the tamales took some time, it wasn't difficult. We found the filling a bit bland before cooking - it needed more salt, pepper, a bit of chili powder, cumin, etc. They turned out great!! In the future, I may substitute some of the shrooms for some steamed butternut squash in place of some of the butter to reduce the fat.

This was delicious! We will definitely make again. Great to freeze ahead and have handy.

This was our first time making tamales. They weren't nearly as hard to make as we thought. Very tasty. We'll make this again soon.
