In a word - AMAZING!! So delicious & really easy to make. I substituted apple cider for the orange juice (& omitted the zest), as we had an allergy to contend with & they came out beautifully. The rum really takes these to another level (used Capt. Morgan's Spiced Rum). RUN, do not walk to your kitchen & make a batch of these!! A real KEEPER!! ONE NOTE: the pan size is an odd size, so I doubled the recipe & baked it in a Jelly Roll pan.

This is a quick, simple and easy recipe that gives you an excellent dessert. The final result is a short bread-like bottom covered with a fig puree, topped with short bread crumbles. They are excellent with milk, coffee or tea. I had to stew the figs with the OJ and rum, as my dried figs would not process into a coarse paste. These are dried figs from my fig tree and were just too firm. Next time, I'll soak the figs in the OJ and rum in order to soften them before processing.
