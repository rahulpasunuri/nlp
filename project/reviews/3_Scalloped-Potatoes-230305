I was so happy to find this recipe - 3 of us in my family can't have dairy. I understand what someone was saying about it being a little bland though. I thought that might be the case from looking at the recipe. I added some chopped scallions, and chopped proscuitto. My family loved it! But I don't think I would make it plain - definitely add something like the above. Also when I made it, I doubled it and froze one, which froze well.

This dish had no flavor and although I may have sliced the potatoes too thick, it took almost twice the baking time for it to be done. I will not spend the time/energy on this recipe again!

Was looking for an easy potato dish and came across this recipe. Read the reviews and decided to make a few changes. The end result was delicious! Substituted the rice milk for 1 cup of 2% milk and 1 cup of chicken stock. Also added some parmesean to the milk mixture and sprinkled a little parmesean on the potatos before putting in the oven. Baked for 30 minutes instead of the recommended 20. Turned out great!!!

terrible. bland and tasteless. i'm all for healthy alternatives - and the skim milk and lack of cheese is what drew me to this recipe - but there was really nothing to it.

I followed the recipe precisely and the end result was half-cooked potatoes and lots of leftover liquid. Didn't really care for the taste of the liquid, either. The first problem could be the type of potatoes I used (russets aren't sold in Belgium) but even aside from the half-raw potatoes, my family just didn't care for the taste of this dish.

As a twist to the traditional Christmas meal, I made this delicious dish. All of the guests raved about it, and I will make it again! Excellent

Best scalloped potatoes I've had. I used small white potatoes rather than russet, added a 1/4 tsp of cayenne to "enhance" flavor (not enough to change flavor), increased oven temp to 425 degrees and covered with foil.

I had high hopes based on the other reviews, and was a little disappointed. I agree that it took FAR longer than the recipe calls for (oven for 30 minutes, then had to microwave it for almost 10 minutes because everything else was ready). Will try it again with some additions (ham and peas do sound like a good suggestion) as I found it rather boring.

This was excellent and with skim milk even! -- Wow! I cut back on the potatoes and added diced leftover ham and frozen peas. I also upped amount of the roasted garlic -- about 5 mashed cloves. I had to bake it much longer (about 45 minutes) but once I added a cover it baked very quickly. Excellent and both it and the roasted garlic made the house smell divine!

I did not have almonds, so I used 1 tbsp of almond butter. This is the best scalloped potatoe recipe I have made. The nutmeg and almond flavor is wonderful. I serve this with a buffalo garlic sausage. It's so quick and easy!!!!
