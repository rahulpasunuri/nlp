Loved this! Used one can of Ro-Tel instead of the crushed tomatos and chipotle chilies. Also used fresh Maine shrimp. Definitely going to be a staple in our house!

I have been making this recipe since it was first published in Bon Appetit in 2000. It is always delicious and a great favorite with others. In fact, it is one of the recipes I give out frequently. Works in crock pot, substituting chicken for the shrimp, store-bought tortilla chips, addition of other vegetables, vegan substitutions, and a multitude of other variations. Great flavor and spiciness and so satisfying.

Every time I serve this recipe, people rave about it, and think you've spent hours in the kitchen. I love the fact that you can throw it together in no time.

LOVED this recipe! Soooo easy and tasty. I substituted zucchini for celery and topped it with avocado. Easily one of the best soups Ive made.

I would definitely try this again. We liked the garlicky spiciness and the shrimp. Next time I will add more tomatoes, corn instead of hominy, and shredded chicken in place of the shrimp. This is a really simple and tasty soup that is easy to play around with.

Easy to make and delicious. Added avocado and used tortilla chips instead of making the strips. Had plenty of leftovers, too!

This recipe is delicious! I made some last night and my friend and me had two servings each. I added slices of avocado to my bowl, which made it even more delicious. I also used fire roasted diced tomatoes because that is what I had. Next time I think I will put more tomatoes and cilantro in it.

I just finished my first bowl of this and I am very impressed! It's delicious and so colorful! I added a bit of queso fresco, crumbled on top and diced avocado to my bowl. I'll freeze the rest and maybe add some shredded chicken next time.

Wow, this recipe deserves 5 stars!! We used 8 tortillas, brushed them lightly with oil, sprinkled with kosher salt and lime zest, broiled until crisp. Also doubled the celery and carrots, and used 1 14oz can of diced tomatoes. Best Mexican soup ever.

I absolutely love this recipe. This soup is definitely more than the sum of its parts. I make double batches and freeze it (without the shrimp) in portions for two. After warming, I simply add a bit of extra fresh, chopped cilantro along with the shrimp. Instant comfort food!

Extremely easy and incredibly delicious. Satisfies all my mexican food cravings in a single bowl. I serve mine with slices of avocado and crumbled cheese, the way I've had it in Mexico.

Exceptional it is. I have been looking for years for THE torilla soup recipe. This is it. As a previous reviewer stated, I prefer thicker soup. In stead of the crushed tomatoes, I added a 6oz can of tomato paste. Worked for me.

This recipe was tasty and simple to make. I was out of chipotle so I used smoked paprika and a touch of cayenne powder. That worked great! I also substituted diced green bell pepper for the celery, white hominy for golden hominy, left out the carrots, and subbed veggie broth for chicken. (I was making this on the fly and had to use what was in my kitchen--also, I don't eat poultry, anyway.) The recipe was still delicious. It's not blowing anyone away, but it's lovely for a winter evening and the hominy makes it something a little different from the usual.

this is a wonderful and easy soup. worked beautifully with thawed frozen shrimp. will definitely make again!

This has become a staple for quick, delicious soup. I now use the following changes -- pinto beans rather than hominy; sub 2-3 dried whole chipotle peppers, cooked in the soup, for chiles in adobe; added 1/2 a red bell pepper & green bell pepper, diced; 1/2 c frozen corn, and used my own stock, and add 2 lbs of beautiful Maine shrinp, yum. I adjust heat at the end with red pepper flakes. In the summer I add garden tomatoes, and always serve with avocado and lime wedges. Blue corn chips in place of tortilla strips are a colorful touch.

Very good. Would make again. Enough spice, relatively easy to make. Warms you up so great for rainy days.

This soup is fabulous! I made it with chicken instead of shrimp and my family loved it: it freezes well!

Wow! This is a good soup, different from the tortilla soup we have been making, but still spicy and mello. And it fits in with a WW diet very nicely. Used homemade chicken stock, made sure all seeds were out of the chipotle peppers, substituted Italian canned tomatoes + tomato bouillon cubes, 1/2 hominy. Thanks

This was such a flavorful, spicy soup! Instead of the hominy and shrimp, I added a whole small smoked chicken (w/o skin) and some dry roasted, fresh corn. I also dry roasted the onion and garlic before adding to the oil (this really adds to the "smokiness" theme of this soup). And finally, I used fresh roma tomatoes and added 2 tablespoons of the adobo sauce. I followed the readers suggestions and baked the tortillas and then sprinkled w/ a little kosher salt and lime juice. Yum!!!

I feel like a freak! I was so disappointed by this soup, and after reading all the wonderful reviews, I am wondering what I may have done wrong. The only different thing I did was use white hominy instead of golden. I found it lacking in body and kind of thin. If I make it again, I'll take some of the suggestions about adding fresh corn and tomatoes and see if that helps. I did find the soup better with some lime juice squeezed into each serving.

I made the recipe one time before and all loved it. I'm making it again for a Hal. party tommorow. I loved the suggestions a few of the other reviewers had, i.e. use fresh corn, add fresh tomato. I'm sure it will be an improvement! I also use homemade chicken stock. Just boil a chicken for an hour with 2 quarts water, 4 cloves garlic, little green pepper, a few celery stocks, a chopped tomato and onion, 2 tsps salt, 1 tsps ground comino, pepper to taste.

This soup is wonderful!! I made it just as the recipe suggested and it was delicious. The combination of textures really makes this dish a wonderful meal. Also, the cilantro and lime juice added at the end give it a nice zest. Will become a standard soup in my kitchen!

i have also made this with chicken or shrimp - both good! i baked the tortillas until crisp -sprayed with oil and sprinkled with salt and chili powder - yum! garnish with avocado slices and lime wedges, this is so good!

This soup was absolutely perfect / casually elegant. Nice spice, original flavor, not overwhelming. I live in the south, the hominy grits are a nice combination with the shrimp. Don't over do it though. Also, I mixed white and yellow hominy grits (more color) and used more chopped tomatoes than called for. As usual, this soup must have lime added right before eating. Really critical. And, of course, I used regular store bought tortilla chips, but sparingly.

Rating: 3
I thought this was a tasty, healthy soup. My husband enjoyed it very much, but he's not a real shrimp fan, and would have preferred it with chicken instead. I'd never had hominy before and I liked it, but didn't love it. Next time I'd probably use fresh corn instead, but if you like hominy it will be great!

Rating: 4
This soup was outstanding. I doubled it to make it for company and everyone raved. I did add avocado on top like another reviewer suggested which tasted great. It has a wonderful flavor. I made it with Bon Appetite's Basil, Red Pepper and Montery Jack corn bread which was also outstanding. I will definately make this again.

Great, great soup. So easy to make. Just finely chop all the vegetables and garlic in processor. Diced avocado on top is a nice touch. I serve it with a small cheese quesadilla along side.

Rating: 4
Really yummy. Different. I'm sure that you could use chicken without much loss, but the shrimp was great in it. Used the white hominy as recommended by previous reviewers and thought it was a good call. The only issue I have is that its a pain to finely chop the carrots - is there some easy way to do this? It was the only time consuming part of this recipe.

This was the first really different soup we've had in a long time. It was excellent. Next time we might try garnishing it with diced avocado and tomato.

have been meaning to try this one for awhile but never think to buy shrimp when i'm out shopping...now i have a terrible cold and since i had everything this recipe called for but the shrimp...i used chicken...i needed chicken soup anyway...and let me tell ya...i doubled the chiles used white AND yellow hominy too and besides the fact that it was easy to make (especially trying to make it when you're sick) AND that it was delicious and really hit the spot on this colder than usual day... the best part is that IT CLEARED MY HEAD COMPLETELY AND I CAN FINALLY BREATHE AGAIN!!! I'll be nibbling and slurping on this for the next 2 or 3 days!!!

Really good soup. I reserved some soup w/ out the peppers for our younger kids. We loved it. Also added some avocado at the end with the cilantro, lime and tortillas (I baked them as well.) this is hearty enough to be considered a full meal- I made some grilled cheese on the side, great fall dinner. Really easy to make and fast.

WOW. THIS WAS GREAT. IT WAS DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER SOUP I HAVE MADE. I USED WHITE HOMINY. I MADE CORNBREAD FOR THE SIDE, BUT I KEPT THINKING THERE IS PROBABLY SOMETHING MORE INTERESTING TO SERVE! IF THIS TO SERVE 10,I WILL HAVE TO HAVE 6 MORE PEOPLE OVER. BEACAUSE IT IS GONE!

This is a surprisingly tasty soup and so easy to make! Next time, I'll definitely toast or bake the tortilla strips - air drying left them chewy and lifeless.

I have two picky girls so I substituted chicken for the shrimp and simmered it for a long while. While it was still on the spicy side for them my husband and I loved it. I told the girls I would use less chipotles next time which got the thumbs up. The tortilla strips were yummy! I oiled, salted and then baked them well ahead of the soup. We ate those and had to make more for dinner.

i love this recipe and will definitely be adding it to my collection of recipes to make again. i agree with the comments on white vs golden hominy, and i served with cornbread as well. this recipe is very visually appealing, and substituting blue corn tortilla strips instead of regular corn added even more.

My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this soup. I can't wait to make it again. I also broiled the corn tortillas that I brushed with olive oil, kosher salt and lime juice. Yummy!

A fantastic soup and so easy to make! It has become a favorite of mine. I added a slice of avocado to each bowl when serving. Passed it on to my daughter and she and her husband have made it several times. I have served it once with a salad and again with corn quesadillas. The soup alone is a treat for dinner.

I made this for the first time for a dinner party and we all thought this soup was awesome. My hubby was still talking about it the next day! I used more chipotle peppers than called for also, and I definately recommend that little squeeze of fresh lime at the table, really brightened the flavor! I've made this soup twice. Once using the golden hominy and once using the white. I have to agree with the other rating, we like it with the white hominy better. The white has a more distictive "mexican" flavor. When making this dish again, I'll use the white. It seems to be easier to find also. The idea of baking the tortilla strips is a good one, I air-dried mine and they seemed a bit chewy. We served with guacamole & chips, Pillsbury cornbread sticks and cold Mexican beer, yum!

This soup was wonderful! I did use white hominy instead of golden hominy; I personally like the taste better. I also used 2 tbs. of chipotle instead of 2 tsp. I like it spicy. I also toasted the tortilla's in the oven at 300 degrees while the soup was cooking instead of letting the tortillas dry overnight.
