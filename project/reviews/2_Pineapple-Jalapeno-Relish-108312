The only pineapples that seem to be available in the market these days are the extra-sweet "gold" variety, so I left out the sugar. The relish was good--refreshing, colorful, and a bright contrast to the grilled sausage I served it with.

Simple and refreshing but my jalapenos weren't hot at all. I'll have to make it again with a hotter pepper.
