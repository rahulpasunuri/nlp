Worked pretty well with ling cod as well. Maybe I should have thickened the balsamic more, though, since the fish I used was pretty watery.

Very tasty. I made the tilapia and sauce with green beans and couscous. I added thyme to the couscous, and it really pulled it together.

Wow, what an incredibly simple recipe, but what outstanding results. Even my almost 3 year old really enjoyed this dish. I didn't have enough snap peas at home, so I used some mixed veggies instead that included snap peas, broccoli, and carrots, which worked out quite well.

I tend to rate the Epicurious recipes in lockstep with the majority opinion. When the majority says its great I tend to agree. Not this time. I only made the tilapia and it was as disappointing a meal as I've had in a long time. Afterwards I threw away the sauce and will turn the cooked tilapia into fish tacos.

Easy and delicious! The sauce would be great on a stuffed chicken as well. I did not have potatoes so I made a wile rice and added the thyme. Easy and very yummy!

The sauce is excellent. I added a bit of ginger with the garlic. I served the tilapia with sauteed onions and mushrooms on top, then spooned the sauce over. We had brown rice and a medley of mixed fresh steamed vegetables. Absolutely gorgeous!

This recipe takes a simple fish like tilapia and makes it extraordinary. It is quick and easy and delicious. I only made one adjustment--I used 2 pouches or dry mashed potatoes, eliminated the milk and margarine and added the whipping cream, butter, and thyme. They were outstanding. Again, something simple turned into something wonderful. The sugar snap peas were really a nice addition to this recipe. The Balsamic butter sauce added the perfect finishing touch. Wonderful meal.

My husband and I loved this tilapia recipe! However, I only used half the butter and melted it all at once in large chunks, melting it very slowly. I also made my own chunky red potato recipe and served it with asparagus. The sauce was amazing on the tilapia and potatoes. Will definitely make again.

Rating: 2
I dont think this is as easy as it sounds. whisking in small pats of butter and waiting for each one to melt before adding the next is quite time consuming. and even with a watchful eye, my sauce broke! taste was eh. Not worth the effort. also fish probably needed a coating of flour - didnt nicely brown with just salt and pep. wont be making again.

This was delicious! All of my kids loved it and they are picky eaters! Instead of peas I steamed spinach and poured the glaze on that which was delicious. The tilapia with the glaze was also delicious; next time I will probably decrease the amount of butter though. A quick, easy, and delicious meal!

Well, I had high hopes for this recipe and I just don't get it? I usually love the recipes, but this one we will not be eating again. The sauce was seriously just butter (and I only used 3/4 of what it called for) with a slight taste of balsamic. Potatoes were fair (but I will admit I don't always love thyme). Regardless, it was certainly easy to make, but I will pick something else next time.

We took a chance and made this for the first time when we had visitors. The only change we made was to reduce the amount of butter in the balsamic sauce to 2 tbsp. Everyone agreed: it was delicious. And quick and easy too. We will make this again.

wowowow - that was good! I made mashed potatoes with small red potatoes. No sugar snap peas, so we had green beans. The tilapia was fantastic. I often avoid cooking fish because I feel like I need to do a lot of fancy acrobatics to make it good. A little salt and pepper, sauteed in olive oil, add a great simple sauce and we're golden! The sauce, of course, is the star of this meal. It was really easy to make. I made a double recipe of it but used less than half of the butter called for in the straight recipe. The butter really makes it luscious and wonderful, but tasting as I went allowed me to use much less. One warning though - The sauce smells very, very strong while reducing. Open a window and turn on the fan because it will make your eyes water. My husband screwed up his face and said, "WHAT are you cooking? That smells awful!" But he loved the end result! :-)

Delicious and easy. And healthier if you make with roasted red skins tossed in salt, pepper and thyme. I will try next time with less butter in the sauce - great idea! I had to broil my tilapia but it turned out great and no messy stove.

I also did not add nearly so much butter and the sauce was excellent!

Rating: 4
Well, my family gave me a perfect 10 for this recipe! I improvised a bit with the potatoes, leaving the skin on and mixing in lemon thyme and basil from our garden. I had a zucchini from our garden as well, so I sauteed that instead of using snow peas. The sauce is the reason for all the high marks this recipe gets... It could go on anything and make it taste delicious. In fact, I had a bit of the sauce left over, and added it to a soup I was making--it added richness and intense flavor! Four forks for the sauce.

This was so good! I went looking for recipes for ideas after I already planned to have tilapia and potatoes for dinner with fresh green beans. When I found this, I decided to try it since I had everything else in the kitchen. It turned out so well! Everyone loved it! I will make this again.

This is an excellent recipe!! I have made it in the past, but I when I prepared it a couple of nights ago I made it without the butter by mistake - I just forgot to add it in.

Made this for dinner last night. As other reviewers stated, it's easy, quick and delicious. For the fish, I used orange roughy and it was quite good with the balsamic mixture.

This is one of those perfect recipes that takes 10 minutes but you can feel confident serving to guests. The balsamic sauce is as concentrated and intense as you want to make it, depending on how much butter you want to add. Just make sure to keep it warm so that it flows.

This is a great, easy recipe! I'd recommend it to novice cooks who want to impress a date. Whether you have any experience cooking or not, it comes out lovely--way more impressive than a grilled cheese sandwich, and cheaper than taking your date out to dinner! My friend Chris rarely cooks. He had a bag of frozen Tilapia from Costco so I told him to check out this site. He short-cut the potatoes by buying fresh-made mashed potatoes at a local market and adding the thyme. He was a little unsure of how much a clove of garlic was, what kind of pan to use, and how high to turn the heat, but DANG! He did it! And it was delicious! His only "concern" I'd ad was that there seemed to be a bit too much butter.

After reading the reviews I also cut down the amount of butter in the recipe. I used 2 tbsp. but I think that 1 tbsp. would have been sufficient. The balsamic glaze was good but it would be better suited to a beef tenderloin than fish.

I made this dish for a quick and easy weekday dinner. Both my fiancee and I were pleased with the results. It's true, the sauce is rich and sweet (arguably too rich for the tilapia) - some of you will like this and some won't. I used 3/4 stick of butter and definitely found this to be sufficient. I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and simple steamed asparagus, which were quite refreshing when contrasted with the sweet/salty from the fish and potatoes. Not a dish to rave about, but certainly one to make again.

This recipe was fabulous! I reduced the butter all the way around and added sauteed mushrooms and onions to the sauce. Only put seasoning salt and pepper on the filets and browned them in a small amount of olive oil. Mounded potatoes, put a filet on top and topped with the sauce. Was as good as the fish I had in Paris and Venice last week! My sister who doesn't eat fish, scarfed it up. Sauce would be great on chicken or other fish as well. Thyme in the potatoes was a nice change.

Overall excellent recipe. The mashed potatoes were fantastic -- the best part, I think! The only problem I had was that the butter started separating from the balsamic, so when I spooned it onto the fish it was sort of clumpy. I may have cooked it too long. Still tasted really good. I did spinach with garlic & olive oil instead of snap peas. I actually wasn't wild about the tilapia, probably because I tend to prefer fish like salmon & swordfish. I might try this dish again with mahi mahi or salmon.

Although this recipe is a little butter-happy, I still loved it. I thought the amount of butter called for in the sauce was completely unnecessary, and only used about 3 tablespoons. I also didn't bother buttering the peas. Aside from that, GREAT! The plain peas did a good job of balancing out the rich sauce, oil-cooked fish and potatoes. I believe I found this recipe under the "healthy" section, and I'm not so sure that's a proper categorization. Either way, I really enjoyed this and will definitely make it again and again.

The balsamic sauce is fantastic over the tilapia, but be sure to do something to give the tilapia itself more flavor than just salt and pepper.

This was so light and delicious when we modified the recipe. I only used one half tablespoon of thyme (dried with sticks removed) to avoid overpowering the flavor.

Turned out great! Only advice is to halve the sauce. I doubled it because I'm a "sauce" guy and I thought a quarter cup of balsamic to start seemed like a tiny amount. Anyway, I threw away about three quarters! A little goes a long way with this very rich butter sauce. Trust me. Also, I made garlic mashed instead, so I can't attest to the thyme...we just love garlic!

Great recipe...will probably try the glaze on chicken. To the Cook from New Haven, CT who wants to know why the fish fell apart in the pan. This is something I learned from watching the Food Network for many years. When pan frying, you have to let the fish or meat alone until the sear is complete...so if the fish is sticking the best thing to do is leave it alone until it is completely seared and easy to move.

Rating: 4
I made the tilapia (with asparagus and a pickled beet/potato salad (sounds weird but tastes good)( for a party of 16 - great success. However, I used 3/4 c of balsamic vinegar to just under 1 stick of butter, and sliced the garlic instead of crushing it so that it was easier to fish out after reduction, thereby making a very smooth sauce. I also reduced the vinegar by over a half (when cooled, it was very thick) before adding the butter; perhaps this is why I had no problem with separation, and drizzled it over the platter of fish.

Rating: 3
I made the Tilapia w/glaze [ doubled the recipe ]. Very good! My husband and I liked the glaze very much and found that it has the potential to be modified in this recipe and for others. He did say that the acid from the vinegar tends to disappear. Our 12 and 10 year olds did not like the sweetness of the balsamic [ go figure ]. I made it as per the recipe, though I stopped 4Tbsp. short with the butter. I believe the key to keeping the butter from separating is to watch and whisk the glaze continuously.

I hate to ruin this recipe's rating, but I made this for dinner last night, used half the butter called for, and still found it to be too greasy. I also had some trouble with the balsamic and the butter separating in the sauce. Maybe it was me, but we did not enjoy this very much. :(

Not sure why I'm rising to the bait, except that it always irks and saddens me to see things like this on these boards. . . With apologies to the rest of you who just want to discuss the recipe! To: "venuswarms from Follow the directions". Does this recipe contain chipotle? Cajun seasoning? Jalapeno? No, it doesn't, does it? I stand by my *opinion* that this dish was bland. Many people can taste the same dish and form many different *opinions* about that dish. Does the fact that I found this dish to be bland and you found it to be flavorful mean that either of us is a bad cook? Or that, as you have included, someone who does not agree with you must be incapable of following what are in this case very simple instructions? No, it does not.

I just tried this without the potatoes and with fresh green beans from the garden. It's quick, tasty and easy - what more could you want?

I followed the recipe exactly, except that I substituted asparagus for the peas. The mashed potatoes were truly fantastic--the thyme flavor was apparent, but subtle. And, just as other reviewers have noted, the sauce is to die for! If the sauce overshadowed the tilapia, I either didn't notice or didn't care! I actually had to make the sauce two times--the first time it completely separated when I added the butter. The second time I reduced the syrup for only 3 minutes (instead of 5) and added the butter immediately. It came out beautifully!

I had some fresh tilapia but wanted to do something different than my usual sesame/soy/ginger marinade. I improvised highly from this recipe and the dish still came out great: I peeled baby new potatoes and added dried thyme and a little sour cream and milk (didn't have actual cream). I would've added more than 2 tblsp of s. cream, but that's all I had. I didn't have to improvise on the balsamic butter sauce, though, and THAT was the real kicker for this recipe! We didn't have any good greens to have w/ the fish and potatoes, so we forewent that part of the meal. All in all, VERY tasty, and so easy...everything was so easy it'd be a shame not to treat myself and my husband to these flavors again and again. I'll try this with different fish, too.

To me, this recipe is really about the balsamic butter sauce: everything else is self-explanatory. I'm glad I listened to other reviews and cut the amount of butter in half. Balsamic has an intense flavor, so a little drizzle of the sauce is all you need, and may be why some reviewers found it overwhelming. I used the sauce to glaze steamed baby carrots instead of sugar peas, and they were delicious. I'm not sure that the mashed potatoes really added anything to the meal, they're just mashed potatoes, but my husband was very happy with them.

I usually do not think three ingredients in a recipe very new or exciting but the simple basalmic vinegar butter sauce with the fish is fab. You can make a bit more healthy by using some great olive oil with a bit of unsalted butter, rather than all butter. Many vegetable sides work well.

Rating: 4
Don't be afraid of the acidity of this, the unsalted butter makes it pleasant to almost any taste. Just pour less sauce over, serve the extra on the side. Perfect flavor for tilapia, I can imagine it over sauteed, hammered chicken breast sections,as well. If you have not done a balsalmic reduction before, then this is is perfect place to start. You will not be sorry. Do not worry about the whisking, swirling the butter pats around in the pan works too.

The balsamic butter sauce it fantastic - not healthy but soooo good. I made the tilapia and the mashed potatoes and served it with asparagus.

The sauce was very tasty but overpowered the Tilapia. FYI: if you make the sauce ahead of time the vinegar may become very thick and "glued" to the sides of the pan.

Terrific recipe! I used white trout since the store was out of tilapia, and dried thyme instead of fresh. The sides complemented the fish really well, and though I was afraid the sauce would overwhelm the fish, it was delicious. Definitely double the sauce, and use a little less butter than stated. And really heed the word "whisk"; I guess my own whisking wasn't vigorous enough, so my sauce separated (but it was still so yummy, I can't wait to try this one again when I actually get it right!)

A tasty recipe that was fairly quick and easy to make! I also made the dish wish asparagus as opposed to the peas. The only reason why this dish didn't recieve 4 forks from me was that it was kind of heavy- tons of butter used. You almost expect fish dishes to be lighter. Variation Suggestions: The whipping cream in the mashies could also be substituted with skim milk, I do not believe the whipping cream was necessary. Also, I don't know how many are good fish cookers out there, but I would recommend lightly brushing the tilapia with butter and baking it at 400 degrees for about 15 minutes (30 minutes if frozen). I'm not a good fish cooker and wasn't happy with my sautee abilities. Three forks for this recipe!!

In my opinion, this recipe is for people that do not like fish. I love balsamic vinegar and use it very frequently. We loved the sauce on the mashed potatoes but not on the delicate fish. Tilapia (like sole) is such a delicate flavor that it was overwhelmed by the sauce. By the way, that was even after I had dipped the fish in flour and then in egg flavored with Tabasco and fresh Parmesian. I know, I should have followed the recipe exactly but my point is that even with the egg, Tabasco and cheese on the fish it still couldn't stand up to the sauce.

This is a delicious, quick, easy dinner. I make it with oven-roasted potatoes seasoned with olive oil, thyme and salt and pepper, rather than mashed, to make it even lower effort. I also cut way back on the butter in the balsamic sauce -- its great just as a thick syrup.

Couldn't agree more on easy & inexpensive. Thanks for the make-ahead timings within the recipe. I would recommend making extra sauce if you don't plate the finished product. Also, the Yukon Gold make beautifully colored mashed potatoes.

I just made the sauce and tilapia, not the side dishes. The sauce couldn't have been easier, and added flavor to the otherwise fairly bland tilapia. Perfect for a mid-week dinner, especially because we always have balsamic vinegar and butter on hand!

I made this recipe exactly as described including the sides and it was delicious. I have been searching for a more interesting way to serve fish and this sauce was rich and decadent. The thyme in the mashed potatoes was a perfect compliment to the flavors of the fish and sauce. The snap peas were good but I think you could really do any vegetable with this recipe. I highly recommend it. It is a rich sauce but it was OK for me because the fish is so light. Definitely try it!

I only made the balsamic butter sauce... I cut the vinegar in half and reduced the butter to 1T. It was easy, fast and very tasty on my broiled tilapia.
