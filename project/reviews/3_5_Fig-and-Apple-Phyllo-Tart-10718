An excellent dessert. I did use creme fraiche instead of yogurt as that was what I had on hand. It needs a little something extra to rate 4 forks. Next time I think I will add some pure maple syrup to the filling and maybe some cinnamon to kick it up.

Extremely simple and very impressive tart for a crowd. I followed it exactly except for using mission figs because we had them on hand. A perfect, light dessert to finish off a decadent meal (we had it after beef short ribs). Would definitely make it again and recommend it!

This recipe was a snap to make. The finished product is a wonderful presentation. I used Calvados instead of apple juice. Next time I plan to substitute creme fraiche with a dash of vanilla in lieu of the vanilla yogurt.

Made this for Christmas two years ago and will again this Christmas. This tart tasted even better the next day, so if you aren't concerned with the bottom being less than crisp, make it early. I added 1 tsp. of good balsamic vinegar to the fig mixture while cooking; this may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I thought it gave it a little depth. No vinegar taste of course. Also used a few chopped walnuts instead of almonds. This is a neat dessert,easy, earthy, more festive than an apple only tart.

This is a lovely dessert! I had to improvise and use a spring form pan as I don't have a tart pan and it worked perfectly. It is so much more elegant than apple pie and I think even easier as I hate working with pastry. I will definately make it again.

Great tart. It came out looking very professional and tasted as good as it looked. I thought adding 1/2c of sugar to fig mixture was going to be too much though. I added 1/4c sugar and still found the fig mixture still too sweat. Next time I'll probably only add 1 T. I also used Pam butter spray instead of butter on my phyllo sheets and thought that worked well.

I didn't have any figs handy, so I used dried cranberries and cranberry juice instead of figs and apple juice. It probably needed more sweetening, but it was good nonetheless and I had rave reviews at home and at a staff meeting. I thought the phyllo dough was difficult to handle but it looked great, so I must have been doing something right!

I am the king of substitution in that I used half fresh mission figs and half dried plums and used cranberry instead of apple juice for the base in this recipe and it turned out wonderful. I used Gala and Golden D. Apples. Everything else stayed true to the recipe. I was skeptical about the yogurt/egg topping but I think it adds alot in the way of presentation and flavor. I used the rectangular tart tin as suggested in the previous review. If you arrange the apple slices perpendicular to the sides of the tart pan you can slice the tart so each person receives a portion with nicely fanned apple slices. Highly recommended !!

This looked and tasted like it came from a magnificent french bakery. It was easy to make and so good. My guests ate it up.

In looking for recipes using dried figs I gave this one a whirl...it was gone in a flash! I used a fancy rectangular tart tin and served slices with a dollop of whipped cream. The almonds would be lovely on this dessert but I had to leave them out due to diet restrictions. Surprisingly tasty, appetizing texture and delicious too!
