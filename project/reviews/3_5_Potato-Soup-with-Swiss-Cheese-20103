This was incredibly easy. I added 2% milk and it came out just fine. It didn't say to peel the potatoes, so I left them with skins on. My kids liked it too! I would call it baked potato soup. I think it would also be good with chives and a dollop of fresh sour cream on top.

Considering this soup consists of dairy, dairy, dairy, dairy and potato, I should have been prepared for how thick it would be. I followed the directions exactly, but it turned out more like creamy mashed potatoes than a soup. Still, it was tasty! Next time I think I'll cut out some of the cream and add some chicken broth to get a more liquid texture.

This is a wonderfully tasty and EASY soup. I've made it a number of times and the recipe is perfect as is. If you want some changes for variety, I have put garlic cloves in with the potatoes as they cooked for a bit of flavor. Also, using sharp, white cheddar, and/or gruyere cheeses is great. This is a perfect chilly day meal.

my husband (american) loved this soup...it reminded him a bit of the tony roma's baked potato soup...i took other cooks' advice and used a sharp cheese...i also slightly oversauteed the onions (accidentally)...my husband kept asking me how i got that 'smokey' flavour! next time, i would puree half of the potato and small dice the other half as others suggested...i think the texture would be improved

I found this soup outstanding. I never realized how easy it would be to make!! What a wonderful layer of flavors. I used 3/4 of a brick of sharp cheese, perfect!!! Absolutely yummy!! I also added 4 extra potato's diced and boiled for some texture!!

This is so great on those cold snowy evenings!!! I made into a baked potato soup, try with sharp cheddar cheese! Also, cut potaotes into bite sized pieces, and take half of them after they have cooked and enough of stock to make a purree. Add back into the soup and you can use less cream if would like. I used the amount called for and the soup literally stuck to the sides of the bowls! Everyone loved it! YUM!

my husband and i are big soup eaters - potato being one of our favorites. i made this dish leaving out the nutmeg (because i don't care for it) and using sharp white cheddar cheese instead of swiss. we loved it and will make it again and again as the weather turns colder. I halved most of the recipe, but used a whole onion and extra bacon. It was delicious!

Made about 2/3 recipe, and used 2% milk in lieu of cream and it was still delicious!! Just the right amount of seasonings for a delicate flavor, yet a hardy meal! I will certainly make this again! Figured if this recipe was still around after 42 years, it had to be good!
