3/4 of a stick of butter IS 6 tablespoons.

I used this for the Maple Syrup Pie recipe and it worked great! The texture of the dough is perfect~ There is just one thing though: there is a mistake in the amount of butter required. It calls for 12 TBSP butter (3/4 stick), and in parentheses, 6 TBSP! Bad mistake... so I put the stick and a half (12 TBSP), thinking extra butter couldn't hurt pastry dough. I ended up having to use extra flour because it was a little too much (somewhere in the middle, like 8 TBSP~1 stick~ would be good), and it came out a little like shortbread. I thought it was great though.
