The vinaigrette seemed a little sour from the lemons, so I balanced it with some raspberry jam. It turned out terrific! The berry essence adds just a little complexity to the dish. It really is a nice dish. I'm going to serve the egglant sliced about a half inch thick, drizzed with a little vinaigrette, as an appetizer. I agree with one of the others here, I wouldn't be surprised toasted pine nuts tossed on top wouldn't be a welcomed addition.

No changes. A winner into the books.

Excellent! I prepared this dish to serve during a tapas party. Big hit. Plan to make again and serve with leg of lamb. I used dried cumin.

This was a great recipe! So simple & delicious. I halved the 6 person recipe & used only one good sized eggplant. I will definitely make this again.

We loved this. Made the 6-serving recipe for 2 people. Used the cut-up leftovers to top a homemade pizza. Double duty treats from an end of summer bounty. Look forward to making it again.

This recipe exceeded my expectations, especially because I had difficulty pureeing the vinaigrette (I halved the 6-person version). So, I served it lumpy and didn't expect much. Instead, the flavor was really outstanding--lots of intensity in the vinaigrette against the tamer eggplants. Smaller eggplants definitely should be used--one of mine was a bit large and didn't cook as well, so it was a bit tough.

Instead of broiling the eggplant, I grilled it, thinking that it would add to the overall flavor. While I'm sure it did, the recipe still wasn't the smashing success I'd expected, based upon previous reviews. Perhaps my guests universally disliked eggplant and were too polite to tell me. I think that I'm going to stick with less controversial vegetables when hosting future dinner parties...

The vinaigrette was great, although I modified it a little by adding a few pine nuts and substituted regular parsley instead of the flat variety.

I also brushed the vinaigrette onto the eggplant while broiling and baking. Delicious! Only took about 10 minutes in the oven after broiling. Next time, I will try with powdered cumin instead of the cumin seeds. I used a little less oil and a little more coriander. I served this as a main dish with gnocchi and tomato sauce on the side, and my boyfriend had seconds and cannot wait for his lunch leftovers tomorrow!

This is so tasty...I think the cumin (i used powder) is what gives it such a unique flavor. I also used all cilantro--no parsley. I actually brushed the vinaigrette on the eggplant halves while they were cooking.

I made this recipe for a dinner party and thought it was one of the best eggplant recipes I've tried. It went really well with the game we were having, but I think it would go well with any meal.
