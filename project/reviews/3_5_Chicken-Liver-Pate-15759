During Thanksgiving,my mom made duck and turkey. She had removed the livers and had them setting on a plate - waiting to be thrown away! (TRAVESTY!) My auntie suggested a pate, so I pulled this recipe up and became the favorite chef of the hour in a matter of minutes! Out of necessity I modified the recipe slightly: used scallions instead of onion, brandy instead of cognac (this seems a better sub than sherry).

Wow! Like so many others I did not have cognac so I used sherry to great effect. My new addiction?

I'm not an expert on pate, but I loved this recipe - delicious...I plan to whip up a batch to bring th Christmas dinner. I replaced the Cognac with Sherry.

In truth the pate is still chilling in the freezer, but from the simplicity of the recipe, to the serendipity of having all the ingredients on hand, plus first tastings being very positive, I think this will become a favorite standy.

Just finished making it. From the "spatula test", even before chilling, I was impressed. Following the review suggestions, I added more brandy (no cognac at home) and about 1/2 c. rehydrated wild mushrooms. They soaked up all the flavors from the pan before draining and is a flavorful, lower calorie filler to expand the recipe. Not that I'm countin' calories with this recipe! Came out with a nice mild flavor (I'm not a fan of liver, but love pate...go figure?) I'd make it again in a heart beat!

ok, I let the pate sit and the flavors melded. The sweetness of the onions lightened up the taste of the livers. Please disregard my last post. My recommendation now is to make it the night before you eat it for optimum flavor.

To me, this tasted more like jewish deli chopped liver than pate. I quadrupled the recipe but only had 2 large onions. I also had to substitute(a good quality )sherry for the Cognac. I feel that even if I had followed the recipe exactly, it still would have needed a little fine tuning. Next time I will use Cognac and will use lots of it. I may also consider adding back some of the cooking broth, cooking the livers to leave them a little pink. I will continue to make chicken liver pate but will def alter this recipe.

I served this as appetizer before family dinner over the Thanksgiving holiday - it was wonderful. I 4x the recipie, used less onions and added one carrot, otherwise wouldn't change a thing..it'd be great just the way it is. There were no left-overs..

Would I make this dish again? Well, let's put it this way. I made it as a trial for Thanksgiving (quadrupuling the recipe) and decided that if it went over well, I would serve the remaining crock along with the other of that evening's hors d'oeuvres. Um, well, between three adults and 1 13 year old the first crock disappeared within about 3 seconds. I needed to buy a whole 'nother 2 lbs of liver to make it again, enough for the 22 people we are expecting. I have also eaten the remaining crock of the first batch myself. I followed the recipe pretty much exactly, but like other reviewers, DOUBLED THE LIQUOR (at least) I used Sherry and a little bit of red wine. Just make sure you don't put too much liquid in and make the pate too watery, although over a couple of hours in the fridge it sets up nicely. Also, I added white truffle oil and used a little less of the butter than indicated. Finally, I folded in, along with the whipped cream (which, by the way, I find an essential addition), shitakes that I first sauteed in some of the lovely white truffle oil. Sounds decadent? It is. I would say, delicious, decadent and best of all EASY TO PREPARE. Just don't even think about trying to calculate Weight Watcher points. I served it with whole grain melba toast rounds, perfect to hold up its consistency. Yum. I'm going to go eat some more now.

I thought the flavor of this was very good but didn't like the texture. I'm going to leave the cream out next time or at the very least, start with much less. By the way, I hate the new Epcurious format. Can we please go back to the old one?

I thought this was a good, easy pate recipe. I used liquid from dried porcini mushrooms mixed with chicken stock and added freshly ground pepper. I also used Calvados in place of Cognac, and doubled the amount noted in the recipe. Agreed with another review, and so I also used slightly less whipped cream as I wanted thicker pate. Agreed that it would be too rich for two people; I served it at a party.

Delicious and easy pate recipe...starting point for adding some other ingredients, such as pistachios and raisins, which add to the visual appeal if you are molding and slicing it.

This is my new liverwurst, better than anything I can buy in the deli. I smear cracker bread with mayo and a hot mustard, or a sweet red pepper jelly for a change. I added the cream as I pureed in the blender, didn't whip as in recipe. Kept in fridge for a least a week, better with each day.

My company enjoyed the recipe but the pate tended to be overpowering. The liver flavour in this recipe was a tad too strong for my liking...

I doubled the recipe and served it as an appetizer for company. Everyone positively raved! I would make it again.

This recipe has everything that a good pate should need, except for the whipped cream. I followed the recipe exactly, ended up with a bowlful of unappetizing, unappealing, disgusting-looking STUFF!! If I had skipped the whipping cream, as I considered doing at the time, I'm sure I'd have had a delicious pate. Next time I think I'll have a winner, but this time it went down the disposal. Even the pate-lovers at our big party wouldn't take a second taste!! And I even soaked the chicken livers in milk overnight as a previous writer suggested....

This was great. I had remembered seeing recipes like this one when I saw the chicken livers in the store, so I figured I'd buy them give it a shot. Wow! So rich, and not at all liver-y. How the creator of this dish says it serves only two is beyond me.

Yummy!

I found some chicken livers in the store and thought I'd try this recipe. There were enough livers to triple it. I took the advice of some other reviewers and more than doubled the booze (I don't know much about Cognac so I bought Remy Martin VSOP... not bad :). It was fantastic!! My husband and I ate the whole thing ourselves. I think the next time I'll add even more booze and some more allspice after draining.

I've managed to convert several finicky eaters into pate lovers with this recipe. This also turns out great with sherry if you don't have cognac or brandy on hand. As the other reviewers--I say double the booze!!

I made this recipe for New Years eve with my parents. In addition to the listed ingredients I crisped bacon and added that to the food processor along with some cream cheese. I didn't have brandy so I threw in a bit of whiskey and some red wine (I know- it sounds funny- but it was good. I had doubled the recipe- so there were plenty of leftovers- two days later all the flavors seemed to have mellowed so beautifully it was even better than before. I think next time I'll experiment further with chopped shitake and a little truffle oil. Overal, this is a great basic recipe-good as it stands- easy to add things to and really easy to make.

I tripled the recipe. My only addition was one package of gelatin because I wanted to make sure the pate would mold properly. It did and was perfect! My guests loved it!

Excellent pate, very easy to make. Can I make a suggestion though? Soak the livers in milk overnight first then drain and rinse then dry - makes a world of difference! Also, allow to go cold in refridgerator before pureeing othewise they carry on cooking.

This is the best paté I've had, and so easy to make. I took the other cooks' advice and doubled the cognac. Next time I will add even more cognac and a bit more salt.

I quadrupled this recipe to take on a camping/canoeing trip. It received many raves. I am making again per a request from someone who had it with us camping. I added quite a bit more brandy (didn't have cognac) and fresh ground black pepper. Very good!

Yum! I made a quadrupled recipe for a party. Everyone seemed to love it. I added a bit more cognac to it, but the rest was as recipe stated. I formed it into a loaf pan lined with waxed paper, then released it onto a platter ringed with decorative greens, two colors of grapes, and strawberries, plus a basket of plain crackers on the side. Next time, just a bit more salt. But it was terrific! Lots of dirty dishes in making the dish, for some reason, but nonetheless it was SO simple to make.

I made this at Christmas and I haven't been able to get it out of my mind so I made it again today.I didn't have any cognac so I used a 1/4 teaspoon of Brandy Extract and added a touch more salt. Delicious

OH... MY... GOD! This is a fantastic recipe! It was my first time making liver pate and was amazed how simple it is. I served it on two different occasions and got rave reviews. I'm looking forward to make it again for the holidays (this time with a little more brandy though!) Thanks!

Rating: 4
Yes excellent. Very light. It does need more brandy though.

Rating: 4
This is a wonderful basic recipe. I quadrupled it for a Christmas Eve gathering, adding about a teaspoon of dried green peppercorns and a teaspoon or so of fresh time to the cooking broth. I also caramelized the onion (adding a shallot as well). Finally, I didn't whip the cream, but added it in a slow stream while pureeing the other ingredients in the food processor. The results were out of this world! Next time, perhaps I'll increase the amount of cognac; my family will be expecting to see this again!

I made this pate for my husband's birthday party and it was a great success! The greatest compliment was from a friend who cooks for the Hilton. He said it was the best pate he's ever had and sat next to it all evening. I will definitely make it again, especially since it was so easy.

I was extremely delighted with the outcome. I had never tried my hand at pate' before, and I look forward to experimenting with this recipe in the future. I added more brandy(about 4 tbsp) than called for, but I followed the rest of the directions exactly.
