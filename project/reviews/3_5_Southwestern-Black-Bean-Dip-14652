Simple, but great, will absolutely be making this again soon! The only change I made was to add some sour cream as suggested by other reviewers, which I think improved the texture. I can't understand why others think this dip is 'ugly' - exactly what you'd expect from a good black bean dip.

I used a yellow bell pepper instead of green and I chopped it into tiny chunks along with the onion. I then added them after I was done with the food processor to give the dip more texture. I also had only chopped in the cilantro so there were some chunks of that as well. Great flavor! It was a huge hit with tortilla strips. -- Side Note: Coriander Sprigs = Fresh Cilantro (I had to google it)

The reason for three forks is the changes I made to the recipe. I did not saute the onion (used red onion) and pepper (used jalapenos). Instead I chopped them and the cilantro and mixed them with the rest of the blended ingredients. I used olive oil instead of water, two limes, and a touch of sour cream. I managed to avoid the unpleasant color other reviewers mentioned. It was very tasty and crunchy as a dip and as a warmed side dish.

Very good dip - I added sour cream and cheese, which really made it. My 8 year old, who doesn't like black beans said it was the best! Even dipped veggies in it. Simple and delicious -- everyone loved it.

I have been using this recipe for years. It is the best bean dip I have ever tasted. It is always the first thing gone when I serve appetizers. It also makes a great sandwich spread and is totally healthy !!

This dip looks ugly but tastes great, and it's a really good addition to tostadas. I adjust the seasonings each time I make this, but I always skip the cayenne and add pickled jalapeno instead. This keeps well in the fridge and is best served after it sits for several hours and the flavors blend.

Ok I made a LOT of modifications cause my internet went offline and I couldn't access the recipe. I think that's one of the good things about this kind of dip. Anything goes! I used left over cuban black beans (from this site) which were very bland. Added sour cream, old cheddar, leftover kale, coriander (my brother hates it but he loves this dip and can't tell it's in there), a couple of garlic cloves, tsp of cider vinegar, some brown sugar and a whole tomato. It's creamy and healthy. Nice change from salsa.

I like strong flavors, so I used only an 8oz can of beans, added juice of a whole lime, added a jalapeno pepper seeds and all, to the bell pepper and onion. The added lime juice and jalapeno knocked it out of the park. It's going to be great for taco/ burrito base, used as a dip, or definitely on crudites topped with cheese and tomato and other good stuff!

I thought it was ok, but my boyfriend really liked it. The taste is very earthy. I would use a little less onion next time.

This was great. A hit as a dip, but I've actually been using it as the filling for vegetarian enchiladas. The flavors go wonderfully with traditional sauce.

I made this for a cocktail party, and though it's not pretty (picture gray mush!), once my guests tried it, they ate it ALL. We served it with plantain chips, delicious!

I just returned from our birthing class and it was our turn to make snacks. This went over well with the crudité as a vehicle. The big hit was the Sausage-Stuffed Mushrooms that I got from this site but can no longer find here. In any case, I was asked for both recipes. This is a good, healthy dip. Don't be afraid to experiment with it! Leftovers make good nacho or burrito fodder.

I loved it. It was really quick and the spices were great.

This belongs in everyone's book of favorite recipes. Great to take to a party. To add extra flavor, I process it in a processor I use to make salsa, but don't clean out the remaining tomato juice, onion, etc. left over from the salsa. It gives it a litttle extra kick.

I've made this black bean dip multiple times & it's always a hit. It also freezes well, so you're always prepared for unexpected guests.

The dip is great. I added a few hot peppers to spice it up a little and served it as a side with chips. A big hit!

Very good. I upped the spices a little because we like spicy food, and it went quickly at our cocktail party. However, I doubled the recipe and was left with A LOT at the end of the evening, even though it seemed to be well-liked. I think a little goes a long way with this one.

I found this to be a delicious dip to make before meals or to eat on a cold winter day. I used refried beans instead of black beans and baked it in the oven with mozzarella cheese at 300 for about 10 minutes before serving.

This dip was ok. I much prefer Cooking Light's Tex Mex Black Bean Dip (on their website) - it is mixed with a little bit of chopped tomato and picante sauce - I think it provides better flavor.

My husband made this recipe and served it with sour cream and Blue corn chips. Great taste. In his opinion, and mine, it needed a little more lime and the onions should be stirred in, not processed, to add texture. Great flavor.

Very good. Mixed up easily in my small food processor. A nice refreshing dip, not spicy at all, but full of flavor and with very little fat. A nice addition to salsa/guacamole with chips.

I love black beans and the other ingredients sounded great but this dip lacked flavor. I added more of the spices and doubled the coriander and that helped. It also has a very unappetizing color - blackish green!

I was a little wary of this recipe because bean dips can be a little bland, but my fears were unfounded. The flavor is great, as is the texture. It was also simple to make AND healthy! Definitely a keeper.

I made five dips for a Christmas party and this is the only one that completely disappeared. Some folks commented on its spicyness but I would make it again in a heartbeat - exactly as the recipe describes.

I made this dip for a party and served it out of a small carved out pumpkin with a clear glass bowl in it. It has a great flavor.
