I made this exactly as written and thought it was okay, nothing special.

Delicious! Thin and crispy. I used slivered almonds, because I prefer a more subtle crunch than whole provides, and added a touch of cardamom because I was worried the cookies might be a little bland. Aside from those two minor modifications, I stuck to the recipe, and was very pleased with the results. I baked half the dough, and am storing the remaining log in my freezer for impromptu tea parties. I'll definitely be making these again...though I might add more cardamom next time for a bit more kick.

Great recipe. Turned out perfect. You do not need to use whole almonds or cook them longer than 12 minutes, by the way. I only had slivered almonds and they turned out just fine. I also goofed up and ended up freezing them for about 2 hours (rather than the 1/2 hour the recipe calls for) and they turned out just fine. This is an excellent recipe--I will definitely make them again. Not too sweet, good and crispy, nice almond taste.

These were great. Definitely an adult cookie. Sort of like a Jules Destrooper almond thin.

These were easy and delicious, not too sweet. Sort of skewing to the adults...probably fab with Port.

I was so excited to get my Gourmet christmas issue, loved all the cookie recipes. Anyway, baked them all, so come back Sunday to see a review of them all! (my bd party is tonight, Thanksgiving feast was last night, so no time right now...). These were blah, ok. (the Coconut-almond lace cookies were fabulous,I even skipped the chocolate drip on top, didn't have time. They're perfect, just as they are... Later
