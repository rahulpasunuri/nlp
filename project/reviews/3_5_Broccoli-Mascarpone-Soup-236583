This is a beautiful first course soup. The second time I made this, I did make a few changes. 1. I sauteed a bunch of celery along with the shallots. 2. I increased the amount of broccoli. 3. I added some roasted garlic. 4. I whisked in some finely grated parmesan. My guests requested the recipe. The garnish of chives is such an attractive touch atop the small scoop of mascarpone. (I use a little melon baller for speed and consistency when serving at the party. No matter how great a recipe, I like to tweek it to make it my own.

This was sooooo watery and bland. What a disappointing misuse of mascarpone. I used 5 cups of broth instead of 6, and it was still insipid and blah. I'd recommend leaving the cover off and reducing the cups of broth to 3 1/2 or 4. Still, I'm sure there are better cream of broccoli soups, which are far less expensive than the wasted mascarpone version!

Not sure what was missing from this, but I was not impressed. It was fine, but I doubt that I'll make it again.

This was delicious! I loved that I was able to make it ahead of time. It was tasty, a beautiful addition to the menu, and very simple to make.

I'll be adding this to my roster of fall/winter soups, although it would also be great as a summer soup (chilled). I'll use slightly less chicken broth next time because I like creamy soups to be a bit thicker... I didn't have cayenne pepper, so I added a few red chile flakes and white pepper for a bit of kick. With a few minor tweaks, I might give this 4 stars.

This has become one of our favorites! It is so creamy and delicious and refreshing .. .and the chives give just the right kick! Did not have cayenne pepper, so just added some extra chives and some paprika. Fabulous and incredibly easy. Also - husband is lactose intolerant... used tofu cream cheese instead of mascarpone and it was still delicious.

I made this for dinner last night as a starter, and my husband and I loved it! I didn't have enough low-salt chicken broth, so I used part vegetable broth and added a little kosher salt and black pepper. We thought the result was very tasty. I will definitely make this again.

I was disappointed with the soup and I followed the recipe except added a touch more cayenne. Like another reviewer said, it was thin and bland and I expected better texture & flavor from the marscapone. Maybe it would be better in a really small amount as a main course? I don't really even want to try it again with changes.

This made an entire meal for me. I love it. I shared it with my daughter, who although not overly fond of broccoli, ate this right up. We just had some crusty bread to go with it. So good.

I made this soup as part of our New Year's eve celebration. It was wonderful! The mascarpone cheese is not available at the local grocery store, but we could find it at Trader Joe's. It was worth the trip!

I made this soup for New Years Eve dinner and it was thin and flavorless. The cayenne pepper at the end had a nice kick and was the only thing going for it.

I'd also give this 3.5 - it is sooo nice and light and easy to make. I forgot to do the dollop of mascarpone for the presentations and didn't miss it. The Christmas Eve party of 8 loved it.

I would definitely make this again for a family weekday meal. I found it very simple to make and not a lot of thought needs to go into it. I'm not sure I'd make this for company or for a special occassion though.

this was a little to light for my taste. I will serve it with not only the cheese, but a large crouton floating on top.

Very easy to make and extremely tasty. Has a good bite to it. Just the right amount of cayenne. Mascarpone is very expensive so I used Ricotta instead which is also an Italian cream cheese.
