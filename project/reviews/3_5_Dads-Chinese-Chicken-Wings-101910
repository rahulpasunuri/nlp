Baffled. I was suspicious of this recipe b/c it lacked so much complexity but it had great reviews so I used it for a birthday party that I made food for. Pretty disappointing. They are salty and aside from tasting like soy sauce, they don't have much depth. They sat uneaten and the second batch I marinated went unused. There are many other much more interesting recipes- those that include usage of hoisin or fruit preserves, etc. This one was basically about broiling the wings in a salt broth. Not great and really unsure why the ratings are so close to a 4. I do have other recipes by Nina Simonds that are very good, by the way.

This is a good recipe but it needs some tweaking. With the exception of substituting rice wine vinegar for rice wine, I followed it exactly. At 40 minutes (with one turn and baste at 20), the wings were pretty charred. Either 500 is too high or 40 min is too long. Otherwise really tasty. I'd do them again but adjust the temp or time, one or both. If they hadn't burned, they'd be 4 forks. As is, 3 forks.

Well, I did substitute dry sherry for the rice wine as suggested by a Chinese friend of mine.I was not impressed. These wings had little flavor. I had them in the marinade for 24 hrs. I also used a low salt soy sauce. So if you make them, don't use dry sherry or low salt. They were a real snooze.

I patted dried the wings and let them completely dry out in the refrigerator over night for crispier skins. I also used a low sodium soy sauce and sherrry wine instead of sake. The result was amazing! They reminded me of the roasted ducks you see in China Town. They were perfectly browned and skins were so crispy! Will make them again for sure.

These wings are phenomenal--I take them every year to my work holiday party, make them for my family Super Bowl bash, etc., and they always disappear. They are so savory, and are fantastic at any temperature. The only caveat is that you might have some smoke issues, so if you have any type of ventilation fan in the kitchen I would turn it on shortly after you put the wings into the oven. Open windows will help if that's all you can manage.

All I can say is YES theses are those Chicken wings! YUMMY they do not last long and are great 2 days later If you have left overs.

Rating: 3
Very easy and very good. Only had time to marinate for 3 hours, cooked according to instructions, but with a wire cooling rack on top of roasting pan so wings weren't sitting in sauce/grease. Will definitely make again! They were a hit with adults and kids.

I've been making these for years but here's a suggestion for something I just started doing recently: put a cooling rack on your cookie sheets to get the wings up and out of their juices. I've found the skin crisps up much better that way. Also, I always substitute a good dry sherry for the rice wine. Whenever I make these, there are never any left!!

These wings were really delicious! They were also incredibly easy to make. Using low-sodium soy sauce will cut down on the saltiness, but also, if you don't eat them right away, the saltiness goes away.

These wings are delicious! I did not have rice wine or sake, so I used rice wine vinegar (halving the amount) and it worked just fine. I have a convection oven and found 500 way too hot - after 15 minutes I adjusted to 400 and after another 15 minutes the wings were done. These are good hot and at room tempurature - perfect party food.

I have made these many times. Love them! I make a batch, freeze individually & bag. Take out what I need & when in a hurry, micro them. Other wise heat in oven until warmed through. Every time I'm in a Chinese resteraunt & they have these wings, that's about all I have. Not easy to find--most resteraunts have the every day ho-hum deep fried breaded wings found in the freezer by the 20 pound bags just to please the American palate. Not at all Chinese. At my favorite Chinese place, I was told that most restaurants cater to the American tastes. Not at all/much like the real thing. These are the real thing.

Am I the only one who finds that these burn at 500 degrees for 40 minutes? I've made them 3x and cut back the cooking time more each time. Other than that, these have been very popular - although others seem to like them more than I.

Made these last night. They were good but not great. They were a little too salty for my taste even though I am not a low salt cook.Also thought the flavor was lacking something...possibly sweetness??? I will try these again but use low sodium soy sauce and add some orange juice in place of the water.

I made a double batch, took them to a neighborhood potluck, and they were the only item completely gone in the end. Personally, I thought they were just okay. They took about an hour to get crispy.

I thought 500 degrees for 40 minutes would have me ending up with chinese chicken briquettes, but these wings were fantastic. I marinated for almost 20 hours and followed the recipe to the letter. I brought them to a party and got rave reviews. They are one of my favorites now.

Good wings but there was something lacking in flavour. I marinaded over night and followed the recipe exactly, but still not quite right. Perhaps next time the addition of either beer or something sweet to the marinade might help.

this is my favourite barbecue party food. I used oyster sauce instead of light sauce and grilled it on the barbecue until it sort of dried up... lovely...

My family loved these wings and they are tough critics. The marinade makes the chicken truly delectable. My only complaint was the amount of smoke cooking the wings at 500degrees created. Delicious!!

Rating: 4
These are WONDERFUL! I used regular soy sauce & Shao Xing rice wine. Only was able to marinate them for 4 hours. No problem with being too salty. I also used double lining of foil on my pan. No problem with clean up. Big time keeper/winner with this one!

Rating: 4
These were wonderful! I did not find that 500 degrees was too high - it gives a crispy texture without the frying, but doesn't dry out the wings. Agree with reviewers - invest in disposable pans to avoid messy cleanup and use low sodium soy to lessen the saltiness of the wings.

Rating: 3
Just made this for a party and it was delicious. I live in a very out of the way place, and could not get sake or rice wine, so I substituted dry vermouth. I made a double recipe, and had to use foil lasagna pans. The basting liquid and chicken juices collected in the pan, and the chicken did not crisp. It was still delicious. I used half wings and half thighs. The thighs were wonderfully juicy.

I usually make fun of the people who change every other ingredient and still rate the thing, but ... here goes: First time thru, I mistakenly read "rice vinegar" for rice wine, but it turned out delicious anyway, the best wings I've ever made. I went back and prepared the recipe correctly and thought it was very good too, but the vinegar really was better. Two other changes (sorry!): I've found that there's no need to heat the marinade (esp. with the vinegar version), and I put them in the over at 500 for 45 minutes, then turn off the heat and leave them in until they're fallling off the bone. Investing in 3 disposable foil pans is a good timesaver. Let the reviewer-bashing begin.......

I made this with low sodium soy sauce and rice wine (aka Mirin), marinated overnight. They were not salty at all. I followed the recipe as stated except for the 500* temp. I did not want carbon wings. Cooked at 450* turning and basting every 15 minutes. No sticking problems with a teflon coated sheet liner.

These wings were a big hit at my party. Instead of rice wine I used white wine vinegar. I made two different types of wings and these were clearly the favorite.

Rating: 3
I made about 75 of these for a party, and they were all gobbled up! I used low sodium Soy sauce, so they weren't too salty, and a good Sherry in lieu of the Sake. After I made them (& before cooking) I put them in large ziplock bags and froze them until the night before the party. I cooked after thawing, and used enough sauce while cooking to keep them from sticking. A great, easy make ahead appetizer that I'll make again.

Rating: 4
Have always used sake instead of rice wine - and sweet soy sauce instead of regular. Doesn't turn out salty at all that way. Usually not thinking far enough ahead to marinade more than 4hrs or so. Our guests always gobble these up, so better to make a separate batch for leftovers.

Rating: 3
After reading the other reviews I cut down the marinating time to about 4 hours. I had a little trouble with sticking. Like other reviewers I found the wings way too salty when I tried one out of the oven. I had to let them cool and refrigerated them for about an hour (I was waiting to go pick up my husband from work). This turned out the solution to the salty problem. I heated them up on 350 degrees and my husband loved them. When I tried them again the saltyness was gone and I was left with a tasty chicken wing. My husband definately wants me to make these again.

I loved this recipe, but felt it needed a little more kick. I added about a Tbsp. of "Sambal Oelek" (an oriental chili paste available in the asian section of most supermarkets) to the marinade after it was boiled and cooled. You can add more or less to your taste or even be cauious and start with less in the marinade and add more to the wings after they are cooked. I also use sake instead of rice wine (less salty) and they are great barb-a-qued (less mess).

Rating: 2
Rather salty, probably from the salt in the cooking wine. Instead of marinating overnight and baking, I would try simmering the wings in the marinade/sauce for 45 minutes.

Rating: 4
I doubled the amount of chicken but made a single recipe of marinade and it was just fine. I divided the chicken and marinade into ziploc bags. They are easier to fit in the fridge that way.

DO NOT MARINATE OVERNIGHT!!! It makes the wings way too salty. In fact, I wouldn't marinate the wings more than 2-3 hours unless you decrease the amount of soy sauce used and add more water. We marinated the wings overnight like the recipe suggested and they were so salty that we had to throw it out.

Rating: 4
Definitely will make these again. Yummier, less mess, less active cooking time than traditional buffalo wings. Turned and basted three times while cooking at recommended temparature. That really minimized the sticking.

Rating: 4
My husband and I loved this! I marinated it for over 24 hours and it was so full of flavor. I don't think you need to salt it because it gets enough salt from the soy sauce. They should be cooked at that temperature because chinese chicken wings are always served crispy. I put a thin layer of the marinade on bottom of pan and turned and basted every 10 minutes and I had no sticking problems.

Rating: 4
So easy & so good. Made these for a dinner party & every wing disappeared so quickly,by the time my husband got to them he only got 2 wings.(made about 4 lbs). Kids absolutely loved them. Same problem as a previous reviewer,I had a problem with some of the wings sticking to the foil.

Don't rush the marinade time. These are absolutely THE BEST! I alternate 2 pans full in the oven between top and bottom rack (half way through cooking time, I take pans out, flip wings, reglaze and switch positions in oven), set the heat for 515, and cooked for a little over an hour total.

The wings were very good but, did anyone have trouble with them sticking to the aluminum foil at that high of a heat?

Irresistably delicious! Better than any take-out wings I've ever had. Very easy to prepare, but use plenty of foil on the cookie sheet. I can't wait to take them to a party!
