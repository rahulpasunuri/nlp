I'm not sure ANY steak sauce deserves a 4 fork rating, but I could happily give this one a 3.5. I can't say how this recipe is when prepared as written, but it was very good with modifications -- which you're allowed to do if you're the first reviewer, right:-)? I soaked the raisins in the full amount of water but only used 1 C. of water in the recipe. I minced 3 nice-sized shallots and 4 large-ish cloves of garlic and sauteed that in a bit of olive oil. I added the cored, coarsely chopped tomatoes and sauteed those until soft & smooshy. I added about 2 Tbs. applesauce, about 1 Tbs. of honey, 1.5 Tbs. of orange marmalade, 2.5 Tbs. of Worcestershire and 1 hefty teaspoon of dried mustard then added the raisins with only 1 C. of soaking liquid. I let it all percolate together for a few minutes, added lots of black pepper and maybe 1/4 tsp. of salt. I "pulsed" it to a chunky puree in the Cuisinart, stuck it in a jar and served it that night and the next. It was (not surprisingly) better on night two. I served it with pork chops and filet and it was very good and very simple (but ingredient- heavy, as all of Michael Chiarello's recipes tend to be)! I'll make it again.
