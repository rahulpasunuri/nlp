We love asparagus and this is an unusual way to prepare, but quite tasty and certainly easy. My only recommendation is to modify the first cook time based on the thickness of the asparagus spears.

I made this once as is, delicious. Used as inspiration for lazier single person version: just chop up personal portion asparagus, stir fry in olive/sesame oil combo, add splash of soy, sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds. Still good.

My 10-year old inhaled the asparagus. Need I say more? It's easy and delicious.

This is a really easy and quick dish to make. It is also an easy recipe to experiment with -- such as including other vegetables as other reviewers mentioned, or using a sugar substitute for a lower calorie version. And an important safety tip I learned the first time I made this -- don't add the sesame seeds to the pan while it is still cooking. They pop out of the pan and do not feel good on bare skin!

YUMMY! YUMMY! YUMMY! Served with chicken piccata. It paired perfectly. I cook asparagus often. My son claimed it was the best, and it was delicious!

perfect accompaniment to chinese style dinner. i pared the stems so the spears would cook more evenly. i also diluted one tbs soy with one tbs water to cut down on sodium as rest of dinner had soy sauce in it. i served orange slices for desert and the only things missing werer the fortune cookies!

It was great with the ginger-soy steak...so easy and yummy! Would have marinated the asparagus for a bit longer so it had a bit more flavor but I will DEFINITELY make it again!

Yum - and so easy! I didn't change a thing and I've already bought more asparagus to make it again. Served it with peanut sesame noodles and ginger-soy grilled steak (both from this site) - delish!

Excellent recipe. This is definitely a keeper and very simple. This is great with miso salmon and brown rice. I love garlic and ginger so I added more than the recipe calls for.

i am a college student in england and the only person in the dorm who knows how to not burn toast...i cook for my friends alot and this is one of the most sought-after side dishes! usually we use brocolli or green beans though since student budgets aren't fantastic... i suggest chopping up 1 or 2 green chillies (depending on how hot you like your food...) and throwing in some mushrooms (up the proportions a bit, obviously...) yum.

I didn't have the sesame seeds on hand, so left them off, very good regardless... quick and easy.

Yum yum yum. I made a fun modification: I roasted the asaragus in the oven at 375. I used a silpat liner, so the asparagus got crispy without sticking. Some of the sauce burned on the sides where it came off the liner though. It gave a lovely crispy, chewy, sweet flavor. Next time, I might reserve some of the sauce to cook a bit in a small pan and pour over the asparagus. It came out great as is, though.

I don't know what happened because it seems like most everyone really liked this but I took one bite and wished I wouldn't have wasted the asparagus. Fixed it according to recipe but still didn't like and I like asparagus. Maybe it will be better tomorrow, I don't know, but I know that I won't be making it again.

I've made this dish several times, both with asparagus or with beans (our favorite). Even our 6 year old loves this preparation. I do double/triple up on the garlic and add a dash of Hoisin sauce at the end. It sweetens it up a bit. LOVE IT!

Oh, so easy, quick, and yummy. This dish paired quite nicely with "Dave's Marinated Salmon" (also found on this site). No (to the reviewer below), it's not the second coming of asparagus. It's just a good tasting, quick, simple side dish, easily made with ingredients commonly found in the pantry.

I love this recipe. Very simple and most of the ingredients are usually on hand. It is a great basic recipe for a side dish. I also have modified it by adding chicken and a little bit of corn starch to thicken up the sauce and it was a great main dish with rice on the side.

I was very skeptical about this recipe but because of the reviews I thought it was worth a try and boy am I glad that I did! This is by far the best asparagus recipe that I have ever had the pleasure of eating. I did however as others did, have to add a little water to steam the asparagus some to make it tender. This recipe paired well with BBQ'd teriyaki salmon and rice

Excellent side dish; there were no leftovers. Used olive oil instead of sesame oil. I agree that more than 4 minutes are required to stir fry the asparagus, even if you don't want them cooked all the way through. Will definitely make this again!

I used very young, thin asparagus but still had to put a little water in the pan and cover it for a minute or two in order to have it cooked through enough. The 4 minutes just stir fying it didn't do it. All in all, however, it turned out very good and I agree it is easy and a very nice recipe.

This dish is simple and tastes great. It was the perfect, easy to make, side for a simple baked salmon with teriyake sauce. I will make this again and again.

This is a an excellent, fast and easy to make recipe. I used white asparagus instead, which is a little more exotic. I liked the crispness of the asparagus, but it depends on how you like your veggies. Girlfriend loved this, and she said she abhors asparagus (took me about 15 minutes to get her to try it, but when she did, she ate it all). Over all, a great side to grilled steak.

I liked the asparagus, but I would cook it differently next time. The asparagus either needs to be stir-fried longer or you need to blanch the asparagus first. They were a little too crisp. But the flavor was excellent. I'll definitely make this again.

Very well received. I could hardly stop picking at the leftover asparagus. Of course the asparagus I used came from the asparagus field and was picked in such a way that no trimming was necessary, fat pieces and all. It was tender and delicious.

Delicious! What a change from the steamed with butter asparagus that seems the norm. My asparagus was fresh from the farmers market..the diagonal cuts picked up the soy and made a nice contrast to the green. I agree with another reviewer, almost any fresh green item will benefit from this sauce combo. The only modifications were that I toasted the sesame seeds in the pan first and added a squeeze of lemon juice to the sauce before stir frying. This is definitely a keeper.

I really liked this. However, one change is strongly recommended: 1. Do not use fat pieces of asparagus. If necessary use only the tips. The big round pieces do not get tender.

Great change from the usual steamed with butter and lemon asparagus! Delicious without the sesame seeds, in case you are out of them like I was!
