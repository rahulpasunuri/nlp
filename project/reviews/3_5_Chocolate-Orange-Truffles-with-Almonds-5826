I made four kinds of truffles from this web site and these were my favorite. I agree with other reviewers that they did not have as much orange flavor as exected/desired.

These were not as elegant as I was hoping for. I didn't have the problem with the amount of orange flavor, but if I were to make it again I would use higher quality chocolate, not just grocery store stuff.

I used a block of vanilla dark chocolate for these and they turned out great. I also added more orange zest than called for after reading the reviews, and my hand slipped when pouring the liquer, so probably 3 or 4 tablespoons ended up in there.... but they were really really good and everyone loved them.

Was not greatly impressed with this recipe. Guests liked it, but were not wowed. Like the previous reviewer, I didn't think there was much orange taste. Not sure if I would make these again. One thing, they were easy to make.

This recipe has become one of the 13 desserts served at our Christmas Eve Provencal Dinner. Everyone loves the truffles. For those who are allergic to nuts, I just dust more cocoa, or add colored sugars.

Fantastically easy to make and taste divine (very rich). Next time I will add more orange peel (2+ tbsp.) for they were not as orangey as I would have preferred.
