Excellent! and beautiful! I agree to cut down the oil and watercress to 1/4c oil and 2 bunches watercress. It is fabulous. Do try!!

This is a delicious crunchy salad - and holds up surprisingly well! I enjoyed the leftovers today. Very healthy and refreshing.

The walnuts and tomatoes definitely make this dish! It was a tasty, full salad. Use the dressing sparingly though, our watercress ended up tasting more like mustard than watercress.

This dish was very flavorful and colorful, a big hit at a potluck. I agree with "a cook from Chicago" that the recommended amount of watercress overwhelmed the beans. I didn't have walnut oil; olive oil (and a bit of almond extract) was great.

A great summer salad! The walnuts are a great addition for texture and a very attractive salad with the cherry tomatoes. Delicious!!

My guests and I definitely enjoyed this dish. It is very "summery," and the flavors blend together well. I didn't find the walnut oil that interesting, however. I think I will use a good quality olive oil in the future. This will give the dish more zip. Although the dish was ymmy, it needs a little more zip. Maybe a splash of lemon juice and/or rice vinegar (in addition to olive oil) will help.

Fabulous!! However, I changed the proportions because I think they were a little off in the recipe. I recommend: 1 1/2 lbs of beans, 3 bunches of watercress, 1 C walnuts, and 1 1/4 C of cherry tomatoes. And I used walnut oil. Keep all the other measurements the same. I will definately make this again!! It was very fresh tasting!

This salad was so easy and yummy! I substituted spinach and put in a smaller amount of arugula. Also made it with spinach and watercress and it was equally as good. The dijon dressing with the green beans is a great combination!
