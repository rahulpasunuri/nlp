I made this recipe as per instructions and followed them exactly. It didn't turn out at all like any pastry I've ever made before. I feel there is too much butter in it. It was VERY greasy. I persisted in making it, baking it, and when the pie was cooked, the pastry was the equivalent of shortbread, only nowhere near as nice. Next time I'll check out a different flaky pastry recipe, or for that matter I might even try a short-crust pastry dough instead.
