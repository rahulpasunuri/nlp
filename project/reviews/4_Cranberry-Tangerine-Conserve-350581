Outstanding side dish. Simple as pie and a fantastic flavor. My guests screamed for more!

An explosion of flavor.. that is the reaction my tastebuds had at the first bite of this interesting conserve. Easy to prepare! My four year old grandson and I had a great time putting this together on Thanksgiving morning. I had a hard time trying to get the rind off with a peeler so I just took a piece of the peel off, scraped all the white pith off and it worked out quite well.
