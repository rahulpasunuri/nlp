Three words sum up this recipe; fresh, simple & healthy. I didn't find the dressing too oily as others did. I doubled the recipe & added a little (1 tsp) of honey to cut the acid of the lemon. I also pulsed the prepared dressing in a food processor so it could be tossed with some greens as well. Grilled the Halibut and placed on the bed of greens, drizzled the sauce on top, with a side of quinoa - delish.

Quite good. Quick and easy with ingredients I had on hand when I needed an unplanned dinner, fast. Used flash-frozen and water-thawed halibut steaks from Costco and they were tender and nice. Go easy on the salt; the capers, even drained, bring some to the sauce and I barely salted (kosher) and peppered the halibut before saute. I won't add extra salt next time.

We really loved this dish! We used fresh catch fish instead of halibut, in this case mahi, and to the salsa verde I added the juice of one lime. Other than that I stuck to the recipe and it was absolutely delicious! I will definitely make this again and again.

This was definitely fast and easy. Perfect recipe for those of us still learning to be comfortable cooking fish. I served it by piling some mesclun mix on my plate and adding some chopped basil. I positioned the halibut atop, and then spooned on the salsa verde. I added some tomato wedges around the sides for color and give the salad a little more life. Only one problem: I wanted more of the salsa as my "dressing." I'll double the recipe next time.

Delicious and simple, making it a second time tonight. Worth 3 /12 forks

A little too oily, as mentioned. However, my fiance, whom I have to force to eat fish, said he wished there was more.

Stunningly easy and extremely tasty.

The salsa was a bit too oily, definitely cut it back. I'd up the proportions of the lemon and cilantro, maybe salt too. The wife loved it, we will definitely make it again. Nice and quick.

This recipe was easy and tasted fantastic. I made the salsa verde in the small bowl of my food processor by chopping the whole herbs and garlic together, then adding the lemon zest, lemon juice and olive oil. I pulsed in the capers briefly at the end. It took no more than 5 minutes tops. I will definitely make it again.

LIKed the salsa flavor. Think it is a bit too oily so next time will try cutting back on the amount of olive oil.

This is a nice, summer fish dish--it feels like you're dining on the Mediterranean. My husband liked it more than I did, but I'll make it again. We grilled the fish, which gave it an extra layer of flavor.

Thought this was very good. The salsa verde came out nice - although I doubled the lemon juice. I felt I didn't cook the halibut through enough. I should have browned it more...but I was afraid to overcook.

Made this for some friends and they liked it so much, they asked me to make it the last time they came over! It is so easy and you can mix up the salsa ahead of time. Works well w/ any fish-obviously, the fresher the fish the better the dish.

This sauce is really yummy and such a treat because it's so easy to prepare from ingredients I usually have on hand (when does that ever happen)! I followed the recipe exactly except used the whole lemon zest.

I've put this meal into my regular dinner rotation. Its so easy, and I love the sauce. Its quite garlicky (well its possible that I might add more when I cook it) and tangy and adds lots of flavor. Personally I think the flavors would clash with salmon, but I've made it with mahi mahi and it was great.

I was very excited to try my first halibut dish (eaten or cooked), but found this recipe disappointing. The fish cooked nicely and the sauce tasted okay on its own, but neither did anything for the oother and it was overall pretty bland. Salmon would be so much better with the sauce. Maybe halibut has to be marinated to taste like anything, but I doubt I'll ever spring for it again to find out. The halibut was fresh and cost $12/pound, which is almost twice as much as salmon. Oh well, now I know.

We rarely cook fish but I'm trying to cook it more often. I liked the suggestion to grill the fish so I made double the sauce, marinated the fish for an hour in half of the sauce, cooked it on the barbeque served it with brown rice and green beans with some of the sauce drizzled over the top. We'll definitely have it again!

Each time I've made this dish, I've made the following alterations. It is the best fish ever! 1. Double the garlic 2. Place fish with lemon herb mixture on top and marinate 1 hour in the fridge 3. Heat grill (and slotted grilling surface) to about 400 degrees 4. Put fish on grilling surface (or foil) and close the lid. Cook until fish is flakey, about 20 minutes.

Based on everyone's comments, I tripled the sauce recipe but used only enough olive oil called for in the original version. This was light, easy, healthy and delicious. Also, the sauce is delicious over potatoes as well.

We double double the garlic and halve the oil in the salsa, and always double or triple the entire recipe. Everytime we serve it, guests ask for the recipe. Also good on salmon and shrimp. Makes a great salad dressing -- add more oil and lemon.

easy to prepare and it's exquisite! i add a small shallot and half a tomato too..

Excellent flavor - WHATEVER the sauce is called I would use it on a lot of things. I served the fish with roasted potatoes and everyone was mopping up the sauce with the potatoes. The lemon wedge as garnish is really an afterthought and isn't necessary, although it does add another color on the plate.

Grill the fish instead of frying it. Also, if you have sauce left over, try it on boiled red potatoes.

Very nice summery fish recipe. The green herb sauce really adds zip. Next time, though, I will use less oil. I understand that the oil is there to take the acidic edge off the herbs and lemon, but I think no more than three tablespoons were really necessary. As it was we ended up with oily green puddles on our plates. Still, a delicious recipe, and San Francisco is right: this would be a nice dish for guests.

This is a delicious and very easy entree. Elegant enough for a dinner party. The confusion about the "salsa verde", is the name. This is actually a classical ITALIAN green sauce eaten with many things - traditionally with boiled beef (often fresh beef brisket). Sometimes anchovies are added to it.

The lemon, capers, garlic, olive oil, parsley and cilantro are your salsa verde. Salsa Verde refers to the green of the parsley and cilantro. I know it is not a tradional mexican salsa verde, but that is what they are refering to by the name.

Actually, this time Gourmet didn't publish an accompanying salsa verde recipe, but there are several salsa verde recipes on the site that would probably go quite well.
