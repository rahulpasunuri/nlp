This was very tasty and quick. Had some heritage Sand Pears from north Florida - crunchy and sweet. Got a "hanging loin" from WF - it's the same part that makes a Hangar Steak, but they hadn't trimmed it yet. $7.99/lb instead of something ridiculous for tenderloin (beef has gotten very expensive!), and quite good. Followed the stir fry suggestion made by previous commenter, but added a cup of broth just before serving since sauce looked skimpy.

One of our all time favorites! Quick, easy, delicious, spicy and tangy. The broth is wonderful and the pear a refreshing accent and flavor. I make it at least once a year, and it's about that time again...

Ok, I'll be the odd one out here. I made this last night didn't like it at all. Yes, it was very quick and easy to make, but I found that 1/2 C. rice vinegar was way too much. I like tang, but this gave me a stomach ache, and I had to throw the whole thing out. If I were to make this again, I'd start out with 1/8-1/4 C. vinegar and go from there.

This is delicious and easy. It's got a nice sweet-and-sour flavor. It is a perfect mid-week fall or winter dinner--the hot pepper flakes leave you feeling warmed up!

As a soup, I found this dish to be good, but not outstanding. However, the second time I made it, I turned it into a stir fry by taking the beef out of the marinade and searing in a hot wok with some sesame oil. Once the meat was nicely seared, I put the marinade in the wok with the beef and heated to boiling, allowing it to reduce a bit. At the last minute I added the pears and scallions. I put the prepared noodles in the bottom of deep bowls and put the stir-fry beef with the sauce over the noodles. Heaven!

This recipe is a perfect weeknight dinner. It's simple to prepare but the flavors are fabulous and it presents like you put a lot mre work into it than it actual is. This has become a favorite in our household and I wouldn't change a thing!

I agree with the cook from San Diego that I was a little apprehensive using filet mignon on a new "soup" recipe, but it really added to the wonderful flavor and texture of this dish. My friends and I loved it.

This was not only quick, but impressive in presentation, and packed with flavor! It was spicy(!), but so unique and DELICIOUS! I was a bit hesitant to buy filet (because of the price) for a new recipe - particularly a soup-type dish, but I am so glad that I did! This is fabulous!!
