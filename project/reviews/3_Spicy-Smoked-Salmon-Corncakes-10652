Did anyone leave the salmon out and serve it on top of the sour cream?

I have made this repeatedly to rave reviews. I make them small as hors d'oeuvres or as main entree. Adding capers is a good idea.

very good - but a lot of work.

I served this as a brunch appetizer and my guests really liked it. I agree that it could use a little more salmon. If you're looking for a recipe that has a strong salmon taste, this isn't it. But it does have a nice blend of flavors.

Made this dish for Thanksgiving brunch. Doubled the recipe, tripled the salmon and added some cumin. Everybody loved it! My husband says "Nice tooth". Whatever that means. I'll definitely make this again ...and thank my lucky stars that I have such an able food chopper.

I thought this dish was fantastic served with over-easy eggs. I gave it a 2 though since I modified the recipe. I left out the fresh corn since I thought it would probably be too strong of a flavor compared to the salmon, used more salmon than the recipe called for and added about 2 Tbs capers. All my guests raved!!

The smoked salmon was lost in this recipe.

Really good recipe, though I did use additional spices (ground pepper, dash of hot sauce, oregano). I think it would have been too bland as written.

I thought it was just a little dry and unflavorful.

Made for Mother's day brunch for my wife. Turned out great and tasted wonderful even to non-salmon fans.
