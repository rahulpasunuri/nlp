I had eaten a similar dish in a Greek restaurant in NYC, and fell in love with them. I made these with the hope that they might be as good, and was thrilled to find that they were. A super easy dish to prepare; my friends gobbled these up at a pot luck dinner and begged for more.

A healthier version is to bake them: Preheat oven to 425. Slice zucchini, dip in milk then a mixture of bread crumbs and shredded parmesan cheese. Place on a cookie sheet that has been coated with cooking spray and bake for 1/2 hour. We love these!

I didn't have a deep fat thermometer or a vegetable slicer, so I was surprised that this recipe worked so well. A cheese plane works nicely as a substitute for the slicer. To help the flour stick, I dipped the zucchini in ice water before dredging in flour. In addition to the salt, try sprinkling a few drops of Basalmic vinegar on the chips before serving. Yummy! Almost like the chips served at a local Italian restaurant.

To answer the previous reviewer, one way to have the batter stick is to add egg. Another option is the way we make these things in India, which is use chickpea flour (instead of all-purpose) and water. The measures (if you're interested) are 1 tablespoon rice flour for crispness, 1/2 cup chickpea flour,1 tsp salt, 1 tsp cayenne -- water till batter consistency.

I would make this recipe again if I could get some suggestions on how to keep the batter on the zucchini chips - we had this at a local restaurant as an appetizer and it was excellent - served with marinara sauce - I was so excited to find it here - but..there is something missing - help????
