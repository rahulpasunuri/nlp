Funny how the simplest things are often the best. Served this with sauteed swiss chard and redskin potatoes....yummy.

Good. Easy. Steak lovers will love this recipe. I served with the mixed olive relish and it was a nice accompaniment

Have not made this yet, was looking for cooking times for a porterhouse. Suggestion for those without mortar & pestle.....take peppercorns and make a papertowel envelope or whatever, just as long as they don't fall out. Use a rolling pin....it works great!

How can you go wrong with pepper and steak? Definitely a classic. For those without a mortar and pestle, put the peppercorns into a ziploc freezer bag or double-bag them in thinner sealable plastic bags, and whack it with a skillet or something hard. It will start to tear the bag, but the peppercorns do get crushed. I can't imagine trying to crush them with a skillet out on the table or cutting board!

Simplicity is best with steaks. To the reader that wanted to suit up in armor before crushing the peppercorns with a skillet, try your coffee grinder instead (a few pulses should do it).

Ahh, the porterhouse. A standard cut of meat prepared in a superior recipe is hard to find, but this simple set of instructions seems to bring out just the perfect balance of sensual taste and hard-core peppercorn blast, searing the back of my long tongue with its fiery flavor.

This was very good, but I had to provide everyone with armor while I tried to crush peppercorns with the "bottom of a heavy skillet". Despite my best efforts, I was spraying peppercorn bullets everywhere. It was most unmanageable. Will definitely invest in a mortar and pestle before I make this again.

Awesome quality meat is key, but if so, simple no frills steak flavor explodes with each bite. As good as top quality steak house at a fraction of the cost. Use wood chips to bbq for a mellow flavor touch.

this is an excellent, easy way to serve the king of steaks...a good merlot or late harvest zinfandel makes the meal.....bon appetit..
