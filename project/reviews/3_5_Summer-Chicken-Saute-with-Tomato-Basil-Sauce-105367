I never thought that Tomatoes and Basil can be such great friends :) This combo made the chicken breast deliciously great. I added a bit of olives and more than one Shallots, it was very good.

I also added some kalamata olives since I was low on capers and pounded the chicken breasts as the other reviewer suggested along with adding garlic. I didn't have white wine and added red. Is this the same recipe now? I don't know but my husband loved it. Next time I'll try it with more capers and the white wine. I always pound the chicken breasts, otherwise they never seem to cook in the pan when there isn't sauce.

Easy and excellent!

really good for how easy and quick it is! my boyfriend doesn't like capers, so I used chopped pitted kalamata olives and olive brine instead. I pounded the chicken breasts thinner, added 3 cloves of garlic and about a half teaspoon of red pepper flakes, as suggested by other reviewers and it was well-seasoned. I served it with trader joe's 'just penne' (microwave ready in 2 minutes) and arrugula with simple vinagarette and dinner was ready in about a half hour. so easy and perfect for a weeknight!

I have made this recipe regularily since it originally appeared in the magazine. Always delicious.

My husband enjoyed this recipe. However, I would have preferred a bit bolder taste - perhaps adding dried red pepper flakes

This was easy and delicious. I followed the other recommendations and added some garlic. It was simple but very good - a perfect summer dinner. I will definitely be making this again.

Easy to make, delicious flavours (love the capers--don't skip the brine!!!). Fresh tomatoes really make the dish exceptional, but I have used canned and it was still delicious!

This was pretty good, even better the next day. Used thin chicken beasts. Followed recipe as written.

I made this yesterday and followed recipe as written except I added garlic and some crushed red pepper, and it was soooooo good. I used canned tomatoes to save time and they were fine. I'll make this again

Great! I pounded the chicken flat and lightly dredged in flour (which I think helped the sauce to thicken up a bit). The tomatoes at the store looked "iffy", so I used one can of petite-diced tomatoes instead. Added some garlic, skipped the brine and gave it a fresh squeeze of lemon at the end. Easy, delicious and a crowd pleaser.

I made this tonight--student cooking for one--and it was great! Left out the capers, added a bit of garlic and balsamic vinegar as others suggested and it was terrific. I will certainly make it again as it was so quick and easy.

We thought this recipe was good after a few modifications: added 2 cloves chopped garlic; substituted 2 T chopped white onion for the shallots; doubled the quantity of basil. Served the dish over steamed rice with a side dish of zucchini - a healthy and delicious dinner.

As suggested before, I substituted a can of petite diced tomatoes for ripe tomatoes. I also used thin and fancy chicken breast cuts, which were perfect for this dish. This is definitely a redo!

Just made this recipe and it is, according to my husband, "a keeper". I used canned diced tomatoes which made the recipe even more simple and served it over cappelini with spinich on the side. Truly simple and delicious!

I loved the simplicity of this dish...for those who thought it was bland...try a splash (1 1/2 TBSP) of Balsamic Vinegar

l substituted green olives for the capers and used canned tomatoes (w/ the juice) - in the future l may not use all of the juice. l also used the suggestion to add red pepper and garlic - it was yummy! l sservedit over cous cous to soak up all the juices.

This is a great recipe! Easy to make and very tasty while still being healthy and low-fat. Everyone that I made this for raved about it. Perhaps the other reviewers did not make the dish correctly...?

It's a good recipe for those that may not like spicy foods. The colors give it a nice presentation, but I'm not sure it had enough flavor for me to make again.

I wasn't impressed with this one (nor was my husband). we thought it was bland and kind of dreary. Maybe it would improve with fresh garden tomatoes in the summer but with store bought (organic)it just was blah. The leftovers were better a few days later.

We really enjoyed this dish. It is an easy and delicious recipe to make during the week. Before cooking,I pounded the chicken thin and dredged it in flour. I served it over linguine with some Parmesan cheese. Most of the liquid evaporated after I boiled it, so I might add some chicken broth next time.

This was easy and quick to prepare - good too! I added some garlic and crushed red pepper flakes. Served it with some doctored up orzo. A winner.

Good,easy - orzo is the perfect side

Very quick and tasty. I pounded the chicken first and then sliced it into strips (our favorite way of preparing chicken breast.) However, since the chicken was a little bit dry next time we will use boneless skinless chicken thighs. The sauce has loads of flavor. The orzo with olives tasted nice - perhaps a sprinkling of fresh chopped parsley to make it look even better. We already planning to do this again for a family get together next month.

Great recipe - easy to make -- interesting twist (quite by accident) use green peppercorns instead of capers - (grabbed the wrong bottle) - recipe turned out great regardless.

Rating: 3
Quick, easy and tasty weeknight entree. Being a garlic lover,I added a little! Served it with Orzo Salad w/Feta, Olives & Bell Peppers (BA 10/1997), great light dinner. To the previous reviewer, sounds like a whole new recipe?? Why bother rating this one.........

After searing bone-in chicken breasts, I add 1/4 chopped onion. Scrape brown bits then add 1/2 cup wine, 2 cloves chopped garlic, 2 cups tomatoes in can, capers, brine liquid and 1/4-1/2 tsp red pepper flakes. Saute for 10 minutes then add the chicken for another 10 minutes. Keep chicken warm on plate then add chopped basil to sauce and simmer for five more minutes and you have an exceptional entree w/angel hair pasta or fresh linguine!! Truly awsome!

very good -- light, fresh, and easy. i served this with the orzo w/olives and pepperoncini as suggested. the orzo and olives were perfect, but the pepperoncini was a little overwhelming to me -- too many strong flavors. otherwise, very yummy.

I used the tomatoes and basil from my garden for this recipe. I thought it was great and my husband liked it too! It's a keeper. P.S. To Chicago: I assumed the "caper brine" was the juice in the caper jar.

I haven't made this yet, but I would like a question answered before I do: My husband hates capers. Can I make this recipe without them? Also, what is caper brine?

A great recipe for the gardener-chef. I was able to utilize much of the crop from my garden, spend little time in the kitchen and impress the husband!
