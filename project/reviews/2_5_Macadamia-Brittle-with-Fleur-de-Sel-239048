Great taste, terrible results. I followed the recipe EXACTLY and it never became "brittle". It was more like taffy. Big waste of expensive ingredients.

I thought this recipe was great. It was quick and easy to make and the results are very delicious! Only adjustment I made was to use vanilla-infused sugar. The fleur de sel is the PERFECT touch. :)

Wow, cannot believe the previous review. I've made this recipe for some pretty sophisticated foodies who think this brittle was great! In fact, I'm making it again for a dinner party this weekend. Its a good side to serve with dulce de leche ice cream for a quick finish to a meal.

Would have given zero forks if that was an option... This is simply one of the worst recipes I have ever tried. I have made several brittles before, but this one - the recipe and the brittle - all went right into the trash can!
