Never made a souffle before and this turned out great!..even without the specified ingredients. Got raves! Used all Dungeness Crab, roasted my own red pepper, green onion for shallot and beer for wine. Also, didn't finely 'chop' main ingredients.

Very good. A little labor intensive cracking crab, but worth the effort. DH kept asking how I made the crust. No crust just nice crunch.

This was my first savory souffle ever...and a huge hit! Made it in individual ramekins and came out with 6 very generous portions. Go heavy on the cayenne for a bit of kick.

Very tasty, made a beautiful crust. I substituted scallops for the crab meat. It looked like the sauce was way too thin, but the eggwhites held up well. (I added cream of tartar, can't recall if the recipe said to do that.)

Wow! What a winner! Smooth and elegant. I added the zest of one lemon, a pinch of nutmeg and mixed in some grated cheddar along with the parmessan. I also sprinked some on top before baking. I fire roasted my own peppers and only used 3 large eggs and it still came out great. I baked it in individual ramekins in a pan with boiling water halfway up. Before serving, I unmolded and drizzled them with a tangy lemon and thyme beurre blanc. (I omitted the tarragon). The next day I reheated the leftovers in their ramekins and I'll be darned if they weren't even better than the night before. I served it as a starter with a mesclun salad and a California Chardonnay. Lovely, indeed.

This just did not work for me. I thought it was very bland and certainly not worth the expense.

The crab flavor was wonderful, but didn't really see what the shrimp added to the recipe (other than texture?). My 11 year old son had three helpings so I would call it a hit!

My first soufflé and it was perfect! I used ramekins (about 1/4 pint) instead of the small dishes suggested, and it was great as a starter for 8 people. I also substituted lobster for the shrimp - it came out with a lovely rich and meaty flavour. I'm making it again tonight for another 8 people.

I am a novice when it comes to souffles, however this dish turned out perfectly. I used the small souffle dishes as opposed to the one large one. My husband was amazed at my success. I will make this again. My only change will be to cut down on the amount of salt added as the crab and the cheese are are quite salty.

I made individual soufflees -- half of them rose, half did not. My husband loved this recipe. I liked it alright, but there are so many other terrific souffle out there, that I don't know if I'll make this again.

Simple to prepare, elegant to eat, it put my main course to shame. Everyone wanted more.
