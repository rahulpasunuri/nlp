Replaced the clove with fresh grated ginger, swapped lime juice for lemon and increased the black pepper... delicious!

Very good as it is, at home we improve it as follows: use a one spoon less butter, which we substitute by olive oil. Instead of water, chicken stock. Half cup orange juice and 4 spoons lemon (or lime) juice. But still, we've also made it exactly as written and it was a big success. The changes came gradually because we make the soup so much at home.

I make this recipe frequently and serve it chilled. I use ghee--clarified butter-- instead of whole butter because of lactose intolerance, but you need a little less than the recipe with butter. The one thing I wanted to add about this is that my toddler really liked it on first try. I don't know how he'll feel about it this year when cold soup season rolls around, but he loved it his second summer. Guests like it too, but they are easier to please!

Sooooo good. Works best if you cut the oj to half a cup, and add extra tablespoon of cream.

We liked it cold, but I did thin it out with a little cream right before serving. (Extra fat, but it smoothed out the consistency nicely.) My husband thought the orange was a bit too intense...next time I will use a third less orange juice and add vegetable stock in its place.

I would make this again. However, I would serve it warmed. The flavors seemed to be more intense.

Don't have this soup chilled - it just doesn't taste good. I served it for a dinner party and ended up heating it up at the last minute as the consistency (thick) isn't right for drinking cold, in my opinion. I made it with homemade chicken broth instead of water which gave it more depth, but I think I'll be giving this recipe a wide berth next time I make a chilled soup.
