Followed Isabelle's suggestions, but added rice milk instead of cows milk. Also added a glob of coconut oil. And subbed ground cinnamon and nutmeg for the cardamom. Had a nice, subtle flavor.

I did some doctoring to this recipe , particularly after reading the comments previously posted. It was delicious. First, I bought 3 fresh rutabagas from the local farmers market. 1. Peeled and cut the rutabagas into large chunks (no need to cube). 2. Boiled in water with kosher salt and cardamon (ground, didn't have pods). Added a bit extra of spices to the boiling water. Took less than 25 minutes to cook. 3. Didn't want to haul my cuisinart out so used kitchenaid blender on puree setting. 4. Used 1% fat organic milk instead of creme fraiche, added it slowly to the blender mixture. Added dried thyme, didn't have fresh. Mixture consistency was like soft mashed potatoes. This is worth making - no butter, no milk fat, etc and with a mellow buttery sweet taste. And super easy

Easy, but really not worth making. I found it hard to bring out any flavor and eventually wound up ruining it, just trying to make it taste like something

I made this for Thanksgiving last year and it was a hit. Even my cousin, who is the pickiest eater ever, asked for seconds. I couldn't find cardamom pods, so I used ground instead, and a little more salt. It was delicious.

I made this for Thankgsiving last year and it was fabulous. Even my cousin who is the pickiest eater in the world asked for seconds. If you find it a bit bland, just up the spices. I used ground cardamom and found it to be a fine substitute. About 2 teaspoons.

Easy to make but needed more flavor.
