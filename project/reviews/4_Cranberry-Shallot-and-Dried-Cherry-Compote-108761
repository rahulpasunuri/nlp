Yummy! I think next time I will use shallots though.

Phenomenal - love it. This is the second year in a row I've made it for thanksgiving, and everyone always seems to love it. I do find blanching the shallots totally unnecessary though. Next time I won't bother.

This recipe made a believer out of me. I made it for my first Thanksgiving meal for my family, and honestly, it was one of the best parts of the table -- such a good complement to turkey and potatoes. I've been looking forward to making this again all year. The only change I made was to slice the shallots and slow-caramelize the hell out of them.

While the flavors are rich and balanced, there is something off with the texture of this compote. Puree it and you'll have a fine addition to your Thanksgiving dinner. Part familiar cranberry sauce texture, part nuanced smoky fruity curiosity. I find it ho-hum, but am happy to add the pureed version to my meal (with a fig compote, and a savory shallot/leek compote) because it mirrors something more traditional.

Like so many others once you make it, you cannot help but use it a standard for Thanksgiving (8 years now). It is by far the best cranberry dish I have had, Follow the directions to a T and take your time you will not be dissapointed.

I have made this every Thanksgiving since 1995 and still maintain that it is THE single best cranberry dish I've ever made or tasted. I just finished another batch here on Thanksgiving Eve, 2009. Do NOT use craisins or similar. If you have a Trader Joes nearby, they have a Montmorency tart dried cherry that works great. I find it necessary to add moisture to this dish to keep it saucy. Works great to make ahead.I do not advise using pearl onions as a substitute for shallots. You will miss the depth of flavor that only shallots can give.

This is one of my *favorite* parts of Thanksgiving dinner. I include crystallized ginger, which really adds depth. Also, I recommend using plain dried tart cherries (a company called Just Tomatoes sells them http://www.justtomatoes.com/JCH- P.html) but if you wind up using something like Craisins, etc, you need to reduce the amount of sugar. My experience has been that the "45 minute" simmer often is more like an hour, but this is a perfect "make ahead" dish, so no worries.

This was one of my mom's favorite Thanksgiving recipes. The adults love it (the kids not as much). The aroma is amazing when it cooks.

I've been making this every year since I first saw it. It's a winner!

Great recipe. Because my shallots were to big, I finely chopped and did not blanch the shallots. Also, I could not find dried cherries so I used dried currants. Turned out amazing. Next time, I will cut on the sugar.

Wonderful and worth the work! The subtle savory taste is unique and delicious. Perfect with deep-fried turkey

I have made this every Thanksgiving since 1995. It's a great combination of sweet, savory and a hint of tartness. Dried bing cherries do the trick.

I have made this dish everything Thanksgiving since it was first printed in 1995. It's a great combination of sweet, savory and sour. We love it.

Pucker up! This combination of flavors is savory and very tart. It definitely grows on you, but my guests' initial reaction was, "This is interesting," rather than "This is delicious." I might try it again, and use half of the pearl onions, and possibly another sweet ingredient, such as fresh peaches.

Terrific! It's a standby on Thanksgiving! I love this dish, and it's great leftover with cold turkey and mashed potatoes.

Really good! It was a big hit at Thanksgiving dinner.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was very popular-- definitely better than the canned stuff, and I personally don't care much for the citrusy homemade cranberry sauces. This had a really rich flavor (and amazing smell when it was cooking!), and it was great on sandwiches with leftovers.

We LOVED this dish and I will definitely make it again! It is so much better than the cranberry chutney that I usually make. I am so glad you re-printed it!

Delicious!! A cut above plain old cranberry sauce. It will definitely be a new tradition in our house.

We had a Holloween dinner this year w/ a few friends, and everyone just loved this dish! I gotta tell ya, I think I finally found something my children like more than that boring jellied cranberry sauce in the can! It's a keeper.
