I didn't have chicken breasts - used thighs instead. This dish was a HIT. I served it on a bed of fresh romaine lettuce with a semi-sweet Reisling. I can't wait to share this recipe with more friends !!!!

After eliminating fats and salt from our diet, we found this to be overly salty and greasy for our tastes. I didn't use any salt, only from the bacon and prepared stock. 1 cup chopped onion was too much as was full 1 tsp of oregano. I'm sorry to say, that after being "natural and organic" for the past several weeks, this was, pardon the term, "pollution" for us. I do like the combination of flavors, but, like others have said, I would use less chicken, and eliminate the salt completely. I don't think I will make it again, but it was fun to try.

I too did not enjoy the texture, it was not the almond meal but the bacon - it should have been crisp. So, I spooned 1 tbs or so of mix as prepared onto each breast (I made 3) and then pureed the remaining. It came out smooth and creamy and the flavor was wonderful. I plated the chicken with the tbs of onion mix on top and drizzled the pureed sauce over each. Served with smashed red skins and steamed carrots. And I did simmer the chicken breasts for 35 min...the sauce had cooked down a bit so when I pureed I added another 1/2 cup of stock. My husband loved it.

My boyfriend and I both liked this dish, and that's saying something because my boyfriend can be rather picky. I didn't change anything, and I think that the recipe worked just fine. I didn't mind the texture of the sauce at all. Actually, though, I did change a couple things per other people's suggestions. I used 3 chicken breasts and kept the sauce the same, and I thought that it worked well. I also simmered the chicken for more like 35 minutes, and it turned out nice and falling-apart tender. I mede this dish with Spanish rice and Mexican corn, but I think that it may have even worked better with something not Mexican-themed like mashed potatoes and green beans. I think that we'll probably be making this dish again.

This was fantastic! I've been trying a bunch of chicken dishes from Epicurious and my husband says this is the best so far. The only change I made was to use 3 chicken breasts instead of 6. I was happy to have the extra 'sauce'. Very flavorful and goes perfect with rice or potatoes. Yummmmmm

Delish! A perfect autumn meal. I left out most of the salt & was happy to have done so. We had quite a bit of sauce, so I served it with mashed potatoes, using extra sauce on the potatoes. The sauce is not a 'thin or creamy sauce,' it was enjoyed. I will definately make this again.

i agree with those that halved the chicken but kept the sauce the same, and simmered it for more like 40 minutes, as a note, this recipe also works for pork and tofu. with tofu brown in a pan with oil, then when everything is mixed together turn off the stove and let the tofu marinade in the sauce for 30 minutes before cooking.

i absolutely loved the *taste* of the sauce - bacon, garlic, onions, almonds - what's not to love. BUT i felt the consistency was off. i might not have ground my almonds fine enough, but even so i think next time i might puree the sauce- onions, bacon and all. as suggested by other reveiwers i halved the chicken and kept the sauce as written.

The sauce was good, but better when I added some ground ancho chili powder for an extra smoky dimension. I imagine a little ground chipotle would be good too. And Trader Joe's has almond meal pre-packaged that made for a nice smooth sauce and added convenience - just be sure to toast it. The sauce continues to thicken as it cools, so I added some extra broth to make it stay saucy for rewarms.

Maybe I didn't grind the almonds finely enough. The recipe had a nice nutty feel and was nice with a brown rice...but wasn't all that memorable. Might have benefited from a little cream, butter and extremely fine almonds.

I agree there wouldn't have been enough sauce. I halved the chicken and kept all else the same. Tasted great and was relatively easy and quick. Served with plain rice and frenched green beans. Would definitely make it again.

Loved this Dish. The Cinnamon and Bay Leaf added a very unique flavor to it. I found the Orengeno flavor was perfect. I would recommend increasing the amount of sauce.

Another reviewer suggested doubling up on the sauce. Did it and it really added to my guests' enjoyment of the meal. Hardly anyone left any sauce on their plate. Also suggest that the chicken be allowed to simmer in the sauce longer than the 5-10 minutes in the recipe. I let it simmer for about 45 minutes and the chicken had a "deeper" flavor.

I didn't personally like this dish, it wasn't my taste, but my family loved it. My father said it was already on his favorites list, which is amazing, because the things he likes, are things I can't cook (well) yet. I'd make it again, for my Grandmother and Granfather, and when my family wants it, but other than that, I'd have someone cook it. Haveing to prepare many different things at once got on my nerves.

I really liked this recipe, and, contrary to other reviewers, I loved the texture (I guess it is a matter of taste). The oregano flavor is really strong but I didn't even feel the almonds in the sauce. My husband who is usually very picky loved it, but I should mention he likes oregano a lot.

This was an easy recipe to follow and my husband and I loved the flavors produced by the cinnamon and oregano (wonderful!), but we didn't like the consistency of the sauce- the finely ground almonds created a grainy texture that we really didn't care for that much. Also, I don't think it's necessary to salt the chicken before frying it. If you do, don't add the remaining 1/2 tsp. salt to the sauce, because it turns-out too salty if you do- for our tastes anyway. It's a good recipe to try and I'm sure the creative cooks out there can produce a variation to their liking. Overall, the cinnamon-oregano combination make this dish worth preparing again.

This was wonderful - unusual and not difficult to make, exactly as written (I used stock, not water). I should have doubled the sauce. I served it with "Spanish" rice (saffron rice with onions, peas and tomatoes) but next time will just use plain white as the delicious sauce should stand alone.

This dish was just ok. I enjoy trying new recipes, but I thought this one turned out a little...weird. The ground almonds gave the sauce a funny texture -- not a pleasant one. If I were to make it again, I'd cook the bacon until crisp rather than as the recipe directs. I had to pour off some of the bacon fat because I couldn't stomach the idea of eating it as part of the sauce.

with all of the fancy spices, this recipe turns out an interesting blend of flavors, like nothing ive tasted before. i got good reviews from the crew, but i would be careful serving it to picky people. elegantly different for guests.
