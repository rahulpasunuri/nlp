I made this recipe by hand rather than in a mixer, and while it was sticky in the bowl, I didn't have any difficulty rolling it out and they were nice and flaky. The only things I might add/change is a bit more sugar for sweetness (for my own tastes) and some lemon zest for a bigger flavour profile. Otherwise an easy recipe to make and a tasty accompaniment for tea or coffee.

Enjoyed . . . not overly sweet. Were light. Patted down w/ floured hands (rather than rolling the dough) as it is truly sticky.

sounds like these scones would be better dropped from a large spoon or patted out with floured hands - the less handling the better. I'll probably give this a try.

The recipe wasn't kidding-the dough is VERY sticky. I made a mess trying to roll it out and ended up adding so much extra flour that the scones turned out hard and dry. My prince of a husband ate them anyways and gave me a big kiss so all was not lost.
