This is a delicious sweet potato dish. I was looking for something different and this was a knock out. My only apprehension, this is a not a traveling dish - definitely stovetop to table. I had a bit of trouble getting the sweet potato to crisp. I ended up them frying in oil after roasting. The vinaigrette with bacon and scallions is a surprisingly great flavor with the sweet potatoes. Will absolutely make this next time I host TDay if not before.

This one is now a family standard for Thanksgiving. I've done it for probably the last four years, and have never looked back! It deserves many more forks than the system permits.

Hands down, the most amazing dish on the Thanksgiving table this year. (And the turkey was the best ever!!) Even my teenaged son said, with wide eyes, "Mom, I officially love sweet potatoes." I really browned the spears, which I think added to the flavor.

My family loves this recipe; the bacon adds a huge savory element and the vinegar kicks it up a notch. This recipe is going in the top of the box for me to pull out whenever I'm looking to dazzle my company. I'm making them for the second time tomorrow. Quite simply fabulous.

I overcooked these in my convection oven - will watch more carefully next time - but once we scraped off the charred bits, they were really good. Such a relief after eating candied sweet potatoes with marshmallows at countless potlucks. These are grownup sweet potatoes!

Hands down one of the best recipes I've ever tasted. This has become a family favorite for Thanksgiving and Christmas.

Delicious! It's my staple for potlucks now. I have done with bacon fat and peanut oil and both taste good- when in a pinch I use real bacon bits instead. A bit of cinnamon helped last time too.

Tasty way to make sweet potatoes though I had a hard time flipping them w/o destroying them. I chose to do the less fattening version w/ peanut oil instead of bacon fat and added two tablespoons of maple syrup to the vinagrette. I even used red wine vinegar instead of sherry vinegar. Easy and tasty. Just another way to make sweet potatoes and works nicely if you want to tweak the recipe.

I made these last year for Christmas and will be again this year. Even the veggie haters in my family were lured in by the bacon.

I was underwhelmed by this recipe. It was ok, not bad but not distinctive. I made it for Thanksgiving and no one even noticed it. Not worth the effort.

I made these for Thanksgiving as an alternative to traditional candied. It was a big hit. Good flavor, good presenation and easy preparation means great recipe. I did most of the roasting the night before as someone else suggested. They were wonderful.

I made this dish tonight, I didn't have time to make the dressing so I sprinkled the potatoes with cayenne pepper after spreading them on the cookie sheet and served them with ranch dressing. Yummmy. P.S. Put the cooked bacon in the mashed potatoes, yum again!

Wonderful! The sweet potatoes really do brown perfectly and remember to use Kosher salt. It really is great at complimenting the sweet flavor. Next time I will experiment with different flavored vinegars. It will be in my everyday menus now.

Loved it. Everybody loved it. A sure hit.

The combination of sweet from the potatoes, salt from the bacon, and tang from the vinegar makes this recipe a keeper for me. I love sweet potatoes, and thought this might just be gilding the lily, so to speak, but MAN it is worth it! Try this!!

These were a hit on Thanksgiving, but I must admit, I did monkey with the recipe a little. When I tasted the viniagrette, I thought it needed a hint of sweetness. I added about two tablespoons of grade B maple syrup. They were terrific! They also brown soooo nicely in the oven, they were downright picturesque!

Even my super-picky 13 year old loves these sweet potatoes.

This recipe is great. Even My friends who hate sweet potatoes loved it. I did use a pound of bacon and used all the bacon fat i could find.

This recipe was excellent! Surprisingly, the potatoes were really good the next day. They didn't even need to be warmed up!

I don't understand the rave reviews. Sweet potatoes are naturally delicious and, in my opinion, suffer from the addition of fatty bacon. I would not make these again.

This recipie makes delicious sweet potatoes. Ive made the recipe exactly as written and also as a healthier version - eliminating the bacon and using peanut oil to coat the potatoes before they go into the oven and in the dressing at the end. It is really good this way as well.

This was very good and everyone enjoyed it. I made it the day before by roasting the potatoes but left a little underdone. Popped them in the oven for a about 15 mins to finish roasting. Easy and delicious
