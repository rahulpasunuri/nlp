This recipe was so disappointing I took the time to register with Epicurious in order to voice my opinion. I am an experienced cook, from a long family line of bakers and cooks and I know the important steps in working with custards. However the end result of this frozen custard was flavorless and thin (like a fudgesicle)Next time I will use my favorite ice cream recipe and flavor each batch accordingly.

as an experienced ice cream/sorbet/gelato maker, I found this recipe to be one of the best. the trick is not undercooking the custard and straining after chilling.

Using my new ice cream maker for the first time, this recipe proved disappointing. I made only the pistacio and while the flavor was ok, the texture was poor and unlike any frozen dessert that I've encountered. Basically, the consistency was like a partially frozen (after 5 hours in the freezer) semi-solid custard. Prepared for Christmas Eve dessert, I was dismayed to see it uneaten on most dessert plates.
