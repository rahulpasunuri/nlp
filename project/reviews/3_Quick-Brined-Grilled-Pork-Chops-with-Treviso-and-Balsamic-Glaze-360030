I thought this recipe was really solid. I'd offer a few modifications. First, I had the good fortune of postponing this meal by a day, letting the pork chops brine overnight in ziplock baggies. They turned out incredibly tender. Second my store was out of endive, so I substituted baby bok choi which was fantastic, even better than the radicchio. Also to note, I don't have a grill, so I oven roasted the veggies and pan fried the pork chop. Still turned out great.

I was not all that thrilled with this recipe. The pork chops were still fairly tough and seemed very salty. Was the brine supposed to be rinsed off? If so, it wasn't apparent from the recipe. Of course, we don't eat a lot of salt but still.....Butter and balsamic vinegar are always nice but I don't think that the brine added anything.

This is a great quick brinning method. The chops were succulent.

The glaze was very sour. I guess super market brand balsamic wasn't good eough.

I've now made variations of this meal three times, and I love it. I'd never tried brining or quick-brining, and it worked out so well with each different pork chop. I highly recommend grilling, though broiling and pan sauteing would work too. For sides, I've made risotto (lemon was a good match) and roasted potatoes.

This was fine - I didn't think the brine made that much of a difference. The meat was still a little dry, and I even let it soak in the brine a little longer than the suggested time. Cooked the meat over a cast iron indoor grill. Served with warm roasted tomatoes.

I live in NYC and therefore can't grill. I tried this recipe using a cast iron skillet and then the oven to finish the pork chops. The balsamic glaze on the chops was nice, but the veggies were not so impressive - bland a still a little bit bitter.

These chops were perfect, moist, tender, and very tasty! Followed the recipe closely, including rinsing the chops after the brine as others suggested. Did not add as much salt as recommended to chops or glaze and everything was very good. I kept the chops in the brine for about an hour. The glaze was very pungent while cooking but added so much flavor it was worth the strong smell. I skipped the radicchio and endive as I had none. This was simple and declicious.

I just made this for dinner tonight. The pork chops came out fabulous!! I don't know that I'll mess with grilling the radicchio and endive again but the pork is so easy and moist.

Didn't read the review and rinse before cooking. Definitely will try that next time, as it was pretty salty.

Fabulous. We used thick boneless loin chops, left them in the brine for an hour, and rinsed them before grilling. They came out tender, juicy and not at all dry. The balsamic glaze was very tasty.

I am not usually a pork-chop-fan, but this was fabulous. Very tender and moist. I made this as-written, the balsamic glaze was awesome and I grilled the endive and radicchio (first time I had bought either) and looooved it! Nice presentation too. I made this as written, with the bruschetta from same issue...

Just used the brine, which was plenty for 6 chops. Did rinse off chops as suggested - then husband grilled on BBQ. Kids LOVED them - tender & juicy with great flavor - sort of a bacon flavor. Kids like the bones as much as the meat!

My husband and I both loved this, although we only tried the pork with the balsamic glaze. I did not have the radicchio or endive so served it with roasted beet salad with oranges and beet greens (Bon Appetit 2004). When I made the pork the second time, I rinsed the meat of the brining solution before patting dry. Otherwise the dish is too salty. I will definitely make this again.

I actually only used the brining technique (due to lack of advance planning on my part which meant I had only 1T of balsamic vinegar). So we prepared the chops using the brining and grilling instructions and ate the chops plain and they were delicious.

The brining technique was ok. But the glaze didn't do for me.
