No rating--significant differences. I used ciabatta and red miso, and didn't bother with the onion or basil. My cheese was extra sharp. This was possible one of the best combinations of flavors I've had in a really long time. Although it's imperative that the miso be spread thinly (I'm sure I used less than a tbsp for each sandwich), the combination of flavors quite literally reminded me of a good wine insofar as its complexity. I was _very_ impressed. This is a great recipe-base and without question worthy of repitition.

Okay, I haven't made the recipe yet, but just as a word about miso -- there are many, many different brands and styles and they vary **A LOT** in flavor and/or saltiness, so if you're not familiar with miso, taste it and adjust the amount according to your preferences!

This was way too salty. I couldn't even finish half a sandwich without drinking a gallon of water. But my husband loved it.

I saw this and thought "Sha right! And monkeys might fly out my butt!" But I tried it and it was fabulous! It seems like an odd combo but the flavors are quite harmonious. I used the thinnest schmear of miso to keep it from being quite so salty.

Thanks for the easy and tasty sandwich recipe! This is a good way to incorporate miso into our diet. I omit basil for I did not want it to overpower miso flavor. I really enjoyed the combination of cheese and miso.

My husband loved this sandwich. The only change I would make is the miso should be a thin coating not a full tablespoon. I can never get enough salt, but my miso at least was too salty. Other than that I used regular sharp cheddar and olive oil instead of the butter. I assembled the sandwiches in advance wrapped them up, then just sprayed them with olive oil before grilling.

Well, this was a pleasant surprise! The creamy miso melded with the flavors of the onion, tomato and basil. The cheese was light--just the right amount to keep the sandwich from tasting too pasty or thick. Definitely a keeper!
