This was lousy, one of those meals where you wish you'd scrapped the whole thing and gotten takeout, but you put in so much effort that you choke it down. The veal was fine/unremarkable, but the eggplant! Silky = a pile of bland mush with a god awful texture. This felt like the kind of meal that would be served to criminals on a deep space prison ship.

The eggplant was perfect - though not enough for 4 people. I couldn't get ground veal so substituted ground turkey, which worked out nicely. Easy, quick meal to make and the eggplant added a nice level of moisture to the cakes.

Haven't made the cakes yet but the eggplant is delicious! And really easy.

Have made this twice and would definitely make again. The dill really adds a nice touch. I leave out the sugar... but I leave sugar out of most things! Quick & easy dish for a weeknight.
