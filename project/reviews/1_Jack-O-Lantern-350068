Realize first that I AM NOT A BAKER but I must say that I am passably talented and things I attempt usually work out for me. That said...this cake was a disaster!! The taste and texture of the cake was great so all was not lost. The rest was a calamity!!!! I could not find the proper cake pan so I followed the directions and purchased two 11/2 quart oven proof pans. The cake took an hour more than the 30 minutes specified. I put the cake together but I did not cut it down enough for it to fit together into a perfect ball shape. I read the reviews from the Creamy White Frosting and opted to try just a decorator's frosting, although I did flavour it with orange. When I tried to frost this stupid cake, it ended up (because of it's shape) dripping off mid point. I stiffened up the frosting and it still would not work. I had to put the cake into the fridge and wait until the frosting already applied hardened up and then proceed again. It looked, at one point, exactly like a round hamburger with that gross processed cheese melted all over it...something maybe out of "Man v. Food" lol. Same went with the green icing when I attempted to pipe it onto the top of the cake...oh, and this is good...as I said I'm not a baker so I did not want to purchase $18 worth of fondant (although in hind sight I would have) that the store had available so I chose instead to do the black gumdrops rolled out. If you roll them too thin they kind of turn greenish. I did this on parchment paper and, of course, they stuck. Too make a long story even longer, do not attempt this unless you have a bit of cake making history to back you up. It is a fiddley, fussy, stress inducing enterprise. I'm sticking to cooking.
