I've made this recipe several times and my family loves it! I buy Lindor truffles instead of making them to save time and effort. This recipe is VERY easy to make and doesn't take much time at all. I highly recommend it!

This was my first attempt ever at making soufflé...and it was amazing! I will definitely be making this again, only to improve on the presentation and a few minor details. Otherwise, this dish is just incredible.

Superb! I've tried several souffles recipe, I think this one is a hit. The best chocolate souffles recipe ever made.

I have been making this ever since it came out in the magazine. It is wonderful. Easy to make ahead in the day and then just pop in the oven after dinner. I have no trouble with then falling! The whiskey truffle is a marvelous "surprise" while indulging in this decadent chocolate bit of heaven! I serve this often to company and get lots of compliments.

I love this recipe. Depending on your mood you can serve it with or without the sauce. I admit that these souffles always fall when I make it... but it doesn't really matter, they taste great fallen or not.

These were a hit at our New Year's Eve Party. We substitued the Whiskey Sauce from the Bread Pudding Souffle on this website and that kept it from being too sweet. It was fabulous, but don't complain that it is too strong -- it is perfect for those who really like whiskey.

I have prepared this dish two times. I buy truffles, which cuts down on the preparation time, and I omit the sauce and top the souffles with whipped cream.

The souffle part of this recipe was good - I used Scharffenberger chocolate. However, I used Jack Daniels Whiskey for the truffle (I did not use whiskey for the souffle as my young children were going to eat it). The alcohol taste was overpowering! Maybe someone else can recommend a different kind of whiskey? I think using Grand Marnier or maybe Bailey's Irish Cream would be delicious.

It is easier just buying chocolate truffles than making them - the souffles were outstanding on their own, my boyfriend and I did not think it needed the caramel sauce.

Definitely a crowd-pleaser! Perfect to make ahead, freeze, then bake when you want to serve. This was the first soufflé recipe I've ever attempted, and it was fabulous! I first saw the recipe online in the Bon Appetit cooking class (with helpful photos): http://eat.epicurious.com/bonappetit/cooking_class/?/bonappetit/cooking_class/souffle.html I either halve the truffle recipe, or double the soufflé recipe. Instead of whiskey, I've used Grand Marnier, Kahlua or Chambord. Grand Marnier seems to be the favorite among our circle. The caramel sauce always takes longer than it says. This recipe helped me overcome my fear of making soufflés. Try it!

This dessert is FABULOUS!!!! So simple for a dinner party.. make it ahead and leave it in the freezer until you start dinner. When you finish dinner, the dessert is ready!

Great dessert! This will be the third time I have prepared the souffles for Christmas Eve dinner for at least 12 people... so easy to prepare ahead of time and then bake during or right after dinner. Everyone is always so amazed by the presentation and taste!

This is one of my favorite recipes to make for dinner parties. It's always a hit. I usually do all the preparation a couple days in advance and then freeze them. They go straight from the freezer to the oven and turn out perfectly everytime. My only suggestion is to cut the truffle portion of the recipe in half, otherwise you end up with too many truffles.
