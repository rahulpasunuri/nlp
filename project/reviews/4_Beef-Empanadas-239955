Few observations in this recipes.is not empañadas is Empanadas. Each province of Argentina has its own version like Cordoba use mashed potatoes. The one describe here is like from Buenos Aires or Porteñas.about eggs wash,not oil, is used if you want to bake them so they become golden brown. The ones you fry takes a little more oil without egg wash. At "Fiesta" or ethnic groceries store you'll find 2 brands of dough "gauchito" from Argentina and Goya Mexican tape dough

I love this recipe! I often use ground turkey instead of beef and bake the empanadas rather than fry them.

Made this recipe using a package of prepared pie crusts by cutting each crust into 5 pieces and rolling them out on plastic wrap. Baked the empanadas on parchment paper (crusts were thin)at 425 degrees for about 25 minutes. Worked very well, were good with a salad for dinner and unheated as a take along lunch with fruit. I also remembered (and found) Picadillo Turnovers or Empanadas de Picadillo in an old Sunset Mexican Cookbook, Lane Publishing, 1971. The filling was very similar and included slivered almonds, no hard cooked egg and prepared pie crusts were used. My notes reminded me that they too were very good.

Can't wait to prepare "Beef Foggies" It's "empanadas" , not "empañadas" The speller does not catch because "empañadas" is a word that exists. It means "foggy"

I would love to make these. However, I have never seen frozen empanadas dough. It would've been great to include a recipe for the dough. I find the baked empanadas are much less greasy.

I don't know about the recipe... but empañada means tarnished or foggy. I believe the title of the recipe should be Empanadas as in the content of the recipe.

Found a mold so decided to make empanadas. Used the dough recipe from epicurious. It was perfect. I followed everyone's advise and doubled the onion, garlic, cumin and oregano. Aside from that, followed everything else. The dough was light and flaky. The filling just right. Baked only a few and froze the rest. These empanadas are better than those sold at the store. Definitely a keeper.

I have longed to make empanadas like those I ate in East Hollywood, California twenty years ago, from a chilean bakery. Warm out of the oven, savory and sweet, they were unforgettable. This recipe had all the right beginnings -- olives, raisins, eggs..... After reading the reviews, I too decided to ramp up the flavor. I started with one whole mdium onion, and 2 cloves of garlic. I doubled the amount of cumin and oregeno, and added a pinch of cinnamon. I hit it with a couple drops of liquid smoke, and a few shakes of Chipotle Tabasco. I used a small handful of raisins, soaked in hot water for 5 minutes. I added a small handful of chopped black olives (what was in my original empanadas), added 3 more cloves of minced garlic to round it off. There didn't seem to be enough tomato, and I didn't have more. So, a judicious squeeze of ketchup (I know! but it worked), and adjusted salt, and it was fabulous. I had purchased the empanada rounds form the store, and initially baked a batch. Ugh!!! Tough, saltine cracker crust! Then I decided to try frying a batch and -- with the temperature held steady at 360 degrees they were awesome! Just the right temperature so that they cook, but don't retain excess oil. They exploded in our mouths -- juicy, fragrant. All were eaten immediately. Next time I might add a bit of chopped green pepper.

My kids don't like raisins and olives, but I wanted to include them. I put the raisins and olives in a food processor, so you wouldn't get an obvious bite of one or the other. The flavor was mixed through and it was delicious! I can't imagine it without the raisin, I added twice the amount and a tablespoon of sugar, also mixed in 2 tablespoons of taco seasoning, my kids, mom and grandparents devoured them, my kids said it was their new favorite food (: I'm making a ton more and freezing them. I'll coat them in egg white and bake next time instead of frying. (also, I used the precooked beef sold in the store, comes in a bag of mexican style sauce, just discarded the sauce)

This recipe, like most others, needed more spices, more onion, more garlic and more salt. It needed a lot more olives--I used 6 less than an entire 5.6 oz jar--and more raisins. I used less tomato. In lieu of the empanada disks that I couldn't find, I used 2 frozen pie crusts, each cut in half, and baked them in the oven So, a rather strangely shaped empanada, but no matter. What this recipe really needs is chimichurri. It was a fine weekday dinner.

Rating: 1
I didn't care for these. They needed a lot more flavor - garlic, olives, raisins, salt, pepper & heat. I think the filling would have been better with cooked butternut squash added, but I didn't have that. I used the Cream Cheese Pastry Dough recipe and added 1/2 tsp pepper to the dough when mixing, baked them, the dough was very good and flaky.

I've never had empanads before, but I thought these were really tasty. Plus my boyfriend loved them, and he hates everything, so big win there! I wouldn't necessarily agree that these are "Quick and Easy", especially if you have to make the dough yourself (my small town grocer doesn't carry empanada dough!). And anything involving frying usually takes more time and makes a big mess, which makes cleaning up more difficult.

Rating: 4
Really exceptional. I made as written, but as 30 appetizer empanadas using 3.5 inch circles and 1/8 of egg per empanada. Doing it this way, you will need to make at least one more egg. Also used the empanada pastry recipe from this site at http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Empanada-Dough-230786 I did need to bake them for longer than 10 minutes, closer to 15 in order for them to become golden in colour. Took them to a dinner party and everyone, including the children, just loved them. As stated by other reviewers, this goes really well with chimichuri sauce. Time consuming, but well worth it if you are in the mood to make food that really can't be rushed.

I have made these several times. Always a hit with guests, accompanied by a chimichurri sauce. I make the Empanada Dough on this site. The filling was made "as is". My seven year-old hovers to get a taste of the filling. Agreed that it needs a little more heavy hand with the garlic and seasonings. After rolling the dough, I use the top of a glass to cut out appetizer-sized and portions. I have always used an egg wash prior to baking but next time I think I'm going to deep-fry them to get that more authentic texture. Perhaps I'll even freeze a few and then reheat on a cake rack in the oven. I will serve again on Christmas Eve.

Really good! I doubled the recipe, added 1/2c chopped green olives and omitted the raisins.

I have a variation that focuses more closely on Greek and Middle Eastern spices (oregano, marjoram, cumin, allspice). I also add feta cheese and spinach to mine. And sometimes, sub cranberries for the raisins.

I followed this recipe pretty much exactly, except I didn't used pimiento stuffed olives - just kalamata, and we baked them instead of frying them. To me the filling was good, but lacked punch. So maybe more salt, just to bring out the flavors that were already in there. I also added lots more garlic than just one clove. In a heavy mixture, one clove will get lost. For baking them, we just put them in a 9x13 with some olive oil on the bottom of it and sprayed the top and they took about 20 minutes. Made it as an appetizer for mother's day and the mom's loved them!

Puh-leeze stop turning every Spanish "n" to "ñ"! Not only are we confronted with "habañero" chiles in the produce aisles (bathroom chiles?) but now instead of beef wrapped in bread (empanadas) we have to swallow beef wrapped in cloth (empañadas)! Misericordia!

Also, I added about 1.5 tsp chipotle sauce and maybe .5 tsp red chile peppers.

Heavenly! I doubled the raisins, olives, onion and garlic. I used rendered duck fat that I had on hand instead of the olive oil. I also added about 2 cups lentils that had been cooked with bay and cumin, then drained. I used the "Empanada Dough" recipe for the crust and then baked them following the cooking instructions with the dough's associated recipe. They were delicious. The crust was perfect baked. Did not miss out on them being fried. Even my boyfriend who does not like beef loved them.

Not for a weeknight dinner as it is a bit more work than it seems but worth it - very tasty although I added a little extra cumin and oregano. Like other reviewers, I used the empanada dough recipe on this site (it is difficult finding empanada disks in Cork): http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/vi ews/Empanada-Dough-230786 I also baked them at 400F for 20 minutes after brushing with an egg wash and sprinking with some coarse salt. I made double the recipe and froze half for another dinner. My family is glad I did.

First time and a keeper. Found frozen discs at local Stop n Shop but I bet the homemade dough is way better. I also used about 3T of Sofrito and leftover rice. The beauty of a stuffed pocket is endless. Baked in oven, be sure to put plenty of olive oil on baking pan to crisp bottom. Did an egg wash and sprinkled large-grain salt on top.Family really liked them..great to go!

This recipe is almost like the one I grew up on. My mother didn't add the raisins and neither did I. Still delicious. I usually make a big batch and freeze them before baking them. Since they are good warm or at room temperature, I always have some in the freezer. When I'm short of "lunchbox" ideas, I pop them in the oven the night before and voila! Healthy lunch.

Made these last evening exactly as written, for a change from the same old burgers or chili. They were easy and delicious. We just wish that they had a little more of a kick. We served with habanero sauce and salsa. I baked them and used empanada pastry that I found at my local Kroger store in the frozen food section. I drizzled a bit of olive oil on the pan and over the empanadas. Baked them for about 20 minutes @ 400.

Holy Moly! This one was absolutely amazing! I used won-top wrappers that I had and needed to use, which I would not recommend. Next time, I will bake them instead of fry them and maybe try an easy pastry dough like crescent rolls or something.

I thoroughly enjoyed preparing, serving, and eating this recipe! My ruthless food critic at home loves these! These are time consuming but to me worth the work. A]I used the empanada dough recipe that can be found on this site. Excellent and very easy to prepare. B] I baked [did not fry] for 15 minutes at indicated temperature. C]I brushed them with olive oil and sprinkled them with fine sea salt just before baking. D] I definitely used the raisins! In fact, I put in two more tablespoons!The sweetness of the raisins combines well with the 1/2 tsp of salt, the salt from the olives, and the final sprinkle of sea salt just before baking. This recipe is definitely part of my permanent rotation especially during the colder months.

Delicious! I have made these several times, each time to rave reviews. I baked them instead of frying them to reduce the grease factor and they turned out great. And even though it may sound like a strange combo, don't leave out the raisins. They're definitely a nice touch.

I made this recipe last week to a 't' as a test..it was pretty good. The raisins were surprisingly tasty. However, it was still a little bland for my tastes. I used the empanada dough on this website which is outstanding, used an egg wash and baked them. I wanted to see how well they freeze and revive (very) to make them ahead of time for a big party. This time, I added some red chiles, omitted the raisins and olives, added carrots, potato, and thyme, and used fire-roasted tomato. Still not up to my preferred heat level but I look forward to further experimenting with this recipe in the future. By the way, I don't really see the point of the whole plastic wrap/ball roll-out technique in this recipe. Just roll it out as you would a pie crust and cut out circles of the size you're looking for. I'm making three-inch empanadas for this parties; a nice appetizer and not a huge commitment.

I made these for a Christmas party and my guests ate them all! I used the Empanada Dough recipe from this site and cut into 3 circles, added a spoonful of filling and folded over and crimped the edges. I brushed the tops with an egg and cream wash and baked about 10 minutes at 425. I made them the afternoon of the party and served at room temperature. They were a delicious, perfect bite-sized finger food for a party. I do agree with previous posters that some sort of dipping sauce or Chimichurri would make a nice addition.

Finally an empanada recipe that comes out tasting like the real thing, just like the ones I used to have in Argentina. Except for the raisins... But great recipe!

I made these in advance for my family to take for lunches, though we could not resist eating a few while they were still hot. We all loved them. I know people don't always like to hear about substitutions, but as my kids aren't wild for olives or for raisins in savoury items, I used finely chopped carrots, celery (approx. 3/4 cup each) and jalpeno peppers instead...yes, I know this made them far from authentic, but this really was a great recipe to use for a base. Also, using the extra veg and 1 lb of beef instead of 3/4 lb, the yield was bumped up to 20 instead of 10. I baked rather than deep-fried them. I am sure I compromised on taste and texture by baking, but they were still very good.

Definitely will make this again. I omitted the hard boiled eggs and raisins. I added one boiled potato diced up (cuban style)and baked according to the recipe. I used the empanada dough on this website- excellent

Delicious! A huge hit with my guests. The last reviewer suggested chimichurri sauce for dipping - great idea and will do it next time.

This was very good, though I made the following modifications. 1) I used ground lamb instead of beef. With the raisins and olives, I had always thought lamb would be a very nice substitute. 2) I substituted cinnamon for the cumin, using about 3/4 of the amount. 3) I used frozen pie crust, because I couldn't find the empanada pastry disks. Each pie crust made 5 empanadas, for a total of 33 for a single recipe. 4) I baked these rather than frying. I whisked up an egg, and basted on the egg wash which was beautiful. Baking took about 17 minutes at 425 degrees. The resulting crusts were beautiful and tasted flawless. 5) I also served these with a mint chutney type sauce (mint, cilantro, jalapeno, pepper, vinegar, ginger) which was FANTASTIC. As another reviewer recommended, no matter how odd the combination of eggs, olives and raisins sounds, definitely add them all. they are great, and they add a lot. We were in Argentina over Christmas, and while the modifications I suggest above definitely move this away from the authentic, when we were down there, after hearing what the traditional ingredients were, I couldn't help but think that these would be great with lamb, and they were. And then I love saucees, so I had to add the sauce. If I were to make these with beef, I would make a chimichurri and dip them in that. I think that would be very nice, too. These were a definite hit at the party where we served them. On, one final note. You can also make these ahead, and freeze them. Use that Glad wrap that adheres to itself, then you can effectively have them individually "shrink" wrapped. The put the group of "shrink-wrapped" empanadas into a plastic freezer bag. These are fairly time consuming because of assembly, so this is a nice option to ensure you don't get way behind on the day of a dinner when making these.

Very good recipe. I used frozen Goya empanada dough which was easy but I hope to have more time to try homemade in the future. I don't know why the tomatoes are specified as "whole" and then we are told to chop -- why not buy them diced? I also added some red pepper and some additional spices and chopped the eggs. Mine were baked (400 for 15 minutes - tops brushed with milk and a little sugar sprinkled on top) to avoid the extra fat. I will definitely make them again.

I love everything about this recipe! It was fun to make and so good to eat! I also used the empanada dough recipe from this site and I must say that the homemade dough was SO much better than the time that I tried to simplify by using Phyllo dough...that stuff is MESSY!! My friends said they liked the phyllo empanadas, but they might have been trying to make me feel better because I was almost in tears due to partially burning them! Do yourself a favor: make your own dough...it is worth it! I will be making these again - as often as possible!

Yup.It is ridiculously delicious! I made this for a dinner party first. I was supposed to bring the appetizers. Everyone had at least two and I was NOT allowed to take the leftovers. I made them smaller then reccomended becuase They were appetizers and it was great. Then I made them for dinner, in a larger size. My boyfriend and roommate LOVED them...well actually they said they Loved me for making them! I used the Dough recipe found on epicurious.com and it was great. I baked them at 350 for 15 min. Do not leave out the raisins....I don't really like raisins and though they would be gross, but wow they are so tasty in this! Also I used Buffalo meat, which was fantastic. A+ recipe!

Wonderful! I made this for New Year's Eve and it was an unbelievable hit. We made it with the Empanada dough that can be found on this website, which was tender and flaky and really added to the dish. My first impression was that this would be wanting a dipping sauce of sorts but don't fall to the temptation! The meat filling is complex with the perfect sweet (raisins) and savory (olives) combinations. My husband don't generally appreciate the sweet/savory combination and he loved this. Good luck!

These were super-easy and delicious. Instead of using store-bought dough, I just used a recipe for empanada dough also on epicurious. It was also easy. I made the whole recipe even though I'm the only one to feed and froze a bunch individually wrapped in tin foil. I just grab one when I'm hungry. Next time, I'll add cheese so each little pocket has all four food groups.

This is a fantastic recipe. I've made it several times - once with ground beef, once with mushrooms (just cook them until they've given off their juices and browned), and once with rotisserie-style chicken. Each time they were fantastic! Also - I chopped the eggs and sprinkled them over the filling before closing, just to distribute the flavor and texture a bit more. And we always bake ours after brushing them with an egg wash. They are truly great!

For a healthier version, bake the empanadas. Also, in Argentina, they are brushed with egg before going into the oven and the egg is added after the mix is cooked so that they don't become a "paste." The best brand of empanada dough is called "LA Salteña." They have the dough for baking and the one for deep frying.

Very close to the way my Cuban mother-in-law taught me. I make the "picadillo"(meat) with capers, but raisins and olives are good too. I also use bell pepper and garlic. We serve the picadillo over rice along with Cuban black beans, and fried plantains. I make empanadas the next night with the leftover meat, getting two meals out of one.

This was a good recipe. I skipped the hard-boiled eggs & raisins, and substituted paprika for the oregano as well as 2 Tbsp of tomato paste for the whole tomatoes. I also baked them rather than frying them and they held up well during my party. Serve them with Saffron Alioli - great combo.

This recipe is very similar to the one in the NY Times classic cookbook. To that end, here are my modifications... I chop the eggs and add them while the filling cools. I also add about 1 tsp of balsamic vinegar and 1 tb of tomato paste. A few red pepper flakes don't hurt either. I buy dough that is supposed to be baked. It still tastes great and is less messay and less fatty. We eat these all the time on picnics.
