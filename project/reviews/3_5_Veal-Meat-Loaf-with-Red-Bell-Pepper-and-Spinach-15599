All right, with the advices of a few cooks from the review section, this recipe turned out great. Used more breadcrumbs to absorb excess fat and didn't have any red bell pepper so I used sun dried tomatoes... yummy!!!!

This was a delicious meatloaf. Although, I did make some changes, ONLY because it is what I had on hand. I used meatloaf mix and did not have a red pepper. So I wilted the spinach, rough chopped it and mixed it in with the meat. Also for any meatloaf that I make for a quick weeknight meal, I cook it in a muffin tin at 450 for 20 minutes. Nothing fancy but quick and delicious.

Overall, I was a little disappointed at how greasy this was - which probably has more to do with the ground of the meat - but most of us are stuck with what the butcher pre- determines by the time we get to the grocery store at night. On a high note, I ended up mixing the wilted spinach throughout the meat, and I think it turned out better for consistency. The peppers are a snap to prepare, but they don't add much in the center of the loaf. I think they'll go on the side next time, with gridled onions, a simple toss of olive oil and salt and pepper. It has the mouthfeel of a richer-than- average cannelloni. I would NOT advise making this with anything other than super low-fat ground meat (and definitely not pork). Maybe more bread next time? Definitely has potential for a re-match.

I have made this numerous times and it's always enjoyed by everyone -- especially my husband. Las time I made it I used bottled red peppers and they worked just as well as when I roast them myself, and it saved some time. It makes a wonderful presentation, too.

While my boyfriend raved about this recipe, I didn't really care for it. I thought it lacked any flavor. He wants it again and again. I'll make it of course but I'll have to tweak it a bit to make it better. So I'm still in search for a meatloaf recipe that 'wows' me. Any suggestions?

I served this meat loaf to a small group of friends and we all loved it. The prep work was a little intensive but it came out very nice and held it's shape for easy slicing. None of us were big meatloaf fans but this recipe was unique and delicious with the ground veal.

After reading the reviews, I tried this recipe for tonight's supper but was missing a few ingredients, which I substituted with what's in my fridge. It worked exceptionally well. Instead of breadcrumbs I used plain mashed potatoes; I had no basil so I substituted homemade tomato sauce for both the basil & ketchup; and frozen spinach, squeezed dry & baby bok choy leaves replaced the fresh spinach. We are not meat loaf lovers but this veal loaf was so incredibly tender, moist, healthful & just plain delicious that it's made us bona fide converts. TRY IT -- bet you'll agree its well worth 4 forks!

This is a great meat loaf recipe - very flavorful. Ours fell apart too, which didn't bother me. I'll definitely be making this again.

This recipe is one of my husband's specialties. I'm so glad we're having it tonight to help ward off that last bit of winter chill. He uses ground veal and ground turkey and it's terrific. We also find it has to cook a little longer than 50 minutes - usually about 15 minutes more. Great for leftovers too!

I've made this veal loaf several times and it always gets raves. Moist and delicious. I also suggest using a meat thermometer as I have to cook mine longer than the time given.

this was a huge hit. my boyfriend loves meatloaf but i don't, it's usually dry and bland. i used half ground beef & half ground pork, substituted sun-dried tomatoes for the red peppers & omitted the ketchup- it was fabulous. very flavorful and juicy, and prented well with the lovely red and green.

It was a great, tasty and healthy meatloaf. My husband who is a real "meat and potato" kinda guy actually went back for seconds. On a pretty platter with garnish, this would make a lovely meal for an informal dinner.

What a disappointment! The entire family disliked this recipe. I think it is a classic case of gilding the lily: take a perfectly ordinary but classic dish like meat loaf and over"gourmet" it until it is unrecognizable, pseudo-sophisticated, and lousy. The dish was terribly overseasoned (ketchup AND mustard AND steak sauce---were we cleaning out the refrigerator?), obliterating the delicate flavor of the veal. The slices fell apart, spilling the spinach and pepper on the plate. Even the old Lipton's onion soup recipe has an edge over this mess!

Incredible! Although I was prepared to buy a small roast and grind it myself, I had trouble finding the veal so I substituted 1# of ground beef and 1# of ground pork. Also, I missed the fresh thyme on my grocery list so used flat-leaf parsley instead as I had some in the fridge. I will definitely make this again and I am NOT a meatloaf fan. I've always liked the idea of meatloaf but this is the first recipe I've tried that delivered. I'm pondering trying it without the peppers but with hard-boiled eggs in amongst the spinach.

This is the best meat loaf EVER. I had to use ground beef (veal just wasn't available) and it was fantastic. Can't wait to try it with veal. Throw away your other meat loaf recipes.

This recipe was excellent. I served it to 10 guests - all of whom said it was the best meatloaf they ever had. Very surprised at the way it carmelized beautifully, great texture and flavor. I had to triple the recipe for 6 lbs of veal. I made two small changes: added 8 oz dry white wine to total ingredients (never roast any meat without wine!!!); I substituted Worcestershire sauce for steak sauce. Great!

My husband, a meatloaf lover, rates this dish as "one of the top three best meatloaves I've eaten!" I make this dish frequently. Only changes I have made: I use ground beef (veal is hard to come by most of the time), I use a bit more of the spinach than called for, and I sautee the onion, garlic, and spinach in a bit of bacon fat. (Hey, I'm from the South...what can I say??)A frequently requested dish from the husband and the father-in-law. Both of my young children inhale it, too.

I thought this was pretty good. It was very moist and the fresh roasted peppers added quite a bit of flavor. I used ground sirloin instead of veal. Next time I'll try it with veal. Highly recommended.

A delightful new meat loaf recipe; beyond the ordinary. Will definitely make again. (I lined the baking pan with greased aluminum foil to ease removal from the pan. I cooked the meat loaf about 80 minutes.)

By popular request I often make meatloaf for my family, but I've never enjoyed eating it myself until now. This is a great recipe and worth the few extra steps. The only things I did differently was I used the whole bag of baby spinach and added some freshly grated parmesan cheese. Excellent.

I made this for dinner for my family and everyone gave it a rating of four folks. One thing, when I tried to take it out of the pan it broke apart. Not sure if this happened to anyone else. It was extremly moist and I also added beef. I doubled the receipe so there were plenty for leftovers.

The taste is wonderful and if you use ground veal the results are fluffy and moist. I found that I needed to cook the meatloaf 75 minutes so please be sure to use a meat thermoter to insure proper cooking.I also reccommend lightly greasing the pan so the meatloaf comes out in one piece when inverted. Otherwise, the recipe is a definite winner.

Most meatloaf recipies are dry and boring. Not this one! Using ground veal is a MUST. Ground beef and/or pork just won't work. This meatloaf is moist and loaded with wonderful flavors. It is my absolute favorite meatloaf recipe. OK, my only meatloaf recipe. The red peppers and spinach add a wonderful taste contrast to the perfectly seasoned meat mixture.

Love this meat loaf. I make it all the time, and now my mother makes it too. We live in a small town and I often can't get ground veal so I simply use ground beef. It's great, too.
