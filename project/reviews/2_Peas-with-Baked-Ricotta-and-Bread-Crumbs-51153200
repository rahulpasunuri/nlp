I wanted to love this recipe. Truth be told, it was very good, but not what I classify as exceptional. It was a bit bland in taste in taste and needs an extra 'something'. I was interested in the pea and sage combination and personally prefer mint or basil. Not a bad dish, but not something that I would go out of my way to make. I may try it again with a few variations.
