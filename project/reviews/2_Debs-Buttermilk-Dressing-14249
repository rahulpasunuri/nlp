Great when combined with raw broccoli, raw carrots, red onions, dried fruit such as dates or raisins, and other crunchies like sunflower seeds.

My rating and review is for "A Cook from Washington" honey mustard salad dressing NOT Deb's version. It is the best I ever had! I make it low fat by using nonfat sour cream and reduced fat Miracle Whip and serve it over grilled chicken and salad greens. The only problem I have encountered is since I am using low fat ingredients is that it must be used within a couple of days or it will turn very watery. I am sure the regular full fat version will keep longer. I just wanted to say "Thank You" to that wonderful "Cook from Washington, NC"

This recipe turned *four-star* when I used my own variations. It is very bland when made as is. This is a totally new recipe: 3 tbsp. Dijon mustard, 1/2 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup mayo, 2 tbsp. cider vinegar, 6 tbsp. honey, 1 tsp. fresh lemon juice. Mix very well. Yields restaurant quality results.
