Great recipe as written. I also added parsnips from my CSA box - wonderful spring meal!

bought some ramps at the union square greenmarket. This was a great use for them. I followed the recipe as directed, as except I added some organic carrots and parnsnips to the roasted veggies.

I started with bacon in the pan and rendered the fat, browned the chicken in some of it, stuck chicken and potatoes in the oven. I laid the bacon pieces on the potatoes during the last 10 minutes of cooking (with the ramps) to really crisp it up. Definitely not healthy, but the smokiness of the bacon was amazing with the ramps!

Wonderful, simple recipe. The wine is a great complement to the leeks. Instead of red potatoes, pick up some fingerlings at your local farmer's market when you get the ramps.

If you are lucky enough to acquire some ramps (wild leeks) by all means try this recipe. We got some ramps from our CSA farm and I was looking for a way to use them. I removed the skin from the chicken, but it still stayed tender and juicy. I also used more potatoes because we love potatoes. My husband thought it was fabulous!

I don't know where I heard about ramps this spring, but when I saw them at my local farmers' market, I decided to buy them and was so glad to find this basic recipe. The preparation of the chicken couldn't be simpler as the oven roasting requires little attention. The garlicky flavor of the ramps was absolutely delicious, and sauteing the ramp greens at the end added yet another delicious layer of flavor. I seasoned the chicken with a fennel rub rather than just salt and pepper and laid the chicken on top of the potatoes. Next time I will cover the dish after adding the ramp bulbs as some of the stems burned in the 500 degree oven. But the chicken skin was crisp, and the sauce and the potatoes were fantastic. Served along with a simple steamed broccoli, this dish really was exceptional!

A friend of mine sells ramps from her farm at our local farmers' market, so I am always looking for great recipes for them. This is tasty and easy. I cut the recipe in half for just 2 of us, and used bone-in chicken breasts. The ramp leaves get nice and sweet when cooked at the end. Crusty bread would have been good to go with.

Very good recipe.More on the gourmet/bon appetit argument though - they are two completely different magazines. Gourmet has more discussion and less ads - which is one of the reasons I stopped buying Bon Appetit. I "cook" every night and go back and forth between my old Bon Appetit and new Gourmet mags. Gourmet is definitely for people who cook regularly.

Four forks if you consider how easy this is to prepare. Found ramps at Whole Foods. Great! Hope I have time to make it again before they are gone. Leave Gourmet alone - I cook out of it all the time, and appreciate the more complex recipes - just because you don't use them doesn't mean nobody does!

Thank you Gourmet magazine for offering recipes with unusual ingredients! When shopping at the Green Market in Union Square I love trying new fruits and vegetables that I have never tried before. I love the challenge of cooking something for the first time. The past reviewers complaining that Gourmet is for people who don't cook are quite mistaken. I on the other hand would never subscribe to a magazine that needs to tell me how to cook fried chicken or blueberry pie. Nor would I feed such unhealthy food to my family.

I was introduced to ramps many years ago by friends from NW Pennsylvania. I then read about them in "Saveur" magazine. This recipe is great - if you can get past the smell of the ramps in the bowl while you're waiting to put them in to roast! My hubby and I loved this! My buddies brought me some ramps about a week ago and for fun I put that in the "key word" of the recipe file and got this recipe - it is definately worth trying - and eating!!!! We like food with flavor and this fits the bill! My friends have also introduced us to fiddle head ferns - but that is a whole other bandstand!

It's funny to hear you all fussing about ramps - where I hail from, the mountains on the Virginia and West Virginia border, ramps are really "regular people" food. In fact, the gourmets in "town" wouldn't touch them with a ten foot pole ... until of course Gourmet published an article. Now even the townies are heading to the annual ramp festival - so kudos to Gourmet and Ruth Reichl for showing how regional delicacies can be enjoyed by all kinds of folk. Lighten up, y'all!

I understand people read magazines for different reasons. The market is chockful of magazines. This is why I find the people complaining about Gourmet a little silly. I receive both Gourmet and Bon Appetit. They are different magazines and it would be stupid of me to think that they are here to accomplish the same things. I enjoy Gourmet's revamp. I love trying new things and to tell you the truth if there is something in my region that I can't find, improvise! That's half of the fun of cooking!!!! By the way, this is a delicious recipe that I will make with leeks, shallots and some garlic once ramp season is over!

I think all this complaining about Gourmet is silly. I tried ramps (available in Farmers Markets here in NYC) because I read Gourmet, Saveur, and other mags to find new and interesting recipes. If I want only to make the same old things and not explore the wonderful foods and techniques I don't even know about yet, I'll cook from the recipes on the box of tuna helper. Why not try to expand our horizons a little? 20 years ago you couldn't easily find basil anywhere. Largely because of the food editors and food magazines, you can now find it most stores, even outside major cities. I certainly appreciate the growth of available foods and I hope to hear about more.

AMEN to the Clayton reviewer! Well said! I too am tired of silly recipes for people who only like to read about cooking, and not actually cook. Things like spicy oven fried chicken, shortcakes, and yes, that nice looking blueberry pie will be the things I'll try. All of these can be found in Bon Appetit.

A TRUE delicacy! Ramps are one of the well kept "culinary secrets" of West Virginia. They are classified somewhere between a green onion and garlic. Grown wild, they are picked only in the early spring, while still young and tender, and in the mountainous regions of the state. They are very pungent in aroma and flavor and must be prepared and eaten WITH CARE in order to remain "sociably acceptable." The largest Ramp Feed in the nation, and quite possible the world, is in Richwood, W.V., in April of each year and attracts thousands of ramp eating fans. This recipe is so good because it uses them in a dish which is more of a meal than just as the usual side dish or adding them to fried potatoes and scrambled eggs. They are well worth the trouble to find, but green onions can be used, although a poor substitute. Like garlic, if you eat them raw, be sure your "loved one" does, too!

I'm not against introducing unfamiliar ingredients to readers. Over the years Gourmet has introduced me to numerous ingredients that I had to ask my butcher or grocer to special-order. Ultimately many of them have become mainstream (i.e. chipotles). However, with something like ramps that are seasonal and difficult to obtain there should be an alternative suggestion, or a note that one cannot substitute for the ingredient in question.

I agree with the cook from Camp Hill. Gourmet has declined since its re-launch. I hate all the celebrity food thoughts, go back to printing lots of recipies.

This is the reason that after 14 years of subscribing to Gourmet, I ended my subscription and started getting Bon Appetit again. The new editor, Ruth Reischl, is a nightmare. For some reason, she has changed the focus of the magazine to celebrity food thoughts and to people who dont like to or are too busy to cook.

I'm so tired of Gourmet giving us pages and pages of the magazine with no recipes-- and then printing ones that no one will likely try. Give me Bon Appetit with the lucious blueberry pie on the cover any day. Gourmet, give us something we can use!

Unfortunately most people, including myself, do not know what ramps are. Thank heavens for a good dictionary. It might be better to add a quick definition for unfamiliar terms like this. Maybe more people would be willing to try it then.

To quote Webster's: ramp2 (ramp), n. Usually, ramps. a wild onion, Allium tricoccum, of the amaryllis family, of eastern North America, having flat leaves and rounded clusters of whitish flowers; eaten raw or used as a flavoring in cooked foods. Also called wild leek. In season now!

What on earth is a "ramp"? Is it a leek, spring garlic, onion? I have been in the food industry forever - never heard of this in my life!!!
