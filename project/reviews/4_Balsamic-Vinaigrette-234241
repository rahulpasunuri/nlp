Delightful! I used a high quality pomegranate balsamic vinegar and good EVO. Served over spring greens with dried cranberry,toasted walnuts, and crumbled chevre. So good.

For the first time, my balsamic vinaigrette had the perfect consistency, did not separate and tasted great!

Bravo! Somehow, randomly throwing these same ingredients into a jar doesn't yield the same result. Proportions here are perfect. My search is over.

I'm never pleased with my vinaigrette when I just throw it together - following this recipes gets it right every time!

Perfection! So yummy and easy to make.

This is my all time favorite salad dressing. The mustard really cuts down on the tang of the vinegar, and makes the flavor very smooth, but it does not make the dressing taste like mustard. This is a very elegant dressing, which would be good for a party.

this is my staple salad dressing. Very tasty and everyone always comments on it. I throw all ingredients into a shaker and it is ready in 1 minute.

Great dressing. Only suggestion would be to use less oil.

I used my food processor...so thick and creamy. Could use it as a dip for crudites!

I've been using this recipe for a couple of years - not as a salad dressing but as the perfect marinade for steamed asparagus or green beans fresh from the Farmers' Market. The asparagus or green beans vinaigrette is the perfect side dish for a summer meal and keeps well in the fridge. Great recipe.

Quick, simple and delish! I do however use less olive oil.

This is a great dressing. My husband and I like creamy salad dressings, but since I had field greens on-hand, I didn't think that bleu cheese dressing would be appropriate. This dressing is a keeper. My husband could not stop raving about it! And it was so easy to make.

Excellent! Delish! Made a few days in advance and it stayed emulsified.

This is by far the best dressing I've ever had: in a house or with a mouse. I make it every chance I get. Highly recommended!

This is an *insanely* delicious dressing!!! I add about 6 more cloves of garlic, along with a shallot or two and pulse everything together with an immersion blender. The bf hates veggies, but if there's any of this dressing in the fridge, leafy greens don't stand a chance...

This is an excellent vinaigrette. I add a small drop of honey.

Excellent. Best made with an aged, sweeter balsamic vinegar. This tastes just like the vinaigrette that my favorite restaurant uses on its spinach, strawberry and pecan salad.

Fantastic. Couldn't be easier either! I added a pinch of sugar, and will use this one weekly.

Wonderful balance as is but also works with a slight reduction in oil (1/3 cup).

Rating: 4
Very yummy. However, I only used 1/2 of the olive oil indicated in the recipe and it was a tad thicker and tasted nice and garlicky.

Absolutely fabulous and very easy. The first time I made this I only had "Spicy Brown Mustard" in the fridge, and it was very good, but not as good as the dijon is.

Very easy and delicious. . . I no longer purchase salad dressing in the store since making this.

Have made this a zillion times now for every salad imaginable and have the recipe memorized. I also just use a small jar to shake it up. Super easy, my favorite balance of all the balsamic vinaigrette recipes I've tried. A staple around my house.
