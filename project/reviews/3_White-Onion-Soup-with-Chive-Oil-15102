This soup is bland and uninteresting. I used good wine in it, as well as homemade chicken stock, and all the chives were homegrown. It still needed something to perk it up--perhaps good beef stock instead of chicken stock. Or perhaps vidalia onions instead of white onions. There are better onion soups out there.

I was really disappointed with the lack of flavor in this soup, particularly since I've had such good luck with so many other recipes on epicurious. The best thing I can say is that it is low-cal; but there are better low-cal onion soup recipes out there.

This soup tastes superb!! The presentation is impressive and different.

A delicious, light, fresh tasting alternative to French Onion Soup. The chive oil is a subtle touch. Needs a bit of salt. A good Parmigiano - Reggiano makes the dish. Definitely a keeper.

This soup is so easy to make and so delicious. I make it at least once a week. For less fat, delete the butter, it's still very tasty.
