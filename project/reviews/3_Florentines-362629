This recipe was a waste of my time and homemade orange peel. I followed the recipe exactly. Maybe following the suggestion of one of the other reviewers to cook the mixture till caramelized would have helped. They were nothing like florentines. I didn't even finish the batter. Yuck.

This recipe works well so long as you live in an area without a lot of humidity. Down South, they become soft stick together.

Really delicious! Making them for dessert this Saturday along with these fudge cupcakes (you can't go wrong, it's cream cheese icing!) http://www.fourgreensteps.com/community/recipes/desserts-a-goodies-/espresso-fudge-cupcakes-with-chocolate-cream-cheese-icing

SUPER! I followed the recipe exactly. I used chopped whole almonds and it turned out great. I made the candied orange peel a day before (can't wait to think of other ideas for that, YUM!). I doubled the recipe, but did not double the orange peel and the orange flavor is wonderful through the cookie. The only problem I had was I tried to go thinner with the cookie and they were all in pieces coming off the pan. Don't go too thin! For the choc. glaze I used Ghirardelli bittersweet choc. and spread it on with my silicone pastery brush. I will make again!

QUESTION: are they blanced almonds? I would think of chopping almond slivers, but have others tried whole almonds?

These are amazing. Note that you need to boil the cream-butter-sugar mix until it gets thick and turns caramel brown (stir the caramel mix the whole time or it'll burn or boil over) or your Florentines will be very pale. Still yummy, just not quite the same look as at the French bakery.

I've been making these since they first came out in Gourmet (RIP!) They are terrific! The only change I make is to drizzle them with the chocolate, rather than coating them. Prettier, I think, and much less fiddling.
