My husband and I made a few changes are were very happy. We used whole wheat flour, 1/8 cup brown sugar and 1/8 cup white sugar, added about a tablespoon of honey, a tablespoon of vanilla extract, a tablespoon of allspice and chocolate chips.. Great waffles!

This waffle batter makes great glue. When cooked...well, read the other reviews. This batter takes some serious tweaking to get it to the right consistency to cook.

Excellent recipe. Forgot to save the egg whites and fold them in later, but recipe still came out great.

I was a bit hesitant about trying this recipe, but it was fine. I added a bit of cinnamon and vanilla, and followed all of the other instructions (I did add the sugar, and I think that helped). The recipe produced a tasty belgian waffle, though a bit thick and heavy.

i love this recipe and have already used it many times. the only caveat is that I would change the following:it needs the recommended sugar and i used 6 eggs the same way as the 5, i also use liquid buttermilk instead of milk and beat the egg whites until stiff peaks. no need for batter to settle.. these are great!

I agree with the first review. yikes. i should have read these first before i made the batter. they tasted good, but really hard to chew through and everyone could only eat one because they were so tough and thick and filling. bleh. not making these again.

It was easy to do and good to eat! I hesitate to choose this recipe because it had bad reviews... but for me it worked very well.

This is a prime example of the problems I keep having with Susan Loomis' recipes. The proportions, even when adjusted, are out of whack somewhere. Waffle batter should be an easy, no worries affair-- you shouldn't have to mess about quite so much, and treat it so gently just to get results that aren't as good as bisquick.

My family and I enjoyed these waffles. I treated them gently. I whisked everything by hand and whisked egg whites to a soft foam, rather than peaks. I let them rest 20 minutes and cooked them in the waffle iron for only four minutes after the iron reheated. I also added vanilla.

This would not be my favorite waffle recipe to use unless one needed a combination waffle/gorilla teething bicuit or waffle/trivet.You could also keep a few around to hunt small game with though they will not return to you like there Austrailian counterparts.

I have used a lot of the recipes from Epicurious. This one was so bad that I felt compelled to enter a review just to warn others. There is something seriously wrong with this recipe, even after the ingredients quantities were adjusted.

Great recipe for my first batch of waffles. Easy to cook. I added a banana puree (1 banana, Tbs of hot water, Tbs maple syrup, dash of vanilla) to the batter to enhance. My wife was very pleased.

I've made this recipe twice already. My kids really love it.

The adjustment was super! After reading the previous reviews I was a little hesitant to try this batter, but I'm so glad I did. Just got a new Belgian waffle maker and needed a recipe. Wow! These were as good as what you would buy at a restaurant. We cut up fresh fruit and heaped it on along with berries, plain yogurt, pecans and walnuts for a wonderful taste treat!

A made this recipe for a large gathering and several people in my village died as a result. I think there is a problem with the ingredient amounts.

This recipe should be removed from your site. We tried it twice and ended up tossing the batter. Cook's magazine would have a field day with this recipe. It doesn't reflect well on your website to have recipes that don't work. Just look at the other comments. I suggest you pull it.

I don't know much, but I think that there is a typo in this recipe. There should only be 3/4 cup of flour, not 3 OR 4 CUPS. I tried this and the waffles turned out alright. I would also reduce the # of eggs next time. In the end, I didn't feel I had wasted my time or my ingredients. My live-in girlfriend got her waffles.

I wish that I had read the reviews before I made the waffles. The batter was incredibly thick and I had to add a lot of extra milk to it. The waffles ended up being really dense and didn't have a lot of flavor.

There is definately a conversion problem. When I made this recipe I halfed all the ingredients except the milk and when I saw the batter would be too thick I added the flour a little at a time until I got the consistancy I wanted. The waffles were actually very good. And they freeze well too.

Maybe you have a conversion problem with the ingredients but the batter is much too thick. Please review this with the chef before the recipe is printed again. I wasted all of the ingredients as well as my time. Also, my husband was very disappointed not to have his waffles.

something must be wrong with the proportions because I ended up with a stiff ball of batter before incorporating the egg whites....i had to throw everything away!!!!I would love to hear from you .
