Had some sugar-snap peas and snow peas in our garden - not many because the backyard critters upset the plants. This was super easy and very good.

I really enjoyed this recipe.. the peas all have a slightly different sweetness and this is well complemented by the sesame seeds. To make this into a full meal, rather than just a side-dish, I threw in shrimp, red pepper and served it over rice.

Pea lover that I am, this is one of my favourite side dishes. The only changes I make are a squeeze of lime juice and a bit of brown sugar when cooking, then a sprinkling of lime zest for garnish. Quick/easy with clean, fresh, bright flavours. Please do give it a try.

I've been making this for the past year or so. My family loves it. There is nothing 'boring' about it unless one finds the absence of chili bean paste, curry powder or Scotch Bonnet peppers boring!

This dish is delicious and healthy. I add stir-fry chicken to it and serve over jasmine or basmati rice for a delicious entree.

I made this easy dish as soon as I saw it, and am making it tonight for a dinner party. It is simple, fresh and light. Great all year around

This was so simple and so delicious! A great combination of flavors, and it looks so pretty too. I made it just as the recipe called for and even tho I'm not a big soy sauce fan, the amount called for was not overpowering in the least. Makes you feel sort of healthy too!

A very boring dish. If you are a REALLY big fan of peas then maybe you might like this one. This recipe is not worth it!
