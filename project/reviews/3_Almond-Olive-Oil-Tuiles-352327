Easy to do and perfect when the dessert needs something light and crispy for texture, like Pears Poached in Red Wine, Cardamom and Orange. If batter is too thick, more egg white will do the trick.

This are fairly easy to make. The ingredients come together quickly. The batter is liquidy so I used the back of a spoon to spread them out and baked them on my Silpat. Eight minutes seemed just right and curling them over the rolling pin made them more visually appealing.

These are a very nice change to most of the Passover cookie recipes out there! They were good even without the almond slices (I forgot to sprinkle on the almonds on one of the batches). My batches of tuiles baked up in 6 1/2 minutes, so I recommend keeping a watchful eye on them.

the hard copy says "7 to 9 minutes" - the recipe post here is correct

These came out great, but not as predicted. The dough was too sticky for me to flatten them, so I left them as is and decorated with as many almond slices as would fit. Since they were thicker than expected, they cooked a bit longer. They were a very nice dessert option in addition to flourless chocolate cake. I would make these even not on Passover.

In the hardcopy of the magazine, the recipe says bake it for 7 to 8 minutes. I would suggest watching it around 6 or 7 minutes since the cookie browns really quickly near the end. The cookies are really good with the almond milk flan from the same recipe collection

Question: this doesn't say how long to bake the cookies, does it?

I think there are a few steps missing at the end. Baking time?
