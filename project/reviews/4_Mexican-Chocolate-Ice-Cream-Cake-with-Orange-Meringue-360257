Very delicious. Used 2 pints of Haagen Dazs Mayan Chocolate Ice cream to save time. Not sure about how safe it is to eat frozen raw meringue (don't think it is fully cooked through using kitchen torch only and didn't want to risk melting the ice cream by putting it under the broiler). Don't line springform pan with foil, ripped into a million little pieces when I was trying to take it off, very frustrating and stressful as I didn't want to serve slices with pieces of aluminum foil baked into the brownie, should have gone with my instinct to use parchment paper instead.

a friend served this at a dinner party, and it was amazing! Her only mistake was making everyone only one serving. I just got the recipe from her, and am making it Friday for friends.

Great dessert. Flavors worked so well together. I underbaked the brownie a little, so it was not hard to cut. A winner at my book club

Flavor was great, but for me the brownie was as hard as a rock when frozen. I don't know if I was supposed to set the cake plate on something warm-ish for 10 minutes before cutting it, and wind up with my ice cream and meringue getting all melty, or just do my best to fight through the cutting. So good though. I might try cutting the brownie up and throwing chunks into the ice cream next time, just so it's not impossible to cut.
