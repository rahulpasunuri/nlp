One more thing, I personally used the pork fat, but you can also use tofu to make them, which is of course much more healthy.

I made these for chinese hot pot. I put everything in the food processor, and rolled into small balls. I did not coat them in the panko crumbs. They were very tasty, however we all agreed a bit too salty. But really not sure if it was the recipe, or the spicy stock broth that made them that way. Next time I will cut down on the salt.

I made these for dinner with the in-laws and they were a huge hit!! My chinese father in law even said they were restaurant quality - a very good sign! I thought the water chestnuts were a pain to chop, next time i will use the food processor. Will definitely make again though!

These are great. I made quite a few things from this site for a party and these went first. They are really good and the sauce is great. They were a bit too salty the first time I made them(and I love salt) so I reduced it and they were perfect.

Also left out the lard. Took them to a party and everyone wanted the recipe- they were a hit. Thanks.

I'm in the minority, but I just didn't love these. They were o.k., but not something I'd serve to guests. I didn't find the shrimp flavor I was hoping for, which is a surprise since there is so much shrimp in these.

Wow... I made these for our New Years Eve party, about 6 hours ahead of time. I froze them, then reheated at 425 for about 12 minutes - they were EXCELLENT! Crispy, moist, full of flavor. Really, really good! We're making more for today, as these disappeared way too fast from our buffet. I only got two! I wish I had discovered this recipe years ago...

Quick follow-up to my previous review on reheating. I tried both versions: refrigerated/frozen and reheated both at 425 - refrig for 5 minutes; frozen for 15. I thought frozen came out better. If you plan to reheat, you might want to reduce the salt - I thought it was more pronounced when reheated as opposed to just coming out of the fryer. BTW - skip the thermometer - get a deep fryer.

Outstanding appetizer - absolutely delicious! Like others, I did not add the fat. The oil takes considerable time to heat so start that process early on (on medium heat, not high) - also, if you don't have a deep-fat thermometer, get one and make sure the oil returns to 375 for each consecutive batch. I made these the day before last night's party and reheated - they just weren't as good. Because they cook up so quickly, you can prepare them up to the point of cooking and fry them up just before needed. Also, I used a smaller pan and needed much less oil. I'm making them again over this Thanksgiving weekend - but first, I'm going to buy that thermometer! YUMMY!!!

Amazing! Took a while to prepare, but worth the effort. I did not add the lard - not needed. Tastes great without. To coat I grabbed a small amount of the mixture and placed in panko flakes. Balls automatically started to form. No need for wax paper, per se. Just place on clean flat surface until ready to fry. I also went out and bought a compact deep fryer, which worked fabulously. Cooked in seconds. This is another recipe I will definitely hold on to! Try it. You will be a hit especially if you are hosting a party. Creates a large number.

This recipe was fabulous. I was a little skeptical about the apricot dipping sauce, but it really was the key. They were devoured in seconds. Definitely a keeper!

This recipe only served 6 as an appetizer - but that's because they were so yummy, my guests wolfed them down! I used shortening instead of fat, and I used a combination of thawed frozen shrimp and scallops. You do not need 3 cups of panko (1.5 cups should be enough).

What a delicious appetizer. Absolutely must serve with the apricot dipping sauce. I used bacon. Don't be alarmed if the mixture looks like mush. Drop by teaspoon fulls into the panko and then form the ball. The balls fry quickly and hold up beautifully. A real keeper.

A great hors d'oeuvres!

An oldie, but a goodie--though getting 80 balls would mean making them really tiny. Suggestion: if you fry these in a wok, 8-10 at a time, you'll need half the oil or less.

Rating: 4
The first appetizer to go! This recipe is a bit tedious to make due to the consistency of the shrimp mixture. Using a teaspoon scooper helped the process of forming the balls. These appetizers can stand alone - they're flavorful enough that you don't need the dipping sauce.

TOO SALTY!! I took the advice from Saratoga and Philly and used bacon instead of pork fat and baked them. The consistency was great. I reduced the salt to 1 tsp and it was TOO SALTY. Apricot sauce excellent.

I made these and froze them without trying them. Heating and serving after freezing they were not crunchy. The flavor was great. Next time I will serve them out of the oven. I got lazy and didn't make the sauce because I had a Harry & Davids specialty in the frig. Next time i will also try the sauce. Reviews rave and it sounds great.

These are a true hit at any function. The lard is not required. Refrigerate the mix doe 1 hour before assembly - helps hold them together. Enjoy!

This dish was really delish but I wouldn't make it again because it is just too much work. Too much time and too many dirty dishes required. If you're up for that, I would recommend, but otherwise don'tgo there.

Easy and tasty. I used a small cookie scoop and didn't make them very large. I rolled them around gently so that I didn't get much stuck to my hand. I made them one day and warmed them up the next. I didn't have rice wine, so used white wine and they were fine. I served them with the spicy/sweet bottled Asian chili sauce.

This adaptation is definitely good, but the original is far, far better and more attractive: Dice thin white bread (Pepperidge Farm Very Thin White is ideal) into 1/4" cubes and use instead of the panko. With the cubes, it's the best appetizer I've ever made. The filling is very much like the traditional shrimp sausages wrapped around sugar cane in Vietnamese cooking. They do fry wonderfully, but baking is good too. Fry them for special occasions, and bake for every day. When you chop raw shrimp, make sure to wash up your food processor ASAP. If you let it dry out, it's an unbelievable mess to clean.

delicious! easy to make--even w/a 4-year-old nearby! used a tablespoon scoop w/release mechanism-didn't fill all the way, but made 65. worked fine. followed suggestions & pulsed large shrimp in short bursts. changes i made: used powdered ginger because family doesnt like strong flavor of the spice, used chives instead of scallions, & used uncured smoked bacon instead of lard. baked some & fried the rest--aesthetically, i would fry instead. used 2 1/2 saucepot & 3 cups oil & fried 12 at a time--worked great!

We make these every year at Christmastime and they are fabulous! For those of you who think they are "way too salty," most likely it is because you used table salt instead of course salt like the recipe calls for. I made that mistake the second time I made them - and it's a mistake you only make once!

Rating: 1
Sorry everyone. I know that most of you really liked this dish. I found it to be way too salty and just so-so. I made half the recipe and chose to bake, rather than fry the shrimp balls, otherwise I did follow the directions. I think that the Shrimp Cakes with Chili Lime sauce is much better (also from this site)

I tried this recipe for a cocktail party and decided to do half a batch fried and half a batch baked in the oven. They were both great but most guests preferred the baked version. The fried balls had a tendency to fall apart. A bit messy but worthwhile. I'll definitely make again.

Rating: 4
I made these for a Christmas eve party & they were a huge hit. I used the suggestion of reheating them from frozen with no problems. The only snag was that they often fell apart when they were dipped in the sauce. Perhaps I made them too big? The recipe will definitely be a keeper. Delicious!

No need to waste so much oil for the deep frying. I used a 2 qt saucepan with about 2 cups of canola oil and fried 10 at a time. They went quickly and came out great. I, too, eliminated the lard - not necessary.

Rating: 3
Absolutely agree with the low-fat version of baking vs. frying. Suggest using short pulses for processing shrimp. And to make more uniform shrimp balls with less mess use a tsp. scoop w/release, then use forks to roll in panko. makes the process cleaner and faster. excellent recipe.

Rating: 4
I have a question and have not made this yet. I gave the four forks so the rating wouldn't be lowered. Don't raw shrimp mush if you process them in a chopper?

Rating: 4
Fabulous! NOTE: I BAKED INSTEAD OF DEEP FRYING! ...and they were great! I lightly oiled the pan and cooked at 475 for 18 minutes: they were perfect, and a lot healthier. My processor turned the shrimp into mush, and it was easier to glob it than make balls, but they came out perfect!

exquisite!! I mixed in 1/2 c panko then shaped--mine were 1" so I only got 64.that includes the 8 I "tasted". I added sweet chili sauce to the dip--ooh, yummy!! I am serving them at my wedding reception for 50, by frying, freezing, reheating un-defrosted. Totally worth the effort!

Excellent. I, too, omitted the lard ... otherwise made the recipe exactly as written. I only made half, and it didn't look like I would be able to get 40 balls out of the shrimp mixture, but I did ... the trick is to keep them small. I clumped them rather than trying to form balls (be sure to whip the egg whites a little to keep the mixture from being to liquidy as others have reported). Then gently dipped the clumps into the crumbs. The crumbs helped to keep shape. Fried in a deep-fat fryer for exactly 1-1/2 minutes ... perfect. Also found that you can FREEZE them! After frying and cooling, I froze a few (individually on cookie sheets. Then reheated WITHOUT THAWING at 425 degrees for 15 minutes. Perfect.

Rating: 4
A little different and very good. Mixture is sticky and difficult to handle. Suggest dropping small teaspoonfuls directly into the panko and then rolling into balls. The panko makes the mixture much easier to handle.

I did not roll the shrimp balls in the panko and they turned out fine -- everyone loved them. I reduced the amount of salt and substituted ground white pepper for the ginger because my boyfriend dislikes ginger & he loves this dish.

Made these for a cocktail party for 50 people and they were divine. Everyone wanted the recipe. I also left out the pork fat/lard - you don't need it. Best of all, they really do reheat brilliantly so you can make them the day before. My son requested these for his party also and they were a hit again.

This is WAY too salty - a scant 1 tsp. is just about right. Dried shiitake mushrooms (much more potent than fresh) soaked in warm water for 30 min., then chopped fine is a great addition. As with other cooks - the lard is not needed.

These balls did taste like something you would get in a chinese restaurant. However, I guess I am not a big fan of fried food. The sauce went well with it.

We had our doubts when we were rolling the sticky little mush balls, but once we applied the panko they looked much better. These were easy to cook and guests ate them immediately (no time to re-warm in the oven). A great dish for big parties or smaller gatherings. Very light tasting, but full-flavored!

I made this recipe for my Bunko group and it was a hit! Everyone loved them and asked for the recipe. I too omitted the fat and used chopped mushrooms in its place. Once I formed the shrimp balls, I refrigerated them for about 30 minutes. They were much easier to handle when putting them in the Panko. Wonderful snack! It is a little time consuming, but the results are well worth it

Definately a keeper! Made these for Christmas Eve and they blew my guests away! They are so light for a fried dish but so flavorful. Will admit they were a bit of work to pull off, but making them in advance worked out well, reheating them in the oven. I skipped the lard too and didn't miss a thing.

Great dish! Perfect for Superbowl Sunday - lots of texture but full of flavor too. The dipping sauce is a must. Good for big groups. You need to serve them right away, reheating them reduced the crunch of the exterior. The water chestnuts make up for it if you have no options.

These shrimp balls were delicious. I didn't like the idea of pork fat or lard so I omitted it and added a little more cornstarch to the recipe. Tasted great! The apricot sauce was the biggest surprise. Think it would also be great with spring rolls and wontons.
