This was not our combo of flavors. my husband really disliked the tomatoes. Arugula did nothing special for this dish. I threw some garlic cloves with the shallots, and they were the best part of the meal.

Outstanding and relatively easy to make for a dinner party. I omitted the capers from the shallots & tomatoes and served spinach with pine nuts and currants and sauteed mushrooms on the side. Everyone raved!

This has become my staple recipe for entertaining. Easy for a good weeknight meal and even a dinner party. I've done it with veal, pork, and chicken, all with rave reviews. Probably my most requested meal.

Yes, the shallots are peeled.

This is an awesome, wonderful veal dish! I make this regularly - I do use radicchio instead of the arugual sometimes. My guests find this a wonderful treat. The soft polents sets off the sauce wonderfully.

Question: These shallots don't LOOK peeled. Are they? I don't want to peel mine because I think they look better unpeeled!

Somehow this fell short for me. For all of the "big" ingredients (tomatoes and arugula fresh from the garden, balsamic and capers), there was a lack of complexity. I found it rather one dimensional. This likely won't see the table at our house again, which is too bad because I had high hopes.

The cooking techinque for the veal is flawless - I have regular grocery store (read:smaller and not frenched) veal chops and the meat came out great! (cooked in oven for only 8 minutes.) I would, however, make a few adjustments next time: 1 tablespoon of both salt and pepper was WAY TOO MUCH for my family. Spread out over 5 chops, rather than the 4 stated in the recipe, still resulted in salty and too-peppery chops. I would cut the pepper to one TEASPOON, and just tone down the salt slightly. The 1/4 cup balsamic was a bit strong - which is surprising to me as my family usually loves balsamic dressings, onions, etc. Again: next time I would cut back a little bit. I would also omit the brine from the capers - as that was borderling 'too salty' as well. The arugula is such a minor part to this recipe its misleading to have it in the title, but that is just a picky thing. All in all the recipe was good. Cooking was worthy of 4 forks. I reviewed the soft polenta on that recipe and is not included in this evaluation.

This is a wonderful recipe. I changed a couple of things: After searing the chops, instead of putting the pan with the chops in the oven, I transferred the chops to a pie plate to put in the oven, and deglazed the sauté pan with the marinade. I then transferred the reduced marinade to a bowl in the warming drawer and re-used the sauté pan to sauté the polenta. After the shallot/tomato mixture was done, I transferred it to a bowl in the warming drawer and wilted the arugula in the shallot pan with some salt & pepper. I placed the chops on top of the wilted arugula, put some of the shallot/tom mixture on top of each chop and some next to the chop, arranged the polenta slices and drizzled the whole thing with the marinade. AWESOME!

This was spectacular and quite easy to make. The arugala adds a nice bit of freshness and goes great with a drizzle of the sauce. My only lesson with veal shanks is to reuest that the fat be removed, otherwise it's hard to tell how much meat you're getting.

This recipe was terrific. After reading other reviews, I did not add the salt and it was not needed. I prepared fried polenta cakes instead of soft. Easy to make, but definitely great flavors. I made it for a dinner party and it received raves.

My husband and I added this to our list of regular "gourmet" meals some time ago. We always exclude the salt. We also typically replace the veal with pork as it is far less expensive and just as tasty. The meat, after all, is not the star of this dish. It is the balsamic vinegar, shallot and grape tomato combination that gives this meal its intense flavor. In fact, we often eat the leftover sauce on anything we have around the house for the next couple of days. Another tip: If you have leftover polenta, fry it up the next morning and top it with the sauce for a breakfast FEAST! Even better accompanied by a poached egg!

Made this for Valentine's Day. I cut the recipe in half and used the bake the polenta recipe provided by another reviewer. Even though I thought I went light on the salt everything was too salty for my taste. If I make it again I would reduce salt to a minimum.

Absolutely delicious and easy to make. After browning the chops, I nestled them in the shallot mixture and returned the whole dish to the oven to finish the cooking.

I felt like the meat lacked flavor! My family was disappointed.

Outstanding! I replaced the veal chops with the same sized pork chops and it was excellent. My husband said they were the best pork chops he ever had. The polenta and roasted veggies were a great combination. We have actually had just the polenta and roasted veggies for a lighter meal.

QUESTION: no one has mentioned the polenta part of this. Has anyone done that? did you like it? do you have a better choice to accompany? I am using this soon for a dinner party and wanted feedback on the polenta part of this recipe. thanks

this recipe is amazing!! it is a wonderful meal and i can't wait to make it for a dinner party. the balsamic vinegar makes the roasted tomatoes and shallots have such a great flavor. this is my favorite recipe i have made in a long time!

Easy and delicious. Made only veal chops for 2, but a full portion of the vegetables, which were very good spooned on baguette. I'd like to try this recipe with lamb chops, as well, as it seems the flavors would pair as nicely with lamb, as they did with the veal.

Divine!

The roasted shallots and tomatoes were fantastic. We mixed a large amount of arugula (as opposed to just garnishing with arugula) into the hot pan with the shallots so it wilted a bit...excellent!

This is fabulous! A great menu for impressing company. We fixed it with fried polenta as an adaptation. The sauce on this dish is so tangy you will want to sop it up with bread! However, I might cut back on the salt a bit.

Second review. First time I used veal chops. This time I pulled some boneless pork loin chops out of the freezer. Marinated them for an extra 15 minutes. Results were good; veal was better but pork is much cheaper. Take your choice.

I made this for my husband and i tonite and he LOVED it. He can't wait till i make it again. Took one reviewers suggestion and added some white wine with the tomatoes. We're not fond of polenta so i served it with rice pilaf. otherwise i followed the recipe exactly. DELICIOUS!!!!

Great recipe and bravo to AlmostEscoffier in Atlanta! Practially fell out of my chair laughing at some of these comments!

My 10 year old son and I made this recipe together. It was delicious. We saw the recipe being prepared on a television cooking show. The chef added butter and white wine to the shallot/tomato mixture. We did not do this, but I think it would have helped to calm down the saltiness. Otherwise, this dish was fabulous!

I made this the other night. Excellent. I used baby spinach because my local grocer failed me yet again by not having fresh arugula. And there are people here who think Publix is the better market! Oh well. And to add my $.02 to the "controversy," I say don't feed the trolls. We all have things that we are passionate about. What's important to one person may mean nothing to another. But posting anti-veal comments on a food-related website in general, and a veal-based recipe specifically, is a bit like trying to find an intelligent, broad-minded, progessive-thinking, responsible citizen at a Republican fund raiser: impossible and a complete waste of time!

To AlmostEscoffier from Atlanta: Bravo on your very original dinner party theme. To MySonVaughn: I'll bet you wear leather shoes and eat meat in other forms, including chicken, which is one of the most tortured farm animals out there. Get over yourself. This was delicious, and if I make it with pork, I guess I'm torturing that animal too by making this dish.

We had a great "torture" dinner party the other night where we made this dish. Which, by the way, was great. The torture was that we made our guests read the inane comments from "mysonvaughn." The hypocrisy of the animal rights people is legendary. They will scream and yell about the rights of a cow or a pig, but seem to have no regard for human life and rights. There happens to be a food chain on our planet. Humans are at the top of the food chain which means that we can pretty much eat whatever we want lower on the food chain. And the animals lower on the food chain can eat other animals lower on the food chain. Maybe "mysonvaugh" needs to pick an easier battle. You should defend the rights of mice to not be eaten by cats. BEEF. IT'S WHAT'S FOR DINNER!

What a great recipe. It has such a nice presentation - looks like you spent a lot of time preparing it, but it was very fast and easy. We loved the marinade. This will certainly go into our rotation of favorite meals.

This technique is a fabulous and easy way to prepare veal (for those who choose to). Shallots were tasty. I didn't really like the marinade sauce - thought it was too oily. But I will certainly make this again. I served with creamy mashed potatoes.

This dish was awsome! I followed the directions exactly and the veal was tender. The shallots and tomatoes added alot of flavor. A real winner.

Great recipe, and easy to follow. Veal is the best meat, followed by lamb because it is so tender. Never cared for polenta, so I sauted some spinach and had buttered corn. Great dish to impress others with.

I didn't have time to get veal chops so I used the extra thick cut T-bone pork chops I had in the freezer for this dish. I followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out perfect. It was so easy too! I will definitely make this dish again.

Great flavors . My chops were closer to 8 ounces so cut the roasting time by minute or two, probably should have cut the salt a bit too. Served with a mixture of brown rice, parsley and pine nuts. Look forward to having this again.

this was great- i didn't stray from the recipe and everything turned out perfectly. a veal chop really is enough for two meals, so there will be lots of left-overs...

Loved the recipe for the veal chops, the oil-lemon marinade was a bit much. Made mashed potatoes instead of polenta. The shallot and tomato side was OK, but won't make again. The veal chop recipe alone is a keeper...quick, easy and tasty.
