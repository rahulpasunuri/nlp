Wish I could give it 2.5 stars. It's not a knock out sause, but it is definitely in between good and delicious. I've made it a few different times, and have used canned whole peeled tomatoes when short on fresh tomatoes and time. Saves a lot of prep time that way. Overall, it's nice and simple to make for chilaquiles.

This is a fantastic recipe for chilaquiles rojos with the added flavor of the chipotle. It really came out well. To a cook from the Virgin Islands, roasting the tomatoes/onion/garlic in a skillet is very much the traditional way of making the 'caldillo' base for the sauce (also for other salsas and soups). Buying a can of tomatoes would certainly be easier, and ordering chilaquiles at a restaurant would be even easier than that.

Can be made much easier with a #10 can of tomatoes instead of fresh, and the quality would be much more consistant, batch to batch.
