I tried this recipe out of desperation. I was down to 4 eggs and needed to serve 4 for breakfast, and didn't have time to make a strata the night before. I figured it would be pretty mediocre. I subbed half & half for the milk, and used sharp cheddar, swiss, and parmesan for the cheese, added some baby spinach, and sprinkled a little more parm on top. Outstanding! Also beautiful. And so much easier than doing scrambled eggs.

This was very simple to make, I used a strong cheddar (as I have never seem monteray jack here) and a sprinkling of chilli flakes instead of fresh chilli, it made a lovely filling mid week supper dish, real comfort food on a cold day.

Just okay. The strata itself is lacking flavor and the addition of the salsa/cilantro makes it worth eating.

I'm giving this 2 forks based on the exact recipe. It is very easy to make & I think it has potential. Will try it again w/more vegetables.

Quick, easy and fancy enough for company. I added ~2 Tbsp. of chopped cilantro, substituted minced white onion for the green, Cheddar for the Jack, and added ~1/4 C. creme fraiche (in addition to the 1 C. milk - my bread was quite stale). Didn't have salsa, so finished by topping it with two small, chopped tomatoes (seeded, well drained) and yet more Cheddar, for about two minutes under the broiler. Light yet rich and tasty -- I'll definitely make this again.

My family and friends love this side dish. I use croissants instead of white bread. For people who don't like the chilis, i substitute dijon mustard, grated onion, and cheddar cheese instead. Great reheated the next day as a snack.

Not sure what 'strata' was, it looks, tastes, and has texture of Quiche. It was really good, different, and easy. I would put more cheese and ham in it next time though. And I didnt have Cilantro as Kroger sux.
