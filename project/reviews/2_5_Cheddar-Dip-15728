I made this dip this past weekend for a family party I was hosting. I had never tried it before. I didn't have the sesame seeds but had everything else and even added some cream cheese and warmed it up as the other reviewers suggested. I thought it was disgusting and so did all my guests. No one ate it at all. The beer gave it a very strong yeast flavor that overwhelmed the dip. It was awful. I'll never make it again.

I made this over the weekend, hoping to find a new easy appetizer, but I wasn't nearly as impressed as the other reviewers. It was rather bland and uninspiring as directed, so I added a little cream cheese, some more mayo, and some diced green chilies. I ended up heating the dip (350 for about 20 min) and served it with wheat crackers. It was much better warm than it was cold - maybe two and a half to three forks - but as directed at room temp, I'd only give it one or two forks. The dip was extremely filling so we had a lot of leftovers, and I was pleasantly surprised that the flavors had melded a little better overnight such that the next day, it was quite a bit better - even though it was cold. Unfortunately, we still just weren't all that interested in it, and most of it got thrown out. If I were to ever make it again - and I'm not sure I would - I'd probably make it a day ahead, then heat it and serve it in a bread bowl as someone else suggested. When warm, it's almost a fondue consistency and might be good with rye or pumpernickel break chunks.

This was easy to prepare--actually, I made it the night before a party and it was still tasty. I did add some cream cheese for creaminess, and I also served the dip hot in a breadbowl. Watch out, though. It is for salt-lovers only!

This was a great recipe for a party. It was missing something though, so I heated it for 30 min on 325. Came out great.
