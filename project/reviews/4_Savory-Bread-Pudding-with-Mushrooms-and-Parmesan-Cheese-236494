I was so disappointed with this recipe. Followed to a Tee. Very flat in flavor. After a very short time, the pudding was weepy and soggy. I will go back to my oldfashioned dressing next time.

this is delicious. Made to specs exept for using a cup of chicken broth for a cup of cream. I will add sausage next time for a heartier entree.

Great for brunch. Like so many of you, I eliminated the celery, subbed leeks for onions and added gruyere to the custard. Sitting overnight, the bread really absorbed the custard. I would use all the custard if serving this for brunch and perhaps a bit lighter on it if serving as more of a stuffing/side dish.

My quest for the perfect stuffing has ended. I have been waiting for a flavorful and moist stuffing recipe and this is simply terrific. I used about a little more than 10 cups of french bread, cut into about 1/2 in. pieces. I added about a cup of shredded gruyere to the eggs and cream. As another reviewer suggested, I let the thyme and garlic soak in the olive oil before drizzling over the bread cubes. I also added a little chervil to this mix. I subbed a red pepper for the green pepper. The earthiness of the mushrooms really came through. This was only made better by topping it with my boyfriend's homemade turkey gravy. I definitely didn't think this was too custardy. It had tons of flavor and an ideal texture. This will definitely be my go-to. The one change I will make next time is to add rosemary. And I will probably try this with sausage at some point. That would be fab.

I tested this dish as a possible side for Thanksgiving and i loved it! A couple of things i did: i let the thyme and garlic sit in the olive oil for awhile--wanted to really infuse the flavors into the bread cubes before toasting them. I used a combo of red/orange/yellow pepper (as i hate green pepper). I left out some of the custard as recommended by others--i wouldn't do that again. the top bread cubes were too dry and burned on the top. Rather, i would reserve some of the liquid and pour it over the bread before baking it--the bread really soaks it up and the top cubes could use some additional moisture. lastly, i would add gruyere and parm to the custard as others suggested. I highly recommend this dish; it will be on the thanksgiving menu this year!

I think I would leave out the green pepper next time, but the mushrooms were excellent and the french bread we used was perfect. I'd definitely make it again.

Loved this as a main course with a salad and a glass of wine on the deck for Easter Eve. Let me say that this is not a dressing or a stuffing. It is as the title says a "Savory Bread Pudding". I made it with a loaf of focaccia and excluded the celery, which I don't like. I also used a poblano instead of a bell pepper. Now, I think after mixing all of the ingredients it benefited from sitting and letting the bread absorb the liquid for about an hour. I also tented the dish in the oven. After sitting for ten minutes, I could cut the servings into squares. It was received with rave reviews.

I made this for Thanksgiving. Followed the recipe exactly, but when it came time to add the custard mixture, I probably left at least 1 cup out. It just looked like too much. So while this was not exacly super "custardy" it was moist and flavorful and everyone just couldn't stop saying how good it was. It was really more like stuffing than a bread pudding, but it was excellent.

I was disappointed with this recipe--and looks like I'm the only one. I thought the ratios in this recipe were all off. Didn't know if it was stuffing or an egg casserole. If I were to make it again, I'd halve the amount of bread and make it a brunch casserole for sure.

Absolutely delicious - perfect addition to traditional Thankgiving menu! I substituted leeks for onions as suggested and added grated gruyere cheese to the bread pudding mixture - modifications that I think really made the dish. This is really good left over and reheated. My answer to SOLA's question is that I would freeze it after its been cooked (it should freeze as well as quiche). I will definately make this again and will try it for brunch with the addition of sausage, bacon and/or ham. I would also like to try red pepper and/or yellow pepper in addition to or instead of green pepper.

i changed this recipe because i'm not a green bell pepper person. so instead i substituted, well, bacon. while i was waiting for the bread to toast, i chopped and fried 3 slices of bacon. then i removed them to a paper towel, and cooked the onion, celery, and mushrooms (i used cremini and chanterelle) in the bacon fat and 2 tbsp butter. i know, heart attack in a pan. anyway then i basically followed the recipe except i put a little of the parmesan in the custard mixture. because if most things are better with bacon, everything is better with CHEESE. it was fabulous. i also cut the bread cubes a little bigger than they recommend. SO GOOD. would try it without bacon since it does really affect the flavor of the dish, but i'm not complaining. this was seriously good. had it with a mimosa and it was a hell of a breakfast.

This is a wonderful recipe everyone will enjoy. I modified it by adding 1 cup shredded Gruyere, 1 cup shredded Swiss cheese, and thinly sliced Prosciutto.

This recipe is fantastic! The only thing you might want to change is the name. My coworkers thought it was a traditional bread pudding (dessert) which I had added mushrooms to. This is a dressing/stuffing that you soak with unsweetened egg custard and bake. The mushrooms add so much and the parmesan really makes this dish. This is definitely a keeper. The fam. loved it.

This is the most spectacular side dish I have every made. My family raves about it every time. They get so excited when I am making the "bread pudding". I have made it with ham and also for brunch. I did not substitute anything but you could use egg substitute to cut calories and fat. You will not be disappointed with this dish.

This was a HUGE hit at Thanksgiving yesterday, I had several people raving about it! I did, however, make a few changes that I think really made this dish. I used half pumpernickel rye bread and half country french for the cubes. I added fresh sage to the bread cubes (as well as the thyme). Instead of bell pepper, I used about a cup of chopped leeks--just the white and light green parts of course--I think that really took the dish to a new level!! I made sure to salt and pepper the veggies pretty liberally after I sauteed them, and I upped the salt in the cream mixture to about 3 tsp. It was perfect. I made this the night before, threw it in the fridge and baked it the next day. I will DEFINITELY be making this again.

Rating: 4
I made this recipe without testing it for a large brunch party and it was a total hit. I was afraid that it didn't have enough salt, so next time I would probably salt the sauteed vegetables after they've cooked. Otherwise, it is a very tasty and savory dish perfect for any time of the day.

made this for weekend guests and everyone loved it. i used half and half instead of the cream to make a dent in the calorie count. a huge plus for this recipe is that it is better if made the night before and refrigerated. a real timesaver when you have overnight guests

This is more of a strata than anything. I should have known by the number of eggs. Unfortunately it was not as I had hoped, and although delicious, didn't go at all with my meal. I recommend this as a delicious brunch or savory breakfast item.

This was great, but one-inch cubes are a little too big and made the bread cubes a little chewy. I asked my husband to cube the bread, and of course he took the one inch cube thing a little to literally, got out a tape measure and they were just too big. I would definitely try this again. I left out the bell pepper like another reviewer suggested and I can't imagine it with the pepper, the flavor was just right.

One of the best buffet dishes I've ever tried. I watched people take a small sample of it on their plate, take a bite, then run back to the buffet table and HEAP it on . I did make a couple of changes, instead of white bread I used rye, which gave it a wonderful flavor. Upped the salt to 3 teaspoons. To lighten it up a bit, used 2c 1/2 &/12 and 1.5 c milk. For the herbs, used thyme, sage, and rosemary. For the mushrooms used 1/2 cremini, 1/4 button, and 1/4 baby portobello. This recipe is easy, flexible, and very very tasty.

Excellent dressing. I like the fact it can be prepared ahead of time. Received rave reviews from guests. The custard is a nice contrast in texture from traditional dressings. Next time I will reduce the amount of green pepper. Only reason I didn't give it 4 forks, is my husband wants me to go back to the Mushroom and Leek Dressing from epicurious next year.

This recipe was good, but I was a little disappointed. In an effort not to give all consumers a heart attack, I used 2 cups of half & half and 1.5 cups of whole milk instead of the heavy cream, which was perhaps my mistake. As a stuffing, it's okay. As a vegetarian entree, which is what I was trying to create (for my first vegetarian Thanksgiving), it made me miss turkey, meat- filled stuffing and gravy. I feel that it lacked an interesting taste. I will probably make it again, but will possibly add spinach, broccoli or asparagus and, perhaps, soy sausage, plus hot sauce or a lot of red pepper flakes for a kick.

LOVED THIS DISH! My parents loved this. I prepared this for my mother who doesn't care for meat. Even my Dad, who doesn't like different foods in one dish, enjoyed this. I didn't change a thing, followed the recipe exactly. I was wondering if anyone has tried to substitute vegetable broth for all or a portion of the cream? I will be making this again, although not as frequently as I would like because it is just too calorie intensive.

This bread pudding is phenomenal, and so versatile! I used about half the recipe amount in an appetizer, by stuffing into mushroom caps. They baked beautifully and were all GONE in seconds. People couldn't even wait for them to cool off before eating. The next day, I baked the leftover second half of the pudding in a casserole dish and ate it as a light dinner with a simple winter salad. Both versions were great. (By the way: if you decide to stuff the pudding in mushroom caps, be sure to buy the biggest mushrooms you can find and cut the bread cubes a little smaller than indicated. Also, try to hollow out the caps as much as possible so that the button mushroom texture doesn't interfere with and overpower the wonderful - and expensive - morels in the pudding.)

Since I always have leftover sausage, mushroom & herb stuffing mix that does not all fit into the turkey cavity, I combined the egg mixture for this recipe with my stuffing to create my own savory bread pudding--delicious results!

Fab recipe - rich and wonderful! GONE at dinner. I left out the bell pepper (it just didn't sound right) and used extra celery & onion. For mushrooms, I used a combo of cremini, oyster, chanterelle, shitake & button. Took others advice and stepped up the salt & pepper in the custard - with delicious results.

Loved this. I used whipping cream instead of heavy whipping cream, and put it in ramekins instead of a casserole dish. It is a great do-ahead dish: the ramekins sat in the fridge for 24 hours, then went straight into the oven and cooked for 40 minutes. Came out perfect.

ridiculously rich! i followed the recipe exactly but i am curious if there is a way to decrease the fat even a little - would whole milk work if slightly whipped before added to the bread?

The bread rises to the top very nicely, giving better presentation than many casseroles. So easy, with pre-prep. I suggest loosely chopping the parsley. You can dream up substitutes galore with this fabulous bread base. -Next time, we will try to sub more of the heavy cream.

This is fabulous with many layers of savory flavors. I served as a Thanksgiving side and the only downside is this is incredibly hearty & filling so, we couldn't eat very much of it with the big dinner. I'd love to make it again as either the main course or as the only side with a poultry main. AMAZING flavors - and a great option for vegetarian diners.

Made this for a dinner party for 8 on Saturday night and it was a huge success. Followed the recipe exactly - used shitake, cremini and porcini mushrooms (mostly shitake and cremini - didn't want the porcini flavor to overwhelm the dish). Put it together the day before, refrigerated overnight, brought it to room temperature and baked for an hour - it was perfect!!! Will certainly make it again!!!

I tripled this recipe for a buffet for 35 and it was fantastic. I made it a day ahead and put it in the oven about two hours before dinner. I had many compliments (one guest reported back to her mother that I had served a delicious "blood" pudding) and I will certainly make it again. It's perfect for a buffet because it can be made well ahead, can be multiplied, and is not standard buffet fare.

I took this to Thanksgiving dinner and it was a huge hit! I used shitake, portabello and white mushrooms. I added more salt and pepper to the custard mix to give it extra flavor and was glad I did.

This was a hit at our Thanksgiving table. Several people asked for the recipe. I used three kinds of mushrooms - button, crimini, and shiitake. I also subbed in 1 c. 1% milk, instead of using all cream. (I rarely make subs the first time I make a recipe, but hopefully this didn't change the flavour, just "lightened" it up a bit.) We all thought this would make a great brunch dish, too (á la the Tahoe brunch strata); accompanied by sausages, fruit salad and a green salad.

I used this as my dressing for Thanksgiving dinner since I had a boned out turkey breast for my meat entree. This is very rich as stated before. I used baby bellos,shitakes and dried morels. All the flavors blended well together with the turkey that was served. I offered a port wine gravy to top the pudding which really brought out the mushroom flavors and went well with my bird. My only caution is make sure you season the custard with enough salt and pepper or it could turn out very bland.

Although this dish is very rich, it is also really good (every once in a while). Actually, this recipe is very similar to one of Emeril's, except his featured artichoke hearts, spinach, and cubed Brie cheese! I think I could have a lot of fun with changing up the flavors...

I just got done making this and shared 1/2 with my neighbors. MMMMMM! I'm picking at the left overs as I write! I pretty much followed the recipe amounts to the T. I halved the recipe to test before Thanksgiving. I used 3 different types of onions that needed to be used up,(shallots, red and a brown.) and I only had Portebellos on hand. I ONLY use the frozen tri colored peppers form Trader Joes. I added a couple of LARGE dashes of hot sauce to the cream. Make sure you use FRESH herbs and ground pepper. For some reason I can't make stuffing, so this is an absoultly fabulous replacement! A definate keeper. Enjoy!
