Made this tonight and followed the suggestions of others to reduce the water by 1/4 cup. It came out quite well. I served it over some fresh fruit salad. I used Bob's Red Mill Tapioca.

Also found this to be quite liquidy. Could be variation in brand used? Used coconut milk instead of cream, which may have also effected the outcome. Strawberry and fennel is delicious. Despite not congealing, great, so have called it tapioca soup!

I enjoyed this very much. After I made the recipe as written, I decided to make a couple of minor changes. I increased the tapioca to 1/2 cup as we like it thicker. Then, instead of the strawberry/fennel route as strawberries are out of season, I chopped up some fresh mango and put that on top. I also have sometimes topped it up with a bit of coconut milk. Very refreshing.

I'm so glad I tried this! It's mango season here, so I used 3 small mangoes spiked with the juice of 1 lime in place of the strawberries. I also belatedly realised that I had only about 1/2 cup of cream (after reducing the water by 1/4 cup as per the other reviews). However, it was still creamy enough and I think I would keep the lower amount of cream next time. The mango was delicious with the tapioca and I would make it again without hesitation. I'm looking forward to trying it with strawberries and fennel. In fact, many fruits and herb/seed combos would go well with this (Peach and mint? Orange and rosewater? Cherries and cardamom?).

I reduced the water by 1/4cup and the tapioca set gorgeously. I actually found the strawberries overwhelmed the tapioca - I think it would be better with some stewed apples or rhubarb. This only made 3 decent sized serving for me.

I made this with raspberries instead of strawberries and it was great. I'll make it again.

Like the other reviewers, the pudding didn't set up properly. There was too much liquid and I never got the tapioca portion to rise to the top. So, I ended up stirring it together, creating a less dramatic, overall pink-colored dessert. Next time, I would probably add some sugar to the strawberries. The ones I used were not sweet enough.

Made the recipe exactly as writtten, however pudding never thickened (as several othre reviewers noted). I will try it again with a little less water.

Great summer dessert, can see it using all kinds of summer fruit and even winter berries although, the strawberry fennel is great.Light and satisfying, even for breakfast. I found the recipe if followed comes out exact.

I substituted the water with rum. Absolutely delicious!

This is my new favourite recipe. It seems like a lot of liquid at first but if you follow the recipe through to the end, following exactly, it sets perfectly. I used regular tapioca pearls, not instant, and nothing else was needed. The only change I would make is adding a touch more sugar and a dash of fresh lemon juice to the strawberries.

I also found that this will not set up as written. I actually made it twice thinking I did something wrong the first time, bought new tapioca...no diff. I think it is missing an egg yolk or two which I found in every other tapioca pudding recipe. Instant would be a quicker alt. but wouldn't be as good as the real deal. The fennel could be even a bit more for my taste. 1 fork as-is, maybe 3 if it worked. )PS 1 qt strawbeeries is about 1 1/2 lbs.)

Lovely final result, however, recipe iinstructions and quantities not accurate. There was too much liquid for the amount of tapioca pearls and the pudding would not thicken. Solved the problem by adding instant tapioca and cooking longer....once fixed the pudding together with the strawberries was delightful.
