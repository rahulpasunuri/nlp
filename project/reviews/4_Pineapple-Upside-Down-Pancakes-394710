make sure the pineapple is room temp before making. They can be made ahead and reheated.

Amazing! I made these as directed, but did not put them in the oven and they still turned out fantastic. I'd recommend making a bit more rum syrup and adding a dollop of whipped cream on top just before serving.

We had these today for Mother's Day brunch--fantastic! My daughter did the pineapple & I made the batter, which was very easy. The 5 adults enjoyed these & the grand kids enjoyed Cottage Pancakes. Served with bacon for the meat eaters, Mimosas & tea & coffee & all were in a state of bliss!

OMG! These are SOOOOOO good. I just made them for breakfast, and my sons and I loved them. I had canned pineapple in juice on hand so used that. I added the juice and more brown sugar and reduced to a wonderful syrup after removing the pineapple. I made the pancakes in 2 batches on my griddle. The first was a bit too done when adding the pineapple as the recipe states. In the second batch, I put the pineapple on when the batter was still wet, cooked and then flipped. I finished them in the oven as directed; no gooey center. This would be an awesome recipe for Easter brunch since it holds well in the oven. Make sure you have ice cold milk on hand. YUM!
