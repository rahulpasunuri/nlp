This was very good but needs adjustment. First, after I made as directed it did not look like enough for 4 so I added another 2 oz. of pasta. Second, this will make WAY more dressing than you need. Even after adding more pasta I did not use all of it and can only imagine was an oily mess it would have been if I had. DH, who doesn't normally like pasta salad, loved this and I thought it was very good too. I omitted the feta as I don't like it.

This pasta salad was boring and had an unpleasant after taste. The feta was extremely strong and the recipe was severely lacking pizazz. I would not make it again.

This has become one of my favorite pasta salads! I used bow ties, red & green pepper, artichokes and a bit of garlic. Dressing required a bit more sweetener for my taste. Got rave reviews and leftovers held up in the fridge for days. Yum!

Like other reviewers suggested, I used rotini and smoked gouda with good results, and added a couple cloves of garlic. Be careful, though - the garlic is nice, but it can overpower the salad. I would recommend starting with one clove and adding more to taste after the salad has set a while. My husband also suggested a very tasty addition which we found delicious: chopped pepperoncini which we had on hand. Gave it a nice little kick to offset the cheese and olves. Made this for the second time last night - my husband's co-workers are calling this The Famous Pasta Salad, so it goes over well with a crowd.

I used bowtie pasta and the suggested Newmans balsamic vinagarete to save time.you could use any varity of cheeses as well and it would turn out as good.

Tasty & easy to make. Used bowtie pasta and 1/2 cup of Newman's Own Balsamic Vinegarette, 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, 1/4 cup of white vinegar, then added a little more olive oil & vinegar to taste after whisking. Added dash of ground pepper, and 2 cloves of freshly ground garlic. Kept tasting along the way, adding sugar to taste. For me, I liked it sweeter & added about 4 pinches of sugar. Only had 2 cheeses on hand, feta and asiago, which is terrific when grated fresh and added that bite of salt that went well with the olives. This will be a staple pasta salad - BIG hit at my summer dinner party.

I gave this four forks because it is so adaptable. I have made this countless times for bbq's, lunches, etc. Use whatever cheeses you have and in a rush, I have even used Annie's Naturals Tuscan Italian Dressing or Newman's Balsamic Dressing - the ratios are perfect!

This is a wonderful pasta salad that holds well in the refrigerator. I used the smoked gouda -- and really enjoyed it. Also, I added a can of artichoke hearts (and I don't think it needed them). The vinaigrette does need more than a "pinch" of salt -- taste it before mixing with the salad -- it tastes pretty sour - maybe more like a few generous pinches....

What a fresh-tasting salad! Much lighter than a cream version. Wonderful. I made a double batch and shared it with my parents who also loved it. It makes a great light meal or side dish. I used smoked gouda, which was really good, both red and green bell pepper, and also added a can of artichoke hearts like another had suggested in a previous review, and salt and pepper. It might also benefit from a pinch more sugar to offset the sour of the vinegar a bit more. This is now my favorite pasta salad. Great recipe! :)

Wonderful! I made it for a family party over the weekend and I am craving it again. I didn't even make it "right" (used extra pasta and not enough olive oil) and it was still delicious. As others have said, is very forgiving and accomdating of variation. I added artichoke hearts, a little chopped garlic, and used regular black olives. Next time I would skip the gouda, as it didn't add much.

This is a wonderful Pasta Salad. I took the advice of the some of the previous postings; used bow-tie pasta, added minced garlic to the dressing. It first appears to be too much dressing, but the dressing soaks in. I make it the night before I serve it. Make extra copies of the recipe, you'll need it!

This is very good, but the dressing really does need a few cloves of minced garlic - it's just too bland without it!

Perfect for a hot summer night or picnic. My group loved it & asked for the reciepe - a sure hit when that happens! I didn't change a thing & it was perfect.

I made this recipie with freshly grated asagio and coarsely grated romano, and it was wonderful. I actually soaked the feta in the dressing (it was a mistake, originally, as I I had an emergency) but it came out wonderful. I also find that if this can be left overnight in the fridge, it has (like most things) a better flavor.

Here's a presentation warning: I used large shells and balsamic vineagar and transformed a beautiful salad into one that looked like it contained large brown bugs. Next time I would use tricolor pasta and red wine vineagar to go with the cheese better. Good recipe. Everyone loved it. I sliced the Gouda instead of shredded and used regular olives, the recipe suggests too much oil and vinegar. Otherwise great.

Sorry, but I found this recipe terribly bland. I even tried to "kick it up a notch" (as good old Emeril would say) by using pesto noodles, adding a good amount of garlic,using basil and tomato flavored feta, and adding sun dried tomatoes packed in oil. I wouldn't cut back on the amount of oil, as suggested by a previous review, because it would be too dry. Lots of cheese, fat, and calories wasted on a lame recipe.

This salad is very good and makes a nice colorful presentation with the white feta, black olives, red peppers etc... I was worried it would be too salty with the feta and the K. olives, but it was fine.

I've made this pasta salad numerous times for picnics and pot lucks and it's a hit every time. I've even been asked to make it again. The only changes I made to the recipe is to use balsamic vinegar instead of basil or red wine vinegar and use bow tie pasta for better presentation.

I made this pasta salad for my 8yr olds birthday dinner. My whole family loved it, even my 10yr old who didnt think she liked olives. Definitely a keeper.

This is a good recipe...HOWEVER, it really does need chopped up garlic in the dressing,or it's just way too bland. I use tri-colour penne pasta..don't be afraid to use all that olive oil - if anything, use more! I also use about a 1/2 tsp of dry mustard in the dressing - helps to bind it. Very good!

Made it for a BBQ and got complimented. Overall very good, but here was my experience. 1) shells stick together for me no matter what I do (have tried olive oil with no luck) so I would choose a different medium size pasta next time 2) used only half of the dressing mixture because it was moist at first, but refrigerated it overnight and it was dry the next day (maybe overnight is too long) 3) the gouda was so soft that it lost its appearance when mixed in so I would go with chunks instead of grating it next time.

This was very good. I added hearts of palm & used garlic in the dressing and half balsamic & half red wine vinegar. Like some other cooks I used at bit less olive oil. I used all of the cheeses and would not omit any of them. Will make again and will refrigerate for at least 12 hours.

This recipe received excellent reviews, especially from some some rather picky eaters. I was concerned that the salad contained too much cheese, so I used only the feta, and omitted the gouda and cheddar. The flavor was superb and not compromised; I don't think additional cheese is necessary. Also, as suggested by other reviewers, I added two large cloves of minced garclic, which gave the salad a nice punch of flavor.

I liked all the ingredients that went into this salad except I was a little nervous about the amount of olive oil. After assembly, but before refrigeration, I tasted it and all I could taste was olive oil (and I had skimped on it). Much to my surprise, it tasted great after sitting overnight. I used regular black olives, diced the Gouda and added a clove of garlic. The Feta is a must, but the other cheeses and veggies could easily be changed.

It's awful when one review brings down the ratings on a dish that should get 100%. I have been making this pasta dish for years. Everyone who has ever tried it loves it. It is flavorful (I can't stand bland) and delicious. I usually add chopped artichoke hearts (not marinated) and sliced hearts of palm along with the red-pepper. Sometimes I add crisp-steamed asparagus, chopped into bite-size pieces...there are so many things you can do to vary the recipe and make it different. Or make it exactly as they say...it is always good! (I have never made it with Kalamata olives but use regular California black olives).

I made this pasta salad for card club and the women thoroughly enjoyed it. I made the following changes to the recipe: diced the Gouda cheese rather than shred it; used 1/2 cup olive oil and 1/4 cup vegetable oil; half as much fresh basil; and most importantly, to the olive/vege oil I added 1 TBSP Penzey's Country French Dressing Mix (see their web page). This added just the right about of seasoning to make it very flavorful.

Just took this to a party and received lots of compliments! Used a little minced garlic also,, which gave it more flavor. Very tasty, though could not find the olives pitted anywhere, and had to do them myself, which was very time consuming....

Remember the song "A Summer Place"? Well that's what the taste of this salad reminds me of! Make it on a summer afternoon and you will wonder where it was all your life. Read all the substitutions and forget them; Try it as written and you'll not regret it!!!

This recipe was so-so. After letting it stand for a few hours I tasted it, and found it uninspiring. I used one readers advice and added a clove of garlic to the dressing. I also used half red-wine vinegar and balsamic. To try and boost the flavour I added about 1/2 cup of sun dried tomatoes, 2 tsp of dijon,& a tsp of salt to the remaining dressing. It was acceptable with the additions.
