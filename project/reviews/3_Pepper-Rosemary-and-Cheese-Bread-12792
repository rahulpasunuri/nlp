This is a lousy combination of flavors. In short the taste is not so good. This dough came out sticky. Is that because of the added moisture in the cheese? Pass this one by and choose another recipe.

Very tasty. I had no problem with the dough, in fact I only used 1/2 cup of that last cup of flour. I did however leave out the red peppers (could that be the cause of the other reviewers problem with stickyness?). I followed the rest of the directions to the letter and I too use my Kitchen Aid mixer for kneading.

I am not a baker - but this bread turned out fantastic!! Unlike the other reviews, mine was not sticky and was actually very easy to work with... with that said, I made the following changes. I omitted the roasted peppers and added additional cracked pepper. Also, I din't add the olive oil until the kneading process, and rubbed it in. This bread went perfectly with white bean soup!

This bread was not easy to work with at all and I had decided when I put it in the oven that I would never make it again. Two very beautiful, very tasty loaves of bread emerged and I feel that I will give this another try.The texture and flavour were really good. I did have to add a lot of extra flour and it was still so sticky that I could barely even turn it in the bowl to oil the top. So....., difficult to work with but delicious. A quick pointer. I put everything in my kitchen aid mixer and worked it with a dough hook, I can see no possibility of working with this bread any other way but I am certainly open to suggestion.

Excellent! I did end up having to add at least an extra cup of flour, the dough was pretty sticky, but it ended up making really good tasting and pretty bread - would make again for sure.
