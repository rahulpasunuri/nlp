Loved this. Made only the fruit, serving it as a light dessert after an already high protein meal. Really improved the flavor of beautiful-looking but less that perfect- tasting apricots. A lovely treat for early- summer.

Bay added great depth...made whipped cream instead of yogurt. Nice recipe.

This was a sleeper hit at our 4th of July brunch/family reunion. I served them on ricotta pancakes with a mascapone/yogurt cream. They were delicious. I might try fewer bay leaves the next time around - which there will be!

I had this at a dinner party for dessert and it was outstanding! Of course you have to be a fruit lover to appreciate this dish. The granola brittle was a great accompaniment to the fruit and yogurt. I was given some to take home and ate it the next morning! Delicious!!!
