I loved the sauce. I didn't think it was "too much" of anything. I used dried rosemary crushed in a mortar and pestle to release the essential oils, I thought the sauce cooked down to a thick delicious consistency but had a bright fresh tomato flavor. Perfect to go with sausages. I grilled my sausages outside along with some Chibata to soak up the sauce. It was wonderful and now I have left over sauce for pasta!

Very rustic and subtle flavor. Good recipe using items already on hand. (Yes, including the dried mushrooms--only $2.99 @ Trader Joe's for .75 oz...)

Very nice! I left the fresh rosemary in sprigs, and pulled them out when I served the sauce (even when chopped, rosemary always seems too "pine-needly" to me, but the flavor is great.) Left out the porcini (husband doesn't like mushrooms.)

I'm not a big sausage fan, but since others in the house are, I thought this would be a good cold weather entree. And it was - very hearty and rich. I'd put in less rosemary if I made it again. Served it with cheese ravioli and the sauce went well with it.

Simple and delicious. Even better the next night. I used fresh tomatoes from the garden.

We Love this recipe ! I serve it with Creamy Parmesan Polenta ( Gourmet Nov. 99 ) and a tossed salad ... it's requested often .

Almost a 4 fork...Fairly simple to make and very flavourful...It couples deliciously with the baked polenta and fontina cheese...I leave the meat OUT as I do not "do" red meats...Enjoy! I do!
