I thought the port and dates would go into the chicken. Serving them as a sauce didn't work well, too liquid.

I don't regret making this dish, but I certainly wouldn't make it again. The combination of ingredients sounds a lot more promising than it turned out. It's odd that you end up with 2 sauces (that from the fig & port wine) and the other from the chicken itself. The sauce cooked with the chicken is uninteresting and dominated by the taste of the chicken broth (meaning little impact is made by the port wine). Maybe making my own chicken broth would've helped. The flavor from the figs in port wine was not nearly as complex as it seemed it should be. It's possible that combining all the sauces together (at some point - not sure when) would've made a better dish, but I don't plan on making this again to find out. Also, I don't think it had anything to do with ingredients. I used fresh figs and tomatoes from our yard, top of line prosciutto and organic chicken.... Not a cheap dish to come out so mediocre.

Tomatoes, figs, coriander were all from my garden. Used homemade chicken stock. This is tastey good - a keeper.

Delicious! I used packaged pitted dates instead of figs and it was yummy.
