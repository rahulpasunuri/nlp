This is a nice variation on "plain" creme brulee. I didn't have any vanilla beans, so I just used a teaspoon of vanilla extract, and the flavor was very good. I baked it in individual ramekins, which took about the same baking time. This also assured that the rice, which settles to the bottom, was evenly distributed among servings.

Either make rice pudding or make creme brulee - this "combination" didn't work for me.

This recipe was so delicious..the flavours and consistency were perfect. I added raisins and a sprinkle of cinnamon. I served it just as rice pudding and did not do the second step to make it creme brulee. It was so good that I am making it again for a holiday gathering...

Not bad, but if you're a creme brulee purist the rice just doesn't do it. If you love rice pudding, this one's for you. Nice flavor, but the rice was a distraction for me.

This was so good, I made it twice in one week. Made it with the topping first...a bit sweet...so, I made it without the topping the next time and thought it was better.
