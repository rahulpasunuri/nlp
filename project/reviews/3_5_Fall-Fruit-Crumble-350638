I used pears and apples that didn't have much natural juice, I guess, if I made it again I would add a tsp of lemon for acidity and 1/4 of water or apple juice.

I am not going to rate the recipe because I made changes, but one thing is obvious: the cooking time needs to be longer than 20 minutes - the cranberries were still whole and the apples were crisp-tender. Most crumble recipes call for 40 to 60 minutes cooking time. Anyway, I used a whole bag of cranberries and two apples and, obviously, more sugar. I'd make it more even between cranberries and apples next time. I think pears would be lost in there. I also added the extra 1/2 cup of oatmeal suggested by other cooks. I dunno, I think next time I'd add some nuts instead.

Boy was this a hit at my house ! I made just two minor changes while cutting the recipe to make four good sized servings. A bit less sugar and a healthy extra dose of oatmeal. Served it with vanilla ice cream and not a drop was left over.

This was yummy!! Made it for a small dinner party tonight and my guests had seconds. I made the crumble ahead of time and kept it covered then just before sitting down to dinner I cut up the fruit and mixed it and popped it into the oven while we ate. Used brown sugar for the crumble, next time I think I'll add a little cinnamon. Definitely a keeper!

This is my go to fruit crumble. The topping is perfection and is even better after it has cooled- the combination of the flour and oatmeal (use 1.5 cups oatmeal) makes a substantial crumble. Way better than the fall apart fruit crisps you usually get. I don't think its too sweet as written, but its still delicious with less sugar. Sometimes I add pear brandy in with the vanilla extract= heaven!

Great and very easy. I added what ever fruit I got my hands on, apples, nectarins, peaches and strawberries. Because I used different fruit I should have cut back on the sugar. It does need an additional 10 minutes to get the crisp finish - I've got another baking in the oven right now, can't wait!

Key recipe! Easy and fast and delicious!!! Test run for the family the week before Thanksgiving and we devoured it, and made it yesterday for Thanksgiving and got several requests for the recipe. I think the cranberries (I used fresh) make it a standout, visually as well as adding a little tart zing. I agree, use 1.5 cups of oatmeal, and brown sugar for the topping makes it extra yummy. A keeper

This dessert fit the bill for a rainy, fall evening here. It was fast and the clean-up was easy since there were so few dishes. A few notes: - the cranberry flavor overpowered the flavor; next time we'll reduce the cranberries to 1-1/3 cup (instead 2 cups) - the fruit was a bit too sweet for our liking; next time we plan to cut the sugar in the fruit mixture by half - I agree with one of the other reviews that the crumble could use more oats. Probably 1-1/3 cup ought to do it.

I was in a hurry and didn't read the recipe carefully - forgot to add the extra half-cup sugar to the topping! Everyone still ate it. Peronally I thought it could have used a little more sugar but those who prefer desserts a little less sweet liked it. Maybe cutting the sugar in half for the topping would be about right. Loved the cranberries.

I was disappointed in this. It was extremely sweet. Any difference between the apple and the pear was imperceptible, masked by the overly sweet taste. While cranberries provided a needed contrast, it was not enough to overcome the sugar.

One of the easiest and best crumbles I've made. I used unripe Bosc pears and Granny Smith apples. I found that 1 cup of rolled oats was not quite enough and added about 1/2 cup extra to the butter-oatmeal mixture just before baking; this worked out well and created a slightly more substantial topping. I also sprinkled some allspice and cinnamon on the top, which was delicious. Served it warm from the oven with ice cream and everyone loved it.

I made this yummy dessert the first day I received the magazine, and I just can't stop making it!!! Everyone has loved it, and many have asked for the recipe. So simple and so tasty. I have had to bake it about 10 minutes longer than the recipe suggest.

Wonderful! Very easy to put together, then pop in the oven while cooking dinner. It came out of the oven as we sat down to dinner then cooled a little while we ate, then we topped it with a scoop of Blue Bell homemade vanilla ice cream. The whole family loved it!

I loved it. It was a great year for apples and pears in my area, so I made several crisps this year. I liked the addition of the pears and I loved the cranberries. Was delicious just out of the oven and was delicious for breakfast the next day.

Delicious, festive combination. The accent of the fresh cranberries added a new note to ordinary apple crisp. My guests enjoyed it and asked for the recipe. I used Jonagold apples and Bartlett pears. I had to extend the baking time. After 20 minutes @ 425°F, using an oven thermometer to verify temperature, it was only about half-baked. It did not achieve " juices are bubbling and topping is golden brown" until it had baked for an additional 20-25 minutes (40-45 minutes total).

Easy and tasty - dinner guests raved. Made the crust in a food processor and it came out great. Thought that using gala apples, as mentioned in the recipe, would result in mush, but it didn't, probably because it's only in the oven for twenty minutes. Served with honey vanilla ice cream on the side. Made the fruit part before dinner and let it sit; was glad to see that the fruit didn't brown. Had the dry part of the crust sitting ready in the food processor, then added the butter to it to finish it, assembled it, and put it in the oven. So, it works as a partly "do ahead" dessert.

Really good and so easy. I used whatever apples and pears I had on hand. Delicious.

My family and I love this!!! I love the way the cranberries bring in the red color to an otherwise plain colored apple crisp! Also, the flavor of the cranberries is nice and tart - I also added orange zest and a bit of cinnamon.

This recipe is not only quick and easy, it's also delicious. I increased the number of apples and pears to 3 each, used brown sugar for the crumb topping, and increased the baking time to 30 minutes. Everyone loved it.

Easy to prepare and very satisfying on a fall rainy night. Tart and not too sweet. I used The Silver Palate Thick and Rough Oatmeal and baked it for 25 minutes.

This is a very easy and simple desert that is quite tasty to eat warm with vanilla ice cream.
