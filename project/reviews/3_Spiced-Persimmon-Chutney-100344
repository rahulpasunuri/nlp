I made this with 4 persimmons, 1 cup of apple cider vinegar, about 1 tbsp of honey instead of raisins, and, because I don't have coriander, I added cardamom like other reviewers did. The major difference between my experience and the recipe is the amount of time this needs to simmer. The recipe says to boil then simmer for a total of 30 minutes. However, my chutney was still completely liquidy after 30 min, so I simmered for another 90 minutes on low heat. That's how long it took to thicken. It is REALLY tart. I would recommend using even less than 1 cup of the vinegar. Too strong by itself, but I hope it will be tasty on chicken or some other dish that can handle an explosion of flavor. This is a fun thing to try and a great use of persimmons.

I make this recipe every year at Thanksgiving. It is a real family favorite and has been picked up by other family members as well. I reduce the vinegar to 1 cup and use up to 3 cups of the Fuyu persimmons. I do remove the seeds from the jalapeno but use a fairly large one. The spiciness is one of the features of this chutney. Lovely color on the plate.

This recipe requires that the persimmons be completely RIPE. I only use a dash of cider vinegar, and the rest is Apple wine. I have made it with only wine. When it's done right, its four forks.

I thought this was delicious - I did cut down to one cup of vinegar, added cinnamon and cardamom, and then added an extra cup of persimmon with a splash of orange juice and reduced. I will definitely be making this again. Especially loved the heat from the jalapeno.

This was way to vinegary, even after cutting down to one cup-and I like tart things. I'll make it again, but I'll use more fruit overall, and I'll cut it into larger pieces. Some additional heat via crushed red pepper would have been nice.

Way too much vinegar... Good Flavors- but it needs to be toned down!!!

I made this recipe by using closer to three cups of diced persimmons, rather than 2 1/2, as called for in the recipe. I also used cardamom rather than coriander. It was a huge hit! I would definitely make this recipe again.

Chutneys are indeed supposed to be a bit vinegary, but this one is a little vinegary for chutney novices. The flavor is fabulous, however. I would suggest reducing the vinegar from 1 1/2 cups to 1 cup to cut the vinegar taste.

I may just be very new to chutneys but do they need to be vinegar based? I love vinegar but the flavor was too overpowering. I have an awesome persimmon tree and would love to use them in as many recipes as possible so I may try this again, but without as much vinegar. I am totally open to any suggestions, thanks!

Terrific, but some might like a bit more spice. I added a good pinch of dried red pepper flakes, some cinnamon, and a few mangoes, and used golden raisins. The gradation of colors was lovely. Also doubled the recipe and processed in a boiling water bath for 10 min. so we can enjoy it all year and share with friends

A very exotic chutney-not for beginner chutney eaters!! I'll make this again sometime.

This chutney was awful, I had to throw it out. No forks form me, plus my house smelled bad from the vinegar. I have never made chutney before and thought a recipe from Bon Appetit would be wonderful, what a disappointment. I have tryed other recipes from Epicurious and really enjoyed them, but not this one.

I added cinnamon to this for an added dimension to the mix. It will forevermore be a thanksgiving standby; all seemed to love it as much as I did.
