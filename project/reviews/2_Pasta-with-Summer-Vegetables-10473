Gave one fork cos I didn't really make this recipe. After all the comments I improvised. Grated the zucchini, added grated carrots, basil, pine nuts, paprika and grated Pecorino Romano instead of parmesan. Oh I also added chopped sundried tomatoes. It is a pasta salad. So what? It's very nice! Btw, it makes tons.

Recipe was good but should be called "pasta salad" because that's actually what it is.

I agree with the "blah" review from someone else. It just didn't have much flavor at all. If you make this, be prepared to spend some time doctoring it up!

I liked this recipe very much, but i am a fan of favas. I found the amount of olive oil to be perfect, but I used a first-press oil rather than a plain extra-virgin; this avoided the whole supermarket-style cloyingly drippy mess of adding more to get flavor. I substituted asparagus for zucchini which enhanced the favas, and used home roasted red peppers instead of yellow for a dish that had the colors of the Italian flag. I made certain to cut the asparagus to match the size of the gemmellini and served it room temperature, and I was "contento come una pasqua"

For all of the prep work involved, this was not a very impressive meal. At all. I would change ALOT in it if I were to make it again. I would definately load up on the extra virgin olive oil (which I ended up adding when I first made it), add more garlic, omit the fava beans (yuk) and use roasted pine nuts instead. Add lots more parmesan (instead of just using for a garnish, add right in to the dish when making it). I think, with all of these variations, I would make it again. I also think, with the variations, this would make a good summer pasta salad as well. But, as the recipe stands, it's pretty blah without some "doctoring up".
