Really boring. In winter months I eat a ton of shellfish, and I like to think I've gotten pretty good with them . The flavours in the sauce were mediocre, and it just never came together. I found it particularly bland - even with red pepper flakes added. I kind of feel like I have to apologize to my littleneck friends for doing them a disservice. I'm sorry my locally-grown organically-harvested Ocean-Wise(tm) Sawmill Bay Manilla mollusk pals. You were just too good for this. Just too good. I will avenge your misuse in my next steamer pot!

a very simple good recipe, after many trials i found using half the lemon portion. less olive oil but by adding some (unsalted) butter and a seeded red chilli makes a surprising difference... enjoy

As far as I'm concerned, you can cut up an entire bulb of garlic for this recipe. To cut calories, just use 1/4 c of olive oil. It does the job cooking the garlic. I used 2# of scallops instead of 3# of clams. Add 1 tsp of salt plus fresh ground pepper and red pepper flakes. I doubled the lemon juice AND put in the zested peel. Go to this recipe when you have just bought a bunch of Italian parsley and don't want it to go bad in the fridge. After adding the wine and lemon juice, simmer for about three minutes more: don't overcook the scallops.

Have made many times. I always double the lemon juice. Often substitute shrimp or shrimp an scallops (total weight 1.5 - 2 lbs)

EASY AND FABULOUS! USED COCKLES BECAUSE MY FISH MONGER SAID THEY WOULD BE SWEETER AND A DELICATE ANGEL HAIR PASTA., AND ADDED RED PEPPER FLAKES FOR A BIT OF KICK, GREAT!

This was great-simple to make, light and good for summer. Comparable to spaghetti alle vongole in restaurants.

I have made this many, many times and it is always fabulous. We eat at many of the "best" restaurants in New York City, and my husband swears that none of them a better linguine with clams than this.

I have made this dish twice and I will definitely make it again! It is so easy, but so delicious! I followed the recipe as described, but added a little grated lemon peel together with the lemon juice. It adds a fresh flavour without the sourness.

This was the 1st time I had Italian parsley. If I had known what it tasted like in advance I would have substituted it for another herb. Thankfully the parsley taste wasn't as strong as dill, otherwise I would have had to throw it all away. Dill makes me gag. Parsley has a smiliar HERBY flavor to it that I dislike. Otherwise dish is OK. Just OK. Definately light (in a refreshing way). I would only make this dish one more time, with an italian blend seasoning mix, to see if tasted better.

This is easy, fresh and delicious- I'm making it again tonight. I have to dbl the recipe because everyone comes back for more. When you've been cooking meat every night for dinner and want a change and don't want fish- this is it. Very refreshing.

This has become the dish of the week at my home. My 8 year old son loves it as well as all the grown ups in the house. It's quick and delicious.

I have made this recipe again and again since it appeared in the magazine years ago. It's easy to make as is or is fun to add other ingredients. It works well as an appetizer w/o the pasta. I've mixed mussels and clams, and have added pieces of fresh goat cheese and basil chiffonade to the broth instead of the parsley. I've also added chopped fresh tomato and crushed red pepper flakes. It has been terrific each time. Soak up the broth with a rustic loaf of Italian bread.

Easy to make. The Italian Parsley is a must. I added one chopped Roma Tomato for color, and I may try some Capers. This Recipe could certainly substitute scallops or other favorite seafoods.

It's light and lemmony. Drained water from 2 cans of babby clams in lieu of unavailable fresh, and added red pepper flakes to taste and lots of grated parm. I know it's a hit when someone else puts up whats left before I can get to it.

This was my first attempt at a recipe with fresh clams. The pasta was fabulous. I made it exactly as the recipe specified, and both my boyfriend and I loved it. Would definitely make it again.

Please give this a try...it's too easy and too good! This is a great recipe and VERY simple. Just make sure you don't overcook the clams or the spaghetti (it must be al dente) and that's it. It's pretty foolproof in my opinion and very impressive. Yum.

I would definitely make this recipe again! I made the recipe just the way it was printed. Make sure that you use fresh lemon juice and the Italian parsley, there are not a lot of ingredients so use the best! The flavors were perfect even though you use 8 cloves of garlic, it is not too strong!

this one of those easy one bowl-one pot wonders. dinners's cleaned up before you sit down. we served it loaves of crusty bread and skipped the pasta, much more fun. Easy and one pot cleANUP. CAN GET ANY LUCKIER.

first time I made it I followed the recipe, and I thought is was really greasy. 1/2c of oil is way too much. 2nd time I used about 1T of oil and I liked it a lot better, I still think it needs a little more zing. maybe some crushed red pepper next time?

I have made this recipe on many occasions to rave reviews.I have also substituted fresh shrimp inplace of clams remembering that the shrimp cook faster so add them in a touch later. Bueno!!!!!

I the first time I made this dish I sliced the garlic but that was much too tedious. The second time I made this dish I just crushed it so that I could pick out the pieces later. It still tasted delicious and took far less time! You can't go wrong with this dish.

This was delicious! The first time I made it I cut down the garlic (8 cloves seemed like a lot) and used bottled lemon juice. I second time I made it, I used the full 8 cloves of garlic and fresh lemon juice. It made a huge difference. It was much better the second time.

I love clams and the combined flavours of extra virgin olive oil, garlic, parsley and lemon. This was a very quick and easy dish to prepare and the end product was absolutely delicious. I can't wait to make it again.

This recipe was not as good as i thought it would be. The other reviewers have hyped it up too much. However, it was really simple to make, i didnt know what kind of wine to use (because im 17 with no previous experience cooking wine, just drinking it ;) hehe) make a lemon parsely garlic butter, spead it over a baugette, toast lightly, yum!

I made this dish while on vacation in the Amalfi Coast using tiny clams from the Mediterranean and those huge Sorrentine lemons. It was unbelievably delicious! I'm making it tonight for company back home with little necks, Hope to have similar results.

Unbelievably delicious. The best spaghetti and clam sauce recipe I've eaten.

This dish is excellent -- just as wonderful as the spaghetti alle vongole I've eaten in Italy. I love the bright, freshness of the lemon, which is what distinguishes it from some other dishes I made. I did cut the olive oil in half, but using excellent olive oil makes all the difference.

Fantastic! The next time I serve this, I am going to issue bibs.

I have now made this dish twice. It is probably my favorite clam sauce. The flavors are clean and bright - good blance between the white wine, the lemon and the clams. Because the clams are not cooked in excessive liquid, the broth is full of flavor. It is perfect as is.

We have access to fresh clams on the coast of SC and this was the best and easiest clam recipe I've every tried. Tried many similar to this one, but this was the best.
