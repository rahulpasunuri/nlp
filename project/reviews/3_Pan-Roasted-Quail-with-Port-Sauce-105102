The marinade was terrible and the quail tasted exactly like wine and maple syrup. No quail flavor came through. Next time I'll just grill them plain. I even deboned them and made stock of the backs and wings.

Buy the quail at an ethnic Aisan market. I paid $6.95 for six in Portland, OR They were packaged in GA Will make tomorrow and review

I only gave this 3 forks because, not only was it not a WOW, it was a lot of work. I followed the recipe eactly except for using more beef broth and less water. The simmering process for the sauce reduced it down to nothing. The recipe does not tell you how much liquid you are supposed to end up with after 1 1/2 hours of simmering. What made it more time consuming, I roasted a chicken to get the bones. Where do you get poultry bones? I can't imagine a butcher saving them?? All in all, very good flavored sauce and the quail marinade did penetrate and flavor the quail. I served this with Minnesota Wild Rice (Cooking Light) & Warm Camembert Salad with apples and Walnuts from Cottage Living for a wonderful weekend dinner.

I started this the day before and used extra beef stock instead of using poultry bones. It was the first course I made for a seven course dinner and it was great. I think wild rice or quinoa would be a good accompaniment.

Way too much time, effort and cost for a very disappointing bland taste.

This dish takes some time to prepare And, since it's quail, it takes some time to eat! I brought it to a party w/ lots of friends (many French) and it was only a huge hit. I will definately make this again, but only for someone special. This great recipe should not be wasted on morons.

Fantastic recipe. I didn't have anywhere near the time so I did a shortcut. To make the sauce I reduced vegetable stock plus port and dried figs. When the quail was done I deglazed the pan with port, added the reduction and fig puree and finished with butter. Fantastic!

This receipe was awesome. I also served with a wild and brown rice pilaf with reconstituted dried apricots and cherries and pecans and it was delish. Had a wonderful Syrah to finish it off. By the way, the BEST place to buy quail is at an ethnic market. I went to our local Asian market and got 6 large quail for $8.99. Sure had to split them and remove the bones, but after a while, even that's not too difficult. It only takes practice. Good eating to all!

This recipe is awesome. Please make the sauce, or if you don't, buy storemade or demi-glace gold sold in specialty food shops. And no thickening agents either from a package. This is so good with wild rice, nut and dried fruit type dishes and green beans like the last person did.

Excellent recipe specially the marinade is just superb, though i used a lot of costly port it was worth it. However for the sauce i cheated as this was really too tedious a process to make. I just took beef stock, port wine and mixed it with the readymade gravey mix powder and cooked till the sauce has the perfect consistancy and taste. A very exotic dish to impress your guests.
