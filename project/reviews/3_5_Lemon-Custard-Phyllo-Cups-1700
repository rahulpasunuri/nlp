This recipe was a hit with my friends on the 4th. I do however hate to work with Phyllo dough so instead I made cups with reduced calorie tortilla shells and topped with fresh raspberries. Everyone loved it! The recipe is quick, simple, and delicious!

I really enjoyed these. The custard can be made w/ oranges instead of lemons. In addition, I think I prefer these w/ berries instead of mint and powdered sugar. (I found blueberries to work the best.)

I loved these things! My custard came out perfect and my husband loved these, although, I know he's crazy about lemon bars so I probably won't make these often. I left a point off because phyllo dough is extremely difficult to work with, however it was a fun experience making these.

I give this recipe zero forks! I thought I was making a creamy pudding-like filling - because of the word custard. It turns out to be a too-sweet thick glaze. Why would anyone want to eat that? I through it all in the trash.

This was quick, easy and makes a wonderfully light summer dessert. I doubled the custard and made 2 extra phyllo cups but I could have used even more custard ~ it was SO good, and so low-fat (for a dessert). If you don't have fresh mint, try garnishing with a twist of lemon rind.
