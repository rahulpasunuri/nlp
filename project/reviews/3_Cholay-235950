Recipe is alright for those not used to spicy food but not for those who have tasted chholay prepared on the Indian sub-continent. It's too bland. When soaking chholay overnight, add a pinch of baking soda and DO NOT REFRIGERATE. The chholay will cook faster and will not be hard.

Wonderful, flavorful simple to make dish. Great dish to be a staple of a healthy diet. I added some water and let everything simmer a little more at the end. Just soften the onion all the way. Quite delicious.

For people complaining that their chickpeas didn't get soft, the problem could well be with your chickpeas, or rather the store where you bought them. As dried peas and beans sit around, they get harder and harder, to the point where virtually no amount of soaking and cooking with get them soft -- and I speak from experience. Morale: Buy your pulses from a shop with good turnover. The supermarket, for instance, is not a good option, since a lot more people are buying Pop-Tarts than are buying dried legumes.

worst recipe ever from epicurious. I tried like hell to get those beans to get tender. 4 hours and still not soft enough. And the flavor was not nearly strong enough for a full pound of beans. It was dry and unpleasant. I love chickpea dishes at Indian restaurants, so it's not the idea of cholay-it's the recipe itself. Don't even bother.

I agree with the others the recipe is missing some spices. Add garam masala to the recipe or go to my favorite store www.indianfoodsco.com and buy their channa masala and you will have a great bean dish.

This is a wonderful recipe. Full of flavor and very healthy. All of the cilantro gives a spectacular freshness.

this recipe is not even close to what is required in choley. I am so disappointed with seeing this recipe. there is no reason to dumb down a recipe because it may seem too heavily spiced or difficult. i am actually quite offended that this recipe is even being labeled choley.

I followed the recipe, with the exception of using canned tomatoes instead of fresh. I think I'm giving up on dried chick-peas, at least the ones I can get at the minute. Despite soaking overnight, rinsing, and boiling for longer than called for, they always come out firm and dry. Otherwise the dish was good. Not special, but as the Tip says, the chili powder used will make a difference.

This is another recipe that could be a lot better...this just doesn't come close to the real "choley"

Very similar to the classic Indian chickpea curry, chana (or chole) masala. I think I like this version better though - milder, not so heavily spiced.

I was having guests and I never made this dish since I myself don't like chickpeas. I made it out of desperation, but loved how simple it turned out and it tasted soo good. My guests loved it and even I ate it.

I made the dish on short notice, so I used canned chickpeas instead of soaking and using fresh. The flavours were fantastic. Just the right amount of spice and heat. So simple to make.
