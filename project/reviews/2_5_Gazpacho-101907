I cannot believe how many people have rated this recipe without even trying it. This is a very easy and good recipe. No, it's not classic with tomatoes, but a lot of gazpacho recipes use tomato juice as a base. I had never seen jicama in gazpacho before, but it really is good. It's crunchy and refreshing. Like almost all recipes on here, you just need to tweak it a little bit. Add tabasco or peppers if you like it hot. Add more lime juice if you want. Add onions if you like onions. This happens to be a good, basic recipe. I have made it in double batches for three summers now. I always add fresh lime juice and avocado when I serve it.

I haven't made this recipe so maybe I shouldn't even be reviewing it all. That said I find it down right offensive that anyone would suggest making Gazpacho with V8. Next Gourmet will be telling us to make Belgian Waffles with Egg Beaters.

This is a lame recipe. No onion, no cilantro, no lime juice, no hot sauce. And who the hell makes gazpacho with V-8? This may be ok to serve some VERY provincial soul from somewhere like Omaha who fans their mouth at even "mild" salsa, but to real gazpacho lovers, it is a joke. Sorry.

I agree that it is easier to halve the ingredients, and only roughly chop them and puree them, rather than worry about dicing them. The Gazpacho recipes I've seen call for tomato juice. You need a base for the soup. One of the best is from the Moosewood Cookbook, with tomato juice, cuke, onion, green pepper, scallion, lemon and lime juice, vinegar, and chopped parsley, garlic and seasoning. Fantastic. Their recipe for Cascadilla soup also calls for tomato juice wisked with yogurt or sour cream, with veggies added. Yummy.

Give me a break! Next you will be telling me to use Campbell tomato soupe in my recipes. I thaught this was supposed to be gormet.

While this was not my favorite gazpacho recipe, I do always keep V8 on hand all summer because I find it is the best tomato juice ingredient to use when making gazpacho!

When your company reacts to your cooking, would you rather have them say "Wow...this is really...authentic", or "Wow...this tastes great, may I have another serving?"

This was very good. I admit that I felt guilty using V8 (like others, I'm not sure how authentic this recipe is), but my guests really enjoyed it. I think it's a good dinner party starter, because it gives you the opportunity to serve something tasty and beautiful, but spend more time preparing the other courses.

This is a delicious and extremely healthful dish. I love it with black beans quesadillas for dinner or by itself for a light lunch or snack.

Gee, I never knew "V8" was a Spanish ingredient! Check out the other Gazpacho recipe listed right below this one. It's MUCH more authentic! This one might be good with vodka served in a tall glass (rename it a bloody mary though).

I liked it, very tasty. I do have to admit that due to limited selection at the grocery store and time constraints I didn't follow the recipe exactly.... I left out the celery, substituted radishes for jicama and garnished with cilantro instead of chives. I also added a little cayenne pepper sauce. I did have to re-dice the cucumber because following the instructions my chunks were a little too big. Also in response to the comment above about halving the veggies.... I think part of the idea is to leave half the liquids un-pureed as well which is why you combine and then halve.

We love to eat raw foods and this recipe is a fantastic combination of fresh garden vegetables at the height of the season.

This recipe had good flavor but I have had better gazpacho recipes. The recipe was a little odd in that you only puree half after everything is mixed together. It would be easier to halve the vegies and put half (or more) along with all the liquids in the processor then puree.
