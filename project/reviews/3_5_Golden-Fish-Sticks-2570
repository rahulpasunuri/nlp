Actually, it was pretty bad. I'm a seasoned cook, and no one liked this. The fish was flavorless,despite the citrus, and the cornflakes burned in the oven while the fish wasn't even done.

I doubled this and served it at a family dinner. Even my 9 year old grandson loved these fish sticks which was high accolades! Next time I might try the recipe with panko. Loved the tartar sauce too. Very easy.

This was a last-minute meal. I had cod, recently thawed, and no plan. These fish sticks were the yummiest, lickity-splittest solution I could have found. I give the recipe 4 stars not because it's the most amazing, original thing, but because it did its job (quick fish stick) in the best way. I don't eat corn flakes so I used a mixture of whole wheat bread crumbs and crushed multi-grain saltines. (I might try cornmeal in place of the saltines next time.) At 2 cups, I had way too many crumbs for 3/4" of fish, but I think the cereal is being measured before the crushing, so I would adjust the amount to 1.5 cups of crushed stuff. The fish required a few extra minutes cooking time. I used store-bought tartar sauce. I could have eaten it with just a lemon wedge, it was so delicate and lovely. Don't serve it with starch, I say. Serve with some steamed veg and a distinctive salad.

Kids loved it and my husband was happily snacking away. Used Talapia with great success. A good weeknight dinner -- fast and yummy.

I've started my children cooking dinner one night a week. My 13 year old son who loves frozen fish sticks wanted to make fish sticks for dinner. I told him, his dad and I didn't eat frozen fish sticks. After finding this recipe, we had to tweak it a bit because we didn't have corn flakes. We had Honey Bunches of Oats. Though it was a bit sweet, it was all eaten up. Tonight we're going to try 1/2 cornflakes and 1/2 Honey Bunches of Oats.

yeah these were great. used petrale sole (as this was all they had frsh, not farmed). made the mistake of using miracle whip (on hand) which made it pretty sweet, but as a dip it wasn't that noticeable. will make again. made for me and my wife, served with grn bnz and fries.

Used tilapia, very tasty. My toddler and husband (who usually doesn't like fish) both liked it.

Delicious and versatile: Tilapia works great too. Great for finicky kids.

This was a great recipe for a family! I used talapia and cod and both were delicious, though we liked the talapia better. My husband and I loved it with the tartar sauce and our 3 year old dipped his in ketchup. We served the fish sticks with roasted red potatoes and fresh green beans. It was so great, I will make this again for sure!

French fries and chocolate cupcakes made the perfect meal! We don't eat like this every night, so it was a real treat that we all (including my 2, 4, 6 and 40 year old boys) enjoyed! We made it with the fish we caught at the coast yesterday!

A great way to get my hubby and 17-month old baby to eat fish!!

Very good. I didn't have corn flakes so I ground up some crackers. Almost out of butter so I added oil to make up the difference. Used chopped up sweet gherkins as I didn't have relish. Added more lemon juice to the sauce and skipped the zest in the crumbs because my last lemon had already been de-zested. I made oven roasted potatoes, sliced thin which I started about ten minutes before the fish. Be careful they don't burn in the high temps. Delicious.

Really excellent recipe. My discerning "cook of the family" husband loved it and my 14 year old daughter had it for dinner and breakfast before school this morning! I used flounder cause nothing else was available and it worked perfectly. Doubled the cornflakes to 5 cups and it wasn't enough, so had to stop mid-dipping and process some more. (Probably needed 6-7 cups.) Also, rushing (as usual) I made a mistake and added both lemon zest and juice to the butter but it was still great. Ten minutes was the exact right amount of time to cook them to perfection. (PS I agree with the reviewer who said french fries and cupcakes might be a bit much for the arteries along with this meal. While these are not greasy they are luciously buttery so I wouldn't want other high-fat stuff served with them. Had roasted green beans (also cooked at 500% for 15 minutes) which worked great.)

Very good. I made this with talapia and used Soy and Oat flakes (that's what I had on hand). The butter gave a rich flavor that I've not had with fish sticks before. My husband and 2 1/2 year gobbled them up. My husband enjoyed his with cocktail sauce, however.

easy, light, and delicious. perfect for a quick tasty dinner and a movie. i served it with tater tots (sorry but were store bought). i used talapia and that was fine but clearly the possibilites are endless. i wonder what panko crumbs would yield? ill let you know.

Good and crunchy. Double the amount of butter, though, so you don't run out

Great light taste! I will definitely make this again.

Well, in the end this was very good, but I had a lot of trouble with it--I used turbot, which turned out not to be firm enough. Also, the butter/lemon mixture solidified on the cold fish, making the cornflake crumbs difficult to adhere. The tartar sauce DEFINITELY needed extra lemon juice--I added another lemon-wedge worth of juice. In the end, it tasted great--flavorful, moist, and crispy on the outside! I'll definitely try it again with firmer fish.

Very good and easy. Tartar sauce is excellent but I did add more lemon juice. Need to be careful to cook longer for thicker pieces of fish.

These tasted just like fish sticks from the box! I would definitely make this for children. I used orange roughy like it recommends and thought it's texture was good for the recipe.

The entire family loved it! I've made it twice - once with flounder, and once with whiting. The whiting, being a slightly firmer fish, worked out wonderfully. The tartar sauce was especially effective with it. I've served it with oven-roasted potatoes, and it's made a excellent low-fat meal.

I used tilapia fish to make this dish, a mild white fish. It was very good - and at least I knew what was in the fish sticks....a favorite of the kids.

A nice alternative to the frozen stuff. Really tasty! And of course, the fresher the fish, the better the dish.
