Good weeknight dinner that was quick to put together and easy to make. I added about 2 tbsp. of honey to the BBQ sauce and used chicken breasts instead of thighs.

I was searching for a barbeque sauce made from ingredients I had on hand. Didn't cook the chicken in the sauce - instead used it for dipping the roasted chicken into. Based on other reviewers' substitutions I used leftover canned marinara sauce rather than open a can of tomatoes. Gave it four stars because it was incredibly easy to prepare - put everything in a saucepan and let it simmmer for about 30 minutes - and my husband and daughter loved it.

Pretty standard base sauce. I changed it to adapt to my own tastes and to clean out the kitchen a bit. In place of the crushed tomatoes, I used regular Campbell's tomato soup. I also used leftover Jack Daniels honey mustard in place of the French's, an Italian seasoning blend in place of the thyme out of desperation, and added about 1 tsp of raw honey and about 1 1/2 tsp of hoisin sauce. I also cooked the sauce over the stove for quite awhile to condense the flavors more. Turned out quite excellent - so if you're looking for a home for that bit of leftover hoisin or raw honey, I say go for it!

Go ahead. Right this minute. You must make this. The end result is the unmistable American barbecue flavors everyone loves.Extremely appealing. ;)

Stop. Stop right now. Don't even think about making this recipe. The end result is chicken smothered in the unmistakable ballpark flavors of ketchup and mustard. It's not appealing.

Wonderful and easy! I made this for my friends and they loved it! I will definitely make this dish again.

I halved the recipe and used boneless chicken breasts. I think even with half the amount of chicken I should have made the same amount of sauce. But still good... I think I'm just not a barbecue fan. My boyfriend loved it.

Great easy and tasty dish. Used 8oz can of tomato paste as I don't like crushed tomatoes. Doubled everything else and used a whole cut up chicken. That way there is something for everyone. Added a dash of red pepper flakes and used dried minced onion. I left the skin on and basted often and put on the second rung in oven for a nice glaze.

Easy to prepare, family friendly, tender and tasty!

My "4 forks" here takes into account the ease and comfort-foody tone of the recipe - for an easy, weeknight meal, this can't be topped. I usually make extra sauce and freeze it in individual bags for an even quicker preparation on a busy weeknight.

This recipe is so easy! I haven't cooked chicken in over a decade (I'm a vegetarian but decided to make some chicken for my husband and son) and even I couldn't mess this up. I accidentally bought a 28-ounce can of crushed tomatoes so I made double the sauce and served the extra which was a hit. I didn't cook the sauce first; just whisked it all together and poured over the chicken. I was a little worried because my husband hates mustard but I guess you don't taste it in the sauce. I made half the recipe today and froze the other half for another dinner. Will definitely make this again!

Delicious and easy. This is family-style fare; it won't impress the sophisticated palate of foodies. I used Muir Glen's Organic Crushed Tomatoes with Basil - excellent.

I thought this was a pretty good recipe - I baked for only 1 hr 20 min. and the chicken turned out nice and tender.

I made a spicy version that my husband really loved. Added the onion slush from one small grated onion, and also a few cloves of crushed garlic. Used Dijon mustard and a splash of saki. DID NOT cook the sauce, just mixed ingredients and poured over.

This dish was so easy and actually tasted pretty good. I would make it again when in a pinch for time. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and it worked great. Very good with rice.

I made this and froze half, it was just as good thawed. I served it over rice and enjoyed the luscious sauce. I also added a diced, sauteed onion to the mix. Yummy and a kid-pleaser.

Very good blend of sweet and spice. Chicken was tender. I'll toss in a few country ribs next time.

This is a great simple barbecue sauce. My husband loved the chicken recipe so much he wanted me to make the sauce and make bbq beef sandwiches. This sauce is a keeper.

I love this recipe. I have made it at least a dozen times and will continue to make it.

Very tasty, my whole family enjoyed it. I did leave the skin on, and added a dash of Frank's hot sauce. I used half yellow mustard, half dijon. Last time,when I did all dijon, the mustard flavor was too overpowering.Nice combination of sweet, salty and sour. Served on top of plain rice.

This was similar to the sauce I make without a recipe. I'm glad to have it, so I don't have to invent it each time. I did add garlic, onion, molasses, a bit more brown sugar, and some dried cranberries. I used to cover it during most of the baking time. I was glad to learn that uncovered, the sauce reduced great and had a nice glaze and the chicken was still tender.

I enjoyed this recipe, but I chose to leave the skin on because my family likes the skin. I also took the suggestion someone made and I added apple slices. I think they added some extra flavor, I'm not sure, but I had delicious crispy apple slices when I finished. Great recipe.

The whole family enjoyed this recipe. I have'nt had frenchs mustard for ages,I forgotten how tasty it was. It goes well with the BBQ sauce.

Really good, although mine didn't go brown and glazed as the recipe says ( no idea why ). I'd perhaps take in one of the suggestions below and add some heat or cut up apple next time. Definitely worth 3 forks.

Very easy to make but didn't set our world on fire. Needs some more spice or red pepper flakes or dash of RedHot or something - we did use Dijon instead of the yellow salad mustard, which was highly recommended for this recipe, so perhaps that was part of the problem.

decent fare for a weeknight. I thought it was tasty but next time will use a little less mustard & will probably leave on the skin.

I modified this recipe almost beyond recognition, but was very happy with the results. I don't like things cooked with tomatoes, so I left them out, and added a bit of chicken stock to make sure there was enough liquid. I didn't have any French's mustard so I used Dijon. I didn't have cider vinegar so used white wine vinegar. I added some dried basil, and baked the dish covered instead of open (because I was worried about it drying out) I also popped in a cut up onion and a few dried apricots. The result was great - piquant sauce, tender chicken. If I do it again I may add some cut up apple too.

I thought this recipe was pretty good but nothing special. Apparently some previous posts are complaining the recipe/recipes aren't all GREAT. You're missing the point. This site clearly offers a variety of recipes for a variety of tastes, and to complain that ALL the recipes don't appeal to you isn't "cooking" as I know it. I've liked recipes here that haven't had the greatest rating but it's just my taste. Trashing the whole site is amateurish. If you don't like a recipe, make it better and post what you did.

Very tasty and easy to make. My guests were very pleased and wanted this recipe.

I happen to have really liked this recipe. I don't know why one would get so angry because others feel differently about a recipe or dish than they do. Doesn't make a lot of sense and wastes time, to boot. If you don't like a recipe, express that--and move on. This is a nicely flavored dish, and if anyone chooses to add to it or subtract from it, that's great. Those comments are helpful and show a spirit of adventure and creativity. Add! Subtract! Go wild!

I am finding way too many of your recipes with a mediocre rating from other cooks. Why are they in your magazine and on your website if they are anything other than wonderful? I can whip up mediocre food any day of the week without following someone else's recipes.

Maybe I did something wrong. Was O.K. but expected better. Certainly didnt have a glaze on top.

I have prepared this dish twice--the second time with some revisions. Firstly, leave the skin on and splurge! Secondly, why on earth does the recipe call for so much juice? Half of the tomatoes sufficed adequately. I LOVE the fact that no ketchup was part of the sauce recipe, however. Use a bit less vinegar and "cut the mustard" with 1 teaspoon of white wine and the chicken is a winner

I didn't care much for this at all. There seemed to be too much sauce and the chicken boiled rather than baked. The sauce was just so-so.
