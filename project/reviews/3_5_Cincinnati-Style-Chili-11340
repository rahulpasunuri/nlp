I agree with ccsinclair but it's pretty darned close. I don't use some of the spices listed; coriander, clove and oregano or the cocoa and everyone here at home says mine is better than all the chili places around. Maybe so but I think Camp Washignton has mine beat. But I digress, I don't add the cocoa and definitely NOT molasses but if you want use unsweetend chocolate. And to make it vegetarian like one of the famous chili parlors use black beans instead of the beef. It's actaully really good this way.

Well, this was good - but I could not make myself like it as much as I wanted to. It felt like at first that I had acciidentally kicked over my whole spice drawer into this dish (and I LOVE spices of all kinds!). So, I was surprised I did not like it more, tasted kinda muddied I guess (next time I will hold off on some of the paprika and chili powder at first and add to taste later). I halved the recipe and tried half with molasses as sweetener and half with the cocoa, brown sugar, and tomato paste combo a previous reviewer suggested. Everyone liked the cocoa/brown sugar combo better. Also, subbed 1/2 beans for the meat, we don't eat that much meat for everyday meals for conservation/environmental reasons. It was great (to me!) with the beans. We also tried it with all the toppings. The spaghetti was good for a change, but no match (in my opinion) for fresh-made tortillas browned in butter!

This was a great recipe. The whole family chowed it down. I can't say if it is actually cincy style, but it tasted like a cross between the Texas and Cincinnati style chilis at hard times cafe. It was super easy and I plan to add it to my menu.

I'm no chili expert, and I'd never even heard of Cincinnati chili, but I thought the seasonings in this looked intriguing, so tried it. I loved it! Very tasty. One question: the recipe says nothing about adding salt--is this a mistake? I added some and was pleased with the results, but would this be sacrilege to a true Cincinnatian?

I really love this. I pour it over crushed saltines and top it with cheddar and or sour cream and or onions. It's so damned good!

I improved on this recipe by doubling the amount of oregano and cinnamon and adding a tablespoon of backing cocoa and a tablespoon of Splenda. Having eaten Skyline chili in tghe past, the additions were necessary to duplicate the taste.

If I could give this abomination 0 forks, I would. As a Cincinnati kid born and bred, THIS AIN'T IT! For the insane people making this with tofu, serving it with rice, and stirring beans in with the meat --PLEASE STOP. Or don't call the dish Cincinnati chili. To start with, the ground beef is gently simmered with the spices, never browned. It has cocoa in it, not molasses. And it is always served over thin spaghetti, with a full handful of finely shredded Cheddar cheese on top. If you MUST be creative, go desecrate New Orleans' red beans and rice.

I changed this a bunch, so I'm rating not the recipe itself, but the framework. I used 3 lbs 96/4 ground beef, so no fat to skim off, nutmeg for mace, brown sugar for molasses, no paprika, no chili powder but more cayenne pepper, 3 piquin peppers and one or two other dried peppers (I removed these at the end with the bay leaf). Also I added 2 cans of rinsed kidney beans and some leftover baked beans. Delicious balance of spicy & sweet!

Rating: 3
Excellent, with modifications. The cinnamon (plus spaghetti) make it "Greek" spaghetti, but more specifically other items (allspice, paprika, mace, cocoa, tomato paste, simmered meat, appropriate toppings, etc.) make it Cincinnati chili. This recipe is very close, but I agree with others that a few changes would bring it closer: cut chili powder by half or three quarters, or better yet add last to taste, sub an 8 oz can of tomato paste for the sauce, quadruple the cinnamon (and increase other sweet spices and cayenne, to taste), use brown sugar instead of molasses, add cocoa powder, let sit overnight, and skim fat. The large quantity of beef keeps it from being too runny. It serves 6 because everyone will want three plates. It's important to simmer the beef a long time instead of browning it; it falls apart into tiny bits so the chili is fairly homogenous in texture and taste. I've been a long time Ohio resident and avid fan of Cinci chili, for which there are many different recipes. I think the most agreed-upon taste is Skyline chili, the fast food chain (the frozen and canned stuff is good but too salty); the spice packets sold at Kroger's make a very satisfactory and quick substitute. Most feel it should top thin spaghetti and have shredded cheddar on top, with kidney beans and fresh chopped onion underneath, and optional. While very good with saltines or oyster crackers, it is amazingly good with spaghetti. I thought it was weird at first too, and ate it with cheese and crackers only, but when I finally tried it with spaghetti I was floored! Like others I became addicted. Please do try it with spaghetti rather than rice, I promise you'll love it!!

Fantastic!!!!! A real winner.

I have been making this dish for a few years and it is perfect, BUT I need to share a few secrets...First, please simmer a few hours. If you would like to add cocoa..go ahead! You must serve over spaghetti! I am afraid to share the next tip, but..no slams before you try! Heinz Chili Sauce on top! It is TOTALLY true! Spaghetti, chili, red beans, cheddar, and chili sauce...perfect! My Father has always added chili sauce to his Cinci-style chili and he is right...try it! We do not serve this to guests..way too messy, but REALLY great!

Rating: 4
I use my crock pot, putting it all in and letting it cook on low for a good 12 hours, or until the tomato sauce starts to turn the mixture brown. I find that if I let it cool and sit overnight, it's even better the next day. I also agree with one reviewer about its lack of spice...to remedy, serve chopped jalapenos on the side and let eaters doctor their own. Very good and always a winner.

Rating: 3
OK .. not to sound mean, but a couple things need to be said. 1st, serve the chili over spagetti. Not by itself, nor with another noodle. Spagetti is an INTREGAL part of the Cincinnati Chili lore. Second, its not suppose to be SPICY hot, like texas chili. Its just not. And finally, the reference to authentic usually refers to not browning the meat first, just letting the uncooked ground beef simmer for several hours. Sorry for the tone, but I had too much Cinn Chili (and Coneys) to pass on so many "bland" remarks.

After making this, I thought this would be a good gift. So I've assembled all the dry spices into a mix and wrapped up. I then added a recipe card explaining how to make it with the remaining ingredients. My mom tested this using the mix, and then added spaghetti and cheddar cheese and loved it. (She only did two- and not five-way chili.) It turned out great. My stepdad loved it. I am giving out to about eight or nine friends for the holidays.

So sorry, forgot to mention: As delicious as this chili is right off the cooktop, it is far, far better the next day after the flavours have developed and mellowed. If you have time, suggest you make it the day before serving for even more outstanding flavour. Enjoy!

Finally, a chili to rave about! It has never been one of my favourite dishes, likely because I have been making a standard, ho-hum recipe for years and am not a big fan of chili powder. This chili is anything but ho-hum! Such a surprising blend of spices - the flavour is amazing as is the aroma while cooking. I did make some small/minor changes: used 3 lbs. extra lean ground beef and had no fat at all to skim off; olive oil instead of vegetable; reduced the chili powder to 2 tbsp; subbed beef broth for the water; added 2 cans of drained/rinsed red kidney beans and 1 tbsp. cocoa powder near the end of cooking; served over elbow macaroni instead of spaghetti; liberally sprinkled with extra-sharp cheddar and minced onion. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written and maintained the ingredient list/amounts. If you are not a chili lover, this one is likely to convert you with the first forkful! Thanks so much, Cincinnati!

Don't get me wrong. I love a good sized portion. But this recipe calls for 4 lbs of ground beef. It serves 6. That's about 3/4 lb of beef per person. Oh, and don't forget that all this beef is served over spaghetti with cheese and oyster crackers. It begs the question, if this is authentic, why aren't all the people in Cincinnati obese?

I made this with two changes. I used (as suggested by many others), one lb. ground pork, and the remaining 3lb. beef. I also used the cooking method suggested as "more authentic" by a few reviewers, and put everything into the pot together. The result is really quite bland, with a hint of heat. I think the spice proportions are way too low for this amount of meat, and I will continue to look for a good basic chili recipe to satisfy my cravings for chili with macaroni noodles, cheese, onions and crackers!

I didn't have the mace, cloves, or bay leaf and it still turned out pretty good. If you cook like I do - eyeballing quantities - I would advise to go easy on the molasses, as it tends to dominate over the other flavors. Also added a bit more cinammon than recipe calls. My 6 year old daughter is a picky eater, and she gobbled this one up over a plate of spaghetti. Will make again. Overall good recipe.

I just made this recipe for a second time. I really think the spices make for a delicious flavor and aroma. Since I've never had Cincinnati-style chili, I can't weigh in on that debate. To me, this is simply a tasty chili recipe that's out of the ordinary.

Shame on you for deceiving the world about the taste of chili in Cincinnati. I frequent Cincinnati's chili establishments, and was excited about the possibility of imitating the taste at home, but THIS IS NOT the recipe to do that. It tasted okay, but if I wanted "regular" chili, I'd just use my mother's recipe.

I live in Cincinnati and have tried many recipes hoping to find something that tastes like Cincinnati's Skyline Chili. Although we have a few different restaurants that only serve chili, Skyline is my favorite. This recipe actually comes closer than any of the other recipes I've made so far. The four of us agree that this is the best out of the dozen or so recipes we've made. I don't know why the other reviewers seem to feel the need to change things, other than removing grease it doesn't need it. This is not like Gold Star Chili or the others, closer to Skyline IMO.

Well, I hate to be the "fly in the ointment" but this chili was a major disappointment. I'm not one to substitute the first time I use a recipe, so unlike many others I followed the directions word for word. I even made the chili on Saturday so it could sit overnight, and be reheated on Superbowl Sunday, but it just lacked "snap". I found it rather bland, yet one of my guests found it too spicy. (SIGH) Certainly a disappointment, in my humble opinion.

I did the same with the beef, except I used 3 pounds ground sirloin and 1 pound ground pork. I also used 1/2 of the amount of water and used beer for the other half. It was a huge Superbowl party hit.

Delicious! I made this on Saturday, using three pounds of ground beef and one pound of ground pork. Plus I substituted homemade beef stock for the water, and ground a lot of the spices by hand. Then on Super Bowl Sunday, I skimmed most of the congealed fat off the surface and reheated it. It was a hit (and I served it four-way...minus the kidney beans on top).

Rating: 3
This is an unusual and very tasty chili recipe. I used stew meat (4 lbs bottom round, which I browned before adding onions) in lieu of the ground meat (ode to mad cow, I guess, and more flavorful), added beans (kidney, one can) as some suggested, and used chicken stock instead of water. The key of the recipe is in the spices, though, and that seems to have made the difference -- sweet and savory. The flavors really mellow w/ cooking. Couldn't do the spaghetti (weird) so used rice which went well. Will certainly make again (next superbowl).

A delicious and eclectic twist on my standard, run of the mill chili dish. I played around with the recipe and made several additions, but I think the recipe is great as is. In any case, I added four slices of applewood smoked bacon, chopped, and sauteed the onions and garlic in the bacon grease. I also added one dried ancho chile, softened in hot water and chopped into pieces. Finally, the biggest change is that I used beef stew cubes instead of ground beef. A wonderful, warm, hearty dish!

I had an urge to stock the freezer with chili on the first snowy day of the year. I picked this recipe and I'm glad I did - it's delicious. I had a pound of Laura's Lean beef on hand and I supplemented it with plain old 80% lean ground chuck. For the chili powder I used about 3-4 tablespoons freshly-ground New Mexico chilies (from about 6 dried chilies), because a) it was fresh so I thought it would be more potent, b) I was allowing for some filler (onion and garlic powders, etc.) in canned chili powder and c) based on the recommendation from the cook in San Diego to reduce the chili powder. I used 1/2 the oregano and I didn't have mace so I threw in a sprinkle of nutmeg instead. I also threw in a tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa and a couple teaspoons of salt, and substituted 2 cups of beef broth I had left over for some of the water. The recipe worked beautifully. It was a bit of a pain to refrigerate and then skim the fat off the top, but that's probably because I reduced it too far and the fat was sitting on and around the beef instead of being cushioned by a layer of sauce. At the right consistency, the recipe really makes 10-12 cups. The upside of the 4-5 hours I let this cook is that the flavors blended beautifully, but next time I will add more water to make it soupier. I served this for my friends over spaghetti topped with onions and Cheddar. They loved it.

This recipe was as I remembered Cincinnati Chili to be! I am excited to have discovered it! I was worried that I didn't have "sweet paprika" but I am told by a native Hungarian that unless it is written on the bottle as "hot", the paprika is sweet. Delish! And ... a wonderful hot dip recipe: spread two 8 oz. cream cheese bars in a 9 x 13. Put chili on top. Top with shredded cheddar and mozzarella cheeses. Bake 20 mins at 350. Serve with fat Fritos or tortilla chips.

This was easy and great! I simplified a bit by omitting the coriander, mace and bay leaf (but don't skip the allspice), and used maple syrup for the molasses. We added beans to the mix near the end as well. My neighbor, who grew up in Cincinnati, loved it.

I'm always nervous making chili for my boyfriend, who lived in Texas for many years and is a bit of a chili snob. Much to my surprise, he loved this chili and couldn't stop saying so. I thought it was pretty wonderful, as well. I made a couple changes just because I lacked a couple things; only had 2-1/2 lbs of beef, so I threw in a couple cans of pinto beans (I like beans in my chili anyway). I usually cut the meat up into cubes for chili instead of using ground meat; for this I chopped it up in the food processor and really liked the texture that gave. Also was out of coriander. I will definitely make this again, with the larger amount of meat - my only regret with this chili is that there were no leftovers! Oh, I made it on a Monday night and refrigerated it overnight, then we had it for dinner on Tuesday. Yum yum!

This was pretty darn good. A great thing to have in the fridge for the kids; a comfort food that was also easily personalized. If you can, add a little hot sauce, some worcestershire sauce, and brown sugar to the stew. I also used 2 lbs ground beef with 2 lbs ground turkey sausage, and substituted broth for the water (bouillon cubes in water and zapped in the microwave make broth quick, easy and affordable). And I always add curry to things; it's just one of my favorite spices and delicious in this stew. Try it. Also, a secret I've learned about chili is to add (at the end) CHOCOLATE. Yes! Just a few Hershey's kisses will do the trick. Will definitely be making this again through the winter months. And remember, fellow epicureans, it's very important that you save your recipes and return to this site to post your reviews afterwards. This website is a wonderful source for trying new recipes, but we need to keep those reviews rolling in to help us pick the best! And with the holidays coming up, you MUST try one of the best turkey recipes you'll ever have in your life (promise). See this site for the "Barbecued Turkey w/Maple Mustard Glaze" recipe.

My girlfriend is from the 'nati and has turned me on to her version of chili through Gold Star and Camp Washington. We make this once a month and enjoy the leftovers throughout the week. I've found that it tastes better the next day so make it in advance. I sometimes make it without one or two of the minor ingredients and it still comes out ok. Update on 10.04.02: I've made this about 15 times now. I usually use Laura's lean but my best batch came when I used the grocery meat which had more fat (go figure). Mmmmm, animal fat.

I am from Cincinnati and this is close to the chili there. However, lose the oregano, reduce the chili powder some (It shouldn't taste like Tex-Mex chili), and the suggestion of adding a bit of unsweetened cocoa is a good one. Consider adding a small bit of crumbled bay leaf. I believe the suggestion of throwing it all in a pot, cooking, refrigerating, then removing the grease is the most authentic method, but I usually can't wait that long! Definitely serve with accompaniments for the true Cincinnati experience!

My boyfriend grew up in Cincinnati, so I made the chili as a surprise to remind him of home. (he has raved about cincinnati chili before) The smell was wonderful as the chili simmered, and my kitchen held the spicy smell for two days. I didn't have as much beef as the recipe called for, so I cut down the amount of water I added but kept the tomato amount the same. I served it over spaghetti with sharp cheddar cheese on top. It was a hit. My boyfriend's suggestions were to add a little bit of chocolate and next time to add beans for a more authentic cincinnati experience. However, I was very pleased with the results and am looking forward to making it again with some adjustments.

This is a variation on a recipe I received years ago from a Cincinnati resident. Her recipe directs you to cook all the ingredients together for two hours -- without first browning the ground beef. Then cool it overnight and spoon off the congealed fat! So easy. Plus the texture of the meat becomes very fine when cooked in the liquid this way, and the flavors blend deliciously! I love it on spaghetti topped with the cheese. My husband thinks it makes the ultimate chili dog.

Every now and then, during my quest for an authentic Cincinnati chili recipe, I cave in and try another recipe. This simply is not it. To taste it, you're going to have to travel.

After my husband came home from a business trip to Cincinnati and raved about some chili-topped spaghetti he had for dinner, I thought it was the strangest thing I had ever heard. Decided to give this recipe a try and, I agree, it IS good! The only procedural change I would make is to brown the meat separately before adding to the onions & garlic. This way the fat can be drained off before adding the spices.
