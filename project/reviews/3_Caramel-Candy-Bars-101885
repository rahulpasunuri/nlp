This recipe is delicious! I'm a kid but my mom teaches me how to cook, bake, and make. I think your recipe is very good, but I would like it better with milk chocolate, instead of dark.

I made this recipe, but had to translate it all first. It didn't turn out as good as I had hoped it would, it was way too thin for starters. The recipe is missing one word, on the first line of the carmel directions. It says "cook over high heat until medium carmel." I think it is suposed to say carmel COLOR. Here is the translation: 5 T. butter 2 T. powdered suger Vanilla bean 1/8 t. salt 2 T. almond powder egg 1/2 C. flour CARAMEL 6 T. sugar 1 1/2 T. corn syrup 6 T. cream vanilla bean walnuts chocolate

Pardon my scalelessness, but I need a translation of the ingredient quantities! If anyone out there can give the measurements in cups or ml's I would appreciate it!
