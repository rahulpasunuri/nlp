Simply delicious dish. But the other reviewers are right--1 hour 15 minutes is way too long to cook this dish. 45-50 minutes is perfect!

The beets overwhelmed this dish for me. I have since decided that I am not much of a fan of beets.

ALERT! 75 minutes is entirely too long! I roasted mine in a convection oven at 425 degrees -- and 20 minutes is absolutely sufficient! Anything more and the squash will be mush! Having said that, this is a wonderfully simple and delicious recipe. I prepared it for a dinner party over the weekend and everyone served themselves twice! I recommend that you eliminate the potatoes and increase the beets -- in fact, next time I think I'll try to find some orange beets to add to the melange!

Delicious! no herbs needed, the flavor of the beets alone is jazzy.

Very tasty! Made with roasted chicken - great addition to it! I just roasted these in the rack under my roasting pan at the same time...

great simple and tasty recipe

The nice thing about this recipe is that just about anything goes. I used sweet potatoes, turnip, red onion, beets, celery root and lots of thyme, rosemary, and sage (as suggested by another cook) I forgot to add the garlic and will use the next time. Still Delicious.

Love this recipe very simple and so yummy!I probably used more than 2 tablespoons of oil. I think it only took about 50 minutes.

Simple and surprisingly good! I just added a few herbs for seasoning, and I used some sweet potatoes. It also took less than the hour 15 minutes to cook for me--I think about 50 minutes was enough.

This is becoming a favorite holiday dish around our place. The friend who first served this to me increases the aesthetic appeal by peeling the beets and potoaoes. Also, we've found that this cooks much more quickly than the recipe specifies.

This is an excellent recipe. It both tastes and looks great. I added about a tablespoon of mixed herbs--rosemary, thyme and sage, and substituted more potato for the turnips--though it would have likely been just as good as written.

I've made this dish many times to rave reviews. It's very quick and easy to prepare and I find adding a generous amount of rosemary really adds to the flavors... a wonderful dish on those cool fall days..

What's all the hype about. Bought all the ingredients and served it to company to find it was just okay. Wouldn't make it again.

I used brussel sprouts, turnips, red potatoes, shallots and garlic since those are veggies we liked. Was fantastic as a side to a roast rosemary pork loin. Will make this again and again!

Four forks because it is both delicious and easy. Served it with the apricot/shallot stuffed pork roast from this web site. I used sweet potatoes, parsnips, carrots and onions. The only negative was, we didn't get around to the left overs for two days. By then the garlic had really flavored the veggies and was a little stong. Next time I will prepare what we can eat in one sitting.

Fabuolous recipe - aromatic and best with pork but we've served it with beef and roasted chicken.

A very tasty way to use up root veggies. I use any combination of root veggies, in any amount, and it always turns out great. Just don't forget to toss them every 15 mins. or so, or they'll stick to the pan.

Delicious and nutritious! For 2 people, we used 1/2 red onion, 3 small potatoes halved, 2 beets quartered, 1/2 acorn squash cut in 1" chunks, 5 cloves of garlic. Baked for 1/2 hour.

There are several excellent roasted root veggie recipes but none can be easier than this (or healthier). Made for thanksgiving this year and several folks requested the recipe. I'll definately do this again... loved the the flavors & the color combo of these veggies (which would be even better with minimal post roasting mixing - ie. if you add enough salt and pepper before baking - be very generous with the salt & pepper ). And no, you really don't need to peel the beets - just scrub well and trim.

My husband made this recipe for a dinner party and everyone raved (including me, who does not enjoy turnips and beets). He said that chef at the Four Seasons, where he previously worked, served an identical side dish in one of their restautants. We will definitely add this to our Thanksgiving repertoire.

I have not made this, however, I am confused! When are the beets peeled, can one eat beets not peeled?? Or do you leave the peel on the plate? Please answer, thank you , confused in the Big Apple.

Delicious but do not over roast.

Sounds simple, but it is very flavorful. This one is part of our regular rotation. We like it better when we cut down on the butternut squash and add more beets. One more thing - don't overcook! I would recommend cooking this 10-15 min less than the recipe requires.

I liked this recipe. I found it a bit bland. Others loved it. This amount feeds way more than 6 people and the cooking time is really less than 1 hour.

A vegetable dish that leaves even the most committed meat eater with a desire for more. I have made this dish a number of times and now have guests who request it when they are invited to dinner. The true test of a good recipe.

I thought this was fantastic, and so did my Thanksgiving guests!! Not only does it taste great, but it looks just beautiful -- especially due to the beets and the red onions -- and I think that was half the appeal. I am making this again for another group on Christmas day, based on the enthusiasm for it in October.

This was a great way to make roasted vegetables - simple and fast. The only thing that I was not sure about was the size of the vegetables. I made them about 1/2 inch thick and about 3 inches long when the vegetable was a large one. It was the favorite by all at my Easter party.

What a wonderful change from the usual. I cut and peeled the vegetables a day early and put them in individual baggies -- saves a lot of time. I cut the roasting time to 50 minutes. Be sure to stir regularly. People that don't like vegetables raved about these. I will prepare this recipe again and again.

The vegies tasted wonderful, but an hour and 15 minutes is way too long to cook them. I took them out after about 45 minutes, and they were quite done! I substituted yellow onion and parsnips for red onion and turnips and it was great.
