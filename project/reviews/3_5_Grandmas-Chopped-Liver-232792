Yu MUST use schmaltz! I use 4 eggs per lb of liver. And for a traditional texture, you should pass the eggs through a fine sieve. Easy to do if the eggs are at room temperature.Mazel!

I just made this using schmaltz (rendered chicken fat) and it is delicious. I would definitely do this again. Some people might want to be more cautious with the salt, but I like it with this amount.

I made this recipe for before Thanksgiving dinner for 14 people this year. Thanks to past reviews, I only used 3 hard boiled eggs. EVERYONE (except my hubby, who would not even try it) RAVED about this recipe. It was a HUGE hit. It is officially going to be my go-to recipe for get togethers.

My wife was convinced she hated liver. Then she tried this recipe. She now requests I make it before any party we host or attend. Yum!

I made this for a party last night and it was a huge hit! I used less oil and substituted with olive oil--just enough to cook onion and livers evenly. Thank you for a perfectly simple and traditional recipe.

6 eggs per lb.is a bit much. This recipe is not even close to my grandmother's. I use 3 eggs per lb of chicken livers and 1 bag of frozen chopped onions per lb and fry the onions & chicken livers in schmaltz. If you want the real thing, you have to use schmaltz and since I usually only make it twice a year, there is no guilt. I use my food processor on PULSE to chop the liver and then the onions and last, the eggs, which I do a little finer, not chunky. Then add your salt, too taste, and mix all together. I spray a small round jello mold with mazzola cooking spray and it comes out perfect every time. Depending on how many people you are feeding, I usually double the recipe. Enjoy.

i tried the recipe for hanukkah dinner. i used only 4 eggs, calf's liver, and less oil. it was easy to prepare and the taste was TERRIFIC. everyone raved!!!! can't wait to make again.

I think 6 eggs for 1 lb of chicken liver is too much. 3 onions and 3 eggs to a pound of liver is ideal, or at least my family thinks so.

Recently I have become, twice, a great-grand father. I have been making this recipe for 23 tears with slight changes. Usually I use 2 lbs. of chicken livers,4 large onions, 5 eggs and 1 1/4 cups of oil. However for the processing I use a mincing machine fitted with a medium-hole disc,not a mixer and pass the ingredients through twice. Salt and pepper to taste. The recipe has become my trade mark.

I make this as written but adda few tbsp's of sherry when livers are just about done. Cool, then add a few pats of butter while processing. Fantastic!

This recipe is great. My 93 yr. old grandma always makes chopped liver for the holidays- she made it for Rosh Hashanah but was too tired to make it again for Yom Kippur so I decided to surprise everyone - it was a big hit - grandma said i couldn't have made it better - also she said the recipe is almost the same exact one she uses.The only change I made was that I used 5 eggs instead of 6. What could be better than a big thumbs up from Bubbe.

I also have been making this for years. I do add more onions than sugested in your version. You wouldn't get me to eat chicken livers any other way.

To the cook from CT: I had a good laugh after reading your review.

This is the same recipe I have been using for years, but I substitute chicken fat (shmaltz) for the vegetable oil. It's not as healthy, I know, but I like the flavor much better.

this recipe was great and i used egg beaters instead of eggs...if I had used real eggs I probably would have given it 4 stars. The texture is perfect.

I wanted to make this but couldn't --grandma wouldn't let me use her liver.

I prepared this as an appetizer for a dinner party last night. It is by far the best chopped liver any of us ever had. The raves were endless!
