My sister likes "plain" food. She's not into spices unless they are "regular" spices - which means a little bit of fresh basil in "regular" tomato sauce. She LOVES these as per the recipe. We call them "pillows of love" instead of gnudi. For those of you asking questions about a flour substitute: one person suggested rice flour, which would be fine - but don't forget about chick pea flour. You can get it in Indian food stores where it is called "besan." It will add a bit of a taste. Personally, I think corn flour, or some of the other flour substitutes would be too strong a flavor.

Sorry I can't rate this as I haven't tried it yet. I am answering Lecknox: I also was wondering what to use and I thought perhaps Tapioca would be good. anybody can help us here? We eat gluten-free. Thanks

You need egg to keep the mixture together, so that the gnudi don't fall apart. Add nutmeg and pepper to the mixture. It's a Tuscan dish and we use Parmesan, not pecorino Romano cheese and flour instead of semolina.

This is a Tuscan recipe. We usually make gnudi with Parmesan cheese, not pecorino cheese. Then you should put a pinch of nutmeg and some pepper in the mixture. Finally, some egg to keep the mixture together, so that the gnudi don't fall apart. We don't use semolina but we roll them in flour. Sauce: butter and sage is ok but I love a good tomato sauce with chili and lots of basil and more Parmesan cheese on top :)

Just a question--Is it possible to use grated pecorino Romano cheese in place of parmesan when using cow's milk ricotta? I Haven't tried the recipe, but I know even here in NY it is easier to find regular ricotta cheese. At the same time, tangy appeals to me.

Khaned- it is pronounced nyoo-dee... like gnocci is pronounced nyo-kee. It is a special-occasion dish at our house along with blood-orange salad and cannoli. It is time consuming and often frustrating, but oh-so-worth-it once or twice a year! Like the author, I add a few dollops of Pesto around it when serving, but I do not leave out the butter sauce.

Is it possible to make this with a gluten free flour? Buckwheat perhaps? Rice flour?
