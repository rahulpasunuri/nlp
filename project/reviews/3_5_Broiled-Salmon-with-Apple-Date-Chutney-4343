1-7-13 Tasty! Plus it was fun to make chutney for the first time. Sweet and almost a little weird, but I dug it. Pretty, too. And you do end up wanting to eat the chutney straight. Leftovers are not a problem!

Delicious! I used dried figs instead of dates and water instead of apple juice.

Delicious, fast, and healthy. I cut the oil way back and didn't miss it. The chutney was great, and the curry (I used Penzey's Maharajah) on the salmon was lovely.

Different and good! Watch the amount of curry if you're not a huge fan, or if serving to kids.

Excellent! I did not add oil (low- fat diet) to the chutney, but used 4 tablespoons of chicken broth to cook the sweet onions (didn't have red). Used white wine (dry sherry) instead of apple juice and doubled the amount of dates (I had some wonderful Saudi Arabian dates). Added 1 teaspoon of Patak's mild curry paste (concentrate for sauces). It was delicious with the salmon. Roast pork or any mild meat would be great. My husband that does not care for curry, asked for seconds.

Very easy, very good. Make a little extra chutney - people were eating it straight!

Very good. I baked the salmon. The chutney was good but it had a little too muchoil in the recipe.

Easy on the eyes and tasty in the tummy (for adults and kids alike). One really should double the chutney (and this despite the fact I used a red apple)

Reeeaaally good. I didn't have apple juice so I used white wine with a generous squirt of honey. yum.

Try adding walnut pieces to the chutney at the end. I served on a bed of wild rice mix (unseasone). Excellent for a simple delicious meal. ...I agree that this goes well with curried broiled salmon.

Substituted raisins for dates, as dates sounded too sweet. Raisins worked well. Great receipe for weekday night!

Fantastic! Easy to prepare. Instead of broiling the salmon, I baked at 400 F for 20 min without turning. I highly recommend this recipe - one of the best salmon recipes I have ever tried.

Very easy, was surprised at how a few ingredients pull this dish together so well. My husband doesn't care for salmon, and I love it, and luckily even he liked this recipe so I can make it again without feeling like I'm just imposing my will :). Definitely a keeper.

I rubbed the seasoning into the salmon for more even coverage. I wish there was a picture - this is beautiful and yummy too. Never would've tried it if not for the rave reviews. Husband was eating extra chutney with a spoon! Cooked salmon 7 minutes and didn't turn it over - perfect.

I was a bit skeptical about the sauce at first, but once it finished I loved it and got compliments on it.. I added apple jelly to the sauce to sweeten it up a bit. Make extra chutney!! I doubled it for 3 people and I could have probably eaten more. I also took buddy's advice from NY and cooked the salmon according to the Pacific Salmon on this site. Will definitely make this one again!

Mmmmm.... totally delicious. I could have eaten twice the amount of chutney. This dish goes well with "Green Beans with Crushed Almonds" recipe. Quick prep... great for two.

Great recipe! I used a slightly different method of cooking the salmon- (see Pacific Salmon on this site) 450 degrees for 15 minutes. Works every time. LOVED the complex flavors of the chutney. Also, I used cider instead of apple juice. I bet the chutney would be fabulous on its own too.

I feel like I'm battin'a thousand!!! I loved this recipe!! So did everyone else. The chutney was perfect with the salmon,with nice clean sweet,tart and mellow flavors. I also served herbed corn couscous, that I found on this site. Wonderful!!!

Wow! What a a great mid-week meal! It comes together in a snap, and you can do the chutney while the fish broils, saving yourself even more time. I have made this with tuna steak and thought it was good, also. I didn't have apple juice so I used some white wine - it didn't hurt a thing!

Excellent taste! I blended the chutney into a sauce and served it over the salmon -- it was a great variation.

This recipe is very easy and very impressive. It's pretty healthy, too. Make extra chutney--it's good on its own as well.

Wonderful dish. I used just a little hot,spicy garlic olive oil to brush on fish and less oil to cook the chutney, going for a low fat dish. Also sub herbal wine vinagar (no apple juice on hand).
