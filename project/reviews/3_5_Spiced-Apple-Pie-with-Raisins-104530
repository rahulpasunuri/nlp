I read the reviews which was a big help because it only needed 350 at an hour and fifteen minutes in my oven. This pie came out amazing. next time I think i'll make it without the raisins. they didn't add much other than a chewy raisiny taste now and then which I think took away from the awesome spiciness of the pie itself. i made it the night before thanksgiving and it was awesome.

Many apple pie recipes start at 400 degrees to "seal" the crust from the juices but are always turned down after 15 minutes as I recall. Usually to 350. That may work better for this recipe, which does have two touches that usually work well. If your pie crust usually turns out tough the vinegar should help stop that from happening, and I love crystalized ginger in apple pie.

The ingredients in this recipe sound like they would go so well together. However I found that 1 1/2 hours in a 400 degree oven was too much heat for too long. I baked it for 1 hour and 15 minutes and the crust was burned. I would try this again but give it 45 minutes to an hour at 375 degrees. Then check it for doneness. Also I like to bake on a small cookie tray to prevent spills all over the oven floor.
