If any soup is deserving of quality home made stock and fresh thyme it is onion. this soup is boring at best.

This soup makes you feel like you're back in Paris. i made as directed but skipped the ham and used Gruyere instead. Totally awesome! the onions took almost an hour to cook, but i had anticipated that from other reviewers and other onion soup recipes. Highly recommend.

Perfect for a snowy day in early March!

WOW! Made the whole recipe for 2 of us, hoping for leftovers. Managed to have about a cup leftover. After about 15 minutes, the onions began to stick to the pan a bit, and I used some of the broth to deglaze the bottom of the pan and mixed it into the onions. Worked great. Used a hot and sweet mustard, as I was out of dijon and a liberal splash of brandy. Definately use the croutons, too! Best onion soup in ages. A real keeper!

Made it without the ham for a five course Oscar night dinner. It went very well with the rest of the menu. Everyone enjoyed it but I can't say it was much of a departure from traditional french onion soup.

This was a great recipe, and a big hit at the group I cook for each week at the riding stable. I made a double batch as I feed alot of people. I used red onions and did not add the brandy until a little bit before serving. I had a bowl before adding the brandy, and would say that it was equally good, just a little different. I used rosemary ham (from the deli) and it was amazing. I made some croutons with ham, and some without. I would definitely have it with the ham next time I make it. It made it different and so good. The ham and cheese croutons were gone before the plain cheese ones. I will definitely make it again, as, a good french onion soup is essential in one's soup repertoire. Perfect on a damp cold day after riding!

This soup was amazing. My husband couldn't believe how good it was. -especially since i had changed it up just a little to make it vegetarian. i'm challenging myself to being a vegetarian for a month and my husband is a meat lover. I made the actual soup part as directed but used mushroom broth instead of beef. It sounds like some people had a hard time getting the large amount of onions to brown. i just turned my heat to high for little while to cook away the onion juices and they did eventually brown after about 20 min. you just have to keep cooking!!! at the end i just toasted some sourdough and put it on top of the soup in my crock bowls and some provolone on top of that and broiled it for a few min in the oven! scrumcious!

I made this recipe vegetarian substituting beef stock for vegetarian stock and omitting the ham. It was GREAT! Finishing off with port instead of brandy gave it a little more smokiness that imitates more of a 'beefy' flavor. The one thing I would do differently is cut the onions into shorter pieces. I thinly sliced them, but would do more dicing as the longs strands in the soup weren't always easy to eat. Other than that, delicious.

This soup is divine! I agree completely with the other reviewers. Next time I make this, I probably will make the onions in a crock pot, as they ALMOST got away from me. If you don't cook the onions in a crock pot, just make sure you watch them carefully, ESPECIALLY once they start to turn brown, so that they don't burn. Also, I didn't have any brandy so I added a little port instead, and it was delicious. In fact, it was delicious before I added the brandy, but I know that this is "brandied" onion soup so one should probably employ it. This is also SUPER easy to make--- so long as you watch the onions. Absolutely, absolutely make this!

This is a great, simple take on a traditional soup. We made it the first time without the ham, but we'll go with it next time for sure. I just loved the simplicity of it. This was a first course for a wonderful raclette dinner.

Epicurious does it again! This was a complete hit. Followed the recipe with no changes -- the guests loved it. Will definitely make again and again...

For the soup: I never seem to caramelize large amounts of onions properly on a stove (too light or too burned) so I combined this recipe with Lora Brody's recipe for caramelizing onions in a crockpot (search Epicurious recipes for caramelized onions) and it was awesome.

Delicious! Better than any french onion soup I've had in a restaurant!!! Used a mix of brown onions and vidalias and it was really good. Definitely make the croutons, nice addition to the soup!

I've made this several times. It is outstanding! Made the croutons the first time and haven't bothered since. The soup is excellent. I've made it using Vidalia onions and that's by far the best. Also tried Maui onions, which was also good, but not as good as the Vidalias. What they call "sweet yellow onions" here in southern California aren't as good as either of the others mentioned. Use a mandoline to slice the onions as thin as possible and cook only over medium heat. You want carmelization, not charring.

I didn't do the Croque-Monsieur part. I did it the traditional way. Great flavor.

I love french onion soup! and this was GREAT! I did make my own stock (first time attempt) and had great success! Can't wait to make this again.

This was a simple recipe. Great for cold wet winter evenings when you've already had a large lunch and want something filling with less calories. I put in twice the Brandy and do it without the croutons.
