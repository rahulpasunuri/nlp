Very pleased with the results, although I made one change: garlic cloves can be cut down enough to leave in.

Rating: 4
I made the recipe following changes suggested by other reviewers: 1)added 4 oz chopped pancetta, browned along with garlic 2)used 1 heaping Tbsp. minced garlic and left it in (instead of 10 cloves), plus another teaspoon minced garlic added at the very end along with the parsley, and 3)used only a 28 oz. can of tomatoes, since I couldn't find a 35 oz. can. The result was delicious, and my husband loved it too.

Easy and delicious! I added a teaspoon of sugar, as my guys like their sauce a tad sweeter. Once the pasta and sauce were combined I topped the dishes with some green peas and proscuitto. Will make again and again.

Very good recipe. I used about 5 cloves of chopped garlic plus a minced shallot, as well. I also increased vodka to 1/2 cup, substituted Greek yogurt for the cream, and used basil instead of parsley. Adding home grown tomatoes that were peeled and diced made the entire dish taste very fresh. With or without substitutions and modifications, this recipe works.

Loved it! My daughter and I cooked this together, it was great fun to cook and came out fabulous! We made a few minor substitutions: 28oz can of tomatoes instead of 35 (largest size our store had), 1 heaping tbsp of minced garlic instead of cloves (left in the sauce of course), and rigatoni instead of penne (which I would recommend). Next time we might add basil or pancetta, this recipe is a great base to experiment with. Thanks so much for sharing it, will definitely make again!

This is an excellent recipe and very easy to make (I doubled the recipe and froze what I didn't use). As other have suggested, I added a bit more vodka, extra tomatoes and sauteed the chopped garlic in half EVOO and half butter (and left the garlic in the sauce). My house smells amazing...

I only made this once, and I would like to try it again with more vodka. It had the right consistency and creaminess, but the unique flavor of vodka sauce wasn't quite there. I made a video of the dish for my blog: http://makeityourdamnself.wordpress.com (Penne with Vodka Sauce)

The Soprano's Family Cookbook (page 82) makes only the following adjustments to this otherwise excellent recipe: 4 oz thinly sliced proscuitto cut into strips - this goes in after the garlic. Saute for 2 minutes. Tomato note: can be fresh and diced. The whole processing is unnecessary. Yes - use the all the garlic. Penne alla Vodka Sauce (with proscuitto) is a fav of 'Paulie Walnuts' and my family too.

Yum. This is soooooo good. How can you go wrong with butter, olive oil, pasta, heavy cream, cheese, and vodka? My boyfriend loved the dish, and ate all four extra servings. He then begged for more. I would definitely take the advice of some other reviewers and add the garlic back to the sauce after a turn in the food processor. I will make this again!

added the pancetta, as some others have & agree it adds depth to the dish. was also out of parm, so used goat gouda, which was the hardest cheese I had in my fridge at the time- wow- it was fantastic! also, used all 10 garlic cloves, crushed 2 of them & never fished them out. best vodka sauce ever!

Quick, easy sauce. Also never a fan of vodka sauce until this. Added a chopped onion since I only had a clove of garlic, which I just diced and kept in the sauce. I also used diced tomatoes and tomato paste. The flavor was perfect for me this way...with a little extra cream added. I can't wait to make this with more garlic. Yum yum!

This sounded a little bland, so I sauteed a chopped shallot in olive oil, then added 3 cloves crushed garlic, the pepper flakes, and about 1/2 tsp oregano for a minute or so then followed the rest of the directions. I only used 1/2 lb pasta and don't see how there could be enough sauce for a full pound. The results were delicious and I got lots of compliments on tihs one! Will definitely make again using these modifications.

If you have a vampire problem in your neighborhood, go ahead with this recipe, otherwise don't waste your time, food or money with this culinary disaster! Ten cloves of garlic to serve six people is akin to an elderly lady bathing in a bottle of perfume because her sense of smell has declined over the years and she doesn't realize how overpowering it is for the rest of us! Please step out to a local deli or pizza joint in New York where you can get a simple vodka sauce that will serve as a baseline for how the taste should be! Even better, bribe the chef from il Bastardo in Chelsea for his recipe!

yum yum YUM. i did not add the additional oil/butter and used a hilarious amount of red pepper flakes, to the tune of about 2 Tbsp. it was so damn good and makes a solid 4 servings, easy. some crispy pancetta/sliced grilled chicken/mushroom ravioli [Pastaworks here in Portland makes the BEST] would be extra delicious but it is supah tasty on its own. a simple green salad with Newman's Basalmic and a glass of Shiraz turned a cranky "oh man, i so don't wanna cook" night into an evening filled with smug glee as my boyfriend exclaimed "oh babe. this is $#@&ing awesome!" while he snorfled forkfuls in a dead-on impersonation of the dog. make this dish! [and mebbe whisk in a pulverized clove or two just for kicks. everything always needs more garlic.]

This has become a family favoirite. I like to mince the garlic (8 cloves worth) and leave it all in the sauce. I also let the tomato/garlic cook down until most of the water and vodka evaporate before adding the cream. I don't add the extra olive oil or butter at the end, too greasy. Sometimes I saute some chicken breast, cut it up, and add it to the sauce for a heartier meal. My 7 year old exclaimed "I'm so full, but I can't stop eating it!" the last time I made it. Works for me.

What a great sauce! I served it over ricotta gnocchi, so I really cooked the sauce down before adding the cream - then tossed it all together with 8 oz of cubed fresh mozzarella. I used 1 tsp of pepper flakes, but will probably go to 1 1/2. My husband didn't even complain about the lack of meat!

I intended to serve this with crab incorporated into the sauce (a restaurant we like does the same) so I processed all of the tomatoes to make a smoother tomato sauce which wouldn't compete with my chunks of crab. I also used fusilli instead of penne because husband has a strange aversion to penne (seriously). I also halved it since it was just for the two of us...otherwise followed the recipe as written. My husband and I thought this was good; maybe not company-worthy but perfect easy dinner at home. I started the sauce while the water boiled, was finshing it up as the pasta drained, and found it quick enough. Would make again, and would include the crab again - it was really nice.

My husband really liked this dish. My only complaint with the recipe is they don't sell 35-oz. cans of tomatoes in my neck of the woods. I used a 28-oz can and reduced all the other ingredients by one-fifth -- which was kind of wacky.

This recipe was ok...it was simple and easy to make, but I'm not sure...maybe for me it was missing something. I fished the garlic out, but put it through the food processor and added it back to the sauce. I gave up meat for Lent, so perhaps after Lent is over I will try it with bacon or proscuitto. An ex-boyfriend from a long time ago used to make it with bacon and his penne vodka was to die for...maybe I'm just comparing the two unfairly. This is easy to make though...I would make it again.

I've made this receipe at least 5 times for guests. It is easy, delicious and got some unique caracteristics to it. I've cut down on the red pepper because its overwhelming and very spicy. I've added a splash of fresh oregano and a table spoon of feta cheeese and some u-8 deveined and peeled shrimp. I usually cook by instinct but following this receipe was fairly easy and adding a few extra ingredients can be done without masking its original wonderful taste. I will keep on making it as long as I have new guests over. Perfect for serving a crowd of 6-10 people.

The sauce was more acidic than other vodka sauces I've made, but very delicious. It's impossible to mess up--I meant to halve the recipe, but forgot a few times to halve an ingredient and was able to correct the entire thing easily (thankfully!). A great, easy, delicious weeknight recipe.

I love people who write, "I made this recipe EXACTLY as it calls for. But I added prosciutto and a minced shallot, used light cream, egg noodles, slightly more than 1/2 a cup of vodka, and swirled in a large cinnamon bun at the end. This recipe is terrible." This recipe is fine. I did the above (ok, with the exception of the cinnamon bun...) and PROBABLY should've used a more precise amount of vodka -- despite the quality of the vodka it left a bit of a bite on the back of the throat. I also added a touch of sugar to decrease the acidity of the tomatoes and that worked out perfectly. I'll make this again. NEXT time, I'll use TWO cinnamon buns...

This is a staple around our house, both as a regular meal and for entertaining. the original recipe seems too complicated so I simply brown the garlic, toss in the tomatoes, let simmer and then use my submersible blender to puree both the tomatoes and the garlic. Then add the cream, parsley and cheese and you're good to go. Serve with a great salad and garlic bread, yum!

YUM, YUM! This was wonderful and very easy. I tweaked it a little, based upon others' suggestions: Sauteed abut 1/3 cup minced white onion in the olive oil with the garlic until very soft, removed the garlic, added 2 tablespoons tomato paste, blended well and added the tomatos, etc. Used 1/3 cup quality vodka (v.s. 1/4) and finished with 3/4 cup of 1/2 & 1/2 (v.s. 1/2 cup cream). Topped with a good amount of fresh ground pepper, Pecorino Romano cheese & fresh Italian parsley. When I removed the garlic cloves from the olive oil, I smashed them into a few tablespoons of unsalted butter and slathered the mix onto thick slices of Italian bread and placed under the broiler for a few minutes. Served with a green salad. My family loved this, even the 4-year old. The flavors were deep and mellow, probably due to the addition of the tomato paste and onion. There was pleanty of sauce for 1# penne (additional liquid from the increased amount of vodka and cream) Got to love garlic for this dish! And we do! Will definately do again!

This is a favorite standby when I have a bit of extra cream on hand. Depending on the brand of vodka you have, you may need a bit more to get any hint of its taste in the final product.

I printed this recipe out to help me use up some ingredients I had on hand, but I didn't follow to the letter. I had two pints of vine-ripened tomatoes which I chopped and seeded. I had some heavy cream and vodka to use up, and otherwise I had only dried herbs around. I used dried parsely, and threw in some oregano and basil, plus the crushed red pepper. What I really needed the recipe for was for ratio of vodka to cream in relation to the whole sauce, and it came out well.

My husband and teenager liked this dish; I thought it was OK. I made the full recipe of sauce for 12 oz. of spaghetti - too much sauce. I think the leftover sauce may be great with a Sunday morning omelet, though. I also couldn't really taste the vodka, or whatever it is supposed to do for ths dish. I think it's one of those overrated dishes. (I do have Lidia's book and have made other great recipes out of it. I've heard about Rachel's recipe from Oprah, too!) I think I'll save the vodka for, er, other purposes.

I made this recipe on Saturday evening for Sunday dinner-we ate this for lunch and dinner on Saturday and again on Sunday. It is delicious with a few substitutions. I used fresh plum tomatoes and a half a can of tomato paste diluted with chicken stock. I also sauteed the garlic but did not remove it as suggested-I mashed it into the sauce. I also substituted cayenne pepper for the pepper flakes.

Yum! Decadent and nearly as good as our favorite restaraunt without the 30+ minute drive. Used 1 tsp of red pepper flakes and gave it a light kick; maybe will use more next time. Also added 3 oz diced prosciutto while sauteing the garlic which worked pretty well if you don't mind that the sauce isn't as smooth. I agree with those who thought it wasn't enough sauce for 16 oz pasta. Added pasta into sauce slowly and ended up with about 12 oz as a good amount to coat it completely. Will definitely make again!

Just like the chef from Timbuck2, I also made Rachel's vodka pasta and found that it didn't exactly dazzle my now husband (beef tenderloin did, however). Ever since I saw Lidia make this recipe on PBS, I have been dying to try it. It was delicious (I added olive oil at the end) and my husband hovered over the pan, sneaking tastes with a spoon. I can't wait to make it again!

This dish is perfect as it is. I tried it once with fresh tomatoes, but had to add tomato paste to match the richness of flavor you get with canned ones. My only recommendation is that you use a good quality vodka when you make this -- the harshness of a cheap brand will really show in this dish.

I've tried Rachel's recipe (from the Food Channel) and 6 of us looked at each other & decided we were glad we didn't depend on that recipe to get us our hubby. We used the very best & freshest of everything. This one, however, suits our tastes much better. Even our husbands. Someone awhile back in the critiques said that if you add the vodka too soon, the flavor cooks out. Not true. The ALCOHOL is cooked out--supposedly. But that is even in question with some. I hesitate to serve anything with alcohol in the ingredients to young children. No matter how long it has cooked. Just to be on the safe side.

Well worth it even after a full day of work on a Monday. Doubled the tomatoes and used a full cup of cream. Added sauce to the pasta over a LOW flame then tossed in fresh parsley and grated parmesan. Heat helps bind the sauce and cheese to the pasta. Served in a bowl with extra sauce on top. As per my bf's request I added on some mixed vegetable tapenade that I had to his sauce before serving and he loved it. We froze the leftover sauce. Leftover pasta was good even the next day which is RARE for a vodka sauce. Perfect amount of cream in it and we are not fans of heavy dishes.

In researching this recipe, I found that most professional cooks; 1)add the penne to the sauce, 2)add the vodka LAST tossing it to mix and then heat it for 2 minutes and serve it right away. When added earlier (vodka) the flavor is cooked away. I also think children should not eat this if the vodka is added last.

This recipe was wonderful! Easy, quick, even my kids enjoyed it. I processed the tomatoes until they were pureed, minced three of the garlic cloves, leaving them in the sauce, used 1/3 cup vodka and no extra EEOV or butter at the end. It came out fabulous. This will be my go-to alla vodka recipe.

I made this sauce and was dissapointed. I felt it lacked flavor. I even left the garlic in and added an onion and a shallot like others had suggested. I agree that this sauce is a tad too acidic. I would not make this sauce again. Im going to give Rachel's sauce a try....she's on Oprah today!!!

For me the above recipe is the keeper, though I do crush four cloves of garlic and leave it in and double the vodka. Great dish for week night guests.

I used crushed tomatos, and instead of shallots I added about 1/4 cup of white onions. I added about 2 pinches of crushed red pepper, and instead of basil, I added about three bay leaves which I removed before serving. I also used about 4 cloves of garlic, minced. At the end I added the 3/4 cup of parmesan, and I really think that made the dish. It was absolutely delicious. I made it for my hunny on Valentines Day, and he couldnt get enough!

Sorry, Lydia...I agree with the Chicago reviewer...this is the worst vodka sauce I've ever tasted. I am an avid cook, learning many of my skills at home from my Sicilian born and raised mom, the rest from trying new cuisines. So, I am not a newbie to flavors and techniques. My parents had a fruit and veggie store and we had a huge garden and created all this great, organic food throughout my childhood and adult life...this recipe is missing pancetta, proscuitto or ham, which you saute before adding garlic and I would also add some finely diced onion like another excellent recipe I tried before this one. I only tried this recipe because of all the great reviews.

Rating: 3
I thought this was really tasty - although I recommend serving it with something else. On its own it can get monotonous. I grilled chicken and sliced it over the pasta. Also, I only used 3 cloves of garlic because that's all I had and it was a bit bland - definitely kick up the garlic to make it more exciting.

Rating: 3
Excellent dish, though I recommend doubling the sauce otherwise it's a bit too dry. Also, I would double the heavy cream. I almost looked like a red sauce. Be sure to use whole garlic, so that you add the flavor and can easily remove it towards the end. I think too much red pepper makes it a bit too spicy. I love it, but my boyfriend doesn't. I might add peas next time.

This was AMAZING!!! Probably the best Penne alla Vodka sauce I have ever tasted! I modified the recipe just a tad... I reduced the amount of garlic to 5 cloves and added 1 shallot (minced); I used 2-3 T. of olive oil AND 3 T. of butter instead of 1/4 c. of oil (in skillet); reduced amount of cream to 1/4 c.; added 4 large basil leaves to tomatoe sauce; and substituted crushed red pepper with cayenne pepper - just a pinch will give it the right amount of kick. Lots of parmesean cheese is essential. Mmmmm! This recipe was not only delicious, but SOOOOO easy!

Yow! This is spectacular! We took the advice of other reviews and looked at Rachel Ray's recipe, too, which inspired us to add shallots to this recipe. Because quantities aren't specified, we went easy on the salt and the red pepper flakes, and found that we needed to add both at the table. Will add more salt and red pepper while cooking in the future. Also, this reheats well. We threw in more cream when reheating and it gave the dish a delightful creamy texture (and more cream is never bad, right?)

Rating: 3
As another reviewer had previously stated, I too combined this recipe along with Rachel Ray's recipe and yielded a dish worthy of 3 forks. I sauteed 1T. of minced garlic, and 1/4c. of minced shallots in 3T. of olive oil. Then I added 2 large pinches of red pepper flakes. Next came 1c. of vodka, cooked until reduced by half. 1c. of strong chicken broth was added, then the tomatoes. I simmered for 15 minutes to reduce the liquids then added 1/2c. heavy cream, 2T. of butter, 3T. of Italian parsley, and 1/2c. of torn basil leaves. Mixed in the al dente penne and continued to cook until sauce coated the pasta and enough starch was released to thicken the sauce. Lastly I added 1/3c. of grated parmigiano-reggiano. Served over seasoned chicken tenders perpared on my stovetop grill, and topped with crimini mushrooms that had been sauteed with butter/evoo combo, garlic, and a splash of vodka. Will make with salmon filet next time, as we had in restaurant.

Made this last night and it was great! Go easy on the red pepper flakes if you don't like "hot" food, we over did them, but would go easy on them next time. Also, be careful when you put the garlic in the oil, it splattered and the oil did hit me in several places. Use oven mitts.

This was very good. But I've also made Rachel Ray's "You Won't Be Single For Long Vodka Cream Pasta" and it is by far the best vodka sauce I've ever had. It's restaurant quality... with a loaf of garlic bread, you wont believe you're eating such great food in the comfort of your home. And definitely use San Marzano tomatoes, a bit more expensive but well worth it!

Wow. This was good...and incredibly easy to make. Mine was very spicy with a lot of red pepper flakes, delicious over lobster ravioli. I'll check out Rachel Ray's recipe but this seems hard to beat!!

Wow, is this good. Beware it's also incredibly garlicky if you leave in the garlic cloves (like I did). In my defense, I used 4 cloves as opposed to the 10 as written. Incredibly easy to make.

This recipe is excellent. Infusing the olive oil with sauteed garlic gives the sauce great depth of flavor. The best penne alla vodka I have tried. So easy to make too.

This is fine (I like Lidia's recipes), but if you really want SUPERIOR vodka sauce, listen to the other reviewers. Go to the FOODTV site and make Rachel Ray's "You Won't Be Single For Long Vodka Cream Pasta". The FOODTV site is awful, no comparision to this one- it is hard to find things & IMO needs a major overhaul. But the sauce tastes just like what you would find in a great restaurant. It was amazingly delicious. Use San Marzano tomatoes. They are worth it for this.

this is the worst vodka sauce I've ever had. Very bland and too acidic. Any of the jarred sauces I've tried are better.

Simple and RELIABLE recipe. Made this numerous times. Sometimes used crushed tomatoes (if my processor is dirty). Sometimes let the garlic burn JUST A LITTLE, to give the sauce a more smokey flavor. Fresh herbs are great, but even using dried Italian spices (basil, oregano, etc) will work out fine. If making sauce the day ahead, do NOT add cream until the day you're actually serving it. Delicious!!

This recipe had good consistency and provided a good basic vodka tomato cream sauce recipe, but it lacked much flavor aside from that. I would double the vodka next time because I could not taste it in the final product, and I added a healthy amount of dried basil and oregano. I also threw the garlic back in when I was done because I didn't have the heart to throw it away. All in all a good dinner, both my girlfriend and I stuffed our faces with abandon.

Delicious, restaurant-quality vodka sauce. I also sauteed a cup each of julienned carrots and zucchini with about a cup of peas, in with the garlic, and then poured the tomato sauce in, making it more like a "vodka primavera". I also used bow-tie pasta to hold onto more sauce and veggies. Will definitely make it again!!

I had been craving this dish and this recipe was exactly what I had in mind. I, too, had tried the Rachel Ray version on Foodtv.com but thought it had too many tomatoes, which made it not much different than a plain old marinara. This one was distinctly different. Really hit the spot and the family loved it too.

Took the advice of the Virginia cook and looked up FoodTV's "You Won't Be Single For Long Vodka Cream Pasta." I combined these 2 recipes - and IMO the addition of the chicken stock made it less bland. I also pureed the sauce at the very end with a hand blender.

I don't particularly like this recipe, but will do almost anything to keep the salted water recipe from rising again! If you do try this dish, use one full cup of good vodka and reduce it to a couple of tablespoons. You'll get a much brighter flavor without an overwhelming boozy character.

I enjoyed this dish, but agree that it was a little bland although a great base recipe to work with. The brand of the canned tomatoes does make a difference so find the best you can. I added quite a bit of extra flat leaf parsley and for a different taste, added crumbled goat cheese when served. I Definitely will make this dish again.

Rating: 4
My husband and I loved this dish. It was very easy and tastes just like the dish I had in little Italy, NY. The only thing I'd change - leave in the garlic (plus add more than it calls for) and find San Marzano tomatoes (a must - they're the best). I also added a little extra cream, vodka and lots of romano/parm cheese . I make this dish once a week!

Rating: 3
My initial impression was that this was a little bland. The red pepper gave it some heat on the back end, but it seemed to be lacking something. A good, aged parmesan helped quite a bit and stirring a dollop of goat cheese into the serving bowl tipped it in. This ended up great and was quite easy.

I don't feel qualified to rate it, since I departed from the ingredients somewhat. I write instead as a caution against tinkering with the fat content. I made this last night using a 28-oz can of San Marzano tomatoes, half-and-half instead of cream, about 1/3 cup of the cheese, and none of the optional oil/butter at the end (but I did add a bit of extra Absolut and parsley). We found it somewhat bland and one-dimensional, the garlic and red pepper notwithstanding.

This dish was an instant hit with my wife and children! I increased the dosage of vodka from 1/4 cup to 2 1/2 cups and immediately turned off the heat when I poured in the liquor so I didn't cook off any of the alcohol.

This recipe was good, but not great. Not all that different from a typical red sauce. I expected more rich flavor from the cream. It was easy and I did enjoy it, but it's just not that distinctive of a dish. Good for a hearty, middle-of-the-road pasta dish for a party -- it makes a ton! Maybe some fresh herbs (other than just the parsley, which I love, but it just didn't contribute much flavor)would elevate the dish - rosemary, maybe?

Passable but certainly nothing spectacular. Not sure what all the fuss is about, other than that it's quick to prepare. If you do make it, I'd suggest adding a diced Spanish onion with the garlic and peas near the end if you're so inclined -- and do spice it up a bit. Overall I was disappointed.

This recipe rivals any that I have had in restaurants. It is fabulous!! I recommend making a little extra sauce or using a little less pasta or there won't be extra to soak up with bread.

Made this recipe almost exactly as written, including the processing of good quality San Marzano tomatoes. I was probably a little heavy handed with the salt, the vodka, perhaps with the cream, and definitely with the crushed red pepper. My results were fantastic.

I loved this recipe because it is a simple and delicious red sauce to add to anyone's list of favorite pasta dishes to make. I forgot to add the last bit of butter or oil and I didn't miss it. I think for someone who is alergic to tomatoes this would not be the sauce to make because the tomatoes are central to the experience. An alternative suggestion would be to research either a garlic/oil based sauce or other cream sauces. There is no end to great pasta dishes!

Uh...yummm. This is a great recipe that I deviated on a teensy bit. I added 3 cloves of garlic to the parsley when I minced it in my food processor and I left the smashed garlic in the sauce. I probably cooked the sauce longer than most because I was making meatballs at the same time and started the sauce before I put the water on to boil. When I tossed with the pasta, I didn't let it cook down very long because the sauce was so creamy and velvety, I wanted alot of it. Great flavor. Great weeknight meal.

This was okay. To be fair, I must admit that I cut a few corners (used dried parsley and the canned crushed tomatoes suggested by one reviewer) and that I was also trying to reduce the yield by about 1/3, so I may have got the proportions off. It was all fine, but it didn't sparkle. Next time I will puree the tomatoes as instructed for a smoother sauce, and instead of mixing the sauce and pasta before serving I will let each diner add sauce and cheese at the table to suit him- or herself.

I saw Lidia prepare this on her PBS show and was very intrigued, so I was very happy to find her recipe here. It was very easy and quick to make and went over well. I didn't have cream or much butter so I resorted to 1/2 and 1/2 and olive oil, I think cream and more butter would be better. I especially liked cooking the pasta in sauce, it is a nice technique I 'll use in other pasta dishes. This will be a great recipe to serve company, it tastes like it's hard to make.

Who says vodka sauce had to be smooth? I also don't remove the garlic, as cooked it is very mild.

This is just one of the fabulous recipes from Lidia Bastianich. We really enjoyed this dish. The essence of Italian cooking is simple, fresh ingredients.

I also added chicken as someone else had suggested and what a great idea. I didn't even take out the garlic at the end and it was great. The food is almost all gone by this morning and I brought some for lunch. This recipe would have went great with a side salad and some Italian bread for dipping. It's a keeper. Four stars...

I am throwing my old Vodka Sauce recipe away. This was the best!

This is my favorite Italian dish and I am dying to make it. I am wondering if I can substitute the heavy cream for something less fattening. Any suggestions?

I added grilled chicken in this recipe. Salt and brown 2 halves of boneless chicken breasts in a pan with olive oil. Cut the chicken in small bite-size pieces. Add it to the recipe - before the vodka and heavy cream step. I think it adds a bit more flavor.

The first time I made this, I used half-n-half, and it was so-so. I made it again for Valentines Day, and used more red pepper, vodka and cream, and it was delicious! Serve with a salad, and you have a great vegetarian meal.

Very easy and tasty dish, but needed a little more vodka. Added one pound of shrimp, marinated in garlic/olive oil then broiled over the top just before the parsley.

Amazing flavour. I added more crushed red pepper than suggested. It worked well with a panzanella salad. If you don't have great olive oil, use the butter at the end.

I wanted to make this dish and it might be me, but I read the directions through twice and didn't see the cream mentioned anywhere in the directions. Am I just missing it? There is cream listed in the ingredients and you would have to have cream in this sauce. Where and when do you add it?

Not interesting enough to be a main dish, but a pleasant side one. It was a good foil for grilled salmon.

Really tasty - my usual recipe uses twice as much vodka and cream so I went in between and used half-and-half to cut down a bit on fat. I also added the red pepper flakes along with the garlic to bring out more flavor and even left in some of the garlic at the end. I undercooked the pasta a bit to compensate for boiling it in the sauce which worked out well; after it reduced a bit, the texture was just perfect.

Good flavor, and easy to prepare. I had higher expectations, and was kind of disappointed, but it gets better the next day and reheats well.

Made this as a main course with a Caesar side salad. Had a wonderful flavor. Went together very easily. I will definately make again as a side dish or for a nice lunch.

I made this last night and it was really good. I didn't add the extra olive oil or butter at the end and the sauce was still delicious. Great method of cooking the pasta, too. I'll use it from now on.
