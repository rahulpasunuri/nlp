I substituted tilapia for the tuna (as it was what we had on hand) and olive oil for the butter, toss it on the grill for a few minutes and it was divine! Even my 4yr old liked it, and he doesn't like anything that doesn't come with peanut butter.

What could be easier? other reviewers mention the cost of the tuna. As ours was in the deep freezer from husband and son's fishing trip, what's the cost? The toast idea was a big hit with hubby. We used fresh Italian bread, as he does not like sourdough. We used to put Dijon on the tuna itself during the grilling, but having it as the "spread" on bread is a better idea. We grill it out-of-doors, so maybe the disappointed reviewers wee broiling it. I don't broil any fish.

Our son made this dish for us last weekend and it was awesome. He marinated the partially frozen mahi mahi with the butter rosemary dijon sauce for a while, then broiled it to perfection. (Skipped the toast.) It was wonderful!

TUNA is meant to be prepared rare. HOW anyone can go wrong with this recipe is baffling. THE tuna is the where ALL the flavor is. The butter is called a "condiment".

At the price of tuna this turned out to be a big mistake. Never again.

I added cilantro and lime to the butter and I loved it. I think you could add what ever flavors that you like and it would taste great. ( Make sure to add some salt to the butter)

Absolutely delicious. Since both hubby and I like our tuna rare, I just seared the steaks in a very hot pan - would not suggest this recipe unless you like your tuna virtually raw. As per your tip, it's too dry otherwise.

The rosemary/mustard butter was wonderful but overall the preparation of the tuna was boring and not worth the cost of tuna. Look for another recipe but keep the rosemary butter in mind for possible future use.
