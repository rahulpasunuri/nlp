I screwed up the recipe and added too much cocoa (3 tbsp instead of 2). So I added an extra 1/2 to all other spices, and it was the most delicious chicken wings recipe ever. I made it again today and ran out of regular chili powder, found that a little of mexican hot chili powder nicely added some heat. I love this recipe, and my guests and sweetheart agreed. They were gone in a flash last time, and I was asked to make them again.

This mole was incredible UNTIL I added the tomatoes. Then that special earthy yumminess just vanished and I was left with tomato mud. Next time I am skipping the can tomato and will be dining in heaven.

Don't be intimidated by the long list of ingredients. The mole sauce comes together quickly and easily and you can make it while the chicken wings are broiling. The spices are very tasty. It does make a LOT of sauce. I made the recipe as is except I used about 1 can of tomato sauce instead of drained tomatoes and I didn't need the 3rd cup of broth. The sauce was the right consistency. I used an immersion blender to puree the sauce. I will experiment with other mole recipes but this one will stay in the file. This would be a great sauce to freeze for quick use later.

I love that an 'easy' mole sauce still has 15 ingredients. I also love that I can make homemade mole now, for a weeknight supper! Granted, it did take a little more time than some weeknight meals, but the results are worth it. I have made the three day mole as well, and while it had far more depth of flavour, this one is still well worth the effort. I used fresh, seeded tomatoes, because that is what I had. Otherwise I made it according to the recipe. Will certainly make again.

My adaptation, based on other reviews and what I had in the house: 5 garlic cloves, minced 1 tsp coriander 3/4 teaspoon cinnamon 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder 3 tablespoons peanut butter 2-3 oz baking chocolate, bittersweet a 1-pound can diced tomatoes with juice 14 oz can tomato sauce 3 tbsp chopped prunes 2 teaspoons sugar 4 tbsp honey 1/4 cup orange juice 1-1/2 cups water 1-1/2 tbs canned chipotles Sautee garlic in olive oil. Add cocoa, herbs and spices; cook 1 minute over medium heat. Add wet ingredients. Heat through. Add chocolate, peanut butter, and sugar (use less PB than recipe says - it was a bit too peanut-y; 2 tbsp at most). Simmer over medium until flavors are well combined. Puree with hand held tool. If too thick/rich, add extra water/juice/stock.

First time making mole (read the authentic version & thought I'd start here after reading the reviews). Took advantage of previous cook's tips... used 1/2 can of drained tomatoes, doubled the peanut butter, added 1-2 t. ea. ground pasilla & New Mexican chili peppers & added 2-3 oz. of good 73% dark chocolate in addition to cocoa/sugar already in recipe. *Used chicken breasts sprinkled with lots of cumin browned in oil, sliced into strips & simmered in sauce. This sauce is delicious! Mexican friend that's a lifetime mole fan pronounced it really, really good with awesome flavor/texture. Thanks everyone for the tips. Try this recipe...you'll love it.

I made the "three-day-mole" on this site and, while it was truly delicious and fun to make, I usually cannot afford the time it takes so decided to give this one a try. I was mightily impressed! Very easy and full of flavor. I used shredded rotisserie chicken in place of the wings and followed one reviewers suggestion to use 1 1/2 cups of tomato puree for the tomatoes. Otherwise I made it as is: will definitely make again and will keep some in the freezer for quick meals!

I too added chocolate (semi-sweet baking chocolate) but in addtion to the cocoa, not in place of. It added the right amount of sweetness that I like in a true mole as well as the darker color. As an avid mole fan, I thought this was an excellent version and certainly alot easier than a "true" authentic version. Highly recommend!

Although I indicated that I would make this dish again, I'd like to try some other mole recipes before I do. For the number of ingredients listed here, this recipe seemed surprisingly one-dimensional.

Rating: 3
A very forgiving recipe but not necessarily easy. Plan to have an hour or two the first time you make it plus lots of dishes. The other comments about the tomatos were accurate so be very careful how much you add. Otherwise, use all the onions as they give body and sweetness. I used dark chocolate instead of cocoa and it was great. It makes alot of sauce so plan to have leftovers unless you are feeding ten. I roasted chicken thighs and then cut up the meat. Excellent. I plan to get a supermarket chicken later in the week for an easy weeknight supper. I also made a peach salsa with it and it was a perfect counterpoint to the spices in the mole. If you like mole, try this recipe and use spices and chiles that you have like in other dishes. Good luck.

My husband said this was better mole than his Mexican roomate made. I did use less tomatoes as others suggested, and made it with boneless, skinless chicken breast, but other than that, I did follow the recipe.

Wow! After feeling daunted by the "three-day authentic mole" recipe on this site, I decided that the easy version was at least worth a try. It was, as promised, easy as well as delicious. Based on other reviewers' comments, I was wary of adding the can of tomatoes, and instead opted for 1 1/2 cups of tomato puree. That seemed to be a great amount in terms of taste, texture, and color, so I will stick with that alteration in the future. Also, since we had no chili powder, I roasted three fresh pasilla chiles and ground them into a paste (made about 1 1/2 Tbsp). Nice smokiness, and light on the heat (though I have a feeling that tomorrow's mole may be hotter as the peppers 'age'). I used only 2 cups chicken stock...think the third cup would have made it too thin. Part of achieving the rich color may have something to do with your patience in browning the onions. I went for a color closer to 'brown' than 'golden brown.' We shredded a rotisserie chicken instead of the wings: moist and easy! Will definitely make again - though it will be awhile, since we have 2 cups of mole left over (no complaints!).

This recipe is absolutely awesome. Made it basically as is (didn't use chicken wings, but chunks of chicken instead) and my boyfriend and I ate it up! Will definitely make this again in the very near future.

Yum! Been craving mole and there are no good Mex. restaurants in Belgium! This was the first time I ever made it myself and was very happy with results after tweaking a bit. Based on previous reviews, I cut back on the onion and tomato (used about a cup of onion and only about 1/3 can of chopped tomatos, just enough to redden up the brown color a little. Also, I decided no way was I going to have mole without the texture of ground nuts! so I also thru into the blender a handful of peanuts and a handful of pumpkin seeds (after first roasting and browning them a bit deeper in a skillet). Also, to counteract the richness of the nuts and the power of the spices and peppers, I decided some more fruity tang would be called for and so a couple of strips of chopped lemon skin went in to the blender also. Excellent!

This recipe is a keeper. The flavor is dead on authentic Mole. I would only change one thing....next time I would add a little flour when sauteeing the roux. This sauce was a little too thin for my taste.

This is a lovely recipe, and I don't like mole! This is the first one I've ever tasted that I liked. But I added an extra glop of peanut butter to give it a bit more character; as posted, it's almost too smooth and the distinctiveness gets lost. I reserve four forks for recipes that are perfect as posted; this one came close, but my extra peanut butter gives it three forks.

Totally fabulous. I couldn't bear to put all those onions in, so I substituted fennel, since the recipe called for anise seeds anyway. It was wonderful.

Rating: 3
At first, things were going swimmingly. Browning onions with spices and choco... wonderful. Then I added a one pound can tomatoes and lost the luscious mixture to the red sea. Next time I will repeat exactly but halve the toms. Still, it was a tasty treat but not the 4 forker it could have been.

If you have"EVER" had AUTHENTIC MOLE FROM ANYWHERE in Mexico this is an authentical dish from there too! I have a cook book from the early 70's and it is the same recipe. You really need to have an elderly MEXICAN LADY make you her dish to really prove this fact to you! Moles here in the USA are all differant and the TEXMEX is totally differant.Mexicans use turkey but still it is as good as this recipe using the meat the recipe calls for!

I don't usually like mole, but wanted to try this after tasting it once. I had to use a square of unsweetened chocolate instead of powder, but it came out OK. But it needed a touch more heat to make it distinctive, and I'm not a particular hot-food person. I also used sauteed chicken breasts cut into big chunks, instead of wings. I'll make it again, but maybe massage the recipe a bit.

This mole is almost as good as my fave restaurants in the Pilson neighborhood of Chicago where the Mexican Museum is. This is easy and a real surprise to mole-lovers. Am making again tonight for my bro and family. Can't wait!

Needs tweaking. Not difficult to do by any means, but not really even close to the mole sauces I've had in restaurants. Still, it shows promise. Maybe more chocolate, less tomato, more raisins... I dunno. It could be that the recipe requires so much adjusting that, unless you're looking for something easy, you should check out the recipes on this site claiming to be more authentic.

I made this with chicken breasts sliced into strips. We liked it, but felt it needed more heat. Next time I will add some habenero...but then we like really like hot!!! I love the fact that it's made with things we always have in the cupboard. This will become one of our kitchen staples for those nights when the cupboards are almost bare.

I'm very new at cooking and the key word for me was "easy" and it is. The second time I made it I roasted and shredded chicken thighs with skin before simmering in the sauce. I had some pretty critical Mexican and Peruvian guests over for dinner and (with their raised eyebrows!) this was the first dish to go. For some reason I liked the crispyness of the skin mixed in with the sauce.

I was searching for a basic recipe to start with and modify for my sauce, and found this to be wonderful. On the second batch, I sauteed the peanut butter and tomato paste in bacon fat until it was deep brown/red. This added a very nice depth of character to the sauce. I added dried chipotle in the third batch, and it is now my staple mole. Very nice sauce!

I have made this many times with broiled, grilled, or shredded chicken and it is always a hit, even with kids. My mexican friends suggested that I use "Abuelita" chocolate to make it authentic (already sweetened) so I omit the extra sugar. I also grind the cloves from whole. I serve it with warm flour tortillas and rice.

This dish was easy to make and tasted very good. I had all the ingredients except I used 5 chicken breasts which I sprinkled with a little cumin, sauted them first and then cut them up into smaller pieces. The sauce was not as dark in color as traditional mole sauce but it had complex flavors that complemented each other and tasted very close to the original sauce. Next time I might reduce the sugar to one teaspoon though. I will defintely make this recipe again.

This dish offers a lot of flavor for not a lot of work! I used boneless skinless breasts that I made on the George Forman grill and then shredded before adding to mole. I also roasted fresh corn and poblano peppers and then rolled everything into a burrito. Excellent and easy.

I thought this mole sauce was about the closest to authentic as I have ever found. I didn't make it with chicken wings, I used boneless, skinless chicken tenders (strips) and browned them before simmering in the sauce. My kids even loved it!

Hadn't had mole since my 1991 honeymoon. When a pregnant girlfriend said she was craving Mexican food and chocolate, I could't resist making mole. This recipe was easy and delicious. I had everything on hand except anise, and I didn't miss it. Will definitely be making this again!

Very good, a solid basic recipe for a mole. In LA I'll always feel out of my league when it comes to moles anyway, but this will do for now. Use any kind of chicken (LA people prefer breast because it's supposedly less fatty) but I use breasts with the skin and bones on - sneaking the fat back in for flavor. Put a lot of cumin on the chicken, and then pan-roast it if you don't want to broil.

I'd been looking for a mole recipe with lots of ingredients that I could use or leave out depending upon who I was cooking for. This is it. Very versatile recipe. I did not use anise, raisins, or cloves, because I didn't have them. I did use solid semi sweet baking chocolate and it worked fine.

This is one of our favorite comfort-food meals. Instead of chicken wings I start a whole, cut-up chicken on the grill, and then finish it simmering with the sauce. Yummy.

An excellent shortcut to great taste! I substituted cubes of pork for the chicken, and cooked until the pork was tender. Outstanding!

I was disappointed. Maybe it was my spices, but it needed more flavor. Try adding some cumin, oregano, more peanut butter and definitely a bittersweet chocolate cube. A real mole is not that much harder and worth the extra effort. Double the wings or halve the sauce.

Yummy. Maybe not authentic but a great substitute when you are in Ohio and missing Mexican food! I used boneless skinless thighs and breasts- sautéed them in a little olive oil before adding the sauce. It was the kids first exposure to mole - a little hesitant at first but they liked it too and it was even better as leftovers.

This was my first introduction to mole sauce and the flavor was wonderful. I think "easy" may be a misnomer for first time users, but I'm making it for the third time tonight, so hopefully it will be easy now.

Was pretty tasty....I used the wings and rice as a main dish. Next time I think I will use less labor intensive chicken(ie. no bones, maybe deboned thighs). Overall was well worth the effort.

This is absolutely the best mole sauce that I've ever had! Better than any restaurant, and better than other recipes I've tried. I added pre-cooked, shredded chicken to the sauce instead of the chicken wings, and served it over rice for an entree. I also used golden raisins. This is a keeper!!

I served this as an hors d'oeuvre without the rice. It was delicious, if a bit on the messy side. Would add dried chiles next time.
