i suggest making this dish via your favorite creme brulee recipe and replacing the vanilla bean w/cardamom. i tend to like a more creamy, less yolky mix for creme brulee, and the cardamom flavor is the perfect compliment to an indian dinner. yum!

This recipe had a wonderful cardamom flavor that you can intensify just by adding a little more cardamom. I loved it with tamarind sugar broiled on the top.

I had the privilege of enjoying this one-of-a-kind dessert at Raji's eponimous restaurant in Memphis and for years remembered it as the most outstandingly memorable creme brulees I have ever eaten. As with all Raji's wonderful creations, this is classic continental comfort food with just a hint of her homeland. There is just enough cardamom to issue images of India. Sadly, the world lost Raji much too soon. She died of cancer in 2002.

I love cardamom in desserts but there is not nearly enough in this recipe. You can't even taste it. I strained the custard into the cups but somehow in baking it became curdled. I'm used to a silky smooth texture. Also the custard was the most unnatural yellow color. I will go back to my recipe from Le Cirque in the future.

This was my first time making creme brulee, and it turned out wonderfully. Easy and delicious.
