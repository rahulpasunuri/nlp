While this was VERY tasty (my favorite dippers were fresh cut pineapple pieces and strawberries, while my guests loved it with plain madeira cake cubes) It was too sharp a flavour when done to the recipe directions. You couldn't taste anything creamy - just sharp runny caramel. I added about 150g of white chocolate to smooth out the flavour a little, which was a resounding success!

I made this for a dinner party and served it with bananas and strawberries, and it was devoured! There was a small glitch though - my friend's brother I found out just doesn't like fruit. So we found all kinds of chocolate, wafers, whatever we could for him to dip it in the fondue and that was also good.

I have made this recipe twice and had it a friend's house and each time it was delicious. I double the recipe and reduce it to make a bit thicker fondue. We dipped angel food cake, marshmallows, brownie bites, pretzels as well as pineapple, apples, strawberries, and bananas. All were great. I used the leftovers in the banana walnut spring rolls dessert recipe also on this site. Thanks to the other reviewer's tips re: not stirring and brushing down the sides of the pan while the sugar was dissolving. Each time I attempted the recipe it came out perfectly. This was a nice alternative dessert to chocolate fondue.

This recipe is absolutely delicious and wonderful with ripe pears. The presentation looked great too. To the cook who had problems with the sugar mixture drying up before carmelizing: make sure you don't stir the mixture while it is 'turning.' It will make a big mess.

I loved this fondue! It was one of 4 dessert fondue's we served this weekend - it was good to have a non-chocolate offering! My kids especially liked it with pretzels! (go figure...) Angel food cake, pound cake cubes and Apple slices were all delicious with it. In fact, I used the left over apples and fondue to make the deep dish caramel apple pie recipe on this site - awesome! I did not have problems with the cooking time - perhaps other reviewers were not familiar with making caramel and were concerned with how vigorously it boils! (use a pot with high sides) Use the temperature settings indicated in the recipe and it should move along quickly. swirling the pan and using the moistened pastry brush is important. Make sure the sugar is completely dissolved before you raise the heat - otherwise the outcome will be somewhat crystalized.

This is a great recipe but I agree that this fondue is very rich. Surprisingly good on strawberries.

This is a delicious, but rich, fondue. I read all the previous reviews and set my time accordingly. It does indeed take about twice as long to prepare as the recipe states, but it is worth the wait. I made this about three hours ahead of time and reheated it and it turned out great.

water kept boiling off before sugar caramelized -- maybe the heat was too hight? We added more water when sugar started to look dry, and it worked. Yum!

yes, the ingredients are good---however, I agree that preparation time is much too long. I would suggest to melt ingredients in the Microwave. Melst sugar with water in a glass dish, covered for 2 minutes on #3 power. Test it! Then continue adding the other ingredients in top of a double boiler., ...and so on.....

A romantic dessert for Valentine's day. As indicated by other reviewers, cooking time was much longer than indicated in the recipe. First step (carmel to amber color) took almost 10 minutes, reducing sauce took over 20 minutes. There was no need to serve in a fondue pot. Mine made it too hot and thin/drippy. I transferred to a ceramic bowl and it stayed warm and with a much better consistency throughout the dessert. Also served with poundcake cut into 1 inch cubes. I think I might try serving with large marshmallows next time.

I used heavy cream but wonder if using light cream would give the same quality if it's reduction time were increased. I love it so much, I would like to make it more often, but the caloric intake is pretty high.

I doubled this recipe- in time and ingredients and served a thick caramel fondue to 15+ guests Everyone loved it. I've got to say that the star fruit and asian pears didn't go over as well as the fresh strawberries and pineapple chunks (I kept the pineapple, hollwed it out and used it as a bowl/centerpiece for an accompaning fruit plate).Just remember to cook everything twice as long and you will have a nice thick, creamy fondue!

This fondue was out of this world! I also found the consistancy to be a little bit thin, so I added about 4 oz of cream cheese to mine and it was fantastic. Not a drop was left in the pot!

Flavors didn't blend well, quantity too small for a regular-sized fondue pot (2 qt.?), and the consistency was NOT smooth at all. It lacks vanilla flavor - a much better choice for dessert fondue is the caramel sauce that accompanies the foolproof chocolate soufflé Bon Appetit Cooking Class recipe (http://www.epicurious.com/b_ba/b02_class/souffle/souffle.html), which is what I made & served after I threw away this caramel-cognac sauce!

I agree with the other chefs. The mixture takes much longer to reduce than the recipe states. But it is well worth the time. Once reduced to the proper consistency, it suddenly transforms to a heavenly flavor! This is, by far, my favorite dessert fondue.

I followed the recipe to the letter and ended up with a very thin, very sweet sauce. It tasted delicious but wasn't a consistency that you could really dip cake or fruit into as a fondue.

We are a fondue family and this is one excellent addition to our favorite fondue recipes. You must be patient with the caramel though. It took us at least double the time that the recipe gave to reduce the caramel after we added the cream. It should resemble the kind of caramel used for making caramel apples.

I made this recipe with very little experience in caramel preparation, I found the instructions very helpful. This recipe was a hit at my dinner party. Very light, well received after a full dinner and people can keep coming back to aerve themselves later.

My sauce also turned out thin and not as dark as I thought it would be. It was still very good and I will make it again.

It was tasty, but the consistency was thin. Perhaps I didn't reduce it long enough, but I followed the recipe instructions, so ????? It was a nice change of pace for a holiday dessert and was generally liked.

We love this one...and it is so easy to make. Our kids are 4 and 5 years old. It is one of their favorite desserts. We dip strawberries, raspberries, bananas, pineapple, and apples. Great!

So good you should double the recipe automatically. Can be spooned over poached pears or vanilla ice cream (or both!) for a lovely sit-down dessert.

This fondue was delicious and easy to make. An additional item that was good to dip in it was pound cake.
