I just made this using the peaches from the peaches in my Vermont yard. (Who knew peaches grow in Vermont?) As others haver suggested, I used butter instead of shortening, and added a dash of cinnamon and vanilla to the fruit. My fruit was VERY juicy, so I drained before baking, and used the excess liquid to make a peach sauce for the ice cream that accompanies this dish. If I had childhood memories of peach cobbler, this would definitely be the recipe.

I have been looking for a cobbler recipe that reminds me of me of the one my mom used to make. The topping on this cobbler hits that mark, dense yet light. I added a 1/4 cup of bourbon and cinnamon to the nectarines and browned in iron skillet with butter. Then placed topping on and put skillet in oven. served with Vanilla Ice Cream

I made a half recipe, and damn, was it ever good! It went together quickly, even though I didn't use my food processor. It smelled AMAZING during baking, and tasted wonderful. Definitely making this one again, but might throw in some blueberries or raspberries, just for a little extra color. Oh, and this was great for breakfast.

I made this for a quick dinner party. It was a hit. I didn't have buttermilk so I used whipping cream. I added a bit of vanilla for flavor and used raw sugar on top. Everyone wants the recipe and my oldest son had 3 helpings. It was easy and good!

I kept hearing such good things about this recipe, so I guess my expectations were too high. It was good, but not fabulous compared to other summertime fruit desserts.

Halved the recipe, but used 2.5 lbs of nectarines (unpeeled). Made in a 8x8 glass pan, nine "mounds" on top, with turbinado sugar on the "mounds".. perfect! I usually don't like very sweet things, and the filling is very sweet, but the "biscuits" balance it out a bit.. and they are so yummy! It was beautiful in color as well.. will definitely be making again.

I substituted apricots on this and it was delicious. It's perfect for people who don't like things "too sweet", like myself. I served it with homemade vanilla bean ice cream.

Delicious! Used nectarines, peaches & blueberries. Added cinnamon & nutmeg to the topping [as suggested by other reviewers]. Brought it to a dinner party & everyone raved about it!

If you use the White Nectarines there is no need for any sugar, they have the best flavor !!

I have made this recipe every summer since it was published. I can't wait every year to have a picnic or barbecue to bring it to. Everyone raves about it and it is very easy to make. I think I will add cinnamon and maybe blackberries this time as other reviews suggested.

A winner - and so easy! My company was quite impressed. Make sure your nectarines are ripe - preferably not too hard. The riper, the more succulent the dessert.

very good recipe, however, a bit too much sugar for my tastes. I would reduce sugar in half or perhaps skip it alltogether to bring out the natural sweet and slightly acidic peach flavour.

This was tasty, but my husband and I both prefer a pie dough type of topping for the cobbler. This was a little too much dough.

This cobbler is very good. The topping didn't form a "batter," so I just spread it in cobbler fashion across the top, but it did just fine. I like this cobbler, but if you like ginger, try the nectarine and berry cobbler with ginger biscuit topping -- to die for!

I made this earlier in the summer with nectarines and liked it so much, I thought I would try it with peaches. Just as good with peaches, I added a little cinnamon, nutmeg and brown sugar to filling. I also skipped the shortening and replaced with butter.

This recipe was great both times that we have made it! Even if the nectarines are sour, cooking them helps. Although if sour enough, they will stay that way even after cooking but I didn't find that it took anything away from the yummy topping or cobbler as a whole. Both times we have served it with vanilla ice cream and it has been VERY good. We'll deffinitely have it again!

GREAT recipe for summer picnic

Excellent! The crust on this is really superb, just dense enough. I added blackberries and a bit of cinnamon and it was fabulous.

This WAS really reasy to make and very tasty too. I cut the recipe in half to cook in an 8 x 8 pan which worked very well. I even made a mistake and it turned out well (I used too much butter - forgot to reduce that by half along with the other ingredients)! Like someone else mentioned, I used all butter, no shortening in the batter and it was fine.

I made this for my parents and it turned out quite well. I exchanged heavy cream for buttermilk and added some brown sugar to the filling. Also, sprinkling cinnamon sugar on top adds to the golden brown crust. I complimented the nectarines with a half cup of blueberries and they added color and flavor. Delicious!

This was a great way to use up the nectarines we get from our tree and extremely easy. My husband was wowed, and it only took me 20 minutes to put together. A real winner.

Great cobbler recipe...also added fresh blueberries, did not use shortening---just butter, and served with vanilla icecream. This one's a keeper.

This dish was easy and SCRUMPTIOUS! Slicing the nectarines into random pieces made preparation super-quick.

Wonderful. I made this with strawberries and peaches. The house smelled so nice while the cobbler was baking. Nice with french vanilla ice cream.

I have been making this cobbler every summer since the recipe came out in the magazine. I bring it to parties and it's gone in minutes. People expect peaches when they take a bite and then they are pleasantly surprised!!!

I made this recipe last weekend... I thought it took a little longer for it to bake as the topping was just slightly doughy in the middle but got a little too brown on top. My guests loved it.. I made it earlier in the day and re-heaed it slightly in the oven as we were finishing our meal. I served it with vanilla bean ice cream! It was good!

This recipe was a great hit with my guests. It received rave reviews based on the aroma alone, before they licked the pan clean! I added cinnamon for a little extra flair and some peach brandy which I happened to have on hand. Next time I might vary the topping -- I'm thinking a crunchy pecan topping would be wonderful as well. Definitely a permanent addition to my recipe file.

I made this recipe on Father's day and everyone thought it was delicious!! Dad says it's a keeper. So I will definitely make this one again.

This dessert was the first dish to go at my Christmas party. I used 50% more fruit by adding apricots as well. This dish was also incredibly easy to put together. Overall, I rate it a 10!

A perfect cobbler. I substituted nectarine eau de vie for the lemon juice, and used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar on the nectarines. Easy to make with spectacular results. My guests licked the baking dish clean!

This is a lovely cobbler, I particularily liked the sweet buscuit topping.

This really is incredibly delicious. I added some cinnamon to the nectarines and sprinkled some toasted almonds on top. While cooking it makes your home smell great and it was simple to make. Make it now while nectarines are in season.

This is an exquisite recipe, friends lick the pan.
