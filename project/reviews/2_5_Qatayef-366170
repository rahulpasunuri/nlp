Excellent Qatayef recipe. As a Palestinian Muslim, Epicurious has prepared me for Ramadan. I was so excited to find this.

I'm a Muslim Israeli woman that loves to cook and this recipe, on the surface, comes close ... but it looks to be more of a watered-down version for Americans. Well, good luck, guys, but for a real version of this cake, come over to our restaurant inside Damascus Gate in Jerusalem.
