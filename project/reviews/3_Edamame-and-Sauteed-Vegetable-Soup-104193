This is a delicious weeknight soup. I used canned stewed tomatoes instead of fresh, and added them with the broth.

So, so good. I add tofu when pureeing; it makes the broth look kinda funny but taste even better and richer. You definitely need more than 6 cups of broth, I ended up using about 9. Also, I would give the edamame more time than suggested (up to 10 min) if you use the frozen kind.

Very,very nice soup. I would make it again in larger amounts because every drop was gone!I really loved this and it was a meal in itself. The kids didn't really go for it, but they weren't feeling great anyway. I'll try them on it again.

Delicious, easy to make, and good for you! I have already made it several times, and will continue to do to.

This recipe is incredible! Sauteing the vegetables to a deep brown makes the flavors much more intense than other methods. This just might convert people who think they dislike vegetables.
