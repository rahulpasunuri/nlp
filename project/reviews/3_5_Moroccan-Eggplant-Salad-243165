Didn't care for the texture - like cumin flavor eggplant babyfood.

This salad is quite wonderful. I followed the other comments and roasted the eggplant and onion in the oven for 30 minutes rather than doing it on the stovetop. I also used ground cumin and didn't toast it beforehand. I served it with pita chips, which added a nice crunch. I think the best part about the salad is its flexibility. It's good hot, warm or cold and as an entree or side dish. I also think that it could be served on top of crostini.

Had tons of eggplant and decided to try this recipe. Superdelicious, light and healthy. Followed everyone's advise and roasted the onions with the eggplant. Followed the recipe as is. Very easy. Makes a wonderful summer salad.

I followed some of the reviewers and roasted the eggplant and onions in the oven on 400 for about 30 minutes. I also omitted the sugar simply because I was out. And I subbed ground cumin, but still toasted it in a dry skillet, per the recipe. Fantastic! You can't go wrong with this EASY, delicious dish.

Made this for lunch - could not have been more pleased. Had lots of lemon on hand so decided to use that instead of red wine vinegar. Also did not use any sugar& Totally awesome and a KEEPER recipe - will make again as a side dish - any season!

Nice recipe. However, why add the sugar? Try it without. That is the way we make it in Morocco. Sweet doesn't always mean delicious. ;) Crushed garlic and crushed roasted tomatoes add a lot of flavor to this dish.

Yes! As I was dealing with the mushy, roasted zucchini, I wanted to hate this dish. And as I thought about all the crazy delicious soy-based japanese dishes that originally sold me on eggplant, I wondered why I was even bothering. But it was truly delicious, a lovely summer side. I will keep this recipe.

Can't wait to try this. For those who find the raw onion overpowering, I would try marinating the onion in the dressing for a while before combining everything.

I love eggplant, but was a little skeptical as the ingredient list was short and what about garlic? The rave reviews gave me courage. I kept the ingredients the same, but baked the whole eggplant in the oven instead. Make sure you pierce the skin in several spots. When the eggplant is soft and losing it's shape it is done. While cutting the peeled and roasted eggplant into chunks, I was still skeptical. The dressing was way too simple. The end result was utterly fantastic! Even my husband who is choosey about eating eggplant dishes raved about it! So simple to make, and I can see charring the whole eggplant it on the grill when it is too hot to cook inside. Such a simple and delicious dish to prepare. If you buy an eggplant spur of the moment, you are likely to have all of the ingredients to put this together already. This is my idea of "fast food".

Of necessity, I took a short cut yesterday and used 1 tsp of ground cumin instead of toasting the cumin seeds. My husband and I noticed absolutely no difference in taste. Best to let the flavors marry overnight before serving. Fabulous recipe for eggplant lovers. B.J. Harrick

Quadrupled the recipe for a party of 20 guests and still no leftovers, everyone loved it! B.J. Harrick

Easy, quick, and absolutely delicious, our guests raved about this simple but tasty dish. Actually, I should have doubled the eggplant to 2 or 3 lbs., there were no leftovers. Should be made a day ahead so the flavors can marry. B.J. Harrick

I blacked the eggplant on the bbq - easier than on the stove. This gets even better the second day. Excellent side dish or appetizer.

I like this but I suspect the my eggplant-averse family and friends will not. It is pretty much eggplant with cumin and a light vinaigrette. Like many of the reviewers, I roasted the eggplant after cutting it up rather than putting it whole in a pan. I also tossed the onions in with eggplant after I turned off the heat to soften the onion flavor.

This was an awesome recipe, I didn't use a full pound of eggplant, and the sauce was great, so I'd probably make extra sauce with the eggplant next time.

point for epicurious: this is THE easiest way to cook eggplant ever discovered. instead of being a pile of mush, it retains its shape and tastes delicious. option to add pine nuts, garlic, or your particular bliss.

I loved this. Easy to make and satisfying, yet light. I halved an eggplant and roasted it for 25 mins in the oven, stuck the onions into the oven too for a few minutes to roast them slightly, and subbed apple cider vinegar for sherry. I served it with couscous and a small dish of labneh (both dishes sprinkled with chopped cilantro).

Loved this dish! Very light but extremely flavorful. I roasted the eggplant halved in the oven for about 35min at 400 deg and it came out perfect. I would double the portions next time though because its definitely not enough for 4 people even as an appetizer.

I loved this. I wish it made more, because I brought it as my lunch for two days. I found the onion a bit overpowering, but that may just be my taste. Very flavorful, and gave me an excuse to use my new mortar and pestal.

Yummy, but I would roast the eggplant in the oven or on the grill next time. When I took it out of the cast-iron pan, the outer layer was perfect but the inside was still nearly raw! I quickly halved it, peeled it, put some oil in the pan, and cooked the halves flat side down over medium heat, covered, for another 10 minutes or so--then it was perfect. The seeds didn't bother us at all, but I agree it would be extra-delicious with Japanese eggplant.

Japanese eggplant worked really well in this recipe. Instead of putting it in the oven for 20 or thirty minutes, I turned the stove on high and roasted it over an open flame. That takes about ten minutes. If you wrap it up with some foil and let it steam, it makes peeling easier. I would have added a tiny bit more salt and a little more cumin. Great with pita bread and yogurt sauce.

This is good, but a bit more vinegar and some chopped mint made it better.

good, but would roast stove top first and then under broiler until rather soft to be sure that it is cooked through.

We found this phenomenal as part of our tapas dinner last weekend. That hint of sugar really makes it addictive. I had no trouble with a "regular" eggplant that weighed in at just the right wt. called for. We used toasted pita chips, but baguette discs would be great, too. Tasted just as good if not better the second day--let it come to room temperature. A unique and memorable appetizer.

I would make this again--using Japanese eggplant, or else with regular eggplant roasted in the oven instead of in a skillet. It was hard to get the inside of the eggplant soft enough, and in the process I wrecked the well-seasoned surface of my cast- iron pan. That's what I get for not following my instincts . . . and for not wanting to heat up the oven on a hot day.

We all loved this! The roasted cumin really makes it special. It is a simple yet different eggplant salad. I used regular eggplant but the seeds weren't an issue as a previous reviewer noted.. We served it cold for dinner guests and they just called to ask for the recipe.

This was very tasty but I would use Japanese or Chinese eggplant next time; the overabundance of seeds in the big eggplant made the texture unpleasant. Also - this needs to be eaten right away. Leftovers are terrible cold, and don't regain the best consistency if warmed, especially the seeds. But flavors were very good and prep was easy; would make again with modification.

Came out really well
