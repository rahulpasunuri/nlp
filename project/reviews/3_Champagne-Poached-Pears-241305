These were delicious. I used larger pears, so I sliced them into quarters before poaching. I did not add the rosewater. I followed another reviewer's suggestion to reduce the liquid to syrup. For serving I drizzled the syrup on plates, topped with 3 quarters of a pear in a fan placement, put a large spoonful of sugared, sliced strawberries at the base of the pears (which worked well because the champagne had strawberry undertones), and then put a dollop of lightly sweetened whipped cream on the side. It was a fantastic dessert that me and all my guests loved, and I still have about a cup and a half of leftover syrup to drizzle over vanilla ice cream when the urge hits. I will definitely be making this again!!!

Sorry to give this one fork when I haven't even tried it but, I'm a tad confused.... I enlarged the picture to see what was in the lower left corner and, as I thought --- empty tea bag envelopes. Upon further inspection I see that the liquid in the large bowl of pears is lighter in color than the smaller bowls. Hhhmmm... was this recipe supposed to include some form of tea infusion??? Not a bad idea, I think the tea is worth a try!!!

I didin't like this dessert at all. There was way too much liquid for the pears and it was all much too sweet. I made this thinking it would be a healthier/lighter dessert but it was just sticky. I would not make this dessert again.

This is a very good base for a poached pear recipe. I think the following tips and modifications took it to four forks. 1. Use a small melon baller to remove the seeds and middle core. 2. Add a cinnamon stick to the poaching liquid. 3. The pears will cook unevenly and will brown in areas that are exposed to the air and don't remain in contact with the vapors of the poaching liquid. To avoid this, cut a circle of parchment paper to fit the poaching pan and cut a small hole in the middle to allow steam to escape. Place this over the pears while cooking uncovered. 4. After cooling the pears in the cooking liquid remove the pears and place in shallow baking dish with enough of the poaching liquid so that they continue to soak up the flavors (about 1/3 of the liquid). Reheat the remaining 2/3 liquid in the poaching poan and simmer over medium-low heat until reduced to a runny syrup consistency. Serve the pears in a pool of this syrup. 5.To really take it up a notch, take some mascarpone cheese and thin it a little bit with heavy cream. Sweeten to taste with powdered sugar and then pipe the mixture through a pastry bag into the cored hollows of the pears. Delicious!

I loved this, and pears are not my favorite fruit. I did hold adding the rosewater until after the poaching process was complete, to get a more pronounced flavor. Also followed another reviewer's lead and filled the center with a mix of drained full fat yogurt, cream cheese a little honey & vanilla-YUM!

This is definitely a great recipe. I've made these before and they came out wonderful. Another great thing to do with these is to core the pears, and stuff them with either marscapone or cream cheese, DELICIOUS!

We really enjoyed this desert. We made the recipe larger because we had to serve five people. Followed the recipe, including the rose water which added a wonderful aroma and nuance to the dish. Recommend cutting into smaller than whole pear servings.
