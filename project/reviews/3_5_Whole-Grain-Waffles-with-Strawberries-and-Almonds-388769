These are the tastiest waffles I've ever made. I substituted some of the rolled oats with some oat bran, just cause I wanted to use the oat bran up. I didn't substitute 1 for 1 though, more like 1 to 2, bran to oats, and that ratio seemed to be about perfect. I doubled the flax seed, just to make them healthier. Cooked them in a belgian waffle iron. They are so good you really don't need much maple syrup. I plan to make these a lot, even though they are a bit fussy to mix up. Don't skip any of the toppings.

These were very tasty. I was out of whole wheat flour so I substituted rye flour and they had a nice complex flavour - much better than white flour waffles. Next time I think I will add a little vanilla extract.

I made this recipe exactly as written. Excellent flavor, the banana really makes it yummy. I had a problem with the waffles sticking, it wasn't just the first one but all of the waffles. Not sure what happened...

I've made nearly every waffle recipe at epicurious and I must say that Crispy Waffles with Salted Carmel is our favorite treat by far. However, we have committed to eating healthier. Under "healthy eating" this recipe wins the day for taste and texture.
