Okay, would the previous reviewer explain how an oven comes into play in this recipe? This is a great bang for buck nibbley for parties. Especially if you've made a dessert that only requires yolks. Just make sure you use *good* parmesan that's been freshly grated (who even buys those green Kraft tubes anymore???)

Generally, I like Parmesan cheese, but I thought these were far too cheesy tasting. I would not make these again.

My puffs came out like nachos. I don't think it's the baking temperature since I use a separate thermometer inside the oven to measure heat.

To the cook in Singapore: the trick to any recipe using parmegiano cheese is to use FRESH parmegiano and not the stuff in the can. Also, the cheese from the center of the original roll is always more flavorful than the cheese close to the rind. Basically, the stuff they put in the can is only from the rind.

Delicious and so easy -- but the amount given barely whets the appetite. Better start off with double!

What a fun hors d'ourvre! These disappeared quickly, with people looking for more. Very easy to make also. This will be made again and again.

I must have done something wrong....These were just aweful- no flavor whatsoever- just tasteless puff. Maybe the cheese wasnt right; maybe the oil not hot enough. I tossed out the whole batch before my guests arrived! Anyone have any ideas what could have gone wrong?

I had these at a friend's party last week, and they were delicious!
