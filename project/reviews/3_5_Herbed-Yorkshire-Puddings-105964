very easy, tasty--like others i used my own herb mix, and i agree to be v. careful about only using drippings (clear fat) when making these. v. good though!

Just OK. Growing up in the UK and having "Puddies" almost every Sunday I know how good they can be. These didn't rise well and were gooey in the middle. Find another recipe!

oops I said I used only one egg in my comment below but really I use two.

I love this recipe but have to admit I only use one extra large egg which makes it less eggy in taste. When heating the drippings (only the oily part of the drippings), I heat them just until they start to smoke (not for the fixed amount of 8 minutes) which ensures I don't set off the smoke alarm. The muffin tins and fat should be so hot that when you pour the batter in (2/3 full) it sizzles.

Very heavy, next time I will make popovers. Did not like the texture, and I would not make this again.

FYI - Yorkshire puddings are not a dessert. They are not supposed to have a "custard" taste. They go along with a roast dinner, meat, veggies and gravy! Traditional English dinner has Yorkshire Puddings.

Sounded better than they actually tasted. Watch the cooking time, as they burn easily when you use pan drippings.

These were nice, but a little on the eggy side. I think puddings should be a bit more custardy. These tasted mostly like eggs. Nice to do in this "mini" fashion, but I'd try to find a better recipe.

Searching for a simple recipe for Yorkshire Pudding. Can;t believe all the silly stuff people put into them! Please keep herbs out of the recipe for a traditional Yorkshire... herbs go on the prime rib, not the pudding.

Wow. These were super easy, and everyone loved them! I melted butter in the muffin tins for about four minutes, and there were no issues with burning or smoking. I cooked the puddings for about 10 minutes, but was watching them carefully - nine minutes probably would have done it.

Great recipe. I honestly didn't know what to do with them except put them on a plate but they were great and easy.

These were very good.. perfect pairing with the Prime Rib with Madeira Sauce recipe. Make sure to watch them, they were done within 8 minutes and had I left them in any longer, they'd have burnt... of course I was using a relatives ancient electric stove so maybe the temp was wonky.

One of the best Yorkshire Pudding recipes I've tried. You can make it as is, which is yummy, or leave out the herbs (or make your own combo)and it's just as good. Great with the Herbed Rib Roast on this sight. Five forks!

It was really good but I trashed the oven!

I would make this again, but without the herbs - they floated to the top (see the picture) and taste somewhat grassy. I followed some tips from my mom and they came out perfectly - beat several minutes longer than the recipe calls for (they won't be as egg-y) and if you don't have drippings, use butter. Yum.

We made this dish with the prime rib recipe and Madeira wine sauce for a holiday party. The "puddings" went over very well as evidenced by the fact that guests were politely fighting over the last one. I followed others advice and only left the fat drippings in the oven for 3 minutes which resulted in minimal smoking. We actually only made 12 "puddings" because our muffin pan had only 12 slots so we did have wasted batter.

I made this with the Prime Rib on Christmas eve and both were fantastic. I agree that you have to be careful when preheating the pans. Also if you are very careful about separating the fat and roast drippings (i.e. putting only fat in the pans), fewer burned, charcoal-y bits will form in the bottom.

Loved this recipe, like everyone else I didn't have any beef fat so I substituted with olive oil and I didn't have any problems with it smoking. Forgot to sift the flour but it still turned out great. Just wish it didn't cool down so quickly. Goes very well with the Madeira Wine Sauce on this website.

i used the sunkend center . i put my thumb in the middle and filled them (after baking )with a combind sweet potatoe and a mushroom sauce that i made,and placed it in the center. my family and friends love this.

While this recipe requires very minimal work, it doesn't yield a great bread. It tastes very eggy and all of the herbs float to the top of each roll.

Loved this recipe!! I don't generally have something so odd as beef fat lying around so used olive oil. They came out beautifully. I couldn't believe how easy the recipe is. With the exception of the olive oil, I didn't make any other substitutions and it came out great. Slight smoking but not enough to set off the hyper sensitive smoke detectors.

Delicious, easy, and a perfect accompaniment to prime rib.

These were easy -- I had none of the trouble described by others. Followed the recipe and found it quick, simple and delicious.

Despite the preceeding rave reviews, this didn't work very well. Maybe it was the non-stick muffin pan, but after heating the oven to 450' and getting the pan really hot, and then placing 1 tsp. of juice & fat into the trays and replacing in the oven, in less than 1 min. smoke was billowing from the oven and the juices were burnt carbon in the bottom of the pans. This despite the fact that at 450' my oven is actually at 400'. I redid the process but cut down the juice-cooking time to 1 minute, then poured in the pudding mix and cooked for 10-12 mins. Even them I wasn't impressed. lastly with some left over pudding mix, I substituted olive oil for drippings and used "texas" muffin tins. To me this gave a better shaped and sixed yorkshire pudding.

These were wonderful. The herbs were a nice addition. Cooked them for our Christmas dinner with prime rib roast. Grandma loved them! Only problem was, I didn't make enough.

I made this with the roast Christmas Day I did not make enough for my guests. I could have doubled this recipe. Everyone at my table loved it, but I frequently make Yorkshire pudding to have with beef roasts.

I have been making a simplified version of this recipe for years- it is a family staple with prime rib, and this recipe can be made easier than listed. You can use butter instead of the fat drippings and you do not have to let the mixture stand for any length of time before cooking it. The butter (or fat) in the muffin tins only needs to melt before you add the yorkshire pudding mixture, it doesn't need to start burning or anything. Also- be careful when checking on them in the oven- they're like a cake- if you slam the oven door or jar the muffin tins, the puddings will fall.

This recipe did not work well for me. The puddings never rose very high and deflated to an unattractive shape. Flavor was good, but presentation was awful. I am at a higher altitude, so maybe that had something to do with it. Also, I at first put in just the pan drippings without the fat but that made for a weird-colored pudding that stuck to the pan badly. The next batch I made, I used the fatty portion of the drippings plus a little juice. That worked better.

You can't imagine my happiness at not being the only one whose apartment oven was belching out smoke amidst family arriving and the roast being carved and plated for dinner. Since my tenderloin roast yielded zero drippings, I substituted a half teaspoon of butter in each cup--my mother's advice from a Briton's perspective was to either use a teaspoon of beef broth only for these, or if you insist upon a fat base, slip in a few drops of olive oil or butter with the broth. Despite the smoke, these came out quite wonderfully. Very creamy consistency and delicious herb flavor that compliment red meat beautifully. I'll make them again, and next time hopefully avoid a Smokey The Bear lecture.

Served this with the prime rib recipe, the Yukon Gratin potatoes and super spinach salad for our Christmas dinner. These were easy to make and excellent. Everyone loved them, even the grandchildren. Only problem was trying to convince my husband that I didn't need paper muffin cups for these. Told him this was a 4-forker and I knew what I was doing.....lots of laughs over that!.

These were delightful! And so easy. I didn't have beef drippings on hand, so I made half with bacon fat and the other half with olive oil. (Neither set off the smoke alarm.) Actually preferred the olive oil, as it was less greasy. If only they didn't cool off so quickly! Definitely eat at least one the second it comes out of the oven.

Don't make these as written! Like the cook from New Providence, I set off the smoke alarm while following this recipe and heating the fat for eight minutes. I am a bit less tolerant of such dangerously bad testing and editing of recipes, particularly when the resultant smoke and sirens disrupt Christmas dinner. Just for kicks, I looked up another recipe for individual yorkshire puddings on this site and found that it called for heating the fat for 3 minutes, not the 8 called for in this recipe. That would have been much better, and it is what I will do if I decide to try again.

They were easy and delicious! The fresh herbs were a wonderful addition to a Yorkshire pudding. I will make these again the next time I serve a Roast Beef!

Had to make these as it was part of the English Menu. We just couldn't see how it could work, but work it did and they were well liked. It was our first attempt at Yorkshire Puddings and the 17 people at our Christmas dinner ate them up. It is wonderful to try things and have them work out.

I trotted this recipe out for Christmas dinner along with Roast Beef. These puddings caused a lot of commotion! The ovensmoke from heating the drippings in the tins set my security/fire alarm off. While I was trying to time the rest of the baking and carve the roast beef, I had the police at the door and the security company ringing me on the phone trying to walk me through disarming the siren. No harm done. The puddings were a hit. One English guest said they tasted like her Grandmother's. But next year, I'm sticking to Popovers.

These were a little more custardy than most popovers, but they were very savory with all the herbs!!!
