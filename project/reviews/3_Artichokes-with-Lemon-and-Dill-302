We liked it, but it took too much work to prepare the artichokes and the sauce. I say skip the artichoke prep. Cut out the stem, trim the leaves, rub some lemon, and steam them. Make the sauce and use it as a dipping sauce. The simpler the better. Otherwise, it'll take you 45 minutes to have this on your table...who needs that for a side dish?

I've been preparing this recipe for many years. I just use more lemon juice and less water. If you wish to ad a notch, prepare an egg sauce (avgolemono). If you need the recipe for the sauce contact me

This low fat recipe is a staple in my repertoire and my family loves it. It's imporant not to overcook the artichokes. I never have any trouble thickening the sauce. The artichokes are better warm than at room temp, and I often make enough to reheat in the microwave with the next night's dinner.

these were tasty, but they weren't great. after cooling off, the artichokes seems to get really soft. I tried to make the thickened sauce to pour over the 'chokes, but the sauce never thickened. I ended up just leaving the sauce on the side and having people use it as a dipping sauce if they were so inclined (most people weren't). Overall, I prefer my 'chokes steamed with just a little bit of butter to dip them 'em.
