A good recipe when the weather is so hot you don't feel like cooking. I roasted the shrimp in a 450-degree oven for 6 minutes, shell on. The tablespoon of mustard seems like a lot, but remember that cold inhibits flavor. I thought a tablespoon was just right to give this soup some bite.

Excellent! Always good and a pitcher of this in the refrigerator is a go-to for a quick lunch. Great! I like to add different herbs, say dill, taragon or chives to vary. You will get a lot more flavor if you cook your own shell-on shrimp. The fat under the shell gives the "shrimpy" taste. More work but worth it. The precooked shrimp - ok in a pinch, but no flavor at all! The chilling time is essential to bring out the flavor. This is one of those things that gets better the longer it sits.

Excellent! Served this in plastic cups for a picnic.

use 3/4 tablespoon mustard instead of 1. Tasty and refreshing

OK but a bit bland. I used 3/4 tsp. mustard which was to my taste. Used frozen shrimp, maybe fresh and cooked would have been better in the flavour department. Decorates nicely.

This is an utterly delicious soup and couldn't be easier. The English mustard is essentail else the soup will be very bland. In fact, I added even more than the recipe required. One of my guests was allergic to shellfish, so I served his soup without the shrimp and even this way it was delicious. A wonderful discovery!

Very tastey and refreshing. I waqs cautious with the mustard because of other reviews, but found that I ended up adding almost as much as called for.

So easy to prepare and really tasty. Halved the mustard amount and it worked out fine. Recommend and will serve again!

I only have one thing to say about this recipe... WAY TOO MUCH MUSTARD!!! I prepared it as written, and it was probably the worst recipe I've ever tried from Epicurious. I suggest to anyone trying this for the first time to only use 1 tsp. mustard; 1 Tbsp. is way too much!!

A very good soup, but I think next time I will cut back on the mustard a bit. I found that it became the major flavor. This is a good base for spin off recipes.

This soup was quite good. It seemed to be missing some depth of flavor that I can't quite pinpoint. I'll have to experiment there because it is quick, easy, and very good. I think with very little altering it would definitely be a four forker.

sounds horrible doesn't it, but this is one of the best cold soup recipes i've come across...very refreshing and it garnishes beautifully with the addition of coursely chopped shrimp, whole chives and a chive flower. I am a caterer and my clients all rave about this when it is served.
