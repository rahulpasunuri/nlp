This was a great little appetizer, we ate them over a glass of crisp white wine and it was perfect for valentines day...

These were easy and tasty. I made the cream the night before and I think it needed the time for the flavors to combine well. I served it on black pepper water crackers.

This did not make very much so I doubled the recipe. seemed like it needed a little something so I mashed some capers and added them

I loved it. Even my non-foodie girlfriend said it was an explosion of different flavors. I toasted the baguette slices first to give them some crunch and not be so doughy. This is a very tasty and very easy to make pre-dinner treat, we even ate ours while we cooked the main course.

I thought the sauce was a little bland so I added a bit more lemon juice and dijon mustard which I thought would pair nicely w/ the salmon - I served overe pumpernickel mini-slices of bread! Yummy otherwise!

I believe this recipe is incorrect otherwise you never use the lemon and use the butter twice.

Yummy appetizer! The crispy shallots seriously make the dish, but caution: do NOT overcook the shallots. If you let them turn dark brown, they'll be very bitter.
