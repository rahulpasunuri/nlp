I'm drooling just thinking about this. I've made it twice and thought "never again!" - as it takes a big chunk of the day to make and has an absurd amount of egg yolks combined with whole milk and cream. But time heals everything and I sense another day in the kitchen coming soon!

I made this for Easter dinner and it was absolutely fantastic. Yes, it takes some prep time and planning but it is so worth it! Even after a wonderful lamb dinner everyone was passing the bowl around and wanted seconds and thirds. I followed the recipe exactly, used the light sherry, whipped cream and fresh rhubarb. Just divine. No problems.

If you've never made a trifle, bear in mind that it's basically soggy cake...but don't be daunted, it's delicious and worth the effort. I'd skip the fino sherry syrup. The cake has plenty of moisture from the custard. And the sweet/tart flavor combination of cake and rhubarb is electrifing and needs nothing more. When using frozen rhubarb you'll only need to roast it for 10 min. Don't let any juice evaporate as I did. Once the rhubarb is pureed it is weird looking. But, just mash it through a colander and it's wonderful. I'd flavor the whipped cream with vanilla instead of sherry. The presentation was impressive!

Made this for Easter desert to rave reviews from all my family ranging in age from 8 to 81! My husband had three huge servings! Best tasting and easiest to make of all the trifles I've made - LOVED IT!!

Pistachio and Rhubarb is a good colour combo. It is also good with cranberries

I added a splash of rose water when making the rhubarb. It's a good addition. The custard is not too runny. I also made a pistachio brittle and crumble some of it to sprinkle on top like some golden sprinkles.
