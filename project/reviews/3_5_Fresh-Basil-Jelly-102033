I expected something special but didn't care for this. If you make the jelly don't press on the solids when you strain out the leaves; doing so makes the jelly cloudy.

This is a great substitute for mint jelly. I make it during the holidays for gifts to friends.

I have used this recipe for a number of years, having first found it in Food and Wine magazine. I had lost it, and it is a pleasure to re-discover it! The version I have used included rice vinegar and omitted the green coloring. It is very good with a simple yogurt cheese on a wheat cracker, garnished with fresh cracked pepper as an appetizer! Enjoy!

I was thrilled with the wonderful flavor and the good consistency of the jelly. I never made jelly before, and this was so easy! I served cold chicken with basil jelly and my guests decided it should be basil jelly with chicken on the side. They loved it!
