Followed the recipe to a tee and to my surprise it actually came out perfectly and will archive this as one of my favorite sauce. It goes great with chicken, potato and veggies. Thumbs up for this one.

This is the first recipe I've used from Epicurious that I absolutely detested. The word "YUCK" describes my rating and I followed the recipe exactly. Definitely won't be using this one again!

My husband LOVES honey-mustard sauce, however, up until I met this recipe, I had NOT been a fan. But I found this recipe edible to say the least! My husband was thrilled with it and now thinks previous honey-mustard sauces pale in comparison. We had it with simple baked chicken breasts and roast veggies. (I didn't have clam juice, so just used some chicken stock instead and it was still great...will definitely make this one again!)

We doubled the recipe and had it with apple and raisin stuffed pork chops. It came out great. We all enjoyed, it even passed the ten year old daughter test! The remaining sauce went just as well over ham steaks for breakfast the next morning. I think next time we'll try a stronger mustard.
