these cookies are awesome, but because i can't leave any recipe alone i tweaked them a bit. first i skipped the chocolate, mostly because all of my other cookies have plenty. i added orange zest, fresh squeezed juice from said orange, and some cinnamon. i also tend to double the recipe which comes out just fine. love 'em.

these came out perfectly flat, buttery, and crisp. I agree with a previous reviewer; I almost didn't want to put the chocolate on them! I just used semi-sweet, and they came out great. Definitely going to make a full batch!

These are AMAZING! Not bland at all...they are fragile, but that's what makes them so beautiful. They are now part of my holiday cookie must have selection.

these were easy to make,but a little bland. Next time I will try adding some orange zest

Cookies were good but were very greasy even after when set and very fragile. Granted, I made these along with my all time favorite Christmas cookies which can not be beat. I would make again as a garnish for creme brulee or ice cream.

I really like this cookie:) I made the 1st tray on a silpat and the batter turned into one big cookie which will be cut into pieces, the 2nd tray I used parchment paper and the form of the batter was alittle better but the cookies were more crisp. I baked this for 10 min and I used Ghirardelli bittersweet because I had no white chocolate. I will make these again because everyone in the house likes them.Good and easy to make:)

Darn good cookies. I was looking for an eggless cookie recipe because I was out of eggs, so this worked out nicely. I used 1/2 c. shredded unsweetened coconut and it was really good! I made two batches at once: one on a silpat and one on parchment paper. The silpat cookies came out a nice uniform thickness and brownnwss, while the parchment papaer cookies didn't spread as big, browned darker around the edges, and were raised in the middle. Best to stick with the silpat. Had some right after aking and again the next morning, and they become nice and chewy after sitting a bit :o)

These are great - especially right after they cool down. I tasted them and i didn't even want to put the chocolate on them they tasted good as they were! Maybe next time i'll try the chocolate on a few. Definitely use A TEASPOON measure. These spread out ALOT.

We loved them--won't wait for Christmas 2009 to make again!

These are delicious and elegant... and very easy! I made them when I was visiting family on Christmas Day and they were a big hit. The neighbors stopped over and together we almost polished off the entire recipe. I made them again for a New Year's gathering when I was back in SF and I used organic unsweetened coconut and toasted whole oats from my local market and I think they were even better...not as sweet and with a nuttier flavor. I would recommend Callebaut white and bittersweet chocolate for drizzling. It firms up quickly, and I agree with the readers who just drizzled the chocolate with a fork or spoon... no need to use a piping bag. They keep well, so they would make a nice holiday gift or favor to give guests to take home after a dinner party.

I'm not a baker but had to bring 2 dozen for a cookie exchange at work. These looked so elegant and delicious! The first batch did spread to a 6 inch size - HUGE! Far too big so I made smaller ones. These were delicious but I found the butter made them a kind of greasy which for me took away from the elegance of them.

I was a little worried about this recipe after reading the reviews, but the cookies sounded so good I gave it a try. I followed the recipe pretty exactly, though I did use rounded scoops of the coconut, oats and flour. The cookies didn't spread too much, and they cooked beautifully in 8 minutes. I don't like white chocolate and was trying to save a few bucks, so I just used milk chocolate chips melted down to decorate. The result was fantastic! I can't wait to share these with my family.

These were really yummy, but they definitely spread. My first batch turned out enormous (not that enormous cookies are a bad thing), so I made much smaller mounds. Then we had fun dunking the cookies in chocolate rather than drizzling. I was thinking these might be good to make big and turn into cannoli-shaped shells, and fill with something delicious.

Very easy, and quite good. These taste a bit more like candy than they do a cookie given the butter and brown sugar. I substituted whole wheat flour for white flour and they came out very well.

Wow, these cookies spread a lot in the oven. The were very delicate. The recipe didn't say to chop up the oats, so I used Kmart whole (rolled) oats. Perhaps using quick or chopped (in the processor) oats would have made the cookies a little more sturdy. I had to flatten the tops of some of my cookies in the oven since they looked like flying saucers. These cookies were very easy.

These cookies are easy to prepare. They certainly do spread! I only got 24 cookies out of the batch. Chocolate is nice, but I agree with previous reviewers...do not worry about the piping bag. I used a spatula and simply flicked the chocolate over the cookies on the cooling rack and it worked out well. Tasty, easy. Watch baking time. For me they were close to being overdone at 8 mins.

For the amount of effort it takes to make these cookies, they are fabulous! I followed the recipe and had great results. The batter was buttery, but I'm pretty sure that's how it is meant to be. It really didn't need any extra flour or oats. I would stick to the 1 tsp suggestion. My first few cookies were rather large and not as evenly browned as the smaller ones. I didn't bother with the bag and just used a spoon to drizzle my chocolate. That was a really fun part! I also didn't have the special baking mat, so I just used aluminum foil greased with some vegetable oil. They are quite decadent and would make a nice gift or addition to your christmas cookied rotation!

Very good cookie. I was 1/4 cup shy on oats so I added 1/8th of a cup each of flour and coconut. I got the full yield out of the recipe and was able to bake 16 to a sheet (sticking to 1 tsp. per cookie). Used some PAM on the cookie sheet (which in retrospect is probably entirely unncessary given the butter content of the cookie). Baked some longer than others and found that we liked them when they had gone about 9-10 minutes (nice and brown on edges). I didn't bother with the sealed plastic bag to pipe on the chocolate. Instead, melted it, dipped a fork with skinny tines in the chocolate and drizzled it over the cookies that way. Worked like a charm! The only annoying part was waiting for the chocolate to set (but that's probably because my freezer's tiny and cumbersome!) Next time, I might also add just a hint of vanilla for a little more aroma. Overall, nice recipe.

These were great and VERY simple. Unlike the other reviewers, my batter was a fine consistency without any additions. I would agree, stick with one tsp mounds- they really do spread out! In the end, they're buttery and oat-y and crispy and delicious!

I set out to bake all the cookies in Gourmet's Dec. issue, and so far I've made 4, including this one (the others are Chocolate Hazelnut Cookies,Almond Brown Sugar Cookies, and Orange Pistachio Crescents). I thought this looked sort of blah, but they were amazing, chewy AND crunchy! I also had to add more oatmeal and coconut. Then you flatten them out a little bit on the cookie sheets. They spread a little bit. For dessert after dinner I brought out a large platter with all four cookie sorts, and my guest cleaned these off the plate in no time. So, now I have to make another batch. Make that two batches...

Good but not great. Easy to make. The batter was so buttery I had to add flour, oats and coconut (approx 1-2 tbsp of each). They definitely spread quite a bit so do make room on your cookie sheet and keep it to a tsp of batter. I got about 25 cookies (not 36).
