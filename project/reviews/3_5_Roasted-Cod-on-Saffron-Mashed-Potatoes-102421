I have made this three times now and finally got it exactly right the last time as it is very easy to overcook the fish while holding it. This makes a lovely presentation and got rave reviews from the family. I added granulated garlic and 2 tablespoons of butter to the potatoes and dissolved the saffron in 1/4 cup of the warmed cream before adding it to the spuds. I then substituted 1% milk for the remaining cream. I have made this with cod and with haddock. This last time I put the fish in a 300 degree oven for just 5 minutes which was perfect. I used cilantro, tarragon, arugula, and parsley for my herb salad and the entire dish was wonderful. Definitely destined to become a regular in our house.

This recipe was really good although I used other herbs instead of saffron in the mashed potatoes because I wasn't about to shell out $20 for a little pinch of the stuff. If you're cheap like me, try dill, basil and thyme in the potatoes.

The recipe is fine as is, save for a few personal preferences. Using the review area to issue your own recipe is not as interesting as you might think.

I would suggest making this with Saffron-Corn Mashed Potatoes (another recipe on this site)which should take care of the "something missing" that another reviewer mentioned - this is great with the saffron-corn potatoes!

This dish was good, presented beautifully, and was easy to make. I only gave it 2 forks because the potatoes tasted as if they were missing something -- exactly what I'm not sure. I think next time I might try a few tablespoons of butter and some salt. I also think a few drizzles of a reduction (like balsamic) would enhance the presentation and the flavor.

Simple, contemporary and delicious! We used cod fish and tarragon and basil for the herbs... great combo! I suggest cutting the saffron in half so that you don't overpower the dish with saffron flavor; the herbs already make this dish fresh and interesting. A winner in our house and an easy dish to prepare for dinner guests.

I made it with the cod. Suffice it to say we really enjoyed the potatoes! Might try it again with sea bass. Cod with s&p just doesn't stand on it's own.

This is definitely better with sea bass than cod. My dirty little secret is that I was in a hurry, so I just soaked some saffron in warm chicken broth and added it to instant mashed potatoes. It's such a nice presentation, for "just family" this worked fine.

i made this with sea bass also - mor expensive but it came out just great. With the golden color of the potatoes and the tartness of the greens, it was a nice presentation and flavor overall.

I seemed to have come out with a very different outcome than the previous reviewer. We didn't care for this dish at all! My version (with cod) was SO bland.

This recipe received RAVE reviews from my boyfriend. Was so simple to make, yet tasted and presented like a dish from a top restaurant. My grocery store ran out of cod, by results with sea bass were divine.
