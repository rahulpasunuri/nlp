Why not just call it 'Low Country Boil for Yankees'?

Fennel just doesn't work here. Not with lobster. Substitute celery or omit. Otherwise, this is not an earthshaking recipe. Seen many versions before. But lobster and corn are always delicious.

For goodness sake...this is supposed to be a recipe review...who cares about protocol? I'd like to see what people thought about THE RECIPE...not what they thought of someone else's review...and I'm just as guilty and childish for even writing this.

To Cook on 9/5, who cares if Gabrielle or anyone else types in ALL CAPS? You must not have much on your plate to be annoyed by that. Good grief, get a life!!!! And to Gabrielle, if you are more comfortable typing in all caps, by all means do so and don't let the bullies get to you. And to Manhattan, you made my day. I love your sense of humor! :)

You just don't get it, Cook From NYC. Rules, guidelines, protocol - whatever you want to call it - is essential in any organized society. Just imagine the world without it.

In all fairness to Gabrielle, perhaps she doesn't know that typing in all caps is considered "shouting" in the cyberworld. It took me a while to learn that bit of etiquette, so let's give her the benefit of the doubt.

I also agree with Ken about the crawfish. Gabrielle - Way over on the left of the keyboard is a button marked Caps Lock. Push it. And then tear it off.

I HEAR YOU KEN!! SUBTRACT THE MUSSELS AND CRAW FISH WORK OR NICE FRESH CLAMS MAYBE. BUT I DID GET HUNGRY AFTER READING THAT ONE..

Leave out the mussels and add about 20 to 25 lbs of live crawfish to the veggie pot and you have a pretty nice Cajun style boiled crawfush dinner for 6 non-Cajuns. If you expect Cajun guests, then add 30 lbs of crawfish.

Old Bay Seasoning is a classic crab-boil or clam-bake seasoning mix from Maryland (see: http://www.mccormick.com/productdetail.cfm?ID=6216 ) Scroll down to the end of the page and there's a list of ingredients.

We're piggies! Scaled down the recipe and used clams instead of mussels (we're from NE)and like you, used only one pot. And we each had a whole lobster! The blu cheese slaw was awwwwwwwwesome!

Scaled this down for my husband and I. Absolutely divine. We too left out the sausage and we put two live lobsters into the pot along with claims instead of mussels. No need for a separate pot for the lobsters. Throw everything in the same pot! Didnt' make the herb mayonnaise. Just had lots of lemon wedges and bowls of melted butter. A real feast!

I've now made it twice without the sausage -- both times it turned out great. Easy, impressive and yummy
