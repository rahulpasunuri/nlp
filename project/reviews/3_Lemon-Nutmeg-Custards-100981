Though this recipe was tasty, I wasn't as impressed with it as other readers. I have other lemon desserts that I would choose over this one.

Tuscaloosa - my money's on the blender - it probably whipped too much air into the custard, which would result in sponginess if you put them straight into the oven instead of letting them sit for a while.

This was delicious and very easy.

We loved the flavor of the custard, but the texture was a bit odd-more spongy than silky. I'm not sure if that's because I used half-and-half instead of cream, because I used a blender to mix it, or because the water bath wasn't high enough. Any ideas?

Prepared this dessert for our restaurant and it was a success. It's perfect as a palette cleanser after dinner, but enough richness to feel like you're being pampered. Our chef said it was very easy to prepare. The only problem was keeping the staff from sneaking one of these desserts for themselves!
