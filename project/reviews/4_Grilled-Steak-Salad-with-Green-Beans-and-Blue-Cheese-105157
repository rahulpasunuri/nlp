This is a really yummy recipe! It is perfect when you want a light dinner. I used Romaine lettuce with just a little Arugula, in addition to Feta cheese. Also, I used the Balsamic Vinaigrette recipe from this website - Epicurious March 2003. This dressing has a high rating, since 100% of the 42 reviewers would make it again. Last night, I used the vinaigrette with spinach, dried cherries, candied pecans and sliced pears. Yum!

YUM! So easy and delicious and lasted me for 3 days. I substituted green olives that were brined because I didn't want to cut pitted kalamatas. Will definitely make again.

Excellent recipe. Two criticisms: 1. 4 minutes per side will overdue steaks unless they are very thick. Recipe calls for "8 to 9 ounce New York steaks". These would be medium rare in no more than 2 1/2 to 3 min per side. 2. "Yield" comment says "open a bottle of Cabernet" and Wine Parings tab suggests Sauvigon Blanc. Which is it? The whites don't work for me in this; Pinot Noir does. Since I'm eating it and Epicurious is confused, I'll go with my choice.

A winner. Only when I'm feeling spendy and I buy the steak from the farmer's market and get really good cheese. Impressive and easy for guests.

This is simple and delicious. I adjusted the recipe for 2 with leftovers. I added a ts of dijon, and a pinch of sugar to the dressing and used white balsamic. Tossed the blue cheese with the salad which made it creamy. Served the steak with caramelized onions, peppers, garlic, and mushrooms, so my husband could make a steak sandwich.

Making this in the winter misses the point--this salad needs your freshest local tomatoes and green beans in season. Use your best oil and vinegar, season, then toss the salad gently first with oil, and then with vinegar added a little at a time until it tastes just right. I put in a small amount of crumbled blue cheese with the leaves: as you toss, it dissolves in the oil and coats the salad. Perfect as is, but a little snipped tarragon and marinated red onions aren't out of place. Best enjoyed with a nice cab.

The success of this recipe is really dependent on the quality of ingredients. Simplicity is beautiful so spring for the high- quality ingredients on this one...buy the olives fresh from an olive bar, use your "fancy" olive oil. Kosher salt and crushed black peppercorns on the NY strip steaks, that's all you need. I used crumbled gorgonzola and added roasted red pepper strips. This was a huge hit w/ a large group of friends I had over for dinner. Easy to prepare.

Had a leftover grilled boneless ribeye from the weekend's bbq. This was a perfect way to make another tasty dinner. Nice balance of flavors. Used oil cured olives and liked the saltiness with the simply dressed salad.

We've made this quite a few times now and it is always delicious! Really impressive for how quick and easy it is to prepare. It makes quite a large quantity though, would definitely serve about 8.

My family loved this. We've used tri-tip as well as dry salami. Both received rave reviews. Most recently we transformed this into a delicious pasta salad using tri-colored spiral pasta instead of greens. Delicious combination.

great, easy, flavorful. one of my go-to choices from now on.

Great tasting meal, first time around. It probably doesn't matter what kind of tomatoes you use...I used vine-ripened ones on hand. The steak, green beans, and blue cheese are the stars of this easy dish.

Excellent. I am making it tonight (again) myself and came onto the site for the specific purpose of saving it to my recipe box.

I am going to make this salad tonight, based on the reviews offered by people who actually followed the recipe. To the cook from NM, if you don't have any of the ingredients and don't read the recipe, how can you expect it to come out good?

I made 1/3 of this recipe to serve 2. It was a serious waste of a nice N.Y. strip steak. I marinated it for a couple of hours in a combo of Newmans Light Balsamic Vinaigrette and Kraft Light Red Wine Vinaigrette. Had to use the fresh green beans that I could get, and green olives (stuffed with pimento) instead of unavailable Kalamatas. Used the same combo of dressings on the total salad. This was the WORST Epicurious recipe I have ever made. The steak was good, but that was the only thing good about the meal. Surprised that this is a recipe from Epi that I will NOT make again.

Delicious. I marinate the steak in some of the vinaigrette and add thyme. I also replace the blue cheese with either feta or goat's cheese. This is definitely my favorite easy dinner salad recipe.

I made this for a Ladies Luncheon- it was very popular. Serves 10.

This was just okay for me... nothing to write home about. I was really surprised that the "dressing" they suggested is just balsamic and olive oil. If I'm going to go all out and make a salad with steak and blue cheese, I want a proper dressing. I made my usual balsamic vinaigrette by adding garlic, dijon, salt, pepper, dried thyme and a pinch of sugar. Even with the bolder dressing I wasn't as impressed with this salad as I expected to be, considering I really like all the ingredients. If you're going to make it, don't be afraid to use your imagination a bit - maybe marinate the steak in something tasty.

I served this on a hot day on glass salad dishes that I have put in the freezer for an hour or so. Really pretty, easy and delicious. I made it as written, but it's really just a starting point.

Rating: 4
Fabulous! And so easy. Use haricots verts, the French beans-- they have much more taste than the standard variety. Also, I think that 10-12 minutes is too long of a cooking time. In order to hold up to the steak, they should still be crunchy. For once, I didn't want to add anything else to it... well maybe a bit of fresh basil...

Wonderful, flavorful, memorable!

Excellent! Used leftover steak , mixed greens and Danish Blue Cheese in oil (always in the fridge). Tripled the dressing, added fresh herbs and let the vegetables (plus sliced red onion) marinate for an hour. Needed something yellow for presentation - yellow pepper, yellow cherry tomatoes?

What a great salad. I used left over prime rib from Christmas dinner and gorgonzola and it turned out wonderful. My husband and son gave it BIG raves. This is a keeper.

Rating: 2
I don't know what all the raves are about. This was a fairly mundane steak salad recipe that anyone could put together (probably better) without half a thought. I made it as written, but do think the steak itself needs marinating badly. The lack of any herbs and other flavorings in the vinaigrette is mind-boggling. Thank goodness for the blue cheese. Without it, this would be bland, bland, bland.

A perfect dinner. Easy to prepare ahead and perfect for a summer night. Loved by everyone.

Made this for a picnic before the Bear Valley Music Festival. Even my kids liked it! Used spring greens and gorgonzola since that's what was in the frig. Didn't have any kalamata olives in the pantry. It was great, inspite of the substitutions. 12 yr old wanted it for dinner again that night!

This was fabulous! All my guests loved it and I'll definitely be making this over and over. I took another reviewers advice and marinated the steak in Paul Newman's Balsamic Dressing, and I used the same dressing (not the leftover marinade) for the dressing on the salad as well. I used filets as suggested, and they were superb (even if they were more well done than I prefer). Also, I used mesclun instead of arugula. What a keeper!

This recipe was/is wonderful! I used tenderloin's and marinated them in Paul Newman's Italian Dressing for a few hours before throwing them on the grill! Once one the grill, I used a little Montreal Steak Seasoning - it was DELISH!!

You have to try this salad! Use PREMIUM quality meat, and grill it outside. I used black angus strip meat and grilled it for the suggested 4 minutes per side and it was exactly the right state of doneness (med rare). I will serve this salad at my all male Board of Directors lunch this month as it has a decidedly Masculin je ne sais quoi.

This is wonderful and so quick and easy to make. It's a wonderful treat mid-week. I followed the recipe almost exactly. I used haricot verts and substituted roqueforte for the blue cheese. I also doubled the amount of balsamic for the dressing. It was also so delicious. We will make this again (and again).

I have been making this recipe since it first appeared in Bon Appetit. It is hands down my wife's favorite dish. I use a nice Australian or New York strip steak. I season the steak with a Montreal steak seasoning. Easy and delicious!

Someone suggested that you make this with filet mignon. I made it with plain filet of tenderloin, and it was superb. I also usled gorgonzola. Wouldn't add or subtract anything else.

Filet mignon is definitely the way to go here! Very hearty and healthy at the same time. Fresh baked crusty bread is a great accompaniment.

This dish allows me to feel like I am eating healthier and fulfills my craving for red meat. Flavors go great together. Its even worthy of uncorking a special bottle of red wine you have been saving for that great meal.

This was a wonderful salad, I had it for lunch, but with the addition of the reccomended bread and wine, or soup, this would be a great dinner as well, Use good blue cheese, maytag or other, and not frozen green beans...

Delicious. Made it for a dinner party and barely had a bowl big enough for the tossing of the salad. This seems like an extremely forgiving recipe in its quantities. I look forward to making it again.

This recipe was refreshing and filling. It tasted light, elegant and satisfied like a main course. My husband and I like it so much that we are making it for friends this weekend.
