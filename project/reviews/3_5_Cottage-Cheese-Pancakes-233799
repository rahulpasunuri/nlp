First batch, following the recipe, not so great. Sloppy, mushy, burnt, etc. Final batch, low heat, longer cooking time, lots more wheat flour, bit more salt, doubled the onions, olive oil in the pan instead of butter, topped with sauteed onions, tomatoes and baby bell peppers....so good I keep thinking about them the next day. Next time, I will try it without any butter. It doesn't seem necessary actually. SO GOOD!

Wow. So yummy. I'm not into sweet things for breakfast, so these are a great alternative for those who like savory things. They are creamy in the middle and crispy on the outisde, the textures balance well.

Omitted the pepper and onions, added a dash of sugar, and served with apple butter...to die for! I have a six and two year old, even they loved them. I only had low fat cottage cheese and they were still supper creamy.

Very good, very quick, wholesome and made with items you probably already have. I agree with others who said that equipment matters - using a teflon pan is kinda key to the right texture and good flipping. (I tried both my well seasoned iron skillet and my calphalon pan, and calphalon won [which it NEVER does!]). For fat in the pan, i used olive oil (i did use butter in the batter, but felt that the extra butter was just, well, excessive). So with regard to flavor, i made an addition or two: i added a dash of chipotle chili powder and 1/4 c chopped fresh italian parsley. very good recipe, nice seasoning, good comfort food.

These were yummy! I went the sweet route per the below reviewer, followed the rest of recipe but TOTALLY forgot to add the butter. They were still great. I used a big cast-iron skillet on medium heat, buttered the pan between batches and had no trouble flipping. I did make the pancakes fairly small as suggested. Served with home-made blueberry syrup. Yum!

Very good, but I would have cooked them longer as I like crispy pancakes. We used a butter substitute also.

I don't know why they don't call these Cottage Cheese Blini. They were terrific with caviar.

These are fantastic! I made them smaller, with a mixture of onions and shallots, as appetizers for a picnic, and they disappeared quickly. I mixed the rest of ingredients in my KitchenAid, using the paddle, then added the onion mixture and blended a little more. They did not stick to my steel skillet. I think you can experiment by adding diced fennel or fresh herbs as well.

BEWARE! The proper tools count! I gave this recipe one fork because it has promise. If you don't have non- stick cookware, like me, you may also have a Sunday morning disaster. (I don't use non-stick cookware due to the well-publicized health risks.) I tried this recipe and (1) learned that the pancakes must be small - even less than 3" in diameter and (2)the pan must be very hot and lots of butter is needed. I used the posted suggestion of making a sweet pancake by substituting the 3 tbsp of sugar for the onion. I included cinnamon and nutmeg. I made several pancakes, using a small aaute pan. The only pancake that looked like a pancake was not up to my standards. It browned nicely in its butter bath and was good in taste. However, the texture did not taste or look "cooked". After pondering how to fix the mess, I gave up and threw the rest of the batter out. Tf you also do not use non-stick or "Teflon-type" cookware and you feel adventuresome with a old-fashioned cast-iron griddle, this could be a worthwhile recipe for experimentation.

These were really great savory pancakes, with a fairly pronounced onion flavor. I used 2% fat cottage cheese for this recipe and found that it was rich enough what with all the other fat. I liked these pancakes a lot. Cutting the recipe down to 1/3 of its size made for a nice amount for two people. Served with maple veggie sausage, this made a great breakfast.

Luxury! so unique and delicious! I omitted the onion and added 3 Tbsp of brown sugar and 1/2 - 1 tsp of lemon rind. Amazing!

This is one of those recipes that makes you wonder how such a small number of simple, relatively inexpensive ingredients can combine into something so delicious! Yum, yum, yum! I also used less butter the second time around, and they were just as good if not better.

I made these without the onions (and with less butter) and my kids LOVED them. I added about 1/2 tsp sugar. They were delicious!

I used twice the chopped onion, only 5 tablespoons of butter, and 1% cottage cheese. Pureed all in my food processor for a smooth batter. I loved these for their mellow, savory flavor and delicate texture. Topped with a bit of sour cream, my sister and I both agreed they remimded us of the cheese blintzes we grew up eating. Delicious! I'd make these for company anytime! And they're pretty low carb, too.

i've never heard of anything like these but they were really good! the flavor reminded me of a quiche and the crispiness was especially nice.

I omitted the onion, because I wanted sweet pancakes. I halved the recipe, added 1.5 TB of brown sugar and it made 4 medium-ish sized pancakes. Delicious!

I love this. But cornmeal substituted for flour adds crispness--enough that you can decrease the butter, if you like.

HAVE MADE THIS TWICE. VERY TASTY. SERVED WITH SMOKED SALMON, SOUR CREAM AND CAVIAR. USED A BLINI. WONDERFUL.

I wasn't sure how this was going to turn out, judging by the batter. I cooked them on a griddle and didn't let the first ones cook long enough. After that it was a snap and the result was filling and delicious. Somehow the cottage cheese seems to melt.

I would have never guessed, by looking at the ingredients, that this would be so tasty. Now I have to go buy more cottage cheese.

Fabulous and a real treat. Made these for a breakfast for about 20 people doubled it and they couldn't get enough.
