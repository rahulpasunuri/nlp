Had this for a small dinner party---people raved. Basil very subtle but adds a unique taste. Flavors were delicious together--added strawberries, blue berries, raspberries and blackberries. Definitely a repeat!! Highly recommended if you like a fruit dessert and be sure to pick a good vanilla ice cream!!!

Awesome, easy and delicious! I did not add the oil and pepper and it was great. I chose Lemon Basil in place of sweet basil then served it over homemade vanilla bean ice cream. Even the kids enjoyed the contrasting tastes. This is a perfect dessert for a dinner party because it is all made ahead of time!

This was delicious! I chose to make this recipe because it was unusual to use olive oil and pepper on a fruit dessert. I'm not sure that it actually added anything to the overall taste, and will try it without next time. Nevertheless, the gazpacho was a wonderful treat.
