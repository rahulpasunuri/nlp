Super easy and very tasty! Did not taste doughy to me. Side of ketchup recommended

This had a doughy texture to it, not very appealing.

I have made this a couple of times for brunches. It is easy and everyone loves it.

This was a great addition to our Sunday brunch, and very easy to make! I encourage all to add a bit of butter before each new batch, otherwise the cakes don't brown up as pretty.
