I've made this recipe several times. Unlike the other reviwers, I happen to like it! I've served it as an accompaniment to pork roast instead of apple sauce, and those whom I've served the "chutney" liked it. As for the appearance, I say that rhubarb always has a less than appetizing appearance when cooked. And, as one who loves full-flavored and even very spicy foods, to me, it isn't bland at all. I substitute Splenda for the sugar because I can't have the sugar in my diet.

The flavor was so-so and the color/texture were appalling. Chutneys should be have lots of texture and vivid colors. This looked like bad pea soup.

Pretty disappointing and bland tasting. Not nearly spicy enough! Will try adding some zip to it, Eg. fresh ginger
