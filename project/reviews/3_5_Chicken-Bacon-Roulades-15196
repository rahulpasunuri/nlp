For a very experiences entertainer/foodie, I was disappointed...perhaps my standards are always too high. There are better recipes out there.

I have made this a few time and it's fantastic! I use red onion, my favorite. A definite must is using sherry instead of white wine, way more flavor. This one's a keeper!!!

This an elegant mix of flavors. We tend to be 'fat' concious so rarly use bacon etc., this is a good reason to use some. The end sauce and the slices are wonderful.

First of all, this was not hard to make like so many reviewers claimed. Not sure what constitutes a lot of prep time, but this certainly did not. I never use lemon pepper, but bought it for this. Now I know why i don't use it. What a horrible taste! It wrecked the entire meal. My husband, who has been a good sport and eaten everything I've made and tries every adventurous thing on menus, spit this chicken out on his plate!! It seemed like it would be nice - all the roulades I've made in the past have been good, but this was just not appealing. It smelled like sweaty socks and had that nasty lemon pepper. If you want a lemony pepper flavor, why not use fresh ground pepper and fresh lemons? The sauce was really good, but the chicken - a waste of ingredients - good bacon, $12/lb parmesean cheese, etc. YUCK!

I thought this dish was quite easy, even pounding the chicken breasts, and it was very tasty. The sauce was delish! Even my picky 11 year old really liked it.

I made this recipe as directed, and I found it to be very good and much more interesting than most of the chicken dishes I prepare on a regular basis. The prep was a bit more involved and time consuming than I expected, and the sauce required more work than I think it actually warrants. In the future, I will follow another reviewer's idea to use the "inside" mixture as a stuffing. It may have been the shape/size of my chicken breasts, but they did not slice attractively for presentation and I left them whole to serve.

I rated already but forgot to mention that I did not use the cream in the recipe and instead added 1/4 cup extra broth. The sauce was delicious this way and cut down on fat.

To quote my husband after I made this the first time: "Sensational!" This wonderful tasting recipe does take a bit of time to make and put together, but the great thing is it can be made early in the day (or maybe even the day before) and still taste terrific. I prepare everything ahead of time, including the browning, baking, and sauce-making. Then I refrigerate all and when ready to serve reheat the sauce, slice the chicken, add it to the sauce to warm it up, then serve as directed. I always serve it with mashed potatoes, and wonder what others use to pair it with. Also, I don't change a thing in the recipe, it is so good as is.

I thought this was absolutely delicious. Unlike some other cooks, I didn't find it particularly time consuming or difficult -- have your butcher do the chicken pounding. Elegant but not fussy, this dish is equally suitable for a dinner party or a quiet dinner at home when yyou feel like giving your family something unexpected.

My husband and I loved this recipe. I used a thick turkey bacon which gave wonderful flavor and also held together well inside the chicken. The gravy was fabulous. This is a keeper! r oa

Made this recipe last night, instead of chicken breasts used boned thighs. Also, rather than securing them with a toothpick, I wrapped them in several thin slices of bacon. My wife loved them.

The flavors in this dish were good, but it was an awful lot of fiddling for "good". I was hoping for wow and didn't get it. The only change I made was to chop the bacon up into a filling with the scallions and parmesan -- I thought I had watched my bacon very carefully, but it was too crispy to roll up.

I changed this to a stir fry. I diced the bacon and cut up the chiken into bite sized pieces and added some shitake mushrooms. Served it over egg noodles. Delicious!!

I was very disappointed after the wonderful reviews. I thought it was time consuming to make and not at all worth the effort.

Very tasty. Very easy. Can be made ahead and heated just before dinner. To reduce fat & calories, substitute fat free evaporated milk for the cream & use olive oil instead of butter. But I would only do this for health reasons, the dish is delectable as is!

My husband and I loved this dish. I've made it twice in two weeks, trying it out for an upcoming dinner party. The second time I used Parma Prosciutto in place of the bacon. It was much easier to work with the thin sheets rather than strips of bacon. The sauce was lighter without losing any flavor. I added a handful of chopped fresh basil as a garnish. Next time I think I will add some toasted pine nuts as well. Bon Appetit.

These were so good! They were relatively easy to make and I got the hang of the rolling them up after the first one. The presentation was gorgeous and they came out perfectly! I didn't get the chance to make the sauce, but they tasted amazing anyway. They were incredibly flavorful and juicy and impressed all my friends and even myself! I will definitely make these again, especially if I want to impress guests with a beautiful presentation coupled with delicious taste!

Recipe came out perfectly. Slicing the roulades into cross-sections and displaying on a large platter made an artistic presentation. The sauce tasted very flavorful, probably because of the left over bacon fat in the pan. Used low fat bacon and fat free 1/2 and 1/2.

Fabulous and lends itself to great presentation for dinner parties. Also, Atkins friendly (w/o the flour) so if you follow the diet you can still enjoy this flavorful dish with your guests.

This dish was amazing! I had chicken and bacon I wanted to use up, but also wanted to make a really special meal. This was it. Takes some time to make, but for a night when you want a great meal and are willing to put in the work....here it is!

Excellent chicken dish! I used less bacon and more cheese this time around. The sauce is fantistic as well as the flavors of the shallots and bacon. This is the best recipe I have found on this website so far.

Great! I only used 8 slices of bacon, and I added 2-3 more Tbs. of Parmesan. Served with rice pilaf and steamed broccoli. We will definitely make this one again.

This was a great presentation for a chicken dish. I served it at a dinner party and it went over really well. I added basil to the gravy based on other suggestions and thought it turned out well. I served the chicken over polenta which also tasted good with the gravy. I served sauteed zucchini as a side. Definitely make ahead and allow time to do so - it took me a while to prepare but it's worth the effort!

This dish is excellent! Especially if you are on the Atkins diet. You really do not need flour to thicken the sauce, just add cream to the wine garlic butter mix... fabulous!

Haven't tryed this yet but it looks wonderful. Just a question for anyone out there. Because it is so rich does anyone think that evaporated skim milk would work? I've used it before with other recipes but I'd like an opinion. Thanks!

Wow - what a change from 'California Cuisine' - the bacon... the cream... this dish qualifies as one of the four basic food groups! Be forewarned, however, that this is not "fast food", but it is perfect if your guests don't mind pitching in to help with the cooking!

This is a delicious recipe. My husband loved it! I sent the mere 2 pieces we had left with my husband to work and everyone there thought it was leftover from a dinner out. The only change I made was to add pepper to the sauce. It is a plain tasting sauce, but there is so much flavor in the roulade b/c of the bacon that it compliments it well. Yummy!

When I first read this recipe, I thought it would be quite heavy (because of the cream, but was pleasantly surprised when it was light and very tasty! I've made this several times and have always received rave reviews.

I made this dish for a baby shower luncheon. Everybody went crazy over it!!!! It was really easy, too. I made the chicken and the sauce the night before (I secured the chicken with string instead of toothpicks, and I added about 1 cup of sauted mushrooms to the sauce). Then about an hour before the shower, I put the chicken back in the oven to heat, put the sauce on the stove to heat, then sliced the chicken, layed the slices out on a heated tray, poured the warm sauce over the chicken, and set it on my buffet table. Not only was it delicous, but it was easy to prepare at the last minute and the presentation was great. I'll definetly make this dish again!!!!!

This dish is wonderful! The flavor is excellent. I did have trouble rolling the roulades. Next time I make it, I would like to try using kitchen twine to secure the roulades instead of wooden picks. I think they might stay more tightly rolled together.

Excellent recipe, as is; no tinkering neccessary with this one. One caution--it is SO rich. Next time I'll use just one large chicken breast for both my husband and me. The "gravey' is wonderful over garlic mashed potatoes! Preparation is a little time-consuming, but if you are entertaining, this dish lends itself to early-prep-and-reheat just fine--the chicken just gets more tender after simmering in the sauce.

I would make this again with changes. This version is very bland. Add one half cup of Madiera wine in place of the white wine plus extra garlic and cracked black peppers to taste. Let the sauce cool to room temperature and then gently reheat to bring out the flavors.

We all loved this recipe and I will definitely do it for company. as someone else suggested the chicken can be prepared, sauce made leaving 5 min saute time and 20 min baking. I added a few whole basil leaves to the sauce and it was very flavorful. otherwise I wouldn't change a thing.

ALTHOUGH TIME CONSUMING, THE EFFORT WELL WORTH IT!SUBSTITUTED ROMANO AND INCREASED THE GARLIC TO 4 CLOVES. PRESENTATION IS A MUST! OTHERWISE LOOKS LIKE A BURITO ON A PLATE! THE LEFTOVERS MICROWAVED WELL. THE SAUCE IS TO DIE FOR.

This dish was very easy to prepare. The sauce was somewhat bland, so I'd suggest adding some fresh herbs like basil to liven it up, if that's what you'd prefer. Great for dinner parties, the chicken can be prepared in advance and left in the refrigerator until cooking is required - sauce may be prepared in advance and gently reheated. I didn't bother slicing the roulade before serving - too fussy - and the guests didn't seem to care!
