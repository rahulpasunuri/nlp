Unlike other reviewers, I followed this recipe pretty closely and I have to say it was "just okay." I was looking for a vegan stew recipe that was just a little out of the ordinary. Perhaps I should have chopped up the olives more or cooked the zucchini more. The potato pancakes were kinda ... chewy. I would have prefer something more latke-like.

A true family favorite. I serve over broad egg noodles, leave out the olives, add baby peas, a little extra cumin and sour salt instead of the orange. Great for lunch the next day too!

Nice combination of flavors and texture! I added extra garlic, cut back on the cumin a wee bit and threw in some frozen corn at the end. I kept the pancakes thin and fried them in a small amount of vegetable oil until they were crispy. Truly an unexpected flavor from the orange zest and olives, with a nice little kick! A great hearty and satisfying meal.

Very nice vegetable stew. I love this recipe. The only changes I made where omit the Olives, add carrots and broccoli and added a slice of cheese on top of the potatoes. Melted and was yummy with the stew on top of the pancake.

I was a little wary of the combination of cumin and kalamata olives...I was really close to just leaving the olives out. I'm so glad I didn't! It was definitely different, in a good way. I used my own recipe for the potato pancakes, but the stew was delicious on them.

This was sooo good, I wish we had doubled the recipe! We were both excited to finish off the leftovers for lunch the next day and the stew was even better after a day. The flavor combination of the orange, cumin and kalamata olives is surprisingly bright and satisfying while the crispy potatoes are the perfect accompaniment. It's a new comfort food in this house.

I love this, especially the second or third day. I double it up, but add extra garlic and go half and half with squash (green and yellow) and cauliflower (add this a few minutes before the squash). For the beans, I do one can bird brains and one can black beans.

Stew was great. I added two teaspoons of balsamic vinegar to give it more of a kick. I added 2 eggs to the pancakes - I was afraid they wouldn't stay together without the eggs, as I forgot to grate the potato (I just chopped it finely). Anyway, they turned out great in the end, though I will remember to grate the potato next time.

I didn't bother with the pancakes. For the stew I used the Pictsweet seasoned vegetables that I had on hand. I also added some chopped eggplant. The orange added a nice flavor. I also added more cumin and cayenne. I also increased the olives. I will probably add raisins as suggested below The flavors blended very well after a day or two. I served over rice.

New Years night, we have a 10 month old little girl, our first child. I figure since its New Years, and I've had a few days off, I should make something fun for dinner. It took longer than usual at the giant supermarket and i got home around 6. That left an hour and 15 minutes because we eat, as a family, at 7:15. I followed the recipe to the T, except I left out the kalamatas (wifey no likey) and the red pepper flakes (baby). I added a handful of green beans and two chopped carrots. The potatoes were pretty straightforward, i enjoy the squeezing them part. It got down to the wire, I was at 7pm and still needing at least 20 and the baby was crying and the wife was complaining and I only made 1/2 of the potatoes, so we only got one plate. We sat down with bruised emotions and took a bite and got over ourselves! Very delicious.

New Mexicans: Green chile is delicious in this. I also added a carrot, used northern beans rather than chickpeas, used more cumin, and finished with cilantro. Very tasty...

Delicious! As one reviewer suggested, I add golden raisins and saffron and the dish turned out even better! I served it over plain couscous prepared with chicken stock and water. Next time, I would probably use more cumin in the stew.

I've made this twice now and this time I too added smoked gouda to the potato pancakes. I also omitted the olives in the stew. This is one of my favorite recipes. The orange gives a fresh flavor to the stew. Good Grubbin'!!

Great recipe for a chilly fall evening. I added some smoked gouda to the potato pancakes, and they were fantastic!

Just like a Moroccan tagine (wants 1/4 cup golden raisins and pinch of saffron). Interesting to combine it with the potato instead of couscous. Being in a hurry, I just bought a package of hash brown potatoes with onion from the refrig. section at the store and cooked them up in a skillet.

This is good...the stew is unique with the olives and orange. Contrast nicely with the potato flavor. The potato pancakes could be crispier though, instead of sagging under the moisture of the stew. Definitely heading to the kitchen right now to heat some up for dinner.

Several times guests have given me raves over this stew which I love and make fairly often. I've never made it with potato pancakes, but ladle it over herb, cheese polenta instead.

I found this dish good enough but not much more than that. The vegetable stew, while pretty nice, was not, in my opinion, the best accompaniment for the potatoes. I would serve it over rice next time, and have a nice green/mesclun salad alongside the potato pancakes. In order to keep the pancakes together, I used the French tecnique for "beignets de pommes de terre": I let the grated potatoes and onion drain in a colander for 30-45 minutes before drying them in a paper towel (the color changes from oxydation, but not the taste); I also added one beaten egg and mixed well.

I didn't have any olives so to jazz this up I added approximately 1/3 cup peanut butter just before the garbanzo stage for impromptu African peanut stew! Turned out great. I agree with the others that the pankcakes are a bit strange - more like hash brown patties.

I really liked the vegetable stew, and ended up eating it by itself the next day. It was easy to make and tasted wonderful and I'd make it again. The pancakes were difficult to make because they held together poorly. My husband and I really enjoy potato pancakes, and the texture of these pancakes was disappointing, especially with the stew ladled over them. I'd much rather make a few of the full-fat kind once in a while and really enjoy them rather than bother with these.

Tasty ! I really liked the crunchy/stewy contrast. Will definitely make it again.

Loved the orange/olive combination. I've made this dish more times than I can count and have made it significantly easier by making one giant potato pancake. I add the oil to the bowl of potato ingredients and pour the whole thing into a jelly roll pan. Then I bake till crispy and cut into squares.

I love this recipe - it hits my taste buds where it counts. On a low carb diet so I skip the potatoes and up-ed the kalamata olive and orange content. Made this for a friend and she went home to make it for herself for her boxed lunches. I recommend this to everyone. Part of my staple meals list now.

I made this with a few changes. I substituted black beans for the chick-peas and green pepper for the zucchini. I also added some ground coriander and caraway seed to the stew, and some fresh parsley to the pancakes.

Will not make again although it's quick and easy. The potato pancakes are too much hassle, time and mess for the resuls and it had a floury/gluey taste despite using less flour than asked for. The stew itself is interesting but odd with the orange zest and the overall taste of the stew is just ok. There are much better tasting veggie stews on this site.

Excellent dish. The flavor combination was amazing. I will add more olives next time - but I'm a big fan of the Kalamata. The orange zest added so much. The potato cakes were a real treat and I plan on exploring their use with other add-ins and toppings. Overall - excellent - make again . . . and again!

This took me back to dinner at my German Grandmother's home. I added carrots, left out the squash, French cut Green Beans. IT WAS GREAT.

I cooked this last night for my flatmates and it went down a storm! I substituted the zucchini (we call them corgettes here) for green beans and runner beans and added some balck eye beans and it was fantastic. Advised to add a fair amount of salt to the potato pancakes as they were a bit bland. We all slept well afterwards! A strange combination that definitely works.

I haven't tried this interesting recipe yet, but I had this type of dish in Poland more than once. Potato pankake - Hungarian Goulash - potato pancake.

The fans went wild. The crunch of the pancakes beneath the stew was splendid. I preferred less juice from the sauce. The orange zest and olives added a unique twist. I agree that a little more spice heat might be good. I used crushed pepper flakes from Chimayo which created more depth than would be found in your garden variety pepper flakes.

Its a bit like small individual swiss roesti. This recipe must be briming with fiber - would it be possible to get fiber with the nutritional information given.

A helpful hint for the cook from Toronto. If a recipe calls for dried "ground" red pepper or chiles, that would definitely be confusing. Any recipe, or cook for that matter, that I know of that mentions dried "crushed" red pepper is almost sure to be referring to the ubiquitous dried red pepper flakes of the sort you would find at your neighborhood pizza parlor. These are typically a mix of chiles, usually of the ancho variety. Hope this helps.

It's interesting that just the other day on this site i saw one of the professional writers criticize a cookbook writer for calling for "dried crushed red pepper". The various kinds of paprika, along with cayenne, are all "dried crushed red pepper" of different varieties of red pepper. I'm willing to experiment, but I can't tell from this recipe, with its somewhat odd flavour combo of orange peel, cumin and olives, what would be appropriate or tasty.
