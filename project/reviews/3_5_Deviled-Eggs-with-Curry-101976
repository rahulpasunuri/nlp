I used 1t Trader Joe's curry and pitted Kalamata olives. Oh, and Greek yogurt instead of mayo. They came out great! You need to add salt and pepper at the end to taste too. Also I sprinkled with cayenne (you could use paprika if you don't like the spicy kick) to make it look more appetizing.

I used 1.5 tsp curry with cilantro and green onions from my garden. It was pleasant enough, but really needed more... I will make these again but will use stronger flavoring. Perhaps the curry powder was old.

The recipe is a good suggestion to take a different direction with the tried and true "deviled egg." I zipped it up a bit myself, but just like any good recipe, take the information and run with it!

These were good, but not great. Next time I'd stick to tradtitional deviled eggs, but if you like variety, these are pretty easy and they do taste different.

Good recipe. Nothing special.

I thought these were fabulous, although I too skipped the olives. I did serve some mango chutney alongside and thought that was a great addition. I used curry powder from penzey's and believe the quality of the curry is a make or break. Too the cook who had a hard time peeling the eggs -- use older eggs next time. Fresh eggs are nearly impossible to peel (i have my own hens.)

Best deviled eggs I've ever eaten! I substituted chives for the parsley & skipped the olives, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly & it was terrific.

Let it be known that these deviled eggs won people's choice in the 1st annual Feasting Fox deviled egg contest held July 18, 2007 in St. Louis, MO. Just the right amount of tradition and twist. Will become a classic.

These are great! Super easy. People love to see deviled eggs at a party; I brought them to a bbq and they were gone in about 5 minutes. I used a generous teaspoon of curry for 10 eggs, and I consider it the minimum; they could have used more. I think unpitted olives would be a drag on deviled eggs, so I skipped them. Also used chives instead of green onions. Swell!

Thought these were excellent and my husband LOVED them. He can't eat mustard so the ol' family recipe for deviled eggs had to go. These are MUCH nicer.

The only think I would do next time would be to double the recipe. I followed the recipe to a "t" but left out the olives. This has a great flavor and a nice bite. I will never make regular deviled eggs again. Bring on the curry!!

I made these and a regular deviled egg recipe for Mother's Day. Both were received well, but this one was praised much more highly. I did not include the olives, and I used a combination of hot and medium curry powder. In addition, I added a medium splash of apple cider vinegar, which I think was, perhaps, a stroke of genius. My presentation left something to be desired, since I managed to mangle almost every single egg while shelling them. However, I salvaged as best as I could and scooped the mashed filling into plastic baggies, cut a small hole in one of the corners, and piped the filling into the sad, sad whites. I offered a small bowl of very, very spicy mango chutney on the side, and although my guests didn't seem to be as adventurous as I would have hoped, *I* dabbed a small amount on top of *my* eggs and found the combination lovely. I recommend this recipe highly!

Super deviled eggs! For more punch, use Madras curry & cayenne pepper instead of the usual medium curry powder if you love spicy food. I made these for Easter this year and the family loved it them!

I made these for Easter -- I like curry, but with this recipe, I found out that I don't like it in my Deviled eggs. Maybe I'm more traditional than I thought?!? I won't make them again, but these got good reviews from others.

This was a quick and easy alternative to the traditional deviled egg. I didn't have any parsley so I chopped the left over green onion tops and used those instead. The olives were a nice complement to the curry flavor. The proportions were just right to my taste. Next time I will try adding aome tabasco as suggested below.

I thought this was pretty good. I think it's a nice starting point for Deviled Eggs with Curry. Next time I'll add a little tobasco, and substitue part of the mayonaise with sour cream.

I will never make traditional deviled eggs again. I didn't measure the curry, just added to taste, and once I tasted them I decided against the olives. You don't need them. But you do need to try these.

I am sorry, but I thought this recipe was pretty bad! I love love love deviled eggs, but the curry was not a good idea. It really clashed with the olives too!

Delicious! Loved that hint of curry but also added a tablespoon of Dijon mustard. Enjoyed by all as an Easter appetizer. Will definitely make again.

These are DELICIOUS. I threw away my traditional deviled eggs recipe and will use this one from now on. I doubled the recipe and didn't follow amounts - I just kind of eyed it and tasted along the way but I do know that even with double the eggs I used less than 3/4 tsp curry. The only thing I added was a little Grey Poupon. It added a little depth to the flavor. I didn't bother with the olives but I did sprinkle a little parsely on top for presentation. Fabulous!

I made this as an appetizer at Thanksgiving - we always like to have something a little different, just to keep the conversation going. This time, it wasn't very popular, although my husband and I loved the flavor of the curry. I suppose curry is a bit of an acquired taste - will definitely make this again for a different crowd.

I don't like hard-boiled eggs, but the rest of my family does, and so I've made this twice recently for portlucks. Easy, and a huge hit both times. I haven't bothered with the olives. Doubled the recipe both times.

I always add curry to my egg salad, so it was a natural addition to deviled eggs. The flavor is subtle enough that people said "What is that flavor...? These are so GOOD!" I used some fresh chives from the garden in the mixture, but otherwise this doesn't require any doctoring (if you like curry). I think the olives would overwhelm the flavor of the eggs. Just a little sprinkle of fresh parsley and it's delicious!

I believe this is a LOVE or hate recipe. Half my crowd said "Yuck! Egg salad", the other half said, "Yum! Egg salad!". As deviled eggs go, I love this recipe - I love a dash of curry in everything. For a pretty presentation, I halved cherry tomatoes, scooped out the seeds with a small melon baller and piped the deveiled eggs into the little tomatoe cups. My husband said it looked very "Queer Eye" (from the show, not because they looked like queer eyeballs)

Simple make-ahead dish that really makes company say "wow, you worked so hard!" To make it look really professional, use a pastry bag to pipe the yolk mixture back into the egg whites in a rosette shape. One could probably substitute light mayonnaise in this recipe without sacrificing flavour, since the curry and egg are the mainstays of this dish's taste. Instead of olives, I served this with a dollop of mango chutney on the side, with excellent results. This is an easy, elegant appetizer for any occasion! Each serving = 146 cal.

Haven't tried this recipe (deviled eggs being about the only thing I don't need a recipe for), but I thought I'd pass along my mother's way of doing it-- namely, in addition to the curry powder, a bit of dry mustard powder, and maybe a small dollop (teaspoon? to start) of prepared mustard as well.

Once bitten, twice deviled!!! These eggs were perfect for fulfilling a major deviled egg craving. The seasonings were spot on and a great change from traditional deviled egg recipes. Great for picnics or just a snack for a rainy day at home with THE friends.

I made these deviled eggs for a white trash potluck thrown by some friends. Amidst the many retro casseroles and jello concoctions these seemed to hold there own. The curry is just the right trick.

The BEST deviled eggs I've ever had, and I'm someone who's had a bunch! The recipe is quite easy. I tripled it, then for a little extra moisture, added a 1/4 cup mayonnaise to the recipe requirements, and sprinkled the tiniest of cayenne pepper on top of each finished piece. The eggs are great without the parsley or the Nicois olives (which added another 20 minutes due to chopping, pitting, etc.), so I'd make the eggs with just the green onions, curry, mayonnaise and yolks for simple potlucks/block parties and save the garnishes for a cocktail party setting (where you need them to look fancier). Either way, these eggs are excellent!

Simple and perfect. Some greens splashed with balsamic vinegar (you don't need oil because of the mayo in the stuffing) set off the richness of the eggs. Ideal!

I loved this! I made it the simplest I could, leftover eggs from a dozen decorated Easter eggs, 1/2 c Light Miracle whip, 1 1/2tsp curry powder, a few dashes of salt and 10 turns of the pepper mill. Used a mixer attachment from a hand blender, and it came out creamy and wonderful!

These are delicious! I doubled the recipe, used fat free mayonnaise, substituted 2 tbspn french garlic mustard for the minced green onion and increased the curry powder to 2 tspns. I piped the filling into the egg white halves, then garnished with paprika and chopped chives. They disappeared very quickly.

This is fine, but a bit of tweaking can make it better. Maybe add some cumin, or chopped jalapeno? Maybe a little lime juice? I think it needs a little something extra, but it is easy, and with some of these changes could really be very tasty.

I tried the eggs, and it was delicious. I made different flavors by adding softened cream cheese, and also small pieces of green olives, and black olives, with a dash of cheyenne pepper and paprika, mixed in with the curry and a minute bit of pickle relish. I made different variations of the dip, some with all these ingredients, and some with just one or two, or three, try the mixed effect, for a picnic or party and they will love it, oh by the way, try some pimento also.

Fantastic and easy. I made this for my dutch relatives (seems many dutch people are fond of filled eggs) and they loved it. I didn't have black olives and substituted a dab of Tapanade (smooshed olives/oil/spices) - it was a hit. I think it is the green onions mixed into the filling gives it a bit of kick!

The filling tasted super as I was making these, but did not pipe well at all, as a result of the scallions, and hence looked less than beautiful. I don't think I'm much of a deviled egg person, but these were good (not great).
