Perfect pie for a hot summer evening. My guests raved - it was a hit!

I made the pie with a different twist. After freezing the pie overnight I added a meringue over the ice cream and baked it at 350 degrees until the meringue turned a nice golden color (about 5 minutes). I then served it with a warm rum sauce. My guests raved.

Fabulous! It was a hit and they were begging for more. Super easy and I had no problem with it freeezing in 12 hours.

The ice cream pie was OK - it was VERY sweet. However, the caramel sauce was fabulous and much easier than the traditional method of making caramel. I will definitely make the sauce again.

Great recipe...but needs to be prepared more than 12 hours in advance. Mine still wan't frozen. However, everyone still raved about it. Next time I'll make it at least 24 hours ahead.
