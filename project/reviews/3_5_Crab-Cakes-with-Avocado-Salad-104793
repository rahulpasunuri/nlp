Made this pretty much as written with the exception of the corn oil (used olive oil) and the egg (substituted some vegan mayo due to allergies). While the cakes did not hold their shape too well, the flavor was fabulous! I served with a mango/ginger chutney and the avocado salad. There were no leftovers and there were only 2 of us. I used fresh king crab. While the coolness of the avocado salad nicely complemented the crab cakes, I think the salad might benefit from some slightly different flavors. Seemed a bit too South of the Border for this dish.

Way good.

True, this has a lot of ingredients, but I found it quite worth it. I doubled the recipe (all but the cilantro) and actually made it stretch into about 12 patties, rather than the expected 8. I also didn't search out the panko, I just used regular italian breadcrumbs. I served this to 6 people, including myself and everyone raved over it. None of the spices seemed to overpower the crab flavor. They tasted great and weren't full of filler, like many crab cakes I've gotten at restaurants before. I plan to make another batch this week and freeze a bunch of the patties for later!

This may be the first time I've given a 4 fork rating. The recipe was time consuming, but well worth it. I served the cakes with the suggested tamarind chutney and they were just incredible. THe avocado salad was good, but I put in extra lime peel/juice and that was a mistake as the lime flavor overpowered the avocados. Next time (and there WILL be a next time) I won't add extra lime to the salad. ALso, I used regular breadcrumbs and they were fine.

I made this with only 6 oz of crabmeat and I feel I really should have made sure to have 8oz or more next time. However, the flavor was wonderful and everything came together perfectly. I did not think this was a lot of work at all compared to many other recipes, I am not sure what the other reviewers are referring to, I had the whole thing done in under 1 hour.

Another 3.5-fork recipe that I've rated conservatively because of the whole-fork rule. The avocado salad goes beautifully with the crab cakes, which are flavorful but don't quite make the "to-die-for" cut. I expect using higher-quality, jumbo lump crab meat would make a big difference. I agree that serving the crab cakes atop mesclun greens with the avocado salad on top would produce an elegant lunch, but I think the greens would need to be dressed first. As for the ratios in the salad recipe, you may need to increase all the other ingredients if your avocados are even the slightest bit larger than "small". I increased the lime juice, tomato, and cilantro by about 50%, and I think it could have used extra onion (and possibly lime peel) as well. Thanks for the tip about freezing the crab cakes in advance!

These were SO good. I loved the flavors (especially the ginger) and the texture and taste of the combination of the crabcakes and avocado salad. Really quick recipe too! My first time making crabcakes. I'll do it again! They were a big hit with my boyfriend. I made tomatoes stuffed with goat cheese (another epicurious recipe) along with them and it was a perfect summer meal.

This is a great combination and easy to make. I couldn't find panko in my area so I used plain bread crumbs. The crab cakes were still delicious. My husband thought the addition of walnuts to the avocado salad would be good. This makes a wonderful summer dish.

I made these for a small dinner party with some friends. They were a HUGE success. We topped off the meal with an avacado ice cream which was made by one of the other guests. What a fantastic meal for a cool spring evening.

Taking note of the comments, I cut back 1/2 on the spices in these crabcakes and they were GREAT, really wonderful. I don't think however, I'd bother with the avocado salad again - simply slice up some tomato, avocado and red onion and serve it all on bed of lightly dressed baby romaine.

YUMMY! i loved the combination of indian spices with the crab -- what a delicious change of pace from your normal mayonnaisey/herby/breadcrumby crab cake. and the avocado salad goes so beautifully with it. to all those people who said that this recipe has too many ingredients -- are you looking for a recipe for rice-a-roni or something? interesting recipes like this are the reason i visit epicurious!

The spices for this recipe were too strong for the crab. I would not make it again. The avocado salad was great. That part I would make again, but would put it maybe with burritos or chili rellanos.

This is a delicious salad if presented on very thinly sliced lettuce, avocado and some seeded tomatoes. The crab cake will be topped with the dressing as in the recipe. It can be a very elegant lunch when the cakes are bigger and the salad with more greens. This is very easy to make and not complicated. The recipe needs to be revised. I prepared 3 pounds of crab cakes, 4-inch rounds, and made 24 cakes. Wrapped them in plastic, then in freezer paper and in freezer plastic, and labeled them. I will use them for dinners, or lunch. Since I entertain a lot, this will be handy.

After reading the reviews about this recipe requiring too much effort, I did everything the night before. It took me exactly 45 minutes. That includes everything from digging around in the fridge trying to find everything to most of the clean up. I didn't feel it was too much effort. I'm sure I'd be much quicker next time if I were to make it again. However, I won't be doing that. Perhaps I'm a crab cake snob but I thought the spices and other flavors overpowered the "delicate-ness" of the crab. The avacodo salad flavors were way too overpowering. Don't get me wrong. I LOVE spicy food. This wasn't particularly spicy, just too overbearing for crab.

Very good recipe, easy to make. I don't know what everyone is talking about saying there are too many ingredients in this recipe. My God several are just spices for pete's sake! What kind of recipes is everyone used to?

Too much to do and too many ingredients!! Reminds me of the line in the movie Amadeus "too many notes"! Not everyting needs to be prepared with five or fewer ingredients in 45 min or less. This looks like a fun dish for those of us who still like cooking and a bit of a challenge-which is what Epicurious is about for me.
