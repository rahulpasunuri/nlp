So Easy! We made this in advance and put it in the Microwave before serving over ice-cream. The flavours are yummy and true chocolate!

So easy to make and what great flavor!! I added it to chocolate souffle. Previous reviewer was right and can be added to almost anything. Next I will try and figure out how to create a chocolate pudding from this.

Oh so good! Don't stop at pouring over ice cream. This versatile sauce is good in coffee, over pancakes, cake, to make hot chocolate, or anything your heart desires. I confess I occasionally eat a spoon of it plain when I feel the need for chocolate.
