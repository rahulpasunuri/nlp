I love this recipe! The only change I make is to *not* add the salt and pepper to the eggs until the last possible minute. The first time I follwed the instructions to the letter, I wondered if the salt sitting in the eggs would make the frittata flat, and it did.

This recipe is a little weird as you cook the eggs from the bottom (on the stove) and then from the top (under the broiler), but it turned out delicious and it was easy to make, so I'll be making it again! I made it exactly as described.

It's quite good, with a nice of chard flavor. I'm not a big "eggs for breakfast" kind of guy, but I liked it. Not particularly kid friendly.

First frittata a resounding success! Used kale instead of chard, and feta instead of pecorino mixed into the eggs. Grated pecorino on top. Very tasty, great texture. Will make for Mardi Gras buffet with whatever green the local urban farm has.

Easy and Tasty. I was given a fresh bunch of Swiss chard and since my husband won't eat it I wanted to look up a fun recipe. This is it. I also used some of the chopped up stems, sauteed with the onion. Added leftover cooked, chopped red potatoes since they needed to be used up. Added 3 egg whites as some other users since I had lots of eggs on hand. Would be great picnic fare.

I cut this in half and do it in a small frying pan for a 2 person breakfast. You'd never guess it was only 3 eggs! The 1st time I followed the recipe as is and it was great. The 2nd time I used sundried tomato rosemary ham (for sandwiches from the deli) and spinach and it was just as good. New weekend staple for sure. Super easy and looks/tastes impressive.

Absolutely wonderful flavors! Used prosciutto instead of the salami, and beautiful rainbow chard - the frittata turned out looking fabulous. I will definitely be making this again and again.

Delicious! Just added to my recipe box. Easy to prep ingredients ahead of time & throw together quickly. Used proscuitto, since I prefer it over salami. Served for brunch with salad & good bread.

Really excellent! My only change was to use a combination of eggs and egg whites that I had on hand and to slice up the center ribs of chard and add them to the onion saute, in deference to Chef Alex G, No need to be wasteful; they taste wonderful and add more substance. Great recipe. I plan to make often. Very easy and adaptable.

made vegetarian with no meat for friends and LOVED it. have loads of swiss chard in garden and this is my favorite recipe so far. slow sauteed onions to almost carmelized and added menchego cheese and half and half to give a bit more flavor b/c of no meat...made 3 different frittatas and this was the favorite by far - goodbye spinach - hello chard!

This was delicious. I used 3 oz of prosciutto instead of salami, since I had it on hand, and spring onions from my farm share. Otherwise, made it as directed. We had it for dinner with some beaujolais and ciabatta. I am not that familiar with eggs as a main ingredient, or with frittatas, but was looking for some chard alternatives. This was a pleasant surprise.

I made with Spanish chorizo instead of salami with fantastic results: a little smokey and spicy. Will definitely make again.

Made this for a brunch. I was in the middle of nowhere on vacation so had to use generic beef salami. Results - neither greasy nor salty. Perfect. Everyone loved it. Wound up making another the next day.

Yum! But quite salty with the pecorino AND the salami. I shall try it again with less of the added salt. For the record, I was a chard-o- phobe. Now, I know that the flavor is as flexible as that of green veggies that people tend to eschew. Oh, and I didn't have an onion on hand. I was liberal with some onion powder and that seemed to do well enough.

Don't change a thing. This is a great dish. (2oz of salami for the entire dish, shouldn't make it greasy as others have noted).

I thought this was great! I did use, however 5 whole eggs and 3 egg whites instead of the 6 whole eggs called for in the recipe.

This is a tasty, easy, and beautiful dish, sure to garner many oohs and aahs from your family or guests. This would be great before a long hike in the mountains or other strenuous activity. However, I personally found the salami to be too greasy, salty, and heavy for an already greasy, salty and heavy dish. Granted, I didn't help matters by using Pecorino Romano cheese, which is brinier than Parmesan. I would make this again if I could make it with a lighter meat or vegetarian substitute, like prosciutto, turkey, or portabello mushrooms, and did not use the Pecorino Romano.

My husband and three children loved this! My 6 year-old son said, "Can we have this every night?" I, too, added eggs (3) to the 6 called for in the recipe. I added zucchini (sliced & quartered). I used a mixture of spinach, chard, & mustard greens. YUM!

I had swiss chard from the farmers market which I did not know what to do with and found this recipe. It was really good -- very flavorable and will be a new go to frittata recipe.

Good flavors. Will make again for dinner. Little too hearty for breakfast. Using 10" cast iron had to extend cook time by 2x, but came out beautifully. Added 1 addl egg, only 2/3 chard was plenty. Otherwise no changes needed.
