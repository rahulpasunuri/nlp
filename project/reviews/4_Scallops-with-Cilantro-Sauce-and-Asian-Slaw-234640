Fantastic! I used 2 carrots, 1 apple, and a 1/2 head of cabbage. I doubled the slaw dressing but only ended up using 3/4 of it. The store didn't have scallops so I did Halibut instead and it was excellent. Great recipe!!

Delicious! the sauce was a little too sweet for me, so I recommend reducing the sugar -- or even eliminating it. I also added a little sambal oelek to the sauce, which gave it a nice zing. Like other reviewers I used olive oil and added some cabbage and radishes because I didn't have any daikon on hand. We ate it as a summer main course -- great light Sunday dinner!

I was disappointed in this recipe. I didn't feel the flavors went that well together. It was not anywhere near outstanding. I did like the slaw part, but the scallops really were bland as is.

Left out fish sauce because you're a vegetarian...in a scallops recipe?

Beautiful dish . . . very light and flavorful. Took me longer to cut all the vegis, plus I added cabbage, small amount of cucumber & jicama as previously recommended. Otherwise followed other suggestions and was excellent. Will definitely make again. Did substitute olive oil for the vegi oil.

I just made the slaw, no scallops. In fact, I used this recipe because I wanted a healthier cole slaw (no mayo), so I used cabbage and green onion as the base. I left out the fish oil, since I'm a vegetarian, but I used all the rest of the dressing ingredients, and it was excellent. I used an entire serrano chile, and the spice was perfect.

I thought this was really fantastic...just be cautious to not do the dressing on the slaw until about 10 minutes to plating. I made it correctly the first time but the second I let it sit to long and it over pickled and was really wet and soft. So awesome though done correctly!!!

I used the vinegar/salt/sugar dressing, but my veggies were apple, carrot, red pepper, jicama and cucumber to use up some things from the fridge. It was great. Made the scallops and cilantro per the recipe and they were just lovely, but the "slaw" is a new family favorite. It will be a strong side dish for so many things.

This has been a standby in my repertoire since it was published. The scallops are good but the Asian slaw is great. Everyone who tastes it loves it.

Absolutely beautiful and tastes fantastic! The Asian Slaw would be wonderful with any fish dish. Make all of it to have some left over. I used cucumber and radish instead of daikon. I used 2 giant grilled scallops per person and 3 shrimp. It was a wonderful light meal. I forgot the Serrano pepper and might leave it out again.

Very good. Nice balance of flavors. Easy to make. Went great with a Reisling. A suggestion from my husband would be to add some crushed peanuts on top. Yum!

Delightful! I prepared this dish despite my husband's naysaying over the cilantro sauce and he raved about it even after learning what it was. Due to inavailability, I used cucumber in lieu of the daikon radish which always works well in a summer vinegarette.

OUTSTANDING! The cilantro sauce really made the dish! We only used one tsp of serrano chili, but was too warm for some palates. We'll use the sauce on other dishes as well ...

Fantastic! I don't have a mandoline or food processor so I julienned all by hand but it was well worth the effort. This is a GREAT summer dish. I had it as a main course and didn't even feel the need for a side dish. I didn't have any scallops so I substituted some shrimp and cod. Very refreshing and perfect for summer.

I made 1/3 of the scallops but all of the slaw. It was excellent. I used the small bay scallops but the next time I will use the large ones. The slaw was good the next day also and a good healthy snack.

Hi Seattle... Scallops are my favorite thing to cook because they're generally super quick and easy. Try these two great recipes on Epicurious: PAN-SEARED SCALLOPS WITH CHAMPAGNE GRAPES (any grapes) AND ALMONDS, SAUTEED SCALLOPS WITH WATERCRESS AND CORN SALAD, SCALLOPS PROVENCALE. All super quick and easy...and very good.

A mandoline is the best tool for the job; a food processor is second runner-up.

I was in the mood for an easy, clean tasting healthy dinner. I shy away from scallops because I don't know how to cook them well. But this dish was great. I made it as a main course for 2, halfing the scallops but keeping true to the slaw and sauce amounts.The scallops were easy to get right, the slaw was crunchy and tangy, and it contrasted well with the heat from the sauce. I have more confidence now, I think I am up to trying more scallop recipes. Any ideas on a good tool for making julienne strips would be appreciated.
