So very easy!Wonderful flavor. Only change was to use fennel pollen in place of ground fennel seeds. The fish was moist and the butter really added great flavor. Definitely a keeper; good for family or for company.

I goofed and added the butter mixture to the raw fish and then baked it. It turned out great! Wonderful flavors! It's my go to halibut recipe now.

Just made this for the first time. I used some ground fennel from Penzeys and substituted basil for parsley. I added tsp of lemon juice. The fish was melt in your mouth from baking in the wine and the fennel butter was wonderful.

I am not usually a big halibut fan, but this recipe was AMAZING! I used more wine than they suggested, and brought the wine to almost cover the fish (a true "poaching"). The fish came out incredibly flaky and super succulent and had wonderful flavor. As far as previous reviews stating the butter wasn't salty enough, the recipe states to salt and pepper the butter to taste, so follow the recipe and salt to your taste. :)

This recipe has been a standby for me for about 9 years now -- one of my all-time favorites. Incredibly easy to make, absolutely delicious, nearly impossible to screw up. I like to serve it with grilled asparagus. It has become my standard dish to cook for a first or second date, and it has never failed to impress; I looked it up today to cook for the woman I am going to propose to. This is one of my all-time favorite dishes on epicurious.

This is lovely, I'd give it 3.5 forks if I could. Tastes like things we've eaten in France. I used tilapia, and it stayed incredibly moist cooked this way. The butter is intesting and completely different, and easy to make. I was nervous after reading some of the previous reviews, but my husband and I really enjoyed this.

I used less fennel which proved to be good judgement (any more would overpower the fish) The fennel flavor was good but the "chopped" seeds were unpleasant to eat with the texture of the fish (was that a bone? oh, no, just that seedy fennel). Next time I will pulverize the fennel. I also liked the butter on the salty side vs. unsalted. The wine didn't offer a significant difference and water might be just fine.

NO TASTE AT ALL HORRIBLE

So easy, so nice. I imagine that you could substitute a number of different spices for the fennel, perhaps will try dill and/or lemon pepper the next time. Will definitely make again.

The butter is delicious. (I didn't have halibut or wine, so I made this with pollack fillets and for the liquid I used chicken stock with about a tablespoon of apple juice, and I only needed about half the liquid that the halibut would need.) The dish was wonderful - I can imagine it being even more wonderful with halibut and wine.

This is a good recipe...the fish is very moist. As we enjoy sauces with our food, although we were only cooking two halibut steaks we still made all of the butter. This was a mistake because of the intensity of the fennel. Next time we will halve the butter too.

Really good stuff. All my guests enjoyed this and it was a relatively easy low stress dinner party menu item since you can do the butter in advance and only have to keep an eye on the fish in the oven while working on the salad and bread.

We loved the butter sauce with fennel. We made it with Monkfish and it was delicious and sooo easy. With homemade potatoes...Yum!!

My husband and I both disliked this recipe. Maybe it was due to the fennel, which we had never had before and didn't like, but I would NOT recommend this recipe to anyone! Also, I think the fish needed more time to cook. I threw this recipe out.

Hubby says 3 forks, I say 2 forks. I agree with K from San Diego, the fish is moist cooked this way. Quick and easy but I may tinker with the ingredients next time.

What can I say? This is truly a wonderful recipe. Very easy, but a delightful taste. Also different. Great when you are preparing other dishes that are a bit tempermental. This is definitely going onto my 'keep' list.

Good but not great. But definitely the fact that it's so easy to make is a plus. The halibut is very moist when cooked this way.

This is a very easy recipe- you could fool dinner guests into thinking you slaved for hours.... My husband thought it was fantastic, as well. Use a good Chardonnay and you'll impress friends and family!

This was a very tasty recipe with a unique but pleasing taste. I reduced the wine to about a tablespoon drizzled it over the halibut before adding the mustard fennel butter. This is one of my favourite sites, just type in an ingredient and presto I have many options to choose from. Alot easier then looking them up in my 500+ cookbooks in my library.

This recipe was easy enough to make on a weeknight and very delicious. It took less than half an hour to make, but it tasted like a "special occasion" dish. If you made the butter beforehand, it could be put together in 20 minutes. I'd definitely make it again.
