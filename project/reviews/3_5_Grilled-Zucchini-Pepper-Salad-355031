It was a little more practical for me to broil the vegetables, which worked just fine, although I'll try grilling outdoors next time. I'm not a big fan of green peppers but we had some from the garden, and surprise - I found it a great side dish, quite flavorful.

very good recipe - rave reviews every time i make it (as written.) you'd never expect it to be so good given the pedestrian ingredients.

Love this salad! I also add a few ears of grilled corn to increase servings and to vary texture. Just brush the husked corn cobs with oil, salt, and pepper (start these first since they take longer to cook than the other vegetables). I also grill the peppers whole until charred; then place them in a bowl covered with plastic wrap for about 15 mins; peels come off easily. This salad is one of my family's favorites, even my 2- and 4-year old kids love it.

I made this recipe with yellow patty pan squash as well as zuchinni and omitted the brown sugar. Note that the zuchinni needs to be well cooked to eliminate the bitter taste that zuchinni can have. Otherwise, it was good.

Delicious exactly as written. I've experimented a little and find that I enjoy the following variations: 1. While the brown sugar is excellent, I've found that I enjoy substituting agave nectar. Tasty, and appreciated by anyone on a restricted carb diet. 2. Roast the peppers whole. Let the roasted peppers cool in a covered bowl by themselves until cool enough to remove the peel and seeds. I prefer the resulting texture and that way I get the marvelous "liquor" to use in other dishes.

I made this recipe for the first time tonight and it was a complete hit! I loved it, my guests loved it, my husband loved it. Ok, my 2 year old daughter did not love it, but she at least tried it (not a fan of vinegar). This is a delicious and easy side dish and I will make it again for sure.

Yum! I'm a pretty inexperienced cook, so I was pleasantly surprised at how easy this was to make. I used orange bell peppers and I didn't peel them, but everything turned out great. Balsamic with zucchini is quickly becoming my new favorite thing to eat. The flavor was sweeter here than just sauteing it like I usually do.
