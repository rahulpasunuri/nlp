I first made this when it came out in the magazine and loved it. I have made it multiple times since to rave reviews. Including last night - where my friends asked for the recipe...so I sent them to Epicurious! Wax beans are difficult to find so I often substitute green beans, but aside from that I do not make substitutions. I agree with other reviewer - do not be afraid of the anchovies - they blend beautifully.

Made this when I got the Bon Appetit magazine in 1996 and have made it several times since. Did not change a thing. A good quality leg is important regardless of the recipe. New Zealand or Australian we feel are the best as far as consistancy.

This is a great make-ahead company worthy recipe - all-inclusive as well. The marinate on the lamb when grilled adds bursts of cruchy flavor. For personal preference, I went a little light on dressing the salad.

I have been making this lamb since it first appeared in Bon Appetit and it's still the best. Everyone loves it!

This is the ultimate summer grilling and entertaining dish, and a great way to make use of the fresh Farmer's market ingredients. Easy and so beautiful to serve. Was hesitant at first because of the anchovies, but do not fear. They blend wonderfully with the rest of the dish. Don't pass this one up.

I made this salad to go alongside grilled lamb chops and/or filet, and everyone loved it! Here are the changes I made: I used green beans and grilled portobello mushrooms. Yum!

I have made this twice and it is delicious. I substituted a whole beef tenderloin for the lamb,with excellent results. I served it first at a dinner party for friends and again for a family gathering and everyone loved it, even the kids.

This dish is easy to prepare and a real crowd pleaser. I made it originally in 1996, and I still have people from that dinner party calling to ask for the recipe!!
