Excellent. I followed an earlier writer's suggestion and added sliced green pepper during the last 30 minutes and this tasted authentic. I served it with on a plate of chinese rice noodles which were then coated nicely by the sauce.

I kinda went postal on this recipe because my pantry was out of a few things. My subs were: black beans = Li Kum Kee Black Beans with chili oil and garlic sherry = whiskey maple syrup = molasses cider vinegar = plum vinegar lapsang souchong tea = celestial seasonings roasstaroma It sounds ridiculous but it worked out pretty well - not exactly asian but more like a chinese barbary coast specialty of yore. I had all the other ingredients. My way of thinking about this recipe is that the main magic is in the technique anyway. You can use the same technique with a lot of different sauce variations and it would work great. I would like to try this with the original ingredients though. I had the butcher cut the racks in half before cutting the individual ribs - this to me would be a more manageable hors d'ouvre.

A lot of work and preppig for an only so-so outcome.

Very disappointing. Tender but not much flavour.

Authentic and finger licken good! Delicious, and better than the same dish we ordered at a restaurant recently -- their was way too salty. One suggestion, as in many authentic Chinese Black Bean dishes we've enjoyed is to add a half of a green pepper in thin slices to the dish about halfway through the braising.

I ordered the tea specified in the recipe by going on the internet and searching for it--a number of companies sell it. The tea is most unusual--a very smoky flavor, which made me think that this recipe would be as good as claimed. Unfortunately, the four of us who ate these ribs found nothing special about them. They were ok but nothing to write home about. I was very disappointed because I like recipes for ribs that do not involve barbecuing. For a truly finger-licking, non-barbecue rib, try Sarah Moulton's Paprika-Glazed Baby Back Ribs.

I loved these. I added quite a bit more garlic just because I am fond of it, and I also marinated the ribs in a soy, vinegar, rice wine, garlic, ginger, black bean mixture (don't remember exact measurements, but I don't know that it was important) for a few hours, but otherwise followed the recipe. very tasty.

I made this for my Chinese family and everyone loved it! I did make a few changes - increased 2 tbsp ginger to 3, 1 tbsp onion to 2 and swopped Earl Grey for Lapsang souchong tea (as I couldn't find any in the local supermarket) and changed maple syrup to brown sugar. Results were fantastic. I can't wait to try this again with Lapsang Souchong tea when I can find it. I couldn't taste the Earl Grey which was probably overwhelmed by the rest of the ingredients but I am sure it contributed to the taste.
