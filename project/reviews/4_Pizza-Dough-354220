This has been my go-to recipe for over a year and it i by far better than any other I've tried. Perfect chewy, crisp crust. Nothing needs to be changed in this recipe, though sometimes I use whole wheat flour for a change. I bake at 500F in the bottom third of the oven and use cornmeal in the pan to prevent sticking. I don't prebake - just place the toppings on the dough and bake. Easy!

I have made this multiple times, and I often substitute half of the flour for either whole wheat flour, rye flour, or quinoa flour. Most recently, I used 1 c. rye flour, 1 c. quinoa flour, 1T ground flax seed, and about 1T honey. It was delicious and makes two large pizzas. In fact, we wrapped one "round" in plastic wrap and kept it in the fridge for about two days. It was still delicious and baked up the same as the first pizza.

This my new pizza dough recipe. Crisp yet chewy. Excellent. Look no further.

My boyfriend is from near New Haven Conneticut (Pizza Haven I call it) and is very picky about pizza dough. We love this crust. We even prefer making this over buying the crust our favorite local pizza place sells. I also agree with a previous reviewer about adding sugar to the yeast mixture, totally gives it that extra special something!

This was the first time I'd made pizza dough from scratch. It was very sticky, and a little difficult to work with, but it turned out well and I'd use the recipe again. At least I know now what to expect!

delicious dough, I made this with the extra 1/2 tsp sugar in the yeast mixture and I baked the dough for 5 min at 450 prior to placing toppings on it. After topping, I brushed melted butter on the edges of the crust to get it a nice golden brown crunch. It was my first time with homemade pizza dough and it turned out amazing! I will use this recipe again!

Awesome pizza dough, chewy, crisp, just how pizza dough should be. The dough is sticky and bit tricky to work with, but well worth the effort.

This is a great and easy pizza dough. We cooked one pizza in the oven, the other one we cooked on the grill. The grilled one was the hands down winner. Will never cook one in the oven again. Crisp and chewy it was a wnner.

This was pretty good but I'd definitely do things different on the next try! To my mix, I added garlic and onion powder and way more flour then it called for (and even then it was still sticky!). I pre-baked at 450 for 5 minutes and then another 13 with my toppings. My crust was a little hard so I'm going to decrease my baking time on the next go around - I probably could have taken it out around 10 minutes. After pre-baking, I did rub the edges with butter and sprinkled a parmesan-romano cheese mixture and some garlic powder for some extra flavor. Overall the texture was pretty good - sort of reminded me of the California Pizza Kitchen store brand but the original awesome one, not the one they sadly use now.

It was very good, but why doesn't the recipe include directions for cooking the dough? I had to look around the website for directions to rolling out the dough and cooking it. I've never seen a recipe that didn't take you all the way through to producing the final product. Once I figured out how to make a pizza with the dough, the dough itself was very tasty.

So delicious and easy! I have tried tons of pizza dough recipes, and this will be my new go to recipe because of the easy ingredients and super fast prep. I made the following changes: I used half AP flour and half whole wheat flour, added a half of a tablespoon of sugar to the yeast starter, and pre baked the crust for about 6-10 minutes in a 450 degree oven. Also, remember to precook any veggies or meat and sprinkle corn meal on the bottom of the pan to avoid a soggy crust. We love it!

This is my go-to recipe for pizza dough. There are other good ones, but this one is so simple and results in 'professional' dough every time!

This was the first pizza dough I've ever made, and I'm not much of a baker. I added about 1/3 cup of fresh oregano, and gave the yeast some sugar to feed on per someone's suggestion below. I ended up having enough dough for two pizzas. The first pizza I made ended up pretty good, but the crust was way to hard for me. The second pizza's crust turned out much better, but not as crispy on the bottom as I would have liked. I attribute that to my using too much olive oil on the pizza, as I usually make my pizzas with just olive oil and garlic instead of a pizza sauce. I would definitely make another batch of this dough, I think it will be great with practice.

Best pizza dough I've ever made -- soft on the inside and crispy outside. I mixed a half teaspoon of sugar in with the yeast and water to get the yeast really foamy. Threw some fresh rosemary and some garlic into the dough when mixing, then allowed it to rise in bowl coated with olive oil. So delicious!!

This is my new go to dough. We make pizza at home at least once a month, and this by far is our favorite dough.

Hands down the best pizza dough recipe I have ever used. I used a pizza stone pre-heated in a 450 degree oven and my pizza turned out amazing. Needless to say, I will never be ordering pizza again.

I've tried a few dough recipes and this has been, by far, the best pizza dough that I've made. The recipe makes two good-sized pizzas, each one feeding about 2 people, and the crust is restaurant-quality-delicious. Crispy on the outside and the bottom of the pie with chewy crust and LOTS of air bubbles. Just be sure that, when setting up the yeast mixture, your water is 110 degrees F, which is cooler than what most think. I use a candy thermometer to ensure this. I've made this a number of times now!

I used the left-over (frozen) half of my pizza dough last night. I left the dough in the saran wrap and ziploc bag while it defrosted in the fridge overnight. Then, I floured the counter, rolled it out to about .25" thin and larger than my pizza pan. I brushed the pizza pan and the top of the dough with olive oil. Rolled the extra dough around the edges to make a crust. Pre-baked at 425 for 10 minutes, added toppings, and baked for 15. Still not a 4-forker, (a little dense) but better rolled out more thinly. I think next time I make the dough, I'll add in some fresh chopped garlic or garlic powder for more oomph. I was pleased with how well it turned out after freezing. All in all, worth making again.

To the cook whose crust isn't crispy - I used a pizza pan with holes in the bottom and cooked in a well-preheated oven to good results. Worth a shot!

I made this tonight and used half to make a pizza with various toppings. I followed the recipe except I guess-timated to temp for the yeast water and added 2-3 tsp. herbes de provence to the pre-yeast flour mixture. After the dough rose, I split it in half. For dinner tonight, I stretched it out to fit my pizza pan, rolling the edges a bit, and I brushed it lightly with olive oil. I then pre-baked the crust for about 10 minutes at 425 degrees. Then I added my toppings and baked the whole thing for another 15-20 minutes. The crust was indeed crispy and chewy and sweetheart gave it 4 forks. I gave it 3, only because it was a little dense for my tastes, but that may be a reflection of my guess-timating on the temp for the yeast mixture. Based on another recipe for pizza dough, I wrapped the remaining half of dough in plastic wrap, put it in a quart size ziploc, and froze it. I'll let you know how it turns out. ;)

This is the only pizza dough recipe I ever use. It is amazing! I cover the bowls for rising in olive oil as well as the dough before letting it rise. I also pre-cook the dough for 10-15 minutes before adding toppings to the pizza. This makes the pizza crust a little bit crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It reminds me of real Italian pizza..from Italy!

This is a great recipe. The dough came out perfect, not too crispy and not too chewy. I made this for my wife and son and my son loved it! I also made breadsticks with the leftover dough and they turned out great as well.

During the recent deluges that soaked the NorthEast I decided to make bread instead of hydroplaning to the market. Looking for a bread recipe I came across this one and thought that if a well known pizza company can make rolls from its pizza dough, I could probably make bread from it. This recipe makes a great basic bread. It is especially good toasted.

This dough stuck to the bottom of the pan, and I could barely get the pizza off of it. I think it needs to have oil in it.

Super easy and can add anything (basil, chili flakes, cheese, etc.) to the dough in order to spice it up.

Love this recipe! Tasty, easy to make and roll out, pretty quick, too. Can anyone tell me how to store dough not used? Also, how to get crispy crust? I've used pizza stone at 450 degrees (ungreased) and aluminum pan at 500 degrees (greased). The bottom does not crisp, just around the edges. Thanks.

I made this recipe twice during one weekend because my fiance thought it tasted so great. It's very simple to make. I substituted some wheat flour into the recipe and it turned out great.

great basic pizza dough - crispy and chewy, just like the description promises!

The recipe is fine but incomplete. I made this recipe exactly as written and it yielded 2 large (14") medium crust pizzas. After letting the dough rise, I did the following: - Divided and rolled dough into 2 equal size balls - Let the dough rest for about 15 mins - Slowly stretched out the dough for about 5 mins until each about 14" diameter (size of my pizza stone) - Added sauce - Baked in VERY preheated oven/pizza stone at 500 for about 7 mins - Added remaining toppings baked about 15 more mins - but all oven temps vary so my advice is to watch carefully to make sure the crust or bottom do not burn

This is a wonderful pizza dough. Not hard to make and came out so tasty. We're having pizza night tonight with friends and I plan on making it again. As far as it not being complete I just looked up online how to bake pizza dough and it turned out great.

Sadly, it seems this recipe was only included as the base for a Bread Stick (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Garlic-Herb-Bread-Twists-354216). What a waste! I'm glad the Cook from Vancouver pushed it to its natural conclusion so we can follow on and test a famous Pizzeria's crust recipe.

I used this recipe but am not sure that it is complete as written. After following the recipe as stated, I divided into smaller portions again and rolled on flour covered countertop into balls and allowed to rise again for 20 minutes prior to rolling out for pizza. I then followed another recipe and baked at 500 on a pizza stone. initially with homemade sauce and then with remainder of toppings for a total of 15 to 20 minutes. Made a fabulous crust.
