Made this to go with the Corned Beef & Cabbage James Beard recipe from 1965's House & Garden, which I got off this site...try it, it's fantastic. Well, these potatoes are fantastic as well...I used Yukon golds.

I'm amazed that something so basic can tatse so great! I think it's the steeped milk - it really spreads the flavor through the dish. I make it every year for St. Pat's and love it.

So very simple, but so very satisfying. Don't ruin it by thinking about starch or fat. Just enjoy! :)

I have been making this recipe for many years and plan to serve it to guests tonight along with Wild Caught Salmon and a Lime Butter Sauce. It is absolutely delicious! Once when I served it to good friends it prompted a surprise kiss on my cheek .... from a male guest!

Made this for St. Paddy's Day Dinner along with a fabulous Corned Beef in the Pressure Cooker and a very different cabbage slaw with a warm sweet and sour dressing. First time for the CB and the Slaw. I have made the Champ before and forgot that I really do not like russet potatoes in a mashed recipe - the potatoes require a whole lot of salt to taste good, even with the cream scallion mixture. I would make these again with yukon golds or red potatoes but still love the idea of the "butter and cream" for a special occasion.

I made this for St. Patrick's Day dinner and loved it! I made it with yukon gold potatoes. The cream took the edge off the green onion. Delicious!!! I would've made some great potato pancakes with the leftovers if there were any.

St. Rose: I'm currently watching a program on the Food Network with Bobby Flay and he (and an older Irish woman) pronounce it just like you think, rhyming with the American pronunciation of 'lamp' and 'damp.' I also noticed that the woman did not cool the liquid before mixing it in with the potatoes as mentioned in a few of the reviews here.. just thought I'd mention that.

Love my Irish ancestor and love Irish cooking. This is delicious. I just sprinkled the potatoes with fresh minced parsley and coarse ground black pepper.

hate to sound like an idiot, but before I make this along with the Irish Bacon recipe, could someone tell me how "Champ" is pronounced? Like the winning fighter/boxer kind of champ? I'd hate to mispronounce it when I tell my guests what we'll be having *blush*

Being Irish, Champ is my comfort food, when I was young, my Mother would make Champ when she was preparing Ling Fish, but I didn't like fish so I was given a slice of corned beef (from a can). I am now almost 60 and that is one of my favourite comfort dinners.

Loved it. Since it was just for me & my husband, I used milk and cut back on the butter. It was still delicious, although I'm sure it was less creamy. But honestly, I didn't miss it. The flavor from the steeped green onions made up for that. But if I were to make it for company, I'd make the full fat version.

I used 5 lbs of potatoes and doubled the rest of the ingredients. It was delicious and it fed 6 adults with a little left over. A great change from potatoes boiled in with the Corned Beef & Cabbage!

This can also be made with parsley - well chopped - and just as tasty. I was surprised to see 'Boiled Beef and Cabbage'; Boiled Beef goes with Carrots and is an English Dish but Boiled BACON and Cabbage is a true Irish dish

This was just perfect and with beef tenderloin with roasted veg (from this site) absolutely fantastic. Served steak on top of potato with decoratively placed veg around and won the praise of my guests who loved it! Go on... give it a mash!

Super simple and so tasty! a great way to have some vegies w/ your potatoes. Loved it w/ the steak!

Delish! Steeping the green onions gives a nice subtle taste. Used FF half and half in place of cream and still had rich results.

I lightened it up a tiny bit, using half and half, and not quite as much butter.. it was still delicious and rich.

I made this recipe for St. Patrick's Day ( a little early) dinner. Every one loved them! I didn't think that they were overly rich and I served 3 men with very healthy appetites and had leftovers.

Very rich and good. The recipe definitely makes four servings! Served this with barbecued ribs and wilted spinach for an excellent Fourth of July meal. Do enjoy these potatoes!!!

Delicious. Made this as part of a St. Patrick's Day dinner, and everyone raved. I have had little success adding scallions to mashed potatoes in the past, but the method in this recipe does work. Steeping the scallions removes their moisture so you don't end up with a mushy starchy mess. I doubled the recips, and also added about a cup of grated white cheddar cheese.

This is a great recipe. A word of caution: if you are feeding hearty men or young boys, don't assume that 2lbs of potatoes makes 4 servings. I made 8 lbs. of potatoes and they were nearly gone with a family of 10!

I've been making mashed potatoes for years with green onions, cream and butter, but I have never used this method of steeping the onions in the cream/butter first, and I have to say, it made an incredibly great new taste to mashed potatoes! I LOVED these potatoes. I served it with the steak and spring vegetables recipe recommended above for St. Patty's Day and it was incredible. Definitely a keeper.

Rating: 3
Great...I served it with the 1965 House and Garden Corned Beef and Cabbage - a great complement. I substituted red potatoes, which normally don't mash that well (too starchy), but they turned out great. Left the skin on - the red and green together made for a nice presentation. Tripled the recipe, and it served 15 easily.

I made this recipe yesterday. The comment about cooling the cream & green onion mixture is the key. Also, making sure you drain the potatoes sufficiently is important too. Since I was serving the dish with Corned Beef & Cabbage, I did not add much salt to the potatoes. It was delish!

Just a note to the reviewers that ended up with a gluey consistency... I haven't made this exact recipe and usually hate it when folks review recipes they haven't made, but my husband and I have been making our mashed potatoes like this for years, the green onions were his idea. I tried once heating the milk and butter thinking this would make it easier to incorporate them into the potatoes. The problem? If the milk/butter is hot it keeps cooking the taters and messes the starch in them somehow and you get glue, same thing if you boil the taters too long. We eat this at least once a week and overcooking will kill them everytime. As other reviewers state the steeping adds a new flavor so go ahead and heat the cream and steep the onions but don't mash together until the cream cools. Good luck!

I guess I must have really thought highly of Elmer's glue as does my eight year old and husband. My mom always added raw onion to mashed potatoes but I stopped when I married the Rolaid king. Steeping the scallions mellows them out and my husband is quite able to digest these potatoes; the eight year old begs for Champ. Perhaps the glue factor was achieved by the wrong proportion of potato to liquid?

Rating: 1
The consistency of this dish is not even as good as Elmer's Glue. It's nasty, and I would NEVER make it again.

Loved this recipe - it's excellent. I used a little less onion (about 1 cup.)

Tired of corned beef and cabbage, I made champ and the beef tenderloin and spring vegetables for St. Patty's this year. It came out great and the presentation was to dye for. It was plenty to eat when also served with Irish Potato Bread (purchased from Great Harvest), but next year I'll go the extra step and make Irish soda bread.

I wasn't even going to consider reviewing this recipe, as my regular mashed potatoes are so very similar, I simply don't heat the cream. After tasting them, I had to review it. What a difference heating the cream and steeping the onions in it makes! These garnered better reviews than my regular potatoes, and that is saying something. I definitely recommend the beef tenderloin recipe as well.

I have made these for years, even before I read the recipe! To Audrey, being a true southerner, you learn to make potato patties from the masters...mommie. Add egg to the potatoes, then form the patties. Dredge in flour and fry.

Wonderful! Very easy to make. We had people over for dinner and it was a hit. Went very well with the Beef Tenderloin and spring veggies. Will definitely make again.

this is now one of my favorite receipes - i served it this year with our st. pat's dinner and printed out the recipe for folks - the best is that the scallions are steeped, removing that "raw" taste - will make with lots of dinners! woo hoo and yum yum

This is pretty much the recipe I have eaten at every major special family meal for as long as I can remember. My grandmother was Irish and this was pretty much one of her signature dishes.It is still my favourite way to eat potatoes!!!

I never would have thought of adding scallion to mashed potato but it was great. I half expected the steeped milk (I didn't have cream on han) to turn green and was slightly disappointed that it didn't, but the taste was great. I tried forming the leftovers into patties and frying them in olive oil the next day, but that was a disaster. Eat them as is and you will love them.

This recipe was simple to prepare, could be made ahead and was EXCELLENT. Exquisite with the Beef Tenderloin with spring vegetables. This was a meal for the record books.

Marvelous! These were by far the best mashed potatoes I've ever tasted. I made them as a side to corned beef and cabbage and they were the topic of conversation at the dinner table. I will make them again and again. It's great having a mashed potatoe recipe you can make several hours ahead of time.

This recipe was very good but after having the mashed potatoes with leek and thyme (from this site), any onion-type mashed potatoes pales in comparison. However, it was tasty and my guests loved it, had seconds, and since I made so much carted the leftovers home with them. It went very well with the mustard crusted lamb leg and mustard cream sauce I served.

Sublime. Works well with whole milk, too (even tho there's really no substitute for cream!). For variations, try adding horseradish or garlic to the milk mixture. Gives it a nice little kick.
