This recipe has become one of our regular dishes. I make it whenever I crave sushi since I have yet to find a good sushi restaurant in my hood. Made it once without the Nappa cabbage but I wouldn't do it again. The napa really tones down the rice vinegar in the rice.

I thought it was a very tasty and easy dish. I had to use ground ginger because I don't have fresh, and I just used whatever vegetables I had on hand.

I fixed this dish for a regular Thursday night family dinner. The reviews were all over the place so I just made it as stated. It turned out delicious. The chicken couldn't have been any moister and the miso sauce was not too sweet, especially combined with the soy sauce. The rice also turned out excellent. I will definitely make this again.

I thought this recipe was very good, although the veggies weren't exactly show-stopping. The chicken was absolutely delicious. I altered the recipe slightly by using sweet white miso paste and leaving out the sugar and I used olive oil instead of canola. Also, I cooked the chicken at 450 to speed along the process. YUM! The miso sauce is definitely going to remain part of my repertoire.

So simple, yet so tasty. I crave this recipe all the time. I make it as written, except I think I ended up with the red miso...

My husband and I LOVED this recipe! I find it challenging to find healthy but truly flavorful, delicious recipe, but this fit the bill perfectly and I'll definitely be making this one again - a lot! After reading the reviews, I was a little worried about the chicken tasting too sweet. I cut down the sugar proportion but not by much at all. I was also a little skeptical about the sourness of the rice vinegar + salt on the veggies and rice. But when the chicken is put on top of the rice/veggies mix, the flavors blend and balance each other out PERFECTLY. It's amazing. I used a fork to poke holes in the raw chicken breasts before marinating them, so that more of the marinade flavor could get into the interior of the chicken...as I hate baking chicken and having the outside be tasty, but the inside as bland as can be. It seemed to work well but I did also add extra marinade sauce on top of the dish before serving, just in case. Also, a few minutes before taking the chicken out of the oven, I broiled it on low to brown the top a little, in order to make it more visually appealing and not so white. An outstanding recipe - definitely a keeper!

This is fantastic -- I am making it again for guests. Just loved it.

Way too much vinegar in the rice! I even added an extra cup of rice to cut it, and it was still on the heavy side. The chicken was really good, though I also went easy on the sugar.

A nice, balanced, easy meal. I used a ginger/garlic stir- fry blend instead of fresh ginger, which I would not recommend. The garlic gave it a dark flavor that was unwelcome--I would have preferred the bright/sharp ginger taste alone. My kids questioned the blend of the rice and the salad and wanted it all separate--but that will be easy to do. My husband asked for more rice vinegar next time-- I think he might have been satisfied with a larger veg- to-rice ratio. I used large boneless breasts-- next time I'll either slice them to make thinner pieces because I would have liked a more grilled-type texture and taste to the chicken. Sesame seeds or Gomasio would make a nice garnish. Everyone agreed I was "allowed" to make it again, which is pretty high praise in this house for something totally unfamiliar. I thought it was nice, but I'll go for delicious next time w/ a few changes!

The chicken was good but I loved the rice and vinegar combination. I added sauteed onions, carrot, peas and blanched kale to the rice. The sweetness of the veggies stood up to the vinegar and I could eat that all the time. I wanted to love the chicken as well but kept thinking that I should have made miso-glazed fish instead.

This is my husband's favorite chicken. I make it all of the time. The sauce is sweet, but I like it. Also I frequently skip the cabbage and just use more pepper and carrots in the rice.

Great recipe - although the overall miso glaze is a bit too sweet and the rice is bit too sour - I think next time, I'd split the sugar - 1/2 in the sauce & I'd add 1/2 to the rice to mellow out the vinegar & salt.

easy, delicious, what more could you ask of a weekday meal? I used brown miso paste instead of white, because that's what I had on hand. It was great. I also used reg green cabbage and it was fine too. Next time, I'll try with brown rice, as people here suggested

Great way to use up extra miso since they only sell it in bathtub size containers! My husband likes sweet sauces and he really enjoyed this. I liked it enough to make it again. Loved the rice with the veggies-- we used brown.

I was very surprised at how well this recipe turned out. I was tempted to spice up the vegetables thinking that rice wine vinegar and salt wouldn't be enough, but it was a perfect balance. I made two changes - I skipped adding any sugar based on users feedback and it was perfect. I used brown rice instead of white sushi rice and it gave a very nice nutty flavor to the dish. I plan to try other cuts of chicken as well.

I made this for my kids and the chicken was a real hit. I found it verging on icky sweet so I would reduce the sugar next time. The grown-ups loved the veggies. I had to use brown miso paste as the white was not available.

When I made the miso marinade I was a little apprehensive. It was so sweet. I added a tbl of soy sauce the balance the sweetness. Once the chicken was put together with the rice I was sold. The combination is excellent. I love the salty tart vinegar vegies with the rice. They nicely complement the chicken. I will definitely make this again.

I've just discovered my new all time favorite chicken recipe! Whatever you do, don't skip the rice. The perfect blend of flavors. Nearly by accident, I made "Tangy eggplant, long beans & cherry tomatoes w/roasted peanuts" from this site as a veggie side, and it is now a permanent union in my list of menus. An absolute gem of a meal.

The recipe sounded like something I would like, but I was very skeptical about until I plated it. I served the rice salad cold and the chicken was hot so it was a nice contrast to eat together as one. All of my doubts went away at first taste though! It was delicious! The sauce resembled the flavor of peanut sauce. The meal was quite fabulous!

A great recipe! I couldn't get white miso and used garbanzo miso instead. The sauce was really tasty and the chicken very moist. I also really liked the rice.

My only complaint about this dish is that the miso glaze was a little too sweet and overpowering. I haven't had time to experiment, but I bet using a little less sugar would improve the flavor alot. Scraping some of the glaze off of the cooked chicken might help as well. The rice was delicious, although when eaten with the chicken, it was hard to taste the rice through the glaze. In general, though, it was a very good recipe.

I just made the chicken without the rice, and it was a big success. The chicken was incredibly moist and the sauce was delicious. One thing I changed is that I used red miso instead of white, because that's what I had on hand.

This was a great recipe - my husband loved it and he usually steers clear of chicken. I'd even use the "sauce" again on fish maybe? I am asian american and i felt that it definitely gave an authentic asian flavor!

This was an excellent recipe. Everything went perfectly. The only change I made was using chort grain brown rice, which turned out really nice.
