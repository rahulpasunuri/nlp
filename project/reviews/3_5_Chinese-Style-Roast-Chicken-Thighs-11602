Unlike almost everyone else, I made this exactly as the recipe is printed, and it was delicious. The aroma of the roasting chicken was a real bonus, and I will add this recipe to the list of quick and tasty chicken dishes available for dinner.

Quick and easy. Made it a tad bit sweeter with tamarind concentrate and dark soy sauce. Took a bit longer to broil in an old electric oven.

I thought this reciepe was quick easy and tasty. I made some fresh spring rolls to go with it. It was a perfect hot summer night dish!

I don't know if I can duplicate this -- but my first time out, I remembered that I had a jar of garlic/ginger paste from the local east Indian grocery store in the fridge, so I added this to the listed marinade ingredients, plus I doubled it (except for the honey), used ginger powder and added dried red pepper flakes as suggested by the other readers. I marinaded the chicken thighs -- I recommend neat with no skin/no bone -- for about 8 hours and then grilled them. It only takes about 4 minutes in the double side grill machine, and they turned out pretty yummy.

Good just as written. Used star anise, as I had it, and felt it more authentic in a Chinese-style dish. Very easy.

Very delicious and easy! I substituted ground ginger for fresh and 5 spice powder for the anise, and did not use the blender. The skin was a beautiful deep caramel color. I served this with steamed baby bok choy...yummy.

Recipe was very easy and tasty. Like others, I marinated for about 3 hours. Cooking time was about 30 minutes.

I enjoyed the fact that this recipe was soooo easy. It was also quite tasty.

The troops liked this one! I also used 5 spice powder, and marinated the chicken for a longer time, 3hrs. Very simple dish, fast enough for a weeknight meal.

Excellent and easy

The sauce is real good, I'll use this again, for that. It went well over rice. Also, next time I'll use boneless chicken, as I had bone-in thighs.

I marinaded it for about and hour and a half, added crushed red pepper and chopped tarragon in place of anise (a stretch, I know, but it gave a good licorice flavor) I also added black sesame seeds to the top as I roasted it. The result was wonderful! I loved the flavor and the aroma was great. This was such an easy recipe! Served with stir fried broccoli, red peppers, and japanese eggplant.

Used more garlic, added red pepper flakes & used 5 spice instead of aniseed. Marinated it for a couple hours & cooked it for 40 mins, including 10 mins w/bottom side up. The skin all over was dark & crispy. Served it w/Asian style cole slaw & sesame asparagus.

A family pleaser - kids (10 and 7) and adults loved it. Served this with stir fried veggies and rice. 4 forks for ease to taste ratio.

I doubled the marinade for four medium chicken thighs and it seemed to be just enough. I added 3-4 chopped scallions and some crushed red pepper. I also marinated the chicken all day while at work and I wouldn't shorten it. The accompaniments were sticky rice and asian cole slaw.

Rating: 3
I used chicken thighs and drumsticks, quadrupled the marinade (I was serving 5) used 5 spice and on the advice of the other reviewers marinated the chicken for the afternoon. I threw it it the oven for 40 minutes and we enjoyed a tasty, easy dish with rice and an asian style salad. Will make this again. A nice Monday meal.

Loved this recipe. Easy to do. I did marinate boneless chicken thighs for about 3 hours. I found they were done perfectly in 25 minutes, nice and tender, made fried rice to go with it and sauteed some pea pods.

Rating: 2
Marinated longer, used 5-Spice but otherwise prepared as recipe advised. Chicken was crispy and yet moist. Legs would work well here, too.

Rating: 1
Did I miss something here? I put everything together, cooked the thighs and it was horrible! Knowing how long it takes thighs to get tender, I knew 25 minutes would not be enought time, so I cooked 40 minutes. No flavor, tough and not appetizing. Would not make again.

Rating: 3
Used breast & thigh, used chinese 5spice instead of anise seed, marinated for a few hours rather than just 15 mins. Didn't expect such tasty results! And guess what, this is a low fat recipe in disguise. (I also used skinless chicken - result was still great.)

Rating: 3
I too substituted 5-spice for the anise but would use more than 1/4 tsp. next time. Also, chicken was tasty but a little too greasy cooked for such a short time. Will keep it in for up to 45 minutes next time. I liked it!

Really good for ease of cooking and minimal ingredients. I used fresh pre-crushed ginger from the refrigerated section of the produce area for quicker prep.

Like others I subbed 5 spice powder for anise and the results were delicious. Did marinate for several hours

This was yummy! I don't honey, so I left it out and I also subbed five spice powder for the anise. It was delicious - we don't usually go for the thighs, but everyone in my family thought it was very good. A good fast weeknight dish.

This recipe is quick and easy, but so is take out. I would definitely suggest the take out, since this dish is kind of mushy, kind of tasteless, kind of why? Sorry to be negative, I just don't get this.

OOOOH YEAH! Now I made some "improvements" (as always). First, I grilled these little poulet parts since it was over 90F and I could not fathom starting up the oven. No problem, they were delectable grilled (as opposed to roasted). I took the advice of other Epicureans and substituted five spice powder for the anise -- good call! Five spice is more complex than straight anise and lends a nice base to counter the acid of the vinegar. I have added my own "tweaking" -- crushed red pepper. This put it over the top. It tasted like the delectable tidbits that you so aggresively gobble up at a dim sum restaurant. So, I think I will chop up the leftover chicken and make dim sum (don't forget the chili sauce!).

This will be the first recipe from your site which I have cooked! I like to cook larger amts. to have leftovers for several days, as I am pat 86 and tire easily. Saves oven time. Cooked a dozen thighs. Yes to longer marinating. They were in fridge for two nights. Toasted aniseed in pan 2 mon. My blendeer not powerful enogh. Next time more aniseed, perhaps 1-1/2 tsp. and whole thing in Cuisinart. Cut ginger in smaller ppcs. yet not completely mashed. Will cook again and try hoisin sauce and a bit of five-spice. Thanks. We enjoyed them with brown rice.

Just wonderful. I didn't have anise, so I subbed in 5 Spice Powder. I doubled the recipe, and added in 2 Tbl. of sesame oil. Very easy. A great dish for entertaining, because all the work is done ahead. You can marinade it longer in the fridge and then just pop it in the oven when ready.

I agree with the other reviewers on the marinating time. I followed this recipe as written and 15 minutes was not long enough for the flavor to penetrate the meat--I suggest at least a couple of hours if not overnight. Next time I'll add a little five spice powder (my favorite new spice mixture).

Was looking for something different to prepare chicken thighs (skinless) and found this recipe on epicurious. Had all the ingredients except aniseed; which doesn't matter because we don't like anyway. I added a tablespoon of hoisin sauce in a double recipe. I felt it created a richer texture, flavor and color. Also added ground pepper. Chopped garlic and gingeroot and added to liquid ingredients vs. puree. I marinaded chicken at room temperature in a glass bowl w/cover for three hours. Truly enjoyed.

I made this exactly according to the recipe and it was delicious. Marinate it in a zip lock baggie for a couple of hours in the refrigerator. Good company food as it requires no last minute preparation.

I added 1/2 tsp. pepper and marinated overnight in the fridge. 15 minutes was nowhere near long enough in our view. 2 hours at room temperature will work, too.

This dish was easy to prepare for a week night and quite tasty. I omitted the aniseed as I didn't have any on hand. Next time I'll try it as written. I served this with a chinese noodle salad.

Would like to try this again making some adjustments. I found the annis seed to be very overpowering - as did my guests. Next time I'll, at the very least, HALF it or perhaps leave out all together. I also used skinless, boneless thighs and didn't like the "look" of the thighs after baking. Perhaps a quick minute or 2 under the broiler (with skin on) prior to serving would improve the presentation. Worth a second try!

I removed the skin and trimmed the fat from the chicken for a healthier version. I quadrupled everything, and it's a good thing I did. They went over big time.

YUM-YUM!! Wow, I did not think that this recipe was going to turn out as good as it did! It reminded me of the Foil Wrapped Chicken served as an appetizer in Chinese restaurants. Next time I think I'll try wrapping each piece of chicken in foil to see if I can capture even more of the tenderizing moisture.

This was a very fast and easy dish. My husband loved the asian flavor. I served it with steamed rice and chinese style steamed vegetables. Next time I am going to use skinless chicken breasts and try it as a grill marinade.

Very aromatic dish that tasted great. Was served with chinese noodles and steamed vegetables. Simple to make. I will definitely try this one again.

I have prepared this receipe twice, once with chicken, once with salmon. I liked the salmon even better than the chicken; I used the remaining marinade to baste the salmon while broiling it.

Very Tasty! This dish has wonderfully sweet ginger overtones that aren't overbearing. Serves well with Eggplant Gratin, or Asian Eggplant.

Fabulous! The marinade produces crispy skins on the thighs, even with the short marination time. I also used this marinade with salmon on the grill, it had a nice ginger flavor.
