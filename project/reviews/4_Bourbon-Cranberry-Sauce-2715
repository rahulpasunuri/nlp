Loved this! 'Course, I added a few things: finely diced fresh ginger (to taste), couple teaspoons orange zest. As another reviewer suggested, I used 1 cup white sugar, and 1 cup light brown sugar. Oh, and I didn't have bourbon, so I added rum instead, and it came out great!

This was really good. Even the kids ate it at thanksgiving. Highly recommend

I served this more traditional cranberry sauce alongside the Cranberry Relish with Apple Cider from Epicurious. It thought this was a very nice cranberry sauce (and incredibly simple to throw together), but the relish really stole the show.

It was too syrupy in texture and flavor when I followed the instructions the first time. Oven roasting *uncovered* made a lovely, chunky texture. We like a bit more kick so changed the spices: 2 c brown sugar, 1 tsp ginger, 1 tsp cinnamon, pinch of salt, 1/4 c fresh squeezed lemon juice instead of the bourbon gave it a nicer balance of sweet and tart.

Hands-down the best cranberry sauce I've made. Super-easy and soooo delicious. I subbed brown sugar for half the white sugar, and Maker's Mark for my bourbon. It had such a great depth of flavor and received rave reviews all round the table.

Wow...a lot of sugar, but this is the best cranberry sauce recipe! Couldn't believe how easy it was to make for Thanksgiving last year. This will be on my menu every year!

This sauce was incredibly easy to make and was really quite flavorful. My guests really liked it, coming back for seconds. Even the kids liked it. It didn't have a gelatinous texture and it wasn't very watery. It had a good consistency.

Everyone begged for this recipe - even my mother-in-law! Fantastic, and definitely will be on the menu for next Thanksgiving. I used Maker's Mark, both brown and white sugars, and the full amount of cinnamon. Delicious!

I love this recipe! I use brown sugar instead of white sugar and sometimes when I don't have bourbon I substitute it with scotch.

Wonderful! I make this EVERY year for the holidays.

Like the other reviewers, I used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 regular - perfect. After the addition of Jack Daniel's my kitchen smelled like a bar - but it gracefully mellowed with time. My husband, who insisted that he doesn't like cranberry sauce has now been reformed and was recently caught spreading the leftovers on his toast. So simple!

Great recipe. Super easy. I make it every year. Try it with rum instead of bourbon.

I love this recipe and will be making it again for Thanksgiving this year. I believe the success of this recipe is the cooking method, baking, rather than the ingredients which are common to most cranberry sauce recipes. The baking is gentler on the fruit so more of it stays whole and then seems to 'candy' itself somehow. Using brown with the white sugar also seems to create a depth of flavor that we really enjoy.

The very best cranberry recipe by far! Different bourbons givedifferent flavors, I prefer Jack Daniels (Black). I am not allowed to come to Thanksgiving dinner without it for some years now. But there is one family member (you know who you are) who has his own version. 1 cranberry, dropped into a fifth of Jack Daniels, then he gets sauced.

Best. Cranberry. Sauce. Ever. A family request (or should I say demand!) for years now.

I finally found it--a cranberry sauce I actually like. And so simple to make. For a 12 oz. bag of cranberries, I used about 1 1/4 cups of sugar and the full amount of cinnamon and bourbon. I'm still enjoying it with my leftover turkey and brie sandwiches.

this is fantastic! never actually had fresh, real cranberry sauce before, and it was worth the almost no effort to make this. it would also be very good without the bourbon.

I've never been a fan of cranberries, cranberry sauce, or cranberry-related products, but I love this sauce. I also use brown/white sugar mix, and a splash more bourbon. I cook it on the stovetop - super easy, no boil-over problems, and I can monitor texture.

Like everyone else, I found this recipe (don't like cranberry sauce myself) and now it's a must-have at Thanksgivings! My friends (and fiance) insist on me making the cranberry sauce for every Thanksgiving. And so simple I don't even have to try.

My husband said these were absolutely the best cranberries he'd ever had! Very, very easy. I cooked them in a corningware dish that I very lightly sprayed with Pam, and it was a cinch to clean up. I will never use another cranberry sauce recipe again!

Everyone loves it and must be made every thanksgiving!

Oh....my...G*d. These are without a doubt some of the best cranberries I've ever made. They're terrific! After reading about some of the bubble-over problems I made them in my Cuisinart saucier, which is deeper than a glass baking dish and has a lid. This worked well except it required a longer cooking time. I used a 2" stick of canela (Mexican cinnamon) rather than grd. cinnamon, as well as a vanilla bean. Scraped the bean and threw beans and pod into the pot to cook. Used Maker's Mark whiskey instead of bourbon because I had it on hand. The meal was suberb, but the cranberries were the hands down favorite of everyone there.

Made this for Xmas last year. YIKES! Everyone got a whiff of the bourbon from a mile away and complained that it would probably knock a cow over. I read the recipe out loud for my sister to follow since I was busy but she unfortunately DOUBLED the bourbon for the recipe, misunderstanding me. Strangely enough, there was barely 1/2 a cup leftover. A surprising and surefire hit!

Perfectly delicious, and easy as could be. Wouldn't recommend it to those who aren't bourbon fans, though.

The 1/4 c. of bourbon was perfect! I was concerned that the cinnamon would overwhelm the dish, but these were beautiful and delicious. I think this will be my recipe for the rest of time.

This cranberry sauce was the absolute hit at our last Thanksgiving dinner. Every single one of my 13 guests asked for the recipe. I added 1/2 cup of water in the beginning to make it a bit saucier, and it was absolutely perfect!

I'm making this for the second year now. I thought I didn't like cranberry sauce but it was the orange and the nuts that I didn't like. One hint, if you have a deep 10 inch non-stick ovenproof skillet - it's a lot easier to hold/clean than a 9X13 pan. Mine worked great plus it has a nice tight lid so I didn't have to mess with foil.

Rating: 4
This was a big hit! The great thing for me, as the cook, was in the ease of preparation--just throw it into a pan, and nothing to think about! I made two batches last time--one which followed the recipe exactly, and the other with orange peel and chopped walnuts added. Both were delicious! And the cranberries come out with such a clear-red jewel color...

The best cranberry sauce I've ever had, and super easy! Have been making this every year since I first discovered it here. The first year, I followed the recipe to a T, and my fiance and brother (die-hard canned cranberry sauce fanatics) were both totally amazed and couldn't get enough. Subsequent years, I've experimented with adding a little extra Bourbon, but I don't recommend this. The bourbon taste can get overwhelming easily. I recommend following the recipe exactly. Also, I don't have much trouble cleaning the dish - just soak in hot soapy water as soon as it's emptied. You should DEFINITELY make this dish.

Rating: 3
I made this for Christmas and it was wonderful. I used 1 cup granulated sugar and 1 cup dark brown sugar (packed) which gave it a nice flavour and a slightly syrupy consistency. Still very tart but good. Next time I make it I will try it with only brown sugar.

Pretty good. I made this recipe because I am a fan of bourbon, but the addition of bourbon didn't live up to my expectations.

I made this for thanksgiving dinner and I just don't get al of the rave reviews. I thought that the taste was just OK, but not nearly as good as the usual cranberry sauce that I make with a little added lemon or orange peel. I think that the cinnamon was overwhelming. I do agree that baking the sauce was easy.....but cleaning the baking pan was NOT! I would rather make the sauce in a nonstick pan the next time around.

Just made this last night and it was a cinch and so delicious!! (My husband couldn't wait for it to chill and had a bite warm). He supposedly doesn't even like whole cranberry sauce! He loved it! Only problem I had was a slight boil over in the oven. Had to turn it down to 250 for the last 20 mins.

An excellent, elegantly simple cranberry sauce with very grown-up overtones. Don't get too enthusiastic with the bourbon, though, as it will make it runny. Brown sugar and white sugar together works very well with this recipe. I'll make it every year.

This is the best recipe for cranberry sauce that I have ever made, and it is so easy! I used 1 cup granulated and 1 cup brown sugar and increased the bourbon to 1/2 cup. It is wise to have a foil lined cookie sheet under the baking dish the last half hour as it may boil over.
