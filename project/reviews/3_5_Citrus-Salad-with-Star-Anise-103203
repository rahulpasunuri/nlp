This is the first bad recipe I've made from Epicurious in a long time. I love all the ingredients, but the flavor was too medicinal when mixed together. The previous poster was right about having good knife skills - and you'll need a lot of patience to make it look pretty. Even then, the presentation couldn't convince us this was worth eating.

Served this as part of a Holiday lunch with Balsamic Sticky Ribs, Roasted Lemon/Garlic Chicken ("Lebanese Chicken"), Lemony Potato Salad. Thought that a light, citrus dish would counter the heaviness of the lunch - and nobody touched it! I loved the leftovers, but it didn't strike the right chord with the fam. Important note: Knife skills and presentation are key with this dish. My loving hubby got our 95-year-old grandma involved with the preparation of the citrus fruits. (I know, I know... I was in the shower...) So, as you can guess, the dish was a mangled mess of grapefruit shreds. But what can you do? Sometimes the holidays force us to look the other way. Unfortunately, though, so did all the guests while passing through the buffet line! I'll give it two stars, though I admit user error played a part.

This was very good, but make sure to save the juice--it was too sweet for me. Even the kids thought it was, and this was with the grapefruit! Mixed up some of the juice and it was great.

I made this a day ahead for a holiday brunch and served it in 4 oz ramekins. Without any prompting everyone ate it at the end of the meal like a palate cleanser and declared it delicious. I simmered the syrup for 5 minutes.

Wonderful! This is a great make ahead brunch dish.

Good, but nothing special. I used the recommended amount of anise seeds, but would recommend more to strengthen the anise flavor. Also, I never can manage to cut citrus fruits from the membranes in a neat, presentable way, so I would never be able to serve this to guests. I used only two grapefruits because that is what I had on hand, and thought the proportion was just fine.

I love this recipe. I have made it for breakfast/brunch several times, for holidays or when we have guests staying with us. The flavors are simple and refreshing, but a little unusual. It is always gone within the day.
