Outstanding dessert - got rave reviews at New Year's dinner party! I used purple apricots as plums weren't available - a bit tart but a nice contrast to the crumble and in keeping with the recipe in taste and color. The almond paste I bought came in a 7 oz package, so I used all of it in the crumble (there can never be too much almond for me!). For the crumble, I also increased the butter to 8 tablespoons and used about a cup of sliced almonds for extra crunch and visual appeal. As suggested by others, I added about 1/2 T of cream to the dough for the crust and that allowed it to come together perfectly. Otherwise, followed the recipe strictly. It was a beautiful presentation, and I served it with vanilla gelato - delicious! Highly recommend - especially for almond lovers! I look forward to experimenting with other fruits, as this seems to be very versatile. A bit time consuming, but easy and worth the effort!

Just made this for my boyfriend and myself. Used pluots (I think it is a plum-apricot cross) since I had a bunch to use up, and skipped the crust altogether. Just made more of the crumble part and used that as both the base and the topping. Easier and quicker!!! Mmmm. Then I put a little lavender flavoured honey on top!

This was very good. If you like marzipan, then this is the pie for you! It was a little too sweet and a little heavy on the almond flavor for me. Next time I make this I'll probably cut back on the sugar and almond paste in the topping, the crumble had excellent texture, though. The plums added a slightly tart backnote in this pie and I would have liked the flavor to have been more present. I think this would work well for sour cherries too.

Delicious combination of nutty marzipan and tart plums.

Got rave reviews from everybody. Used a combo of plums and nectarines

This is yummy. Was out of almonds so I used pine nuts in the crust and the crumble (ground the pine nuts) . For the filling I used turbinado sugar instead of granulated. Prior to baking I sprinkled some ground cardamom on top.

The crumble is amazing. However, the plums tasted quite bitter. I will make this again, but try berries next time around. Plums were far too bitter.

The cumble topping is wonderful. However, the plums had quite a bitter taste. I think I will make it with berries next time. Not a huge fan of the plum flavor here.

This was very good...I have to admit I used blackberries, raspberries and peaches rather than plums.

Rating: 4
Yup. It is good, like everyone says. Can't wait to make with blackberries when those are in season. My husband is licking his plate as I type.

This tart is outstanding. The first time I planned to make it, I couldn't find plumbs so I used a combination of fresh blackberries and raspberries. It's such a smash hit everytime I make it, I'm not sure I'll ever get around to using plums. Doesn't seem to matter what fruit you use, this recipe is a winner.

I have made this tart many times, substituting pears for plums just as good. I add dried cranberries for color. It's a keeper.

Fabulous! This is just Magnificent. The crumble has a sweet nuttiness and The crust is easy to make. it is even better the next day.

I very much liked but boyfriend thought too sweet. Have made twice. Changes: 1) use little less than .5 c. sugar in filling, and maybe more fruit (plums, nectarines, pears); 2) crumble: use little less almond paste (~1/3 c. instead of 1/2 c); 3) use little less sugar in crumble (minus 2 T); 4) maybe add 1/4 c. oats; 5) don't necessarily use all of crumble; 6) don't underbake, should bubble a little; 7) I preferred it cold from fridge

This is one of my favorite summer dessert recipes. It works well with any summertime fruit, or combination of fruits. The Marzipan Crumble is exceptional. We make it often when we're camping -- it works very well in a Dutch oven over a campfire. The result is heavenly!

This crust is so amazingly delicious that I often make double the crust recipe,(I like thicker crusts when I'm making a tart). I use about 1 and 1/2 times the dough for the tart and make some cookies out of the remainder. I think some of the other reviewers that had trouble with the crust falling apart either used tart pans that were too large, or didn't get the crust sufficiently cold enough (freezing for 20 minutes works perfectly) before putting it in the oven. Many combinations of fruit work in this, and I just made it for the first time with really ripe Bartlett pears! Absolutely amazing and beautiful to look at!

This is really a beautiful, delicious dessert. I had a little bit of trouble with the crust, though- it was like cookie dough; very soft and sticky (but it was 105 degrees out and the kitchen was quite warm), so I put it in the freezer before baking (and baked it with pie weights). Also, I made sure to drain the plum filling before filling the tart shell. I am a marzipan afficionado, and I really loved this tart.

This is truly a perfect dessert without a single change made!

Was going to make this recipe May 8th for Sacramento County Fair last week(original recpies not required)Went to store- no plums in market yet. Used combination dried fruits apple, pear, apricot, cramberry, cherry. Used recipe for harvest tart for filling, using cherry brandy. Got a blue ribbon!!

I have used the marzipan crumble on lots of things besides the plum tart and everyone loves it. I haven't tried this crust recipe but I have used a crostata dough recipe and used pears and raspberries or blueberries together, raspberries or bluberries separately in addition to using it with plums. Also, since my children don't like nuts, I usually leave the sliced almonds out and it is still really good!

I was very impressed with this dish. I also ran out of plums (they weren't in season) so i substituted nectarines on one side of the tart. Both sides were really great.

Excellent and so adapatable. I used a combo of plums, plumcots, and a nectarine that was in its prime. Per another reviewer, I added extra cream to the crust to make it hold together. I had no trouble. Plus, it comes out of the oven looking professional. Great presentation.

Rating: 4
Very impressive and so very delicious. I highly recommend this desert. My guests loved it and asked for the recipe. This recipe is a winner and I will definitely make it again and again. When plums are out of season, I may try making this desert with fresh peaches. I think the marzipan will be a nice compliment to peaches.

I thought this was a quick, easy, tasty tart - nice for a summer picnic, but I agreed with the reviewer who found it more cobbler-like than tart-like. Maybe I went wrong somewhere, but I didn't think it was outstanding. The flavour and textures were well matched. I would make it again, for an informal occasion. I found the marzipan too sweet and cut back on that a bit. I also baked it somewhat longer to get the glaze to bubble.

This tart tastes as good as it looks and it looks fantastic! Can't wait to make it again, the topping was easy and wonderful. Everytime I see the picture in the magazine, I remember how beautiful the finished tart looked and tasted.

What a great way to use late summer plums. I did have to add an extra 1/2T cream to the crust to get it to hold together. The tart turned out wonderful and a scoop of Breyers natural vanilla ice cream was a perfect accompaniment.

I thought this was great and didn't have a crumb left over. I had to add foil to edges to keep crust from burning. Does any one have any suggestions as to how to keep the crust from getting so crumby? Although this tasted great, mine turned out more like a cobbler by the time I served it out of the tart pan: my crust sort of fell apart. No one seemed to mind though: I served it cobbler style with fresh whipped cream.

I made this tart and brought it to a party that had many wonderful desserts to choose from. This was defintely a winner, it disappeared in moments. It was very easy to make and looked as good as it tasted. This recipe is a "keeper". I'll definitely make it again.

Superb. Mine needed about ten extra minutes of baking time and the filling never "bubbled thickly." I'm not sure I needed all the crumble topping, utterly delicious though it was. I should have eaten more of the crumble raw--it was tough to resist. Crust too, is especially delicious. I was unsure how high the sides of the tart pan needed to be, but the standard one with sides about an inch high accomodated it perfectly. This is one of those recipes that makes one appreciate the food processor. Really a great recipe.

I have spent my adult life beleiving that I was not a fan of plums, now I am beginning to wonder what I've missed. Don't change a thing, this was absolutely fantastic! (I did have to cover the edges of the crust with foil before I put it in the 2nd time...depends on your oven).

This is one of the best desserts I have made. I thought it was even better the next day, cold. I will definetly make this many more times.

I fell in love with the topping!! The warm plums were okay though the tart tasted better the next day, cold from the refrigerator. I so loved the topping that I used it again over a cherry pie -- delicious!!

This was a delicious dessert. I will most certainly make it again. I could not find any plums that I was happy with the day I decided to try the recipe. Instead I found some wonderfully fragrant nectarines and used them instead. The tart turned out amazing! I highly recommend this recipe.

Amazing contrast of plum tartness and marzipan crumble sweetness. Plum and almond - a natural pair. Looked great on a 4th of July buffet. A big hit.
