We make this every year for a candlelit Christmas Eve dinner... it is a never-fail delicious and gorgeous meal. I have found you can make the sauce through the first step weeks in advance and freeze it, then thaw in the fridge overnight and finish it with the steaks. Everyone who has ever tried it loves it. So grateful for this recipe.

try the Beef tenderloin with port sauce & gorgonzola. WAY Better than this! This was a HUGE disapointment compared to that recipe!

OMG! This sauce is so good and soooo easy. I love the fact that it's simple, fast and doesn't require a cart-full of ingredients I tripled the recipe to serve with beef tenderloin cooked in the oven. The sauce did take forever to reduce. So is it suppose to reduce to 1/3 as one person wrote, or 1/3 cup? I just reduced until it thickened and using the pan juices at the end helped. That port wine adds such a wonderful flavor.

This is an amazing recipe, full of flavor. I served it with fingerling potatoes, a spring mix, feta cheese salad and stuffed mushrooms. The sauce is surprisingly easy. I did not have shallots. So I substituted garlic and onions.

I wish I could give this recipe five forks because is it EASY. It's the perfect sauce when you want a special sauce but only have 10 minutes. Even better, it's so easily memorized that you hardly need a recipe. This will become a staple.

My wife and kids were out tonight when I got home. The only thing to eat in the house was a small piece of beef tenderloin way back in the back of the freezer. I went looking for a recipe and this was the one that I had the most of the ingredients. I lacked the beef broth and shallots, but I had scallions. It turned out very well. The sause was very nice and would have been better with the broth in it. I will definitely make it again. Beware, tho, it does make a mess.....

The sauce is fantastic! Very good depth of flavors.

This was good, but the Tenderloin Steaks with Cranberry-Port Sauce and Gorgonzola blows it away. I will stick with that recipe when I'm looking to combine Port wine and steak. It was quite easy to make. My sauce reduced as quickly as the recipe said - I imagine it depends on the surface area of the pan; I used a skillet. I picked out the Rosemary sprig, but didn't strain the sauce; I like shallots!

Made with TAWNY port, not RUBY, so am not rating it. It was ok, but nothing special. The cooking directions for the steaks were right on target. Got a very nice sear using a regular (as opposed to nonstick) skillet.

Love this recipe. The reduction does take longer than what the recipe calls for but it smells so good that I don't mind at all. I usually saute some mushrooms and put them on top of steak and sauce. I usually serve this with little roasted potatoes and steamed green beans. My go to elegant dinner.

I make this every Christmas. The only additon I add is to buy demiglace to help finish the sauce. It is incredible!

I just made this for the first time and it was quite delicious. Served it with seasoned roasted baby potatoes and a local delicacy - fiddleheads. The only thing I would note is that it took considerably longer than 12 mins to reduce, so you can either not reduce quite so much (still lots of flavour), or definitely double as others have suggested. Bon appetit!

This is a lovely reduction sauce. I would recommend making twice the amount of sauce for 2 steaks and leaving the chopped rosemary out at the end. I am a fan of the herb, but I take a tip from another recipe and add a wedge of boursin cheese to the top of the steaks while they rest. It begins to melt and when the reduction sauce goes over the steaks before serving you'll find the flavors are perfect. I most often make the sauce the day before and just bring it to room temp before using to deglaze the pan. As far as the steaks, this is the way I typically do them...so easy and delicious. You'll find that the sauce will be your go to wine reduction. Enjoy!

I only reduced to a little less than a cup of sauce because I was hungry and impatient and it still tasted great. Also, I used london broil instead of tenderloin because I don't even think they sell tenderloin in my neighborhood and even if they did I'm a poor college student. Nice comforting food with mashed potatoes and peas.

I'd give this three and a half forks...totally delicious! Make sure to cook the meat perfectly, and you can't go wrong. The sauce is wonderful. We served it with garlic mashed potatoes and a simple green salad and drank with a merlot. Also, was very quick. Highly reccommend!

Rating: 4
The sauce makes this recipe a totally worthwhile endeavor. I made this on a Friday night and had no shallots, so I substituted sweet Peruvian onions and a happy helping of minced fresh garlic. I used fresh rosemary from our herb garden rather than dry. And I combined a run-of-the-mill California ruby port with an affordable Merlot (Five Rivers, Sonoma). Granted, it did take a bit longer than advertised to do the reduction, but it turned out absolutely delectable over a grilled (rather than broiled) beef tenderloin steak. I'll definitely make this again. The sauce I ended up with had a nice-but-not-overly sweet taste (perhaps due to the Peruvian onions) and I'll be curious to see of shallots make a significant difference.

Very nice, made with port. I just want point out, sort of funny how people went ballistic when a person suggested using cooking wine, but no one picked up "redneck gourmet's" thrifty suggestion of using M.D.--Mad Dog 20/20. I was tempted to try just so I could say I've done it.

I think that the obvious error in this recipe involves the reduction of the sauce. It most likely was supposed to read "reduce by 1/3" to to 1/3 cup. I did it this way and it was superb.

Add me to the list of people who loved this recipe. As a 'reduction virgin' I had only heard about the ecstacy of making a sauce from the hairy-armed suitors in their ceramic-tiled lairs on the Food Network. Last night I conscripted one of my dinner guests and long time friends to help me with it and they - including fussy low-sodium Virgo boyfriend - RAVED about the results. I chose not to remove the shallots from the sauce: they added a very pleasant sweetness against the saltier sauce. I did use salted butter and it turned out fine. Without straining the sauce, I ended up introducing the butter to 1 cup, not 1/3 cup, of liquid/shallots. I don't drink port, so the "if you don't drink it don't use it" rule wasn't useful for me. $9.50 got me a great result. I am now wantonly considering indulging in making...a white sauce? a roux? This could be my moral downfall... Will I be considered a loose woman now?!

Rating: 4
This was utterly delicious and is one of my all time favorite traditional red meat sauces. Other reviews have noted that it takes much longer than 12 minutes to reduce the sauce, but my commercial-grade gas range nearly burned this sauce at under 12 minutes (I walked away at minute 10 to answer the phone) and I got less than 1/4 cup concentrated sauce at the 12 minute mark (still very good, but I like a lot of sauce). So I made it again and for those with high quality commercial grade gas ranges, 10 minutes should be more than sufficient to reduce this sauce to 1/3 cup.

Rating: 4
Fantastic! I'd use the sauce again on any red meat. As others have said, it takes much longer than 12 minutes to reduce the sauce and it isn't necessary to reduce to just 1/3 cup to get the wonderful flavors.

Highly recommend. This rich, velvety sauce does justice to a great cut of meat.

Rating: 4
I made this last night for my BF and myself. I forgot to add the rosemary, and it was still a fantastic dish. The reviewer who said that the wine makes the dish is completely correct. I would add to that suggestion a cut of meat which has never been frozen. The recipe should specify to season the meat with sea-salt BUT ONLY right as you are ABOUT TO COOK THE STEAK, not a minute earlier or the meat will go tough on you.

Rating: 4
Wonderful! Tested this on my hubby with filets, in anticipation of serving this at a dinner party with beef tenderloin. It is his new favorite recipe and gets requested often. Did not have port on hand so used a Pinot and a Zin. The wine makes this dish!!! Only use that which you would drink, otherwise you won't be happy. Another tip: I doubled for the dinner party...prepare in two batches vs. simply doubling/combining ingredients, which I did. The flavors were off and not as rich. Otherwise, excellent dish. Garnish with rosemary sprigs to add color.

Great dish. The sauce is what makes it and it is very simple. It is rare you find such a gem that is so easy to prepare. I let it reduce for about 16 minutes rather than 12, and it reduced to about 1/2 to 2/3 of a cup. Anything less would not have been enough. Fabulous!

I really followed this recipe to the T, but also found that the sauce never reduces to 1/3c in 12 minutes. I reduced longer, to that 1/3 c only to discover that it's NOT enough sauce to work with. I added more 2 more tsp butter at the end but just found it tasted literally more buttery and seemed quite oily. A bit of a let down, as the taste of the sauce is really quite good. Any tips towards obtaining a better sauce amount and consistency?

Wonderful sauce. I finished it with 7 tablespoons of cold butter, cut into pieces, right before I served the sauce.

Only two suggestions to add to previous reviews: 1) jazz up the presentation; some green (scallions, fresh rosemary sprigs, etc), attractive uncooked mushrooms, things to contrast with the dark colors; 2) make the sauce a day ahead - it does take a lot longer than listed and I've found the flavors were a little richer.

This is my husband's ABSOLUTE FAVORITE dish. He loves this recipe and goes crazy every time I make it. It is great with grilled asparagus and mashed potatoes. I find the times for reduction are off, so the best thing to do is keep a close eye on the reducing liquid. And Definately use unsalted butter. I used regular once and it was not the same.

The night before making this I served tenderloin roast with peppercorn marsala sauce...one of my favs and our best meal to date, but this one is running neck and neck. The finished sauce is like artwork..a beautiful deep shimmering burgundy with flavor to match. My husband couldn't get over it. He's usually minimal with sauces, but couldn't get enough of this, he kept adding more. I started the sauce while steaming artichokes, and glad I did, because it took me more like 25-30 minutes versus the 12 minutes the recipe stated to reduce to 1/3 cup. This is so good, people will think you had a 5 star restaurant deliver dinner to your house.

The sauce was wonderful. We just served it on broiled rib-eyes.

Rating: 3
I've made this with several steak cuts and it's always a hit. Rib-Eye is my favorite. Just to throw my 2 cents in on the cooking wine issue. Cooking wine is made by adding lots and lots of salt to wine; thus making it undrinkable and allowed to be sold in supermarkets. It should never be used in any dish: ever.

Delicious! The butcher had lovely NY strip steaks which I opted for instead of the more expensive tenderloin, but didn't change anything else. Used a Cotes du Rhone...always a good wine for sauces. Served with garlic mashed potatoes and practically licked the plate clean!

I have made this recipe before and it was awesome. I would make the sauce at least 1/2 day ahead of time, and prepare all side dishes before even thinking of making the meat. Re-heat the sauce and voila' : ) Make sure you get fresh top quality meat from a good butcher.

I have never criticized another reviewer before but I could not let this pass. "Cooking wine" instead of wine and port. Are you kidding? If you are referring to that insipid bottled cr*p you buy in the grocery store, you are nuts. You'll spring for NY steaks but not even a $5 bottle of REAL wine? COOKERS OUT THERE -- Don't go near that stuff. Buy an inexpensive wine and port (or just wine if necessary) if you have to never resort to that stuff.

Wonderful with Ramps instead of the shallots - but they are an acquired taste. I substituted venison for the beef, so the sauce was even better when complementing a drier cut of meat. My buddies gobbled it down! And if you're really short on cash, you can use M.D. instead of the Port, with similar sweetness and alcohol. But NEVER skimp on the butter, or the fresh Rosemary. A Wonderful alternative to burger and fries!

Have made this recipe a dozen times, and always serve it with potato galettes. This is the best general purpose sauce for beef that I know of.

Made this for my boyfriend and my parents. Very, very easy sauce to make... the preparation of it allows time to prepare your side dishes while the sauce is reducing. The only modification I made was that I added a couple crushed garlic cloves along with the shallots, which was wonderful. You've got to use the butter.. I believe it makes a difference. The only problem was that I served the sauce with the tenderloin while it was still really hot (the sauce) and it seemed a bit too runny.. but when I went back for more sauce, and after it had a chance to cool down a bit, it thickened up.. I would reccomend takeing the sauce off the heat (after it is reduced) a few minutes before serving to thicken it up a bit (rather than using arrowroot, etc.). I served this with truffled mashed potatoes (heavenly!) and roasted aspargus and a nice glass of red wine. ahhhh, the good life :) .....

I made this dish as part of my brother's birthday dinner, along w/the Creamy Mashed Potatoes and Green Beans w/Lemon, Walnuts and Parsley, also on this site. Everyone loved this dish. Unfortunately, my budget didn't allow for tenderloin for the party, but I used NY strip steaks and was still very satisfied w/the results. (I'll use tenderloin when it's just 2 of us.) PS to the previous poster - margarine just won't cut it in this kind of sauce. You have to use butter, or don't use either at all. (This, according to my culinary teacher.)

Rating: 4
Wow -- this was the best Epicurious dish I've made. I've done it twice and can't recommend it enough -- the sauce is divine! And I haven't even used butter, but substituted margarine (I can only imagine how good it must taste with butter). I'll offer one improvement suggestion, though: Once you've made the sauce, marinate the steak in the sauce for at least 10 minutes per side. We did this by accident the first time; without it, the steak might not soak up the full flavor of the sauce.

I made this meal for friends the other night and prepared the sauce ahead of time (exactly as the recipe stated, just added minced garlic) - the flavors compliment the beef perfectly.

I made this for company last night and had a fiasco with the sauce--when I boiled it down for 12 minutes, it didn't reduce enough, so I left it on for a couple more minutes and then I was left with no liquid! Anyway, I had to start the sauce from scratch again--this time with not enough shallots left (used two whole ones and two garlic gloves to improvise) and no beef broth (substituted beef bouillon instead). I also used tawny port because that's what I had on hand, and did not strain out the shallots or garlic. Despite my false start, the sauce and beef turned out well and I will definitely make again--hopefully having learned from my mistakes next time. Served with potato-onion cakes and roasted asparagus.

The sauce also went very well with the potato! Simple and Delicious! It took me longer than expected to reduce the sauce, and next time will probably make it ahead and will definitly use homemade stock (it will be even better!)...I used equal parts Wine/Port and I agree, don't cheap-out on the wine!

A simple entree that truly does impress. I used my own beef stock (highly recommended), and a farily price-y Port (not neccesary, but it's what I had on hand). To improve the presentation, I strained the sauce after reducing and finised with 1T of butter to smooth it. After saucing the steaks, I topped them with the cooked shallots and cranberries, followed by the gorgonzola. I wouldn't even think of omitting the cheese, as another reviewer suggested -- it provided a perfect balance to the tang of the sauce.

Very simple and delicious. I agree with other reviewers about swapping wine and port quantities, but didn't find the sauce thin at all, once I added the butter. You really only need 1 or 2 tbs of sauce per steak, so don't be scared to really reduce it before straining.

Rating: 3
I agree with the other reviewers. The sauce was a little thin. I took the previous advice, as well, and traded the proportions of the red wine and port for a slightly sweeter sauce. Also, instead of making individual steaks, I made a tenderloin roast, since I wanted a little less fuss for entertaining purposes. It was delicious, and our guests seemed to like it, although this would not be a good recipe for a beef purist who doesn't like other flavors interfering.

My beau and I are at an impasse-he likes A-1 on his meat, and I like fancier sauces that complement (rather than overpower) meat. We agreed this is wonderful.

I am a personal chef/caterer in Boston, and I have been making this sauce for a good many years. It is a make-ahead sauce, which is unusual. It has a wonderful rich taste, and is only enhanced when the steaks are actually prepared and the sauce hits the pan to bring up the already amazing flavors. Remember to always use fresh rosemary - dry is horrid. My family spends a lot of time in New Hampshire, so we bring what we can to make entertaining simple and terrific. I make this sauce ahead, and serve it with grilled steaks and potato gratin. Drop dead delicious.

After reading the recipe instructions, I changed the recipe a little by reducing the sauce all the way down to approx. 1/2 to 3/4 cup (quite thick & syrupy). After the steaks were cooked & tented with foil, I then put the sauce back in the skillet & added 1/2 cup heavy cream and cooked til thickened.
