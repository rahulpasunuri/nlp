Christmas Eve dinner guests loved this! I am wondering why I can't make it like a traditional tarte tatin in the same cast iron pan. I would use an all butter puff pastry instead of the regular Pepperidge Farm variety. While the ice cream was delicious on its own, we unanimously agreed it competed with, not complemented the tarte.

Small and not totally satisfying, esp esthetically. This is OK for at home, but it's not a show-stopper by any means. I almost felt like I "cheated" by using the puff pastry and everyone could tell). Thanks to the advice on here, I roasted the pears at a lower temp so those came out very well - would def use the pears for something else, like on ice cream. Speaking of, I didn't make the balsamic ice cream but will def try that out some other time.

I find this recipe very perplexing. The flavors were delicious, especially with the Balsamic Swirl ice cream, but the recipe has some serious flaws. The time for cooking the pears is definitely off. I baked them for 1 1/2 hours and if I had baked them 10 minutes more the sugar would have burned. Then baking the phyllo with out brushing with butter was just weird and not very appetizing. I would use the same pear ingredients again (the caramel was very nice) but with a traditional pastry crust. And the ice cream is a must.

This was a very easy and lovely desert. Use fairly firm pears and you must watch the time. Mine were done in 2 hours. The puff pastry really rose but when I put the pears on and drizzled the warm syrup over, it deflated and looked just like the picture. Everyone raved about it. P.S. I didn't have pear nectar so used pear brandy instead. The Ice Cream was a different matter. The ice cream itself was good and easy to make. DO NOT boil the balsalmic vinegar or you will have burnt brittle and a pot that takes forever to clean. Take your time and do a gentle simmer and take off heat before it reaches the 2T stage. It hardens as it cools and you might have to re-heat a bit. The taste however was good. I plan on making it again for a dinner party this week.

This was one of the best desserts I've made in a long time - and so easy! I'm surprised by some of the negative comments. I successfully roasted the pears at 375-degrees for 2 1/2 hours and they were delectable. The ice cream was amazing and a perfect compliment to the tart. My only "oops" was in reducing the balsamic vinegar over too high of heat. My first reduction burned and I had to start over. Once I used a slow simmer to reduce, instead of a hard boil, it reduced to a beautiful syrup. I will definitely make this again! I paired the dessert with a 2004 Chateau les Roques. At $17, this was a much more affordable option than the magazine's recommendation of an $85 bottle. We loved the wine and loved it with the dessert. Everyone at my dinner party raved about this recipe and my co-workers were very enthusiastic about the leftovers today. A definite "four- fork" keeper!

I agree with jmuni.... my pears were burnt after 2 hours at 375 degrees. I thought it was a typo as well. My house smells like burnt sugar, and I am pretty sure I will need to throw away the cake pan.

I'll admit I did not follow the directions completely. I did the pears in a frying pan on top of the stove, took about 20 minutes. I also should have pricked the puff pastry as mine rose quite a bit . It looked a little weird sitting up so high but the flavor was out of this world!

This recipe was fabulous! I followed it to a T and it was great. Not sure why the other reviews found their pears soggy and burned, because mine were great. The pears I started out with were a little under ripe, which might have helped. I loved how the parts that were really roasted brown were just slightly chewy. I didn't end up pouring all of the sauce over the tart when it was assembled, because I didn't think it needed it. I served it with the balsamic swirl ice cream which was a great compliment. Everyone at our Thanksgiving party loved it!

I thought that the pear tarte sounded amazing. I owned all the ingredients. I followed the instructions...which I rarely do. This was a nightmare of a dessert. After three hours, the pears were just a mass of mush trapped in the butter/sugar/corn syrup...kind of like an insect trapped in amber FOREVER!!!!! I would so NOT make this again.

The pears burn at 375 degrees for 2 3/4 hours!!! Did anyone test this recipe? Maybe the temp is a typo? should probably be 275 degrees for 1 hour!! Will try again at new temp and shorter time.
