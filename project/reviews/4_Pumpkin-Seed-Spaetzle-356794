I made a similar version with hazelnuts and toasted hazelnut oil to accompany a recipe for Coq au Riesling - twas very tasty indeed. You can see that recipe here: http://www.thetasteoforegon.com/2010/02/25/coq-au-riesling-with-hazelnut-spaetzle/

This was the best spaetzle I have ever eaten. I didn't find pumpkin seed oil, so I substituted walnut. Otherwise I followed the recipe. The only problem was the amount made was quite small to be considered 8 servings. I made the entire Austrian menu, where the spaetzle was a side for the beef gulasch, and while the beef was plentiful, the spaetzle was sparse. I would double it next time.

Yum. The pumpkin seed oil really adds a great dimension to this recipe. It is the first time I have made apaetzle. I used the ricer. The disk with the largest holes produced spaetzle that looked just like the picture.
