I've tried every recipe for sardines that I could get my hands on and this is by far the best I've come across. The kids love it and it's healthy, high in Omega 3. I did use a whole wheat spaghetti and it made no difference; possibly even better than standard spaghetti - added some earthiness to the flavors. Be careful to buy skinless boneless sardines... pay up for the good stuff. I didn't check the label very well the first time I shopped for sardines and even our cats wouldn't eat the cheap stuff.. I had to toss it.

I won't rate because of subs I made (using what was on hand) but my husband and I would both give it 4 forks. I only had dried dill on hand, so I added fresh thyme and parsley to spoonful of the dried. Didn't have any capers on hand, subbed oil-cured olives, sliced 1/4" thick. Added about a cup of left over tomato sauce to sardines after the 2 min in the skillet. Only added a little of the pasta water to thin the sauce. The seasoned crumbs were incredible on top.

Hubby was very skeptical but 6 year-old was fully on board. Fresh breadcrumbs and capers ( a new bottle) are critical. I skipped the parm suggestion from others but did a tsp of lemon juice and 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes. I agree that 3/4 to 1 cup of breadcrumbs is sufficient. I coarsely chopped the sardines as well. Lots of fresh dill...don't cut back...go for it! Great with a glass of NZ sauvignon blanc.

This is an excellent, frugal dish. I've made it several times and find it quite addictive; I often wind up stuffing myself on it. I love dill and capers and think they pair excellently with the sardines and pasta. I always use less breadcrumbs though only because I don't usually have enough bread on hand, but everything balances well. Strong flavors, a total delight.

Excellent taste, although this dish was not what I expected. I thought there would be more of a sauce instead of the paste it turned out to be. I did add the Parmesan and pepper flakes. I did not have any dill, so added thyme instead, which obviously changed the flavor. Will retry this with less breadcrumbs next time; although I didn't mind the paste combined with the sphaghetti, overall thought it was too dry. Very interesting recipe, and as one reviewer below said, rustic.

Simply dreadful. I followed the recipe exactly as written. The result was a mess. And I love sardines! Stick with sardines (or canned tuna) in a tomato-based sauce, with or without garlic, capers, and olives. But definitely no dill.

This was awesome. The recipe did not say anything about chopping up the sardines, but i imagine it meant to, so I chopped them up. Curious if others have left them whole? Also I might scale back a bit on the breadcrumbs next time, using only 3/4 of the recommended quantity, because I had a bunch left at the bottom of the pan after all the pasta was gone. But this was delicious, and yes, it was my introduction to canned sardines!

In addition to the chili flakes and parmesan, I also added some lemon juice to brighten it up. So good!

I added parmesean to the breadcrumb mixture (fresh bread crumbs from the baker) and it was delicious! This is my second time making it and it's much better this time around with the cheese and a little more salt and pepper. Quick and delicious!

Crazy sounding recipe but it was SO good! We love strong flavors so this was a bit hit. I don't think that the bread crumbs were necessary either. Bland? Wow, I'm surprised anyone could say that these ingredients could create a bland recipe.

Interesting recipe. I've made this a couple of times and it certainly needs tweeking. The bread crumbs arent needed but the capers are great. I added cherry tomatoes with the sardines and find them necessary for sweetness flavour and moisture. The sardines I fry seperately and dont toss as they are so fragile. Also added pepper flakes and topped with lemon juice and parmesan. Really needs the extras or its just too oily and bland. Oh and lots of black pepper!

This is a very quick recipe that I liked far more than I thought I would. It was my first experience using sardines, so I only used two cans. Next time (and there will be a next time) I will use 3 cans, because I found that it actually needed more sardine flavor. I definitely recommend using fresh bread crumbs. They really add to the dish.

Mine came out a little bland, so I added parmeasan cheese and then I loved it. For leftovers, I added some olive oil, red pepper flakes and some parsley. It tasted better the next day.

Simply, and frugally perfect. I did have to buy sardines and hadn't eaten them in a while, but they only cost $1 or so. I used canned breadcrumbs and made up for what I was short with processed Ritz crackers. The briney capers complemented the flavor of the fish and the breadcrumbs gave it that rustic flavor and texture. And I love dill so didn't mind the sweet herb at all. Served as a side with a small grilled steak and green salad and ate the rest for lunch. We loved it. Way more than we thought we would.

My first iPhone recipe, worked very well and even my picky 3-year old grand- daughter loved it.

You will definitely need the extra pasta water to moisten this dish. We don't care for dill so I substituted fresh chopped thyme, about 1 tsp., instead. The sardines sort of start to melt like anchovies and impart a wonderful flavor to the dish. It was rustic and delicious.
