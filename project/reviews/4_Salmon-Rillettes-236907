This is a reasonable start. I thought it was bland before I added preserved lemon and some of the salt brine of the lemons, lots of hot sauce and some of a product called Umami, that is made up of tomato paste, anchovy, more chives etc. I will add mustard or horseradish next time.

I followed one of the suggestions (diojn, lemon juice, and capers) and thought it was excellent.

I thought this was terribly bland -- almost no taste at all. I referred to the Gourmet '94 recipe and added lemon juice and Dijon mustard, and would have added capers if I'd had them, after which it was quite good.

Just as advertised, easy and delicious. Makes great sandwiches or filling for vegetables.
