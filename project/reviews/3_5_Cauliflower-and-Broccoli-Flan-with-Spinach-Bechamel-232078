Great side dish for a group or to have more for later! Have made this several times. Tips? Reserve MORE than the 2/3 cup cooking liquid. We kept at least 2 cups to ensure the thickness we wanted. And, highly recommend 1 pound of spinach along with using organic broccoli and cauliflower. And, you can avoid using so many pans by cooking the spinach in the same pan after the cauliflower and broccoli. And the use that same pan again for the Bechamel sauce - since the veggies are busy cooling! Way easier!

Love this recipe! Just made a couple changes. I just blanch the vegetables instead of boiling for 5 mintues (otherwise too mushy). I add some whole cloves of garlic and a little nutmeg. This recipe gets rave reviews and I am often asked to make it.

very tasty, and make it often. It actually takes more water, I save at least 2 cups water. I also do it all in 1 pan, so much easier. Start with spinach, save that water, then do broccoli and cauliflower, save that water then melt butter in pan add flour, etc. Then follow recipe. I also put in the flour butter mixture about a 1-2 tsps of cayenne for a kick.

This was actually pretty tasty! I think next time after it's done cooking I'll put it under the broiler to bring out more of a toasted cheese flavor. You'll want to put the salt grinder on the table, but other than that this was very good!

Move over Capital Grille. If you are a fan of creamed spinach at steak houses or a fanatic for Oysters Rockefeller than grab your mother's casserole dish! I've made this decadent dish twice-soon to be my signature recipe. It is so tasteful my beau can't put his fork down. I'm new to cooking at 41 but hey- you gotta learn someday. Right? If so, start here!

My teenagers licked the casserole dish clean the first time I made this recipe and now it's a family favorite. Variations include using rutabaga, orange cauliflower (rather than white cauliflower) or celery, but the rutabaga is wonderful!

A superb combination of 3 powerhouse vegetables, and easy to prepare as written, or indeed halved or doubled for a party. I followed the recipe mostly as written, but as others have noted, the dish really begs for garlic and nutmeg, which I added. Also, the bechamel needed a bit more milk. Tip: don't overcook the cauliflower and broccoli in the salted water - they will turn to mush after you bake them for the final 25 minutes.

Pretty good - added some shallots, garlic and nutmeg per other suggestions. The bechamel was very thick so diluted some with extra milk. People definitely liked it but doesn't get rave reviews in my book.

This is delicious, but a little bland, so I added flat leaf parsley, a good 1/2 cup of leaves, to the spinach. OUTSTANDING! Making it for another party tonight.

Shockingly tasty. I was a bit dubious when I read the recipe but read the reviews and decided to try it. Like others, I added garlic and nutmeg plus plenty of pepper. I also made a bit of extra sauce so there was enough to really create the flan. It was a hit at the Thanksgiving day table. I will definitely make it again.

This doesn't really work as an antipasto dish for company because, as is evident in the picture, it basically comes out of the pan like slop, not like a flan in neat piece, at least if you serve it hot as the recipe tells you to. It would be a good side, though, and I actually ate it as a main dish. Salted and peppered the spinach directly rather than the sauce. Added nutmeg, used 1% milk, reduced the butter to 5 T, the flour to 1.5 T, and the bechamel thickened just fine. I upped the cheese to 1 cup, but that was unnecessary, and I wouldn't do that next time

Rating: 3
Tasty. I doubled the sauce. I happened upon bags of organic broccoli & cauliflower florets, but I wasn''t sure how many to get. I only needed 2 packages, but I purchased 3. I used 2% organic milk and unsalted butter for the sauce - very rich. I sautéed 3 cloves of garlic in the butter before adding the flour and probably could have used more. I added a little fresh nutmeg and it could have used more - as well as some more salt, pepper and maybe some time. I will be refining this one.

Despite it's fancy name, I felt that this was just a glorified casserole. As a side dish, the flavor wasn't good enough to warrant the prep time. Also, though I don't doubt that many love to have vegetables smothered in rich creaminess, I prefer them less "dressed up" so that their individual flavors really shine.

Rating: 4
Excellent! Very rich dish. Served with pork. Sauteed Garlic and Onion with Butter. I added a potato, fresh carrot and little leftover frozen peas to the pot. Yum!

I made this dish for Thanksgiving and got lots of compliments. I used the frozen chopped spinach and one head each of cauliflower and broccoli. I also doubled the bechamel sauce. The left overs made a great lunch. I will definately make this again.

A recipe vegtable haters even love! Seriously. I changed the recipe in two ways...one by substituting the better with an alternative like Earth Balance. Secondly, by adding some toasted almonds to the top for a little crunch and nuttiness.

I took the suggestions from the B&B owner and thought it was great -- a nice flavorful gratin. I steamed 1 head cauliflower & 1 head broccoli florets with the cut up stems in the water; used 1 10 oz package cut frozen spinach well drained; infused 1 1/3 cups milk with 1/4 small onion, studded with 1 clove, 1 small bay leaf, 1 small sprig fresh thyme (strain); used 3 tbsp butter & 3 tbsp flour; the 2/3 cup cooking liquid; 1 cup grated gruyere; and topped it with a panko/grated parmesan mixture. The bechamel was the perfect consistency and there was no problem with the vegetables being watery.

I made a few adjustments based on what I had at home (all broccoli, added corn, and used chard for spinach) -- i'm crazy about this recipe! i'll be making it again for my Thanksgiving veggie dish.

Since this recipe was first published in 2005, I have made this many times. My husband is not a veggie-lover, especially not cauliflower and spinach. Yet each time I make this, he comes back for more! I make this dish just as the recipe states; once tried a lower fat version, but it just wasn't the same. As is, this has become a family/dinner guest favorite.

This dish is very easy to make and very good. I have made this dish twice, both times I added 2 cloves of crushed garlic to the bechamel and topped the dish with fried pancehetta bacon. The second time, I made it ahead for a dinner party. I didnt like the dish as much. Preparing ahead makes the vegetables too soft. They were almost too mushy. My guests seemed to like it. This recipe is now in my rotation of comfort foods to feed my family in the winter months and for special occasions.

This ia a delicious, easy to prepare vegetable casserole. The bechamel sauce lightly binds the vegetables together. The broccoli and cauliflower flavors stand out and the dish is not as heavy as many other vegetable gratins.

This is a great holiday dish. Easy to make, easy to carry and delicious. Substituted Locatelli cheese. Even during our Thanksgiving dinner, where there are lots of carbs and vegetables are not front and center, this dish was a hit! I used one head of broccoli and one head of cauliflower and doubled the bechamel and spinach recipe. Have shared the recipe and will definitely make again. Nice presentation in a holiday baking dish.

Rating: 2
My husband and I enjoyed this dish, but not enough to make it regularly or on a weeknight. I think it's more appropriate for a holiday dinner. Also, as others have pointed out, it's not really a flan or even a gratin. It's just creamed vegetables. I used frozen veggies to cut down on prep time and baked it with a parmesan/breadcrumb topping. A light sprinkle of crushed red pepper on the plate kicked it up just right.

Rating: 2
I found this recipe to be too bland, even though I added serious additional amounts of salt, pepper, nutmeg, romano pecorino and monterey jack cheese. My teenagers (who eat everything) thought it tasted like "mac and cheese."

Rating: 3
What a great combination of ingredients! I too, used chopped frozen spinach which I cooked and squeezed dry. Also, I substituted Pecorino Romano for Parmigiano (Romano has a stonger taste and I prefer it). I also added in some Monteray Jack to the Bechemel which made it very creamy. I could eat this all day long. Very deeeeeelicious.

Rating: 3
Although the spinich bechamel was delectable on it's own, I think the flavors of the broccoli and cauliflower (two very pungent veggies) really overpowered it. Instead of letting it get lost in the mix, I tried it a second time, this time adding some sauteed garlic and pancetta to the sauce, which gave it a much stronger flavor that better complimented the flavor of the veggies. It was outstanding that way.

Rating: 4
I have made this dish a number of times with slight modifications and it has been a hit every time. We operate a luxury B&B and Retreat Center, and host many functions. Because some people cannot have wheat, I substitute corn starch to thicken the bechamel. I steam the vegetables with the stems and cores in the water below (that's soup stock). I use shredded mixed cheeses in the sauce and top with fresh parmigiano. I have found that frozen chopped spinach, heated and drained, works better than fresh (even primo baby spinach). Here at Coppertoppe, we appreciate a simple, healthy, delicious recipe!

I wilted arugula instead of spinach. I added Yves Cuisine's Good Ground (veggie ground mince) to make it a one-dish meal.

We cut the broccoli and cauliflower into large florets with plenty of "stem" left on. We also only blanched the veggies. This way we avoided what some reviews called a mushy dish, or an unattractive (hash) looking dish. We cut the spinach to about half and added grated carrot and a topping of melted butter, dry bread crumb and grated parmesan. It was a great dish for Thanksgiving. The vegetables remained crisp/tender and flavorful. Will definitely make again for holiday or pot-luck.

I would definitely make this again. The whole crew licked the bowl clean, making me think I should have doubled the quantities for a group of four. I added nutmeg to the bechamel as well, and would have loved to add breadcrumbs if I had any ready. Great veggies.

Rating: 1
Nothing more than an au gratin dish, as others have said, and one that was unnecessarily time-consuming for the result. I upped the cheese too and used romano instead. The vegetables should be cooked far less than directed (or just blanch them) because they do become mushy. It could definitely benefit from a cheese-crumb topping that gets browned under the broiler. If there is a next time, I'd take more shortcuts (like the frozen spinach) as I don't think the fresh baby spinach is noticeable after cooking and chopping.

Does it really matter if this dish is named flan or some other term? If you want it to puff up, don't see why you couldn't add 2-3 beaten eggs to the milk. Have already made/reviewed this recipe as written, but think I will make it again with eggs. Oh, and to the cook from NYC: After reading your post, I now wonder if you know just who is the real food snob?

I checked several sources, NONE of them mentioned egg (or custard) as a requirement. Here's Answer.Com's definition of flan: flan (fl?n, flän, fläN) n. A tart with a filling of custard, fruit, or cheese. See crème caramel. A metal disk to be stamped as a coin; a blank. [French, from Old French flaon, from Late Latin flad?, flad?n-, flat cake, of Germanic origin.] Food Glossary Flan 1. A round pastry ran that can have a sweet filling (such as Custard or fruit) or savory filling (vegetable, meat or savory custard). The pastry is usually formed and baked in a special flan ring, a bottomless metal ring with straight (about I 1/2-inch-high) sides. The flan ring is set on a baking sheet before the dough is baked. 2. A famous Spanish baked custard coated with caramel. You food snobs make me laugh (and I'm a Franch-trained chef)!

We loved this recipe but I agree with others that it is seriously mis-named. It is not a flan (acutally that was the reason I wanted to make it because the title w/ flan caught my eye). But it is vegis in a delicious cheesey sauce - NOT FLAN

this is no FLAN,it could be called cauliflower and brocoli au gratin,flans have eggs....

Could it be that there's a major omission in the list of ingredients? A flan normally has eggs. This recipe says the flan is done when it has puffed up. I doubt if it would puff up without eggs.

This dish is decent - although a little bland and mushy - as a side dish. But it is delicious as a leftover "ingredient!" In a little oil, the veggies crisp up, and the flavor really comes out! I put a little olive oil in a pan and fried it up, added some leftover chicken, scrambled eggs and parmesan to make a fritatta to die for!

I see all the reviews that say you can make this in advance and reheat, which makes me happy. My question, however, is would this be good frozen/defrosted/reheated? I would even make this for a weeknight dinner, but would love to make doubles - one for that night, and one to throw in the freezer for a night I don't have time to prepare a fresh dinner. Would that ruin it?

I used what I had on hand - some pre-grated parmesan/romano blend from Trader Joe's, light cream instead of whole milk, one bag of spinach, the broccoli and cauliflower as well as 12 oz. of cremini mushrooms. The mushrooms didn't really work and the dish ended up pretty soupy b/c of the lack of spinach. This never puffed up in the oven. Still, with all these things aside - this was really good and has a lot of potential. Next time I may add more spinach, and probably some onions. Three forks up!

I made this together with the Braised Baby Onions recipe as side dishes for a dinner party. Both were excellent. The leftovers the next day, both cold and hot, were also wonderful. I will probably make this for Thanksgiving or Christmas. It is a keeper!

Both my boyfriend and I really loved this recipie. He kept re-heating the leftovers for a few days. Kept cool & covered in the frig, the leftovers always came out fluffy and delicious as many as three days after originally made. I went to my local Trader Joe's and bought one small bag each of pre-cut raw broccoli and califlower. They work out to be exactly the 2 1/2 cups of each vegetable asked for in the recipie. Also, why not just buy a 12-oz. bag of spinach from Trader Joes instead of looking for 2 6-oz. bags? We found this recipie, which I followed exactly the first time, to be mellow and rich with green flavor. I did notice that it took about 10 extra minutes in the oven to achieve the nice bits of browned surface shown in the picture. Would make again, however, allow for prep time, but it's worth it to feed a crowd in one big casserole. I'll add the red pepper flakes another reviewer suggested another time; I know this will go very well with the recipie.

Our family loved this dish. I will make it again and again. I had cooked too much broccoli and cauliflower so made a double batch. It was even more delicious the second day. One change that I made (and it added nice color) was to put finely shaved carrot in......and it was great.

A great dish. All of the vegetable flavors meld together...no particular one stands out, which I think would be great for kids. (Besides, crumbling the broccoli and cauliflower is a lot of fun!) For the bechamel, I used a good few dashes of Tabasco (a la James Beard in his excellent recipe for mac and cheese). Instead of the parmesean, I used my favorite Vella dry jack, sprinkling the top with whole wheat breadcrumbs and extra cheese. The "six servings" served two people--obviously a number of extra helpings were involved. Next time, I want to try to use skim milk and an omega-3 spread in the bechamel...but then this dish might end up being "too" healthy!!

The only change I made was to use one cup of parmesan. We normally prefer spicy food so I thought it might be a bit bland, but it was delicious. I think using a good parmesan is the key, along with plenty of seasoning. Will definitely make again.

FANTASTIC! This was a delicious vegetable dish that I will definitely make again. I did use extra cheese in the mix, and also sprinkled over the top, as well as extra salt and pepper.

Along with the new Braised Baby Onions/Orange Juice/Balsamic recipe (excellent!), I made this yesterday to accompany a prime rib roast. Although delicious, it did not present very well - quite muddled in appearance. I upped the parmesan to 1 cup, used half and half, and added a little salt and a generous amount of fresh cracked pepper. Next time may add some sliced mushrooms and sprinkle top with bread crumbs/parmesan to improve the outward appearance. Still and all, a nice recipe with a very good blend of flavours. Do give it a try!

Makes a very colourful presentation. I have made this recipe twice.....the second time by memory as I was cooking in my sister's kitchen. The only change I did was add some red pepper flakes to the mix. A bit time consuming, but it is something that can be made ahead of time and reheated. Well worth the time and effort....I made this for my Dad's birthday and he was actually very quiet during the whole meal, savoring each and every bite!!!!
