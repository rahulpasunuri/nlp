I loved this recipe as a nice change to the standard pasta salad. The fresh herbs really are the main flavor in this dish. Don't be mislead by the other reviews.

We found this refreshing & clean compared to other pasta salad recipes. Looked for a pasta salad that didn't say "Hello! I'm here I'm the star! Notice me!" This just complimented the entree. Perfect for strong flavored grilled foods!

This is a good basic pasta salad recipe. I use it as a starting point. It's great with a little tuna added, or a little leftover chicken added.

Tried this recipe twice this summer. Both times it came out bland and had to be jazzed up at the last moment with some dried mustard and balsamic vinegar. A waste of good, fresh herbs!

I love this recipe and so does everyone I serve it to. Use different pastas for a change and always fresh herbs.

I have used this recipe repeatedly over the year for summer parties. The key is to use flavorful, high quality pasta- I have had tremendous success with Williams-Somona tricolor fusilli.

After spending what seemed like an eternity mincing herbs, the dish ended up practically tasteless. I served it at a party (unfortunately I didn't taste it before I set it out) and people did eat it, but they definitely picked around the onions.
