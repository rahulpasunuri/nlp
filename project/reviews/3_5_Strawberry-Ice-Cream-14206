I made this using mascarpone instead of cream cheese and added fresh mint. It turned out delicious!

I agree with the other raters that this recipe makes for a cheesecake-y ice cream. I'm thinking you could make these to accompany it: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views /Chocolate-Caramel-Graham-Crackers- 107612 OR, when its almost frozen add some crushed graham crackers right into the ice cream and just cheesecake it up. Upping the sugar content a bit will also help to prevent it from freezing so solidly, but don't overdo it or it will stay liquid. I also like that this recipe doesn't call for 97 egg yolks as many ice cream recipes do. Pretty sure I will be adapting this one to other flavours.

Best and easiest ice cream recipe! I use it as a base to add different berries, depending on what is in season, and even chocolate. It always comes out great!

I loved this recipe! The tangy flavor of the cream cheese balanced the sweetness of the berries beautifully. By the way, adding a tablespoon of vodka to your base will keep the ice cream from freezing solid without adding flavor.

Not the best ice cream I have made. Too hard and strange texture. I will not make it again.

This is a terrific recipe! My family loved it and it was very easy to make. I made it last weekend to use up extra strawberries and am making it again this weekend when we have company! I do agree with others that it is hard as a rock after it is frozen - I microwaved it on low for about 15 seconds and it made the ice cream alot more scoopable. Next time I'm going to try it with blueberries!

This recipe is delicious and easy to make. I used the substitutions recommended by another person (fat-free half and half, etc.) and the results were good. I've made this recipe twice, once with low-fat ingredients, and the second time with exactly the ingredients listed in the recipe, and both times the ice cream turns hard as a rock once it has freezed. A co-worker made this recipe, and he said the same thing happened. I read all the reviews for this recipe, and no one else seems to have had this problem. What am I doing wrong??? We'll just have to eat all the ice cream right away the next time I make this recipe!

This recipe is identical to the 'strawberry cheesecake ice-cream' recipe also on this site, and is a better name for it as the cream cheese flavour is quite pronounced. Very easy and tasty. Next time I will whip the cream and fold it in to see if that lightens the body a bit.

I used this recipe for my first experiment with an ice cream maker, and yes, it's soooo easy and very good too. I would skip the salt, however, since the cream cheese already has a touch of salt and I didn't think the extra salt was needed. I used reduced-fat cream cheese and it didn't affect the taste, as another reviewer commented.

Beautiful color! A definite winner for easy summer fare! Used 1 pound + strawberries, reserving about a fourth for chopped (vs pureed) berries and dropped sugar to 1/2 cup to get to 5 Weight Watchers points per half cup. Tried again 2 days later with non-fat cream cheese -- just as good since it's texture rather than fat the cream cheese contributes -- and now only 3 WW points. We liked it best soft, right out of the processor.

I used closer to a full pound of strawberries, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly and thought the ice-cream was delicious. It couldn't have been easier to make. I over-processed my strawberries and wound up with no chunky pieces in the ice-cream. I agree with a previous reviewer who said they'd prefer some chunks so I'll blend the strawberries less the next time. I'd love to try this with other berries/fruits when they're in season. Blueberries, cherries, bananas seem like they'd go well with the other ingredients.

The best strawberry ice cream on the planet. I followed this reccipe to the letter except I barely blended the strawberries since I prefer them to be a bit chunkier. I made puff pastry "bowls" and "leaves" and served this wonderful ambrosia in the puff pastry bowls and topped each with a crispy puff pastry leaf - Way too easy! (If you want seconds, hide some in the back of the freezer since it will all be gone if it is in site!)

This was really easy and tasted great! I will definately double next time as it only made a quart. The whole family ate it up!

YUM . Quick to make too. A real bonus for last minute planning. Tastes great, reminds me of baskin robbins strawberry cheesecake icecream. I dressed it up by making sugar coookie/ice cream sandwiches dipped in chocolate, but good plain too!

I made this recipe for a family get together and it was a hit. I made chocolate sauce to go on top. I actually made it again, less than a month later, for different company. I love the fact that it does not call for eggs.

I used almost a pound of really ripe strawberries and it had a nice strawberry flavor as well as the cheesecake taste. It also had a really pretty pink color.

Delicious! I, too, trimmed it down by using 1/3 less fat cream cheese,skimmed milk, and no-fat half and half. I don't think there is any way to mess up this recipe

This was really easy, and tasted great! I didn't have cream, so I used 1% milk for both the milk and the cream, and the whole family loved it. It reminds you of strawberry cheesecake!
