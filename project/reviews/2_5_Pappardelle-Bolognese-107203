I'm giving this three forks because I loved the sauce (which I reviewed separately and gave four forks) but this version of papperadelle is what we Jews call a potchki. Now secretly I AM Italian too, so I know what I'm talking about with homemade pasta. Fresh is key to this recipe, so do make it yourself, but in the following manner: 2 cups of flour and 3 eggs with a pitch of salt and a drop of EVOO in the food processor until blended. Let the dough rest while you set up pasta machine. Divide dough in half and run one piece through pasta machine several times, folding in thirds and adding a little flour till the dough is pliable but not sticky. Then keep flattening by running through once at each higher setting until you get to the highest or second-highest, depending on what your roller is like. Roll up the sheet of dough jelly roll style and cut off one inch sections with a sharp knife. Unroll each section and repeat with the other piece of dough. Ta da - takes about 20 minutes this way, so you can do it after your sauce has already simmered for a while, and you are waiting for the water to boil.

Very flavorful pasta. My guest kept commenting on how the noodles were exceptional... I love Mario Batali's recipes... if you like this you should also try his pizza dough made with white wine!

Simmered the sauce for four hours or so and I think it really made a difference. It was silky and the flavors were deep and intense. I added an extra can of tomato paste and was generous with the wine. The instructions for the pappardelle seem intimidating--don't be put off by them! It was my first time making pasta from scratch and it turned out amazing--the extra time is worth it and I found the work to be barely labor-intensive at all, just make sure you're not rushed. Worth the time and planning!

obviously alot of folks here think Olive Garden is REAL Italian food. This recipe was fabulous! I too double the recipe to have an extra batch to freeze!

How could anyone not love this???? OMG, I have made this countless times, it is wonderful. Follow it exactly. I always make a double batch, it freezes wonderfully. It's a great dish to make at a large family gathering, you just boil the pasta, heat up the sauce and have a salad. Perfecto!

Yes, add the nutmeg. I used diced tomatoes instead of paste, left out the garlic (lots of differences of opinion about garlic in bolognese, I defer to Hazen) and it was wonderful! Not at all bland, but then, I cooked it for 5 hours, as it should be. Long, slow cooking is what is going to bring out the flavor.

Favolosa! Italian Cooking at its best...maybe you American critics would be happier at the Olive Garden!

Have any of you nay sayers ever been to Italy??? Can your taste buds not detect subtle? You must be used to the heavily over-sauced, nothing-subtle-about-the seasoning, gargantuan-sized pasta dishes that pass for Italian in this country. This is lovely, dish. Period. P.S. Add the nutmeg, as Marcella Hazan suggests.

Stop!!! Do not waste your time making this recipe! It tasted so bland, I ended up adding another can of tomatoe paste, 1/2 a can of beef broth, oregano, basil, and more garlic to give it some taste. I won't be wasting my time or money on this recipe again.

While this sauce is okay, other reviewers are right- the September 2002 Bon Appetit Papperdelle Bolognese is more robust and flavorful.

Stop! Don't make this recipe. Go to the September 2002 of Bon Appetit. There is a recipe for pappardelle bolognese that is out of this world.

I didn't make the sauce, as this was a weekday meal for me so I used purchased sauce from a local deli. The pasta was a lot more work than what I would usually do, what with the folding and feeding and folding and feeding. The difference was very noticable in the finished product though. It had a much better texture than other pastas I've made. Yes, it was more work than usual but it did make a positive difference to the quality of the dish.

I didn't make the pasta (we have an Italian specialty store that sells it fresh) but the sauce was smoky and wonderful; lots of oomph. We don't eat veal so I substituted ground round; happy to find a great meat sauce that doesn't rely on garlic to carry it through (though we love our garlic!). This meat sauce is a keeper.

Making your own pasta is NOT a lot of work! This recipe makes it seem that way, though. Pasta is a very simple ratio: 1 egg per 3/4 cup flour, figure 1 egg per person. You need not do it with the "well" method. Put your flour in a food processor and add the egg. The only time the food processor doesn't work is if you are making pasta for 1 person. I make a 2-egg batch all the time and I bet I'm done 10 minutes before those who use the well method. It's really that easy!

I found this recipe too complicated for the amateur cook...I suggest adding some salt to the pasta dough, which will take away the blandness. I've always made my pasta with salt, in a well of flour with egg. It is the best way..forget the food processor unless you're making a very large batch.

Making pasta is not for sissies!! Sorry folks! Yes, this is time consuming but making any pasta from scratch is a lot of work! Gotta love the task, and have the time...otherwise use BArella! Did try the suace, so can't give my 2 cents!

Umm. I don't really think we should really take the 1 other person that gave this 3 forks seriously. They were either "on the sauce" or into the "pot".

Hey everybody!!! The(all of two)people who actually prepared this particular recipe actually rated it highly!

To Evelyn Kantautas, you can find the Bon Appetit recipe in the "Constant Comment" section under recipes on this website. You will probably come to it before you come to the one from Gourmet.

Gary . . . Mario Batali is a WANNABE chef??! He is, in fact, a chef. Perhaps you don't think highly of his cooking, his restaurants, or his success, but don't say he's not a chef. Perhaps you could have used words like "over-rated," "commercialized," and "excessive." You might have even called him a culinary Svengali -- but "wannabe" is a lazy person's word, and not applicable to a person who actually is a chef.

You got to be kidding. Anyone with a job or for that matter a life doesn't have time to waste on this wannabe chefs creation. Takes too long to read, takes too long to prepare and takes too long to clean up the mess. For the effort it was a great waste of good food.

I think the recipe the person is referring to is in the AUGUST 2002 Bon Appetit, it is pasta with sausage and tomatoes. Go to epicurious.com, and in the search box type in bolognese. The recipe will pop up in the list. Interestingly, this pappardelle bolognese is no longer accessible by the usual channel. I hope you get this email info! PS This recipe was in Gourmet, not Bon Appetit. I stopped by subscription to Gourmet because they dumbed it down. You should try Bon Appetit, it's like the old Gourmet. And the recipes aren't particularly labor intensive. Give it a try, Dave

Why would this website ever bother to feature a recipe like this in their "Epicurious Recipe Flash"? You'd think all the feed back might mean something

Made this exactly as written....boring, bland and a big waste of time. It tasted like something frozen from Stouffer's...no, think Stouffer's would have done better.

I must be missing something. Although this dish tasted just fine I couldn't help thinking that I had just made a very expensive American Chop Suey - what a disappointment!

The picture looked beautiful, the ingredients sounded awesome and I love pasta, but it was just so-so. Maybe I overchopped the veges. My sauce came out looking like regular tomato sauce and didn't taste like anything special. Any suggestions?
