This is super good! LOVED IT! left it marinading since the night before and it was amazing the next day way better than the 1 hour marinade!

This was great. I'd actually give it 3.5 forks. Even my picky two and a half year old loved the chicken (no ketchup!). Lime, rather than lemon, was all I had on hand, so that is what I used, and it didn't seem to make a difference.

This recipe has been the "go to" grilled chicken recipe the last 5 years. I have had nothing but rave reviews. The secret is to use fresh oregano - and to marinade overnight. I have left the chicken in marinade longer (2 nights!) - it's even better. Boneless breasts, I cut in half, and grill indirect medium heat for 5 minutes a side.

This was a great recipe, I marinated it overnight. I think you have to try the recipe as is in order to rate it objectively. You have to use fresh oregano. I also made the tomato compote --another winner.

This is really five forks! Fabulous. Follow the recipe and you will not have any problems. I am surprised how some folks will substitute ingredients and expect good results. Then give the recipe a bad rating. Try it again geek patrol with fresh oregano and fresh ingredients.

I made the marinade as directed except that I used dried oregano instead of fresh. I marinated 4 chicken breasts for 3 hours in the fridge and then broiled them. They turned out utterly tasteless and unappetizing. No one would eat them. Now I am stuck with a bunch of nasty leftover chicken that no one wants to touch, so I have to try and find creative ways to use it up. I would definitely not make this again without some serious tweaking going on.

Made this with thighs instead of breasts. Absolutely delectable; really moist with lots of flavor from the marinade.

taste was quite good, love the unique flavor cinnamon adds - don't be turned off by it until you try it! 4 forks for ease of preparation.

We grow oregano in our garden 6 months of the year and we use at least double the amount called for. This is one of our very favorite easy main courses!

Make it 3 1/2 stars. I prepared it as directed, except that I used 1/2 the marinade for 2 breasts, cut slits in the chicken and let it marinate in the fridge for 1/2 hour before sitting it out to finish marinating for an hour. I thought it was very good by itself and excellent with the compote. Two days later I ate the leftover chicken without the compote and found it to be very good still. Will do again.

Family loved this - I doubled the recipe for 4 breasts and used 2 tbsp ground oregano (no fresh on hand) - YUMMY! The compote was bland and didnt add too much but the chicken is definitely an easy repeat.

A great recipe for a super-fast meal. I have been making this since it first appeared in BA.

My family did not care for this at all. They said that the chicken was bland and didn't have enough flavor. I have a son who eats everything and even he didn't like it. There are too many really great grilled chicken recipes to repeat this.

Time-tested, great combination with the chicken and tomato compote. The key is to use fresh, home-grown tomatoes and to not overcook. I prefer to only make this when I have tomatoes out of my garden - and the fresh oregano.

One of my favourite recipes for entertaining! A majority of it can be prepared before your guests arrive. I cook the chicken on a broiler pan in the oven and still have fabulous results. The compote is definitely the key to this dish.

This is definitely a home run. I've made this now on many occassions and especially if we have "important" company. Make it exactly as the recipe says and make the compote with fresh tomatoes...WOW!

I used dry Oregano as well and it turned out great. Fore those of you thinking "Cinnamon???", it was not over powering and added "dimension", (oooh artsy word ;0) to the meal. The compote was an excellent counterpoint. (oooh another artsy word! This is fun!) I would definitely make this again.

Rating: 3
Chicken came out moist and taste was very good even though I substituted dry oregano for the fresh. The tomato and onion compote was a nice accompanyment for this dish. It was so easy and since grilling season is here I will definitely make it again, this time with the fresh oregano.

Rating: 4
This was fabulous. My husband loves cinnamon, so this is a definate keeper. The compote with it is a must, it completes the flavors. Fresh tomatoes are terrible here now, so I used canned in the compote and let it simmer a little longer, turned out great.

Rating: 4
This simple little recipe produces an outstanding result. The flavors of the seasonings combine brilliantly. I recently have discovered the difference using good quality Hungarian paprika makes, and I would recommend it in this dish. Fresh oregano grows with abandon in my garden, but I chose to make this in January, so I used dried, reducing the amount by two-thirds, and it came out fine. Leaving the chicken at room temperature for an hour worked magic, and I think I will do that in the future every time I use my grill pan. Also, I halved the recipe because there were only three of us, but we were three very happy tasters!

My wife wanted a tasty chicken dish and I found and prepared this. WOW! She loved it and we'll do it again. Had it with a simple tossed green salad and soft breadsticks with garlic salt. Great evening which we accompanied by a good Merlot.

My friend and I loved this but my husband was not as thrilled as we (he said it was "ok"). I made the recipe exactly but it seemed as if the lemon juice was a tiny bit overwhelming - would use a tad less next time. I used tiny cherry tomatos cut in half for the compote, their sweetness really complemented the tangy chicken - I served it with a small springmix salad, crisp french bread, garlic sauteed stringbeans and a curried rice - it was a delicious healthy dinner.

My family loved this chicken. In fact this is the most requested dinner now at my house. I have even varied it, one time we stuffed the marinated chicken with blue cheese and pears, yummy! It's definately worth making more than once!

I fixed this dish for my family (husband and mother). They both absolutely loved it! I also thought it was very good but was not quite as taken with it as they were. The chicken was very moist and tender, and the compote worked very well with the other flavors. Our side dishes were risotto and french green beans with pine nuts.

Rating: 3
The chicken turned out very tender and juicy. I used canned tomatoes and the compote was still delicious. The cinnamon and oregano are a wonderful flavor combination, and the paprika gives it a little zing. My husband said this dish tasted better than something he'd order in a restaurant, which I consider high praise.

Rating: 3
At first I thought the marinade lacked-zing. And I thought the compote wasn;t great (I too added sugar - my winter tomatos weren' the greatest) But when you combine the two elements (chicken and compote) the dish was pretty good! I wouldn't make one without the other. Also, I pureed the compote, spooned it onto plates and served the chicken sliced on top.

I've made this twice now and simply love it, it's brilliant. I can't get red onions for the tomatoe compote here (the compote is essential for this dish) so I used regular yellow onions and sauted them a little longer with a pinch of sugar to add some sweetness. It turned out great.

To the cook from Toronto - here in Connecticut we can get cherry tomatoes all year round & these have a much sweeter flavour than those awful 'winter' tomatoes that taste of nothing. In fact, I often make this very nice recipe with cherry tomatoes, even in the summer, because of the good flavour & pretty presentation.

My family and I loved this dish and I will make it again this week with my grade ten cooking class. My only question: how could it be made during the winter months, without fresh tomatoes? Any suggestions?

At the risk or receiving a nasty remark back from a fellow reviewer I didn't care for this at all. I didnt make the compote so in all fairness maybe that makes the whole dish....if not then this was not to my liking at I would never make it again. The spices might have nor be to be liking

This was only okay--yes, the chicken stayed moist, and the cinnamon added a nice scent while it was cooking, but I didn't think it was overly flavorful. A decent, but bland, middle-American chicken dish.

This dish was so easy AND delicious. My husband especially liked it. I heard mmmmm after every bite. I used more flavorful grape cherry tomatoes and added a splash of Alessi's white balsamic vinegar to the compote. I agree...its a keeper,

This was quick and simple to prepare. I would suggest doubling the Tomato Compote recipe, however, and be SURE not to cook it, just heat it through. I also recommend using only garden ripened tomatoes because the flavor is incomparable and store-bought just would not do. I served it with just picked chard and a rice dish. Very good and healthy.

Rating: 4
Wow! This has just become our favorite chicken recipe. The flavors all blend together sumptuously. Not complete without the compote, which I made with dried oregano and regular yellow onions. The key to the compote is not to cook it too long as stated by another cook. Also added a touch of balsamic vinegar as suggested and it really rounded everything off.

I'm always on the lookout for new grilled chicken recipes, since my kids (age 10 & under) are getting tired of having chicken again. This recipe was a winner!!

Moist, delicious and the cinnamon is a unusual touch that works! Used mesquite chips during the grilling which adds another flavor to mingle with the other great tastes. The only change I made to the original recipe was to use dried oregano for the chicken marinade and used fresh oregano for the tomato-onion compote as the recipe suggests. I used my home grown tomatoes and oregano...YUM. This is a keeper chicken recipe! 8/29/00 UPDATE-I used this recipe for a boneless turkey breast (about 1 1/2 lbs.)on the grill, with great results.

I made this last night for some friends. Wow what a great meal. Served it w/ a saffron couscous, grilled corn on the cob, homemade applesauce, and finished w/ a fabulous Mexican Chocolate Tort. The cinnamon in the chicken marinade is unusual but fabulous, and the tomato red onion compote is a must. This recipe is a keeper, and is very easy to prepare.

I have been making this recipe for years, save the cinnamon, and after trying last night, will continue to omit the cinnamon. Who needs it? I always use chicken leg quarters, as I find boneles chicken breasts to be dry, tasteless and expensive. The leg quarters can be marinated overnight, and while it takes a bit of forethought, it's worth it for both taste and week-night convenience sake. Most importantly, double the marinade recipe, setting half aside. When chicken comes off the grill, baste with reserved marinade and cover for a few minutes before serving. Makes all the difference in the world.

I was really pleased with how easy and tasty this recipe was. I'm always looking for a marinade that doesn't require sitting over night in the refrigerator! I used chicken drumsticks instead of breasts and then served the tomato compote with it. Yummy!

I REALLY loved this recipe! I married a lovely man who unfortunately eats nothing but chicken and pasta - so I am always in need of new ways to make the same-old chicken breast. The spice combination sounded a bit odd, but believe me, it was different and wonderful. One tip, don't over marinate or it gets a bit strong. We had it with the tomato side dish and white rice. Yum!

This chicken was awesome. My husband and I eat a lot of chicken and it's always exciting to come across a new recipe. The lemmon gave it a kick, the cinnamon is kind of strange but in a good way. I added a little red pepper and forgot about the tomato thing til after I'd eaten the chicken. I nice bottle of wine makes it even more enjoyable!
