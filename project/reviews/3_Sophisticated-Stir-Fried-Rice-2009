I'm not sure what makes this recipe, "sophisticated." However, I have made it and it's easy and tasty. Simple is a word I would use instead of sophisticated. I did add some minced gingerroot and garlic to the skillet before adding the eggs. I love Asian food, and a good fried rice dish is a staple, especially since it's so easy to whip up. Real comfort food.

I thought this could use a lot more flavor... I added soy sauce, that helped. It was ok.

This recipes has become a staple in our house. Of note, szechuan peppercorns con no longer be imported into the US. Tazmanian peppercorns are a resaonable alternative.

I've made this a few times, fairly simple and always good tasting. I add garlic, ginger and some red pepper flakes to the oil with the carrot, and it adds the extra flavor that I think it needs.

Deeeee-licious! Very easy to make too. I added a little ginger and fresh garlic which gave it more flavor. It turned out great and only took me about 45 minutes to make.

This was a good recipe. Very fresh flavors. I added some pork. I think the proportions were a bit heavy on the rice and it was a bit bland - but the basic premise can easily be jazzed up.

Sure beats those fried rice dishes served in a box, hands down! Just add a little soy sauce to it.

Would make it again with some variations--it was a little bit bland for our taste.
