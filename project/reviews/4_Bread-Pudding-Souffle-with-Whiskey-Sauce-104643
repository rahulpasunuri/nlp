I work in catering and made this recipe for 80. I omitted the meringue but it was still pretty good without it. I made it in large, deep pans. Turned out well but next time I will up the bread pudding recipe, it didn't make as much as I thought it would. The bread pudding itself is great but I wasn't a big fan of the sauce. I made the bourbon sauce and it was way too strong. So I made another and substituted rum, I used about half the rum and it turned out pretty good. Be careful when upping the recipe, it makes a ton of sauce.

Loved this. It takes a bit of effort so I only make it for special dinner parties.

Oh, none can compare! It is sad that some could not enjoy this dish but all I would say to them is to give it another shot. It really is devine when made properly as I did try once to substitute some items and that turned out to be a mess.

Excellent recipe! A bit more forgiving than the notes make it sound. I made it for Christmas and it was well received. I will be making it again. I found that it made about 3x more sauce than I really needed but otherwise fantastic. Very easy to follow.

This recipe is flawless! I used it for a catering job without the meringue step, and it received rave reviews. This will be the go to bread pudding recipe from now on.

I have been making bread pudding for over 25 years using the same recipe that everyone in my family loved. I tried this for kicks and the vote is in - the other recipe has been retired. This is the only one that will be used from now on.

i am probably the first person to say so, but i thought this recipe was horrible. i've had my share of bread puddings and would call myself an expert in souffle making, but the flavors and textures were not right. i would not make this again. ever.

Excellent! Unique and memorable dessert. Nice presentation, great flavors. Was a hit at our annual NYE party. Definitely a keeper!

Delicious - just made this for a holiday party and it went over amazingly. Totally skipped the meringue part due to the fact it wouldn't keep between my arrival time and when it would be served, but it was really no matter - It's all about the pudding and the bourbon sauce! This was one of the first desserts to be devoured, and it served way more than 6 people - it's so rich you don't really need to serve heaping portions. Highly recommended!!

Has anyone made this in one big souffle dish?

Terrific in every way! I prepared as much ahead of time as I could for a barbeque (we were asked to bring a dessert). I even whipped the eggs, but the meringue went from stiff to soupy in the two hours before I put it all together. Even so, I just went ahead and followed the recipe anyways and it came out great! I made two sauces - one with bourbon and the other with jamaican rum - both seem to work well, but I think I'm more inclined to rum.

I made this incredible bread souffle for 50 people at our local soup kitchen. It was fabulous! Ican't wait to make it for our friends at our next dinner party. This is not your average bread pudding.

I made this for the Superbowl and everyone loved it! My favorite bread pudding has been from another well known New Orleans chef but I wanted to try this as soon as I found it on epicurious. It is now my favorite bread pudding recipe and I'm excited about having a new dessert to share with all my friends. It's absolutely delectible! Next time I'll try another liquor for the sauce. This is a "must try" recipe if you or anyone you know likes bread pudding.

I first had this while on vacation in New Orleans in 1999. The waiter brought the ramekins to the table, inserted a knife into the top of each souffle, and ceremoniuosly poured the bourbon sauce into each one. The first taste was heaven. Since returning home to Canada I discovered the recipe on epicurious.com, and have re-created it many times to requests from family and friends. It's now become my 'signature dessert'. True decadence, impressive, unique and simply delicious. It's definitely sweet but the bourbon helps to cut this. The one downside is that only the bread pudding & sauce can be prepared ahead. It requries beating egg whites, assembly and cooking prior to serving immediately from the oven. As long as you have guests you're comfortable with, this is worth the inconvenience. These do pile up high, but the stiffness of the egg whites maintains the height over the edge of the ramekins. Be sure to serve immediately from the oven, make a small slit in the top of each, and pour the sauce inside. A definite winner!!!

This was GREAT! even when missing some of the ingredients. I had the eggs, sugar, cream and rasins ... missing the good vanilla and nutmeg (not my fault, i am in between a Finnish forest and a bog with the closet city at +100Km). I was also missing the whiskey so it had to do with out the sauce which will for sure be made next time. I added pieces of good chocolate and it was really wonderful. For those with C degree ovens, i used a top and bottom heating oven at 150 C for the first 20 minutes and then up to 175 for the last 10)

This is a delicious recipe, better than any other bread pudding I've made! I added some real vanilla bean into the sauce, and it tasted delicious..I have also made it in individual ramekins, you just have to watch out that it doesn't dry out to much, but if it does, just put in a little more of the sauce!!!! DELICIOUS!!!

I made this recipe first and then ate at Commander's Palace. Now I get it! The bread is key. NOLA french bread is the lightest I've ever had with a thin, crispy crust. Italian is comparable but the crust may be too thick. The souffle should also be baked long enough that it is an even golden brown. My earlier creation had a merigue like the type you would find on a merigue pie. I didn't have the same results as the CP but mine was scrumptious nonetheless! Good replica recipe!

I have not made this reicpe yet- will do so this coming weekend- but I did want to know if anyone who made it feels it could be made in bulk vs individual dishes? Please advise.

I made this as written, after having this at Commander's Palace in NO several months ago. Loved it there, and loved this recipe. The non-drinkers and kids in the crowd put a scoop of vanilla ice cream on it, and ate it up! I was a little intimidated by all the discussion of what type of bread to use. I used a light plain italian type (without sesame seeds!) which seemed fine. Too much time elapsed between my restaurant meal and my attempt to really compare the two.

I enjoyed this wonderful dessert at the Commander's Palace in Las Vegas. Don't change a thing in the recipe. Makes a spectecular finish to a gala meal.

This is one of the best desserts I've ever made -- my guests raved! I used about 2 tablespoons Jack Daniels whiskey for the sauce and thought it was just right. It isn't too hard to make -- I had a little trouble with the egg whites, but even though they weren't quite as stiff as the recipe called for, I was still able to mound the souffles (although I filled 7 ramekins instead of 6), and they looked and tasted great.

Good recipe, but no self-respecting Irishman would put Bourbon in anything called "whisky" sauce. Jameson's or Bushmill's works just fine.

Making a souffle out of bread pudding is a fantastic idea--what a nice presentation! The whiskey sauce works great too. The only thing I would change is the bread pudding itself--it was bland (like using bad wine in a recipe!). Next time I will make one of my killer bread puddings, and serve it in this manner. Then this dish will really shine! (p.s. no, you don't need a collar)

I would love to make this recipe. Do you make collars for the ramekins since the directions call for loading the mixture up to one and a half inches above the top of the ramekin.

This was wonderful. I served it with a Bourbon Cream suace. The crowd loved it. Word of caution--when you think it's not quite done--it really is. Don't overcook.

Don't you hate someone who reviews a recipe that didn't actually follow the recipe - well I'm sort of one of those people in this case. I made the bread pudding portion of this recipe - and let me tell you it was very well received. I did not follow through on the sauce and the merringue. I made the sauce from a chocolate bread pudding recipe from this site which is delicious. Unfortunately, I did not have the time to make this with the merringue - my dinner plans were already way too ambitious to permit me the time. But as I said the bread pudding was excellent and I served it with a bourbon caramel sauce and whip cream. No one missed the merringue. However, I will try making it as it was meant to be another day.

First time I tried this recipe, Jamie Shannon made it. We were eating at Commander's Palace. Even though this recipe is great, it doesn't hold a candle to the New Orleans original. Be sure to heed the advice to use "light" airy bread. It makes all of the difference.

I made this for Christmas and it was incredibly delicous! I substitued the whiskey with Amereto, and it was smooth and flavorful. I will make this my Christmas dessert for years to come.

I haven't made it yet but will soon. We had the original at Commander's Palace in October, 2001. It was incredible. We were stuffed before dessert but ate it anyway. It was that good.

This dessert is unbelievably good! The last minute preparation and baking before serving is time comsuming when you have company at the table, but the guests all agreed it was well worth the wait. Another great recipe for my file.

I made the sauce for another bread pudding recipe I was making. I didn't have any bourbon, so I substituted Nocello Walnut Liqueur. It was fabulous! My guests were licking the pot!

I am originally from Louisiana and am very familiar with bread pudding. I decided to try this recipe for a change and was overwhelmed with the taste which was more than delicious! I served it to guests who absolutely loved it. My husband said, "I think this is the most delicious thing I've ever had in my mouth!"

Mmmmmmmm! Yummy, indulgent, decadent! This is a dessert best enjoyed by adults. I wouldn't change a thing, and I will definitely make it again. I had this dessert at Commander's Palace and it was every bit as good as the original.
