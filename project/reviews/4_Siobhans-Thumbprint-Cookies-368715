I've made these cookies twice now and everyone loves them! My second batch was noticeably better than my first. I agree with a previous reviewer: the confectioner's sugar is a must (I was tempted to skip that step, thinking it might make the cookies too sweet..I tried one cookie without and they are much better with) For the second batch, I refrigerated my batter disks overnight, and took them out the next morning at least two hours prior to forming the cookies. This worked much better than the first time when I made them right out of the fridge and got lots of cracking of the cookies. I also mixed the sugar and butter longer in for the second batch, until is was quite light and fluffy like the directions say. I skimped a bit on this step the first time around and the cookies seemed a little heavier and more dense. Still good, but I prefer them lighter and more shortbread like. I was also careful to barely mix in the dry ingredients, then I removed the bowl from my mixer and mixed it a little more by hand. This made a more tender cookie. When I made my first batch, they were a bit tough I think,because I mixed the dry ingredients in for too long. I ran out of jam during the second batch and, like a previous reviewer, put some milk chocolate chips into the thumbprints. They came out so delicious, that I would make more with choc. chips next time. I didn't adjust my oven racks or switch out the cookie sheets halfway through baking. I found it easier to bake one large cookie sheet at a time on the middle rack, making a second sheet whle the first was cooking. These cookie freeze perfectly, confectioner's sugar and all. I froze them in covered zip lock plastic containers with parchment paper between the layers of cookies.They come out of the freezer looking and tasting freshly baked. Thank you for this recipe! I'll be baking them again and agai

Let's just say I'm not a baker. I've never, NEVER, made a cookie I've been proud of. But these cookies I am very happy about!! I got scared and didn't fill the jam in there very much (didn't want to make a mess), but next time I will add more. Powdered sugar is a must.

Easy and simple recipe that turned out quite delightful! I usually don't like these type of cookies ( I made them for gifts) but they were really yummy. I used bonne maman jams as well (apricot & raspberry) everyone preferred the apricot. My first batch came out flat and big and round, and the jam kind of spilled out and didn't look as good as the second batch, when I made them smaller -they came out perky and the jams sat well in the middle. Like the recipe says, try not to overfill the wells. Will definitely be making these again!

This is a really nice cookie, almost like a shortbread. The next time I make this recipe, though, I'm going to experiment with the cookie size. My first pass yielded 30 cookies, and I thought they were a bit big. A previous reviewer mentioned letting the dough warm up a bit before rolling, this is a helpful tip as I was getting a lot of cracking with the cold dough. I used strawberry, raspberry and apricot preserves, since I had them all on hand, and all were very good. I'm sure any good quality preserve would work well.

No exaggeration, this was my most favorite cookie I've ever made in my life. I'm not sure why, but it's just absolutely perfect! I used strawberry jam. I made about 5 dozen for Christmas, and must have eaten two dozen on my own this week already. I didn't change a single thing aside from the fact that I cooked them in a roaster oven since our regular oven broke recently. They came out perfect! I will be making these A LOT in the future!

Excellent! I used marionberry jam to fill and my son filled his with m&ms. I even made them ahead, filled with the jam and baked and froze them. Turned out fine.

super easy - super tasty. just how you remember...except, my cookies turned out fairly big which meant the well was also fairly large. everyone liked that the "thumb print" was larger than a thumb and it turned out to be a hit.

Oh my gosh yummy! These are so much fun to make and eat. I did let the dough thaw a few minutes before rolling to prevent cracking. The cookie is the perfect soft but almost crumbly texture. I used bonne mama preserves, and the chunks of fruit really stand out.

Wow! I've made all kinds of holiday cookies, but these were surprisingly wonderful. They have a delicate salty undertone. I used raspberry preserves and wild berry conserve. Duly added to the recipe files. Super easy!

just made these & they are delicious but they need to be rolled into balls larger than 1". when i made the 'thumbprints', they fell apart or simply were not large enough to hold a decent sized well. i could only use a 1/4 tsp jam since the hole was so small but they were still delicious, very buttery & i will definitely make them again... just bigger!

Yummy. Try using brown sugar in place of white. Gives a wonderful shortbread taste. Also can roll ball in chopped pecans, then indent and bake. My go to recipe for Christmas year after year.

So easy and so good! I was looking for a recipe to use up extra jam, and came across this one. Loved it!

I made this recipe with my almost 4 year old and it came out fantastic! We actually did 1/3 of the recipe with jam, and the other 2/3 each got a big flavored M&M in the middle. (Mint-chocolate & Raspberry-chocolate) The cookies came out deliciously and were a huge hit with everyone who's shared them. Disappeared in less than 2 days.

These are delicious! A nice butter cookie with a bit of delicious jam. Used tart cherry and apricot but any jam would do. Easy to put together and turned out lovely. A holiday go to for sure.

I made these for coworkers this week for Christmas present. I used apricot and strawberry jam. They come out looking beautiful, and the powdered sugar at the end is a perfect addition. Very fun to make as well.

This is almost the exact same recipe as Trios from Gourmet of 12/2007 except that the cookies are individual rather than grouped together in threes. It's a good recipe, just not sure why it's put out as different from Trios...
