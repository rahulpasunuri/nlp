Outstanding! Used dried tarragon, fresh thyme and omitted dried basil. High quality European olives are essential, please ignore reviewers recommending canned pimento stuffed junk. Also, do use freshly squeezed lemon juice and not that pasteurized bottled stuff that reeks of cleaning solutions. Made half the recipe for a party of 4 and there were no left overs.

big hit amongst olive lovers at my NYE party. Fennel and anise add a nice out- of-the-ordinary note. Added lemon zest as per other reviewers.

I have been making these for years and always double the recipe. I discovered that once the olives are gone, it makes a fantastic marinade for grilled lamb rib chops.

I made these olives as a holiday gift and they are delicious and easy. I let them marinate in the fridge for even longer than 3 days with fine results. I also doubled the recipe and in addition to the Kalamata and green olives added pitted black olives to provide more volume (and to make it a bit more cost effective for such a large batch). The tarragon and fennel combination is wonderful!

Made these for Thanksgiving and they were well recieved by the adults. This makes alot so I have leftovers that can be snacked on for a while. Would makes these again but only if I was preparing for a very large crowd. Would be great at wedding reception or cocktail party for example.

My friend had me over for dinner and she made this as a orderve with stuffed mushrooms, and panchetta. It was soooo good. I went to bed dreaming about it so I had to get the recipe from her and she gave this website too! Thank You, Amber

This was very easy to put together and so wonderful to eat. Definitely use the anchovies - you may not be able to detect an "anchovy" flavor but they do add something to it. I also used some strips of lemon zest, which was nice. This was served over feta with grilled pita triangles - great presentation.

Worth the work! I don't like anhovies either, but followed everyones suggestion not to leave them out. I couldn't even tell they were in there.

The Rutherford Grill in Napa is one of my favorite restaurants, so when I found this recipe I was thrilled. Many of my friends who originally thought they hated olives are suddenly converted.

Everyone really enjoyed these olives. The anchovies are crucial and although they are a nuisance to fillet, anchovies packed in salt are vastly superior to the oil packed kind.

This recipe is the best. Get ready because everyone you serve it to will ask for the recipe. Makes a great hostess gift with a bottle of wine.

Made this dish for a party and it was just as good as the reviews said it would be! A must for olive lovers. I questioned whether to put the anchovies and found that it enhanced the flavor without being overpowering. For those that are concerned that there will be an anchovy taste to the olive, do not fear-- include it.

I hate anchovies so I leave them out but I think it's still the best marinated olive recipe around. Yum yum yum. Friends ask for the recipe all the time.

Made these two days ago and just love them! The balsamic is a wonderful touch. I used 1/2 Tblsp. of Anchovy Essence that I buy over in England and it worked just fine. Wonderful new twist on olives that will be great for gifts to my olive loving friends as well! KIMBER

I live in the napa valley and this recipe was taken from a restaurant up valley called the Rutherford Grill. I had the olives when I was there and they truley were wonderful. When I made this recipe it didn't compare. It seems that the olives didn't absorb the marinate and the brine flavor was too strong. I followed the recipe and let them marinate for a long time. Any suggestions?

I have been trying recipes for marinated olives and this is one of the two or three best. It does require fresh herbs.
