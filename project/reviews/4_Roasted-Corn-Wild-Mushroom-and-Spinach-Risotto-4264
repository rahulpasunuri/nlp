This was delicious! I was so proud of myself. I was a little scared at first because of all the risotto horror stories out there, but this by far was super easy. I followed the recipe exactly and it produced wonderful results. I am making it again for friends for dinner tonight!

Delicious! Used frozen corn (roasted without oil as it was a tad wet) and homemade stock (single most important ingredient for flavor in my opinion). Took more than an hour - but I was working on a couple of other dishes too. The 4 servings seem large even as a main dish.

This was a huge hit, and took a little over an hour from start to finish. I used double the mushrooms, spinach, and wine, and used veggie stock to make it vegetarian. Delicious!

Had all the ingredients except spinach, so used arugula. Threw in some extra parmesan. It was a great use for the last of the summer sweet corn I had. Loved the texture of the corn with the earthiness of the mushrooms. I sauted the mushrooms in butter to get a nice golden brown color. I made as a vegetarian entree, but would be great as a side dish with poultry or fish.

I substituted vegetable broth for chicken broth to make it vegetarian. I simmered shitake mushrooms (that seemed too dry) and corn cobs in water to supplement the vegetable broth. I used a package of thawed pressed frozen package of spinach rather than 2 cups of fresh. It may have been equivalent to more than 2 cups of fresh, but it did seem like a good healthy ratio. The flavors were good together. I'd make it again.

this was delicious! I also didn't think it was that time consuming, it took me about an hour start to finish. I used cremini mushrooms and frozen corn, and I roasted them both in the oven at the same time on two different sheets (corn took longer) I started the risotto while the veggies were roasting... I find that you don't need to stir it every single second, you can leave it for a minute or two to attend to other things. I also didn't bother pureeing the corn. I'm excited to eat it for lunch for the next few days!

As stated by previous reviewers, VERY time consuming, but thats risotto. It was excellent. Served it with roasted split chicken breast topped with oregano, garlic lemon, oo, and butter. Amazing comments from my guests. Very pretty on the plate. Layers of flavor were exceptional. Use and serve with a fume blanc.

This recipe was a *lot* of work with a poor result. The thyme totally overpowers the other flavors.

The weather was way too hot to have the oven on, and I couldn't convince the hubby to grill, so "pan-roasted" kernels from leftover ears of corn and portobello mushrooms. I also increased amount and substituted de- ribbed chard for the spinach (I use them interchangeably, and chard was better at the farmer's market). It was fabulous! Served with a green salad and a fresh baguette,but that's more so it's not just one dish plopped on a plate. Would also be nice with a fresh fruit salad. It made tons, which is fine because it reheats nicely in the microwave.

This recipe really turned me on to risotto! I bought a bag of frozen corn but still took the time to roast it and the mushrooms in the oven, which brought out a really beautiful flavor. I also added some fresh garlic and thyme. The puree helps the risotto achieve a flawfless texture without adding fatty cream. I've used this as a template for many risottos since and would highly recommend it.

This was fantastic and healthy!!! I used Costco dried wild mushrooms and they were great. Take the time to roast the corn...so much more depth of flavor!

Worth the time. I adapted it this way and would do so again: used 16oz bag of frozen white corn, right out of bag; 2 cups sliced cremini mushrooms; 2 cups de- ribbed rainbow chard, sliced; for the oil, I used 1 T olive oil and 1 T truffle oil. Fantastic.

Outstanding dish, a little labor intensive but not too bad once you get past the prep work. I grilled the corn instead roasting it in the oven and used a bit of herbs de provence instead of straight thyme, but otherwise remained true to the recipe. My dinner guests vied for the leftovers.

My husband said "Top Ten!" We used fresh morels and added asparagus. Had some ears of corn leftover from grilling last night, so that made it easy. The corn puree makes a major flavor impact. I also tossed some chopped, local hazelnuts on top. Fantastic.

We make a lot of risotto dishes. Based on the reviews I was expecting great results. But I was very disappointed in the flavor of this dish. Chanterelles are perhaps too delicate a flavor as the roasted corn and fresh thyme seemed to overwhelm them.

Time consuming, yes, but well worth it!

Risotto is time consuming on its own. Roasting the corn, roasting the mushrooms these added a lot of extra time and not much flavor. There are better risotto recipes out there.

excellent. worth the effort. best chanterelle dish ever.

The best dressed up risotto I've ever had. Definitely labor intesive, but worth it. I tried it both with frozen corn and with fresh corn on the cob - and yes, it's better using the fresh corn. Although, if you're pressed for time, use the frozen - it's still excellent. I added in a few porcini mushrooms as well. My husband not only devours the dinner, but the leftovers as well.

This was a hearty, delicious dish. I used a bag of frozen corn to save time. I needed an additional two cups of broth to cook the risotto sufficiently.

Even though there are many steps to this recipe, including individual preparation of many of the ingredients, this is an easy to make dish, absolutely fantastic: very tasty and nice looking.

I really like the flavors of the roasted corn and mushrooms in this dish. We used frozen corn (already off the cobs) and just roasted it right out of the freezer -- works great, and easier. Used about 1/2 mushroom and 1/2 vegetable stock, just because that is what we had on hand. Time consuming but well worth it.

I changed the recipe just a bit to cut the prep time. Instead of roasting the corn and mushrooms, (I used portobellos) I grilled them both and it gave the dish that wonderful flavor of the grill. It also kept the heat down in the kitchen which is a good thing since it was 95 degrees outside. I think the next time I try this I will add some grilled chicken breast as well.

I also tried this with arugula and it was also yummy!

Although the dish was great, and very well received, it required more prep than I'm interested in. Roasting the corn, then pureeing, and roasting the mushrooms was a little much. There are lots of risottos that are just as good that require much less prep.

I love risotto, and this is one of my favorites! I didn't mind the spinach in whole pieces, as it wilts during the cooking process (but maybe my spinach was smaller).

Excellent combination of flavors that complimented one another well. The recipe fails to tell you to cut the spinach up in more manageable pieces. I strongly recommend that you do so.

Substituting vegetable broth or garlic broth for the chicken broth makes this a wonderful vegetarian alternative for dinner guests. Elegant to look at and luscious to eat!

Skip the real corn, use frozen and save yourself an hour. it is delicious.
