Well, this is an easy dish, and edible. I subbed carrot for bell pepper, as it's what was on hand. I don't think using bell pepper would have improved my opinion. I found it too sweet, likely I would decrease relish and add straight white vinegar instead of pickle juice next time. Also a bit heavy on onion for my taste. I'll make "this" dish again, with modifications. Friends and family ate it all, but they're a hungry group.
