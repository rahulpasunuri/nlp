Will make again. Subbed white vermouth for the wine - my salmon pieces were too irregular so several bites had no salmon and just veggies which were tasty but needed something (salmon :) ) My phyllo was a little old so I added a third layer which I think actually improved the dish. Really like the idea of being able to prep these in advance and cooking off for guests.

Used puff pastry (had it onhand) instead of phyllo and omitted the butter. I had more filling than pastry, so made them open-faced and reduced baking time. Used a mandolin for the leeks. Didn't have white wine either, so added some chicken bouillon and herbes de Provence. Spread a thin layer of soft goat cheese mixed with creme freche on the pastry before adding other ingredients.

It was good-liked the vegetable combination the way it was (had to cut ingredients down for two). Took a lot of time and that's why 3 not 4....

Rating: 4
Everyone I've made this for has loved it! Even people who don't typically like fish. The only change I make is that I put a thin layer of either light cream cheese or goat cheese on top of the salmon before putting the vegetables on top. I've even done this on the barbecue. Works great!

This recipe was very good -- particularly because it can be prepared in advance and then quickly baked before serving!!! I cut the salmon into smaller square pieces and used only 1 sheet of phyllo for each piece. I buttered (very lightly) half the phyllo then folded over and buttered (very lightly) the other half, and then wrapped the fish topped with the veggies. The portions turned out perfect -- allowing everyone to enjoy the side courses, and there was just enough phyllo crunch to compliment the dish without overwhelming it.

Rating: 4
Great flavors! I made the filling pretty much exactly as is, though prepped shrimp instead of salmon. Ready to make packets, I opened my freezer to discover that what I thought were phyllo sheets were all cracked up into phyllo strips :( Packets were out of the question, so I dumped the strips into a bowl with the butter, massaged it through, and then greased up a jumbo muffin tin. I layered phyllo, a few shrimp, the veggie filling, and a topping of phyllo. Then I baked it as the recipe called and they turned out wonderfully! Not as delicate a construction as a packet, but an option for anyone else with cracked-up phyllo or kataifi.

Rating: 3
Easy and fast! I really liked this recipe, but wish as some of the reviews mentioned that I had made extra veggies to put over the salmon. I followed the recipe exactly and didn't feel like the salmon came out dry, however I love veggies so next time will do a smaller piece of salmon (3-4 oz) with more veg mix.

Rating: 4
This is incredibly easy to make and has great presentation. I used cooking spray in place of the 6T of butter and fresh green beans and julienne carrots in place of the red pepper strips. I skipped the crushed red pepper, added fresh parsley and a sprinkle of dry basil. Finally, I added 2 T of each lemon juice and dijon mustard to the vegetables when I added the wine. I saved some of the vegetables to garnish the salmon wraps before serving.

Rating: 1
What a disappointment! Overall dry, salmon overcooked even though I cut the time by 10 minutes. Too much pastry: think that the 2 whole sheets of phyllo was too much. Should have rolled twice and cut off surplus. Pepper/leek filling was good but wasted in this recipe. If you want a good salmon/pastry recipe try epicurious salmon and leek pie. Wonderful!

Rating: 4
Everyone loved this; I didn't find it too dry at all. Cooked per an earlier reviewer's suggestion -- 25 mins on 375 convection -- makes for a pretty impressive presentation. Our filets were about 7 oz, and with a few exceptions, people were able to manage about half a filet each. I imagine other fish and/or veg would be equally good; next time I may vary the seasoning a bit.

Rating: 4
Love this recipe! It's easy but impressive for company and very tasty. It's also half-healthy, except for all the butter. I even made a non-salmon person eat most of their serving! This has become one of my old faithful recipes.

Rating: 4
I used fresh black cod instead of salmon this time and it was absolutely delicious. I also decreased the amount of red pepper by half and used fresh baby shitakes - it was better this way. With the changes, the dish becomes incredibly rich and buttery tasting without increasing the use of butter at all. My guests LOVED it!

This recipe was actually too bland for our preferences, despite the fact that we added additional herbs and garlic to give it body. Perhaps that is why some folks here decided that a sauce was necessary.

Rating: 4
This was fantastic! I just made it for the two of us tonight, so I halved the ingredients for the vegetable part, and cooked the salmon for about 25-30 minutes. This is a very classy way to present salmon, and the flavors and textures melded well. I used a little less pepper flakes than what is called for - just enough to feel the heat but not overwhelm the dish. I would definitely make this again (I just happened to have all the ingredients on hand tonight... very random).

Rating: 4
I've served this to guests many times and always get rave reviews. Can be assembled hours in advance, covered with plastic wrap. I have found that the moisture that collects during refrigeration helps the phyllo to brown nicely without drying out. Remove from frig. 30 min. before baking, and cook no more than 18-20 minutes. I've tried several sauces and prefer the leek an lemon sauce on this site. Fool proof and delicious!

Rating: 4
This dish is absolutely lovely. I served it for weeknight dinner but it would definitely make marvelous dinner party fare. I made it with about 1/2 the suggested amount of red pepper flakes and used puff pastry instead of phyllo, and got away with barely 2 tbsps of melted butter for brushing. In about half of the packets I added a dollop of Mexican sour cream between the fish and the veggies and it added a nice creamy tang. I think you could use any tender fish for this recipe and it would be a big hit. YUMMY!

Rating: 4
This was delicious and a quick weekday dinner. Salmon for me; halibut for hubby; both were great, and we were very impressed with how flaky the fishes were. I wanted to use what was in the fridge, so replaced the leek with fennel. Scrumptious! I inadvertently forgot the pepper flakes, but having tasted this dish I would omit them again. Definitely a keeper!

Great! Very impressive for something quite simple to do. I made it with whole wheat phyllo found at Whole Foods.

We have prepared this many times and it is a hit. We reduce the quantity of salmon and also phyllo. We also bump it up a notch by adding dried basil on each phyllo sheet and a touch of lemon juice on the fillet.

Loved this dish. I mistakenly pulverized the hazelnuts in the food processor instead of chopping them up with a knife, but added them anyway and it worked incredibly well! Was serving this to my mother who does not like nuts and she just raved about it and did not realize there were nuts in the dish. I will reserve some bechemal sauce to top this next time I make it. I have recommended this to friends.

I used puff pastry instead of phyllo because that's what the store had, and found it worked quite well - although I didn't do the two layers. The salmon was nice and moist - and the flavors from the veggies were great. Definitely an easy one to impress your guests

I'd give the recipe by itself 3 forks, as the salmon was a little dry (although still quite tasty). But I served it with a lemon-dill sauce and that made it excellent! I agree w/ some of the other reviewers about reserving some of the veggies and serving them over the salmon or rice, too.

I made this dish for a dinner party and served it over a creamy baked polenta with a side of steamed asparagus...needless to say plates were licked clean. I thought it was fabulous, and reserved some of the leek mixture to pour over the top for presentation.

I don't think this needs a sauce. I've made it several times and loved it every time. Last night I used uncooked prawns instead of the salmon and cooked it for 22 minutes......it was even better than with salmon!

I made this for a dinner party last night. Everyone ate every last bite. I did not serve it with a sauce, and do not think it needed one. I loved the flavor of the basil. I didn't want to overcook the salmon, so I used the convect bake option on my oven at 375 degrees for about 20 minutes. The salmon was perfectly cooked, but I would have prefered a crispier shell. Will adapt for next time. I served with wild rice and steamed asparagus. This recipe is of course only as good as the flavor of your salmon.

This was good, but like some of the other reviewers I definitely felt it needed a sauce of some sort as it was a bit dry. 30 minutes was also too long to cook for.

This recipe doesn't need a sauce! Besides adding different sauces means you may need to change the type of wine you serve. It's difficult enough finding a wine that goes with salmon.

This was a great dish for a winter dinner party. I assembled it a few hours ahead then baked the fish after guest arrived. I served it with the leek and lemon cream sauce- which was great. I tasted the sauce w/o fish and thought it was too tart but once on the fish (with asparagus and mashed potatoes) it came together nicely. Easy and tasty!

I have made this several times and people usually say its the best salmon they've ever had! I serve it with an orange & jalapeno sauce on the side, and I tie the salmon parcels with a strip of blanched green leek.

This was really good. As per other reviews I served it with the sauce from Almond Crusted Salmon With Leek and Lemon Cream Sauce on this site. I think the Salmon was great on it's own but others liked the sauce. Either way it's a winner.

This was not delicious enough to justify all that butter.

This was a great way to make salmon -- a nice change from our usual preparations, and very easy, to boot. My husband couldn't believe we were having something so elegant on a weeknight. I made a lemon dill sauce to go with it, and it was good, but I think the right sauce would make this a 4-star dish. I've had a similar dish (with red snapper) with a lobster cognac sauce at a local Alsatian restaurant, and I'll bet that sauce would be excellent w/ this dish. The sauce from Lobster Crisps w/ Champagne-Dill Sauce from this site sounds like it would be tasty too -- it's a reduction of lobster stock made w/ champagne, shallots and tomato paste, enriched w/ cream. Might try that.

Rating: 4
Very impressive dinner party-type dish. I'd recommend reducing the crushed pepper by about a half -- it was a bit overpowering. I was tempted to go with bigger filets than 5oz but was glad I didn't because the phyllo was so filling. I served it just with green beans which went well.

Rating: 2
I thought that this recipe would have been wonderful when I read it through. I made it exactly as written and served it at a dinner party. It tasted good, but was not the "show stopper" I had hoped for. It was moist for sure, but lacked luster. I thought that a sauce would have been helpful for sure. My guests ate every drop and said they enjoyed it. I thought it was just another good salmon recipe, but would probably not repeat it again.

Rating: 3
Delicious, easy and elegant presentation. I served w/wilted spinach (see the Wilted Greens recipe) and a wild rice/long grain rice for company last night. Easy prep...I love the advance prep feature. I used 1/2 the crushed red pepper called for and barely tasted it. Next time I'll add a little more. I personally love basil and thought it went very well with salmon. This recipe could easily be adjusted for vegi's or herbs of your choice. I thought the packages of salmon might be a little dry without a sauce, but I found that the vegi's and the buttery phyllo kept the salmon wonderfully moist. Will definitely repeat this dish!

Rating: 3
I liked the method but will make some changes next time. I took the salmon out 15 mins early because we like our salmon quite rare, and it was still overdone. It would be great with a sauce, and I was particularly impressed that it can all be done in advance except for baking. With some adjustments I will make this for my next dinner party. Might be nice with some chopped dill instead of basil and the addition of a pat of cream cheese before wrapping to keep it moist.

Rating: 3
This was delicious but it was very rich and too much butter! Next time I would cut down on the butter used but other than that it was a real party piece and I am planning to serve it to friends at Whitsun. Served it with green beans and a lemon dill sauce which was perfect.

Served this dish for Christmas Eve along with spinach mashed potatoes and horseradish sour cream sauce, all on this site, to rave reviews. I actually used Pam instead of butter on the phyllo, and with the other two recipes used evaporated skim milk where it called for cream and nonfat sour cream for the horseradish sauce. Couldn't tell the difference! We all left the table stuffed, but not with that overwhelmed feeling of having consumed too much butter. In answer to the suggestion of the lemon dill sauce, I found the horseradish sauce in my search for some sort of lower-fat lemon dill. It gave it just the perfect kick (I think my red pepper flakes are a little on the mild side).

Rating: 4
Excellent! Just a wonderful dish. To cut down on fat, I used an olive oil mister instead of butter. I made a suggested dill sauce to accompany the salmon. That was a good idea. I served salmon with steamed broccoli and rice pilaf.

Rating: 4
This is an outstanding recipe!! Easy, because you can make it ahead and just pop in the oven when your guests arrive. Next time, I will reduce the oven time, though, as my salmon came out a little bit overcooked. Having it slightly rare on the inside will make it less dry.

Rating: 3
This was really good! I was trying to make a wrapped-salmon dish that I had at another restaurant that was similar to this one. I would definitely brush more butter on the phyllo, especially when you do the rolling. I agree with another reviewer that a lemon dill sauce would be perfect with the fish, as the phyllo was a little dry for me (the extra brushing of butter should help). All in all, a really good dish!

Rating: 4
I made this recipe just last evening for my husband and I. It was fabulous! The only thing that I may try next time is perhaps making a light lemon dill sauce to go with it.

By the time I went to try this recipe, I was missing lots of the ingredients. I used orange and green peppers, no red. I also used coriander instead of basil. It was still delicious! Since I was just making it for myself, I didn't bother with a sauce, and I wasn't disappointed in the least. The butter between the sheets of phyllo gave it enough flavour. If I were to make a sauce, I would definitely serve it on the side and allow people to use at their own discretion.

This was a delicious recipe and very impressive to serve. It was wonderful to be able to do a lot of the preparation ahead of time. My guests really enjoyed it. I served it along with a lemon butter sauce and rice with mint and feta. I had some extra leek and red pepper strips so I threw it on top of the rice for a little colour. For a side vegetable,I served asparagus. I will definitely make this again.

I lived in Whistler for many years and always loved going to Araxis for a very special occasion. I was thrilled to fing this recipe here and have made it often. It is very easy to make (which makes it hard to justify the price I used to have to pay for it in the restaraunt) and taste as wonderful as it did when I used to order it.

This is very good- but I think it requires the previously mentioned lemon-dill sauce to put it over the top. I too used the one from the smoked salmon recipe on this site, with slight modifications. It does present really well, got lots of oohs and aaahs.

I have to agree with most everyone else - this recipe rocks! I used mixed red, orange, and yellow peppers, which made for a very colorful presentation. Also cut down on the pepper flakes. Served with a mustard-dill sauce, which paired beautifully, sauteed asparagus, and a wild/brown rice pilaf. Add a bottle of Chateau Neuf du Pape and it was an Easter meal to remember. My whole family said this was one of the best ever.

My husband and guests raved about it and said it was like eating at a fine restaurant. I served it with blanched brocolini sauteed with garlic, and Lemon-scented Saffron Rice. I think that 6 oz. portions are fine for men, too large for women. Next time I would add some Dijon mustard to the vegetable mix to give it a little kick, since I left out the pepper.

Rave reviews from my guests. I got a little generous and used three layers of phyllo instead of two, will stick with two next time. However, it was still a hit. I was a little worried that it wouldn't be enough food, but hardly anyone was able to eat the whole thing, and not because they didn't enjoy it! I think I'd like to try a sauce with it next time...although it wasn't dry, I think it would be a nice touch. Any suggestions?

Rating: 4
Such a good dish for entertaining. It's really not that difficult to do, yet looks (and tastes) so impressive. I've made it multiple times for company. Instead of brushing the phyllo sheets with butter, I misted them with an olive oil spray - a little quicker, lighter, and less messy.

This was a fantastic dinner party recipe. I reduced the pepper flakes to 1/4 tsp and may omit it completely next time. I added a large clove of garlic to the pepper and leek mixture. My boyfriend doesn't like salmon so I made his portion with red snapper and the rest of the guests had it with the salmon. They were all a big hit! I'm going to make this again when I have our parents over for dinner. I also made a veg only packet and this will be great for guests who are vegetarian.

I really loved this receipe. I thought it would be more difficult to make than it was. I too would reduce the red pepper flakes. And I believe a light lemon sauce would be good with this, or at least lemon slices. Very classy looking meal.

This was a fabulous dish. The proportions were a bit off. 2 red bell pepperswas the perfect amount, but it did not measure 2 cups as the recipe indicated. I would also decrease the red pepper flakes to 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon. As the other reviewers said, it can be prepared ahead and it tastes great even the next day!

I made this for a dinner party and it was a huge hit. I did make a beurre blanc sauce to go on top, which added a little more flavor. The blend of salmon, leeks and red pepper was wonderful. (it even reheated well the next day!)

Great for a dinner party - as it can be prepared ahead and ready to go! Very flavourful (I used my own blend of spices on the salmon for extra flavour) - would use less red pepper flakes next time; however the blend of leeks and red peppers were subtle, yet satisfying - guests were happy! I will be making this again - may make smaller portions as some guests eat less (others could have two) - may even attempt a large salmon in one whole piece - wrapped in several phyllo sheets and guests can take as large or small piece as desired!

Rating: 3
Very impressive. I don't think it needs the beurre blanc sauce, as there was a lot of butter in the recipe. To avoid blandness I added a bit more of the red pepper flakes to the vegetable saute. Passing lemon segments is a good idea too. Great dinner party entree as it can be (mostly) made ahead of time.

I used red snapper instead of salmon, and we loved it! Because it's in a 'blanket,' the fish stays nice and hot, too, during the meal. If making it ahead of time, though, just make sure you brush *plenty* of melted butter on it, otherwise it will stick to the plastic wrap.

This is a hint to the Seattle, WA reviewer -- or anyone else confused by the 6x2x1 salmon fillet. That's the approximate size you get when you skin and bone a 1 inch salmon steak. I do it often for a neater one or two servings of salmon or halibut.
