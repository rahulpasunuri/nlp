This was a very tasty sauce and easy to make. I think chutney is a misnomer here. It was a great complement to the Chicken Tikka, but seems versatile enough to use on other meats/foods.

This recipe has none of the taste or heat of the authentic cilantro chutney. It also is watery. I had to doctor the recipe significantly after making it per the recipe, just to get some flavor.

Delicious - more of a sauce actually. Love it with samosas.

This is an excellent and easy condiment to Murg Makhani (Indian Butter Chicken). Only changes: I added an entire green serrano chili for more heat.
