A very easy decorative praline for the Pecan Praline Cake. Good flavor - the brown sugar did not overpower the pecan flavor. I will make this again and use it on other cakes as well as other desserts.

I used this topping with the Pecan Praline Cake 12/2000. The only thing I did different was to chop the pecans rather than use them whole for this cake.
