I've been eating this for 40 years. My grandmother used to make it as described. Today, I often remove the skin and utilize the same process. Healthier for sure. Sometime I add more seasoning like garlic powder and paprika to the crumb mixture. One of my family classics. YUM!

This is not cordon bleu -- it is a really easy, fast meal that kids and adults can both eat. The chicken stays very moist (I used boneless chicken thighs). I have grated parmesan cheese into the mixture but only when the kids aren't eating the chicken.

Love this recipe - super easy and a healthy alternative to a guilty pleasure. Here are some hints I've given with friends with whom I've shared this recipe... " Reduce cooking time by almost half (20-30 min) if using boneless and skinless chicken breasts or thighs " Put the S&P in the milk/egg mixture vs in the cornflakes - it sticks to the chicken better (or just crack the S&P when the chicken is on the tray and headed for the oven) " The melted butter over the chicken is unnecessary (it's butter for the sake of butter) " Don't try to flip the chicken halfway through cooking - the crunchy cornflakes will come off

I don't know why this got so many bad reviews - its good, I added paprika and Italian herbs to the corn flake mixture though. In any case, this is becoming an easy, quick weeknight staple in our household.

Maybe this would be better if Panko were substituted for cornflakes.

Okay. Its my fault that I tried a recipe with the main ingredient being Corn Flakes..but I assumed that since it was reviewed on epicurious by people who love food and love to cook that maybe there was something to it. There was NOT. There is nothing remotely tasty or memorable about this chicken. Now I am stuck with a huge box of corn flakes that I will never use again. Booo

Excellent substitute for real fried chicken. The only change I made to the recipe is seasoning the chicken with salt, pepper, cayenne, and paprika after it had been covered in corn flakes and sprayed with olive oil. The chicken turns out moist and flavorful -- and the prep work is so easy!

Good and simple. S&P all fell to the bottom of the corn flakes, so I will only put on the chix next time.

Easy to make, with only a few common ingredients needed. The hardest part is waiting for it to cook!
