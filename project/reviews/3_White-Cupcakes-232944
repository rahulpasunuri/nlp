these cupcakes were easy to make but the baking time is wrong and they sink in the middle! the taste was very good. How can I get them to rise properly? I will try to make them again.

I took the advise of other reviewers an d increased the butter, also added a couple of tablespoons of passion fruit puree. they came out all right, but not great. I made them mini size and they still took over 30 min to bake.

After spending a considerable amount of time searching for a white cupcake recipe, this one definitely is the best recipe I found. After reading the other reviews, I used 1 stick of butter and about a 1/4 cup of vegetable oil when I added the eggs. The cupcakes wound out coming moist, but lacking a little flavor, which may be might fault for cutting out a 1/4 cup of the sugar! Because of their easiness and general results, I would definitely make them again.

Added a little more butter and about 150 grams less sugar. Stuck a sweetened cherry or two in each cup before baking. Definitely going to save this recipe.

Based on the reviews below, I used 1 stick of butter. This is a no-frills, easy to make recipe which I found perfect for my needs (kids birthday party at school). Be careful not to over-bake, my cupcakes were done at 15 minutes and stayed nice and white.

Perfect cupcake for a kids birthday party. I followed the recipe exactly. Many said it took forever to cook. However, when I checked after 20 minutes - they were perfect.

This was a great and easy recipe to follow. The cupcakes came out moist and light. Per the prior reviews, I added an additional 1/3 cup of butter for a total of 1 cup of butter and that did the trick.

Just made these for my four year old's birthday party-- they were easy to make, delicious, and all the moms asked for the recipe.

they must have changed this recipe because all the old reviews say they were too dry. I made exactly as stated and they were runny and gummy after 20+ minutes, just like the most recent reviewer. Don't waste your ingredients... find another recipe. :(

I like this recipe over all. The baking time is incorrect as others have stated. but having been for warned, We extended the time and they turned out well. I added 3 tablespoons of fresh passion fruit puree to the batter, and instead of frosting them though we filled them with passion fruit curd. They turned out excellent.

While very tasty, I have a few issues with this recipe, mainly that the cooking time was completely inaccurate. I ruined the first batch by trusting the 20 mins cooking time and letting them cool before I checked them with a toothpick. The second batch has been cooking for about 30 mins, and they are still runny. This is not an issue with my stove: it is brand new/state of the art.

Delicious with a great texture, not too sweet so perfect to ice. Only three forks for technical recipe reasons - made quite a few more standard-sized cupcakes than indicated and took quite a bit longer to bake, too,so this recipe is more of a base for other recipes, not completely a stand alone, imho.

These cupcakes are always a hit whenever I make them. My husband can't get enough of them.

I like to follow the recipe strictly first go, which I did and they are excellent. I used a convection oven at 170˚C turning 180˚ half way through and baking a bit longer. I used the butter cream frosting with strawberry syrup instead of vanilla. The cake IS slightly dry, but that's because they are supposed to be iced (frosted). The only thing I would change for next time is to add some lemon zest/juice to the batter.

I topped these with chocolate icing, and they were a big hit at my son's birthday party. Very moist, much like pound cake. Easy recipe too. This is going to be my go to cupcake recipe from now on.

Very simple and very, very tasty. A little crispy on top, but still very moist. I plan on making this my go-to cupcake recipe

My cupcakes turned out bitter & soapy :( I think that the baking soda didn't react or soomething- I added 1/4 honey to the remaining batter Plus some chocolate chips- and the bitter taste is gone! I read somewhere that baking soda requires something acidic to react which will get rid of the bitter taste- aparently Honey does the trick!

The cupcakes were very easy. I make them pink and heart-shaped for everyone at my office. They were a little dense and dry, I think that can be cured with a cake flour. Overall, they were a huge hit and I will make them again!

I tried these for the first time today in Moscow and was a little concerned that the differences in flour or sugar might alter the results. I followed the directions exactly and...presto...simply amazing white cake, light and not too sweet. With the buttercream frosting, I was taken back to my a favorite bakery I frequented in my childhood.

I thought these were phenomenal. I made mini-cupcakes for my daughter's birthday party, so the texture and sweetness was just right. I think I may have added a touch more butter inadvertently. These are some of the best white cupcakes I've ever made. I will definitely make them again!

Taking a tip from another reviewer I increased the butter and sugar slightly. I was somewhat concerned about the sugar (from beetroot) available here in Serbia, because the crystals never seem to dissolve, so I beat it forever! The batter was quite light and made at least 50% more cupcakes than called for in the recipe and the resulting cakes were light, sweet and delicious.

Made these cupcakes with my daughters yesterday. They were easy, but VERY dry with a cornbread-like texture. I added more milk, vanilla, and butter as suggested, but still not good. My 3 & 4 yr old daughters won't eat it. The "easy chocolate cupcake" recipe on here was a total hit though.

Rating: 2
it was okay. made a double batch with the standing mixer, so that may have impacted it somewhat, but it was just okay. I expected it to be a bit dense based on other's reviews, but it was also dry, which wasn't expected. And not sweet, in fact it made me think of dry cornbread. The frosting was super sweet and rich, so the cupcakes were still a hit, but I don't expect to use this recipe again.

use caster sugar to make creaming of butter easier. (not granulated because the crystals are big.)

I took other reviewers advice about the denisty of the cupcakes and added a tad more butter, vanilla & milk, just a tad. The result- my husband and his brother freaked out over these cupcakes! Definitely a must!

Followed the recipe exactly, and these came out quite dense. Tasty though, and not too sweet for me.

Made as directed, except used 1 c honey and 1/4 c sugar instead of the sugar as stated. 335 degrees convection bake, 2/3 full, 14-15 min. Loved the texture and the flavour. Will make again.

Quite sweet - I would try and reduce the amount of sugar next time. Overall not bad, but not the best cupcakes I've ever eaten. I'm not sure that whole milk made that much of a difference - next time I'll go back to skim, which doesn't seem to affect any other cupcake recipe that I've used.

I used fat free milk and substituted honey for the vanilla. They came out light both in texture and taste. They color was a dazzling white. A nice cake.

These cupcakes had a good flavor (used the high-priced vanilla) and came out with a beautiful, domed top. Mine came out very heavy--like my grandmother's old fashioned recipe. They were like pound cake in texture. If you prefer the texture of a box cake mix, you will not like these.

Rating: 3
Found them a breeze to make, however a little heavy. This was an advantage, however, to make dozens of the eyeball cupcakes to send to work. Held up extremely well, and the flavour was pleasant. Maybe vanilla beans nexts time. Lot's of compliments.

I used 2% milk and added a little extra vanilla. We liked the cake, but thought it turned out a bit sweet -- and that was before frosting. The cake has a great chewy texture (maybe I overmixed, I used a stand mixer for the first time) and looks as white as angel food cake. It is stiff enough to stand on its own; I used muffin pans without paper cups and they didn't crumble to pieces when I frosted them. Overall, a good basic cake, may be good with dried fruit and zest!

I really liked these cupcakes. I found them moist, and sweet without being overpowering.

I was disappointed with the results. They turned out too dry and bland.
