Delicious! Followed the directions exactly, it came out perfectly. Let merengue cool for 15 minutes and waited a good amount of time between adding each piece of butter and didn't have any of the problems others have reported.

LOVE this recipe! I've used it time and again. Have used it as a base for vanilla extract etc. Thank you!!! Just remember everyone...keep beating! It's worth it!

Curdled mess? Frosting separated after you add butter? Keep beating! The buttercream won't come together quickly if the meringue (egg-white mixture) is still too warm. Keep beating. DELICIOUS, perfect buttercream recipe.

It all went perfectly until I added the butter, it went lumpy so changed it into a cream cheese frosting but i think the quality of the butter makes a difference as in NY the quailty is rubbish but in the UK you can get french butter which may cause a difference to the structure of the icing.

Fantastic. It took longer than 6 minutes for the egg whites and sugar to cool...had no trouble with the butter. It was perfect.If you liked this recipe, you should also try the coffee and mocha buttercream recipe from here!

I was very curious to try this recipe after reading the other reviews. I LOVED it! I had no issues at all with the butter. It all went flawlessly. I did not have a thermometer, but used the old fashioned ice water trick to test for the soft ball stage. Will definitely use again.

I have made this recipe several times and it has become the "gold standard" of frostings for my baking. My daughter's 11-year old friends start screaming when they see my cupcakes coming--it's all about this frosting. It's important to read all the reviews regarding the curdling. This time, I let the simple syrup cool to around 200* before streaming it in. It probably helped that my butter was nearly melted, to counteract the cooled-down syrup, but I still had to do the bags of ice, it still looked curdled, etc. but it all comes together in the end. I make it with vanilla extract and add powdered sugar, as I like it a bit sweeter. It's always a huge hit.

Very good buttercream, it wasn't too sweet. Piped really well.

The recipe does not say this, and it should: Keep beating after the last bit of butter is added. Keep beating and beating. It'll happen. 2-3-5-7-or-more minutes later. Hang in there. To frost a lemon cake, I added more lemon juice and lemon extract instead of coconut. I had the same issue with the curdling and not jelling at the "end," but then I dropped in an emulser and, bingo (and after some time), it creamed together--I've learned that from my hollandaise curdling moments (even though I know it's not the same chemistry). I think that if I had kept going (and going) with the regular beaters, it would have done the same thing. It's delicious. Really.

This is the best buttercream I have ever tasted, my own creations and the professionals I have worked with included. Following the recipe and being patient to get the perfect temperature is key. I have requests for it from all my family and friends. Absolutely superior!

Wow is all I can say about this buttercream recipe. My whole life our family made the "short-cut" buttercream on the back of the C&H box, and I had never made a true buttercream. Luckily I read the reviews in advance. It took about 15 minutes for the egg white mixture to cool. I even used cold packs held to the outside of the bowl. Be very patient, it's worth the wait. I was terrified of overbeating, but it takes a long time for it all to come back together. I added more coconut extract than called for. I used the coconut cake from another recipe and the filling from the macadamia coconut cake recipe, but used sesame brittle instead. Was beautiful and delicious!

YUM!!!!!!! made this for my daughter's luau birthday with a pinapple-mango filling and coconut cake. Easy to make, and it was my first time making buttercream! Made it (with less coconut extract) to go with a strawberry orange wedding cake. Superb both times!!

this was sooo good my mom was licking up the beaters. u have to make sure the meringue is room temp before adding the butter, what i do is fill 2 ziploc bags with ice and hold it to the outside of bowl while it is beating. also found the sugar a bit less to added a few tbsp confectioners sugar while beating in butter...also substituted malibu rum for the extract. a must try!

Stupendous, wonderful, beyond scrumptious! Followed the recipe to the letter and was not disappointed. I don't even have a stand mixer, I just used my little Betty Crocker $15 hand mixer. Astounding frosting.

This is a tasty frosting. I could not get coconut extract and had to use imitation coconut flavor, which might not be as strong, but it gave it enough of a coconut taste. My fiasco came after finishing and being so pleased with this beautiful frosting, I kept it in the fridge for 2 days. When I was ready to use it, I must not have let it get room-temp enough and it separated into mush when I blended it. Well, I had to make it again, but it came out just as lovely the second time. Both times I kept a large bowl of ice water ready to cool my mixing bowl and the contents down before adding the butter. (6 minutes is not enough time to get it cooled). I will make this frosting again and again!

This was the first time I made buttercream and it came out wonderfully. I used vanilla extract instead of coconut to make it more kid friendly. Thanks to the other reviewers who gave tips on cooling the meringue. I continued to whip it for longer than 6 minutes and occasionally stopped to run cold water around the outside of the bowl. I will make this again with other flavors.

I've made this twice. Both times it came out beaurtifully. Silky smooth, not too sweet. I'm not a clock watcher, so I'm sure I beat it longer than 6 min. After adding the butter, I switched to the whisk attatchment on my mixer. The frosting turned out very fluffy.

This frosting has a light consistency, even though it has 1 1/2 cups of butter in it. I would make it again in a heartbeat!

I think the reason people had probems with consistency is that the meringue probably wasn't completely cooled before they cut in the butter. Beat the meringue an extra minute or two and feel the bottom of the bowl to make sure it's completely cooled. The buttercream only started to look "weird" after I added the last couple of pieces of butter, but I read the previous cook's comments and kept on beating (used a hand-held mixer); sure enough, within about a minute or two, it creamed together beautifully and made a delicious buttercream with a hint of coconut. It tasted just like it came from a bakery, maybe even better! Only thing - it barely made enough to fill and cover a three-layer cake.

OK, yes this can be very frustrating... Mine turned to icky, yucky mush. In a panic I called my mother who used to bake tons of buttercream frosted cakes when I was young (the buttercream scented memories is what prompted me to try this recipe in the first place). Just keep beating it she said. I pulled up a barstool next to the counter, grabbed a book and let it rip. About 5 minutes later it started sounding different and I peeked in to find perfect buttercream! Don't get discouraged, just keep whipping!

I followed this recipe step-by-step and it was a complete disaster. I ended up with a soggy, curdled mess that I had to throw away. Refrigerating it and beating it again just made it worse. I've made frosting like this in the past and never had any problems. I ended up frosting my cake with canned frosting.

This is really a suburb frosting. I used it for my rabbit that I made for our Easter party and everybody just had the greatest compliments about its flavor, and sticking power! Big blue ribbon!

This was a great frosting, it had a very smooth creamy texture. I used it to dress up the side of a german chocolate cake. I also used about 6 oz of cream of coconut added just before i cut in the butter.
