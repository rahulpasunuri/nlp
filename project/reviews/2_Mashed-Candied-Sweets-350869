I substituted brown sugar for the maple syrup and they were perfect.

All I could taste was the orange juice. I doubled the recipe and for the second batch I substitued the orange juice with milk. I also halved the maple syrup and added some cinnamon and nutmeg. I will try a different sweet potato casserole next time.
