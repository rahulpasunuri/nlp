@pmagruder please read the recipe again...you have to COOK the green bean mixture with fresh green beans for 30 minutes THEN only 5-10 minutes with the topping. If you only cooked the whole dish for 10 minutes I can understand why you thought they were underdone.

We like version 2, and we like using the fresh beans. In the past I have used frozen green beans and then only had in oven for 10 minutes then the last 5 with topping.

My mom served version II at Thanksgiving for many years when I was a kid, so I developed a taste for it. I made it a couple of times back in my deep poverty days, usually adding 1/2 a pound of shredded sharp cheddar to the bean mix. And it was as I had remembered. Fairly classic comfort food. Recently, however, I was reading another recipe here that featured a shitake-ginger cream sauce and I started to think how that might be a really nice sub for the the cream of mush soup. And man, it made the dish quite amazing. First time I did it I used fresh green beans, which i blanched, but the difference between that and frozen was basically nil. Next time I sauteed them with garlic, ginger and pepper, but even that didn't seem to make much of a diff. So I suggest going with frozen. I've been making it each Thanksgiving for a few years now, and people always really dig it. It looks like the classic version, but tastes pretty amazing.

'twas just ok but maybe because it was my first and so far only experience with Green Bean Casserole. I didn't hate it but I didnt love it either.

Made #2 and omitted the onions and used the Au Gratin with homemade bread crumbs. Beans should have been blanched or steamed a little. Very tasty.

I did the Cream of Tomato version. It was pretty dreadful.

An old favourite from my childhood! My Mom varied the second recipe sometimes by omitting the fried onions and sprinkling the top with nutmeg.

Well I cooked recipe #2 for and it turned out pretty good after I cooked the greenbeans! I dont know why it call's for fresh green beans and only in the oven for 10 minutes. That part was a disaster and luckily it was in a microwave dish, so I nuked it for 4 minutes and after that it was great. I seasoned it with seasoned salt instead of salt and added more crispy onions to the top and a bit of romano cheese. It was great and pretty tasty!

Every year I fought not too make this dish. One year in a rage of snobbiness, I created it "from scratch", I made a mushroom cream sauce, tossed with fresh grean beans added the home made crispy fried onion strings and topped with them as well as some crispy bacon, and it was enjoyed by all. However, it didn't translate into this big WOW Moment. Everyone,including myself felt the extra work didn't translate into anything more special than the orignal canned soup recipe. As for those who feel that recipe has no place on this site, I would argue that any dish that has fequented the dinner table as much as this one has every right to be here. And please don't rate recipes if you have not made them!!!!

I can only speak to the tomato soup version - I am really confused about the addition of horseradish. I included half the amount called for and the flavor was a bit disconcerting with vegetables. Perhaps the mushroom soup version is better...

Wow I am so glad to have had to look this up! I am amazed by all the snootiness by people who have never made or tasted this casserole. Its traditional green bean casserole and its great. Please if you don't make it your highness, please don't comment. That would be like a vegetarian going to all the meat dishes and saying how disgusting they are because they contain animal flesh!

If you didn't grow up with it or don't like it, why comment? There are those of us who feel that Green bean casserole II is a must have. To each his own. I don't waste my time commenting on food I don't like or don't cook, its not helpful to anyone. Merry Christmas!

While this recipe is not a great gastronomic delight, it carries memories for a lot of people who don't suffer from the "snob factor" of others who have written here and didn't even make the dish! It's basic comfort food. Nothing more. Nothing less. Those who would look down their noses and comment negatively on it simply because they are too much of a snob to even consider it, truly need to get a life!

I agree: I recently saw an ad on US Television for Campbell's Soup Green Bean Casserole with what appeared to be deep fried onion rings garnishing the outside of the dish: An obviously salt-starved 10 year old was salivating; his knife and fork at the ready. Despite having quite an eclectic upbringing, especially at Christmas, even MY Mother would know better than to disgrace her Christmas table with such a un-appetizing dish....I cannot imagine serving this at anytime, let alone Christmas Dinner. Perhaps it's a Canadian thing?

Green Bean Casserole II is comfort food for me-- I remember my mother making it for Christmas Dinner as sure as cranberry sauce and sage & onion stuffing! (With Turkey, of course!) This is the same recipe she always used, and have followed the family tradition.

SERIOUSLY !? I would not ever consider this"green bean casserole" to be appropriate for this site. When I see or hear someone mentioning this dish I cringe as it is not real food, Shalom

Originally developed by Campbells to sell more soup, this holiday staple suffers from canned ingredients and loads of salt. Alton Brown, on another site, has developed a modern day equivalent which is 1000 times better
