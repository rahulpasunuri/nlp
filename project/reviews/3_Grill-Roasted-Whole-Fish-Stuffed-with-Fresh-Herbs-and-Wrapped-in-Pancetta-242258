We made this for Christmas Eve and, although it was good, the prep and presentation was a disaster. Pancetta only comes in approximately 4-inch round slices so draping the fish was impossible. Subbing bacon may be possible but it sure doesn't taste anything like pancetta. This recipe doesn't say to cut slits in the fish so my husband didn't do it. The result was slightly uncooked fish that wouldn't come off the bone easily so there were lots of scrappy pieces!!

Super-easy and delicious! I made a red snapper wrapped in bacon and stuffed with thyme. When it was done, squeezed some lemon juice before serving. So good!

Fabulous! I used basil, parsley, sage and mint, S & P. Plus truffle oil. Everyone loved it. Make this if you have fresh trout.

In our case, a disaster. The whole thing caught on fire. It's become a favorite grilling gone wrong anecdote.

I used very fresh trout for this recipe - filled them with various herbs from my garden, including sage, thyme and cilantro. Holding them tightly together in a metal, fish grilling basket made the prosciutto stay where I wanted it and appeared to help with the flavor. VERY NICE!

Amazingly delicious and easy! I found very fresh trout and cooked not direct on the burners - of 6 burners 2 were lit on each side. I put it directly on the flame only as a grande finale. A bit of lemon juice on the table is perfect.

Just made this last night, using trout and mainly followed the recipe. I used 4 or 5 full length thyme sprigs inside each fish; not being able to find pancetta, I wrapped each trout with prosciutto instead. Grilled indirectly on a gas grill (two inside burners off, two outside on medium), I rubbed the grill surface with a piece of bacon to oil it before laying the fish on it. Moved the fish to the direct fire portion of the grill for the last minute or so (flipping) to provide a little char marks and flavor to the prosciutto. My girlfriend doesn't eat a lot of fish and she loved it! Will definitely make again, the herbs inside the fish provide wonderful flavor.
