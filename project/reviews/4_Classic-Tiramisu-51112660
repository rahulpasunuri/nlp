This turned out really great! A few suggestions: I used two loaf pans and stacked the tiramisu higher. A layer of lady fingers dipped in a mix of coffee & bourbon, then a layer of custard, another layer of lady fingers, and more custard. I also used a splash of bourbon in the custard rather than kahlua. Followed the recipe exactly otherwise. Make sure it has at least 24 hours to sit in the fridge before serving. I made it around 8 in the morning and had some from the first pan at dinner that night and it was a bit runny. But after another day in the fridge it had set properly.
