Have had this recipe for 8 years waiting for the right opportunity to make it. Sad to say that I was not impressed with this crust. Too hard to work with after only 1 hour int the refrigerator. I literally had to take it outside to the 90°F heat to soften it enough to roll out. Also, raspberries tend to be bitter, and aI think a sweeter crust would have complemented the filling better.

This crust recipe is basically like any other, but for the addition of vinegar, which I have encountered occasionally before. Perhaps the "rock hard" comes from overworking the pastry. I always make all my pastries in a food processor, but only pulse it and for just a couple minutes at the very most. If it takes longer than five minutes to make a crust, it's been worked too long and can yield a hard crust.

The filling was great, but I took the advice of other reviewers and used my own crust recipe. I am a big fan of making blackberry pies and the raspberries gave it a nice added flair.

First time I made this it turned out great. The second time, filling didn't thicken. Make sure fresh berries are used and let it set the 10 min with cornstarch and sugar mixture. No problems since. Has been a hit at family get togethers.

My grandmother taught me to bake pies when I was a child... now I'm a grandmother, so that gives you an idea of how much experience I have with pastry. I've never in my life baked a worse pie crust than this one. The words "rock hard" and "cement" describe it perfectly! What threw me was the heading..."exceptionally flaky crust"? No way, Jose! I wish I hadn't spent so much money on out of season berries!

Had great success with this pie and everyone loved it. My crust came out flaky and perfect! I've been amking pies for years and will add this to my favorites list. I don't understand the negative reviews.

Oh the horror! I baked this last summer before discovering these reviews. If I'd read them, I would never have attempted this crust. It was AWFUL, to put it politely. Like others, I scooped out the filling and served it over ice cream. Live and learn.

This was one of the best pies I've ever made (I usaully only make apple). I have never made my ouwn crust before (always buy store bought) and this crust came out great. Will definitely make this again next summer!

I used my standard crust for the pie - half butter and half Crisco - flaky with good flavor. I also used half corn starch and half minute tapioca, and it firmed up nicely after cooling. Blackberries and raspberries ripen at different times in Oregon, so I used all blackberries (8 cups). Finally, I brushed the crust with an egg/milk mixture, resulting in a golden crust, unlike the pale pie on the cover.

I didn't want to risk a bad pie crust after reading all the other comments about "cement," etc., so I used my own. The filling was tasty but thin. Have other people had problems with berry pies getting the juice to thicken?

My guests were very impressed! The crust was easy to make, and was flaky and absorbant, perfect to soak up the berry juice, as well as the melted vanilla ice cream on each plate. I used the food processor for making the dough, which I recommend. I substituted blueberries for blackberries, with great results. As for hard crust that some others noted: make sure you don't roll out the dough with your hands - the oil on your fingers will ruin it!

Made it for a family dinner party. Liked it a lot. I didn't find the crust very flaky - a bit too firm. Had to try it - it looked fabulous on the magazine cover!

I thought this was one of the most delicious pies I've ever made. I used a deep dish pie plate and increased the ingredients by 1/4. Everyone at my dinner party loved it and asked for the recipe. I just e-mailed recipe to my neighbor, whose husband said it was the best pie he's ever tasted.

The 2 times I've made this in the past week, the crust has been delicious. It's a bit hard to roll out, and I think it's rather thick, but I happen to love crusts that way. Plus it wonderfully absorbs the delicious fruit juices. I use all 6 tbsp. of water, and needed to cook for more than 1 1/2 hrs, rather than 50 min. The filling is out of this world. Perfectly tart. Every one of my guests LOVED it. I also used the crust for the strawberry rhubarb pie (recipe from Epic.). Also a huge hit.

I used the crust recipe twice. First time with an open top Strawberry Pie. EVERYONE liked it. The 2nd time, I used the filling recipe but used all blackberries. Everyone loved it. I found the crust difficult to roll after chilling overnight. But after leaving it out for about half an hour, it was fine.

Exceptionally flaky crust? Don't think so! It baked up like cement. Bad bad bad.

Followed the advice of the others and used a different pie crust. Filling was good, not too sweet.

Even though my husband has been baking pies since he was a child, I thought he might have made a mistake after I tasted this crust. I guess not --after reading the previous review, I realize he probably didn't. Our crust was also unusually hard. I know that all butter crusts are sometimes tough to handle, but this one was really something else. The filling was yummy, but this pie was kind of a waste of good berries.

The filling was great, and I would make it again, but use my own fruit pie crust recipe. For some odd reason this crust baked up hard as a rock. I have no idea what went wrong, but I ended up scooping out the filling and used it as a sauce over vanilla ice cream.
