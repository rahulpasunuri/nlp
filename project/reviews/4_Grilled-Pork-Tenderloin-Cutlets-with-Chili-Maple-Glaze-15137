This recipe is too much work. Pork tenderloins don't need to be brined. And, this dish is easier if the tenderloins are pan-seared whole and finished in the oven (350 for about 20 minutes). The maple-chili glaze wasn't great. I added about a teaspoon of cider vinegar, salt and pan juices and it improved immensely.

This was so simple, fast and delicious. It will definitely become a regular for us. I did not brine and I cut my tenderloins horizontally and then into chunks, no flattening. I grilled at medium for a few minutes and then finished off over indirect heat. Very moist and flavorful...and fast. Loved this for a quick summer grill recipe. Served with couscous and grilled zucchini. Yum!

Easy and excellent. I let the sauce boil down much further than 1/3 c and it just got tastier and tastier. The heat was very subtle, but still there for sure.

Sorry,I thought I was reviewing the tenderloin with maple syrup using the 5 spice powder and chili paste--I've never tried this one.

The best thing about this recipe is how easy it is to prepare. These are ingredients I almost always have on hand. And it is flavorful. For a larger tenderloin, double the sauce.

This is a great, VERY easy recipe, better than the vast majority of recipes for it's degree of ease. How it got a 75% rating when everyone gave it a 3 or 4 makes no sense, so try it, YOU'LL LIKE IT
