I made this tart for the 2nd time and I love this recipe! It's worth the effort. Be sure to more apples than the recipe calls for and watch them closely while roasting. Try this - you wont' be disappointed and the aroma and the presentation are irresitible.

What a great recipe! Made this for a company Xmas dinner. Truly delicous and beautiful. I didn't find it difficult to make but it does have a few steps to it and it does take time. I took the advice of other reviewers, bought extra apples (better to have too much than too little and you can then choose the best slices to place in your tart)also rolled out the dough, placed the bottom of the springform pan over the dough and flipped it over. Easy. My suggestion is to pay the extra money for organic apples because this tart allows the flavors of the apples to shine. This will be my go to applie pie receipe from now on. Loved it.

I've made this twice now and it is HEAVENLY though labor intensive. Fortunately, as other cooks have pointed out, much of the work can be done a day in advance. If I'm having a special dinner (including Thanksgiving), I can finish making it in the morning as it doesn't have to be served hot.

This was a huge hit at an office birthday party. It's a very nice change from an apple pie too. It was time consuming in that you have to baby sit the apples while roasting. I had some finish in 12 minutes and others in 40 even though I used apples of the same size. I used a 12" springform pan and tripled the custard recipe. It took about 1 hour 20 minutes to bake. I served it with cinnamon ice cream. This is definitely a keeper.

Wonderful recipe, with the following notes: I made a 12" springform, so I doubled the crust, (crust needs more moisture, so I used 6 egg yolks total), used 18 gigantic honeycrisp apples, (only cut into 8ths), and triple the butter/custard mixture. I roasted the apples for 12 minutes total, on three pans, rotating both level and spinning the pan for each. Taste the apples before using them, you may need to adjust sugar level, (I regretted not doing this). I lined the springform with aluminum foil, which made taking it out of the pan MUCH easier. Try carving slices with an electric knife, it will keep the pieces looking nice and neat. The tart makes for an elegant presentation, and if done over two days, is easy. The tart crust is hassle free, and has a wonderful taste.

A ton of work, even with spouse as sous chef. I know, I had been warned... but I would say it was not worth the hours invested. Although presentation was beautiful (photos don't do it justice), I was not wowed by the taste. I followed the recipe exactly, except mine needed over 90 minutes cooking time and I used 12 large apples. I do like star anise; however did not find that flavor predominant when blended with the other spices.

I'm not sure why everyone talks about how much work this is, as it doesn't seem to be a lot more work than making an average pie pastry and processing apples. Given, this takes a LOT more apples! I made a 12" tart for a large party, so I doubled the ingredients, and honestly I could have used another two apples. The apple variety is *absolutely essential* to the dish's success. I added yuzu zest to the custard, to give it a subtle citrus flavor. This is obviously not a common ingredient, but I would add 1/2 an orange's worth of zest if I didn't have the yuzu. The tart pastry was wonderful. Don't forget to line the bottom of the springform with heavy duty aluminum foil! The tart crumbles when taken out of the pan. MAKE IT OVER TWO DAYS FOR SURE.

I made this for the second time again this year. Yes, you definitely need at least 15 apples and the more uniform the better looking your pie will be. I would never cut them up in to small pieces as one person suggested b/c the whole point is for you to array them on end - it's what make it beautiful! I also added a couple T. of ice water into the dough to pull it together. I refrigerated the crust for about 5-6 hours (instead of overnight) and there was no bad result. Make sure you cool your apples completely before putting them in your crust and use a spatula to help you life them if they are soft. I agree - I was trying to get them to brown, as suggested, but that is not really important since they'll be in again later for an hour or so.I think the butter needs to be on a bit hotter to get it to brown (not low) but watch it.

This is a delicious tart. I made it to take in to work for a coworker's birthday. The flavors are fantastic, and I like the rough texture of everything. I varied from the recipe by cutting the apples into smaller chunks - first in 1/8ths instead of quarters and then halving the 1/8ths crosswise. Otherwise I followed the recipe. The only other issue I had was the crust recipe. Two egg yolks was not enough moisture to bring the dry ingredients together into "moist clumps." I worked a few tablespoons of ice water into it like you would for any pastry, and it was fine. Was this an error in the recipe? I loved the scent of it baking, with the spiced butter. Delicious.

I have baked this apple tart every year for the past 8 years (since it first came out in '01). This tart is, hands down, one of the best, most beautiful and delicious desserts in my repertoire. Worth every bit of the effort. Some tips I've learned over the years of making it... Like the last reviewer, the number of apples is more important than the weight and you need a minimum of 14 to 16 apples to get the job done. Also, stick with the recommended Braeburns or Golden Delicious... I tried Granny Smiths once and they were both too tart at didn't have the structure to stand up to the pre-baking (If the apples turn to mush, they are not usable). Pre-bake them ONLY until the are just becoming tender, probably much less time than the recommended 40 minutes. Please use the spices as recommended when preparing the browned butter!!! They are what make this dessert the spectacular and unique showstopper it is!! It is not supposed to be a "variation on and apple pie", it's a different creature entirely. And sooo worth the trouble! I also recommend whipped cream as and accompaniment vs. ice cream, which I feel would be too sweet. This is a wonderful dessert.

If you're going to go to the trouble of making this beast, read the reviews. It's really beautiful but it is labor-intensive -- and worth every minute for the WOW factor. The previous reviews were so helpful -- thanks! I roasted 16 large Golden Delicious and had a few quarters left over (nice, in case some were too smooshy). I tossed the quarters w/ lemon juice as I went along to avoid browning, tossed them w/ butter afterwards, then roasted them for 25 minutes -- plenty long. The crust was fine to work with: i just put my springform bottom on the crust itself then flipped it over. The remaining dough I formed into 4 pieces that were about 2" high by 5- 6" long ON PLASTIC WRAP then fitted those onto the sides. I wished I'd used pie weights, as my crust got a bit droopy-looking, despite being refrigerated overnight. I forgot to sprinkle the apples with sugar and did so with about 5 minutes left to roast and they turned out fine. The only problem I had was that butter leaked out of the pan while baking...and I'm not sure from where! The custard set up nicely. Be aware that if, like me, you use ground Star Anise and cinnamon (used whole cloves and vanilla bean), it will color the butter and make it harder to tell when it's actually browned. Whew! It's a lot of work, but gorgeous and delicious. Ice cream is a must.

This was such a huge hit for Thanksgiving last year that I made it again this year. Lessons learned from first time around - the number of apples is more important than the weight. I found that 14 very large Organic Golden Delicious apples from Whole Foods (where the fruit is beautifully uniform) were just right to fill the crust. They weighed in at over 7 lbs. Also recommend tossing the apples with your lemon juice as you go along, and then drizzling with the melted butter when all are quartered and peeled. The 40 minute baking time is excessive - 20-25 minutes is more like it. Otherwise, you'll have applesauce or mush, which won't stand up on end. The crust is extremely dry (the only liquid being the eggs) and very difficult to roll out. Don't sweat it - easy to simply press the dough into your springform pan and along the sides. I have cheated both times by using ground spices instead of whole, and strained them out after browning the butter. As I said in earlier review - plan ahead with this one. It's time consuming, but can be stretched over two days and is well worth the effort.

This is an exceedingly labor-intensive recipe, but I would absolutely make it again for special occasions. Truly a remarkable dessert that impressed everyone who had it for our Thanksgiving meal. The crust itself is a superb work, but has to be done right -- minimize over-working the dough to keep it flaky when it comes out. I also found the apples barely were adequate in quantity, so it may be worth preparing the recipe with a few extras so as not to run short. An apple corer/slicer is very helpful to speed the process. I also found that the apples can get too soft when baking if there is excess of the butter/lemon-juice liquid on the pan. I'm keeping this as a special recipe for the future, for times when extravagance really can be appreciated. Everyone was amazed.

Given the number of positive reviews, I'm clearly in the minority but this recipe simply is not worth the time or expense. It's also painfully heavy which just doesn't work with something like an apple tart- there is just way too much butter in it. It also is hugely time and labor intensive without much payoff. It tasted good, no doubt, but if you want something similar that will save you several hours, calories and money (3 sticks of butter plus vanilla beans and 5.5 lbs of apples isn't cheap!) google the recipe for "the apple lady's apple cake." it's 100x better and more healthy. and QUICK!

I'm usually not able to find the time for multi-day recipes, but I needed to do something with a pile of apples I got from Oak Glen (CA). This recipe is so exceptionally good that all the steps were well worth the effort. I've always wished that such recipes would be written with time tables at the beginning in order to keep people in a rush (like me) from missing some of the timing details. So my advice is prepare this recipe to make a big hit a your gathering - just be sure to read the multi-day instructions carefully!

To be fair, anything with this much butter is bound to be good, but what is it about this recipe that makes it absolutely scrumptious? Is it the anise? I could barely keep myself from rushing over to the oven and digging in whenever I caught a whiff of it baking from the other side of the apartment. Incredibly fragrant and tastes just as good. I have me a new favorite recipe for apple pie. And I may just put anise in everything I bake from now on too.

When I first tasted this recipe, I thought that I preferred normal apple pie. Then, however, I ate practically the whole thing. I've got to say that the blend of flavors and textures is awesome, and I think I now like this better than normal apple pie. I didn't think that the apples were too mushy, and to the person who asked why roast the apples first--it adds a nice depth of flavor, and if you didn't roast the apples first, you'd probably end up with half-cooked apples, burnt crust, and burnt custard. I have to admit that I left out the star anise, partially becuase I couln't find any, and partially because I hate the flavor of licorice. I thought that it was very tasty without it. I cooked it for 110 minutes, and it came out perfect. The recipe may be time consuming, but a lot of it can be done ahead of time. Plus, although the recipe says to eat it within 8 hours, I think that it is better the next day.

I decided to use a pastry blender instead of using a food processor for the crust. Big mistake. The crust needs to have the butter distributed in tiny pieces. My crust melted during baking with streams of butter dripping in the oven. I started over again (just hours before guests arrived) using a Cuisinart and didn't have time to chill the crust overnight. Came out fine. Note that the browned butter picks up a lot of the flavor of the dish, so make sure it is cooked until "browned". All of the vanilla seeds should be in the custard, not left behind after straining. I used an 11-inch springform pan and 6.5 lbs of Braeburn apples. As I got closer to the center of the shell when placing the apples, I started running out of apples so I sliced some in half. This gave the center 5" of the tart a nice "lower level" look that resembled a "carnation" or "Outback restaurant Bloomin' Onion" appetizer. (I prefer the carnation :-)

What is the point of roasting the apples before baking?

Food generally behaves for me, but pie crust is my weakness. That's why I turn to tart recipes for the wow factor at Thanksgiving - dough that is very forgiving, and professional quality results. This was indeed time-consuming, but hands- down worth the effort. A huge hit at our table for eleven, with one piece left for son to take home. Read the recipe through thoroughly and plan ahead. I prepared the dough and baked apple quarters on Tuesday night, both to chill overnight. Pre-baked the crust and finished it all off on Wednesday. After completely cooling, removed sides of pan and loosely covered with plastic overnight. As others have said, amazingly light, considering the 6 lbs. of apples used. I found that 14 large Golden Delicious were just right to fill the shell, and the tart came out identical to the photo. Will surely make this show-stopper a Thanksgiving tradition.

I thought this was very good but not worth all the time involved. It was good but I expect spectacular with the amount of prep involved. Yes, you could cut corners and probably end up with the same results but I don't think I will make this again. Very tasty but with this amount of time I would make the semolina souffle cake (foodandwine.com) - that's a show stopper!

This was a big hit at my bookclub - it looked and tasted lovely. One tip though - I would prepare more apples than you think you will need - I didn't have enough, and ended up laying a few flat to fill the middle, and topping up with the bitter filling. Nonetheless a really delicious tart.

wow -- i had a cooking fiasco. started this dish about 9 hours before i needed it (i am not known for reading thru recipes!). only chilled dough for about 5 hours. came out perfect -- looks hard but is melt in your mouth buttery and light. only had 12 apples, some of which looked pretty wimpy (8 gold delish and 4 fujis (!)) started off by thinly slicing (because i didnt read the recipe close enough) and then quartered the rest. didnt have whole cloves or anise, so i just browned butter and then added vanilla extract and ground cloves (i first put them in when the butter warmed but the temp was too high and had to throw out the whole batch of butter and start again). dumped all the apples into the baked crust and poured egg mix over. may not have looked as pretty as the picture but it was fantastic. it was the first to disappear at a wine and dessert party (and the competition was stiff!)this is a pretty hearty/hardy recipe to withstand all my mess ups.

Ok, yes, it's time consuming, but OMG SO WORTH IT!!! I changed a few things: left out the star anise (hate it), switched the apples for Granny Smith, and (I know... cheating) I didn't refrigerate it overnight. But none of that made a difference. This was the most popular dessert at Thanksgiving, and we reheated it in the toaster oven a few days later and it was just as delicious. This is one for the books.

This was time consuming, but let it be known that it was time well spent as it was extremely tasty. I didn't use the anise (i was feeling too lazy to get it), and I didn't have the 10 inch pan so I made the tart in two 5 inch pie pans, they were so cute and little. I'm making it again for a dinner party this weekend.

I am an apple tart freak, and I consider this just about the best one ever. I admit that I opted for traditional spices - I might try the ones called for when I just saute a few apples some time, but wasn't willing to take the plunge for Christmas Eve. But the crust, browned butter filling, and roasted apples made for a sublime combination. I used Jonathan apples, which are my favorite for baking.

A nice twist on traditional apple pies. I did omit the anise to avoid problems but may try it next time with a more adventurous crowd. I did cut the roasting time a little shorter in light of other reviewers' concens about mushy apples.

The anise gave this an unusual flavor so may not be the greatest if you are dealing with guests expecting a traditional apple dish, but the presentation is fantastic. I bought 12 large apples and had to forrage for 2 more because it wasn't enough to fill the crust. It also took and hour and a half to bake.

I served this for Christmas and everyone (except me)loved it. For looks I would give it a 4 fork rating but I thought the apples were too soft and I even used granny smith. Everyone else said "perfection". If I made this again I wouldn't roast the apples as long but don't tell my husband!

"Did you buy this in a bakery?" was the first thing out of my dinner guests' mouth. It really is a beautiful tart and very tasty. As a bonus, you can start making it 2 days ahead of time. I thought at first that I had too many appples, but it really turned out just perfect.

The tart I made turned out great - except it was a little too sweet. In my case, I also used pears in the filling, and cooked the thinly sliced apples in a pan on the top of the stove. Instead of ending up with baked apples, I got soft warm apples in syrup. So if you want to reduce the cooking time by doing it on the stove, reduce the sugar you put on the apples and use larger fruit pieces. The tart crust was wonderful though. perfect. I also added crushed almonds to the bottom of the tart. I will definitely try this again.

I substitued so many things that I am embarrased to enlist them!. Some friends wanted me to make this recipe but we were on a small (really small) town and kitchen at the moment, I worked through the recipe as well as I could and it came out delicious and beautiful!, despite of the difficulties I thought it was easy. I followed the advice and used only one star and a half, perfect. We did almonds on the crust, it tastes good but I think it tastes better the original way: simple, the apples and spices deserve all the atention. A cozy end to a winter dinner.

This pie was very delicious. The star anise adds a twist on the usual apple pie spices. My recommendation, though is to cut out 1 of the star anise. I was good, but almost over powering. It was a huge hit with my husband who is an Apple Pie connoiseur. Excellent holiday treat.

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner. It was beautiful and delicious. Everyone oohed and ahhed. I couldn't find Star Anise so I used anise seed and strained it out when I was finished browning the butter. I didn't really taste the anise. I will look harder for star anise next time. I also used salted butter with no adverse results.

This was a delicious end to Christmas Dinner. I didn't have unsalted butter, so used regular, with no apparent ill effects. This dish received rave reviews from everyone!
