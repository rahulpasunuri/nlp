This recipe doesn't make sense as written: there's nothing about drying out the bread beforehand, yet you're supposed to soak the bread for 20 minutes, and cook it in only 6 minutes. That doesn't seem possible. Clarifying the butter through cheesecloth is a bit fussy for a Sunday morning (and rather redundant with a non-stick pan). We had to use a much shorter soak, brown on the stove and finish cooking in the oven, 325 degrees. This recipe only works with some significant alterations, which kinda defeats the purpose.

I made the recipe without the cornflakes or the rum and it still yielded mouth- watering results. My teenage son and college age visitor ate with gusto (as did I). I am making it again for house guests tomorrow. Highly recommended.

We make this french toast every sunday and I have used challah, regular white bread and plain bagels. All with great results. A few ideas: crunch the corn flakes so they stick easier and the toast will cook better. Put a pad of butter under each piece and after turning so it cooks more thouroughly. Use less milk if using regular bread or bagels. I use half as much milk as called for in the recipe. I only dip the bread in the egg for a few moments to coat it, DON'T LET IT SIT IN THERE MORE THAN 1 MINUTE- or you will have soggy french toast. I cook in an electric skillet at 375 to 400 degrees and they have to cook a long time (about 10+ minutes) to be fully done. Overall this recipe is easy to modify to make fit for you. I don't usually have the challah bread since it requires a special trip to the store. FRESH plain bagels taste very similiar anyway.

This dish is a little time comsuming to prepare, but was delicious. The corn flakes gave it a lovely crunch- once the bread was fried they formed a great crust. I didn't soak the bread for 10 minutes each side, I cut the soak time in half, for a 10 minute total soak. The bread was a little soggy on some parts and a little dry on others. I put the cinn/sugar mixture (with vanilla sugar, and little nutmeg) on top when it was still hot so it melted down a little. The rum gives this some nice depth, and all in all, it was a great breakfast.

I'm not rating, because I didn't do the cornflakes thing. I may someday, but I just can't imagine crunch on my french toast. Just wanted to say that my family has always used the vanilla/rum combination for this kind of thing, and it's wonderful. I made this with our local bakery's apple pie bread. For those who feel that soaking time is too long, perhaps you're not letting your bread dry out enough before. I always slice mine the evening before, and let it sit out overnight. That way it absorbs the egg mixture without becoming soggy.

Easy to prepare and very good. The rum adds an interesting depth to the flavor.

Way too much here. Much easier version (from a Diner in North Carolina when we lived there). DON'T soak the bread! Make the French Toast like you normally would (using a thick sliced bread - Challah would be fine). Crush the corn flakes (ziplock bag - good job for the kids) and put on a flat plate (need enough to coat all pieces of bread - both sides). Use the eggs, a dab of milk, dab of maple syrup, few sprinkles of cinnamin, and combine. DIP the bread (both sides) in the egg mixture, then put onto the corn flakes, press lightly to cover, turn, then put in a pre-heated skillet or electric fry pan coated in non-stick spray. Cook until golden, flip and remove when it is to your liking. MUCH better and not as sweet (don't use Frosted Flakes, unless you are looking for a real sugar high). Can be served with or without syrup (the real stuff only!)

This recipe is nice because it is fast and simple, but I found it to be rather bland! I'm not a huge fan.

Haven't made this yet, but I had to respond to the cook from Toronto who didn't know what Challah is and to expand on the previous explanation. While Challah is a "traditional" Jewish bread that is eaten on holidays, it is basically egg bread that is twisted into a braid. It is sometimes made with raisins and I've even seen it with chocolate chips. It is SUPER good and is used quite often for non-traditional purposes (sandwiches, french toast, etc.). Being Jewish and from California, it's hard for me to believe that someone wouldn't know what Challah is, but I hope this adds something to the previous explanation!

I love this french toast- its a sure fire winner when I have sleepovers- Served with maple syrup and pecans you just can't go wrong- Brings back memories of waking up at the Plaza on my honeymoon.

To the cook from Toronto who inquired as to what challah is, here's the definition I found: Served on the Sabbath, holidays, other ceremonial occasions and for everyday consumption, challah is a traditional Jewish yeast bread. It's rich with eggs and has a light, airy texture. Though it can be formed into many shapes, braided challah is the most classic form. © Copyright Barron's Educational Services, Inc. 1995 based on THE FOOD LOVER'S COMPANION, 2nd edition, by Sharon Tyler Herbst.

HELP! I have not tried to make it yet but I would like to - I just need to know what challah is???

Definitely NO cornflakes, and do not soak for 20 minutes! I found it to be soggy if I did anything more than just dip on each side. The flavor is good, though. I served w/cinnamon & powdered sugar, and drizzled w/syrup. So sweet I could get a cavity just thinking of it.

The key to cooking this is to make sure that it puffs a little bit, that way you know it's cooked throughout. In my experience, 3 minutes each side is just not long enough, it's more like 7 minutes each side on medium heat. When it's cooked, and not soggy in the middle, it's spectacular.

The idea sounded good, but I was disappointed in the recipe. Although the crust was crispy, the center came out soggy. Maybe, soaking for 20 min. in the egg mixture is a bit too long??

If you've ever been to the Plaza you would know how delicious this french toast really is. I find it hard to believe that this bread is soaked for 20 min. I found it made it somewhat soggy and not like what I have had at the Plaza.

Did not like this type of variation on the typical french toast. It could have been the cornflakes that just made it taste strange. I would imagine without the cornflakes it would have been delicious!

Very good recipe. My husband couldn't believe that French toast could be this good.

It came out very nicely. I thought it could have been a tad bit sweeter though. (Had to add a lot of syrup on it.) I'll definitely make it again!

I would venture to say this is the best french toast I have experimented with. The dish has a good bit of depth which separates it from your standard french toast. To add a twist I tried the recipe subbing buttermilk in place of the milk and used challah with raisins with good results. Tip: Before placing in the pan, push down the slices to be sure the corn flakes are well adhered.
