Added garlic and spring onions before adding the mushrooms. Omitted the capers. It was a big hit.

Saute one thin-sliced green garlic along with mushrooms and green onion. Left out capers and oregano, used 1/2 tsp dried basil, tastes great and easy!

1st frittata I've ever made. It was delicious! I'll definitely make it again.

I've never made frittata before and liked the combination of flavors. It was very good (not fantastic), but also a bit too salty for our taste. Perhaps too much cheese on top or the capers added to the salty flavor. I would try it again possibly deleting the capers.
