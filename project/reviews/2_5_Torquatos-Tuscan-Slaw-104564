Nice change from the routine cabbage and carrot slaw. Salting and draining the slaw gave it a nice crunch. But the red onions can easily overpower the flavors. Good for cold lunches.

Simple, good, and a fine accompaniment for grilled Italian dishes. I had it with chicken marinated in lemon juice,olive oil and black pepper. Can be made several hours ahead. Used a sharp knife to do the shredding, with satisfactory results.
