Very cool recipe. I can get locally caught squid at my market for $2/lb, so this was a really cheap and elegant, light dinner. Even without experience, cleaning the squid was easy. I cooked it in a hot oiled skillet, added the white beans, oregano and parsley, some raw shallot, chili flakes, and tomatoes to warm, then served on a bed of arugula, drizzled with lemon juice, balsamic, more olive oil, and lots of pepper. Paired well with a red Burgundy, 2009 Cote Chalonnaise.

This is a very pretty and very tasty salad! I cut the squid before I steamed, doubt it made any difference. Had made cannellini beans w/garlic and sage the day before. Probably used more cherry tomatoes and arugula than called for, but I was using up before I went to Farmer's Market that weekend. Will make again, as long as husband continues to clean the squid!

Fabulous salad! I was trying to find a calamari salad like one we had in La Jolla last year and this one is wonderful. Made this last night and was not sold on it - but I had the rest for lunch today and after it had chilled overnight it was perfect - definitely recommend chilling it for at least a couple of hours or overnight before serving. The texture of the beans and calamari was much improved, and the arugula was tamed too. I used frozen calamari bodies and tenacles, canned beans and less than half the amount of olive oil it calls for and it was fabulous. This is a very impressive salad, can't wait to serve it for guests for a nice lunch or starter salad for dinner, with the added plus of being able to make it ahead of time.

Very delicious, beautiful presentation, easy and fast to prepare! Definitely will make this again. It's pretty enough to serve at a dinner party as a first course. I used two full bunches of arugula instead of just 3 ounces so it wouldn't wilt down so much from the lemon juice. I also used canned cannellini beans but I'm sure the dish would taste even better if I'd started with dry beans. Next time I might add a dash of hot sauce to the dressing, or maybe some crushed red pepper flakes. Finely sliced sweet red onion would probably be a good addition as well.

I loved this combination of flavors. I used canned beans so added a minced clove of garlic - I sort of marinated the steamed squid and the canned beans with lemon and garlic to get the flavor of the homemade beans. It was a smash hit for a dinner party. This will be a go-to recipe for me.
