This recipe needs salt and pepper! I would add it either during the vegetable saute or just before you put it into the oven. I might also add some garlic next time, as is called for in traditional veal osso buco. This was easy to prepare and quite tasty. I will make it again.

Oh, I forgot to say that the other recipe on this site, the one from cookie, doesn't seem to have gremolata, but I'd make it anyway. If you really want to be authentic, make it with very finely chopped garlic, too (the gremolata). With all that parsley & lemon, it doesn't overpower, and it's GREAT with osso bucco. (mmmmm)

I've not tried this particular recipe, but I'm a food professional and am not in the least surprised to find ppl say it was dull as dishwater (my words, not their's - chuckles). 1) Gremolata is insanely wonderful stuff, and if this recipe has introduced you to it, then YAY. :) I imagine it saves this recipe for some of you, but read point 2. 2) The reviewers who said 'sear it first' are completely right. Osso Bucco is NOT stew: The browning is essential to the classic taste. 3) Crock pot. (Shudder) Once again, oven braising yields a far superior product, because it cooks just a bit differently: It allows for a bit of reduction and adds that note of caramelization. 4) Canned toms? Not on my watch. They're great for some things, but not for Osso Bucco, as they are just not complex enough. Use real tomato sauce, even if it comes from a jar. Note: get a good one. The cheaper ones are loaded with salt. Worse, they are loaded with sugar and will throw your taste off on either level. IN SUM: Try the other turkey osso bucco on this site. Or at least look at its method. If you liked this one, the other one will blow you away. If you hated this one, please don't give up on the idea before you read the second one. Happy Cooking & Happy Eating, My Friends!

Awful. No other word captures it.

This is not a spectacular recipe, admittedly, but it's easy, cheap and filling - and your house will smell delicious while it's braising. Freezes wonderfully too! I make it about once a month, September through March - and I've got my first batch in the oven today, on this rainy, dreary day. I've done it in the crockpot, in a slow oven and stovetop. I always brown the turkey meat (I buy two drumsticks and two thighs; not ken on turkey breast) and have used thyme, rosemary, summer savory and CURRY POWDER, on occasion, to flavour it. I often add a cup or two of frozen green beans or fresh green peas towards the end. Serve with brown rice or over pasta - whatever you're feeling that day. This is my "go to" recipe . . .

One and a half forks, really. Easy, economical, healthy and boring. I browned meat instead of veggies, deglazed the pan with white wine and added Italian spices 4 hours into cooking but otherwise followed the recipe. Despite using good ingredients such as all natural turkey and fine Italian tomatoes this dish lacks in flavor and gains no complexity form slow cooking. I served it with gremolata (it would have been even blander without that zing) and a drizzle of good EVOO but even that did not help. Some serious changes need to be made unless you like your food bland and unassuming. The consistency makes it unfit as a pasta sauce, but it might take to polenta better. However, I would prefer it as a stew in bowls served with some crusty bread to sop up the juices. Gremolata

Served this Christmas day as family had already had traditional turkey feast a few days prior. Couldn't find the turkey legs so just bought small fresh whole turkey and parted it out, reserving back, neck and wings for a future stock, and one breast for nice dinner for two. Really ended up beginning a great money saver too. Added more veggies and baked in 300 degree oven for about 4 1/2 hours in covered terracotta casserole. Ultimate in comfort food served with polenta but fancy enough for company. Really lovely meal that takes care of itself while you take care of your guests. Next time will serve with saffron risotto.

We've made this a few times now and it's really scrumptous - great winter dish. Highly recommended.

So yummy and easy. I threw in extra veggies like sweet potatoes. I reduced the liquid at the end using a bit of cornstarch. My slow cooker seems to overdo everything. I set it to 5 hours on low, then came home and put it on for an extra 30 min. 3 1/2 forks for yumminess and and extra 1/2 for convenience.

Made in the oven as others did... It was basically just a good turkey stew, but that's about it. Not bad overall, but nothing to write home about.

I thought I invented this! I couldn't resist the less than $3 package of turkey thihgs at the store and came up with what I call Turkey Buco--tasty, good for you and much cheaper than vewl shanks!I don't put carrot and celery, just a lot of garlic, white wine and tomatoes.Either slow cooker or top of stove.

I can't believe this doesn't get a 100%! I made it tonight for the 50 sorority girls I cook for and it was delicious. I substituted all boneless, skinless turkey thighs because that's what my food purveyor had. And, since I don't have 10 slow cookers for all those girls, I cooked it in a 300 degree oven for 3 hours. Fantastic! The gremolata is key. It adds that je ne cest quois at the end. Easy enough for a weeknight, "fancy" enough for company.

I haven't made this, but I have made similar turkey braises (stovetop/oven combo rather than slowcooker). You need to sear the meat first. Also, I doubt the braising liquid will reduce sufficiently in a slowcooker. It reduces perfectly in about 2.5 hours in a 275F oven. Remove the meat and then strain the sauce through a chinois, pressing on the vegetables. Why would you do this with ostrich? That's such an expensive meat, best eaten as steak. The purpose of braising is to turn tougher and cheaper - but more flavorful - cuts of meat like turkey thighs into delicious dishes where the meat falls off the bone. Also, I assume you were kidding about the microwave.

This was pretty good and tasty as a fall dish. I'm making it for the second time in 2 weeks. Very very easy.

We loved this recipe, it was so easy and smelled so good while it was cooking. Will definately make this one again. The only addition I made was adding some poultry seasoning.

I used the method that the cook from Memphis did. It came out awesome. My whole family loved it. I served it over polenta. Great comfort food.

Unlike the previous reviewer I am quite impressed with the flavour of this dish. I used turkey breast (cubed and fried to seal the juices) and added it to the sauce; this reduced the simmering time to a mere two hours.

As reviewers, St Paul Chef & Trixie, "said" .. a disappointing recipe. After the turkey was cooked, I tasted the sauce & found it, very, flavourless. Turkey sandwiches tomorrow & tonight, added many ingredients to the sauce so it will be suitable for pasta.

The receipe was a great success with my family. I, too, made it in a very slow oven.

I really like this dish. I've made it twice, the second time using the gremolata, which I think really makes this dish.

I was very disappointed in this recipe. While the sauce had a wonderful flavor, the turkey did not absorb it and, while tender, was quite tasteless. I would be tempted to use the sauce for chicken or fish.

We loved this recipe. I don't own a crock pot, so I used the reviewer's suggestion to cook it in the oven. I served it over polenta. Yum.

My only variations were that I used only turkey thighs and that I oooked it on top of the stove for 2 hours instead of in a crock pot. It was very tasty and tender. I had planned to serve it with left over rice but did not have enough so served it with boiled new potatoes. My husband thought it was GREAT!

I took some of the reviewers suggestions - I used only turkey thighs (4) and browned them. I made a quick (thank you pressure cooker) stock with a package of turkey necks. I used the same amount of vegetables, added some thyme after I had deglazed the pan with the wine. I drained the tomatoes well and used the rich turkey stock I made in place of the juice from the tomatoes. I added a piece of lemon rind and a piece of orange rind and cooked it covered in a 350 degree oven for 2-1/2 hours and then uncovered it and cooked it 30 minutes more to let the sauce thicken. Served it over some noodles and it was wonderful. I think slow cookers have limited uses and ruin lots of things.

I made a few slight changes, but we thought it was great. I first browned the turkey. I did not use the thyme as a rub, and I used bell pepper instead of carrot. We also skipped the grematola. I served it to my husband over egg noodles, but ate it as a stew for myself (lower carb). I have already forwarded the recipe on!

This recipe went horribly awry. It smelled (and looked) delicious while cooking; the only variation I made was to use red onion (didn't have any white or yellow) and used boneless, skinless turkey thighs. We ended up with a bland spaghetti sauce, basically. My kids summed it up by saying, "What is this yucky stuff?" Maybe it's just me...but we won't be having this again.

Wow! This dish is tasty and light, and as smooth as velvet. I couldn't find an entire turkey leg at the market, so I just used the drumsticks instead of buying a whole bird. I first browned the meat before placing in the slow cooker. Only used about a half onion, and added a daikon radish to make up for it. The more veggies the better. We settled on serving saffron risoto and bread - both good choices for the sauce. Easy and a perfect meal on a chilly night.

I have made osso buco may times. Turkey legs are a great economical alternative (in the US anyhow, here veal is cheaper, go figure) to veal osso buco, but this recipe looks like it could be improved a lot. Definately reccommend searing the meat before cooking, and could use some rich veal stock and citrus juice/zest. You can use any osso buco recipe and substitute turkey legs.

This recipe is phenomal! My turkey drumsticks were to big for my crock pot, so I cooked the osso buco in a 375 oven for 2 1/2 hours. One night we ate it with brown rice, the next, over linguine. My husband and I sopped everything up with wonderful bread. I am so glad that there is more to eat for another meal!

Simple and delicious! I cooked it for about 6 hours on high in the crock pot and the meat just fell off the bone. I used a can of italian spiced tomatoes and white wine instead of red, since that's what I had. I'm planning on serving it tonight over brown rice or whole wheat pasta. The nutrition information given seems a little low. I analyzed it at 270 calories and 8 grams of fat per serving, without the olive oil. I browned the turkey in a non-stick pan instead of the veggies, then added everything (including the lemon peel and garlic) to the crock pot. I'll garnish with parsley before serving.
