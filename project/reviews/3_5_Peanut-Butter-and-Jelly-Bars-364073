Excellent and easy! The salt factor is very important... don't get an overly sweet peanut butter like Skippy, instead use Jif. I also added sea salt atop the finished product... all of those things make it peanuttier. Also added roasted peanuts.

Really enjoyed these! I did hold back a bit of the sugar and even some of the jam because I was afraid it would be too sweet. Next time I will go ahead with all of the jam but stick with less sugar. Cooked an additional 8-10 minutes and they came out moist and delicious.

Just great!!!!!! And a hit, I've got to send this recipe off to others since it has been requested.

Absolutely terrific and family friendly. I reviewed this recipe on my own blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins.

Loved these bars! Used Bonne Maman blackberry preserves and it was heavenly, especially the next day. My HS daughter made them (very easy) to take to school and share with friends at lunch but I couldn't stop eating what she left at home.

These are AWESOME. Came out moist and flavorful. I used Cherry preserves and it gives them a little texture and chunk. Nothing more needs to be done to this recipe. These were a hit and am makingmore RIGHT NOW!!!!

Unlike the other reviewers, I had no issues with the dough being dry or crumbly. Make sure you start with all room-temperature ingredients!

I used strawberry preserves and love them. They taste like the ultimate peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

I thought these were excellent and have made them several times. Follow the recipe exactly and they are perfect. Pan size is important as they will come out too thin in a larger pan.

Not so good. My partner, whom LOVES peanut butter, did not go in for a second. The base was quite crumbly and did not have enough of a "peanut butter" flavor. It is just not worth the time or ingredients when there are countless more recipes that one can truly enjoy. :-/

I too found the dough crumbly and powdery... Used grape jelly and followed the recipe to a tee... Was just okay. The upside is that this is a-relatively- healthy dessert/snack for school. Not too much butter or sugar and a nice satisfying peanutbutter taste which goes well with a layer of almost caramelized grape jelly :) Maybe would make again... at this point it's a 7.5/10.

Normally I hate when folks change anything and then review. Having said this, I'm doing just that. I made this "as written", but used almond butter and sliced almonds, due to issues with peanuts. Very easy to make, but I felt like the bottom crust was too thick, and I didn't like the texture very much. Unlike other reviewers, I thought there was too much crust mixture on both bottom and top, and the jam (used apricot with the almond) kind of got lost in the finished product. I won't bother with this again.

These were a big, big hit. I used apricot preserves, because that was what I had at hand. Definitely a keeper, will make again.

Maybe 2-1/2 stars. I've been dying to make these since I received this issue and finally got around to it today. They are just okay. Reduced the sugar amount as another reader suggested, don't think it was necessary. I'm not sure they need more dough on the bottom, but I ended up with extra after crumbling on top. I increased the cooking time by a few minutes, but they still seem kind of dough-y and very crumbly (they fell apart when taking the foil off). Maybe put them in the freezer for a bit before cutting into squares? Hmmmm...

These were really easy to make and delicious. I used almond butter and chopped almonds and plum jam.

Id give it 3 1/2 really. I love peanut butter but I am not a fan of peanut butter & jelly and I couldn't stop eating them. I used half whole wheat flour & half all purpose, and also 1/2 current & 1/2 grape jelly. Really good- rave reviews from who ever tried it. It did need to cook a bit more and you could easily reduce the sugar with out harming the flavor.

I used strawberry jam instead of grape, but otherwise following the instructions exactly. Maybe they would have had more flavor with another type of jam, but as is I thought they were a little bland... Not bad, but not worth making again.

I made just as the recipe was written, except I used Raspberry jam instead of grape. I didn't think the bottom needed more dough, but I would probably add 3-5 more minutes cooking time. Thought the bars were verrrry good.

Went to make these the other day and found that I'd loaned out my 8" x 8" pan, so I made them in a 9" round cake pan instead. More like a PB&J pizza really. But still delicious and satisfying for my PB&J craving. I didn't think the crust was too thin at all, but I did think it was a bit too sweet. I would probably knock the sugar down to 2/3 cup, and I'd use raspberry jam next time instead of grape- a little tart to cut through all the sweet. The salt of the chopped peanuts on top help with that too. I'd definitely make these again.

I made this recipe for an Oscar Party and they were a huge hit. As stated in another review I would use more dough on the bottom and cook for about 35 minutes.

I made this for co-workers and it was a hit. Would put a little more dough in the bottom portion of the bars, more than the scant 1 1/2 cup called for. Delicious!
