Maybe I didn't cook this in the right kind of roasting pan...the onions and grapes made a liquidy, sloppy purple mess which tasted okay but looked kind of unappetizing. the sausages were good but then it's hard to ruin sausages. I was disappointed given the rave reviews this recipe received from others.

I found some amazingly tasty Concord grapes at a local market and had too many for us to eat plain (while they were still good) so decided to try this recipe. I used chicken breasts instead of sausages and baked for 40 minutes. Absolutely delicious, and an incredibly healthful one-pot meal.

I have been enjoying the roast butternut squash with grapes, onions, and sage from this site. The idea of adding sausages to that recipe (or adding cubes of butternut squash to this recipe) sounds intriguing for a one dish meal.

Excellent flavor! I made this exactly as written because I never cooked with grapes in a savory dish before and wasn't sure what (if anything) I should change. Simple, homey, delicious food that makes one think of autumn and look forward to the chilly weather. I will definitely make this again.

great recipe. I often use green grapes (not too sweet that way) and then serve it over polenta or risotto, with side of zucchini/tomatoes sauteed with a bit of pesto.

Wow!!! I love this recipe it is simple and delicious. I made it once with cherries as another reviewer suggested and it was good but what a difference the grapes make. Yummy!!

I live for simple harmonious recipes! Okay, grapes didn't sound that great so I used canned sweet cherries, and good looord!! Was this dish delicious!! I also used 3 sweets and 3 hots made by some sausage lady in Cambridge, who rules my world! Fun stuff!
