Excellent! Didn't have any endive or white-wine vinegar (used rice vinegar instead). Was delicious with a bright fresh flavor.

This was totally awesome. Served at a family party and two people asked for the recipe. One person who doesn't usually eat spinach went back for seconds. I followed recipe exactly except i used Romaine lettuce instead of endive, then added a little more oil and vinegar. You can't go wrong with this one.

Made this last night for friends and every bit went. It was delicious. I used mixed greens with the spinach instead of endive. Also, instead of chopping and toasting the pecans, I used Maple-Glazed pecan halves (which I took from the excellent "Brussel Sprout Slaw with Mustard Dressing and Maple Glazed Pecans" on this site). I made extra pecans and put them out as an appetizer. Yummmm

Really good. I used almonds instead of pecans because I didn't have any pecans. Loved the sweetness of the cranberries with the saltiness of the blue cheese. It's very pretty too. It's hearty enough to be a meal, with some bread.

This is my go-to viniagrette... I've made it at least 10 times now and love it more and more every time. The dressing is light and perfectly flavored, it really elevates the salad ingredients without overpowering. I've made a wide variety of combinations, a couple of my favorites are: 1. Spinach, endive, fresh strawberries, fresh white corn, dried cranberries, toasted pecans 2. Spinach, endive, green apple, green grapes, green celery, green raisins, toasted walnuts Have fun, you really can't go wrong on ingredients... the dressing would go with pretty much anything.

Made this for a large family gathering and everyone loved it. The dressing is delicious. I used Pinot Grigio vinegar and Lucini brand olive oil, which is light and fruity. Used the leftover dressing for several days of delicious salad eating!

Made is for dinner guests based on rave reviews, the first person to take a bite announced "WOW!" to the entire table and I had to laugh as this happened to someone else here. The only thing I changed was i toasted the pecans in a pan with a little butter, brown sugar, and salt. It hasn't even been one week since we first made it, and already we've eaten it 3 times. DELICIOUS!!

I made this salad without the cranberries and endives and pecans but it was delicious nonetheless. I added bacon as well. The dressing has a nice touch of sweetness - if you are not a vinegar fan, I would use a bit less. This is a great, light dinner

This was just delicious, my guests raved about it and asked for the recipe! Recommend toasting pecans with a little butter and sugar. The endive counterbalaces the little bit of sweetness perfectly...

Terrific! Such a simple dressing but so delicious. Got rave reviews from my dinner guests and me. "Don't throw that extra salad away! I'll have it for breakfast tomorrow."

Great dressing... I used 2 heads of butter lettuce instead of endive and spinach and used Gorgonzola as the cheese and sauteed the pecans in butter, brown sugar and salt. Mmmmmmmm

I'll add my voice to the rave reviews of this recipe. I followed everything exactly with the exception of using only spinach - no endive. The first bite of this salad produced a "Wow" response. The dressing, in combination with the cranberries & blue cheese, was perfectly balanced and simply delicious.

Sooo good and so easy! I didn't have blue cheese, so substituted with feta this time. I'll definitely make this recipe again!

This is one of THE best salads ever! It's simple and yummy. I used mesculin greens instead of endive and it was to die for! Definitely a keeper!!

Simple and delicious.Never used endive before, looked alittle brown after slicing it. Is that normal? Only used 1/2 of it but it did look good in the salad.

I made this last night as stated, but substituted goat cheese for the blue. My husband and I both loved it. I intend to pick up some blue and try it again as intended at least once, then make it using orange segments in place of the cranberries. Definitely a keeper.

Excellent! I used my immersion blender and just pureed everything (including the shallot). I through in a garlic clove too. yum!

This salad is delicious...but some changes i made were: used mixed baby lettuce; dried cranberries, cubed brie cheese (or st.andre) and pinenuts. The dressing as written is perfect and the salad is a MAJOR crowd-pleaser.

Simple, flavorful and a great complement to Christmas dinner of rib roast. Made with dried cherries at the suggestion of a prior post.

I usually try to follow the directions precisely when I make a dish the first time. I don't feel it can be judged without trying it in its original form...but...this time I didn't have all of the ingredients so I tried substitutions. I had no spinach so I substituted some shredded iceburg and a handful of field greens and added it to the shredded endive. I didn't have any shallot so I made the dressing without. I also used rice vinegar because I didn't have any white wine vinegar. The dressing still tasted great. I also used dried cherries instead of the cranberries and I chopped a pear and added it to the salad. The salad was fantastic even with the substitutions. Basically I think you could substitute a variety of fruits and greens to make this salad. We will definitely have this again in some form. Bon appetit.
