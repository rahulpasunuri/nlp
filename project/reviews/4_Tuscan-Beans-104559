Simple and worth it. I cooked the beans in the oven in my cast iron pot for just over 3 hours at 300 degrees. The addition of the sea salt at end made the dish.

I was really surprised by this recipe- it's wonderfully simple to make and more flavorful than I expected. We returned from Italy two days ago, the flavor of bean dishes fresh in my mind and I wanted to try it myself. This recipe is also forgiving: I started the beans in a enameled cast iron pot in the oven, and at some point, someone turned the oven off. I turned it back on, revved up the heat for an hour and turned it off to go to bed, figuring it would sit in the oven overnight and be finished in the morning. In the morning, I cooked them for another hour and a half, until soft but not mushy, easy. I wasn't so sure how well they'd go over at dinner, so I tossed two servings with cilantro pesto I had made and served it up to rave reviews, but they were great on their own. In Italy, we had had them served lightly tossed with chunky tomato sauce, and simply with olive oil. I think the beans can also be a fun alternative to pasta for gluten-free eaters, yummy with a bit of pasta sauce. The texture is really satisfying.

This recipe is superb! It is our favorite for any white bean. We use our Piral bean pot and cook it in the oven (we could use the stove top but in the oven its set it and forget it). So generally its done in 2-2-1/2 hours. Great served with an excellent olive oil or with braised lamb shanks.

This was good, but a little bland. Be generous with the seasonings. I think it needs a little something else - some lemon, perhaps?

Peg, I couldn't help but respond to those who believe that terracotta can not be used on a fire or gas flame. Having cooked similar recipes it seems blindfolded that this one is delicious. Throughout the world many have and still do. The wok like pans in Bali are traditionally terracotta, as well as the cazuela frying pans in Spain and the Basque Lands. I've cooked quite a bit myself with them during my years in Provence and Languedoc. Their bean pots were often suspended in the fireplace over a log fire. They of course often used the village bread oven. There are a few secrets for the uninitiated. It could be that terra cotta varies with the clay type and how it is fired, so this might not apply to all. In general,as above mentioned, it would seem that terracotta pots need to be soaked overnight in clean water before their first use. The midi is more humid than the north and it might be that this ritual needs to be repeated when the pot has not been in use for a while. The next rule is that the heat applied should be gradual. Terra cotta is a fairly poor heat conductor on the one hand, but a very good heat retainer none the less. One can fry garlic, onions, and meat. It's used very often by the Basques and Spanish just for this. The last anecdote I recall at the moment is that terra cotta bean pots improve the flavor of their dishes with use.I've never used any longer than a half dozen years myself, so I can't talk from experience, but one older Midi friend recounted that they often turn suddenly sour after the years. No remedy I'm afraid. This, and lead glazes, keeps me personally away from antique store finds. Be rest assured Peg, if your terracotta pot is of good quality, after soaking it overnight, it can be safely used on the stovetop if you heat it up slowly. The Basque expression is to put some olive oil in and wait until the oil 'chatters' before you add what you will.

We made this dish specifically to use our new Piral Bean Pot. It is glazed terracotta, made in Italy and is made to use ON the stovetop. It came out beautifully. Beans were perfect and the taste was true Italy. Great all the way around!

Peg, I'm a potter, and I can tell you to NEVER put anything made of clay over direct heat. It will surely break. Any kind of clay cooker is to be used in the oven. That said, the beans sound great. We just had similar beans tonight, with a side of braised kale dressed with olive oil and balsamic. A very hearty, flavorful, no-meat meal, great for winter.

I want to make this but I'm confused... Do you put the terra cotta pot on the stove top? or in the oven? I hope someone will answer this because the recipe sounds wonderful & I will rate it after I make it. Thank everyone for your input on all the recipes. I love this site!!!!

This dish is a staple in my repetoire. It's so easy. I use a large glazed earthernware casarole to make this in. The head of garlic should be left unpeeled and whole. The other contributors who say this dish is garlicky must be peeling the garlic. So, toss everything in to the cassarole, except the salt and oil, and put it in the oven at about 300 degrees for 3 1/2 hour. Try it with braised lamb shanks Provencal. YUM.

I use this recipe as a quick sidedish using canned northern beans. I add the herbs and garlic and simmer until flavors have infused. Divine with rosemary grilled chicken and other meditterean or provencal foods.

Absolutely divine. I added couple extra springs of sage and a couple of thyme. I used half of head of garlic and wrapped it in a cheese cloth. Everybody was surprised by really flavorful results. The biggest hit at the Tuscan theme party. That's only way to serve beans.

I did not want to buy a special terra-cotta thing to cook these in. Instead I cooked them in a crock pot on high for 9 hours. They were mushy but we like them that way for a change sometimes. Their smell did seem to linger ...

I always make white beans this way, using about 1/2 a head of garlic. The thing about this recipe is bringing the pot up to a simmer very slowly. The beauty of it is that the beans turn out tender but not mushy, and the broth is wonderful for soup if you reduce the salt a little.

This dish is tasty, and very garlicky. I would make it again, but it has some smelly side effects.
