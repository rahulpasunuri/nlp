I made this yesterday for Easter, it was really good! The only thing I didn't like was it seemed a little greasy. I may have added to much cheese (but I love cheese!), next time I will try a little less. This issue was a small one though, everyone love the potatoes!

I doubled this for a potluck supper and added some previous reviewers' suggestions: sauteed onion and garlic and a chopped jalapeno. Also simmered two fresh bay leaves and some fresh thyme with the onion mix. It was wonderful -- cooked in about 1 hour 40 minutes at 350 convection. Had sauce left over (doubled that, too) so will make it again for a foursome dinner in a couple of days. There was not a scrap left in the dish!

This has been a family favorite since it was first published in 1994. They have been perfect every time I make them. My grown daughter wants to serve it for New Year's Eve and needed the recipe. I couldn't find mine and was a bit panicked. So thankful for the recipes being online.

The flavors were great, but as others have reported, the potatoes didn't get cooked. Definitely do NOT use a deep 2 quart dish for this. You need a shallow oblong one. I nuked it for a few minutes and it cooked though, but the breadcrumb topping wasn't crispy anymore after that. If you bake this in the right dish though, it should be wonderful. I used 1 cup Cabot "seriously sharp cheddar" and 1/2 cup Gruyere. I also sauteed a small chopped onion and a minced garlic clove and added that to the cheese sauce.

This recipe has cheese in it, on purpose, so it shouldn't be named scalloped potatoes. But I made it anyway, called it "cheesy potatoes", to no avail. Ugh.

I am here to sing the praises of this recipe which I have been making for the past 4 years or so. I have made no changes to it whatsoever. It is what I am asked to bring to any gathering and the recipe I e-mailed two people by request just today. The chicken broth and extra-sharp cheddar elevate this to favorite status. I made a double batch in a 4L Corningware casserole for a Christmas party and by the time the hostess had served herself ham all the scalloped potatoes were gone due to some having seconds. Do yourself a favor and make one for yourself sometime. We use a mandoline slicer with the wavy blade to slice the potatoes and think it makes the sauce hold on better. BTW, when making a double batch you don't need to double the bread crumbs. 350F on convection for 2 hours for a double batch.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe. It is so easy and my family loves it. The great thing about it is that I have all the ingredients in my pantry. I have even used canned bread crumbs if I don't have time to make them fresh. If making fresh breadcrumbs, it is delicious with sourdough bread. The potatoes taste great the next day as left-overs since the sauces hold up nicely. This recipe will be a longtime favorite in my house!

I made this for Easter and was very happy with them. Based on other reviews I added the following: some pressed garlic in the cheese sauce, added sauted onions in the layers and added some paprika to the cheese sauce. I used 3 yellow potatoes and one russett. Would make again for sure.

Rating: 3
I used thinly sliced russet potatoes, then nuked them in the microwave until they were almost tender. To improve the flavor, I added sauteed garlic and onion to the roux. Also a combination of gruyere and cheddar cheese provided additional flavor, and also a bit of cayenne pepper.

Rating: 4
Amazing flavor. I also added smoked paprika. Wow! Boiling Potatoes are red potatoes and have a fair bit more moisture than russet potatoes and will not taste mealy. If you do not layer the potatoes with the sauce, you will have a much longer bake time.

Rating: 2
I used russet potatoes and they still weren't cooked to tender after almost 2 hours of baking. I'm not sure exactly what "boiling potatoes" are - apparently they aren't russets. Maybe I'll try it again with red potatoes and see if they come out better.

The first time I made this recipe I used the extra-sharp cheddar cheese. I thought it was a little too sharp. The next time I made the recipe I used sharp cheddar and it was much better.

Very bland. I probably should have read other reviews and spiced it up a bit with some garlic. I'll probably search for a different recipe instead of trying to manipulate this one for a second time.

Altho I added garlic powder and thyme to the roux, the overall dish was still lacking. I even added canadian bacon to the middle layer (this was a dish for Oktoberfest)- and still turned out so-so. I'll look for something more flavorful for next year.

Rating: 3
A great recipe to add to my repetoire. I made this on Easter for a group of friends and they're still talking about it. I followed the published recipe and the potatoes were cooked thoroughly. I used red potatoes, and sliced them perhaps a shade thinner then called for. Does anyone out there uses Feemster's Famous Vegetable slicer? It's a small cheap device that works very well on stuff like this.

Rating: 4
This was a resounding hit at Thanksgiving. I'm a little sensitive to flour, so instead of sprinkling bread crumbs on top, I sprinkled another 1/4 cup of cheese. I also added about a teaspoon of thyme and a tablespoon of garlic powder to the sauce as somewhat of an afterthought and I think it was a good addition. I'd use fresh if I'd thought of it earlier. I think that this dish could compliment a lot of other dishes just by tweaking the herbs you add in, though.

Rating: 4
This is a great recipe. However, thanks to the other reviewers I cooked mine at 400 degrees for 1-1/2 hours and it was not overdone. The edges got very brown but tasted caramelized, not burnt. I did not use cream, only home made chicken broth, and it was still very creamy. I used an onion and thanks to a reviewer, the cuisenart--saved a bunch of time. Also 2 dashes of Louisiana hot sauce. Yummy.

Rating: 0
I can't rate this particular recipe because I did change the items around a bit! I did not have any cheddar cheese so what I did do was make up the roux and add gorgonzola cheese, onions and fresh rosemary. I sliced the potatoes thin and cooked them for 1-1/2 hours until they were golden brown on top. They were to die for....my kids passed up on the ham and fought for the potatoes instead. Leftovers were great the next day for lunch. I am sure that the recipe would be good with the cheddar cheese, but I really liked them with the gorgonzola instead. I would give four forks for these potatoes

Rating: 3
Really excellent flavor. My husband and I kept going back for seconds and thirds, something we usually don't do. However, I agree with the last reviewer that you need to cook them longer than the recipe states. Maybe this depends on the depth of your 2 quart dish, so just check them but plan on them taking a little longer.

Rating: 3
This was a very good, fast and easy dish to make. It is low in fat, since there is no milk. The potatoes were not cooked through, however I cooked them a bit longer and the dish turned out very flavorful, (via my daughter). The whole family loved them.

I used half milk/half chicken broth. I also added a clove of garlic and some fresh thyme. It turned out great, (and it would probably be great if you did it the "regular" way as well.)

The unsalted butter and plain bread crumbs made this, well, plain. Will tweak it a bit next time with Ritz crumbs and salted butter.

Y-U-M! This recipe would probably have been great as is but I used yukon gold potatoes, 1/2 broth and 1/2 milk (and a little extra of both), and added a few chopped garlic cloves and a small diced onion to roux. Incredibly rich and delicious--everyone loved it!

Rating: 4
This dish is requested for every family gathering, my husband's or mine. I always use Yukon Gold or Yellow Finn potatoes which hold up really well but do add a little extra baking time. Just a week ago a happy accident caused this dish to be the best I have had yet. Bleary-eyed one early morning I added a can of vegetable broth to the roux instead of chicken broth. I smelled the onion in it immediately and since I had made a double batch next added a can of chicken broth. The combination of the two was the most flavorful version of this I have ever had. Not a potato was left after dinner. If I was to make a single recipe of this I might try even making the sauce with just vegetable broth to see how I like it. I only use 1/2 the bread crumbs. I will modify my rating from 3 forks to 4 with the new improvement.

Rating: 3
Adding a thinly sliced onion is a must for this tasty recipe. Also, consider adding some spices to the roux and melted cheese. A really good quality cheese is vital. I liked it without the bread crumbs.

This was my first attempt at making scalloped potatoes and there were rave reviews. I cooked it at 325deg for 1.5 hours as we were heating a turkey at that temp. The only things I did differently were to use 1/2 C milk and 1 1/2 C of broth, and it was really creamy. Also added some grated parmesan cheese which gave it a real zing! Note the second time I made this I used Yukon gold and it took much longer to cook!

Not very impressed with this recipe. I found it a little bland. I prefer my scalloped potatoes a little creamier. Maybe next time I'll use milk for half of the broth.

This recipe *would* have been good if the potatoes had been cooked all the way through! I was a bit surprised that this did not call for the potatoes to be boiled at all before baking, and I paid the price for it - they were still VERY firm when it was 'done.' I even cooked it a good 15-20 minutes longer than the recipe calls for and they were still not done. Maybe it was the Yukon Golds I used, or maybe I just didn't slice them thin enough, but to be safe I would definitely pre-cook the potatoes next time. A friend who has made many scalloped potato dishes was shocked it didn't call for pre-cooking either...in general, I've had better scalloped potatoes even if this *had* cooked all the way through, so I'll pass on this one.

Rating: 3
This dish turned out very well. It was easy to make (I sliced the potatoes in the food processor). The bread crumbs add a little crunch to the dish. My modifications were that I didn't add salt because of the cheese, I used Pam cooking spray rather than greasing the pan with butter and I cooked the potatoes at 400 degrees (rather than 350) for one hour. They came out perfect!

Rating: 1
I made this recipe for my family Christmas dinner. Due to the number of guests, I doubled the recipe. I felt the dish lacked flavor, as it was cheesy but quite plain. However, I forgot to put the bread crumbs on, so maybe that was the missing ingredient. Also the dish was in the oven for an hour 15 minutes, and it was not done. I should have remained in the oven at least another 20 minutes. I will continue my search for a good scalloped potato recipe, this just didn't meet my expectations.

New Cook. 1st effortless Epi recipe to come out perfect for me. Added sliced onions but not sauteed. Cooked w/other items in stove at 425 for 1.5 hrs, OK, it really boiled the potatoes but the sauce was creamy and the potatoes were soft. My guy, my human sacrifice, thought 'really good' for a beginner.

After decades of using the old 'white sauce' recipe, I tried this. Love it!! Much more flavorful than the old way. I happened to have a can of lo-sodium chicken broth on hand & used that but next time I'll use Herb-Ox chicken bouillon - lo-salt - because I like the herbs. Naturally I 'added' - garlic powder because we love garlic and slices of left over Easter ham. It's one of those recipes that lends itself to your own variations. I agree about the time - 1 1/2 hrs. at least - the first hour covered.

Delicious and here is my "twist": added 1/4 C. low-fat mayo to sauce mix (a little less cheese), and thinly sliced onion to layers. Used crushed low-fat croutons, but left them off at first. I baked at 375, covered, for 1 hr., uncovered, added crushed croutons and baked another 20-30 mins. 'til golden. Done to perfection! KIMBER

These scalloped potatoes are delicious. I agree with the other raters on a few different suggestions: Add the bread crumbs the last 30 min.; need to cook it for at least 90 minutes; add about 1/2-3/4 cup of milk for more creamy potatoes.

This is a really, really yummy scalloped potato recipe. Definitely cook it an extra 15 - 20 minutes. I use a Corningware pan that is fairly shallow. The chicken broth makes it taste great, plus it's not so rich as it would be with milk or cream.

I have made this dish twice now, and got raves both times! As did the other reviewers, I added garlic to the roux, and sauted onions as one of the layers. A friend made this and added chunks of ham...yummy! This dish takes 1.5 hours to cook, if in a shallow dish, longer if in a deep one. Goes great with the Crown Roast of Pork with Apple and Pork Stuffing and Cider Gravy, also at this site. Worth the time and effort!

I have made this recipe several times. To the one reviewer, I use a 9x13-inch glass(Pyrex) baking dish and potatoes are always perfectly cooked. If you must use packaged bread crumbs, melt a little butter and mix in before you put on top. I've found that extra sharp cheese has yielded the best flavor. These potatoes are so easy that they are my potato stand-by! Hubby loves, kids love, guests love. Enjoy!

I haven't made this recipe, so I'm not commenting on it (though it sounds delicious!) but i just wanted to mention a little something about breadcrumbs. The recipe calls for fresh breadcrumbs, which should do fine if put on top at the beginning. If, however, you used packaged (dry) breadcrumbs, they will indeed burn (if you put them on in the beginning), because they don't have enough moisture. Use fresh! They're better! :-)

I ws looking for the perfect scalloped potato recipe. As written this one is not great. I did not cook the potatoes ahead of time so they were undercooked if only in the oven for one hour. Definitely needs longer in the oven or cooked ahead. The flavor was pretty good. I added grilled onions. What pan is everyone using? I used a pie plate. I might try this recipe again only because of the rave reviews this has gotten so far. I'll defintely cook the potatoes ahead.

I first soaked the onions and potatoes for 15 minutes in cold water then boiled them for about ten minutes in the chicken broth. I topped the dish with bread crumbs & paprika.

This is indeed a great scalloped potatoes dish. I went with the other cooks and sauted onions. Use a shallow dish. I used a deep casserole dish and ended up in the oven 2 1/2 hrs. I would hold off on the bread crumbs until the last 30 minutes also. Will definitely fix this again.

Excellent and extremely easy to make! Bu-u-u-t-t... If you're like me and endeavor to keep your stomach in training to be available to enjoy the best that food has to offer... You really need to pump this recipe up a bit. I chopped onion and celery and added it to the goop along with the cheese (a bit more than recipe called for). I also threw in some celery seed along with the salt & pepper and mixed grated cheese and Italian seasoning with the bread crumbs. Had I had leftover chicken, ham, or pork rib... or, been able to locate the neighbor's cat... there would have been some diced meat in the last batch as well. Next time.

Absolutely wonderful, and simple. The cheese sauce is what makes it perfect. Don't worry about the breadcrumbs; I put them on for the entire time and they didn't burn. My wife and I had some extra cubed ham in the fridge, which we added to make it more of a meal. Perfecto!
