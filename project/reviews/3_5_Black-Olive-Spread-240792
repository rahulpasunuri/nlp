My mother made a version of this recipe and it is a HIT!! with us. I think the lemon is a little too tart, so I make my version with lime. Also try adding the zest or the citrus, it really "brightens" up the flavor.

This was a big hit with my family. I used Kalamatas, following the recipe, and served with crackers.
