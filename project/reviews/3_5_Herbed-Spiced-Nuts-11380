I have made this recipe for years...I prefer all pecans.

I have made these over and over again. You really only need 2 teaspoons of oil, not 2 tablespoons.

These were not the end all be all, but they are very fast and easy and do taste better than plain nuts. These would be good as a last minute gift or to serve at a party when you were short on time

My husband loved these and gobbled them up. I thought they were fine but nothing special. I can get really good, spicy nuts right out of the bag at Trader Joe's. I wanted a recipe that had a little spice and a little heat but no sugar added to mess up the low carb profile. This fit the bill.

The most positive thing to say about these nuts is that they are different--one of the few recipes which isn't sweet.

As written, this recipe deserves a 1--blah as anything, with only a flavor of dried herbs in the foreground. Add more cayenne and they get too hot, but still blah at first bite. Still, I salvaged them by tossing them in a pan again with a little more oil and a little brown sugar, and then serving them in a bowl mixed with Craisins. There are better nut recipes out here, folks.

One word: Overrated. Too much oil, not enough spice. Sure they are easy to make and they taste better than plain nuts, but there's a lot of room for improvement.

I can't believe how easy and delicious these nuts are! Would definitely make again, and take as hostess gifs

I absolutely loved these nuts - I made them for New Year's and will again for the Super Bowl. So easy - and so delicious. The pecans come out the best.

Very easy and very tasty. I made several batches of these to give as gifts and to serve over the holiday season and they were a really big crowd pleaser. Also, if you are a member of Costco, you can get really big bags of pecans, walnuts, and almonds at a very good price making this a very economical recipe to prepare as hostess gifts or part of a gift basket/package.

This recipe is fabulous. I made it for some friends and they all loved it. The best part is that it was so easy. I am planning to make gift baskets for Christmas this year and I will definitely be including some Herbed Spiced Nuts in every basket.

I made a batch for holiday presents which were well received. Everyone loves the flavor! I have a batch in the oven right now, as I am taking them as a hostess gift tonight.
