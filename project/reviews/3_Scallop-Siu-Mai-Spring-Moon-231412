I substitutued the 8oz scallops with ground turkey, but followed the recipe otherwise. These little dumplings were adorable, presented beautifully and tasted great. Serve with chilli-garlic sauce and oyster sauce.

This is an excellent version of the classic Siu Mai. The balance of flavors is 'just right'. Wonderful for casual occasions where finger foods are the main attraction. Make ahead by all means.
