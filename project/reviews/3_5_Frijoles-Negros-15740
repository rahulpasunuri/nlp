This was delicious! My husband doesn't like black beans and loved this. I made a slight variation to sub canned beans for the dried (sliced up the raw bacon, cooked until crispy; added onion and green beans - sautéed until tender; added the rest of the ingredients - simmered for 15 min). So easy! Will definitely be making this again.

Great recipe! I wish folks would use this as a forum to make actual recipe comments instead of gripes about the search feature. Don't comment on a recipe that you have not tried! Bacon RULES!

While it is odd that a disdh with bacon would show up in a 'meatless' section, omitting the bacon is no big deal and the dish is stil yum-a-lishious. BTW to the poster w/ veggia friends who were okay whitht the bacon fat..isn't that kinda like Ghandi saying the Atom Bomb was a good idea...

These beans would be vegetarian if you just omit the bacon fat !! How simple is that !

Black beans are God's gift to Earth-vegetarian or not. You may omit the bacon, substituting garlic cloves or something else for more flavor. It has been a staple in my home's kitchen.

If it's not vegetarian it shouldn't show up in a "meatless" search.

No one said it was vegetarian. It sure was flavorful and a big hit even with my vegetarian friends. Yes, they were told about the one tablespoon of bacon fat.
