I love this recipe. I hardly ever get egg drop soup when eating Chinese. It's gluey and weird tasting. This recipe however is fresh and light and a great, easy first course. I add extra ginger and garlic and don't strain it out. Along with the sesame oil and scallion, the extra ginger really brightens up the taste.

This an amazing soup that will be enjoyed by anyone. I used all ingredients except for the Sherry, and it is a true hit at my house, and has been for 2 years.

This was quick, easy and delicious. I used 3 fat cloves of garlic and a little more ginger. I grated half of the garlic and the ginger into the chicken broth, and sliced the rest and then removed it as the directions indicated. Also used 2 packages of ramen noodles broken up and 3 eggs since we like more noodle and egg than broth. A winner with my husband as well.

Yummy! Healthy! Fast! Easy! I don't add noodles but I do add baby bok choy and bean sprouts for a serving of veggies and it adds just as much sustenance as the noodles. I also use rice wine vinegar in place of the sherry. Quite good for the minimal amount of prep.

FANTASTIC! I don't know why anyone would want to strain out the garlic or the ginger!!! If you slice/dice them thin enough, there is no need to get rid of them! Such added flavor...yummy! I agree with another reviewer that adding tofu and peas adds heartiness to the dish. And with a few drops of Sriracha....Manna!

Brilliant recipe. I didn't have fresh garlic or ginger so I substituted minced garlic and ground ginger. I add a few more noodles for a heartier dish. Turned out delicious. My 3 year old LOVED it!

good recipe, but i ran out of some stuff in my pantry, so didn't use ginger, green onion and the sesame oil. I used lemongrass instead and cilantro in place of the ginger and green onion. This dish became more south east asian than chinese :) with the 3 replacements

Made without the noodles. Opted for 4c broth + 1/2c water. Subbed a splash of white wine for Sherry as that was all I had on hand. Really nice results! I personally would only use 1/2 - 3/4 tsp sesame oil to finish, but I'm happy with how much this tasted like my go-to take out order.

Didn't have noodles, so left them out. Overall taste was not appealing. Maybe it would have been better without the 1 tsp. sesame oil at the end.

I made this soup last night because the weather was a little chilly here in NY. I must say it came out exceptional. I didn't have sherry so I substituted with vermouth and I also added to my own serving of soup (3 of us were eating it) some Sriracha hot sauce which gave it a nice kick and added to the overall flavor

Rating: 4
Fantastic. Very flavorful...as good as restaurant quality if not better. I didn't use egg noodles and voted for the 4 C. broth, came out fine. Next time I'm going to try adding small diced pieces of tofu :) Would recommend putting sliced ginger and garlic in a tea strainer so you don't have to fish the little bits floating around...unless you want to keep some of them in there for flavor.

Delicious! Actually better than traditional egg drop soup. I love the ginger and garlic addition. I let boil for a longer time to get a deeper flavor. I also replaced sherry with plum wine. I did not add scallions or sesame oil - not necessary. This is my new go to soup recipe.

Love this recipe! The flavor is wonderful; it's fast, easy and good for a week night meal with dumplings or a stir fry. I've changed the vegetables to what I have available. Next time, I will be mixing a little cornstarch with some water and adding to the broth before I add the eggs. It should congele the soup to make it perfect.

Very easy and tasty. I added a few sliced shitake mushrooms and a handful of peas for added color and flavor.

Am making stir fry later this week and wanted soup to go with. Thought I'd do a trial run. Told hubby was making egg drop soup. He is finicky because he eats at restaurants every day for lunch. Made it and asked if he liked it. He said it was Fab!!! I plan on making this each week. Only changes I added a bit of thin sliced celery. Chpd the garlic and left it in. Cornstarch slurry first then eggs. Used plastic bag put eggs in and cut a small whole off the tip. Worked great.

Gosh. SO yummy! I used more noodles so added an extra 1-2 cups of stock. Didn't have time so I just chucked the garlic and ginger in like that and boiled for a few mins. Also because of the amount of noodles and less water in proportion to the recipe, the scrambled egg didn't come out as ribbons per se but I don't care. It tastes lovely and comforting. It'll be a staple! Yay!

I needed something quick and easy to go with some egg rolls I had in the freezer from one of the "meal" assembly places! This fit the bill. No fresh ginger on had so just increased the garlic a bit and left out the noodles (enough carb from the wontons in the egg rolls. It hit the spot on a cold winter's night. The Sherry and the sesame oil add great flavor to canned canned chicken broth.

I found myself sick today with no chicken noodle soup in the house. Not feeling I had the stomach for anything else I went on the search for egg drop soup and found this. Not having tons of energy I put some leftover chicken stock in a pot, splooshed in some soy sauce, grated in ginger, pressed in garlic, tossed in finely chopped carrot and sliced scallions, and added a titch of salt after tasting and let it simmer for a while adding one beaten egg just at the end. I omitted the noodles and forgot the sesame oil in my fever. It was quick, really yummy and hit the spot.

I made this last night to go with Chinese barbecued pork and Szechuan sesame noodles from this site.. This soup was just too good, in fact, the best egg drop soup I have made. I didn't add the noodles because I was making the sesame noodles. Will make again for sure.

This was a good dish, and really easy to make. The eggs gave me a bit of trouble, so be prepared. I added egg noodles. Be careful, don't add more than the recipe calls for, or you will have a pasta alla cabonara kind of dish. No joke! My family enjoyed it, and kids like it too. We left the garlic in until we added the noodles, but we took the ginger out. Adding cornstarch helps thicken it up a little. If you want a more substantial dish, you can saute some chicken (one breast is good)in toasted sesame oil, and shred it. Add it when you add the scallions. Beware! If you don't like salt, use low (or no) sodium soy sauce. I used it, and it cuts back on the salt by a lot. It's good to have a bottle of soy sauce to pass around and shake a few drops into your portion. This is really good with home made dumplings (not in the soup, but as a side). Dumplings are easy to make and delicious, but reserve 2 hours to make them, because the dough must rise for 1 hour. This was a good meal, and satisfing to make because it is as good as take out.

This was DELISH! I didn't put in the noodles cuz so many reviewers were freaked out about them, however, it probably wouldn't have been a bad thing - if I had them, I would have tossed in some bamboo shoots. Oh, and I'm a salt LOVER and this most definitely did not need to be any saltier.

This recipe is awesome, I have made it at least once a week since finding it. I dont always have fresh ginger on hand so a tsp. of ground dry ginger works very well. Also I let the broth simmer awhile for the flavors to blend, then strain the broth to get out the garlic pieces. Then add the eggs. You have to try this at least once, you too will be hooked.

Rating: 4
Authentic tasting and looking. I added a pinch of pepper and a tsp of low sodium tamari to the broth and used much less sesame oil. Also, a picnic squirt bottle works great for streaming in the eggs. Adding a cornstarch slurry is a must to get the texture right. And why in the world are there noodles in the recipe?

Loved this! Followed all the directions, was so easy to make. Followed the suggestion to let the egg set for just a couple seconds before stirring. Served this with some lettuce wraps from a copycat recipe site (recipelink.com).

I thought this was really good. I, too, skipped the noodles but added brocolli floretts to the soup while it was boiling - delicious! My egg ribbons were fine - I used a small pastry tube thing and they did come out in steady thin ribbon. DO NOT STIR once you add the egg - just let it cook for a minute or so. I also added three eggs instead of two - it could have used one more even. I also added a bit more soy sauce. I fished out the ginger but left the garlic. Overall this was very tasty and I will make it again.

This soup was great. Very much like the takeout I was craving with a few changes. I added two scallions cut in 1 inch pieces with the garlic and ginger. After bringing to a boil, I let it steep a few minutes to add flavor and then retrieved all the veg. I thickened with cornstarch before I added the eggs, as one reviewer suggested. It gave the eggs the right ribbony texture. If not thickened before added, the eggs puff when cooking instead of cooking to ribbons. I did use six eggs for this amout of broth. Left out those crazy noodles! Served with crispy noodles. Was so quick and easy. My daughter and I enjoyed it. Will be making this often. To the cook from Texas--Don't stir the eggs. Follow the directions. Stir the broth before you add the eggs and let cook undisturbed.

Nice and easy recipe. I did think it needed a little "zing" so I added a few Tb. of rice vinegar. This added just the right touch

I must've screwed up somewhere in the directions, though I don't know where (I added a small amount of cornstarch to thicken...?) Though it ended up tasting quite nice, the texture was horrible as it turned into this overly thick, eggdrop-less concoction. I'm guessing you should not stir very fast - the eggs cooked uniformly throughout the entire soup instead of in "clumps" like you find at restaurants...

First time ever making egg drop soup and it came out very well. I added noodles and they were yummy. My broth was a little bland so next time I'll add a little more spice. I also added a little more wine then what was called for. I will definatel make it again and use different veggies and spices.

no noodles, matchstick daikon and carrot instead. also thickened broth slightly with cornstarch. I use a small squeeze bottle to make the eggs into uniform strands, much nicer. (beauty supply store)

My 3 year old LOVES the chinese egg drop soup from the chinese food take out place. I decided to make this recipe for her as a quickie lunch served with a rice casserole using the ingrediants I had on hand. I omitted the sherry, sesame oil, and egg noodles since I didn't have any, and used one teaspoon ground ginger and used vegetable broth instead of chicken. I also added corn starch. IT WAS EXCELLENT! Next time I think I'll make my own veggie broth and keep the veggies in there. This soup is going on my rotation for when I serve rice. Make sure you DO add eggs slowly otherwise you get bigger pieces.

This is an easy way to make this soup, although, for very authentic chinese taste use canned chicken broth found in Asian stores and omit the ginger. For the reviewer from Highland Lakes, N.J. use chinese soup noodles called Amoy (sold in Asian stores), these noodles are very fine and they will give the soup a slimy, stachy texture you're looking for. Soak the noodles in boiling water for a minute, drain and add them to the simmering soup broth.

very easy and fun to make. i substituted chardonay for the sherry and it lent it a less agressive taste. i found the noodles to be extraneous when made as a starter dish but not when made as a main dish in which case it was just enough to make it filling.

I added some chicken breast. My children loved it for dinner. Good flavor, the ginger, garlic, soy sauce and sherry really perk up canned chicken broth.
