This was awful. Don't wast your time or ingredients.

I'm not sure why previous reviewers are disappointed with this recipe. I think it makes a great light salad dressing. I did use two cloves of garlic since I love garlic. I also recommend using an electric mixer to whisk as the honey would remain clumped up if you tried to whisk by hand

Wanted a somewhat tangy dressing for a fruit salad so decided to try this one, but took heed of the previous review. Yes, this dressing needed to be sweeter so I upped the honey to 2 Tbsp. and used milk rather than water, but did not increase the salt. It was OK but nothing special and likely will not make it again.

What is this recipe doing on this website? Saved (barely) by adding salt and sugar.
