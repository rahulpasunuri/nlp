Delicious! Note, review is for pears only. They were very easy to make but you need to start a day ahead. I used a good quality pinot noir. The reduction is crucial. I also added a bit of cinnamon and a bit of cardamom. Came out grate and got rave reviews from my guests. I served with vanilla ice cream and pizzelle cookies.

This recipe is fabulous! I made just the pears and served them with a scoop of pumpkin ice cream, as suggested by a previous reviewer. A beautiful presentation and the wine syrup reduction is killer. This will be my go-to dessert for the holidays.

This was absolutely delicious. Instead of the pastries, I served with toasted pine nuts & walnuts and pumpkin ice cream - the sauce mixed beautifully with the pumpkin flavor. These were a big hit, plates were practically licked dry.

Made the pears for a Christmas dessert and they were spectacular -- they come out a deep, dark red and the sauce is a thick glaze. The leftover sauce is delicious on vanilla ice cream and stays good for weeks. I used a cabernet sauvignon and left out the anisette and used a bit of vanilla extract instead of a vanilla bean. I also added some additional spices -- a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg. Don't skip the lemon peel, though. I didn't make the pastries, so no comment on those.
