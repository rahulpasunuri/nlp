We marinaded the meat for about an hour and the sauce was a hit...no leftovers!

This dish is VERY tasty. I made it for the second time tonight with very few changes to the original recipe. I marinated the beef for a half hour or so...would have been more but we were too hungry to wait any longer. The glaze is very potent so I didn't baste as much while it was cooking. This allowed the flavor of the beef itself to come through without being overwhelmed by the orange. I also skewered the onions to be grilled with everything else instead of adding them later. I served the extra sauce at the table, but no one ate it because the meat was so flavorful. It's definitely orange-y, but that's why we like it. I'll definitely be making this one again!!

It was tasty and tender, although the delicious flavour of the tenderloin itself is a little lost here. Might try again with a sirloin cut...might not.

We really liked the flavor of the marinade. Will probably use for ribeye.

It was good- a little sweet.

My husband and I really liked this recipe. The glaze is fantastic. We marinated the meat for about 1 hour and the flavor really came through as did the orange slice. I added squares of red and green peppers and onion wedges to the kebabs and served it with long grain and wild rice. Very simple and quick.

I usually don't like orange glaze, but this was an exceptional recipe. I made the glaze according to the recipe, but when I was seasoning it to taste, I added a good amount of coursely ground black pepper and about a teaspoon of crushed red pepper to give it additional kick, which worked out well. I also used a flat iron steak instead of the tenderloin. My significant other thought she was eating tenderloing kebabs :-) The flat iron steak kebabs took 8 minutes to reach medium-rare.

Oranges overwhelmed the recipe and seemed a bitter contrast to the other flavors. Maybe it was the orange, but I'll try some other recipes before I do this one again.

A great recipe. I used sirloin and skewered the beef along with onions and red peppers. Served the kabobs with steamed basmati tossed with chopped cilantro and green onions. Next time will add a little chopped ginger to the marinade.

I marinated the meat over night and it was stellar! In addition to the oranges I added spears of raw broccoli and they absorbed the juices from the meat and oranges. This was delicious!

Reduced the chili powder by half (only 1tbsp) and it was enough. Next time I'd also let it marinate longer. Used chuck for the beef. I'm usually not a grilled fruit person, but loved the oranges. Served with Carrot Orzo, also on this site. Great meal.

Wonderfully tasty and easy. I've also tried the recipe with less expensive cuts of beef (i.e. sirloin) and have had good results.

Great recipe. I used the amount of Hoisin sauce called for and only added a bit of salt to compensate for the salty Hoisin. We enjoyed the oranges too.

Super quick and worth doing. Since I love lots of orange flavor, I chose to add sauce to meat cubes several hours in advance and it worked well.I was careful adding hoisin sauce and I didn't add the full amount, as the kind I used was very salty and I was nervous I'd over- season such good quality meat. I used half the quantity of hoisin called for - it was enough. I would use garlic-chili sauce next time instead of the chili powder, as the dry chili powder in an uncooked sauce isn't the best ingredient in my view. I served this with the Linguini with carrot ribbons.Simple and memorable for a group of friends.
