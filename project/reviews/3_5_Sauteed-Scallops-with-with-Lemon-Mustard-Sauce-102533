Loved the recipe. I doubled it for company - and they loved it! The best scallops ever!! I used 2 lbs. of sea scallops for 4 people and their was no left overs.

Super easy and delicious. Get the dry scallops if you can find them. So hard to get the wet packed scallops to saute and brown properly. The sauce is fantastic. It bordered on too much mustard, but what I used was very pungent. I likely will cut that back by a third next time. The sauce would be good on other fish as well.

Good and easy-definitely use good quality Dijon or more for flavor

Lovely, quick recipe, especially for beginners. We often use it as an appetizer and serve it over fresh spinach sauteed in olive oil, garlic and a squeeze of lemon. We like to plate it with the sauce to the side (it's thick enough) so individuals can choose how much to use. Fun recipe to adapt for personal taste preferences.

As a novice,this simple-to-create dish was a winner. I served it over browned basmati rice with chopped asparagas and crumbled bacon.

I was looking for a quick easy sauce for scallops and fish, as I can't eat fish, this sauce was great over both! I sauteed a piece of atlantic char for my husband,and he thought the sauce was also very good. My pan was a little too hot so the sauce thickened very quickly, but was great anyway. I used the grainy dijon for a little different twist.

I loved it! I did not have dijon in the house, so I substituted w/Honey. Not a bad substitute at all. Finally, a new simple way to flavor up scallops. Love it!

excellent. it was easy and a huge hit. i served it over a salad of bibb lettuce, sliced radish and cubed avacados. my husband was mopping the sauce w/ his bread!

This is a huge hit in my house, now in our regular rotation. The sea scallops are nice, but this turns out just as good with frozen bay scallops, a freezer staple in my house making this a quick and easy weekday meal sure to please all.

This was a real hit at the beach with fresh sea scallops. The sauce is to die for. When I can't get good scallops I use skinless boneless chicken breasts for a nice change.

Rating: 3
Awesome dish. I had it with mashed potatoes and lemon spinach, which worked really well together. I just wish I had made more of the sauce... I cut the recipe in quarters, and next time I think I'll just make all the sauce. I also found that undercooking the scallops a little made them perfect by plating time.

Rating: 4
This dish was outstanding! Some of the best scallops, I have ever eaten. I made the dish to recipe except for replacing the water with dry white wine and adding the scallops back into the sauce for one minute prior to serving. Again, an outstanding recipe- so simple but so good. A real keeper!

Very simple, very delicious. Follow-ed the recipe exactly.

I had such high hopes for this dish based on the excellent rating but boy did this taste horrible. I know where I went wrong was by adding the amount of lemon the recipe called for since the dish came out much too tart and lemony. I also made the mistake of tripling the sauce so that I would have enough for serving over pasta. I think this would work better with the rice or potatoes as recommended. My bf did not like the tartness of the lemon either. If you make this, make sure you add lemon slowly and taste afterwards. If you love a butter intensive dish, then this dish is for you.

I have made this dish so many times that I can probably prepare it with my eyes closed... I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe.

I've made at least 1/2 dozen Epicurious new recipes in the last couple of weeks, but none that were worth making again - until this one. So easy, and SO GOOD! My only regret is not making more sauce, and not making more (I underestimated how much my family would eat). My 9-year old son told me that next time I should make 1 pound of scallops per person since he plans on eating a pound of scallops. I'm looking forward to trying some of the other reviews suggestions next time.

YUM!!! Sea Scallops, butter, wine, lemon juice, Dijon, cream, shallots....what's not to like? Thanks to the reviewers before me, I, too, made some changes. I made the sauce first....sauteed chopped shallots in butter & olive oil, then added lemon juice, Dijon mustard, & heavy cream...boiled it all until thickened. I sauteed the scallops in butter, set them aside, and deglazed the pan with Chardonnay....reduced that mixture down, and added it to the cream sauce. I tossed half of it with linguini, plated it, and topped with the scallops, the rest of the sauce, and sprinkled with freshly chopped parsley. This is definitely a repeat and a winner!

I didn't have enough scallops so I put in some Chilean sea bass. I added shallots, red pepper flakes, and chicken broth instead of water as the other cook suggested. It was delicious! Will definitely make it again. Thanks.

I use "DRY" SCALLOPS that I purchase from a seafood store. They make all the difference in the world. I tried it with regular sea scallops and it didn't compare. My husband begs me to make this over and over. we love it!

I made this recipe with the shallots and red pepper flakes that one of the other cooks suggested. I didn't use Champagne or clam juice, but added a small amount of white wine vinegar and chicken broth and used H&H to finish the sauce. It was very good!

Rating: 4
This is one of my family's favorite recipes. My 27 year old son even made it for his night to cook at the beach. His girlfriend says its the best dish she has ever eaten. I only change it by adding more dijon mustard to the sauce and I serve it over baked cheese grits. It is decadent so try to only have it for special occasions! Keyword: Try

Rating: 4
My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this dish! We will definitely make it again; however, with one small change. Instead of rolling the scallops in flour, we'd just lightly sprinkle flour on each scallop.

Rating: 3
I made the sauce FIRST by sauteeing shallots with a pinch of red chile flakes until almost golden then added lemon, mustard and left over Champagne and about 1/2 C clam broth and reduced it for about 10 mins. Seared the scallps in a non-stick skillet and set aside to finish sauce by adding cream and scallop "juice" from resting scallops. Served over fresh egg fetticine. Have to wash an extra skillet but worth it. Easy company meal in hot weather.

I made this dish with bay scallops (not a big sea scallops fan) and added the shallots (see review below) and used vermouth instead of water. Cook the bay scallops for a SHORT period of time - literally only 30 sec to a minute per side - or they'll get rubbery. DELICIOUS. Terrific weekday dinner!

I made this dish exactly the way it is writen and loved it! Doubled the sauce and served it over rice. Will make this again soon!

I thought this was a nice recipe although I made a few modifications. After removing the scallops from the pan I melted the butter and added some shallots and cooked until translucent. Then added the lemon, white wine instead of water, mustard, reduced and about 30 sec before finishing added some chopped fresh tarragon. To finish it off I whisked in some heavy cream, which cut the lemon and made it more of a sauce and not just melted butter. Served over tarragon mashed potatoes. Good weeknight meal!

I served this over wilted spinach over thin linguini and tripled the sauce. My wife thought it was great and so did I. I will definitely make this again. It has minimal ingredients, was easy to prepare and delicious.

I can't say enough about this recipe--it's simple and delicious. I made it 3 times already and have received great reviews all 3 times. I agree about subbing the water with white wine (intensifies the flavor). I also added a spicy dijon mustard. Fabulous!

We found this recipe inedible. It was too bitter and lemony and would not make it again. My husband wouldn't even feed it to the dog.

I used wine instead of water and added 1/4 cup chopped shallots to the sauce. Double or triple it for sure. I served it over baby spinach with sauted red pepper and zucchini and mashed potatoes dressed with truffle oil. The 2 jaded gay guys that ate it said it was the best thing they had ever had.

Rating: 3
This is an excellent easy dish that takes no time to make. I substituted the wine for the water as well as the previous reviewers. I agree, one must double the sauce, since there is not nearly enough in the recipe as written. I did not mind the lemon flavor at all and I served with rice. Definite keeper!

Rating: 2
My wife would rate this recipe a 3, but then she is a lover of strong lemon flavour. I prefer a subtler lemon taste and think that one tablespoon of lemon juice with a chicken or mild fish stock substituted for the water would bring this to a 3 for me. I'll try this again for sure!

Rating: 3
Absolutely follow the advice of the cooks below: double or triple the sauce (cut bak on the butter a bit, add a little more mustard), use wine or stock instead of water, serve with mashed potatoes (roasted garlic mashed if you can) and something green, such as the broccoli recommended below, and you will have a meal as nice as the one I served my very happy guests today.

Easy, fast, and delicious. I doubled the sauce; next time I might even triple it (it's yummy!). I also used white wine instead of water, which added flavor. I served with mashed potatoes, but next time I think I'll serve over rice. Will make again.

This recipe is so easy to prepare and it is so flavorful. Next time I will double the sauce recipe,just to have a little extra. I served the scallops over mashed potatoes and brocolli,both complemented the main dish. I also think that rice would have been a good side dish.

So quick and simple yet delicious! Next time I will use a little less butter and more mustard and lemon. I served this with rice which was good. I will try vegetables next time.

Excellent recipe. Easy and delicious. Used chicken broth instead of water and doubled the sauce as suggested by other cooks. You really can't go wrong with this one. Look forward to making it again - next time for company as it is so easy yet somehow elegant. Be sure to serve with something green!

A great, quick recipe! I, too, used white wine instead of water - and used the 'full' sauce recipe with half a pound of scallops, reducing it a little more. On top of a piece of garlic toast, it was delicious.

This is 'casual company' quality. Easy, very quickly made and delicious. Based on earlier reviews I made a few modifications to the original recipe - with very good results! I doubled the butter, lemon juice, water and mustard and also added 1/2 cup of white wine and 1 cup of light cream. The reduction time was about 10 minutes. I kept the cooked scallops covered in foil in a warm oven,then when the sauce was thick enough to cover the back of a spoon I added the collected scallop juice from the warm platter. The scallops were served over angel hair pasta with a side of green beans and garlic bread. It was great. Oh, and I found that high heat was too high on my electric range - I had to reduce the temp to med. high to prevent scorching of the scallops.

This was not quite the sensation I was expecting, given all the great reviews, except for the one cook, who may have had rancid butter. I found this to be okay, but the lemon was a bit overpowering. Also, I served it over mashed potatoes, as suggested, but found that to be a less than inspired combination. I might make it again and put it over linguine.

This has become a regular at our house. I agree more sauce makes it better. Yummmmm.

I'm not sure why anyone wouldn't enjoy this recipe. It's wonderfully simple yet flavorful. I use chicken stock and a little white wine instead of water, which provides complexity; the result requires a few minutes of reduction time to thicken the sauce. Serve over linguine and use plenty of Parmigiano-Reggiano. If you can get your hands on Meyer lemons, use them; they improve the flavor immensely. I've also tried this sauce with chicken breasts, and it's also a winner.

I made half a pound of scallops but used the whole recipe for the sauce. It was delicious! I am not a huge scallop fan, but I loved this, and it was easy enough to make alongside other dishes. I served it with sage/garlic mashed potatoes (from this site), soft-shelled crabs (from Whitey Schmidt's "Crabbiest Cookbook") and corn on the cob. Wow! Definitely a do-over!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was exquisite. There was just enough sauce to add a little contrast and yet not overpower the delicate flavor of the scallops. Adding anything else would be gilding the lily.

Like sole meuniere, but with scallops instead, plus mustard, which gives the sauce more body and taste. Thanks to the reader who suggested preparing the lemon juice, etc. in advance so the scallops didn't have to wait. I am eager to try this with other fish. Adding bacon and cream turns this into something completely different.

I did what Lucia from MA did and I second her opinion. It was truly a hit with my family and so e-z to make. I think the addition of the bacon, wine and cream added just the right punch. And the capellini which I served it over was great for sopping up the extra sauce.

Rating: 2
Rather than doubling the sauce as some reviewers suggested, I made half again as much sauce for 1 lb. of (bay)scallops. That was just the right amount for two of us. Wow, was it ever lemony, and I love lemon! Lemons do vary in tartness, so I would suggest adding lemon juice in judicious quantities. I needed to add 2 tablespoons more butter to cut the acidity. The dish was okay, actually pretty tasty, but I think the suggestions from A Cook on Long Island, 4/9/00, would greatly improve the existing recipe.

Made this last night, and was not that impressed. I doubled the sauce, based on the other reviews, but ended up with much more than necessary. I would consider making this again, but would definitely cut down on the amount of butter, and would stick to the proportions in the recipe. I used a dry rub on the scallops,so maybe that's why we didn't feel the sauce added much to it. The scallops had so much flavor already!

ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL! made the full sauce recipe for a half pound of sea scallops, and as someone who likes to change recipes, I would not change another thing. Served over spinach noodles. Also had the ingredients for the sauce mixed together before the scallops hit the pan, so there was no delay when the scallops were cooked. SOOOO glad my husband doesn't like scallops!

Great-I used Peconic Bay scallops-did not flour or use bread crumbs-doubled the sauce as recommended -added crumbled bacon-1/2 cup chardonnay-1 cup cream-served in large scallop shells. They looked and tasted terrific. Served the remaining chardonnay with the scallops and that didn't hurt the appeal.

Excellent flavor and easy too! I also used 1/2# of scallops with the full sauce recipe. I can't imaging any less sauce. I served this with a white and wild rice blend and Arugula, Pear & Stilton Salad BA 3/99. Good, light menu. I can't imagine ruining it with additional heavy ingredients.

Very Good, I added a few of my own touches to the original. Bacon, 3 strips chopped, right before the scallops. Also added 1/2 glass white wine and about 1 cup cream, and handfull of parmesean cheese. Thickened up nicely-served over lemon pepper flavored linguini. Yum, will do again!

Delicious! Served over Yukon Gold mashed potatoes and it was a fast and wonderful dinner. We only had a 1/2 lb of scallops and made the sauce recipe as stated for 1 lb. It was perfect for 2 people. When I make it again, if I'm using the 1 lb of scallops, I'll double the sauce ingrediants. This one will get encores in our house!
