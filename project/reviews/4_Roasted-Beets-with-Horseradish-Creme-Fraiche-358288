We did not make the horseradish creme fraiche, but the beets and the vinaigrette were delicious. I look forward to trying the recipe with the horseradish creme fraiche.

This recipe was written in the "Sunday Suppers at Lucques" cookbook to accompany a delicious-sounding sauteed halibut recipe, although the beet recipe would probably also be great on its own. In the entire recipe, the horseradish cream sauce gets drizzled over the halibut at the end. The halibut part of the recipe is here: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Sauteed-Halibut-with-Arugula-Roasted-Beets-and-Horseradish-Creme-Fraiche-358351

Did anyone else pick up on the fact that the directions do not clearly state what to do with the creme fraiche/horseradish mix?? I am only assuming to drizzle over the beets after the vinegar dressing....

Very delicious and refreshing! substituted sour cream for creme fraiche as grocery store did not have in stock, came out very good nonetheless. Do plan on making it again using creme fraiche next time to compare flavors.

It took so much longer to roast the beets than stated. And I had very small beets!

So delicious - so simple. Made a couple small changes to suit personal taste. Omitted the sliced shallots (but kept the diced!) and only used about 3/4 of the olive oil called for in the vinaigrette and added a splash more of the balsamic. Turned out beautiful!

Made as written, except used scallions instead of shallots. Fabulous!
