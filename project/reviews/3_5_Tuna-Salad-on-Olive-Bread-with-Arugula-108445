Truly a wonderful tuna salad. I made a few alterations, simply because I didn't have a few of the ingredients on hand... and it still turned out great! I omitted the tarragon and dijon mustard because I didn't have any on hand. I didn't have olive bread either, and used instead a fresh deli-style roll. The fresh dill and capers created such a great flavor. The crunch of the cucumber and green onion is a great companion to the texture of the tuna. Can't wait to make again!

I like another reviewer's suggestion to add celery and eggs, even though they would probably not be used in true Mediterranean versions. I used 1/3 as much dried dill and also chunk tuna with success for an everyday rendition. Do not omit the dill or the capers. I used 2 T. mayo for half the recipe. This recipe reminds me of another from a Memphis paper that I lost. I'm glad to discover it. Thanks.

Fantastic! I made this tuna salad for a christening... it was absolutely lovely, the flavours mix perfectly, and everyone asked for the recipe! The fresh dill and tarragon are a brilliant combination.

Terrific. even better after having sit for a while. Was great with the dill, capers and tarragon.

It was great the way I prepared it: Use fresh cooked, flaked tuna. Leave out the dill, add seeded mustard, and top with roasted shallots. The tarragon was great with tuna.

I'm not a big fan of this recipe, but my mother LOVED it so I gave it three forks. The mix of flavors just didn't appeal to me. I made it without the tarragon, used mixed baby greens instead of arugula, and stone-ground whole wheat pumpernickel bread.

I added some celery, and two chopped hard-boiled eggs. Didn't have cukes on hand this time, but will try them next time. Great herb taste!

LOVE this salad. 1/4 c mayo was just right, added 1/2 tsp of stone ground mustard, added extra capers (which is what make the dish). Perfect blend of ingredients with touch of fruitiness. Grilled 1/2" thick slices of garlic peppercorn bread. Yum!

Relatively easy to make with nice combination of flavor. I found there was a bit too much mayo, so I omitted some of it. Definetely worth a try!

Absolutely delicious. I even substituted low fat mayo and it was still great. Fresh dill and tarragon are a must!

This is really delicious. I didn't have fresh tarragon so I used 2 tsp. of dry. I avoid excess carbs so I served it on a bed of arugula and other greens. Excellent!
