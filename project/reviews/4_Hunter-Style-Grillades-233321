wow, this was good. it's even better the next day (i'm having some as a snack while i peruse epicurious). it's a bit salty for my taste so the next time i make it i will not add salt to the flour or to the mixture as it cooks. i think the saltiness of the beef broth should be enough. i followed the recipe except for using beef only and using dried herbs instead of fresh.

Really nice cacciatore beef dish. Served with mashers everyone loved. Will definitely make again.

First post ever yet have over 300 recipes saved on Epi that i feel are top notch. Was skeptical about this one feeling it was close to Tom Valenti's Lamb shank recipe below and would be too rich for beef. Wow, don't know if it was the can of whole tomatoes opposed to tomatoe paste, mushrooms or lack of chicken broth (unlikely), but I prefered this to the staple below and I LOVE lamb! Try it . http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views /Tom-Valentis-Lamb-Shanks-105869I've been making Tom Valintine's

Excellent!! Made this one with minor changes because I didn't have everything on hand: no mushrooms, fewer peppers, only top round, no flour-and it was still excellent! Family loved it and asked for it again ASAP. Served over steamed brown rice. This one's a keeper!

This dish is delicious - rich, warm, satisfying. I used only beef and didn't bother making the grillades - I just cooked the beef in chunks. I also didn't bother measuring the vegetables (just used one onion, 1 pepper, and 3 ribs of celery), but other than that followed the recipe. Next time I make it I'm going to use more meat (maybe 3 lbs.) - or maybe even double the whole recipe as I'm pretty sure it would freeze excellently. I served it over pureed cauliflower as suggested and that also was a big hit.

As an alternative to balsamic vinegar, try cream - mmm!

Delicious! I combined suggestions from the previous reviewers and used only top round steak, replaced red with green peppers and baby bellas with reconstituted shitakes. I served it over creamy grits, which my boyfriend, the northerner, was blown away by. In this economy, the real challenge is to get on a "How to Cook a Wolf" tip and make something superlative out of humble ingredients. I call this dish a total success, and will absolutely make it again. If I had a little andouille, I'd use that. But, hey-- maybe next year.

This was terrific. It turned a very tough cut of beef into falling apart tender. Didn't have red pepper so I used green. Added another tablespoon of balsamic vinegar, too. Very complex, savory flavors and unusual combination of herbs. And a nice kick from the cayenne. We all loved it. I agree with other reviewers that people have not yet discovered this recipe. Glad I did.

This was great. Didn't use veal - 2 lbs top round. It was easy to pound and etc. Tasted good the first day,expect the leftovers to be even better

I am shocked to see there have not been prior reviews, maybe there were so many they started with a clean slate. This is a fantastic recipe! I can't wait to go buy more cheap meat so I can have this again. I did not use the veal and used an inexpensive peice of bottom round beef. I did use dried shitake mushrooms since that is what I had on hand. Served it over polenta and this is defineately going into my "for company" file. A great recipe to be able to use what you have on hand. Hope if you try this you enjoy it as much as we did.
