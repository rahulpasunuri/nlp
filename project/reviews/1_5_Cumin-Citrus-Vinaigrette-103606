I added a small clove of garlic and an extra tablespoon of lemon juice. Yummy.

This dressing is too bland for my taste. Perhaps it could be perked up with a dash of tabasco or something.

This recipe is light, but lacks flavor. The strongest flavor is the shallot & it overwhelms the rest of the vinaigrette.
