I made this pretty much exactly as it's written, other than adding another half lemon's worth of juice and a tablespoon of brown sugar near the end. The end result is a little bland, I keep adding salt and tabasco. Next time I will use 5 or 6 jalapenos instead of 2. But I generally like things very spicy. 3 forks because I found this very convenient as you don't need to use many pans to make it.

Loved the recipe with tomatoes and sausage added. Fresh herbs and unsweetened chocolate were delicious.

I made this according to the recipe except for the huge jalapenos that i found at grocery store so it had some kick. its fantastic with sour cream on top. my superbowl guests loved it as well! it was easy to make and i would definitely make it again.

I loved this recipe when I was done with it but wasn't sure how to rate it since I made so many changes. I added 12 oz of a vegetarian substitute for ground beef and substituted a green pepper for the red one (for color). I also added 2 cans of diced tomatoes and some chicken broth to dilute it. I guess by adding these ingredients the recipe becomes a lot more like traditional chili. My husband and I both thought the result was fabulous. I plan to make this one again and again. Next time I may add some barley or pasta as suggested by another reviewer.

This is a very flavorful vegetarian chili, and as you can tell from all of the comments, the recipe is extremely flexible. I definitely recommend using the fresh herbs if you can, and I added fresh cilantro. I also used zucchini instead of celery. Like the other cooks, I added canned tomatoes to make it more like chili and less like a black bean stew.

Hello...I made this chili for a large gathering and it was quite popular. It is out of the realm of traditional chili but very good in its own right. I added a large can of diced tomatoes (with the juice) because I cannot imagine chili without tomatoes...nice touch. Also, I cooked it in a slow cooker over eight hours set on low. It's a good fix and forget type dish when done that way. Very nutritious and low-fat/high fiber. Tastes even better left over.

I've been looking for a good meatless chili for awhile, I wanted a regular red chili, just without any meat! I sort of liked the basic sound of this recipe, and figured I could add the tomatoes (as other's suggested). I mixed up the beans, used black, kidney & chickpeas, added cilantro, green pepper, edamame, and vegie crumbles, stewed tomatoes and a bit of tomato juice when I needed to loosen it up. I'm not a vegetarian, just trying to eat better, and this came out like really great meaty chili! We froze the left overs, two weeks later my husband made it for dinner, I said, "Boy this is good, where did you order it from?" He told me it was what I had made, that sold me on my converted recipe, although I'm definately going to try this recipe as written, soon.

I just had to add my opinion on this because their are so many negative comments. I have this cook book and have made this particular recipe several times. My husband and I think it is very good. It is definitely not your typical chili, but it is a great change from that. So, if you are looking for something like a traditional chili this probably won't do it. If you are looking for something different, try it you'll like it!!

This one can be really decadent if you play with it a little. I put cooked shell pasta in it too, almost Chicago style chili meets Texas goolosh.

This chili had an extremely odd and almost unpleasant taste. I added lots of tomatoes and a little bit of sugar and that barely saved it. I am sure there are better veggie chili recipes to be made.

This chili has a very peculiar taste. I added lots of tomatoes. However, it is still sitting in my fridge and not disappearing quickly.

maybe if you added tomatoes you could get this down but I'm not sure. Chocolate is great in good recipes, but this is not a good recipe.

This is a good vegetarian chili. As the recipe states, the toasted pumpkin seeds are essential. The chocolate is definitely a good additiion. I agree with first reviewer that tomatoes would be an asset.

not very interesting as written. becomes quite delicious with the addition of about two cups of diced tomatoes and their juice, as well as a hit of wine and some fiddling with the spices. the chocolate is a great ingredient.
