This was incredibly easy and very good - moist, flavorful, Yummy~! I served it with the spinach, roasted beet and goat cheese salad (on this site) and a pureed cauliflower, kale and orange peel concoction that was really interesting, for a super healthy and tasty meal!

Tasty and so easy! Used boneless, skinless breasts, regular Gorgonzola, and added some fresh chopped sage and garlic to the mix. The sauce is delicious!

A decent dish that is quick and easy to make. I found the chicken a little bland even with the Gorgonzola. Next time I'll add some seasoning to give it more character and serve with some crunchy homefries to play off the different textures.

So easy and so good.....only change was to swap chicken broth for the water ...I served the chicken on a bed of mixed greens and used the sauce sparingly on the greens. The brown rice is a great addition. Definitely a keeper....and it is so darn easy and fast....

Tastes great, I started to add dried cranberries and wilted spinach to the gorgonzola to give it some color. A weeknight favorite!

I think this didn't work for me because of the gorgonzola. It was so bitter and strong. I'm sure that's how it is supposed to be but I just didn't like it. Loved that rice that's recommended though (nutty brown rice). I wonder if something like Brie would work?

We liked this recipe so much, we made it two days in a row! We used boneless skinless chicken breasts and the recipe still worked well.

This was the easiest, quickest thing ever to make and my husband can't stop talking about it. Served it over a spinach salad.

This made a great quick impromptu lunch.As one of the reviewers suggested, I stuffed the boneless breasts, then wrapped in goose bacon (gives an intense smoky flavor) put olive oil on bottom of a baking dish and drizzled balsamic and some oil on top. Viola. Excellent.

My boyfriend made this chicken dish and it came out lovely. I should clarify - this is the first time he's really ever cooked :) Needless to say, searing the chicken at the beginning kept the chicken juicy and tender. We used regular Gorgonzola instead of dolce and the flavor was excellent (I like the heartier Gorgonzola better!) We also used boneless breasts instead and just reduced the cooking time. Simple, elegant. Would definitely make it again.

Have made several times--with company and just family--elegant and quick so you can enjoy whomever your company may be. Served first course of parm risotto while this was roasting and served chicken with sauteed spinach--nice compliment to the chicken. Now a "go to" easy dinner party recipe.

Tried this recipe again tonight with blue cheese instead of gorgonzola because the grocery store I went to did not have the gorgo.... Bad call. Gorgo makes the dish, blue cheese is a poor substitute. See my original review below...

I modified the recipe, and am still getting rave reviews from my family for last night's dinner. Boneless skinless, breasts, stuffed with gorgonzola, wrapped in bacon, then seasoned with the salt and pepper. Lightly coated the bottom of a baking dish with olive oil, and drizzled olive oil and balsamic vinegar (more V than O) on top of the chicken as well, topping it off with a few crumbles of gorgonzola on each piece... the clean up was fantastically easy and the chicken flavor was incredible, especially with some of the sauce spooned on top afterwards.

Great recipe and easy to do....I was surprised it came out so great the first try. It is a little light on seasoning...I would plan on adding a bit to your taste. I'd give it 3 1/2

This is a good, easy, and stress free recipe that even a novice can make. I subbed olive oil instead of veg. oil, and crammed more cheese than the recipe called for. The crisp cheese that oozed out in the oven is special treat in and of it-self. The brussell sprouts idea was a great call!

This was good. The chicken was very moist, but the flavor of the gorgonzola was a bit too powerful according to my family. I think if you are a gorgonzola fan you would like this recipe.

We made this recipe with two boneless-skinless chicken breasts. We used more cheese than the recipe said by making two pockets per breast. We "sewed" the pockets together using toothpicks, since so many reviews were concerned about cheese-loss. Cooking time for two breasts was still 20 minutes to get to 170-ish degrees. We used 2T balsamic and 1/4 cup water, with about 3/4T butter to make up for the loss of "juice" since we didn't have skins on our chicken. When the sauce was almost done we added a little (less than a T) more cheese because we love cheese. :) We served it with brussels sprouts and they tasted delicious together! You can use the brussels to sop up the leftover juice on your plate. Yummy.

Very easy and yummy chicken recipe. No major modifications necessary. Good for weekday dinner.

I thought that this was a nice, easy recipe for a weeknight dinner. It's also a good way to use up any leftover blue cheese that you may have laying around. Just be careful not to overcook it--mine came out a bit dry.

This is an excellent dinner for the amount of work and ingredients. This will be a staple weeknight dinner. The sauce in delicious.

Super easy dish to make even on a week night. I used boneless chicken breasts since that was all I had, cut a pocket in them and just put them in the oven (skipped the browning). Not as pretty as the picture because of the chicken substitution, but they were delicious, very quick, and even held up when my husband was 45 minutes late for dinner!

I agree with previous reviewers that this is a great easy, quick, and tasty weeknight meal. Having read the reviews, I was a little worried about "losing" my gorgonzola. Once I was done crisping the skin on the stovetop, I added more gorgonzola into the pocked. This worked really well. I also added some wondra to my sauce, it thickened up beautifully and was one of the best quick sauces I have made in some time!

Good, easy recipe. I made it for my boyfriend's family over Thanksgiving and they all just went on and on about how great it was. I wasn't too impressed with the nutty brown rice, though.

The chicken came out nice and crispy. The dolce Gorgonzola did not work well with the chicken. Sauce not great.

Chicken was excellent. I don't usually use bone-in, skin-on breasts. I don't think the gorgonzola added much and like Faitheliz, my sauce didn't thicken.

I have to say that, despite high hopes and love for gorgonzola, I really didnt think this was very good. The chicken was decent (skin was crispy) but I thought the dolce gorgonzola imparted very little flavor. The sauce tasted pretty good but it was impossible to skim all the fat from it and it didnt thicken properly despite much boiling. All in all, sort of a pain to make due to the high oven heat and spitting chicken fat, and not very good.

Great flavor, super easy. But be sure to put the sauce on the plate, not the chicken, or you'll ruin the beautiful brown, crispy skin.

Very good and so easy to make. Next time i will probably use a tad less cheese.

I was really excited about this recipe since I love Gorgonzola cheese. However, I felt the cheese lost its bite after baking and the chicken was bland without the balsamic sauce. I also paired this with the Nutty Brown rice recipe as suggested and did not enjoy the nutmeg with the balsamic and cheese. I won't make this again.

I used skinless boneless and the meat was a little rough although the taste was good. If i make it again i may try pounding the chicken first. Did anyone else have this problem?

I made this with boneless, skinless chicken breasts, and it turned out great. I added bacon -- I microwaved it for about two minutes, and then wrapped it around the cheese-stuffed chicken before browning in the pan. This recipe was very easy and fast. I will make it again soon!

This is an outstanding recipe- easy and very delicious. After reading the comments about cheese escaping, I used a skewer on each piece and that worked beautifully. I also used crumbled gorgonzola.

This was really delicious. I used aged Gorgonzola as my grocery store was out of dolce. Serve with Nutty Brown Rice and cranberry sauce. Great meal!

This recipe was OK - not stellar by any means. I probably won't make it again. It was a little bland. If I did make it again, I might marinate the chicken to give it a little more flavor.

I added just a pinch of flour to the gravy to help it thicken. The balsamic vinegar really complimented the chicken. This is a nice and easy recipe that won't require too much of your night.

@FreshCope - this is nice because it suggests pairings to people that may be inexperienced working with a strong cheese like Gorgonzola. @Gwtwfan27 - next time try using a toothpick to close the slit in the side of the meat, it should keep the cheese inside the chicken more so than just leaving it open. :) I've used a recipe of walnut and gorgonzola stuffed chicken similar to this for years. The cheese mellows with the heat, and the walnuts pair extremely well. The balsamic adds a bit of acid to liven up the dish.

Great recipe. Very simple! The combination of Gorgonzola and balsamic vinegar was delicious. I served it with a rice pilaf and spinach salad.

I know the recipe said some of the gorgonzola would disappear but a whole lot leaked out. The balsamic sauce was nice, especially with brown rice.

Very easy and tasty for a weeknight supper. Added white wine to the pan juices and reduced with balsamic. The nutty rice is a great pairing.
