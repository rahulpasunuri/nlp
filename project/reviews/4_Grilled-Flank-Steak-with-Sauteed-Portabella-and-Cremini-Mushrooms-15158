This is the best flank steak recipe I have tried. A big hit with my dinner party last night. Only tweak was the time on the BBQ. 7-9 minutes per side is way too much for medium rare. Also made the mushrooms. The two are a stellar combo. A Winner!

I just used the marinade recipe for grilling flank steak. Absolutely loved it. On par with a marinade recipe my family has used for flank steak for the past 10 years.

I have yet to give 4 forks, but this one deserves almost 3.75. It was delicious! I added some garlic and rosemary to the marinade and did reduce the sugar as other reviews mentioned. I would also reduce sugar in the mushrooms (which were amazing). The only problem with this was my flank steak, which I think was not the best. But the flavors....with the combination of the mushrooms...definitely a keeper. You won't be sorry if you try it!

I love this recipe and have made it several times already. Instead of cremini mushrooms, which are hard to find here, I used only baby bellas from Costco. Worked great. I also just sauteed the mushrooms in butter with the scallions and then added just a little soy sauce and balsamic vinegar, and a scant amount of sugar. otherwise it is too sweet.

My first flank steak and I AM IN LOVE! This was SO good! I didn't have any shallots, so just sliced up an onion super thin, and used 1/4 cup of brown sugar (not packed). It had the perfect sweetness to it. Instead of serving with the mushrooms as suggested, I made a mushroom risotto and it was the perfect accompaniment! Definitely will make again and again!

This is definitely my "go to" recipe for flank steaks! Although I usually dice up half an onion in place of the shallots. And I don't usually add as much sugar as the recipe calls for...A keeper for sure!

Rating: 4
This was fabulous. Although, I took the advice of the other reviewers and reduced the amount of sugar significantly. I think the amount of sugar/sweetness that you add will depend on the quality of the balsamic that you use. But great recipe, and very easy to do most of the work ahead of time and therefore works well for entertaining.

This was very tasty, indeed. To GinGin2, I found this information that might help: Flank steaks are very lean and are full of flavor. The flank steak is also known by the following names: - London Broil - Jiffy Steak - Flank Steak Fillet Hope that helps!

I really like this recipe and I made it often when I lived in the States. To me, flank steak is very flavorful and if cooked and cut correctly has tons of flavor. This recipe illustrates that. But I now need help. I am living in Germany and the cuts of beef are very different. Anyone ever live in Germany and know what I can tell the butcher or how (?) to cut the beef similarly? I don't even know if flank steak is a cut here or not. I really want to make this again. Help!!

This recipe, paired with the mushrooms, is absolutely my favorite dinner. Not only are there few ingredients to remember, both dishes are easy to prepare. This is also the perfect dinner for company. The steak can be marinated ahead and the majority of the mushroom work can also be made ahead. This dish can also be made gluten-free by substituting the soy sauce with tamari.

My husband and I LOVED this recipe! So easy to make, elegant and delicious! I used tri-tip once instead of flank steak...yummy!!

Easy and delicious!!! The crust formed by the sugar in the marinade made this steak very tasty. There was not one bite left by anyone. Even my children ages 11 and 14 loved it. We served ours with sauteed baby portabellas...yum...I want more!

Letting meat sit in an acidy marinade like vinegar for "up to 2 days" turns the meat to mush. 20 minutes max for such a thin cut of meat.

Rating: 3
This recipe is very simple but delicious and showy enough for company. I give it 4 forks after cutting down the sugar by about 75%. Next time I will skip the sugar and just add a squirt of honey. The sauteed Portabellas and Cremini Mushrooms is a must addition to us. They were fabulous. I didn't have Cremini so just used all Bellas. Excellent and simple.

Good concept, but way too much sugar. I should have trusted my intuition on this one. I would cut the sugar down to 1 Tbs. for marinade and mushrooms. Also, try it with a Tbs. of dijon mustard in the liquids.

Very good. Easy for a weeknight. Would cut back on the sugar next time in both steak and mushrooms.

This dish was great and easy to make. THe mushrooms were wonderful, a little on the sweet side so next time I will use less sugar. All I had were regular button mushrooms and they were just fine.

This recipe was a big hit in our household. You have to be a balsamic vinegar fan, though. Used plain mushrooms that we had on hand, and it still tasted great!

Rating: 2
This was good, but I agree with another reviewer - it must depend on the quality of the flank steak. My regular butcher was closed so I had to get mine at the usual mainstream grocer and in spite of marinating for over 4 hours and cooking exactly as instructed, the meat was tough. Additionally, though the meat had a nice flavor I think there are better flank recipes out there. The redeeming thing was the mushrooms were excellent so I will keep that part.

Rating: 4
This is one of my family's favorite recipe. Used green onions instead of the shallots. The shallots seem to cancel out the flavor. For the portabella mushrooms, I cut the cooking sauce into half and used green onions again. Added carmelized onions with the portabella mushrooms and was a superb main dish!

Rating: 2
I found the sauce a little too sweet; in the future I will probably add less sugar and perhaps a little less vinegar. It did, however, give the meat a fairly strong and lasting flavor. Sliced thin, it was wonderful in cold sandwiches the next day. I did some flank steaks and some London broil...actually preferred the London broil as with a thicker cut of meat the sauce was not as permeating.

This is great!!! I served it with a magnum of 1990 Beaucastel and everyone loved it.

Are you all kidding? There was no one on my guest list that liked it. The meat marinade was mediocre at best with too much vinegar. The mushrooms were destroyed by this vinegar based meal. Definitely a hands down on this one!

An excellent meal for entertaining....I can never have enough mushrooms and the quanitity here was perfect...everyone gave it 4 forks...prep work can be done day before...I marinated the beef for 24hrs. I am preparing it again this week-end...with sauteed cherry tomatoes and grilled zucchini....and roasted Yukon Golds w/olive oil and thyme.. I love it when recipes are as easy as tey sound...

The steak was easy to prepare and the flavor was great. I marinaded it for 24 hrs. and the flavors premeated the meat. The mushrooms were less of a success. I enjoyed them, but thought along with everyone else, that the basalmic flavor overwhelmed the mushrooms. I'd make the steak again without any question. I'd consider possibly using the mushroom recipe again with only half of the basalmic the recipe calls for and then reduce the amount of sauce that the mushrooms are sauted in.

Wow. This receipe was a hit. The mushrooms were devine and I didn't skimp with them. The meat flavor was just as good. It' s going into my hall of fame.

Great marinade and fantastic with the mushrooms. We used portabellini and cremini and loved their texture and flavor. Marinaded for 4 hours, but will probably try a bit longer next time. Good recipe for entertaining because you can do the majority of the work ahead of time.

I use this marinade on every type of beef from London Broil to Chateau Briand - even without the mushrooms, it is excellent.

So simple yet so good!! I have been making this since I got my Gourmet issue in June 1998. (I still have the copy, I saved it for this recipe)The easy marinade is wonderful, and the ingredients are always on hand. If you don't have shallots just substitute garlic. I always make the twiced baked with fresh basil as a side. The kids love this and fight over the mushrooms! I have to say though that I didn't experience a gas problem like the previous reviewer! Sorry, must have been something else.

Rating: 4
I have now had this for the third day and it was much better since the flavor has really soaked in. However, my husband and I, who are not prone to having gas, have had gas problems all 3 days. I know it has to be something in this food, so I don't suggest making it for a first date. But it was really delicious, did anyone else have this gas problem, and if so, what caused it?

Definitely marinate overnight. Regular mushrooms were fine.

This was a fabulous recipe. I kept the flank steak whole to grill and it was delicious. didn't know what cremini mushrooms were and my local grocery stores didn't have any. I believe another common name for them is Baby Portabellos--those are easy to find. I ended up using regular mushrooms, with the portabellos--great result. Don't be deceived by what 1 1/2 lbs portabellos look like before cooked--they cook down big time. This recipe was just perfect for 8 adults.

This is incredible. It makes a good meal for entertaining. It is one of my favorite dished to prepare in the summer on the grill. A good deal of the work can be done ahead of time allowing me to actually host instead of working in the kitchen. I usually serve it with twice-baked potatoes with sour cream and basil.

This was a very delicious recipe with absolutely perfect and scrumptious results. The mushrooms were sublime, the marinade incredible in it's simplicity of ingredients, the meat so beautifully flavored! I cook a lot but this recipe, in it's simplicity was one of the best I've made. I served it with roasted potatoes and garlic, steamed brocoli and for dessert, an apple pear cranberry crisp (also thanks to bon apetit) with vanilla ice cream. A perfect fall/winter weekend dinner! Make this and be very pleased!
