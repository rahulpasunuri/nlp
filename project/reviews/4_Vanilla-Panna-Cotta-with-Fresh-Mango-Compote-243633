I have made this many times, (buy 1 bag of agar, agar and you too will have enough to make this dish many, many times). I think the agar agar does give this a really great mouth feel, however it takes much longer to fully dissolve than 5 minutes. It's a great foil for berries and/or other fruit.

I made this for a dinner party to follow a rather heavy meal, and everyone loved it. I too could not find agar, so followed the user's suggestion of unflavoured gelatin as a substitute. I used slightly less than 1:1 (approx. 1 1/2 tsp), which may have lightened the consistency somewhat. The mango compote provided a very nice balance.

I couldn't find agar so used flavorless gelatin but overall the recipe was just too heavy for everyone's stomachs. I loved the mango compote with the citrus infusion though. I would be interested in learning a version that has a little less cream or weight.
