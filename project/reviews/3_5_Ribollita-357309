I followed the recipe instructions with the following substitutions: red beans instead of white, celery root instead of the Yukon gold, and two cans of diced tomatoes instead of fresh. Made a huge pot of soup, amazingly delicious! It is a lot of chopping, but the results couldn't be tastier or healthier.

As written, this recipe is yummy. I would make it again this way. However, I admit that I enjoy tweaking recipes as my mood and available ingredients dictate. So...I have also strayed from 'ribollita' and done the following which was enjoyed very much, as well: Made the main vegetable portion of the soup in one pot and cooked either beans or tubetti pastas separately. One the veggie part was cooked, I blended till smooth with an immersion blender and then added in the cooked beans or pastas for texture. Sometimes I even stirred in a little organic plain yogurt at the very end. I have also added in some feta chunks for serving. Every variation has been good! Cooking is fun and experimental and sometimes great meals come from 'accidents' and experimenting. Some will be duds, but some will be winners. Enjoy!

definitely a keeper. the most important detail is that the soup must be eaten THE DAY AFTER it's been prepared.

This thick, rich, healthy soup was absolutely delicious. As a bread baker, I was pleased to find such a worthy dish to utilize my extra output! We'll be enjoying this recipe many more times.

I was growing a bit bored of my usual minestrone recipe. This soup was an attempt to branch out while not excluding my vegetarian elder daughter. I used Great Northern beans (pre-cooked in a pressure cooker 10 minutes), and, finding no black kale, I used more chard. The result was very good. I agree with other reviewers that the addition of the torn hard bread is key. They end up with a soft, doughy texture reminding me of Pennsylvania-Dutch soup dumplings.

My family and I enjoyed this soup. It reminded me of my days as a student in Italy. I found it worked really well substituting different vegetables depending on what I had to use up  any root vegetables will do in place of celery/potato. I've used different dark greens instead of kale, and I use more carrots but no fennel. Great for using up the CSA veggies sitting in my fridge. I used a pressure cooker for the beans which cuts the time. Also, ribollita is traditionally eaten with crumbled stale bread, so it's great for using up your hardened baguettes. Chop small and heat in the soup for a few minutes before serving. YUM!

I hated it. Took hours to chop everything and then I was terribly disappointed. Don't bother, there are so many excellent recipes here.

Very, very good. Love a flavorful vegetarian dish-and this is it! I did substitute canned beans. Comes together quickly for nice weeknight meal. Addition of the torn bread is key!

This soup was so tasty. I have to admit that I didn't have high expectations just because I wasn't sure how much flavor a soup with mostly vegetables would taste. But, it was surprisingly good! I really think that the key to giving the soup depth of flavor is the parmesan rind. This recipe is very hearty for being vegetarian and it's extremely healthy too. It's a keeper.

Very good soup, I wish I could give it 3.5 stars. It definitely improved on the second day. I've never been a fan of kale or chard, but both held up nicely in this soup. Shredded some Parmesan on top, otherwise made this exactly as written.
