My family loves this. My father-in-law even took it back with him to Germany for other relatives to try. It is VERY spicy with good mustard powder. I think it would be great with cold meats and a strong hard cheese, like Manchego. Easy to make, too.

This recipe just didn't work as a relish - not enough savory or tart or sweet, just blah, and not pretty either! I'm sorry, squash, you were wasted.
