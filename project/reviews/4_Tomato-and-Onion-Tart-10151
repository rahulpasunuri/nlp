Ridiculously wonderful. Made with brandywine heirlooms from our garden. Simple, yet lovely. Used gruyere and followed previous suggestions to lay tomatoes on paper towels and drain the carmelized onions. It was not soggy at all.

I've been making this tart for over a decade now, and it's probably the only reason that my friends like me. Keeping it from getting soggy has been the single biggest challenge I've confronted. So much of it has to do with how variable tomatoes can be; some are juicier than others. But here are the steps I've taken: --letting the tomato slices rest on paper-towels for a while --setting the caramelized onions in a strainer, as there's a lot of excess liquid/oil/butter remaining in them--and if you set a bowl beneath the strainer, you end up with really savory butter/oil for other cooking tasks --using cold vodka instead of ice water for the butter crust, an America's Test Kitchen pie-crust trick: it makes the dough moist enough to hold together and roll out, but it bakes out and leaves the crust even flakier.

Excellent recipe. I cut my tomatoes in rounds, let them drain, and sprinkled Herbs de Provence on top before baking.

So sweet and delicious, made with fresh veggies from the CSA. I used parm and feta for the cheese, skipped the olives and added fresh thyme to the onions and sprinkled fresh basil with the cheese. But the tomatoes and onions were so flavorful that the herbs were unnecessary.

This is the most delicious tart....a huge hit at our Easter brunch. The crust was easy and delicious and the toppings were the perfect. I made the dough the night before and brought to room temp. and hour before rolling out. I will make this again for an upcoming party where no doubt, I will be sending the recipe to all who attend.

This is one of the best tarts I've ever tasted. I used a pre-made crust, left out the olives and used feta and parmesan cheese! It turned out fantastic! My 2 year old gobbled it up faster then I did! Oh, and the second time I made it I added garlic to the onions. Yummy!

agree w/ other reviewers, the crust was terrific and so easy (even for a really novice and lazy crust-maker like me)! also yes, towel draining the tomato slices really kept the crust perfectly flaky and w/o any shred of sogginess whatsoever. i was REALLY skeptical that you just throw the whole thing together and do not have to blind bake, or even just par-bake, the crust, yet i trusted the recipe and WOW, what terrific, perfect results! i had over-ripened heirloom tomatoes, so just combined those w/ 2 plum tomatoes and it was fabulous. also cut up 4 strips of thick-cut applewood smoked deli bacon, sauteed them in pan first med- med high heat, then omitted the olive oil (just used the bacon drippings - oh joy!!), turned the heat down to medium and added onions, following recipe rest of way. this was an awesome addition for you pork-lovers out there! (if you do this, then i recommend skipping adding any additional salt, as the bacon would be enough seasoning - also, you might want to adjust the olives as well for the same reason). try it, you'll love it. promise, it's a big hit!

This tart made a beautiful presentation (I sliced the tomatoes about 1/8 inch thick and arranged them in concentric circles) and got rave reviews. However, the flavor was dependentt on having ripe, tangy, end-of-summer tomatoes - I wouldn't bother making it with anything less than great ones. The crust turned out wonderfully (and I'm phobic of making pastry!), but should be rolled a bit larger than 14 inches to allow a 3/4-inch overhang from a 12-inch tart pan, since the pan has some depth too.

Rating: 4
I really enjoyed this recipe and I will definitely make it again! The smell of the baking tart would garner four stars alone. Chefs should note that the suggested crust is simply too crumbly to be practical for this tart.

Rating: 4
After reading the reviews, I was really excited to try this tart, but it didn't live up to my expectations. It tasted a little like french onion soup, except topped with tomatoes and in a crust. I made it exactly as called for except I didn't include the olives. I won't be making this one again.

Rating: 4
I made one of these and made another the next day it was such a hit. I couldn't find Nicoise olives and when I tried to find something comparable, I was told Kalamatas. Those are strong so I only put a few of them on top for color. I also added sliced zucchini to the second one I made. This is a fabulous recipe!

Rating: 4
I made this for a buffet-style brunch and I should have made about 3 more. It was gone like that! I used a pre-baked crust and it was super fast to make and looked beautiful. Will keep it as a favorite. My only trouble was finding pitted nicoise olives...but I was pressed for time and without my olive pitter so I just left them in and prayed for no chipped teeth. If you know what a nicoise tastes like, you can sub out, but don't assume all small dark olives taste the same...these are not kalamatas! Also, I say anytime you have a choice of Gruyere or something else, it's always worth the money to go Gruyere. I love that cheese.

This was terrific and beautiful. Thank you for this one! I used a mix of roma and regular tomatoes. I followed other reviewers advice and absorbed extra moisture out of the regular tomatoes with paper towels before using them and had no problem with the crust being soggy. I used quartered kalamata olives since I didn't have Nicoise olives and also garnished with basil. Definately a keeper.

If I could give this 5 forks, I would! Impressive to serve, simple ingredients, easy to make, and most of all, tastes divine! I had all ready reviewed the butter pastry dough for a quiche I made last week. This week, because that dough was foolproof, abundant in amount, & totally delicious I decided to do the Tomato and Onion Tart that goes with it. OMG!!!!!!!!! I could see where one young woman had it at her wedding meal. My husband went ga, ga over it, & even wanted to take a photo as well. The crust makes this even more tantalizing......crisp on the bottom, light, almost like puff pastry.....first time for me with that experience in tart/pie dough! Plus, it was so easy to work with as well. I too used my Cuisinart & patted the dough into a ball after it was ALMOST together in the machine....I think that's the major success for the crisp, light, consistancy - minimal pulsing & handling. Thank-you, thank-you!

i really love this easy tart. often i use an already pie crust rubbed with a little butter to crisp as it cooks. sliced heirloom tomatos are fine, and i had no problems with sogginess. this is part of one of my favorite meals: grilled flank steak, the tart, and wax beans tossed with butter, lemon juice and coarse grain mustard. the flavors are perfect!

With a mediterranean table setting, a bottle of good red, a simple green salad and fine company, this was the hit of our New Years lunch. Even the children had seconds and now want it to be a new tradition in the family. I made a few slight changes....used the tomatoes we had in the fridge, a mix of reds and plum. I solved the "too wet" problem by spinning the tomatoes in a centrifugal lettuce dryer which removed quite a bit of the water along with a lot of the seeds. Also added a touch of garlic to the onions and sprinkled basil over the cheese and again on top of the tomatoes. A final dusting of parmesan on top and into the oven. Perfectly done in an hour. We're looking forward to the next one already.

I've made this recipe at least 2 dozen times since it was first published in 1995 and it is always a guaranteed hit. The butter pastry dough is a must! One can throw it together in less time than it takes to go out and buy a prepared crust and is so delicious. I have used it to make other vegetable tarts as well. Divine!!

This is a great tart. The dough is very easy to work with and baked up very crisp (especially amazing considering it isn't prebaked). I cheated and mixed the dough in my food processor. I would put less salt in the crust - perhaps just a tsp. I used fontina cheese and heirloom tomatoes and left out the olives. Did garnish the tart with snipped basil. I had no problem with sogginess - in fact, the crust was still crisp when I warmed the leftovers in the oven the next day. Great combination of flavors. Highly recommended.

Rating: 4
Instead of the dough, I used a puff pastry and baked in a round dish with 3" walls. I nixed the olives and used a semi-soft cheese I had rather than Gruyere. Absolutely EXQUISITE, and surprisingly easy because I didn't have to make the dough.

I oven dried plum maters from the garden and sauteed the onions the day before and stashed them in the frig. I used the already- made pie crust as well but didnt need to precook since the other ingredients were well-drained and dry. Used Kalamata olives, and the Italian cheese blend as I find most Gruyere very costly. This was so good-the dried tomatoes were still chewy and sweet. There wasnt much for leftovers!

This is a winner! I added minced garlic to the onions just as they were almost done cooking, and added some parmesan cheese to the jack cheese layer. I left out the olives.

Definitely a fun summer treat!

I made this just as written, using the gruyere, except i substituted the butter pastry dough with frozen pie crust. It was delicious, but I felt the tomatoes were a bit soggy. There is another tomato tart recipe that instructs you to "oven dry" the tomatoes so they are not soggy. i will make this again but try to use this technique to avoid mushy, runny tomatoes. But I have to say, even with the runny tomatoes, this dish was still DELISH!!

First made this on my honeymoon, several times since, and it is always fantastic and guests have always raved (Hi, Kristina!). It is rich, but not overwhelmingly so. I like that you can prep ingredients well ahead of time (make crust, carmelize onions, grate cheese, pit olives, slice tomatoes) so assembly before baking goes very fast. Have omitted olives on occasion; still great.

So VERY good, a 3+. I used a premade fold out crust, which worked just fine. I had lots of baby spinach so placed a layer over the crust, before the onions, to keep it from becoming soggy. Didn't have olives but it was still great. Served it as a "extra" along with a complete dinner and a family of four (two boys included) demolished it!!! All requested that I make it again, even kids who don't like onions OR tomatoes!

I appreciate what the reviewer wrote from seattle. I also felt this dish was soggy on the bottom. It was diffciult to cut b/c it fell apart while cutting.

I asked my mother-in-law to make this for my 40th birthday party. We were all smitten with the results. Very tasty, and a great presentation. Please look at the "spiced poussins" recipe that's part of this "menu" - I made that for the 3d time, using chicken parts, and once again everybody raved. My aunt the fabulous party-giver asked for the recipe. I've also liked the bread on this menu. The whole thing is a winner.

A picture would be very helpful in determining how to arrange the layer of tomatoes and olives. The prep time and baking time (closer to 75 minutes baking, rather than the 60 minutes described in the recipe) to be close to 3 hours. So, while the tart was very good - it was A LOT OF EFFORT. Also, I would recommend oven drying or towel drying the tomatoes - their juice made the crust a bit soggy. We also added fresh rosemary and black pepper to the crust.

I thought I was going to love this as I like all the ingredients. I have to agree with the earlier review from the cook from Germany, though. It was just too cheesey and oniony and the richness of those components (especially while warm) overwhelmed and dominated the other flavours. Another reviewer mentioned that it tasted better next day after sitting in the fridge, so I won't dismiss it entirely until I've tried it that way. It certainly looked gorgeous and was very easy to put together.

This dish is easy, gorgeous to look at, and delicious. I often bring it to 'pot-luck' gatherings and it never fails to get raves. One suggestion: Don't decide not to make this just because you can't find yellow tomatoes. As pretty as the mix of yellow and red tomatoes are, when I couldn't get yellow tomatoes I've made it with plum tomatoes only - not quite as striking but just as delicious!

Definetly could use a tart pan with a removeable bottom. I served it at room temp about 2 hrs after baking, but thought it was better the next day after sitting in fridge. Need to have a plan to get it out of the pan before trying to serve. Frozen puff pastry worked well. looks great.

I have made this many times since it first came out. It looks beautiful and tastes wonderful. I have always made it ahead, usually the day before and served it room temperature.

i varied it a little, but it still came out yummy. i used phyllo sheet dough, a combination of red and yellow onion and all plum tomatoes. i put the tomatoes under the gruyere instead of over, and used kalamata olive tapenade (1/2 teaspoonful dollops) for the nicoise olives. only needed 45 minutes in oven.

This tart looks as great as it tastes. It's quite the show stopper. I always finish it at the last minute with basil chiffonade--the fresh, "green" flavor of the basil balances the richness of the cheese, pastry and olives. A tip: if the bottom of your tart comes out a little on the soggy side, try baking the tart on a pre-heated pizza stone.

WHILE THIS RECIPE IS A DELICIOUS RECIPE, I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT ITS PREPARATION. WHILE VIEWING THE TV SHOW THIS SATURDAY, I NOTICED THAT THE TOMATOES WERE PLACED ON TOP OF THE CHEESE. THE CHEESE SEEMED TO BE OF A THICK VARIETY. HOWEVER, EVEN SO WOULD NOT USING TOMATOES (REGARDLESS IF THE TOMATOES ARE PLUM TOMATOES, WHICH WOULD CUT DOWN ON THE RELEASE OF JUICES) CREATE A PROBLEM WITH THE TART FIRMING AND COMING TOGETHER WELL. WOULD NOT THE JUICES CAUSE THE CHEESE TO BREAK DOWN RATHER THAN FIRM UP. WOULD THE BAKING TIME MAKE UP FOR THIS OR IS THE CHEESE LESS FIRM THAN IT LOOKS. BEING A CHEESE LOVER AND A TOMATOE LOVER HAS LED ME TO BELIEVE THAT THE BAKING TIME WOULD HAVE TO BE EITHER LONGER OR HIGHER TO ALLEVIATE THE JUICES. TONI francis3@bellatlantic.net
