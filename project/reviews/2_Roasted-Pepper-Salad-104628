This salad is tasty but not a WOW. Not every dish needs to be a standout. This is a good addition to almost any meal. I skipped the lettuce and used golden balsamic vinegar for a smoother taste. Be sure to rinse the capers.

I didn't have capers but I thought it was a nice, simple, healthy, and refreshing salad. I roasted red, orange, and yellow peppers together and it paired nicely with my chicken sausages.

I doubled the recipe and it was fabulous. I thought the flavors blended well and it didn't need anything additional. Everyone loved it!

Just so-so, the caper flavor was overwhelming, and for balance I wound up adding some olive oil, thus making dish no longer low fat. Definately needed something else
