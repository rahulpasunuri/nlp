I also replaced some of the ingredients to make it more traditional (rice vinegar and fish sauce). The sauce has delicious flavor. However, I think there are two important things needed to improve this dish. 1) marinate the meat (I tripled the sauce and used 1/3 of it to marinate the meat). 2) I agree to take all of the sauce and boil it down slightly to make it stick to the noodles better. Enjoy!

Delicious! I made the following changes because more authentic ingredients are easy to find now: used rice wine instead of white wine, sriracha instead of pepper flakes and fish sauce instead of anchovy paste. Definitely make a double amount of sauce and use it as a marinade; once the meat is cooking, bring the marinade to a boil and cook it down to be the sauce.

I made this as written except I didn't have bean sprouts. Also, I thought the dressing was really bland and added some sesame oil and chili garlic sauce. It helped a little but I didn't love this recipe. The meat really needs something to add more flavor. Marinating would probably be good...but then it isn't quick and easy is it?

Excellent and very easy to make. I doubled the sauce as others suggested.

This recipe is quick (~30 min) and delicious. Great for weeknight meal.

This is very good. My husband and kids love it. I did things a bit differently. I doubled the sauce and marinated the steak (I used flank) in it. I grilled the steak and while it was grilling, boiled down the sauce and poured it over rice noodles. I garnished with the mint, bell peppers, cucumbers and some snow peas.

this was awesome! we gobbled it up. quick to prepare and the flavors popped in my mouth. will definitely make this again. the name of the recipe is a little misleading though - should be called "vietnamese- style noodles with grilled steak". no big deal - this is delicious regardless.

Just finished dinner and my family really enjoyed this dish. As recommended by previous cooks, I doubled the sauce. I also substituted cilantro for the mint and squeezed on a little lime juice. Added shredded carrots & some edamame beans. Delicious. Can definitely alter/add vegis to your liking and not spoil the character of the recipe. Served with Asian Spinach Salad with Orange & Avacado (from this site). Colorful, fresh & flavorful meal.

Excellent, fresh and healthy. Also simple to make for a weekday night. I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and doubled the sauce. I also substited fish sauce for anchovy paste. I used only about 1/3 of the mint and made up the difference with fresh basil and cilantro -- this seemed to work very well. I also had some green onions and matchstick carrots on hand, so I threw those in. I think this dish would be good with a variety of fresh vegetables. Next time, I would like to try it with rice noodles and lime juice for the vinegar. I think this would make it even better and more authentic.

This is a great dish. I did not put in the red bell pepper, and I substituted the bean sprouts for carrots, but it was still amazing.

I can't believe I haven't reviewed this sooner!! I have made this many times and the recipe is always very forgiving. To the poster from Spain, shell steaks are the same as strip steaks. I actually like flank steak in this recipe. I have never added bean sprouts, but have added julienned cucumber, scallions and even avocado, and it always works! Very quick and delicious. I agree with the other reviewers though, doubling the sauce is best.

What is a shell steak?

Excellent dish. I doubled the sauce recipe also - used it for a marindate and added peanut butter to the sauce for the noodles. Wonderful dish and received rave reviews from my husband.

Delicious! After reading many of the reviews, I doubled the sauce and opted to add julienne carrots and lime juice. Also, I did a quick saute of the bell pepper, carrots and bean sprouts in Thai chili oil to turn up the heat just a notch. To serve, I put the vegetables on the bottom topped with the pasta and steak.

What a disappointment! After reading all the glowing reviews, I was expecting a delicious meal, but even after doubling the sauce and marinating the steak as suggested, the result was completely bland. I even used fresh mint, and still: blah. If you are considering this dish because you really like authentic vietnamese food and are craving a spicy meal, take my advice and triple - at least - the red pepper. As is, this recipe is a total taste let down.

This dish is perfect for entertaining, especially in summer. You can prepare everything in advance and serve at room temperature. I used grilled tofu instead of steak. My guests raved about it.

This is the perfect recipe for a warm day. I also add green onion and slivered snap peas.

This is a magnificent recipe, easy, healthy, satifies the carnivore and the health-leaning at the same time. I usually change every recipe here at least a little, but this is one I think I didn't mess with at all. Wait, yes I did. I did double the sauce. Also, I marinated the steak in chili oil (I make my own, but you can use sesame instead), soy sauce, chili paste, garlic, rice wine vinegar, a little water. I also use no anchovy paste in the sauce. Love this recipe. Love it! ps--the recipe really does lose a *lot* if you leave out the mint, or use dried mint. And it's a whole different thing with peanut sauce added.

This was tasty and easy. On advice of other chefs, I added 2T peanut sauce to the sauce and doubled other ingredients. I marinaded a flank steak in it overnight. I forgot to add in the mint and I don't think it lost anything. Very nice meal.

This was rated as the best dish I have ever made by my family. I decided against adding the mint, and BBQ'd the steak med. rare. Surprisingly unlike other dishes, it's the sauce soaked noodles that hold the bold flavor - compliments the steak and bean sprouts perfectly! Excellent idea if you are serving guests.

Fabulous! I've made this many times, and we DO have lots of great Vietnamese and Cambodian food around. It's easy and the common ingredients make it a snap to do whenever we want. Plus, it's very forgiving---I always just add whatever veggies we have on hand. Definitely don't need much else with it!

READ THIS REVIEW!!!! MAKE THE RECIPE AS DESCRIBED, BUT IF YOU ADD THREE TABLESPOONS OF PEANUT BUTTER TO THE SAUCE, IT BECOMES A MUCH MORE SUBSTANTIAL AND TASTY SAUCE! WE LOVED IT! - Mitchsol@pacbell.net

I would have liked to have rated this a 3-1/2. I am very fond of vietnamese food but I've recently moved to a location where there aren't any Vietnamese restuarants close by. I was very anxious to try this recipe and I'm glad that I did. I did double the sauce and made 1-1/2 times the other ingredients to serve 3. Didn't have anchovy paste but I replaced with 2 T. of fish sauce. I did think that for the next time I will use lime juice in place of the vinegar and chili/garlic sauce instead of the red pepper flakes. What made the recipe extra special was that I used fresh mint and bell pepper from my garden. Freshness accentuated the flavors so much more. I cut the mint chiffonade and used maybe 3/4 of the stated amount. Used filet mignon cooked to medium rare. Really didn't require any side dishes since the portions were very generous. A Saporro beer paired with it nicely.

I agree with others to double sauce. Maybe we have dainty appetites, but I really thought this made enough to serve three with a side. Nice hot weather dish.

I had very high expectations for this dish based on the ingredients and everyone's comments but I must say that it exceded my expectations! Following the suggestions, I doubled the sauce and used part of it to marinate the steak (though I'm not sure the marinade did much) and I also used less than half of the mint. This dish was amazing! It made my tastebuds explode!

Delicious! I agree with one of the other reviewers about the amount of mint, I only used half the amount called for. Otherwise, it was fantastic!

The steak was a bit unflavorful. The flavor of the noodles were fabulous. Any suggestions on how to flavor the meat would be helpful. Good hot or cold

ho chi minh never had it so good. ditto the spirit of the previous comments, tho i tailored it by blending cilantro, ginger and a little sesame oil to the sauce, half of which i used as a marinade. i don't know how kosher these changes are for a southeast asian recipe, but what the hell. also, i might omit the water for the marinade portion, so the flavor can be a touch denser.

I made this dish last night for my husband and I we looooooved it! Perfect blend of flavors. I doubled the sauce also and marinated the beef in it. I used angel hair pasta and roasted the peppers and took off the skin. This is a keeper in my recipe file for sure. It is fall right now but it would be great on a summer evening yumyum!

This is a delicious, quick dish, and easy to make too. I didn't have red pepper nor bean sprouts, so I substituted with julienned cucumber and carrots, and to add a green touch, steamed Chinese broccoli (gai lan)sliced in strips. It turned out great, except that I agree on more sauce for the noodles. I'll definitely make it again.

Rating: 4
Taste was incredible. Great play of spices that simply roll acoss the tongue. Only one thing I would change. Double the amount of sauce you would make to cover the noodles. Use half of the sauce to marinate the beef strips for about 1/2 hour at room temperature or overnight in the fridge. Grill beef over hickory wood in outdoor grill.

I have a very picky boyfriend who hates almost everything. He requests this recipe often, about once a week or so. It has just enough spice to tingle your taste buds, but it doesn't burn your tounge out of your mouth. I only use a scant amount of dried mint. The amount called for in the recipe gives a strange aftertaste. Also, I leave the bean sprouts out. This is a great recipe if you're short on time. I'm making it again tonight!
