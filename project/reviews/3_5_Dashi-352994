Simple. Easy. Does the job. There's really nothing to it. I've made it many, many times as the base for Udon soup.

Haven't made it yet but all of the other dashi recipes are so complicated - this one looks DIVINE!!!!! Only trick is to find the KOMBU. Promise to update forks to 4 once i find the kombu
