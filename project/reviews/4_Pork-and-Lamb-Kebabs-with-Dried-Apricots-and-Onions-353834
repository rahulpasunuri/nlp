This is one of my favorite recipes. It is a commitment in terms of time to prepare but the pay off is big. The taste of the spices with the little bit of cream and wine flavor in the marinade is just delicious. It is worth the effort!

I made the recipe exactly as the recipe said, and everyone loved it. GREAT IDEA: When my daughter saw the discarded onions from the strained marinade sitting on the counter, she asked if she could make the vegetable side dish. She sauteed the onions until they were translucent, removed the orange peels, stirred in some steamed green beans, and heated the mixture through. They may have been the best green beans I ever ate and of course went wonderfully with the main dish. Personal preference for the kebabs: next time I'll use little or no bacon. It was a little rich for my taste. I won't go out of my way to get lamb; pork alone would be just fine.

This is time consuming but the sauce is unbelievably good and the dish won be a grill-off trophy.

This recipe is so good that it's worth going through the hassle of boning and cutting up a leg of lamb. The marinade/sauce was a tasty and interesting balance of flavors. I'm not usually a fan of bacon with other meats, but in this case it works really well. Followed the recipe exactly and I wouldn't change a thing the next time I make it, which I surely will. Served it with saffron rice and a crisp green salad, and this birthday dinner was a huge success.

Very tasty! The cream was omitted both times I've prepared this. Prunes & dates were a good addition but I could not tell any difference when the orange peel strip were included vs when not used.

Excellent, and not overly difficult (if a bit time-consuming). Dried fruit and grilled meat are an excellent combination.

This is an amazing dish - so moist, very delicious. I have made this recipe with the called for ingredients and I have substituted the meats with either all pork as well as chicken thigh meat. All are spectacular - everyone always loves it!
