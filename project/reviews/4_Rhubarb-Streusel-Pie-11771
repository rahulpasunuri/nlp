This easy to make desert delicious. It is perfect with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side. I liked this pie warm but it is just as good cold. I will definitely make it again!

Fantastic recipe though there was more streusel topping and rhubarb than would fit in the crust so I'll just have to figure out something to do with that.

I used a store bought pie crust for the bottom, but otherwise followed the recipe closely. After letting the filling sit for a half hour, I drained the liquid that had settled before proceeding. I think this really helped keep the pie from getting runny. You also don't need to melt the red current jelly - if you apply it to the pie right out of the oven it will melt by itself. Huge hit - everyone loved this one.

This is a fabulous pie! Made it 2 weeks ago and made it again today. Followed the instructions, super easy and voila, a delicious way to end a meal.

I made this today and it got rave reviews. However, I did screw up the recipe. I didn't read it through, so I made the crust and poured in the rhubarb, sugar, tapioca, etc., topped it with streusel and popped it in the oven. 400 degrees for 20 minutes and 40 minutes at 350 degrees. Since I was baking two blueberry pies as well, I just followed the blueberry pie instructions. It was well received and since I live in New Orleans, several people had never had it before.

I've made this twice both times with great results. This is very simple and a great way to use rhubarb. Like others, I used all rhubarb and prefer it that way. I used a pre- made pie crust to save time. Also, this first time I made this, I doubled the topping and found it to be WAY too much - it was a full, thick covering. The second time, I used 1 1/2 times the amount and it was perfect.

This is my husbands FAVORITE rhubarb pie. I often use seedless raspberry jam (a pantry item in my house) for the glaze. Hubby likes it served warm with a scoop of good vanilla ice cream.

I also prepared it with double streusel and no jelly. I always add less sugar than suggested, and so nothing was overwhelmingly sweet. I also didn't use shortening, only butter (what's the point anyway?). To make the streusel even more devilish I added dried grated coconut (only about two tablespoons, it was just a hint of flavour). Despite doing the Pie under time pressure and having to leave the crust half-baked for a day, it was a hit. Perfect finale for a BBQ.

My family loved it. I took others' advice and doubled the streusel topping and omitted the jelly. It took a little less time to bake than the instructions indicated. I will make it again when I can find fresh rhubarb.

I wouldn't make this again. The streusel was overwhelming. I think I enjoy a double crust pie more. I thought the jam/jelly in the middle was a little over the top, making the pie too cloyingly sweet.

I've made this pie a few times for friends, and it is a hit! Both times, lacking sufficient rhubarb, I added strawberries. And once I substituted lingonberries for red currant jelly--very nice! I recommend baking at 320 for 50 minutes rather than 350. Also cover the crust with foil after turning the oven down from 450 to avoid unsightly (and poor tasting) burnt crust. Even with tapioca, I've found the consistancy to be more like a fruit crisp than a pie, but it's still very good. This IS my rhubarb pie recipe!

Tasted great! I only had about two cups of rhubarb (fresh from the garden!) so I added two cups of peaches I had frozen last summer. Rhubarb-peach streusel pie turned out really well. I expected it to be runny but the tapioca made it the perfect consistency. I didn't really like the crust. I messed it up a bit but I was still tasting the shortening hours later. I'll probably just use a store-bought crust next time. But the streusel topping was great and I loved not having to put a crust on top. I wouldn't blend/process the streusel next time. I'll make this again when the rhubarb grows back.

Excellent pie! I made two: rhubarb only and rhubarb and strawberry. We all had a slice of each but no one could definitively say which one was better. I took a shortcut on the pie crust by using a store-bought one and the only criticism my husband could find was with the crust, so next time, I will go all the way.

This was a great recipe! Made it for Easter and everyone loved it! I did use the currant jelly as I was making the Ham with mustard/currant glaze (April 03)and had some on hand, although I think you could just make a little more streusal and live without the jelly. This will be my annual spring time rhubarb pie from now on!

Add any combination of fruits that you like, but just once, try ALL rhubarb. What a treat! This is indeed the rhubarb pie to end all! A great combination of sweet and tart.

Always looking for ways to use up rhubarb, and this one is a keeper. Made one pie with just rhubarb and was tasty but not very pretty. Made another pie with half rhubarb and half sour cherries and was delicious and pretty! (Used same amount of tapioca and added a few drops of almond extract.)

I just made this tonight, a little wary at first, but it turned out great. I didn't do the currant jelly in the end, just didn't seem to need it. And rhubarb is great by itself, please don't mix it with strawberries (I'm a hardcore rhubarb fan...)

Scrumptious!! I was short 1 cup of rhubarb so added 1 cup of blackberries. perfect marriage. time was short so i used frozen deep dish pie crust, imagine how good if i had used the pate brisee.

A suggestion on how to avoid any problems with the tapioca is to pulverize it with the sugar in your food processor before adding it to the fruit. I have used this technique before and it works very well. I used 4 cups of rhubard and 2 cups of sliced strawberries for the filling. I also used pecans in the streusel topping. I served it at a Mother's Day dinner and it was very popular.

Delicious. I adapted it by halving the rhubarb and replacing it with cranberries plus one apple and the grated rhind of one orange. I also think the cooking time could be much less and would try it for 1/2 hour not 50 mins in the future.

The rhubarb pie was delicious but only a day after. Reason for that being my interpretation for "quick cooking tapioca" as the smallest tapioca pearls which cooks relatively quick... Even a day after, some of the tapioca pearls, which weren't sunk in the rhubarb sauce, were inedible. But the rest of them weren't noticeable after spending a night in the sauce. So, either look for real "quick cooking tapioca" or cook the tapioca beforehand.

This pie was excellent..I substituted strawberry jam for the currant jelly and my family loved it...it was easy and OH SOOO Tasty..I too used pecans instead of walnuts..try it you'll like it!It's hard to find good recipes for rhubarb but this one fits the bill.

I have made many rhubarb pies but this one beats them all!! Will definitely make it again. This recipe compares to none I have made.

You couldn't make a better rhubarb pie (says my husband)! I used pecans instead. It was the hit of the evening. In fact, I am making it again tonight for another party.
