Even though I don't like mushrooms, I try to make mushroom dishes for my husband. After making this, I could of eaten all of it myself. I am making this again tomorrow.

a waste of good mushrooms. Saute each kind of mushroom in a couple of tablespoons of butter and set aside. Return to haot pan with juices and 1 tbs of olive oil or peanut oil until very very hot. Add at least 1/4 cup or more of your favorite Brandy or liqueur and flambe until sauce is thick.

Ho-hum. Too salty for my tastes (and I have a pretty high 'salt tolerance'). Also too much parsley, and I generally like parsely but this was all I could taste (and salt). I wanted this as a fairly plain side dish but was disappointed all the same.
