This is a perfect dinner party meal. Asian flavors without being too out there for the most conservative western palate. There are few spicy meals that pair this well with a red wine... we served this with a 2007 Nine Stones Shiraz (~$10) and it tasted like a $30 wine given how good the pairing was. We skipped using the prata as a bun... it's better on the side and in less volume. We made about 2x the vegetables and could have tripled them, frankly. For the Raita we used 6 different types of mint from our garden and a bit more lime zest than was called for... was a lucky bet. This takes a lot of prep, but if you serve it as guests arrive you could probably do all the final cooking in 10 minutes... perfect!

Since our family is a big fan of the Grilled Chipotle Pork Burgers on this site, we were wishing we hadn't ventured into this one. The Raita is good, but I would nix the cilantro. It was very overpowering as is its nature! Beware: the lamb, that I got, anyway, is very greasy. I had heartburn within hours.

The flavor in this was excellent! My grocery store was out of ground lamb so we substituted ground chuck. It was very easy and I didn't think it was time consuming. I used the grilled flatbreads with za'atar recipe (found on this website) instead of buying premade naan. It was messy - but what good burger isn't?

I made these with boneless skinless chicken thighs ground up in the food processor and they were so delicious that we didn't miss the lamb. I LOVE this recipe. It's beautiful and delicious and so boldly flavored mmmm. A friend recommended breaking the burgers in half and folding the flatbread up like a taco and then wrapping the bottom half with foil like a gyro. This kept everything together and the drips to a minimum. Will make this again and again - delicious.

Tasty and delicious! A bit time consuming, but worth it (at least for one time) for the pleasure of eating it!

My husband and I loved this recipe. I think next time I will add more curry powder but the original recipe. was very flavorful.The raita was perfect. We did not eat it as a burger since it would be very messy.

We love lamb but I wouldn't bother with this again. It was messy but that would have been fine if they were good. There was nothing redeeming about this at all.

very nice recipe. i used naan and it was extremely messy. would also be good with standard burger buns. you could also make into bite-size burgers and use it as a delicious appetizer for a party.

Very good. I used regular yogurt which worked fine except it's a little runny.

Outstanding. I used eggplant instead of zucchini (that is what was in the garden at the time).

Awesome alternative burger recipe. Made recipe as is and found it to be perfect. I did not find the raita overpowering at all - maybe because I used Greek-style yogurt (check out Trader Joe's fage brand). Will certainly be making these again during the summer.

Didn't change a thing and loved it. If you have a crowd that you know likes curry, then you might want to increase it, but I found it subtle enough to please the masses. Great combination of grilled vegetables and raita, which wasn't strong at all.

The burgers were very good. I used less of the mint and cilantro and the raita was still way to strong. It over powered the meat. I would find a different raita next time i make this.

We loved these, but boy, were they messy! Who cares - we'll make them again and again. I would up the curry powder a bit, but we love curry. Otherwise wouldn't change a thing.
