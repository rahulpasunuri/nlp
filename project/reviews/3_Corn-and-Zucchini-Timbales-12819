My guests would have given this 4 stars, but I just thought it was pretty good. The recipe seemed a little inexact, though. I used a Kruhn corn zipper to remove the kernels from the cob, and I think I got more than I would have had I used a knife, because I only needed 4 ears. The zucchini I only used 1 of. I also sliced a thin piece of goat cheese and topped each timbale off with it. Next time I would crumble the goat cheese and stir it in with the zucchini. Oh, and I followed the other reviewer who did not strain the corn out. I wanted to keep all the fresh veggis. I did make this the day before and reheated it and I found it tasted as if I had just made it. I used a 200F oven though, for about half an hour. In a standard-sized muffin tin, without straining and with the added goat cheese, this made 12 timbales. Overall I would say that though it's not the fanciest dish, it's a great way to highlight the bounty of the summer season.

Very elegant. For a more pronounced corn flavor, don't strain out the solids. Of course, the texture will not be that of a silky custard but if you are trying to avoid the egginess, this will work.

I used left over cooked corn cut off the cob and substituted 50% with leftover cooked rice. I omitted the water, cut down the eggs and used left over cooked zucchini pressed to extract excess water. I added a couple tablespoons of butter and put roasted red peppers in the bottom so when you turned out the timbale, the red peppers made an attractive presentation. It was great and I used ALL leftovers!

I was so excited to make this and to use my summer veggies in a new way. It was very disappointing. I couldn't detect any of the corn flavor in the final product. The taste of the egg overpowered everything. I made enough to have leftovers, but ended up throwing everything away. My dog liked it, though.
