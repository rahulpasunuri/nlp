This has a very nice flavor and texture but I was concerned that uncooked bulgur would be too hard (not just crunchy) in the baked loaf. I only used 1 Tbl instead of 3 and was glad I did. I have used soaked bulgur in bread before, and it gives a very nice wheaty flavor. I'll use soaked bulgur from now on. Some reduction in the other liquid, or a little more flour may be necessary. (To soak bulgur, combine equal amts bulgur and boiling water. Let stand off of heat for 30 min.)

I make this bread a lot; we love it! It is wonderful toasted with butter and preserves. I don't change a thing except I use King Arthur white whole wheat for the whole wheat flour. It's a very healthy, fragrant loaf. I make two 8x4 loaves most of the time; the slices are a nice size. Makes 4 nice mini loaves at the holidays, too!

This bread was very dense and a little disappointing. My husband and I love ginger and the flavor was a little odd in the bread.

I adapted this idea to the whole-wheat bread recipe from Francis Moore Lappe's _Diet for a Small Planet_. This only requires the use of fresh milk, more whole wheat flour and eggs instead of buttermilk and white flour. The combination of crystallized ginger and whole wheat is ravishing. Makes fantastic toast.

I used all whole wheat flour, about 1 c whole wheat pastry flour and the rest regular whole wheat flour, and it turned out great!

This is one of the best breads I've ever eaten, and definately one of the best I've ever made--very more-ish!

Very good. I liked the sweet ginger crystals.

Maybe I didn't chop the ginger finely enough, but it gave the bread an icky, gingery-dishsoapy taste...next time I will leave out the ginger completely. Also, I used 2 1/2 cups whole wheat flour and only 3/4 all purpose, which gave it a nice texture and taste. So-so with the ginger, though

This was a favorite at our house, especially during cold winter holidays. I highly recommend it!

Wonderful! I dumped this into the bread machine yesterday, following the recipe as written, except that I only used whole grain unbleached white flour (no whole wheat left), and I doubled the ginger, as previously suggested, as my daughter and I love the flavor. It adapted perfectly to the machine (buttermilk, sugar, salt and melted butter in first, flour next, ginger and bulgur on top, and yeast last) and I'm enjoying it for breakfast as I write! Definitely a keeper.

This recipe makes a deliciously soft, sweet wheat bread. It's good with or without the crystallized ginger, and a perfect vehicle for jam.

This might be better if the amount of ginger were doubled.
