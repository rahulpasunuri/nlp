This was not my favorite recipe, to be honest. It improved with the addition of couscous, and I did puree a portion with a blending stick and returned it to the pot - but it turned an unappetizing color, and the flavor was just so-so. Not so rich or flavorful... though I used good paprika. I tried adding the vinegar and a little tomato paste, and also did cook with some red wine. Will not make again... sorry.

Garycook - What you will find in Germany and Austria as goulaschsuppe (goulash soup) is different than what is served in Hungary. It's usually much thicker and much more vegetable intensive than Hungarian versions. Please don't criticize the author as "not having a clue" as the author, indeed, has done their homework. I have minor quibbles with the recipe, and if you read down you will find my notes, but the recipe as given is certainly not laughable.

Overall the soup is delicious. After reading some of the other reviews and looking at other recipes, I added more vegetables than the recipe called for and also added a can of tomato paste as well as some red wine vinegar. I doubled the amount of caraway seeds, and also added considerably more paprika as well as a teaspoon of tabasco sauce. (If I could've found Hungarian Hot Paprika I would've used some of that.) Partially pureeing the soup made a big difference in the appearance and "thickness" of the soup. When I make it again, I will saute the garlic with the onions and caraway and add the paprika to the mixture before adding the beef. Also - I'll cut the vegetables a little smaller than the recipe calls for.

Guya (pro: gooyah) is a herd of cattle. Hungarian soups are light and watery. Not thick like stew. A couple of tricks. Don't put the Paprika in until (just before) adding the stock. You don't want to brown the paprika, after browning the meat, onions, toss the paprika and the browned ingediants together quickly and pour in the stock (or water). Then follow the rest of the directions. The herders didn't have a thickening method, so that is your choice. Originally, the herder would put the meat under his saddle as he rode along with his guya, it would cure the meat (like jerky). If he then had an outdoor pot hanging from a tripod with a fire under it he would throw in some of the dried meat, dig up roots, pour in water and whalla, a hot meal called Guyas. Pro:Gooyash. He wished he had some sour cream. (Goulash is the name outside of Hungary) You can use chicken too. Then it's Chicken Paprikas. Same directions. When it is 20 minutes from done, cube some russets and layer the top and cook till done. You may want to adjust the water to just cover the chicken (veggies; 1 parsnip, 1 bell pepper, some celery). Potatoes on top. A dollup of sour cream in your bowl. Hummmm

I write from Hungary and completely agree w/ pulykamell! Listen to his/her advice when you cook, if you wish to make authentic goulash! One addition however, most hungarian stews and/or soups were originally made outdoors over an open fire, in a large bowl called bogrács, if you have time, it's definitly worth a try.

We made this recipe and my wife laughed her head off. Whoever come up with this recipe hasn't got a clue about Hungarian Goulash Soup. My wife is a native German and we have spent 25 of the last 45 years in Europe. I 've never run across any soup like this that was called Goulash.

Judybb - The quality of your paprika is important to get the beautiful red goulash you're remembering. If your paprika is rusty or brown, so will your goulash. Try Pride of Szeged-brand sweet paprika. Also, make sure to add the paprika to the oil and onions, and be careful not to burn it. Paprika needs oil to flavor and color the dish properly. Adding paprika to water will just make the paprika float on the water.

HELP, please. My Mom was Hungarian, from Budapest. She died 30 years ago, and I have yet to create a goulash like hers. Mine is always brown, like stew. What's the secret to using paprika? I always add it, lots of paprika, but never comes out goulash...always just brown, mundane stew. Please help me. It was my favorite meal. Chicken Paprika too!

I loved this soup. I had cut the recipe out when it originally was printed--can't believe I waited 5 years to try it! And I'm glad I didn't go to the reviews first, as I usually do because I might have changed my mind. This made a hearty, layered, tasty soup on a rainy night--perfect! I did use about two pounds of meat, and extras on all the veggies. I was afraid it was going to be way too watery, but by the end of the cooking time and after throwing a few cups in the cuisinart, it was perfect. My advice--give it a try. Authentic or not, I bet you'll like it!

Rating: 3
Delicious and easy to make! When I make this soup I use close to 2 lb. of beef and the consistency is perfect. Goulash soup is served throughout Germany and Austria; it is not exactly the same as goulash, although the ingredients and spices are similar. Like many soups, home cooks prepare them using the ingredients they have on hand. Hence, the preoccupation with the authenticity of this recipe seems misplaced.

Spent several days in Budaoest and enjoyed Hungarian Goulash Soup so I tried this recipe six times. I have found that this soup requires the HOT paprika to duplicate the delicious soup I had in Hungary.

Halloween seemed the perfect time to try this much-reviewed and sadly-criticized recipe. I made this soup for my co-workers for "Soup Friday" and it was scrumptious! All 15 eaters raved about it and most wanted the recipe. I found it to be very flavorful and easy to prepare. I followed the recipe nearly exactly and even did the blending step, which I think was a nice touch but it would have been just as good without it. I did over double the recipe for 15, added lots of extra of the required veggies, plus added a turnip and a can of diced tomatoes. I will definitely make this again, and so will many of the other hungry Alaskan's who tipped their mugs to get the last drop! Who cares if it's authentic, it's delightful in any country!

After making this recipe 2 weeks ago, I decided that being from Texas, goulash is a Hungarian version of chili or vice versa. In Texas, every person has their own personal family recipe, and that's the only way to make chili. The bottom line is, make it to suit your personal taste. For me though, paprika is the basic flavor of goulash and cumin in the basic flavor of Texas chili. Remember, every recipe started with someone trying something different. So, experiment and have fun. That's what cooking is all about.

A couple more notes: There is definitely too much stock in this recipe. I checked my various Hungarian sources, and the consensus seems to be about 2-3 liters of water per kilogram of meat, or about a quart to a quart and a half a pound. It should be the consistency of a soup, not a stew, but it shouldn't be too watery. Otherwise the Cook from Clinton, MD, has all the right info (minus the cumin mixup).

Rating: 3
The basic recipe is not bad. The cook from MD (who is Hungarian), however is most definitely wrong about the caraway and cumin. Cumin is almost NEVER used in Hungarian cooking. In fact, I cannot think of a single indigenous dish that contains it. The confusion may lay in the name. Caraway seed in Hungarian is "kömény." Cumin is "rómaikömény." Cumin is the wrong flavor for traditional goulash and, up until a few years ago, was very difficult to even find in Budapest without scouring the Asian and Middle Eastern groceries. Gulyásleves is a simple dish, best prepared simply. One key is using the best sweet paprika your can find. Lard is tastier than oil, but Hungarians do use sunflower oil nowadays. Caraway is preferred, but optional. Most Hungarians I know do not use stock but rather water as their base. Beer has no place in traditional gulyásleves, but feel free to experiment. 1:2 onion to meat sounds about right. Onions are usually only cooked to translucency--not browned. The broth itself should look somewhat clear with a beautiful red sheen of paprika and oil toppping it. KEY POINT: Add the paprika to the oil & onions before adding water, but be careful not to burn it. Paprika needs oil to dissolve. If you add it later after all the water or broth is in your soup, it only sits there and floats on top of your soup without much flavoring. Make sure to use parsnips and carrots--they lend the soup a characteristic sweetness. Celery stalks are also very rarely used in Hungarian cooking--celery root (aka celeriac) is de rigeur, but using the stalks is OK in my book.

OK, I admit, I didn't make this or any of the other 4 goulash recipes on this website. I'm searching for new and good goulash recipe and reading comments by cooks and here is the problem: there is no way to incorporate your advice into the recipe because it's contradictory. When it comes to goulash obviously everybody has his/her own methods and they (the methods) are the only right ones. "Brown the onions until they are very dark", "cook the onions on low heat for an hour but don't let them brown"; "use 1/2 the amount of onions as meat", "use the same amount of onions as meat", "add beer not water", no, no "add beef broth"... Your advice is useless! And I'm frustrated. That's it! I'm cooking goulash the way my grandma (from Galicia - that's the Galicia in Austro-Hungary not in Spain) taught me. With whole hot finger peppers and water, lots of paprika and WHOLE caraway... And to spite you all I'm gonna eat it the same day I cook it. Ha!

I have made this recipe two times and like it very much. However, I agree with previous reviewers that it needs less stock, by two cups or more meat and vegetables. Great winter comfort food.

Well, I am from Hungary and I make goulash all the time and I can see why the rating is so low for this recipe... 1.Goulash (Gulyas) should be made with lard because it's the tastiest fat of them all. 2.Chopped onions should weight about half of the meat that you will use in the soup. So if you use 4lbs. of meat, (beef shin) use 2 lbs. of onions. This is what's gonna make it thick. 3.Often people confuse caraway seed and cumin seed. They are similar but not the same spices. In Goulash and stews, cumin seeds (ground) should be used. About half the amount of paprika. 4. Half of the spices should be added towards the end of cooking because during cooking some aroma is lost. 5.The meat should cook in it's own juices without the adition of any water until it's almost done. This will take about 2 hours. Only then the stock or water and vegetables be added to the soup. From this point it should take about 30 minutes to finish cooking. 6. No need for exotic spices. Only salt, ground black pepper, Hungarian paprika, ground cumin.

I'm not sure why the previous cook described this as bland. Between the caraway seeds, a good quality paprika and a zesty root veggie, I'm not sure how this could fail. I've made this several time now and every time it has turned out VERY well. Yes, I tinker with it a little and add whatever veggies I have on hand, but the basics are all there and it's been wonderful each time. Easy as pie and so tasty!

I was halfway through cooking this and thought I was going to have to throw it away. It was extremely bland and I used both hot and sweet paprika as well as added a cup of Merlot. There aren't enough veggies to give this much of a flavor and the cooking time isn't long enough to blend any flavors. This should be called beef broth with stew meat, flavored with Paprika. Now for the good news. Luckily I had a good part of the day to tinker with this recipe. I started adding lots more vegetables, kept simmering, and finally doctored it up with brown sugar, ketchup and Worchester sauce. I know, I changed the whole flavor, and believe me, it was for the better. I let it simmer for two hours longer than the recipe called for in order to mesh all of the flavors and soften the vegetables. A word of caution: The recipe says to put 3 1/2 cups of the soup into a blender. When I did this, the hot soup exploded out of the closed top of the blender and burnt my hand, not to mention splattering hot soup all over me. Blend 1 cup at a time. When all was said and done, it turned out great. Unfortunately, I had to change the entire recipe.

I more than tripled the amount of veggies and used 1 1/2 lbs of meat. The photo is misleading as using one potatoe divided among 6 people would give each person possibly one bite. The taste is excellent and this is incredibly easy. Definitely add LOTS more veggies though so that there is still something left after pureeing.

My grandmother used to make this when I was a child and she used about a 1/4 to 1/2 bottle of red wine (I do as well!) and very little beef or chicken broth. For those who like their food a little spicy, they using half hot and half sweet paprika.

I have made this recipe for the last two years on Halloween night (I call it "Ghoulash") and it is always a hit...And Seattle is so right- I have always made a few changes, like using more meat and veggies to make it more like a stew. However, the first year I added the sour cream and would not do that again...made it lose its deep color and was TOO thick for my liking. PS I have had goulash all over Hungary and this is very acceptable for an Americanized recipe.

I thought this was good - I ran out of beef broth and added vegetable broth. I let this sit overnight so the flavors blended, this also thickened the soup enough that I didn't have to puree - nice flavor, good fall meal. I would make it again.

Well I thought this soup was very tasty. I made it for my husband who is from Germany(apparently this dish is made all over Europe 100 different ways). He liked it, but thought it was really amusing. Apparently Goulash soup is what you make out of leftover Goulash. 2 different dishes. Yes he uses carraway seeds in his Goulash which is so thick a spoon would stand up in it.

Picky, picky, picky! To all those who complain about how this isn't authentic, or there's something wrong with it that makes it not really goulash, I would like to point out that this is a peasant dish. No two peasants make something like this the same way, and rarely make it the same way twice themselves. This is a great base recipe for what is generally called Hungarian Goulash. Just because the variations may not be what your Mom made, doesn't mean that someone else's Mom didn't make it this way. That doesn't mean this isn't authentic! This would be true of any peasant dish from any part of Europe.

The people @ Epicurious have butchered a wonderful recipe! 1. Don't use olive oil, use sunflower oil instead. 2. Don't sote the meat until "it's brown on both sides": 5-7 min at most! 3. Whatever you do, don't blend or add sour cream! You'll end up with smthg that ressembles goulash, but is not.

I tread carefully with this review, given the vehemenence with which some have attacked and others have defended it. It is too "brothy" for my taste, but more importantly, it has too strong a flavor of carraway for my palate. My previous experience with carraway seeds in goulash has shown them to be a weaker presence than in this recipe. Sorry folks but too much slice, dicing, peeling, chopping and simmering for the outcome.

This soup sounds like it is quite good tasting, although I have not made this goulash (gulyas) soup yet. I was born in Hungary (my mother was a fabulous cook and baker) and I have never heard of gulyas soup being pureed or eaten with sour cream. The peasant cooked the gulyas in a cauldren over an open fire, did not puree any of it and did not use sour cream. The thicker consistency was achieved with tons of vegetables, meat and over cooked potatoes that could be smashed. The soup, however, should not really have a thick consistency. This soup is best when eaten with old fashion heavy european bread (french and Italian breads are also very good with it). The porkolt which is eaten with dumplings, or as it is eaten in America, with noodles has a thick consistency to the sauce and is eaten with sour cream.

We just recently had the pleasure of trying this delicacy, but the recipe was provided by Mr. Tibor Saringer. His home recipe was a hit with us. We also found that he was right. Go easy on the ingredients. The list of ingredients was simply beef or pork(we chose pork), an onion, tomato, bell pepper, carrot, 2 potatos, caraway seeds, 2 types of paprika(hungarian)a hot one and a sweet one, and the optional pasta (lg elbow). Due to old roots in Mexico, we did use a spoonful of lard and that was basically it. What a meal! Nothing fancy, just cut everything into bite size cubes/chunks. Tomrrow we get to try it again, this time with out pasta. Mom always said "try it before you say that you don't like it". And just for the record, Mr. Saringer's home recipe FOUR SPOONS! You want to get every last drop!

Tibor and Andy are right on in their comments. Caraway Seed (Kömény) NOT Cumin (Romai Kõmény) is to be used in this dish, as the recipe says. I have never seen Hungarians use Cumin in any sort of recipe. It is an optional flavoring. As Tibor mentions, for the true Hungarian flavor, you should fry the onions in lard. Everything else in the recipe is right-on, though you wouldn't find Hungarians using green celery (they use the root.) And usually water is used instead of broth - the meat is expected to make its own.

No wonder everyone seems to be so emotional about this recipe, whoever concocted it only used ONE ONION! When everyone should know by now after watching Wolfgang Puck on FoodTV, that it should be half onions ,or almost, and half beef, and the other half paprika, well maybe it's a third. It must be the authentic one, he went to Austria to research it! I remember ordering Hungarian Gulyas SOUP in Salzburg and being served Goulash. Big difference in price as it turned out. It was a beautiful rusty red in color, and it was hot and delicious. I was hungry. But like every great dish, isn't it the individual differences that really make it great? And isn't it amazing and wonderful too, that so many people are interested and passionate about great food? Perhaps the best part is living in a country where there is so much available for us to be passionate about about.

I followed the advice of most of the people here and doubled the veggies. That and pureeing about half of it gave it a nice density. The only thing that turned me off a bit was the color. It was kind of murky looking...Once I got past that, it tasted delicious!

Seems pretty authentic, and I should know, I am Hungarian and been making this for years. And yes, caraway seeds do belong in goulash, wouldn't make it without it, however, skip the celery. Make sure you use authentic Hungarian paprika and not the spanish type. It is sold in most major supermarkets under the name "Pride of Szeged".

I thought this was a delicious one-dish meal. I did not have beef in the house and instead I used 1 & 3/4 lbs of veal stew meat and added a couple of beef bouillion cubes beyond the stock. I am extremely fat conscious so whenever I can substitute veal for beef, I do. Blending some of the soup helps to thicken without adding carbs which I think is a great idea. The flavor was superb, the consistency was terrific and with that I served a warm Italion bread. My husband and I were very satisfied and I will make it again. I also made another soup in Feb.Bon Appetit that was quite good. I guess Feb. is a good month for serving one dish soup meals in our household.

Good soup, basically. But one very serious error. One never uses caraway in a soup - with cabbage, breads and desserts, ok, but never in a soup. It's CUMIN seeds that absolutely must be used.

As a Hungarian, believe me, you MUST use Hungarian sweet/hot paprika ("edes csemege" if you can lay your hands on it) in this recipe.

Everyone should take this for what it is worth, a quick soup that can be made on a weeknight that the whole family will like. I did substitute half chicken broth because I am wary of all that MSG in beef broth and I eliminated caraway because I don't care for it. BUT maybe if you call it Hungarian Goulash FLAVORED Soup, some of you might be more forgiving. Also, it is imperative that you use really good paprika. The paprika will make or break this dish.

I do not know what people are whining about. And to complain about authenticity. Come on folks! There is NO one hungarian gulash. Hungarian gulash is basically a stew that was eaten by Hungarians, much like Irish Stew. The recipe given is kept simple and not too strong in taste. The reason why Caraway seeds are used is because traditionally it is hard to get the authentic hungarian spices. I have no problem because I drive there to get them. The key in "real" gulash is to focus on the paprika and pepper. When from Hungary these spices add a strong and pungent taste.

Rating: 0
A lovely dish albeit it has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with a gulash. Gulash is onions sauteed in fat (oil is OK), a fair bit of HUNGARIAN paprika, stewing beef and water or stock. Sliced green peppers may be sauteed along the onions and maybe a bit of tomato. Preferably meat from different cuts of the beef; gristle is nice, gives the soup a good consistency. Wine Frenchifies it and caraway seeds show a Viennese influence. BTW "gulyás" means cowboy in Hungarian, essentially. Withal, this is a pleasant beef stew - a gulyash it ain't !
