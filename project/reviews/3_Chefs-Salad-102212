The dressing makes a fantastic marinade for grilled chicken breasts, which are a pretty tasty addition to the salad.

This is a great salad. Don't let any of the negative reviews deter you from trying it. In the forward to the recipe, it is described as a "twist" on a chef salad, so I don't have a problem with the fact that it is different. The dressing is amazing. Just use the dressing as a base and adapt the recipe to your liking. I added some other vegetables (chopped yellow pepper and cucumber) and left out the ham. I also put some hard-boiled eggs on the side. You can call this whatever you want, but it's a wonderful main dish salad!

This is a Chef's Salad only insofar as a Chef may have created it. I have had delicious Chef's Salads that don't remotely resemble the experience mentioned in the Forward to this recipe. As or the recipe, if you served this as a "Chef's Salad" here in nyc, you would be laughed out of the restaurant business. This is one of the very few recipes on this website that I really disliked.

I made this salad for a taco dinner party. It was a big hit -- it was light (a nice contrast to the tacos) and full of good stuff. People loved the dressing. I left out the ham for the vegetarians.

I'm sorry that the writer of this has experienced lifeless lettuce, blue-hued eggs and rubbery turkey, but the above is not a chef's salad.
