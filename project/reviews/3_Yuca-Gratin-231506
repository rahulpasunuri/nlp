"And Cook from NH, how about actually trying something before writing a negative review?" WORD! This recipe is quite good . . . I added some hot sauce and lime and it was very tasty.

It's pretty good, added more fresh garlic and 2 tablespoons of red wine vinegar. Served it with pork chops, Hmm! You can find frozen Yucca in the Goya frozen section in the supermarket. It comes in a bag.
