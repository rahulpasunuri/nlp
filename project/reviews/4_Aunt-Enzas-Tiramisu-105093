Delicious, fluffy, simple recipe. Add 2x teaspoons to instant espresso + water then 1.5 TB Kahlua to enhance coffee flavor. As is, this recipe is creamy without much tooth. Adjust booze and ladyfingers up to add alcohol kick & a degree of chew. It's a creamy light trifle as written. Very good but not superb.

This was a great recipe. Very easy to pull off for a first timer. I did sprinkle a light layer of shaved 85% dark chocolate in between layer, because of my love for chocolate, and added two tablespoons of Kahlua to my freshly brewed espresso. Please don't skip on the Marsala either. Everyone loved this!

Mmmmmm! Delicious. Use pasteurized eggs to quell paranoia; personally, I prefer Kahlua to Marsala and strong coffee to nasty instant espresso (don't even know how to turn the espresso maker on... :) We prefer goopier tiramisu, so using 1 1/2 3 oz packages of soft lady fingers and dunking them briefly in coffee, not brushing, gives us the texture we like. If you prefer a more cakey dessert, brush or spray the coffee on and use plenty of ladyfingers. I also tend to grate a little chocolate between the layers, but that's awfully greedy. Enjoy.

Excellent recipe! Served on New Year's Eve for a very Italian family. This group said it was the best Tiramisu they ever tasted! Came out great the 1st time I made it. I grated bittersweet chocolate over the 1st 2 marscapone layers then dusted final layer with cinnamon. I did not dunk the soft ladyfingers. Instead I layered the ladyfingers and then used a squeeze bottle to apply the espresso mixture - fast, easy and a lot cleaner! I also did not have Marsala on hand so found a substitute on the internet - 2 Tbsp dry white wine and 1/2 tsp brandy. I also double the recipe and used a 13" x 9" pan. Great Recipe!

First time making tiramisu -- this recipe was very easy. Dinner guests requested seconds.

Rating: 4
Very easy to make as long as the mascarpone is room temp. Very "European" tasting, not as sweet as most American desserts. But if it isn't eaten in two days, the texture of the filling reverts to something very close to the original mascarpone. It looses the lightness of the whipped egg white and gets kinda heavy. Serve it only when you have enough people to make a major dent in it the first day. Leftovers suffer.

I tried making this before which was really sucessful and tasty. Second time, the egg yolk custard becomes lumpy after i mix in the mascaphone. Anyone knows what happened?

This is my "go to" recipe for Tiramisu. Please, do not omit the Marsala. You won't be disappointed. I have to admit that I did double up on the espresso for dipping and had to use the hard, crusty ladyfingers since there isn't a store within 100 miles that carries soft ones. A very quick dip of the custy lady fingers is all that's required or they will dissolve immediately.

i have had tiramisu many times and this is one of the best! i did have to improvise a bit...i used a homemade coffee-liqueur recipe instead of marsala and double brewed, extra strong coffee. i couldnt find ladyfingers, so i used pound cake. i also sprinkled dark chocolate chips and crumbled oreos on top of every creamy layer. its delicious!

This recipe is incredibly delicious and very easy to make (I am not too skilled in the kitchen). I agree with other's recommendations to double the mascarpone portion and I would definitely substitute Kaluhua for the Marsala.

I've used the original recipe and it was a hit. I once had to serve 14 guests so I modified it: I became the Tiramisu Goddess. Double the mascarpone Double the sugar Use 8 egg whites and egg 8 yolks Use as many ladyfingers as you need for 3 layers and make about twice the amount of coffee Use 3 tablespoons of Kahlua plus 1 tbsp Frangelico unsweetened cocoa for garnish Amazingly good.

This was such an easy recipe but tastes like an expensive dessert from any Italian bakery! It is straight up deeee- licious if you love tiramisu. Do use the Kahlua. I actually needed 2 and 1/2 of cookies to make a 8x11 casserole dish. Make this again and again to impress your friends!

After reading a number of the reviews, I decided to make this as close to the recipe as possible, which is hard for my nature! The only changes were adding a bit of marsala to the espresso, and doubling the mascarpone (it's the best part). The result was delicious... Even my friend who is SUPER particular about tiramisu was swooning over it. This is the real deal, folks, not that you can't fancy- up a tiramisu, but this is just simple, delicious goodness! Oh, but I wasn't that impressed with the picket fence thing. and probably won't bother with that again.

I made a few alterations (many borrowed from previous reviews) to this recipe. I made 2 cups of espresso coffee, but didn't use all of it. I also used Kahlua instead of Marsala and added some extra Kahlua to the espresso. I used a little more than 1 7-ounce package of lady fingers. Also, I added a layer of chocolate chips instead of the unsweetened cocoa/bittersweet chocolate. I brushed the lady fingers with the espresso/Kahlua instead of dipping them, because dipping them practically dissolved them. However, I was able to use the half- dissolved cookies when I needed to fill in spaces in the lady fingers layer in my circular dish. Finally, I put some chocolate-covered espresso beans, along with chocolate chips (spelling out "DAD" for father's day) on the top layer. This recipe was extremely easy to make and tasted great!

I don't like my tiramisu very soggy, so this was a perfect recipe!! We loved it! The cream is delicious (didn't use the marsala). Used the hard ladyfingers, they softened up after the coffee dip and refrigeration. Delicious!

WOW! This coming from someone who never even LIKED Tiramisu until this recipe! A big thank you to all the reviewers who made this happen for me... especially Linetta (reviewed 07/21/03) with her brainwave to arrange the Ladyfingers around the Tiramisu as it made a stunning presentation for my Christmas dessert! I found that the Espresso-Kahlua mix tasted best but I used far less than the recipe called for, following recommendations to lightly brush the fingers. I also used a combination of Mascarpone and Ricotta with a high- fat/cream percentage as it was tastier. (Available in Canada as the President's Choice brand.) Don't you just love Epicurious?! :)

I made this recipe a few years ago, and I'm making it again for Mother's Day. I bought too much espresso, so rather than wasting it, I strained out the ladyfinger crumbs and used it to make a simple espresso syrup that I served over the tiramisu. It was fantastic. I plan on buying enough espresso for syrup next time.

this tiramisu is fabulous. the recipe is simple and straightforward, w/ few ingredients. A few things i've learned from making it a few times, though: the more espresso, the better- i use ~12 oz freshly brewed espresso (nice to know someone w/ an espresso machine), and you will definitely need more lady fingers. i buy whatever relevant cookies i can find, but i've had great luck w/ the 'Stella Dora' italian cookies that can be found in most grocery stores. They're cheap and have a slight anise flavor, which enhances the flavor of the whole tiramisu. they also hold up well to the dipping in espresso. i usually use 2 packages of these cookies- much more than the 4 oz. in the recipes. nevertheless, i have always succeeded w/ this recipe (the 'best tiramisu i've ever had', according to a friend) and would recommend it to anyone as a great starting tiramisu recipe.

Love this recipe. I've made it several times, substituting Kahlua for Marsala. A couple of observations that might be helpful if you're making it for the first time: 1) Not being an espresso drinker, I bought Ferraro's granulated espresso. It was disgusting--really bitter--so I went back to my previous method of brewing some really strong coffee instead. Blew $5, though! 2) I use pasteurized eggs for this recipe, not wanting to see my guests laid out end to end with salmonella. But it takes a LONG time to whip pasteurized egg whites. Allow for it, and go have a cup of coffee. 3) Marscapone cheese is horrifyingly expensive, so when I saw some at the store that was close to the expiration date for $1 each, I checked you can freeze it and bought the lot. The Belgioioso brand came out of the freezer as if it had never been frozen. The Il Villaggio had separated, and, having read that it just needed to be re-blended, I did that--only it didn't really help and the goop was curdled looking. Panic time! However, after 24 hours in the fridge the tiramisu came out fine. (Needn't have bought that carrot cake after all!) However, I'll pick my brands next time I see it on sale to freeze, and for a really special occasion, I wouldn't risk using frozen.

I made this the other day.. and despite needing at least another cup of coffee... and more lady fingers than the recipe suggested... it was fantastic! I probably dipped the fingers too long... but it still turned out great... and it was incredibly easy... Oh and I used the hard lady fingers....

I made this for dessert at Christmas to follow a prime rib dinner (also from epicuriuos.com -- Prime Rib Roast with Red Wine Sauce).

Used shots of Starbucks espresso and maybe that's why it was overpowering and the bottom was a bitter puddle. I'm currently trying to redeem myself by tipping the pan at a weird angle in the fridge. Seems to be draining nicely. Delicious nonetheless. Loved the marsala and used more than suggested.

FABULOUS, I make this as my 'signature' disk where ever I go now, and it's is loved everywhere. I've also altered this recipe for those who don't like coffee, using boysenberry syrup instead of coffee and stewwed boysenberries between layers of sponge fingers and creamy mixture... then a thick layer of crushed ginger nut biscuits on the top instead of chocolate... it's a huge hit too.

This is wonderful tiramisu! I followed the recipe exactly, except for using extra ladyfingers (hard; I could not find soft) to make the three layers. I was a bit concerned when I first tasted the mascarpone mix because the marsala really seemed to dominate, but after it had been assembled with the ladyfingers, cocoa, etc., and chilled overnight, it was perfect! The only problem I had with this recipe is that I made waaaaay too much! I made this for Easter, and since there were going to be about 20 guests, I tripled the recipe. It filled a 15x10 glass baking dish to the very top. Since we had eaten a big meal and there were other desserts to try, people took small servings and there was more than half left. They raved about it, but it is quite rich and one can only eat so much! Just be aware, if you decide to triple this, you will get an industrial sized vat of tiramisu! Next time, I will double this for a big group and it should be plenty! Again, this is excellent tiramisu. I will definitely keep this recipe!

good,easy recipel I used one package (3oz) ladyfingers and all of the custard in a 1.5 quart round container. When I make it again, I will decrease marsala to 1-1.5 tbs.--2 is a bit overpowering. I also may cut back on the sugar a little bit. otherwise, a great recipe.

Excellent tiramisu. Highly recommend the picket fence method discussed by a reviewer in 2003. It really makes it look gourmet! However, beware you need at least 3 boxes (5 oz each) of lady fingers if you are going to do this. I wasn't warned and had a last minute dash to the store. Did a mix between Kahlua and Bailey's instead of Marsala. Great hit with guests!

I first have to say that I do NOT cook (well I may cook a meal 2-3 times a year). This recipe is soooo easy to follow and soooo easy to make!! I followed all the ingredients listed in this recipe, the only variations I made were that instead of dipping lady fingers into espresso coffee, I merely brush the espresso onto both sides of the soft lady fingers & I also tripled the measurements as to make enough for 19 servings. I made this recipe to give as individual holiday gifts for my co-workers; so I put the tiramisu into individual martini glasses instead of one serving dish. I honestly could not believe that ALL 19 co-workers raved about how GREAT this dessert tasted. I was so proud!! All other times I have made this dessert, I have made it in a serving dish.

I've made this twice and my husband (who eats tiramisu everywhere he can find it) says it's better than any he has eaten. I substituted Kahlua for the Marsala wine and used hard lady fingers (I used the whole package). I also prefer to make this in a square dish so that the slices come out nicely.

I have made this recipe three times, each with great success! As pointed out by other reviewers, it's a very flexible recipe, but I have to be honest -- the last time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly, and it was absolutely phenomenal. The first two times, I substituted cream cheese and heavy cream for part of the mascarpone, as well as sherry for the marsala. The result was delicious, but now that I have made the tiramisu exactly by the recipe, I won't be making any more changes. I can't imagine a tastier dessert! (I used the soft ladyfingers all three times, and I have found that they work best when moistened but not soaked.) Probably the best dessert I have ever had!

Yummy. Better than what I can find in the local italian restaurants. Made it as written, except used more lady fingers. I've made it with both hard and soft fingers, and find the hard ones work better and you can soak up more of the liquid that way, too.

I've now made this twice... each time to rave reviews! Both a good friend and my picky husband, two excellent cooks, declared this one of THE very best desserts ever! I had to substitute a mixture of cream cheese and heavy cream since I can't always get mascarpone locally, used kahlua the first time and marsala the second, used soft and crispy ladyfingers (soaked the crispy ones and brushed the soft ones); served in a lovely trifle bowl and individual ramekins... in other words, it's a very forgiving and flexible recipe which turns out delicious each time. I've planned a dinner party again just so I can make the recipe as suggested in a springform pan with the ladyfingers upright in the picket fence style. And the best feature of this recipe is that it must be made in advance... perfect! Definitely a keeper!

Yum!!! Perfect tiramisu! Definitely use more ladyfingers than it calls for, because 4 oz. is NOT enough!

Rating: 4
This was splended. First, I want to address the fact that I used 14 oz. ladyfingers, and I think that the 4 oz. specified in the recipe is a typographical error. I followed the lead of the reviewer who suggested cutting 3/4" off of the ends of ladyfingers to line the sides of a 9" springform pan. (They will extend about 3/4" above the top edge of the pan.) I have made tiramisu in the past this way, and the presentation is beautiful. Be sure not to get these perimeter pieces too soggy, or the dessert will not hold its shape when removed from the pan. If you happen to be in a place where mascarpone cheese is not readily available, I have tried a lot of substitutes, and this is the best: 2 cups ricotta cheese, 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sour cream, 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons cream cheese, 3 tablespoons whipping cream. Process in blender or food processor until completely smooth. It's not exactly the same, but it's much closer than any other imitations I've tried. Enjoy!

Rating: 4
This is really wonderful. I made the recipe as directed, but I did have 2 4-ounce packages of ladyfingers on hand and I had to use both. I would recommend that you use espresso as opposed to strong coffee. Coffee does not have the "body" necessary to "hold" the fingers. I used coffee and the result was excess liquid, but after I poured it away...bliss!

THis was a stunning Christmas Eve dessert. I used decaffeinated espresso so we'd get some sleep and followed the picket fence suggestion for the lady fingers, but in a tiramisu bowl. Made it very beautiful and gave good support. Also used the hard lady fingers and they held up very well.

I made this for Christmas Dinner 2004. The family and significant others LOVED it! I used ladyfingers from Trader Joe's, used strong coffee mixed with some Kahlua, along with adding some Kahula to the cheese mixture, and put cocoa and grated chocolate between layers and on top. I dipped the ladyfingers in the coffee/Kahlua for about 5 seconds. I think those were the only adjustments that I made... I actually made this two days ahead and put in the freezer overnight because of a two hour car ride to our destination. Kept it in the fridge once we arrived and it was wonderful the next day!

Great recipe! Would make again in a heartbeat! Beware of the amount of time it takes to brew the espresso especially in my case since I tripled the recipe to accomodate for my huge family. It took me over an hour to make this, which was longer than what I expected. Shorted myself on the marscapone by accident so I used heavy whipped cream to accomodate for the volume. I suggest a clear bowl like a triffle dish, it really displays the layering affect if you decide to do the picket fence display. Added a little kaluha to the espresso.

Tripled the recipe to accomodate my large family and accidently shorted myself on the marscapone cheese. So I added the rest in fresh whipped heavy cream to accomodate the volume needed for layering. Also added 1/4 c. kaluha to the espresso. It came out perfect. Beautiful presentation! Too bad you can't upload pictures, I took a few to show a friend. One thing I wish was listed on the recipe is how long it took me to brew all that espresso, plan for that if your shedule is tight.

Delicious and lighter than most, and the pickett fence presentation was impressive indeed. Made 1.5x the recipe to fit 8" springform, cooked the eggs w/sugar over dbl-boiler, added frangelico to espresso and generously to marscarpone mixture, shredded callebut choc. b/w layers, and put it in the freezer for 2 hours, then left in fridge during dinner. sliced perfectly, fed 9 of us, no leftovers. future mom-in-law admitted she loved it, despite a dislike for tiramisu--AMAZING!

I have been making THIS recipe for over a year now and everyone ALWAYS asks for the recipe after sampling it - it is THAT GOOD! The picket fence presentation is beautiful. The cocoa powder is a must (I put it in my sifter and cover the surface of each layer)for flavor as well as for esthetics. The other MUST is a layer of shaved semi-sweet chocolate to coat the TOP of the tiramisu. Not only is the presentation GORGEOUS - the taste is divine - there are NEVER any left overs - everyone is looking for more! Tasty, simple and easy - the best combination.l

This is the best Tiramisu's I've ever tasted, the first I've ever made and it was so simple. I used the crispy type of lady fingers, and didn't have Marsala, so I substituted Cream Sherry and I didn't have enough of the filling to finish the top layer, so I finished it with softly whipped cream, dusted it with the cocoa and it was perfect. Word of warning though, we discovered that we can't eat it as dessert after 8 p.m., unless I make it with de-caf espresso. It was worth a sleep deprived night.

I made this for a group of friends on our last night on vacation at a Tuscan villa.

I've been making tiramisu for years and I tried this recipe out one day when I realized that I couldn't find the cookbook with my regular tiramisu recipe. It was a huge hit - the best tiramisu recipe I've found! I'll never bother with another recipe - I doubt that this one could be improved upon. The only difference for me is that I have always preferred Frangelico to Marsala in my Tiramisu. I add it to the espresso and leave out the marsala altogether. I also prefer hard savoiardi.

This is a repeat request - people rave. I've used Marsala and Kahlua, both with good response. Most recently I used the "picket fence" design mentioned below in a springform and the presentation is fantastic. I had to triple the recipe (a lot left over) to get enough volume for the pan though (try ordering 10 shots at Starbucks!). I'm always worried about soaking the ladyfingers too much, so I brush on the espresso - but this time I didn't do enough, so there's a fine balance there. Big bang for the effort!

This is one of the best tiramisu recipes out there. The flavors are very much like the ones you get at the best cafes in Italy. There is not enough filling here, so I would make extra. Also, the dipping of the ladyfingers is crucial. Aim for the whole ladyfinger (both sides) to be slightly moist- not soaked, and no large areas of dry spot. Depending on your brand of ladyfingers, this should translate to 2-3 seconds for both sides. And do not skip on the cocoa powder. I made this once with and once without it, and the cocoa powder is the final touch that really rounds out the flavors fabulously.

Rating: 3
I have tried many tiramisu dishes in the past, and this one is by far the best. I did come up a little short on the filling though, so I added a little bit more marscapone--this also thickens the filling to a nice consistency. Once the entire thing is done, i like to just dust the top with some simple cocoa powder.

I made this once before and I thought it was very good. Then I ate it the next day and realized how marvelous it is. Very, very simple, presents well and to me it is like the 'rice krispie' commercial; it looks like you spent all day in the kitchen when really it is oh so simple!!!

This is absolutely the best recipe I've ever gotten off this site. I served it for Xmas dinner and everyone loved it. Will definitely make it again. My store(s) did not have ladyfingers so I used pound cake sliced very thin. Worked perfectly. I also used Khalua instead of the Marsala, and very strong coffee instead of the espresso.

Have tried many tiramisu's in past and after this one, I can't order it in a restaurant again, as I am invariably disappointed by how bland they are compared to this recipe. Marsala is a must, as it is the perfect match with the mascarpone - they are meant to be together (used an extra tblsp in the cheese). Can't imagine using grand marnier or rum. Made once with kahlua added to espresso and once without - not really needed. Made with raw eggs the night before - no health concerns if you use very fresh eggs and throw out leftovers (tho I haven't had any so far) after 48hs, took about 3-4 minutes to beat yolks till pale yellow and thick. Recipe calls for 4 oz ladyfingers (one reviewer thought this was a typo and used 14 oz). 10 oz is just right. Used the hard ones found in Italian grocery, dipped lightly and no problem with them falling apart. This is our new standard dessert, and met with raves all-round at Christmas.

I make Jacque Torres's Tiramisu from "Dessert Circus", but on a whim - and pressed for time - chose this one. I used Grand Marnier in lieu of Marsala, fresh baked poundcake for the ladyfingers, and 8oz marscapone/4oz cream cheese for the total marscapone. Suprisingly, very good. Definately a keeper for a last minute dessert

Rating: 3
This recipe is a good starting point, but I've made a few adjustments. First, "soaking" the ladyfingers made it way too wet, so the second time a made it I brushed them (heavily) with a combo of espresso and kahlua and it was better. I also think you need a lot more ladyfingers than the recipe calls for. I used three packages. BUT I am making it for a Thanksgiving dessert. Everyone loves it!

Rating: 4
This is about as traditional as a tiramisu recipe gets. I did exactly as written, with the picket fence design (below) - beautiful. I prefer using marsala to the Kahlua - I think the flavor pairs perfectly with the mascarpone. However, I tried the recommendation of beating the yolks for 5-6 minutes with disastrous results. The yolks got too aerated and caused the added mascarpone to become irreversibly grainy. I had to chuck it and start with new cheese - a $12.00 mistake.

This was very yummy. My boyfriend didn't think it tasted like any tiramisu he'd ever had at a restaurant, but that said, he ate almost the entire thing. I don't know what would make it taste more tiramisu-like, but it's so easy and quick, I'd be willing to make it a few more times and fool around with it. I think that part of the problem might have been that I only made 2 layers of ladyfingers and filling. Next time I'll get more lf's and be sure to make 3 layers, that will probably change the consistency. Much creamier the next day. I used Kahlua and next time I will make stronger coffee (don't have an espresso machine and I'm sure it makes a difference) and use coffee flavored Mascarpone cheese from Trader Joe's. I made this late last night, so had to make do with ingredients from Safeway.

They hold together well and really absorb the flavors. Also prefer to use 1 1/2 tbls. Khalua and 1/2 tbls. Bailey's Irish Cream, as another reviewer suggested for a creamy taste.

5 FORKS! Delicious, easy to make - and every bite magically disappeared. Used a 9" spring form pan and 3 packages soft ladyfingers. Used Kahlua instead of Marsala. Beat egg yolks 4-5 minutes to achieve pale yellow thickness desired, & beat whites to form FIRM peaks. DISCARD the third egg white (I microwaved it for the dog)and finished product will not be runny. I Added 2T Kahlua to espresso. I separated all ladyfingers like oreos - halved. Cut 3/4 inch off base of 2 1/2 ROWS of cookies. These resembled "PICKET FENCES". Carefully lined ALL AROUND side wall of pan with "picket fences" PRETTY SIDE facing wall of pan - with trimmed off portion on base of pan. The finished presentation was GORGEOUS! Next, lined bottom of pan with as many separated strips of cookies and pieces as it took to completely cover in a SINGLE layer. (Trimmed pieces filled in spaces!) 1. Brushed espresso/Kahlua mixture over base cookies. 2. LIGHTLY brushed side cookies ( You DO NOT WANT THESE cookies TO BREAK or TOPPLE) approximately 1 inch higher than base. 3. Dusted coca over BASE cookies. 4. Covered with 1/3 mascarpone mixture. REPEATED steps until complete - did not brush espresso along TOP inch of "picket fence" cookies. Dusted top of mascarpone layer with cocoa. Used a potato peeler to shave chocolate over entire top. REFRIGERATED OVERNIGHT. The picket fence "sides" looked fabulous - just be sure to LIGHTLTY brush or spray as too much added will make the sides unstable and they will collapse when you remove the side of the spring form pan. If you like TIRAMISU this is the recipe to try - again and again. PERFECTION!

I made this for a lunch party and it was a great hit! My grandmother said it was better than the tiramisu she gets at an Italian bakery near her house in Milwaukee. I used Kaluha instead of marsala because I didn't have any marsala in the house. This is the first tiramisu that turned out edible. I have tried 4 other recipes from other sources and they either turn out too eggy, grainy, or the coffee is too strong. This one is perfectly balanced. Don't worry about the eggs, it was gone before it had a chance to sit out and get nasty.

I hate giving 3 forks, because this is definitely the best recipe for Tiramisu I have ever made/found. My only issue with this recipe is that there seems always to be a problem with the ratio of egg yolks to meringue, occasionally creating a lumpy or hard filling, or there are too many or not enough lady fingers. After a lot of tweaking, I recommend blending the yolks and mascarpone VERY well, and use meringue sparingly (I like to get the mascarpone to room temperature for more consistent blending). Definitely err on the side of less lady fingers than filling. And Marsala is still my favorite booze for this recipe--it's unpretentious, subtle, and not too sweet. Don't mess with those heavy cream or cream cheese recipes; this is the real thing!

So easy and so yummy! We just returned from a 2 week vacation in Italy and this recipe took us right back! I didn't add the Marsala and my guests and I didn't seem to miss it. I didn't have espresso so I brewed a super strong pot of coffee. Ahhh- prego! Thank you for the reviews.

Rating: 4
Sublime! I brought this to work and received rave reviews from all. I used hard lady fingers as that was what was available, and brewed real strong coffee instead of espresso. Since I used hard lady fingers, I dunked them quickly instead of brushing or spraying on the coffee. This worked perfectly to soften them and they were not soggy at all. I refrigerated this overnight. A wonderful recipe, I will use it again and again!

I made this recipe the first time to bring to a dinner party 2 weeks ago. It was a HUGE hit. I made it again for one of my friends from Italy and she thought it was great also. I plan to make it again this weekend. The first time I made it I didn't whip the egg whites enough. The texture was very soft. Also, instead of Marsala I use 1 1/2 T of Khalua and 1/2 T Bailey's. The Bailey's makes it taste very creamy.

Yummy. I have never made tiramisu before and was surprised at how easy it was to make (how can they charge so much for it in the restaurants?). I took one person's suggestion of spraying the espresso mix on the lady fingers. That worked well..my only fault was that I only sprayed one side when I should have sprayed both sides. I also used Kahlua and pasturized eggs. Remember that it takes MUCH longer to whip these eggs but you don't have to worry about getting sick from the raw eggs. Let this sit overnight for max taste. I can't wait to make this again.

Wonderful basic recipe and so quick to make. I used the lady fingers but instead of dipping them, placed them in the dish first and poured the espresso over them. I also added some Tia Maria over the lady fingers giving it that alcohol taste. For the filling, I really recommend adding some Vin Sarto..very authentic taste! I also agree with Lisa who said it is always better the next day! Enjoy!

I haven't made this recipe yet, but looking forward to it! I have made a number of Tirimisu recipes before, and the one thing I've learned is to brush the coffee/liqueur mixture over the cake as opposed to dipping. The mixture is evenly absorbed, and chances of the cake getting soggy is nil. I used ladyfingers my first try, and they were hard to handle (messy and soggy). I now use a white genoise cake recipe in substitute of ladyfingers, slicing each layer into half (using only 3 layers) and toasting each layer in the oven before "soaking" up the coffee/liqueur. I also whisk the egg mixture over a low heat double broiler until they reach a temp of 160. I have also found that making the tirimisu at least a day in advance does a considerable amount for the flavor. It is SO much better! The texture is creamier (not soggy!) and the flavors are much stronger...just perfectly wonderful! If it's necessary to "freeze" in order to chill in time for serving, beware not to chill too long as actual freezing can destroy the texture of the cream filling. I strongly recommend making any tirimisu the day before at least, and then you don't have to worry about the freeze factor!:)

Simple, quick to make & delicious. I served it at a dinner party and & my guests all loved it. I had to use biscuit type ladyfingers as soft ones are not available in Prague but dipped them in the coffee & they were fine. My only disappointment was my fault as my espresso was not strong enough. I used martini glasses which gave it a more elegant appearance. You could easily change the liquor as other cooks suggested making this a versatile dessert. Definitely recommended.

Better than sex. Just made it for the third time and it is GOOD. Even a friend who "doesn't like Tiramisu" had second helpings. I used more lady fingers this time, though, and definitely preferred it with less - gloopy is good in my opinion! I use pasteurized eggs and Kahlua rather than marsala. If you like Tiramisu you won;t be disappointed.

This recipe was great! I used kahlua in the espresso and Gran Marnier in the cream as some suggested. I think next time I'll just use liquer in the cream. Don't use too many ladyfingers! It takes away from the cream.

Rating: 3
not a bad recipe....just a couple of tips though. Grand Marnier works well as does Amaretto or Chambord. Forget dunking or brushing the lady fingers....get a spray bottle and you get a nice even coat with minimal effort.

Made this for an Italian theme dinner party last night and it drew rave reviews. I left out the Marsala because I didn't have any (quite a shock - mum must have been at the cooking wine again!), but think I'll experiment with Grand Marnier & others to make it interesting. I did brush Kahlua (I used it in place of the espresso) on the lady fingers, and apparently brushed them on the wrong side, as they were too dry, so will remedy that next time. This would have been a 4-forker with the Marsala, I think, and it definitely rates 6 forks for ease of preparation. A very definite keeper.

Rating: 4
this receipe is just about perfect - i made for a friend's bday dinner dessert instead of a cake and this was a SMASH HIT! the only thing i would recommend is to BRUSH the coffee mixture (i added some kahula to mine like another reviewer suggested) instead of dunking the ladyfingers - i would also suggest that you don't have to use marsala - i didn't have any and used cream de cassis and it was just wonderful!

I just made this dish last night (New Year's Eve)and first of all, the recipe makes a perfect amount for 6...no deadly leftovers to test my new year's resolutions! It had the perfect consistency and taste...high praise from a very tough tiramisu critic! I would recommend though, mixing in kahlua with the espresso to add that extra little kick. Also, using the hard lady fingers is fine- just roll them around in the mixture and you'll be just fine. In fact, I would recommend using more lady fingers than the recipe calls for...but that's all I can add. A definite hit for a tough crowd!

I am a Tiramisu fanatic and this is my favorite recipe. Tastes just like the tiramisu from fine Italian restaurants. Made it for 15 people on Christmas day and it was gobbled up! I did double the recipe. This recipe generates too much marscapone mixture, so and I added more lady fingers and I still had unused marscapone mixture. Used soft lady fingers, a pastry brush to apply expresso, didn't bother cooking egg mixture, used grated scharfenberger chocolate + unsweetened cocoa in between layers, put it in a trifle bowl and topped with berries. Fantastico!

I had my first Tiramisu at Laudisio in Boulder, CO many years ago and haven't had it as good since, so I decided to make it myself. After researching other recipes, this one seemed the most authentic. Besides substituting the Marsala with Grand Marnier, I followed this recipe to the letter. Consistency and texture were picture-perfect. And the orange flavor was very subtle - nice with the cafe/chocolate flavor.

This is easy and excellent. I made for a family birthday with 13 guests and all raved about how delicious. Since I didn't have Marsala I used Baily's Irish Creme - added 4 tbsp to the egg yolk mixture and also added it to the espresso. So the ladyfingers were dipped in a mixture that was 1/2 coffee 1/2 Baily's. It was awesome. I made 2 1/2 times the recipe which was too much. I also used an addition of 1/2 c creme cheese since I was not going to have enough mascapone. Amazingly delicious. Unfortunately I ate all the leftovers......

I should have reread the reviews. I used hard lady fingers and let them soak too long. The flavors were great, but the presentation was soggy.

Rating: 3
This was delicious. I went to my local Italian grocer and bought "hard" packaged "Balocco, Savoiardi" Lady Fingers, which seemed to soak up way too much of the espresso, requiring me to use twice as much espresso as called for (which overpowered the recipe). Next time I will use the same Lady Fingers, but follow another's advise and use a pastry brush to lightly brush both sides with the espresso. A few tweaks, & in my opinion this Tiramisu will be out of this world! (Also, after adding the sugar and beating the egg yolks until pale yellow, just to be on the safe side I cooked the mixture for a short time under a double boiler.)

The recipe was fantastic. This is by far the best recipe i have ever made. One thing though guys.. be careful when dipping the lady fingers in the expresso. JUST VERY SLIGHTLY.. dont' let it get soggy it will ruin the whole thing. I didnt' let it get soggy,It wasn't dry at all, because I let it stay over night. And I am still here, so no egg poisoning!!!!!! Dont' worry about the eggs, just make sure they are fresh. I got mine 2 hours before imade the cake. Cheers, and enjoy the cake!

This was so easy. I used a few shots of Starbucks espresso since I don't have an espresso machine. It tastes better if you let it set overnight in the refrigerator. Next time I might try adding a dash of Kahlua to the espresso.

I have made this several times and I like it becuase it's authentic, except I use Tia Maria and sometimes grated chocolate. I have been complimented on it by actual Italians. RE: raw eggs; the risk of salmonella in the home is quite small, especially if you used very fresh, free range eggs. Whlie I am normally very careful about food sanitation, I have no problem with this recepie.

Super Good! I thought it was very creamy and not too soggy. Very easy and impressive for how little work it takes. The dusting of cocoa really makes the presentation. I tried to take note of everything I did to help with the post about soggy results. The only thing that could make it soggy would be under whipped eggs or too much espresso in the lady fingers. Changes I have tired: Turkish coffee in place of the espresso, replace the Marsala with: Amarreto, Frangelico, or Kaluah (pardon my spelling), I added a little alcohol to the espresso for a little more punch, in a pinch I substituted pound cake for the lady fingers. The pound cake was disappointing (too grainy after the "dunking"), but my hubby still ate it all up. I agree that soaking both sides of a soft lady finger gets messy. I quickly dunk on side in the mix and then place in the dish, dunked side up. I've had no problems with this method. I've also doubled the recipe with great results.

It was OK if you make it too soggy than it will NOT taste too great. When you make it your fingers WILL get very wet! The MERINGUE was OK. Separating the yolk from the whites was indeed-very difficult! My dad loved it! In conclusion it was OK!

I think there's a typo and the lady fingers should be 14oz. They come in 7 oz packages. And it's way too much mascarpone for 4 oz of fingers.

This is the best tiramisu...very authentic. I've made tiramisu before, but never with marsala and I realy loved the flavor it gave. I did cheat and sprinkle some chocolate between the layers, but even without it would have been fantastic. I used pasteurized eggs (they take longer to whip, but be patient) and brushed the espresso mixture on with a pastry brush to avoid soggy ladyfingers.

Very authentic and quite easy. I cooked the egg yolks over a double boiler as suggested. I also added 2 Tbsp. Kahlua to the espresso and dipped the ladyfingers just enough to coat to prevent from getting too soggy.

This turned out GREAT! I did as others suggested and cooked the egg yolk/sugar mix over a double boiler for a bit, and I also doubled the recipe for the filling. I think it tastes better if it sits for a bit - making it the night before is a good idea. Okay, and this is anti-traditional, but I added a few good chocolate chips to the filling 'cause I likes the chocolate - Super delicious!

If you have a need to do something legit for a dinner party, but have been branded a culinary charity case by friends, this dish can help you lose that cast. No kidding, when I told the host that I was bringing dessert, he informed me that they didn't have a dog. Be careful with the balance between egg whites and egg yolks. Error on the side of yolks. The whites tend to over liquify the Mascarpone mix. Also, two hours of refigeration isn't enough. Use the freezer if rushed. If adding brandy, two tablespoons doesn't make a dent in the taste - go with 5 min. I used a new paint roller to moisten the lady fingers in situe. I hope this doesn't discredit all I've said.

As everyone says - excellent. I forgot to discard one egg white so I had more egg white but this did not affect the end result. In fact, you don't end up with one egg white sitting in your fridge.The tiramisu was not soggy at all.

We made this for an Italian dinner party and to quote a guest, "I'm a tiramisu freak, and this is the best I've ever had." My sister has had tiramisu in Rome and she said this was excellent. For that sweet-tooth American palette, we used sweetened (rather than unsweetened) cocoa, Valhrona semi-sweet chocolate between layers and on top, and strong coffee (rather than espresso). We also used Amaretto liquer and increased the sugar a little. Wasn't gooey at all - make sure to give it time to chill/set!

I have made this twice, both times it tasted very good. I double it for a big group, and double boil the yolks as suggested by another reviewer. The problem is both times it seems too runny. Even sitting for 24 hours the second time, it is too loose. What am I doing wrong ????

Got raves from guests. To avoid salmonella, I used three tablespoons of Egg Beaters in place of egg yolk, and then used pasteurized egg whites ($5 in a health food store in manhattan) for the egg whites. (So I didn't have to cook the eggs.) The texture was perfect - not at all runny. Great recipe.

To answer the previous cook's question: to avoid salmonella poisoning, I wouldnt serve (or eat) raw egg yolks. Just whip them with the sugar and cook over a double boiler for a few minutes. You can still beat the egg whites separately (raw) and create the desired peaks. Hope this helps, because it really is a great recipe!!

Tasty and incredibly easy and fast to make. I don't drink coffee, so the coffee flavor was a very little bit too strong for me. When I make it again, I'll either water down the espresso a bit or only dip every other ladyfinger.

Before I forget, does anyone out there know what AUGURI means?? I kicked up the presentation by doubling the recipe and using a 10" springform and topping with shaved choc., whipped cream, and choc. covered coffee beans. This is a rich but not sweet dessert, my first Tiramisu experience. Used "faux" marscapone (sorry Aunt Enza!); 8oz cream cheese, 1/4C sour cream, 2T cream. Don't skip the Marsala, it adds a layer of flavor. One complaint, the filling needs to be firmer. Maybe more cookies and layers. Almost forgot, I cooked the eggs and sugar over a double boiler. I knew it would be sitting out at work all day and didn't want to worry.
