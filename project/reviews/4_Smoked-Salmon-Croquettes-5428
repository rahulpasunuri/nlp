I made these for a baby shower, they were a hit! I'm not crazy about smoked salmon, and the flavor was subtle enough to enjoy. If your guests love it, then I would suggest adding more. To prevent them from opening upon fryting, make sure the balls are very cold BEFORE rolling in breadcrumb mixture.

very good and easy to prep all in advance for a small dinner party. I also only used 8oz cream cheese and used panko vs breadcrumbs

As other commenters suggested, I messed with the proportions of salmon to cream cheese, and ended up using 16 oz of salmon and 12 oz of cream cheese. They fried up nicely and garnered rave reviews, but I thought the salmon was a little overpowering for my tastes. Next time I will cut back on the salmon.

For a handful of ingredients, great outcome. Going by others' reactions (I don't eat fish) it was time well spent. The texture was creamy and decadent, contrasting with other fish croquette recipes. A few minor modifications: used dried dill but put it in the egg mixture to reconstitute a little; added a little dried onion for flavor depth; pre-toasted bread crumbs and baked at 375 in a shallow layer of oil then used cooking spray on top. Came out very crunchy.

No problem with having the little balls hold together while deep frying. But I added almost twice as much salmon. Next time, I will make them smaller so they are a crunchier little bite.

Super good. I enjoyed it with some oakky chardonnay. It compliments the smoked salmon very well.

These were very tasty however, I will reduce the amount of cream cheese next time I make them. If the oil is hot and the croquettes are chilled then they will not fall apart or ooze.

These crunchy on the outside-oozing on the inside tidbits were a real hit. I do agree with the reviewer who felt there was a bit too much cheese in relation to the amount of salmon. Served with a horseradish cream sauce.

True, they were tasty. But I felt like a lost the flavor of the smoked salmon in all the cheese. I prefer my smoked salmon served more simply.

Excellent as a first course or finger-food at a cocktail party. I served these as a first course on individual plates on lettuce leaves with dill garnish Guests raved and polished off every last one. I added finely chopped spring onion to the mousse and used panko crumbs as a coating.

These are wonderful!!! The only problem I have is when I fry them, they have a tendency to burst open and loose all that good stuff. Any suggestions?

This appetizer is absolutely fantastic, as well as super-easy to prepare. We made these for a cocktail party and they disappeared. I'll probably make these as an appetizer for Thanksgiving as well.

I've made these three times so far, and I flatten out the croquettes to make "cakes." That way, I can fry them using less oil. They are so yummy!

Hi Im an 18 year old student and a salmon lover, to be honest this recipe is great and really easy to make, I didnt have dill at the time I made it so i added dried oregano and cumin and a touch of hot cilantro and green jalapeño sauce and it was delicious all my friends rave about it and even my dad who is an expert cook wants me to do it again! so I HIGHLY RECOMEND IT!!!!

This recipe is perfect for the holidays. I didn't use the salad, I just set them out as appetizers w/ a couple other cream cheese based foods. These were the first to go, and everytime I entertain, they are requested. For dip-lovers, cocktail sauce does well.

This is really good & very easy. Instead of frying, I just baked them - still ok... only a bit soft.
