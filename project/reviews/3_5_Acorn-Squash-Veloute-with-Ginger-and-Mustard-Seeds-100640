Had some organic, steamed, with- skin, mashed acorn squash that had to be used up. So I used it here, cutting the simmering time by half. I also used an immersion handheld blender instead of the regular blender - making this even easier. I used jarred chopped ginger, veg stock, tomato paste and slightly less cayenne (for the kiddo). The consistency was great, didn't need to add more stock. This soup was delicious! Made it for dinner served with salad and bread. The cumin and mustard seeds complimented the flavors perfectly. Hubby and toddler also loved it. This is a keeper!

Great flavor for the simplicity of the ingredients! I crumbled queso fresca over it and didn't do the seeds the first time through and it was delicious.

Easy and excellent. Added additional ginger. the Cumin and Mustard seeds are a great addition. Used Vegetable and chix broth.

I joined epicurious just so I could rave about this soup. I made it for the first time this evening, and my wife and I were both a little surprised that acorn squash could make such a tasty soup. I used two very fresh squash from our CSA farm, and I'm sure their quality made a big difference. I also made a few minor modifications: I used a mix of olive and pumpkin seed oils to sauté the onions; I used two teaspoons of tomato powder from The Spice House in place of tomato purée; and I used cumin powder instead of cumin seeds. The ginger I used was very fresh -- it was crisp under the knife like a carrot, without the stringy toughness you get in older ginger -- and I think I ended up with a tad more gingery zing than ideal. Topping the soup with the mustard and cumin mixture is a brilliant touch. We paired the soup with my wife's pollo en escabeche and a lemony white wine (2007 Benjamin Leroux Auxey-Duresses Blanc), and it turned out to be a remarkably good combination. I will definitely be coming back to this recipe.

This soup is amazing, and absolutely worth the effort of peeling a few squashes. I like spicy foods, so I added a bit more than a pinch of cayenne and followed another reviewer's suggestion of paprika. The spice nicely complemented the delicate flavor of the squash. This is certain to become a staple in my home!

We have a soup night before Thanksgiving and prepared this recipe for that occasion. It has been requested every year since.

I love the ginger and hint of cayenne. I made this for my Mother after she had dental surgery. I toasted the seeds and ground for her, but they are good whole, if your teeth are fine.

Great! I added more ginger for that extra kick. Very much worth the time.

A sweet rich soup. I halved the recipe (very easy) but kept the spices the same. I also added a pinch of hungarian paprika, which gave it a wonderful earthiness. A very subtle soup, with the seeds adding a lovely texture and flavor. The result definitely makes up for the hassle of peeling an acorn squash!

I was short on broth, so to the sauteing squash and onions, I added about a cup of good chardonnay I had on hand and reduced it by half before adding the chicken broth. It made the finished product more complex and interesting. I also cooked the seeds from the squash along with the seed mixture for additional crunch and contrast.

My family and I thought this soup was excellent! When tasting it before serving, my husband and I agreed it needed something...the mustard and cumin seeds were exactly what it needed. This soup is great cold too. Its flavor is so intense, however, that I recommend small servings. The recipe as-is serves 8 full bowls...you might want to cut it in half.

The first time I served this wonderful dish was to my husband as part of a special anniversary dinner. Since then, he has requested it again and we seem to enjoy it more each time.

Absolutely awful. Completely bland. Ruined some good acorn squash. I even tried adjusting the recipe (amounts of tomato paste, pepper, salt etc.) and could not make it remotely likeable.

The amount of pepper seems a bit much for us, we love the taste of acorn squash, and wouldn't want to over power it. Otherwise, I'm going to try it tomorrow.
