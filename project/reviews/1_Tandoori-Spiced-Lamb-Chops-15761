You can get tandoori paste at any South Asian food store. If you live somewhere where there isn't one available (the moon?), I believe Trader Joe's (http://www.traderjoes.com/) sells the pastes at only a slight mark-up. If you live somewhere where there is no Asian store and no Trader Joe's then it won't matter that this recipe calls for a ready-made paste because where are you going to get the ingredients to make tandoori from scratch anyway (e.g., Garam Masala)?

I agree with the earlier post. This isn't a recipe, this is a set of directions from a jar of tandoori paste. What gives?

This recipe is so easy to prepare that it sounds too good to be true. Well, it's not. It is fairly difficult to find tandoori paste in most US markets, and the dish doesn't produce a very impressive result. Next time I'll look for a more sophisticated tandoori chicken recipe, and grill it over an open fire.
