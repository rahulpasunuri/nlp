Easy, gooey, yummy. I only made this because I just happened to have kahlua and Bailey's in the cupboard, and needed something easy for teacher appreciation day at school. I used kahlua and white chocolate chips. Couldn't really taste the kahlua, but I'm wary of adding too much and messing up the ingredient ratio (more liquor, less oil???). Three stars because I just can't give a recipe using brownie mix four stars!! The "Best Cocoa Brownies" on Epicurious are pretty fast/easy for being 100% from scratch.

Best brownie recipe . .I do bake at 325 rather than 350 so that the edges do not burn. These are always a hit with family and friends

I have made these numerous times to rave reviews. I use any old bits of chocolate and sherry or any liquor I have on hand. So satisfying to make!

Sinfully delicious brownies!!! Next time I think I'll add a little more Bailey's to make the taste stand out a bit more, and I think I cooked them a little too long but they were crunchy on the outside and gooey in the middle. Really really good.

This is the best recipe for brownies. Recently, I added some cappuccino chips, (like chocolate chips, only cappuccino flavored) with some dark chocolate chips. We truly devoured all of them in one day. Such a great recipe. I also did a cherry cordial recipe fashioned after this recipe to a successful outcome, but the original recipe is very easy, very quick, and very much will give you.. Killer Brownies!

Its true...its easy and its from a box, but my boyfriend specifically asks me to make them about every 2 months. He goes into brownie withdrawal. And when he takes them to work he's a hero because everyone LOVES these brownies. Don't let the negative reviews turn you away. This is a SOLID brownie recipe. Oh, you definitely need to cook them for more than 35 minutes...more like 45 or 50.

The only nice thing I can say is that it's easy. Beyond that it turns out to be very ordinary, rich and jammed full of chips and nuts, but still ordinary.

This is my favorite brownie recipe, because it is so easy and they taste homemade - People ALWAYS rave about them! I use Bailey's instead of Kahlua, which make them taste so decadent. Perfect recipe!

Rating: 4
I've made this many times, and always to rave reviews - and it's so easy! Two yummy variations - crumble heath bars over the top about ten minutes before the brownies are finished - goes great with the coffee flavoring; or substitute chambord for the kahlua to get raspberry brownies - top with a mixture of melted chocolate and seedless raspberry jam.

No different than any other brownies from a box. Any brownie lover can tell the difference.

A mix is a mix and you can taste it no matter how well you doctor it up. I was hoping for good results, used Ghirardelli brownie mix, but I could still taste that bitter box aftertaste. And I missed the richness of butter sorely. Back to my old standard.

Expect to cook these longer than 35 minutes. Mine took almost 45 and got a bit crisp around the edges but needed the time to cook the center. Flavor is awesome and fudgy, chewy consistency is decadent. No one will know this came from a box.

I have made this recipe at least four times and just now realized that it calls for fudge brownie mix! I have been buying traditional brownie mix as I am a cake brownie person rather than fudge. Wonderful recipe, easy and often requested. I end up baking 5-10 minutes more until the toothpick comes out clean but it could be the oven. These make a scrumptious base for brownie sundaes!

We made these Delicious Brownies today using the Bailey's Irish Creme.. and ONLY a half of bag of White Chocolate Chips ( that is what was found in the freezer)... We served them to some men who were here working on the house.. They agreed that these WERE THE BEST BROWNIES!!! ..Not even a crumb was left on the platter....YUM!!

Very good quick recipe. I used Guirdelia double, double chocolate chips which are much richer than semisweet chocolate chips and home made Bailys Irish Cream. After cookies baked I poked holes in the top and brushed on an additional 1/4 cup bailys on top. My guest said they were the best brownies they have ever eaten. One said she was a brownie nut and these were to die for. Thanks for the recipe. To the person that wanted a home made recipe. You could use your favorite brownie recipe and substitute bailys for the water in the recipe.

Made these for a party. I used a basic Pillsbury Mix and added both pecans and walnuts (toasted) and both white and milk chocolate chips. Once they'd cooled I cut them in squares and topped them with confectioners sugar. They looked impressive, tasted even better. I doubled the recipe as others had suggested and used a 13 x 9 pan, but I thought they were a little too thick (almost 2"). Also, I was concerned because the edges were so crisp that they were very difficult to cut. But no fear, the result was crunchy, chewy, and sinful! Next time I'll probably adjust the portion/pan size for a slightly thinner brownie.

These brownies are a knockout!

Rating: 4
I'll admit that I'm kind of a brownie snob, and I thought these things rocked! I doubled the bailey's, per other suggestions, but wouldn't use quite that much next time. Especially when I'm serving them to kids as well as adults (whoops- forgot about the alcohol part til it was too late! Oh well...) They were a huge hit at this party... to satisfy nut- and non-nut lovers, I just pressed some pecan halves onto the top of part of the tray of brownies (before baking) and this worked great! The pecans got nicely roasted and people could easily tell which ones had nuts and which ones didn't. Moist and fudgy... as good as from scratch but a lot faster! Yum!!!

Simple and yummy. Have some friends over and indulge in a super chocolatey experience. Great for little ones!

To A Cook on 6/9/03: Give us all a break!...I suppose that you grind your own flour, make your own chocolate, and gather your own pecans from the orchard. Stop being such a snob and and pull your head out of your pompous a--! Even the best of resturants use some form of convenience products.

Rating: 4
I also doubled the recipe and put it into a 13/9/2" pan as well. I used both pecans and walnuts, whatever I had of Kaluha and other coffee or chocolate flavored liquer. It came out moist with a perfect slightly puffed and crusted top. These are very rich, moist and definitely not compromised by a boxed mix. I will make these for special deserts with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a mint leaf to garnish.

If I wanted to use a damn box mix, I would not have accessed this site!

So yummy, so easy, I'm reluctant to try any other brownie recipe. To the person who asked about a 13x9-inch pan: I doubled the recipe (w/two boxes of mix) and used a big pan just fine. They come out so moist that I actually prefer them a day later when they're a little crusty on the outside.

I make this every year for the dessert sale at my daughter's ballet recital and they always sell right away. I use water instead of Kahlua, and I omit the nuts because of possible allergies when serving a large crowd. As soon as they are out of the oven I place about 20 Hershey's kisses on the hot brownies (so there will be one on each brownie when they're cut.) The bottom of the kisses melts so they stick to the brownies. After the brownies cool, I sprinkle them with powdered sugar. They really look special!

I have made this recipe twice in the last two months. Everyone thought they were made from scratch. I've used Kahlua and Baileys and both were delicious.

I've been making this brownie recipe for almost 2 1/2 years and everyone who tastes them loves them. Try using one of those mini-loaf pans and each brownie will have a nice crust around it.

I read all of the reviews and felt this was the perfect recipe for me. I had a box of brownie mix and wanted to jazz it up a little. I would agree with another reviewer and add a little more liquer (we used Bailey's). Great, quick recipe!

These brownies are awesome! I too tried it with Grand Marnier instead of Kahula and it was so good. My mom who is a firm "from scratch" brownie gal couldn't tell these were a from a mix! I will try your idea, Miss Kendra and make it next time with the Chambord! YUMMY!

i haven't made this recipe, but plan to soon. I was wondering if anybody knew if i could substitute butter for part or all of the oil required and if so what measurement would work. thanks

I used Chambord (because I had it in the house) and Hershey's Bake Shoppe raspberry-flavored chocolate chips combined with regular chocolate chips. Since serving these brownies, I have received more than one marriage proposal ... proceed with caution!

Very tasty! I usedthe Ghirardelli brownie mix (w/chocolate chips in the mix) as well as 1/2 a bag of Ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate chips, 1/2 cup of pecans and Kahlua (as the coffee liqueur). I brought them to work and to a bridal shower. Many have asked for the recipe. However, you really only need a small 1.5" X 1.5" serving due to the richness of the chocolate.

this recipe is always a hit with our guests who never believe that it's from a mix. i use baileys irish cream (having also tried the recipe with kahlua) and my husband and i both prefer the taste.

This recipe is great and so easy. I have made it a few times and have bumped the Kahlua content quite a bit each time - it really adds a nice rich flavor. You can also use fresh-brewed espresso or strong coffee if you don't have Kahlua on hand (most of the alcohol burns off anyway, so you end up with a similiar taste). Great recipe.

Amazing, simple-to-make, brownies! Didn't quite taste the kahlua, but loved the moistness of the brownies. I substituted apple sauce for 1/2 of the oil and you'd never know. Sprinkle powdered sugar on top to present.

Great tasting and moist (I was unsure about using boxed brownies-bought Ghiradelli). I added white and bittersweet chocolate chunks to the top after cooking. They need to be cooked 5-10 mins. longer. I have also used Grand Marnier/Mozart Orange liquours instead of Khalula.

I used Frangelico instead of the coffee liqueur, and walnuts instead of pecans. They were thick and fudgey, with just the perfect amount of moist "goo" in the center. I brought them to a backyard BBQ and everyone wanted to get the name of the bakery where I got them. A brilliant disguise for brownie mix.

The chocolate chips were a million years old and I didn't have quite enough pecans...but people INHALED these brownies. The non-chocoholics felt the chips could have been left out. Everyone thought they were made from scratch("nothing this good comes out of a box") and I just didn't have the heart to confess...

These were very good though I could not tell the difference between this recipe and the Duncan Hines brownie mix. I did not put in the full amount of chocolate chips. Perhaps that makes the difference. Despite that I still enjoyed the brownies and will make them again.

This indeed took only minutes to put together, and baked it for 45 min in a 9 1/2-inch ceramic pie dish. I liked the chewy consistency, but it was too chocolately for my taste -- although I got lots of compliments on it.

I put this on my list of all time favorite brownies. My daughter-in-law told me about this wonderful brownie recipe she had found in Bon Appetit, and I told her I had already made it, and I agreed that it was a winner!

I have to agree with the other reviewers: this is a can't miss brownie recipe! It's a dense, fudgy brownie that gives you a mouthful of chocolate with each bite. Definitely a dessert chocolate lovers will enjoy. I couldn't believe how quick this was to throw together: it literally took 5 minutes to stir it up and pop it in the oven. I cooked mine for a little longer than 35 minutes, but I started to check for doneness after 30 minutes. I'll definitely be making these again.

I have had many "Brownie Disasters" in the past (too mushy, too hard)so rarely bake them. I wanted something choclate, quick, decadent and impressive for a new guy friend coming over last minute. The recipe was easy, and yummy. My friend took some home and pronounced them "Excellent". I'll be using this recipe when I want a dependable brownie recipe. I had a smaller, rectangular pan and so baked them covered with foil for the last 15 min because they were getting done on the edges and still gooy inside. The tops are shiny and crackly and taste chocolately with great flavor from the Kahlua coffee liquor.

These brownies were really wonderful! Very dense and fudgy. Everyone at a picnic loved them and they were gone in a flash. The only change I made was to use 'mini' chocolate chips because it was all I had. I'll make these again!
