So good! This is the second time I've made this. Of course, I'm guilty, I never make the recipe exactly as is. Didn't have enough ramps so, I supplemented with scallions and, I couldn't find fresh morels so, I used Shitakes but, still it's a wonderful spring meal.

this was delicious. I have made ramps 3 times in the last week and they never cease to amaze. Here's the recipe i made just the other day which incorporates egg and spaghetti. next time I think I will add morels as they did here! http://www.neurotickitchen.com/2012/04/ramped-up-spaghetti-with-ramps.html

A tasty spring egg dish. Perfect for brunch. I'd make it again if I happened to have ramps, asparagus and morels in my fridge.

Simple and delicious. All the ingredients are in season at the same time so I was able to do all my shopping at the farmers' market - a big plus for me. I didn't find morels so I used crimini mushrooms instead, though most any variety would do. I also seasoned the eggs with salt and pepper, and grated a sprinkling of fresh Parmesan over top as a tasty garnish. Easy enough to make anytime yet elegant enough to serve at a brunch party.
