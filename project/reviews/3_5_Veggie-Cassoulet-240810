This was good after it was tweaked. I added carrots in addition to ingredients and used white wine instead of bean liquid. I added a second can of tomatoes and used red pepper flakes and garlic salt to beef up the flavor. It was delicious! Oh and I topped it with crumbled feta before serving with toasted Italian bread.

I added the wine and cheese, and extra can of tomatoes per the other review's comments and thought it was divine!

I love this recipe and make it all the time regardless of the season. Being a vegetarian I'm always looking for hearty, healthful main course meals. I switch out the celery for carrots and always add wine for flavor. I agree with others that it is very versatile and many combinations of vegetables can be used. I also use more garlic than called for. I add grated parmasean when serving.

I make this all the time. I usually add an extra can of tomatoes and serve it over toasted country bread with feta sprinkled over it. It works really well if you can make it in a cast iron pot (5 qt.) Everyone I have made this for, even my husband who doesn't like vegetarian dishes, loves this one.

I made this as the vegetarian entree for Thanksgiving dinner and everyone like it, including the meat eaters, who said it complemented the turkey. I doubled the garlic and thyme and let the whole thing simmer for an hour, to develop the flavors, before putting it into the oven.

This was really easy to make and turned out well. I made a few substitutions based on other reviews which worked out perfectly... carrots instead of celery; 1.5 cups of white kidney beans; 1 tbsp of herbes de provence instead of thyme + bay leaf; and red wine instead of using slimey bean liquid. Made the whole thing in a cast iron pot. Delish!

Thought this was fabulous. However, I did leave out the celery and instead added some fresh cremini mushrooms. Just lovely and simple.

This was so YUM! Carrots instead of celery. 6 cloves of garlic. Used the Herbs de Provence as recommended by others. Whole pkg of Crimini mushrooms halved. No bean liquid (yuck). Rinsed the beans then added some powdered veggie broth, 1 heaping tsp, and did not drain the tomatoes. Would have used red wine but didn't have any. Next time I am going to add eggplant. Topped with bread crumbs and mozzarella. So tasty and hearty. Will def make again.

One of my favorite go-to recipes during the winter when I'm craving hot & filling but want a low-cal dinner. It is great as is but I also love the room for variations. I sprinkle breadcrumbs on the top 10 min. before taking it out of the oven. Tonight I also used garlic marinara sauce instead of the tomatoes and it was great. Yay this recipe!

Very easy and delicious -- based on previous reviews, I cut the amount of beans in half and added some cut up chorizo. I also used 1/4 cup dry red wine instead of bean liquid reserve -- really flavorful.

This turned out quite delicious, and was very simple to make. I used a Dutch oven instead of the saucepan/baking dish combo, and added chorizo, carrots, red wine, grated Fontina, and herbes de Provence as advised by the reviews. This makes a great basic recipe, and I'll be sure to use it again.

This was so healthy and delicious too! After reading the reviews I added some herbs de provence as well (1TBS). I also added the thyme and the bay leaves and a little red wine. I served it with toasted Sicilian Sundried Tomato and Basil Ciabatta. I omitted the celery because I am allergic and added diced carrots. It turned out great!! The leftovers were just as good. The dish will really warm you up on a rainy or cold day.

I make this recipe again and again. I use great northern beans in place of the cannellini beans to give a smoother texture.

I added diced Aidelles cajun sausage, sliced carrots, and topped with shredded romano and bread crumbs. Also used herbs de provence ...oh yeah, and some white wine for the fun of it. Served over rice. It was yummy. We had seconds.

I didn't love this. First off, I would halve the recipe. All the vegetables barely fit in my large skillet which made them hard to stir and resulted in uneven cooking. Then, everything barely fit it my 2-quart baking dish which, again, made it hard to combine the ingredients. I had a ton of leftovers. I didn't find it particularly flavorful, either. I would make lots of changes if I made it again, which is unlikely.

Followed the recipe but using 1c less of beans and adding lightly browned pieces of veal sausage. Added to the flavor, more like a true cassoulet and was delicious!

this was my first cassoulet, and very good! added an eggplant to add some more color, used fresh rosemary, thyme, and parsley, and topped with grated mozzarella and parmesan before baking, turned out delish, and the leftovers were even better!

Good vegetable soup, but don't make it thinking it's a cassoulet. Very similar to a soup by Deborah Madison: zuni stew. It was good, but it was not a cassoulet. To make more like a cassoulet, add the herbes de provence (as some others have said). Double the beans, and add some capers and chopped cured olives. To add that richness of a cassoulet, I might also add some sundried tomatoes and a good bit more parsley. Like I said, a good, tasty quick vegetable bean soup, but I wasn't getting that "south o' France" nostalgia feeling.

I really enjoyed this on a rainy evening. I sauted some bacon in the pan (instead of the olive oil) before I added some diced carrots followed by the rest of the veggies. I also added some shiitake mushrooms and sausages towards the end of the stove top cooking. Then before I put it in the oven instead of using fresh herbs since I didn't have any on hand, I just used 1 1/2 Tbl. of Herbes de Provence (as suggested by another reviewer). I also thought it was a little dry so added 3/4cup of red wine. It came out great, very hearty with nice depth and complexity of flavor.

very healthy and easy to cook. my husband enjoyed it

Warm, hearty and satisfying, without leaving you uncomfortably full. I thought the tomatoes were a little outnumbered so I added an extra half cup and was pleased with the balance. I did not have fresh thyme on hand but sprinkled a dash of herbes de Provence over the top of each bowl just before serving and thought it was just marvelous.

Great recipe. Very simple, tasty, and inexpensive. After reading other reviews I added more dried herbs...thyme, and some fresh marjoram sprigs since that is what I had on had. Got great reveiws from friends over for dinner.

very tasty!!! I actually craved this dish during the day as did my kids. I just sprinkled the top with bread crumbs besides using the wheat toasts....GREAT side dish.

I give this recipe the full 4 forks because not only is it DELICIOUS, it's also cheap, easy to make and very healthy! What more could you want? The only thing I'd add is a 1/4 cup (or less) of seasoned store-bought breadcrumbs sprinkled over the top. My husband is allergic to tomatoes, so I doubled the onions and threw in 4 or 5 carrots. Fantastic.

Quick and easy and surprisingly flavorful. I used two largish zucchini and a large onion, so doubled the salt and pepper and used large sprigs of thyme and large bay leaves.

I really enjoyed this for a cold day lunch. Substitued one of the zucchini for 3 carrots. Excellent!

Great dish! Much more flavorful than I thought it would be. Substituted dried thyme for fresh, but otherwise followed exactly.

Excellent cassoulet...not that I have any frame of reference, but still...I liked it. ^_^ Heeding the warnings of a bland dish, I removed the thyme and bay leaves and added a tablespoon, or so, of Herbes de Provençe. The dish itself looks great, to boot!

A surprisingly flavourful recipe. Not sure why some others thought it was bland. Fast and easy to prepare and is awesome warmed up the next day. I did substitute navy beans for the cannelini beans with great results.

Will not be making this recipe again. It was very bland.

0 forks. In my 8 years cooking Epicurious recipes, this one was the most disapointing. If you want a bean and veggie dish, I suggest making a basic Ratatouille and adding beans as Peter Berley does in "The Flexatarian Table."

I made this as written except for the addition of two portabello mushroom caps for a bit of meatiness. Very good flavors and very satisfying. Even better the next day.
