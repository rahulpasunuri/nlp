I should have followed reviewers' advice and baked for less time. These spread out way too much and are very dark around the edges. Also, the coriander and curry flavors are very subtle. Next time I'll increase the spices, chill dough before baking, and bake for 10-12 minutes.

These were so good! I am half Pakistani and my dad and I loved the bit of spicy aftertaste. They were very crunchy, and not very sweet, but very buttery, like shortbread. The spicy kick was so different in a great way.

The most intriguing and delicous recipe for cookies I've seen in ages! I've made three batches of these in the last 24 hours because they seem to vanish into thin air within 15 minutes of baking. I made the recipe just as is the first time but added 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground pepper to the ensuing batches. Only baked them until just beginning to brown on the outside bottom edge. I plan to add some lemon zest the next time... which will probably be within the next hour if based on history.

I love the idea of an "adult cookie." The directions were well written, and it was clear every ingredient served a purpose. I sprinkled cinnamon over the cookies after they finished baking. I followed other reviews and used half of the salt. You could cut some of the butter out as well. I think incorporating apple would round out the flavors as well. All-in-all they were delicious!

Honestly, the most interesting cookie I've eaten. I followed the recipe to the T except for the replacement of half the butter for virgin, non hydrogenated coconut oil. I did this because I have a nephew who is intolerant to animal protein (no or little butter allowed) Long story short, they were delicious and my husband cannot stop raving about them. Will even take them to my in-laws tomorrow.

You may get more favor if you refrigerate dough over night in a roll. Slice, cut into pieces, cook 18 minutes. Can cook in ball/chunk shape for a more sturdy cookie for traveling. Would like to somehow reduce the buttery richness though.

Just looked up recipes with coriander seeds after I purchased many spices to experiment on - and broaden my cooking/baking skills. Found this, made it right away and I must say, it is delicious! As someone wrote earlier it's more like a biscuit, I agree. This melts in your mouth with an occasional slight crunch. Great for after dinner with a nice floral tea. I can't wait to serve this to my family and friends.

These were delicious. They need more coriander and curry, and I turned the heat down to 300 (same cooking time). The bottoms of my first batch were just a little too brown for my taste.

Delicious adult cookie. My sister made and had us guess the secret ingredient, which like another reviewer, we thought it was maple syrup or caramel. Very smoky caramely - yum. The adults loved these, but my kids did not care for them though.

I made a half recipe, and the amount of spices seemed just about right. I loved the taste -- unusual, but not weird, and just the right sweetness. I didn't like the ball and squish process; some cookies spread out and browned nicely, while others stayed thick and rather hard. Wonderful flavor.

I am sorry to say that I was very disappointed with this recipe. I was really excited about making these unique cookies but in the end they are just buttery and boring. Not bad cookies, just not very exciting. I might make them again sometime and double the amount of curry and coriander. If I do I will be sure to report back!

if you want a cookie that will wow people's palates, this is the cookie to make. And kind of strange/funny, but the coriander reminds me of Sprite. and in a good way. would agree with a previous user's comment about reducing the salt but regardless, these cookies improve with time and will go very quickly.

Delish. I just made a batch. Very sophisticated yet approachable taste. Highly recommended.

Really good! My guests thought they were "maple" (I didn't get that, because I already knew the "secret" but they loved them!) I thought maybe a little too salty, but still delicious. Excellent sandy texture.

Excellent combination of tastes with curry, corriender and sweet. Good left as 1" round drops rather than flattened.

Excellent! I added about 1 tsp lemon zest and baked at 325/convection for about 15 mins, switching racks halfway. Terrific complex flavor, perfectly crumbly consistency!

The spices are absolutely perfect in this shortbread. They seem more like a "biscuit" to have with tea or coffee but I find them just right for a not-too- sweet ending to a meal. The texture is melt-in-your-mouth. I took mine out of the oven after about 9 minutes. I think they were more tender for the shorter baking time. I also found that a fork dipped in sugar worked better for me than the chopstick method.

This was a successful recipe. I made them for my sister's birthday and she raved about them. To me, they were a little too buttery tasting (but admittedly - I am not a shortcake fan). Love the idea of using the savory curry spices in a cookie. Would love to try other curry cookie recipes.

These are the most amazing cookies I have ever had! My new favorite. I added a little extra spice and they turned out amazing!

These were a huge hit at a recent party. I thought they were very good, but was afraid the unusual flavors might turn people off, but I was so wrong. Everyone wanted to take home what was left over at the end of the evening.

Unique and delightful. And easy! Made as directed they were small, dome- shaped and just lovely. The house smelled fragrant for days too. I'm about to make these now but will double the batch and increase the spices just a bit since my curry may be too mild or a bit old. I baked for 15 minutes.

The flavors in this cookie are incredible. Next time I make them I will not hand beat them as instructed. I don't really get why it says to do that, and the flour did not distribute evenly (probably my fault, okay) and resulted in cookies that spread way too much. Also don't understand the X you make in the middle. Also, the cookies I made turned out a neon color from the curry...just so you don't expect cookies the color of those in the picture. they were delicious enough to merit trying to perfect them, though.

Really delicious and unusual - but only with less salt. I agree with the previous review. I used 3/4 tsp salt and that still seemed a bit too much (and I am a fan of the salty/sweet dessert). Also as noted in the previous review and others, cooking time should be 12-15 min max. As suggested, I used 1 1/2 tsp. ground coriander and toasted it in the pan with the curry powder, and next time I might use more coriander. Interestingly, the cookies weren't as impressive the first day, but seemed to really improve overnight and over the next few days (we rationed them, they were so good!). Made me think they'd be an especially good holiday gift.

I liked the way these turned out after I learned a couple of things about this recipe: - shorten cooking time to 15 min. - cut the salt back to 3/4 or 1/2 tsp. Definitely better when they're not burned.

These are AWESOME!! I'm making creamy curry chicken for dinner and these will be a fun addition to the menu - with vanilla ice cream.

Forgot to add that I used the processor for the whole process with success. A one inch melonballer was a great time saver. Eighteen cookies to a sheet was perfect spacing.

These shortbread cookies are so good!. I couldn`t detect very much curry or coriander flavor, but maybe it`s so subtle and still makes the cookies tremendous. I have purchased fresh supplies for the second batch. Maybe mine were too old.

These are coming to the BBQ today. I made them with hot curry. They are awesome.

Truly EXCEPTIONAL. My new favorite cookie! I served them to my family and no one could guess what the "secret" ingredient(s) were. But boy they did not last long! I will definitely be making these again and again.
