Great marinade and the flavor really comes through on the steaks even after only 4 hours marinating. I didn't care for the peppercorn sauce much and wouldnt make it again.

I didn't try the marinade because it got mixed reviews. If you are looking for a good beer marinade recipe for steaks, try the one which was voted as one of the best recipes. I only tried the sauce which was pretty good. I didn't have chicken broth so I only used beef broth. It was good although it took me almost 2 hours to reduce it. I will do it again.

Made the recipe as written, except for not having Worcestershire sauce for the marinade. Used prime grade steaks (thank you Costco), which made for a very special New Year's dinner. Would definitely include the Worcestershire sauce in the marinade next time as the steak was a tiny bit sweet. That said, it was really outstanding and the sauce (as other reviewers have noted) is TO DIE! Oh, one other thing on the sauce -- I halved the four-pepper mix and added a tablespoon of green peppercorns instead. Also, didn't have any problem getting the sauce to reduce, but have found that can be more due to one's cooktop than anything else. Served with mashed potatoes and sauteed broccolini with toasted hazelnuts and gorgonzola

the flavors in this dish are wonderful, but i still can't get the sauce to thicken as much as i'd like without cheating (ie--adding cornstarch)

Rating: 3
The tips from the other reviewers made the difference; I cut the amount of pepper corns in half and used cornstarch. I didn't have ginger and left out the lime juice for the marinate. I marinated the steaks for less than two hours and prepared them in a pan. They were terrific.

Rating: 4
I marniated the steaks overnight, they were very sweet in relation to the peppery sauce. I don't think the steaks themselves were spectacular. The sauce really makes this dish. I must admit, we like a thicker sauce, so I cheated and added a teaspoon of cornstarch to my heavy cream prior to adding to the stock. My fiance couldn't get enough of it. Reminded us of a great little restaurant in Key West and thier peppercorn sauce. We've been trying to recreate it for years and finally I have a great tasting sauce to add to my repertoire!!!

Rating: 4
Don't consider adding cornstarch to this recipe and risk changing the flavor. Just reduce the wine, shallot, and stock by 3/4 of the recipe recommended amount. If you want the consistency thicker, reduce it more. This sauce is absolutely a five***** recipe!!!

Rating: 3
I only had two hours to marinate the steak, but when I make it again, I will marinate it overnight. Regardless, the sweetness in the steak was a balance to the pepper in the thin sauce and we loved it. I agree that reduction is the key to a thicker sauce, but I may cheat next time and use cornstarch.

This is a wonderful twist on a marinade. My husband loved it and eats his steaks without any sauce. The Peppercorn Sauce is wonderful. It would be good on any kind of meat. I added some of the marinade to the peppercorn sauce. Excellent flavor!

This is a recipe I come back to time and time again. Everyone I have ever made it for has enjoyed it greatly, even my finicky father. Sometimes, if I don't have time to marinate the steak, I still cook up the sauce to serve with it. I agree with other posters, it does need something to thicken the sauce, cornstarch, flour, or cooking it for slightly longer thickens it up a bit.

Rating: 3
A very good recipe with a complex blend of flavours. Well worth the time/effort and cost of good quality ingredients. Beware: the acidic lime juice in the marinade will break down the fibres of the meat resulting in steaks with a rather unpleasant soft/mushy texture that is almost like they have been precooked - do not confuse this with tenderness. This is true of all acids regardless of type. Suggestion: to impart/maintain the lime flavour, add finely zested lime peel to the marinade instead of the juice. The peel is considerably more concentrated in flavour and has a much higher proportion of oil to acid ratio. As an alternative, add shredded Kaffir lime leaves to the marinade. Re the peppercorn sauce: use only 1 tbsp. peppercorns (2tbsp. is far too much and will be bitter/acerbic and overpowering); add wine or brandy (preferred for the deeper flavour) and simmer until almost evaporated; add broth and continue to simmer until well reduced. Lastly, add the cream and gently simmer/reduce to the desired consistency stirring only as necessary. The key is to reduce, reduce, reduce before adding the cream. The best/most flavourful sauces are made by reducing, never by adding thickening agents. If you take the time and are patient, you will be rewarded with a sauce that is a memorable complement to the marinated steaks. Submitted by a not-so-recent graduate from culinary school. Yes, even we "old pros" access and use Epicurious - a valued culinary resource!

If there was a 5 fork rating, I would give it to this recipe!!! The marinade is WONDERFUL & the sauce, while VERY spicy, is fantastic. I made it for a BBQ - the first time I ever cooked for my boyfriend's mom so I really wanted to impress her. Well, it's been a few days, and everyone is still talking about them! Next time I would cut the peppercorns in half because it is really spicy, but DAMN - this is a great recipe!

This is my husband's favorite recipe - hands down. It has been a staple in our kitchen (grill) since published. We often just marinate the steak and skip the peppercorn sauce (although the sauce is FABULOUS) for weeknight dinner.

Rating: 2
Altho I only gave this 2 forks, there are parts of it I like and would tweak if i did it again. The peppersorn sauce came out great but i would cut down on the amount of peppercorns and actually, i found the sauce did thicken if i didn't stir once the cream went in. I stirred initially and then just let it simmer and it thickened enough to my liking. I certainly wouldn't want it to be gravy-consistency. The marinade also was good, but really nothing special. And i did only marinate about 5 hours as i was short on time. The meat ended up not as tender and i think overnight would have helped. I may make this again but frankly next time i want a good old steak, i don't think I will go through all this trouble. My guests said it was good but probably out of being kind. If it was good they would rave as they serious "foodies".

Rating: 4
I really liked this recipe. I doubled it for both the marinate and the sauce to accomodate meat for 20 people. The sauce i think can use less pepper and definitely needs cornstarch or equiv. thickener. Otherwise rave reviews all around and everyone wanted to know what the secret was.

Absolutely the best marinade I have ever had. The only downside is the length of time required to prepare the recipe.

To be quite honest we haven't tried the beef marinade yet but we love the peppercorn sauce. It is a little on the thin side so, as someone else suggested, we also put it in a dish for dipping. I especially love it with a marinated chicken breast that my husband makes.

Rating: 2
Eh, this was OK. With all the ingredients in the marinade, I was really expecting more tender, flavorful meat. The meat had a sweet taste and was unusual. Still good. The sauce was extra extra thin for me, and i tried all the tricks from the previous reviews. All the good peppercorn stuff just sank to the bottom and my sauce never coated the spoon. Although the flavors did complement each other, I would probably only make the steak marinade OR the sauce. Otherwise, its a lot of work for a no-big-deal dish.

Exceptionally good. I've tried peppercorn sauces before, and didn't really care for them. This was and exception. Maybe it's because I simmered the sauce longer (about 35 min.) before adding the cream, and then another 10 min. after adding it (did this only because we had a delay with cooking the steaks). Other than the time, followed the recipe exactly.

I took some advice from some of the other comments, and left the lime juice out of the marinade, and thought it was excellent. The peppercorn sauce was a way too much for me though. I also think I should have added cornstarch.

The steaks were absolutely DELICIOUS!!! I didn't do the whole sauce bit, just marinated the steaks overnight in the ingredientst that the recipe called for, and we bbqed them the next day, had them as is with roasted potatoes on the side. A definate keeper, the steaks were moist and great!

Rating: 3
Excellent! Made exactly as written - steaks were moist, tender and very flavorful, although a little over-cooked. Loved the peppercorn sauce but think next time I will reduce the peppercorns slightly -just a little too biting for my taste. Also, I may try it with red wine or brandy instead of the white wine - perhaps would give a deeper flavor. Re the marinade: I should have listened to my husband (he is in the food industry). He warned the lime juice would almost "pre-cook" the meat by breaking down too much of the protein and changing the texture - and he was right! Next time, I will definitely omit the lime juice. A previous reviewer said much the same thing regarding acid. Otherwise, I thought the marinade was great. This recipe will certainly go in my favorites file.

A very solid base recipe. I've used it twice now. Once, as is and adding carmalized onions and mushrooms atop the steak. The second time, increasing the ginger, omitting the mustard and adding cilantro and sesame oil to the marinade and using cubed, boneless, beef ribs to make kebabs. Both meals were received with rave reviews.

For the cook from BC regarding the PC Memories of Lyon Sauce...you can't really use it by itself. If you mix half heavy (whipping) cream and half of the sauce, you will get a very nice peppercorn sauce with no fuss. Just heat and serve. The packaged Knorr Suisse 5 Peppercorn sauce is quite good too.

Rating: 1
I agree with the reviews from Lake Tahoe and Texas. First, I think the marinating time was too long for that cut of meat. I agree that it "cooked" the meat, meaning it changed the texture. Also, the marinade hid the flavor of these beautiful steaks. I got a restaurant cut of meat from a well known butcher. What a waste of money. I agree the sauce was good but too thin. I did need to thicken with cornstarch. I will not waste my time and money on this recipe!

Fantastic dish, especially the sauce. A warning, though: the first time we read the review of the cook from Toronto, bought The President's Choice Memories of Lyon peppercorn sauce and ... ended up without a sauce. Had to throw it out - it's ketchup mixed with mushy peppercorn bits. Make your own!

Rating: 0
I still question why I even tried this recipe? Adding an acid to the marinade, especially for 24 hours 'cooks' the meat. That is great for ceviche, but not for a prime cut of beef. Oh well, live and learn....... I must say that adding a reduced stock with reduced beer, mustard, peppercorns, minced shallots and garlic is a great combo, but it doesn't work with an acidic 'precooked' marinade of beef! It's up to you and your personal taste what you want to do with an expensive cut of meat, but I would suggest leaving out the acid until the very last minute.

I marinated thick sirloin steaks for 2 days and they were very good - not outstanding. I did not make the sauce but served it with Presidents Choice Memories of Lyon 4 Peppercorn sauce. It is so fantastic that it is not worth the trouble of making a peppercorn sauce. I also served the steak with carmelized onions and roasted garlic on top. Our guests enjoyed thoroughly.

This is fantastic - another keeper for the 'favorites' file! My picky father-in-law devoured his Father's Day dinner and had seconds. The sauce reduced fine over medium-high heat - no need for cornstarch.

I originally made this for my husband who loves beef much more than I and found that I also enjoyed the steaks. I have used this marinade since for London broil and also with pork tenderloin. And while I deviate from the recipe a little bit each time, the result has been consistently delicious.

Fabulous! I made this for dinner this evening and both my guest and I loved it. I too thickened the sauce with cornstarch. While I found the sauce too peppery at first, it seemed to mellow by third or fourth bite. My guest, however, says there is just the right amount of pepper in it. This is definitely a recipe I will repeat over and over.

This was good! Had two large cuts of strip steak, so cut recipe in 1/2. It was pretty easy, sauce seemed a bit complex, so again I reduced amounts, did not bother with the chicken stock, and adjusted it all accordingly. Advice on the corn starch was excellent, added a bit too much though and had to thin it with additional cream and broth. Whatever, it worked, and yes I am a peppercorn freak! Served it with the mashed potatoes, hearty grain bread and sugar snap peas, good merlot, and a lovely dinner for 3 was had on a deck in New Hampshire. Delicious and a delight, I nibbled at the sauce, steak and bread for quite some time.

I love unusual combinations of ingredients and this recipe surely met my criteria. The steak was infused with the flavor of the marinade. The marinade was far better than I had expected. I did make the sauce which had a nice contrasting flavor but the steak is just as delicious without it. A big hit at my house!

Rating: 3
Made this on the sauce on the weekend (decided to forego the marinade). Sauce was very easy and tasty, but I did have to thicken with cornstarch (reduced longer than suggested but that didn't do it). The sauce had QUITE a bite at first; seemed to taper off after sitting a while (either that or we got used to it, with the help of some wine).

I have made this dish twice times when I had guests . It was a hit both times. The second time I made it, I marinaded the steak for three days, which I thought enhanced the dish. I used the leftover sauce in a omelet. I cooked a small portion of hot sausage (one-half of a Hillshire Farms hot link) which I then finely ground in the food processor. I filled the omelet with the sausage and uncooked baby spinach, putting a little of the sauce both in and on top of the omelet.

Very good recipe! For people who are concerned with the alcohol involved, you can't really taste it. My husband and I HATE BEER and don't really drink, but for some reason alcohol and meat goes really well together!(My mother used to put it in her BBQ sauce as well!) It burns out the alcohol content if I recall correctly. Anyway, Loved the recipe, husband who doesn't drink at all asks for it all the time! So just TRY it! For MOST, its well worth it!

I usually don't marinate steaks, but I bought a large package of a lesser cut(blade steaks) on sale and decided to try this. It turned great. Marinated over night and grilled on the gas Weber, few minutes per side on high. Very flavorful, and pretty tender too. Served with mashed potatoes. Not quite the same as a top-quality New York strip, but made a delicious dinner for four for the price of one!

Fabulous marinade (but you have to like sweet) the sauce however was medicore - I think I'll go back to my other recipes for that. I found the sauce to thin - too cream flavoured and not enough peppercorn or other flavours. I followed the directions precisely & even measured to make sure the reduction had reached the right level but still found the flavour lacking. My husband however liked it & felt that it took the edge of the sweetness of the meat (but his fav flavour is CREAM). I'll use the marinade again but not the sauce.

This was delicious. I used sirloin instead of the New York strip, because it's not as costly. I cooked this only for the two of us, so I halved the marinade but made all of the peppercorn sauce. The sauce was JUST enough for the two steaks, if you can believe that. I can't imagine it being enough for the specified six servings. I only had 1 and 1/4 cups of chicken stock, so I just added extra beef stock. I also didn't buy the peppercorn mix-- I had a premixed pepper blend that contained a bit of salt and garlic. I substituted that, and it was very flavorful, if a bit salty. I served the steaks with the suggested mashed potatoes, and homemade caesar salad, then added a blueberry peach cobbler for dessert. Yum!
