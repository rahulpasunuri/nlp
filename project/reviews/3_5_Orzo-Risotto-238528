I'm not a big fan of risotto but I loved this side dish. Will definitely be making this again.

This is destined to be a family favourite. Excellent fresh, and leftover too. I did add some white wine at the saute phase, and I think that was good. It's great fresh, and a day later too. I was not disappointed at all.

I was a little apprehensive about using pasta instead of rice to make risotto but ended up being pleasantly surprised as many of the reviews stated. This will definitely be one of my 'go-to' pasta dishes. I made a few modifications and it turned out exceptional. First, I cut the amount of butter by half and added a half tbsp to the melting butter. Then I also used only about half the liquid, and used approx 1 cup water, 1 cup vegetable broth, and 1 cup milk. Added additional liquid as needed until pasta was soft. The lemon peel really makes this dish zing! 4 Forks up!!

This was indeed very, very good and quite easy. I followed the advice of previous reviewers and 1) cut the recipe in half, 2) used less butter, 3) added wine after sauteing the orzo, and 4) used broth instead of water. The lemon zest really did add quite a bit.

This was fantastic and easy! I did add some white wine before the stock,and stirred in some chopped fresh spinach at the end, other than that followed the recipe exactly. I also halved the recipe once and it still worked beautifully. Highly recommend.

Side dish for Lime and Thyme chicken. Substituted chicken stock for water and did need any salt. Instead of lemon peel, used lime. So creamy and delicious. Will make again (and again and again...)

This is an excellent base recipe to customize. I made it as is and it was delicious, though a bit salty. Not sure if it's because I used salted butter.

It took forever for the orzo to absorb the liquid. Next time I will add the liquid a little at a time as one does in rice risotto. I also used chicken stock in place of water.

I made this for my parents and we liked it very much. Took reviewers' advice and used chicken stock. It's good to put fat content in perspective - a litte more than 2 teaspoons of butter per serving - and it's not something you eat every day. (Actually, the half- recipe I made could have easily served 5 - reducing fat per serving even more.)

My husband and guests loved this recipe. Made a few modifications.... instead of water I used organic chicken broth and added some grated Parmigiano-Reggiano at the end.

This is absolutely fabulous, period. Make it exactly per the recipe and you won't dissapoint. It is super fatty, so it will be an occasional treat but definitley one I'd make for company.

Delicious and simple! My husband loved it, this will absolutely be a repeated side dish. I followed the recipe with one exception, I did not use thyme.

Rating: 3
This was very good. I used olive oil instead of butter, added 1/2 c dry white wine before the broth and let the orzo absorb it, used vegetable broth, fresh thyme and rosemary, stirred in freshly grated parm-reggiano at the end and drizzled lightly with truffle oil. Easy to prepare and went very well with fresh halibut and grilled asparagus.

I used chicken broth as well as well as about a 1/2 cup of white wine. When completed I used a grana padano. Absolutely delicious! The lemon zest, thyme and cheese were heavenly! The ease of this recipe totally belies what a great dish it is.

I used 1 qt of chicken broth and 2 cups of water. I also added grated asiago cheese and asparagus pieces that were cooked separately to just crisp-tender. I cut back the butter to 3 Tbs as another reviewer suggested. The lemon was very nice with the chicken and asparagus; it made the dish. We had it as a light entee, so it really needed the substance of the cheese and chicken broth. Next time I might even add cubed chicken or ham.

I used chicken broth instead of water as others have suggested and I excluded the lemon peel and thyme. It was an easy, relatively quick recipe to make. Next time I may add other vegetables, ie spinach, roasted eggplant to add more variety but great side dish.

This gets 4 forks for being both tasty and very, very easy to make with stuff i usually have on hand. I make it with half as much butter as the recipe calls for, and chicken broth instead of water, and I don't use the thyme. Once it's done I stir in some coarsely grated parm. Fantastic as leftovers, too.

This is a pretty easy dish and with the adjustments, makes a nice lighter version of risotto. Olive oil instead of butter, lotsa garlic, chicken stock and a nice hard cheese shredded into the pot and stirred in at the last minute. A little more on each serving for presentation.

Easy and delicious. I didn't add the lemon peel but thought it was overall a very tasty and buttery side dish. Warms up very well the next day.

My husband CRAVES this. MUST be made with chicken broth instead of the water called for. I don't measure my butter, just add as needed, but mine has never turned out greasy as others have commented. But I may end up using less than the recipe calls for.

I put 4 forks with the additions I had made. As others stated...a great base...but I added fresh tomatoes, fresh spinach, creole seasoning, capers...a whole slew of things to kick it up...yes, a little too much butter, I'm more of an olive oil user, but next time I'll know...got a nice steak grilling, so it'll be a fabulous meal!

I loved the texture of this dish but added sundried tomatoes and pesto to add some zing. Great basic recipe that I will use to add my favorite pasta ingredients to in the future.

Very good & fast. Like other reviewers, I did not use as much butter and substituted chicken stock for the water. Provides the sense of risotto without the cream and fat.

This is a staple in our house. I do use butter (but about half of what the recipe calls for - so I have never experienced the greasiness others spoke about). I also use chicken stock rather than water, and top with whatever firm Italian cheese I have on hand. My husband asks for this as a side dish at least once a week. He would eat just a big plate of it if I would make it for him!

My sister and I made this. It's OK, but not a special dish, it is a bit bland. We also added parmesan to give it a boost. Considering you need 5 fresh ingredients on hand and the chopping involved for that, plus the 30 minute cooking time, it's a high maintanence dish that doesn't deliver a memorable side dish.

I couldn't disagree more. It's a fantastic little side dish that is a lot less work than risotto, (what prep work?) less rich, and a perfect side dish. I never use as much butter as any recipe says and where the heck is the oil people are talking about? Without the lemon it can be not as good so make sure you put it in. I will make this forever. I also always add parmesan.

Couldn't disagree more with the last few reviews. This is a simple and delicious side dish. of COURSE it's not risotto. But it's made LIKE risotto. I have never found it greasy or bland. The lemon peel, salt, and parsley make it a delightful side dish that is half the work of risotto. I'll be making this one forever.

This isn't risotto. Risotto is made with rice. And, whatever, you want to call it, it's not very good. Greasy, bland, and very boring.

I also used chicken broth, added some pine nuts and Parm. cheese. Nice little side dish.

I too found this dish very bland...we added freshly grated parmesan cheese and it was much better....

This is a winner. Every time I've made it it has turned out beautifully and guests have raved.

i've been making something similar for years, substituting olive oil for butter and using white wine in addition to chicken STOCK (homemade, so much more flavor than broth and no salt)

This was fine, not amazing, but just fine. I used chicken broth instead of water, a bay leaf and a handful of freshly grated Parmesan cheese to give it some extra flavor. Because it was so easy and my family liked it, I will make it again.

Used olive oil instead -- less greasy that way. Next time I'd definitely boost the flavor. I love orzo, but this was pretty bland as-is. Maybe I'll try the fresh basil and maybe some rosemary.

I didn't love this recipe. It was really greasy so if I cook it again, I will decrease the amount of butter/oil.

Rating: 0
I always cook orzo in this method but use considerably less butter (1 to2 T) and chicken broth. I stir in cheese (whatever goes with that night's dinner) and freshly ground black peppers to finish. Everyone, especially my rice/pasta loving 10 year old, loves it.

I made this recipe as written and was not overly impressed. It was not bad but did seem like a lot of prep work for just an okay dish. There was way too much butter, especially when served with the shrimp, which is cooked with a lot of olive oil, the champagne-shallot sauce, which is also very heavy on the butter, and the green beans, which, surprise surprise, are also prepared with butter. If I were to make it again, I would try to lighten the recipe, but it's unlikely to make it out of my recipe box for another occasion.

So much work, for so little taste. Pretty side dish, but VERY bland (and I'm Norwegian and I like bland!) Won't make again.

I scaled this down for my husband and I by using 1/3 cup orzo and 1 cup chicken broth. It was wonderful, will do this again.
