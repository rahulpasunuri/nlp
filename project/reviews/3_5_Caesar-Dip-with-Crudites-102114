More of a dip base than a finished recipe, IMO. It was awesome with the juice of a whole lemon, extra parm, a couple additional garlic cloves, a very generous glop of dijon mustard, and 2 more anchovies plus some of their oil, though. Rather than attempting to mash the anchovies, I blended them with a hand blender in the lemon juice & dijon before combining with the rest of the ingredients. Mister H, who professes to hate anchovies, loved this dip, so the additional fillets definitely didn't overpower. It's worth using microplaned parm reg for this dip.

I made this recently for a dinner party. It was a huge hit. It disappeared so quickly that I hardly got a taste it. Be sure to do the crouton sticks...fabulous!

This recipe has become a standard for girls night parties.... who doesn't love caesar salad. I also will serve with very small inner leaves of romaine. I've thinned the leftovers with milk or water and used as a dressing. Also great to dip olive oil potato chips...

I modified this recipe slightly since I'm a vegetarian. Because I left out the anchovy, I upped the parmesan cheese, lemon and garlic, and added Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper. Then I added kelp granules that I had on hand to give it that sea-flavor complexity that the anchovy would give it. Turned out great! Also worked perfect with full-fat mayo and low-fat sour cream - the dip was still rich and creamy. Delicious with blanched and chilled sugar-snap peas, too!

If you are going to include veggies with a dip for a party appetizer, this is a great choice. I got alot of compliments, and it was great. People usually go for the more indulgent appetizers at a party, but for those of us who want the raw veggies, this is perfect and looks pretty. I used other reviewer's ideas such as using romaine lettuce leaves for a dipper. I also toasted up some pumpernickel and sourdough bread for "crouton" dippers.

This is a great dip. Everyone loved it. Tried it with red bell peppers and romaine leaves. Nice departure from the standard onion dips.

made this dip as written and served it with the romaine hearts, crouton sticks as well as crudites. It was a big hit and my thanks to the previous reviewers for the crouton stick/romaine heart suggestion, I would never have thought of that.

Just made this dip last night for a party at my house and everyone was asking for the recipe. I used FF sour cream, light mayo, a few extra drops of lemon juice and some worcestershire sauce, plus all the other ingredients. I served it with the romain hearts, other veggies, and home- made crouton sticks. It was Delish!

I made this dip and added just a little more pepper and lemon juice for an extra zing. Everybody LOVED it. Even the non veggie eaters. It is a special request at evey party I go to.

This is soooo good! I made this and the creamy sun-dried tomato aioli from this site with a large assortment of crudites for a family gathering (I should mention that we're all garlic fans) Everyone loved including the kids. Thanks to the reviewers who provided the inspired ideas for the romaine roll-ups and the crouton sticks. They gave a unique flair to the whole presentation! This is definitely going in the recipe box!

Was looking for something new to accompany the crudites this holiday. This is fresh and delicious with a perfect balance of sharp and smooth flavors. I used both anchovy paste and a dash of Worcestershire sauce. This is our new favorite!

Really good. Use about 4 anchovies, 1 tablespoon worcestershire, 1/2 tsp. dijon. Cut a county loaf into thick stips, brushed on mixture of olive oil/melted butter/garlic, and toasted in oven - great for dipping. Also included on platter: olives, red & yellow peppers, belgian endive, blanched asparagus spears, genoa salami, thinly sliced italian ham, carrots, and chunks of parmesan. What's not to like.

I received many complements on this dip. The anchovy really gave it a kick. I served this dip with cut up yellow and red peppers, jicama, bok choy (very unusual taste) and the standbys carrots and celery. The remaining dip I thinned out and used on a salad!

I also substituted Worchestershire sauce for anchovies and I added a bit of Dijon ...yum

A really great, easy dip. I used a few dashes of Worcestershire (maybe a 1/4 teaspoon?) instead of anchovies. The dip tastes exactly like Caesar dressing, but toned down for a dip. It's a great change from the standard ranch dip. Whatever you do, make sure you serve it with the baby Romaine leaves. It's a perfect complement, plus it's kind of unique and fun. I also made large croutons from french and pumpernickel breads. After all, you can't have Caesar salad without croutons. I served carrots, celery, and bell pepper too, but nobody ate much of those; the Romaine and croutons were too great with it.

This was definitely the hit of the party. Everyone asked for the recipe! I doubled the cheese, the garlic and used anchovy paste. A keeper, for sure!

Here I am looking for this recipe to make for the third time. It seems that we always make a veggie platter for those watching their weight, so I substituted reduced fat mayo and sour cream. This dip is great for chips too! Really big crowd pleaser!

Made it for New Year's Day and served it with steamed asparagus, green beans, bell peppers and hearts of romaine. Used a few teaspoons of anchovy paste instead of the anchovy, and replaced a large part of the mayonnaise and sour cream with low-fat plain yogurt. Very tasty.

Made this tasty dip for Christmas--after the usual spinach, dill, and French Onion regulars this was met with enthusiasm by all. Very easy to make and tasty with vegetables. A winner

This was too easy to be so good! The anchovy would not mash, so I put the sour cream (low fat) in a mini-processor with the 'chovies and they pureed quite nicely. I used full-fat mayo and the dip tastes great!

Simple and tasty dip. Perfect with raw veggies. I made it with a very good grade of parmesan which I hand grated. Added an extra tablespoon of lemon juice.

My mom and I made this for a party and LOVED it. Everyone else loved it too. It was really simple and easy. I think I may use this recipe for salad instead of the traditional recipe.

So successful, we had to call it the "addictive dip". Great, easy, anchovy can easily be forgotten.

After having read the reviews, I modified the recipe by using less mayonaise and more sour cream. (Actually, I used creme fraiche instead of sour cream). I also used two garlic cloves instead of one, and Worcester sauce instead of anchovy. Everyone liked it as a dip, although it seemed rather runny. However, everyone loved the dip when I used the uneaten portion as a salad dressing.

Had this dish with Cheffie Howard of Jersey City-he reviewed this recipe in 2001.It was heavenly, delicious and addicting. Everyone dipped veggies, chips, whatever ws on hand. I will make this at my next party. Thanks Howard!

Great dip on used with veggies, even spread on hamburger...makes nice dressing in a pinch. Can extend it graciously with plain yogurt, for more of a zingy taste.

I made this for a party and even though I liked it, my guests passed it over ... either the other food was better or this just didn't hit the spot! The baby lettuce is a nice touch (looked great on the serving tray)!

The dip was very disappointing. I added SIX anchovies and it still just tasted like mayo to me. Maybe my anchovies were too weak?? This is not a keeper.

This was excellent the first time I made it and everyone raved about it. The second time I used a larger anchovy and the dish was overpowered by that taste. Use a small anchovy and it's great!

i allowed the dip to sit for an hour before serving. i cut the spine out of romaine lettuce leaves, rolled, and toothpicked. a fun alternative to a salad and allows for snacking at the bar while the main entrees are wrapping up. next time i'll use two anchovy.

Heavenly and totally addictive! I followed the recipe once, and now I just improvise the amounts as needed. It's an amazing salad dressing: I omit the sour cream, use anchovy paste and more lemon juice. I cannot recommend this enough. I don't even eat Caesar salad at restaurants anymore - no comparison.

I made this dip for an office party and everybody loved it! I put in a little more sour cream and a little less mayonnaise, and, of course, more garlic. I also used Worcestershire instead of the anchovy fillet as I was trying to use what I had on hand. I served it with fresh snow peas and it was great and it was so easy to make!

I just tried this recipe and found it to be uninteresting. The flavor was no match for the vegtables. I kept adding ingrediants to try to bring up the flavor but never got to anything worthwhile.

I have made this numerous times and it's become one of my most requested recipes. It's very easy and quick to prepare, so it makes a great appetizer for impromptu get-togethers. The flavor is a little better if it can rest for a half hour or more before serving, but it is still quite good even if you must serve it immediately.

Delicious. Recieved rave reviews. slightly too sharp. Next time, I will decrease the amount of Parmesan cheese.

I loved this recipe and so did all my guest! I have made it several times and really feel the secret to getting really great flavor is to make it a day or two ahead. Makes all the difference in the world.

Dip had a very heavy texture and a strong taste; no one knew what to do with the lettuse, they thought it was a lot of garnish instead of a dipper!

I made this dip for my daughter's 3rd bday party-kids and adults loved it! I did, however, add a few more anchovies as it was pretty bland--and I also used more parmesan than was called for.

The anchovies gave this a nice kick. This also made a yummy salad dressing.
