I made this dish with chicken breasts and adapted the recipe to make a chutney-like sauce with the vinaigrette ingredients. I sauteed the shallots and garlic until soft and added the golden raisins and sherry and vinegar and boiled until reduced to a syrupy consistency and then added some olive oil. It was delicious!

I used a different but similar rub; however, I had to add my two cents to the vinaigrette discussion...It's WONDERFUL! I can understand being surprised if one is expecting a typical gravy-type sauce. But the name is vinaigrette and the ingredients certainly are vinaigrette, right? It is a fabulous and interesting compliment to the pork, especially with the marinated raisins. My friends think I'm a fabulous cook, when it is actually the great recipes I get from epicurious :)

The pork was great - will definately try this cut again and was very moist and cooked perfectly. However the rub was not great (I used the exact ingredients) and the vinaigrette was awful! I love the ingredients individually but didn't work together at all. Try another rub/sauce.

Made this today for Christmas dinner and everyone agreed this was an excellent dish. I noticed that one ready commented that the vinaigrette taseted odd, but i'm guessing that's becuase they may have used cream sherry instead of dry sherry. IMHO, the vinaigrette took the roast from wow, to WOW! I'll definately be adding this to my regular recipe rotation when cooking for a crowd.

The roast is FANTASTIC. It was a huge hit. The vinagrette is okay - it doesn't ever emulsify so that's a big drawback for me. Couple of small changes - had to put some water in the bottom of the roast pan [roast was on a rack] because the spice rub was burning and smoking. Suggestion: maybe incorporate raisins, sherry, etc. into a gravy. The flavours were good but the vinaigrette was a bit too weird for me.

This was decent, but much too vinegary for my taste; combined with the rub, there was much too much going on at once. I made it with tenderloin, so I'm not sure if that was part of the problem.

Great Recipe. I made this in an 18qt Roaster Oven on my boat, it took a little longer than the 1-25min, but I used my meat thermometer to 140 and it was spot on. We served 8 for dinner along w/Yucca/onions and Sangria. Wonderful Spanish Dinner.

I have made this twice now with a 5 rib and 8 rib roast and each time it was great. The vinaigrette does take the dish to the top. First time I made it I used regular raisins and thou it was OK the golden raisins are a much better fit.....more mellow flavor and sweeter. The smoked paprika is a must also. It adds a silky, background flavor which enhances the flavor. Also goes so well with the sherry vinaigrette.

The vinaigrette takes it to 4 forks. Otherwise a fairly nice rub/crusted porkloin (oh yeah I used a tenderloin) that kept the insides very moist and juicy. But the pairingwith the vinaigrette took it to a whole nuttha level. Beautiful contrast. I'm from Toronto where ice wine often takes the place of sherry which it did in this recipe too, so that might have something to do with it. Also I used dried apricots since I didn't have yellow raisins which fit right in! Yum yum. served with haricots with romesco sauce and rice.

I made this exactly as stated. We used a four-pound roast and it was so good that our five diners, who normally aren't heavy meat eaters, left the bones very clean. Served with a Douro wine, grilled scallions with Romesco sauce; started with Asturian bean stew with clams. Por picar, at the beginning, some idiazabal cheese soaked overnight in olive oil, rosemary, thyme, and garlic, with good hearty slices of peasant bread (went perfectly with some Manzanilla sherry.) Ended this special Spanish dinner with fig cake and slices of manchego. World-class.

This was amazing. The butcher was reluctant to sell me a roast with the bone in, so I used boneless. I couldn't find smoked paprika, so I substituted Club House La Grille Spicy Mesquite seasoning for most of the paprika and omitted the salt. My guests really liked it.

I am rating this because although I did not make the recipe exactly, nobody else has rated it and I think I replicated the flavor accurately. For an easier everyday version (and lower fat), I substituted 2 pork tenderloins for the rib rack, and only made 1/4 the amount of the rub which was sufficient to coat both of them. I seared them in a hot pan and put it in the oven at 425 for about 15 minutes (140 degrees internal temp). For the vinaigrette, I made the full amount, but halved the oil, and it was plenty oily. The extra vinaigrette went well with my sides, the "mustard greens with cumin" from this site and some sliced roasted delicata squash. My husband asked what the rub was & we both really enjoyed this. Be sure to use smoked Spanish paprika to get the proper flavor. Enjoy!
