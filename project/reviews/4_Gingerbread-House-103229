I have been making Gingerbread houses for about 30 years, and have been searching for a good recipe just as long. Until last year when I came across this recipe. This recipe bakes the way you cut it, and is very sting. No more collapsing sides or roofs, this dough is great.

I used this recipe for a professional gingerbread house competition. We made 8 batches of dough, which weighed over 36 lbs (!) and it was perfect. Held up perfectly, no issues whatsoever with cracking or breaking. A must-do when making anything of this size, we also used melted sugar to cement the pieces together (granulated sugar and water, heated over high until caramel color, stirring occasionally). The gingerbread was a great color and smelled great, but also had a very good taste (not my very favorite, but the perfect compromise between taste and strength). Since we weren't using this recipe for cookies, I couldn't be any happier with choosing to use this. Photos and more details in link: http://katiebuss.wordpress.com/2012/12/10/gingerbread-house-competition/ For ease of recipe, strength and overall look, this recipe was perfect.

The cookies are not only tasty but the perfect texture for gingerbread construction. After a few years of propping the walls and roof up with cans for hours while the royal icing dried, I learned the trick of dipping the edges of the cookie panels into melted sugar instead. The sugar hardens within seconds, tastes good, and can easily be hidden with decorations. It takes an entire day out of the construction time. But please be careful--melted sugar is like napalm, it sticks to your skin and causes terrible burns and scars, as evidenced by my forearms. My kids, who are now old teenagers, still look forward to gingerbread house decoration as much as they did when they were little.

This is a great recipe. I added a third more of everything and it was just enough to building a 6x8x10 apartment building. My only suggestion: If you don't want to use up a whole roll of parchment paper, just use several Silpat mats. I rolled out the dough on my large mat, then placed a baking mat (upside down) on top, then placed the cookie sheet on top of that and flipped the whole thing over. My cookies remained in the exact same shape and the Silpat pat peeled off easily.

This is the best gingerbread recipe I have ever tried. Simple and easy to do as long as you set aside three days to make this house. Parchment paper is an absolute must, makes rolling out the dough and cutting the shapes so easy. I made 1 1/2 times this recipe and I was able to make a huge house with extra dough to make about two dozen gingerbread cutouts. I accidentally added TABLESPOON measures of the ginger and cinnamon instead of teaspoon measures....I am glad that I did. The dough was wonderfully spicy and tasted like the best gingersnap cookie you can imagine.If you like a nicely strong ginger flavor--add tablespoons not teaspoons of ginger and cinnamon. I also added powdered clove spice instead of cardamom-it was wonderful. Highly recommend using clove. Also, I would recommend using salted butter instead of shortening. My cookies had so much more flavor and it is better for you than shortening. One more thing, I baked the walls and roof for almost twenty minutes. Make sure the center of the gingerbread is mostly FIRM to the touch before taking it out of the oven. Made for a very strong house. If you make cookies, 9 minutes is great and makes a lovely, soft texture. The icing is superb, but does not taste very good. However, that said...It makes a rock hard glue for the house, which is excellent. Love it!! Will make this every year.

Wish I could give 3.5 stars. This is not your typical cardboard-like gingerbread. It has more of a cookie texture which I love. Perhaps the best texture I've tasted in gingerbread. I'm not a huge g-bead fan, so I have tried to find something more palatable since I LOVE the tradition. I was making my first-ever g-bread house and I was amazed at how easy it was. I made my own pattern and made a HUGE house, using 1 1/2 times the recipe. I rolled out the dough quite thin, but when overcooked just a bit, it was quite strong. After about a week, it had developed some cracks but those are fixable and I was surprised at how well it stood up in the first place. Overall, I really liked the dough, the texture and the durability. It could use a bit more spices (for me I liked it mild for the kids) and possibly more sugar if it is going to be eaten plain. If you are looking for more traditional bread-like texture of g-bread, I don't think this recipe is for you. Most important tip: Make it relatively thin and as others have said, Use the PARCHMENT.... so, so, much easier. I think I will do that for all my cutout cookies!

I'm like a giddy little kid. I made this house today and it turned out to be the cutest, and it was suprisingly easy. I was going to buy a prebaked house to decorate, but decided to try baking my own with the notion if it fell apart, I'd just go out and buy one. Well, I don't have to. I followed this recipe exactly as written, including making the templates. The only thing I did different was I used caramelized sugar as the glue. It bonded like cement in about 30 seconds. My house is rock solid!! To make the caramelized sugar, I used 2 cups sugar and 1/2 cup water for more than enough glue. Don't be afraid to make this house...this is so much fun. Thank you for this wonderful recipe and all the wonderful memories it will produce over the years. Linda

We made three 12" gingerbread houses using this recipe and directions. Perfect! The finished houses with their embellishments were just stunning. I was glad we started a day ahead of schedule to make the gingerbread. That way the girls were able to get started on their assembly and embellishments.

We first made this recipe when it came out in 2000, and it has become a family tradition. Every year on the Friday after Thanksgiving, we have a house full of people assembling gingerbread houses! The recipe is easy! We've used Nilla wafers for roof tiles instead of cutting out all the circles. Or be creative w/shredded wheat squares or Necco wafers. It's amazing what the kids can think of!

I have a bakery where we offer gingerbread house decorating. I make the houses from this recipe and NEVER have a problem. It smells sublime and it makes a really great house. The color is uniform, the dough is easy to work with and bakes up nice and firm. I use my own template and this single recipe makes A LOT of dough - I get 3+ smallish (9") houses out of it. The recipe makes a ton for all those roof tiles. The absolute most paramount advice I can give anyone making this is to use parchment paper, roll the dough on the parchment, cut ON THE PARCHMENT, and pull away the excess dough. I have high school girls make, roll, and cut the dough and they could do it with ease from the very beginning. Allow it to cool on the parchment (still on the cookie sheet) and pull away when COMPLETELY COOLED. BTW - it also makes super tasty cookies if you roll it out a little thinner.

I've always wanted to make a GH, but was nervous I bit off more than I could chew. Not so with this recipe. Great consistency of dough, great flavor, and not so terribly time consuming to assemble, thanks to other reviewers' suggestion to use carmelized sugar as glue (thank you!). Icing was quick and lovely too.

Honestly, this recipe didn't do much for me. The spices were far too subdued, and the dough crumbled too easily when trying to move the pieces to the baking pan.

A key learning for me when making gingerbread houses is remove baked pieces from the oven and while still warm and somewhat soft place the template on the baked dough and use a sharp slicing knive to trim up the dough edges along the template lines. This makes construction so much easier! Another tip I discovered was to partially decorate the sides prior to construction - for example, if I want to create a wreath around a cut out "windon" it is much easier to do it and the results are prettier if done while the wall piece is lying flat on the surface. This also speeds up the whole decorating and construction process.

I have used this recipe three years in a row to rave reviews. I don't follow the construction instructions any more, although it's probably worth doing if you're making your first ever house. The dough is perfect, and makes nice stiff cookies that hold up well as a centerpiece through the holidays. I make my royal icing with meringue powder, since that's less likely to make my kids sick if they nibble on the house when I'm not looking. The Wilton website has the recipe. It dries stiff enough that our house holds up to two-year-olds leaning on it while they decorate. The recommendation to make this house over several days is an excellent one. Another trick is to use soup cans on either side of the wall pieces to hold them up while the icing sets.

This recipe was fantastic. Though I had to add a bit of extra molasses to make it moist enough to roll out, once it was the right consistency it was wonderful. It baked dry and rigid enough to build a very sturdy house with, yet was just soft enough to make a good, chewy cookie. Construction properties aside, the gingerbread was delicious. I did replace the cardamom with a bit more cinnamon, though I doubt it made much difference in the end.

I haven't tried it yet but would always partially bake the dough before cutting it. This guarantees the shapes will fit together when fully baked.

Love this recipe! Yummy! Substituted butter for shortening - shortening scares me. And I didn't want to measure out seven or eight cups of powdered sugar for the icing (an inevitable mess!), but I used a little less than two pounds. Made five mini-gingerbread houses, which were perfectly crisp, and about three dozen drop cookies, which were perfectly soft! It was a production, so I would separate the process over a couple days. But well worth the time!

I made this last year and it was wonderful. I made a huge house and had to make 4 batches of the dough....the roof tiles used way more than I expected. Melted suger is the only way to stick something this big together and it worked great!

This recipe was actually pretty easy to make. The dough initially turned out a little too dry but after reviving it with water, it was just fine. We actually made a very complex house that was a replica of an actual house so using caramelized sugar (as some reviewers previously suggested) to put the house together proved extremely useful. The only caveat I can add is that we followed the recipe the previous reviewer suggested and ended up with a great deal of sugar left over. Otherwise, everything went perfectly and we even had enough dough left over to make some small cookies and they were yummy as well!

I loved all the tips. Here are mine: (1) no need to refrigerate dough; just roll out on parchment, cut, remove the scraps and transfer the whole thing to a baking sheet and bake; (2) cover your templates with parchment; (3) Use a pizza wheel to cut out the pieces and once baked, place the template back over the pieces and trim them for perfect edges; (4) Carmelized sugar works well; (5)substitute powdered meringue for raw egg in the royal icing; (6) inverted sugar cones decorated with jelly beans make great pine trees.

My family used this recipe for our first gingerbread house and it turned out wonderful! The dough smells divine and the icing was perfect and easy to glue the pieces together. Rolling the dough between parchment paper was the best tip ever! I prepared the icing as directed, and it came out very stiff, so I may have to cut back on the powdered sugar. We live in a very dry climate and it set up quite quickly. I fonund it easy to roll out the dough into a rectangle if I put the pieces of dough into plastic freezer bags and mashed them into the shape. Rolling went quick and they stacked easier in the fridge for chilling. It does take time, but well worth the effort.

To those of you who had trouble with crumbly dough, it really doesn't need to be refrigerated before rolling out as long as parchment paper is being used. I made this the same way I do my sugar cookies - roll out between parchment as soon as it comes out of the mixer, cut the pieces, remove excess, then put the whole thing - cookie sheet and all- in the refrigerator or freezer until firm. Then it goes straight in the oven. Thinner cookes spread very very little with this method, but the 1/4" thick for this house still spread a little. Overall good recipe for the gingerbread. Cookies turned out tasty and dough was easy to work with (my way). Used meringue powder to make the icing so no raw eggs for the kiddos.

this is my first gingerbread house experience. i loved using the parchment paper to roll out the dough and for transfering the cut pieces to the cookie trays. i cut the shapes before i cooked them but i know some people cut the shapes right after sheets of dough come out of the oven. it was a bit tricky getting the dough to the oven without it warping a bit and as it cooked it did rise and and the edges got rounded. if you are after the perfect gingerbread house, you might get the flatest edges (and then easiest to assemble) if you cut after cooking. i didn't use any cardboard for assembling except three templates cut from cereal boxes. i loved loved loved using the caramelized sugar to assemble. all i did was dump a cup of sugar in a pot and add enough water to get the sugar wet. then i cooked it over high heat long enough for it to stop splashing and start turning caramel color. i tested how well it worked using two toothpicks. i think the longer you cook it the faster it hardens. i feel like my little house is rock solid but i did burn a finger with a carmel drip.

This turned out wonderfully, and thank goodness for the reviewer who suggested using caramelized sugar to glue the house together! Thank you thank you thank you!! It worked amazingly well, held fast, and instantly bonded. I used 4 1/2 cups sugar, 1 cup water, and 1/3 cup light corn syrup (basically the recipe for glaceed fruit on this website). You could make half, though, and still have enough caramel for the house. My only quibble is that I wish they'd given a frosting recipe that didn't have raw eggs and was still good to decorate the house with, as the kids and I intend to eat the house (I think it's a colossal waste of food, otherwise). The bits of house were pretty good to eat, too. The magazine version has the templates, but we just used pre-bought cookie-cutter-templates that had come in a kit.

Just responding to some of the reviews: You can order the templates for this house from Jane's Cakes and Chocolates, 2331 Honolulu Avenue, Montrose, CA 91020 (or 800-262-7630). Also, the other reviewers eat this, but the royal icing is raw eggs that have been sitting at room temperature. I assume that reconstituted (pasteurized) egg whites can be used instead, but even those shouldn't be eaten after sitting at room temperature (the way this house can be for up to a month). Bon Appetit has a really good Christmas cookie recipe from the Dec. 1995 issue -- the cookies taste better than the house.

My decade (+) quest for a good gingerbread house recipe has finally come to an end!!! I have been making gingerbread houses since 1992 and every year I try a different recipe. This one is without a doubt the best recipe I have ever found. I usually don't like gingerbread dough (raw or baked). But I was surprised to find that I actually did like this particular gingerbread. I made ten small houses for a party along with 15 gingerbread men. The houses were sturdy enough to endure small children's decorating skills. And the gingerbread men were plump and chewy - they were all gobbled up at the party. This recipe is a keeper!

Making this house is no small task. I made this over a three day period, which I found essential. Make sure that you roll out the dough using parchment or plastic wrap (obviously not baking the plastic wrap). I tried to short cut that step and started to panic when the dough was crumbly and impossible to work with. It has also been my experience that it is best to use a cardboard "frame" for the house. We have awoken to find a collapsed house before learning that trick.

This was a totally great recipe and very delicious! The dough was very easy to work with. After reading some reviews on other gingerbread recipes, I was very careful to measure the flour exactly as called for. I found the icing to be too thick so next time I think will put in less icing sugar.

I haven't made this particular, but I make about 2-3 gingerbread houses every holiday season, and have done for the past 20 years. Putting a gingerbread house together with Royal Icing is just asking for trouble. It doesn't hold quickly enough, so you waste a lot of time bracing the pieces and hoping that they'll stick. What I've always done instead is to carmelize about 1/2-1 cup of sugar and use that melted sugar as superglue to construct the house. Use the royal icing to cover up the seams and to stick on the candy. It's far less frustrating for all involved, and (if you're building the house with children) they have a much more stable structure to work on. Obviously, the kids shouldn't be anywhere near the carmelized sugar. That stuff is *hot*!

I made this recipe for my family's annual Christmas Gingerbread House, with templates we already had around the house. This is definitely the BEST Gingerbread recipe I have made, ever. I used Marzipan with food coloring to shape Snowmen and Christmas trees outside the house, used Tootsie Rolls cut into 1/4's (the long way) to make "mini woodpiles," and did "stained glass" windows. (When you are baking the gingerbread, cut out the window shapes and fill with pulverized butterscotch candies. After you put the gingerbread house together, it looks like the warm glow of a fire inside the window! Also, red licorice nibs cut into thin cross-sections make great "roof tiles."

I have made gingerbreadhouses successfully for years once I found the key secrets,bake your dough in sheets and then cut out your pattern when cooled completely, reinforce inside corners of buildings with rectangles of gingerbread and use melted sugar to adhear sides of gingerbread house together. Use white icing ontop, also. These tips will help in very high humitity areas where houses collapse quickly. Have fun!
