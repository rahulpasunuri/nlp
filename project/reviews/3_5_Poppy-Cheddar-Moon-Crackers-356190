I discovered this recipe last Christmas and gave some bag fulls to friends that aren't so fond of the sweets. They loved them & really appreciated the salty alternative. I made trees last time but getting ready to make cheddar fall leaves. I think I'll slightly over brown some for pretty. Now I have to make tomato soup!

Nice and simple to make, really delicious crackers - although not the most crunchy. Excellent for people to nibble on, and a great recipe to take along to a potluck too.

These crackers were excellent, and very easy to make. All of the ingredients are common enough for the semi-frequent chef to have on hand. The break up of actual required work makes them very good to make while busy. Five-ten minutes prep, an hour in the fridge of down-time, and then twenty for rolling, cutting and the oven. They were a huge hit with the family, and are definitely coming to the next Halloween party. :)

This was my first time making crackers. These were very easy to make and turned out beautiful and delicious. When I took my first bite, I realized I'd just made gourmet Cheez-Its. (Not a bad thing!)
