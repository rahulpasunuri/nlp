I made these with laughing cow low fat cheese, which made a delicious spread inside. I did change up the recipe a bit, added 2-3x more cumin, and added in about 1 tbsp of garlic powder along with salt and pepper to taste. In addition, I didn't have serrano pepper so I switched it out for one chopped up jalapeno, which added a bit of zing to the recipe and topped it off with smoked chipotle salsa (no sour cream). I also didn't have canned pinto beans, so soaked dry pinto beans and cooked with that instead. Also, I am a soy milk drinker and so used soy milk instead. I think I erred on the not-enough-liquid side unfortunately, so the texture was a bit dry, but the taste was lovely!!

I agree with the last reviewer. Nothing special. . . I even made the tomatillo salsa to go with it and it was still kinda blah.

I don't agree with other reviewers this time. My husband declared this, "good, but it just tastes like Mexican mush"! The cloves added a nice, interesting flavor, but I won't ever make this again.

My husband said, "If you don't make this dish at least once a week, I'll die." That said, if you're a fan of super-spicy fare like I am, you might want to double up on the serrano peppers. Very yummy.

We have made this dish several times now. Corn tortillas are hard to find in the UK, so at first we used flour, which were okay. Then we found corn tortillas at a local store and this became a firm favourite. The texture is wonderful. I love the clove flavour in the sauce.

I used home-cooked beans, and found this dish quick to assemble and delicious. I didn't measure anything -- just used the ingredients called for, eye-balling the amounts (the ground cloves were omitted). I served it with the tomatillo-avocado salsa.
