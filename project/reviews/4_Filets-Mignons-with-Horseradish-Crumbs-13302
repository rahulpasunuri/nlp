As a fairly new cook, I'm always looking for Epicurious finds that are simple to put together but really delicious. This recipe was no exception. My husband loves horseradish and so I doubled up on the crumbs. Also was generous with the onions, probably using an extra half. Served it with roasted asparagus and a simple salad. Oh, and cabernet.

I made this for my very picky boyfriend AND he LOVED it. Although we later found out that he is allergic to horshradish. Could be a problem. I followed the recipe exactly and it was unreal!

Like the cook from Oakland, I used shallots instead of onion. To make sure the crumbs were DRY I put them in a low oven for a few minutes. Served the steaks with Parsley Leaf Potatoes, sauteed criminis and a spinach and strawberry salad. Good Saturday night fare at home.

Very good! Definitely use DRY bread crumbs--I had to remake the topping because my bread crumbs were not dry enough the first time!

We made this for our New Year's eve dinner. I am by no means an experienced cook (ie, I can just about boil water)and this recipe was very accesable. My roommates and I could not stop raving about the steaks the entire time we ate them!! We did add a little extra horseradish, cooked the filets a little longer (came out medium rare), and doubled the recipe for the glaze. It was a phenomenal result.

EXCELLENT! Everyone raved about this one....

This turned out great and was a nice change from the usual grilled filets mignon wrapped with bacon ;) However the onion absorbed all of the wine--instead saute 2T finely chopped onion and add 1/2 c wine and 1/2 cup beef stock, reduce to thick sauce or glaze.

I actually didn't care for this, but will offer a tip on cooking the filets. Lay a piece of aluminum foil lightly over the skillet for a minute or so before and after turning them. With such thick pieces of meat a little radiant heat helps the cooking process, and mine came out mid-rare using the times suggested.

I have made this dish sevral times, and always to rave reviews. The sauce is wonderful as are the homemade crumbs. I would suggest making extra crumbs and adding them into mashed potatoes.

This is an absolutely delicious recipe. Easy, yet tastes like a dish from a fine steakhouse. My husband thought he had died and gone to heaven!

The couton component is excellent. The onion part is adequate, however prereducing the a half cup of wine with a little bit of rosemary and sugar and then adding it to the onions works much better.

The receipt is outstanding, especially the sauted onions mixture. The onion mixture is relatively easy and works well on other food too such as meatloaf & hamburgers.

Boy, this dish is delicious AND easy to prepare. One dinner guest said it was the best beef dish he'd ever eaten, at home or a restaurant.

I have been making this recipe since 1993 and it ROCKS. Made it again last night for a dinner party and guests raved. As always. Make this recipe - you will not be disappointed. You usually have to cook the steaks for a little longer than stated.

This was fabulous! We made one substitution: shallots instead of onions, and it was superb. I liked the sweet, subtle flavor of them. We loved the breadcrumbs and the contrast of flavor that they offered. They could be paired with any steak, I think. The "glaze" was minimal, but it did saturate the shallots nicely.

Very easy to prepare and very pleasent flavor combination. Really enjoyed the texture contrast of the crunchy crumbs to the butter meat.

We made this recipe last weekend and it was by far, the best steak I have had in a long, long time. We are having guests for dinner this weekend and making them again! We used canned breadcrumbs instead of fresh and it worked perfect. We also used a cast iron skillet to prepare the steaks. I would make this for our gourmet group or any guest. The flavors blend so well. Not too difficult.

This has become a special occasion staple with my family. The breadcrumbs are so good.

My guests loved it! The horseradish crumbs added a nice little bite. Excellent dish....but is Filet Mignon EVER bad?

I agree with some of the other reviewers in that the wine glaze may have been too overpowering. I liked the crumb topping and may use that alone next time. My husband liked the combination of toppings. In fact,he even wanted more onions. I also agree that you have to cook the meat longer.

There are a couple of things I would do differently next time I make this dish. First I would cook the filets about 7 mins. on each side, they were too rare, almost raw. Also, I think I would omit the onion / wine topping - it was a little too overpowering. The horseradish crumb mixture was excellent and I think just that on the filets would be perfect. I will definitely make this again though, just a little different.

I loved this dish! The flavor combinations were superb. I served the steaks with a green salad, and steamed green beans along with some crusty french bread. I would most definitely serve it again, and will use the crumbs on other dishes as well.

I loved this recipe and thought the crumbs were wonderful and the onions tasty. In fact, I served Leek and Cabbage Mashed Potatoes with this and the crumbs were great on this too. My husband wasn't quite as taken with the crumbs as I was. He didn't think they had as strong a horseradish taste as he would have liked.

I would definitely serve this again. My guests thought it was fantastic, and it was easy to do. I prepared the crumbs ahead of time, sliced the onion early in the day and wrapped it up, so all I had to do is heat the pan and cook the steaks.

well, the meat was good of course and so were the bread crumbs. As far as the glaze, it wasn't really a glaze. It was hard to keep the wine from just boiling away. The overall outcome was good, but as far as the directions are concerned I wasn't impressed. Went great with garlic mashed potatoes and corn.
