I also skipped the boiling when I made this for a recent dinner party, and instead sauted the escarole in the olive oil and garlic etc. It turned out beautifully. I finished it with just a touch of balsamic vinegar to foil the bitterness, and everyone loved it!

This is a new variation on a sephardic recipe using spinach.

Yes, there is no braising here! I followed the previous reviewer's suggestion and skipped the boiling step. I also substituted raisins for currants, and forgot to toast the pine nuts and it was fine. I also didn't have any escarole... only joking. I've never made cooked greens before and it was quick, easy, and tasty.

I am a big fan of braised veggies; this may be picky, but there is no braising in this recipe. Also, it is not necessary to boil the escarole. Saute the garlic in olive oil, add the chopped escarole, salt and pepper and cook, lid on, for 3-4 minutes till wilted. Remove the lid and continue to cook for a few minutes longer till water is evaporated and the escarole is tender.
