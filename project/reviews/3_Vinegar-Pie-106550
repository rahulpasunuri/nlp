This is also called Chess pie. Instead of using all-purpose flour try using cornmeal flour. The purpose of the flour is not thicken but it adds a crust to top of the pie. The custard will thicken on it's own. I love this pie it's easy to make. I prefer a cookie crust.

Are you sure it only calls for 1 T flour. It seems that with the liquid and only 1 T flour it would be soupy.

I wonder how it would taste using balsamic vinegar?

I don't really like custard-y stuff, but it wasn't bad.

this wasn't the best pie ever. it was edible, but i wouldn't make it again.

This is an old favorite that I'd lost the recipe to; very glad to find it again. I usually double the vinegar, which makes it just a bit tangier, but not too much so. Try it with raspberry or other fruit vinegars!

I too was so intrigued by this recipe that I had to try it. My husband, the cook, could not identify the secret ingredient but he thoroughly enjoyed the pie. The crust recipe is especially light and fluffy and definitely worth the extra work.

very good. i was surprised at the final result. most thought it was a custard pie. hint: don't tell them the true ingredients until they have taken at least one bite.

I had to make this just to see what it was about--it was wonderful! My family never would have eaten it had I told them beforehand the name of the pie...now they ask me to make it!
