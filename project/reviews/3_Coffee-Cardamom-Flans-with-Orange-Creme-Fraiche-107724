I found the sugar syrup mixture to be insufficient to line 8 custard cups and had to make an additional batch as it sets up so quickly. I also burned myself quite badly on the caramel so be very careful especially if you are using glass custard cups like I did. I've made creme caramel before so I wasn't a novice at doing this, however, I used ceramic custard cups before. I wasn't crazy about the consistency of the flan and the orange creme fraiche was a lot of trouble for not a huge payoff. I did this for a dinner party and most of the guests ate all of theirs but a few left some on the plate - and these are good eaters! I would not bother with this recipe again.
