I used snickers vs. nutrageous, honey vs. corn syrup and light brown sugar vs. dark and French oats vs. old fashioned oats, cant explain the difference but there is!!...living in France, its what I can get!! LOVE these cookies, will most certainly make them again!!!

Great recipe! I substituted Snickers for Nutrageous, and cut the snack sized ones into quarters. These cookies are moist, gooey and have just enough peanut butter and chocolate. 3

I didn't have a candy bar so I just took it out, as well as the corn syrup. I decreased the baking time to 14 min and I didn't freeze them first (only left them in the fridge for like half and hour. I totally loved them and will make again - maybe with chocolate chips and flax seed. Not too sweet and soft on the inside crisp on the outside. My husband is kind of meh about peanut butter coolies and he loved these.

Great 2 part recipe. I substituted parchment paper for foil, and froze the dough on cookie sheets for approximately 9 hours, covered, instead of the 10 or 15 min the recipe calls for. They turned out great. The oatmeal definitely puts a fluffy twist on the original pb cookie!

Good, but not spectacular. Would be better with smooth PB.

Boring. Peanut flavor is barely there, even added 1 tsp of salt to enhance overall flavor. Very time consuming (freezing dough balls-15 min, 20 min cook time. Not worth the hassle. Did come out chewy and moist, but I added 3 TBS of whole milk to batter to achieve this. I do recommend that you increase ball size to 1/4 cup worth (3 TBS), makes a nicer looking cookie. Cookie does run a tad, nothing major, after removing from oven, allow to sit on sheet pan for 5 min of rest, then rack them. This recipe would work nicely with ice cream perhaps? Will continue looking for a more worthwhile recipe for candy bar cookies.

These are incredible! I made them exactly as the recipe said and used Nutrageous bars. Now I have people who would rather have me make these for their birthdays than a cake! I was told by peanut butter cookie lovers that these were the best they had ever tasted!

I used Payday candybars because they had more peanut flavor. The first day, they were pretty good, the next day they tasted rather dry and boring. I wouldn't make them again. Also, placing the large sheets of cookie dough in the freezer is impossible with a side by side type of fridge, so I had to improvise. I agree with others that there are better PB cookie recipes out there

Rating: 2
I used the snickers, and as the last reviewer said, it did make a mess of caramel all over the place (but some people liked those cookies best!). The cookie really was nothing special at all. Kind of dry and boring with melted bubbles of what used to be candy and now are...well unappetizing to me.

Rating: 1
After reading all of the outrageous reviews, I expected a fabulous cookie. I followed the recipe carefully, and the cookies came out dry. I added Snickers bars as suggested in one of the ratings, and the caramel made removing the cookies from the baking sheets extremely difficult. I reccommend following an old family recipe for peanut butter cookies. This recipe was very disappointing.

Rating: 4
This recipe really makes OUTRAGEOUS cookies. I doubled the recipe and used Snickers candy bars. Be careful not to overbake and dry the cookies out. They are delicious! I will certainly bake them again.

I am not a huge fan of peanut butter cookies, but this recipe lived up to it's name--"Outrageous". I made these cookies for co-workers and had many requests for the recipe. It is important to let the cookies chill, otherwise they will get crumbly. I aslo added a little extra of the candy bar. Yummm.

This is probably the BEST cookie recipe I've ever made! Repeat performance this year!

It would be so refreshing if SOMEONE had rated the ACTUAL recipe shown above. When I did a search for Peanut Butter Cookies, I had hoped to find reviews & from cooks who actually made the recipe, not a dialogue about being a vegan. While a discussion on vegan cooking is interesting, in its own right, a REAL recipe review now & then would be far more helpful.

Rating: 0
How could you make these be truly vegan as almost all candy bars with caramel and chocolate contain milk products? Just wondering as I like to make vegan treats for my vegan sister (and she is very strict, no whey or anything). I have used egg replacer by the way, and I think it makes cookies too hard. We have experimented with apple butter or pureed dates in place of some of the fat, and found that it makes a vegan cookie moist and chewy. Another key to vegan cookies seems to be to almost undercook them a bit. Then let them set on the cookie sheet to firm up enough to remove. That way they don't dry out and taste like hockey pucks.

a question for the vegan 'Cook from the midwest' on 07/31/02 who made these vegan with tofu...are you saying you made this recipe twice, once with tofu & once with eggs and you preferred the ones made with tofu...how much tofu did you use in place of the egg...what type of tofu...why did you use tofu instead of egg replacer...questions from a fellow vegan

Rating: 3
Being that I am vegan, I substituded tofu in for the eggs. It really improves the texture. The cookies are moist and there is no problem keeping the dough together. Being of loose morals, I made them the traditional way (with eggs) and it shed light on why others complained about the cookies.

people don't know a good cookie when they taste one!!! This cookie was exceptional except I substituted snickers miniatures. This cookie was chewy and delicious!!!!!! A hit in my book. If they come out hard you probably cooked them too long!

Rating: 1
The cookie's are very dry. The dough didn't hold together well.

I absolutely loved these cookies. I substituted the corn syrup for maple syrup, and as another reviewer recomended, replaced some of the flour for whole-wheat flour. The results where amazing! I think they might be a bit sweet but all-in-all a will-make-again cookie

Rating: 1
No. An "outrageous" waste of time. Many, many better peanut butter cookie recipes out there.

Rating: 2
Very disappointing...average at best!

Rating: 3
These were very good cookies and were gone in one day. I couldn't find Nutrageous candy bars so I substituted Snickers. (The recipe calls for baking soda which tends to make cookies spread rather than puff up so that may be why other reviewers may have found them thin and crisp rather than chewy. If you like chewy cookies, try substituting part of the flour with bread flour.)

I made this cookie the first time for Christmas. It was OK, but I like chewey peanut butter cookies and this one is way too crisp, if baked according to directions. After the first batch, I decreased the baking time, which helped some. Also, the candy bar (I used Snickers) had a tendency to run and become hard and brittle. I will go back to my old recipe when I want peanut butter cookies again.

Rating: 3
The candy bar is unnecessary... this is a sweet-enough cookie on its own. We made them small (teaspoon-size drops) and baked them until crisp. Quite good, although there may be better recipes on Epicurious for the true peanut butter cookie lover.

Rating: 2
This was nothing special. The cookies were dry, and perfectly ordinary. I'll stick with the traditional peanut butter cookie.

Rating: 2
In my opinion, these were just ok. I will return to making the traditional peanut butter cookie next year for Christmas.

Rating: 3
Very very tasty cookie. Not anything like your average peanut butter cookie. If you have a sweet tooth, you must make this recipe. I followed recipe except I did not freeze the dough, and the cookies were still superb! 3.5 Stars!

I would make this recipe again when making peanut butter cookies and it got good reviews but I would change the candy bar to Snickers. It goes overboard with the peanut butter.

Rating: 1
Maybe I had unrealistic expectations, but these were a disappointment. I was expecting a big chewy cookie, but these were hard and dry. As far as I could tell, the candy bar added no real flavor, just calories.

I loved making this cookies recipe but it was tough trying to find Nutrageous candy bars. I substituted Reeses peanut butter cups and some chocolate and carmel candies. It worked great. The other strange thing I found was in a smallish oven cooking 2 trays, 1 on the bottom and 1 on top caused the one on the bottom to cook faster than the one on the top yielding darker brown bottoms and nice golden brown cookies on the top rack. A convection oven would have solved that problem. All-in-all a great cookie.

Rating: 2
These were very good cookies, really 2.5 forks--but I agree that if you are looking for a real "peanut buttery" cookie, you might do better with the traditional type with the fork prints. The next time I might use more peanut butter and maybe Reese's PB cups or Reese's Pieces. They are definitely worth making again.

Rating: 2
I also did not get the awesome reviews on these cookies. They were just "okay" in my book.

Rating: 2
Sorry. I just don't get the ga-ga reviews of these cookies. Yes, they were good but nothing outstanding. I would rather eat a plain old pb cookie with the fork marks on top or a choc chip cookie. Mine were a bit crisp and I like a good chewy cookie. I did use Nutrageous and parchment paper rather than foil. Don't get me wrong; we did manage to eat all of them.

Excellent cookies, tasty and chewy. Will definitely be making them again with my daughter.

made them with butterfingers -- we thought they were fabulous and they got great reviews from friends. did not use (or need) an electric mixer. they are huge -- i would make smaller cookies next time

Rating: 4
These were outrageously delicious! I used Snickers bars because we cannot get nutrageous and they worked well. The only change I would make would be to increase the number of Snickers bars to 4.

Just had these cookies at a friend's house. Ran home and went to your site. Can't wait to make them--they're wonderful.

WOW! The first time I made these I used Butter Finger candy bars and the cookies were so delicious. I just made these "outrageous" cookies again for a gathering and used Nutrageous candy bars. Like I said, WOW! EVEN BETTER!!

One of the greatest cookie recipes out there. The first time I made this, I didn't have Nutrageous, so i added some extra chocolate, peanut butter, and peanuts. EVERYONE SWOONED!!!!! Make these!

Rating: 3
These cookies are very good, considering I altered the recipe as follows: melted 6T butter (they were slightly greasy - would not next time); used white sugar instead of brown (probably was lighter in color and flavor, but it still tasted good); and only used 2 candy bars (would use 3 next time).

Rating: 4
Excellent!! I used low fat, smooth peanut butter and 6 oz. peanut butter chips. Baked for the full 20 minutes for high altitude. Every cookie was memorable!! I also used parchment paper as a liner. Tin foil rips to easily. These cookies need to be removed from the baking pan after 5 minutes or they stick. Once cool, they can be place in a tin with no liners as sticking is minimal. No need to look any farther for recipes.

VERY good & simple to make. I also used Snickers bars in place of the Nutrageous. These are soooo yummy!

I really liked these biscuits. At 14 yrs, these biscuits were not difficult, or time consuming, and of course they were really yummy. I substituted the nutrageous bars, which you cannot get in New Zealand for Snicker bars.

My family was devouring these cookies straight from the oven! We used 5th Avenue candy bars instead of Nutrageous, and they were delicious!

everyone liked the cookies, but until i explained the "outrageous" part...they wanted to just call them peanut butter cookies, and they are not...JUST peanut butter cookies....great!

I would give these cookies a 2.5, if there was such a rating. While they were tasty, I think they were too hard, too crunchy, and that took away from the taste.

I'm not a huge peanut butter fan but I even liked these. I made these as gifts for Christmas and it was a hit. I had co-workers come by and tell me how much they liked it and a couple asked me for the recipes. Easy to make and delicious.
