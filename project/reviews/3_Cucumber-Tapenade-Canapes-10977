Made the canapes just 15 minutes before guests arrived. Very quick and easy. Used hothouse English cucumbers (fewer seeds), jarred black olive tapenade, jarred red pepper strips. The problem was that the canapes were slippery and hard to pick up even though I had waited until the last minute to make them. Toothpicks might have made them easier to pick up. As it was, everyone loved them but they slid around on the tray and were quite difficult to pick up.

I make this every year for Thanksgiving abd it's also a mainstay when we entertain -it's nice and light, and won't spoil anyones dinner. Easy to do with ingredients that are easy to find, and it's pretty.

We made these for a reception. Looked great, very fast to assemble, but it was a hot day and these did not hold up well. The oil in the tapenade leaked out and they became quite greasy. Next time I would drain the tapenade in coffee filters first for an hour or so, for a drier consistency. Fresh bell peppers would have worked as garnish as well.
