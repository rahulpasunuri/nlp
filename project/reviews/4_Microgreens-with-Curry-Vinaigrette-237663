This vinaigrette is wonderful - I used olive oil instead of canola for personal preference and it doesn't interfere with the curry flavor. I used on a chopped raw cauliflower salad with boiled new yukon gold potatoes, parsely and fennel. Yum!

I would not waste the expense of procuring microgreens, just use mache or baby anything-BUT the curry vinaigrette is EXCEPTIONAL!
