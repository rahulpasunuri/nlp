Excellent, easy, flavorful, almost feels light, despite the cream. A little caribbean in the middle of winter! I put it in a large trifle dish rather than the individual glasses. The only problem is what to do with all the left over coconut cream. One addition might be a can of mandarin oranges. And the jam could be omitted, but the rum was a nice touch. A big hit at the dinner party I brought it to.
