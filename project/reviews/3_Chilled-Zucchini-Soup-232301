I made this recipe twice. The first time I followed as the recipe says. I found that there was WAY too much parsley and dill. I cut them both down by half, added 2 cups of broth and no extra water, I also added some cayenne and lemon juice. It turned out good, but it's not something I would make again.

This was a great way to use up a lot of zucchini and summer squash from my CSA and very nice for the hot weather. I followed this recipe for the most part, with some additions from the recipe for Chilled Zucchini Soup with Lemon-Cumin Shrimp. I left the zucchini skins on, which may have added more flavor, and used a mandolin to get really thin slices. The other recipe said 1.5 lbs. was 5-6 zucchini so I used a lot and I did all chicken broth (just enough to cover the veggies) instead of half water. Once the zucchini was cooked, I pureed it in the blender with lots of fresh dill, lemon zest, dashes of cumin and cayenne, and juice from 1 lemon. Finally, I topped it with plain Greek yogurt as the recipe suggested, which added just enough tartness. Very good!

Our garden is overflowing with zucchini so I was pleased to find this recipe, which also included two herbs from our garden--parsley and dill. We found it a bit bland, even after adding paprika and more salt and pepper. Didn't taste the lemon zest at all. That said, I will experiment with proportions because it's easy to make and we love cold soups.

I merged this soup with a few other avocado-based ones on Epicurious, adding some chipotle powder to the zucchini cooking stage (with only 2 zucchini) and pureeing the soup with 2 avocadoes. Really good.

I only cooked the onion, but pureed the zucchini first in the food processor, adding then cooked onion, the zest from a whole lemon and whole milk yogurt. This was really quite tasty.

I really enjoyed this soup! I used greek yogurt and family like it hot, they were so hungry they couldn't wait for it to chill!

We really enjoyed this soup! The lemon and dill flavors were very prominent, but not in a bad way. I am not normally a fan of chilled soups and yet we were delighted with this soup and I think that it would do very well hot...I would also like to try the same recipe, but substitute the zucchini for carrots, the dill and the lemon might compliment that flavor nicely. Definitely a marvelous and simplistic recipe!

I thought this was unusually good. Favorite herb proportion: 1/3 c. each of dill, parsely, and mint. Natural sliminess of zucchini translated into very smooth and creamy textured soup with lots of flavor and little fat. Delicious and refreshing! Guests loved it too.

disclaimer: i used fresh thyme in place of dill (bf won't touch anything with dill). that said, we thought it was tasteless and strange. not exactly terrible, just not something you would want to eat again. i used homemade chicken stock, and that was the predominant note in the soup. yum, cold chicken stock.... :P it had no zucchini taste whatsoever.

This was a terrific starter soup for a late-summer salmon dinner that I served. I used yogurt instead of buttermilk and was very happy with the choice.

I've served this soup on two separate occasions - dinner party for six - in chilled liquor glasses as a transition course and - as a first course for a family lunch... It is at once a refreshing course that leaves you wanting more for it's complexity of flavors.

Flat & bland. I had to add a lot of salt & pepper to this. I even added parmsean cheese. The addition of cilantro made it a little better. Maybe it was just the zucchinis I had, but I'll find something differen.

I really like this soup, especially using a loose 1/8 cup parsley & 1 1/2 cup buttermilk. Easy and quick to make. I'd make this again without the 1 3/4 cup water, but with 2 cups of water & 1/2 bouillon cube to increase thickness.

I was really disappointed with this soup. I used buttermilk instead of yogurt, and that might have made the difference. I don't know if I'll even bother to see if it does.

I loved this soup. It was really quick to make and light to eat on a hot day. I did not peel the zucchini. I used a hand blender and pureed it in the pan. I made it a 2nd time and added some watercress that I had no other plans for. It was also very good.

I made this twice and have a suggestion to jazz it up a bit. First of all, I don't think it needs all that milk or yogurt. Instead of chicken broth I used veg broth and cooked it with a few corn cobs, which I of course removed before putting it in the blender. The more interesting thing I added was purslane instead of parsley. It added an additional lemon note that was very tasty.

After adding 1/4 of the parsley to the first batch of soup in the blender, I decided the recipe was going to be "grassy" if I added any more parsley at all. After some taste tests, I used a full cup of yogurt; the recipe could even stand 2 cups if you prefer creamier. I also added a few dashes of sherry vinegar. Maybe next time, a little more dill and even less parsley. I didn't peel the zucs; we didn't mind the little peel bits, and it's prettier.

This was alright. It was less creamy than I expected it to be. (That's just me, I like creamy soups.) I used buttermilk instead of yogurt. I doubt the flavors would differ much since you're adding so little in proportion to the rest of it.

This was great. Very refreshing. I served it to guests on a very hot evening with grilled steak. I don't know how the person before me thought it tasted like grass. Her grass must be really good!

Nothing special, tasted like old, moldy grass in fact. And I LOVE cold soups so that's not it ...

This was WAY better than I expected. I used yoghurt and thyme in place of the dill since I have it growing. It was better after a night in the fridge.

Very good the next day. I didn't peel the zukes, and there was no need. Also, the zuke flowers really jazzed things up -- definitely worth finding.

I've made this twice for 2 different groups - it's just that easy! I used yogurt the first time, but think the buttermilk gives a smoother texture. Also, I added a squeeze of lemon during the blending process which added just another layer of flavor.

Great to have another recipe for all of that zucchini! All but one of us liked this soup...that one just didn't like cold soup. It was a great starter for our Fourth of July dinner party.

So simple, but so delicious!! Definitely make this ahead of time (ideally the day before), the flavors need to blend in the fridge. I was tempted to add more dill, but I stuck to the small amount called for in the recipe, and I'm glad I did -- the flavor balance is just right. I added a teeny bit of cayenne pepper for kick, and served with a dollop of creme fraiche. Yum!

I used basil instead of parsley because it was what I had on hand. Also wasn't lucky enough to have any zucchini blossoms...BUT I found this soup to be very flavorful- the lemon zest is key- and a great way to enjoy fresh zucchini.
