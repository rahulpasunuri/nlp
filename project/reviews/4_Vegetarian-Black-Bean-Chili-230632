In terms of flavor, this is not the most outstanding chili ever, but I do like how easy it was to make and a very good recipe to have in your arsenal for when company comes unexpectedly or your budget is tight. The different types of heat give it a great interest. We used diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce and it gave the dish a good texture. The recipe as written yields way more than 4 main course servings. I would say about 6 generous ones. It is a heavy meal.

Very easy recipe with an excellent flavor. My changes include 2 jalapenos with seeds (in lieu of the cayenne) because why not go w/ fresh when avail? A 24 oz can tomato chunks instead of sauce to give it more consistency. Finally, a good sloshing of apple cider vinegar to enhance the tomato flavor. Now will pack on top of rice in child's lunchbox. Yummm!

I cut the amount of chili powder in half so it wouldn't be too spicy (I don't know if my chili powder is just really hot or if I'm a wuss, but I find most chili recipes call for more than I would like.) Other than that I followed it exactly and it was delicious. My new favorite chili recipe.

Fast, economical, and very tasty! I usually make a veg chili with assorted ingredients I find in my kitchen at the time, mostly successfully. For some reason, I decided to follow this recipe instead and everyone loved the result. The spices are in the exact right proportions. The only change I made was using more tomatoes: I had canned mine in quart jars, so I went ahead and used a whole quart instead of 16 oz., but we all like a very tomato-ey chili. Everyone asked me to repeat it soon, and I certainly will!

This was a hit, with a few tweaks. I left out the bean liquid and instead added 1 1/2 cups of vegetable broth. I also left out the marinara sauce and instead substituted a 16 ounce can of crushed tomatoes. It was spicy, but not overwhelming. The cheese and sour cream calmed down the spice. All in all, a great veggie chili that gets better with time.

You know the old Life cereal commercial, "Hey, even Mikey likes it!"? Well, I have a 16-year-old "Mikey", especially when it comes to the vegetarian dishes I make for his older brother, and even Mikey loves this one. It's become a family fave plus I make it (doubled or tripled) when I have a crowd coming over to watch a big game on TV. Definitely have the toppings on hand - cilantro is the best part.

This was wonderful, so flavorful. I loved the switch from kidney to black beans! I made it exactly as written, though others had expressed concern over the amount of chili powder used. I thought the spices were PERFECT. I did, like others, however, omit the reserved bean juice and added chicken broth instead (twice the amount called for, we like it a little wetter). This is hearty and delicious.

Hey, Robyn here, thanks everyone for all these positive reviews!! And thanks to Bon Appetit for printing it. I love hearing all the suggestions for changing it up and totally I agree with rockgeek56, the original recipe definitely called for rinsing the beans, The restaurant is no more but I'm currently working on a website, Almacucuna. There's more where this came from.

Sooooooooo delicious! I made this because my daughter has decided to be vegetarian and my usual recipe has meat. I made it exactly as the directions stated except added a little extra cumin and only did half the chili powder. I will be making this again....over and over and over!

This is a staple in my diet! I make a pot, freeze 3 servings and eat the other the same day. The only thing I change is that I don't save any of the liquid from the beans. That goop is nasty, lol. I made this for a New Year's Eve brunch & everyone loved it. A vegetarian option was welcomed. My college-aged niece has asked me for the recipe as she enjoyed it a great deal.

Hubby wasn't too happy when I told him that I was making a vegetarian chili. However, after eating it, he requested that I make it again! I had to tweak it, which is why I only gave it 3 forks, instead of 4. First of all I only used 1 tsp of chili powder. It was still too spicy for the kids, and perfect for us. I can't imagine using 2 tbs of chili powder! I also used 2 cans of diced tomatoes and 1/2 C of chicken broth instead of the bean water and tomato sauce. Oh, and I had a bunch of carrots that I wanted to use up, so I diced up 2 and added them to the chili. It was fabulous and I will make it again.

Rating: 4
This was excellent. Doubled the cumin as others suggested, and used chipotle chili powder. The chipotle powder I cut in half because we have some spice-wimps here, and it was still strong enough for me (I'm not a spice-wimp). We also added some frozen corn. My husband heated a corn tortilla and cheese and spooned the chile over that (he loved it); my daughter and I made fresh guacamole and stirred into the chili...it was fantastic! Will make often during the winter, I think.

Rating: 4
I read all the reviews (yes, I have no life - but I learn so much!!!) and I doubled the cumin, and used Pinto, Black and Red beans. I didn't have 16oz diced tomatoes so I used one of my 1 quart canned tomatoes and omitted the bean liquid. I'm enjoying it right now, it is good and I know it is going to be even better tomorrow! I will definitely make this again and again!

Wonderful, super easy and affordable recipe. Did three beans: black, garbanzo, and white cannellini....had to cook a bit longer, but well worth it. Also added four large fresh tomatoes and a bit more pepper& chili pepper. Awesome!

Agreed on additional cumin! I also use fat-free Fage in lieu of sour cream on top, mainly because I can eat the leftovers. For "A Cook from Merrillville, IN" -- It's sort of a pain to type everything in, but livestrong.com has a function in their calorie counter that calculates per serving nutrition info from recipes you've entered. It may not be exactly what you're looking for, but I sure was glad to find it.

DELISH! I am Paleo but made this for a vegetarian friend recovering from surgery - if I ate beans, I'd devour this myself! My changes were: 1 can garbonzo 2 cans black bean; frozen corn added when simmering; diced toms instead of sauce; double cumin; extra onions; some diced celery; green onion and cilantro chopped and added at end instead of garnish.

I thought this was pretty ho-hum upon first cooking, so I took the approach I take with baked beans- add everything you can think of that will make it taste good. I doubled or tripled all the spices, added a generous shot of whiskey, a cap full of apple cider vinegar, a few spoonfuls of bacon fat (we're not vegetarians), mango chutney, anchovy, tomato paste, Worcestershire sauce, half a habenero, and a ton of salt and pepper. It is now possibly the best chili I've ever had, and it doesn't even need garnishes. So, the recipe is a great base to start from, and this will be introduced into my normal cooking cycle.

This chili is one of the best I've ever tasted! I made it for a party and for ease of preparation on the party day I sauted the peppers and onions the night before and then mixed everything in the crock pot. All I had to do on the day of the party was take the crock pot dish out of the frig and plug it in. Cooked it on low for about 4-5 hours. Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe! Definitely will be making this again!

Rating: 4
YUM. This recipe is fabulous, and so delicious. I read some reviews before making it, and I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of the tomato paste because of so many people suggesting it. I tweaked it a bit and used both yellow and red bell peppers (instead of only red bell peppers). This recipe allows for some serious experimentation, which I love! Also, allow for about an hour and a half, maybe a bit more for this recipe - most of that time is spent chopping. This is a delicious recipe! If you like chili, don't hesitate to make this recipe.

Rating: 3
Can't believe how easy, cheap, and delicious this is! My modification was to substitute a can of chickpeas/garbanzo beans for the third can of black beans and it turned out superb. Perfect served with tortilla chips, esp. the lime ones for some reason. Like the other suggestions and next time will try some corn and/or cornbread.

Rating: 4
I made some modifications that the other reviewers recommended: instead of tomato sauce I used a large can of chopped/diced tomatoes. I also added a can of corn (for color) and a small can of Hatch chiles that I found at Trader Joes. I omitted the cayenne pepper because I used the chiles. I also tossed in some sea salt. This was a great party dish, and I only wish I had made three pots of it! The # of servings is definitely on target. It was fun to serve it in mugs and I recommend the biscuit/shortcake recipe below as a companion. Also blue corn chips were another great companion.

Excellent recipe to improvise with! Added 2 cups frozen corn and used diced tomatoes instead of the sauce for a chunkier chili. Felt the amount of chili powder was a bit much (after 2 bites had to run for water) but that is completely subjective. Definitely a keeper!

Rating: 4
4 forks beacause this an extremely adaptable recipe. you cannot mess it up! never having made a vegetarian chili, i threw all the bells and whistles at it hoping to make it as flavorful as i could: three colors of bell peppers, a can of corn, fire roasted tomatoes in addition to the tomato sauce, and chopped chipotles in adobo (those are hot! so omitted the cayenne). i offered diced avocado in addition to the other toppings suggested in the recipe. yummy! also, i drained the beans, but that's probably not really necessary. i chopped all my veggies earlier in the day, so it came together very quickly--served with choice of cornbread or tortilla chips. lots of compliments!

Rating: 4
I would have never expected something so healthy to be so delicious. My doctor advised me to eat 1/2 cup of beans daily so I have this as a side dish almost every day. It's a very adaptable recipe: I use dry beans and only a couple tablespoons of olive oil,double the cumin and cayenne, add jalapeno peppers, use a large can of fire- roasted diced tomatoes instead of the sauce, and often throw in any vegetables I have in the fridge-- mushrooms and greens are good in this. Freezes very well.

We used a mix of red, yellow and green peppers. This has the perfect amount of spice! Add green onions to the top. Next time, I am going to add a few different types of peppers, bay leaves and chopped tomatoes to give more body.

If you want it spicier, try adding half a chopped chipotle (canned, in adobo). I did this and also threw in some frozen corn to make it a little more interesting to my palate. The recipe is great on its own, but with the added smokiness of adobo, it's fantastic.

I made this chili with a few alterations, I added 1 package button mushroom, I used 1 bell pepper and 1 Serrano (the light green one, I get Serrano's and Pablanos confused) pepper both of which I charred removed the seeds and the skin, chopped and added them in, & I used beer instead of reserved black bean liquid. Next time I want a little more heat so I need to make sure to buy the right pepper next time, maybe add in a jalapeno. Love this recipe!

Absolutely fabulous! I halved the tomato sauce and added a 16 ounce can of diced tomatoes as suggested by other reviewers. However, the lynch pin is to serve the chili over a baked sweet potato. Wow!!

This is a great recipe on its own. I like it a bit milder, so I cut the cayenne pepper in half. I also add a can of diced tomatoes (liquid included) and about 2 cups of sofrito (coarsely chopped half of a green bell pepper, red bell pepper and white onion, 3/4 cup of fresh cilantro, 2 cloves of garlic, made into a salsa- like consistency in a food processor). This gives it a more tangy consistency. Also, pink beans work just as well as black.

After reading pretty much all the reviews, my staple for this dish is cutting the chili pepper in half, and using a little less tomato sauce. I also like to use a rainbow of color, so I use a combo of red, yellow and orange peppers and a combo of black beans, great white north beans, and kidney beans.

I didn't have cayenne, and maybe that would have pushed this to a four. I also used kidney beans instead of black beans, maybe that would also taste better.... As it was, pretty good.

I'll go back to this one for veggie chili. The combination of spices made it a spicy-sweet chili, which I loved. I used green peppers (cheaper) rather than red.

Very easy and delicious... we didn't miss the meat at all. It travels and freezes well...I took a batch to a church chili feed, froze it there for a week and reheated it. Everyone loved it.

I would definitely make it again.

so easy to make, and very flavorful considering the simplicity of spices added. (pretty healthy as well!) i doubled the recipe and it was easily enough for 8-10 people. i substituted 2 cans of spicy chili beans for 2 cans of black beans (in the doubled recipe) and used all of the liquid in the cans instead of adding extra tomato sauce, and it turned out great. would definitely make this again!

Wonderful chili. I followed the recipe exactly as written and I was very impressed with the results. It had just the right amount of spice and was very satisfying. Even my husband who generally likes meat in his chili, loved this and didn't miss the meat at all. I only used a bit of sour cream for topping. I think too many toppings would detract from the flavor of the chili. A sprinkling of cilantro would have been good too. This is definitely my new favorite chili.

I made this in a rush one night when I wanted some chili to top my baked potatos. It was so simple and tastes great. I ran short on black beans and added 1 can of white kidney (which I love in tomato based sauces). I added corn, because everyone loves corn in a red chili. I used crushed tomates and some tomato paste instead of sauce. Finally, I also added a cup of broth becuase I wanted to simmmer it down a little longer to get the spices fully immersed in the beans. I ate it without the potato!

I was actually surprised at how good this chili was. I did use high quality ingredients--garlic from Keith's farm (if you live in NYC and go to the Union Square Greenmarket then you probably have a love affair with this garlic, too)and Rancho Gordo midnight black beans---they are so fabulous they changed my mind about beans forever--all Rancho Gordo beans---but any dried beans will do. Canned beans are ok for some things, but not when they're the main ingredient. I added sauteed leeks to the onion just because they were in the fridge, and I added about half a cup of salsa verde, a little extra of all the spices, and used ancho chili powder. It really is clean and delicious. I've had some horrid meat-free chili. The thing that's even greater about this recipe is how cheap it is to make, especially if you are using dried beans. I highly recommend this!!

This is totally simple last minute chili recipe. I used crushed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce. Personally, I think the amount of liquid recommended is all wrong. I most of a 28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes, and at least 1 cup of water. Also used only 1 bell pepper. I did use chipotle instead of cayenne, and thought it was good. My partner loved this and couldn't stop talking about it. It's good with leftover, and with tortilla chips, crackers or toast. Also, I only had fontina cheese and used that as my topping, which was delicious. It melts really nicely.

A Cook from topeka, ks - What do you expect from a recipe with the word VEGETARIAN in it??? *face palm* Anyway...I made this last week and I agree that it's a good solid recipe that doesn't require much effort and is easy to play around with.

I was looking for a recipe that would be a nice departure from the veggie chili I normally make. Unfortunately, this dish was very similar. Nonetheless, it is a very tasty chili recipe and quite easy to make. I like spicy chili, so I added a jalepeno, but even with that addition it was still rather tame. Will try more variations next time!

This is a great beginning for developing an excellent vegetarian chili. As is the recipe works very well. With a little extra time and effort to use dried beans from scratch and cook the whole thing for a couple of hours, it's amazing. As long as you keep the onions and peppers, and the accoutrements at the table, you can experiment quite a bit with spice combos and vegetables to find a great result.

delicious! so easy, really tasty, good if you are on a budget/have limited ingredients, and super easy to make in bulk. i boiled it for a little longer (a couple of minutes longer) so that it was really nice and thick.

I had a vegetarian friend coming for lunch on Saturday and this recipe looked less daunting than other vegetarian fare. (Throw everything in a pot and turn on the heat? Hooray!) I ended up throwing in mushrooms, diced tomatoes, and fresh baby spinach for extra texture and color. I also went with some of the other suggestions and used three different color beans (red, white, and black). The result was truly beautiful. (I also think I might have misunderstood the "tomato sauce" and I ended up buying fire roasted tomato pasta sauce. It turned out great, though!) I also left out the cayenne (my friend wasn't so keen on the spicy) but added extra garlic for flavor. Finally, we followed the optional suggestion and sprinkled on shredded colby jack cheese and a bit of sour cream. We were both completely satisfied and the flavor and texture was to die for. She said she couldn't WAIT to come back and have some more! I've been eating this chili for three days now and it just gets more delicious! Couldn't recommend it more!

Very good and not too spicy. My family loved it. I am beyond horrified that someone reviewed this saying they added meat and then fed it to vegetarians and they liked it. I find that behavior appalling. Vegetarians don't eat meat. The only change I would make is adding a bit of cheese on top. I'm becoming a lacto ovo veggie.

As a college student, I found that this cooks up to be a fabulous and healthy way to eat during the week- one batch lasted me about 5 days!

Just made it! Good, hearty and hits the spot, but could probably be tweaked a little.

This recipe was amazingly easy to make. Being a novice cook, though, I was a little scared once I started sauteeing the veggies as I did not know that having them be even a LITTLE wet from being washed would make the oil jump so much. I reduced all the spices by half and added a 1/2tsp of cinnamon, and it was absolutely delicious and it still retained enough spiciness to suit my own personal tastes. I highly recommend this recipe, especially for the other amateur cooks out there who, like me, find a way to burn ice cream.

I go for full fat sour cream here because it's otherwise relatively healthy!

This was a delicious introduction to black bean chili! Since this recipe I have been inspired to make my own chili, but it was definitely not like this one. This is a great dish to have sitting in one's fridge to dip into all week. SO good.

This has quickly become a staple at our house. I serve it over rice, and for my meat-eating husband, I top with baked mini-meatballs. Oh, yum!

This was really great as I made it- one lg can diced tomatoes, (1) 8 oz can sauce,and tomato paste to thicken for a more chili consistency. Added a can of hominy and tossed in some diced sauteed summer squash. Adjust heat to taste. Great!!!!!!!!!!!!

This was a big hit, and healthy, but a little plain. If you're looking for just regular old veggie chili, this is it. Next time I make it I'll probably add some jalapenos and more garlic to give it more oomf.

Best veggie chili recipe I have come across. I used a mixture of black, red, and pinto beans, and added a can of diced tomatoes to mix it up a bit. I also used Penzey's Medium-Hot Chili powder, plus the cayenne, which really made it spicy! Great recipe!

Great bean soup. I didn't have enough black beans so I added another kind along with the black beans. Even with no meat my son loved it.

This was very dry...not soupy at all, so I used it as a topping for rice rather than a chili. Also, it made a huge batch--I'd probably cut it in half next time for my family of 3.

This was a great recipe! I made it for a dinner with friends, and it was well received by all. I used the Penzey's hot chili powder, and substituted their Chipotle powder for the cayenne, which gave a nice smokey edge to the chili. Also, I used whole peeled tomatoes, which I crushed, and the packing juices instead of tomato sauce, which gave us some nice chunks of tomato (if you like that sort of thing..).

Excellent recipe. Have made this often to go with quesadillas and other Southwestern/Mexican foods to make me feel better about the consumption of cheese.

Really easy to make. Perfect for a quick week-night dinner. With the added cheese, sour cream and green onions, it's even better.

This is a great alternative to traditional meat chili and so easy to make. I added about 1 1/2 cups of corn and 3 stewed tomatoes and about 2 tbsp of their juice and it turned out delicious.

Tasty (if you like chili) and fairly easy. I found I needed to add more liquid than was called for. I froze the leftovers for lunch and it reheats well.
