This was excellent. Served with grilled chicken and everyone was disappointed to be done with the salad and left with the chicken! I sliced the pears (used red to give visual variety) and fanned them in a circle atop each salad plate alternating pear slices and cheese slices. Used all arugula, no endive.

This was excellent. The only change I made was to cut up the pears and mix them into the greens with the dressing since I was serving 25 buffet style. Only 1 person mentioned the bitterness of the greens, but overall was a big hit. The manchego was delicious, Parmesan could be substituted but the Manchego had a creamy quality that you don't get from Parmesan. Definitely a keeper.

This salad is one of our favorites - I make it over and over. I often use spinach instead of the bitter greens though. As well, when I want to make it as a meal, I will add in chicken and/or avocado to give it a little more substance. The pumpkin seeds are my husband's favorite part!

This is a gorgeous presentation. I made the dressing in the morning and assembled separate plates an hour before the meal. It wasn't soggy because you drizzle the dressing and don't mix it with the greens. This is not kid friendly because the greens are too bitter. This would also be delicious with good quality parmesan slices. I used 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar instead of sherry vinegar. It worked well with the bitter greens.

Also good with butter lettuce, sliced pears, slices of parmesan and with or without the pumpkin seeds.

I liked this salad because of the contrast of the sweet/tangy dressing, the spicy greens, the cheese and to top it all off, the pumpkin seeds add a crunchy twist. I highly recommend it!!

This recipe is fabulous! I made it for a dinner party, and everyone raved. My only alterations to the recipe were to use spring mix instead of the frisée -- I don't like that stuff! -- and to do it as one big salad and toss and dress it all before serving.

This salad was good, but I have had better pear salad combinations on this website. I would make it again.

I made this for a baby shower this fall and it was a huge hit! The dressing is great and good Manchego is key as well as ripe and juicy pears. I am making it again for a Holiday party and will make it over and over! Great Salad!

This salad was amazing, the contrasting flavors are a party to the taste buds. Sometimes I make a big salad using this recipe for dinner. It is just wonderful.

A keeper! I sliced and lightly sauteed the pears in a bit of butter instead of serving raw. This works very well if you need to prepare in advance. I also tossed the greens very lightly in some of the dressing prior to topping with seeds, pears and cheese.

Terrific salad;pears and cheese are such a wonderful combo and the dressing gives it a nice punch. I diced the pears and used shaved/shredded cheese and put it all in one bowl, to serve at a large dinner party. It was a nice accompaniment to game hens. I did add more honey to the dressing, as the recipe as is was too vinegary for me.

Served this at a recent (autumn) dinner party. It was a nice, refreshing first course followed by braised short ribs over mashed potatoes. I'll be making this again for Thanksgiving.

This may be the best salad I ever ate....

While this was pleasant enough, I don't think I would bother to make it again. The dressing was much too tart. I almost doubled the oil, and added more honey.For a festive look and a nice contrast, I topped it with pemegranate seeds.

An absolute hit at the autumn dinner party I threw. Cut up the pears into matchsticks was the only difference. Well balanced taste wise and pretty easy to make.

After a week out of town, I returned to have out of town guests. I made this as part of a "tapas dinner" and one person thought it was the best recipe of the night. Easy and delicious, even though I made it with CANNED PEAR slices (in juice, drained)! I thought it was light and crunchy. I used half escarole and half romaine, chopped. I served it in a bowl, help yourself style.

Great salad. I sliced the pears as others suggested. The manchego cheese really puts this over the top.

This was delicious and really good. I made it as a big tossed salad, not individual servings, with the pears cut up and chunks of the cheese. The flavors are wonderful.

Excellent salad with arugula, baby romaine and thinly sliced escarole. We used the very small Seckel (sic)pears.

I thought this was an excellent salad. I did just chop up my pears rather than have them in whole slabs. Lovely combination.

It's exceptional with one change that is easy to do ahead. Saute quartered pears in a bit of olive oil and add a couple of teaspoons of balsamic at the end. Once cool, add pieces to the salad.

I've made this twice, once with a honeycrisp apple because my pears did not ripen in time. Couldn't find the manchego but thought it very nice with an aged white cheddar. The second time (once my pears had ripened), I used gorgonzola which was also delicious. I had never used pumpkin seed in anything and now they are a favorite!

The flavors in this salad are wonderful. I used a Goat Gouda cheese, which is similar to the sharpness and flavor of Mancheno. The only thing I did was to add just a touch more honey to the dressing. My husband liked it so much I had to make in the next night. The second time I used Maytag Blue cheese; also wonderful! This is a repeat.
