Oops, I meant I used 2 tlbs kirsch! And next time I would use just a bit less.

Absolutely delicious. Took a few other reviewers' suggestions and left out the cinnamon. Added 1/4 cup kirsch and 1/4 tsp almond extract. Used bing cherries so only used 1/2 cup sugar, which was plenty. Needed almost 10 tlbs of water for the crust though, and had to bake it in the lower half of my oven to prevent burning. A winning recipe!

Excellent recipe! The smearing method for making the dough is now my go-to trick for really flaky crusts and pastries. Thank you gourmet! Here are my suggestions on how to make this pie even better: -use local cherries if you can, they will taste much better! -pit cherries ahead of time, and let set for hours, or overnight if possible. This will allow the liquid to seep from the fruit, so that you can reduce it and reintroduce it into the filling in a concentrated form, resulting in a fruity and not runny pie! -How to reduce the cherry liquid: after pitting all cherries, press fruit with hands, and drain all liquid possible, squeezing fruit to drain. Heat fruit liquid on low, increasing heat until it simmers. Maintain low simmer, and stir occasionally, until liquid is thick, and about 1/4 of its original volume. Mix with ground tapioca, and let the tapioca absorb the liquid before mixing this tapioca/reduced liquid mixture into the fruit and sugar filling. -use the classic almond extract in addition to the vanilla. The round tones in the almond extract complement the acrid cherry flavors! -seal the bottom crust with brushed egg white, and bake pie on very bottom rack for a crispy bottom crust. The last time I made this pie, I was a bit short on cherries, so I mixed in raspberries, strawberries and blueberries as well. I made the syrup reduction with the combined juices of all the fruits, and kept most of the reduction for pancake syrup, because the pie was already plenty flavorful. Fruit-juice cast-offs make for great pancakes, and tasty home-made flavored sodas (when added to seltzer water). Yum!

Delicious. Used sweet black cherries, so decreased sugar to 1/2c. The pastry was excellent -- this was the first time I used the "smear" method, and I will be using this instead of my regular pastry recipe! The only thing that prevented this pie from making 4 forks was the cinnamon. I really expected to love it, but we found that it obscured the taste of the cherries. The pie disappeared quickly and we enjoyed it, but I definitely would omit the cinnamon next time.

Amazing! The cinnamon adds a wonderful touch! If you don't like this pie, you're doing something wrong!!!

I was very disappointed by the results of this recipe. The crust was just okay in general. I did not like how the top crust got so crisp from the sugar sprinkled on it. The main disappointment was with the filling. There was NO juicy syrup at all...just plain fruit. I would not make it again.

Excellent pie. My pie pan was in use, so I used a French tart pan (with removable bottom)and it worked out just fine. Since the pan is shallow, next time I would cut back on the tapioca and sugar. I'm adding this to my recipe binder. I did cut back on the cinnamon to about a 1/4t. Crust will replace my usual pie dough recipes, I had forgotten how tender a crust a Pate Brisee makes. To answer the question of one reviewer about the why the crust is so tender and flakey...smearing the dough forms long layers of fats (butter and shortening) and flour that puff when baked (aka mock puff pastry). Enjoy!

Jummy Pie. Everybody loved this dish. As misjudged the amount of cherries I substituted with some summer berries I had in the freezer and it worked a treat.Nice sweet but tangy taste and flaky crust. Europeans: For Fan oven: Cook on 200 c for 20 minutes and turn down to 180 for the remainder.

This was an excellent pie. The crust was tender and so flakey. It was the first time I used the technique of smearing the dough; what a difference it makes. The dough was so much easier to handle and roll. The flavor was excellent, too, because of the butter. I changed the flavoring of the filling. I didn't use the cinnamon. Instead, I added 2 tsp of lemon juice to keep the color bright, about 2 Tbps of Kirsch and a scant 1/4 tsp of almond extract. The cherry flavor was deepend by the cherry brandy and perked up by that touch of almond! I used fresh dark sour cherries as that was all that was available and they maintained their shape well. This is my new idea of the perfect cherry pie!

This is my first review on Epicurious I had to write it. This pie was amazing. I've had trouble with pie crusts in the past, but this was sensational. The cherry filling was delicious and my family absolutely adored it. It'll become my classic recipe.

Made this & brought it to work... it literally was gone within minutes and have not stopped receiving requests (more like demands) for the recipe! Everyone was especially impressed with the crust. I did use a combination of sour cherries & blueberries b/c I didn't have quite enough cherries. So So Wonderful!

This pie is fabulous! I loved the crust - flakey and buttery. I substituted vegetable oil for shortening due to trans-fat concerns, and it came out great. I used fresh cherries and reduced the sugar a bit because they were sweet to begin with. Also, when short on time, I don't chill the dough in the fridge for the required hours/days - rather I use very cold butter (that I keep in the freezer) and pop the dough in the freezer for 10-15 minutes. Works great!

Delicious. I made this for Thanksgiving with frozen sweet cherries and 1/2 cup sugar. The sweet/tart balance was perfect. The crust was indeed very good -- buttery and flaky -- and also easy to handle. It got compliments all around and was gone in no time while the store-bought pies languished on the counter. Definitely make it.

Excellent. Wonderful filling, exceptional crust. Frozen sweet cherries work beautifully if you can't find sour ones.

Unfortunately I couldn't find sour cherries on short notice so I used sweet ones and 1/2 cup of sugar instead. The mixture worked fine and everyone loved it.

If you like tart pie, use only 2/3 cup sugar.

The idea of cinnamon and cherry didn't appeal to me, so I used the vanilla extract plus 1/2 tsp. almond extract. I used frozen sour cherries for the filling. It turned out wonderfully, although next time I will probably use a bit less sugar to allow more of the tart cherry flavor to come through. Perhaps a little more almond extract also, because you really couldn't taste it at all. I was curious to see if the crust of this recipe would live up to the apparent hype in the reviews. It does! I've only used 3-4 piecrust recipes in the past, but this blows them all away. I will be using it for all my pies from here on out. I used the food processor to make the dough, then used the "rubbing" method and chilled for several hours. I'm not sure which part of the ingredients or process made the crust sooo good, so I guess I will just try to do it all exactly the same next time. Flaky, flavorful, really excellent texture.

Fabulous! The only adjustments I made were to cut the sugar by 1/2 and add a splash of Kirsch.

If you are looking for a great cherry pie recipe, this is the one! I have made this for countless guests in Door County Wisconsin, the cherry capital of the world! Each and every person has raved about it! Just add a scoop of fresh Wisconsin ice-cream and you're set! Enjoy!!

I loved this recipe. I couldn't find fresh or frozen sour cherries, so I used canned sour cherries in water. I ended up using 4 cans. I would definitely make it again. Also, the crust was a great alternative to the all-shortening version. I brushed the top crust with half-and-half before sprinkling it with raw sugar (much more coarse). Since the canned cherries were already cooked, I took the pie out as soon as the filling bubbled. It was delicious!

This pie is amazing! I didn't have sour cherries, but super-fresh cherries from the farmer's market. I decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup because the cherries were already sweet. I can understand that this isn't a classic American cherry pie, but the vanilla and cinnamon make it a wonderful dessert. Love, love, love the crust, which was very easy to work with. Highly recommended!!

Pie is my husband's favorite, but I am always hesitant to make it because dough baking seems to be such an art. Well, I decided to go for it with this one, dough and all (despite the fact I had frozen pie dough in the freezer) and it was excellent. It did not taste like "traditional" cherry pie, because the cherries were not covered in a thick syrupy gel. Making the crust by hand was certainly worth it.

I can't think of enough superlatives for this crust recipe - looks, taste, it deserves its high rating. Been using Pillsbury refrigerated for the last 30 years since Mom told me it was close enough to her homemade crust, but no more!! Takes more time but absolutely worth the effort. I lowered the initial oven temp to 400 since I used a glass pan and covered the entire top and removed the under pan toward the end so the bottom could brown up. oh yeah, the filling - I use OregoN canned tart cherries in water (1 c. sugar, 2/3 c. cherry juice, 3 T. cornstarch, 1/4 tsp. almond extract, 1 T. butter to 2-14.5 oz cans cherries) plus a bit of lemon zest on the filling top (ck inside the can label for methodology). Can't go wrong.

The crust was perfect. I will always use this as my crust for every fruit pie I make in the future. The recipe makes plenty for a deep-dish pie. I would not use any cinnamon again...way too overpowering. I used frozen cherries since it is december which turned out wonderfully. The pie set up perfectly...it looked like a picture in a magazine. Make this and everyone will love it!

Amazingly easy and very versatile. I couldn't find the sour cherries and used black cherries instead. Everyone loved it!

I'm shocked that this recipe was so highly rated. In my opinion, the vanilla, and to a lesser extent, the cinnamon, completely muddied and destroyed the pure cherry flavor. I was so disappointed that I had to go back to the farmer's market to try again the next week. Maybe the high ratings are mostly for the crust - The crust was excellent.

Like other reviewers, I never thought I liked cherry pie - until now. I had a strange hankering to try a cherry pie so I ordered some Michigan sour cherries and give this one a shot. Amazing! The crust will be my new go-to crust for everything - tender and flaky and absolutely delicious, not to mention fool-proof to work with... what more could you ask for? This one goes in the permanent file.

The filling and crust were excellent!!! However, I used a 10 inch pie plate because the crust and filling were too much for the 9 inch pie plate. The pie filling stayed in the pie and did not run out onto the pie plate!! I also added 1/2 teaspoon almond extract. I would use this recipe with other fruit as well.

I have never been a big fan of cherry pie but this recipe changed my mind. I am an amatuer when it comes to baking but this pie was simple to make and the outcome was delicious. I would certainly make this one again.

Loved, loved, loved this. Just want to add: I made it ahead, cooled, and froze. The day I served it I let it thaw on the counter all day and then just put it in the oven for 15-20 minutes while we ate to crisp up the crust and it worked beautifully.

The nicest pie crust to work with. Very simple and easy to roll out. And it tastes good too!

This is my standard for all pie crusts! It is so easy to use and it rolls out beautifully. The food processor makes it effortless. I use this recipe for all my pies that I enter into the Iowa State Fair and National Pie Championships. Here are some tips that I use with this recipe that you may find helpful: Freeze the butter and the shortening before using. It makes a flakier crust, I find that 4 tablespoons of ice water is the perfect amount of water but this will depend on where you are located, refrigerate the crusts at least an hour before rolling out. Brush the top with an eggwhite/water wash before sprinkling the sugar on the top crust. I usually use 1 egg white to 1 tablespoon cold water. This makes a beautiful, golden crust. I make my crust ahead of time & find that it freezes well. This recipe is definetly a keeper!

THE BEST cherry pie I have eve eaten. I was fortunate to get my hands on fresh, local sour cherries, WOW!! Amazing! I agree that the crust in itself is a fabulous find. I have made many different crusts in my day (all butter, butter/shortening, cream cheese, sour cream, etc, etc) and this one is by far the very best. It's the perfect combination of flakiness, tenderness and flavor. Awesome recipe by Gourmet! This definitely goes in the permanent file!

I made a blueberry pie instead of cherry, and used all cornstarch instead of the tapioca (I'm sure tapioca is preferable; I'm just lazy). The four fork rating, which is rare for me, is down to the crust. PEOPLE. THIS CRUST IS PERFECT. I AM NOT KIDDING. I used the food processor method, so it was ridiculously easy as well as a dream to handle -- and the best part? THERE'S ENOUGH CRUST! So many pie recipes make a skimpy little ball of dough that you have to roll translucently thin, with all the attendant stretching, tearing and heartache. Not so here! There's a generous quantity for patching, which is a boon to a pie novice like me. And it turns out flawlessly golden and flaky. I am in love with this recipe. JUST SO GOOD.

this was phenomenal. I bought tart cherries at a farmer's market on the PA turnpike. The recipe was followed to the letter and I had the perfect pie, I will definitely use the crust recipe for other fruit pies. By the way, this was my first berry pie ever and I look forward to doing this more often.

Unlike some of the other reviewers, I didn't enjoy the cinnamon flavor in the cherry pie. Interesting, and worth trying, but not what I'm looking for in a cherry pie. I much prefer almond extract and a clean cherry flavor. This was my first time using frozen cherries, though, and this worked out great, so I'll be using these again.

I had a hankering to make cherry pie since it's cherry season. This recipe produced a wonderful crust that is easy to work with. I previously made a blueberry pie recipe from an old issue of SAVEUR (collected in its America Cooks volume), and the crust was horrible. It used around 3/4 cup shortening, and kept crumbling when rolling out the dough. Anyway, I did everything this recipe says to do--except use 3 tbs. cornstarch since I had no tapioca, and regular cherries instead of sour--and I ended up with a pie that's beautiful and delicious enough to serve guests. Pitting the cherries is messy--cherry juice squirts a lot. I used the flat of a knife and pressed down on the cherry to release the pit--the same way I pit olives. The cherries after baking, exude a rich and liquory syrup. It's an enjoyable process to make this pie and witness the alchemy of baking..

I only made the crust because I couldn't find sour cherries (made a raspberry, blackberry, boysenberry pie instead), but wanted to say how much I LOVED this crust. Easy to do, tasted great, pretty. Have used the crust twice now, and stellar both times. Can't wait to find the cherries and make this entire pie!

This turned out absolutely beautifully! I didn't have tapioca so I used all cornstarch and the filling worked out just fine. The hint of cinnamon is genius, and delicious. We couldn't wait until the pie was completely cooled to have some (after all, it was the 4th of July - couldn't wait until the next day!). Because of this, the first pieces were a little runny, but it firmed up perfectly after it cooled. It's a do-over (and over, and over) in our household!

Fabulous! Pitting cherries is indeed tedious but the flavor is well worth the trouble. I did not find sour cherries but reduced the Splenda (worked beautifully!) to one-half cup. This was my first experience using ground tapioca and I found that I prefer it over cornstarch because it is less "gummy". A word about the crust - I've been reluctant to use pie crust recipes containing butter because they are not as flaky as those with shortening. However, the mixing method indicated here results in a stellar texture and taste. This recipe is a keeper and is dinner-party worthy.

This was a cinch to make. I found fresh sour cherries at the local greenmarket, which made me very happy. The tedious part was getting the stones removed. I also substituted 2 Tablespoons of cornstarch for the tapioca (for a total of 4 T. or 1/4 cup total). I also didn't let the fruit mixture sit quite as long as stated (20 mins. for me). Everything came out fine and the fruit set up very nicely. I found the cherries to have more of a tart flavor when baked and the cinnamon enhanced that perfectly. One of my dinner guests pronounced it "pie- gasmic" and another suggested that I make 2 next time so she could have seconds. I would definitely make it again and wouyld recommend this recipe. BTW: this was my first pie.
