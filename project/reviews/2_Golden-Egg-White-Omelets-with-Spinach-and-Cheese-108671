I found it amusing that the recipe says to use egg whites to reduce the fat content, but the photo shows the omelet with two pieces of sausage. I guess you save where you can, huh?

Saute kale in water, drain and place in bowl. Pan fry vegetarian sausage & chop up. Mix up an avocado with small amt water & salt. Roast and chop poblano chili. Make cilantro chutney: (cilantro, almonds, jalapeno, lime zest & juice) Mix 8 egg whites with soy milk and tumeric. Pour into pan, add sausage & poblano. Microwave kale. Add kale to top of omlet along with some TJ's red salsa, chutney, & last, the avocado. Serve with some baked, oil spayed tortilla chips. Sooooooo good!

Good one N. Fla. "Martha"! I knew someone would say this would take too long. I love omelets, but only "M.S" (bleeccch) would take a simple omelet & ridiculously complicate it to prepare if given half the chance... like this one, but not me, thank you. I would think that a very small amount of diced red, yellow & green peppers thrown in w/the spinich to saute would be just fine, or not... Then the spinich, peppers & cheese topping, put under the broiler for a couple minutes would cut the preparation time back considerably for a lovely brunch omelet.

The pepper puree does not work. It ruins the texture of the eggs and makes them hard to set, and it is overpowering in flavor. Word of adivce: if you want a low fat omelette with still some color, just add like one yolk, and follow the recipe as it says, but WITHOUT the pepper puree (its yucky).
