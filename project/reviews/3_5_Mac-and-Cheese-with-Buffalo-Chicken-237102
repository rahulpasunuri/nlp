I made this for my Dad and sister, they both said it was excellent! I cut the recipe in half, but between the two of them it was almost gone. I switched the elbow noodles for bow ties and it worked perfect, I like the look much better

Crazy glue for the veins! Very good tho once a year after a clean bill of health from the doctor. Didn't have cornflakes so I used rice krispies which resulted in a very nice texture and crunch. Followed another review and kept the chicken apart. The pasta portion was awesome and flavourful.

After reading the reviews, I decided to prepare this dish as per the recipe anyway. I found it to be close to spectacular. I'd probably give this recipe 3.5 forks, but it was good enough to edge it into the 4 forks category. There were a couple of things I did differently...I used vegetable oil for the frying, used only about 3/4 cup green onions, which I thought was plenty, and I strained the onions and garlic out of the milk after cooking them (most of the flavor, none of the texture!).I also used a white cheddar so the dish was not orange colored. Next time I make this I will definitely make the chicken myself again. The cornflakes gave the strips a unique sweetness that I loved. Plus, the coating was delicious! I tried a few after frying and they were fabulous. I fried the strips until they were quite crispy, and didn't have a problem with breading coming off, but unsurprisingly they soaked up the cheese sauce and became soft. My plan for next time is to cook the mac and cheese separately, then serve it with the chicken strips on the side. The butter-hot sauce mix was brilliant. The fat gave the hot sauce a lovely texture. This is heading to the top of the list to make frequently! Bonus: it makes a ton so I've got dinner for a week!

Definitely a good recipe for mac and cheese that one could tweak for the rest of time. I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and bought pre-cooked buffalo chicken (bought mine from Whole Foods). I also threw in some bacon, because, well, why wouldn't you? I plan on making this dish again, although not too often only because it is rather sinful.

Made this for Superbowl Sunday - what a hit! Sinful but so delicious! Recommend really crisping the chicken strips so that the crunch holds through the baking. This recipe makes a TON!! Also reduced the cheddar a bit and added in some crumbled gorganzola - heavenly!

Delish! Used cut up, cooked-from-frozen boneless buffalo wings instead of making the chicken. Cooked 45 min on high in a crockpot instead of baking, and it was great. Used more than double the # of green onions noted, but 1.5 cups from 18 onions was still tasty.

Do yourself a huge favor and skip the chicken recipe. Buy some Tyson's Buffalo Chicken strips (quite spicy but good white meat) and just use those. They are already breaded and add a nice kick. Everyone loved this dish. Is now a favorite of mine. Talk about your comfort food!

Should've followed the previous reviewer's suggestion to keep the chicken separate. Really, why go through the effort of breading when it falls off immediately. Maybe it's me, but I also had to add additional Frank's sauce to get the heat I wanted.

This is BY FAR the best I have made. I dont understand why other reviews say the chicken is soggy? Maybe you are not draining it on wire racks? this is the BEST comfort food on the planet. Everytime I make it, its gone within hours! It never lasts at ANY party I take it too and the guys BEG for the recipe. I have been PAID to make this dish! Time consuming? Yes. Worth it? ABSOLUTELY! AMAZING!

Great mac n cheese. I skipped the chicken entirely, added steamed broccoli instead, and didn't add the hot sauce. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. It was awesome. The family I feed with it couldn't have been happier - even a picky kid!

2.5 forks - I made this for a BCS championship game watch party. It was appropriate for the setting, yet not your typical dish. Everyone who tried some seemed to really like it. I had a little bit more chicken than cornflakes so I used the flour mixture as the coating for the last pieces. I actually liked those pieces better than the flour and cornflakes crusted chicken, both on their own and in the dish. They are spicier and taste more like buffalo chicken to me. If I make this again, I will probably just use the flour to fry the chicken. This dish is time consuming, so it is best to be prepared for that.

Not the healthiest meal I've ever made, although its one of the best!!! Its easy to make and tastes great. If I'm running short on time I use bone-less frozen buffalo chicken.

Why spend the time, calories and oil to fry chicken that you are going to mix into a creamy sauce? Don't do it! Keep the chicken on the side. Honestly, the chicken was the best part of the recipe. So good! The mac, on the other hand, was adequate. As an alternate, I suggest the 'Blue Onion' mac and cheese (on epicurious) and for presentation - put the chicken strips on top after baking and drizzle the hot sauce over all for serving. Otherwise, just eat the chicken and mac separately. YUM!

This is a fan favorite. People beg me to make this regularly. The only reason that I don't make it more often is that it is a bit time consuming. It is hearty, comfort food at its best. The flavors are amazing and if there happen to be any leftovers, they reheat very nicely.

A lot of work for not a great end product, and I usually make my mac n chz completely from scratch. The chicken coating got soggy quickly, even before adding it to the macaroni and was bland. The cheese sauce recipe was not very flavorful. Try the recipe from cookingforengineers.com or Alton's. By the time I got to the putting it together part, I just wanted it to be over with.

I love this recipe for it's taste & versatility. Alone, the mac and cheese is fantastic! I prepared the chicken according to the recipe, but baked it instead of frying - it was delicious. The recipe could be varied with any type of cooked chicken or turkey. Possibilities are endless. The mac and cheese portion has become one of our families staples & friends & family alike can't get enough!

I've made this several times since finding the recipe, my husband and two kids just love it. Yummy. They can't get enough of it.

yum. I like the chicken in it. Makes it more like a casserole. Even if you don't do the chicken, the green onions are a great touch for mac and cheese that I will definitely add from now on. I added an extra 2 cups of shredded cheddar on top and removed the foil for the last 10 minutes and it was great.

I thought the chicken was much better separate from the macaroni and cheese. I served the two separately. Overall, the recipe for the buffalo chicken was far superior than any other I've found thus far.

Like all the others say, this is not worth any of your effort. big disappointment. make mac & cheese from the box, and chicken like you would any other day, season with buffalo sauce and enjoy. it would be much better than this i'm sure. thank goodness i tried it before i served it at our superbowl party.

Fantastic. Our favourite mac and cheese recipe. Don't scrimp on the cheeses and use hot Hungarian paprika. Deep frying the chicken makes a huge difference -- I sprinkle hot sauce on the cut-up chunks after they're cool. Chipotles en adobo also make a nice topping for a change. We've made this 3 times since finding the recipe -- LOVE it.

Not bad. I used pre-made Aidelle's buffalo-style chicken meatballs. Good on a cold day.

This recipe came out really well. Instead of frying the chicken I baked it on cookie sheets. It ended up really moist and much healthier then deep frying in oil. I also didn't add the chicken to the mac and cheese. I served them and the hot sauce separately just so that everyone could decide how much of the hot sauce they wanted on their dish. Oh and p.s. beer does go really well with this dish. Didn't go w/ the PBR though but accompanied it w/ Bud Light.

Really yummy. We took this dish to a Super Bowl party and it was a hit! Making the buffalo chicken was time consuming and a bit tedious, but the final results were worth it.

It is summer and just too hot for me to want to stand over hot cooking oil. To make the recipe convenient, I used pre-made chicken strips found in the freezer aisle that I reheated in my oven. The same dutch oven that I used to boil the macaroni and make the cheese sauce, I baked the dish in. It truly makes a one dish meal this way. I used half the hot sauce as some of my friends are sensitive. This was my first attempt at making mac and cheese from scratch and it turned really good, not dry at all. Maybe I'll top this off with some bacon bits next time around.

I made it without the chicken because I was serving it with buffalo wings. I'm not a huge fan of mac of cheese, and this seemed a bit dry to me, but my guests loved it. A couple of people asked to take some home.

Maybe a little labor intesive, but it is well worth it. It combines two of my favorite foods and I was not disappointed. Even my friend who hates spicy buffalo wings loved it!!!!

Not worth the time and effort. Make your favorite mac & cheese and serve buffalo wings or strips on the side.

This is a very labor intensive recipe and my prep time took around 2 hours, not including washing all the massive amounts of dishes, pots and pans OR the cooking time. I was slightly disappointed in the taste of this dish. I would not necessarily call it mac & cheese but more like Buffalo Chicken Casserole. I made very slight changes that I don't think would make much of a difference to flavor or taste. I did not use cornflakes but plain bread crumbs, I sauteed in olive oil vs deep fat frying in oil, and I added at least 1/2 of the Franks w/melted butter vs the 4 TBS that was to go on the top. The reason is that there was very little flavor going on with what the recipe called for. Chicken was very mild in flavor and not what I had imagined. Overall, it is a good dish. Would I make it again? Probably not.

I made this for guests a few days ago and it was a big hit. It was a fairly step intensive process (my hubby, the cleaner, thought it felt like Thanksgiving) but the results were worth the trouble. I kept a few chicken tenders aside for the kids and they thought they were great. I agree with other reviewers that the spice taste is not overwhelming on the chicken which worked out well for my little ones. All adults indulged in a second helping and I happily ate leftovers the past few days!

I followed the recipe as written, but made one addition: 1/2 cup bacon crumbles. It was great! The people at my football party liked it enough that all 20 of them---all guys---took the recipe with them.

I left out the buffalo chicken part, and just made the mac and cheese part without the onions (used onion powder in its place after sauteing). If you like the Stouffer's Mac and Cheese texture, you'll love this! As you make the cheese sauce, you may think it is way too much for the 1 lb of macaroni, but it's not. A sure family pleaser.

I thought this recipe was just horrible! Lots of work for garbage can results. (I wouldn't even feed it to the dog.) Next time it's Mac & Cheese with Buffalo Chicken on the side. This was from a professional chef who owns his own restuarant? Hmmm....

I made this for my super bowl party and it was a huge hit. I did cut out one cup of the chopped onions and added another 1/2 lb. of extra sharp cheddar, as well as using more hot sauce than was in the recipe. I will definitely make this again, maybe next time cover it with some butter soaked panko breadcrumbs for a nice crunch!

I had every intention of following the recipe to the letter but ran out of time and opted NOT to do the fried chicken portion of the recipe. Instead I bought a LARGE bag of buffalo chicken tenders, thawed, chopped and added it to the recipe. I didn't have provolone on hand so I substituted mozzarella. It turned out GREAT!! Like another reviewer, once it was done cooking, I added a cup or so of crumbled blue cheese then tented the casserole until it melted. It really hit the spot! Much to my surprise I didn't have any Frank's BUT, I would not do the sauce/butter mixture, just have the bottle on the side. It also makes GREAT leftovers!!

Save yourself a ton of work. Buy a BBQ roasted whole chicken from your grocery's deli. Add pulled chicken to macaroni. The mac part of the recipe was simple and tasty. With the added pulled chicken it was easy and delicious. I also saved a handful of the cheese to mix with Italian bread crumbs for a top layer before baking, making for a good crispy texture when done.

This recipe combined two of my favorite dishes. However, a lot of work for a so-so recipe. The flour mixture for the chicken calls for lots of ingredients which you don't even taste after you dip them a few times. Good -- but not great! My guests liked it though -- I think I expected more.

Rating: 1
For the amount of work in this recipe, I was expecting a much better dish. Like previous reviewer, the chicken was nice and crispy until you put it in the casserole. Also, for all the spice used in the chicken portion, it didn't transfer to the finished product. I used panko instead of cornflakes, but the rest of the recipe I followed exactly. I used white sharp cheddar cheese, and still felt like the cheese sauce was lacking depth. I did use Frank's hot sauce, but I also agree that there are other hot sauces that are far superior. In general, way too much work for a so-so dish.

The mac and cheese portion of this recipe is good. The fried chicken tenders portion of this recipe is okay (and cooks fine in a half an inch of oil instead of two inches). The problem is that once you toss the fried chicken into the mac and cheese and bake it, the once crispy coating on the chicken becomes soggy. I think the whole thing would be better if you just make the mac and cheese part of this recipe and serve it alongside some boneless buffalo wings.

Absolutely delicious!!! Used Rice Crispies and Bread Crumbs to sub for Corn Flakes and added Mozarella instead of Provolone...Great! Will try with some bleu cheese next time. Lots of cleanup with several dishes but well worth it.

I would give it 3-1/2 stars. It was surprisingly good. I served the chicken separately from the Mac and Cheese and drizzled the hot sauce/butter mixture on the chicken also. My teenage son thought it was the best chicken ever. Used the hot sauce/butter mixture on the pasta. I thought it was a wonderful casual dish. Worth all the clean-up!

I prepared this for dinner one Sunday evening and served it to 4 guests, two of us had eaten homemade egg rolls for lunch and thought we wouldn't be too interested in dinner that night! Wrong! We ate a lot of it! I followed the recipe precisely - I thought it took longer to prep than I had expected and dirtied a lot of stuff, but felt it was worth it - the chicken is fabulous on it's own, wouldn't change that - we didn't use much of the hot sauce. This is a keeper - just know it does take time and I am thinking that I might play with adding a bit of blue cheese with the macaroni the next time around, just in keeping with the Buffalo Chicken & Blue Cheese Dip theme.

Oh my! This was delicious. I wish that I could make this everyday of my life. We made it for some friends, and when they put it in their mouths, they were grinning from ear to ear! They loved the chicken. I substituted monterey jack for the provolone. The only thing I might change next time is less hot sauce. While the spiciness was enjoyable, it was almost a little too much. But other than that, it was magnificent.

I made this pretty much as the recipe directed, only instead of cornflakes I used breadcrumbs and sauteed instead of deep frying the chicken. The chicken was delicious, although the buffalo flavor wasn't too strong. The macaroni and cheese was amazing though, creamy, fluffy and delicious. The scallions were a fantastic addition. Next time I would probably make it without the chicken, or maybe serve the chicken on the side.

Let me start by saying as soon as I got this issue and saw this recipe, I couldn't wait to make this mac & cheese. Two of my favorite dishes all in one! I decided to try to make it easier by using frozen buffalo chicken tenders instead of frying my own. That part was great. Then I had to halve the recipe. The final product was dry, not a real creamy, cheesy sauce. Maybe not as much elbow macaroni next time? Reduce the cooking time even more? I also don't think the green onion and oregano were necessary - kind of overpowered the "buffalo" taste. Having said all that, I will definitely try it again though - it has potential!
