this was ok. In the future I'll just roast the crougettes and serve.

I agree -- too salty -- besides that it was easy to make a delicious. I was surprised that zuchinni could be so flavorful.

Delicious. I roast baby carrots and serve with this for a nice color contrast. I leave it chunky and serve it as a side dish.

This was easy and my guests liked it, but I thought the appearance was unappealing and the flavor just so-so. Maybe some roasted garlic to give it more depth of flavor? The mashed up zucchini gave the spread a weird texture and a messy appearance - I might puree part it if I made this again.

Awesome!!! Be careful with the salt. I found that 2 tsp. was too much.
