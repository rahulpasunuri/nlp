Seriously? Escolar is a wonderful and very tasty fish that is EXTREMELY HIGH IN FATS. If you limit yourself to a couple of ounces of this delicious fish you wont have any embarrassing scenes. Dont write off something just because of one bad experience, learn from it and so further enjoy life.

Do not, I repeat, DO NOT eat escolar unless you want to soil your pants repeatedly for about 24 hours. Never have I been so sick (or embarassed).

Delicious? Yes. Worth having to come home from work with soiled pants and forever being "that diarrhea girl"? Not on your life. Friends ate Escolar at their wedding and boarded a plane for Fiji the next day. They had to borrow diapers from people on the plane. Oh, and the "orange anal leakage" stains. Trust me... not worth it. I'll make this with a different fish, thank you very much.

Escolar is outrageously delicious and even most of those people who are sensitive to it, because of its indigestible fats (esters, actually) should be able to eat a bit of it...say, no more than 4 ounces. To ban it would be like banning dairy products because some people are lactose intolerant. Unfortunately, most of us are gluttons...that is, if something tastes great, we make "pigs" of ourselves. The fat that causes the problem is similar to Olean which is used in fat-free frying, potato chips, etc. Again, just try a little of it at first. I have only had it as sashimi (4-6 pieces at most) and a buddy of mine, with very sensitive digestion, has also. Neither of us have ever had a problem. But, we have not made a meal of 8 or 10 ounces of it.

Escolar is a great thing to serve at a dinner party.... if you never, ever want to see any of your guests again.

This is an amazing meal, too bad my husband is one of the 50% of the population who has oily diarrhea and severe orange anal leakage after eating this fish. Sorry to be disgusting, but there is a reason that Japan has outlawed Escolar. Loved the taste though.

Escolar is a delicious fish. I had it grilled yesterday at an upscale restaurant. I was in the bathroom all last night. I thought I had overeaten or the food was too rich. I looked up the fish today because it was so good and I had never heard of it and began to read what the possible side effects are. I along with 3 other people had the same small portion of fish (grilled) and I was the only one who got sick. Luck of the draw maybe but I was terribly ill and you should be careful.

I found this recipe searching for escolar and have not made it, so I am not rating it. However, I wanted to add a comment to the previous reviewer. The FDA site mentions that cases of scrombroid poisoning were reported after certain consumers ingested escolar. However, a careful reading of the site reveals that dozens of cases of scrombroid poisoning were reported to the FDA from ingesting many other types of fish, including fresh tuna. Escolar is no more prone to cause scrombroid poisoning than is any other improperly handled fish in the same family. The other potential problem noted by the FDA is that escolar has a relatively high fat content, so consuming it battered and fried or in large quantities can lead to gastrointestinal distress. Escolar is delicious. Like all fish, buy it fresh and from a reputable source. Try it grilled or in another way that minimizes the additional fat.

Escolar fish is very tasy but I would not recommend anyone eating it... it can have some very bad side effects. Information is available on the fish @ http://www.fda.gov/default.htm

Indeed, a dish beyond compare with luscious flavours and a stunning presentation. But, very complicated, involved and time consuming in the extreme. I followed the recipe verbatim and, thankfully, my husband helped in the kitchen - bless him! You definitely need an extra pair of hands for this recipe. Was looking for an extra special fish/seafood dish for a dinner party that included the food editor of a national magazine - rather intimidating to say the least! This one met that criteria very well as she was wowed and even asked for the recipe. Took considerable running around to find everything, but glad I persevered as escolar is a lovely fish: quite mild/delicate in flavour and tender-firm in texture without being overly dense/meaty. Although delicious to the max, don't think I will make this entire recipe again - just too much work! However, it certainly was the centerpiece of a very memorable, one-off dinner. Thanks, Epicurious, for making me look so darn good!

This was VERY complicated, but extremely tasty. A close friend in the food business gave the passion fruit aji a "10," and she's very discerning. The escolar was a *very* nice piece of fish--get it if you can find it! The recipe calls for too much sauce--we doubled the recipe to serve seven, and used less than 1/3 of the sauces. Make sure your mangos are firm, and buy extra. I had a really hard time getting good mango slices. Let me know if you find a mango with "flat" sides as described in the recipe ;). We barbecued the fish, wanting something a little less oily, and it turned out wonderful.
