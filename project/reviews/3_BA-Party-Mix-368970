Very blah. I never found Terra Stix either, but doubt they could have saved this recipe. We will not be making this one again.

I like most of the other reviews couldn't find either the peas or the terra sticks, I used veggie straws from whole foods crushed a bit. I like it but next time I'm going to increase the quantity of the sauce, because it didn't seem like enough. I also didn't use garlic but garlic powder because I forgot I didn't have any garlic. Seemed to work just fine.

Made a GF version last year for gifts. I modified it, as I had difficulty locating some of the ingredients. I gave up trying to find the Terra stix and just got Terra Sweet Potato and Beet chips (which I love for the color it adds!). Used Glutino pretzel rounds, ditched the peas altogether, and replaced Bugles with 2 c. each Rice and Corn Chex. I used the regular Chex Mix "sauce" but added garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder, paprika and the dijon (omitted the mustard powder). My GF friends all loved it, and I do like the upgrade from usual Chex Mix. PS used salted, roasted peanuts.

It was pretty good but next time I'd lay off the garlic.

Tasty, especially the bugles and pretzels, but I think the pepitas and peas might be too small for this assortment. We had kids like the mix. Would make again with some different ingredients.

I liked this. I made 2 batches--gave the first away and served the second before Christmas dinner. The frustrating thing was finding ingredients. Terra chips from whole foods, roasted peas from the asian grocery store (only wasabi peas at whole foods), bugles and pretzels from the grocery store. Its definitely a step up from chef mix. I added extra paprika and salt to the baked mix. I considered adding cayenne pepper but haven't yet. Its a keeper for me.

Agreed with BoredMom on all counts -- this doesn't even rate one fork. In a word - UGH! Stop trying to improve on the classic, some things ought not to be messed with. Party Mix is one of them.

I agree that this was a bit of a wild goose chase to find the ingredients. That being said, it is easy to leave out what you can't find. For me it was the peas, which I don't like anyway. I made this gluten free, using Glutino GF pretzels. They are delicious. I also threw in some corn nuts. Other than that, I really liked it and it was munched on all weekend.

In agreement with boredmom on all counts! We'll be back to the gold standard for party mix next year. I never found the sesame pretzels so substituted sesame sticks from the bulk conatiners of such things found in most stores along with some holiday shaped pretzls. The only thing I may retain are the Terra Sticks- they did add a nice splash of color. Peas did add nice color too but are like rocks. My son spiced up our second batch a bit (had to use all those extra ingredients on hand and it was a definite improvement (Tabasco, more English mustard and Worchestershire)

This is such a refreshing change from the standard "Chex Party Mix" I doubled it so I could make gift bags. Could not find terra stix so I used 2 bags of the Mediterranean Terra Chips (crushed slightly). After baking I added 4 cups of mixed nuts and this made it! Better after it sits a few days.

This should be called Wild Goose Chase snack mix. I finally found the terra stix, Bugles (dollar aisle at Target), never found whole wheat sesame pretzel rounds, and could only find fried green peas, which had the texture of marbles. After shopping at about 8 different stores to get ingredients, all I can say is SAVE YOURSELF A LOT OF TROUBLE AND MAKE YOURSELF SOME CHEX MIX. This was SO not worth the effort, completely unremarkable. Not sure what they were smoking in the test kitchen the day they came up with this disaster.

Ok so I've been the 4 stores and found Terre Stix(Whole Foods), roasted peas (local store called Andersons), so far no luck on the pretzels!!! Any idea what brand/manufacturer???

i was thrilled to see an alternative to the usual chex mix and the ingredients were a perfect blend of textures, colors and tastes. it was a huge hit at the party i attended and made my kitchen smell great - i'll make this again....

What in the hell has happened to epicurious? Came here this evening hoping to find the holiday recipe inspiration I once did and this BA Party Mix crap is what I find. What a disappointment.

If it helps, I'm searching for the ingredients now, and I found Terra Stix at Whole Foods. I also saw some sesame pretzel rounds there, but the smallish bag was $6.99. They probably have roasted peas too, but I didn't have time to look for them.

I wanted to love this recipe--how nostalgiac are Bugles. Combed ever store in the city for ingredients: Never found Terra Stix, had to order a case online (let me know if you need some). Never found roasted green peas--tried making my own to no avail. Never found whole wheat pretzels with sesame. Used traditional pretzels. Flavor is merely okay. Stick to the basics on this one.
