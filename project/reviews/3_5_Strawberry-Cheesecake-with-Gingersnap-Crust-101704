Excellent, better than any store bought cheescake. Use this recipe in conjunction with the strawberry sauce recipe and you have a winner, seriously. Just make sure that you don't use low fat, not as good, trust me!

Did not bother with the lemon or forming the gingersnap crust up the side of the cake yet still got fab results and people clamoring for more. Looked awesome topped with sourcream, strawberries and jelly/brandy glaze!

Quite good, but not outstanding. It was heavy; could have been more flavorful with some lemon zest. I liked the thick crust.

I made this for a get-together and everyone loved it. It is very thick and creamy. There are different styles of cheesecake and this is the thick/creamy style versus light and airy. I added about one teaspoon of lemon zest to give it balance and next time I will reduce the gingersnap crumbs by one cup. That was the only complaint... the crust was too thick and hard. It may have been the brand of 'snaps (Nabisco), but next time I will only use 2 cups.

I almost didn't make this cheesecake when I saw it had a less than steller rating but then I looked at the reviews and noticed the only complaint was that it was thick and creamy which is what I find to be perfect adjectives when describing a cheesecake. I made it for my bookclub and it was a hit. Try using organic strawberries as they are so much tastier than the obsenely oversized berries you find in the supermarket.

I must admit I was disappointed in this recipe. I serve it to dinner guests who shared my opinion. The cake was "too thick creamy" if that makes sense. I was so thick in the mouth. I felt like I could feel it drop to my stomach. I didn't realize this would be the consistency of this cheesecake. I would have chosen a cheesecake with a lighter texture. I will not make this again

This was my first attempt at making a cheesecake and it came out perfect. It was a big hit with guests (especially the ginger crust). I had to bake the cheesecake a bit longer - could be my oven. I also made a sauce of strawberries in the blender and added whole blueberries to add a bit of fruit.

Made this cheesecake with a small twist...roast the strawberries. Cut the hull ends off of the berries, place them in a shallow baking dish, sprinkle a tablespoon of sugar on top, and split a vinilla bean in 1/2, lay it over the berries. Roast them in a 350 degree oven for 5-7 minutes or until the berries "slump". It's even better if you place a slice of cheesecake on top of some creme anglaise, and top the whole thing off with a sauce made from the reduced juices left over from the roasting and Chambord.

This was my first time making a cheesecake and it came out great, kids liked it and I made it again with my 8yrs old daughter. Great recipe for someone with very little cooking skills.

This recipe also works well using shortbreads for the cruts and marbling chocolate through the filling.

This is one of the most boring cheesecakes I've ever made. Yeah, so ya top it with strawberries. Big deal!

This was a great cheesecake; it was very creamy and and the gingersnaps gave it a great flavor. It looks very impressive but is very easy to make. I will definitely make this again.
