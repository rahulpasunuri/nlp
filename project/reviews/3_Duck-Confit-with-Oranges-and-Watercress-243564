I made my own confit a few days back, and thought I would indulge in this recipe. It was very good, with the leafy greens delivering on the expected contrast with the fat of the confit. However my wife didn't like the walnuts. I seared the orange slices in duck fat and deglazed with some Riesling wine I had at hand, which I thought blended in more nicely and allowed me to lazily not remove the skin from the oranges prior to serving. Overall, a simple but well-balanced way to use confit.
