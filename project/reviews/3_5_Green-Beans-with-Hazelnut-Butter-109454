Good, but the lemon was too overpowering. I'd cut back next time.

So good, and easy too. An unusual, but far from strange, way to prepare either green or wax beans, or a combination of the two, as I did after finding these fresh locally grown ones. Had all the ingredients on hand and followed the recipe exactly.

Very flavorful and different. Easy to make, yet could easily go with an elegant dinner. Thought the proportions of butter mixture to beans was perfect. A versitile side dish.

This is great!! buttery and delicious. Definitely the one to make! good w/ duck and a good rice (i occasionally use red, purple, or long grain to switch things up! the nuttiness of the red rice really compliments the hazelnuts, and it's pretty easy to find nowadays)

This was incredible, one of the best side dishes I have ever made! I ate the rest with some fresh bread and butter the following day for lunch, it's fabulous!

I loved it! I used less butter than the recipe called and really loved the lemon & hazelnut mixture of flavors. Not boring at all!

I'm not sure if I did something wrong but I felt there were too many beans for the amount of butter mix. I didn't feel it was too flavorful.

A tasty dish and so easy to make! The hazelnut butter can be made up well in advance and then tossed with the beans once they've finished cooking. It also reheats like a dream (as long as you didn't overcook the beans the first time). I wouldn't touch a thing. A keeper.

This was a tasty recipe and very simple to make. Next time, to make it less rich, I'd probably use less butter, or skip the butter altogether and use lemon-flavored olive oil.
