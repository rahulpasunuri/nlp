Very good. Had to make two substitutions for lack of peanuts or coriander. I used Basel and pumpkin seeds. DOn't do it! The recipie is spot on.. But med. shrimp, squid tentacles and rings were perfect instead of split large shrimp. Also used garden fresh Thai dragon pepper instead of dried red.

Very nice, and, more important, very easy. I made it as written but next time would add more vegetables (not carrot, though, which would be too sweet). I agree with the last reviewer that cilantro and mint are key; if you don't have them, don't bother.

Wonderful! I added julienned red pepper and carrots. The cilantro and mint are a must. This is definitely a recipe where the sum of the parts is much greater than the individual ingredients.

We really didn't like this recipe at all. Very disappointed, a waste of shrimp.

Having made this twice, once as per the recipe and once with some tweaking, I recommend adding a splash of sesame oil to the dressing (it needs it -- it's too cloying and tart without) as well as more veggies. I added a julienned carrot, a red bell pepper cut into matchsticks, and a cup of halved grape tomatoes. I also used bean thread noodles instead of rice-stick ones in order to cut down on time, and I tossed everything (including the herbs) together in one big bowl except for the peanuts, which I let everyone add themselves as a garnish. With those changes, the salad had a perfectly piquant balance of flavors; I'll certainly make it again sometime without the shrimp to save money. It was a hit with my friends, and we all took second helpings. My boyfriend's one suggestion, with which I agree, is to add some other crunchy dry garnish at the end -- maybe bean sprouts. This is a great, easy base for a recipe, though, and the dressing is perfect once you add sesame.

I thought it was very nice and light for a summer supper. I added 1/2 a red pepper for colour, as well as a handful of beansprouts, which was a nice addition. I'd consider adding some shaved carrot as well. Blended the dressing in the blender to get rid of chunks of garlic.

There was one flavor that was really overpowering about this Vietnamese dish . . . I don't know . . . maybe it was just that I haven't ever had Vietnamese food before . . . or maybe it really was the fault of the recipe . . . who knows? The overpowering flavor was something oniony, maybe the onions, the garlic, maybe the vinegar . . . Otherwise, the dish was alright. In fact, I really liked the sauce .. . balanced . . . and I reduced the fish sauce (Three Crabs) from 1/3 of a cup to 1/6. Other than that, I pretty much made it as it was written, for the exection of some added mango which went really well with the other flavors. . .. One other thing: instead of adding the chopped peanuts, I would throw them in whole and toasted, if I made this again. The shrimp were perfectly cooked, and so were the noodles (to my delight, instructions on making rice stick noodles, something absent from the package I bought them in)and the red pepper flakes added a nice kick- and it was not too overpowering . . . so I guess I'm on the fence with this one, hense the two fork rating. All I can say is try it for yourself, and if you can figure out what to delete or add, by all means . . .

I make this for summer barbecues  minus the shrimp and with more veggies  and it is always a hit because it is light and a change of pace from the potato and mac salads that you usually have at those functions.

This was okay, but not great. Not nearly as flavorful as similar dishes I have had at Vietnamese restaurants.

Came out much better than I expected. The dressing was delicious and very easy to prepare. I used frozen shrimp instead of fresh and put a bed of chopped butter lettuce in the serving bowl. I might add more veggies next time.

Very good! You could even use those pre-cooked frozen shrimp to make it even easier.

Am I the only one who threw this all together in one big chilled bowl, with condiments (herbs, diced mango & chopped peanuts) on the side? So much easier I think. My husband couldn't get enough of this filling summer fare. As stated previously, the addition of mirin, sesame oil, sliced snow peas, julienned carrot and red pepper and extra garlic resulted in one of the best new dishes I have prepared in a while. FIVE FORKS AT LEAST!

This dish turned out really great. I skipped the coriander and added more mint, a couple of diced mangoes, snap peas, and carrot. I wasn't sure I'd like it after I tasted the dressing by itself - it was really fishy and salty. It worked great with the other ingredients though, especially after chilling for a couple of hours. Will definitely make this again - good Summer dish.

This dish made a perfect light supper on a hot summer night. The flavors were delicate yet full, and the preparation was easy. With fresh udon on hand, I substituted it for the rice sticks, and it still worked wonderfully. Use lots of herbs!

Simple yet superb! ...mild flavours with a surprise zinger from the odd pepper flake, great using small shrimp too. I too, added a bit of sesame oil and garnished with a few toasted black and naturaL sesame seeds at service. A few thin threads of celery, Bermuda onion and red pepper julienne. I tossed in a few strips of Daikon radish ('sweated' with salt 1st) and extra lime juice - lishus!

Very good dish. Easy to assemble, lovely flavours (salty, spicy, sweet) and you can pretty much make it your own by additions/subtractions. Whenever I serve it (or bring it to a BBQ) I am always asked for the recipe-always.

Easy and very flavorful. I often find that simple noodle/pasta dishes don't have enough flavor for me unless they are allowed to absorb the flavors for a while. That was not the case with this salad. I tossed that noodles with dressing and ate immediately. I will also add more vegetables the next time simply for the nutritional value.

I made this last night without the shrimp and substituted BBQ Port (leftovers) instead. I also added a little Sesame Oil into the dressing. As stated in the other comments, adding more vegies into the salad makes it more interesting. I added Radish & Celery. I had no problem with the rice sticks - just tossed them into boiling salted water as per the directions on the package. No soaking required.

This is delicious and perfect for summer. It tastes just like something you'd get in a Vietnamese restaurant, which is something I didn't think I could achieve at home.

Great, easy summer recipe! Wasn't sure about the amount of fish sauce, but tried it anyway & it turned out wonderfully flavorful.

I would suggest grilling the shrimp on skewers. Be careful not to overcook. As for the sauce, season to taste, but it looks like it could use a little more lime or sugar, or just less fish sauce. I would remove the herb leaves from the stalk and just sprinkle it with the julienned cucumbers. Bean Sprouts work great here too.

The really essential part of this recipe is the dressing- the rest can be thrown together according to your tastes, although the spirit of the dish is in the combination of textures, colors, and complientary flavors. Unfortunately there is a wide variance in quality in fish sauces as well as the taste for it on the American palette. When all was said and done I needed to add a couple of tablespoons of mirin to dilute te saltinessof my fish sauce, and I chose to add a bit of ginger. This is just one fo those dishes that you have to adjust to thye taste of the individual, but it's as good a baseline as I've seen. I find it a terrific light dinner or a hearty lunch, but the flavors might be a bit exotic for many.

Really enjoyed this recipe. I prepared it as written, except for using an entire package of rice-sticks (15 oz.). This lightened the amount of dressing per serving with no impact on flavor. A winner!

I've made this dish a couple of times now with great success. I use angel hair pasta, and omit the red pepper for my kid's benefit, but otherwise, I've stuck to the recipe. The combination of flavors isn't for everyone, but for those that like Thai food, this makes a great cold summer dish.

This dish didn't really come together for me. For one, the dressing tasted too much of fish sauce. It seemed to need a touch of soy. Second, my rice stick noodles never softened, despite soaking 30 minutes and boiling for 5 or 6. Third, the contents just didn't mix well. The parts (cucumbers, herbs, etc.) seemed to somehow stay independent of one another. And finally, this dish for some reason took a surprisingly long time to prepare, and I'm a pretty accomplished cook. Next time I'm hungry for this dish, I'll pay the $10 bucks at my local Vietnamese restaurant. They do it right.

I didn't care for the sauce on this dish- way too sour. It did not compare at all to the sauce they serve at a local Vietnamese restaurant in my neighborhood. Maybe the fish sauce I used was too salty. I've since been told that "Three Crabs" brand fish sauce is the best, which I didn't use in preparing this dish.

Very Easy and magically delicious! I did not have all of the ingred. and it was just YUMMY! I used green bean thread vermichelli noodles,white wine vinegar,and cilantro instead of mint. I didn't have scallions and completely forgot the cucumbers,but I did throw some bean sprouts in and it was perfect!simply fresh!!!

Very fresh tasting! Make sure you soak the noodles for atLEAST 15 minutes! For those of you shopping for fish sauce, the 3 Crabs brand is well-known and popular!

I love this recipe. I saw it while perusing through Gourmet at the dentist's office, and got them to photocopy it. After I made it, somehow I lost the recipe. I've been trying to make it ever since, but it's really never worked. I highly recommend it, especially during the summer.

Tastes just like my favorite salad from a Vietnamese restaurant in San Diego. They serve it on a bed of lettuce with either shrimp, pork or sliced spring rolls. I tried it with asian marinated and grilled chicken. It was also great.

What a pleasant suprise! I brought this dish to a party and it was the hit of the evening. I'm glad that I brought copies of the recipe with me because almost everybody asked me for it.
