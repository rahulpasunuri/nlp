Great, easy salad. I used cilantro instead of parsley, added diced cucumbers and a touch of corriander. I didn't have green onions so I used a shallot, went very well with the mix of flavors.

This was excellent! I also added a bit of crumbled feta.

This is fantastic. I added avocado, celery and zucchini; we served with chicken tacos, it was a hit with adults and kids. This is a definite keeper.

Perfect for a hot summer day! I followed the recipe exactly and tasted it before deciding to add cumin.

Came home from driving all day and had bought fresh corn and plum tomatoes. For the most part, I had the majority of the ingredients. A few changes I made were to add chopped pickled jalapanos, (would add fresh next time), salt, pepper and some salsa. I didn't have cumin, but think it would add a little pizzaz. My husband ate almost the whole salad!

Reviewed ths six yrears ago and am still making it a summer staple. Have started to finish it off by garnishing with toasted chopped cashews. Way to go!

I omitted the lettuce, used pinto beans, 1/4 cup of parsley & basil from the garden and served it with pita chips ....it was a party hit, though it was the only freshly made thing at the party, but that's another review! This is a classic recipe that with fresh ingredients is lovely.

I have made this time and time again. I tripple recipe and have made this using various types of beans for a different variation. All are delicious! I add cumin and cilantro and red bell pepper to mine. The fresh lemon, cilantro is one that my taste buds just cannot get enough of!

Great summer salad. Made this as directed but added a tsp of lemon zest. This will definitely be a staple.

This was fresh and delicious! I substituted cilantro for the parsley (critical!), red onion for the scallion, and lime juice for the lemon juice. Added orange pepper, cumin, a little crushed garlic and avocado. Am making it again tomorrow night.

Oh, and cilantro instead of parsley definately.

I make this all the time only add more tomato and some chopped avocado and serve it as a dip with a big bowl of tortilla chips. Everyone loves it. I use which ever I have on hand lemons or limes, both work fine.

I love this recipe. I don't bother serving it on the lettuce; I just serve it as a side dish to chicken, steak or whatever. I have replaced the lemon juice with lime, and added about a half a teaspoon of cumin for a smokey flavor. This is easy and delicious.

Same as others: used lime instead of lemon and added cumin. I added more tomato and used cilantro instead of parsley. A keeper! (served it with Fresh Tuna Tacos - the best 15 min recipe ever!)

Wow - easy, fresh and very flavorable. Substituted lime for lemon juice, and cilantro for parsley. Served with the chili encrusted tuna tacos on this website - and it complimented perfectly. Great summer salad/side dish.

I used lime juice instead of lemon because of other comments. This salad was fresh, colorful and delicious. Next time I'll try it with the lemon juice. Added a touch of cumin as well...YUM.

Served without the lettuce, I've doubled this and brought to potlucks. It's always been a success.

Made a great salad -- I used the lime juice & cilantro in place of the lemon juice & parsely, and left out the cayenne pepper. I also thought the corn-to-bean ratio was out of whack -- I halved the beans. I think the result was delicious. But since everyone alters the recipe, I gave it only 2 forks as written.

Rating: 3
I agree with the previous reviewer: 4 forks if you sub in lime juice and cliantro. Good recipe for tweaking to your personal preferences, and can be different every time you make it!

Rating: 4
Three as is, four with tweaking! Definitely add lots of cilantro, lime juice instead of lemon, garlic and cumin, too. Add chopped peppers and --yum--red onions that have been soaked in ice water and lime juice for a while, too. (takes out the bite) Everyone asks me to bring this to summer picnic & BBQs :)

Served this with homemade bread for a light lunch with the ladies. Roasted 1/2 of a red pepper, used cilantro in place of parsley, added celery and caramelized red onion (sliced really thinly), and used romaine/spinach instead. Also added garlic and salt. It was wonderful!

Very good. Made this for lunch without the lettuce leaves, was a good amount for 1, as it tastes light and fresh.

I've made this as a side dish many times and it is easy to make and tastes very refreshing. If you're in a real hurry use canned corn. Works very well.

This was great! I included half an onion, cilantro and grilled the corn before adding. I also let the salad sit for a couple of hours before serving so the favors could blend--delicious!

Quite tasty and a big hit. I've made this twice as a side dish. Once I used frozen corn and once canned corn. Both worked fine. Also, I made it with cilantro instead of parsley.

This was delicious. it would probably be best in the summer with fresh tomatoes and corn, but is really quick, easy, yummy and healthy anytime.

I'm always looking for delicious and easy bean recipes, and this one definitely filled the bill. I made only a few changes: added cilantro, used frozen sweet corn instead of fresh and omitted the lettuce leaves. (I served it as a side dish.) The end result was fabulous. The lemon really gave it a nice, fresh taste.

Followed recipe the first time...second time around used red onion instead of green, cilantro instead of parsley, lime juice instead of lemon...added a chopped clove of garlic and some chipotle chili powder to the dressing, diced orange pepper for additional color and crunch and mango cubes. Wow!! beautiful to look at and so southwest. Served it with ground sirloin burgers on sourdough buns with mashed avocado and a mustard with preserved lemon and garlic. A fantastic meal. Thanks to the cook who suggested shrimp on top. Will do it next time. Also, bought a new gadget for juicing a lime; it turns the lime inside out and I got 1/2 cup of juice out of two average size limes. Unbelievable. Saw it on Martha Stewart's show and had to add it to my collection of stuff.

Just made it for the first time but added half a red bell pepper chopped, and followed "A Cook from Washington, DC's" suggestion of substituting cilantro for the parsley and a clove of minced garlic to the lemon and olive oil. I also added 1 seeded and minced canned chipotle pepper to the dressing and omitted the cayenne. I used halved red and gold cherry tomatoes instead of the plum tomato and topped it all with cooked shrimp. It was fabulous!

DELICIOUS! I've made this numerous times and all of my dinner guests absolutely love it. I substitute plenty of cilantro for the parsley and I add a clove of minced garlic to the lemon and olive oil. WONDERFUL!

Delicious, 1st time I made it followed the recipe. 2nd time I changed it up a bit, used lime instead of lemon. Add a whole chopped cayenne and 1/4 of a habanero for some more heat but not so much that couldn't taste the corn, tomatoes, and beans. Red onion instead of the scallion.

I made this fantastic salad over the weekend for a picnic lunch. It is better to make it the night before to allow all the flavors to meld together. It is perfect to take for a picnic, as it does not have to stay cold. Instead of lemon juice, I used fresh lime juice. I served it alongside the "Turkey Wraps with Chipotle Mayonnaise" from this website, which were also great! This will be a staple in our refrigerator, as it has lots of flavor without all the fat!

I served this salad in a Southwestern dinner party with Jerk pork chops and sweet potato fries ( all epicurious recipes - I am now thought to be the best cook in the family thanks to you!) A very fresh salad to balance the heavy jerk chops and fries. I added some diced colourful bell peppers and some zyng to it - more pepper sauce!

simple and delicious! It pairs well with tortilla chips, or as side dish to fajitas.

A family favorite with steak or Mexican. Experiment and make it your own. You'll love it this versatile salad!

This is a great recipe. I make it frequently in the summer. However, I use frozen corn and just rinse it with warm water in a colander until it separates. Also like the use of cilantro and sometimes some cumin. If you warm it, it is great over rice or you can use leftover cooked rice in the salad.

Rating: 4
Can't wait to make this one again. Corn is perfect right now, and this was a great use for it! I added an avocado and some scallions. Also used extra cayenne and cumin (per recommendations). Served it over mixed greens, and it was fabulous! We had it alongside the marinated flank steak with horseradish sauce (from Epicurious) and it was a perfect summer dinner.

A summertime favority -- I sometimes add mango to make it a little different. We often eat it with tortilla chips.

HEAVENLY! This was sooooo gooood!! I used tiny halved grape tomatoes, substituted lime juice, and added a few dashes of red wine vinegar. WOW! The combination of flavors and textures was superb, to say the least. So quick and easy, too! I'll definitely make this again and again and again...

I doubled this and made this with some jerk chicken, etc. for a large family gathering. It tasted great!

Rating: 3
I used canned corn, which turns this into an extremely quick recipe, and it still tasted great. It could have been jazzed up more, but just for a side dish, I thought that was a little unnecessary. If I were serving it all by itself, that would be a different story.

Rating: 4
Excellant Salad!!! I make it for barbecues, potlucks, and even weddings. I also add the garlic and cumin as other cooks have suggested. Instead of Parsley I use Cilantro. Also add diced cucumbers and bell peppers. This salad has become a standard in my circle of family and friends.

Rating: 3
Thanks to all of you this turned out great! I used the lime juice, garlic clove, 2 scallions, 1/2 tsp cumin, cilantro and I added the lime peel too. The only thing I did wrong was I should have made it earlier in the day to let the flavors meld. The next day it was really great. I would serve this as a side dish, over grilled fish or as a salsa with tortilla chips. It serves 4.

Loved the suggestion to add garlic and lime juice. I didn't try the cilantro, but think I will next time. Also, I added Feta Cheese, which was really great and made it a more substantial dish, rather than a side or salad.

I feel a little late to the party, but this salad is excellent! I ate it with some toasted tortillas and was delighted. I followed others suggestions - added 1 t. cumin, garlic, cayenne pepper and tabasco to taste. I thought the lemon juice was fine, but I may try it with lime next time since it received such rave reviews. This is definitely a favorite.

not bad...served it on a bed of baby greens, wish I would have taken the time to spice it up a bit as suggested by previous reviewers

Agree with the others that lime is preferable, but have made this with lemon and liked it, too. I roasted the corn in the oven and really liked the smokey flavor it gave the dish - didn't take very long, either. Super picnic dish or all-purpose side - we had it just recently next to a Mexican-style frittata for a Sunday supper.

This salad was very very good. My husband and I loved it. Definately add lime juice instead of lemon. It is refreshing and tangy. YUM!!!!

A good, easy starting point, but benefits from a little creativity, as previous reviewers have suggested. Definitely use lime instead of lemon, and garlic, cumin and/or cilantro, according to taste. In addition to the cayenne, I added a few splashes of Red Hot sauce (the kind you use for hot wings). An all season dish: I can imagine it would be great for a summer picnic, but was also a nice winter side dish at room temp with broiled or grilled fish, pork or chicken. (Defrosted frozen corn has more crunch than canned, so makes a better out-of-season substitute for fresh corn.)

My husband and I love this recipe. We have made it with roasted corn kernels which adds a nice extra flavor. I too have added 1/2 tsp cumin, 1 clove of garlic and replaced the parsley with cilantro. Sometimes I have substituted lime juice for the lemon juice. I usually try to let it sit for several hours but I'm careful with the garlic if it sits overnight.

Rating: 3
Definitely add the cumin (1/2 teaspoon), a clove of minced garlic, and use cilantro if you/your guests like it. I let the salad sit for a few hours in the fridge to let the flavors meld, and then brought it up to room temperature before serving. Yesterday's picnic crowd ripped through a double batch in no time.

I thought the recipe, as is, was bland. I didn't read the reviews first but adding cilantro would give it some flavor maybe some cumin too. It was very colorful and easy so it has potential. It serves 3-4 easily.

I enjoyed this summer salad very much. My kids loved it. I did add 2 garlic cloves chopped and 1/4 C. fresh basil. It just gave it alittle more flavor.

This is so fresh,easy and atrractive. I did add a bit of cilantro, a dash of vinegar and used baby corn cut in quarters. Cover an aluminum mixing bowl that this has been prepared in with tin foil and refrigerate 15 min. to 2 hrs. Positively refreshing on these hot summer nights.

I really liked this dish, but felt it needed more flavor. I'll try adding cilantro or basil next time. I served it as a side dish with grilled halibut.

A great side dish without the lettuce for a summer supper. Crunchy and refreshing. I served this with a salmon filet, and it looks nice and colorful on the plate alongside the fish, plus it was a nice break from the usual rice or couscous I make to go with salmon. Try it!

This recipe has become one of my favourites. What I like most about it are the bold, beautiful colours (which make it a great accompaniment to a drab-looking main course), but it's also delicious and very easy to make.
