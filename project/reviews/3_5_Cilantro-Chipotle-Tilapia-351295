Very tasty, very quick. I actually started it in a cast iron skillet with a tiny bit of olive oil, then transferred the skillet to under the broiler. Came out great!

Great flavor and easy prep. I also added a squeeze of lime into the puree. Will make again.

Excellent! Used olive oil (not quite 2 tbsp) and squeezed half a lime into the puree. As it broils the cilantro turns dark so the whole thing comes out of the oven looking kind of black. I may crumble a little bit of white cheese, maybe a cotija, on top next time just to make it look "pretty". Definitely make the Mexican Pineapple Salad to go with it. I chopped it up small so it was more of a salsa/topping for the fish. It's the perfect complement to the spicy flavors of the fish.

I have made this recipe several times and it never disappoints. Everyone I have made it for loves it. The sauce is great on tilapia, but I have also used it on other fish, shrimp and even chicken. It's super simple and I usually have these ingredients on hand. If I ever have excess cilantro in the fridge that I know I won't use, I will blend some of this sauce up and then freeze it in ice trays for later use. It freezes really well.

This was a delicious way to add some flavor to Tilapia which can be pretty bland. Despite what the other reviews are saying, I added more chipotle than the recipe says and I didn't find it too spicy--just right. I love how this recipe is also super healthy because it hardly has any oil.

All about how you cook the fish. I wrapped the whole filet in foil to keep the juices in. Also the sauce is really gentle, and I preffer to make more than the recipe specifies

This is a very flavorful dish. I would recommend using a small food processor to puree. It is a little too spicy for children but I will absolutely make it again. I reduced the oil to 1 tablespoon and used mild olive oil instead of vegetable oil.

I love Tilapia and this recipe does not disappoint. I put 1/3 of each Tilapia on a small soft taco shell and covered with the Mexican Pinapple Salad and some sour cream. I cut the salad up extra fine to be more of a salsa. I also eyeball the chipotles and adobo and it ended up being extra spicy... be careful if you don't like hot stuff.

I have used this recipe a thousand times for parties! The tilapia has such depth of flavor that anyone would love it. The only thing I would change is the amount of the chipotle you blend in with the cilantro. It was a bit spicy for some. Other than that, it was a very easy recipe to follow, and an exceptional dish.

I used this recipes for fish tacos last night with excellent results. For the tilapia I stayed pretty true to the original recipe except I added a little lime juice. I served the fish on a corn tortilla with a little fresh tomato, avocado, and lettuce with some no-fry refried beans on the side.

Really? No Salt? Really? The other flavors in this recipe are delicious and go together really well. After adding salt to taste into the marinade I give this a solid 3 forks.

Very easy and pairs great with the Mexican Pineapple Salad.

I would try this recipe at least one more time. It was extremely spicy. I was born and raised in New Orleans and I am use to very seasoned, sometimes spicy, food, but this was too hot. Next time I will cut the chipotles in half if not more and maybe add a bit more cilantro because their flavor was masked by the peppers.

Not a big fan of Tilapia in the first place so tried this recipe, a bit too spicy for me, and I like spicy foods! the suggested Mexican Pineapple salad was very good however, will do the salad again but not the fish.

Rating: 3
This was an easy recipe and overall had a nice taste, but there was nothing overly special about it. I like my food spicy so increased the chipotle. It also really needs the pineapple salad to make it more of a complete dish. Be sure to add cilantro to the pineapple salad as well.

this is easy and awesome BUT you must like spicy

I made this the other night with the suggested salad, and it was a total hit! I like my food spicy, so I added a few more chipotle peppers to the recipe. Don't let the color fool you, it is delicious!

Rating: 4
Quite a good flavor but absolutely watch out for the peppers - you can go overboard very easily; I found the addition of the adobo sauce to be completely unnecessary, the peppers themselves were more than sufficient. I also cut back on the salt without effect and cooked these on an indoor grill vs. the broiler. Turned out excellent; definitely a keeper.

This turned out well. What I like best is that it takes very little time to cook. Quick tilapia dishes are a must for me. I almost didn't take the pairing suggestion (the pineapple salad), but am so glad I did. It's a great match and serves as a cooling effect to the spice. Will definitely make this again.

Didn't like so much.

Wow! This is now a regular in our recipe rotation. It is absolutely delicious, and spicy!!! One thing I've found I have to modify is the amount of cilantro -we had about two full bunches. The cumin is also key. Watch out for how much adobo sauce you add with the chipotles as it gets HOT. And if 1 tablespoon sounds like not too much, it IS. We've also made this with fresh wild cod, and that's been great. Leftovers are wonderful for fish tacos the next day too!

I absolutely loved this, as did my husband. This recipe is definitely easy and fast enough for a quick weeknight dinner. Since it is winter and the recommended salad seemed too summery (no good avocados now) I made this with frozen corn mixed with brown rice. As everyone else said, leftover sauce makes a great supplement to fish tacos as well. I'll definitely put this in the regular rotation.

Having just recently discovered the delight that is chipotles en adobo, this recipe had perfect timing. Instead of pureeing the mixture, I chopped everything fine and whisked things together -- I liked the look better than that of a puree. I forgot to add the cumin, but I did put in some salt and pepper and substituted lime juice for the water. I also sliced up some onion and chili peppers and bathed them in the sauce with the fish to give the dish overall some better texture. It was delightful.

My husband LOVED this dish. He especially like it with the recommended pineapple salad, and cayenne red-skinned roasted potatoes. He doesn't want me to ever make tilapia any other way again. Next time - I'll puree the cilantro even finer.

4 Forks for easy, quick, and all ingredients on hand. I made a mistake and doubled the chilis, but not too hot. Has anyone marinated pork loin or beef with the sauce??

In addition - I had left over cilantro / chipolte sauce and the next night brushed over some Shrimp and broiled them to make shrimp tacos - Really really great!

This was a surprise hit out of the park. I followed the recipe and it did end up with more texture then a creamy sauce - but I think it rather added to it. Then add a lovely piece of Tilapia - it was perfection. Served with the Pineaple salad which was a wonderful pairing of sweet and smooth creamy avocado that was delightful with the fish. Then some brown basmati rice with fresh cilantro - One of my favorite meals of the summer so far! A complete hit!

Great light summer dish. We grilled it instead of broiling it and it turned out delicious. I would definitely recommend the pineapple salad as a side dish, with some white rice seasoned with cilantro. YUM!

Rating: 4
This hit our tastebuds just right. When I made the sauce, I didn't puree it to a pulp, but left it with some texture from cilantro leaves and seeds from the chipotle, and it didn't come out ugly like the other reviewers mentioned, so that might be the trick! I served it with brown basmati with shaved parmesan and green tomatoes stir fried in an iron skillet, deglazed with a touch of water and sour cream. Everything tasted great, but it was a tad too much green and white!

We used this recipe for fish tacos and it was a big hit. Definitely make the Mexican Pineapple Salad as an accompaniment. The salad really adds brightness and acid that pairs well with the fish.

I made the recipe just as it says, except I grilled the fish rather than broiled it. I must admit that I thought it was rather bland in flavor, but pretty spicy (HOT). I love chipotles and tilapia, but wasn't too impressed with this recipe. I'd try it again with some modifications... maybe some lime?

The perfect blend of spices for the tilapia, and a truly complementing mexican pineapple salad on the side makes this a very satisfying meal.

Very good tilapia recipe. This dish is extremely easy to make and really takes about 20 minutes to make. I brushed both sides of the tilapia and then poured the remainder of the sauce on the top of the filets.

Super easy and tasty recipe. I won't give it four forks simply because this isn't a dish that will blow you away. But it is something delicious that you can throw together within minutes. The perfect weekday meal. For a nice finish add a little butter and salt when the fish comes out of the oven.

I didn't really notice the flavor on the fish and it turned pretty dark. I did really like the pinapple avocado salsa.

This recipe rocked! I read the reviews about the sauce turning black and purposefully kept the fish about 6 inches away from the heat source and cooked it for the full 9 minutes. I served it with a beet, orange, red onion side dish. I bet the pineapple dish would be excellent with it. Highly recommend.

Awesome. We almost doubled the sauce recipe with 2 more fish filets. Definitely spicy and flavorful. The sauce is basically a cilantro pesto. Served with rice and broccoli, next time we'll try the jicama.

Astoundingly good. I generally don't like tilapia (it's so mild) but this turned out with an incredibly smoky-spicy (not hot) flavor and incredibly moist, tender fish. Can't wait to make this again!

My husband thought this recipe was excellent. As one reviewer said, the topping did turn black. I thought it was fair. However, it was a great combination with the pineapple/jimaca salad by taking a bite of fish along with the salad. I did make some changes in the salad, used lime juice in place of vinegar and added chili powder to taste.

I've never cooked tilapia before, but my boyfriend is a huge fan of it. This recipe is quick and easy. He loved the recipe as is. However, like some of the other cooks, next time I would add a bit more salt and pepper and more of the adobo sauce.

This recipe is simple and stupendous. I would use more jicama in the Mexican salad and perhaps a little less onion.

This was really good and unbelievably fast. We cook with chipotles a lot, and store our extras in an ice cube tray in the freezer. I literally plunked a frozen cube o' chile, a handful of cilantro and the other ingredients in the blender and in under a minute had a sauce ready to go. I think I used less cilantro than some of the other posters - I just yanked off a handful and threw it in. The only drawback to the dish was that when it came out of the oven it was kind of ugly. The sauce darkened and got bubbly. My husband suggested I submit a photo of it to cakewrecks in the hopes one day they'll post photos of ugly fish dishes. But, don't despair if it doesn't look good. It tastes great. Served it with fresh pineapple and fresh cilantro for a tasty, light dinner.

I was afraid this would be too spicy, but it was excellent. I served it with rice and some steamed brocolli dressed with salt, pepper and very good olive oil, which was very quick and worked well. I broiled the fish for a shorter period of time then recommended, but made no other changes. I will definitely make this again. Very fast, very easy and very inexpensive!

The sauce is very spicy. My boyfriend and I had to eat each bite full with some rice, or it would have been intolerable. The taste was not as I imagined either. It was very smoky, but instead of complimenting the fish, it overpowered it completely.

I thought the cilantro overpowered the sauce and needed more sugar/salt. It really needs a strong side dish to pair with it and did not stand alone well.

We loved this recipe. I used a little more chipoltes, about 1.5 tablespoon - my ultra-heat sensitive fiance actually loved it. I put about 2 teaspoons of adobo sauce extra in, I would probably put a little more in next time. The dish paired exceptionally well with the recommended pineapple salad which cooled the palate nicely.
