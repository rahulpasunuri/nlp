I love trying new recipes, but I think I'm making this one every Thanksgiving, it was that good

This is another tasty variation on the holiday staple, and would be good with all kinds of dishes. I added some subtle spice by steeping a cheesecloth bundle of cinnamon stick, whole cloves, and crushed cardamom pods in the sugar syrup for half an hour before proceeding.

Made this for Thanksgiving 2002-easy, delicious and a little different than most other cranberry dishes.

Very simple to make and is great for Thanksgiving and Christmas.
