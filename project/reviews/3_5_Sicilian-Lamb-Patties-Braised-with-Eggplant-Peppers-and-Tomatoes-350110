It tasted all right, flavors slightly too subtle for my tastes, but I agree that there were way too many steps in the recipe for the results (and for the home cook). I've had great results just roasting a pan of eggplants, tomatoes and pepper....if I make this again, I'll just roast all the veggies. Then I'll sear the lamb patties, cook up the onion and garlic in the fat, add the wine to deglaze, and add the roasted veggies to stew. I'm pretty sure you'd get the same result in half the time.

Oh, one adjustment I did make to the recipe was we did not serve it with any starch at all. Just the meat and veggies. Perfect.

Delicious, aromatic and comforting. I loved this dish and will definitely be making it again. I would suggest drinking white wine with it and finishing with chocolate cake.

Recipe could be easier to follow. Lots of steps can be interleaved, but if you follow it as written you waste a lot of time. E.g. you can cook the patties while the eggplant is baking. It tasted really good once done, but it seemed to take a lot of time and effort.

I made a vegetarian version of this recipe, and it was good, but there are better recipes on this website for eggplant, etc. I also thought it was a waste of heirloom tomatoes, which are expensive. otherwise, if you are looking for a different recipe, this is a decent choice, but i wouldn't rave about it.

Love this dish to use up the last of the summer vegetables from the garden. Everyone loves this dish when served with a cold beer or Rioja.

11/3/10 Used can diced tom, whole eggplant, frozen peppers, and Ital. sausage, Maine-Made, cut in half (links), Oregano, as no marjoram. Excellent!! Served over polenta, made from mix.

I made a lot of changes to this. I used ground beef in place of the lamb, since the store didn't have lamb. I used a hard white cheese, grana padano. The wine was a sweet semillon, and the bed was a medley of rices (red, wild, brown). The mint in the meat was very prominent (tasty!).

This recipe was excellent. I made three adjustments to it: 1) no polenta (which reduced the time spent on making the dish), replaced it with rice. 2) Used red wine instead of white. It gave the dish much more flavour. 3) Less cheese in the patties. It gave the herbs and spices a chance to express themselves! All in all, a great, flavour bursting dish, and a great way to enjoy eggplants and peppers.

I love the way this recipe turns out, using up the best of the end of summer vegetables and filling the house with lovely smells. I've substituted ground veal for the times I cannot get lamb to great success - just add a little more spice. Pork would probably work as well as turkey. I love this dish.

My husband, a retired professional chef, and I, both with discriminating palates thought the dish was lacking in flavor. The vegetables turned out beautifully but in my opinion the polenta had more flavor than the lamb which we normally love served in any way. We found this version boring and considering how putzy the recipe is, I will not go to the trouble of making it again. This is disappointing since on first reading the recipe I was practically salivating.

Made this for my Sicilian family's Christmas Eve gathering. I did everything exactly as called for and the result was delicious and flavorful. Even the two people who didn't care for lamb loved this dish. A previous reviewer said it was too much work, but I don't agree, and thought it was well worth it. I will make this again and again.

This is one of the most delicious meals that has ever come out of our kitchen! It took about 1.5 hours from start to finish and was easy but a little time consuming - completely worth the results, however. We used two eggplants, de-bittered them before roasting, and roasted them at a 425 until they began to brown. Unfortunately we didn't have any polenta or cornmeal, so we served it over orzo which worked in a pinch. Also, we replaced the marjoram with fresh basil in the patties. This would be fabulous for company and will become part of our regular rotation.

Took way too long to make; not worth it.

excellent dish! I accidently bought ground lamb instead of beef and then searched for a recipe using lamb. This one was so good we can't wait to have the leftovers tomorrow. I am greek and this dish reminded me of the smell in my grand mother,s kitchen. I served it over arborio rice. Awesome!

I have yet to make the whole recipe; I wanted lamb burgers, and this recipe makes 6 nice patties. I used dried herbs: 1/2 tbsp of mint and marjoram plus 1 tsp of herbs de province. Also used panko instead of breadcrumbs. Truly fabulous; we may never make (beef) hamburgers again.

Delicious!! Was looking for a dinner I could throw together without having to grocery shop. Have ground lamb in the freezer and followed the recipe except I used jarred red peppers and canned tomatoes. No marjoram, used some fresh parsley and thyme. Served over polenta with a simple spring mix tossed with evoo and lemon juice. Would serve this at a dinner party. Cooked partially and reheated after enjoying a bon-fire with my family.

Really excellent dish. I doubled the recipe and served it to a dinner party of 12. Not a morsel was left over. I also added marjoram to the patties only, not the sauce. I used pasta instead of polenta. I will definitely make this again.

I thought this was delish! I agree with the reviewer who said to add more eggplant. And I didn't add any marjoram to the sauce, since another reviewer said that there was too much in the dish. But having said that I loved this - almost licked my plate - my sweetie took one bite - literally one bite - and pronounced it inedible. The first time in 7 years he's ever done that. He was a shepherd during summers in his younger days, and he can be "funny" about lamb - loves leg of lamb, but is iffy about anything else. I bought local organic lamb, which I thought should suit his palate, but obviously it didn't. But again, I really loved it.

I discovered this recipe when I was trying to figure out how to use up some excessive CSA bounty (egglants, peppers, tomatoes). It's delicious, although a bit labor intensive for a lazy cook like me.

There is way too much marjoram in this dish! It is overpowering and ruined the whole dinner. I would say to skip it all together, and add either basil or rosemary in it's place.

I doubled the recipe and made this dish the other evening for my family and everyone loved it. Only changes I would make is adding another eggplant for a single recipe or 2 additional if doubling. Other than that I wouldn't change a thing. For the polenta I only had yellow cornmeal and used chicken broth instead of water and added grated Parmesan cheese and a little smart balance during the cooking process. I also made tossed salad. I had enough left for another meal but need to cook up some additional eggplant and tomato mixture because everyone ate the sauce made in the original batch. This is a winner!
