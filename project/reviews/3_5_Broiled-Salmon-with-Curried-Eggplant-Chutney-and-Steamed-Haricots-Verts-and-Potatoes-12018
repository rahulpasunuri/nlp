i also used 2T brown sugar for the chutney and it was plenty. The parsley didn't add much so don't worry if you don't have any. I chopped the eggplant and other pieces at 1/4 inch instead of 1/2 inch and the texture was nice. I served it with rice and the chutney/rice combo was nice.

This was very tasty and fragrant. It makes a lot and I ended up using the leftovers on pasta and as a side to roast chicken. My only complaint is that the eggplant was rubbery but then I might have done that wrong. I let it drain for awhile before putting it in oil. I served it with a Tunisian-style Grilled Halibut I found on about.com. That was absolutely delicious and I'm adding the recipe to my Epicurious recipe box if you want to try something easy and great.

After reading the ingredient list I had a good idea we were in for a treat. And it certainly was. I had some challenges...I was out of curry and so had to blend my own. But I was out of ground cumin and had to grind my seeds. I only had balsamic with lemon but used it anyway. And it was great. I did both the chutney and salmon and served them with pasta. It is kind of sweet but it made for a nice change to our typical tastes. Next time I'll throw in some raisins and capers and cut back on the sugar. Make this dish-it's easy and very tasty. You won't be disappointed.

This was surprisingly good! I just used 1 tablespoon of sugar and used red onion since I only had green bell pepper. I did marinate the fish for a while as a previous reviewer had mentioned.

loved it! my husband isn't much for sweet food but really liked the chutney on the salmon. We left out the mustard seeds and parsley (didn't have any) and red pepper (i disike them)-- husband added some hot sauce and said it was great like that! Oh, also used red wine vinegar since we were out of balsamic, it was still really good.

This is quicker than it looks -- 30 mins start to finish if you chop fast enough and don't worry about cooling the chutney mixture completely. And a good use of the odd bits and pieces from the summer garden.

so easy to throw together and VERY delicious! the salmon on its own is perfect, as is the chutney, but the combination of the two is so convincing that you'll want to eat them together as well. great foolproof recipe, this is my new go-to for impressive but easy. served with epicurious's grilled eggplant with yogurt-mint sauce (we like eggplant) and the chutney/yogurt combo was a hit.

next time i would add less brown sugar to the chutney, as it was too sweet and not quite spicy enough, even though I added extra mild curry powder. The salmon was delicious broiled, but it took closer to 10 minutes. I loved the marinade, and I would keep the salmon in it for 20 minutes or so rather than just coating it before putting it in the oven. very healthy and filling

This was delicious. I hardly made any changes at all...I left out the parsley only because I don't like it and I added minced garlic because garlic should be in everything. For the vegetable...I just sauteed cut up potatoes and green beans in olive oil with some garlic. Delightful meal.

Very easy and delicious. I made the chutney ahead of time and served it warm and it was a big hit. Had to cook the salmon fillets longer than 7 minutes and turn on their side to cook thoroughly.

i just made the curried eggplant chutney -- it was so hard to mess up and ended up great.

Nicely balanced meal; the flavors and textures work very well together. Considering the relatively low fat content, this is also quite a filling dish. (We ate 2 servings each.) Would definitely make it again.

I thought the egglant chutney was just delicious -will definitely make this again to go other fishes and meats. Watch the cooking time of the salmon carefully - the brown sugar in the marinade can burn easily. I've made this twice so far - second time I subbed Swiss chard for green beans (haricots verts).

This was good, and my guests liked it, but I didn't think it was great. The eggplant, probably because it wasn't drenched in oil, was a bit spongy, and the flavors didn't meld wonderfully. I might make it again, but I'd probably do another salsa/relish that's at least as easy and just as good/better(e.g., mango) for my salmon instead.

I give this recipie four forks because it is both delicious and low in fat. (It's easy to create wonderful tasting food if you have free reign with the butter, cream, etc.) My husband doesn't like eggplant, but he loved this chutney. I reduced the brown sugar to 2 T. and it was plenty sweet enough. I served this with Lemon, Rosemary and Toasted Walnut Couscous and a side of green beans (instead of potatoes). A menu that I'm sure to repeat!

A great, easy low-fat dish that includes a delectable vegetable side-dish. I found it to be a crowd-peaser.
