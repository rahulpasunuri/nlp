To Idesanto I think if you use a pretty glass the aura is prettier than if you had used a homely glass, which would have had a less than stellar aura! :)

The marscapone cream is amazing -- would be good to serve directly over fresh fruit, or a shortcake. The gingerbread seemed a little bland - - maybe it needs more ginger and other spices. The kumquats seemed too labor intensive for the end effect.

I made this for a girls Christmas party and all were impressed. Even those that typically pass on sweets were all in for this one. The flavors shine over sweetness making it perfect for adults. Due to some of the other reveiws I contemplated using another gingerbread recipe that i love but was glad i used this one as it has strong flavors from the stout and cardamon that really stand up to the cream.

This is an absolutely stunning dessert. I would make it again, but it is NOT for the faint of budget! The Marscapone alone was $18.00. That said, it was spectacular and the only changes I would make would be to leave a little of the syrup in both the kumquats and cranberries to soak into the cake. This makes it even more grand. Also, I think you ould get away with 2/3 of the cream mixture. I had quite a bit left over. Labor intensive, but worth it.

I like the way the note at the top indicating instructions for individual trifles says "Using a pretty glass as a guide, cut out 4 cake rounds from each cut cake layer." Why does the glass have to be pretty if you're using it only as a guide? Wouldn't an ugly glass make rounds just as well?

This is labor intensive but totally worth it. I followed the recipe exactly and it was scarfed up in short order!

I followed the recipe exactly for the gingerbread but I do not recommend "reversing the positions of the pans in the oven halfway through". My cakes flopped and I ended up starting over with a different gingerbread recipe. Assembled, it is an impressive holiday dessert and very delicious.

Fantastic! Made it once and couldn't find kumquats so I just used cranberries and it was still delicious. Now that kumquats are (finally) available, I'll be making it again this weekend for a Valentine's Day party!

Wonderful. I used fresh cranberries. I used the leftover liquid from the kumquats as part of the sweetening for an apple strudel.

This is perfect - holidayish and beautiful. Everyone enjoyed it very much! I had exactly the right size trifle dish and had cream and the third cake left over. My cake batter was also thin and turned out fine, however, I had problems getting the cakes out of the pan (despite liberal butter and flour) and would recommend putting parchment paper rounds in the bottom of each pan. I also cut the kumquats in rounds, which is not hard with a very sharp knife and firm kumquats; I also felt it made the trifle more attractive.

A note on the "thin" batter. Yes, it is thin, but I've made other gingerbread cakes with thin batters similar to this one. So I wasn't that surprised. Everything turned out just fine without bulking up the batter with more flour. Follow the recipe....it didn't lie to me at all.

This took a lot of time to make but was not complicated (the hardest part was finding a trifle dish three days before Christmas). I agree with an earlier reviewer that the cake batter wasn't as thick as I expected; however, I baked the cakes without thickening the batter and they turned out just fine. Also, I quartered the kumquats while seeding them, and I don't think this detracted from the dish's taste or appearance. Finally, I couldn't find light molasses (I went to five stores) so I used the called-for amount of regular (not blackstrap) molasses, which didn't make the cakes too sweet. Overall, this was a crowd-pleasing dish!

I want to make this but I can't find kumquats. Any ideas for a substitute?

Is it just me or was the cake batter way too thin? I can't imagine that it would ever have cooked through. I had to add an extra cup of flour. I just made the cakes today so I haven't assembled it yet. I hope the cake won't be too heavy. Did anyone else have the same problem?

This was a showstopper for a staff Christmas party and one that I'd make again. I had a larger trifle bowl so used all three cakes, and increased the recipe for everything else by 50%. The presentation was big, showy, and impressive. The overall flavour reminded me of traditional English christmas pudding :-) I did keep the syrup left over from the cranberries and it is WONDERFUL! Vodka, soda and cranberry syrup was a hit with a couple friends and it's even great drizzled over a scoop of the little bit of leftover trifle I have. Next time I make my own cranberry sauce, I'm skipping the water and using the Syrah! Be sure to dedicate some time to slicing and seeding the kumquats. Now THAT was a fussy little job!

First to the typo. There are some words left off the directions for the candied Kumquats. The sentences should read,(according to the magazine) "Add kumquats; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until soft and translucent, about 10 minutes. Transfer mixture to medium bowl." What does it mean to "slice" the kumquats? The picture in the magazine makes it clear that they wanted rounds. I tried that and slicing them from pole to pole. I found it easier to seed them if sliced pole to pole. (I never thought I would be seeding a kumquat!) When you slice in rounds you end up taking everything out of the middle, too. But whatever floats your boat! This is time consuming, BUT IT IS WORTH IT! The presentation alone is wonderful and I can still hear tha applause when I put it on the table. The taste is wonderful! The fruity/ sweet flavors come out in the candied kumquats and poached cranberries. Everyone raved over the fruit. And this is a good gingerbread cake recipe. All in all....a keeper.
