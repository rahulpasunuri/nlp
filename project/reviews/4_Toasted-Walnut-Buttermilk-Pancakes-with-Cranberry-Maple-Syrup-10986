My family loved the cranberry maple syrup. The children licked their plates! Easy, fast and a crowd pleaser.

These were great--made just enough for 2, very easy. I just put some dried cranberries in the maple syrup and warmed it as usual. Great recipe to use up buttermilk bought for another. Great brunch recipe and I think it would double easily

These are delicious! I used organic fat-free yogurt mixed with rice milk instead of buttermilk.

This was nice but not great. The batter was WAY too thick for pancakes so I diluted it with more buttermilk. Overall it provided a nice breakfast but not worth making again.
