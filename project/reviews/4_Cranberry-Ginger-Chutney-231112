Excellent. Great flavor. Made exactly as is but cut down on the sugar a bit. Wish I had doubled the recipe because there wasn't enough left for my Thanksgiving turkey leftovers.

This has become a Thanksgiving staple as the spicyness and complexity is a perfect accompaniment to turkey. I also use a microplane grater instead of chopping the ginger. No need to up the crushed red pepper, it has kick as written.

Our family LOVES this in addition to the traditional sweet stuff. I grate the ginger on a microplane grater and think it helps the flavors meld more quickly. Have always made as directed but this year may try adding the cinnamon stick and ground cloves to make it even more complex. I also think more pear might be good. It really is easy and super delicious spicy addition to the Thanksgiving table.

Really simple and easy! Cut down on the ginger, unless you REALLY like ginger, and definitely make it 1-2 days ahead. Makes a huge difference letting the flavours marry overnight. Added a cinnamon stick to the pot, but only simmered it for 10 minutes, then took the stick out for the last 10. I just wanted a hint of it, nothing more. Leftovers are excellent served on a toasted baguette!

I've made this a couple of times and love the ginger kick that it gives. Personally I prefer a lot more tart and a lot less sweet, so reduce the sugar somewhat. Leftovers are excellent in turkey sandwiches with melted cheese :)

This is my first time attempting Cranberry for Thanksgiving. An absolutely amazing recipe! Delicious... Loved the amount of ginger/crushed red pepper and the vinegar enhanced the flavors!! I would use just a little less sugar next time. It's definitely a keeper for every holiday!!

Rave reviews 2007 Thanksgiving especially from the teenagers. I liked the way it jelled easily and therefore easy to transport. Added a stick of cinnamon and 5 whole cloves- otherwise made as directed.

Made for thanksgiving and all loved this. Made as directed, the ginger was not overpowering. Used the leftovers with roasted garlic and cambozola on baguette slices.. mmmmm.

Made this for Thanksgiving...even those who are not fans of cranberry loved this stuff. I used a bit less ginger than called for but otherwise followed the recipe. Made it 2 days ahead and allowed the flavors to meld together. The ginger flavor was a bit more subtle than when I first tasted it the day I made it. Besides serving it with dinner, I made an appetizer using it also. Toasted some french bread slices, topped it with carmelized onions, a bit of the chutney and bleu cheese crumbled on top...broiled it til the cheese melted....people ate it up.

Amazingly delicious, and a big hit at our 2004 Thanksgiving meal.

So much better than the cloying and tart cranberry sauces I'm used to. It's the adult version of a childhood classic. Not too sweet, not too sour and very interesting with the spicy ginger haunting your tastebuds in the background. But be careful, the amount of ginger the recipe calls for is a little too much.

This is a great recipe and the crushed red pepper adds just enough spice. My husband and I both hated the apple cider vinegar --- although we followed the recipe exactly, the vinegar taste was just overpowering. We had to make a new batch without it. Also, I always have to add cornstarch to make it thicken. But it's becoming a family fave.

I never really liked the cranberry mush served at Thanksgiving dinner by very good cooks, but I LOVE this chutney. After having it over Thanksgiving, I acquired the recipe and have made it twice in the last 2 weeks just for myself. Absolutely delicious.

This is the best cranberry sauce I've ever made. Not too sweet, just right.

This is sensational. I'll be making this throughout the year, not just at Thanksgiving. Even the less adventurous at our table liked this.

I do like the idea of cranberry ginger chutney, and would make this again, but what were they thinking? 1/4 CUP of ginger? AND Red Pepper!? Next time I will reduce the ginger to 3 tablespoons, skip the pepper, and add an extra pear.

Wonderful addition to the Thanksgiving table. The perfect combination of the cranberry, ginger, and pear with a hint of heat from the crushed pepper leaves with a lot of flavor.

Definitely a keeper. The flavors are delicious, though I may add a touch more ginger next time.

We loved this chutney w/our roast turkey this Thanksgiving. I didn't have cider, so I used water for fear of overwhelming the flavors w/additional vinegar which appears as an option. I added an additional pear for added texture and flavor. Delicious!

When I first tried this on Thanksgiving day, I was cranberried-out as we had 5 other cranberry dishes at dinner so I didn't appreciate the flavor. I had it again Friday with a smoked turkey: AMAZING. I now find yself looking for other leftovers with which to eat the chutney. If you don't care for ginger, it might be a bit over-powering but I love the dish as is.

My family loved this. It is perfectly balanced, neither too sweet nor too tart, and with just the right amount of ginger. It will become our new standard.

This is delicious and it went beautifully with the turkey breast roulade from the same menu. I used the ginger I had - probably not a full 1/4 cup. More like 2 large tablespoons. But this will become my standard recipe for cranberry sauce.

I've never cared much for cranberry sauce, but this chutney is delicious. Between the ginger and the pepper, it's a wake-up call for you mouth.

i just made this for thanksgiving and it's just what i want for a change of pace from regular cranberry sauce! it's got great heat, sour and sweetness. i added one small minced shallot, less chile than called for, and a couple tablespoons of raisins. yum.

I just made this for Thursday's dinner, and I thought the combination of pears and ginger with the cranberries sounded nice. The ginger is just SO overwhelming...I questioned the recipe when I saw 1/4 cup of ginger, and even cut back a little - it is still too strong for me. Next time I will also use less vinegar, more crushed red pepper, and LESS GINGER.
