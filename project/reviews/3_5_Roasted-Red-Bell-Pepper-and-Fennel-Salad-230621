Very good. The lemon tames the fennel quite nicely. Instead of olives, I marinated some mushrooms. Then, instead of combining, I placed 1 scoop of each on a bed of spinach. While I marinated the mushrooms, I only put the dressing on the fennel and the peppers just before serving.

This salad is lovely. I liked that the dressing was largely lemon and garlic.

One of our favorite healthy and different recipes---easy, too! Very little fat, but lots of flavors!

Had this at a dinner party and it was quite tasty. Everyone felt that there was too much red pepper though. Try it as written, perhaps it was cook's error. But it is still good, and rather different.
