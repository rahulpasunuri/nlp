I agree with the reviewer below, this is a delicious alternative to creme caramel. Not a fan of flaked coconut, I did not add it and did not miss it. I will make it again (and again.) I would give it 4 forks but 3 forks = delicious. So 3 forks it is.

I followed the recipe closely, as it was my first time making flan. I normally don't like flan (it reminds me of gross milky jello instead of custard) but I made it for a themed potluck and friend requested flan. It was seriously the best flan (and one of the best desserts) I've ever eaten.

I made this to go with paella. I used 2 tsp vanilla extract, as I didn't have the bean. Evryone loved it and requested the recipe

An delicious alternative to creme caramel. Great coconut flavor, even without the flaked coconut.
