The ingredients called for are rather pretencious, but can easily be substituted with any spicy pork sausage your family likes, the mustard is the sauce for this sandwich. You can simply soak peelings from a ginger root overnight in a few tablespoons water, add to your brown mustard with the ginger, and perhaps add sugar to taste. Any hard crusted bread will serve as a holder, and Roma tomatoes get my thumbsup!
