I followed the recipe for the most part and it ended up tasting like boiled onions. Maybe because I didn't sauté long enough...

easy and awesome. all loved it. i used as much fresh sage as i pulled from my gargen, which was probably 1 tablespoon. more would be good too. get the liquid to reduce as much as possible as the balsamic as a "paste" was awesome. great recipe.

I really wanted to like this recipe. I even read all 8 pages of reviews and took the advice of the majority to double the sage, reduce broth etc. I ended up with a delightful flavor, but my squash never became tender even after cooking for almost 20 min.

easy and delicious - I added a little garlic, just 'cause we like it, but I'm sure it's great with or without. It was even better the next day mixed into a little wild rice.

Delicious, quick butternut squash recipe! Like other users suggested, I cut down on the liquid a bit (to 1/3 cup). I also doubled the brown sugar and substituted some rosemary sprigs for the sage - turned out great!

Rating: 4
Everyone, including my 5 year old, loved this side dish - so much so that for once I didn't have leftovers. I also added more sage and a little less brown sugar than the recipe calls for since I had a smaller sized squash. If you use a small squash, I would cut down on the broth. I thought there was a little too much liquid, but the result was still delicious.

Melt-in-your-mouth delicious! I added extra sage per previous reviews. I served with the Roasted Chicken with Garbanzo Beans recipe on this site, and the spicy-ness of that dish was a perfect pair to the sweetness of this one.

My husband and I love squash but this is definitely our new fave! I subbed a delicata for the butternut and tripled the amount of fresh sage but otherwise followed the recipe exactly and it was outstanding!

I was looking to do something different with butternut squash and I have to say I loved this dish! It was really easy and very tasty. I did like the others and added more sage. I was also a little heavier handed with the balsamic vinegar because I love it. I will make this again...and again.

I was feeling lazy, tonight, so I just steamed the chunks of squash in the microwave, drained them, and then tossed them in the olive oil and seasonings. It still came out delicious! Next time I'll follow the recipe, exactly, and I'll bet it will be even better.

Delicious. I doubled or tripled the sage, since I have some plants still offering their best in December. As with most of these butternut squash recipes, I roast then follow the recipe. I imagine the less-than-rapturous reviews are from those who chomped away at squash that was half-cooked at best. I'll be spreading this over a basic risotto for tomorrow's office party. This would also go well alongside a plate of plainly cooked lentils. Perhaps a toss of toasted walnuts. If you cook it down more than requested by the recipe, it goes well as a spread on bread. And on and on... Try, experiment, enjoy!

So easy and unbelievably delicious. I made it just as the recipe says. You could increase the sage just a bit. It sounds like roasting would also work well. It was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. Even my picky partner liked it. I will be making it again.

I roasted the squash separately in the oven for about 15-20 min on 400 Convection Roast (it started to lose tenderness at this point). Followed the rest of the recipe as described using about half the brown sugar; simmered to reduce the liquid down a bit. Then combined the squash & added the balsamic. Served as a side to lamb chops over orecchiette pasta. The kids loved it. Roasted pine nuts or pepitas would have added texture and rounded out the dish enough to stand as it's own meal.

This was OK, nothing special and not worth the effort of peeling and cutting the squash.

Rating: 3
I second a previous recommendation to bake instead of braise. It came out of the oven beautifully and deliciously carmelized. I mixed everything together (with only 1/4c. water) and baked at 450 for about 45 minutes. Be sure to turn frequently since the sugar in the mix can cause things to burn.

I thought this was really delicious, and I'm not even a huge butternut squash fan. I prepared it as written (although I only had dried sage on hand), however I just put ALL of the ingredients into a corningware dish and then roasted the whole thing in the oven at 500 degrees for about 50 minutes. Definitely recommend!

Made this for Thanksgiving and my squash hating husband is still talking about it. I had already baked the squash when I hunted up the recipe, so mine was creamy. The balsamic does kill the nice color a bit, but does so much for the flavor, as does the sage. Will stay on our Thanksgiving menu for next year!

A delicious butternut squash recipe. Have made more than once and will be making it for Thanksgiving, again, this year.

Rating: 3
Delicious! Next time I will use slightly less balsamic and perhaps a little more sugar. The balsamic dulled the bright orange and gave it an unwanted sour kick. Also I exchanged the olive oil for butter to give it a deeper flavor. If looking for aesthetic appeal be careful not to mash the squash chunks when transferring to serving dish and to plates.

Looooove it!!! I, too, bumped the sage up (to two teaspoons chopped)

I might give this four forks but I need to reserve that for the very best of the best. I almost made this recipe verabtim. I used the seasonings as suggested. But, I cut the squash in half and baked for 50 minutes, and the diced into the 1/2 chunks, and threw in with already sauteuning shallots. Baking a squash just adds to intensity of flavor.

This was a really tasty, easy, and new way to prepare squash. I used yellow onions and dried sage which was fine. I liked that the squash was still crunchy-ish. Very good.

AWESOME! However, I apologize this review is actually of an inspired version of this recipe. I started out believing I had all the ingredients. Once started, reality hit. The result was DELICIOUS and my husband has requested I write down exactly what I did and not change a thing. I thought I'd share: Follow recipe proportions as given. Made these changes: 4 slices bacon (cut into small pieces.) Cook bacon, add cubed squash (had acorn squash on hand) to pan with bacon and cook for about 5 minutes. (may need to add a little bit of olive oil/butter), add shallots, cook another 3-4 minutes. Add broth (I used beef broth, did not have chicken broth), salt, pepper, a tiny bit of sage and about 2 TBS brown sugar. I omitted the balsamic vinegar. Simmered til broth mixture cooked away then served. This absolutely will be added to our staple recipe file. Even my 9 year old son who "doesn't do squash" said he loved it.

I followed the suggestions of the other reviewers: Increase to 2 tsps balsamic vinegar AND Use 1 tsp finely chopped DRIED sage It was quite easy, fast and delicious

A very nice squash dish that convinced my non-squash-liking father to eat it, because (as he said) the squash wasn't mushy and it was well-seasoned. Criticisms, however: 1) Putting squash and shallot together interferes somewhat in the squash browning, becuase of the liquid produced by the shallot. For prettier, browned squash, I would omit the shallot until later. 2) It's a bit pickly. More seasoned chefs at the table identified a "saurkraut" flavor, not surprising given that sugar, onions and vinegar all made it to the recipe. Nevertheless: my father liked it. That, itself, deserves several forks.

Rating: 3
This dish was pretty good... once I made some changes. I found the squash and shallots (actually I used shallot-sized onions) an excellent combination. The sage was a good addition - I used twice as much. At the end of cooking I found it a little plain for my liking. I omitted the vinegar and added 2 Tbsp of butter to give it a really rich finish, and this did the trick. A very grown-up flavour, though, even with the sugar - the kids were not convinced.

Rating: 3
This was very tasty. I tripled the sage based on previous reviews and it came out very yummy. The only problem was that my squash was a bit undercooked although I cooked it even longer than the recipe called for. Maybe my cubes were too large? In any case, will definitely make again and highly recommend.

Absolutely delicious and easy too. I am a squash lover, but even my non-lover husband loved this dish. I don't usually like sugar added to my squash dishes, but I added it here and did not find it too sweet. Wonderful with the slightly caramelized shallots.

Try the cubed butternuts with the recipe on this site for the honey glazed parsnips.......fabulous!

I embarked on this recipe thinking I had all the ingredients in the fridge only to discover that my shallots were dead and the sage was nowhere to be found. I substituted red onion for shallots and Bell poultry seasoning for sage and it still came out really well. Will definitely make it again (and may even use the actual ingredients next time!) =od

Made a large batch with extra sage and loved it. Husband thought it was even better the next day when I added chicken broth and used an immersion blender to turn it into soup. For a side dish, I would cut down on the liquid next time, although it came in handy when making the soup.

This was a huge hit at this year's Thanksgiving -- beautiful and tasty! Completely agree with other reviewers that the amount of sage as given is absurdly small. I left out the broth/water entirely, as the dish didn't seem to need any additional liquid. You definitely need to be a fan of butternut squash to like this, I think, as the flavor is very clean and pronounced against the background of the other ingredients.

I brought this to a Thanksgiving dinner, and got rave reviews, even from a couple guys who don't usually like squash. Like others, I used a lot more sage, and also (to keep it vegetarian) used apple juice instead of broth. Just before serving, we reheated it gently in the microwave, and it tasted as it had immediately after cooking.

I made this twice, both times with much more sage. Like others had mentioned- I usually do not follow recipes, I just get ideas from them. However, I pretty faithfully followed this one (even took the printout to the store for ingredients!) and the result was fantastic. I ate the leftovers cold the next day- surprisingly good!

I don't typically follow recipes line by line. Usually I just scan to get a general idea and then improvise to make it my own. This time, I followed the recipe precisely and I have to say I'm glad I did. This is a delicious way to enjoy butternut squash and I'll definitely make it again.

Loved it even the 2nd time. I have a fussy 14 year old who even liked it - told her they were sweet potatoes, and then fessed up! There's got to be a better way to peel the squash. It kept running away. Wound up using a paring knife....

I had recently eaten(in 2 different restaurants)butternut squash ravioli with butter/sage sauce which was incredible. I bought a butternut squash and wanted to try something different, so found this recipe. We loved it-not too sweet, mostly South Beach friendly, and will include it in side dish selections for the fall and winter. Used more sage than recipe called for and was perfect.

The squash took over our garden this season. My problem is what to do with all of them! I used a different winter squash. Didn't have shallots so I used green onions and garlic. Had to 'nuke' the halved and cleaned squash a bit to make it peelable....BUT still found this to be a great recipe..... if for nothing else, an inspiration to experiment with the rest of the bumper crop!

This recipe was so delicious and so easy! We like spicy food so next time I'm going to add a sliced jalapeno as an experiment. Otherwise, wouldn't change a thing. Don't save this dish for a special meal. It will make the meal special.

This was very good with modifications. I can't imagine why the recipe only calls for 1/2 tsp fresh sage--that might be a reasonable quantity if it called for dried sage, but you wouldn't even taste 1/2 tsp fresh. I used several tablespoons of chopped fresh sage and the flavor was not too strong. Based on the suggestion of another reviewer, I used half apple juice and half broth for the liquid. Finally, I used 3 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar, instead of the one called for in the recipe, which gave a flavor that was assertive but not overpowering. Two tablespoons would have been a bit more subtle; I don't think I'd have been able to taste one tablespoon at all. I used Kabocha squash because that's what I had in the house, but I'm sure it would taste much the same with butternut.

This sounded so good, I couldn't wait to try it. Unfortunately, we found it very disappointing. If I were inclined to try it again, I'd add alittle more sage and substitute the chicken broth with apple cider.

Absolutely delicious. I wish I could give 3.5 forks (Beyond Compare? not quite there.)

We found this recipe after picking up a squash at the farmers' market. A non squash eater gave it a 3 fork. The squash eaters thought it was a 4 all the way. The subtle blending savory and sweet with the sugar and fresh herbs was delightful ! Definitely a repeat...a great Autumn kick off. Served with Epicurians Cumin Pork Roast with Wild Mushroom Sauce. A great combo.
