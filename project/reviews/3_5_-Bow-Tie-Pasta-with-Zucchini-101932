I have been making this for years and love it. I add extra parmigiano and sometimes sauteed chicken, caramelized, sometimes with shallots. Add more liquid when you eat the leftovers. Zucchini does best when cooked at pretty high heat and flipped a lot. Otherwise it will be gooey - still tasty but not as pretty. Considering making it this afternoon as an extra dish for my BBQ even though I'm making Trader Joe's quinoa mix..

This was delicious. I used rice pasta to keep it gluten free, and infused the olive oil with a clove of garlic before adding the zucchini in the pan. I also added a little bit of lemon zest and chili pepper flakes at the end to give it a bit of a kick. The one big suggestion I would make, is that the recipe really needs no more than half the butter it calls for. And next time I might add even a little more basil.

This was a good way to use up some zucchini. It was just ok

I made this tonight. It was very good. I made it with angel hair pasta and I had some left over cooked salmon from last night. It was very good. You could do all sorts of variations, a good starting off point. Wish I had had this recipe years ago when we both were students and down on our uppers.

very good. I sauteed shallots with the zucchini. added lemon zest, toasted pine nuts, and shaved parmesan at the end, as well as salt. it needed the extra oomph.

A good way to use excess zucchini, but be sure to salt the finished product enough. I doubled the cheese.

I was looking for a way to show off that I had grown basil, tomatoes, and zucchini. Voila! I felt pretty darn smug! I followed the recipe exactly with the exception for my tomatoes that I threw in at the time of the basil in the recipe. The sweating with the salt is very important, don't skip it! It really brings out the zucchini flavor.

This was easy and delicious. I substituted whole grain rotini for the bow ties. My eight year old and I both loved it.

A good, quick weeknight meal. I only used half the basil called for, but I think it would have been better with the full amount.

Easy to make and delicious. Didn't have farfalle so used penne. Excellent. Will make again, perhaps add some mushrooms as suggested by another reviewer.

This recipe was really easy and I thought really delicious. I substituted spinach and tomato rotini and added quartered mushrooms and fresh garlic. The mushrooms really added to the dish. Definitely will make again!

Simple, delicious, a regular at our house. I usually add lots of garlic, some mushrooms, red pepper, less oil and butter.

Wow. Very simple and yummy. I love that I just had this stuff lying around and I found a great recipe to use it up. I only had fettucini, so I broke the noodles into 3 pieces before I cooked it and also, I happened to have some garlic butter that I used instead of regular butter. The light garlic flavor gave it extra zing.

This recipe was a hit. I added 8 cloves chopped garlic and 1 10oz pkg mushrooms. I sauteed the mushrooms and added them at the end. It was delicious. Light and easy to make.

I attempted to make this salad for 30 people and it was ready almost 2 hours before serving it...it was wonderful when warm, lost a little as it cooled. I think this dish needs to be served warm--add a little extra garlic and olive oil and it's wonderful.

Excellent! Simple yet very, very tasty. I added more olive oil so there was no need to add the pasta water. Next time, I'll add some garlic. But great as is.

One of our all-time favorite summer pasta dishes. This is delicious, and low fat. The basil is a must--it gives it a wonderful flavor.

In Italy the squash is typically fried but we prefer it sauted on high heat for 3or4min, no need to salt & drain . To enrich the dish as they do in Italy, mix 1/3 cup milk with an egg yolk and add to the cooked pasta, cook for a few minutes then add the zucchini & basil and cheese.

A wonderful if monochromatic dish. However, it does take longer than 45 minutes to prepare. You are supposed to soak the zucchini for 45 minutes after slicing it and then saute. Someone didn't do their math.

This recipe was so good and easy! We followed the recipe exactly and were impressed with the results - it really made a nice winter "comfort food" and will be added to our collection of easy favorites. The only thing I would do next time is experiment with the amount of olive oil and butter - probably lessen both ingredients a bit but careful to keep enough to keep the "comfort factor" stable.

This was wonderful and very flavorful. I added 12 ounces browned and well-drained Italian sausage in an effort to replicate a dish I had at a restaurant in Milan last year. It came very close! Add a salad of tossed greens and you have a great meal.

Wonderful,simple,midsummer meal.Was tempted to add garlic because that goes so well with both zucchini and basil, but resisted just to see how it would be without. The taste of all that basil really shines through beautifully.(You can always get garlic;fresh basil is a seasonal treasure.)I'll bet even those who don't care for zucchini would like this.

Not bad, a very easy summer pasta. I cut back on the olive oil and finished the pasta in the frying pan as instructed. Next time I think I'll try adding a bit more basil (we really like it) and maybe a spritz of lemon at the end. I will make it again.

It's hot this summer and the zucchini is prolific I was looking for something that would be quick and simple. This was a good choice. Simple?, yes. Bland?, no.

I made this for a big dinner and when I came back it was all gone. Everyone loved it, and the zucchini and pasta taste great together.

I tried this recipe because I had recently read a technique for zucchini with pasta that involved cutting the zucchini into matchsticks, tossing these in a little olive oil (1/2 tsp/zuke) and baking in a slowish (300-350) oven until cooked and slightly dry-toasted. While thses were in the oven, I followed suggestions for adding garlic and mushrooms, which I sauteed together, then used pan for tossing everything at the end. I needed very little olive oil and passed on the butter but did use a little extra Parmesan. Next time I'll use more zucchini (it shrinks baking: this time I used two small for two people) and maybe try the shrimp suggestions. My husband thought it was the highlight of the meal!

Super easy dish. Great taste. The first time I made this I turned the zucchinni too much and they kind of got mushy. The next time I only turned them once or twice and they stayed together better and made the dish very eye pleasing. Definitely reccomend this recipe not only as a side dish but as a main dish as well.

I agree with StarLysandra. This is a good starter recipe, but needs the extras.

I would never use that much olive oil in a recipe. I use a nonstick skillet. spraying oil from a regular spray bottle with 1 part olive oil to 2 parts water, shaken well before spraying. Added two TBSP white wine, a cup of deveined shrimp, a half cup of chopped mushrooms, and a clove of pressed garlic in the saute. Two ripe Roma tomatoes were added to flesh out the recipe. Fresh baked whole grain bread and a great green salad rounded out the meal. Yum!

The dish has seen various incarnations in our household. Only complaint is that there is too much basil in the original receipe. The zuccini can be cut in match sticks to avoid the salting and draining (they brown better) and the dish is greatly improved with the addition of a bit of sauted diced onion. You can garlic or not garlic at your own discretion.

Excellent and easy recipe! I serve it often as a side dish with grilled salmon. My family loves it!

Okay I had to add mushrooms since I had them lying around and I added the zucchini to the mushrooms which I had sauteed in the oil. This had a negative impact on the advised cooking process for the zuke in that in got kind of mushy from all the liquid. However, the 'shrooms really added a nice taste (in the future I would saute them separately and then combine with cooked zuke). I also added some garlic to this mixture and some slivered sun-dried tomatoes (packed in oil) which added an nice piquancy to the dish. Don't skimp on the fresh basil (unfortunately I picked all mine to make pesto just a week ago and had to buy it). Finally, I thought the dish was bland at first (hence the sun-dried tomatoes) but it seemed to improve with every bite as the flavor of the basil intensified. I only made it because my meat-eating husband was out of town, but it will become a regular. We've nicknamed it "Out of Town Pasta".

I was leary about making this recipe at first, especially since my husband sneared when I showed it to him. But I made it anyway and it was great! He loved it too. The zucchini really adds a nice flavor. Unfortunately, it doesn't keep well... so only make as much as you can eat.

This is an easy and tastey dish to make. I have added garlic,shrimp, and sometimes roasted red pepper slices. The family raved. This is a great dish for company.

I had to add garlic! Couldn't quite imagine basil and zucchini without it, and the dish was absolutely delicious. Everyone raved about it, and I'm reasonably sure I can probably thank it for an additional 3 pounds gained in the last few days. It tastes really good re-heated in the microwave with a little butter thrown on top & lots of parmesan.

Great way to use zucchini and basil from the garden. I substituted chicken broth for the pasta water.

With basil and zucchini straight from the garden this was a delicious dinner. However, the prep did take longer than 45 minutes. My husband and son agreed is was worth the wait. I added some fresh shrimp sauteed in garlic butter to pack a little more punch (my husband doesn't think he's eaten dinner if the meal does't include meat, fish or chicken)! Try this for a super meal!
