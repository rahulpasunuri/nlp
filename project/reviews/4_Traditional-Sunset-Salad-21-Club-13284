The dressing was my focus here- it was like a light French (not in calories, just in taste). It wasn't bad, I enjoyed it, but my husband found it "okay...". Will probably not make again. Did use bottled Heinz chili sauce (the one used for the ubiquitous party meatballs).

Okay. This is, by far, THE most delicious recipe for a salad dressing I've come across recently (didn't bother with the cabbage and beef tongue or whatever, just romaine and green leaf lettuce). I made this three nights in a row for a few different people and everyone raved about it. I will be making this again and again and again. One person caught a whiff of the smell before she had even tried it and was like, "Woah, that smells good! I've never smelled my salad before. It smells like a restaurant salad." And then she inhaled it.

I followed the advice from the first review and this salad is now a staple. I have even made this along side paninis for my son's first birthday party brunch. I use grape tomatos, avacados, romaine, cilantro, smokey chicken breast, bacon and feta. The tip for only 1 tbps of chili sauce should be heeded if you only want a subtle kick.

The dressing is the ticket here. As it was last minute, I substituted cilantro for the watercress and only used 1 tablespoon chili sauce and wisked in 1 tblsp. feta and put it together with freshly grilled chicken, avocado and thinly chopped romaine.

I did not make the full salad, just the dressing, which I added to a green salad with avocados and goat cheese. The dressing was so unique and delicious. My 14 guests loved it-a great twist on a standard vinegar/oil mix. The flavor goes great with avocados!
