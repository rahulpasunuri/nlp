I've always cooked a smoked shoulder, as my family calls it, on top of the stove, with water 2/3 of the way up, and slowly simmered it for several hours, or until the meat falls off the bone. Simple, easy, and moist and mouth watering. We'll have one for St. Patricks Day since corned beef is not that popular in the house...

@ A Cook from New York City: If your ham dried out, you did not use a shoulder as the recipe specified. I can ever imagine a smoked picnic drying out since it is covered with a thick layer of fat.

I enjoyed this immensely. I used an electric roaster and it was tender and juicy throughout, no drying. If you encounter drying in an oven, try sealing with tin foil between basting.

Ok - after I made this entire dish, I realized that what it was was a really nice ham stock that worked for a pea soup. The meal itself was just ok because the pork shoulder was such a funky piece of meat that it didn't carve or present well. We ate it (w/ sauteed green cabbage w/ caraway seeds and baked beans). Then I took the leftover sauce, added some chicken stock and dried peas, cut of any scraps of meat and had a great soup the next day.......

I made this just before Christmas to use in sandwiches, omlets, etc. during the holidays. It was great, although a lot of work when you include the sauce. We didn't care for the sauce but will definitely do the receipe again, sin sauce!

Nobody in my family, including me likes ham very much, but every New Years Day I try a new way of preparing ham to go with the cabbage and black eyed peas. This is the only way I fix ham now. Everyone loved it and there were no left overs except the bone which made a marvelous soup. I have prepared it twice and everyone loves it. It is alot of effort so it is a special occassion dish but well worth it.

The sauce for the ham in this recipe is quite good though not worth drying out the ham for. We found that the outer 1-2 inches of the ham dried out significantly because of the braising. The ham did have a nice flavor and the sauce covered up the dryness. I will go back to baking my hams and serving with a nice pineapple salsa/relish like your Pineapple Salsa with Mint.

I made this dish to go alongside my turkey yesterday for Christmas dinner. It was pretty fabulous and very easy to make. I am looking at the ham bone and am picturing it creating the most amazing split pea soup. a

I did not use smoked picnics. Got a good deal on 2 fresh picnics and followed the directions. I did boil them even though they were not smoked. Made the gravy for both, carved out both hams and froze bags of cooked slices and a couple containers of gravy seperately. The meat was very tender.I did add 1 T. of Worcestershire to the gravy and also thickened it a bit more with some flour and water. Served Italian cut green beans and baked potatoes. Was a hit.
