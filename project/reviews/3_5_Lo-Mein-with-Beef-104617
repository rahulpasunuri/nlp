Very yummy! All three of our young kids loved it. My hubby even said it would be worth putting on our entertaining list. I followed the recipe and didn't do any substitutions at all. It was great!

This was very disappointing. My son asked for Chinese food for his birthday, and we should've just had take-out. I followed the recipe with a few substitutions, which shouldn't have changed the taste (used chicken, bok choy, carrots, scallions, and broccoli), but we found it to be very bland. Most of the family ended up picking out the chicken and dipping it into store- bought sauce to add some flavor.

I subbed oyster mushrooms for the dried black mushrooms, green onions for chives, and didn't bother with the dark soy sauce - just used regular. I also skipped the beef, since I was using this as a side dish. I added a bit of garlic, and used spaghetti. I also added a tablespoon of oyster sauce at the end with the sesame oil. It came out really tasty! I felt good, since I have never tried to make stir fry or lo mein before. It seemed a little salty though, so I think I'll cut down on the salt next time.

Lots of times I make this I just use a combination of whole wheat and white linguini noodles. I don't eat meat, so I always make this with shrimp or with just veggies. I do find it needs a little more oyster sause.

This turned out great! I added garlic & 1/2 teas ginger. Substituted beef for seared salmon and it was just delish!!!! Will definitely make again as both hubby and baby loved it!!!!

Best lo mein recipe I've tried so far. I use it as a master recipe for many variations and it works wonderfully. Be sure to use the beef drippings as they contribute a lot to the final flavor.

So good! Made this for my boyfriend for V-day, and it was a hit! I didn't add the mushrooms, and used about 4 c. napa cabbage. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly, and it was perfect! Tasted just like the lo mein from my favorite chinese restaurant. I will definitely make this again!

We made this recipe just as written and had no luck with it. It came out mushy and bland. It did not resemble any of the lo mein that I have had in the past at restaurants. Will not make this recipe again.

With my modifications, this was better than restaurant Lo Mein. I only used 2 tbsn oil, plus sesame oil for the noodles, and added 6 scallions, chopped, instead of chives, 6 fresh shiitakes, and most importantly, about 4-5 cups thinly sliced Napa cabbage. This is a favorite!

Big hit with the whole family. Taste is close to authentic chinese. Substitued ingredients for ones I had on hand: used rotisserie chicken for beef, water chestnuts for bamboo shoots, scallion for chives and skipped black mushroom. Looking forward to trying it as written.

Excellent dish. So easy to make, but agree with others, could marinate meat longer, add a little extra soy sauce or oyster sauce at end to your liking. Tastes like at your favorite Chinese restaurant but you can control how greasy!

Rating: 3
This was very good, although I made a number of adjustments. I used shredded carrots, garlic, fresh mushrooms, green onions and broccoli. When I added the noodles, I thought that the sauce was bland, so I ended up adding more soy sauce, black pepper and oyster sauce to give it more flavor. I also would recommend marinating the beef for at least an hour or two before making.

Man oh man, this is GOOD! Wouldn't change a thing!

My husband couldn't wait to heat this up for a late night snack. I made this pretty much as the recipe. A winner.

This recipe is a great jumping-off point and amenable to all sorts of variations. Try popping whatever meat you´re using into the freezer for a few minutes before slicing, but not til frozen solid. You´ll be able to make paper-thin slices.

This is the 4th Lo Mein recipe I've been through, and it absolutely rocks. I didn't use all the vegetables I simply put 8oz of pork in the sauce mix w/ cornstarch for 20 minutes to soften it up, tossed in a little sugar and greatly reduced the oil. I used 1-1/2 tablespoons of oil to make half of this meal. I would wager 3 tablespoons for the full would be great. Seriously try this. If you have made lack-luster Chinese before, this will change your mind.

Wonderful dish! I use less oil, bok choy, green onions instead of chives, fresh shitakes and carrot julienned. I have made this at least 10 times and it's always great as is or with substitutions.

Very nice flavors-not to soy saucy which I don't like. I added a teaspoon of brown sugar and 1/2 tsp of red hot pepper flakes fo some heat.

This recipe makes great comfort Chinese food. So yummy! I think this is a very forgiving recipe too - I made a bunch of substitutions (e.g. used regular spaghetti for the noodles, omitted bean sprouts, added shredded carrots, used fresh mushrooms instead of dried) and it still tasted lovely. Also, I followed the suggestions of others and didn't use all the oil, and added some garlic to the mix.

Once I was the King of Spain, Now I eat Beef Lo Mein!

I made this for family and friends last night and EVERYONE said it was absolutely deelish! I've never been much for lo mein so I'm rating this on behalf of others. Since I've eaten at Shun Lee Palace many times I would definitely go out of my way to try any recipe coming from this restaurant. Super food!

i make this dish often, and it works great w/ all kinds of substitutions for meat and veggies. a great basic!

This is an excellent dish. I substituted crimini mushrooms for the black and to answer angie's question, garlic is a difinite YES. This is a keeper.

I make this one a lot. I add a red bell pepper and only use regular soy sauce because that is all I have but the oyster sauce is key to the flavor. Any mushrooms will do of course - shitakes are great in this. Yummy!

So good. Add some diced celery and thinly sliced red pepper.

I want to try this recipe, it sounds sooooo yummy! One question: no garlic???? did anyone out there add garlic? It just surprises me, I don't remember the last time I cooked anything without garlic. write back if you have any advice to give about this. I noticed already people loved it without changing a thing. thanks.

Good stuff. In our house, lo mein is comfort food. This is one of the best recipes I've found. I think the ingredients are harmonious and well balanced and I would not improvise too much. Or at least try it as written before changing to much. I would make an effort to use real Chinese cabbage - I can't imagine "normal" cabbage working nearly as well.

Rating: 3
A great starting place with lots of room to improvise with ingredients you may have on hand (words of wisdom for the first Chinese cooking insrtuctor I had nearly 25 years ago). A big hit with my seventeen year old lover of take out Beef Lo Mein. Ideas for typical on hand substitutes for some of the ingred. - fresh mushrooms for the dried black, carrots and celery for the bamboo shoots and sprouts, green onions for chives (in the middle of winter my chives are a bit frosty. Regular soy sauce is fine and you can definitely cut back on the veg oil. Musts are the sesame oil and oyster sauce.

great basic recipe in which I subsituted buillion over chicken broth and added pre-cooked pork tenders. Friends loved it. Real keeper.

Rating: 4
I've made this with several modifications - to save time since I can be a lazy cook - rather than the listed veges, I used a packaged brocolli slaw, which contained shredded cabbage, carrots and brocolli (the stems). I also used either a lean hamburger or ground turkey, rather than slicing up meat. I also dropped the vege oil, feeling that these burgers have enough fat in them! One last modification, is that I dropped the chinese noodles, and served these instead with soft tortilla shells (flour), and we just rolled them up to eat! yummy!

Labor intensive, but very good. I was unprepared while cooking - thought I could chop things up while other bits cooked. Bad idea. Do chop everything in advance, then stand there and add ingredients as needed. I'll know better next time, but it tasted better than any restaurant lo mein I've had, which surprised me!!

I used leftover barbecued pork in this recipe instead of beef and it came out as good as the lo mein we buy at our favorite chinese restaurant. This is the best lo mein recipe I have ever come across.

Rating: 4
Great taste, but like some of the others I didn't use all the oil and it came out wonderful. No leftovers, I'll have to make a double batch next itme.

This is an excellent recipe - something different - took me a while to find all the right ingredients but worth it! I only used the sesame oil and not the rest of the oils and it was fine .. it also makes enough generous servings for 6!!

I've made this recipe several times, and in spite of several variations (sirloin instead of the original cut of beef, celery & red pepper instead of the original vegetables), it has been great for my whole family--which is no small feat. My 10-year-old son claims to hate steak and most vegetables, yet he eats every bite (with chopsticks!) when I make this with my variations. A key here is oyster sauce--don't skip or substitute for it or you'll miss out on that rich taste. Also, you can decrease the amount of oil and get the right taste, but you risk ruining your wok. I used 1/3 cup of peanut oil and it cooked perfectly, but the end result was a bit greasier than I'd normally like.

I chopped. I measured. I lined up the ingredients. Instead of all of the cooking steps, I added 1/2 of the oil, the steak & then the vegies & sauce. Sauce was way to thin for me & very pale in color. Not a whole lot of flavor for me, either. Just not the recipe I was seeking. The receipe I had in mind had a much deeper taste as well as color.

Rating: 3
I loved this but I did stray from the recipe according to my tastes. I did not use the oyster sauce and I used only the dark soy sauce. I did not use all of the reserve oil. I think much less oil is necessary for it to still be very good.

Rating: 4
I made the recipie using all of the oil and then again substituting beef broth for all but 2tbs of the oil. When taste tested with friends, most people enjoyed both the regular and the lean version. I also steamed the vegetables prior to quick frying them in broth to get them cooked without oil. The regular version was tasty, but too fatty for me. Happy cooking

soak the mushrooms first,you can used any kind of chinese vegetables, don't have to be cabbage,don't need to used two kinds of soy sause,just the dark soy is fine.do all the cutting and the mushrooms early in the day,when is time to cook, just boil the water for the noodles and stir fried the meat and vegetables,is easy and fast and taste good.
