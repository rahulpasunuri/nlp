I've made this recipe several times in the past 9 years and even though it's quiet a bit of work it's worth the effort. One varitation that seems to please is making individual servings in cupcake trays or ramicans and add the fruit as needed. Unfortunately there is no good way to store the full sized torte once assembled without freezing the fruit.

My guests liked this better than I did. The blackberry sauce was OUTSTANDING, and the fresh fruit was beautiful and delicious. The crust was also outstanding, but must admit somewhat disappointed with the lime filling. I wanted more tart, and this had a bit much white chocolate for my taste. But my guests raved and I kept quiet!

A lot of work for basically a glorified ice cream cake. It makes a huge amount and it looks spectacular, but didn't get the accolades for taste that I was looking for after all that work. And I ended up throwing out most of the leftover portion, since it didn't really thrill my husband and kids.

This is probably one of the best deserts I have ever had....It was worth the work. Next time though I will simplify it by not putting the whip cream around the torte to freeze, I would just serve it with whip cream. Also the blackberry sauce was good but a lot of work, so I would skip it and just serve lots of fresh berries.The crust is to die for :)

This was a fun and beautiful dessert on a summer evening. I will definitely make it again. The lime had a nice tang. Good for ice cream cake lovers- like my 5 year old son.

Amazing desert - but, I really simplified the assembly. I only made the base torte, the 10 inch springform pan. I used the balance of the filling in individual custard dishes - which was a saviour as 2 guests were allergic to nuts! I seved the torte naked...then topped with whipped cream and fresh fruit at the table. The berry sauce was a pain to strain, but well worth it - delicious.

I made this for my son's Christening party. That was 4 years ago and people still remember the dessert. It is a labor of love but well worth the effort.

If you want to make a torte to remember make this one! My friends are still talking about it. The only down side, time, you need lots of it. When your making the crust don't blend too long or you'll end up with nut butter.
