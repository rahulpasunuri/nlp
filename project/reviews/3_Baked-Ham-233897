Easy and delicious. Suggest turning the oven full blast for the last 15 min. plus some extra. Basting juice cooks down to an awesome gravy.

This recipe is terrible. First, 45 minutes is much too short a time for an 8-10 lb. ham to get heated through. Second, 350-375 degrees is too hot an oven for the brown sugar on the ham. The results were a cold ham with burnt brown sugar and cherry glaze. I would not make this recipe again.

This ham was GREAT! I made it for my family and they loved it on Thanksgiving. Everyone wanted to know how I made it. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!
