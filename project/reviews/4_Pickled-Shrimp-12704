I've made this dish numerous times and it has always been a success. I do find that the shrimp are a bit tougher after marinating, but frankly, I've never had anyone complain; the taste more than makes up for the small difference in texture.

Thought these would be perfect for a cocktail party - make ahead, savory & a nice presentation etc. What a disappointment! Followed other reviewer's tips and used 2 lbs of cooked, peeled & deveined shrimp. Nibbled on a few before adding them to the marinade - they were tender. After marinating for 4 hours I decided to sneak a taste - much to my dismay the shrimp had become tough and chewy! I hoped they would be Ok since I needed them for the following afternoon but alas they ended up being oily, tasteless AND still tough! What a waste of 2 lbs. of perfect shrimp! This is the second time (2 different recipes) that I've marinated shrimp in an acidic base and both times I ended up with tough shrimp! Think I'll stick to sauteeing or grilling. Has anyone had this happen too? Any suggestions?

Made this for Thansgiving appetizer and if was a hit. Ran out very fast so would definately double or triple recipe next time. Children even like this! This is definately a keeper!

I've made this dish several times exactly as is and it's always a huge hit. I like to take it to a summer barbeque as either a predinner treat or a side dish.

Made this for New Years Day brunch and it was an enormous hit. Cheated a bit by using a 2-lb. bag of frozen shelled & deveined pre-cooked shrimp -- it was still one of the best shrimp dishes I ever ate. And easy too!

I served this dish as a side with Christmas dinner and received lots of compliments. My sister-in-law who doesn't usually like shrimp loved them. I will probably make this a new tradition and serve it every Christmas. Next time however, I think I will cut the oil by half as they were a bit oily.

Use a very mild olive oil with this. I always use more mustard seed and coriander than it calls for just for the punch. I have been making this since it first appeared in Gourmet years ago. An all time favorite for shrimp.

This recipe is very similar if not exactly the way my mother (now deceased) used to make pickled shrimp. My grandparents and she used to fight over the onions! The flavors are wonderful if left overnight to marinate. I serve it as hors d'oevres at all my parties and take it with me when I go to one that requires a dish. It is always a big hit.
