We liked this recipe. I had fresh napa cabbage from an organic farm. It was crisp and sweet. I added extra ginger and pepper. I thought the sherry, ginger, soy and pepper made a nice combination of flavors and did not over power the shrimp.

Blah. None of the flavors came out. I even added a little extra ginger and still, nothing. Not impressed. Sounded good and was easy, but a waste of good shrimp.

Would I make this dish again? Only if I had the ingredients on hand; I was trying to use up some Napa cabagge. Not anything special. Next time, I would lightly cook the cabbage (not steam it for 5 minutes) and reduce the amount of the soy sauce mixture a bit; it overpowered the rice. Again: not in my top 100.

I think some of the reviewers are missing the point of this recipe. Not all Chinese food is spicy hot. This dish is meant to be subtle, to allow the mild flavor of the shrimp to be noticeable. Ginger is delicate as well when cooked in this fashion. I do agree that garlic is a good addition. You also might want to try snow peas instead of the red bell pepper or in addition.

I agree with some of the other reviewers that this recipe needs to be kicked up a notch or two. With the addition of garlic, red pepper flakes, sesame oil and cilantro this dish became a keeper getting a 3 to 4 fork rating by the family. I added the garlic (at least 2 cloves) and the red pepper flakes (1/2 to 1 tsp.)when stir frying the ginger and scallions. Then added the sesame oil and cilantro with the scallion greens at the end. Also reduced the juices further after removing shrimp to serving bowls since it seemed rather thin. Thanks go to the others for their tips to improve this recipe.

Made recipe as is with the exception of adding 2 cloves of minced garlic. Totally yummy! To answer questions by cooks from Stockton and Vancouver - I would also make this recipe with chicken or pork, but scallops sound great, too. And Napa is also known as Chinese cabbage or celery cabbage. Hope that helps........

This is a great recipe. I did take the advice of another that had rated and did add the red pepper flakes, wonderful flavour combination with the ginger. My husband and I loved it, the clean up is a cinch...

Actually, mine is a question rather than a review. I don't care for shrimp and wondered whether others might think scallops would work instead? If not that, what do you suggest? Thank you.

Wonderful ingredients, but woefully bland. (Can bland be woeful?) As a main course rather than a side dish, this just doesn't have it. We love the basic ingredients, so we'll try something like this dish again. But like many other reviewers, we'll be looking to add something to kick up the flavour. We may try going Thai, with a little red curry paste, lime juice and cilantro. But would it then actually be the same recipe?

Delicious and easy - did this couple weeks ago and again to-night. You don't need to change a thing - but admit I did add a couple drops of sesame oil, and added cilantro (just 'cause I had it on hand). Since I've not heard of Napa cabbage, I presume it's called by a different name here, I used savoy which worked really well.

Terrific. Followed advice of others and cut down on cabbage and added asparagus and cremini mushrooms, as well as some garlic and chili paste. Also I like more liquid so I added 3/4 c. chicken broth and tsp of cornstarch to soy sauce mixture. Husband said it was a keeper.

A clarification to the cook from Santa Cruz: Unless it's pickled, Napa cabbage is generally NOT spicy in Chinese cooking. Vegetables are generally served "clear," without heavy sauces or spices, because the flavors of other dishes in a meal are usually stronger, and meant to take center stage. However, as this dish is only Asian-inspired and meant to be served as a meal in itself, by all means embellish to your heart's desire!

Even 3&1/2 forks! Delicious. We enjoyed this even more than I'd anticipated! Yes flavors were subtle but delicious; we left out the bell pepper but added a little crushed red pepper for just the right amount of heat. The whole recipe served just two of us though as a one-course dinner - and clean-up is fast too!

My husband and I enjoyed this dish but we would add more garlic and hot pepper flakes and mushrooms.

This dish was tasty-could have used ANY vegetable in place of the napa cabbage-while the cabbage is good, it seemed a bit much. I think next time I would use half napa cabbage and half asparagus or broccoli and I'd also add some cremini mushrooms! I also added some Chili with Garlic Paste, (can be found in the Asian section) of your grocery store. I'd make it again!

This was nice and simple, an easy midweek dish. Made it as is and thought it was pretty good, next time I might add some garlic and hot pepper.

Next time we plan to add a little garlic, and maybe a little extra ginger. Otherwise this was delicious. An excellent, simple dish, with subtle flavors.

This is another good looking dish that doesn't deliver on flavor. It's overwhelmed by shrimp and the sauce lacks complexity. So, it won't make it on the regular menu rotation at my house. As a regular subscriber to "Gourmet," I've noticed their Asian dishes generally lack "heat." While I'm not into spicy dishes, Asian dishes are often more interesting with a little red pepper here and there. Maybe that's all this dish needs. But I don't have time to experiment.
