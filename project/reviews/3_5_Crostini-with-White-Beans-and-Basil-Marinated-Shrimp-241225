I have made this 4 times and its been huge each time. The White beans by themselves are a great dip - in fact once I served it as a dip with the Shrimp to dip with and it was the 1st thing gone.

I followed this recipe to a "T", but it was just so-so and way too salty! Even after I cut them into bite size pieces, they just sat on the plate at our superbowl party and we ended up throwing them out. It was ALOT of work!

This was really, really good. Definitely a lot of work, but worth it. I (like some of the other reviewers) cut back on the oil a bit. Otherwise I made it per the recipe's instructions. For the chile sauce, I used a purchased Thai chile and garlic puree. Rave reviews from all!

This was very messy and hard for my guests to eat. Flavorful, but too intense for some. Despite these negatives, the bean puree is fantastic.

Can't wait to try this -- what type of white beans to use with this recipe?

This was excellent despite that I used, OH HORRORS, dried basil. Had everything else in my pantry. Really good and there are additions of oil that can be skimped on. Bet it's even better with fresh basil.

This is an amazing appetizer! I did not use nearly as much oil as the recipe recommended and I probably could have used even less, and I used vegetable broth instead of chicken. All in all, it's a great recipe that easy to make. I will definitely make it again soon!

standard amount of oil, beans will dry out considerably after they're cooked and pureed

This looks great, can't wait to try it, but am confounded by the amount of oil you add to the beans. Can that be right?? 1/4 cup plus 2 TB? Am I reading that correctly? Just seems like a lot, but I've never made a bean based spread so perhaps that's typical. Anyone else?
