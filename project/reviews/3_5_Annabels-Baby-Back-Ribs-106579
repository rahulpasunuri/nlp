My family loves these ribs. We live in an apartment where we can't grill and these ribs are as close as I have come with cooking them in the oven.

The sauce was not thick enough and too vinegary. I would not make this recipe again.

I, too, was of the "boil or cook on low heat for six months" school of ribs. These worked beautifully with Bone Suckin' brand BBQ sauce. I put them on the grill for the last 20 minutes. They were just a little dry, but that may be because my husband cooked them a few minutes too long. My friends all raved and wanted the recipe, though. I'll definitely make these again.

I made these ribs using bottled BBQ sauce (Jack Daniels) and the ribs turned out so moist and flavorful. I'd like to try this BBQ sauce recipe but I wanted to use up what i had on hand.

Like "Corvallis", we use Bulls Eye brand BBQ sauce (half regular, half hot). Great, easy recipe when we don't want to smoke ribs all day or the weather keeps us indoors. Always tender (maybe it's the ribs we buy), and simple enough for a weeknight. We've been making these for years now.

I use the oven technique described in this recipe, but use Bulls Eye brand BBQ sauce thinned with a little apple cider vinegar for the sauce. A bullet-proof way of making ribs. Easy and excellent.

Very good - not great though. I followed the sauce recipe as written but found like other reviewers it was too thin & had to be cooked forever to thicken - would use less water next time. Best thing about this recipe is it is very easy and cooking them in the oven is much less mess than grilling them

For oven baked ribs, these were great - moist and tender. The sauce recipe was exceptional - it's vinegary with a bite. Though I loved the sauce, I had to tone it down with additional honey since I was serving to kids. I agree with other cooks, cut down the water for the sauce or plan on simmering for over an hour.

I made these a few times and I usually use a good bottled sauce because it's so damn easy. I dry rub with cumin too and I do the first covering with hoisin sauce just to make it taste different sometimes. Good stuff.

I would give the sauce 4 forks, but the ribs only two....they just weren't all that tender. I like my ribs falling off the bone tender, and these were not. I think the secret is to bake longer at a lower temperature.

These are delicious and tender. Due to time constraints, I used Bullseye barbeque sauce. Also, I put them on a gas grill for the last 20 minutes or so, just to give them a little outdoor flavor. They were fantastic. Will definitely make these again.

This was delicious! The secret is in the sauce. It was very easy to make and so tasty! I can't wait to have a summer party and serve it to family and friends.

Well for some reason I always thought you had to boil ribs first. Was I ever wrong. These are terrific. I didn't have time the first time to make the Barbeque Sauce - just used regular store bought. Worked very well. Even better - the second time around I used the sauce recommended here. Easy and delicious.

I made the ribs for my girlfriend, who had no idea i cook. Truthfully neither did I. I follow the direction each step of the way and it came out perfect and she was shocked.

I made the sauce the day before and it was too vinegary, so I had to add more ingredients to make it more to my family's liking. The cooking process was so easy and the ribs tasted just like from the barbecue- My family loved them and is asking for more!

This is such a simple and delicious recipe. Of course you can use any bbq sauce and follow the directions to this one! My family LOVES them!

I'd like to have given this 2.5 forks. Needs a rub or something more than salt and pepper. Liked doing the ribs in the oven-quick easy and little prep.

I was just curious--this recipe shows up in a search for "meatless" main dishes. Hmmm . . .
