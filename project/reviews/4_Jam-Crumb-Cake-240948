This is a tasty, easy to make cake, however, I'd reduce the amounts of sugar next time as it's a bit too sweet for my taste, even with relatively tarte jams. I made it with half ginger-rhubarb jam and half lemon confiture. I didn't have eggs or milk, so i used 1 tbs of tahini paste instead of the egg, and coconut milk. They turned out to be worthy substitutes :)

Love this recipe because I will always have everything I need on hand. I forgot to add the salt to the cake & it was still good. I used yogurt in place of the milk & added some lemon zest & vanilla to cake batter. Next time I would probably make in 8" pan, so it would be a little thicker. Used cherry jam & I thought cake was pretty enough to serve to guests. Next time I would 1/2 the topping, i didn't use it all but have it in fridge to use for next cake.

Made this Exactly according to the recipe (except I assumed the butter would be the last added to the crumb topping mix...oops!) It was perfect...I'd add sliced or slivered almonds to the top next time for a little more oomph, but loved it just as it's written. Really liked the idea to use fresh fruit in season from Yiki...Definitely a keeper/repeat recipe!

I couldn't get the "crunchy" topping to be crunchy. Made two: Pomegranate and blackberry. Currently snacking on pomegranate, blackberry is baking :) Even though it's not as crunchy as I would like, it's really good!

OMG...My man and I loved this! I added white choclate and used blue berry jam.... more brown sugar in the topping....... yummy but not beautiful to serve :)

Given the reviews (and the amount of butter...), I expected to love this recipe. But I only thought it was ok. I liked the topping, although my crumbs were very moist and, in the future, I would only use 5 Tbsp. butter (not 6) in the crumb mixture. It was the cake part I wasn't wild about. It was very thin and flat -- strange, since there was so much baking soda in the recipe. And maybe I overswirled the jam becase in places it went all the way through to the bottom of the cake. I really thought the cake was just so-so.

Once again it passed the teeenager test, if my picky teen (boy) eats it, it must be good. I used fat free 1/2 & 1/2 instead of milk, and also changed the topping a bit,I used rolled oats instead of the flour,(used 3/4c oats + 1/4 chopped walnuts),and only used 4Tbls. of the butter, I found after I made the topping it was quite a lot, didn't use all of it. I also used an 8" baking dish,and cooked for the 25 mins. It came out great. Will bake again.

I feel like I should wear a cilice after eating a piece of this, it's so sinful! It isn't very attractive and it's fantastically simple, but it's so, so good. I used strawberry-rhubarb preserves and heated them a bit before using them to make them easier to work with. It's not attractive enough for a formal dinner but I would certainly serve it for after a brunch. And I will _definitely_ be making it again!

I used Lingonberry preserves instead of raspberry jam and the tartness was just right. Definitely a keeper, a little dry, but vanilla ice cream fixed that. Delicious.

This turned out great, I exchanged the brown sugar topping for ginger snap cookies and reduced the sugar. I think almonds would go great too.

Lovely delicate texture. Made in a nine inch pan per instructions and it baked in the precise time indicated. The topping (made without the extra two Tbsp flour) was just right as a top layer to the crumb cake. I used two flavors of Swiss preserves, dividing the cake roughly in half, using apricot and blueberry. Visually, the darker jam is more appealing. I think I'd prefer it with a tarter jam, such as the raspberry recommended by the recipe. I'm sure we will enjoy every bite and make it often!

I have never written a review before, though I use epicurious constantly, but I must, for this recipe: this is the best, easiest cake I have ever made. I have made it at least 7 times in the past six months, always to rave reviews and requests for the recipe. It is just as good with blackcurrent or strawberry jam. I prefer the amount of butter the recipe calls for, it makes the cake moist, and it keeps longer.

Rating: 4
This recipe is ridiculously good...and quite easy! I was sort of aghast at how much butter the recipe called for, so I used about 4 T butter, 2 T applesauce in the cake part (not the crumb) with little to no noticeable difference. It's quite rich...but good. My boyfriend says it's changed his coffee cake outlook for life; this is the best one ever!

This is so simple to make and tastes incredible. I used Polaner raspberry preserves. It was easy to double the recipe and make a couple at once, which I did. I made it for a work breakfast and it got reviews. I am about to make it for the second time!

I love love love this recipe. I have made it with several types of raspberry jam as well as cherry preserves. I am anxious to try apricot and marionberry as well, but I think strawberry would be too sweet. Every time I make this recipe I double it and give one away. It is a perfect host/hostess gift for holiday parties - the last thing on their minds is breakfast the next morning!

made this recipe twice, tastes great. there's just one problem w/ the results both times. my crumb crust was not uniform in terms of crumbiness. there were blobs of ooze fr the jam swirls that made it to the surface. can someone tell me what i did wrong?

As easy as every1 had said. I used yougart instead of milk and loved the tangy flavour.Used only 3/4 cup of flour in the crumb topping and it came out perfect. Will definately make again...maybe tomorrow.

This was very, very easy to make and good though not great. I would pick a preserve with a little more tanginess (perhaps apricot) next time. I would also reduce the amount of crumbs and the amount of flour in the crumbs as they came out kind of dry.

Mine is made with strawberry jam, I doubled the recipe and used 2 9" round pans. It was tasty, moist and maybe a little too sweet (and usually I like sweet). I may have used a little too much jam or the pans spread out everything too much. I took it out at 25 minutes, but it could have used another 5. Tomorrow is the test, a bunch of hungry profs sitting around an early morning meeting table!

Made this 3x with fresh peaches, 1x with fresh raspberries, 1x with jam as called for. All were delightful, especially with the fresh fruit in season. Also a plus that it is simple and quick. My Swiss neighbor asked for the recipe so I converted the quantities into grams. Will continue to make this in Fall and Winter with the locally made jams.

a big hit with the guests and a good recipe to keep around for the guests that just drop in. I did add a handful of slivered almonds to the crumb topping. Was great with the raspberry jam and added a nice nutty crunch to the cake. Perfect!

4 forks for ease, quickness and taste. Not necessarily the most complex of flavors, but a nice contrast in textures-- smooth and velvety cake with crispy, crumby, buttery topping. I also subbed yogurt for the milk so that the cake had a subtle tartness, and added a dash of vanilla. Served it with vanilla ice cream-- if I do that again I might cut back on the sugar next time, combined it was a bit too sweet but otherwise perfect. Received a lot of compliments and will definitely make again

I picked this recipe because I was looking for a quick and easy cake I could make with the ingredients I had on hand. It could not have been easier. I followed the recipe exactly, though I did forgo the extra 2 tablespoons of flour in the crumb topping, as others have suggested. I think this saved the topping from being too dry and crumbly. 25 minutes was the perfect amount of baking time, and I did this in a toaster oven! I will definitely make this again, and can't wait to try it with other jams - I used a generic strawberry, so I'm sure it will be extra good with quality preserves.

I let my 3 year old help me mix this-easy to do and we had fun. We bought raspberry preserves for this but could have used any flavor. It was moist and tasty for several days. An elegant brunch addition that costs very little and is almost no effort.

This was an easy and tasty breakfast cake. But, I believed the prior reviewers and assumed it would need 35 minutes. Not so, at least in a 9 inch pyrex dish, so it was a little dry. Next time I will make it in an 8 inch square. I will also experiment a bit with the "jam", perhaps using cooked prunes or figs instead.

A great coffee cake recipe! I used saskatoon-berry jam instead of raspberry, and buttermilk instead of milk. The cake could have used some vanilla or maybe lemon zest in the batter.

A wonderful recipe, my wife and guests thoroughly enjoyed it. I struggled with the cooking time though, 25 minutes is insufficient for my oven. The cake requires between 30 and 35 minutes. I reduced the temperature by 10 degrees for the last 10 minutes. I can't wait to try it again with different flavor preserves, black raspberry and blueberry are two that spring to mind.

Awesome and easy. I will make it again!

This is a fantastic cake! I found the topping amount to be perfect for an 8 inch square pan, but a little too much for a similar diameter round pan. The quality of the jam really affects the taste of the cake, so be sure not to pick anything too sugary. I've made this cake so often over the last 2 weeks that my boyfriend has accused me of sabotaging his diet :)

Really fine; the nuts helped significantly. I did need to bake the cake a little longer than the recipe indicated.

Could this be any easier?! For the amount of time and the ease of ingredients, this coffee cake is a winner. You can make as is, or can "doctor" to your heart's content. Great last minute throw- together coffee cake! By the way, omit the extra 2 Tbs of flour and the topping will be less dry and crumbly.

It's easy and so sweet. I used strawberry jam instead of raspberry jam.Even though I reduced amount of sugar on the cake, It was too sweet for me... I think the amount of topping crumb is too much. It fells off like snowflakes.Bake time is more required about 5 minutes... but, It's very beautiful and easy cake, I'll try it again with another jam I have.

i've made this three times with different jams and it's been a hit every time! fun to make and beautiful when presented. a lot of the crumb topping fell off when i removed it from the pan - the cake was still well covered. i used less of the topping when i made it the third time for this reason. a great addition to my baking repertoire!

Very easy, very tasty. I used blackberry preserves, but as the other reviewers noted, any type of jam will do. I thought the amount of crumb was perfect. A quick dessert or a nice breakfast coffeecake. What's not to like about a recipe with ingredients you already have on hand?

Ok, I've done this twice, and the crumbs are too wet to crumble, and the cake never finishes baking. it's a gooey mess even after 30 minutes. It tastes wonderful though. I have a gas oven but don't usually have to make adjustments other than rotating the pan halfway through. I hope someone can give me some suggestions.

Wonderful and super easy. I use whatever jam I have in the house and every kind I tried, no matter how strange, worked! The only change I'd make is half the crumb topping.

Rating: 2
Easy but not delicious (imho) - - more like perfectly fine. The cake part is pleasant and moist. The spicing in the crumb topping is a little flat/one- dimensional for my taste, and perhaps as a result, I found the cake/jam/crumb combination to be blandly sweet. As written, I wasnt inspired to go back for a second piece. Were there a second go- around, I would tweak the spicing in the crumb, perhaps add some toasted almonds, and a try a different jam (I used Polaner seedless raspberry).

I threw this together while my toddler was eating her breakfast and by the time it was ready to eat my husband and I had something lovely to have with coffee. Really easy, and I agree with everyone else - any jam will do. I've got a couple of half bottles hanging out in the fridge that will be getting this treatment in the next month. I like the idea of tossing in some lemon rind.

I will join the "easy and delicious" chorus. Instead of raspberry jam, I used some cranberry-kirsch jelly that was intended to be the topping for apple strudel, that I had way too much of. In fact, I found this recipe because I was looking to use up my cranberry-kirsch sauce. It worked beautifully. Any jam or jelly would probably work as well.
