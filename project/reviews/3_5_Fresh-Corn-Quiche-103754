Excellent! Just used a pinch of sugar after reading other reviews and it was plenty. Corn was so sweet, sugar could be completely eliminated. Only had heavy cream on hand, so used half cream and half whole milk. Made some in mini muffin pans for appetizers--baked them about 25 minutes. Turned out great!

I never had or made a quiche of any kind. Everyone started to complain when I started to make recipe, but continued anyway. The fear was the amount of egg in recipe everyone remembers! This recipe did not have many eggs that would cause me to stop making recipe. (Please did not have another side dish to replace it) Made it anyway 7/4/12- following recipe and add a 4 cheese mexican blend mix in deep dish casserole and it looked beautiful from oven.(the use of a deep! dish pan raised questions) Brother-in-law asked "Is it supposed to by so deep, he remembers it being thinner like a tart." Everyone's mouth dropped at the taste and said it was not a quiche it was too good to be the old fashion quiche their mother made. Sister- in-law claims it is more like a corn chowder in a delicious pie crust. I loved it and I hate eggs. I would make again the same and possible variations in the future. It was even better the second day (the little piece left). This great for breakfast-lunch-dinner.

Four forks for how unbelieveably simple and tasty this is. I did not have a deep dish pie crust, so I cut the liquid down to 1/3 cup of whole milk and 1/3 cup of cream. The only thing I would change is next time use less onion. I didn't mind but a few others thought it was too oniony. Added parmesan to the mix and on top. I can see a lot of potential for other additions here. It only took 20 minutes at a 375 oven in a normal sized pie crust for me.

Super easy and exceptionally tasty. Only took 15 minutes, at most, to get this in made and in the oven. I used 3 ears of fresh sweet corn, along with some fresh sage and thyme. Between the 3 of us, we ate the whole thing! Will definitely be a staple.

This has been a staple for years. Ridiculously easy to make. Substitutions are equally easy... half & half, milk, low-fat milk are all easily adaptable, as well as whatever ingredients are on hand.

If my kids could only pick one meal for the rest of their lives, they would pick this one. It is ridiculously simple to make (they couldn't care less about that, but lucky me!). I've made it with home-made crusts, store-bought crusts, potato crusts, nut crusts. I've put in parmesan, gruyere, cheddar, mystery cheese. I've been short on eggs and added one less, substituted the cream with low fat milk, forgotten to add the butter. It just doesn't matter. This is a dish you can't ruin (except, perhaps, by adding all the sugar called for--I usually skip it).

I made this as part of a Thanksgiving dinner and it got rave reviews. Also, VERY easy to make and can be used as a base recipe. For my first try, I omitted the sugar and added about 1/2 cup cheddar cheese per the suggestions of other reviewers.

I have made this quiche many times, and I think it is delicious. I always use fresh corn - the sweeter the corn, the better this comes out, and I make my own crust. Sometimes I throw in fresh tomatoes too.

I LOVE this quiche! I use Pillsbury refrigerated pie crust, Vidalia onion and fresh corn. People have been asking me to make this for almost 10 years now, and I usually make a 2nd quiche with cheese, veggies, and bacon. The corn quiche always disappears first! Sometimes simple is really, really good.

I took some of the suggestions that the other cooks made and sautéed the onions with thyme. I omitted the sugar and added nutmeg instead. I added some aged Parmesan cheese and decreased the liquid and used 2/3 c of table cream. It turned out great except that the crust was a little burnt. I would suggest a lower temperature or cooking for 40 min if you are cooking at a high altitude. I will definitely make this one again!

Okay Im one of those persnickety ones that cant take it when people completely change the recipe and then rate it anyway, but this was soooo good, so here I go. Im trying to use up the oddball items in my pantry and fridge instead of tossing them so I can take advantage of specials. Feeling like my sister- in-law right now who feels compelled to entertain when she does this (dont eat the corners theyre freezer-burned)!!! So I had a homemade piecrust, shredded caved aged gruyere, Trader Joes frozen corn, and 2 roasted poblano peppers in my freezer and as I was reading all of the reviews, I thought this is perfect. I took the advice and used one whole onion sautéed in 1 T of butter, added the 2 poblanos chopped, 2 tsp. Mexican oregano, 2 tsp. ground cumin. I put 1 shallot, 3 eggs, 1/3 cup heavy cream, 1/3 cup chicken stock, in the processor & pureed it with no flour & then mixed it with the corn and everything in the skillet & then added ¼ cup of grated cheese & dumped it into the 9 inch deep dish piecrust & topped it with another ¼ cup of grated cheese. Since my shell was pre- baked the cooking time was less than 40 minutes. I sprinkled it with chopped cilantro and served it. I couldnt believe how delicious it was. Thank you everyone for the great recommendations. This is a keeper!

What a waste of fresh corn!!! Way to sweet, felt like I was eating a dessert.

Cream half of corn with eggs.Improves corn flavor. Recipe shows too much half and half. Should only be 1/3 cup instead of 1 1/3 cup shown. Thyme and nutmeg are both excellent in recipe. Saute onions with thyme and then add them as is too egg mixture. Do not blend in processor as descibed.

I followed some previous reviewer's suggestions and added some diced ham, and some sharp cheddar, but unfortunately even that didn't lift it pat pretty bland. It wasn't a disaster, but it was just "eh", not a response that I usually get from epicurious recipes.

Really good, I plan to serve at my small restaurant while corn in season. Subbed 1/2 cup creamed corn for fresh as I had run out of fresh; worked out well as I decreased liquid a bit. Added freshly ground pepper to taste and a bit of nutmeg (always benefits quiches I find). Used my own crust which I had blind baked 20 minutes. Served on a grilled thick beefsteak tomato slice with a basil dressing dotted around.

Yummy. I added shredded cheddar because, really, what quiche doesn't benefit from cheese?

This quiche turned out wonderful. I altered the recipe slightly using whipping cream, and adding fresh pepper and fresh thyme. I dared to make the pie crust from scratch and it turned out perfect. We only had feta cheese on hand; I sprinkled some on the bottom of the pie crust before adding the filling. It was delicious.

I used whole milk instead of 1/2 and 1/2, sauteed onions with some ham and put that in the bottom of the pie shell. Also added some grated manchego cheese to the top. My toddler and husband enjoyed it equally!

We really enjoy this quiche. It is a great way to use fresh corn, though I have used the frozen sweet corn from Trader Joe's and it is still very good. I actually blend half of the corn in the food processor and find that gives the whole quiche a more corn flavor (did by accident once and liked it). And I just whisk the egg mixture, using half and half which works fine. I've also mixed in kielbasa and put cheddar on top, both of which are tasty.

Rating: 3
This was really good- everyone liked it and was impressed that I made it! I did add some grated medium cheddar on the bottom, a little ham and used frozen roasted corn. And I also sauteed the chopped onions a bit with the ham, and warmed the corn in the pan. I didn't use a processor, just beat the egg in a bowl and added whole milk, salt and sugar. Took a little longer than 50 minutes to completely set - maybe because I left out the flour?

Yeah -- this is a keeper -- I baked 4 different quiches for a brunch party and this was the best one... Will make it again regularly...

I really liked this dish. I grilled the corn cobs and added taylor ham and sharp cheddar per previous reviewers. I didn't have half & half...used whole milk instead, skipped the sugar and since I was using a homemade pie crust used only 2 eggs and 1 cup milk. Very easy, very good and the kids' liked it as well.

Rating: 3
Excellent. I made many of the changes noted by others...added 2 slices of bacon, some cheese (smoked gouda) and some red pepper. I also used a cornmeal crust which was fabulous on its own. To reduce some of the fat (especially after adding bacon) I used fat free half and half and couldn't tell a difference. I will definitely make this one again.

Rating: 3
I fiddled with this, as it turned out I had 2 regular crusts in the freezer (Oronoque Orchards, by the way, very good and they do make a deep dish). After reading reviews I added bacon and cheddar, used diced scallions instead of the onion and omitted the sugar. Made about 1 1/2 times the recipe (just whisked ingredients) and filled both crusts. Excellent!! A sprinkle of nutmeg on top enhanced the flavors nicely. Check at 40 minutes!

Excellent. My boyfriend who hates quiche loved it as well. I used the Buttermilk Biscuit recipe on this site as the base instead of pie crust. It was a great base. I also sauteed the onions, added lots of cheddar cheese, and used 2 cups of frozen white corn. It was great.

This dish was quite delicious and easy to make. I served it as part of a "trio" of quiches for a luncheon (ham & cheese and spinach were the other two.) My guests ate them all up! I added some cheddar cheese, per other reviewers suggestions.

Rating: 3
This was pretty good and super easy! I made it for a girls night in and served it with a spinach salad and pumpkin bread. I doubled the recipe but both my quiches overflowed, so next time I will leave about a 1/2 inch of crust so there's room for the quiche to expand. I recommend baking these on a rimmed baking sheet lined with foil for any spillage and use foil to cover the top b/c the crust and top will brown faster than the inside. Cheddar and red pepper were great additions.

I just prepared this quiche and brought it, untested and on blind faith,to a pot luck lunch, based on the reviews. I was not disappointed! It was delicious and disappeared quickly! The reviews were VERY helpful! I sauteed the onions as was suggested along with adding the cheddar cheese. Both really good enhancements. I live out of the country so finding half and half was not possible. Instead, I found a box of light cream and used 2/3 cup of it with 2/3 cup of whole milk. It worked perfectly. Thanks to all those who gave the great suggestions. Next time I may add a little jalapeno for a little extra zip.

This was really good and simple. I used Pillsbury ready-made crust and even my French friends love it and always ask me to bring it to parties!

Totally delicious. I used scallions instead of onions, and made my own crust, using the crust from the butternut squash and caramelized onion tart on Epicurious. I also decorated the top halfway through baking with spears of red bell pepper, like spokes, which makes it very attractive looking, instead of plain.

Tasty and easy...I didn't use the frozen deep dish crust, and using a conventional pie dish meant that I found I had too much filling. I also threw in a handful of cheddar. I thought it tasted great.

The only thing going for this "quiche" is that it is easy to prepare. I'll have to admit that for the first time ever I didn't make my own crust, which is a huge mistake, frankly. As per other suggestions, I also added some Parmesan and Monterey Jack cheeses. More of a flan than a quiche, frankly. There are far better recipes for quiche and I won't be making this again, unless it is for a kid's party.

Rating: 4
So easy, beautiful, and delicious! Adding two chopped jalapenos and a small roasted red bell pepper made it perfect. I also sprinkled 1/2 cup cheddar cheese on top. Thank you for the suggestion of using the cornmeal crust...the one that goes with the cranberry-tequila cream cheese tart listed elsewhere on this site was incredible. I'll definitely make this again!

Yummy! I did make a few adjustments as suggested from past reviewers. I added finely 1 cup small diced zucchini, 1/2 cup each good parm & finely diced jack cheeses. Because of the additional ingredients, I also added an additional egg and adjusted the flour and half and half accordingly. The result was fantastic. My husband who is a chef gave it two thumbs up for flavor and texture.

The quiche was very good and easy to make. I found it a little too sweet so I would pass on the sugar next time. I added 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar which enhanced the flavour. For the next quiche, I am going to try a variation of this using mushrooms and ham or bacon.

Wow, what an amazing recipe!!! It was the first quiche that has actually turned out right. I didn't have half and half so used regular full fat milk and used the 'basic pastry recipe' found on this site. Also, only had parmesean, so grated a bit of that into the egg mixture. Will definately try this again, maybe with some cheddar cheese or broccoli etc. Required very little effort.

This quiche was delicious, HOWEVER, I'm glad I read the other reviews before making it--it was great with cheddar cheese. When you use the cheese, you need to cut down on the other ingredients; use less corn and less half and half and milk. Next time I will saute the onions in the butter.

Yum! I loved this recipe and I'm taking some with me for lunch tomorrow. I sauteed the onions with some crushed garlic and a bit of garlic powder in the butter, then added some cheddar cheese along with the corn. I found that it took about 55 minutes to fully bake, rather than 50. I served pieces of this with steamed broccoli and some plain freshly made bread. Delicious!

Well, I only meant that I wouldn't use the same amounts of ingredients. With much less corn, some pepper and a little less 1/2 & 1/2 this would be a delicious meal. I put some havarti in the bottom and laid some red pepper on top but I'm thinking there was just too much liquid with all the vegetables.

I am a BBQ Caterer and was looking for a Cheesey Corn Bake recipe for my Kansas City Style BBQ. So I made this with about 1/2 cup of grated cheddar cheese in the filling. About 5 minutes before it was done, I sprinkeled another half cup on top. Wow, this was really delicious! I had friends over when I made this, and every bit was gone!

I made this recipe last night and LOVED it! I used fresh yellow corn, and added about 3/4 cup of cheddar cheese, and 1 finely chopped fresh jalapeno. I would even add another pepper next time...:) I also used a cornmeal crust from this site, which was fabulous, and whole milk in place of the half and half. A huge hit!

Rating: 3
Very tasty! I sauteed the onion first, which was delicious. Also, I used frozen (thawed) super sweet white corn, and sprinkled just a bit of cheddar/jack cheese over the top before baking. This is a good quiche, but I prefer the recipe (on epicurious) for the sausage and red bell pepper quiche, which I made with vegetarian sausage (meat-eaters couldn't tell the difference).

Rating: 4
So easy and delicious! I carelmelized the onion as one reviewer suggested, added a bit of swiss, and baked it as a large tart. It was part of a large easter dinner so I had to make it ahead and serve it at room temp (not enough oven space!)- still fantastic!

This was a huge hit and really good. I put a little bit of cheese grated on top of the quiche before baking, I think it was monterey jack, but swiss or cheddar would be good too. Also, I used frozed white (supersweet) corn for extra sweet flavor. I also carmelized the onions and that was good too.

YUMMMM!!! This was worth all of the work of cutting the corn off of the corn cobb (my first time, it took me awhile) I doubled the recipe and baked the crust a little before adding the filling. I didn't have enough half & half in the fridge to double this recipe so I used half and half, whipping cream & buttermilk mixed to reach the exact measurements. It turned out very rich and fluffy. I have found that with egg dishes you cant go wrong substituting whipping cream for milk. It definatly gives it a richer texture. I also added about a handful of shredded chedder cheese to the filling and on top.

This was very easy to make and incredibly delicious. I doubled the recipe (using frozen Hanover white corn), used a Vidalia onion and added Ham to one of the quiches for the meat eaters invited. Huge success.

Another Mother's Day hit. Too early for decent fresh corn, so I used a mix of Hanover white and yellow frozen (this is the best brand of frozen corn I've ever had--always very sweet). I also added a chopped red bell pepper for color and texture contrast and a good flavor counterpoint.

Mother's Day hit! I substitued a good pepper mix (Tony Cacher's) for some of the salt. Seemed strange to me that the dish calls for no pepper. I used fresh corn and prebaked the crust, both to great success

This is a very rich, very tasty desert. I don't own a food processor so I used a blender to chop the onions and combine the mixture; the blender worked fine. I also added a bit of shredded monterey jack/cheddar cheese to the top of the quiche before putting it in the oven. The only downside of this recipe -- which does not require you to bake the crust beforehand -- was that the crust was a little soggy on the bottom. Next time, I'll prebake the crust slightly. Otherwise, a very complex, tasty meal.
