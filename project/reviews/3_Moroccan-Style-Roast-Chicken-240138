This is a good recipe, if you let the chicken sit in the honey/spice mixture over night. I also added about an eighth of a teaspoon of cumin and sliced almonds to round out the flavor. Let that sit in the fridge over night. Next time, I would also bake at 300 degrees for a much longer time. I think a slow roast would make this dish perfect.

a little pedestrian for my taste - I'd like a little lighter on the honey & cinnamon, add some tummeric, allspice, cardomom seeds....

I like almost everything I make from Gourmet and Bon Appetit but this one is the most boring dish I've made in a long time. This even after reading the reviews and advice. Pick something else.

Very good. Make it with the couscous and make carrots with butter, orange juice and cinnamon-sugar and it makes a great dinner.

I've made this recipe many times, but just for two people, by using only breasts on the bone and scaling down amounts. Easy and Super!

I used the recipe as a jump start for my own version- I squeezed some orange juice into the honey mixure, stuffed the chicken cavity with the used orange wedges, substituted cumin for turmeric and slow-roasted my chicken for about 3 hours at 300 degrees. It was the most succulent chicken I think I've ever made, and the smells that filled the kitchen were divine.

I found this recipe to be very easy and very tasty. It was easy to prepare but found it difficult to brush the honey butter on to the raw chicken. However, I did discover once the chicken was slightly warm in the over, the honey butter melted right on. I would recommend holding off on applying this until the chicken is slightly warm/hot in the oven to make it easier to evenly distribute throughout the chicken. Overall a delicious meal - went very well w/ cous-cous. Next time I'll make even more of the honey butter to make it extra saucy.

This was my first time making a Moroccan styled food and I have to say that my husband and I LOVED it! I did brine my chicken, like others had suggested and I don't think I have ever had a more tender, juicy chicken! I paired it with a Moroccan carrot salad and some coucous and it was one amazing meal!!

we put it into our sun-oven in a roasting pan and it turned out great, not too dark and super tender (as always with chicken in the sun-oven). As an additional bonus we didn't use any energy other than the sun...

I have used this easy recipe time and time again at parties or family gatherings. Everyone always exclaims about how wonderful the chicken is, and the leftovers are incredible. I usually cook 2 chickens (more servings) and always brine the chicken the night before (1 C salt to 1 C sugar to 10 C water) and ALWAYS cover the chicken in tinfoil because the honey gets dark fast. This is one of our favorites : )

I just made this chicken for the second time. It is so easy to make and incredcly juicy and delicious, I decided to buy a bigger chicken the second time around. My kids loved it and especially my 2 year old gobbled it up like I have never seen before. I also replaced the turmeric with cumin. I will make this again and again.

Forgot to purchase turmeric at the store, so I substituted cumin - the result was WONDERFUL anyway! I did have to cover it with foil pretty early on to avoid burning.

Excellent! I made 2 large Rocky roasters and the couscous and it was delicious.

Had for a dinner party along with the couscous recipe - everyone loved it. I used the large Rocky roasters and good quality wine and butter in the couscous so maybe that's why mine was so good. I might either line the pan with foil or fill with an inch of water next time for easier cleanup but otherwise couldn't improve on this!

an okay roast chicken recipe - the sauce was tasty, but the chicken was just average overall. Definitely watch the skin -- it will burn if you don't cover it with foil during the roasting.

It roasted very nicely in a large cast iron pot with sweet potatoes, carrots, and pearl onions. Sweet potato was a bit much, but I would make it again with rice & raisins or plain rice. I am going to try it with less butter and a bit more turmeric and honey next time. Maybe some slivered almonds to finish it and make some room in the flavour profile (very sweet.)

A disaster. The honey glaze burned, and I cooked it at 375. I obviously didn't read close enough and missed the part that said cover with foil if it browns too, fast, but there's not much of an if about that. That instruction should have been right up at the top.

I combined the brining with the brined chicken and this recipe and the result was fantastic! Just add 1 c. sugar and 1 c. kosher salt to 10 c.water in a large soup pot. Put chicken in water for about 6-8 hrs. in fridge, then dry. Next follow Moroccan recipe. The chicken is moist and perfectly spiced. Just delish. We weren't crazy about the cinnamon flavored couscous.

I combined the brined chicken recipe with this one and it was fantastic. Just put the chicken in about 10c. water with 1c. kosher salt and 1c. sugar for about 8 hrs. Dry out chicken, then follow Moroccon chicken recipe. Moist and delicious.

An excellent recipe. I'm not a huge fan of poultry, but this came out so tender and tasty. Husband loved it as well. Served it with potatoes and greens. Great.

Very good, very delicious, the flavors are blends very nicely! Served it with "my" version of moroccan style couscous and the couscous did not work. Chicken was delicous..

This was a very easy fast recipe, but not as good as the brined chicken a few issues back. It wnt well with the spiced couscous recipe.

a lot of work for not much special flavor. i was disappointed that the meat did not get more of a flavor from the spices. better recipe was the one from "Repast" rest. a few issues ago, where you brine it.. the breast is much moister this way; this one does brown too quickly. cooked one hour

I was looking for an easy meal to prepare for friends after a busy work week. I "cheated" with deli roasted chickens. We cut them into pieces, used the glaze from the recipe and finished them on our charcoal grill. Delicious! Smoky and sweet. Nobody had a clue we hadn't roasted the chickens ourselves.

I found this recipe fast and easy to make and cook. However, I did have to double the sauce for the chicken and to cover the chicken with foil about a fourth of the way through cooking. My family gave it 2 thumbs up and thought the chicken tender and flavorful. I would definately make this again. Fast, Easy, and Delicious.
