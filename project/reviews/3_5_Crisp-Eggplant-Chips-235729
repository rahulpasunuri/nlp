There are delisious and I've made them several times. They don't last long, as everyone, even my non-veggie eaters like them.

I am a sucker for savory nibbles but this one doesn't cut it. Had some fresh Japanese eggplant in my garden this morning. Followed the recipe exactly. The cornstarch left an unappealing residue on the tongue. Possibly replacing the cornstarch with rice flour would work. A waste of a good vegetable as a vehicle for salt, sugar and fat.

I served these as part of the hors d'oeuvres at Thanksgiving, using thinly sliced sweet potatoes instead of the eggplant. They were fabulous--and addictive!

Very nice addition to hors d'oeuvres! We served it with a savory menu (cheeses, meatballs, charcuteries, crudities) and I feel it added a special something to the spread. Very popular with the guests.

I've made these chips several times now and they're amazing (and addictive)! I use regular breadcrumbs instead of Japanese breadcrumbs and they turn out fine.
