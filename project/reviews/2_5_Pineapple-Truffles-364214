I would like to give it no forks (stars). That is how bad it is! It took forever to make which I don't mind but not with a result like this!!! I had 3 other people taste it (just in case it was just me) and no one liked it! What a waste of time and money! THIS IS NOT KOSHER FOR PASSOVER! The Powdered sugar makes this recepie NOT kosher for Passover!

I don't usually mind when a recipe takes a lot of time as long as I get something amazing in return. After the slicing, reducing, splattering, blending, freezing, rolling, re- freezing (the list continues) I expected a little ball of pure joy. Not so. It tasted like frozen pineapple-nothing special or amazing. You're better of doing something else with your time.

I cut the recipe in half, but now I wish I didn't because they're so good! And I don't usually like fruity sweets. I agree with the other posters, it took closer to an hour to reduce the pineapple mixture - but I had the burner on low to keep it from burning and also wanted to make sure it was really dry so the truffles wouldn't be soft and mushy. Next time I might try this with mangos!

An addendum to the review below, and response to the first reviewer -- I made these with kosher-for-Passover confectioners sugar, which uses tapioca starch instead of cornstarch. Worked great!

DO NOT try to cut this recipe in half! There I was, thinking "I don't need 60 truffles, I'll just make a half recipe." Unless you have a tiny saucepan to cook them in, this will definitely result in burning the pineapple mix while trying to reduce. something about the heat distribution. Anyway, I tried again making the whole recipe, and they're delicious. One change to definitely make is to also process the coconut and granulated sugar going into the pineapple mix, not just the coating. Otherwise the candy itself ends up with a weirdly stringy texture. Also, we thought they were best straight out of the freezer, like a blended pina colada. A little mushy if they sit out too long, though this maybe would be fixed by cooking them longer.

simply...these are too hard to make and they taste gross! I followed the recipe perfectly...YUCK!

A taste of piña colada in a compact treat! My family really enjoyed this, but the reducing of the pinapple took more like an hour than 30-35 minutes, which was frustrating because it was getting late. Beware the heat from the hot candy before shaped. It helps if you stir the mixture every once in a while so that the steam from the center is released. Also, it only made about 30 medium truffles, rather than the 50-60 advertised. Overall, a good recipe.

These are delicious, but a lot of work. An alternative is to take coconut milk and frozen pineapple chunks (or berries or whatever) and blend them with honey to make a vegan ice cream type of dish. Easier too.

You can make your own powdered sugar by blending regular sugar in a food processor until it's powdery. It does work, as I have done it and used it before in recipes.

Confectioners sugar has cornstarch in it and is not accepatable for Passover. Susie's menu is full of no nos for Passover
