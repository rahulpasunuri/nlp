Easy and delicious! Just the right amount of heat and spice.

wonderful recipe.... i cook professionally now, and i came across it when i was 18 or so and turned it into a soup with thinly sliced sweet jalapenos instead of scotch bonnets and a homemade fish stock. today i am about to try the flavor combo with a chicken terrine with small shrimp and sliced peppers inside. cant wait to see how it turns out!

I've made this many times to rave reviews. You can even moderate the heat by putting in fewer peppers. Still delicious.

A very easy and incredibly tasty dish. The spice is not overwhelming, but flavorful. Will keep this recipe and make it again.

I am making this for the fourth time tonight. It is always a huge hit no matter where I take it. It's not super spicy, so it's great for everyone. Just enough of a punch at the end, without the lingering feel of heat. I think I'll even try the beer broth tonight.

I have made this recipe many times and get raves every time. I actually use 3 chiles instead of 4 to take a little bit of the bite off.

As a coastal NC cook, I am used to cooking shrimp in beer, so I added the pepper/spice mix to two bottles of decent brew. I also followed another reviewer's advice about the cooking time--I brought my liquid to a simmer, dropped the shrimp, removed from heat and covered immediately, and steamed in the liquid for ten minutes. They turned out perfectly cooked. I saved the broth for a spicy seafood soup the next day (also fabulous). I will make this over and over!

Exccellent flavor. A little spicy for some of my guests, but most loved it. Watch your eyes over the habanero steam!

I agree . . . boring! These were basically boiled shrimp with a little bit of a kick.

All I can say is "boring". I love spicy foods. I followed the directions exactly. There was no added flavor. I used large shrimp and only let sit in water 15 minutes, yet they still over cooked. I thought that leaving them in that long was a mistake. I was right. My only reason for rating this as I did was that my guests ate every one. They must have been starving.

This one is fantastic! I make it almost every week and everyone loves it.

I made this for a houseparty and they were a hit. we couldn't stop eating them, I didn't find them salty at all, but I do reccommend straining the broth before adding the shrimp..will for sure make again.

Tried this the first time with dried haberneros, and it wasn't spicy at all. Then used fresh scotch bonnets, and it was nice and spicy; just make sure to heed the advice of the reviewer who said not to breathe the steam! Keep the lid on that pot - we were sneezing and coughing until we did. Both times, used a scant single tablespoon of sea salt, and it was too salty, both with peeled and unpeeled shrimp - and we love salty, so salt with discretion.

SO good. I couldn't wait to share this recipe w/ my chef mother. I did use sea salt as some of the other reviewers suggested. This dish was so far above & beyond the average peel and eat shrimp. I served it as an appetizer before the jerk chicken & the delicious vegetable run down also in this issue of Bon Appetit.

I just made a huge batch of these shrimp for a party and they were a smash hit. Some suggestions: Strain the solids out of the broth before cooking the shrimp in it. Take pity on your guests and peel the shrimp before serving. My guests were looking around for some cocktail sauce for dipping until I explained it was unnecessary. Next time I'll put a little label, "Hot 'n Spicy Shrimp", on the serving platter. I'll be making this one over and over again.

I made this with only 2 large habaneros and 2 TEAspoons of salt. The taste was outstanding for everyone. For those who like spicy, go with the 4 habaneros. Just don't breath in the steam while cooking.

These were quite nice but far too salty for my taste. I will make them again but try less salt (maybe 2 tsp.-1 Tbsp.). I used Jalapeno peppers (4) which only gave a mild heat. I will try something a little hotter next time. The company I was making these for are not into "hot/spicy" foods. I doubled the shrimp and had more than enough, so I froze some in the broth without any problems. These were fun to serve as a hot summer evening snack on the deck, with several different cheeses, olives, veggies and breadsticks. And vino, did I mention copious amounts of vino!!!???? Thanks for the recipe!

Well folks, I gotta say this about the salt...being in a hurry I omitted the salt altogether, accidentally, and still found this to be great. Great for appetizer. There are other hot pepper shrimp recipes around that I am sure are excellent but are drowning in butter/oil...this recipe is so much healthier. Is reminiscent of doing shrimp in Old Bay seasoning, but a bit more of a punch I think.

Followed recipe to the T. Excellent!

Loved, loved, loved these shrimp! Pleasing spicy flavor yet it still tastes like shrimp. I chose to peel the shrimp before cooking just for the convenience of my guests. I also strained the flavorful broth before cooking the shrimp in it so the seasonings wouldn't be stuck all over the shrimp. Adjust the level of "heat" desired by varying the type of peppers used.

These are awesome! As prior reviewer indicated, not too salty at all with a good quality sea salt. I couldn't find habaneros so I used serranos - they were plenty spicey. These were a huge hit and will become a staple in my house!

Loved it!! Easy to make and delicious. Make sure people know it is spicy!

I liked this recipe well enough but my husband didn't care for it too much and doesn't want me to make it again. For the record, I omitted the peppers (we don't like hot food) and used a tiny bit of crushed red peppers instead. Used sea salt and found it not too salty. Also, we found the shrimp a little hard to peel -- maybe it was the type of shrimp we used.

Easy and delicious. We served it over rice and ate every bite. I will definitely make this again, soon!

Loved this recipe! Don't use table salt, make sure to use sea salt or kosher salt. I served the shrimp with the liquid drained but with the thyme, onions and other spices for a bit of color in the bowl. (I just told the guests not to eat the spices) Note: guests should be careful after eating these if they need to service their contacts! It may burn due to the chile oil on their fingers!

This recipe took me straight back to Jamaica. Anyone who has ever travelled by road from Kingston to the South Coast should recognize the flavors. An absolute hit! I used sea salt and it tasted delicious!

This shrimp was great! Use all the salt called for in the recipe - kosher or sea salt. And the recipe doesn't say to COOK the shrimp for 20 minutes, but to let it STAND for 20 minutes. This allows the shrimp to absorb the delicious flavors.

This was a hit! I was concerned it would be too difficult to eat as an appetizer, but I was wrong. Everyone loved it! I followed the recipe exactly. The previous reviewer said that they would cut down on the salt; if you use a good sea salt or kosher salt, it should be fine!

The flavor is great...however, it calls for way too much salt, I think when I make it again I will try 1 tsp. rather than 2 Tbsp. Also, I cooked it for about 3-4 minutes rather than 20 minutes. Other than that, this is a great recipe.
