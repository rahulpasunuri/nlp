Made this tonight and came out great! Ver moist and tender. I didnt have fresh rosemary so i used dried instead.

Fabulous. Big hit; made the house smell great. The only thing I did differently from the recipe as written was to break the bay leaves up into small pieces, rather than crumble them. Most fell into the pan as the pork roasted. I will DEFINITELY make this again; it will be my default pork roast recipe.

Very nice. I almost always stuff pieces of pork, and I stuffed this with some mushrooms, onion and breadcrumbs. The pork was a little shy of 2lbs and I HALVED the quantities for the glaze. I think it was a good call and made for a nice subtle flavour that went well with the stuffing.

The flavors in this are incredible - the meat was juicy, tender and delicious-the marinade has wonderful flavors - one of the best meals we have had in a long time. You must use real Dijon with the seeds-that makes the flavor in the crust so intense, and adds a little crunch. Being from Vermont, I added 2 tsp. Maple syurp to the marinade- perfection! Highly recommend-we will serve it to guests next.

Tasty and easy. I didnt have grainy mustard, so used dijon and added a tablespoon of black mustard seeds which I had "fried" in a little oil until they popped. I didnt add extra oil.

Excellent rub -- I put it on about 2 hours before and just let it sit in the fridge until I was ready to roast it. The balsamic vinegar gives it an especially mouthwatering aroma. Delicious, moist, and visually pleasing roast!

Easy, Very yummy would have given it 3.5 forks if I could. I didn't have any rosemary and didn't crumble the bay leaves but the end result was still great. Will definitely make again and again. It's a keeper.

Very good, but really, the crumbled Bay leaves were a big mistake. They never soften aren't meant to be eaten. Very distracting.

Yes! Yes! Yes! keep the bay leaves whole to make it easier to remove, keep the pan moist. I used a sirloin pork roast, cut the twine it came with, massaged in the rub, and then re-tied with only 3 pieces of twine.Ohmygoodness GOOD! Hubby is licking the plate as I type.

Made this yesterday, for a family dinner, with some changes to the recipe. I used a bone-in (Frenched) rib roast instead of boneless. I cut back on the marinade ingredients to 1/3 what is called for and let the roast marinade for 5 hours. I then roasted the pork in our barbecue for approximately 2 hours. The result was a very moist and tender cut of meat. Probably the best we've ever had !!! I also made a sauce with the drippings where I added only wine and some water. The result was amazing. This will definately be a keeper and will be made frequently

I was eager to try this because of the good reviews and ease of preparation, but it wasn't anything special. The rub really put off a ferocious smell while baking, and then the flavor of the meat was very subdued.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. I thought maybe the mustard would be alittle overpowering, but it was not. I might add some breadcrumbs next time for more of a crust. I will make this again.

This pork roast was moist and flavorful. I personally am not a mustard lover, but the flavor was not over powering. I did use dried rosemary and it turned out fine. Will be added to our holiday menus.

Rating: 3
I would make this again as rosemary and mustard work well with pork. A big return for not much work. I would add sugar perhaps to cut the bite of the mustard/coating just a hair but it's not "offensive" as is. I also poked a fork many times into the meat to let the flavor into the roast which worked very well - rosemary to the core.

Rating: 3
This was really, really tasty, not to mention the rich aromas that filled the house. The cooking time was about 20 minutes longer than the recipe said (the smells were making me really impatient to eat it!), but otherwise it was great. I had never cooked this cut of meat before and was really pleased with it. I think that next time I'll first sear it in hot oil (like with a pork tenderloin) to give it a little bit more of that browned crust.

Used a 3 lb roast, added a little more of all ingredients, esp extra garlic. Cooked in in a shallow metal pan with rack and it was absolutley perfect, easy to cut, juicy, and very flavorful. 10 people ate every single bite, it's gone! Will serve again next week with different sides. Perfect for a fall/winter dish.

Made a 3lb roast, used a little more of everything, esp garlic, set it on a rackin a shallow pan, and it was absolutley perfect, tender with the melding of rosemary and bay and mustard, a nice stong flavor-we fed 10 with nothing left! Perfect for a fall/winter dish and I will serve it again to guests next week! Easy.

Rating: 4
I've made this a number of times and everyone loves it. One technique I have learned that helps retain more juices is to sear the meat on all sides in a hot pan before spreading the mustard rub. It also reduces the oven time by 2 to 3 minutes and helps form a crust on the pork.

Rating: 4
This has become my standard "Company is coming" meal. Fresh rosemary is worth the extra cost, and don't skimp on the bay leafs! The coating really helps keep the moisture in the roast, make sure to really let it rest. Everyone who tastes it demands the recipie. :) Enjoy!

Very nice flavor. Being someone who never uses mustard as a condiment I was supprised at how much I really liked this as I was looking for a different take on using rosemary and garlic with my roast. Will make again.

I just made this tonight for Easter dinner. My mother is a gourmet cook and was blown away by the flavor. I used a very strong balsamic and fresh rosemary. I served it with the goat-cheese scalloped potatos, perfect! And my home smelled fantastic while it was cooking, too!

Rating: 4
Very good. The amount of mustard was perfect, not overwhelming at all. I used dried rosemary also but would use fresh next time for a stronger flavor. I roasted small white potatoes along along with the roast, basting the potatoes every 15 mins with juice from the roast and added whole mushrooms in the last 15 mins, broiling the potatoes and mushrooms for ~8 mins while the roast rested out of the oven. Everyone liked it and it went quickly.

We substituted regular hot dog mustard for the coarse-grained Dijon mustard and parsley for the bay leaves. It was outstanding.

My family (even our 16 month old) loved this recipe! Very easy. We didn't have whole grain Dijon or fresh rosemary on hand so we used regular Dijon and dried rosemary (about one and a half teaspoons and crushed it a bit) and it still tasted great. As did a previous reviewer, we cooked it a little on the medium rare side, not to 140 degrees, and it was very moist. We also trimmed a lot of fat before we coated it with the mustard mixture.

My husband and I have made this several times. Our dinner guest have given many compliments. Many have asked for a recipe copy. This was an easy recipe to follow.

Great recipe, and dead easy. I love mustard, so I made sure that I made a bit more of the coating (I had a 2.5 lb roast). I roasted the pork with the fat side up, and cooked it for about 1:15 -- until the internal temp was just shy of 140. It was perfect, moist and lovely, with the barest hint of pink. (150 would have been a bit overdone to my taste.) Another keeper recipe.

BAKED IN AN OPEN PAN; ADDED A BIT OF WHITE WINE TOWARD THE END. MADE A NICE GRAVY FOR POTATOES OR JUST BREAD. VERY TASTY. SPOONED SOME OLIVE TAPENADE ON THE SIDE. I USED A PORK TENDERLOIN. A KEEPER. OH YES, ONLY USED 2 GARLIC CLOVES. MADE THIS AGAIN LAST NIGHT WITH A TURKEY BREAST. IT WAS GREAT!

Lovely recipe..either for grill or oven. Make sure you have taken the roast from fridge for an hour or so or the timing will be off. I actually was able to obtain a roast with some fat left on ( miracle nowadays!) so had lovely drippings but as they were browning quickly, I too added some liquid..but I used chicken stock in place of water . As the roast was sitting, I further deglazed the pan with white wine till syrupy and had a wonderful sauce to spoon over the meat.

I used a frozen boneless pork roast and this was absolutely wonderful. I did baste it quite often and did add more liquid to the pan as time went on.

This is a great "coating", but I will make a couple of changes next time. I would take the suggestion of MOT crushing the bay leaves - -leave them whole and remove intact. I applied this coating to a 7.5 pound pork shoulder roast with just a 1.5 hours before it was cooked - - and it was an excellent addition! Next time I will also add the coating before cooking. P.S. The Oregon Pinot Noir was the perfect wine!

I made my roast on a gas grill and it was just wonderful!! I had a 8 pd roast and had just 2 slices left as leftovers. I did choose to rub the mustard mixture over the roast about 2 hours prior to grilling. Then grilled over medium heat for about 2 hours. I added a few tablespoons of water throughout the duration of the grilling so that the juices did not burn on the pan. Then deglazed the pan with 1/4 cup of red wine and added pan drippings which made a wonderful sauce to spoon over the pork. I also made the recommended potato gratin with cream and fresh herbs which was also very delicious. For out of town guests, this was wonderful dinner that really was very easy to prepare. I'm planning on making it again very soon.

Absolutely nothing special relying on a strong mustard taste to add if any flavor.

I did not have the kind of results others speak of - I used a larger roast than what it called for and maybe because I had to cook it longer, it turned out dry and rather dull; coating ended up being almost charred - I think it is just too much mustard.

DELICIOUS! This recipe was simple and very, very tasty. What a great way to prepare a nice cut of meat. The flavor was sharp, the meat was so tender, and all I had to do was put it in the oven and forget it til the bell rang! I served with baked potatoes and steamed green beans.

The flavour of the herbs and mustard is really wonderful. I patted the mixture on about an hour before I put it in the oven, and just let it set. Adding water while roasting worked well although you really have to watch it so it doesn't burn. A definite keeper!

Delicious - it even impressed my mother-in-law! The drippings below the rack dried out. Might be a good idea to add some water half-way through the process. BTW, this was the first time I ever used a meat thermometer - wow - did that ever make a wonderful difference! No more dried out or undercooked meat for me!

I used a 4-rib roast and placed it on a bed of thickly sliced white mushrooms & red onions, roasting time about 1 & 3/4 hrs. While the roast rested, I deglazed the pan with chicken stock and balsamic and reduced 'til it was syrupy. Served the roast with leek risotto and an Oregon Pinot Noir. My husband and I felt this meal was on par with some of the best food we've had in the nicest restaurants.

I don't know what happened but this was the worst! My husband took 2 bites and fed the rest to our cat. I followed the recipe closely BUT I marinated the pork in the mixture for 3 hours. Perhaps that was my mistake??? I usually agree with the other reviewers but not this time!!

I made this dish last night and have made it several times. I added water to it as it cooked and stirred in additional water when it was finished, which made a fabulous sauce.

I'll add my praise to everyone else's--this dish was a solid hit at our dinner party last night. I used a pork loin, and coated it--including the middle--in the morning, letting it chill all day. The flavor, moistness and tenderness were outstanding; much to my surprise, no sauce of any kind was needed. Both sets of guests have requested the recipe, and even my husband, who dislikes pork roast, had seconds. Definitely a keeper.

This recipe is definitely a keeper! Since pork has a tendency to dry out as it cooks, the mustard coating keeps the roast very moist (as long as you don't skimp on the coating).

Wonderful dish! I made the suggested potato gratin and it made for a great combination. I used a small pork loin roast and it was very moist and flavorfull. I supect the earlier reviewers cooked the roast according to the recipe which IMHO is too much and will dry it out. A little work makes this a real keeper!

Rating: 2
Mustard coating did not add enough flavor to the meat IMO. I used a rather large pork roast for this recipe; perhaps a smaller tenderloin would have made the coating flavor more pronounced. Cutting slits in the meat and getting some of the coating inside would probably help, or maybe use one of those scary looking injector things. Otherwise needs a gravy to go along with.

Used a boneless pork roast, basted with white wine & used dried herbs. Delicious! Fabulous brown juice thickened a bit added nicely to it.Roast uncovered. I would use this on lamb or fish too. We served a chilean Merlot that was perfect for the full flavoured meat. The potatoes as suggested were wonderful too. Enjoy!

Rating: 4
Excellent flavors in this recipe! I did make a few substitutions as my family does not like the dryness of a pork roast. I used pork tenderloins and since I didn't have any fresh sage, I used dried. Beautiful results. Plus, the tenderloins need only to cook for about 25 minutes and I cooked them in a disposable broiler pan so I wouldn't have to hassle with a rack. I did cook them on pure convection (Dacor oven) and lowered the temperature by 25 degrees. I have also made this where I used a specialty mustard that has brown sugar and pecans in it--very good substitution. I made the potatoes that were suggested and my children loved them too. This recipe is a keeper!
