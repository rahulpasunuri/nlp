I made the chili lime butter using the recipe as written. Fortunately I did not cook the lobsters with the chili lime butter. We just used it as a dipping sauce. After a first taste, not one of my guests used the butter on the lobster because the taste of the lobster was better without it. The flavors in the butter compete with the taste of the lobster rather than complement it. I was sorry that I didn't also make plain drawn butter to use as an option.
