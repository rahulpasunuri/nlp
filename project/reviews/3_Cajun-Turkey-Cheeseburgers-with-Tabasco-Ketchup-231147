My husband and I both loved these burgers! I inadvertently ended up leaving the Old Bay seasoning out, however...will get some next time. I grilled some peppers on my cast-iron grill pan, then chopped them up and added them to the burger mixture before we grilled them. The tabasco (I used Tapatio) ketchup was delicious. Can't wait to make these again.

Excellent, robust flavor. I kicked it up a knotch on spices though. Very good and easy!

Chopped up red bell peppers and mixed to ground turkey with sweet onions, left out the salt and also added 1 an egg, wheat germ and soy flour to help hold patties together. Served with baked sweet potato french fries. The Tabasco ketchup is a great counterpoint to the fries and the burger definatly needed it.

Wow. I am surprised to see the negative reviews of this recipe. My husband expressed an interest in losing weight, so I immediately jumped to compile a list of lunch recipes. This one is crazy good. I put more spice in everything, but the recipe is a solid base upon which to riff. I generally dice and saute the peppers and put em right in the patties--as opposed to laying them on like a garnish. It's just easier. The burgers seem small- so much so that I had made some veg. Hoppin' John to round out the meal, but neither of us ever need the side dish. It's complete and when you're done, you're full. Plus, it's easy to make on Sunday night, assemble and put them in the freezer, bringing to work each day. Very convenient, healthy, and tasty.

I don't quite agree with the last person. Bland isn't the word I'd use to describe this. More like... mismatched. None of the ingredients work well with any others.

Healthy recipes don't have to be bland ... but this one is. I prefer my usual turkey burger recipe, which has sun dried tomatoes chopped and added to the meat. So much tastier than this bland patty. You don't even need cheese! The "catsup" tasted so bad, I didn't even use it.
