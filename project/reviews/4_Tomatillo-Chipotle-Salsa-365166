If you are making a pork-based mexican or tex-mex meal, this salsa is a must have. Tart and smokey sauces are almost a requirement for pork, and this one fits the bill perfectly. If you, like my husband, are not a tomatillo fan, this salsa will not convert you. However, it's easy enough that I can make it just for me. The "hardest" part is chopping the cilantro, and if you're making mexican food, you're probably doing that anyway. Double the garlic. If you want it hot, add cayenne or hot sauce because the chipotles don't really give it a lot of heat. And if you have guests that really like this salsa and you intend to serve it with chips, you may want to double the recipe, because two cups goes fast.

This is a fantastic salsa I've made several times. Important note: Do NOT use dried cilantro in place of fresh. Even reducing the amount to one-third of the 1/4 cup left the salsa with a harsh, woody taste.

nice simple flavor. i put my tomatillos and onion and a small yellow tomato in the oven. chipotles gave it a nice kick and helped enhance the smokiness of the roasted veggies. gonna buy lime tortilla chips to dip in it.
