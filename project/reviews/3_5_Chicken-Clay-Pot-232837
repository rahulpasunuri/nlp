This was very good. I substituted red chili flakes for the thai chiles. Recipe was very easy and my family loved it. I'm sorry I did not double it.

I really love Charles Phan's restaurants and cooking, so I was a little disappointed in this. When I first cooked the brown sugar to a slight bubbling consistency, I slowly (as it directs in the recipe) added in the fish sauce and it seized up. I did keep cooking it down until most of the lumps were gone, but it had a very strong almost acrid smell and taste. I actually threw it out and started over again. Instead, I simmered up the soysauce mix (with less soy) and a little chicken stock, added in the brown sugar to this mixture and let that simmer on the stove for a little while. Then, I added in the fish sauce, garlic, chiles, ginger, then the chicken pieces and simmered that for about 8 -10 minutes. The result was not carmelized chicken, but it was tastey and similar to a Vietnamese dish with more of a liquid sauce than a thick sauce. I agree with the feedback on the soy sauce - it's too much. I also agree that is not the recipe from the slanted door - something is missing in this. Overall I suggest play with this recipe a little and alter it to your own tastes. The ingredients are all there but take some creative license and make it your own!

I'm not Vietnamese and I generally do not consider myself strong when I cook with Asian flavors. Having said that, this is AWESOME! It is super easy. One change I'd make is to slightly thicken the sauce. It would make it tastier.

This was good and very easy to make. I had to substitute lime juice for lemon and apple cider vinegar for the white, since it's what I had on hand. Overall, good but great.

I liked this recipe, but I agree with another reviewer who said there was too much of a soy sauce taste. I used a wonderfully dark brown sugar which gave it a rich caramel flavor, but the soy sauce was overpowering. I would try it again with less soy sauce, more garlic, and maybe a little bit more vinegar or lemon juice. Also, I think the chicken would be better marinated and grilled and then added to the sauce, rather than cooked in the sauce.

My husband and I both thought this was terrible. A bad example of true Vietmanese food. Way too much soy sauce, and the dish is missing something to make it seem authentic. Mr. Phan (chef) did not give the secret to his real dish.

this was fabulous. although i was first intimidated by melting the sugar, it turned out to be easier than expected. it clumped a little when i added the fish sauce and soy mixture, but smoothed out nicely as it heated up. i used shrimp in lieu of the chicken, as i'm not a big chicken fan. i left the tails on and my boyfriend and i ate them with our fingers. it was sooo delicious. it would probably also be great with some scallops. it's a snap to make, and absolutely full of flavor. i served it with the grapefruit and jicama salad (also on this site)for a light, healthy meal. you'll love it if you love the combo of hot, sour, salty and sweet - a defining quality of vietnamese food. and there's a great vietnamese cookbook by the same name, btw.

So easy to make, and the flavors are intense. My sauce needed thickening a bit, so I added a little flour. I served it on top of rice to utilize the sauce as much as possible.

This was delicious and super easy to make. I sliced an onion into wedges and added it when the chicken was just starting to get cooked through. I then closed the lid of my claypot and the onions soaked up all of the wonderful flavors of the dish. I used golden brown sugar instead of the broken sugar, and the only problem I encountered is that the sugar hardened when I put the fish sauce and the soy sauce mixture in. Everything dissolved in the end and it was very yummy.
