I've made this recipe 2 years running and it is positively the best eggnog I've had! I could never find peach brandy, but none-the-less, omitting it and upping the rum and brandy a bit was delish. 3 Always get requested to make this, even from those whom claim they "detest the alcohol flavor in normal 'nogs".

After seeing the reviews, I decided to use this recipe for a holiday party. It was a huge hit with everyone, even people who are not big eggnog fans. A couple of people even asked for the recipe. I think the peach brandy really adds nice flavor. It's almost a light-tasting eggnog. Mine turned out on the less thick side, but it wasn't a big deal. I will make this again.

This is almost the same recipe as in Joy of Cooking. JOC uses all heavy cream (2 qts) and about 3 times as much booze. I made a hybrid. I cooked the egg yolks and cream in the top of a double boiler and until it started to steam and then added regular sugar to dissolve it. For a half a recipe used 2 cups dark rum, 1/2 cup brandy, and some apricot brandy. Chilled over night and added beaten egg whites. Fannie Farmers cookbook says to let eggnog age for a week, which we do, and we always manage to drink it up. I just never know whether to have it before dinner, after dinner, or for dinner!

Whoa! We divided this recipe by 6. It filled three pint glasses. It's pretty delicious, and very strong...maybe I did my math wrong;)

The base of this recipe was great and easy to make. I heated about 1/4 of the cream/milk to 165 degrees and stirred it into/tempered the egg yolks prior to adding the rest of the ingredients. I also used 1 c Myers Dark Rum, 1 c Knob Creek bourbon, and 2 c spiced brandy in lieu of the alcohols listed in the recipe. It's definitely a strong bowl of nog and the alcohol sneaks up on you, but it's a great recipe with a good balance of creaminess.

Perennial favorite. This is in another class compared with store-bought egg nog and fun to make. It has been our holiday party beverage for several years running. It's okay to halve the recipe for fewer guests. I substitute whole milk for the heavy cream and still it is rich. I have also used various kinds of fruit brandy: peach, apricot, cherry all work.

Excellent, not too thick, everyone loved it. Packs more of punch than it tastes like.

THis is the best eggnog, I made it last christmas for my family and they're asking for it again this year. My mom, a chef, doubted the peach brandy, and she's the one asking for it again. Although, I halve the recipe because last year we were drinking it for weeks!

This eggnog is great. It is better than the recipe my family and I made a few years back. I made this whole recipe for 3 people, my grandmother is on her 3rd glass... yikes. I used all rum, I am not one to mix different types of alcohol. I went with Gosling's Black Seal, as I prefer the taste of dark rum. Next time I will cut way back on the egg whites. This more resembled eggnog-fluff as a finished product than a beverage. It is still heavenly holiday delight in a glass :)

Best eggnog ever. For those of you worried about raw eggs, I heat the yolks slowly on the stove with the cream to kill any potential bacteria. I also have cut back the alcohol a bit as people have become drunk at parties who did not intend to!

Four years ago, my husband grimaced when I told him I was going to make egg nog. After tasting this, it turns out he just doesn't like store-bought egg nog! He looks forward to this every year!

I originally made this since I live in Baltimore. What a great, great treat. Everyone loves it. Giving the receipe this year to my children who are chefs. I believe it was originally found in an old Baltimore cook book, hence the name. Lady from Baltimore Dec. 6, 2008

Great Eggnog, but 30 people is a bit much. Conversions are: 15people: * 6 eggs, separated * 1 cups superfine sugar * 1 cup brandy * 4 ounces light rum * 4 ounces peach brandy * 3 cups milk * 1 cup heavy cream * Nutmeg 7.5people: * 3 eggs, separated * 1/2 cup superfine sugar * 1/2 cup brandy * 2 ounces light rum * 2 ounces peach brandy * 1.5 cups milk * 1/2 cup heavy cream * Nutmeg 4people: * 2 eggs, separated * 1/4 cup superfine sugar * 1/4 cup brandy * 1 ounce light rum * 1 ounce peach brandy * 3/4 cup milk * 1/4 cup heavy cream * Nutmeg

This is the best egg nog I have ever had, hands down. I did add a little vanilla extract which was yummy. I also cut the alcohol in half and used champagne cognac instead of brandy; it was still pretty potent. Don't worry about the peach brandy - it tastes wonderful. Make this.

did not know egg nog could be so good! mixed skim milk with half and half and cut back on the egg whites...which, I think, are not entirely necessary. You can decide for yourself as adding them is the final step.

I served this eggnog at my holiday party last evening and it was a HUGE hit! I doubled the receipe, which was perfect for about 70 guests and also used apricot brandy as I couldn't find the peach variety. Huge hit and will definitely make it again!

Everyone loves this eggnog and it's super easy. I mixed whole (2/3) and 1% milk (1/3), but didn't skimp on anything else. It's got a kick, so be careful.

Amazing. And sweet. I don't like my eggnog's to be super alcoholic, so I cut down a lot on the amounts. I made half the recipe and basically added 1/4 cup each of brandy and kahlua (what I had on hand plus I had a great kahlua, vodka and eggnog drink that was on my mind obviously). The kahlua makes it sweet! Try it, you will not be dissapointed.

This drink was wonderful. It is strong, as other reviewers said, so serve small portions! I always hated store-bought eggnog because it was so gooey, but this was so good! I'll definitely make it again.

I used this with my first time making eggnog. It was wonderful, and got great reviews. It needs to be mixed thoroughly. I will be making this again at Christmas.

I made this for New Years and Christmas and it was a huge hit both times. The eggnog drinkers raved about it and the non eggnog drinkers added a shot of white chocolate liquor and loved it too. There was not a drop left either time!

Loved this as a drink and as ice cream! I cut back on the booze a bit and still found it quite powerful. I worried about over-mixing the whites, but ended up needing to stir it up in the bowl during the party as we otherwise had a bit of a 'raft'. The ice cream was super with almost zero effort (one mixing after freezing overnight).

Excellent 'nog. Same night, I did a custard-based eggnog that took about 45 minutes to prep. This took only minutes to do. One minor alteration -- after whipping the whites, I went ahead and whipped the cream. Then incorporated both with a balloon whisk. Mmmmm. I also substituted poire william for peach brandy -- made more culinary sense to me.

I make this recipe for each holiday party i go to and without fail, everyone who takes a glass ends up asking for the recipe. Try this recipe if you want to deter all the bad images you have of eggnog.

Every time I make this it is a major hit, even people that swear they don't like eggnog end up loving this. I could not find any peach brandy at a local liquor store back about 4 years ago when I first made this so substituted applejack instead. Since everyone loves the recipe so much I have just continued to use the applejack every year instead of the peach brandy.

I have made this version for years now and recently my 22 year old son asked for "our traditional Eggnog" recipe. He can't imagine a Christmas season without this libation. It is hands down the best I have ever found and it has been a tradition in our home here and in Mexico. Very smooth and rich.

Rating: 4
Fantastic flavor. I couldn't find peach brandy so I used schnapps instead. The subtle hint of peaches added great complexity. For non-drinkers, this is certainly a lot of alcohol so I may cut back in the future. But I certainly didn't mind finishing the remainders one bit.

This eggnog was a huge success at my Christmas party. All of my guest were raving about how truly delicious and smooth it was. Those that were not eggnog drinkers surprised themselves. Everyone loved it. Apricot brandy and fresh nutmeg is highly reccomended.

I made this last year, and everyone raved. It is one of those drinks that sneaks up on you. You do taste a hint of alcohol, but rest-assure that it is in there, and there is a lot of it. Not only would i make it again, I AM making it again.

The creme de la creme of egg nogs. I had some leftover and froze it for a delightful egg nog ice cream!

I have made this for the past three years and it's a hit every time. The only modification I made was instead of the peach brandy (because originally I couldn't find it) was substituting apple schnapps. It was such a big hit the first time that I have just stuck with the schnapps every since.

Truly an eggnog beyond compare. This is the second year I have made it, and now it is an embeded tradition in our house. Could not have Christmas without it. Definitely better than my Dad's version, and his was pretty darn good. Caution your guests, this is one deceptively powerful drink, because it is so delicious and silky smooth.

Was a real hit at Christmas. I have been asked for it again and so am making a half recipe for a Valentines party. I had a few cups left over at Christmas and made a delicious ice cream out of it by simply freezing and stirring now and then while it was freezing. Delicious.

Took it to a Christmas party even the men were asking for the recipe...yum!

This is the BEST eggnog ever! I used the suggestions in the reviews and used equal parts of milk and cream and substituted apricot brandy for the peach. One note of caution: I bought pasteurized eggs and separated them as in the recipe, which I made on Christmas Eve. However, on Christmas morning, I tried to whip the whites to finish this, but they would not whip. I had to scramble to find enough eggs on a day when the stores were all closed. Fortunately, one of my neighbors had a well-stocked larder. EVERYBODY drank this (it DOES pack a punch) and then I took the remainder on Saturday to another get-together with mostly non-drinkers and it DISAPPEARED! Terrific stuff!

This was delicious eggnog, but boy does it pack a punch! You really do have to go easy on it. I even reduced the amount of brandy to one cup instead of 2. I made it for a party, but unfortunately most of my guests were not big eggnog drinkers, but those that did thought it was the best!

Some of the beaten egg whites float on the top, making it frothy and attractive. I think this was extra-good because I used milk and cream from a local farm.

This is the best egg nog I have ever tasted. I have made it for the last three years, and our friends now start calling in November to ask when "Egg Nog Night" is. My only recommendation is to use a really big container for final mixing, as it can get very messy if you use too small a bowl.

Definitely a keeper. If you happen to have butterscotch schnapps around (sounds disgusting, tastes gorgeous), try that instead of the apricot brandy. YUM YUM!

I made this for an open house this weekend and it was a huge hit! I was getting very concerned about completely running out well before the party was over and I made 4 batches. Many guests asked for the recipe. It was so easy, I would absolutely make this again next year.

This is better than any eggnog I've ever had. Very good proportions of egg:cream:alcohol. I took previous suggestions and used 2 pints of whole milk and 2 pints heavy cream instead of 3:1. I used apricot brandy instead of peach. Only modification I might make next time is to beat the egg whites only until soft, instead of firm. It was perhaps too fluffy, if you think that is possible. Whipped this up yesterday to bring to a party. I overheard several people commenting (positively) on the eggnog during the evening. Makes about a gallon and a half.

I made this Eggnog for a Christmas Party. It was very easy and super tasty, and got rave reviews! I substituted the peach Brandy for apricot, (since I already had that in the house). My husband enjoyed it so much he requested it later in the week. In the second batch I put in a little more heavy cream and whipped it with a wisk. I plan to make this recipe again for a holiday Party in two weeks. I don't think we will be buying eggnog at the store anymore!
