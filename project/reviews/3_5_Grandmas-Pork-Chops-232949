I was looking for a new simple way to do pork chops in a hurry with what I had on hand tonight after work. It is amazing how much flavor a rub and 45 soak can impart! The citrus tenderized inexpensive pork chops beautifully. My family raved...a keeper.

My boyfriend is Ecuadorian. He said these were exactly like what his mother used to make--he meant it as a compliment & being compared to a guy's mom's cooking? Well, compliments don't come better than that! (but she used beef). For Americans this might be a bit too strong in the salty department, but I like salty so it was good for my taste. If you like meat flavorings from Dominican or Columbian restaurants, you'll like this...

I followed the recipe except I didn't have a lemon, so I used only oranges. Turned out really great. Served it with the haricot verts with almonds recipe on this site and au gratin potaotes.

Loved these pork chops. I followed the instructions exactly, and then used a meat thermometer while frying because I'm terrible with judging done-ness. These are my favorite pork chops to date - very simple, flavorful, and juicy.

Best pork chops ever. They are juicy and very flavorful. I make them all the time.

Delicious. I think this recipe would work on pork tenderloin and chicken as well. My family loved it...

I liked this but the seasonings were a little too spicy for my child. Next time I will tone it down a bit.

I love this recipe. I use store bought Adobo and marinade the pork chops before frying. My family loves this recipe.

The dry rub recipe for these chops was very salty. Next time I would reduce the salt amounts by half. The garlic and onion powders should do their job for making the pork chops tasty. I might make this again but not any time soon.
