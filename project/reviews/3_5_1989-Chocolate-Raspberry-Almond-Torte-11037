I just made this recipe twice and it is fantastic. For the cake ingredient, I used bittersweet chocolate. The cake can be made a day ahead of time

My friends and family thoroughly enjoyed it. Found it easy to prepare. Didn't make the glaze or ganache due to time limitations.

Cake was delicious and moist. I added extra chocolate to the batter, and so the almond and raspberry flavors were overwhelmed. However, I applied the glaze soon after the cake came out. That may be why my cake was nice and moist. Next time I may omit the chocolate from the tort entirely, and rely on the ganache for the chocolate component. Still everyone enjoyed it, and I will definitely make again.

Like my girlfriend once said You can have three people follow the same recipe to a tee (ie: the Printed recipe) & you will get three different results - some of us have the knack & sorry to say some of us don't PS I AM lucky enough to be one who gets it right, but I DO ENVY those like my mama who is able to cook with a handful of this, handful of that & have consistently great results. My hat is lifted to you that to me is real cooking

I followed this recipe to the letter. I must agree with a previous reviewer who observed that it was dry and lacked the exoected flavors. Quite a disappointment.

I have made this dessert time and time again and always get rave reviews. It's easy enough to make in a short period of time but makes quite an impression.

Wonderful! Easy! Rich! everything I look for in a recipe. I actually added 1 1/2 cups of rasberries (accidently)and it was very moist and delicious. The only issue I had was with grinding the almonds into nut butter. It was a bit tough on my mini prep processer, even though I pressed it for 20 sec per time. Worked good though. I like this because it is able to sit out on the counter with out refrigeration after it is made and not take up valuable fridge space!

This is the most elegant, simple and delicious chocolate torte! I've made it many times to universal raves. But I lost the recipe about 2 years ago and I've been looking online for it and not finding! What's the story? It was published first in 1989. Did they publish it again in 1991?

Made this for my gourmet club, and it turned out beautifully. It is rich and is best eaten the day it is made. The leftovers were a bit dry the next day. I doubled the glaze.

I found this cake disappointing. Neither the raspberry nor almond flavor came through, and I followed the recipe. The cake was dry. It had too many steps to not be wonderful.

Truly outstanding. I doubled the glaze as recommended. I used cherry brandy and for the ganache I used 3.5 oz bittersweet and 2.5 oz semisweet chocolate, but next time I will use all bittersweet. The torte did stick a bit, so butter the pan very well. Anyone really buy lemon leaves?

Easy to make and won rave reviews from my friends and family! I doubled the glaze (thanks for the tip, Texas!) and used frozen raspberries. I used plain brandy, and it had a nice balance of raspberry, almond, and chocolate flavors.

If all the directions are followed carefully this can turn out to be a masterpiece! I used frozen raspberry's in the cake and also doubled the glaze recipe. It turned out perfect. The lemon leaved garnished with a few fresh raspberry's make this look as if a pastry chef made it. Good idea to make a day before to let all the flavors blend. The almond flavor is very subtle and almost overpowered by the rasberry's. If you want to impress someone defintely try this recipe!

Very good for chocolate lovers. Delicious, but rich. The toasted almond flavor is subtle, but distinct, and adds a nice touch. Tastes even better the next day. Tip: I had to double the recipe for the glaze as there was not enough to cover the entire torte.
