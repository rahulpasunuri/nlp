My sweetie fell in love with this dish. Very delicious. Used curry powder instead of Maggi seasoning, and added a slice of swiss cheese between bread and ham. He keeps hoping I'll make it again!

I thought it was pretty good, but I would just use my toaster to toast the bread if I ever made it again. The oven made it too dry. My husband was not impressed.

I made this with leftover ham. It was delicious. I added sherry, used lowfat sour cream and milk and placed thin sliced of swiss cheese with the ham on the toast. My husband and I loved it. This is a great dish for leftover ham.

I've made a variation of this for years; try adding a couple of teaspoons of good sherry to the pan before adding the milk. I also use FF sour cream and skim milk, but skip the ham (I find that with a salad the meal is plenty satisfying and the flavors complex). I agree -- the best comfort food!

Served this for lunch and it was excellent with green salad and a cup of tomato consomme. Added curry instead of Maggi or Bovril and used 1% milk and instant flour. Think this quickened the process. Great comfort food for Canadian winters! Thanks.
