Delicious! We do a variation with salmon instead of white fish, and we use white wine instead of the oj - plus add 1 clove of garlic to each packet. Pair with a seasoned rice...always a crowd pleaser.

This is a wonderful quick recipe. Sometimes I use sugar snap peas instead of asparagus and while orange juice is good, so is guava, passion fruit, or mango juice. I usually use tilapia and eat it atop quinoa. So fresh and healthy!

This was great. I added the Garlic and the Lemon as some have suggested. I made this for my boyfriend and his roommates and they loved it. Having never cooked fish before I found this very easy and quick to make.

As written this is just okay in my book. May try it again adding zest and garlic as others have suggested.

This is a great, quick recipe for a light fish course. I use a fresh orange for the juice and add the zest. Pair with a wild rice blend and you've got a fantastic mid-week dinner

To those people who have been rating this recipe poorly- did you see the description "delicately flavored"? This is a great quick and easy fish dish, it is a delicately flavored dish but goes very well on a white fish. I didn't taste much orange and plan to add some orange zest or lemon juice next time around, however flavor was just fine. I did add a clove of garlic for the whole thing, a bit more tarragon and did a bit less butter than called for.

DELICIOUS!!! Last night I made 1/2 of the recipe and used the fish I had on hand (2 flounder and 1 pollock fillet that weighed a total of 12 oz.) Only lightly sprinkled them with dried tarragon and the zest of one small orange. Baked all in a 13" x 9" glass baking dish. It did take 25 minutes at 425 degrees (we are at a moderately high elevation). SUPER, AND WILL DEFINITELY MAKE AGAIN SOON!!

If it looks bland going into the bag, it's going to taste bland coming out, people. I give 2 forks for recipe as written, 4 forks for our improvisational results. We changed this a lot, as we feared blandness. Doubled orange zest. Added julienned carrots. Topped each filet with 2 thin slices of lemon, a sprig of fennel greens, and a mix of minced parsley and garlic. Went really easy (halved at most) on the butter and oj to make it healthier. Our 6 oz fillets and tons of veggies took 17 minutes and the result was very moist and perfectly cooked and highly flavorful. Bright, clean, delicate.

The asparagus was good and I liked the light flavor from the tarragon, but the fish was overcooked after 17 minutes. We didn't eat it and I ended up using the leftovers for fish salad sandwiches. Still, I might try this recipe again since it was so easy.

Excellent dish if you are like me and are tired and hungry when you finally get home from work. I can set these up in the morning before work, refrigerate them, come home and pop the packets in a hot oven, and sit down to dinner within 30 minutes. I like using cod or tilapia fillets, a dollop of pesto on each fillet, sliced lemon, a drizzle of white wine along with the asparagus. Delicious!

Rating: 3
This is a good dish... I only wished it had a touch more flavor. We added garlic based on the advice of other reviewers, which was a great idea because it's so tasty, but also made the house smell delicious during those few minutes it took to cook. Next time, I think I'll marinate the fish in the juice with tarragon and garlic,etc for at least a few hours to get a little more flavor out of it.

Rating: 4
The only extra thing I added to this recipe was a few slices of lemon on top of the fish prior to baking. I do think it needed this. Otherwise, this recipe was delicious and very easy. Practically fool proof. My husband, who does not eat fish, actually ate this without even flinching - and asked me to make it again in the future.

This was a delicious, easy weeknight dish. The flavors weren't overpowering and the orange paired nicely with the fresh asparagus. Parchment is a great way to cook fish and I'd definitely make the dish again!

We really liked this dish. I used halibut & after reading some of the reviews decided to cut the butter down by half & added garlic & cilantro. Also skipped the parchment paper & used an oven dish sealed w/foil. Will definitely make again.

Easy, easy, easy. Made it as instructed with cod and when I do it again I'll cut back on the butter...as someone else said, it really didn't need as much as it calls for. The flavor is subtle and the fish came out very light and perfectly cooked.

Actually, we would give it 2.5 folks as it was very good (especially considering how easy it was). I didn't have fresh tarragon, so used dried and added some batons of carrots and red pepper so to make it a complete meal. Served everything (along with juices) over brown rice. Might try boiling down the oj to get a bit more concentrated flavor.

I was not impressed with this - I ended up with a lot of liquid at the bottom of the packets. Fish tasted very bland. Perhaps it was my inability to correctly close the packets.

I added some chopped garlic and instead of fresh herbs, did a dried herb blend. Came out really nice...the fish was very moist and flakey. Served with couscous which was great if you let it soak up the juices from the fish packet.

Like so many others, I had to tweak the recipe, I ran out of tarragon 2 days ago! I used dill, sauted a couple of leeks & didn't have fresh orange juice so I used about 1 teaspoon of concentrate per fillet. Oh & I left out the butter, it didn't need it. The dish turned out beautifully. It presented very well & tasted great. My DH said it's the best this particular fish has ever tasted! I used a full pound of asparagus for 2...:)

I made this recipe for my family and extended family the day before Easter. It was a big hit. The only change I made was that I used lemons (my husband doesn't like the flavour of oranges in entrees). I didn't find it bland. I found it to be a light, flavourful, healthy meal. I'm making it again tomorrow night for my son's family birthday party. Can't wait to eat it.

My husband loved it and he doesn't really like fish! I did add a little garlic and orange zest. Plus, a little dried summer savory. mmmmmm!

I'm not sure what went wrong, but this is one of the worst recipes I've made in a while. Maybe its because I used previously frozen cod and added an orange slice...but the fish turned out like pudding. Seriously, it was completely liquified...we couldn't even eat it. I think there was too much juice and it just boiled for 17 minutes..Ugh

I really liked this recipe, but with the following changes: spray the parchment paper with cooking spray instead of butter, add garlic and a few more tarragon leaves,add orange zest and top with an orange slice. Next time I'll try grapefruit, and when in season, blood oranges. Perfect cooking time and nice presentation for a really healthy, quick meal.

I agree that this recipe lacks flavor. I added a little bearnaise butter and some orange zest to each packet after it was opened and this helped tremendously.

Bland, bland, bland. A waste of good fish that could have been much more flavorful

Rating: 2
Delicate is not the right word for the flavor. The dish was decidedly bland, and since it's in parchment, you really can't taste along the way. I probably won't make this again, but if i do, I'll either marinade the fish or add more spices.

Rating: 2
I was disappointed by this recipe because the fish was bland, bland, bland. The other aspects were good though, and I would suggest seasoning the fish much more to those who are going to make it. If I make it again, I'll add all sorts of spices and seasoning to the fish.

I read this recipe in the Drs. office today, and came home to look it up. I made it with Salmon, and instead of plain OJ I had mango orange juice concentrate. I made the concentrate at 1:1 ratio, and poured about 2 tablespoons in, and the tarragon from my garden. I took the leaves off the stem, so they could be enjoyed (I still threw the stem in for good measure). It was sooo good. I will definitely make it again.

Not sure if this could be even called following the recipe, but here's what i did:For two packets: 1 large sweet onion, thinly sliced, sauteed with salt until soft. 2 tomatoes, chopped. zest of one orange. 10 cardamom pods. 2 tbsp vermouth. salt. white pepper. 2 tbsp butter. 12 tarragon leaves. Baked @400 for 17 mins. Open packets and add chervil. Served with jasmine brown rice. I used turbot which had a very mild flavour. Next time I wil try the same thing with a more flavourful fish.

Did the recipe as is in the article and it was great. I then re-did it, but this time I replaced the orange juice with an equal quantity of white wine and I also used dried tarragon instead of the fresh. This seem to bring more of the flavour of the fish out.

Light and delicate no-fuss dish just in time for spring/summer! In addition to the orange juice, I placed orange slices on top of my cod before cooking, which really added to the presentation. Served with rosemary potatoes and orange and walnut salad... Delicious!

You simply have to try this, I made it last night (half the receipe and bought wild, fresh cod at a fish monger) I read the reviews and added the thinly sliced, braised leaks, garlic and orange zest. I used fresh flat leaf parsley and dried tarragon as I had no fresh tarragon and it was stunning. My husband raved and he does not like fish as a rule!! It is so quick and easy for such great results.

I couldn't find halibut so I substituted sea bass instead. As was recommended by another reviewer, I used both orange juice and small amounts of orange rind. Also, the tarragon flavor combination is just superb! This is a very good dish!

This was easy to prepare and had a beautifully subtle flavour. Unwrapping the package on your plate is fun, too. To be fair, I've been trying to lose weight so everything tastes pretty good to me right now, but I served this to my husband accompanied with TJ's brown rice medley and it got rave reviews. Definitely a keeper. (even with the butter, this was low on "points" for fellow WW'ers)

Excellent and easy! I took the advice of other commenters and added sauteed leeks (2 large, sliced thin, sauteed until just turning translucent) which really made the dish perfect. Next time, I will added some grated zest, as the orange flavor was non-existent - I'd like to taste the orange a little bit more.

Excellent! Took reviews into consideration and added a Jumbo prawn and extra tarragon. Now my wife wants it again, but with more Orange (will add some zest) plus she wants double the asparagus (loves asparagus). Served with rice. It's a Keeper!

Absolutely delightful. I had never cooked with parchment before, so I had a few doubts about cooking fish with no way to check if it was done. This recipe was great. I used very fresh haddock. Another virtue of it is that it can be prepared for as many, or as few, as you would like. I'm keeping this one.

This was an exceptional idea for a dish. I say idea, because I also modified it in similar ways to the previous reviewers. I used lemon juice instead of the orange, and I also took the tip to add sauteed leeks, which added a lovely spring flavor. I also upped the quantity of tarragon - 3-4 whole fresh sprigs on top of the fish. Fresh ingredients are key. This was a really special, fresh spring meal - moist and flavorful, and the veggies and fish perfectly cooked in the parchment. We enjoyed it paired with a light Sauvingon Blanc, and it was perfect.

This was DELICIOUS! I used sole which is too thin for this recipe so I folded the fillets over and added one large prawn. I also added 2 thinly sliced shitakes to each packet with the asparagus,a LITTLE orange zest and a tad more tarragon.

This was a disaster! I cooked it for much longer than 17 minutes and the fish still wasn't done. Even if it would have cooked, it was pretty boring in flavor.

We used haddock for this, and the fish itself was delicious and tender from being parchment-baked. The asparagus was quite good. I didn't taste much orange flavor, and I think we could have used more tarragon -- so the overall flavor as a dish, rather than the individual elements, could have been more interesting and cohesive.

Made this with no changes using very fresh halibut. Great taste - delicate flavors and great texture produced by steaming in the parchment.

I used halibut, and I loved it. I'll definitely make it again. The flavors weren't especially bold, but I still really liked it. It seemed light and healthy (I don't get too worked up about 1 tbsp of butter per serving -- you need a little bit of richness to feel satisfied and full). Next time, I don't think I'll spend $3.29 on a packet of fresh tarragon; if it added any flavor, I couldn't discern it. Maybe I should have used more. OVerall, thumbs up.

OK. First let me say that I found NO tarragon at the store, so had to change the recipe quite a bit. I used dill and lemon juice and butter with the fish (sea bass) and it was SO delicious. My husband said it was as good as the parchment fish he had at Vincent's in Scottsdale.
