I added salt (teaspoon) to this recipe and liked them enough to include in Chritmas cookies baskets! My family loves them.

I have made this twice and still don't like the results. The first time I chopped the almonds very fine in a food processor and decided that they were chopped too fine. The second time I chopped them more coarsely, but still ended up with a globby mess. The taste was fine (although it could do with more almonds) but there was nothing to "sprinkle". I am going to refrigerate and see about breaking up the globs, but overall this was a disappointment.
