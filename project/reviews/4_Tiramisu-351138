My (Italian) husband is undone by this tiramisu every time I make it, even the one time I goofed and ended up with a slightly sloppy mascarpone mixture. The flavours are just divine. I prepare it in a trifle bowl and top with fresh blueberries and raspberries. Looks incredible and tastes even better. Wonderful dessert to take to any social gathering.

I made it in 6 individual dessert cups and there was plenty of the marscapone mixture - even extra. It was delicious and fairly simple and I will definitely make it again.

I reviewed this scrumptious recipe about a year ago and it remains to be a favorite. I finally figured out local Italian bakeries have the FIRM ladyfingers! Double the ingredients works well for a HUGE show piece of dessert that shouts out the holidays!

I've reviewed this before but encountered something tonight that I hadn't had happen and wanted to share ... the egg yolk/marsala/sugar mixture *cooked*. It had been growing nicely but I didn't realize the heat was too high. This REALLY needs to be done on minimal heat. Perhaps that is the issue that some folks have encountered with the mixture not tripling. My next batch turned out nicely and the tiramisu is chilling in the fridge as I type. Just a thought.

A nice, reliable recipe. I agree that the amount of cream isn't enough for a 9"x13" pan; I increased the yolks, marsala, sugar, and cream by 1.5 (i.e. 6 yolks, etc.) and had just enough. For a previous cook that posted about the mixture being sloppy/wet, I would imagine the heat from the cooked zabaglione liquified the mascarpone. I would recommend letting the custard cool fully before combining it with the cheese. I also chose to pre-whip the mascarpone and then fold the components together (zabaglione into mascarpone, whipped cream into both).

This turned out very well for me, and I was especially happy to find a recipe that did not call for uncooked eggs. I made a half recipe and put it in a 8x8 pan. I had more than enough of the dipping liquid, and to use all of it would have made the savoiardi too soggy.

Followed this recipe to make my first tiramisu. Turned out great! Didn't have coffee liquer so I added chocolate liquer instead. Next time I will make a little more of the coffee mixture as I found there was not enough for 36 ladyfingers.

This tiramisu was absolutely amazing! I think it was better than most of the tiramisu desserts I had in Italy (about one every night for two weeks). The amount of filling was just fine and I followed the recipe exactly. I was not able to find lady fingers at our grocery store, so instead I made some using this recipe from allrecipes.com (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/ladyfingers/). They were pretty easy to make. I also don't have an espresso maker, so I just ordered 2 cups of espresso from the coffee shop around the corner..they thought I was crazy. I will definitely go through all this again :)

Great...a keeper it is! I'm always happy I take the time to read reviews. I took the advice of previous cook to double the creamed portion, and s/he was dead on. I could only get the "light and fluffy" ladyfingers so I took the advice of yet another cook and toasted them first in order for the cookie to hold up to coffee dunking. Next time I will search in advance to fiind the crisp ladyfingers. Very easy to make with a celebratory impact for a New Years Eve crowed.

I've made this twice and both times the consistency turned out completely wrong: the zabaglione was thick and liquidy instead of light and fluffy. I followed the recipe exactly and then beat both the whipped cream and the egg mixture for extra time to try to get the volume. It didn't come close to tripling in volume. It tasted delicious but something was either wrong with the proportions or my cooking. Can anybody explain to me how to get this recipe right?!

Rating: 4
I loved this and so did everyone else who consumed it. My only frustration making it was that I had to double the marscapone, cream, eggs, etc. in order to fill the 9x13 pan-which is the size called for in the recipe. The amounts specified only covered enough for 1 layer, so I had to put it in the 'fridge and make another trip to the store to purchase more ingredients! Uuuugh!! So, for anyone out there who plans to serve this (and you should!), if you do use a 9x13 just double all ingredients (except lady fingers, coffee, tia maria).

My first time making tiramisu, and it was SO EASY, delicious and lovely to look at! My guests were wowed, it was not messy (I too used a deep bowl) and it was quick to prepare. This is easily adjustable to any size dish, as you can just chop the ladyfingers into whatever length you need. I double-dipped them in the espresso for extra coffee liqueur flavor - yum! I made it a day ahead and took it out 30 minutes ahead to rest - PERFECT!

Rating: 4
My first time ever making tiramisu, and this turned out great - very easy. It didn't make a mess in my kitchen (I was concerned based on the other reviewers!), but that's probably because I used deep bowls. I made 1/2 a batch in a 6"x9" dish, and it worked really well. Next time I will double the cream to make it a little lighter and fluffier.

Rating: 4
Thought it was very tasty but felt a 9x13 pan was much too large. Next time I will put it in a smaller pan with more layers.Subsituted Kahlua for the Tia Maria since that is what I had and will use a little more Marsala nest time. Otherwise a very good recipe.

Rating: 4
This is the perfect tiramisu. I made it with creme de cacao (~$6 bottle) instead of the tia maria. I used 2C mascarpone and made up the additonal 1/2 C required with ricotta. Delicious! It sets up nicely and looks great on the plate. Since other reviewers mentioned the overspray when beating the egg mix, I used a deep, 4.5qt pyrex bowl over a large pot of simmering water and it worked well. GREAT RECIPE!

I've made this tiramisu now for 2 weddings and numerous parties and it is always a huge hit. I do a lot of baking and this has become my most requested dessert. I've had friends take trips to Italy and say this tiramisu is up to par, if not better, than what they tried in Italy. I follow the recipe exactly (except for adding bittersweet chocolate curls or shavings to the top) and it turns out amazing every time. I love this recipe!

Okay, color me "idiot," but I did not make this with mascarpone. I made it with ricotta, which is what I had in the fridge. It came out so delicious, I will make it with ricotta in the future (besides, it's almost impossible to get mascarpone here). Wow.

Yes, the kitchen was a mess, but thank goodness for electric mixers, both hand-held and stand. Can't get pre-made ladyfingers here so I made them myself, using Julia Child's recipe (surprisingly easy and no doubt far better ingredients than store-bought). Had to use Frangelico instead of Tia Maria and (gasp!) SWEET Marsala instead of dry, and it came out FANTASTICALLY DELISH!!! This is a KEEPER!!!

Easy? Not quite (afterward, my kitchen was a wreck from the flinging of all those sugary ingredients), but definitely worth the effort.

Make sure to have your mascarpone at room temperature before using it! Mine wasn't quite there and my custard wound up a little lumpy- looking (though it tasted great). I also didn't whisk it quite long enough because there wasn't quite enough to creamily cover the entire tiramisu'. I wound up making the whole tiramisu', then topping it off with a whole NEW batch of plain whipped cream and dusting w/ cocoa powder in order to make it look presentable. So why did I give it 4 forks, you ask? Well, frankly, I'm pretty sure the troubles I had were my own damn fault and not the fault of the recipe. Also, it really was great in the end. Just make sure your dairy ingredients are room temp (except the heavy cream) and keep beating that mascarpone mixture till it really truly triples in volume! Who cares if your arm falls off! Anything in the name of good eating!

While I was making this, I was thinking that there was no way it would turn out to be as tasty as all the reviews said it was. I tasted the layers as I was making it and I thought it was going to be awful. But it was phenonmenal! I guess letting it sit overnight did the trick. I made fresh espresso (1/2 decaf) to make 2 cups worth. I used Kahlua in place of Tia Maria since the Tia Maria was $25 bucks a bottle. I found the little airplane sized Kahlua bottles at BevMo. It had 4 tablespoons in it so I used the whole thing. I also shaved dark chocolate over the top as well as the dusting of cocoa powder. It was so good! Be sure to use lots of chocolate to top it at the end. Next time, I might even layer some cocoa in the layers. I made it in a smaller dish and so I ended up with 3 layers of ladyfingers. I used the recommendation of a pastry brush to wet the ladyfingers and it worked great. I think the first time making this was time consuming, but I bet it will be much shorter next time.

Rating: 4
I cut this recipe in half and put in an 8x8 glass pan, and it worked out great, people raved. I used Kahlua in the coffee and Frangelico in the egg mixture, but the liquer flavor was too subtle for my tastes. So next time if I cut this recipe in half I will use the full recipe's amount of the liquers.

Rating: 4
Great basic tiramisu recipe. The egg custard is worth the extra work. I assembled it in a spring form pan - with the lady fingers standing up around the edges. It made for a great presentation - you can serve it like cake. I used amaretto instead of coffee liquor - and added almond slices to the whipped cream layers. Family and friends insist that this become a Christmas eve tradition!

Spectacular! I made this for our annual company potluck today and won first prize. It`s easy to make, and sublime! Not too sweet, the balance is perfect. A tip for presentation: I purchased some clear disposable wine goblets, cut the lady fingers in half for layering, and piped the filling. Topped with cocoa powder, three berries and white chocolate curls. The compliments were free-flowing!

We made this pie for Thanksgiving dinner - it was a real hit- very flavorful and moist. Many compliments from our diners myself included! I too substituted Frangelico for the Marsala. The dessert was a bit time consuming, but totally worth the time. The chocolate, marscapone and coffee flavors meld perfectly with the lady fingers. Hats off to the creators of this recipe at Gourmet.

I had been looking for that perfect tiramisu recipe for soooo long....and this one is that perfect one. Simply fantastic, creamy , rich and melt in the mouth. On the first try found that the cake/ biscuits were less in proportion to the cream , so the second and third time i used a soft home made sponge and drizzled the syrup on each layer. I gote four layers of the cream and presented it like a cake. A tablspoon or two of Kahlua added to the cream mix offsets the sweetness and I like the extra coffee flavour. Did not use the marsala but the Kahlua did the work. I will make it again and again ..... This is a big dessert, goes a long way.

Made recipe exactly as written, no deviations. It's a solid B, tasty, but not great. I'm a sucker for tiramisu...can't get enough of it :) The marscarpone cream mixture didn't have much flavor and the overall texture wasn't as creamy as I like. Safe alternative to raw yolk tiramisu, but unless that was a necessity I'd pass on this recipe.

I consider myself a very discriminating tiramisu eater. For years, I've avoided making my own, because I was sure it would never match up to the delicious tiramisu my Italian aunt makes. This recipe is definitely a contender (I'm considering suggesting a tiramisu taste test between hers and this recipe. I figure it's win-win). It was also very easy to make. I only made a couple of small changes. First, I didn't bother beating the eggs over the pan of simmering water- I bought my eggs fresh from the farmer's market and wasn't worried about using them raw. Everything still increased in volume just fine. I also had to use Kahlua Especial instead of Tia Maria, which I could not find. Finally, I used the natural savoiardi from Whole Foods, and only needed 3 3.5-ounces packs (I'm not sure if they're differently shaped). We had no problem using up the liquid, and the result was light, rich and delicious!

I tried it for the first time on Sunday. Took me longer than the prescribed 30 minutes but it turned out great. I did leave out Marsala and substituted it with Frangelico liquor instead. Tia Maria was also added into the expresso for soaking the fingers Yumm...

I am constantly asked to make this for pot lucks and functions!! And it really is quite easy. A couple of things I do differently - I use a scant 4 Tbl of espresso powder as 3 didn't seem to have the necessary kick. Also, I drizzle dark chocolate between the layers and on top - sometimes I use good quality dark chocolate chips instead. They are a nice contrast to the velvety softness of this dessert. You can't go wrong with this - every time I make it, it's gobbled up in moments!

This i was the first time i ever made or tasted tiramisu - all i have to say is i am HOOKED!. After the first time i made it i made some minor changes that resulted in a much better end result. [ For religious reasons i had to omit any alcohol - regardless it was an amazing dessert. First: I whisked the egg yolk and sugar on high for about 7 minutes on a double boiler with a hand mixer. You can try doing it by hand but its a lot of work and you might get clumps. Remember to use a big bowl so there is no splatter. Second: I put the bowl in an ice water bath to cool the egg yolk mixture before adding in the mascarpone cheese. Third: I added in the mascarpone cheese in different additions. The first two were whisked into the yolk mixture after had cooled. The next two additions were folded in very gently. By over working the mascarpone you get lumps. This is also cause by adding the the cool mascarpone to the hot yolk mixture. Forth: The night before you make this put a big steel bowl in the freezer. This speeds up the time you make the cream. Pour the heavy cream in the bowl and whip on high until it forms soft peaks. Gradually and gently fold this into the mascarpone-yolk mixture. Fifth: Don't over soak the ladyfingers!!!!! DUNK them them for a 1-2 Seconds maximum. Or they become very soggy.

This is a KILLER dessert. I made it for a co-worker's birthday. We all agreed it was the best we've ever tasted. No wonder 100% of the reviewers would make it again! Thanks to another commenter who suggested a trifle bowl, which made it very pretty and festive.

This is an amazing Tiramisu and exceptionally easy to make. I can see the importance of using the right lady fingers so that it doesn't get too soggy. It was just the perfect blend of ingredients - nothing too overpowering. I swear it was magic because it disappeared right before my eyes.

We followed this recipe faithfully and made this last night for a group of discriminating friends. They loved it! Yes, tiramisu seems so overdone and cliche, but this recipe is truly foolproof and delicious. The flavors of the Marsala and espresso really come through, and that's what makes this particular recipe quite special. We have made a number of tiramisu recipes in the past, and we highly recommend this one as the best.

This recipe got raves from our very critical Gourmet Cooking Club. I found the perfect lady fingers at an Italian Deli. (They were dry, allowing them to sop up the expresso mixture without falling apart and fit in size (4x1 inches)and number in the 9x13 pan as the recipe instructs. I couldn't find instant expresso but I found expresso roast beans and just brewed my own. An added touch: I piped a serpentine squiggle of caramel sauce over a sprinkle of grated dark chocolate on a white serving plate on which I placed the squares of tiramisu. I easily got 12 servings.

I have made this Tiramisu recipe 5 times now and it keeps getting better. The last batch I used Trader Vic's Kona Coffee Liqueur which is fantastic. After reading the reviews, I increased the heavy cream to 1-1/4 to 1-1/3 cups and fresh espresso. You do get better at using up the dipping liquid the more you make the recipe.

This was my first time attempting tiramisu and this recipe turned out fantastic! I had a couple variations - used two cups of brewed espresso rather than the powder and I couldn't find the crisp ladyfingers, so I used the soft cake- like ones. I dipped the first few and they seemed quite soggy, so I just used a pastry brush dipped in the espresso/Marsala on the rest. The dipped ones were the best - didn't seem soggy at all after chilling overnight, and they had the best flavor. I also used about a cup and a half of the whipping cream to fold in which made it a bit lighter. This recipe was very straightforward and simple I thought and will make it again! Hopefully soon.

Quick, easy and really good. I've made this a number of times and its always a hit. I figure the best compliment is an empty pan and this recipe has never let me down. While I haven't deviated from the recipe much, I have found that extra lady fingers may be necessary. And you probably can't go wrong by adding a little extra marsala too!

My husband and I LOVE tiramisu, so much that we critique it at every restaurant we can! This recipe is incredible! I made it for my family Christmas and it got eaten up!(and the leftovers stayed so well that they were gone the next day). It is the perfect combination of cakey and creamy. I like my ladyfingers to have a little cake like substance without being dry- these were perfect. I dipped both sides, as it says and they never got soggy(even on day 2). The zabaglione was incredible! My Italian mom couldn't stop talking about it. I have made MANY tiramisu recipes, and this is now my go-to!

This was my first time making Tiramisu, and it was successful for the most part (I would ideally give it 3.5 stars). The flavors were fantastic, but the texture was somewhat dense. I think the next time I make it, I'll try whisking the eggwhites and folding them in along with the cream to give it a fluffier texture. Overall very good recipe!

Absolutely delicious! I had to use soft ladyfingers (that I toasted as prior review suggested) and the texture turned out perfectly. I did have to double the coffee mixture to be able to dunk all the ladyfingers. I will make this again--got raves and looks lovely.

Perfect for me - though I changed a few things, i.e., substituted Marsala for the coffee liqueur in the soaking liquid. The biggest change I made was to substitute 4 stiffly beaten egg whites for the cream (I felt the mascarpone was rich enough already). This got rave reviews from my Italian roommates!

This is the best tiramisu I have EVER made! The zabaglione was perfect. I am Italian and this recipe tastes exactly like my nona's. I used all ingredients as written adding more heavy cream (per one reviewers recommendation). I brushed the espresso mixture onto the ladyfingers with a pastry brush. They did not disintegrate and contrary to one reviewer, I did use all the liquid.

Rating: 3
I made espresso and used that instead of instant coffee and used Amaretto instead of Tia Maria. I also substituted Port for Marsala. The beating of the eggs was a bit of a hit and miss as I wasn't quite sure if they 3pled or not but when I was beating for 8' I stopped. I'm giving this 3 because my biscuits aren't as moist but I suspect that might have to do with the fact that I'm cheating and not waiting 6 hours to try it. The rest is so creamy that I think I probably had too much. A scoop is enough! YUM!!!

This was a very good and simple recipe. My only real criticism is the cake portion becomes very wet if you dip both sides as instructed. Next time I will do it the more traditional way, lining up the ladyfingers in the dish, then drizzling the coffee mixture over it. Otherwise, very tasty.

This tiramisu was a hit!!! My six friends all had 2 servings each. I used Vin Santo instead of Marsala for the Zabaglione and skipped the coffee liquor just because I didn't have it. Very good, very light, very easy! Although I think the espresso mixture could be cut in half. I didn't used that much. I only dipped the top half of each savoiardi cookie to prevent them from getting too soggy, since the cookies will soften anyway being wrapped around all that cream...mmm...heavenly...

Made this last night. The egg yolks didn't triple. They merely doubled the volume. I wonder what I did wrong. Could the water be not warm enough or too hot? Next time I will get pasturized eggs and not do the double boiler and see what happens. Regardless, it was delicious!

Absolutely perfect tiramisu recipe. I have messed with this a couple of different ways and feel that the basic recipe is the best. It does make a LOT of tiramisu - not that this is necessarily a problem. I halved everything and made individual servings in 8 oz ramekins and that went well. For a special treat, I added a layer of a raspberry and balsamic vinegar reduction - if you do this, add another tablespoon of powdered espresso to your soak.

I have now made this four times and at the request of my husband who likes it a bit more on the cakey side, i lay the lady fingers slanted and stacked a bit against each other so they aren't 100% flat but not 100% on their sides. This gives what I think is the perfect cake to cream mixture. I've also increased the whipped cream by an additional 1/3 cup to make it even lighter.

This is delicious and easy - better than most restaurants. I will definitely make it again, but would use only about half the marsala - the 1/3 cup is a bit too much. Used kahlua instead of Tia Maria. I used Trader Joe's soft ladyfingers, and it turned out fine.

This is hands-down the perfect Tiramisu recipe and I think the zabaglione is what makes it stupendous. Mine came out that perfect combination of creamy and cakey, coffee flavor with a hint of liquor, but not too much that kids couldn't eat it.

I'm not an experienced tiramisu afcianado but I thought this recipe was simple and very tasty, exactly as written. I had starbucks liquor on hand so I used that instead of the Tia Maria which is the only change I made. The one problem I had was that the mouse layer wasn't as fluffy as it could have been. I should have looked for whipping cream instead of heavy cream. I used High Lane Farm organic heavy cream which doesn't whip up very fluffy and I've had this problem in the past so I should have known! I will definately make this one again though I will go with whipping cream instead.
