I used fingerling potatoes and baby organic spinach from the Farmer's Market. My guests gobbled it up - this one is a keeper and it is versatile.

Served this at a picnic and had rave reviews. Definitely deserves a four fork rating as far as potato salads are concerned!

This was a fantastic addition to our 4th of July barbeque. I added rosemary to the potatoes when roasting, and put a little honey in the dressing. I did not have dry mustard, so I just used some dijon. This was a wonderful salad. RH

GREAT! I too added fresh rosemary to the potatoes along eith the garlic. I also added honey to the dressing and it made a world of difference. I tossed the potatoes with the dressing and, just before serving put the potatoes on a bed of fancy greens. I then garnished around the platter with sliced tomatoes and sliced cucumber. It looked wonderful and I'll be making it again for a birthday party this weekend!

Delicious salad! I substituted small red potatoes, red leaf lettuce and Sweet 100 Cherry Tomatoes. Served it with barbecued, marinated flank steak--Great summer company dinner.

The potatoes were delicious even without the dressing (I had to restrain myself from eating them all up when they came out of the oven!). I sprinked rosemary over the potatoes before roasting. I added a teaspoon of honey to the vinaigrette to balance its tartness and some thyme as well. I think the key to this dish is to be liberal when salting the potatoes, and to add the vinaigrette to the potatoes while they're warm, then let them sit for at least 30 minutes so that the flavours can meld.
