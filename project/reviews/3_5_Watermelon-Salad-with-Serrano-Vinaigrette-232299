Why do people review things they haven't tried? Silly, if you ask me. Anyway. I love this salad. Because my partner doesn't like feta, I serve it with crumbled black pepper boursin cheese instead and I think it adds even more to the already tasty flavors.

Wow, what a disappointment. It looked so pretty, but the tastes were not there, in my opinion. Overall, the dressing was bland. It needed more zing, not nearly enough lime in my opinion to give it any kick. I also wanted more heat, despite having hot serranos (and getting a couple of hot bites here and there), and it needed more thyme flavor, even though I made it in advance. Somehow, the flavors just got lost in one another. I could not taste the lime or thyme at all. Very disappointing. I have had better watermelon salads. I think I will just make them, and use this presentation.

I own a steakhouse in New Jersey and served this salad...It got RAVE reviews. Sometimes it was ordered as a dessert..

Great recipe! I haven't made the pickled rind yet, but have made the rest of the recipe about 4 times last summer. Everybody loved it, except for my husband who's idea of a salad is Caesar!

Of the various watermelon salads I've tried, I think this is the best and believe the watermelon rind pickle makes the difference. With a vegetable peeler, getting the rind from the meat is a cinch. I don't think this salad is any more trouble than others. I did make the pickle and dressing the night before I served the salad and per suggestions added the watermelon at the end.

The combination is delightful! The juicy watermelon, the predominant taste, makes the salad refreshing. There's hardly any bite from the chili pepper. I made the watermelon rind and dressing a few days ahead. Putting the salad together was a snap.

I haven't made this yet, but WOW! I really don't think the very short comments from the Ontarian were worthy of such criticism!! She actually labelled it "curiosity" and just gave an honest opinion, that it seemed like a lot of work. Shame on all of you who turned it into a rip-apart fest! (How else can anyone learn, if we don't ask honest questions?)

Really enjoyed this with a few modifications. Used a combination of red and yellow watermelon, cubed and tossed with the feta and serrano, served on a bed of arugula tossed in the dressing. I made the pickled rind but didn't care for it and left it off of the salad. The salad was great this way - very pretty and refreshing!

Definitely for the more advanced cook, but worth the effort. A most imaginative combination of flavors and textures. If you own one, try grating the watermelon rind on a french mandoline, then parboiling for a minute or two before pickling. I also found the pickling liquid needed MUCH more sugar than the recipe called for.

Great recipe, and I don't think it's " a lot of work." Some of us actually enjoy our time in the kitchen. And if I was the type of person who lacked taste and imagination, and just assumed this would not taste good - like to Ontarian from the 1st post - I would at least hope I would be smart enough to assume that if a recipe like this appeared in a national cooking publication, it might warrant a try. Thankfully, I do possess enough food-savvy to know how great this flavor combination is, and just how popular watermelon salads have become.

To the folks from Ontario--Ever read Green Eggs and Ham? TRY IT before you start complaining about things you don't know about. please don't be ignorant and small minded about food! It's insulting and offensive. Watermelon and feta is a classic combination in the mediterranean region, it's absolutely delicious, an amazing summer treat and recently, i've seen it on the menus at some of the best new york restaurants. if you bothered to try it and judge honestly, you'd be better off, and none of us would have had to spend time thinking about your useless review. SORRY TO THE REST OF THE READERS WHO HAVE TO WADE THROUGH THIS--but the recipe is great and worth the work.

I had fresh tarragon and was out of fresh thyme so I used it instead of going to the store. We've had a terribly hot summer so this salad was really refreshing. I'll be making it again on another hot day but next time I'll use thyme.

I really like the combination of flavors in this dish. I could not find serrano chiles so I used jalapenos instead. Also, after pickling the watermelon rind, I cut it into a fine julienne and then only used a small amount because I thought the flavor was too strong. The first time I made it I stacked the watermelon as indicated, but while the architecture is dramatic, it had to be disassembled to eat. So the second time, I arranged the watermelon slices (about 1 inch thick quarter rounds) on a bed of arugula that had been tossed in the vinaigrette, then sprinkled all with the feta, chiles, and more vinaigrette. I don't think my guests were as crazy about it as I was.

Definitly a summer keeper.Turned out much better than I expected; liked it and made it a 2nd time. Excellent blend of flavors and textures, and the color plus presentation drew kudos. It is a fair amount of work. Saved some effort by cutting Watermelon in half (either way) then into 1.5 - 2 inch slices. Cut the flesh from rind, set aside, took a potato peeler and peeled from INSIDE the rind, never touching the outer skin. As to presentation, I covered a large (black) flat plate w/mixed chopped/torn lettuce and arugala, Lightly drizzled all w/vinaigrette and tossed. Cut watermelon slices into 1.5-2" cubes, tossed on top and sprinkled about 1/2C Feta. Drizzled a bit more vinaigrette. Served as a single dish salad with a large serving spoon w/remaining vinaigrette on the side.

This is a fun dish for the palate - you have the sweet of the melon, the salt of the feta (I think goat cheese isn't salty enough for this dish - my opinion), the heat of the chile, the sour of the vinagrette, and the bitter of the rind (using a peeler makes nice thin slices that easily soft to a nice consistency in the rice vinegar). Make sure to slice the melon thin, though, or your stack tip over very easily.

This makes a very refreshing lunch or starter on a hot day. I used fresh goat cheese, which has more flavour, and set the melon pieces side by side instead of stacking them. The vinaigrette is ok, but the pickle flavourless and too hard. Next time I'll add more seasoning (mustard seed, coriander seed?)and stew the peel for a while.

This is a great recipe for people interested in Ayurveda cooking. It's basic and inexpensive to make.

to the reviewer from Portugal; a serrano chile is just another type of chile. Same general shape as a jalepeno but much narrower and usually shorter. similar heat to a jalepeno, you could probably substitute thai chiles for the serrano.

Could anybody please explain what serrano chilli is?? I live in Europe, and I know serrrano ham and chilli, but I have never heard of serrano chilli. Can it be substituted by anything else? Otherwise I think this recipe sounds just great!

I haven't made this yet, but it sounds great. For a simple treat with less preparation, just try cut watermelon with a heap of firey tomato and jalapeno salsa on top.

This is a very refreshing salad. I did use fresh mint in place of the thyme. I served it with grilled lamb skewers. Excellent.

Well worth the effort--an intriquing blend of textures and flavors. To Margaret of Toronto: Why don't you try a recipe before you decide it's not worthwhile. You might be surprised!

We are in the process of moving so I'll have to wait to make this but it sounds fabulous - the sweet watermelon, bitter arugula,creamy feta and (my favorite) pickled rind. I may purchase prepared rind to cut down on the work but I can't wait to make this.

I know we arent supposed to write when we havent made the recipe but I had to reply......I made a similar recipe w/watermelon and feta and it was wonderful everyone was surprised at how good it was and refreshing! Try it!

I'm inclined to agree with Margaret from Toronto. Too much fiddling. And watery watermelon with watery feta? We can do a lot better with a different melon and cheese.

haven't made this either, the idea of watermelon with spices sounds good but the cheese? if anyone does this please let us know how it came out.

I am curious to see who would go through all the fuss to make this "salad". Seems like an awful lot of work and I'm not so sure I want feta cheese with watermelon.
