I make this frequently and often tweak it. It's simple and flavorful. I am pretty sure one man (the right man) fell in love with me over this dish. I'm making it for him again right now. This time with pancetta.

This was fantastic. Howerver, made the following changes: Rubbed meat with garlic before browing. Browned a little flour with butter and oil and added to onion mixture to give the broth a little more substance. After the meet was cooked, removed excess fat, and in a blender blended the onions and juice together to give the broth more substance. Really good!

This dish worked out wonderfully. I made only half the recipe, since I was only serving two. The only thing I added was some sliced carrots, and served with mashed potatoes. The lamb was so moist and falling off the bone. Absolutely delicious!

Made with local boneless leg of lamb. Did it all in one pot (much easier) and baked it instead. Pureed the sauce, then reduced and glazed lamb with it when i rewarmed in oven. OMG - the gravy was rich and wonderful.

the lamb shanks were fine (if a bit much per person) but I want to rate the root vegetable mash. It is sensational! I used baking potatoes, turnips and parsnips and instead of cream I added the olive oil. This is now my go to recipe, 1000 times better than plain old mashed potatoes.

Simply the best. That's all there is to say. And it's a show stopper too on the plate! Don't know how you can go wrong with this especially if you cook everything very slowly.

Simply delicious! I had a version of this in a restaurant and had to make it at home. I found this on Epicurious and decided to try it out and glad I did.

First time I made as written and it was good...but this time I caramelized the onions and shallots on the stove and browned the shanks on the stove, otherwise dumped everything in the crock pot and cooked on low for 4 hours then high for 2 hours. Transferred liquid to a blender and pureed the sauce (onions and all) be careful blending hot liquid!!!...wow, the flavor was amazingly deeper pureed then as written. Love this recipe!

Kind of bland. I added sauteed onions, shallots and garlic but it needed help.

I fixed this for my very picky husband last night and found the dish bland. I wonder if my "lamb shanks" were really mutton shanks..because it took so long for the meat to become tender. I used 3 very large shanks. I also tried the polenta with sage as a previous cook had done..overall, most of the dish ended up in the trash. After reading all the glowing comments..I really wonder what went wrong..I used a high end red wine in the recipe and added some garlic, but otherwise followed it to the letter. All I can figure is that the shanks were less than the best. Osso Bucco is one of our favorites..and the veal shanks are always tiny..next time I go to my locally owned grocery store, I will ask the meat man how big lamb shanks can be...I am wondering if the store chain I bought them from are selling shanks from full grown sheep..altho they were marked lamb shanks.

Incredible! I served the shanks with the Bacon and Sage Polenta (recipe in Epicurious) and wilted swiss chard instead of the root vegetable mash. Also added a couple of smashed cloves of garlic to the braise. Used organic lamb shanks so my braise time ended up being 3 hours. The shanks were tender, but for that perfect, falling off the bone unctiousness,probably 4 hours. This would be a great make-ahead dish for a dinner party if you're busy. Will be making this time and time again.

Made this last Sunday in the crock pot. I braised/carmelized everything as in the recipe and then threw it all in the crock pot on high for about 4 hours and it was fantastic. My husband loved it. I'm not always a lamb fan, but I could have eaten it all myself. The sauce was great.

Rating: 4
This was an easy, very tasty and incredible recipe. My husband raved that this was the best lamb shank recipe of all time. Even more memorable and tasty than his favorite lamb dinner in Paris! I prepared as stated in the recipe, with the exception of cooking it a little bit longer. This recipe is nothing short of fabulous and with the mash, is the perfect dinner with a bottle of nice red wine. I highly recommend this dish.

This was my first try at lamb shanks and I'm in love with this recipe! I had leftover wine and used more than the recipe called for, as well as double the tomato paste. I also put diced celery and carrots into the sauce after braising the shanks for about an hour. It turned out fantastic! The leftovers were even better. There was quite a bit of fat, so next time I'll make it a day ahead. But all in all, a top notch recipe.

Rating: 4
This is, hands down, one of my favorite recipes. It's easy to make and is consistently delicious. I've also made it even easier by cooking red potatoes, parsnips, and carrots with the lamb to shave off some work (add them in about an hour before the lamb is done). You can also substitute pot roast for lamb which is delicious. I would especially recommend it if you're having a dinner party because it's essentially a one-pot dish and will give you more time to socialize with your guests. And the leftovers are divine.

Made this for dinner tonight. I had put the caramelized onions and lamb shanks in a slow cooker. Followed the instructions until it came to adding the tomato paste. I didnt have any in the cupboard and couldnt be bothered going to the store, so I used a pasta sauce instead (tomato, garlic and mushroom) instead. Added this to the beef stock and red wine (a quaffable Shiraz) and reduced it by a third then added it to the lamb shanks. It took maybe 30 minutes to prepare, I then cooked it in the slow cooker all day. The meat was so tender, melt in your mouth. Served it with mashed potatoes and steamed string beans. The first time I made this recipe I followed it to the letter and it was yummy. Dont know if it was the wine or pasta sauce, but this way it was absolutely superb and I will cook it this way in the future.

If you follow my changes, this will be the BEST lamb shank recipe you will ever make. I have been cooking lamb shanks for 17 years and this is the winner. After caramelizing and removing the onions, add 1/2 cup each of diced celery and carrots. Add 1/3 cup of red wine to deglaze and clean the pot and set aside the celery and carrots with the carmelized onions. Proceed with browning the lamb as directed and follow the recipe, but also add 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper,1-2 tsp of powdered ancho chili powder, 3 cups of whole shitake or porcini mushrooms, and 16 oz of pureed tomato. I also increased the amount of wine to fill the pot and cover the shanks. I ALSO LEFT THE MEAT TO MARINATE OVERNIGHT in the cooled liquid. I put it in a slow cooker for 8 hours or in the oven at 320 F for about 4 hours the next day. I made this wit the horseradish mashed root vegetables and followed that recipe but used the ricer to remove the tough parts of the parsnip/turnips. I have never had better comments about this dish, melt in your mouth delicious. Be sure to cook for over 3 hours and keep the lambs in liquid. I served this after a stacked salad of beets. stems and tops (each cooked separately), boiled and thinly sliced covered with a shallot-red wine vinegar/olive oil dressing topped with crumbled feta cheese and freshly ground pepper.

Well worth the time to let the lamb shanks become melt-in-mouth tender. I cooked them for 3 hours and reduced the sauce. Next time I make this it will be with polenta. This dish was an excellent on our snowy Easter.

Rating: 2
I didn't have enough liquid to cover 6 shanks, so I had to use only 4. This may be my fault, however, becuase I only have a stock pot, as opposed to a duch oven. Overall, I thought that this recipe was good, but the lamb shanks with rosemary from this site are much, much better. That recipe calls for veggies in the sauce, which makes for a more rich, complex sauce.

I have a couple of go to lamb shank recipes but thought I would try something new. Wow, am I glad I did. This was super easy and so good that I have made it numerous times always to rave reviews and "can I have this recipe?" I do serve it with creamy polenta which is great. Best made the day before, skim the fat and reheat.

Fantastic recipe- Before writing this review, I had to send this recipe to everyone of my 13 guests. I made this for a dinner party of 13, doubled the recipe plus the extra lamb shank. The only thing left on the plates were the cleaned off bones! I did make it ahead and lifted off the fat before reheating. Cooked it a bit longer- closer to 4 hours total - reheating for 1 hour on low flame before serving. Skimmed the top to eliminate the additional fat. The vegetable mash is perfect with it and easy to make. My husband is already wanting to know when I will make it again!

Rating: 4
This was sensational! I heeded the advice of other reviewers and simmered the shanks for about 2-1/2 hours covered and about 40 minutes uncovered to thicken the sauce. The meat was meltingly tender and the sauce was fabulous. We had it with mashed potatoes and oven-roasted carrots and it was a perfect cold-weather comfort-food meal.

I thought the lamb shanks were quite good, but my husband wasn't v. impressed - until, 2 days later, when we split the leftover one! It was fabulous, the flavors were very rich. I'm going to make them again, cooking them 2 days in advance. I didn't make the roasted mash, not a dish my family will eat.

Rating: 3
Excellent! My first time making lamb shanks and they turned out better than a $25 plate at a pricey restaurant. I used only 2 shanks and almost the full amount of sauce, so, if making the full recipe, you might want to increase the liquid. I also added dried woodear mushrooms during the last 30 min for extra flavor and substance. I didn't make the mash, but rather served with a creamy polenta.

I actually made this recipe when it first appeared over 5 years ago, and the raves over the root mash from my family were amazing - a nice alternative from polenta, mash potatoes, rice or noodles, all delicious choices. I rate this now, after all these years, cause I was looking for the root mash recipe and came across this. Give the mash a chance! As for the lamb - I try every lamb shank recipe that you publish - while I agree longer cooking is the answer, I recall this being wonderful - I am going out to buy lamb shanks for Sunday dinner and will serve with root mash!!

Rating: 2
What a rediculous recipe! The point of having shanks of any sort is to slow roast them to the point that they fall off the bone with tenderness and are saturated with the flavors of the sauce. Where is the flavor and cooking time here? I'd START with some garlic and some herb. I like to sneak in chopped cabbage. You do not know it is there but it adds richness and sweetness. Toss these shanks in the oven and let them cook all day on a lower temp. Forget the nasty root mash and whip up some homey mashed potatoes (salt/pepper/butter/milk).

Rating: 4
I must agree; very tasty. If you are like me, and didn't have time to make the root mash, you could always whip up some medium to wide egg noodles and place the shank and it's sauce over them. Delish! I, too, cooked the shanks longer, maybe twice as long. The meat jumps off the bone, baby! Very easy to make, too. Especially nice if you can do it ahead of time. then you just reheat, have a nice dinner, and no mess to clean.

Rating: 4
This is delicious. The shanks I used were quite large, so I increased the cooking time - about an hour longer. The meat was tender and succulent. The only other change I made was straining the sauce at the end. The onions and shallots were like mush, so I didn't think they would add anything to the dish. I served over pureed califlower. Delish.

Rating: 4
I turned this into a lamb stew by cooking this long enough for the meat to fall off the bone. (This method allows you to serve more than the suggested 6 and still have plenty of food.) Sauce is great. Served over mashed potatoes and parsnips rather than root mash suggested here. Sprinkled with fresh parsley for presentation. Also freezes well!

This is a truly fantastic recipe. I wouldn't change a thing. If you don't serve it with either French bread or mashed potatoes/turnips, you are doing yourself, the lamb, and your guests a great disservice! The sauce is TOO good to waste!! (This recipe also works great with a beef roast in the oven.)

Excellent! Fabulous dinner party fare - presentation AND it's make ahead. I made this for a dinner party of 8 using 1# shanks. I 'browned' the shanks in a 450 convection oven for 30 minutes turning once. Then braised the shanks for 2 1/2 hours a day before the party. A few hours before guests arrived I skimmed the fat off the top, removed the shanks, boiled the liquid but it didn't thicken so I used flour to thicken, returned the shanks to the liquid and refrigerated. I put the pot in a 350 oven 1 1/2 hours before dinner and finished heating on the cooktop for 30 minutes. Couldn't be easier and I got to socialize. Be sure and make the Potato & Root Vegetable mash - I made that ahead too, mashing with some butter and fat-free half & half. Served this with Grilled Mushroom and Asparagus Salad. Everyone raved!!

I must say this recipe came out better than I expected it to. I followed it exactly with the recommendation of other reviewers to add garlic.My mom really enjoyed it a great deal. As for the root mash I must say it was gross. This was the first time I had eaten parsnips and its a veg you must have an acquired taste for. I'll make this dish again but may-b with just potatoes or rice

This is a very good recipe although there was so much gravy left over - way too much to use with the leftovers - seemed a shame. Flavors were good, although a a couple of cloves of garlic added to the braising liquid might be in order. Like another reviewer, I too braised this a half hour longer than the recipe called for.

This is a keeper. I "practiced" on my poor, willing husband again in preparation for an upcoming dinner party and he loved it. The only thing I added was some cottage bacon pieces which I browned before doing the onions and shallots. I skipped the mash and served creamy herb polenta with gruyere cheese.

Just made this for a celebratory dinner--wow. So much rich flavor in the meat, the sauce, and the mash. And the recipe isn't at all difficult. It needs attention at the start (chopping, browning) and a bit at the end (reducing and adjusting the sauce) but the middle of recipe (braising) requires no attention at all. I had to substitute turnips for rutabagas (none available), which gave the mash a pretty pale yellow color. I also gave the shanks an extra hour to melt, because I like braises to just fall apart. I'd recommend leaving the shanks on a simmer for even longer if you have the time to spare. Given enough time the cartilage around the joints will melt into the sauce and give it great flavor and gorgeous glossy body. We're going to have this again this weekend, and I'd definitely make it for company. Yum.

I made this dish for a dinner party of 8 (8 shanks), which was well managed with two dutch ovens going on the stove together. In addition I made a green bean salad w/ wild mushrooms and goat cheese and roasted red pepper soup. The guests seemed to enjoy it the array of flavors on an early fall afternoon. The sauce was great, I don't know if I'll make the dish again, simply because there are so many recipes to try.

I made this recipe on New Year's Eve. It was a great way to end the millenium! It was easy to make and tasted wonderful. My only problem was that the sauce didn't reduce enough after the prescribed amount of time. It neede about another 45 minutes to reach its full potential.

Really a fantastic dish, this recipe is perhaps one of my favorite lamb dishes. Very simple to prepare and the leftovers are even better the next day. I love to cook this for guests or just for myself. The dish is very easy to half for smaller servings.
