I tend to use a LOT of kosher salt in my cooking, but I found this sauce inedible when made as the recipe is written. I had to cut it by adding the juice of two lemons (all I had), about 1/3 cup fresh orange juice, several tablespoons more olive oil, some honey, and a few dried figs (chopped in food processor). Much improved. Grilled the lamb outdoors. Next time I'll make a highly modified version of this sauce and, as another reviewer suggested, use it as a marinade.

Easy and tasty. I added just a little garlic and rosemary to the herb/lemon mixture. Will make again.

I missed the garlic called for in a traditional Salmoriglio Sauce, but this was light and delicious! Beautiful with the lamb and I will try it with swordfish next.

GREAT! EASY! I just made the sauce in a blender jar. After I made it I realzed that I had tried this sauce while in Italy but, never knew the name or exactly what was in it... just knew it was delicious! I will definately make this often!

Absolutely delicious!! Used the bbq and grilled zucchini slices basted with garlic oil at the same time. Sprinkled feta on the zucchini, sauce on the chops and with crusty bread had a perfect meal.

excellent sauce which I will dontinue to make. Tasted great with the lamb, but would likely work well with many other grilled meats and vegetables.

Use this site often but this is first time to write review. This sauce is fantastic!! Followed recipe exactly as written and only thing I will change in future is to double it. Served sauce with grilled lamb chops, roasted vegetables (eggplant, zucchini, red peppers and onions with olive oil and fresh rosemary) and couscous cooked in porcini mushroom broth. Our son mopped up last drops of sauce with bread. If you don't already have an herb bed, this sauce is reason enough to put one in!

So simple and so tasty. Definitely a keeper. Good for company despite its simplicity.

I've been making this for several years, the sauce is nice and fresh-tasting with the lamb. You may want to start with about half the specified amount of salt and then add more, the full amount tastes pretty salty to me. Don't bother making it without the fresh herbs.

I made this for my wife and some friends and they all loved it!

The sauce is very different and upon first bite wasn't crazy about it, but that was only for an instant. It really grew on us and I definitely would make it again.

Well, I didn't have lemon juice, so I added a little red wine vinegar instead. And I also added rosemary -- lamb and rosemary love each other! And what self-respecting Mediterranean would not add some garlic? I spread half the sauce on the lamb before grilling, and the other half after grilling. Magnifico!

Wow -- this is a brilliant. What a super summer dish! Don't usually serve bread with dinner (high on the carb list), but definitely made the exception here. The sauce is too good to waste. Can't wait to make again!

I had to use dried oregano and used the salmoriglio sauce as a marinade for the lamb(instead of serving it spponed over the lamb). I marinated the lamb for about 30 minutes and grilled as directed. Before serving, sprinkled the lamb w/ some feta. Delicious!

Beautifull.

I served the salmoriglio sauce over grilled marlin instead of lamb chops. It was very good, but maybe just a little too salty for my taste.

Made with dried herbs on the spur of the moment and sauce was still delicious; bet it's great with the fresh ones. Due to my weak hand, also changed the recipe by making the sauce in a mini food processor with no problems.
