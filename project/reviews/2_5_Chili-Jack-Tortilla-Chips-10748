I like to make these with homemade corn tortillas. Try it, it's easy and delicious! Easiest way to coat the tortillas well with as little oil as possible is to slice the tortillas, put them in a plastic bag, add the (olive) oil, close the bag and mix them around until coated. Sometimes I sprinkle with Cajun salt and serve with a sesame bean dip. Yum.

This is a very easy way to impress your guests with little effort- making your own tortilla chips that is. They tasted great. Serve fresh out of the oven with salsa and guacamole or use to make nachos. Cut tortillas with kitchen scissors.

I've been making these for years and think they're great -- tasty, quick and easy. Also, if you have spices on hand, the tortillas and cheese are easily picked up in the supermarket case. I suggest using a good quality chili powder, and I like sea salt. I usually bake them for only 5-6 minutes until the cheese has thoroughly melted. I've tried hot pepper jack which is a kicker!

This is simple to make, but not sure they are worth eating. Definitly would need to be used with something else such as guacamole as they are not really that tasty by themselves.

Very tasty appetizer. Served with guacamole also and was a big hit. Just didn't have enough.
