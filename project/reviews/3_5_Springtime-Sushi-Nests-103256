I made this dish for dinner, hoping to have the leftovers for lunch the next day. It was so delicious that we ate all of it (2 adults & 1 kid) - good thing I made the full amount. Not exactly a quick weeknight dinner but it's easy to prepare. Omitted the shrimp (made it into tempura instead as go-with). Along with the eggplant salad with miso ginger dressing (on this site) it was a wonderful meal.

This was an excellent light supper for a summer evening. It did take a little time, but was not difficult to prepare, and well worth the wait. I cooked the carrots and mushrooms in miso with bonito flakes in place of dashi, and it took much longer to reduce the broth than the recipe indicated. Also, I used blanched green beans and sugar snap peas instead of asparagus. I left out the bamboo, since I didn't have any on hand. I doubt it would serve six though. Three servings might be a better estimate. (There were only two of us, and we nearly finished all of it!)

Took a bit of time, but it was worth it. A very different rice dish, and it tasted very much like the sushi rice I've had out.
