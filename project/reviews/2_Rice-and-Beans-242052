Boil in bag rice??? Are you serious? You might as well eat the cardboard box that it came out of because it is going to taste exactly the same. This is what you would call the best of the "lazy". It does not even deserve to be posted!

Very bland recipe. I added some white wine vinegar and fresh oregano, increased the salt, garlic. It came out a little better with the modifications. When I usually make a rice and beans dish I make the rice separately in a rice cooker. I would not make this again.
