This is great! Polenta is nit "bland" if you use good quality parmesan.Amount of garlic is perfect

Every time that I make these they are very well received. They are so easy to make and look stunning. I usually make these the day before and top them with the basil mayonnaise right before presentation. I have even had caterers ask me for the recipe! I have not changed - or experimented - with this recipe in any way, as I find it perfect as is. This is one of my "go to" appetizer recipes.

I loved the idea of this, but thought it needed some changing, as I was making this. I used less garlic as reviewers suggested. Added some herbs and lemon to them. I'm thinking if I do it again I might first sea-salt lightly, add some white basamic vinegar and olive oil and let them sit at least 1/2 hour... For the polenta, I used veggie broth and herbs .. it definately needs some seasoning or it would be totally bland. I tried it without the Basil mayo but, in the end thought it needed "something" so I made it as written ... still needed something so, I added some cream cheese and salt and pepper.. was much better! Also, I realized I only had one mini- muffin tin (12) so I rolled the cooled polenta into balls and placed then on top of the open butterflied tomato "flower" then flipped it over and shaped it a bit putting it on pachement paper. This actually worked well because they were not as slippery as the ones in the muffin tin. In addition, they did seem "slimy" (not an attactive texture) so I put them in a 450 oven for 10min on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet which helped dry them out.. In the end they were very good. It really wasn't all that hard but, my discription probably sounds like it. Just turned out to be a work in progress!

These are definitely tasty and beautiful. I skipped the basil mayonnaise, intending to use a dab of pesto on each tartlet. In the end, I skipped the pesto as well because the marinated tomatoes are soooo garlicky. I also had a shortage a polenta; I used a 24-count mini-muffin pan and was only able to fill 21 muffin cups with the polenta recipe provided. Next time I make these, I'll make sure to scoop only tomato into the muffin cups (no garlic), make more polenta, and warm the tartlets slightly before serving (or maybe even pan-fry them so the bottoms are crispy).

These are absolutely adorable and very tasty! I made them for a luncheon and they were a hit. You don't even really need the mayo. I marinated the cherry tomatoes a little longer than the recipe stated, and I thought they would make an excellent salad, served on a bed of butter lettuce.

This was very pretty, easy to make, and a rave with guests. I took the suggestion of other reviewers and butterflied the tomatoes, and made the polenta with chicken broth for more flavor. I also recommend thoroughly draining and perhaps patting the tomatoes dry after they have marinated in the olive oil because the oil "residue" on the tartlets make them slippery to hold and eat. Next time I may put a quarter teaspoon of pesto in the base of the butterflied tomatoes, once they are in the muffin pan.

Thought this was a wonderful dish!!! I used chix broth instead of h2o and loved the flavor it added to the polenta. A wonderful use of cherry tomatoes, will be making it again!!!

I thought this was a great recipe - I served the tarts on top of butter lettuce that had an olive oil dressing. It was a deliciously different first course - much more interesting than a plain salad.

I just loved the appearance of this dish and had to try it first chance I got. I did do something differently though. Maybe my cherry tomatoes were very large, but after I butterflied them and put them in the muffin tin, there wasn't much room. So I filled them lightly (you could see the edges of the tomato cuts) and they looked so pretty! Also they were easier to eat by picking them up from the bottom (tomato) side. Upside down worked great! I used cornmeal and was happy to spend half the time stirring and the results were custardy and perfect.

this appetizer will surely impress. beautiful presentation, particularly if the tomatoes are butterflied and put cut side down in the cups. they appear as pretty flowers on top when unmolded. skipped the mayo this time, but will try next time.

what a great idea! i only made the polenta cups for a make-ahead side dish and they were lovely. i made the polenta with 1 c. half and half and 2 c. water for each cup of polenta, with one T. honey and one t. salt. they were awesome! at the end of the cooking, i added a tablespoon or two of butter, and thought it really made the flavor perfect. this was all very easy, and the tartlets were so easy to handle.

This is a wonderful starter. But I did vary the recipe quite a bit. For the polenta, I used 2 cups water but then used half a cup of chicken broth, added garlic, herbs, a splash of blush wine... replaced the cheese and butter with olive oil. The polenta was so flavorful that I skipped the mayonaise altogether. I spooned the polenta into the muffin pan and then put the quartered the cherry tomatoes on top. Then I baked it for ten minutes. It's nice and toasted-- keeps the shape, no droopy, soggy tomatoes and no tricky removal of the tartlets. EXCELLENT!

I made this last summer for a Shakespeare in the park picnic, when I had a bumper crop of basil, and loved them. Now I am making a holiday version, with bits of green peppers with the red tomatoes for a festive touch!

The zip and tang from the lemon and garlic truly made this magnificent. I served this as a main course for two of us so I cut the recipe in half -- next time I would make the full recipe and have some nice leftovers. Since it just the girlfriend and myself we took the dish down a notch on the fancy scale by serving the polenta warm on a plate instead of shaped. A good time saver. Enjoyed thoroughly.

This is a great recipe. I, however, used homemade basil mayonnaise (oil, egg, lemon juice, garlic, and basil). The garlic was overkill with the rest of the dish, but the mayo was excellent, and may be a good remedy for those who found the recipe too bland. However, if you are going to use a garlicky mayo, don't use garlic in the tomatoes - it was too much, even for this garlic lover.

i've made this twice for company now, the first time with tiny sun gold tomatoes from our garden, which worked beautifully; the 2nd time with larger red cherry tomatoes, which i had to place on top, which was fine, too. but i put juice from garlic and tomatoes in bottom of muffin pans, which helped with unmolding, too. quartering tomatoes seemed ridiculous so i didn't cut them all the way through, sort of butterflied them four ways, which worked well. these were a hit at both dinner parties, but yes, very messy to eat. i didn't bother with basil mayonnaise the 2nd time; i agree that it didn't seem that special--maybe next time i'll try the basil vinaigrette that went with stuffed tomatoes in same issue, which was great. but garlic in the recipe was a plenty wonderful kick. quite a nice appetizer for when our garden is kicking out the cherry tomatoes.

I made these for a small dinner party - I agree with another reviewer - they were a little slippery to pick up with your fingers - solved that with little forks and saucers. All 24 were eaten very quickly, and I lot lots of raves on them. The Basil Mayonnaise needed something else - It was OK, but no great shakes. You could do some fun things with the tomatoes (Maybe a few flakes of red pepper, or finely minced basil added to the polenta at the very end of cooking.

Loved all the flavors. A bit big for a one bite appetizer. Don't let them sit much longer than recommended.

Maybe it was something I did, but the texture of the polenta just turned us off. Perhaps I didn't get it thick enough? The flavors were good though.

Delicious. Mine were a bit slippery when you picked them up to eat. Maybe a little too much liquid from the tomatoes? Still definitely worth making.

Very good, but time consuming. Looks great on plate.

I thought this was terrific!I brought this to a party and everyone oohed and aahed over it. I loved that you could make it ahead of time. The most time consuming part was cutting the tomatoes into quarters. I would imagine you could experiment using some other cheeses in the polenta. I look forward to making this again.
