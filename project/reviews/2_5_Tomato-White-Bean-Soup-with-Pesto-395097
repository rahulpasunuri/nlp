Basic, hearty soup that my son (a fussy eater) enjoyed. Good way to get some vegetables into a kid ... and, it's cheap. Will definitely make again. Used regular store-bought pesto and swirled it directly into the pot of soup.

Made this for a vegetarian friend and her non-vegetarian husband. All four of us thought it was totally tasteless with a rather thick consistency which was not pleasing. I made double the pesto, but even that didn't help.

This was good. Flavorful, heartier than a regular tomato soup, and easy. Took one fork off for the walnut-based pesto. I generally don't like walnuts, so perhaps those who do like walnuts would disagree. I could really taste the bitterness of the walnut skins in the pesto - next time I'll be making it with pine nuts and Parmesan. But overall a solid recipe.
