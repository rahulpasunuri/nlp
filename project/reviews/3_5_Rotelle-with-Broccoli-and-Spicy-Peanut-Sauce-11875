Sorry, didn't like this at all, the sauce was far too cloying.

Had to register just to review this recipe. I loved it! Like other reviewers suggested I added fresh chopped ginger and subbed red pepper flakes for the cayenne. I also omitted the w orcestershire sauce. This was fabulous and really easy. Will definitely be making this again.

Good, unique recipe. I did add grated ginger and more red pepper. Love the red pepper/broccoli combo.

I followed others' suggestions and added fresh ginger and a half teaspoon of red pepper flakes instead of the cayenne. I used three tablespoons of crunchy peanut butter and one of tamari and made it with brown rice fusilli. Delicioso!

It is unusual to find recipes where I already have all ingredients on hand, but this one fit the bill. The only changes that I made were to add 1 small carrot (sliced), and some grated ginger to the sauce. This one is a keeper, easy & tasty one pot meal, great for a busy weekday.

A very easy dish that's very delicious. I added fresh grated ginger, grated carrots to the sauce and reduced the peanut butter to 3 TBs and only cooked 3 oz of pasta for 2 servings (watching calories) but the rest I followed the recipe. I upped the cayenne pepper because I love me some spiciness. I mixed some frozen broccoli and frozen brussels sprouts into the pasta and also added roasted red pepper and it all turned extremely good. I wanted to go for seconds!

Simple and delicious, I added 1\4 teaspoon of chili paste. Next time I would make more sauce or less pasta.

This was delicious. I have made a couple of similar recipes, none as good as this. After reading the reviews I doubled up the spices and added fresh ginger. I think next time I will serve it with toasted ground peanuts over top, and if you really wanted some kind of meat, grilled prawns would be really good.

I added some sesame oil to the sauce and some ground ginger (fresh would been better). Use equal parts broccoli & whole wheat pasta and you can call it a healthy meal!

This was a very simple, delicious weeknight recipe. I did not have cayenne, but added a bit of red pepper flakes. I also added some slivered almonds on top-yumm. Will add sliced green onion and perhaps carrots next time. Many variations would work.

I've been making this since it first appeared in print (1993), and enjoy it as much as the first time, every time.

I liked this! I think I would like to try it with coconut milk instead of water next time. I doubled the sauce and marinated some tofu in it overnight.

This turned out really good! I used coconut milk instead of water, also added some cashew butter, cinnamon, and cardamon. At the last I added some red chili flakes to give it a bit of bite.

While I like the sauce, I'm not sure about this recipe. Next time I think I will use the sauce to make a satay instead.

I live in a take-out town and this is the only recipe I make consistently every week! So easy and delicious. I use more Worcestershire and soy sauce than the recipe calls for (to taste) since I found the sauce a little bland the first time. This is also one of those great recipes where the leftovers are just as good!

I rarely give four forks, but this was way beyond all expectation. Not only is it delicious and super-quick to make, it's also so healthy it's hard to believe (low-fat at 27% of calories, and one serving will give you more than twice your daily needs for vitamins A & C and about half your PDA in another 10 nutrients)! I used Thai fish sauce rather than Worcestershire and chunky organic peanut butter (upped the sugar only by 1/4 tsp). The flavor is Chinese, so I certainly see how sliced carrots and/or chicken would be lovely additions. The sauce was plenty as written, but make more if adding the chicken or veggies. I will be making this frequently!

love it! we have been making this for several years now and always add a carrot, thinly sliced and make 1 1/2 x of the sauce. quick,easy and delicious

Rating: 3
Took the advice of others and made 1 1/2 recipes of sauce. Also added some sambal oelek (the thai red chili sauce) to the peanut sauce for extra kick, used lemon juice instead of worcestershire sauce, and topped with slivers of green onion. Also tried to reduce the fat (yeah, right), by using reduced fat peanut butter and added to the laziness factor by using frozen broccoli florets and red peppers. Was pretty good and would make it again!

This is an easy, quick recipe that makes a great weeknight meal. I used an orange pepper instead of a red one, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly and was very happy with the results. I'm going to try it again tonight with some chicken breast added.

Yuck! this wasn't good at all. the ingredients did not marry well at all. waste of broccoli and peanut butter

Rating: 3
I thought this was quite good, and very easy to make. I was making it for a vegan so I left out the Worcestershire sauce, and I used some hot chili oil in addition to the cayenne....make it somewhat spicier although not a whole lot. Served it topped with chopped scallions. Yummy! And it reheated okay too. Oh yeah, I did make 1 1/2 times the recipe as some others recommended and that was a good idea.

I added diced bell pepper and carrots along with the broccoli and served it with brown rice instead of pasta. I added 1/2 tbsp more soy than the maximum in the recipe, and added grated ginger. The worcestershire sounded weird to me so I omitted it and added a dash of lemon juice. This is a good and quick basic recipe that can be changed according to taste and what ingredients are on hand.

I had to pour myself a stiff drink in the middle of this dish due to technical difficulties (my mini food processor broke, the cap came off the soy so I used too much) and it still was very tasty. I was using left over pasta, so I just boiled the veggies and combined with pasta. I think that the fact that i had such troubles and it still tasted good says this is a good basic recipe. I plan on tinkering next time- raw garlic is a more biting than i want, probably will saute or sweat the garlic, might add onions & other veggies. Might add chicken or shrimp for a potluck offering, also adaptable to many veggies. Oh, good call, NY, i added a touch extra sugar since I only had natural pb on hand.

Didn't have worcesteshire & cayenne, so I used about 2t wasabi, and whole wheat spaghetti instead of rotelle. The sauce wasn't impressive for dinner (served hot), but after chilling in the refrigerator over night the whole dish tasted fabulous for lunch (served cold). Will try this again uising worcesteshire and cayenne.

I've been making (and improvising from) this recipe for years. It's a great week-night comfort-food winter dinner.

I liked the broccoli in the peanut sauce. I added carrots and used 1 large red bell pepper for 1 pound of pasta. This peanut sauce is very similar to a chinese one I love. After tasting the sauce without cayenne, I made adjustments. The worchestershire sauce is lost in this, so I'll stick to just soy. I used chili paste in place of cayenne and added 1 bunch of cilantro. I used between 1 and 2 Tablespoons of garlic. My son loves spicy peanut sauce with any noodles - he could skip any kind of veggie - he's out of luck at this house.

Came out bland. Doubled the garlic & cayenne, and added some sesame oil which improved the flavor.

If you like Thai satay, you'll love this sauce. I added some sesame seed oil, and it was extra delicious. Yum-yum!

Delicious and easy to make. I took previous reviewers' suggestions and made 1.5 times the sauce. I also added some carrot rounds to the broccoli and red pepper because the color combination seemed festive. My Dutch partner thought that peanut sauce on pasta was a weird combination, but loved it anyway. Warning: the Worcestershire sauce adds anchovies to this dish, so it's not strictly vegetarian. If you're a strict vegetarian, look for a good substitute for the Worcestershire, because this recipe is worth trying!

Dish was easy to execute -- prepared sauce in a food processor; was out of Worcestershire sauce so substituted Chinese black bean hot sauce. Don't feel it's necessary to prepare extra sauce. There was plenty at the bottom of my bowl at the end of the meal.

This was excellent!! Like the other reviewers, I made more sauce(1 1/2 times the amount) which was perfect. I also added more garlic and added chicken to make it more of a meal. This will be added to our keeper file.

This is a great fast dinner and my kids love it. A word on the sauce; don't use natural peanut butter, buy the sugary stuff(crunchy or creamy)for this sauce. Also, use one and a half times the sauce. This is delicious hot but doesn't make great leftovers, although, chances are you won't have any...

I love this recipe! It's quick and easy, and very tasty. I usually make a little more sauce than the recipe calls for, I use crunchy peanut butter, and I top the dish with thinly sliced green onions. Excellent!

Surprisingly very tasty... perhaps next time I would make a little extra sauce to keep the overall flavors more concentrated.

This is a great dish. Easy to make and very nutritious. I actually heated the peanut sauce before I mixed it with the pasta so as to melt the flavors a bit and take the bite out of the garlic. Be careful not to scorch it though as the sugar in the peanut butter will burn quite easily.

Delicious. We added Carrots too.

Very tasty...I would cut back on the soy sauce a bit, though, and souble the cayenne. I made it with stir-fried beef instead of pasta....terrific!

Quick! Delicious! Very Filling (and I've got a big appetite)! I didn't have soy sauce, so I substituted Vietnamese Fish Sauce and it was great. Took leftovers for lunch - not quite as yummy reheated, but still good.

Delicious, satisfying, and good for guests. Very quick, easy and hearty for a meatless dish. I substitute crushed peanuts and a little oil for some of the peanut butter, which added a nice crunch. I also add 2-3 chopped green onions with the red pepper.

It sounds horrible when you look at the ingredients, but what a pleasant surprise when you taste it! As usual, epicurious comes up with combinations that delight the taste buds. You just have to tell friends to trust that it tastes good. You will get funny looks, but it is delicious and inexpensive! I enjoyed this immensely as did my friends who got the left overs!

This is a scrumptious & quick meatless meal. We make it frequently and guests have loved it.
