This was a great appetizer for Thanksgiving and almost all do ahead. I made the pimento cheese two days ahead, almost doubling the cayenne pepper, and using both aged, white and yellow sharp cheddar. For the bread I used my own home made Artisan bread, thinly sliced, rubbed with garlic and lightly toasted in the oven before spreading with cheese so the bread wouldnt get soggy. Then I broiled the completed toasts as directed. They were gone in a flash! This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Quick & easy, was perfect for Thanksgiving when your busy with so many other dishes. Will add more cayenne and roasted peppers next time, definitely will be making this again.

Didn't rate because I haven't made this specific recipe, but it's similar to what I usually make and love. I do like more cayenne and some worchestershire and green onion. I think the roasted peppers will be a huge improvement on bland pimentos. To the mayo hater, try Veganaise, really good. If it's the texture of mayo that creeps you, maybe try silken tofu or cream cheese? Personally cannot live w/o mayo.

I agree with other reviews that adding more cayenne is essential: I just added to taste (we like things spicy!) We've taken these to 2 social events now and they have been a HUGE hit at each party! They're easy and oh so yummy!!! You know they're awesome when people are "sneaking" mounds of them away! I think that I may play with this a little next time: maybe add some jalepenos!

These were so yummy! My family ate them all up! I did add more cayenne pepper than the recipe suggests. I put in 1/2 a teaspoon! I prefer it spicier!

So yummy and great hot or cold. I agree with the reviewer that said that if the bread is a little stale, even better!

These are so good. . . but if you put too many out your guests won't have room for dinner. . .they are impossible to stop eating.

Very easy, very tasty, and very good! Use a good quality cheddar and make sure you spead the mixture to the very edge of the bread. If the bread is a bit stale, so much the better.

How can you not love this recipe? The cayenne added just enough spiciness and the roasted red peppers not only tasted great but looked so festive. Here is the problem. I HATE mayo. One of my guests hates it as well. Neither of us could fully enjoy the toast knowing mayonnaise was mixed in. What else might I use? Any suggestions?

This is so tasty and incredibly easy. It gets better over time so make it a day ahead. It even tastes good cold spread on crackers. Definite repeat.

I made this once for an Easter brunch and now people beg me to bring it to every potluck. I don't mind because it's so easy to make and is insanely delicious!

I sure am in the minority, but I'm just not a fan of these. My husband and I like each of the ingredients separately, but the combination was a little too heavy for us. They weren't bad - but we didn't love them.

Delicious classic recipe. I always put the mixture in the food processor to give it a smoother texture. That way it's good hot or cold.

Easy and tasty, but for some reason the bread turned out really greasy and mushy.

This is cheesy bread. What is there not to like about that. Next time, I'll increase the amount of peppers (maybe double) and increase the cayenne (again probably double). My guests gobbled them up. Enjoy!

I loved pimento cheese sandwiches when I was a child and this is a great grown-up version. I think most childhood was with Velvetta!! I used half white sharp cheddar and half orange sharp (both aged brands from Sam's) I did increase the amount of roasted red pepper a tad. It was great as the broiled version and very tasty as the standby cold sandwich. Good ingredients in simple combo's are often the best! This one is a great do ahead for any party summer or winter.

A Southern favorite FOREVER. I can't remember a time when there wasn't a tub of Pimento Cheese in the fridge growing up. Homemade is definitely the way to go. Add a couple of dashes of Worcestershire and throw a green onion or two in the Cuisinart when you whiz this up. And if you have Duke's mayonnaise it'll be that much better.

Didn't change a thing in this recipe and they were gobbled up so quickly at my sister's bridal shower. I suggest ensuring the spread is pushed way up to the edge of the bread so that you can broil them a little longer without burning the edges of the bread.

You can change it up by using some garlic salt and/or lots of freshly ground black pepper. play around with it. It's all good!

Yum! Made this for the Kentucky Derby and will definitely make it again for a party. I used half habanero cheddar, half Tillamook sharp yellow cheddar. Doubled (at least!) the cayenne because we like spicy, and used Miracle Whip since we were out of mayo. Delicious and super fast!

Another delicious variation. Try half med to sharp cheddar and half mozzerella. Stir in mayo and pimemto to taste. Add a little dill (fresh or dry) and a little garlic powder. Let sit overnight to allow flavors to blend. Spread on little rye squares. You won't believe how good this is.

Super easy make ahead appetizer. A little effort yields a huge batch. It looks pretty coming out of the oven and you can definitely change it up for different variations. I added a bit of cream horseradish.

This recipe is CRAZY good! I actually use a jar (or two) of pimentos for that special southern flavor. Plus I double the cayenne and they are still not too spicy. Everyone I've served this to has loooooved them.

I made this for a Christmas dinner appetizer. Funny enough, I didn't read the directions through and served this COLD as a spread. It was wonderful! This time I will heat, but don't rule out serving cold too.

I love this recipe. Reminds me of welsh rarebit. Try sprinkling paprika on them when they come out of the oven. A keeper.

These were very yummy! They went fast at a Super Bowl party. Using roasted red pepper really adds to the flavor, but next time I will double the amount.

I dont use mayonnaise for pimento cheese but cream cheese instead. other than that I did it exactly the same and people loved it.

Easy to make, quite tasty - my guests seemed to enjoy this appetizer. As some others suggested, I used 1/2 vintage white extra sharp cheddar (Tillamook), and a generic medium orange sharp cheddar. I only used a dash of cayenne and it gave it plenty of flavor. I'd definitely make it again.

I made these toasts without the cayenne or peppers and used 4 parts sharp cheddar and 1 part Australian Cheddar 18 months aged that I got from Whole Foods. The result was exceptional, but the cheese flavor was very strong, especially for a person like me that usually uses mild cheddar. All in all, this is a great recipe.

Excellent Party Table add on. Try rye toast also.

Great recipe. I doubled the recipe and used half sharp (yellow) and half extra sharp (white). I smeared a large portion of the pimento cheese on some multigrain bread with several slices of smoked ham and then put it in my panni maker. OMG...the cheese melted changing the flavor and texture to this rich, creamy, melted slice of heaven. I ate the panni with onion and tomatoe slices. The best.

So delicious and simple! Everyone devoured them at our cocktail party. I did use white and yellow cheddar as suggested.

My husband really liked this recipe. It is very fast and easy to make. The cayenne pepper gives it a little kick. Overall, the recipe is a nice twist on old favorite.
