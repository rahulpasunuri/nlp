Easy and delicious. The lemon flavor is the perfect foil for the asparagus and pasta and the amount is just right. Halved the recipe and sauted 2 TBS chopped onion and a minced garlic clove. Used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream and made a roux with the butter and a TBS of flour.

I was trying to make this vegan and used Earth Balance and almond milk instead of butter and cream. This makes the sauce too thin so next time I will make a roux with some flour in the E.B. before I add the milk and lemon juice and zest. After melting the e.b. I sauteed some minced garlic. I also didn't have enough lemon so I substituted some of the zest and juice with an orange. This turned out very well! nice and light. Even my 3 year old liked it.

This was very good. Like other reviewers I caramelized onions in some olive oil.This allowed me to reduce the amount of butter, which I added after the onions were gold and translucent.When the butter melted, I added 3 cloves of minced garlic and the blanched asparagus. I reduced the amount of lemon juice and zest, but tasting during cooking, found it to be too sour. So I added a scant sprinkle of sugar. Instead of heavy cream I added two dollops of greek yogurt and stired until it was smooth & heated through. It then got tossed with the pasta( without addtional pasta water) and was served with a sprinkling of toasted pine nuts. A bit hit as a main course

This was SO GOOD and SO EASY. Just got done making it for dinner and can't wait to eat leftovers tomorrow. Followed the recipe to the letter - okay, well except that I let the pasta and asparagus simmer for about 4 mins at the end instead of just 1 min. Served with basic seared chicken breasts on top. This dish almost has a special occasion feel to it for relatively little effort. And I for one had no problem with it being too rich!

haven't given it forks because I changed it a ton. But it was good! Started by frying red onion and garlic in olive oil and then added in some red bell pepper. Finished off in the same way but used less cream and made up the difference with vege stock. Also used basil instead of parsley and didn't have any parmesan...

I'm not normally one to cut or omit the fatty ingredients from a recipe; but I actually tend to agree with previous reviewers on the heavy cream. I used what the original recipe calls for, but next time will cut the cream with some milk - it was really rich. Really yummy! I thought the amount of lemon juice was JUST RIGHT as written, but didn't get the full 2T of zest from my lemons - just put in what I had and it was great.

Couldn't get much better -- very simple & quick to prepare; nice light flavor (although not light in calories). Mixed cream & lemon juice together before adding to melted butter -- sauteed one garlic clove in butter, used thin spaghetti instead of bow-tie -- had no asparagus so used petite peas. Will definitely make again.

Rating: 4
This was delicious. I followed other reviewer's suggestions and used a combination of milk & heavy cream, mixed in the lemon juice and zest before heating, and started the sauce by heating butter with garlic. This was an easy recipe to make, and tastes so good. Definitely something I will pull out for those special occasions.

This recipe is amazing. Though I'm shocked no one has mentioned the one protein accompaniment that is so perfect for it - scallops! We seared a few and served them on the side with this and it was SCRUMPTIOUS. I followed some of the other reviewers suggestions and sauteed some shallots in the butter first, cut the heavy cream with skim milk and added the lemon stuff before I put it in the pan (still just as tasty), cut out the parsley (but it would have been good with it), cut down on the pasta (we didn't need that many carbs) and you don't need nearly the amount of zest suggested (really, a tsp or two is plenty). I also added some snap peas and a little red pepper flake for kicks and it turned out sooo great!!

This is a really good, easy recipe. I was sure the sauce would curdle, but the butter prevents that. I make a half recipe, and it's enough for two dinners and two leftover lunches. I like it with gemelli rather than farfalle.

hunting4aveggie says asparagus is better by itself. I agree, and add: What's wrong with the lemon pasta by itself, without the complication of the asparagus? In general, note what the Italians eat: Simple, uncomplicated pastas, without all of the extras that clog up most of these pasta recipes.

Very tasty. I also sauteed one shallot in the butter before I added the lemon. For the herbs I also added fresh thyme and mint because I had some. Fantastic spring dish.

I only made 2 changes: 1) put some freshly shelled peas in a bamboo steamer on top of pot for the last few minutes of the pasta cooking, then added peas to the dish (yum) and 2) as mentioned in some earlier reviews i added the lemon juice and zest before heating cream and butter, and had no problem with curdling. Either way, this is a fantastic dish-great as a vegetarian entree or side dish with fish. This will become one of my springtime staples.

Rating: 4
This recipe is fantastic. I received some green garlic in my CSA box along with my asparagus so I sauteed that in the butter before adding the rest of the sauce ingredients. I steamed the asparagus over the pasta and used fresh pasta - added a tiny pinch of crushed red pepper at the end. I can tell this recipe is good as written but since all of these changes made the dish heavenly I plan to repeat them. As usual with simple recipes like this - be sure to use the best ingredients possible.

I have made this recipe many, many times, and I know that I'll continue making it at least once a month. It is easy to make and the ingredients and proportions are easy to remember. Nowadays, I almost always omit the butter and add the asparagus to the boiling pasta 2-3 minutes before it is ready. So easy and yummy!

I haven't made this exact recipe, but i've made a similar one. An alternative way to get the lemon flavor in is to put a few large pieces of lemon rind (careful to cut off the pith) in the cream as it's simmering. Then you remove them. It gives a subtle lemon flavor without the zest, and without thinning the sauce with the lemon juice.

I've made this twice so far, and I was afraid I curdled the milk the first time, but it turned out all the zest just made it look lumpy. I actually did the second time around, but since it was just for me and DH, I took a whisk to it and it tasted fine. For reheating leftovers, I added a little milk to revive the sauce.

I made this last night and paired it with lemon pepper marinated Salmon and a green salad and I swear the meal was like a high end restaurant meal. My new husband moaned several times and told me what a great cook I was several times. Next time and there WILL BE a next time (after his reaction), I will add some garlic. It was perfectly lemony, and I didn't need to add any water at the end. I used linguine because I think it's more elegant than bow tie pasta. I steamed the asparagus. I am a novice cook but my husband thinks I'm a pro, because I make recipes off of this site. Hey, if you can read, you can make this too. I think milk would be just fine if you don't have cream.

Rating: 4
Very tasty dish and not difficult at all. I grilled the asparagus on the george foreman (instead of steaming it) with a little olive oil and S&P. Also, I used whole wheat penne, half and half, and basil instead of bow ties, heavy cream, and parsley because that's what I had. Couldn't really taste the basil, so next time I might go with the parsley. Also, I think I cut back on the amount of lemon, but I'm not sure since I was making it only for 2. I used the zest from one lemon and the juice from half a lemon and it came out great. Creamy and a little zingy, but not thick or sharp. Oh, and like others, I didn't use any of the reserve cooking liquid. It didn't need it. I foresee making this more often in the future, maybe adding some peas or another veg.

I made for a potluck on a group camping weekend so I preboiled the pasta. Only added about 3/4 of it because my pan wouldn't hold more. I grilled the asparagus, but otherwise followed recipe. Very easy even under outdoor- campstove conditions and delicious! Went over very well.

This was outstanding. I used tagliatelle since I don't care much for bow-ties, especially in an elegant dish. I didn't think that the sauce needed any pasta water. Just cream and a healthy amount of lemon juice. I used basil instead of parsley. Very nice for company and easy to make.

Thanks to the reviewers,we used the suggested amount of lemon because we like a strong lemon flavor, used light cream instead of heavy cream, added the lemon to the cream before heating so it wouldn't curdle, didn't add pasta water to the sauce,prepared the asparagus and sauce ahead of time, and used less pasta than suggested. Wow, thanks to the many reviews, this dish was very good!

My husband and I enjoyed this dish. I used the amount of lemon that the recipe called for. I thought it was the right amount. I think it would be bland if you used less. I also roasted the asparagus with olive oil and salt. It tasted good with romano cheese and fresh pepper on top. I would not call it a light dish with the heavy cream. However, for something different, it was a nice change.

Sorry, forgot to add: Do not let the sauce boil or even simmer, just heat to steaming and then remove from burner. Curdling can also result from too high a temp.

An excellent pasta dish - like spring on a plate! Make it often and it is always delicious and enjoyed by all. Suggestion to those cooks who reported curdled sauce: Try adding the lemon juice/zest directly to the cold milk or cream before heating rather than adding it later as the recipe directs. Was told by a professional cook many years ago that when milk/cream is heated the structure of the protein in the milk solids changes, so the addition of the lemon then is almost certain to curdle the sauce. Have been following this method ever since with great success. Hope you find this tip helpful. Enjoy!

It was a good and easy sidedish for a large dinner I was making. I had very fresh asparagus [you could almost eat it raw], so I only pan fried it briefly in hot butter. I realized at the last minute I had used all my cream in another dish, so I ended up throwing a lot of fresh ground parmesan in with the pasta. It worked quite well; I'll definitely add it again, tho' I'd like to add the cream also.

I halved the lemon juice and added shallots and garlic per another reviewer's suggestion. I thought it was somewhat bland.

Rating: 3
A couple of suggestions for the fellow members. 1. - Grilled asparagus make it more intense flavour. To grill them easily place 4-5 on 2 skewers; one near the tips and one at the bottom, drizzle with olive oil before grilling. 2. - Use the same pot where you cooked the pasta, return the drain pasta into it and add the sauce, cook at VERY low heat for a minute or so COVERED, serve with the grilled and cut asparagus on top. The lemon intensity can be adjusted to taste when making the sauce. Garlic does add another dimension to this dish, capers can also be added. ENJOY!

This recipe was a lesson learned for me: Next time I'm in a cooking rush, I won't skip all the comments. I missed the suggestions to reduce the lemon, which is too bad, since the lemon amount listed on the original recipe was quite overpowering.

Really good. Took lots of the suggestions from other cooks. Roasted the asparagus instead of steaming, skipped the parsley, started the sauce by sauteeing shallots with butter before adding the cream, and served with sauteed fillet of salmon. It made more than I needed along side the salmon, so I took the leftover salmon, cut it up, and mixed it in with the leftover pasta. Yum! Husband went back for thirds... a sure sign of a winner.

Rating: 3
I used half and half and one small clove of garlic. It is delicious, but when I added the lemon juice to the half and half, it curdled. This made the sauce 'grainy.' Anybody else have this problem? I added some more half and half afterwards to smooth out the texture of the sauce.

Rating: 4
Really delicious! I only made a couiple of modifications ... I left out the parsley (didn't have any), added a couple shakes of red pepper flakes and slightly carmelized 2-3 shallots and a couple of garlic gloves in butter and then added the cream. I also roasted the asparagus instead of steamed it. Oh, and I also added about a teaspoon of sugar to cut the sour aspect of the lemon juice. This would be great with some grilled salmon. This was super quick and super easy and I will definitely make it again.

Rating: 3
Mmmm, delightful. Measurements were approximate as I was only making this for myself; I might have come up a bit short on the lemon. I didn't have asparagus, and used about 1/2 heavy cream and 1/2 half & half. Only problem was the sauce took on an odd, almost grainy texture after it had cooled on the pasta for a bit. I may have cooked it too hard though. Sauted some shrimp & greens with garlic and red pepper then deglazed with more lemon juice, then threw the softened garlic clove into the cream sauce. I'm feeling a little overstuffed. Menu to be replicated (and hopefully more accurate) Wednesday for the boy.

I actually made this with more lemon juice than what was called for and still loved it, although next time I'll use the correct amount. I'll definitely make it again.

This is a great recipe. I added only two tablespoons of lemon and followed the rest of the recipe as is with one exception. I added a half teaspoon sugar to cut the bite and wow! We loved it. Made enough for lunch the next day and again it was very good. Will definitely make again!

this is really good! I sub'd half and half for the heavy cream and reduced the amount of butter. I also added chopped shallots, garlic and green onion (about a tbsp each) and chicken I'd marinated in a nice sherry and browned with some of the butter, shallots, garlc and green onions. I also used the same pan so I could get all the tasty bit's up. UMmm umm good

This was great! I followed the advice of the cook from Toronto and it turned out perfectly. I reserved a bit of the asparagus and served them on top of a bed of greens with lemon vinaigrette that I made with lemon juice, olive oil, shallot and salt and pepper. It was the perfect complement to the creamy pasta.

After having read through all the reviews for this dish, I decided to modify the recipe slightly: I added 2 Tbs of lemon juice (half of what the recipe called for), 1 minced garlic clove and lots of black pepper. Being a lemon freak myself, I can honestly say that 2 Tbs of lemon juice was just about enough. I think more lemon juice would have made the dish too sour. The garlic complemented the dish quite well. I didn't add the 1/4 cup pasta water because the sauce was watery already and since I reduced the pasta to 3/4 lb, I didn't want to have a very runny sauce. With the changes noted above, this dish turned out quite good. Do give it a try!

Perhaps I should have tasted as I went along, but I found the results rather bland. I reduced the amount of lemon juice based on the reviews and found that the pasta was not lemony enough.

I followed other reviewers' advice and was careful about the amount of lemon juice I added, tasting as I added it.

I benefitted from the reviews of previous cooks, adding only 2 Tbsp.lemon juice. Had all the ingredients on hand except for bow ties, so I used fettuccine, and it was delicious. This would be good even without the asparagus, or with a different vegetable; say peas, spinach, or even mushrooms. You do have to like lemon.

First off, we did this without the asparagus, since the fresh Washington asparagus JUST came in the week we made this and we wanted to savor that solo. Second, we added a scant teaspoon of grated ginger, at the recommendation of a friend from Italy. The rest we kept the same and the result was amazing - super easy and unbelievably delicious. Don't expect leftovers.

I followed this recipe to a T, taking into consideration other reviewer's complaints that this dish was too lemony, and brought it to a potluck. I was EMBARASSED to have brought such a bland, tasteless dish to share with my friends! I don't know what this recipe is lacking - maybe garlic or a sharp cheddar cheese to bring out the cream flavour - but it is definitely non-edible the way it stands. Now I have to figure out what to do with the huge amount of leftovers in my fridge . . . *blech*.

I prepared this recipe as a middle course of a gourmet dinner. The first and last courses were delicious but this recipe was the highlight of the meal. 10 people were served by using 1-1/2 lb farfalle, 2 lbs asparagus and 1-1/2 cups cream without increasing the lemon components from the original recipe. The balance was perfect; the cream went unnoticed by the diners despite the quantity, and the lemon did not overpower. Another dish whose end result transcends the simple list of ingredients

Just made this tonight and it was a huge hit! It was just a little too lemony for my husband and I, but we got used to it quickly. I also used lite sour cream instead of cream and couldn't tell the difference. I also added sun dried tomatoes and parmessan cheese, which balanced the tartness of the lemon nicely. I used chicken also, but think that the lemon lends itself better to seafood so next time I will try it with shrimp.

Simply superb! This is one of my favourite pasta dishes and it never fails to please. It can be easily adapted: try adding sauteed shrimp or scallops, finely grated parmesan and garlic to the sauce, a few sliced green onions, a generous amount of fresh minced dill, lots of fresh ground pepper, or snow peas instead of asparagus - all are excellent variations! I never add the pasta water to the sauce (WHY do that?), sometimes use half and half and always reduce the butter amount with no appreciable loss of flavour or richness. I have found the juice and zest from one large lemon is just right, otherwise it is too acidic/tangy and the lemon overpowers the other delicate flavours. Very company pleasing with much eye appeal and a delight to serve and eat! A true winner!

I think the varying responses might be due both to personal taste AND the lemons purchased... some lemons are more acidid than others and the intensity of the lemon peel can vary, too, I've found. I have made this dish (as have friends) successfully a number of times and found that if you start with only a tablespoon of lemon peel and about an 1/8th cup of lemon juice you are better off. stick a piece of bread into the sauce and test it before adding more, just in case the lemons you've purchased pack a punch! I tend to prefer it with a cup of half/half rather than the cream/water combination... a bit less 'greasy' tasting to those of us who eat lower fat most of the time... and I also find that you really need the pepper to balance the lemon... don't skimp! Chicken sauteed in the butter and cut into big chunks (6-8 per chicken breast half) add a lovely color and also make this dish more hearty for those who want their protein! I love this dish and it's been a part of my repertoire for a long time :) The only caution is to go carefully with the lemon. "Too much" can vary by the lemons purchased, and spoil a perfect meal. Bon apetit!

This is a quick and delicious meal - perfect for a weeknight. I've made it many times and have even enhanced it with a bit of grappa. To the cook from Cleveland: lemons cost approx. 20 cents each. I don't think that will break the bank! Get real.

I love this, but I leave out the heavy cream and, instead, just toss about 1/4 cup parmesan cheese in with the asparagus when I mix it with the pasta. I use only the zest of one lemon (seems enough and saves$$ too.) If you need liquid to replace the cream, just add some of the pasta water when you mix it. I usually leave out the parsley too, but I think it would be good. This summer I'll try it with basil.

I was quite anxious to make this recipie and it just didn't turn out well. I even pre-cooked some chicken and added it to the final product, but the lemon zest really made this dish unappealing.

Very good, very easy dish. I baked asparagus at high heat night before putting this together. I didn't use as much cream or butter as recipe called for - it was even good with scaled down amounts!

This dish was a delicious end to the asparagus season here. I stir-fried the asparagus pieces in the butter rather than boil them to cut down on water content and intensify the flavour, used less lemon and somewhat more cream, then slightly thickened the sauce with flour. At the end, I added pieces of sautéed chicken breast for a most delectable dinner. This will go into my T&T file, with three stars.

Very nice. I used Ziti instead of a bow tie pasta. Didn't substitute well. Next time I'll follow the recipe a little closer! I found that it needed a bit more sauce, but that could be because of the pasta I used.

This recipe is worthy of passing on to my friend Mary K!!
