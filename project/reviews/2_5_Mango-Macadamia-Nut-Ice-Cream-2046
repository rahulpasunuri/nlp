I have made many different kinds of ice cream, and as mango is one of my favorite fruits I was thrilled to try this recipe, but this was the single worst ice cream recipe I have ever made. extremely heavy, very custardy, but with absolutely no flavor. the mango (I used 3 very ripe ones, just to be on the safe side--imagine if I'd only used 2!) was completely overwhelmed by the custard, even though I really let it chill and let it sit in the fridge to blend the flavors. this makes slightly more than most ice cream recipes, and nearly overflowed both my blender (standard size) and my ice cream maker (standard motorized krups kind with freezable bowl). the toasted macademia nuts were very good, but couldn't save this. my husband (another ice cream freak) said eating this was like, "boring tasteless bite, boring tasteless bite, oh look a tasty nut, boring tasteless bite. . . " next time I crave mango ice cream I'll try a reliable recipe for peach ice cream and just substitute mangoes.

I am married to an ice cream addict. I make ice cream on a regular basis and this was "the best" I've made! It had a custard like feel to it. My husband gave it an A+!! I even put it in the blender with his orange juice for breakfast. I thought the nuts would get in the way but they didn't.
