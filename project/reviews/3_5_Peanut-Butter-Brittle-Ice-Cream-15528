This made a perfectly good ice cream. Followed the advice of the other reviewer, and cut way back on the peanuts - only used about one quarter of what was called for, and there were still plenty of peanuts in the ice cream. Also, used a major brand of smooth peanut butter, and went with "Reduced Sugar," as I was concerned the ice cream would turn out too sweet. Even with the Reduced Sugar peanut butter, the ice cream was still quite sweet; seems to me that regular pb would mean an overly sweet result. Anyway, served it with a hot chocolate sauce and slices of banana, and my peanut-butter loving boyfriend seemed to really like it.

My husband is not a huge ice cream fan - he likes it every once in a while and usually out at an ice cream parlor. Well, I asked him to try a taste and gave him one small scoop. Not only did he "ummmm" his way through the scoop, he came back for more! I think that is a huge compliment. Everyone in the family asked me to make it again. Their only complaint was that it had just a bit too much nuts. Next time I make it, I will add only one cup of peanuts to the sugar for the brittle. The peanut butter ice cream would be delicious even without the brittle added. Just yummy!
