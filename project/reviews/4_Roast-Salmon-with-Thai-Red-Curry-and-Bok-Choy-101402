My review is for the very balanced flavor of the sauce with the fish - I substituted out the bok choy for Spicy Stir-Fried Chinese Long Beans with Peanuts. Lovely dish with items you can keep around all the time - not too hot or sweet as coconut sauces can sometimes be - just lovely and easy. It did take a lot longer than 5 minutes to reduce to "about one cup".

Easy to make and tasty. Not quite spicy enough for me. I added siracchi sauce, but next time will add some crushed peppers. Very good. Will make again.

Too sweet-- next time I'd leave the brown sugar out and increase the curry paste. Otherwise, tasty and easy.

I, like others, had to totally change this recipe. So much so, that it was a whole new one. My stupid grocery store in Vermont, had no bok choy, no lemongrass. I changed the curry paste to about 1 tablespoon maybe more. Didn't measure. I bumped up the lime juice to about double. I added 1 T of grated ginger, 1 T of grated lemon zest. Instead of bok choy, I did napa cabbage. Chopped it into 1" squares and just sautéed it. Go easy on the oil and fish sauce. I did sear the salmon, makes a nice crust. But since my salmon was so thick ( 2+"), it took 15 minutes.

Made this for dinner. Definite Thai influence/flavour. As others recommended, I upped the curry paste. I actually quadrupled it to 2 tsp and it was perfect. I also added two cloves of chopped garlic, 2 tsp of grated ginger and Thai basil to the sauce. Overall, we liked the flavour. I don't know if we will make it again, though. If so, I will definitely cut the sugar and fish sauce a bit. The sugar was too much! I used light coconut milk, but would probably use regular next time. Served with jasmine rice with salt, cilantro and scallions.

Rating: 3
We loved this - but with several changes that required me to leave off a fork in my ratings. Following the suggestions of other reviewers I used about 3 times the red curry paste called for in the recipe and added ginger and garlic to the ingredients for the sauce. It was perfect with the roasted salmon (which I didn't bother to brown in the pan first). I sauteed the bok choy with more garlic, onion, mushrooms and a little chili paste and added brown rice for a more filling side dish. It was terrific.

Rating: 4
Without a moment's hesitation, I increased the red curry paste to 2T, and might use a bit more next time. I just roasted the salmon, foregoing the skillet step. After the bok choy was nicely sauteed, I removed it from the pan and sauteed a sweet red pepper, an onion, 2 or 3 cloves of garlic and some fresh ginger root, all thinly sliced. I added these vegetables to the curry sauce, and reheated it a bit. I arranged the salmon on a platter atop the bok choy, poured the embelished curry sauce over the top and garnished the dish with fresh cilantro. (I think basil would work too.) Served with brown rice, this was a colorful and fragrant presentation that pleased our palates as well.

I used 2TB of curry paste which was about right for us (we like it hot). I panfried and then roasted a thick salmon fillet as indicated, and it was perfect. Bok choy was sauteed with garlic in a wok without parboiling. Very good and quite straightforward.

Rating: 4
Very good recipe. Only criticism would be the cook time was way off. I would forgo cooking the salmon in the skillet before putting it in the oven, it dries the salmon out too much. Otherwise, this was a very easy and good recipe.

Rating: 4
look at the reviews... for sure add ginger and garlic - skip the parboil for the bok choi and skip the pan frying of the salmon (or tofu, or chicken, etc&) to save time and dishes... I used one whole package of the lemongrass, chopped it up in big chunks, then before serving, I ran the sauce through the strainer to remove the lemongrass. I totally agree with the reviews that lemongrass is too woody to actually eat. Dont substitute the lemongrass with lemon  I think it will ruin the whole flavor. I cut the baby bok chois in half and then just seared them in the oil, until desired doneness, which was maybe 4-5 minutes. They were al dente. Make sure you double or triple the red curry paste (otherwise it is bland, but taste it throughout your cooking and adjust according to your hear level desires.) Super easy, and delicious! Other people have recommended to add basil, which I think would be a lovely touch, right at the end, or even just as a garnish for color and taste. You can do most of the work ahead of time, like make the sauce, and let it sit.

Rating: 3
I followed the other reviewers' advice about adding more curry paste and some garlic. I didn't have any lemongrass on hand and used a teaspoon of lemon zest which was just the right amount. I think next time around I'll add sliced onions and bell peppers like I see at the Thai restaurant. Overall a very delicious curry, it would also work well with chicken or tofu.

Rating: 3
Excellent overall but it is worth noting that the curry sauce tastes much better when you double the amount of curry paste. With the amount recommended here, it's too sweet and coconutty and lacks heat.

Rating: 3
Seems like all reviewers applied their own personal variations on this recipe to make it 3-4 forks - I did the same as I don't think I would like the recipe "as is" - here's what I did and it was a big hit at my house: Double the amount of Thai Red Curry Paste. If you don't have access to lemongrass, don't use it and don't bother substituting lemon juice or peel - lemongrass has a very distinctive taste so if you don't have it, leave it out. Double the brown sugar. I am not a fan of fish sauce so I used only about 1 tsp. for the saltiness it adds and I did not drizzle any on the bok choy. After sauce has thickened, taste and adjust to your liking. No need to cook salmon in skillet first - just roast in oven after brushing with a little bit of oil and soy sauce (I like Tamari). Great with jasmine rice.

I used Spice Islands Thai Seasoning, 2 tsp, instead of red curry paste and it turned out fabulous.

Rating: 3
Very good but not spectacular. After reading reviews, I used 1 tablespoon of Thai Kitchen curry paste. Next time, I'd use at least 2, maybe 3, tablespoons. Also the recipe says you can use 1 T grated lemon rind instead of the lemon grass. I didn't have lemon grass so went with the lemon rind, which made the whole dish too lemony and lime-y. It was still good, but could use some more complex flavors. Maybe strew some frozen peas in the sauce; maybe stir in some basil at the end. I'll try it one more time with these variations. I served it family style in a pasta serving bowl, with the sauce in the bottom and the salmon and sauteed bok choy on top. It LOOKED incredible. Beautiful colors.

Whoo ho!!! This one's a winner if you love Thai food. Taking a cue from others I doubled the curry, added basil, garlic and ginger. Next time I'll add some heat. I used 4 baby choy and two salmon and there was no sauce left over in the end. Wished I had more baby bok choy. We used brown Jasmine rice. This is a happy meal.

Delicious! The salmon was crusty and wonderful, and the sauce was great. Couple warnings though. First, it's not at all spicy if you use the amount of curry in the recipe. Second, it makes a lot of dishes, but I think it's worth it.

Rating: 3
I loved the taste of this sauce when I made it; I thought it was exquisite. But when I reheated it the next day, it became an oily, flavorless liquid, and I was totally disappointed. Also, it was a pain to prepare the baby bok choy and salmon as directed; next time I would just make a vegetable on the side. I loved the sauce though, and would make it with fish or chicken to just serve once - not to be reheated. Too bad, because I live alone and like to have leftovers. Also, some brands of red curry paste are very mild - I used a tablepsoon of mine and it could have used more - and I don't like stuff spicy.

Rating: 4
The sauce is fantastic! I can't wait to prepare it again as it can be used for many dishes/meats. I served with jasmine rice and used ahi instead of salmon. I made some modifications to the sauce to make it more flavorful and add a little more heat. A few more modifications were based on making it easier. Also, although I made the dish for two I kept the sauce quantity the same and I was so glad we had the extra sauce! So, if I was making for 4 I would double all sauce ingredients. I used lite coconut milk, doubled the curry paste, subbed zest for lemon grass, and doubled the lime. To start the sauce I sauteed the curry paste with 3 cloves garlic and 1 tbsp. fresh ginger. I then added 2 tsp of hot chili sauce. When it was time to add the coconut milk I added 3 tbsp. of thai basil along with the fish sauce and brown sugar. 4 forks hands down!!

Rating: 4
Overall this was a great dish. I spent a lot of time reading the reviews before I prepared it. I tried searing the salmon but I'm not sure I'd do that again, especially if I was going to prepare this for a dinner party. Too much last minute hassle for not enough pay off. I think just baking the salmon with salt, pepper and a little oil drizzled over it would suffice. As for the Bok Choy, I had never prepared this before so I tried it as written and par boiled it. It was really wilty after sauteeing. I think I will split lengthwise and just saute in oil next time. Will save time and leave it a bit crunchy. I did use baby Bok Choy but two of them seemed like alot for one person. Served the dish with Jasmine rice. The sauce was outstanding and could be used on many other meats/fishes! Will make again for sure.

I have not done my share of asian cooking, but i was very impressed with this trial. I halved the recipe because i was making it for two. There didn't appear to be much sauce, but once served, there was plenty. I sauteed some carrot strips and exotic mushrooms to give it some extra color. The flavor was divine. My bf couldn't stop talking about it and requested i make it for his parents in a couple days. I have plenty of asian ingrediants remaining!

This is hands down the best tasting Thai recipie I have ever made! As a bonus it's super easy and took approx. 30 minutes start to finish. A couple of changes I feel worth noting - first, I tripled the red curry paste as we enjoy spicy food. Second, I added a cup of peeled shrimp with the salmon. Next time I will throw some pinapple in to compliment the tangy sauce. This one will definitely be in our regular rotation!

This is great. I make it all the time. It seems like a trick, because it's so easy -- I find that it's worth tracking down really good red curry paste, because it provides most of the flavor. Thai Kitchen is fine, but it's not, you know, boss.

A nice easy recipe with good flavours which I've used and adapted in a few ways. Firstly I add more curry paste - we like quite a kick! Also we're not too fond of salmon but pretty much anything works - good with jumbo prawns or a firm white fish. If you don't reduce the sauce much you can serve it in a soup plate with a cup of jasmine rice mounded in the centre and the prawns and greens round the outside - really nice presentation for guests. Lemongrass is essential but very woody - I just flatten a couple of pieces out with the side of a big knife and they can then be fished out easily just prior to serving. Enjoy.

An addendum to my original review. I did up the curry paste to 1 tablespoon and did not find it too spicey.

Made this dish with a some friends over the weekend and we were all really pleased with it. I did make a couple of changes, which did help the dish a little. I seared the salmon a little longer on each side (3 to 4 min. per side). in addition to the suggested baking time of six minutes at 400. The salmon was perfectly cooked, and a little crunchier on the outside. Served it with sautéed asparagus and a brown short grained rice with fresh basil as well. Definitely a hit.

This dish is super! I made it for my boyfriend and another friend and we all loved it. I could not find fish sauce at the International Farmer's Market OR the local grocery so did without and it was fine. I also used lemon zest instead of lemon grass (which I just find to be too strong). Followed advice of other reviewers on the prep--put fish in the oven (which I slathered with a home-made garlic paste first) and sauteed the bok choy (with some orange pepper and green onion for color). Used LITE cocount milk for the sauce (as I always do) and threw in fresh basil. Yum--and it was gorgeous, too. Will definitely make again.

Gave it a Canadian spin by creating a 2tbsp/2tbsp maple syrup/soy sauce glaze reduced for 10 minutes then basted on the fish before baking (Did not pan fry as per instructions). Curry sauce were cooked as per recipe except maple syrup was substituted for brown sugar. Baby Bok Choy was subsitited for full size and lightly steamed then sauted with seasame seeds. Served with wild mushroom cous cous - great reviews from guests.

This recipe is a keeper. Great flavors but sauce a bit benign so next time will take recommendations to increase curry paste and perhaps a bit more lemon zest. We did use lemon zest and enjoyed that it was not bitter or tough bits in sauce. I liked par boiling bok choy,while it was draining I could focus on rest of recipe and the final browning heated it up at the end.

I LOVE this recipe, but make it with yellow fin tuna steaks instead of salmon. It is important to not overcook the tuna - it should be fairly rare. It is just delicious! Wonderful blend of flavors and spices! I first did this on New Year's Eve and found it addictive!

Delicious and EASY. The only things I did differently were to omit the 2 step bok choy prep and only sauteed it in olive oil, and before serving I drained the lemongrass out of the curry. This dish was amazing. I would serve brown rice with it next time to soak up all the extra sauce.

I tried this recipe in hopes of recreating a similar dish I used to enjoy at a favorite restaurant which closed down a few months ago. It wasn't a perfect match, but it was close enough to make me very, very happy. I tried to save time and dishes by poaching the salmon directly in the sauce instead of roasting it -- next time, I think I'll follow the recipe.

This is a fabulous recipe. Easy for a weeknight, but special enough that it could be served to guests. I followed several reviewer recommendations: baked salmon in the oven (omitted fry pan step), sauteed and pan-braised bok choy (no need to parboil), added 1 garlic clove and some chopped basil to the sauce and cut the lime juice a bit. The one additional thing I would change next time would be to strain the sauce prior to adding the basil (even when finely chopped, lemon grass is like tree bark). This goes great with brown rice. I recommend it without hesitation.

Served with sticky rice a bought at local japanese restaurant. I baked salmon, then broiled to brown top. Used half the amount bok choy, only sauted it( I have also added 1 and a half cups shelled edamame beans to bok choy) Decreased the coconut milk to 3/4 can(if you can find A Taste Of Thai red curry paste, this amount called for in recipe is the perfect, in my opinion, amount of spice).I also added one tbls. grated ginger to sauce. I also added all the nam pla at once. I added extra lemon zest.And I did not use the skillet to fry salmon, I just baked it. This is one of my favorite recipes, and cutting out those two steps I mentioned above cut out a lot of time.

The sauce was really great... I added additional chopped ginger, garlic, and lemon zest (spur of the moment and didn't have lemongrass-- I know it's not a true substitute, so don't jump all over me). And while I'm thinking about it, can we all not try to be a little nicer to people? Cooking is all about improvisation, and yes we should try to stay as true as possible to the recipe when reviewing it, but life isn't quite that perfect. (end of rant) Also used light coconut milk with a little cornstarch to thicken it up, and tripled the amount of curry paste. My husband doesn't like salmon, so we had some fresh hake as well, which the sauce was equally good on. We also agreed that the sauce thinned with some chicken broth and some fresh shrimp/seafood and vegetables added would make a delicious Thai Seafood Soup.

I just had to add a comment after making this again last night. Highly recommend using 2 tsp of curry paste. It was not too hot for my guests or me. I had 4 women who are always "dieting", and every one of them cleaned their plate. Not a morsel of food left over. Try this, it's truly a winner!

I made this for friends last month and am doing it again tomorrow for another group. Suffice it to say, it was a hit and people were almost licking their plates. I also added more curry paste after reading the reviews. Ditto on the 2 steps for the bok choy...I just stir fried. This time I'm going to roast asparagus and top with lemon zest and toasted sesame seed for something different. Also, the Asian market here in San Diego is huge and I've discovered Thai black rice, which is wonderful. If you can find it, cook it in coconut milk and serve with the salmon...it's wonderful, and I'm not a fan of rice. This is one of the best recipes for salmon that I've found. Try it, you won't be disappointed. Thanks for another winner Epicurious!

Have nothing but high praise for this recipe. I didn't have time to read what the others had written as I got home very late tonight. The only alterations I made were to substitute blanched snap peas for the bok choy, lemon zest instead of lemongrass and I quadrupled the amount of curry paste. Even at that it was a bit mild for our tastes. But overall this is a great recipe and definitely company worthy. I will make this again without hesitation.

Superb recipe, delicate and subtle. Have made using mature and baby Bok Choy. The baby Bok Choy definitely makes a difference in not only taste but appearance. Have also stir fried baby Zuchinni (split down the middle) with their blossoms attached and used it in place of one of the baby Bok Choy. I use MAESRI brand Panang Red Curry Paste and at least double the amount per the recipe. This is a favorite recipe and I cook this for 16 - 20 a couple of times a year. When I do I have to start the sauce earlier in order to reduce it, but overall this is easy and quick to prepare for many people. Jasmine Rice with a sprinkling of roasted peanuts is a perfect compliment. I also serve with chilled oriental fruit salad consisting of diced lychees, ripe mango, pineapple, and other canned fruits found in my East Asian market.

We have made this many times and always think it is wonderful and easy! Although we don't see baby bok choy often, if we do this is the recipe! As others have recommended we add twice the amount of curry paste. We have used both the lite coconut milk and regular, obviously the lite version is a bit thiner, but we think just as tasty! We have also tried both the lemon and the lemongrass (I prefer the lemon, he prefers the lemongrass!). Leftovers are great.

This is a great recipe and perfect for 2 people. A Thai friend suggested that I buy "Penang" red curry, which worked beautifully. In the Asian market I bought the smaller 5 ounce cans of coconut milk, which was just right for making this dish for 2. I also like the sauce better when I strain it. The lemon grass flavors it, but we prefer it smooth. A great company dish, too.

I liked this recipe, but didn't fall in love with it like everyone else. Part of the problem was not finding a good thai red curry paste in the markets. I also thought it wasn't worth the cleanup afterwards...

1/4 tsp curry paste is not enough to even slightly flavor the sauce in this dish. Also, curry paste must NEVER be fried alone first. The correct way is to skim the coconut cream off the top of the coconut milk and heat this over high heat until the fat separates as small oil drops on top. Then, and then only, add the curry paste and fry for 5 minutes before adding the remaining coconut milk. Then procede with the recipe. Otherwise the flavor of the curry paste will not be developed.

I must not be very coordinated...this recipe calls for FOUR skillets going at once - a lot of hokey pokey for nothing really terrific. The sauce is tasty but that's about it - I know I didn't do the bok choy right (and had to use one grown up bok choy instead of 8 babies) - it was mushy and tasteless. In the future, I'd make the sauce in one skillet, broil the fish and serve with jasmine rice.

I don't even like easy recipes. I'd rather make something yummy that's complicated. This recipe lives up to everything everyone has said. Especially the "staggeringly good" comment. I used 2 tsp red curry paste and it was perfect. I make bok choy often and was really surprised at how good this variation is and will use this method from now on. Without the reviews I'm not sure I would have tried this and I would have missed out on the BEST recipe.

Wow this is wonderful. I, too, added more curry paste and served with jasmine rice. Used regular bok choy and everybody liked it. Will absolutely make again.

Excellent!! The only recipe that is as good as this one is the pan-seared tuna with ginger-shitake cream sauce that I also got off this site. Like reviewers before me, I did up the curry paste as we like some bite. The only other change I made was to grill the salmon. This will become one of my favorites for company.

Very tasty dish. I made some adjustments to compensate for what I had on hand. No red curry paste so I used thai red chili paste and added some curry powder. Also used light coconut milk and I thought it was fine, although regular would probably be richer. I skipped the bok choy too and served with roasted asparagus. Yum.

Fabulous salmon recipe! Light & very easy to make. Great week night dish when little time is available & you're in need of a gourmet dinner! Doubling the red curry adds spunk.

I doubled the red curry portion and the dish was wonderful - easy to prepare- though I would coat the salmon with flour next time so that the fish is more intact when plating this.

Just thinking about this makes me want to make it again. It is truely one of the best fish dishes I have every made. I added some red bell pepper and carrots to the bok choy before the boiling process and it went well with the food. I also added an extra measure of the red curry paste. I suggest you might want to go easy on that minor change. CAUTION: I HAVE BEEN MAKING THIS DISH FOR ABOUT A YEAR NOW AND I HAVE FOUND THAT THE LITE COCONUT MILK IS GROSSLY INFERIOR, DO NOT USE IT.

fab! actually added 4 times the amount of red curry paste and it was still tame for a Thai-head. For The Cook from Fresno looking for prepared curry pastes- look for a Thai Market (couldn't find it anywhere else) and try Maesri or Mae Ploy - I don't like Thai Kitchen or Patik's either. Looking for great, authentic Thai recipes? - True Thai, Victor Sodsook.

I normally allow my husband the last "piece" on the platter during dinner. He had to split that last piece last night and he had to fight get it. This is absolutely the "BEST" salmon recipe I have ever cooked. Period!!!

I only gave this recipe 3 forks as it wasn't spicey enough. Next time I will use a green Thai curry. Too much red Thai curry makes yer children be born nekkid!!

I Have experimented with a lot of different curry recipes. My favorite is a combination of Roys of Hawaii and a Basil curry sauce using mirin that I found long ago. However, it takes a lot of time and THIS recipe, while only taking 1/3 of the time, is almost just as good. I added a clove of crushed garlic to the sauce to give it some zip and if I had basil , I may have added that too. I like more curry flavor so added a considerable amount more of the paste. Does anyone have a favorite curry paste - I have noticed a definite difference in these pastes- so far my favorite is Patik's and I didn't really like the Thai Kitchen label. Will make this again when in the mood for curry without the time to make a more elaborate version. Hits the spot.

I was skeptical about the coconut milk (too sweet?, too tropical?), but the flavor was to die for. I doubled the curry paste and it was plenty hot. Excellent presentation. Needs a starch. I served mashed new potatoes.

The sauce is very good, but not spicy enough for my taste. I will re-heat the leftover tonight with more curry paste. Used light coconut milk, but it didn't thicken very much - will add a bit of cornstarch next time. Served over fresh arugula with green beans and jasmine rice - great dinner! Will make it with baby bok choy when I find it. Also, I just roasted the salmon in the oven instead of starting it on the stovetop.

This is truly excellent!! I had a little trouble finding lemongrass (it wasn't even available in my Asian market today) and I substituted lemon peel. I think the lemongrass would have made the sauce a little less tart, but nevertheless, my husband loved it, and believe me, he's hard to please. I may add a bit more red curry paste next time, just to see if there is any difference. I give this recipe 4 stars.--it's a great company dish and a real winner.

Amazing! I made this dish as part of an extensive Thai buffet and it was, by far, the most popular choice. Elegant, easy, and very very good. A great choice for people who like Asian food but can't take the fiery spices in traditional Thai curries. This is a winner!

My huscband isn't fond of coconut milk and he loves this sauce with the salmon and bok choy! I,too, used lite coconut milk and, because not everyone loves very hot spicy food, the current amount of red curry paste is perfect. I have used mature bok choy and those are okay, but not nearly as easy to prepare nor as sweet and tender to eat as the small ones.

This recipe for salmon was fabulous. The combination of lime, red curry paste and coconut milk was excellent. I used low-fat coconut milk I purchased from Trader Joes. I also added more of the red curry paste. This recipe is addictive. Enjoy!

This tasty dish is terrific! We make it without fish sauce and it's still tangy and flavorful. It's so quick and easy to prepare that it's become a weekday favorite.

Excellent, incredible flavor. Enjoye it so much I have made this dish 4 or 5 time. I also make extra sauce and keep it in the refrigerator so I always have some around. I have also used arugla and baby spinach as a substitute for the bok choy when it is hard to find.

A delicious flavor and great presentation. I doubled the sauce so we could dip bread in it. It will certainly enter my hit parade.

My husband loved this! And he is really difficult to please. The other great thing was it couldn't be easier. I made it twice as spicy as recommended (more curry paste) and the flavour was excellent.

Absolutely staggeringly good...and easy. Can be made with dark crinkly cabbage if you can't get bok choy!
