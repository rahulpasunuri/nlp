I am always in the lookout for new ways to prepare asparagus and I found this to be a very refreshing spring/summer dish. I drained the vinaigrette though, so it wouldn't be so overpowering.

I found this dish a little disappointing. Love all the ingredients...guess I thought the vinegar was a bit overpowering. I made it as part of a tapas/dinner party and my guests liked it...but while other dishes were devoured, there was leftovers of this one. I am currently in search of a new asparagus dish to try...any suggestions?

I steamed the asparagus to preserve nutrients, and used a handful of grape tomatoes instead of plum. I also added red onion. It came out wonderful. Very easy and healthy. Very tasty. Served with cod and a salad.

I brought a trebled amount of this dish to a relative's dinner. I made the dressing with the listed ingredients minus the green onions and the hard boiled egg. I added some balsamic vinegar to the red wine vinegar, shallots and yellow pepper. The guests seemed to like it - there were no leftovers.

This was a light refreshing dish I made to complement baked fish. It's perfect for a summer evening. I substituted the green onion with shallots - it added a lot more flavor.

I've made this and variants many times. I usually substitute yellow bell pepper for the green, which softens the flavor and has a nicer color contrast. I also usually add some shallots or sweet red onion to liven up the vinaigrette. I have tried garlic too, but that usually comes out a bit strong.

This is a recipe which is relatively simple, but its success is dependent on the quality and freshness of ingredients. I did not find the recipe needed modification. The vinaigrette is refreshing--which is not to say it does not have a bold taste. I made it once with green asparagus and another time with French white asparagus. Definitely stick with the green because there is a conflict of flavor and chemistry with the stronger taste of the latter.

GARLIC ADDED TO THE VINAGRETTE IS A MUST & GRATED PARMESEAN CHEESE SPRINKLED OVER ALL BEFORE SERVING IS ALOS AN ADDED PLEASURE....ALSO, IF DESIRED, A LITTLE DRY MUSTARD ( 1/8 TSP ) ADDED IS GOOD

Needs more of a complex flavor....
