Loved this recipe. Used pistachios instead of hazelnuts, and they were great. Left off the capers. The recipe was quick and easy and the fish was heavenly. The pistachios worked well, but were a little salty, since I had no unsalted ones, but the unsalted butter helped.

I substituted cilantro for parsley and it was fantastic.

I hand chopped the nuts for more texture and less clean-up. I doubled the sauce recipe, but should of held back on the vinegar; it was a bit strong. All and all, a good, super- quick meal. Wife the 3 year-old loved it.

I agree, this was delicious and will definitely make it again. We used Balsamic vinegar in place of red wine vinegar and didn't chop the nuts as much as recommended - wanted crunchier - it worked.

This recipe was quick, easy and hearty. I was looking for something that would stand up to roasted beets and arugula salad. Made it with Speckled Trout instead of Hake. The nuts, capers and parsley didn't overwhelm the fish but held up to the side dishes.
