Would make again if I can get some answers. Have made a full size Pavlova (son-in-law is from New Zealand0 with fairly good results but thought that this recipe looked much nicer. BUT - the outside cracked off and the inside was like matted down cotton candy, almost impossible to cut with a fork. Can anyone give me any hints as to what I might have done wrong?

Can you get Total Greek yogurt in the US ? Try substituting this for the cream in final assembly - obviously any summer fruits, but a mix of English raspberries and US blueberries, slightly crushed together and dressed with cassis, is glorious with the Yogurt.

Wonderful! I too used Splenda instead of sugar, and quartered the recipe for 4 servings. What a great desert for summer. It wasnt that hard either, and boy were they impressed.

This is fantastic. Used Splenda to make it almost carb-free. If you want the cake to remain a little crispy assemble just before serving. It gets soggy the next day, but is just as delicious...just different.

Really quite a simple recipe, and looks and tastes so elegent! I also divided this recipe by 3 to make enough dessert for 6 people. I took it to a dinner party, and it was perfect for this. I packed the meringues in a tupperware, brought the berries in another tupperware, and whipped the cream at the hostess' house. A tip from an Australian: if you can find passion fruits, whip the pulp of one or two of them into the whipped cream. It's to DIE for.

This was so easy and so good. I divided the recipe in thirds to make if for 6 and it was wonderful.

I have made this dessert a couple of times now. My father-in-law absolutely raved about it, and he's a very picky man!! It presents beautifully and tastes great, too! Worth the time it takes to beat the whites.
