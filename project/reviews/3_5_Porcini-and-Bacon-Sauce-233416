The sauce does take a lot of prep but then just needs to simmer. I used portabello instead of button mushrooms and didn't have the roasting juices due to a timing issue. It was FANTASTIC and made the house smell great! I will definitely make this again!

The only reason for giving this recipe three forks instead of four is that it is incredibly time consuming. That being said, it was an outstanding compliment to the rib roast and all of our guests loved it. I would definitely suggest you make this a day ahead. As others have stated it does make it easier to skim the fat off after it has been in the fridge overnight.

My daughter in LA emailed this recipe and we both made it 3000 miles away from each other for Xmas....I loved it, a little complicated at first but since we were doing it "together" it was easier....I recommend also using all the mushrooms, the flavor was outstanding. I halved the recipe only using some wine just for color/flavor...Cannot wait to make it again

Delicious! Next time I wouldn't strain out half the mushrooms as some others have mentioned... why waste 'em? I would also make it a day ahead and refrigerate. Makes it easier to skim off the fat and, since it's time consuming to make, you'll have less to do on the big day. I didn't find it too salty, but I kept the rub on the top of the roast so it wouldn't end up in the pan/in the sauce. Will definitely make it again.

This sauce was tasty but did not elicit any raves from my guests for Christmas dinner. Given the cost of a decent red wine and the porcini mushrooms,as well as the time spent, I didn't think it was quite outstanding enough (hence only 2 forks).

I am making this for the second time this year for our Christmas dinner. This time, serving it with a beef tenderloin. My family loves this recipe--one daughter actually died and went to heaven, but, thankfully, in the season of miracles, returned! Reading the reviews here, I am puzzled by everyone thinking they have to discard those mushrooms that they have strained out in order to further reduce the cooking liquid. Nothing in the recipe says to throw them away. I just assumed that you didn't want to cook them any more while reducing and concentrating the (totally yummy) sauce and so I added them back in together with the reserved mushrooms. I did that before and plan to do it again. I can't wait to enjoy this sauce!

Not difficult, but a significant time investment. Totally worth it. I make it every year!

I made this sauce last year with a standing Rib Roast and it was one of the most tastiest sauces I have ever made. It was requested by everyone again this year for Christmas. This sauce does take a while to prepare but it is well worth it. I followed the directions exactly as they were laid out in the recipe.

This certainly took a long time to make but it was a wonderful sauce. I couldn't find porcini so I used 1 oz. chanterlle mushrooms. I don't know how much that may have altered the flavor. I added 3 tbsp butter at the end and it's worth it, it makes the sauce so silky and creamy. I would have prefered it a little thicker, more like a gravy, as it was running on the plate, but it tasted good on everything (esp. the mashed potatoes) so it was actually fine. I would make this again w/ the Roast, if i had 2 days to do it. (I did strain it and then add back the reserved mushrooms, it took me a long time to figure out which mushrooms to reserve, but i got it :) I actually like it the way the recipe is written.

EXCELLENT! Mine reduced in about an hour. My kitchen smelled like a restaurant. I did the prep work (ie chopping, slicing, etc) of ingredients while the porcinins soaked. I made this one day in advance and so glad I did. The flavor was even more robust the next day when it was actually served. Well worth the effort. Not too complicated if all your ingredients are lined up and chopped or sliced or measured as you need them. Can't wati to make this again.

It is a little complicated, but worth it. At our Christmas eve cocktail party, I actually caught one (quite intoxicated) guest shoving spoonfuls into his mouth in the kitchen!!! Now that's a compliment!

We like our rib roast unadorned, so I made this sauce to serve with a London broil that I marinated as directed for the roast, then grilled it ouside. The sauce is delicious served this way, even without beef drippings. One change, and I can't understand why the recipe directs otherwise, is to save almost all of the mushroom mixture to add later, and to retain the porcini at the end as well--i.e., don't strain the sauce. Why toss out perfectly delicious mushrooms? Sure, pressing on them will release some of their juice, but if you simply leave them in, you'll have ALL the flavor! Oh, yes--It costs $3.99 for 3/4 ounce of dried porcini, so I used a lot less than 2 ounces, which may be why keeping them in the sauce isn't overwhelming. In addition, I used 2 cups each (one can each) of beef and chicken broths, which seemed to be a better balance. I've already made this 3 times, so you can see that we really enjoy it!

LOVE THIS SAUCE! I took a hint from the other reviews and halved the salt on the rub on the beef. I also had some veal stock left over so I used it instead of the beef stock. I used a decent Rhone ($12 a bottle) that worked beautifully. The porcini add a really nice flavor, but they are not included in the final product and thats fine. I used button shroons this time, but I think I'll kick it up just a bit with Crimini's or Shiitake's next time. YUM!

This was an excellent sauce & worth the time it takes to make it. I used low sodium broth, but it still was a little salty.

Just fabulous with the rib roast. The flavors are rich and delicious.

Loved this sauce. I served it with beef tenderloin and it elevated it from very good to simply outstanding. It was a bit time consuming but well worth the effot. Due to the high cost of porcini mushrooms, I used only 2/3 the amount called for, which worked fine. In response to the other reviewer, after sauting the white mushroom mixture, 1/2 of that is set aside to be added after the sauce is strained (the porcini mixture is thrown away after all the flavor is imparted to the sauce) I did also want it slightly thicker so made a slurry with cornstarch and water that I added right at the end. This also let me eliminate most of the butter added at the end to reduce the fat content. Just added 1 T of butter at the end.

I made this for Christmas day and thought it was well worth the time and a sauce of restraunt quality. You can always add the mushrooms back in as we did. I ate until I was sick! Give it a try. A nice change from the usual horseradish sauces you see.

Too much work for too little reward. May have been too salty because of the juices from the roast.

I have a question. After sauteeing the shallots, garlic and mushrooms for 8 minutes, it says to set 1/2 the mushrooms aside (and you add them back at the very end after straining everything else out of the sauce). Are they talking about the porcini mushrooms or the button mushroom, garlic and shallot mixture? I tried to look at the picture in the magazine to see what mushrooms are on top and I can't tell. Help!

This sauce was tasty, but did turn out rather salty, despite using the low-salt broth. Spending nearly $8 on 2 oz. of dried porcini mushrooms seemed like a waste since you strain them out of the sauce at the end. (But, I have never used porcini before so perhaps you are not meant to eat them?!) In the end I am glad I made the sauce to go with the roast, but I am not sure I would make it again.
