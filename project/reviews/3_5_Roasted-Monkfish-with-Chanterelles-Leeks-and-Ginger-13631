The veggies were super delicious! I didnt slice up the ginger and garlic and insert it into the fish, though I really should have, I think the actual fish was a bit bland because of it, so definitely dont skip that step! I also roasted at a lower temp, and I think the fish was bordering overdone. I didnt have Tawny Port, so I just used some white wine and some rice vinegar instead. I think it would have been perfect if I didnt skip the one step, so Im still giving it full marks :)

I was very disappointed with this recipe, and myself for not noticing that the cooking temperature and time were excessive for fish, especially this type of fish. Mine came out fairly dry despite the butter and the flavours were too bland. In my opinion, this was a waste of money and time and far inferior to just a simple grilled piece of fish with grilled veggies.

the flavor in this dish was excellent. I used chanterelle, portabello, and crimini. I followed the recipe except that I did not cook monkfish. I served the dish with steaks so it probably missed a bit of flavor from the monkfish but it was delicious on it s own. A fitting celebration for my husband's 51st birthday.

I substituted the Sherry for Port, and skipped the potatoes, but it worked very well indeed.

Very tasty! I didn't have Port, so added a dash of red wine vinegar. Also cheated on the butter - didn't clarify - so it browned a teensy bit, but I think it tasted great! I added carrots to the leeks and potatoes and some fresh asparagus in 2-in. pieces just before placing fish on top - makes it a pretty and more healthy all-in-one meal!

This recipe has become a standard in my repertoire. If followed as written, it's a delicious entree. It also is adaptable, as many other reviewers have suggested. If you don't have chanterelles...substitute shiitakes, morels, cremini or other mushrooms. If you don't have monkfish, use other mild meaty white fish. All in all, very much a keeper. I'm making it again tonight.

This is a good recipe. The keys to it, I think, are the chanterelles and the clarified butter. Don't skip this step. I used big pieces of monkfish with no adverse effect. This dish could be extended without much negative impact by using more potatoes and leeks than called for. This mixture makes a great lunch the next day too. The only downside is that monkfish and chanterelles are both expensive items, so I spent about $40 just on ingredients! No regrets, though. enjoy

This is a wonderful dish!! To be honest, it didn't SOUND that good, but it really was. I have made it twice--omitting the ginger(because I don't like it.)

Very good recipe. I also served it with sauteed celery root. Very simple: just cut in small squares (like a potato) and cook with olive oil in a pan. Very tasty and goes very well with all kind of white fish.

I loved the combination and so did my husband and children (17 months, 5 years and 9 years). I couldn't find chanterelles so substituted shiitakes and also deglazed using balsamic vinegar. I will increase the amount of soy sauce and vinegar next time, though, to add more punch to the veggies. Definitely a keeper!

We made this dish for lunch, with to-die-for results. Since there was no monkfish to be had on short notice, we used cod that we had caught and frozen a few months back. Also, added Shitake mushrooms to the Chanterelles, used onions instead of leeks, and substituted Plum Wine for Port (less expensive, and tastes so good that your eyes will roll into the back of your head). Extremely aromatic while cooking. For added zip, I sprinkled an extra helping of garlic powder and white pepper over the vegetables and fish. Make this dish - you won't be dissappointed!

Delicious. I made it without the monkfish and we loved it.

First, we used a mix of chanterelles and hedge hog mushrooms. This made the dish cheaper and more varied in flavors. For potatoes we used fingerlings which roast nicely. For deglazing we used balsamic vinegar instead of tawny port. Finally, we made a brown sauce from the deglazing along with butter, shallots, fish stock, and tarragon thickened with a simple roux. Not much work but worth it.

Cliff Ratliff (lighthouse@acninc.net) This dish was delicious with an added bonus of an aromatic smell during cooking. I could not find chanterelles but substituted regular mushrooms and they worked out well. The only problem was cutting the monkfish into medallions.

I love monkfish, leeks, and chanterelles. I dislike this recipes because it underutilizes all of these ingredients. The outcome is very plain.

I thought the recipe was delicious. I did modify it just a little by using vidalia onions instead of leeks. I had seen monkfish prepared on "Food TV" but had never eaten it before. I recommend if you haven't tried monkfish, do so. This recipe is an excellent and easy way to prepare it.
