This is somewhat confusing and quite ugly. Do not over puree the pesto

Good but a bit confusing to make if following the recipe. The slivers of Gruyere were just too dry and over sized to work. We made the pesto and then added the slivers to the processor and pulsed a few times to make chunks of Gruyere. This made for a nice texture and easy stuffing of the celery. To finish add one Pomegranate seed to each boat, the color is fantastic.

I found this very strong in flavour. I went by other readers' suggestions and didn't worry about celery boats, but put some on crackers. However, this may have been a bit to strong and dry tasting. I loved the taste, and will definitely make it again as a standard pesto to go with pasta, but not worry about serving it in any canape form in future.

Although this is tasty, the boats capsized. Most of my guests stayed away from it. Next time will try with tomatoes or crackers.

I added the basil (and garlic) right after I processed the gruyere and pine nuts. I added the vinegar after I added the oil. It's a recipe sorely in need of editing, for sure. I made this for a party and instead of cutting the gruyere into julienne strips, I grated it all, reduced it about 1/3, and processed it with everyone thing else. I reduced the vinegar some, too. I got raves and requests for the recipe.

This recipe was very easy to put together and was very well received by our guests. The extras stored well in the fridge and my wife took them to work for lunch the following day.

We made this as a vegetable dip, rather than the boats. It's an interesting twist on the usual cheese dip, but didn't have much bite. We added garlic and that seemed to do the trick.

I served this at my cocktail party. I didn't taste it but was told by guests they were delicious. The pesto was mild and appreciated by non-pesto fans.

I used the filling on tomatoe slices. It was great

The filling was delicious. The celery boats had a tendency to capsize, though, and really weren't that attractive. Try the filling w/ other veggies, or even w/ crackers.
