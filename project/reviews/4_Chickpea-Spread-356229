This Greek hummus is unbelievably delicious and is a now a staple in this vegany household. The sun-dried tomatoes, the basil, and the garlic add lots of flavor, though I do recommend cutting back on the garlic. (I use half of the garlic called for in the recipe.) The beauty of this recipe is that you can adjust the amount of each ingredient to your taste. The second time I made it, I was pressed for time, so I simply added plain cooked chickpeas (chilled)-- and not Chickpea Confit--and the result was outstanding. It's great on pita bread, lavosh, or crackers, with feta, olives, and cucumber slices.

This is very good. I made this exactly as recommended. Be careful of the garlic. If you add all of the garlic as called for, plus the garlic from the garbanzo confeti, then this may be a bit much garlic. I love garlic, but may cut back on it next time. It is a little time consuming, but worth every minute!
