Delicious, delightful, yum! These are perfect! My 14-year-old makes them without any trouble. Yes, Fluff is messy, we used a pastry bag with a wide circle tip to fill them neatly, it was simple. We use a 3/4 oz cookie scoop to make the 'cookies' so one batch makes about 12 whoopie pies.

well to all those viewers on this... i'm 14 years old and i made these just fine!! the filling was not that messy at all!! totally worth it!!! They were so good and so easy!!! the only thing that was messy about the filling was getting it out of the container!! so it was NOT sticky at all! I think a 9 year old could make these just fine!!! Totally worth it!!!

Grew up on whoopie pies in Maine. Like suggested, upped the cocoa to 2/3 cup, and used a med cookie scoop to dole out the portions. Thus making them about a 4 bite size. They were moist, and tasted wonderful. I personally do not like filling with marshmallow fluff, so made a vanilla cream cheese frosting instead. Will make them again.

Terrible. As noted by other reviewers, the filling is a mess. The cake rise was terrible, and spread is huge using 1/4 cup sized mounds. It was so bad I thought I might have made a mistake between baking soda and powder, but on double check, saw the recipe was indeed soda. As a very experienced baker and a Bostonian who grew up eating these, I would highly recommend some different recipe.

Doubled the recipe, added a scant Tbs of espresso powder, 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon and used a #16, leveled-off ice cream scoop to yield 68 cookies. Used parchment paper to avoid spreading. The cookies ended up perfect: a bit puffy, moist and about 2" (2-3 bites) across. After the helpful reviews re: the filling, I hobbled together a great one that made enough for the dbl recipe: 2 sticks softened butter, 2 c. powdered sugar, a 6 oz. jar marshmallow fluff and 1 brick (8 oz?) of softened cream cheese. Added vanilla bean paste for pretty flecks. Made the frosting in the mixer first (& let set in 'fridge overnight) & used mostly cleaned out mixing bowl to make the cookies. I'll make these again, happily. They're darling & tasty and do best made in advance by a day or two!

This is one of my go to recipes. I have made this for family and friends, for parties and just for myself. It always provides that nostalgic taste of childhood with a serious upgrade on taste. The cakes alway turn out perfectly whether using real buttermilk or clabbored milk. The filling just needs a little more confectioners sugar and a little less marshmallow fluff and it stays put at room temperature. I will continue to make this recipe until my last breath. Thank you Epicurious for making my life better!

They taste good. The cookies were easy but my God, the filling was a nightmare. Gooey, sticky, got everywhere. Tasty but not worth the effort.

Rating: 3
The cookies were really delicious, the frosting was a mess. Cookies: The flavor was great: even chocolate flavor with lovely, moist texture. Most notably, they were easy to eat without squeezing all of the frosting out which makes for a much more enjoyable whoopie pie experience. As others have mentioned, 1/4 cup makes huge cookies; next time I'll start with heaping tablespoons and go from there. The frosting was also an issue with us. It was gloopy, sticky, and runny. The taste was fine--my son and I licked the batters--but quite sweet. Since these pies were meant as bodies for spider cookies, the frosting would just not do, and, unfortunately, we had to dump the whole recipe into the food waste bin. We ended up using whipping cream as a quick replacement. Next time, we'll either stick with the whipped cream (held the licorice 'spider legs' just fine) or try cream cheese frosting.

I had no cocoa powder. Sub baking chocolate and it still turned out good. Melted cooking chocolate and folded it in alternating w flour and buttermilk. Did not use marshmallow cream. Made a cream cheese concoction as I was initially interested in making red velvet Whoopie pie but felt this recipe had a better tasting cake bit.... And it is better. Nice fine crumb. Did not crumble on me.

Utterly disgusting! The filling is awful, the pies are very salty, dense, and bland. They taste nothing of sugar or chocolate. Completely inedible, went straight in the garbage disposal.

I looovvvveeee this recipe. Increased the cocoa to 2/3 cups. Made the filling first, exactly as written. Put it in the fridge until the cakes were cooled, ready to spread. Delicious. I used an ice cream scoop for the cakes, and leveled each off with a rubber spatula. The recipe made 12 whoopie pies. I may have to make more for super bowl Sunday. Highly recommend!

Rating: 2
I wasn't overly impressed. Maybe I just remember whoopie pies differently. The cakes were good - I made them much smaller to feed a large crowd. The filling was too marshmallowy for my taste and it was very gooey/runny. Don't get me wrog, I ate more than one and quite enjoyed it. I probably won't use this recipe again at least not with this filling.

I thought the cookies were dry. Teenagers ate them but I prefer less dry. Used my own marshmallow fluff filling.

Delicious cookies, tried to make them small but they still puff when you cook them~25 in my batch. Added cream cheese to the filling and food coloring to make them special for Halloween. Filling is good but messy as others have stated. Chilling overnight, we'll see if they are any less messy. Non the less they do taste great and I'll make again.

Rating: 3
Cake recipe is very good - as others suggested, I upped the cocoa to 2/3 cup. I also added a half a tsp of espresso powder, as coffee kicks up the chocolate flavor. I did 1 tbls portions which yeilded about 42 halves (21 full cookies). The filling, however, does get...oozy. I even refidgerated mine, which helped on the first few, but if you put enough filling in to see it on the sides, it starts to ooze out and make a big mess. I did half with the messy marshmallow filling and half with Martha Stewart's peanut butter buttercream - and liked the PB ones better.

Rating: 4
Made these today and followed many of the suggestions in previous reviews. Using 2/3 cup cocoa yielded the not too sweet, semi-firm cake that would hold up to the filling. I used a 2 tbl scoop, which made 14 pies. For the filling, I used half shortening & half softened cream cheese with the original recipe and got a very good consistency. Still pretty sweet, so I used a scant tblsp scoop....no oozing. To counterbalance the sweetness, I rolled the edges in chopped salted peanuts. These will become the "go to recipe" for bake sales & picnics!!! Easy & delish!!!

I have been baking whoopie pies for most of my life. I have tried many recipes and have tweaked them all to my liking. The cakes in this recipe are fantastic. I put a heaping teaspoon on a greased cookie sheet. Then I dip my index finger in water and swirl each cake to make them round and flatter for more uniform cooking. *** Note: Don't under cook these. They need to be firm-ish so when you place the tops on, they don't crumble. For the filling I use a whole lg. container of Marsmallow FLUFF, 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar, 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla, and 1/c cup of shortening, 1/4 cup of unsalted butter. Whip in your stand mixer for 5 min. It's so smooth and not overly sweet. Everyone I know raves about these!

I love this recipe - it's quick and easy and you can use the basic cake for a variety of whoopie pie combinations. I put peanut butter frosting inside mine once because I wasn't a fan of the basic fluff goo that the recipe includes.

Rating: 3
yummy! this recipe was by far the easiest to make, the quickest, and one of the tastiest. the cook time was very short, though it says 11-13 minutes we cooked it for 15. So it would cook all the way through and become fluffy and rich. my only disregard is that the icing preparation is messy and sticky and when you put icing on the pies its thins and drips off. next time add more confectioners sugar. Other than that a splendid recipe that the whole family will love! tip: make sure the whoopie pies are in pairs so they will sandwich together properly :)

These are WICKED GOOD! A taste of my childhood returns. Growing up in New England, I have had many Whoopie Pies. The memory I cherish most are my aunts recipe. She made them every year, for the family July 4th gathering. Although she has now passed on, and I live across the country from family, I was lucky enough to find this recipe. I made the cake batter with Saco brand cocoa. I didnt have buttermilk, so I used the old 1 Tablespoon vinegar, add milk to 1 cup as a substitute. My yield was 48 cookies of various sizes, from 1 ½ inch to 3 inch across. I did decrease the baking times, from 6 to 10 minutes, depending on size. Thanks here to the person who suggested using a pastry bag for doling out the batter, I did and will never use a scoop or spoon for these again. I made the filling as directed, using Crisco in place of butter and Fluff (not the flatter types of marshmallow crème). My filling was light, super fluffy and NOT too sweet. I also had almost twice as much filling as needed&so I baked another batch of cookies. Waste not, want not!

Rating: 4
These are a huge hit every time I make them. I use use a 2T scoop to make perfectly uniform cakes, and bake them for 9 minutes. That yields more like 1 1/2 dozen servings. The filling is more manageable if the butter is not too soft. It's definitely much easier to pipe it out with a pastry bag. They would probably keep forever in an air-tight container, but they never stick around long enough for me to worry about storing them.

Rating: 3
These are delicious. I filled them with a seven-minute frosting, which tastes much like marshmallow. I made these for the refreshment stand at my daughter's school play, and watched people just savor them! Used the 2/3 cup of Ghiraldelli chocolate and they came out very chocolate-ey. I also used a small ice cream/melon scoop and ended up with 14 pies.

Rating: 3
Excellent! I forgot the vanilla, so it will be even better the next time. The cakes have a very nice texture. I used Ghirardelli chocolate which is reasonably priced and tastes delicious - used 2/3 cup as others recommended. Made 15 smaller pies, using a little ice cream scoop.I think the buttermilk and brown sugar really make this recipe.

Rating: 4
Fantabulous! I made these earlier this evening with my sister and they were nothing short of awesome. The batch makes for a ton of whoopie pies, I think we made about 14, and they were pretty damn big. Be sure you have people in mind to give these to because you could easily eat them all. For real.

Rating: 4
These turned out delicious! The only thing I changed was using regular cocoa powder and using fresh lemon juice to sour the milk. I would suggest using a smaller scoop for the cakes. 1/4 cup mounds make 8 HUGE larger-than-palm-size cakes. I also refrigerated the filling prior to piping it onto the cakes (spreading it on was impossible). If you can resist not eating them as soon as they are done, they are a lot better the second day!

Finally! A devil dog (whoopee pie) recipe without using shortening! It tasted so amazing! My mom would make these for my brother's birthday treats at school. Now, I am making them for my two daughters. It takes more than the suggested time to make, though. Worth it, though! Thank you for this recipe!

Rating: 4
Excellent. I added 2/3 cup of cocoa, as some other reviewers pointed out (I used Hershey's Special Dark) and a teaspoon of instant espresso powder. The filling is really, really sweet, but it's offset by the cookies, which aren't too sweet. I used a heaping tablespoon (probably about 2 1/2 Tbs) of batter for each cookie, and I got 10 whoopie pies.

Rating: 4
These are a true Whoopie Pie. The cake should be drier than most regular cake recipes (not bone dry, but not the moist cake you look for in a party cake or cupcake) I make these on a regular basis and everyone loves them. The key to the filling is to refrigerate it for a couple of hours. I do notice that if I fill my cookies right after I make the filling, it is a bit gooey, but after it has chilled for a while is is perfect. I quadruple the recipe, pipe the batter out of a pastry bag with a giant plain tip, the fill using an ice cream scoop. I also use about a tablespoon more of the buttermilk to make the batter easier to pipe. My Mom made whoopie pies when I was little and these are even better...

Rating: 4
I've never made Whoopie Pies before, and I scored big time on these. Actually my whole family did. They were moist and delicious, especially the filling. I love using marshmallow fluff in frostings, it makes the texture smooth and creamy and the sweetness is unsurpassed. I did not have buttermilk and used skim milk with lemon juice (put 1 TB lemon juice in a one cup measuring cup, filled with skim milk to equal 1 full cup) and I didn't have dutch process cocoa so I used regular. I was surprised at how big these were, you could actually make 16 cookies, just smaller. But I won't lie, they were so good, you would have eaten two anyway. I would definitley recommend this recipe.

Moist & delicious! Used 2/3 cup cocoa as recommended. Also used following filling: 1 1/2 cup butter, salted; 3 c sifted confectioner sugar; 1 1/3 cup marshmellow (i.e. Fluffernutter); dash salt, 1 tsp vanilla; 1/3 cup milk*** . Cream butter in mixer and gradually add sugar, mixing well until combined. Add the rest of ingredients, except milk. ***ONLY if filling is too dry, then gradually add milk. Otherwise, fill whoopie pie with filling and top with other pie. Enjoy! NOTE: You can use 1/2 butter and 1/2 cream cheese instead of butter but then you will need to refridgerate.

I wanted to make Whoopie pies for a bake sale for a local hospital, and used this recipe, I never made Whoopie pies before. Everyone that ate them said they were the best Whoopie pies they ever had. I have made them numerous time since with the same reviews. I changed a few things...I neve have buttermilk so I used half and half, but added brewed cofee to enhance the chocolate. I use half a cup of coffee and half a cup of half and half mixed together. I also use the "Nigella" method of making cake... I add all the ingredients except the cream and coffee mixture to a food processor, pulse it until everthing is combined and slowly and the coffee milk until it is all mixed. I use a cookie scoop and make 15 pies. I follow the cream recipe, but sometimes have to add more powdered sugar to make the cream stiffer. They are excellent.

The cake is fantastic! The only change I made was adding a 1/4 cup flour since I'm high altitude and I just used Hershey's dark cocoa powder. The texture was perfect,not too sweet, not too moist, not sticky, but it almost melts in your mouth and I love the flavor the buttermilk gives. For the filling I used a whipped vanilla buttercream that I had left over from a previous project that I didn't want to go to waste, I just added a tablespoon of butter and re-whipped it. Put the two together and it was to die for! I'll be making another batch tomorrow but with a marshmallow filling. I'm taking the suggestions of quite few other reviews regarding the filling recipe with this one and do some research on marshmallow fillings. I'll also make them a little smaller, a 1/4 cup makes huge pies!

So disappointing. I am a professional baker and have made many a whoopie pie in my life. The cakes came out quite chalky and I used a 22/24 cocoa (high fat); the filling was a bland at best. Bad all the way around. Quite sad little whoopee pies&

I disagree with those that have a negative perspective on the cakes, they were exactly as I expected from my childhood mid-western bake sale favorite! In my recollection they're not to be overly sweet or moist enough to be sticky, mine turned out just right! The filling however was disappointing, as taste was good, but the texture kept me from picking up the pies as it ran like a glaze ( very messy ). I will use the cake recipe again, but I am hunting for a stiffer/fluffier filling for my next try.

Rating: 1
just terrible. simply awful. the cakes were dry and were lacking a distinctive chocolate flavor and the filling was cloyingly sweet. no one would shout "whoopie!" eating these. even if the recipe had turned out well, this would have been too much work for only 8 cookies. that said once frozen and smashed with excess filling they made fairly good cake pops. the one true redeeming factor was they lead to a wonderful sugar coma, that had us sitting on the floor laughing hysterically all afternoon.

Rating: 4
The cookie portion of this recipe gets 4 forks. I didn't do the filling because I didn't have marshmallow cream and just did a basic American buttercream (butter, powdered sugar, cream, vanilla).It worked more than well, I think. I would recommend piping them rather than spooning the mounds on since it goes so much faster and you get that round shape. Mine were tiny, maybe 2 inches each and my 2 year old niece was able to hold them easily. Oh, and thanks to previous reviewers for mentioning the original recipe had 2/3 C cocoa instead of the 1/2 c on this site.

The chocolate cakes were very good, but my filling (made as written) was a gooey mess. It oozed out everywhere. Good to eat, but I wouldn't serve these to guests since the visual appeal was so low. Wish I knew the secret to getting the filling to thicken up.

These were delicious. I made them exactly according to the recipe, except I made 24 2-inch pies instead of 8 huge ones, considering how decadent they are. Everyone LOVED them, and thye dissapeared very quickly. The cake is moist and very chocolatey, and the filling is gooey and sweet. Only thing is the filling might be a little too sweet, and it's a little runny so it oozes out of the sides of the cakes. Next time I'd cut down on the fluff, but other than that they're wonderful!

These were great. The cake isn't overly sweet. I used the 2/3 c cocoa. I made all of the filling but it was way too much. I also added only part of the powdered sugar to the filling, half the butter and threw in some cream cheese. Something I will definitely make again.

Cakes look great and taste great. I hate marshmallow and veg shortening fillings so used cream cheese/peanut butter filling. Way to go. Just like a devil dog.

Also, I don't agree with A Cook at all. You're obviously not very familiar with Amish/Mennonite/Pennsylvania Dutch food! This recipe is very authentic. You're probably used to the awful knock-off versions of whoopie pies that you can find in the grocery store that have a filling that tastes like whipped, fluffy, sugary, bland nothing.

Rating: 4
Wow! Great recipe! I am from a very Pennsylvania dutch family, and these satisfy my tastes. Some say that an authentic whoopie pie does not have marshmallow in it, but I think that it tastes great, and that's al that matters. I had a flash of inspiration while I was making them, though, and I think I made a great addition: I doubled the recipe and I also added a softened 8 ounce package of cream cheese to the filling. It's divine! I think I'm going to be making these a lot more often!

What a disappointment. I consider myself an accomplished baker (I run a cake business) and I was hoping to find a tried-and-true whoopie pie recipe like those I had in my childhood. The cakes on these are dense, gummy, bland and just nothing special. The filling is way too sweet, and I don't believe I've ever used those words together before. It's cloyingly sweet... and goopy to add insult to injury. I made these for a my daughter's school party and I feel like I should send in an apology with them, as this filling will be up to everyone's elbows. The filling I remember them having set up more on it's own, and was more marshmallow-y. I'll continue on my quest for an authentic recipe.

Rating: 2
This recipe is good, however, the filling is way too sweet. I think that the marshmallow cream is too sweet on its own, and to add it to the sugar/butter mixture was just too much. The cookies/cakes were delicious, so if I make this again, I'll probably us a vanilla buttercream frosting for the filling.

Made these for a Super Bowl party and even with all of the other food, they were an absolute favorite hit. Use good dutch process cocoa for deep chocolaty flavor. I would suggest letting the finished pies age a day in airtight containers, as they seem to get a bit more moist and complex.

I made these exactly as written, (except for the size-I used a cookie scoop so all the halves would match, which by the way came out as 20 finished sandwiches with a diameter of about 2 inches across) and I thought they came out perfectly.

This is my official warning to the Mennonite vendors at my local famer's market--watch out because if the recession gets any worse I'm going to have a stand of my own armed with this recipe! These whoopie pies are perhaps the most delicious dessert-style recipe I have ever made. Beware, if made for friends or family don't be surprised if they starting calling around someone's birthday or bake sale fundraiser. I only altered the filling, creating three distinct flavors: mint (flavored with creme de menthe), peanut butter (flavored with aforesaid item) and strawberry (flavored with strawberry extract and fresh cut strawberries). All three were winners! I should note that this would be an excellent first birthday cake-- individual and pleasing to child and adult palettes alike. For an adults-only tasting, I recommend experimenting with the filling: try coconut or banana extract with the real fruit mized in or better yet try adding some Kahlua or Framboise! Make them smaller (but watch the cooking time!) so everyone can get a taste! Thank you, Epicurious!

Very big hit with my friends. I personally found the filling a bit too buttery (the hubby would shun me for such a statement) and sweet. The leftovers were claimed by everyone so I left with an empty container. I'll likely go with a bit less butter and sugar for the filling next time.

Our last tray is just coming out of the oven and, although we haven't tasted the finished product, we did lick the spoons and the batter was wonderful. Not too sweet. I'd suggest using a smaller scoop (I did use the 1/3 measurement and they are much too large), of batter. I don't know how you'd finish a whole pie in one serving. They're large enough to split. And, honestly - who wants to do that? :-)

Hey there in Waynesboro... I gather yours didn't rise well? Anyhoo, these are fantastic. Made exactly as written, and I admit I prefer less filling, although it is delicious. The kiddos of course liked a lot filling. The extra filling is great on sliced apples, BTW.

Very good, quick and easy. The kids especially loved them and requested that they go in the make again file. I can't imagine how big they would be if you only made 8 servings! I made them quite a bit smaller and it made 22! I didn't think the filling was too sweet, but used quite a bit less filling than what is pictured.

Mine did not rise well in the oven. Maybe the baking soda wasn't fresh enough. They were so thin and fragile that I had trouble putting the filling in. Ended up wrapping each in waxed paper and putting each in a plastic sandwich bag and seal without squeezing the air out to cushion them. A little gift for my nephew going off to college tomorrow who loves oreo cookies...They taste GREAT...just messy to make...

I increased the cocoa powder to 2/3 as was sugested and they were delicious. I made them smaller than suggested, in 1/8c mounds, and they were still too big. I bought a small cookie scoop which holds 2t, so that ought to be just the right size for next time. Although the filling was sweet, I didn't find it cloying. When they're smaller, it will seem even less sweet.

I am allergic to wheat and dairy, so I had to make several changes. I found a vegan version of fluf and used vegan margarine instead of butter. I also upped the vanilla flavor by adding vanilla bean seeds. You can find the recipe for wheat free and vegan cakes on The Mini Canteen Blog.

I first ate these 30+ years ago when I went to the university of maine. I have also made these as written at least 20 times and they are always a hit. I make them using a small disher and they are the perfect size for an individual serving. I've also filled them with Nutella cream, but as written is the best.

I've made this recipe over 20 times and it is ALWAYS a hit. The beauty is that the filling doesn't have ANY shortening (like traditional whoopie pies which I can no longer eat!) and little butter compared to other recipes. The cake is moist - as long as not overcooked - and the end product is just delicous. You will be the hit of the party if you make these.

This is a great dessert...basically a cupcake sandwich. I used a vanilla buttercream filling in lieu of the marshmallow fluff. The cakes are not sweet and offset the sugary filling perfectly. I used Kalhua instead of vanilla. My only surprise was it made six cakes not eight, and I weighed the batter for each one on a scale prior to putting on parchment paper. Overall a great dessert, make extras if your having a crowd!

I made these for my boyfriend's birthday, since he LOVES whoopie pies--he was very excited about them, but I thought they were only so-so. The cakes were easy to make but too dense. I made it with the alternative filling suggested by some other reviewers, which I was not pleased with. Before before I added the milk/flour roux to the filling I thought it was good, but once I added the roux it tasted overwhelmingly floury, not at all sweet or rich. I ended up adding a lot more sugar and vanilla to try and mask the floury taste. Did anyone else experience this? The best whoopie pies I've ever had were from my college's dining hall--light, fluffy yet chocolaty cake and rich creamy filling with the perfect amount of sweetness. I'm still looking for a recipe that replicates them.

ALERT!!! MEASUREMENTS ARE OFF - I own the January 2003 issue and in the magazine they tell you to use 2/3 cup Dutch processed cocoa powder. On this website they tell you to only use 1/2 cup of cocoa. USE THE 2/3 cups cocoa! I recently made these using this website, as I was too tired to find the issue in my bookcase, and the pies came out flat. This online recipe is not what was printed in the January 2003 issue.

Rating: 3
The recipe for the cakes is spot on: mild chocolate flavor, with fudgy yet cakey texture that can hold up to being handled. If the recipe was for the cake alone, it would get four forks. However, the filling included with the recipe would be a sweetness overload. The one from bdonovan 1 is perfect, and I've also used a peanut butter filling for something a little different.

Rating: 4
Best whoopie pie ever. I used natural cocoa instead of Dutch process, since that was all I had, and added 1/4 teaspoon more baking soda. Cake was delicious. Definitely bake a little ahead; the cake is better after sitting for a while. And definitely, definitely go with the filling from bdonovan (scroll down five reviews)--just the right amount of sweetness, and very fluffy. Let that sit refrigerated for an hour or two before using as well, so that the powdered sugar taste recedes into the blend of ingredients.

Easy and yummie. Tried to do healthy and used 1T butter and 1 cup of crushed strawberries and 3.4skim milk instead of the buttermilk and butter. Tasted great, so guess it worked! Used strawberry cream cheese frosting and the filling.

This recipe is good, they taste like hohos ha! Well I think that the icing recipe needs to be updated a little, I had to add more powdered sugar (appx. 1/2 c.) in order for the filling to be less runny. I tried the first batch on the cakes and they slid all over. Once I added the powdered sugar they stayed. These taste really yummy!! Can't wait to share them! :-)

These were very tasty. I made them as a trial run for a party next week. I'll be buying a higher quality cocoa, instead of using the plain ol' Hershey's that I had onhand, but I'll be sticking to making smaller pies, since it's a big crowd. This recipe yielded 26 2" whoopie pies, and I also used the frosting recipe left in a review by bdonovan1 from Cape Elizabeth, Maine. I'll paste it here so you don't have to scroll back to find it like I did! ********************* Here's an old fashioned filling that isn't too sweet. Measure 1 cup of whole milk into small saucepan. Add 5 tablespoons of sifted flour. (I use Wondra flour. No lumps) Cook on medium heat until thick. Cool. Cream together 1/2 cup (a stick) butter & 1/2 cup shortening till creamy. Add 1/4 tsp. salt, 1 cup sifted powdered sugar and 1 tsp. vanilla. Mix until all ingredients are incorporated. With mixer on slow speed, add the cooled flour mixture one tablespoon at a time. Beat on medium high for 3 - 4 minutes or until mixture has a fluffy-creamy texture.The filling is ready to use. No oozing out the sides of the cakes! *********** It's a heart-stopper of a frosting, but it;s perfect. Stiff enough not to run away, but fluffy soft.

These were really moist and tasty, though the full teaspoon of salt is a little too heavy. I'd suggest using 3/4 tsp at most. I also used 1/2 special dark cocoa with regular dutch-processed. Such a delicate crumb, very nice and a nostalgic taste of Little Debbie cakes!

This is a yummy recipe. I actually made a Whoopie Pie cake for a friend of mine. I doubled the recipe and made six short layers (two 10", two 8", and two 6"). The batter is difficult to spread into cake pans, but if you use parchment, the batter does expand out nicely into the pans, and the parchment helps the layers pop right out. 12-13 minutes bake time was perfect. It produced a nice soft decadent cake. Also, I used regular cocoa so the chemical reaction would produce a slightly fluffier cake (Well, honestly, I couldn't find dutch process cocoa in my last minute shopping.. here's to procrastinating!) The cream filling was perfect for the in between filling, and I used a regular vanilla butter cream for the outside. Whoopie Pie Cake was a success!

This was my first time making Whoopie pies. I'm glad I used this recipe. They came out perfect. I used a vanilla buttercream frosting as a filling. It was perfect and held up much better then the marshmallow fluff would have I think. Also I used a tablespoon measure for the cake sizes. The 1/4 cup measure was huge! Everyone loved them.

I am in love with Ho-Ho's, Ding Dongs, Swiss Rolls etc. These blow them all out of the water. I did substitute the other filling that was mentioned in the reviews as I am not a fan of marshmallow. The two together made for a very yummy treat. My 6 year old said my name should be Mrs Whoopie because I love them so much I want to marry them!

These pies are DIRTY in a way that only giant cream-filled-chocolate-pie-cookie-sandwiches can be. You know that feeling of imminent cardiac arrest that you sometimes get when you eat something really really really good? Yeah... these pies do that. I will definitely make them again (I thought the initial cream filling recipe was just fine) but maybe next time I'll try to make them a little bit smaller. Or maybe I'll just try to eat one at a time.

The cakes were great although next time I think I'll bake them for 8 or 9 minutes so they're more moist. The filling on the otherhand was extremely sweet so next time I'll try the cooked frosting. I know that recipe and it is sure to make a very good, fluffy, not so sweet filling.

I made these for a Super Bowl party and they were delicious! Also, quite large...I served them on a plate with a fork. I used just one cup of the marshmallow fluff and the creme turned out perfect, not runny at all.

I also made these for a Superbowl Party, and the cakes were fantastic! Also sed Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa, which worked really well. The creme was extremely runny - the tops of the pies kept sliding off. Very tasty, and the aroma of the chocolate was heavenly.

Instead of making one pie with two cakes, I split each cake in half lengthwise and then filled them. Had I followed the recipe's instructions, I would have ended up with obscenely enormous pies. My method more than doubled the stated yield - I brought 20 perfect whoopie pies to a Superbowl Party, and they were a hit! I used Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa in the batter, which made for very intense chocolate flavor. The texture was perfect, with a tender crumb. As for the filling, I added a little more confectioners' sugar to stiffen it up. And it worked like a charm - I had no problems with it being runny or tasting too cloyingly sweet. Thanks, epicurious, for another wonderful recipe. This one's a keeper!

This was very good more than I expected. I used Nesle cocoa, but it's exceptionally sweet. And I made a vanilla cream with just sugar powder, butter and vanilla instead of marshmallow. Next time, I'll try it again with marshmallow stuff, it'll be good...

This is a great recipe. For many years, I used a recipe passed down from my mom, but I really like the recipe for the cakes in this one. Also, I'm very familiar with the filling recipe from bdonovan1 from Cape Elizabeth, Maine. My mom is from Biddeford, ME and calls that filling Poor Man's frosting. We've used this recipe for years to frost cakes. It's light and fluffy and not too sweet.

This recipe is the best yet. They are especially good after sitting, airtight, the next day. They have that old fashioned bakery taste.(be sure to use good cocoa. Hershey's is great) I will not be searching for any more whoopie pie recipe's. These are IT! However, I think half the filling recipe is plenty for one batch of these, Unless you prefer a whole lot of filling! Easily a 4 fork recipe.

This recipe makes the best whoopie pies I have ever had (including bakeries). You have to follow the recipe exactly as is it says. Put the filling in the center of the cakes and don't put too much in and you won't have the problem of it spilling out or sliding off.

Took to a picnic and it was a huge hit. Since these are so decadent, I made mini cakes. Followed the cake recipe and made 48 cakes (24 cookies). I too used the filling from bdonovan1 from Cape Elizabeth, Maine. I found it was not sweet enough so I added a little more powdered sugar. Otherwise it was perfect! Thanks for the recommendation!

Great recipe, no problems whatsoever with the cake and filling. These also make excellent Ice cream sandwiches!!!. Just slightly thaw your ice cream. Place a scoop in the middle of the cookie portion, place another on top. Wrap and freeze until firm.

bdonovan1 from Cape Elizabeth, Maine you are a angel! Thank you so much for sharing the old-fashioned cream filling recipe -- you brought me right back to my childhood! I grew up in Western MA and these decadent treats were sold in a little corner shop near my home. The owner's wife made them every now and again and she would bring them from the back of the store just as our elementary school let out of class for the day...they were gone before she could set them on the counter. Recipe review: I halved the recipe and initially made the Fluff frosting. The cake was delightful, the filling was not. It was nowhere near the lightly sweetened, silky, fluffiness I remembered from my childhood. It was far too sugary, runny, tacky and rather unpleasant to eat and work with. 2nd attempt: I halved the recipe, and was again delighted by the texture and taste of the cake. I followed bdonovan1's cream filling and could not stop raving *except to take bites!* I can finally share a little east coast treat with my southern california cohorts. This IS the perfect whoopie pie recipe. *if made with the old-fashioned cream filling*

After moving from Maine, where whoopie pies are a convenience store staple, to New Mexico 8 years ago, I've searched high and low for a great recipe but have not been satisfied til I tried this one tonight. Truly perfect, the best I've ever had. I did manage to find Droste cocoa, and made a double batch for my partner's birthday - he wanted to take some cake to work, and these are just so easy to transport! I didn't find the filling too sweet or too goopy, but I didn't use an excessive amount, and I think it would have been both if I had. For all those before me who've cut the amount of confectioners sugar and expected the filling to remain as thick - confectioners sugar plays an important role in thickening. frostings. Cutting it would be like putting less flour or cornstarch in your gravy and expecting it not to be watery. Anyway, this recipe has a definite permanent place in my family's kitchen.

My husband and I have a tendency to get a whoopie pie at every bakery we pass. We consider ourselves whoopie pie connosseiurs ;) We both agreed that these were the best we have ever had. I added about 5 ounces of Rapunzel dark chocolate organic choclate chips to the cake mix for texture and used Tiny Trapeze vanilla marshmellow creme in lieu of fluff (oth found at Whole Foods). I also sprinkled them with confectioners sugar. My husband thinks it was the marshmellow creme that made them so fabulous, however I think it was the chocolate chips. I do agree that the filling is a bit runny. I think next time I will add some more confectioners sugar to stiffen it up.

Rating: 3
These are awesome - they make everyone feel like a kid. I made them for a SuperBowl party and they were a huge hit. Three tips: 1) Monitor baking time to prevent cracks on the cake tops, 2) Buy one fresh, small jar of Fluff and use the whole thing. The stuff is just too sticky to measure out, and a fresh container has the best consistency compared to the one that's been on your shelf for a year, and 3) Split the effort over 2 days, making the cakes first, and the filling on the day of serving. Wrap them up individually in wax paper for transport and easy serving and eating.

I haven't yet made this recipe--but I believe it to be "Gobs" or something like it. I used to pester my mother to make them ALL THE TIME. They were so troublesome to make, made such a mess, and such a volume of them, that she usually resisted. Sprinkle them w/powdered sugar! 2 die 4!

A little messy, but fun to make and delicious.

These were by far the most amazing things I have ever tasted as far as desserts are concerned. Although they are indeed messy, the flavor is beyond compare. The cakes are super moist, and they are definitely better the second day. These would also be good with a dollop of cherry or raspberry pie filling sandwiched in with the marshmallow creme.

Here's an old fashioned filling that isn't too sweet. Measure 1 cup of whole milk into small saucepan. Add 5 tablespoons of sifted flour. (I use Wondra flour. No lumps) Cook on medium heat until thick. Cool. Cream together 1/2 cup (a stick) butter & 1/2 cup shortening till creamy. Add 1/4 tsp. salt, 1 cup sifted powdered sugar and 1 tsp. vanilla. Mix until all ingredients are incorporated. With mixer on slow speed, add the cooled flour mixture one tablespoon at a time. Beat on medium high for 3 - 4 minutes or until mixture has a fluffy-creamy texture.The filling is ready to use. No oozing out the sides of the cakes!

Rating: 2
This is for the person who remembers the filling as being not as sweet as the newer "fluff" fillings. The old filling was a cooked filling- and indeed more of a creme filling than frosting. I found this website and the recipe looks very similar to what my mother made when I was growing up... I'm still searching for her recipe and will post when I find it- because it is sooo much better than this one... http://teriskitchen.com/cookies/whoopie-a.html

This was the first time i ever made or tasted a whoopie pie, which was very good. My family tried and also enjoyed the pie although we all had the same problem while eating it, the filling oozing out. I added about 2/3 cups of confectioners sugar to cut the sweetness in the in the filling and am still working to fix the problem of the filling flowing out of the whoopie pie. Eventhough this was messy to eat it was very delicous and in the end the taste is what matters, so i would definitly make this again.

Rating: 4
After reading the comments I decided the only sensible thing was to make these EXACTLY by the recipe (except that I can only find reduced fat buttermilk in Mass.). The cakes were perfect, not too flat, not too round. I had no problem with the filling being too runny or nor did I find it too sweet. My guest, who really doesn't like sweet for sweet's sake, loved these -- ate a whole one by herself and is still raving about them 4 months later.

Rating: 3
I found these whoopie pies to be very similar to what I was hoping for. I did cut the confectioners sugar to 3/4 cups, mixed the fluff (I used one whole jar of Kraft Marshmellow Creme) last, and refrigerated the frosting for about 10 minutes before spreading and there were no problems with consistency. For the cakes I used an ice cream scoop which was the perfect size, although I cut the baking time down to 7 minutes and the cakes were almost too moist. I would definitely make this recipe again and would bake for 9 minutes.

To Iredin in Seattle: Use bread flour for your cookies! It prevents them from flattening & keeps them chewy. I also bake mine for 7 to 9 minutes, because they continue to cook even after you take thme out of the oven

Rating: 3
I sort of made the "cake" portion twice--whenever I make cookies, I have to add a little more flour than the recipe calls for otherwise they turn out flat and cripy rather than thick and moist (is this true for anyone else?). That is what happened with the first round of these little cakes. The second round turned out great, but I will definitely make them MUCH smaller the next time. The filling compliments the cookies nicely, but needs to be refrigerated for a few hours before assembling the cookies to avoid mess.

Delicious and simple, like a homemade Hostess Cupcake, which I happen to like. The filling was very runny, but some time in the freezer fixed that. Used Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa and the flavor was quite rich.

We refrigerated the filling for several hours and it was great! Friends who didn't want filling couldn't stop eating the cookies plain. We had plenty of filling left over, and had fun finding uses for it (my six year old used it to make double decker oreos, putting the filling inbetween oreos).

Wonderful recipe--it is great for kids and great for adults...When having a dinner party for adults, I let each guest fill his pie to his or her liking...I simply supply the spreader, individual bowl of filling and of course the cake-cookies. I found it a lot easier to use an ice cream scoop when baking the dough...This way I can have a small or very large pie depending on the occasion.

Everyone enjoyed these, kids as well as adults. I doubled the recipe and it worked out well. The only thing I would change next time is to make them smaller. The filling is runny but refrigerating first and not overfilling cakes will solve the problem.

Not a big hit. While everyone was polite to try it no one went back for seconds and I made them small. I did cut down on the powdered sugar like everyone said and it was really sweet still but the flavor did nothing for the decent chocolate cakes.

We made these pies and they were a mild success. Kids loved them, adults found them too sweet. A few things: 1. We omitted the confectioners sugar in the filling b/c it would be too sweet. Good choice. 2. We used Hershey's Cocoa; suggest you use dark Dutch cocoa for rich color. 3. The filling is very messy & gooey at room temp. We chilled them & used toothpicks to keep them from sliding apart! 4. Don't think the stick of butter is nec. for the filling. Either use all fluff or a mixture of fluff and light whipping cream.

YUM! Very Sweet and easy dessert to make. I liked the filling. Will use the filling again for another purpose.

Yum. My kids and husband love these. And after I took some to a friend, she called me "evil" for forcing them on her. (Then she asked for the recipe.) The only thing that's been bothering me is that I think the cookies should be a little flatter. Put together with filling, they were almost spherical. I tried reducing the amount of soda by half, but there was no difference. Any ideas?

Rating: 4
I've made these twice now and these are some tips: if you reduce size of cakes, reduce baking time by few minutes. To make the frosting not run, chill first. I used Valhrona cocoa first time ($10) and they turned out great - deep chocolate color and sort of nutty flavor. I found Droste cocoa ($6.49) in the supermarket near the chocolate milk syrup. Have yet to try this. These do taste better the next day so make the frosting the next day and chill for an hour before filling cakes. Reduce the powdered sugar a little and cream first with butter before adding fluff to get a smooth frosting. Still love these!

Sent these to a Super Bowl party and the plate came back empty...always a good sign. I didn't much care for them, but I don't like marshmellow...I made them small and got about 14 sandwiches out of the recipe, everyone agreed any bigger would have made them sick. I also hate clowns...something not right about a constantly smiling face, in fact that's a sign of mental illness!

While the recipe for the cakes was fine - I was extremely disappointed in the filling. Overly sweet, gooey and sticky. Definately NOT the whoopie pie filling I remember from my childhood. Perhaps this is a regional thing - the whoopie pies I remember buying at Lancaster County farmers markets had a creamy filling, I suppose more like a whipped icing. That said, I would make the cakes again. But, can anyone suggest a better filling?

As another reviewer suggested, I cut back on the powdered sugar in the filling to 3/4 cup and it was still plenty sweet.

What on earth does your problem with clowns have to do with this recipe?

Well then, having read the other reviews, I went ahead and softned a single packet of un-flavored gelatin in about 2 tablespoons of warm water and added it to the filling, which I then chilled for 4 hours and it worked like a charm. Will be making these for a long time to come...

After reading other reviews about the filling being too soft and sweet, I subbed 4 oz. cream cheese for 1 cup marshmallow fluff in a double batch. I think this may have helped both problems, as it tasted good and was not runny. Overall, I think this is a keeper - easy and yummy!

Made these for a dinner party dessert and everyone loved them!! After reading a few of the other reviews I cut down the confectioners sugar by 1/3, so they weren't overwhelmed by the sugar taste. Didn't have any problems with the filling being too soft, and the cakes stayed nice and moist. Will definitely make again!

After reading the rave reviews, I really thought these would be better than they were. I found the cake to be too dry and the filling to be too sweet (less confectioners would be better). I also found that the filling should have been chilled before topping the cakes, as it was way too thin and dripped off them and onto everything around them. My husband enjoyed them once they were chilled though.

Whoopie Pies are a Super Bowl tradition in our family. We found the recipe several years ago in an amish cookbook(!) and since then they've been a favorite. During the Super Bowl, with a couple of batches at the ready, when there's a big play, you yell "Whoopie!" and everyone gets a pie. Makes the game more exciting when your team's not in it, that's for sure.
