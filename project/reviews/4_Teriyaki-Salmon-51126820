Used broccoli instead of brussel sprouts (husband doesn't like) and portabella instead of shiitake (product availability). Used all of the sauce on the salmon for marinade instead of what they suggested then made a little extra a the end. We loved it!

This was really yummy. The salmon was cooked to perfection. I only made it for 4 people but I kept the sauce and vegetable amounts the same. If I was making it for 6 I think I would have needed more sauce. I served it with mashed potoates spiked with a little wasabi powder.

Is the first ingredient supposed to be low-sodium SOY sauce instead of teriyaki sauce? Seems odd.

I thought this recipe was delicious! I did not cook the salmon on top of the brussel sprouts, but pushed the to the edges and added mushrooms to them. cooked salmon in middle.
