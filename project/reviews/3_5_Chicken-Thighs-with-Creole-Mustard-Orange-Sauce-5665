Husband and kids loved it! Easy! Fast! Served it with jasmine rice and a side of quickly sauteed green pepper, onion and celery. Added some orange zest, which looked pretty, too. I doubled the recipe and agree that it takes longer than stated to thicken the sauce. Delicious!

Tasty-quick, yummy with an extra star for the quickness! One reviewer did not make the recipe as he or she thought it would be too sweet, so she suggested duck and all kinds of other changes. I would say this is NOT an overly sweet recipe, would others agree or disagree? With the grainy mustard, it doesn't seem too sweet at all to me - and I don't like fruity sweet chicken dishes.

Not as orangey as I might like but tasty nonetheless. I might add some orange peel next time.

A good recipe that'd be better, as written, with the rich flavor of duck rather than chicken. I knew it'd be too orangey & sweet for chicken, even thighs, so I used tomato juice instead of orange & added fresh thyme & garlic, plus a bit of balsamic. Turned out good. OK. I guess I didn't really make this recipe, lol, but I would ... with duck. But I'd add ginger. Cooking is fussing to taste, & this is the best website for ideas!!

Easy recipe that delivers great flavor. I made with package of 12 thighs so I doubled the sauce -- didn't need to do that. No changes to the recipe -- reducing, thickening the sauce took a while longer that the 7 minutes, but don't skip this step. This is perfect weekday dinner for family or for company.

Rating: 4
Delicious as is! I made some Israeli couscous...cooked in chicken broth with finely diced onion, garlic and some chopped up leftover broccoli...served the chicken and sauce over it and it was very good. I'm thinking the sauce, prepared without the chicken in it, would be tasty over grilled salmon.

Rating: 4
I made this exactly as called for in the recipe and it was very good. For flavor and presentation, I would give it 3 forks, but I give it an extra fork because it is so easy and fast to prepare and because I was able to make it with ingredients I generally have on hand. I might try more hot sauce next time because we like a bit more kick. I also prefer chicken breasts to thighs, so might do that next time, but obviously reduce the cooking time.

Rating: 4
If you stick to the recipe you get a wonderfully complex combination of flavors and some very tender morsels of dark meat chicken. My only deviation from the recipe was to hold it covered, in a 325 degree oven for about half an hour. Served with brown rice.

This is an easy and quick recipe yet packed with flavor. The sweet spicy orange sauce is delicious. I use the chicken thighs as per recipe which are tender and flavorful, but a chicken breast would work well if looking to cut a few calories. I used sambal olek as the hot sauce. This is now a regular dish at our house.

This was a very quick and easy dinner to make -- the leftovers the following day were even better. Four forks because I really liked the sauce -- very nice combination of sweet and spicy. I used Grey Poupon Country Dijon, a couple tablespoons of Sambal Oelek, and because I didn't have any honey, I used a little bit of Truvia. I also added just a little extra chicken broth. As suggested by other cooks, after I browned and removed the chicken, I sauteed a sliced onion and red bell pepper in the same skillet. I then added the broth, mustard, sambal and returned the chicken to the pan. Served it with rice and broccoli. Really fabulous. I have a little extra sauce left I'm going to try with some pork chops tonight.

Delicious mustard sauce. Looked for a recipe for chicken thighs. In a quick half hour had a delicious meal. Added sauteed garlic and onions. Threw in some frozen broccoli to steam alongside the chicken while it was going through its last heating stage. Definitely would make this again.

Yummy!!! Plenty of tweaking you can do on the sauce to get it just right! Yes, crank the heat and have some patience for the sauce to thicken!

This was super tasty and so easy. Cranking up the heat helped the sauce to reduce relatively quickly, though seven minutes might be a bit of an underestimate. Such a great and flavorful weeknight meal!

Once again, Yum! I steamed really fresh, chopped broccoli rabe alongside. I didn't add salt, butter or anything and, it was a perfect healthy meal! Together the flavors were great.

This was a definite winner. I did what some fellow reviewers did and sauteed onion, garlic, and red pepper in the chicken drippings before adding in all of the sauce ingredients, and it turned out wonderfully. Took WAY longer than 7 minutes to really reduce the sauce down to the right consistency. I served it with wild rice and steamed broccoli, and all of the flavors mingled really well. Great recipe.

Rating: 4
This was a surprisingly good recipe to stumble upon after 11 years as an Epicurious member - a new way to prepare 3 lbs. of boneless chicken thighs I had in the fridge. Made this all in a large Cuisinart electric skillet, browning the chicken in two batches, and doubling the sauce ingredients. As an other reviewer suggested, also sauteed sliced onions and red bell pepper to add interest. Did that on high heat after browning the chicken, and before adding the sauce ingredients. Sauce reduced down to perfection after about 10 minutes on high heat, with frequent stirring. Accompanied with haricots vert in just a bit of butter, and basmati rice. Will definitely repeat.

Spicy and delicious, and an easy weeknight meal. I sauteed onions, red bell pepper and mushrooms before the chicken to give it some more heft, used fresh squeezed juice oranges and sambal oelek for the spice factor, and served it with wild rice. yum.

I made this recipe exactly as stated but it just didn't have that something special or "oomph". I liked the flavor of the sauce but it never quite thickened up enough for my tastes and I didn't want to add any more honey as I thought it was pretty sweet already. I may try it again and play around a bit making some modifications.

Great flavors, nice contrast of sweet and spicy. I used sriracha as my hot pepper sauce, and doubled the amount to increase the heat. Tasted great, was very, very easy to make. The sauce did take considerably longer to thicken than was indicated in the recipe, but the end result was worth the wait. I will definitely make this again.

This was good, but we found the sauce pretty bland. We could hardly taste the hot pepper sauce at all. I would double the hot pepper sauce for sure.

This is great! So easy and tasty - 3.5 forks! I make it with boneless skinless breasts (for me) and thighs (for my fiance). Just make sure not to overcook the breasts, depending on how thick they are. This has definitely made it into my regular rotation and is a great weeknight meal.

I did it with boneless skinless chicken breasts and it was quite delicious! 3.5 forks if there was such a thing. Made it with cornbread which was just right. Definitely don't need to double the sauce if doubling the meat. There was something creamy about this which reminded me of having creamed chicken, but without all the extra fat. Will make again!

Really good. I doubled the recipe, but found out, as did an earlier reviewer, that it is not necessary to double the sauce. Would be good served with a side of sauteed southern greens & onions. It made good left-overs on a bed of spinach.

Used turkey thighs, so I had to braise it a bit longer. Didn't salt the chicken (don't salt anything I can avoid), and I think the honey helps caramelize the sauce. I was called away and the sauce looked scorched, but it was fine and tasty!

OK, I'm new to this site but I have found the many reviews VERY helpful! So I made this recipe andit was good, only too salty due to my own fault: used salt on chicken, then salty Dijon country mustard AND salt in the canned chicken broth. However, orange juice cuts the saltiness when reheating leftovers, I also discovered. Added a finely cut shallot to oil before the chicken and by the time the chicken had cooked, it had become toasted and I thought ruined but it tasted delicious so I left it in. Otherwise followed the recipe except for omitting the honey as I figured the orange juice was enough sweetness. Good recipe! I'll make it again.

great recipe! i decided to use blood orange puree instead of regular orange juice and it turned out great!

I cut this somewhat in half. I used just two bone in thighs (pulled the skin before serving)and 1/2 cup of homemade chicken broth and 1/2 cup of orange juice. Prior to adding the liquids, I deglazed the pan with some sherry and shallots. I used bone in chicken, so I let the chicken simmer for a bit. I did have Creole mustard, but not honey, so I added some turbinado. I served it with some 7 grain pilaf and asparagus.It was tasty...

Rating: 4
Followed almost exactly. I used bone-in with skin chicken thighs and obviously had to cook them a little longer. I doubled the recipe but had a little too much sauce. Next time I'll double the chicken and just do 1.5 times the sauce. Husband and I both enjoyed.

Didn't have orange juice, so we used some leftover white zinfandel wine and it turned out great! We're looking forward to trying it with the OJ, but found that this was a great way to use a sweeter wine that we otherwise would not drink. Very tasty, and will definitely become a regular -- won't say it's a company dish, but something that's easy and reliable for every day.

This recipe's chief advantages are that it's quick, cheap, and can be made with standard pantry items, which makes it an ideal choice for last-minute weeknight meals. It isn't out of this world, but it's tasty enough and nutritious. I add several cloves of garlic to liven it up.

I'm surprised this recipe got such great reviews. I really was not that big of a fan. I thought it was okay, but that's about it. I can see it being better with whole chicken breast or thighs with the skin and bone, but this just didn't really do it for me. Maybe some onions would have helped. For me, it was an eh. I probably won't make it again even with tweaks.

I give this 4 forks because it is: (1) delicious; (2) surprisingly simple to make; and, (3) capable of being made at the last minute.

This just joined our regular rotation.

One of our favorites!! Tastes a big "gourmet" but so easy. Instead of (and sometimes in addition to) hot pepper sauce, i use a 1/4 cup of homemade chili sauce to give it even more of a "creole" flavor.

I used frozen thighs so initially I sauteed longer than suggested. After adding the broth and juice I simmered on med heat until the liquid was reduced by 1/2. I then added the remaining ingredients and again simmered until reduced in half again. This made the sauce very thick and gravy like and concentrated all the flavor. It was great and everyone in the family liked it.

I needed a chicken recipe in a pinch, because I was out of one of the ingredients for the recipe I had planned to make. This recipe was quick and easy (important because I have CFIDS, and therefore not as much energy as I would like for cooking), and did not contain any of the many things my children are allergic to. Another big plus - it didn't require any esoteric ingredients; I was able to make it from things I already had on hand. I used pineapple-orange juice instead of straight orange juice, because that's what we had, and homemade turkey stock instead of canned broth, and both of my sons (7yo and 9yo) thought it was fabulous. My youngest said "Mom, you're the best cook ever!" This will definitely be going into our regular rotation.

My family enjoyed the chicken: I didn't have OJ so used a can of mandarin oranges (blended) and this seemed to work just fine. As the oranges were in a light syrup, I didn't add the honey-also used a citron dijon mustard I had sitting around and followed other reviewer's advice: added garlic and onion and let the thighs simmer in the sauce until falling apart... good solid eating-great for a weeknight or in this case, in the middle of a snow storm!

I have made this dish quite a few times. I always used thighs with skin and bones and let them cook in the sauce until the meat pretty much fell off the bones, this way the chicken really gets infused with flavor. Also I added onion, garlic, white wine and a little lemon juice, discharged of the skin before serving, because it doesn't look pretty after all that cooking.Placed it on a bed of linguine and garnished with fresh parsley. Yummy!

So easy and a great use of chicken thighs. They were loved by everyone- including the picky children. It was so quick and tasty it has joined the usual rotation.

I picked this recipe out because I wanted something quick to cook for the fiancee after we both had a long day at work. It turned out amazingly good, with a hefty kick, and was very easy to make. I doubled the ingredients for the sauce, used whole-grain dijon mustard, added some garlic, and used one teaspoon of "The Hottest F*cking Sauce" as well as a couple of dashes of Sriracha. That was definitely enough heat, and the way the chicken and the sauce worked together was fantastic. This one is definitely a keeper.

I needed a quick recipe and this one seemed to due just fine. I didn't have grainy mustard so I used what I had on hand - dijon. I had a very spicy harissa in the fridge that I used for the hot sauce. Aside from a couple misgivings, the dish was very delicious. The extra sauce was spooned over simply steamed bulgur. I will definitely add this to my repertoire.

I've made this many times, usually when I have too many oranges lying around and need to use them up. I have used store-bought oj before and the flavor is different, I would use less of it (oj) in that case. Usually add garlic, sometimes sauteed mushrooms, and vary the spices and mustards. I have found the key (especially when doubling or tripling the sauce) is to take plenty of time to reduce the liquids....delish! A really satisfying dish that everyone loves.

Really enjoyed this dish. Easy to make too. Additions I made: 1 chopped clove of garlic(I had roasted qarlic on hand)I added it with the liquids. Also used 1 chopped chipotle pepper in adobo sauce (open can in my refrig) Added this along with the hot sauce, honey, creole mustard. Next time I make this I'll only use 1/2 cup OJ & 1 cup chicken stock. I also use some Wondra the help thicken the sauce. Served with a rice dish- rice with peas. My son thought rice with raisens would go very well. I agree & will try it next time.

Excellent dish, a great use of chicken thighs I had accidentally bought for a white meat dish. My teenage son remarked that it tasted like a quail dish.

I just served with plain white rice- with the sauce over it. and some green beans and we had a great weeknight dinner. This is a keeper! For the mustard I used a very grainy Grey Poupon and it worked great.

We all loved this. I doubled the recipe and added garlic and mushrooms. It took a bit of time to reduce the sauce but in the end the flavor was addicting and the sauce was smooth. Might add a bit more heat next time. I used french's bold and spicy mustard because it's what I had. Do try it!

We loved this dish. However, it made a mess of my kitchen! Be prepared to clean up tons of spattered oil. I put on a spatter screen, too late. I might try this as a bbq sauce by partially cooking bone in thighs and drumsticks and then grilling. I baste my bbq chicken in the last few minutes with sauce to avoid excessive burning.

This is an absolutely wonderful dish. Flavorful, full-bodied, and easy to make. I did not have chicken broth, but had on hand a frozen pre-made duck stock which I used instead. I also used regular dijon mustard, not the one with seeds, and it turned out just fine. What I like about the dish is that it doesn't have as much fat as other chicken dishes with sauce because you're using skinless meat, olive oil instead of butter, and no cream sauce, even though the sauce produced by this recipe is quite rich-tasting. It's a keeper!

I made this last night with bone-in, skin-on thighs (it's what I had) and it was fabulous. I also changed the hot sauce to caynne, again because it's what I had.

This was great! I wholeheartedly agree with the previous reviewer, this recipe is delicious, simple and seemingly foolproof (seemingly). the mix of sweet, tart, and spicy flavors was well balanced.

Another recipe I love and another that makes me scratch my head at those who've had problems. This is insanely easy to make, has a great blend of flavors, and is one of my easy favorites; I've made this at least 10 times over the last 2 years. My tips: - I leave the skin on; more fat, but it crisps up great and really adds to the flavor. If you leave it on, cook it well to begin with (deep brown on both sides), so you don't have to heat it too long in sauce where the skin could get soft. - I've used both yellow and smooth dijon mustards; nothing fancy, both store brands (Kroger). - Turn the heat to med-hi/hi when reducing the sauce and let it boil; it will take about 5-10 minutes. - You may want to increase the quantity of sauce, maybe make 25-50% extra

This was very easy, very quick and the family liked it. I used regular dijon mustard so we didn't have texture issues with the sauce. Served with rice pilaf, a nice, easy winter dish.

Fast and easy. Used chicken breasts and cut into strips for faster browning. Also added Jamaica Jerk seasoning to chicken. Used a little less Dijon. Have fun with the juice. I used 5 Alive Mango. I bet Pinapple juice or Papaya would be good. Have fun with this recipe and enjoy

Where can you find a recipe on epicurious that doesn't involve chopping or mincing?:)) Here! I made this as a do-ahead before picking up my parents from the airport. At first, I wasn't thrilled by it, but as it sat for a few hours, the flavors came together better. Definitely use thighs. I used thighs and breasts since my parents don't eat dark meat. The breasts were dry and the thighs were great. It's and OK recipe for a weeknight - nothing too special, but the ease of it makes it worth it.

Rating: 3
Great quick dish with dinner party possibilities. I made a bit more sauce as I had about 20 oz. of thighs but probably didn't need to. Only change that I made was to add some roasted garlic to sauce when adding mustard, etc. (I always roast more than I need and keep in fridge for this type of thing) and to add more hot sauce - Crystal. Next time will probably use spicier hot sauce due to personal preference and a bit less honey. Served over white rice mixed with toasted pine nuts and chopped, fresh basil (on this site), and a spinach salad. Great meal, wonderful presentation on plate. For company would try duck breasts.

I loved the sauce for this. I did use chicken breasts instead of thighs. I think thighs would be juicier though so I will use them next time. Served with pickled Orkra and braised zucchini. Delicious!

Rating: 3
Thought this was very interesting and flavourful and super easy. Sophisticated dish for very little effort. I used 8 chicken thighs (they were on sale!) instead of 4. Also used the exact ingredients called for, but was worried that the mustard would overwhelm the entire thing so I used 3 TBS instead of a full quarter-cup. Also used only 1/2 a tsp of hot sauce. Next time (which will probably be next week!), I won't be so bashful. I also used only 2 tsp of olive oil as I'm counting points. My husband and I loved it! In fact, I brought the last of it to work for lunch today!

This was an easy and very tasty meal that is definitely a keeper. I would use boneless breast or pork loin to mix it up a little. I doubled the sauce and it was plenty for 3 times the meat. This is a recipe you can play with and make it to your own taste, but is very good just the way it is. The lack of leftovers was a good indicator of that!

I previously submitted a review to this recipe but didn't rate it because I didn't do everything right -- wrong mustard, etc. Anyway, my husband and I both like this now (I liked it fine all along). I add extra hot sauce (not TOO much) to give it a little more complexity and let the sauce cook for a bit more than seven minutes I think, to get it nice and thick. I think it's a delicious and simple weeknight meal.

This chicken dish is very good, and probably does actually verge on "delicious." I skinned the thighs, but didn't bone them; next time I'd buy them already boned. I followed the recipe as written, but added three small garlic cloves to the browning chicken, removed them when lightly browned, and then put them back in the simmering sauce. At the end, they were soft and I mashed them into the sauce. I needed to use orange juice from frozen concentrate which is probably why my sauce wasn't overly sweet as it might have been if I had my very sweet oranges ready to pick from my tree. I feel the success of the sauce depends on patience in reducing it rather than thickening by any method. It really does thicken nicely in time.

Rating: 2
Overall this dish does not present itself well. I would flour the chicken before frying to give it a browner, crisper, texture. This may also help with the thickening of the sauce that so many other readers had difficulty with. I prefer more of a "glaze" rather than a thin sauce. This would also greatly enhance the flavor. I too served over rice.

Rating: 3
This was so good - the sauce was heavenly. Served it with a pilaf of brown rice and mushrooms - could have made a meal of the pilaf and sauce except the chicken was so good too! I will join the other cooks who are puzzled by the disparity in reviews - either it's personal taste, or perhaps choice of ingredients. I used Zatarain's Creole Mustard and Louisiana brand hot sauce, with excellent results.

I thought this was GREAT! I'm not an orange lover in cooking, so I was a bit concerned that the orange would be overwhelming, but decided to go forth! I had 6 thighs, so I increased the broth and the OJ to 1 cup each. I increased the mustard to about 1/2 cup. I stuck with a scant tablespoon of honey b/c I was worried about it being too sweet from the OJ. I used 2 tsp of Ass Kickin' Hot Sauce (I don't like the flavor of this sauce by itself, but it was fine to add the heat, and it's what I had in the cupboard.) I made sure to brown the thighs really well, so there were lots of brown bits in the pan to deglaze. I think this helped the sauce to thicken. I also added a couple of garlic cloves to the browning step. I had no trouble thickening the sauce after bringing it to a pretty robust boil. I served it with jasmine rice tossed with scallions. If I had them on hand, I would have also served some snow peas on the side. Although this dish is Creole, it seems to also have an Asian flair to my taste. I think it's the grainy mustard that makes this dish, plus the hot sauce, with a bit of sweetness to balance it all. I saw some reviewers cut back on the mustard to 2 tsp; I can only say it would be a very different dish. Perhaps increasing the mustard as I did also changed it significantly...but I'll do it again this way b/c it was terrific and there were no leftovers!

Rating: 3
This is a very basic recipe, but it's a good one. I would bet that the cooks who didn't like it had trouble thickening the sauce: The recipe doesn't work as well in a nonstick skillet. Use a heavy, regular saucepan, and just turn the heat up to high if it resists thickening. I'd give this recipe four forks if I could figure out which fresh green herb would be ideal for brightening up the fairly rich sauce. Lemon sorrel?

Rating: 3
This is a good recipe according to my criteria. The ingredients aren't too exotic, the steps are very basic and the preparation quick. The result is a tasty and sophisticated, special dish. The chicken thighs, even without the skin and fat, are succulent. Pound them with a meat mallot and they are even better. I did serve it with homemade cornbread and string beans and liked the meal a lot.

This was WONDERFUL. My boyfriend and I loved it. I used bone-in chicken thighs because that is all I had and it was still great. I used fresh-squeezed orange juice, and added a little bit more than the recipe recommended. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly (served over white rice-yum!) and was VERY pleased. I would make this again in a heartbeat and plan on doing so soon!

We absolutely loved this! I made it with pork rather than chicken and used fresh squeezed orange juice and a regular dijon mustard rather than whole grain. I also mixed some of the sauce in with baby potatoes and it was all very delicious and so easy! Because of the simplicity, this could be a weeknight staple for us, yet is good enough to serve to company :)

This was intriguing. At first my husband, who does not like sweet sauces with meat, did not care for this. As he ate, though, he changed his mind. My daughter and I loved this. It would also be very good with pork chops

The people who didn't like this dish obviously prefer bland, processed food to dishes that are more complex and more rewarding taste-wise. For those of you who prefer Kraft mac & cheese, chicken nuggets and vegetables from a can, DON'T make this dish. It's too sophisticated and complicated for you. For the others - this is a wonderful recipe that I've served a number of times to dinner guests and family. Many have requested not only seconds, but the recipe itself. Use good quality mustard, and do use dark meat. It's more flavorful and more forgiving than white meat, which tends to dry out and is bland-tasting.

It's interesting reading some of the negative reviews for this dish. You were either using poor ingredients or your technique suffered.

Loved it. I sauteed minced shallots, garlic, and mushrooms to start. Any of you Penzey's fans will appreciate this -- used Florida Pepper seasoning on the chicken about an hour before cooking. Also used beef broth instead of chicken and probably more mustard (whole-grain) and honey. Thought the sauce reduced just fine, didn't take long at all.

Excellent, Easy, delicious dinner. The sauce takes time to thicken so keep that in mind. I love this sauce and I lick my plate clean! Tried subbing regular dijon mustard once and that was a HUGE mistake. Don't bother making it unless you have the right ingredients. Fresh squeezed orange juice is fab!

This was very good and I will definitely make it again. I used bone-in thighs (too lazy to debone the chicken) and it was fine. ALso, I did leave out the hot sauce and added a few cloves of garlic instead. We had it over rice and even the kids liked it. Served it with steamed broccolli and salad with vinegarette dressing.

I thought that this was delicious and my guest did as well! I went heavier on the oranges because I didn't have enough stock and the oranges were plentiful on my tree. It took a little longer to thicken the sauce but well worth the wait. I may double the sauce in the future as that is what makes the chicken. I also used breasts instead of thighs.

This is a very good recipe, easy to make, and with minimal ingredients. It's become a regular at our diner table. I prefer to use whole grain mustard, but regular dijon works well. If you use chicken breasts, don't sautee quite as long -- this will dry out the chicken. I strongly recommend this chicken recipe.

I was looking for a recipe using boneless chicken thighs--this is DELICIOUS! We all loved it; took a while to reduce the sauce but it was worth every minute. Excellent piquant flavors. I served it over rice and did not change any of the ingredients though had to increase them because I was cooking for husband and three grown sons. Will cook this again soon. Thank you!!

Very good..i made many substitutions. I used boneless, skinless breasts and dusted them with a flour, salt, black and cayenne pepper mixture. Sauteed until almost done, then added juice of whole tangelo, cajun mustard, and a small dab of garlic/jalapeno paste. Added honey and a tiny dab of flour in the last 2 minutes, and the sauce turned out perfect.

I did not read the other reviews until after making this recipe. I am not sure what some of the cooks used for "hot pepper sauce." I used a Habanero Chili sauce. It sure was spicy enough. I loved it, but the women in the house said it had great flavor, but too hot. If you cook the chicken until it is really done (using a thermometer)you will run out of sauce. I had to add more orange juice, chicken broth, and honey. I made the mistake of adding more habanero sauce, which I will not do next time. And there will surely be a next time! Fabulous flavor.

This was a great dish. I didn't realize we were out of OJ when I started, but substituted some fresh squeezed tangelos (only citrus in the house). I doubled the recipet and it worked well. I also added some mushrooms and garlic. You can taste and correct the sauce while it simmers. It was not at all like a sweet and sour as someone else said. I didn't add the honey until I tasted to check sweetness. But if it's too sweet for you, just add more mustard. I used 2 tsp. of hot sauce. Really gave it pep. I also had to hold this for a late arrival, so put chicken and mushrooms and sauce all together in a glass dish in a low oven for an hour. It was excellent.

Rating: 3
Note that I'm just rating the sauce here; I only had bone-in (no skin, though) thighs, so I made the sauce separately in a pot (using Chinese chile sauce instead of Tabasco sauce, and a little extra chile sauce as well as brown sugar) and made sure to reduce it well. Then I browned the thighs well in a pan in a little olive oil, and brushed some of the sauce on both sides. I roasted the thighs in the oven at 450 until done, and after they were done cooked half a minced onion and a segmented orange (to continue the orange theme) in the juices in the roasting pan. I added the sauce, and served it over the roasted thighs. Personally I thought it was different, tasty, and easy. I will try it with the boneless meat at another point.

We lived in New Orleans for three years and just moved to Savannah. I cooked tripled this for Christmas eve dinner. Brightsens was not a favorite place but this recipe was so much better than anything we ever had there. I did have to thicken the sauce with a little corn starch mixed with a water..about a teaspoon mixed with a splash of water and added at the end. I served it with Spicy Rice and Kale found at this site, (Sub-mixed frozed greens for kale and doubled the amount of Creole seasoning). Presentation- Oil one cup bowl and pack rice into it. Invert on warm plate and place thighs with sauce in a pool to the side.Garnish with a sprinkle of chopped scallion greens Pretty, economical, and very tasty.

Note for the cook from Melbourne, I've made this recipe many times, it's a real favorite. Spice it up by marinating the chicken ahead with some hot pepper sauce & seasonining salt. Also, I add additional seasoning salt & much more hot pepper sauce than the recipe at cooking time. Delish!

For those who found this too sweet, omit the honey and reduce the orange juice to 1/2 cup! Having made this several times, I can say that the mustard you use really changes the sweetness. This is one of my son's (14) favorite chicken with sauce recipes. Corn bread and green beans are great sides. The sauce is good over white rice or steamed red potatoes, too.

I agree with the cook from San Diego, a good mid week meal, but definitely not for guests. We felt it was a little bland, even though I added garlic. I also had to thicken the sauce as it was too runny. I will make it again, but I will experiment with a few more ingredients.

I followed the tip from the Griggstown, NJ cook and got outstanding results. I added two minced garlic cloves and one chopped jalapeno and omitted the hot sauce (because I did not have any or otherwise I would have used it for extra heat). I did not have plain OJ but instead an orange-carrot juice blend so I used that and it worked well. Served it with lemony green beans and basmati rice to soak up the wonderful sauce. Original and flavorful!!!!!!
