I made this using a crockpot, with a couple of adjustments. I bought a 4-5 lb Boston butt roast, which was tressed. Wrapped it in one medium sized banana leaf from the yard (benefits of living in FL) after coating it in sea salt, then wrapped that in two layers of tin foil to ensure steaming. I didn't add any water. When I got home, I removed the roast from the pot, then drained off the fat in a bowl before returning the shredded meat to the cooker on warm. Added a couple of shakes of liquid smoke (not a big fan) to the fat, then returned the fat to the meat. It was delicious. Will be making kalua pig and cabbage tomorrow.

I made two shoulders' worth for a potluck luau. Excellent results! Flavorful,juicy and just the right texture. Some have said that it's too salty and that puzzles me. I'm VERY sensitive to salt and found that it was just right. I suspect that they didn't use coarse salt and, thus, the volumetric measurements meant that they used more that called for.

This is okay, not as good as the Alan Wong Kalua Pig on Epi (Gourmet). Too many banana leaves, not necessary and imparted a weird flavor to the outside of the roast. 1/2 tsp smoke for 5lbs of meat...seriously? So that's about 1/10 of tsp per pound, which is not even detectable. I used 1.5 TBSP and it was fine.

Made this for a large event (120 guests) so my methods were adjusted. I don't like my Kalua Pork as salty as it comes on the islands - so I cut way back on both the salt and the liquid smoke. Guests couldn't get a enough and most took a plate heaping with the pork - home with them from the party. I had to roast the pork over 3 days as I only have but one oven - so I reheated in the chafing dishes just before serving. Excellent party food.

Delicious! I served pork sandwiches in Hawaiian buns with mango gazpacho.

I made this in the crockpot instead of the oven. It didn't come out all that great unfortunately.I agree with the reviewer that said it came out a bit salty. Next time I'll try it in the oven and use less salt and more liquid smoke in the finishing step. I have to say that the banana leaves seem to keep the pork very moist.

My husband was raised in Hawaii and raves about the authentic flavor of this EASY recipe. I brought it to a family Easter party and there wasn't a morsel left! The leaves were a little hard to find, but I finally located then at a Thai Market. I bought 5 packages and keep them in my freezer. They are great for steaming fish as well.

Made this for my Memorial Day party and it was a huge success. I will most definitely add it to my regular summer party menu.

I'm having a luau party for my sons first birthday which is tradition in my family with the first boy. After calling around finding it hard to cater Kalua Pig I decided that my father and I would do it ourselves which I know is a crazy thing to do. I normaly cook mine in a crock pot but this is for 200 quests so thats a no! I have already cooked 10lbs to see how it goes in an oven and it came out delicious so the plan is to cook 150lbs 3-days prior to party and use my Seal-o-Matic put them in the freezer than day of the party put them all in my steam trays and we're ready to rock! Not only,we're doing ourselves, we saved big time, the cost was @ 87=cents a pound on sale it costed us $140 verses $1000 for a comapny to make it.....NOT BAD AT ALL! Thanks for letting everyone know, that an oven is also an option! Mahalo, Island girl from Oahu

I made this for a luau party with the mango bbq sauce and five-spice sweet potato puree. It was so easy to prepare and great that I didn't have to tend to it during the cooking process. My guests raved about it. Tip: line you pans with foil.

Very simple recipe but a great result. The saltwater+smoke liquid is a bit salty for my tastes, next time I will use less salt. The meat was very moist because of the banana leaves that can be found in most asian grocery stores. I served the pork with arugula/mango salad, jasmine rice and garlicly wilted spinach. Macadamia nut pie w/vanilla ice cream completed the meal. My guests were very happy.

This was so easy to make and so delicious. Just five ingredients, one of which is water. I found banana leaves online at a merchant in Pennsylvania. What a wonderful presentation, first unwrapping the foil to expose the banana leaves, finally the succulent roast. I made a simple coleslaw and a yam puree with Chinese five-spice seasoning found on this site. What a great meal. The next day, while watching the Oscars, I made BBQ pork sandwiches with the leftover pork on soft rolls slathered with with - yes - barbeque sauce! They flew off the plate.

As the other reviewer said, I couldn't imagine putting barbeque sauce on this utterly delicious, moist, flavorful meat. You can usually buy frozen banana leaves (they're very large--maybe 12" x 20" in a package) in an Asian market.

A taste of Hawaii. I make this all the time and highly recommend it. I can never find the banana leaves but it works fine without them. Any course sea salt works fine; most grocery stores have at least one brand in the salt or gourmet food section. The liquid smoke is in almost every grocery store, in the same section as the worcestershire sauce. This is a great dish to make on a cold winter day because of the long cooking time - the oven will help warm the house. This is some of the best barbecue you will ever make/eat. You can add barbecue sauce at the end, but I never do, it's too ono (delicious) by itself.
