My husband fixed these for dinner. They were so good. Going to be a weekly dinner in our house

As tasty as it was simple. Sauce could stand to be thickened more though.

i used whipping cream instead of milk. Got no curdling whatsoever and after the blender mix it was perfect

I found the sauce benefited greatly from a tablespoon of Dijon mustard, salt and white pepper. Also cooking the chops at a bare simmer reduces the curdling of the milk, making for a more attractive sauce.

Tender, but lacks flavor. Remains of the curdled milk on the chops when removed from skillet is somewhat unappealing.

Simple taste,lacking imagination.Quite easy to prepare,though.
