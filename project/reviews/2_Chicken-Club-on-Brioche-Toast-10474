to the reviewer from Atlanta: if you think that this recipe is too time intensive then you obviously don´t cook all that often. I would suggest that you stick to frozen dinners then. And you can´t tell me that children won´t each lettuce as part of a sandwich. Also, who ever said that this recipe was necessarily a lunch-only recipe?

this might make a good supper, and maybe you could make this lunch with leftovers. But honestly I barely have time to make this for dinner let alone a lunch. And have you ever seen any child under 12 eat lettuce? Rarely. I personally would eat this for lunch. This is pretty much true for the rest of the recipes. I know they would eat the cookies!
