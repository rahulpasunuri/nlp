Living in London I had to make some substitutions but altogether it was pretty awesome. Instead of edamame I used broad beans and instead of chickpea flour I used gram flour made from lentils. The mixture was a little sticky but in the pan it firmed up and the taste was great. I served it with melted cheddar and roasted red peppers. Yummy yummy.

This is a great recipe suffering from a terrible name. Burgers? No, not even distantly. And not green, either - what with all the other ingredients they turn out falafel-colored. Because thats exactly what these are: falafel. Bout the tastiest falafel that Ive ever made! There's the usual chickpea business mixed with flavors of mushroom and edamame, plus all the richness that you get from adding nutritional yeast, soy sauce, and (in my case) fish sauce for umami in place of the liquid smoke. The only situation in which this would not be absolutely excellent would be if you actually wanted something resembling a burger.

I used all the correct ingredients (except the optional liquid smoke) and it turned out great! Very easy to make with a food processor, very tasty, and it really did make a lot of green burgers. The only change I made was I reserved 1/3 cup each of the mushrooms, edamame, and chickpeas, chopped them up with a knife and added them after the food processor step for some added texture. I also added a little extra soy sauce. This was my first time cooking with nutritional yeast and I was a little apprehensive because of the smell of the yeast by itself, but it added a complex deep flavor so it was worth it. I made slightly larger burgers so I made 12 - froze 6 of them and shared the rest with friends. I ate one for dinner last night on toasted bread with tomatoes, spinach and ketchup. Delish! I'd like to know what sides or sauces other people liked with these burgers.
