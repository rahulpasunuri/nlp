Made these for Thanksgiving, and they were great, but I think it is important to serve them warm or hot. Something about the consistency is much tastier that way. Also, they were done in about 12 minutes, so keep an eye on them while they're baking.

These were very tasty. They have a very nice appearance. We ate too many of them each in one sitting. The few left heated up well the next day. The bread flour seems to be key. Tried the recipe a second time with regular and forgot to add extra gluten to compensate. They did not rise as well.

These were amazing rolls! When I cut the balls, I cut them too small, making way more than 3 balls per muffin cup. So I ended up throwing in about 5 balls per cup and they still turned out perfectly. I sprinkled salt and Herbs de Provence on top instead of seeds. Awesome!!!

Exactly what I was looking for -- moist, chewy & rich. I wasn't paying attention to the recipe and added the egg meant for the wash to the batter. I don't know how much it added given the quantity but, it certainly didn't detract -- will probably add the egg to the batter next time, too.

These are lovely, and easy; especially good while still hot. I did what another reviewer suggested and sprinkled sea salt along with the toasted sesame seeds. Straight from the oven, they have a texture similar to soft pretzels. Excellent!

Nothing exceptional, but a good basic roll recipe. I kneaded in a handful of fresh rosemary which was really delicious. I do like the cloverleaf idea and will probably use it with other recipes as well. A nice, fast complement to any dinner.

Excellent rolls and not that difficult if you know how to work with yeast. I made according to the recipe and the one word of advice is to keep an eye on the cooking time. The rolls were done around 13/14 minutes at 400.

not one of the best roll recipes..it's just ok. like a non-eggy version of challah. however they do brown quickly and look pretty, I might do a similar treatment to a different recipe. glad I did a test run before thanksgiving. note-i used a new silicone muffin pan- NOT recommended!!! The rolls had a chemical taste hot from the oven.

I love baking breads, These are simple, delicious rolls. If you don't have bread flour don't worry, just go easy on the all purpose flour used later. I brought it down to one cup and the kids and and my wife could not get enough of these little guys. I had to save some for thanksgiving at my brother's. I had to make another batch!

These rolls are faintly sweet and perfect w/butter and honey. They are lovely served with tea. Mine browned very quickly. I pulled them out at 12 minutes and they were fully baked w/dark edges. Next time, I'll bake them for 10 minutes. This recipe is going into my permanent collection.

Really good rolls, possibly the best I have ever made (and I make a lot). However, I added only 1 cup of all purpose flour, and sea salt instead of the seeds.

This is the best recipe for rolls! My family loves it so much that now I have to double the recipe each time I make it. I use regular flour and have no problem. And I just cut the batter into 12 balls and make regular rolls instead of cloverleafs.

I forgot to add that given some of the comments that the rools didn't turn out like the picture I only made 16 not 18 rolls with this recipe and lowered the oven temp to 375 (they were browning too quickly at 400). The result was rolls that look even better than the picture!

This is a perfect basic recipe!I left off the sesame seeds because I didn't have any. They tasted just like my g'ma used to make. I even used 2% milk and it turned out great.I live in a VERY dry climate so I only used 1 1/2 cups of all purpose flour; the additional cup wasn't necessary. I will make them again for sure and I think I might even try replacing the milk with the water left from boiling potatoes like my g'ma used to do.

If you want fast and easy rolls, this recipe is it! It was so easy and they looked like I had bought them from a bakery. No one believed me when I told them that I made them! Definatly use the seseme seeds!

Used all all purpose flours because that's what I had. Brushed with melted butter instead of egg wash (no poppy seeds -- rough on ole' folks like us!). Just delicious -- perfect, light, wonderful!

Excellent when served hot, very easy to make. I am curious to see how well they reheat the next day. Also placed the muffin tin on a preheated baking stone to get a good rise and I am glad I did.
