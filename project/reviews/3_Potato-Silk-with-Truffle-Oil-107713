I mashed, riced and pureed in the food processor. The first lick of the spoon and I was a goner. I also, licked down the entire food processor. This potato recipe is heavenly. I would give ten forks if that were an option.

Orgasmic.

So decadent! I loved this, but my husband thought the truffle taste was too strong. Will reduce slightly next time. I also cut the milk down considerably, to about a 1/4 cup and liked the consistency it produced--still like mashed potatos but a little creamier. Will definitely make again and would be proud to serve it to guests.

What a delectable, simple side! I used black truffle oil instead of white and substituted skim milk. Well worth getting the food processor dirty.

First of all, this recipe is called 'Potato Silk'. Given the name, I would hope that most people would realize that it's not going to turn out to be the same consistency as regular mashed potatoes. That said, I love truffle oil and don't consider it to be a waste...most people don't have the extra cash just lying about to drop hundreds on fresh white truffles. I used high quality white truffle oil that my husband and I brought back from our trip to Italy in this dish with excellent results. When making a mashed or 'silk' potato recipe for the fist time (or ever and always), it's a good idea to add the milk as you go rather than dump it all in. You can always add more to yield the desired consistency. If it's gummy, then you've spun it too long in the food processor. We ate every last drop of this fantastic dish and served it with the Roasted Salmon recipe from this site along with fresh baby carrots and salad. The potatoes were the perfect portion for two people as there were no leftovers. We will make it again and would definitely serve it to guests.

Agree. Just spent the summer in Umbria and had fresh truffles for the first time. Now I know what all the fuss is about. Truffle oil a waste of money. However, fresh Italian truffles are a thing to behold. Unbelievably intense and earthy. A taste like no other. Brought back some truffle salsa and truffles in olive oil. Haven't tried yet but will and share experience.

I concur with other reviewers--the consistency was too thin, and the flavor was lacking. It did nothing for me.

I have not made this particular recipe, but the responses were typical in my experience... truffle oil is just like any ingredient- what you pay for is what you get. I would think $9/oz oil would produce the desired effect. Earthy in it's flavor, but complementing the potatoes to a fault. Other palates may differ...

Can someone tell me the deal with truffle oil? First time using it, spent $9 on 1 oz, added the 1/2 tsp, couldn't taste any difference, added another 1/2 tsp, still no difference, then decided it wasn't worth wasting any more of this expensive oil on soupy mashed potatoes. If my mom had served this to me I would have asked her to take it back to the kitchen and throw some more Potato Buds in there. (And maybe a bit of garlic!)

We make a few subs - chicken stock for the milk, and usually use only 1/2c or so. I rice the potatoes before putting them in the processor. The truffle oil and the white pepper add so much! This is "the" mashed recipe for us now.

Fabulous. Don't expect mashed potatoes- it's not. I've made it 5 times already- great with grilled lamb chops or sliced london broil. So easy and extravagant. Slightly less milk is a good suggestion.

This dish is a good match with lamb, but the truffle oil was too over-powering for me. Perhaps if I cut the truffle oil in half next time, I would have more luck.

I found this dish to be uninspired - rather gummy, lacking in any distinct flavor or appealing texture.

DBF & I loved it. This was delicious! I used dark truffle oil b/c that's what I had. Very luxurious indeed. I did experience the "oh no it's soup/liquid" fear, but upon checking this is how they are suppose to turn out: look at the photo in the magazine, they are served in a little dish. And we ate them with forks. Unusual and excellent taste, and very "silky" indeed!

I measured everything very carefully including weighing the potatoes to be certain I had the correct amount. What I ended up with was potato soup! The flavor was good, but I had to add 2 more potatoes to bring it from soup to mashed potatoes. I don't know what I did wrong.

My husband and I didn't really care for the taste of these. I guess we just like our mashed without any extras.
