This had a beautiful presentation and was not too hard to make. We made just two for a dinner for two - easy to reduce the recipe.

Great easy to make dish - didn't do the flaming pernod but added a little Sambuca to the roasting pan which flavored it nicely. The fennel was especiall delicious.

Wanted something different for my weekend meal with the two kids -- each got their own Pouisson and having them help provided some good conversation. Flaming the Pernod at the end made it exciting too! - simple meal to create actually.

Have made serveral times -- always excellant -- usually serve dressing and acorn squash with it.
