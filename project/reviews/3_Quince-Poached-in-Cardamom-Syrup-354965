ah yes, I'll agree. "They dined on mince, and slices of quince, Which they ate with a runcible spoon; And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand, They danced by the light of the moon..." Cardamom is a good choice for this lovely fruit.

Great recipe! Very simple, delicious combination of flavors to highlight the quince. I suggest it over some vanilla ice cream...eaten with a runcible spoon.
