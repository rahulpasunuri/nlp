Other than substituting dry sherry for sake, we made this according to the recipe and were very happy with the results.

Great!!!! I followed the recipe, except I added snow peas and mushrooms. The flavor was amazing and it is super healthy.

Wonderful sauce. Cut the sugar in half and added a little extra ginger and garlic, as other reviewers suggested. Used fresh vegetables from the garden along with the peppers and onions, including a handful of fresh chopped basil. Delicious.

This was SO good! I have been wanting to make a fabulous stir fry sauce for years and this is it! A little spicy, but loved it! My 7 year old even ate it up! Added a little extra garlic and ginger but otherwise followed sauce portion to a T! Will make again and again!

i thought this was too bland. and to all the nice folks who review recipes after they have utterly and completely altered it beyond recognition, you are not helpful! i find small alterations helpful but the last reviewer on here didn't seem to use one ingredient common to the original recipe besides shrimp.

This came out delicious. I added skirt steak and substituted white wine for sake and tamari sauce for soy. I left out the onion and sesame oil and substituted seasonal vegetables. My wife and 1-year old son loved this as well. The red-pepper flakes kicked in perfectly.

My boyfriend is a very picky eater and LOVED this recipe. If you are looking for panda-express type asian, this is not it. Tons of flavor from the fresh veggies and fantastic sauce. Tweaked the red- pepper to our tastes (we can't handle too spicy), pre-cooked the shrimp (will try chicken next time too), added mushrooms and snow peas. Other than the time needed for chopping the veggies (which we always have on-hand anyways) this is the fastest meal we've ever made and enjoyed!

Fantastic! I switched it up a bit and it was still super yummy. In my version I used teryaki instead of soy, galangal instead of ginger, green onion instead of regular onion, omitted the cabbage. Also served with brown rice instead of white rice.

This is great with fish, chicken or just vegi's. Sauce is simple and just right. This is the sauce I have been looking for in a stir fry!!

Quick, easy, and very forgiving of whatever vegetable you want to throw in.

So delicious. I made this with two other friends, and it was superb! We added lots of vegetables and got fresh shrimp, which really made a difference. Just enough spice too. I would definitely make this again! It's simple and well-worth it.

Shrimp needs to be seared first before adding to dish, as well as not adding the extra water. The taste of the sauce is nice, but some extra steps would make it even better. Boiled shrimp =uugh

I disagree with the majority of the reviewers. This recipe required too much effort to yield a mediocre dish. Imagine ordering Chinese Takeout and then submerging the food in water.

I doubled the sauce, which gave a great flavor to the brown rice I served it with. I used dark soy sauce, which was good, but it colored everything, which didn't make it look quite as appetizing. I also added broccoli and carrots and used purple cabbage. Next time I make it I'll use regular soy sauce.

This dish was really good. We used twice as much cabbage, white wine instead of sake, olive oil instead of sesame, 1/2 t. ground ginger, and extra red pepper flakes. Served with brown rice. Yummy, easy, and healthy -- who could ask for more?

We loved this . . . It's fast, easy, flexible and really healthy. We served it over brown rice on a plate . . . next time I'll put it in a bowl. The sauce is delicious! I'd use whatever fresh vegies I had on hand.

This was wonderful. I substituted snow pea pods for the green pepper and halfed the red pepper flakes (Kids can't eat it too hot) and everyone gobbled it up.

I was not happy with this recipe. Did not like it at all.

Oh man oh man oh man. This is amazing. It's easy, healthy and delicious. I've made it twice this week. Two times perfectly used up a head of cabbage and a small bottle of sake (I halved the vegetables & shrimp part of the recipe, but kept the sauce portions the same). MAKE THIS!!

Loved this! Light, fresh-tasting, zippy and healthy. Will make again and again. I, too used snow peas instead of cabbage. Otherwise kept recipe as is.

Well, my carrots had been in the fridge too long and I didn't have the sake-so I used white wine. It was very good. My husband loved it. I used lots of pepper flakes and it really warmed us up. I can't wait to make again this time with carrots.

This was very tasty - and very quick!! Except for waiting 50 minutes for the brown rice to cook it could have been done in 10 minutes, including prep! I used pea pods, bok choi and yellow squash - instead of cabbage and green peppers- it was delicious! forgot to add the red pepper flakes but it was still extremely flavorful. My husband had three servings!

This was a good dish, I also served it over brown rice and that added some necessary bulk. It's definitely spicy, though!

This some was some of the best stirfry that I've made! I sub'd white cooking wine for the sake and snow peas for the cabbage -- yum! I also added about some cayenne pepper to the sauce b/c my hubby and I love spicy foods. It was delicious and light, and we cleaned our plates!

This is wonderful! Fast, delicious and oh so healthy. The ginger soy sauce is soooooo good... I made a little extra and it was worth it! Also, I substituted Savoy (dark green) cabbage for the regular cabbage for a little extra folate, and served the whole thing over brown rice. I think it added a great deal to the flavor (as well as vitamin content) of the overall dish, and went to bed feeling both virtuous and very full.
