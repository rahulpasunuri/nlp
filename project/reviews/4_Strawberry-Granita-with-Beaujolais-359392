very easy. tried to first use the ice cream maker but it didn't freeze at all. needed about 24 hours in the freezer to firm up-- used rose wine and raspberries---perfection. even my husband liked it and wanted more. actually doesn't make alot, for 20 people it was only about a 1/2 cup each. refreshing. nice ending to the meal.

This was too sweet for me - felt like more of a dressing to dollop on top of a glass of champagne or waffles than serve on its own. Might have been the wine, which wasn't as light as a Beaujolais but next time I will leave my gorgeous red strawberries au-natural for dessert & let my wine stand alone in my glass.

I'm not usually a fan of low-fat desserts but this was excellent. We used strawberries frozen from last summer's harvest and it was beautiful and elegent and very filling.

What a wonderful, easy and light recipe. My dinner guest raved about it, asked for the recipe, and will serve it to her dinner guest this coming weekend. I added a dollop of no-fat vanilla yogurt to break up the all-red presentation. Lovely.
