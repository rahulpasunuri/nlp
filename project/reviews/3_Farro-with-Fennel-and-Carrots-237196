I LOVE farro. This was easy, albiet a tiny bit time consuming. Added some roasted garlic and (fresh) chives, thyme, basil and celery (forgot to buy the fennel:(. Tastes great now and tomorrow should be wonderful.

I ended up turning this into a cold salad, and added a big scoop if dijon mustard, and a bit of mayonnaise to it. As a cold salad, it was a hit. I didn't love it as-is though.

I cooked the farro in the rice cooker and added extra chicken broth. I didnt have red wine vinegar, so I used white wine vinegar instead. Delicious!

farro = the italian name for spelt. you shouldn't have to go to an italian market, tho you might have to go to an organic/whole-foods-type place. trader joe's has it sometimes.

Everyone who tasted this dish loved the textures and flavors and I had no trouble finding farro in an Italian market. It realy must be eated right away because it gets a bit mushy otherwise and loses its good chewy texture. Yummy.

Made it twice. Once with farro and once with barley. The farro remained extremely chewy despite cooking it for and hour. The barley had a better texture. Would give it 3 forks with the barley.

I have not made this yet, but just spent a couple of hours trying to locate farro (went to Whole Foods, a local natural foods store, a google search and two upscale grocery stores) . I finally found some. As an FYI, the package says Farro Perlato, Perled Spelt. After looking at spelt in the bins, it seems to be the same thing.

To the cook from Merion, PA, Farro is an ancient grain (The Roman Legions used it). It's good. I've found it at Whole Foods and other supermarkets, usually in the whole foods aisle, but also in the international aisle with the Italian products

I would like to make this recipe, but what is farro and where do I get it?

We liked the flavors in this dish, but I thought the textures didn't work--the farro is chewy and everything else is crunchy. My husband didn't mind that, so I know I'll be making this again.
