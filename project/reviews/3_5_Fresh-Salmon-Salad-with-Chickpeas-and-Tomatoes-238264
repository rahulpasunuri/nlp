This was an excellent and easy warm salad and a great way to use up leftover salmon. I did not add the capers or measure the citrus. I used the grated peels from one whole orange and lemon, and the juices from half of each. I also had about a half cup of rice that I threw in. Delicious. All the kids loved it.

Very good, and interesting as well. To those who wanted cumin, try it with the chickpea confit from this site.

I found it to be a great summer salad, easy to assemble and good - HOWEVER I would definitely leave out the capers next time. I've nothing personal against them, but here, even rinsed, they overpower any trace of citrus flavor and quite simply aren't necessary. In my humble opinion of course.

This didn't work for me. I made it exactly as per the recipe, but cut the oil in the last step in 1/2 to make it less greasy. Maybe because of that the dish lacked flavor. The chickpea mixture and the salmon never came together for me. Also I didn't taste any of the citrus flavors. I ended up eating it with an olive oil/garlic/red wine vinegar dressing I had in the fridge.

This is a good, healthy dish that is very satisfying. I also added canned tomatoes, but think fresh would have been better. Otherwise, I really enjoyed the dish. The basil is the best part -- don't omit it! I will certainly make this again.

This recipe was quick and simple, hwever I made some adjustments do to what i had in my pnatry. Instead of ornge juice, i used tangerine juice which realy kicked up the citrusy notes. I also used whole-canned tomatoes because I had no fresh ones on hand. I marrinated the chickpea mixture before warmin it and realy think that helped the flavors soak in. I omited the basil and would use more lemon zest next time. Adding a little cayane may also kick up the flavor. I paired the salad with barley which added some nice texture and grilled the salmon to give it a little more of a smoky flavor. The salad would be great chilled and stuffed into pita pockets

I added sauteed spinach to the chickpea salad and did not flake the salmon into it. Instead, I served it whole with the salad as a side. Also made some herbed potato salad to go with (also from this site.) Very good!

this was absolutely delicious, and fast for a weeknight supper. Also made leftovers to bring on a picnic tomorrow - plan to have it in pitas. Tonite we served it on top of a green salad -- mmm & healthy too. I used a cajun marinated salmon fillet (from our local store) to add a subtle kick and also added about 1 Tbl of cumin and maybe 1 tsp cinnamon to give it a moroccan flavor.This was a good idea -- would do again, and would probably use even more cumin.

This is an amazing recipe. We make this about once a week. We add the salmon at the end to cook and then the basil and eat it warm. Yummy!

This is a great way to use leftover salmon. I steamed some cut-up green beans and added them. Delicious!

Served not as salad, but over a bed of raw spinach topped with sauce and then whole salmon filet. Looked and tasted beautiful. Served with a great Cabernet.

Oh my goodness!!! What a delightful recipe this is! We grilled two wild salmon filets, substituted sundried tomatoes for the fresh ones because tomatoes aren't at their best yet in Tennessee because of the drought. Added canned,drained artichoke hearts and did not heat anything. It was wonderful last night AND today for lunch. Heart healthy and satisfying. A great combo!

I thought this was a great light meal. I was out of parsley so I threw some arugula in at the end, and would probably make it that way again. I also used the same pan to saute the chickpeas that I used for the salmon, and added no additional oil.

Followed the reciped exactly. It wasn't great. I didn't like the texture - the soft salmon and the hard chickpeas. I found that the flavors didn't meld together - it seemed like was missing something. The people I served it to enjoyed it but I don't think I'd make it again.

My teenage son loved this recipe - I would add more capers - they add great flavour!! Had it warm for supper and itasted even better as leftovers for lunch the next day!

Loved this salad. My husband and I just had it for a fantastic light dinner. The only change is, I left the salmon in a whole piece(3X5), rather than break it up. Definitley a keeper!!

This would make a great light appetizer. Liked it very much. Healthy and simple. I would cut back a little on the chickpeas next time though.

Very nice and light. If following same proportions but for fewer people (I followed recipe exactly for just my husband and I), I would cut back slightly on the chickpeas. Very healthy. I think it would make a good appetizer for a dinner party if needing something light.

Fantastic! My Roman Husband adored it, even with Chick peas...;) Light, easy and really, really good. Prep takes a few minutes, but it's well worth it.

This is a perfect spring/summer meal. Simple, light, and delicious! I added avocado, and left out the capers. I've had it warm and cold, and it's great both ways. Yum!
