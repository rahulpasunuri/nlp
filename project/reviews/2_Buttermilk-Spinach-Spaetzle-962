Not bad. I cooked mine in salted water. The nutmeg comes through nicely. As another reviewer ponited out, these are supposed to soak up good sauce, and they do just that. Not pretty or dainty, but a satisfying comfort food on a cold night.

I must have done something wrong, because these were an unmitigated disaster. They were gloopy, gelatinous, and bland.

I don't understand the other reviews! This is my standard spaetzle that I have used with or without the spinach. The dumplings are wonderful for soaking up good sauce. I can see how it wouldn't be too appetizing on its own, but that is no reason to condemn this recipe.

I've had spaetzle before, and liked them very much, but these were underwhelming. The flavor was bland (the buttermilk and spinach didn't really come through) and the texture was a bit gummy.

Made this with the Beef with Goat Cheese Sauce. It was good - but wouldn't bother making it again.
