This was SO simple to make and SO delicious!! My husband doesn't like arugula and I had lots of fresh spinach so made it with that. My new favorite tuna recipe, replacing the http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Tuna-Kebabs-with-Ginger-Chile-Marinade-239072 I usually make!

Simple, flavorful, earthy and delicious! This recipe is easy enough to make on a weeknight, but it will make you feel like you've just expended the energy appropriate to Sunday dinner. As I do when I make recipes for the first time, I followed this one pretty closely, and it yielded fantastic results. I could also see this as a canape with just some minor presentational modifications.

I made this essentially according to the recipe, except that I made the tapenade on the fly by chopping garlic (fine) and green and Kalamata olives (coarse) in a food processor with olive oil, then adding the red onion, basil, olive oil, and vinegar (didn't have white balsamic, went with equal parts sherry and conventional balsamic). It was delicious; my only criticism is that the flavors are so strong that the tuna doesn't come through very clearly. Still a healthy, low-carb, quick and delicious recipe.

Very good and easy to make! I for some reason could not find an olive tapenade, so I threw together some olives, oil, garlic, lemon juice and S&P. I also only had regular balsamic vinegar, so I used that. The vinegertte alone on the bread was to die for. My husband really loved this meal and I did too. His was a little more rare (I prefer my tuna steaks medium) and he said it was perfect.

My husband is very particular about food combinations, and I was a bit worried that he'd find this a little too "California" (you'd have to know him..) But, he loved this, even raved about it. I don't get that reaction very often, so if there were 5 forks, I'd rate it 5.

Tastes expensive and luxurious. Used more olives, a bit of dill and less basil in tapenade. Added garlic, salt and pepper to baguette slices after they were toasted. Terrific recipe.

Very easy to make and great flavors. I served on top of Butter lettuce and radiccio instead.

I've made this several times and it's wonderful! I do cook the tuna through, because I can't get sushi grade tuna, and I'm afraid to not cook it. I don't use arugala (I don't like it), I use a spring greens salad mix. There's only two of us, so the other two servings are our lunch next day. Awesome! This is a keeper!

Slice the tuna across the grain for nicely sliced tuna that is tender.

This is a fast and excellent tasting recipe. We used an olive tapenade with anchovy in it and found this still complemented the tastes.

Excellent used regular balsamic vinegar I had on hand, will definitely make for company.

Amazingly perfect combination of flavors! My wife and I made this tonight and it blew our minds! The only thing different, was our use of non white balsamic vinegar. Check out our pictures of it here : http://post.ly/hMcZ

The combination of flavors was excellent. The olive tapenade vinaigrette on its own was outstanding. I plan to make it again for salads, chicken, pasta...

I didn't have red onion; so I used Videlia. I didn't have a lemon, so I used orange peels. It was still fabulous and easy! I cooked the tuna 3 minutes per side, because I was afraid to cook it for less. It was delicious, but didn't cut well as in the picture. Did others really just cook it 1-2 minutes per side? And did it cut nicely? It was yummy, and I will make it again. There is leftover olive mixture. I think I will drain it to use on sandwiches, use it with the liquid on salads, and I am trying to think of more things. Who has ideas? I spooned some onto the baguette toasts, and it was good.

To a cook from Memphis - This is pretty much an all in one dish with the fish as your protein, the arugula as your green and the bread as your starch. Also, tuna is a very rich, meaty type of fish. Personally I would not alter the recipe as it is; if you are worried it won't be enough, just make the portions bigger. Good luck!

Outstanding! Followed recipe exactly and it was light and full of flavor.

Fabulous!! I doubled tapenade mixture and pan fried bread by putting olive oil and a little butter directly in a separate pan instead of brushing each slice.Also a beautiful presentation perfect for a dinner party.

Absolutely loved it! This dish is simple elegant and full of fresh flavors. We made this with a great piece of sushi grade tuna cooked to medium rare. Just remember though with a dish like this the quality of the tuna is everything.
