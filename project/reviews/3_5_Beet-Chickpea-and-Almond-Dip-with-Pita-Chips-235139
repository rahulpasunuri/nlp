I love this recipe! It is delicious and so pretty (especially during the holiday season.) I strongly suggest one change and then you are in for a great appetizer... reduce the garlic to 2 - 3 cloves and roast them first. YUM.

This is incredible! Not only is it beautiful but it is so good! Everyone loved it when I took it to a party. I did use a jar of beets and it was terrific.

Wow. This is delicious. I brought it to a party and became the center of attention because everyone loved it. One caution: while it was very popular at the party, it gave everyone crazy garlic breath.

one more thing...i always toast the almonds first; think that makes it even better.

Easy, great dip. I reduce garlic (buy large cloves & garlic lover but 5 raw; way too many) Have used raw beets & cooked & also canned; makes no difference in taste so now I use canned! A definite keeper!

Delicious, easy recipe! I roasted the beet first instead of boiling. Also I used 5 cloves of roasted garlic and one clove raw garlic. I had to make in two batches and combine since I only have a mini food processor. The dip is delicious - slightly sweet, nutty, earthy, with a kick from the garlic. I made this morning and will serve to guests tonight. Quick and easy, will definitely make again!

I have this copy of Bon Appetit, and I can tell you, the reason the color of the dip is so drastically different than the photo here is because this photo is in fact yogurt dip, not beet dip. The beet dip should be the color of beets.

I love this dip and it's a hit whenever I make it. Definitely make it a day ahead and add the olive oil to taste. If you like a creamier hummus, you would want to add more olive oil. If you like more texture and are watching the fat content of this dip, you can use a lot less than the recipe calls for. I use the 5 cloves of garlic b/c most people I know love it, and I use fresh garlic b/c it gives it a nice kick of spiciness. I would imagine roasting the garlic would only add to the sweetness of the beets. Depends on what you like! I also normally use the steam packed baby beets you can find in the produce section of the grocery store - tastes great and a bit less work than roasting them.

I made this for my superbowl party. It tasted similar to hummus, except lighter and more earthy - it had a mild beet flavor. My guests liked it. Very easy to make. I used golden beets (that's what I had in my fridge) and the color was bright yellow.

After reading other reviews I made two very small adjustments - I used roasted garlic and toasted the almonds. It tasted quite good. I served it as a healthier choice for a Ladies Game Night. It went virtually untouched. I think the color is the problem. It really is BRIGHT magenta. Too scary even for adult women I guess. Flavor good.... color freaky.

I wanted to like this. The color is beautiful and it's pretty healthy. I had to arm twist my family to try it and they unanimously gave it the thumbs down. I thought it was okay, but I ended up throwing the rest out since no one else would touch it.

I love this dip!! I only used 2-3 cloves of garlic and I cut back on the olive oil, as well. Excellent!! I love the bright color it presents.

What a pretty color! The amount of raw garlic in this recipe leaves a noticeable aftertaste. That's something I don't mind, but if you are sensitive, I would recommend halving the specified amount. Delicious, distinctive, and easy.

Beautiful color, but I really found this too bland, and not as good as a good, regular hummus.

This dip was an intriguing alternative to hummus and highly rated by guests for it's "heart healthy" ingredients. Mine turned out MUCH more beet coloured than the sample photo and will be a beautiful holiday snack.

I grilled white & red beets then pureed them. No garlic used oregano instead. People loved the dip served cold!

I am addicted to this dip! It's definitely better with fresh beets, but canned will work (it doesn't have the same bright red color though.) Also, I used only two cloves of garlic and roasted it first. Five cloves of raw garlic was way too over-powering for me.

Love the flavor of this dip. I used only 1 clove of garlic and 2 tbsp of oil. Different and healthy!!

Not a hit in our house. And I like beets. My Grandparents loved it though...

I decided to improvise since I was unable to find decent beets at the store. I used a full can of garbanzo beans. I peeled and roasted a large carrot, a whole shallot (quartered), and 6 cloves of garlic. I roasted at 350 with salt, pepper, and olive oil for about 30 or so minutes (until soft). I used a pan lined with foil and poured the veggies with the oil into the processor, with the beans. I toasted the almonds and used about 1/3 cup. I added the red wine vinegar and olive oil and pureed until smooth. Then, added a little salt to taste. It was the BEST hummus-style dip I've ever made. I love beets and hope to make it with beets when they're in better supply. Try roasted carrots - YUMMY!

I used some roasted garlic that I had in the frig that was in some oil. I toasted the almonds in a frying pan I used Beets in a jar which are in a vinegar solution (which I drained), so I did not add any addt'l vinegar. EXCELLENT, even my husband liked it.

Rating: 2
I used canned beets and great northern beans since I didn't have garbanzos. I cut back the garlic based on previous suggestions, but found the dip too bland so added in a lot more. The dip got good reviews from friends - all thought the combination of ingredients was unique - but I think it'll be better on Day 2 after the flavors have had more time to form.

Rating: 4
I used a 15 oz. can of drained red beets, and since I had other garbanzo based dip, I used a can of black beans. The color is a beautiful raspberry. Also took the garlic and oil down. Otherwise, an unusual and delicious alternative to hummos

Don't use as much garlic as it calls for and don't try it while it's hot. I let it sit in frig and brought back to room temp and it ended up being really good and a big hit

Well It has an interesting taste, unsure if I like it or don't. The dip I made looks nothing like the dip in the picture. Mine was a bright pink. Garlic was WOW - way too much, i used 4 cloves, should have went with one! I will see what my vegan friend thinks, since i'm not a beet and pea kind of person!

Rating: 4
Great flavour, I love beets, chick peas and good dips, so for me, this is a winner! I have found that garlic, especially raw, does increase in intensity as a dish sits. These days, one clove is enough for me. But whatever floats your boat. Enjoy.

Excellent!!! We love this dip. We use this for many gatherings and many have asked for the recipe. I would cut back on the garlic and oil, otherwise fantastic.

Vibrant color and intense garlic- wow! Cut back on the garlic for sure. I added several dollops of greek style yogurt to cut the punch. My mother in law is making this for a baby shower- a girl of course!

I left out the garlic intirely, based on other reviews. Rather than the large amount of oil called for, I used 2 Tbs and plain non fat yogurt to thin it out. This also cut down the calories substantially. This recipe is FANTASTIC if you substitute ROASTED HAZELNUTS for the almonds! The vinegar needs to be added just before serving it. If you serve any leftover, add more vinegar.

I have served this recipe several times to rave reviews. I use a whole 15 oz. can of garbanzo beans and add a little more red wine vinegar. Otherwise follow recipe as written.

This dip is crazy delicious; it plays to raves every single time I make it. The pita chips are perfect with it, but it also works well with crudite, for the calorie-minded. Gorgeous to look at too!

Wow that's garlic-y! Even after reading the other reviews and only using 3 cloves of garlic, it was very strong. Guests commented on how good it was but perhaps would have eaten more if it wasn't so intense! I also took other reviewers' advice and reduced to 1/4 cup olive oil...which may have made the garlic even more pronounced...

Rating: 2
it asks for way too much olive oil. I also cut back on the garlic and added more chickpeas. 1/2 cup of oil was even too much.

Decreased garlic and olive oil to increase flavours. Colour is bright, but fun. Guests consumed it!

Made this for a holiday party, and it was a big hit--had a number of requests for the recipe. Two suggestions: 1)cut down on the oil slightly, as it pooled after sitting for a little bit, and 2) definitely make the day before you plan to eat it, as the flavors need that time to meld.

I've made this about 4 times and it is always a hit. I've used a can of whole baby beets (drained) when I haven't had the time to use fresh and it still was a winner

Rating: 3
Wow! So easy to make, so so delish! I used one can of sliced beets and one can of chickpeas, tossed in a little more than the called-for almonds, decreased oil to 1/4 cup, decreased garlic to 3 cloves as suggested by others (5 wouldve been way too much) and added a little lemon juice to boot. Definitely pink, and definitely great. I'll make this instead of hummus anytime.

Excellent! I served this dip along with 3 others, and the color variation was beautiful. I made a double batch and froze half, and it was just as good after a quick thaw in the microwave.

We loved this dip!!!! I only used 3 large garlic cloves and thought it was deliciously garlicky. I don't know why some people were turned off by the color because it was really quite lovely and looked beautiful in its white bowl on my table, garnished with a sprig of mint. But I truly appreciate the visual beauty of food as well as the taste...

Mine turned out this crazy pink color. Tasted okay. I will say that the almonds are good, but I'll just add almonds to my regular old hummus and leave out the beets. My usually brave boyfriend definitely shied away from this concoction.

This is delicious. I made it for friends, who confessed that before tasting it, they were not excited; they thought the ingredients sounded like a strange combo. How wrong they were! It truly is very tasty. I love garlic, but do be warned, the amount of raw garlic in this dish will linger in your mouth for an extremely LONG time. *Not* a good dip to make for a date!

I loved the magenta color. I used way less oil. Next time I make it I will also reduce the garlic.

I'm a beet-a-holic, so this recipe is most welcome. I used some homemade pickled beets, since my garden beets aren't ready yet. I think this helped me avoid the whole "a little too bland" criticism. Anyone else tried this? I raise golden beets and look forward to using them in this recipe.

Rating: 3
Really good, but a little too garlicky for my taste. I might cut back on the garlic and make sure I get white beets to avoid the raspberry sorbet look!

Rating: 3
Good, but didn't look at all like the photo. Mine was very magenta, which is fine, but the photo was misleading. Thought it was a little too garlicky and bland (without real seasoning), so added some Greek oregano, and that helped. Omitted the salt and served with purchased seasoned pita chips, which also helped with flavor. Think it would be great on top of roasted potatoes for a side dish for lamb, beef or grilled shrimp.

re using red beets - they do make the dip a 'raspberry-sorbet' color but I dont think anyone was turned off (the dip disappeared quickly) if serving with veggies instead of pita chips, dip will need some salt

To the cook who made this with the red beet - did the colour make the dip appear unappetizing? I'm just wondering as I only have red beets (and I haven't seen any white ones around yet). thanks danielle

Very good and healthy. I made the dip with a red beet so it turned out a bright pink. Next time, however, I'll make it with white beets.

I made this for guests a few nights ago. It was a resounding hit. One friend couldn't stop eating it. Be sure to make the pita chips. They are wonderful with the dip or by themselves. Had some of the chips with cottage cheese this morning. Yum.
