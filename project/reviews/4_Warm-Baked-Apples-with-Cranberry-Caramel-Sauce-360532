I loved this and so did my guests! It was fairly easy to make. The hardest part was coring the apple without taking out the bottom! Everyone was raving!! I let it bake while we ate and it was ready in perfect time! Everyone asked for the recipe! I would have like the caramel sauce to be thicker, but other than that, perfect!!

My only consolation for the end of pool season is apple season. I buy and eat a whole bushell every year. So I'm always looking for new apple receipts. I loved how simply this came together. It bakes while I'm eating dinner, and is ready to go when I clear the main course. So I skipped the whipped cream, which I know would be delcious, but I'm trying to loose 3 lbs. I think it's a no brainer that vanilla ice cream could make a fine substitute. I didn't find there to be a lot of sauce in the pan after baking the apple to be able to reduce. My apples seemed to hold thier sauce just fine. Unfortunately, the majority of what did leak out ended up burning and two days later I'm still trying to clear my pyrex dish in an internal debate over whether or not to just through the thing away,...errr recycle the glass. So as an added precaution I will line my dish with foil next time. And there definately will be a next time.
