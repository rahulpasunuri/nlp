I used lamb shoulder, much cheaper than veal and very delicious. I also used red onions cut in chunks, which saves time from getting the skins off the pearl onions. Perhaps silly, as it takes time to cut the meat off lamb shoulder chops, but they are cheap at my local Harris Teeter. I love the recipe with veal, and have done it at least three times, but also love this cheaper version. Still did potato chunks, but used halved grape tomatoes. I also used both fresh and dried oregano. Really good.

Made this for XMAS eve and was disappointed. IF I were to try this again I would do only 1 CUP of liquid in addition to the original recipe ingredients and instead of 2 14oz cans of roasted tomatoes I would do 1. If even all that...I can see why initially it looked like it needed more but there was no umph to this. I actually needed to make a flour/roux paste to thicken... I always read reviews before I try everything and trust reviewers but this was lacking. One day I'll come back with a fabulous veal stew for sure.

I used this recipe and the reviews to tweek the stew (alot) but it was delicious and got rave reviews from all. My local meat market did not have veal stew meat so I decided to use buffalo stew meat (Yummy!) which is also very lean. I used shallots instead of onions, I used yucon gold potatoes (so I wouldn't get soggy potatoes) and I only added the potatoes for only the last 1/2 hour of cooking, I also added garlic, thyme, and some baby bellas (baby portabello mushrooms). After reading about the dryness factor I added 2 cans of organic fire roasted crushed tomatoes (in place of the other tomatoes the recipe suggested), 2 cans vegetable stock, 1 can beef stock, and 1/2 of a 750 Ml bottle of Vino De EyzaGuirre (a mid price 2003 Cabernet Sauvignon), After sauteeing the meat, garlic and shallots, I deglazed with the wine and put the rest of the liquids in a big pot with the sauteed mixture, and simmered all for 6 hours. Everyone was very pleased and just raved definetely a keeper for those cold winter days and nights, I served it with a boule of crusty artisan sourdough....MMMMM it was something! Meat was so tender...wish I had leftovers.....But it was all scooped up.

This is delicious and easy to prepare! I recommend reducing the amount of oil used, for a lighter stew. I add a can of diced tomatoes with their liquid for a more generous sauce. I have also obtained excellent results when adding a glass of red, white or marsala wine.

Made this last night, it was great, and just finished the leftovers in a very early lunch! I cut the onion amount in half and used 2 cups stock/wine. Next time I will add more potatoes and add only one cup of liquid.

Delicious! I made it in my Le Cruset dutch oven. Even though I didn't peek for the first hour, it still needed more liquid. As suggested in prior reviews, I added a big splash of cabernet and a 28oz can of fire roasted diced tomatoes (along with the cherry tomatoes.) I used fresh oregano which I think makes a difference. The veal was very tender and the flavors were delicious. Will definitely make again.

This is a delicious alternative to veal stews or blanquettes with a lot of cream. Very fresh and a great way to use summer tomatoes, herbs and new potatoes. I also found it needed more liquid; wine and broth gave it depth and moisture. My husband, who generally finds stews(no matter how good) boring peasant food, really loved this. I will definitely make it again.

I, too, agree that this dish is best when tweaked; add a little broth and/or wine; some wild mushrooms add a nice touch. I simply coursely chop up some onions to save time (instead of the pearl onions). Easy, and nearly impossible to fail.

Definitely a keeper with revisions. I added red wine, beef broth, mushrooms and shallots instead of pearl onions. It's delicious!

This was delicious! especially with the additions recommended by previous cooks - tin of plum tomatoes, 1 lb of mushrooms, 1/2 C red wine.

I tried this recipe "as is", but with little humidity, it didn't work. The next time I added 1-2 cups of chicken stock before putting it in the oven, and it came out perfect. My significant other will eat anything, but rarely raves about anything, and he talks about this dish quite a bit and asks for it by name. It's really quite an outstanding dish, and well worth the wait!

I halved the recipe, and made exactly as written baking it in my Le Creuset casserole. When it was checked after 1 hour and 40 minutes, the liquid was all gone, the onions and tomatoes were "over caramelized". I think that either the temperature needs to be reduced, or the time in the oven shortened. However, even the over-done stew was tasty. I think I'll try again.

I read all the reviews and basicly prepared the recipe exactly how it reads except that I used a can of 28 oz plum tomatoes with juices. However, when I baked the stew, I left it in the oven approximately 2 hrs and 10 min. I took the stew out of the oven, and it was totally juiceless. I tried the veal only. It was cooked but sooo dry. I was devastated but determined to fix it. I let it cool on the stove, put it in the fridge and contemplated all night how I was going to make this dish tasty. In the morning I mixed in a can of beef stock. When I come home after work, the dish still looked real thirsty, so I added white wine till the dish looked satisfied. (Approximately 1/2 to 1 cup). Then I thought to add fresh basil. I grow a ton of it in my back yard and decided it couldn't hurt. I baked it at 350 for an hour. I still cannot believe how this dish redeemed itself. And the sauce was excellent--bread dunking material. From disaster to hit. Unbelievable.

I must urge those who are tempted to add more liquid to his recipe or to substitute crushed tomatoes for the cherry tomatoes to try the recipe as written first. If you use a good, heavy casserole (I used Le Crueset) with a tight lid and don't open it constantly, the stew will braise perfectly and have a fabulously tender with just enough moisture.

Both my husband and I have enjoyed this recipe several times. Very easy and good. I also added caned tomatoes, red wine, a little beef broth and some mushrooms. Veal was very tender and great left overs. Enjoy!!

I was in a rush and failed to read the reviews this time. I ended up with a lovely roast. My husband just loved it and asked that I make it again soon!

Yum! I took the advice of my fellow cooks, and added canned crushed tomatoes, wine, basil, sage, and extra fresh oregano. Instead of cherry tomatoes, I used grape tomatoes. I doubled the recipe, nukes very nicely for lunch.

I thought this recipe was not only delicious but easy to make. I added 1/2 the cherry tomatoes which gave this dish a fresh taste and a can of crushed tomatoes. Don't forget crusty bread for dipping.

I have to admit, I only started with this recipe. Veal stew has given a wonderful silky texture. I did leave out the potatoes and served it with orzo. I too used the canned tomatoes. I added 1/3 cup Marsala, and 1 tablespoon of concentrated chicken broth, some basil and a hint of sage to make it into a Veal Marsala Stew. Yum!

This was good and easy. I too added one 28oz can of crushed tomatoes instead of the halved cherry tomatoes. But I also added a half a bottle of red wine and one can of beef broth, and some carrots. It might be good with some bacon in there too. The added liquid made it nice and soupy, like my husband likes. I braised it for 3 hours, adding a bit of wine each time I checked it. I can't imagine making this without the added liquid!

Loved this recipe- so quick and easy to prepare and tastes like alot more effort had to have gone into it. I too used the crushed tomatoes but I will also add more liquid the next time I make it or reduce the time in the oven. I found 2 hours to be just a bit too long. Very Yummy!!

Wonderful dish - delicious and simplicity itself to prepare. Ingredients combine to produce great flavor and texture. I prepared it without substitutions; it served three.

I made this using the canned crushed tomatoes as suggested by a previous reviewer- it was very good and simple to put together. Even my teenagers liked it.I will certainly make it again. It only made 4 servings in my home!

Oh what an eazzzzy dish. It's moist from baking-don't worry. I've made it 6 or 7 times in the winter.

I had the same concerns about the lack of liquid and threw in two cups of chicken stock and 12 oz. of tomato sauce with some corn starch at the end. The next time I will use dry red wine and beef stock. It seems as though it would be too dry otherwise.

Don't worry about the lack of liquid. This dish is easy and soooooo yummy!

I haven't tried the recipe because it doesn't call for any liquid and I'm afraid that the liquid in the tomatoes would not be sufficient. Please advise.
