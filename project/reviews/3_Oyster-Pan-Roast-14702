We have made this recipe every Christmas since its debut in the December 1996 Gourmet magazine. It's orgins are from the Oyster Bar at Grand Central Terminal in NYC. An easy to make, delicious and elegant oyster stew that does not taste fishy.

I'e made this dish four times already It's my favorite oyster recipe next to eating them raw on the half shell. I'm not quite sure why it's called a "roast", when, as another reviewer noted, the oysters are swimming in a sort of creamy broth. I don't care though b/c it's absolutely delicious! I can eat a whole loaf of french bread dipped in the liquid. You could probably half the sauce and still have plenty.

Classic! I will definitely make again. I don't know the origin of "pan roast", but this is just the way it is supposed to be.

Quick and easy, yes, but a major disappointment. Why is it called "roast" when the oysters heat in more than 3/4 cup of liquid and then simmer briefly after adding another 1/2 cup of liquid? It was soupy, unattractive, and overly sweet (I used the Heinz ketchup-style chili sauce called for). A waste of some beautiful, freshly shucked oysters.

Oyster Pan Roast is a classic--rich, full of taste and texture, and mellow in colour. Presentation in a silver chafing dish makes it a perfect Sunday supper for six (but no more). How absolutely pleasant--and civilized--to once again discover the joy of oysters, unadulterated by uncessary seasonings. Oyster Pan Roast is subtle and soothing, a perfect antidote to a cold winter's day.

This was indeed quick and easy. I halved the recipe for a single serving and added about 1 tablespoon prepared horseradish. That gave it just enough zing without it being overpowering.

the only thing I really liked was that it was fast & easy. There wasn`t enuf zing to it.
