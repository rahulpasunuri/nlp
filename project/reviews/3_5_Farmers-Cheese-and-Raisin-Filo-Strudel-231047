I made this a a little before thanksgiving and it came out so yummy, I did leave out the bread crumbs tho and used a thicker filo dough that I found in a local European shop here. I remember my Mom making something like this when we were little and she didn't use the bread crumbs and she also used the thicker filo dough. Definately worth making again. A nice sauce on top is devine.
