This recipe serves as a good introduction to lamb shanks and parsnips. I do agree with a few of the reviewers that there is a bit more parsnip than really necessary -and that it could use more potatoes... but those are personal preferences. I've made this dish several times, as is, and continue to enjoy it, year after year. As for getting enough shanks, when the weather cools and I'm in the mood for this dish, I tell the meat manager of my local grocery story to set aside the shanks the next time they work with lamb and call me. I also tell him to cut them on the larger side, or top heavy, borrowing a chunk from the lower leg. It pays to always say 'hello' to the butcher ;)

It was warm here today, so I adapted the recipe to a crock pot to keep the kitchen cool. Cut the water and halved the diced tomatoes. Used mexican oregano for extra flavor. Used a roux to thicken the liquid. It was delicous with an Italian Merlot!

not that it was alot of wrok, but i expected more flavor than i got. I prefer the recipe with rosemary and tomato and red wine for really concentrated flavor.

The lamb is to die for; tasty, succulent, "Delish"! The veggies were good but the lamb was the star of the show for us. Served a good Washington State Cab (Robert Karl Vineyard) which went well. Would make this again, but might add more olives next time. Would serve with a good spicy red Zin (Turley?) , and Aussie Shiraz, or another hearty Cab. This is a good company dish cause most of the work is way "up front".

I made some mild changes to the recipe based on what I had on hand. I was looking for something interesting to do with a fine bunch of parsnips I had on hand. Instead of all lamb shanks, I used one large one (2+ lbs--had to be cracked to fit in the pot!), some bone-in lamb stew meat and some boneless lamb chuck I had on hand. The bone from the shank and the bone-in stew meat gave the sauce a good body. I removed all of the meat from the shank prior to serving, so it was easier to eat. The recipe was good, light, but pretty standard-tasting. Adding additional vegetables at the end of the cooking gave a good fresh taste and texture that helped make the dish more interesting. Next time, I would substitute more parsnips for the carrots at the end (because there are already quite a few in the recipe), add more olives (because I love the taste and believe they would add more tang), and add some orange zest right before serving, as the orange flavor was lost in the cooking process.

My family loved this recipe. I use less potatoes and more parsnips - just to suit our taste.

this was one of the most flavorful lamb shank recipes I have tried. The vegetables were worth fighting over, so next time I'll add a few extra! For those of you who dont know or like parsnips, this is a great way to be introduced. The hardest part of this recipe was actually finding enough lamb shanks.

Have made this several times and it always gets rave reviews. The meat is so tender and the flavours are simple and delicious. Have also used lamb shoulder instead of shanks.

I not only enjoyed this the first night, but made a wonderful lamb soup from the leftover sauce and the one lamb shank that wasn't eaten. I just added chicken stock, cut up the carrots and potatoes into bite-sized chunks, added and cooked more vegs as necessary, and shredded the leftover lamb.

Although I like lamb I had never had shanks before so I was really looking forward to making this dish. I made it exactly as the recipe calls and liked it but felt that, since the dish called for so many carrots, there really wasn't a need for so much parsnip. My guests enjoyed the dish but also felt there was too much parsnip a vegetable not many of them were very familiar with. Overall the dish was good and the shanks cooked beautifully. Next time I'll try a braised shank recipe.

My husband loves lamb shanks--I was lukewarm about shanks. He made this dish--it's awesome! I'm trying to talk him into making it for our dinner club. A great winter dish--serve with a light green salad and Beaujolais Nouveau. Delicious!

Classic - Hearty and easy to make. Good for a cold winter day. The lamb was so tender my 2 year old ate tons of it (which is amazing)!!!

Very hearty and tasty fare. Certainly not low fat. My wife thought it had too much of a mutton smell, but I didn't

Just wanted to say I found the olives to be spelled calamata.
