The bechamel sauce is really, really good on the pasta. However, I too arranged the pasta as shown in the picture and it fell apart after baking and serving. Not worth the effort at all. And the meat sauce wasn't enough for all of the pasta and so the dish felt a bit dry. The leftovers were awful once reheated because the dish was so dry to begin with.

Ok, this is seriously delicious. My husband requested pastitsio, and this was one of the better looking recipes I found. I did scale it down, after reading the other comments. I halved the pasta. For the bechamel, I scaled it down to 4 cups milk and adjusted the ratios accordingly. I did the whole batch of meat sauce. I have about a cup and a half of sauce left over, but if I had halved it, I wouldn't have had enough. I'll just use the sauce on pasta later on. While this is a delicious recipe, I just don't see how on earth it would work with the full quantities unless you had a restaurant sized hotel pan to cook it in (and an oven big enough to fit the pan). We really enjoyed the final result with a nice Greek salad and I'd make this again.

Great recipe, ended up using more spices and bought canned diced tomatoes, instead of draining, reserving, chopping then adding the tomatoes w/juice to the pot.

I've made this twice now. The first time, I realized the lasagne pan was not nearly big enough, so I baked a second, smaller casserole at the same time to hold the overflow -- and still didnt use all 2 lbs of the pasta. This second time, trying to avoid the same situation, I dedicated a much larger dish to the project ahead of time, and only used one 28oz can of tomatoes. Still, it wouldnt fit and I had to sacrifice the last cup of bechamel due to overflow. This time, it came out a bit dry and the flavors were too diluted across all the pasta. I know there is a fantastic recipe in here somewhere, but the proportions just arent coming out right for me. It has such potential, I may still give it a third shot. Its so close to being perfect! Next time I will make all the sauce called for by the recipe, but use a bigger pan and just 1.25 lbs of pasta.

I loved this! My family and exchange students loved this! There are six of us, so I cut the recipe in half (bearing in mind that four of "us" are young men) - and there was leftovers for lunch the next day. I didn't putz around with lining up the ziti - who has time for that?

Great flavors. I used the recipe in a "bastardized" way that worked out great... I baked just the lamb mixture topped with the bechamel -- no pasta -- for more flexibility in serving. Made a care package for a friend with half of the recipe over pasta (buttered and tossed w/parmesan), and served the other half over mashed potatoes for a family dinner. Delicious either way.

Served this at a recent Gourmet Club event as part of a Greek menu. Nice and creamy. Used lamb ($7.99 per pound) but could have served beef for less and doubt that anyone would notice. Many felt it was like Greek Hamburger Helper. Made a huge amount but didn't want the leftovers. Took the trouble to arrange the pasta like the picture but it fell apart when plating the food.

Really good. Used ground beef and cut spices a little, also didn't arrange pasta as per recipe. Didn't look as nice but saved a lot of time. Four kids ages 5 to 20 all loved it.

Excellent recipe. I have prepared the recipe as written and substituted beef for the lamb - wonderful both ways. Takes a while to prepare BUT my husband did not complain about these leftovers!

I made this for my mother's best friend who was born and raised in Greece. She said it was wonderful and true to her heritage. Everyone else raved about it as well, including my husband who doesn't like cinnamon. I halved the recipe and used a mixture of 1/2 lb. ground lamb, 1/4 lb. sicilian sausage and 1/4 lb. ground beef. I will make this again and again!

Halved the recipe and the only substitution made was orzo for pasta. Used 2 yolks and 2% raw milk in the bechamel to beautiful and satisfying results. Barely fit in a 9x9x3 Pyrex dish. Really delicious for a snowy spring day.

This was good...I halved the recipe (for the 2 of us) and used a mixture of ground pork and lean hamburger since hubby doesn't like lamb. It turned out great! We cooked it together since it is a time consuming effort. Served it with a Greek salad on Christmas eve. Would definitely make it again.

First - I it not possible to fit 2 pounds of pasta and all that bechamel sauce plus the meat mix into 17 x 11 x 2. Physics prohibits it. About one pound of pasta, 1/3 or so less of meat sauce and bechamel. I sometimes use a mix of kefalotyri (or parm) and add in 2 cups of mozzarella into the cheese I sprinkle into the dish. It tastes better with it and the texture is more pleasing. An experienced cook can have this in the oven in 40 or so minutes and the parts can be prepared ahead of time so you can slap it together quickly at the last. I would make it again with revisions.

Delicious. I substituted penne for ziti and it turned out great.

excellent but definitly a Sunday meal as prep time is long and comlicated - especially since I ground my own lamb.

Delicious. I don't always love lamb, but this was fantastic. I think it was perfectly spiced (though I did add more salt with each step in the recipe + a little pepper to the meat). I think I would cut the spice if I was using corn-fed beef or another mild meat. I halved the recipe but used a 28-oz can of tomatoes--moisture was just right. My only issue (minor really) was the amount of breadcrumbs--too much. Perhaps if they were mixed with butter or if part of it was sprinkled between layers it would be better. Otherwise, I would reduce them by half.

Amazing! I made this for a family gathering with lots of kids, as a change from the normal Italian ziti. I was a little worried that the kids wouldn't like it but everyone loved it. I used meatloaf mix instead of all lamb because not everyone loves lamb and it was fantastic. Well worth the effort.

I don't know why some of the reviewers say the recipe needs salt. Maybe it was edited after those comments, but it includes 1.5 tablespoons of salt, not including any salting of the pasta water. It's just not listed in the ingredients, it's listed in the instructions. I often salt my food, but I did not need to with this recipe, which was enjoyed by all who tasted it. The really tedious part is arranging all the pasta in a layer, but otherwise it's a fairly simple recipe that tastes fantastic.

I made this dish for a tradional Greek friend of mine with a discerning palate, and he thoroughly enjoyed it. He said it was better than the Pastitsio from back home! I substituted the lamb with 1/2 pork and 1/2 beef, and I did not use tomatoe paste (I just added a bit more canned tomatoe in its place) I am not a fan of white flour pasta, and had a hard time finding whole wheat ziti, so I substituted the pasta with whole wheat penne. The dish was wonderful. So tasty! Otherwise, I followed the recipe as posted, and listened to the advice of the other reviewers by adding a bit more salt (I tasted as I went along to get the right amount of salt) I would definitely make this dish again!!

This recipe feeds so many that a half batch would be sufficient for my purposes. With the many parts required for the whole, the intent was to cook a full batch of sauces, reserving half in the freezer for next time. Assembling the casserole with only 1 pound of pasta required all of the sauce to entirely coat each layer. With 2 lbs of pasta, the dish would come out quite dry. Very generously salting the pasta water avoided any lack of salt that was noted by others. The bread crumb layer was deep and sandy and overwhelmed the small amount of cheese mixed into it. Reducing the crumbs to 1/4 to 1/2 cup would yield a topping more in balance with the casserole. The cinnamon and allspice came through with a lot of punch, reminiscent of Cincinatti Chili. With the sauce diluted over 2 lbs of pasta, this might be the right amount of seasoning but with the reduced pasta, that punch was nearly a knock-out. A generous 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and allspice would still allow these flavoura to be noticeable without overwhelming the dish. The pasta that began al dente became soft and flabby after being baked with all of the sauce. Better to leave it firmer than al dente and if necessary, mix a bit of the pasta water in with the meat sauce. This could be a convenient dish to make ahead when cooking for a crowd but is definitely too time-consuming and complex for a weeknight family supper.

I am married to a Greek family (yes, you marry the ENTIRE family). The best way to add the missing salt in this recipe is with light-handed layers. Salt the pasta water. Salt the lamb mixture (1 tsp Kosher salt to start) before you simmer for 40 min. About 10 min. before it's done, remove a tablespoon of lamb mixture, let it cool and then taste it to see if it needs more, but remember there will be salt in every layer. Add a pinch of salt to the bechamel if you use Parmesan, but not if you use kefalotyri because the Greek cheese is much saltier than the Italian cheese. Nothing will taste worse than having to salt this dish at the table.

My son and his college-aged friends wanted me to take them to a Greek restaurant in town. My budget was tight so I suggested that I make this recipe for them instead. Rather than lamb, I substituted lean ground beef. What a hit this dinner made! Everyone felt like they were eating at a very good Greek restaurant. Mom earned lots of brownie points.

I halved the recipe and baked it in a 13x9 dish. This quantity serves 8 because it is so rich. I used parmesan instead of kefalotyri, although it is readily available here. (To the cook from Chicago: you can sell cheese made from unpasteurized milk as long as it has been aged). I would cut back on the nutmeg in the bechamel sauce next time and add a little more salt to the meat sauce. This is a great, make-ahead party dish.

I made this last night for a gathering of 8 and thought it was very tasty, as did all my guests. But here are some suggestions (and problems). First, the meat sauce could use more garlic and needs LOTS of salt. It was amazing how different (and tasty) the sauce was once salt was added. Second, I don't know where the people at Gourmet found kefolyteri cheese, but good luck to anyone trying to find it. It's an unpasteurized cheese, and therefore illegal for most stores to sell. I live in Chicago where there are plenty of cheese shops and grocers with great cheese counters. None had this cheese, and a few had never even heard of it. Parmesan is fine. Third, they say this recipe serves 12-16. I had 8 guests who all had seconds, I took some to our upstairs neighbors and STILL had a third left over. This can easily feed 20. Which brings me to: Fourth, finding a pan big enough to hold all this was not easy. I ended up using a roasting pan because it was the only thing that could hold 2 pounds of pasta and a half-gallon of sauce. Unless you're used to cooking for large groups and have pans big enough, I'd recommend halving the recipe. All that said, it really is worth making. I made the meat sauce a day ahead, which not only enhanced the flavor, but made the whole process much easier and less time-consuming. The meat sauce is tasty (though I'm not a big fan of clove, others like it). And the béchamel sauce was divine! Perfect comfort food for a cold winter night.

This served 14 people at our inauguration party all they could eat, with some leftover. The cinnamon and nutmeg was a pleasant surprise and made it feel like a holiday meal.

This reminds me of the most wonderful dish of pastitsio I enjoyed in Manhattan a couple of years ago - it was a memorable meal. The spice mix is spot on. I halved the recipe, and served a greek salad and a crusty loaf of bread along side. This recipe has a place in my YUM recipe book!

I halved the recipe-- I used a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes, and 2 egg yolks in the bechamel. I found that reducing the meat sauce as instructed left me a bit short on the second layer. Next time I won't reduce it-- will just cover it completely and let it simmer a while. Apart from that, it was delicious. Will definitely make it again.

I substituted 1 lb. lasagna noodles (I par-cooked the Barilla "no boil" noodles) for the 2 lbs. ziti, and I built a lasagna in a 12 x 10" pan. Salt and pepper each layer generously! The spices gave an interesting flavor, and the bechamel sauce was tasty. Next time, I think I would prefer cooking or stewing a whole chunk of lamb and then shredding it so that the ragu layers meld better with the pasta layers. Also, I would probably omit all the spices except for the nutmeg.

My family doesn't like lamb, but my butcher, who happens to be Greek, recommended a mix of 1-1/4 lbs beef, 1/2 lb of lamb and 1/4 lb of pork. Everyone loved it. The recipe was easy to do and it fed a lot.

A great casserole for winter - my husband and I both enjoyed this. I halved the recipe, using the entire 28 oz. can of tomatoes, and felt the dish was a little 'dry'. I would make 1 1/2 times the meat sauce next time for the same amount of pasta and bechamel, to give the dish some added flavor.
