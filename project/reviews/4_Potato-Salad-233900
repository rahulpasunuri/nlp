This is my mother's recipe, except that she adds a sprinkle of celery seed which I think adds a great deal. Try it.

I thought it was a good recipe. I do like those people who comment about how great the recipe was but made 3 or 4 changes to it. LOL

I thought this was the perfect potato salad. However, being someone who loves salt would reduce the salt in the future. I tripled the recipe and felt it was too salty and diluted the salt with more mayo in the end.

Fantastic and super easy! I peeled and cut the potatoes before I boiled them and cut the prep time in half. Great for picnics and barbeques!

Delicious! Imagine a potato salad with no onion that tastes good. This goes together quickly and does not need time to chill for flavors to meld. I peel and cube potatoes before I boil them to make the cooking speed up and to make them easy to handle. I also reduce the eggs to two if I don't have three and can't see much difference.

I thought this recipe was just mediocre, however, many people at the Newcomers Cajun Party raved about it. I skipped the celery but otherwise followed the recipe as given.

This is a perfect traditional potato salad. Nothing surprising, just nicely balanced and fresh. I'm making it (for the fourth time) for two Fourth of July gatherings tomorrow. It's lovely as-is, but I may try a bit of the dill pickle juice this time, as some have suggested.

Very mediocre - not worth the effort.

This potato salad is mediocre. It isn't that potato salad you had at a potluck one time that you can't forget and keeps you trying different potato salad recipes to find the same one. Keep moving folks...nothing to see here. I decided to make this because it used dill. I was cooking for some Germans --and Germans think Americans put sugar in everything so I didn't want to use a recipe with sweet pickles. I added extra dill juice on the potatoes as another reviewer suggested, but it was just plain lacking. Bore me to death with this recipe!

Although there are many other great potato salads out there, this version requires only a half an hour of chilling so can be made nearly as an afterthought and still tastes wonderful. Potatoes and celery dominate. I peeled and chopped the potatoes and boiled them while I prepared the rest of the ingredients and had the salad made in 15 minutes.

We love this recipe!! I prefer to add extra sweet pickles, chopped, as well as extra yellow mustard or a combo of yellow mustard and dijon. I omit the celery and chop up a sweet red bell pepper for color and contrast. For special occasions, I add 3-4 pieces of crumbled bacon. YUM. Boyfriend swears it's the best he's ever tasted.

The dill pickle is the answer. I poured about 1/8 c. of the pickle juice over the slightly warm cubed potatoes and let that soak in before I proceeded with the rest of the recipe. My family could not get enough. This is rates as one of the best potato salads I have ever had!

My brother-in-law told me this is the best potato salad he's ever had. Left out the parsley and added a handful of crumbled bacon. This was awesome.

Good recipe - I added the juice of 1/2 lemon to give it a bit more zip, and some fresh garden herbs :)

I made this for a BBQ today and got rave reviews from my very picky family. I boiled the potatoes and eggs yesterday and chopped/mixed everything this morning. I followed the recipe exactly, except I added pancetta. Next time, I would also add some extra dill pickle (personal preference).

Served this for a Mardi Gras get together for chefs. They loved it, reminded some of summer days years ago on the Gulf.

I have made potato salad for more years than I want to mention. I tried this recipe and changed my whole way of thinking. This is absolutely one of the best that I have tried. It is a definite keeper.

Just made this today for a bbq. Coming from a very critical crowd - it was a definitive hit! I tweaked with 2 tbsp. chopped scallion - 2 tbsp. fresh dill and 1/2 rasher of bacon bits - it really was exceptional potato salad. Served with marinated flank steak rosemary skewers - garlic, lime, onion marinated chicken kebabs -husk grilled corn and radicchio, fennel bib lettuce salad - it was a smash!

Excellent recipe...I also add a little Extra Virgin Olive oil and a teaspoon or more of Red Wine vinegar. The Olive Oil makes the potato salad smoother and the vinegar definitely adds to the taste.
