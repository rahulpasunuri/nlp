i had some leftover cranberry and walnut bread to use up so decided this would be a good desert. didn't bother cutting off the crust and used evaporated milk mixed with some non fat milk. cut the sugar in half and it was still a bit sweet because of the bread i used. added a LOT more cinnamon and some dried cranberries. served hot with butter pecan ice cream. delish!

Easy and delicious. I used cubed french bread and besides adding an extra apple (mine were kind of small) followed the recipe as written. Before putting it back in the oven the second time, I sprinkled it with cinnamon and sugar. The bread got crunchy on top from the sugar. Added a scoop of vanilla ice cream - ahhhh heavenly....

This was OK to eat when it came out of the oven but I found myself having to force it down after that. Not as exciting as I thought. Would not make again.

35 minutes have passed and I've just noticed the EXTRA 35 minutes mentioned at the end. Is that a typo? They meant 5???

Okay I added two more eggs poured about 1/4 cup of vanilla and a lot more cinnamon. I soaked walnuts in milk to get the bitterness out before crumbling and sprinkling over the bread, stale home made white w whole wheat ( I have made this w stale protein bagels and it has that much more nutritional value no compromise on the taste) I added two small over ripe bananas and musher up for sweetness along with a 1/4 cup of sugar. I find that if it is less sweet I can add the sweetness in a vanilla sauce, ice cream traditional maple syrup. Nutmeg does add a lightness to the taste. Small 1/4-1/2 tsp. Stuff I strong. I added a stivia/cinnamon strussell on half to see if I get a toasty intense flavor in some areas. It is in the oven. My only reservation is the extra vanilla. I hope It isn't overkill. Wish they had basic info on the use of ingredients. Ie) when is it too much vanilla and will I have to trash the dish. Would be ashamed. Oh I added half a ripe pear to one end. I love to go where no chef has gone. Maybe there is a reason but isnt it exciting to throw some ingredient in thinking you invented an unbelievable dish? We often have to suffer from our inventiveness. When I comment I will share all my doings and the honest results. Oh cooking times seem to vary greatly in these recipes I don't like it dry so I am keeping an eye on it after 40 minutes to see if it needs so much more time.

Very good recipe. This was my first bread pudding and it turned out well. Used 2% milk, and a gala apple, and it was fine. Delicious combined with fresh whipped cream too!

I love this recipe! It's a great use of leftover bread and usually I have all of the other ingredients on hand, so it's very easy to make earlier in the day for an improptu dinner party. I usually use three apples though and double the amount of cinnamon I use.

I made use of brown sugar and more cinnamon and other preserved fruits. I made use of 3/4 milk measurement. Even without apples, still the recipe tasted great :) And yes, this is one of those simple and luxurious kind of luxurious kind of food. ~wink~

Easy to prepare, cut the sugar in half- will probably stick to original recipe next time. I would have preferred it a little sweeter.

This was great. I used light butter, 1% milk, vanilla, and cinnamon swirl bread from Trader Joe's. During the 2nd half of baking, I threw some walnuts on top. I'd make this again.

Fantastic and so easy!! I did tweak it a little bit though used a bit more bread maybe four cups and about 2 large gala apples but the results were still superb! I will definitely be making this recipe again!

This was an easy 1 bowl, 1 measuring cup dessert. AND deelish! Used half a loaf of challah instead of white bread and dried cranberries because I had no raisins, but the recipe as written is perfect!

This bread pudding was great. Nice and moist. It's a delicious way to use up stale bread.

Great way to use up all the half loaves of challah in my freezer. I use lowfat milk (even used soymilk once i think) and it was great. I served once for brunch with a lowfat maple creme anglaise (from cooking light). Low fat or not, it's still a dense, rich dessert - and a great brunch alternative to French Toast.

Absolutely delicious bread pudding. Soaked raisins in rum for an hour and added mixture to dough. Added 1 more cup bread (sliced baguette) than recipe calls for to soak up additional liquid. My boyfriend and I could not have enough of it. Moist and wonderful next day. Loved the milk for lower calories.

A great dessert on a snowy weekend - talk about comfort food. Very easty to prepare. This is an excellent recipe as is. I have made it without apples and it works well that way, too

Rating: 3
I used challah bread as suggest by the Israeli cook. It was 'sandwich' sliced, so I tore it up into bits about the size of the thinly sliced the apples. I used vanilla sugar instead of regular and put it in a hot water bath in the oven. Everyone at potluck and loved it!

Rating: 3
This is really good and easy. I made it with 1/2 cup sugar (plenty), stale challah bread and added some vanilla and more cinnamon than called for in the recipe. I also used two apples, which hadn't fully cooked through even though I had it in the oven for over 65 minutes. Next time i'll cut them into smaller cubes. I'll be making this again!

I was a little disapointed with this recipe. It was just OK, but not great. It was soft and moist and sweet, but I was expecting something better. Would not make it again.

Rating: 4
Well, this was really good. My kids were thrilled to have the other half of the loaf of "white" bread, since I never buy it! I used buttermilk in place of the whole milk, and then topped with a homemade buttermilk syrup, which was to die for! The cooking time was accurate, and remained very moist the next day too.

This was delicious and a great way to have apples. I am allergic to raw apples or apple juice but I can eat apples that are baked because of the chemical reaction that takes place during the baking process. As most cooks do I tweaked this recipe a little. I used whole wheat bread with the crust on and did not peel the apples. Plus I soaked the raisins in some spiced brandy for 1/2 hour to add some pizzaz. I will make this again!

This was easy to make and very good. I used whole wheat bread (because that's what we had in the house and wanted to use up), but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I would not change a thing the next time I make it.

This was great - gave it 3 forks instead of 4 only because of all the changes. I doubled the apple, halved the sugar and soaked the raisins in Calvados before putting them in. I ate it with a bit of warmed maple syrup. Tasty breakfast indeed!

I used half the sugar and twice the apples; it was simple to prepare and turned out perfectly. I definitely recommend this recipe.

Rating: 4
I used craisins too! And even thought of it before reading the comments! Great minds think alike, evidently. I halved the sugar also, b/c my apples were quite sweet. After eating a few bites, we wondered whether or not it would be good to soak the craisins in brandy before adding them. Next time I'll try that. Also, I paired it with ginger ice cream.

Just made this for our company Thanksgiving potluck. It was the hit of the dessert table.

Very good - but I agree - the sugar could be easily cut in half and I have a real sweet tooth! I also used craisins and left the crust on the bread. This is so easy & has such basic ingredients that I will make it again. A good family dessert.

Rating: 4
I have made this several times. My family (except for me) do not care for raisins, so I substitute the dried, sweetened cranberries. Often, I do add the apples, so I increase the bread a wee bit. I have used a loaf of cinnamon swirl bread (and still used a total of 1/4 cinnamon) and challah bread once - great variations. Once, I added the cranberries, as usual, then also threw in some pecans. Very, very adaptable. I usually serve a dollop of freshly-whipped cream. It's also wonderful with whiskey sauce or warmed caramel ice-cream topping :)

Rating: 4
Very easy to make even with a 3yr old. We cut the sugar in half, but I thought it was still too sweet. Would use even less next time. We used stale french bread and left the crusts on and 1% milk. I like the apples since they 'lighten' the bread-iness.

Rating: 4
Super recipe. I went for eight slices of white bread, cover for the first 30 mins of baking with foil and then uncover for 40 additional minutes. Also added orange zest to the top -- sprinkle liberally and add once foil is removed. Total baking time 30 covered + 40 uncovered at 350. Wonderful combination, best I've found so far!

My husband termed this the "best bread pudding" he's ever had! We served it with a warm bourbon sauce which made it a real hit!

I loved this recipe! It isn't fancy but really good. I have made bread pudding in the past that were more complicated and it just never worked out-too dry or something. This was the perfect consistency. I used 1% milk, doubled the recipe and used half the sugar as suggested by others. I will definitely add this to my collection.

Rating: 3
I found this to be a little too sweet. However by the next day, it was better. The only adjustments I made was using reduce fat milk in lieu of whole milk. Next time (and there will be a next time) I"ll decrease the amount of sugar and rely on the natural sweetness from the raisins and apples.

This was very easy and really delicious, one of the best bread puddings I've ever had. Most of my raisins ended up on the bottom of the pan.

This pudding was pretty good. Thanx to the other reviewers for the suggestion to cut the sugar in half. I followed the recipe but ended up with alot of whey in the bottom of the dish. My sister said this is normal for bread and butter pudding though.

I used whole wheat bread, 3 Red Delicious apples instead of 1, and "fake butter." It came out great; I would add ground nuts next time and maybe some dates.

This recipe could not be easier. I did make one substitutiion. I changed the white bread to stale french bread and it was perfect. Can two adults eat a whole pan of bread pudding in one night?

Absolutely wonderful! I changed it a bit, adding some chopped dried figs and a streusel topping, baked in ramekins with whipped cream on top. Everyone loved it! Cutting the sugar was a must, I didn't measure, but it was probably half of what was called for. Enjoy!

I substituted left-over apple-cinnamon muffins for the bread and pecans for the raisins, and, since I wanted more of a breakfast dish, I reduced the sugar a little. It was perfect: exactly like eating an enormous block of French toast. This would be excellent with maple syrup on top.

This was very simple to prepare. I soaked the raisins in Calvados for an hour prior to baking, and I used the "warm bourbon sauce" recipe and substituted Calvados for the bourbon.

I made this recipe twice- once as listed and then again lightened up with egg beaters for the whole eggs, Nutrasweet 3 packets for the sugar, and Brummel and Brown spread for the butter. Both were rated equally good by my guests.

I was disappointed with this recipe. I will try it again using a higher quality bread. Also, I didn't bother to cut off the crusts of the bread as the recipe indicated - perhaps that would make a difference.

This is a very easy and versatile recipe. It works with or without apples. I also made it using a sweet bread that had some cinnamon and substituting chocolate chips for raisins. The recipe is also excellent with the ingredients called for. It has been a hit over and over again.

This recipe was received very well by both parents and adults at a party I had. Not fancy, but delicious. The best part is that all the ingrediants are probably already in your kitchen. My guest requested a copy of the recipe, that's a great review.

This recipe was easy to make and delicious! A big return for minimal effort. I used 1% milk, substituted Craisins for the raisins, and used a Fuji apple. I have already made the recipe twice and my family (including two small boys) loved it.
