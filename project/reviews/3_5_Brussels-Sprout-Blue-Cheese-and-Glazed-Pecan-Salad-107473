I am among those who consider brussels sprouts to be a vile but nutritionally necessary evil, with the emphasis on 'vile'. I made this with some trepidation; I stemmed and left the sprouts raw before chopping them to smithereens in the processor, but followed the recipe to the letter otherwise. I loved it! Husband loved it! Neighbor (who also loathes sprouts) loved it! Who'd have guessed?

Huge hit! This was a favorite at Christmas last year. I baked the brussel sprouts with olive oil and kosher salt, and otherwise followed the recipe. This dish is better if you let it sit for a while before serving, even overnight. My friends ask for it every time I have a dinner party!

This is wonderfully versatile salad. I did roast the sprouts. I also added the chopped apricots and crumbled pancetta. It turned out to be a star recipe. However, this recipe makes 20 servings-I cut the recipe in half and had plenty with yummy leftovers.

Very good. I had baby sprouts right off the big stalk at end of season. added some sliced carrots, as I had them on hand. the color was very nice and I would do again. Lov blue cheese! How bad can anything taste if you are adding blue cheese!

I make this recipe ALL THE TIME!! It has been a huge hit at dinner parties as well as a potluck. DO NOT BOIL the brussels sprouts! I cook them at 450 for 15-20 minutes coated with olive oil and kosher salt. This recipe rocks!

This is a surprisingly good recipe. I was concerned that the vinaigrette was too bland, but when everything was assembled, it was a big hit at the potluck to which I brought it.

As written, this recipe is not very appealing, but it is a great starting point. I do not like boiled brussels sprouts, so I roasted them instead. Tossed them with olive oil, 375F for about 30 minutes (stirring every 10). Glazed the pecans in honey and cayenne since I don't eat sugar. Tossed the sprouts, pecans, and cheese together with some red wine vinegar. After devouring half the bowl, my guests and I decided the addition of crumbled bacon and chopped dried apricots would be great additions, and we were right. With these changes we will definitely be making this again.

My husband can't believe he's eating vegetables!

I love this salad. I skipped glazing the pecans and just toasted them, still yummy. I find it works great as a quick salad for lunch in the mornings made with frozen petite sprouts. I add sliced leftover grilled meat for protein it makes a delicious lunch.

I think this is a great, rich tasting salad and is a nice alternative to a lettuce based salad. I replaced goat cheese for blue cheese.

This has been a favorite of mine since I first tried it. Everyone I've served it to has loved it.

I made this last year for a holiday party and this dish was the first to go! I thought it would be the least appealing, but everyone loved it. I used walnuts instead of pecans because of allergies.

Also did not follow the recipe exactly. Try cooking the Brussels Sprouts in chicken broth. Adds great flavor to any vegetable. My guests were sprout lovers, so this was a great hit.

Ok, so I did not follow the recipe exactly, but instead... I halved the blue cheese and added manchego. I used rice vinegar instead of red wine vinegar and I roasted the brussels instead of boiling them. It was fantastic! Even the brussel sprout haters amoung us loved it.

I am going against the grain as well. The combination of the flavors of the brussel sprouts, pecans, and blue cheese is delicious. I have made this dish several times, and received many compliments. Plus, it's exceptionally easy to make.

I guess I'm going against the grain here - made if for Xmas dinner & everyone loved it. Don't overcook the sprouts - I think that's the secret.

Easy to make, but not good at all.

While this recipe was easy to make ...what wasn't even worth that! I love Blue Cheese but blue cheese with the brussel sprouts produced a very bitter taste! Definately NOT a keeper! The pecans were fabulous! I thought I loved brussels sprout any way! I was wrong : (

I thought pecans and blue cheese could make anything taste good. I was wrong. Just okay recipe. Will not be making again.
