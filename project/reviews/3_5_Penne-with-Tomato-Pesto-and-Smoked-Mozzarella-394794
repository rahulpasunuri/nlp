I used Cilantro and basil instead of parsley. It gave a nice flavor, added a little more olive oil. Will definatly make it again!

This was delicious. Adding a smoked cheese is a must for its unique flavor. If you can't find smoked mozz, use smoked gouda. I also added roasted chicken for some protein.

I added some leftover shredded chicken to the penne and added some olives to the pesto. I also substituted the mozzarella for tasty cheddar cheese. The end result was very tasty an easy quick meal

This was the recipe of the day on Aug 31, 2012. I made it for my gf, who was allergic to the tomatoes and almonds. I substituted hazelnuts for the almonds, and should have substituted something for the tomatoes, because you could tell something flavorful was missing. ***** I had trouble finding the smoked mozzarella, but it should be there in the gourmet cheese section if your grocer has one. ***** I had to use a large tupperware container to transport it (couldn't fit in microwave.) ***** Overall, it was good, and I'd make it again.
