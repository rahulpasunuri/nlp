Made this recipe "as is" and it was terrific. Now for all those changes - that is what is great about this. You can make it your own Scampi as you wish. Lemon? Sure go ahead it's another riff on the classic. More red pepper? Have at it and what about trying a little minced Serrano or jalapeño chile. You may end up with something you'd find in Veracruz or the Southwest. Personally I used "jumbo" shrimp. Although there is no FDA rule about what can be called "jumbo" mine were 16-20 to a pound. And if you, the "chef" in your home" likes it, chances are very good that your family and friends will love it. Try it over rice with a sprinkling of cilantro, or over saffron rice for a change from pasta.

I usually don't write reviews if I change anything in a recipe because it drives me crazy when people change a recipe, then say it wasn't any good. But I changed this one and it still tasted great! My version was a more "country" style~ I used penne for the pasta, and I didn't run the garlic through a press. Instead I used a combination of chopped garlic and chopped desensitized garlic. I used a Pinot Grigio for the wine- not very dry but was perfect. I added broccoli when I added the shrimp to the sauce, and it was a great addition. I forgot the salt- didn't miss it! Next time I may add roasted garlic and some other veggies. This is definitely a dish I will continue to make.

This was popular with the entire family and I will make again. I did have to double the recipe, and when I did I halved the oil and cut the garlic somewhat. Still too much oil in the sauce and too much garlic for the youngest kids. The best thing about the recipe is how easy it is to make!

Amazing. I only used 3/4 lb shrimp for two (on a budget and it was plenty for four servings), cut the butter to 3 tbsp (PLENTY and less calories!), and it was divine. My kids loved it, and leftovers were phenomenal. Easy; just add green beans with ital. seasoning and some garlic bread. Yum!

I was looking for something easy and delish and all I can say is that this recipe completely filled my desires. It is easy to prepare and outstanding in flavor. I used U-15 shrimp-for fear of overcooking- and it cooked to perfection following the same guidelines. Definitely a repeater dish.

I was bored the other night, so I made this on my husband's new gas grill. Obviously, I had to make some modifications since I used a grill- ready vegie pot - but oh wow! It turned out to be great. The flavors were familiar but different. Garlicky and smokey and peppery, and kind of pretty with the grill marks. I also used a whole wheat pasta. BTW - I also spent some time in culinary school, and I know that "they" frown on cheese with seafood. I get it, but I also think that you should eat what makes you happy.

P.S. someone else in another review said they had put "Parmesan cheese" on this dish, I just want to let anyone who's interested know that as general rule seafood & cheese combined is generally a no-no. This rule is something that is taught in culinary school. There might be exceptions to this rule, but I havent heard of any so far.

Fantastic, quick, simple! Keeper {I added an extra 1/2 lb. of shrimp because we love shrimp! But other than that changed nothing else about the recipe.} This is a great dish to serve in order to spend more time socializing with dinner guests. I made this a few days ago on Valentines Day Wednesday for my Hubby he loved it. We liked this Shrimp Scampi Pasta recipe better than what we had ordered at the Red Lobster Restaurant the last time we went there.

Good scampi dish, but not fabulous. The addition of tomatoes and capers helped, also put fresh grated Parmesan cheese on top. Easy and good for a quick meal.

Rating: 4
I reduced the olive oil slightly and excluded the chili flakes and added 1T capers chopped and a chopped tomato just before adding the shrimp. I had no white wine so a nice light red wine worked perfectly. I didn't bother taking the shrimp out and added only 1T of butter. The butter was important as it added a nice creaminess to the sauce. This was fantastic with linguini pasta noodles. Quick and easy.

Rating: 3
I omitted the red-pepper flakes and added chopped tomato and capers, as per previous recommendations. It was tasty. One big caveat is that this is a WARM WEATHER pasta dish because of the large amount of butter called for. If you make it in the colder months, reduce (or omit entirely) the butter and use olive (or canola) oil to replace it.

I've made this a few times and it always turns out delicious -- easy, tastes gourmet. But why does the recipe ask you to leave the garlic unpeeled and force it through the press??? Don't do it! I broke my best garlic press that way. It makes no sense. Otherwise, the recipe is a keeper.

I have made this recipe countless times and, like other cooks here, felt something was missing. So I decided to take action. I omitted the red pepper flakes this time. Then, after the wine boiled down for a minute, I squeezed in the juice of half a lemon, then I followed the advice of one of the recent cooks and added a chopped tomato and capers before adding the shrimp back in. Wow! This was the best thing I've eaten all month. So my advice: OMIT THE PEPPER FLAKES, AND ADD THE JUICE OF HALF A LEMON, A CHOPPED TOMATO AND A HEARTY TABLESPOON OF CAPERS. Yummy. =)

It's definitely very easy to make, but it's lacking something. I'm sure if I read the other reviews I'd find variations that people came up with. I was doing a quick search for a shrimp pasta dish and found this. I just started eating shrimp. (I never liked it as a kid, but pushed myself to like it now since my husband is a big fan. Now I'm a fan!) This is a good base to build off of.

I'm yet to even cook this recipe yet, but according to the ingredient list it seems to be pretty good. I don't understand why in the reviews many people add and subtract ingredients. This is a traditional pasta a la scampi, we should leave it be. Shrimp, butter, red pepper flakes and oil is fantastic. I suggest cutting down the pinot grigio a bit to maybe a 1/4 cup and reduce and keep the butter flowing. If any of you have any seafood questions please feel free to email me MSuza0317@yahoo.com. I grew up on the ocean and have been cooking fantastic seafoods for years. Good luck all and enjoy.

Rating: 1
I dunno. I've made this twice. I added extra garlic both time. The first time I admit I cut both the oil and butter a little. I was disappointed. The second I was careful to use the full amount. It still just doesn't taste right to me. Or even rich, even though it clearly is.

Rating: 4
I've made this countless times and it's always a hit. We make two adjustments, one for taste and one for texture. We reduce the black pepper to 1/4 tsp and reduce the butter to 3 tbs. My daughter preps the other ingredients while I clean the shrimp and the pasta water is heating. I start cooking when I drop the pasta and it all comes out at the same time. Drying the cooked pasta in its drained pan helps all the flavors adhere to the pasta. Good food and a great time. Capers...hmmm sounds yummy!

Rating: 3
For the amount of effort, I thought this was an excellent recipe. I used Trader Joe's Seafood Blend of bay scallops, shrimp & calamari, and because it was a bit on the watery side, I didn't need to use nearly as much pasta water in the final stage. I thought the flavor was perfect and I definitely think it's worthy of serving to guests. Next time I make it I will try it with diced tomatoes and/or lemon zest. Definitely rich and fattening, so not an everyday food, but a great once-in-a-while treat.

I took the advice of others and added the tomatoes, capers and deleted the salt from the list. I used salted light butter and just half of the olive oil. I used almost 1 1/2 lbs. shrimp. Since I forgot to save the pasta water, I just added a little chicken broth. There was plenty of flavor with the 4 large cloves of garlic and the pepper flakes. So delicious that I cannot wait to serve this to guests.

Rating: 3
This is such a simple and enjoyable recipe to make. I have followed these directions four times now and have finally found what I think is a slightly better adjustment. I found it far too buttery initially, and that's not to say that I worry about fat or whatnot because if it tastes good, it's good, but this amount of butter didn't really taste so good to me, so I cut it down to about two teaspoons. There's a delicate balance between the butter and the garlic and the lightness of the shrimp and the fineness of the angel hair pasta, so less butter is more better. And, of course, you should really top with lots of parmeggiano.

I love this recipe. Along with the wine I also add the juice of one lemon. I actually add a cup of heavy whipping cream and reduce it down. Makes more of a scampi with a cream sauce and the pasta dish a bit more rich. I also use basil instead of parsley. Love it! Make it all the time.

Whoever rated this recipe as bland did *not* use the ingredients listed! I followed the recipe as written and it was extremely flavorful. Just the chili flakes and garlic (I used large cloves) would make it impossible for it to be "bland"! Next time I will follow others' suggestion to use less butter, and I'll probably cut the salt in half (or use salted butter and not add any additional salt), but otherwise I won't change a thing. We served it with lemon wedges and Parmesan cheese which were nice additions for anyone who wanted them. All in all, it is a very easy, delicious dish that would be great for company!

I thought that I had reviewed this earlier but didn't see it... so heres the deal... we love this recipe. We use frozen shrimp and less butter 3-4 T and it might not be super gourmet but it is an excellent dinner. We also add lemon zest or capers depending on who likes capers. Anyone who thinks its blend is leaving out garlic and pepper flakes. Super fast and super good.

This was good, very easy. It might be a bit rich for my taste. I just finished it and I think my review is sorta biased because I really didn't want something this heavy for dinner. I think I'm going to find something other than scampi for the rest of the shrimp I've got left.

Used the grill cut shrimp as that was all the local market had in the 16-20 range. Makes it easier to shell them anyway. Can't think of anything I did outside of the recipe other than add more garlic. Didn't have flat leaf parsley so used curled parsley fresh from the herb garden and it was good. This is a very basic scampi recipe but still good. Had I been doing this on a weekend I would have dressed it up with fresh tomatoes, peas and whatever was ripe. However for an under thirty minute quick dinner it was quite good.

This was yummy. Made a few changes. Cut oil & butter in half, added seeded, cored, chopped tomato, and substituted baby spinach for parsley (added whole baby leaves to shrimp mixture just before I added the pasta). Tossed everything in the saute pan, let sit for about 2-3 minutes to absorb flavors (and let spinach wilt), and served. Delicious.

WOW! Another crowd pleaser! I, too, added the capers, fresh chopped tomato along with a dash of "Tony Chacheres" Creole Seasoning (cajun) spice. Cutting back on the red pepper flakes to 1/4 teaspoon.

Oh My God! This was INCREDIBLE! I cut the recipe in half, since I usually like to try out a recipe with just the two of us before serving to guests. I cut the fat WAY down: for half the recipe, 1 Tbsp. butter, and 1 Tbsp olive oil. (We added some olive oil to the pasta after draining to keep it from sticking). Used 1/2 basil, 1/2 parsley, and added a good-sized roma tomato. Undercooked shrimp slightly, and finished it off at the end with the butter. My husband was making primordial sounds throughout dinner - a hit, to say the least!

Thank you so much to the person who reviewed this recipe adding tomatoes and capers...it worked so well for me as I didn't have parsley, but basil which made for a different version of an amazing basic recipe.

I soaked them in cold water for 15 minutes, then sauteed them only slightly...didn't want to overcook since they were already cooked. I just heated them on both sides (they were still cold in the middle but not frozen), then when I threw them back into the pan at the end, I kept them in a minute or two to heat them the rest of the way through. Will definitely make this again.

This was very easy, delicious and smells great because of all the garlic, which I increased to 6 large cloves. Take shrimp out of pan as soon as they turn opaque to avoid them getting tough.

I made this tonight exactly as indicated with the only exceptions of reducing salt to 1/2 tsp and adding one diced (seeds removed) tomato with the garlic. Amazing. Two keys to this recipe: 1) do not overcook the shrimp by 2) keeping the temperature to medium/medium high and removing shrimp once middle of shrimp are almost (but not completely) white. By turning each shrimp as the recipe calls for rather than tossing them in the skillet, you will get consistency with the cooked shrimp. My wife loved this dish as did I and we considered it "restaurant quality." Next time, I will reduce salt to 1/4 tsp as we are salt sensitive. Will make again and again. Great dish for company as well.

Really easy to make. I added some sauteed broccoli and that was nice. For presentation, I would remove the shrimp from the sauce, toss the pasta, plate it, and then put the shrimp on top. On a side note, I found this recipe on the iPhone application while in the grocery store! What a lifesaver that is!

I made this with 3 tablespoons of butter instead of 5 since I was afraid the 5 would be too oily and it was still great. Left of the hot pepper flakes since my sons don't like them. Great dish and except for peeling the shrimp, very easy.

This was a great recipe and very simple to make. We did end up adding in scallions at the very end to the hot dish. The butter wine sauce, although seemed extremely rich, went over very well once the pasta was all mixed in. I thought it would be too salty (we used salted butter) but it actually needed a bit more salt once the sauce was distributed though the pasta. I had no problems at all with this recipe. Absolutely delicious. I was careful when cooking the shrimp in the hot olive oil not to heat the oil too hot because olive oil tends to be sensitive to higher heat. 2 minutes a side for the shrimp and it's was a winner at a lower oil temp. Plus, we made so much... I think we quadrupled the recipe to have enough for 10 people. We did have some leftovers.

I just made this for a party of 8 and it was a smashing hit! Like others, I added a can of diced tomatoes, but otherwise I followed the recipe. Since everyone said it was better the second day, I made it this morning and reheated it for my dinner party. I will make this again and again!

This was so fast and easy to make! The level of indulgence you get from eating definitely belies the actual simplicity.

I grilled the shrimp brushed with olive oil and sprinkled with a light bit of salt. I didn't have wine on hand so I substituted fresh lemon juice, which provided a delicious, tangy acidity to stand up to the grilled flavor. Best scampi I've ever had!

Rating: 3
I followed this recipe to the letter but doubled it so that the 4 of us could have leftovers, except I cooked just a 1-lb box of angel-hair pasta and added the juice of half a lemon at the end. It was delicious, but we all agreed that we would have preferred less pasta mixed in with the amazing shrimp and sauce, and I only added 3/4's of the pot. It was even better the next day, when I microwaved the leftovers and warmed the rest of the pasta and served that with my basil pesto. This is a recipe that is perfectly suited for making a day ahead for company, with the pasta reduced substantially.

Would be better with half the pasta. Way too bland, even with modifications.

Excellent scampi recipe. I added fresh lemon juice as well and marinated the shrimp for an hour before cooking. My family loved it. I sauteed the sauce too long and a lot of the liquid cooked off. I would add a little more olive oil next time with the butter.

This was really easy. I was in a hurry so I didn't read the reviews ahead of time like I usually do and wish I would have. I loved the flavor but it was a little too greasy for me.

I like the suggestion of lemon zest and think I will try that next time as well. Definitely a keeper.

This recipe was excellent. It really was quick & easy! I made the recipe for only two people- so I used about a 1/2 lb of shrimp, and was care-free with the rest of the measurements. I put everything into a bowl, and let it sit while I was cooking the shrimp- I think that added to the good flavor. I too, added basil as opposed to parsley. I think next time I would add some lemon zest!

For those who cooked this recipe and found it flavorless, I wonder whether they followed the recipe literally? We made this recipe tonight, adding two more garlic cloves and some lemon as suggested by many others. The dish blew our heads open with the most garlicky flavor ever. (Not a problem, since my boyfriend and I love garlic and we know each other well ;-)) The recipe calls for the garlic to be forced through a garlic press. This brings out the juice and garlic flavor. I'm sure if you chopped the garlic it would turn out completely differently. Next time, we'll make it with the original amount of garlic, plus 6-8 thin lemon slices, added near the end. The dish a simple and quick carbo-loading delight.

this was delish but needs some modificaitns....i used a couple tbls of olive oil and no butter and didn't miss a thing. also i put in much more garlic (i'm a fanatic) after reading other reviews and it was way too much.. next time i'll stick to the 4 large cloves. lastly i used fresh basil instead of parsley and some fresh chopped tomatoes. nice quick easy and healthy meal (without that vat of butter)

This is the first recipe I've tried from epicurious and wow, what an introduction! Simple ingredients for such a flavorful dish. My picky kids gave it 5 stars. As suggested, I added fresh lemon juice and cut the oil and butter down. I only had frozen cooked shrimp on hand so I was a little leery of using them, but I added them last, just enough to warm them and mix with the sauce. I also used peeled garlic and braised it in the olicv oil a before adding the other ingredients. This is my favorite shrimp recipe now -- and living in Louisiana, we eat shrimp a lot. Thanks for sharing.

It was simple to make and tasted good... but it definitely needs more flavor! I tried adding some capers and tomatoes to add flavor as some other raters suggested... but I think it still needs a bit more... maybe a lot more garlic and a little more seasoning?

Excellent, though I thought the directions were a wee bit off. I wanted to saute the garlic and other aromatics in the oil for a minute or so, and THEN add the white wine. Let that cook down a bit, and lift with butter. We added the lemon zest and juice and the tomatoes per others' reviews and found them spot on. We gobbled it down!

I made this and it was the best scampi I ever made. I took the garlic and let it sit in the oil for about a half hour, then I removed it prior to heating the oil for the shrimp. After I cooked the shrimp I put the garlic back in and proceded with the recipe.I upped the wine and I did not use any cooking water and served it over linguini. Of course i put a lot of parmesan cheese on it too.

While I have made this several times, and the entire family raves, it does require some additions to really make it complete; so as is, I only gave it 3 forks, but with the added lemon, tomato and a sprinkle of grated parmesean, it is a solid 3 1/2 forks.

Rating: 4
Thought this was quite good. Added 1 tsp of lemon zest and juice of half a lemon at the end, which I think helped cut through the heaviness of the butter and oil. Also added 3 small tomatoes, seeded and diced. I think that the recipe would be lacking in color and interest without the addition of the tomatoes - the contrast of the red with the green parsley and pink shrimp was fantastic. Will defintely make again.

A couple of the longer reviews remind me of a story I heard many years ago: "At the ladies card club luncheon, the hostess said 'I made Mary's Crab Gratin today. But I didn't have crab, so I substituted canned tuna. And I didn't have time to make a white sauce, so I used cream of mushroom soup. And I didn't have gruyere cheese, so I used cheddar. I hope you like it, but if you don't, it's Mary's recipe."

I made a few variations, but the basic recipe is great. I first marinated the shrimp in the wine for a few hours. I would stress that it's not important to cook the shrimp thoroughly in the oil since you are also cooking it with the sauce later on. I also added the juice of 1/2 a lemon and a few spoonfuls of capers.

Read all of the 236 reviews, and here is your condensed version: half the olive oil and butter, use linguine or spaghetti if you'd like, add lemon juice, add a green veggie to dish (fresh spinach, g. beans, asparagus, etc), throw in some grape tomatoes or basil for flavor, color. I took in all of the advice above, with spinach and fresh ground salt/pepper. The lemon juice makes a big difference! I didn't have any wine so subbed chicken broth instead (another suggestion from reviews) and that was pleasant but next time I'm going to do the wine. My husband loved it.

it's great! The hardest part was squeezing UNpeeled garlic cloves on this one. I just about pulled a shoulder muscle there. Note to self, ignore recipe, peel garlic anyway. Let's not forget the peeling and the deveining of the shrimp. Whoof. Other than that, I really enjoy this recipe. It is dirt cheap for a deceptively gourmet tasting meal. I don't use red-pepper flakes since it's too spicy and distracts me from the dish.

Was wonderful! I have been looking for some easy shrimp recipes, since I don't usually cook shrimp. This was super easy! I tossed shrimp back into sauce after wine had reduced, and added a bit of heavy cream; just a minute or 2 more cooking, to incorporate cream. It was creamy, but not too rich and thick like an Alfredo. I also used spinach and chive linguine noodles (Trader Joes) and sprinkled some grated parmesan, and fresh chopped parsley when plated. I didn't have red pepper flakes, although I would try adding it next time.

I ran out of fresh garlic, so I substituted garlic salt for the 4 cloves garlic and the salt. My wife did not like the red pepper flakes the first time.

I used Ecco Domini Pinot Grigio for the wine and it gave the dish a lovely taste. I used baby scallops and small shrimp. I marinated them in wine, juice of half a lemon, salt and pepper for about 30 min. while I prepped the veggies. (I used the rest of the lemon juice in the sauce at the end to finish it off. I used Linguini Fini (Barilla) for the pasta and it was wonderful. Delicate enough for the sauce but not too fine for the veggies. I felt Capellini would have been too delicate. For veggies I used 1/2 each of a zucchini and yellow squash, mushrooms, and asparagus. To start I sauteed the shrimp/scallops with marinade and all in olive oil along with two chopped garlic cloves (I don't like a lot of garlic) and some red pepper flakes. Set them aside and added them back in. They turned out tough, so next time I will begin with the veggies and add the meat at the very end of the cooking time. I used chicken stock and plenty of wine (at least a cup of each) as liquid for the sauce. Next time I will try adding a bit of clam juice and maybe some clams themselves instead of the shrimp/scallops or even in addition to them. I made about 1.5 lbs of pasta. I could have made two and had plenty of goodies in it although I may have needed more chicken broth or the clam juice for a bit more sauce. I also added a heaping Tbsp. of margarine but would like to try leaving it out next time to cut the fat content as I don't feel it really needs it. I topped it off with parmesan and some fresh flat leaf parsley. This was delicious. My kids loved it and I'll definitely be making this again.

I really enjoyed this dish - I really found it necessary to make some adjustments: marinate the shrimp for 30 min with lemon juice, garlic, salt & pepper - about 1/2 c more white wine - more garlic - instead of using the 1 c of pasta water, chicken stock is much more flavorful - juice and zest from half a lemon - garnish with parmesan cheese and fresh basil

Wow, way too much red pepper for me, husband and toddler! Also way too much butter--I probably ended up only melting in about 3 TBSP, I was just apalled when I saw how much butter there was.

I've been making shrimp scampi for more than twenty years, and this is the best scampi recipe I've ever made.

This was a little too hot for my taste buds as written and next time will decrease the red pepper flakes by 1/2. I doubled the garlic though and especially liked it minced through a garlic press. Gave a nice consistency to the sauce and more intense garlic flavor. I added the juice of a 1/2 lemon with the wine and zested the whole lemon over the top before serving. Very, very good and simple. (Also at the end I added 1/2 cup of toasted pine nuts; big handful of grape tomatoes, and some cooked broccoli florets.) One dish meal and lotsa color.

This is a good standby - get the frozen shrimp in the bag - just as good as from the seafood counter nowadays. I subbed cilantro for teh parsley and held back a bit on the oil and butter ;).

We saute some chopped pancetta with the garlic and pepper flakes before adding the wine, reduce the amount of oil to 2 tablespoons, the butter to one tablespoon, and toss with half a pound of pasta to make two large servings.

Rating: 4
Although I sometimes leave out the red pepper flakes (for the kids) and have tried to reduce the oil/butter (for our health), it's truly best as-is. Family and friends love it, and it's easy to make. One of my standbys.

Wow! Really good, though I did make some impromptu additions that may have already been suggested by other reviewers. I just haven't had an opportunity to read through the reviews yet. First, I marinated the shrimp in some lemon juice & garlic for about 1 hour. I added the marinade to the skillet when I cooked the shrimp & left it in the skillet when the shrimp was taken out. I also added sliced mushrooms & pine nuts to the wine mixture. Finally, I tossed in some fresh baby spinach leaves to the completed product. Yummy! Even my 2 year old gives it 2 thumbs up.

This recipe is fabulous! The only thing that I would add to make it that much better is add 1 pint of cherry tomatoes (cut in half). It will give the dish a little color as well as give it a kick. ENJOY!!

Great recipe, really fast, thawing the shrimp took longer than anything else, I trimmed down the butter to 3 TBSP, I find that most recipes on epicurious call for too much butter, but I digress, other than that I followed the recipe to the letter an it was a winner, great for a week night dinner.

Excellent and very simple. I added extra garlic, a big squeeze of lemon juice, and used basil for the parsley. Great dish for company when you don't have a lot of time to fuss. I doubled the sauce/shrimp portion and used a pound of pasta. It turned out to be a perfect amount for 6 people.

We loved loved this recipe. Like I always say, I'm a big woman and I have a lot of poundage to support. This recipe does it all. 1/4 cup olive oil with 5 tablespoons of butter. Yeow! It's rich, rich, rich and delicious. I would definitely serve this to the Goldie relatives, who aren't too small themselves. They say it serves 4, I say two ample portions is just about right for me. One recommendation, don't check your cholesterol for at least one month after the meal.

Super easy, fast and delicious. Looks beautiful, too. Have made it many times for my family as they are always clamoring for it.

Last time I made it I only had linguine on hand and I was a bit nervous, but it was still excellent.

This was awesome! I made two minor changes that made a great difference in flavor. I added two extra nice fat cloves of garlic and sqeezed the juice from 1/4 a lemon. The biggest thing I did differently is cooked everything exept butter and parsley all at once. I made these changes based on other reviewers and WOW!! We will make this many,many more times! One other suggestion I would make is to make sure you use a wine that you enjoy drinking!

Terrific flavor and so quick to prepare! Whole family enjoyed, even the young ones. Would only change two things next time: may cut back on the butter a wee bit only because I am supposedly on a diet. May also try thin spaghetti as I thought the cappellini was just a little dense and gummy.

Rating: 4
This was very easy and fast...not to mention really really good. We made a few changes: don't like capellini so we used spagetti and used 1 lb.; added a pound of scallops along with the shrimp; added lemon zest and I think we also added some sun-dried tomatoes. Anyway, it was really delicious and although we had it as the main course, it would make a great first course.

I made this recipe last night for myself and my husband. It was absolutely wonderful, he loved it and doesn't even like shrimp that much. As others did, I increased the garlic, squeezed lemon over the raw shrimp, added a can of drained diced tomatoes to the finshed sauce, I reduced the butter by half, (I was prepared to add all but it didn't need it), and at the last minute I added chopped fresh basil. I also used ribbon noodles instead of capellini. This is a keeper!! And, as the cook from Parma did, I added cheese (Asiago)!

Rating: 3
This was very tasty. I didn't have white wine, so I used a small amount of cooking wine along with chicken broth instead. Fresh parsley was not available, so I used dried oregano. In my opinion, there was enough liquid to cover the pasta(I chose whole wheat thin spaghetti.) I'm betting that the use of white wine will make it a 4.

I started with the basic recipe, took lots of other reviewers suggestions, and the dish came out terrific!!! (Thanks, reviewers!) My husband and I loved it. We added more garlic, approx. 2 tsp capers, approx. 2 tsp lemon juic, and one 14 oz can of drained low salt diced tomatoes. We also made slightly less pasta. Super fast, and super tasty.

I've followed a recommendation from another person and added capers and lemon which definitely add a lot more flavor to this recipe. Unfortunately, after toss with the angel hair paster, the sauce flavor is too mild. Double the recipe for the sauce and mix with the same amount of pasta. Will definitely make this one again!

Too much oil & butter, not enough flavor other than red pepper. There are better scampi recipes out there.

My family enjoyed this dish, but I found it generic. I made two changes in the recipe. First, adding lemon juice to taste, like the other rater suggests and, second, substituting spaghetti as the pasta. It's likable, but boring, an unimaginative dish you might get at an Italian restaurant.

For us, it really lacked something. Followed the recipe except for using thin spaghetti instead of capellini. I thought it needed even more garlic, lemon and perhaps the before mentioned capers. It wasn't greasy and did have a nice mouth feel, just no flavor except the hotness from the red pepper flakes.

Family thought it was o.k. won't be making it again.

Rating: 3
I personally do not prepare my scampi this way. The ingredients were correct except for some lemon and a few capers which I add at the last minute. I also do not cook my shrimp in Olive Oil, remove, make sauce then add shrimp back to sauce. A wasted step in my opinion. What I do is make the sauce then add the shrimp to it and cook the shrimp in the sauce. At the last minute, I add the parsley, about 2 teaspoons of lemon and 2 teaspoons of capers. Made it today, and everyone raved and devoured.

Rating: 4
Very good and easy. Add as much garlic as you want. Flavor really softens. Used spaghetti and added pasta back to pan with shrimp for final mixing. Control sauciness with pasta water. Cheese or not, always the debate with Italian seafood recipes but as my family is from Parma, cheese goes with everything and it helped to pull sauce together.

This was very easy and quite good, but in halving it, the pepper ended up being a bit strong, so I'd recommend, if you don't love very hot scampi, going even lighter with the black pepper if you're making for 2 or three people. Or you might love it nose-blowing hot, in which case, ignore me!

I rarely give 4 forks but this dish has all the elements. Easy and quick, few ingredients, one dish meal and most of all delicious.

I have made this several times since finding the recipe six months ago, and it is always a big hit with my fiancee. To make it a one dish meal, I add half of a large bag of baby spinach with some lemon right after returning the shrimp to the sauce. I also cut down the butter slightly..but not too much! Trader Joe's frozen peeled and deveined uncooked shrimp also help make this a very easy and economical yet special meal.

I'm tossing out my old scampi recipe, which called for all olive oil - no wine or butter. This one is sooo much better. Trying to eat a bit healthier, I used Benecol in place of butter, and Barilla Plus multigrain pasta instead of white flour pasta. The flavors in this dish are outstanding!

Easy. Fast. Wonderful.. I have never made shrimp scampi because my husband is not a shrimp fan, however, perfectly beautiful, deveined, peeled shrimp was on sale and he is a huge fan of garlic, so I searched and came upon this recipe. I used dry vermouth (cooking standby) instead of dry white wine and cut the entire recipe in half. I usually cook with whole grain pasta, but bought some fresh tri-colored linguine from Vendi Ravioli on Federal Hill in Providence, which is truely fresh and less expensive than fresh pasta from the grocery store (a must stop by if you come to our little state)and it was wonderful !!! We were both wishing I had made the full recipe and we would have made total pigs of ourselves indeed. HE SAID, "THIS IS A KEEPER"

This is as close as it gets to restaurant fare. Want more garlic/spice? So--add it! My taste is not the same as yours, so like all recipes, gotta add/delete seasonings according to your taste. Ya gotta know what you/your family likes. And then it is YOUR recipe. I sometimes play with the recipe. Which is what cooking is all about. If you see a recipe calling for 1 clove of garlic & you/and/or your family would like 4 cloves---put it in. This is not rocket science. It's just cooking. And recipes are just a guide.

I've made this several times and always enjoy it. Each time I always reduce the amount of butter considerably, and use white wine to create the sauce. I prefer to serve the shrimp alongside a spinach pasta tossed with a light alfredo sauce, but mixed in or on top of any pasta would be good.

To my delight, the whole family loved this easy recipe. The sauce is simple yet sophisticated and the result, according to my 9-year-old son, is DELICIOUS.

We really enjoyed this dish. I used light stick butter (not margarine!) in place of the unsalted real butter--since it's melted in at the end there was no discernable flavor loss and a significant (250 calorie) health benefit.

This was a real let down. Even with great base ingredients like fresh shrimp, garlic and crushed red pepper, this recipe lacked substance. If you like shrimp and pasta, there are better recipes to try!

This was great! I made a few minor modifications: I used half shrimp and half scallops, which was very tasty, used a little less oil and butter than the recipe called for, and used more wine, which meant that I didn't need the pasta water. Talk about quick cooking -- the entire shrimp/sauce step started when I put the pasta in to boil, and was done by the time the pasta was done (I used spaghetti instead of angel hair, so that was about 10 minutes). I think adding the pasta to the pan with the sauce is better than combining it all in a bowl, because then the pasta can really scrape all of the good sauce from the pan. A squeeze of lemon on top, and this was a great dinner! Next time I'll use more red pepper flakes and try adding some frozen peas.

Very good - very rich. I wasn't paying attention and bought jumbo shrimp (15/16 lb) rather than large. Will use large next time. I also added baby spinach but would probably prefer sauted asparagus or spring peas - this deserve a more delicate vegetable. For some reason I also thought the recipe called for cream so I added a couple scoops of creme fraiche (go figure) - a mistake but yummm. My main dislike is that this type of pasta dish tend to be dry dry so I threw everything in the saute pan at the end (including a full cup of cooking water). There was still a puddle of sauce in the bottom of the bowl but the pasta had soaked up the excess by the end of the meal. This is one to build on and have fun with. p.s. I also only used 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes & that was plenty.

Very good and very easy. I took an extra step and sauteed a 1/2 lb of mushrooms first, and added those to the cooked shrimp, as another reviewer had suggested. We thought it tasted great, but it wasn't until after dinner that I realized I forgot to add the parsley! So with it, I think it would have been even tastier, and very nice looking. I also added a good squeeze of fresh lemon, as recommended by a different reviewer. And as for the heat: I used a full 1/2t of crushed red pepper, but it was the red pepper that our favorite pizza place uses, not the crushed red pepper sold in the spice aisle, which tends to be much hotter. We wouldn't have been able to tolerate that quantity of red pepper flakes. ALSO, I only used 1/2 lb of pasta (for two of us) and didn't need any of the reserved pasta water. GREAT recipe, and I think we'll try adding fresh baby spinach leaves next time (what a great idea).

Fanastic! I did cut back on the butter a bit. A perfectly impressive dish yet so easy to prepare. The fresh pasta as well as fresh parsley are important. It's worth the extra effort.

Liked it, but didn't love it. Didn't seem that there was enough sauce to go around and the sauce wasn't as "vibrant" enough as compared to other recipes.

This was wonderful! Quick, easy and delicious. I would defiitely do this one again.

I loved, loved, loved this! I took other reviewer's advice and added mushrooms and more garlic. I cooked the mushrooms first with red pepper flakes, garlic, and a little butter. Then I added shrimp to the mix (added salt and pepper to the shrimp before adding), and sauteed altogether. I added a lot more garlic then called for. I then continued the recipe as written, although I added 1 cup of wine rather than the 1/2 cup, and didn't bother with the pasta water. I'm making it again tonight and will add broccoli too. This is a keeper!

This was the *perfect* scampi recipe I've been searching for. Might back down a bit on the red pepper flakes, but it was outrageous, and the kids loved it too.

Yum yum yum. I'm not at all prone to overeating and I wanted to eat all 4 servings myself. It came out perfect with no changes at all. I made fresh tagliatelle which worked beautifully. Just one note-- it's worth running to the store for the fresh parsley if you don't have it on hand, because this is one recipe where you really notice it.

Very good for a nice quick meal. We don't care for angel hair pasta, so I used linguine instead. Added some fresh basil at the end with the parsley.

Yummy and easy but I did make a couple of changes. Used 1 cup of wine and reduced it down a bit so I didn't need to use as much of the pasta water to keep the dish moist. Also increased red pepper flakes.

Shrimp Scampi or Shrimp Shrimp, it's yum yum! Easy, smells wonderful. You know best how much spice or garlic you need for your taste buds, so just add accordingly. My family loved it--but I will add more garlic next time. Four was not enough for me.

Bland. FYI - "shrimp scampi" is entirely redundant as "scampi" means shrimp cooked in garlic and butter.

Wow, we loved this! I added the garlic and red pepper flakes into the shrimp when it was halfway cooked, then tossed some baby spinach and a big squeeze of fresh lemon into the mixture just before it was done and it was perfect. Cooked the pasta in chicken broth for extra flavor. So simple, so quick and so delicious. Will most definitely make this again.

I thought the dish had great flavor, but I made it exactly as written and found it a little greasy. I'll definitely make it again, but next time I think I'll cut the olive oil back to 2 Tbsp.

While it may be nothing new, Mr Beppie, it is delicious! I did take your advice, and added the raw baby spinach leaves, which added color and flavor. Stupendous dish!

Prepared as is, I think this is just good, not great. I made some additions to bring it up to four fork status: sauteed pancetta and mushrooms in garlic, then cooked shrimp in that. Put aside and continued with recipe as stated. Definitely needed more sauce, so either make more sauce or reduce the pasta.

really simple and delicious. the only difference is i used the regular white wine found in supermarkets.

Delicious.

super duper fast and quite tasty (frozen shrimp or fresh)!!! will definately reduce the red pepper flake a little... too spicy even for me!!! and perhaps a little more white wine...hee, hee, hee!!! other than that... perfect!!! will definately make this again!!!

Good, and made simpler with defrosted Costco shrimp. Did not need any cooking water from the pasta.

Don't forget to reserve some pasta water, or it will be very dry. And other types of pasta (i.e. linguine) are too thick and heavy. Stick to capellini.

Very simple and delicious! I cheated a bit by using cooked shrimp from the freezer- they're already peeled/deveined and you just stir them in and reduce the salt. Great for a quick meal on a weeknight.

This was simple and delicous - very garlicky! I'll reduce the amount of red pepper flakes next time, I think I overdid it, and maybe the butter too, (I wasn't really measuring when I made it) but it was delicious. Served with crusty Italian bread and caprese salad with ripe tomatoes and fresh mozzarella - yumm!

Loved it ! I also added broccoli (instead of parsely) which I stir fryed with the shrimp, and a bit less red pepper flakes as we had children eating with us ! Everyone thought it was terrific !

I have yet to find a scampi recipe that I was very fond of, but this was an outstanding one! I made it for two, so I halved the recipe. It was wonderful. Just the right garlicy buttery combination. Can't wait to serve it to my sons and their wives for an elegant dinner party! Match it with a French Alsace.

I made this dish using thinly sliced turkey tenderloin. It went together quickly and was super tasting! A really quick meal when you have ingredients handy.

I add some sugar snap peas (frozen and just barely cooked in microwave) and halved grape tomatoes. We fight over the last few bites!

very yummy... and it was on the table in a half hour (not the 10 minutes 'gourmet' said but still quick enough for a weeknight dinner). i sauteed the shrimp with the garlic and red pepper so they picked up more flavor.
