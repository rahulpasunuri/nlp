This dish is fantastic. Would definitly make this again. I went with a regular Italian salad mix and added arugala with it. Turned out great. We used sourdough bread and followed the recipe pretty straightforward. Very light for lunch and tasty.

Very, very tasty. I wasn't sure what "country bread" was, but then Trader Joe's carried Tuscan style bread so I went with that. I also used a smoked jack from the Farmer's Market, which my cheese man assured would be a fine substitute so long as I sliced it thin. The garlic olive oil is really key to this- I can't believe I never thought of it before! When I prepared the sandwiches, I thought the might be pretty difficult to flip in the griddle, so I put then on my George Forman grill for about 6 or 7 minutes. They came out perfectly- almost like a panini. The arugula was a nice side, and I added some sauteed zucchini to the meal. Quick and easy!

Yum! This is a great Saturday lunch, easy yet elegant! I used regular mozzarella because that's what was on hand, though I'm anxious to try it with smoked. I split a ciabatta lengthwise and drizzled one side with minced garlic and olive oil while laying the other side as directed and broiled the sandwich for 5 minutes. I made my own balsamic vinaigrette and added some mixed greens to the arugula. This recipe lends itself well to experimenting; next time I might try it with tapenade.

It was great after a sprinkling of some salt and pepper. This was done on top of the tomato slices.

This was delicious, though sorry I had to tootle with it. I used regular mozzarella because it's what I had. It was still great! No arugula at the store so I used mixed herbs from the garden and tossed with balsamic for my salad. I can't wait to try it as written.
