The secret is to use fresh peaches (not frozen), double the topping, omit the sugar in the filling and put it all in one dish. I

Very tasty. Thought the Skor bars might be weird, but they added a new dimension. In my opinion, more pecans are needed to complement the Skor bars and to add more texture. Plan to experiment by using half oats, half flour next time.

Excellent! Recipe worked perfectly & is EZ to adjust to taste. Very convenient for hubby to rewarm in microwave. Topped with vanilla ice cream and an incredibly decadent Cinnamon Bourbon Sauce (see Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding with Cinnamon Rum Sauce on this site.)

This recipe is really bland. Needs something to enhance flavor. I agree with the other reviews, it cannot stand alone. I served it with ice cream, but it still really needed a flavor boost.

I love this recipe - VERY easy & oh, so tasty. Love the topping! This is a keeper!

This was very good. I too made it with frozen peaches in a 8x8 pan. I used the toffee chips (no chocolate in these) and they were very yummy. I addedd] the extra cornstarch as suggested, and I think it is needed if you don't do these as individual servings. I wonder what other fruit you could use???

Tasty, easy to make. I made some major changes: first off, I used 2 cans of peaches, drained & rinsed (the fresh peaches here aren't always sweet and they're on the pricey side, too!). Didn't add sugar or lime, but added 1 1/2 tsp cornstarch in case it was too liquidy. I used prepackaged glazed pecans (omitted toffee chips) then baked it in an 8x8 glass pan. The sweetness came mostly from the topping, and my husband (not as fond of sweets as I am) liked it, too. I would have loved vanilla ice cream with it, though...I guess I'll have to make it again!

Forgot to add one tip - use firm fresh fruit, and increase the sugar for the filling. This keeps the crisp from getting too "mushy" as some of the reviewers have experienced.

This is the new household fave. I've made it with both fresh peaches and fresh nectarines, and both times it was fabulous. Instead of toffee bits (which I couldn't find) I just chopped up praline pecans (from trader joes)and substituted them for both the pecans and the toffee. This is one of my favorite desserts!

Yummy ! Made the individual servings as written. But this is one BIG dessert. May try using one large dish to vary the portion size to suit each person's appetite.

A great winter dessert when fresh fruit is not available. I used frozen peaches and baked in a 13x9 casserole. I was concerned since other reviewers said it was too liquidy so I added a tablespoon of cornstarch to the peaches and substituted a 1/4 cup of OJ for the lime. Drained the peaches when I added to the pan. Tossed in a handful of dried cranberries. I made some extra topping by adding an extra 1/4 cup each of flour, sugar, and butter - I thought the sugar to flour ratio in the original recipe was a little low on sugar. Everyone loved this. Served with maple whipped cream.

this recipe was wonderful and so easy! I doubled the recipe and made it in a large casserole. I also made more topping as suggested. I could not find the Skors Toffee Pieces anywhere so i used Heath Bar Toffee pieces which worked out great.

Okay, I don't know what I did wrong, but this was the most unappetizing-looking thing I've ever made. It actually tasted good, but looked like soup. I baked it for over an hour and it still was sloppy, wet and yucky. I pully it out and cooled it for several hours, hoping it would solidify, but still was just plain yuck! I did use fresh peaches instead of frozen - maybe they have too much juice? Anyway, not a winner from my end, but it sure sounded great...

To the cook from BC: Here in the States you can get bags of "toffee bits", with no chocolate coating, which is what this recipe calls for!

I liked the topping, and it was even better the next day, but I didn't think chocolate & peaches went together all that well. (I used chopped up Skor bars -- maybe plain toffee bits would be better?) I think next time I'll try it with apples.

I have used both frozen and fresh peaches and find they are both great except do not cook too long with fresh. My husband and sons love it.

A delicious end to a meal. The warm peaches and cold ice cream make this a "comfort food" favorite. It's easy to put together and, because you make it in individual cups, really easy to serve. Our gourmet group loved it!

To the cook from San Jose: how about more pecans and more toffee bits? Also, if the peaches are very juicy, the topping will be softer as it absorbs the juice. When I use very juicy peaches, I use more of a thickening agent. One variety I use(1st variety ripe around here) is SO juicy that I save the juice that collects while I peel the peaches and boil it down, then add to the peaches as Rose Levy Beranbaum suggests in "Pie and Pastry Bible"--really intensifies the flavor.

Very easy and great taste! A few things that I will do different next time though: I will use more peaches and I will cut back on the butter. Does somebody know how to make the topping crunchier? will cutting back on the butter help? Thanks!

I served this last evening to rave reviews! In my estimation this is the BEST topping I've tasted ever! Instead of frozen peaches, I used fresh peaches which I peeled, and instead of the Engish Toffee bits, (couldn't get them at my market) I used 3 Skor candy bars which I choppped fine in my mini processor. My ramekins were a bit smaller, so I was able to pack everything in, then I put a baking sheet underneath to catch the overflow. Baked for 45 minutes total. YUM...this one goes into the permanent file for sure!

have made this 3 times in the last 2 weeks, always to rave reviews. People can't quite figure out what makes it extra delicious-Skor bars. Omitted nuts and always make it in 8x8 or larger pan, adjusting qtys, bit of cornstarch for thickener It's SO easy to make too.

Rave reviews from my guests...except for the one that burned their tongue, next time I would let it cool 20 - 30 minutes. I used peaches that I had frozen from our trees - when I froze them I used suger so I didn't add any to the recipe. I'll be sure to bring this recipe out in the middle of winter!

This recipe is wonderful! Made is with both fresh and frozen peaches. If making in a larger dish, need to add a bit of flour to ticken the juice, plus a little bit of cinnamon is great too!

I've made this recipe three times all for company, and no matter what the variation everyone loves it (I'v made several referrals to the EPI website for this recipe). I've sub'd fresh blueberries once. Also, made it with a mix of frozen peaches and raspberries. Always use extra topping, always a hit.

Really good!!! I made the changes suggested; reducing the butter and sugar. After tasting however, I believe it would have tasted better as it was written. I liked the addition of 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg. I added these to the topping--but next time will add the spices to the filling. Make sure your peaches are well-drained. Mine were, but the filling was still a little watery for my taste. Next time I will mix in 1 Tbsp cornstarch or 2 Tbsp quick-cooking tapioca. I cooked this in a large casserole, and doubled the topping as suggested, but it only needed half of the topping! I put the left-over topping in the freezer for next time.

Just delicious! One of my guests who is a chef said it was the best crisp he has ever had! The only changes I made were to use fresh, ripe peaches and I made it in one baking dish instead of doing the individual crisps. Outstanding!!!

YUM...used fresh, ripe, local peaches. Cut back on the sugar a bit. Easier to make than peach pie and just as delish.

this dessert was wonderful and easy! my sister and her boyfriend were skeptical from the title, but loved it and took all the leftovers home. i'd definitely make this again. i increased the topping as per previous suggestions, which seemed to be a good idea.

This was a wonderful recipe. I served it last night....in a different format. For changes I added nutmeg to the peaches, and I added a bit of nutmeg and cinnamon to the topping. I also served this in martini glasses, topped with Dulce de Leche ice cream, topped with a bit of that caramel crackle topping Smuckers (I THINK) makes. I stuck a Pocki cookie (stick dipped in chocolate)in the sundae as a "swizzle stick"....ergo, I basically made "Peach Crisp Sundaes". I used LESS topping, by the way, for this purpose. Maybe if you were having just peach crisp you would want more topping.

Very good. Couldn't get the frozen peaches so used a mix of frozen fruits incl. strawberries. The only Skor I could find was the chocolate bar which I cut up. Was good though.

I agree with the previous comments to increase the amount of crumble topping significantly. I would have liked to taste the toffee pieces more, so will use more next time. Definitely use the pre-packaged "Skor" toffee pieces -- what a timesaver! I served these with vanilla bean ice cream and Rum Sauce (from the Banana Bread Pudding recipe on this site) -- yum.

This was REALLY easy and everyone loved it. I would use less peaches and more topping. Everyone seemed to wish they had more toffee crumble and ice cream

I love peach crisp so this was just a notch above a regular crisp. I would cut down on the butter though as my topping seemed a bit runny. Also, be sure to use fresh pecans as mine were a little old and it really affected the flavor. I made it all in one pan also -- next time would double the amount of peaches as I like it more fruity. delish!!

I took one reviewer's advice and made the crisp in one large bowl. It came out well, but there still seemed to be too much topping. Next time, I think I will make it without the toffee. It was a little too sweet for our tastes, but still a very good recipe and easy to make.

This is a real keeper. The peaches taste so fresh and the recipe is easy. I will make it in one dish next time. The individual ones are too big. I had lots of left over topping.

Couldn't find the skor toffee so I used an english toffee coated with chocolate and broke it up myself. It turned out good, especially with a scoop of carmel ice cream.

I loved this dish. Substituted fresh nectarines in season for the peaches and hazlenuts for the pecans. I also reduced the butter by 1/3. this didn't appear to effect the outcome which was really delicious served with vanilla ice cream.
