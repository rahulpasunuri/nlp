OMG. I have already made this twice in less than a month -- which for repeat-averse me must be a record. Yes, it's that good: Easy to cook but so rich and complex and rewarding to eat! I always have demi-glace on hand because, although pricey, it is so worth it (Williams Sonoma has an excellent range of demi-glace available). The only real change I make here (besides sparing the mushrooms' "gills") is to forgo the oven completely and simply cook everything stove-top. Works like a charm. Some cous cous and a good red wine and you have a cold-weather meal fit for the gods.

Followed the recipe exactly, very easy and delicious. The chicken took longer to cook through than the recipe called for...somewhere between 20-25 minutes. Very tender and flavorful! I will use more mushrooms next time, I like to have a piece with every bite of chicken.

Amazing! I followed the recipe as-is with the exception of the demi-glace. I could not find this at Whole Foods or Trader Joe's so I opted to reduce some portabella mushroom sauce down a bit and it worked out perfectly.

I had everything on hand when I found this recipe, except used skinless chicken thighs. The dish was rich and satisfying. I served it with sauted escarole, and parmesean cous-cous. Add some crusty bread and red wine...mwah. very very nice meal. easy,yet sophisticated, healthy but rich and comfy.

When I first read this recipe I knew I would use chicken stock instead of water. I used fresh Thyme, lots of it, but that wasn't a solution either. As I live alone, I'm able to doctor the leftovers. I started with doing a half of the recipe of chicken. I added 1/4 t each of oregan and basil, one bay leaf and a 32 package of chicken stock, I also used the whole can of whole tomatoes. It smells a lot better now and will reduce it a bit more tomorrow to let the flavors further marry.

This recipe was easy and my guests loved! The only difference I made was reducing the demi glace. I triped the ingredients and just used 1/4 cup of demi glace for the entire recipe. Demi glace is salty and I found it much too salty with the full amount the recipe calls for!

Didn't use demi glace, but the beef gravy with a little cornstarch. This dish was really amazing!

We both loved this chicken dish. I wouldn't change a thing even though history says that Napoleon ate his marengo with crayfish.

Easy to make and delicious to taste! What more can I say?

Excellent meal. I will make this again. I also used chicken broth and instead of a 14oz. can of tomotoes. I used a half a can of diced drained chopped tomatoes with basil and garlic. I feel a whole can of tomotoes would be too much. I used the demi glace concentrated and had to dilute with water after meal was finished. Everyone loved it. This makes a beautiful presentation for company!

Quick, easy, and flavorful. What's not to like? We didn't have any demi-glace and subbed beef bouillon. It was still good, but I imagine that the demi-glace makes it rich and decadent.

DO YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS A HISTORIC RECIPE, LAROUSE GASTRONOMIQUE SAYS, THAT IT WAS DURING THE BATTLE OF MARENGO, THAT CHEF DUNAND MADE THIS CHICKEN FOR NAPOLEON., WEHTER HE LOST THE BATTLE OR NOT IS NOT CLEAR...IS THIS IS TRUE.

Flavor was rather bland. Cooking times didn't cook the chicken all the way through. Too much effort for not enough reward. Preferred the Parmesan Chicken.

This was fairly easy and everyone enjoyed it. However it was lacking something to take it from "Delicious" to "WOW!". I will make again but it's not a dish beyond compare.

I made this dish twice in one week, it was so great. The chicken turned out very moist and the sauce was fantastic...fairly easy to make and worth the expense to use the demi-glace. I served this with garlic mashed potatoes and thought it was a good combo...a very hearty, delicious meal, perfect for impressing guests.

This chicken was fabulous! It was easy to make and was flavorful and satisfying. We ate the leftovers the next day and they were just as good. Because I didn't have any beef glace, I used the advice of a former reviewer and used beef broth and a little bit of corn starch. it turned out great. I will definately add this to my favorite recipes.

My husband thought I brought this dish in from a restaurant. My whole family loved it.

My husband loved this one and so did I! I started the chicken browning with some rendered chopped bacon instead of oil. I didn't have demi-glaze on hand so I substituted it with beef broth and subsequently thickened it with corn starch mix. Also added red bell pepper with white button mushrooms. I'm sure demi-glaze would've been even better but I loved how it turned out afterall!

Made the recipe pretty much as written, except that I used the chicken demi glace I had on hand, and, like many reviewers, subsitiuted chicken broth for water; chicken was moist and flavorful, and sauce was fabulous with the simple risotto I served as a side.

Rating: 4
This was really good, my only complaint was not realizing how much demi-glaze was required. I will save this just for special occasions because the demi-glaze is not cheap and I used half the jar. It definitely puts chicken to a level of sophistication that I haven't experienced before.

Absolutely delicious. Made exactly as written and cannot fault it. Would definately make for friends as has a sophisticated flavour and lovely presentation. A real winner. Hubby, who not usually keen on chicken dishes like this, gave it the thumbs up.

Good idea using some liverwurst in lieu of the demi glace which is difficult to find around here (and who has the time to make one's own?) I added a little perked coffee to take the edge off of the acid tomato. The family loved it; glad I'd doubled the recipe. Fresh thyme works wonderfully.

Very good! My husband and I are doing Atkins, so I took out the flour and just sauteed the chicken in butter; also, I didn't have any glace so I used beef broth with a small amount (1 1/2 slices, chopped) of liverwurst added toward the end instead. Turned out great! Very rich taste and extremely satisfying.

Excellent, easy dish. I followed the recipe exactly. Had a little trouble finding Demi-Glace, but it was well worth the effort. Will definitely make this again and will serve it with rice or orzo to make use of the superb sauce.

The chicken was tender and juicy, the sauce was excellent, and so simple to prepare. I served it alongside a simple dish of orrechiette with sheep's milk feta, and I thought the tang of the cheese really complimented the subtle sweetness of the tomatoes and the wine in this dish.

My family loved it. Used chicken demi glace, chicken broth instead of water, and 8 oz. sliced baby portabella mushrooms.

We really enjoyed this dish. We could not buy demi-glace, but were encouraged to substitute 1/2 cup red wine mixed with herb and beef gravy mix. Like a previous reviewer, we also substituted chicken broth for water. Will make again soon.

This recipe had such great ingredients I thought that it had to be good. I was a little disappointed because it was just 'ok'. It needs some kind of pizzaz that my current cooking skills cannot supply. If someone is able to add a little more flavor kick I would definitely make again as it is EASY and quick.
