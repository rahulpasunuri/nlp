We did not have figs or pears as others suggested. We used apples and it was a great recipe: moist and easy. We will try again with figs!

Excellent. With so few ingredients I wasn't expecting such a complex taste, thank you fresh figs. I did add cream to the sauce at the end. I will try adding fresh thyme as suggested in another review. Looking forward to making it again soon before fig season ends.

A friend prepared this during fig season, and I've been dying to try it out. When I found out fresh figs were out of season, I took the suggestion of a previous reviewer and simmered dried figs. It was great, good suggestions. Maybe not exactly same as fresh but close enough. I also added a couple sprigs of thyme and rosemary to roasting pan - this is an AWEsome roast!

Wow! One of the best roasts, of ANY kind, I've ever made. I had a boneless leg of veal roast and didn't know what portion of the leg it was from. I used this recipe... and combined a few elements from a Marcella Hazan recipe for veal roast that I found. The veal was absolutely fork tender, moist and with a "to-die-for" flavor! I did NOT have fresh figs or pears, so I used poached fresh apricots (just 3 of them) and only added them to the final sauce prep. Using Marcella's recipe, I inserted slivers of fresh garlic (3 smashed cloves, cut up) into the veal w/a sharp knife and added some fresh rosemary (a few sprigs) to the pan, along with the bay leaves (mine were fresh.) This is one of those recipes that's a real "Winner!" I highly recommend it. Almost fool-proof, but brown it well and do NOT overcook the veal!

Made this for New Year's Eve. I also substituted pears for figs as they are almost impossible to find fresh in Portugal. A huge hit with everyone. Great recipe and so easy!!

It was a very rainy day and I had a veal roast in my freezer and fresh figs on hand. I often don't follow recipes to the letter but this one I did and it was excellent. I will make it again but will wait for colder weather.

Having seen that this recipe is from Susan Hermann Loomis, I jumped right on it. Her "Farmhouse Cookbook" is the one cookbook I turn to with great success every time.

This dish is splendid--and beautiful as a party presentation. Here in Japan veal is difficult to come by, so I substituted a pork tenderloin. The figs here, however, are lushious: large, colorful, and sweet. As a side dish I took advantage of another autumn delicacy abundant here: fresh chestnuts, roasted and sauteed with carrots and buttery pearl onions, a touch of red wine. Wonderful.

I made this in the winter so I tried the pears and sage and added a sprig of rosemar.I substituted marsala for the white wine so I guess you could say I made a whole new dish but I reccomend it

This dish is divine! Highly recommended in fig season! Does anyone have a suggestion for a side dish? I made gratin de macaronis, not bad, but I'd like to see some other options. Thanks!

We have two fig trees in our yard, so I am always looking for ways to use them all. This one fit the bill and tasted delicious.

Unable to find fresh figs, I simmered dried figs for about an hour or more so they were plump and soft when added to the meat. The dish was a big hit, festive for Xmas eve, moist, not too sweet, but subtle and superb. served with an aged bordeaux it was a perfect match.

This is sublime - a wonderfully rich combination of flavours and textures. It's perfect for a September evening when the weather is cooling and every street-side fruit vendor in London is flogging plump, dusky purple figs. I've usually used figs for desserts and with cheese, so this is a lovely change!

The problem here is NO-ONE HAS EASY ACCESS TO FIGS - so I changed it to use pears and fresh sage, much easier to find and I think more delicious!
