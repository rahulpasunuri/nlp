this was amazing! And so easy, The combination of flavors is to die for!!! I used breast with bone and put it on the grill.Yum! Since I didn't have time to marinate I put rub under the skin, highly recommend this. The only change I would make is to use a little less olive oil. 1/4 cup is fine. The arugula salad was so different. I am not a mashed potato person and I ate every last left over!

This is one of my 24 year old sons favorite dishes. It is crucial to serve with the arugula salad as described. I also serve it topped with a lite corn salsa for texture and color interest. I blanch fresh corn, cut it off the cob and chill, then mix with fresh basil chiffonade , diced tomato, diced red onion, balsamic vinegar and EVOO, kosher salt and fresh pepper. I always get raves.

the chicken came out dry and it is fairly bland.

I made this recipe knowing I am not a big fan of rosemary, so I used less than the recipe called for. My girlfriend and neighbor loved it. I thought the chicken was a bit tough.

So nice! Aside from the thinking-ahead part of marinating this dish, this is REALLY easy. I made this and followed the recipe except: used 2 bunches arugula and 1 bunch spinach, didn't scrape off the herbs, and used parmesan/asiago cheese for the taters. The chicken was SO flavorful and the lemon juice on the greens adds a nice depth to the flavor. It's a keeper!

The raving reviews were right. This is a keeper. I used skinless breasts, and left the herbs on. My guests were beside themselves.

chicken was great...very moist. i left the herbs on-prettier and thought it tasted great. potatoes were so-so, esp. considering the fat content.

This dish was ok. The chicken was moist but not too flavorful.Really loved the arugula and would advise to add extra.I found the goat cheese in the mashed potatoes to taste a bit gamey, but that is my personal preference. My husband and I do a similar recipe with onions and cheddar cheese which we prefer. I would suggest experimenting with different cheeses.

Very tasty meal - it definitely has a home cooked feeling about it. Definitely make the entire ensemble, including the argula. This is an comfort food meal with a little gourmet spin on it. We loved it!

Excellent dish, made it as is except only 3 chicken breasts. Pan searing is a bit messy but well worth the effort. A definite must with the goat cheese mashed potatoes!

Excellent dish. My kids thought putting "salad" on their mashed potatoes was too strange, so we seperated theirs, but, I liked it all together.

To the other four fork ratings I can only enthusiastically add my own 4 forks. This was fantastic. Followed directions exactly except used chicken thighs instead of breasts so they stayed in the oven a few more minutes. Do make sure you make the goat cheese mashed potatoes. The combinations of flavors are wonderful. Impressive presentation of an easy-to-prepare dish makes it great for company. Do plan ahead so the chicken can sit in the marinade as long as possible.

I made this for my boyfriend and his mom, who is an outstanding cook. They both loved it. I had a little bit of a problem with searing the chicken, but it turned out just fine. I used spinach instead of arugala and was very happy with the results.

I gave this 4 forks for the 'whole meal deal'!! I made this for dinner last night for my husband and I and we both loved it. I served it per the recipe and not only does it have restaurant quality presentation, the flavors are fantastic together. I marinated the chicken for 24 hours and didn't scrape off all the herbs before pan searing. The potatoes and argulas salad are a must.

I enjoyed the chicken recipe, but husband found it bland and not worth making it again. I only marinated it 4 hours - marinating overnight might be the key to making the meat more flavorful.

So delicious! And very easy and quick to make. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. (And I am a complete novice in the kitchen.)The arugula with the lemon and olive oil really added a wonderful touch--I would use more rather than less arugula.

Made this in 2 batches. 1st time pan-seared boneless/skinless breasts which, of course, turned out very dry. 2nd time, more moist w/ great taste by baking at 350 degress for 25-30min. I left some of the coating on, which made the presentation pretty.

I was really surprised how well this turned out and how easy it was. Marinating in the fresh herbs really makes the dish. I made a few substitutions, skinless chicken breasts, blue cheese for goat cheese and spinach for arugula. And for the really picky one in the family, American cheese and no greens. I really liked the addition of red onion to the mashed potatoes, it made them a little more interesting than your basic mashed potatoes.

I thought this recipe was very good. I noticed that the reviews weren't too complimentary for the potatoes, so I substitued red skinned potatoes (and left their skins on) for russets and blue cheese for goat cheese. The onions blended really well with the blue cheese. They were the best mashed potatoes I have ever eaten! It was excellent!

I needed something new for a bunch of old college buddies. This was a hit. Very easy to do but I substitued spinach leaves for the arugula, worked great...awesome combination.

This is too dog-gone good! Guests love it and it is great to make lots so that you can enjoy the left overs the next day! Easy to make. I serve my chicken with more fresh herbs for looks and taste!

I am a bachelor and love to cook but I seldom do. I commited to make this recipe and followed the instructions religiously. It came out perfect and most notebly, it is very easy to make. The herbs and marinating process gave a flavor to chickent that I have never experienced before, even when I've had dishes prepared by some of the better chef's. My guest thought I was a certified chef. Thanks, and OH Yea, I would love to visit the Fiddle House someday to see how the original compared with my preperation.
