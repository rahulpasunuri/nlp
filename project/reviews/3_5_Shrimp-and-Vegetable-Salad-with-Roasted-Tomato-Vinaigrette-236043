It does need some more flavor components; it's a little watery, unbalanced, I think. From the notes I put with this recipe: To the salad, add ½ red onion, diced To the dressing, add the juice of one lemon, salt, pepper, 1 tsp. cumin, ½ teaspoon horseradish

This was tasty, but I felt like it was missing a certain extra flavor. The dressing was delicious. I would make this again, but maybe sprinkle some parmesan cheese over the top.
