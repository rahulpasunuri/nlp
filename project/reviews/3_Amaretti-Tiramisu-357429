I agree with previous posts, you need to double the cookies. Cookie soak time may have been too long as well. Custard was light and airy. It was a huge hit and I would make again with double the cookies and less soak time.

I agree with cellospice from Charlotte. Something is not right with the proportions. I used the entire 7oz bag of cookies and the ratio of custard to cookie was way too much. The amaretti dissolved considerably, also there was a lot of coffee liquid at the bottom of the dish. On the plus side, I definitely prefer the flavor of the amaretti to lady fingers, and the custard was super light with just the right amount of sweetness.

The cookie to filling ratio in this dessert is off. I bought a 7 oz bag of amaretti and ended up "sprinkling" the cookies over the 2nd layer as there was not enough to make a complete layer. I had leftover mascarpone filling-which on its own is certainly delicious, but was a little disappointed when assembling. Incidentally, there was an amaretti tiramisu recipe on the bag of cookies I bought. It called for the layering of amaretti as well as the traditional lady fingers. Wish I'd picked up a package of those in addition to the amaretti!

This recipe belongs being written in about the 50's when raw eggs were safe to eat in the US. Cooking the yolks, like one commentary suggests, will probably take care of any Salmonella in the yolks, but what about the whites of the eggs??? I will make a white egg meringue now and then, but only because it is baked.

If you are worried about the raw egg, you can always use a double boiler and beat the eggs with the sugar over simmering water. The egg will cook, you must let the egg cool a bit before proceeding with the rest of the recipe.
