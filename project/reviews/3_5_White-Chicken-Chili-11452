This is about the best white chicken chili recipe I've tasted and have twice won 1st Place in the non- traditional category of a chili cook- off. I tweaked the recipe a bit by smoking my chicken and increasing the cumin and chili powder. I also prefer to roast fresh poblanos instead of canned green chilis, but the canned chilis are still very good.

Rating: 3
I thought this was a good, solid dish, but not worthy of 4 forks. I too made quite a few adjustments after reading the previous reviews: reversed the amounts of cream and chicken broth to make it more figure-friendly; only used 2 large chicken breasts, which I roasted first (I think boiling sucks all the flavor out of the meat and into the broth); used canola oil instead of butter; and only used 1 can of chilis. I will also say that it was even better for lunch on Day 2. Next time I make it I will make extra beans and puree them for thickness instead of making a roux.

Rating: 1
I completely agree with the previous reviewer. This recipe is way too milky. I too ended up adding a lot more chicken broth, and that made it pretty good. And the sour cream is completely unnecessary. I think it would be best with the amounts of chicken broth and half and half switched. The spices are off too; they definitely need increased. I'm giving it 1 star b/c as is, the recipe is pretty gross, but you can make it into something pretty good with some changes.

So this recipe as is...is way too "milky". I initially used the 2 c 1/2+1/2 and 3/4 chicken stock. I ended up dumping the entire 32 oz. carton of chicken stock plus some extra I had in the fridge into the soup. MUCH better, it actually tasted as though it had chicken in it. I used 3 cans of beans rather than soaking and only 1 can of chilies. Cut back on the chili powder to 1 tsp and increased cumin to 1 1/4 tsp. I also used a rotisserie chicken so 1) I didn't have to cook the chicken 2) we enjoy dark meat. The recipe that I endend up with was 3 1/2 to 4 forks and I will make again.

This recipe is fabulous if you increase the Tabasco, cumin and chili powder HUGELY -- like 4-5 times as much as the recipe calls for. Made as is, it lacks any picante whatsoever.

Love this recipe! The only thing I change is that I use 2 cans of drained Great Northern beans instead of making my own navy beans, just don't have the inclination to cook beans for 1 hour when I can open a can! I always get rave reviews when I make this and inevitably several people ask for the recipe.

THERE IS A REASON WHY THIS WHITE CHICKIN CHILI HAS SOOO MANY COMMENTS......ITS THE MOST AMAZING RECIPE. I DIDNT CHANGE MUCH BUT JUST ADDED MORE THINGS JUST TO SPICE IT UP A BIT. LOVE IT!!

unfortunately, I have to agree with snacksborden. First time trying to make chicken chili because of how great my local deli's was for lunch (and it was white sauce so I thought this sounded to match how they made theirs). I followed this recipe all the way and found it to taste only of butter and half and half. I then increased the broth volume by pouring rest of the 32 oz container of broth, chopped more peppers up and added more chili powder. then it was passable but added a package of frozen corn and that made it much better. Without major addtions this recipe it didn't taste good to me.

Like so many others, I have been making this for years. My family and friends still rave over it. Changes? Make it first, then tinker with it.

I don't feel right rating this because I altered it so much, but the results were really delicious-- even my picky 2 and 4 year olds gobbled it up! And this was also a huge hit with my husband. I used less chicken (1 1/2 lbs) and poached the breasts in 32 oz chicken broth. Then I followed some of the suggestions of previous reviewers-- sauteed the onion and added 6 chopped corn tortillas and then chix broth (from the poaching), then pureed it. Used only 3 T butter for the roux. Added 1 C whole milk (instead of half and half) to the roux and then added the broth mixture. Doubled the cumin, substituted 1/4 tsp cayenne for tabasco and added 1/2 tsp of coriander powder. Used 2 cans of cannellini beans. I also added some leftover corn (2 ears worth). Did not cook with the cheese but just added to individual servings as desired. It turned out great!

I was not happy with this chili at all. I made it hoping to enter it in a chili cookoff and was so disappointed with the taste. All I could taste was butter and fat from the half & half. I tried adding more seasoning and even more broth hoping to cut the heaviness but I didn't work. All 6 of us agreed it would never win a cookoff. I won't make it again.

I am reviewing this recipe w/ no stars because I modified it heavily, but it was a great starting point for me. I used canned beans (2-15oz), a Costco rotisserie chicken and no Tabasco (I served to the twins and their cousins). I used 1% milk instead of 1/2 & 1/2 and upped the stock (homemade). I also added some chopped cilantro at the end with the sour cream and cheese. I cut back on both of those also. When I made the roux I made it brown for more flavor. The soup turned out wonderful. I got a text from my brother in law thanking me for the leftovers and its gonna be on the rotation from now on!

4 forks as modified by other users. I had white chicken chili at a restaurant once and have been searching for a recipe that would replicate the warm spices and comforting deliciousness ever since. This one came very close -- as modified. I took another reviewer's suggestion and sauteed the onions in the chicken juices and some butter, then added 6 chopped corn tortillas and 4 cups of broth and blended, set aside. Then I used 3T of butter and the 1/4 C flour for the roux, added 3/4 C half&half and the broth mixture and followed the recipe from there (w/ 2 cans goya white beans instead of dried, and cheese as a topping, not an ingredient). It was fabulous, and everyone at our party came back for seconds!

I liked the taste of this recipe, but found it to be excessively rich- almost like mac and cheese without the noodles. I think I would search for a "cleaner" version of white chili next time.

This recipe had some of the highest number of reviews, so I thought I'd try it over the other White Chicken Chili recipes. I made with ground chicken and used canned beans for shortcuts. I also added frozen corn as another reviewer suggested. I also added a chopped fresh green pepper and jalapeno with the onion in step one. Served with tacos and margaritas. I would make again as it was fairly easy and good.

True story. I made this recipe for a chili cook-off at work after reading the reviews. So, I used some of the modifications. Guess who won, someone who made this chili using the exact recipe. I mean this white chili won over all 20 of the other chilies and this is Texas. Lesson learned.

Rating: 4
Outstanding flavor! Quickest dinner we've had in a long time. Minor modifications were made in our preparation: We sauteed cubed chicken in butter, set aside, then caramelized the onions in butter before preparing the roux. (Set aside the onions in a bowl before starting the roux.) We omitted the Tabasco sauce (we don't care for it), but didn't miss the extra heat. It was delicious topped with diced avocado as well. The greatest plus from our dinner tonight: our three year old inhaled it! (Don't forget the sour cream eyes and the sliced avocado smile while plating.) Victory!!

Excellent recipe; delicious, rich and hearty chili. I use 3 regular sized cans of white kidney beans and the meat from a ready-cooked rotisserie chicken when I'm in a hurry. Tastes just as good!

Rating: 3
I read all 203 reviews which consisted mostly of suggestions made early on. I halved the recipe and used 1 pound of cooked, shredded Costco (the best!) roasted chicken and it was way too much. So I had to adjust the recipe. I used 1+ cans chicken broth; 1/4C cream; 3/4C FF milk to get it to the right consistency. I don't think the roux would be necessary at all since the soup is so thick or at most halve it. I doubled the chili powder and cumin and added a 2nd can of chilies; 1 can of drained cannellini beans, and 1 whole onion instead of half. The result bordered on being a little too spicy but a great consistency and flavor. I served light sour cream,jack cheese; chopped cilantro and salsa on the side. REALLY good, creamy chili but it was hardly following the recipe quantities. I served this with a simple salad for a nice weeknight dinner.

Rating: 4
I use halibut instead of chicken since we have an abundance. With no sour cream, 2% milk, very little cheese and canned or fresh tomatoes this comes out like a fancy bisque with vegetables. I renamed my version "Mexican Riviera Bisque" as some were turned off by fish chili but whatever name you call it, it is still great.

Oh, and use a bit less chicken (two big breasts) and always canned beans...so much easier. I cooked the cubed (with salt and pepper) chicken completely, then removed it and made the roux in the same pan...

This was great, but with some major fat-reducing modifications. I swapped the amounts of broth (2 cups) and half and half (3/4 cup, and used fat free half and half as well) and only made the roux with a couple of tablespoons of butter (onions cooked in a little canola oil). This is rich as can be, even with these modifications. Just serve the sour cream and cheese on the side, if at all. Definitely awesome with some really good tortilla chips.

Rating: 0
I wish I had read all the reviews before I started making this. It was a 2 1/2 hour ordeal and needed so much adjusting. If I could start over, I would not cook any beans. I ended up trashing the ones I cooked and using canned beans - which are softer. I also would have used two cans of beans if I'd had another on hand. I liked starting with a roux for a base and will probably use the juices left from cooking the chicken as part of that next time for flavor. The amount of half and half is just obscene. I would cut that down by nearly half. I ended up adding more and more chicken broth to keep the chili from getting too thick. I think I would also leave out the cheese and use a small amount as a garnish. There is a generous amount of chicken - more than I like in a bowl of chili - another good reason to use more beans and liquid...you can easily increase the number of servings by doing so. Will probably remake the left overs with more beans/broth/spices in a day or two.

I love this, I cook the onion in 3T the butter or olive oil, then add 6 to 8 chopped up freash corn tortillas, and saute until soft. I then add a quart of chicken broth, and bring to a boil, then puree this. I make a roux in the pan and use 3T butter and the flour, then add the thickend chicken broth/onion/tortilla mixture. Nice mexican flavor and not as much butter or cream. I use 1C of half and half. I double the spices. I use two cans of beans, and rotisserie chicken, turkey left over, or sauted chicken. All are good. I also add a bag of frozen corn. I serve cheese on the side, as well as the sr cream and quacamole. Everyone loves this recipe.

The was the BEST white chili I have ever made. I doubled spices as others have suggested, used canned beans (2 can instead of one), and used fat free half and half. I did omit the chilies and tabasco and chose not to use sour cream to keep it little lighter. To spiff up the chicken, I cooked the breasts in a saucepan, sprinkling them with cumin and chili powder for flavor, and then shredded them in my food processor. The product was so flavorful, a great fall meal, and although a little laborious, it was very worth it! A definate "make again!"

Based on prior reviews, I substituted 2 cans of white kidney beans for the dry beans, 2 cups chicken broth & 3/4 cup non-fat milk for the liquid, doubled ALL the spices, used pepper jack. We served with yogurt, homemade salsa, tortilla chips & cheese. My 6 yr old added a scoop of barley to her bowl and liked it better. Nice dish for family to customize as they liked. If you have leftovers, you can serve over lettuce like a taco salad.

Use one can of black beans and one can of white beans, never half and half...whole milk and more broth. Jarred roasted red peppers, adobo sauce and a hand full of frozen corn. Usually use rotisserie chick from the market. Never add the cheese...use it as an side with the sour cream, instead. So easy. So yummy.

In addition to everyone's suggestions to double the spices, I added 1 tsp crushed garlic. I used 2 cans white kidney beans in place of the dry. I adapted the recipe to my crock pot by putting everything but the white sauce in the crock for 8-10 hours. I made the sauce separately and added, along with the cheese, in the last 30 minutes of cooking. Turn the crock up to high to ensure thickening. It was delicious - a big hit!

I used one can of drained, rinsed white beans instead of dry. Also doubled spices and used skim milk as recommended by another reviewer. I also used cooked, cubed chicken breasts (about 5) instead of thighs. Mine was a little thick so I just added more broth until it was at the consistency that I wanted. Served it with salsa and sourcream over the top. Everyone really liked the flavor. Will definitely make this one again. Was a big hit!

I hate to be the lone dissenting opinion as I really wanted to love this dish, but I didn't. I found it flavorless (so I added more cumin and some cayenne), but that didn't help much.

I ended up throwing out all the leftovers which I almost never do.

I made some of my own adjustments but this recipe was still SO good! I think the roux sets this chili apart from some other white chicken chili recipes. The changes I made: I used canned northern beans, used 1 cup of broth, 1 cup of whole milk and 3/4 cup of skim milk (that's all i had on hand). Used chipotle chili powder which made it pretty spicy so i left out tabasco. Also doubled the amount of spices. My husband loved it and my 2 yr old toddler even ate some!! I am definitely making this again!

I have been making this chili on a regular basis since my dad's 50th birthday party in 2002. I have never served it without at least one person asking for the recipe! I have always modified itthough. I always double-up the spices, use skim milk istead of cream, and add pepper-jack cheese instead of regular Monterey Jack. Also because I'm always in a hurry I buy canned beans instead, whatever kind I find first, usually cannellini. I tried the Chipotle Tobasco that one user mentioned in his review the last time I made it, and it was really delicious, but it didn't have quite the same kick as my usual pot so I added regular Tobasco to it as well. I love this recipe.

This is a very good recipe. I did alter it a bit. Try switching the quantities of chicken broth and half & half. Still very creamy but not too rich.

Only chili that was finished and had many requests for the recipe.

Think of this as a great base and go from there. It's quite bland until you add more chilies and more seasoning. You do NOT need to use 1/2 and 1/2. The roux makes it plenty rich and thick. Likewise, no need to use the Jack cheese in the chile. Use it as a garnish instead. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs and they added more depth to the flavor. This recipe is definitely one to play around with.

I am a great fan of slow cooking and adapted this recipe for my crock pot. I cooked dry beans and chicken in water with the onion and spices overnight.

Strictly from a convenience perspective, I will definitely make this again. From a taste perspective, this recipe did need some tweaking. The amount of spices needed here need to be doubled and then some. I added a tablespoon and a half of chili powder and two teaspoons of cumin. I also add my spices directly into the butter/flour mixture while it is cooking and I did not cook the onions seperately. I just did it all in the same pot to save dishes. I didn't have the problem of the roux being over-thick, but that might have been because I eye-balled the amount of flour I used. I also used leftover roasted chicken. To the person who had lumps from adding cold liquid, that alone should not have caused it to clump up. If you whisk while gradually adding the liquid, you avoid lumps. This is the case in any roux. The only advantage of adding hot liquid is that you don't have to wait as long for the roux to come up to temperature and get thicker. :)

I am giving this recipe two forks, because as written, that is what it deserves. However, thanks to all the great information (the reviews are what make this site invaluable for me!), I turned this into a spectacular dish worthy of four forks! I cut the roux in half, used 2 cans of cannellini beans, left over grilled chicken breasts, & increased the spices significantly, probably slightly more than double. I also used 3 cups of HOT chicken stock and 1 cup HOT of 1/2 & 1/2. I find the liquid added to roux must be hot, or it gets lumpy...maybe it's just me? Regardless, make sure you cook the roux long enough so you get that nutty yumminess when it turns caramely color. I did drain and rinse the beans, but the chili is still very thick, and I probably could have used 4 or 5 cups of chicken stock. It's very rich, even before adding the 1/2 & 1/2, so I don't think using milk would hurt it. Oh, I also used chipolte Tobasco, and ancho chili powder, and am going to serve the sour cream on the side. This is happy, warm your tummy food!

I love this chili! It's a little rich, but so delicate and yet has a little kick to it! I added a bit more chili powder, topped with salsa, sour cream and some green onions. I agree with another reviewer, that perhaps some bell peppers or corn would add a more rounded out feeling to this dish.

I worked at the Kitchen for Exploring Foods which created this recipe, and it was the one recipe I really wanted. We sold gallons! I'm so happy to find it on Epicurious and can hardly wait to make it. I appreciate reading all the modifications, and I'll attempt to make it lower in fat to ease the guilt, but believe me, it's fabulous as created!

i read the reviews and did it this way... 2 tbs butter w/ the onions, 2 tbs butter with the roux, fat free half and half, a full cup of chicken broth, a can of northern beans and a 7 oz can of chopped gr chiles - double the spices and used cubed pepper jack cheese = only 4 oz. let it simmer like that for about half an hour. i am telling you - this is very good stuff! it was plenty rich without the sour cream. oh, and i used 4 pre-cooked (slow roasted) boneless skinless chicken breasts. my health conscious guys LOVED it!

This is a wonderful dish for a chilly night. I made a few changes, mostly to save time (thanks to everyone for suggestions!): used only 4 Tbs butter in the roux, added a full cup of chicken broth, whole milk instead of half and half, rotisserie chicken, 2 cans navy beans drained & rinsed, added a small can of Mexican corn (a nice sweetness to balance the spice), and added only 3 ounces of the jack cheese (I used pepper jack) and none of the sour cream, preferring that on the side. Some day when I have more time I'll make it the way it was intended.

With changes (doubling spices), this is a four-fork recipe. Husband proclaimed it "the best chili ever." Reduced fat content using evaporated condensed skim milk (two cans).

I made this and plan to make it again often. It is a great rich and flavorful chili. I used canned white beans and it turned out great but I will try soaking them when I am able to plan ahead more. I froze the leftovers and enjoyed it all over again. Its also pretty simple to make! I actually cut down on the butter and added 1/2 and 1/2 to reduce the fat content and it was still great.

This chicken chili always receives rave reviews. For a little variation, I sometimes use canned chipotles instead of the plain jalapenos. The deep smokiness contrasts well with the rich creaminess of this chili. I always use supermarket rotisserie chickens for this...SO EASY!

This recipe was VERY good after making the following modifications based on previous reviews and personal taste: when sauteeing the onion, I added half tsp cumin and chili powder and 4 minced garlic cloves. Used 1 cup half and half, 2 cups chicken broth. I doubled all spices other than salt and pepper and used shredded chicken and 2 cans northern white beans. Served the cheese and sour cream as a garnish, not added into chili. Also cut flour tortilla into matchsticks and toasted to sprinkle on top. As is, this recipe is not a 3. Make the modifications and it's 100% better!

I made this recipe with 2 modifications, based on suggestions from previous reviews. One, I used 3 cans of great northern beans (huge timesaver), and second, I used a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store (another timesaver). Oh, and I also used a whole can of chicken broth. It was still very thick, I can't imagine using less. It was AMAZING! So delicious, and even better the second day. As is, the chili is not particularly spicy, which is how I prefer it. If you like spicy, you should increase the chili powder, tabasco, etc. YUM!!

Rating: 3
Great taste and flavor. Wouldn't call this chili though, more like cheese soup. As others have written, this is thick and rich if you follow exact recipe directions. Next time will add more chix broth to achieve more of a chili instead of cheese soup. Definite keeper.

Great taste! Even my 88yo mother-in-law loved it. Had to improvise a little...2 cans white kidney beans, 2% milk, and no sour cream added. Added 2 tbsp sherry vinegar and a couple cloves of garlic at the end... Even better the next day but needed some thinning. Am emailing to a friend... a keeper!

Rating: 3
This is GREAT! Reviewers' tips I also used: I bought a roasted chicken from the supermarket. I substituted whole milk instead of half and half (2% next time), used about an additional cup of broth AND another cup or so of water (this gets very thick). Instead of navy beans, I used three cans of drained cannellini beans - probably one too many. I agree with an earlier review and wish I'd halved the butter in the roux. I used one can jalapenos and one can green chilis. Chili was so rich already, we didn't even add sour cream. If you buy a prepared chicken, this dish is a snap. I paired it with another epicurious recipe "SPINACH, CORN AND ROASTED PEPPER SALAD WITH CHIPOTLE DRESSING". The two really went nicely together.

Like others said, too thick but easy to remedy. My husband loved it. Needed a lot of hot chilis to add heat - I like a spicy chili. Great on a cold winter night. Leftovers were also great.

I only used about half the roux called for and it was still quite thick. I added another 1/2 cup of chicken stock and that seemed to help. After following the recommended quanitites for the spices, I found it quite bland, so I doubled the cumin and chile powder and tripled the tabasco. It was much better with the extra kick, but still far from spicy. Next time I would add more chopped green chiles and a couple shots of chili flakes. The cilantro is a must.

Very tasty--all my tasters loved it! I did make the changes suggested like using one can evaporated milk and remainder of liquid was chicken stock. Used red chiles for color, and canned black-eyed peas and pinto beans with jalapenos. I left out the cheese and sour cream and instead passed them as garnishes so each could use as much/little as wanted. Also served it over crushed tortilla chips for a bit of texture and passed more as garnish.

Good Stuff!! I'm not even a very good cook, and this turned out great! I didn't have any navy beans on hand, so I used three cans of butter beans that I had. I taste tested the mixture before adding the cheese and sour cream. I think it would have been fine without the extra added calories. I did add more tabasco sauce to my own bowl later.

Good chili. I,like other reviewers, added more spices as I found it to be a bit bland and did not add the cheese until serving. Will make it again, only adding less liquid. I would have preferred the chili to be thicker.

Fantastic! This chili recipe is so different - it's spicy and flavorful but also rich and creamy. I did end up adding more chili powder, cumin and hot pepper sauce at the end because I thought it needed more seasoning, so next time I would definitely double them at the outset. This is a great recipe!

What a wonderful dish! I've never been asked for a recipe more times than with this dish. I rubbed the chicken with cumin, cayenne, garlic powder and salt & pepper, then grilled it. I shredded half of the chicken, then diced the other half -- which made for a very nice consistency. I also upped the broth to 1 cup chicken and 1 cup ham boullion. Served it with a dollup of sour cream, baked thin tortilla strips and chopped green onions.

I, unlike the others that rated this recipe, used the half and half. It was so delicious I don't doubt that you could cut the half and half and still have it tasted delicious.

I let this sit in the refrigerator overnight and served it the second day. I think the flavors were much better that way, as I found it a little bland just after completion. I used whole milk instead of half and half, and had to add a whole additional can of chicken broth to get the consistency right. I also used cubed jalapeno jack cheese rather than shredded Monterey Jack, just because I had it on hand from a party the previous weekend. Doubled the chili powder, and it turned out very tasty. I served it with chopped tomato on top, and lime tortilla chips on the side. Yum!

Yummy! Made this for Halloween and my husband said this is a keeper. I used 1% low-fat milk instead of the cream to cut down on fat and calories. I also used reduced-fat cheese and sour cream. To add a bit more kick, I used 1 can chopped jalapenos and 1 can chopped green chilies. Turned out great!

Excellent! If you like Chili's Southwest Chicken Soup, you'll love this. Very thick, balanced and rich. I fried some tortilla strips and laid them on top of each bowl along with chives and cheese. Made for a good presentation and the homemade 'chips' make for a great contrast in texture. Highly recommended for guests and a cool night!

This is a wonderful recipe! I made the following changes: Instead of dried beans I used 3 cans of Navy Beans. I did not use half and half at all. I used 1 1/2 cans of chicken broth - one of the cans was roasted garlic flavor. 1/2 can of water. This recipe calls for 2 lbs of chicken. I bought a 2.5 lb bag of chicken tenders and cooked the whole thing. My family enjoyed this and I froze the remainder.

Holy Moly - I felt the need to log in from my home computer to rate how fantastic this recipe is. Amazing - the best white chicken chili I have ever tasted hands down. First, let me say that I used a roasted chicken from the deli. I am sure there are people out there who prefer to cook their own chicken, but I find roasted deli chickens to be moist, flavorful & delicious (not to mention simple). I headed the advice of others and cut down on the cream and doubled up on the broth. The chili was still super thick, so I'd venture to say it'd be too thick with all the cream. I also added a ton of hot sauce which vastly improved on the taste. All in all I think this is a fabulous recipe that I would be proud to serve to guests and family members alike. I'm wondering if anyone has tried to freeze the leftovers? I'm afraid it won't freeze right because of the cream. I'll be sure to test and let everyone know the results. p.s. I forgot to mention that I also used canned navy beans. It said on the can that they were flavored with "slab bacon and jalapeno". The beans were excellent. The whole recipe took me 15 minutes start to finish!

Rating: 3
I used canned beans and hot peppers to give it some zip. Used all chicken broth and no half and half and still got an excellent result. This is a very "customizable" recipe. A little green salad with a light mango dressing and some crusty bread... yum. Try it, you'll not be disappointed.

I have made this dish many times. Everyone loves it! I have a friend that wants to serve this in his restaurant. I changed the recipe some what to serve 20. I doubled everything except the chicken both and the half & half, with these two item I added a large can of the broth and 3 cups of the half & half.I also add a can of mexican corn. When cooking the roux I let it get a nice light brown. This adds more flavor.I also feel once you make this great chili, the next time you make it you will adjust the spices to taste. I happene to love cumin.I always make the chili the day before I'm going to sever it. It's one of those dishes that is even better the next day. P.S. This recipe was a big hit at SuperBowl.

A friend served this at a Super Bowl Party. I loved it and had to have the recipe. We have rule in my family that you have to at least try one bite.

after making a heavily modified (quicker, lower in fat, one-pot) version of this recipe, i discovered that what i did was unwittingly prepare another recipe on epicurious entitled "white bean chicken chili". check it out -- i think the people who've like this one but find it a tad too rich will really enjoy that one (there's not much difference in ingredients). i followed the advice of many previous cooks to lower the amount of fat and speed things up. i sauteed 1 med red onion + 5 cloves garlic in 2 tbsp olive oil; added chili powder, 2 tsps cumin, 1/2 tsp oregano, sauteed 1 min; added 2 tbsp butter and four (raw) chicken breasts, cubed (1 1/3 lb), cooked 5 min; then i sprinkled it w/ ~1/8 c flour, cooked for 2 min; then added 1 can evaporated milk, 1 can chicken broth, 1 can goya small white beans, ~1/2 cup leftover chopped roasted poblano chiles, and ~1/2 cup monterey jack cheese and simmered till cooked through (20-25 min). i have noidea how my proportions compare to the original recipes'. i definitely had too much chicken, which i later balanced by adding another can of beans (which made it a very thick chili). also, i would add the cheese at the end. it gives the sauce a grainy look (though it doesn't change the taste/texture). other than that, it was delicious, and took me about 40 minutes in just one pot, on a weeknight.

Try making this with condensed milk and three times the amount of chicken broth. Also added cilantro to the onions.

I have made this several times and have made a few changes along the way. Taste greatly enhanced by substituting chicken thighs for breasts. Instead of sauteeing whole thighs, I cube them up first and cook them over high heat in cast iron w/a little bit of oil, remove them from pan, and procees w/onions (and a few T. of minced garlic). Make roux in separate pan and add to cast iron, add equal amts. broth and half & half. Add ground coriander in addition to other spices. Use leftover cream to add to sour cream,chopped cilantro and scallions for nice sauce to dollop on top. Above all, go the extra effort and cook the dried beans (instead of canned) - I like the Goya brand for Small White Beans. I also thin out the chile w/a little bit of the bean broth if it all seems too thick. All in all, a very tasty dish. Good with a big can of PBR.

Thanks Detroit! I was very interested in this recipe but was also turned off by the stick of butter. I can do a stick of butter in something if it's a dessert, but not chili. I found the McCormick recipe on their web site and made it. Yum! I used about twice the amount of chopped onions, fresh garlic, and lots of it, instead of their suggested powder, and I also increased the quantity on many of the seasonings, especially the chili powder. I was surprised there was no mention of salt in the recipe as it was much needed. I topped with green onions and grated cheddar cheese. I will definitely make the McCormick recipe again and again.

I have not made this version of white chicken chili, but in reading the reviews, for all those looking for the ultimate white chicken chili recipe, the best one is the McCormick one using a spice blend of cumin, oregano, red cayenne, garlic powder and cilantro. Big on taste, a lot lower in fat. There is no way this much fat is needed to make superior white chicken chili. The McCormick one only uses a little olive oil to saute the chicken and onions in. I got it from the coupon section of the Sunday paper, but it may be on their website if they have one. I haven't checked. Serve with a little grated Monterray Jack on top and corn bread and you've got one of the best meals this side of the Rio Grande.

This recipe reminds me of one I found long ago in the SunsetMagazine call Navajo Tacos, served with Indian fry bread. I have looked all over for the recipe but have not been able to find it. It consisted of small white navy beans with water and salt, that you brougt to a boil, boiled for 10 min., covered for one hour, drained, and then cooked with hamburger,onions in chicken broth. Also with different seasonings added. If you have heard of this recipe, please send it on to me. It was time consuming but worth all the work that was put in to it. Like I said, it was called Navajo Tacos served on Indian fry bread. I have tried to find it on the web but am not able to get into the SunsetMagazine Western editon to see if they still have it. Thank you so much.

I also seasoned my chicken with salt and pepper 3 days before (makes it melt in your mouth)and added cumin and chili powder while browning in vegetable oil with the onions. I omitted the chilies since not everyone in my house like them, and added the cheese and sour cream to individual bowls. Excellent!!!!

Probably shouldn't review a recipe that I changed but I also went low fat and thought it was wonderful. I used a can of lowfat cream of chicken with 1 can 2% milk instead of the butter, flour and 1/2 & 1/2 and more broth. Also used a can of pickled jalepenos for one of the chili's.

What a strange recipe! I read all the reviews, so I had to try it. I must say that it was not exactally my favorite recipe. I substantially followed the recipe with lots of extra kick in spices, horseradish (really great addition), and I also simmered the chicken pieces in the broth with lots of traditional broth ingredients. What really was funny was the expressions on my family's face when I served it. My husband commented that it appeared like someting served during the Russian Revolution, my daughter stated it resembled wall-paper paste, but they LOVED it! Served it as stated with salsa, and added warmed flour tortillas on the side. I doubt I will make it again for myself, but my guess is I will be asked to make it again, and again and again.

After all the great reviews, I was a little disappointed with this dish, although my husband described it as a 'winner'. Apart from reversing the quantities of chicken stock & half & half, & cutting down on the cheese & butter a little, I followed the directions exactly. It was still extremely rich & - to my mind - a little too bland. I can't believe that following the recipe's proportions for all that fat (1 whole stick of butter ???) would have made the flavour any more interesting. Just richer. I might make it again because it was very easy & my husband enjoyed it. Perhaps the leftovers will have more kick !

Great recipe. I replaced some of the half-and-half w/ chicken broth as others suggested (reduced by 1/2 C, next time I will do more). It was still very rich (but good). I used extra-hot chili powder and replaced one can of the chilies w/ jalapenos instead to give it more kick. Also, I bought grilled chicken breasts from our grocery store and just cut them up - with that timesaver, this was a pretty quick recipe to throw together. I will definitely make again.

Have made this twice now & got raves both times. I used the northern beans, & switched amounts on broth & cream. Sauteed the chicken in cajun spice. Threw in a can of green chilis, half cup of green salsa & T. of stoneground mustard at the end for extra flavor. Also upped the spice quotient by 2. A great recipe to improvise with!

I made this chili for a Super Bowl party and it was outstanding!! I also changed out some half and half for more chicken broth. Some short cuts: use canned beans, saute the cut up chicken with the onions and mix melted butter and flour together first, then stir in to thicken. At the end, I threw in some frozen corn which really finished it off well!!

This is the best white chicken chili recipe I have ever tried. I have made it several times and usually serve it at casual social gatherings, and always get asked to supply the recipe.

Excellent chili! My guests all loved it. I used 2 cans of Great Northern beans instead of dried. I used 5 tbs. of canola oil instead of the butter (3 tbs. to saute the chicken, 2 to saute the onions, garlic, spices). Other changes: added 4 cloves minced garlic, increased to 4 cups of chix broth, 1/4 cup whipping cream instead of half-and-half, 2 tbs. cornstarch mixed with the cooked chicken instead of the roux, increased to 1 tbs. of cumin. Let simmer for about 60 min instead. Great for a cold winter evening!

i (like others) boiled an entire chicken and used the meat and broth for the chili -- i doubled the recipe-- i thought the shredded chicken was good for the soup. i cut back the fat by using evaporated milk instead of half-n-half, leaving the monterey jack on the side and using more broth than "cream". i really thought it was pretty rich the way i prepared it, so i could not imagine how rich and gooey it would be if i prepared it the way it was intended. i'll save that for a more extranvagant meal (that i am not eating). overall, the reviews were fabulous. i would make it spicier next time. definitely put the sour cream in at the end -- i think that is worth it.

Down in Texas, where the state food is chili, I've made chili with beef and venison. It was my mom who first introduced white chicken chili to me ten years ago. So I thought I'd try some of my own. I think this recipe should only be a template for your own particular tastes and dietary concerns. I wanted the smooth roux but without all the fat from the cream, so I used a little extra flour with skim milk. It kept the stock from becoming too thick. I also added extra cumin and chili powder. Our chili team, "Get Down Chili Team," of Marble Falls, Tx never place, but we always get down.

I found this recipe in a Gourmet Magazine over 4 years ago when I was waiting for my husband in the dr's office. I made it several times, and then lost the recipe! I was elated to find it on this website and will make it tomorrw!!! The only thing I changed in the recipe was I used a whole chicken, cut up, skinned and boned and used the stock I cooked the chiken in for the broth. I also have substited canned Nortern beans instead of dried, but have used both! Bon appetit!

I followed the previous reviewer's suggestions for garlic, omiting roux and using 1 can of evaporated milk, but used 1 and 1/2 lbs. of ground chicken and increased the chicken broth to 4 cups. I ended up doubling the dried spices and adding 1 tsp.cornstarch dissolved in 1/2 cup of 1% milk. It didn't curdle. I also omitted the cheese and served the sr. cream on the side. My family loved it

I followed the advice of another reviewer and tried a reduced fat version. WONDERFUL! I have been looking for the perfect white chicken chili recipe and this is it. I used two cans of Northern beans instead of fresh. I added three cloves of pressed garlic to my onion saute. I skipped the roux and just added flour to the onion mixture. I swithched the chicken broth and milk proportions and used evaporated skim milk (1 large can) instead of half & half. I took the meat from a whole roasted chicken(Tyson). I used fat free sour cream. I did NOT use a lowfat cheese. This was absolutley wonderful and very easy. Will definitely make again. My husband said it is the best he has ever had.

This is one of the best chili recipes I've ever encountered. I followed the advice of switching the measurements for the broth and half & half and was plesantly suprised. I also used canned white navy beans and it was delish. Saved the sour cream on the side and served w/ warm flour tortillas.....heaven!

Have been making this recipe for my catering business for 2 years now, and it is excellent. I also just started using grilled chicken and the flavor is even better.

For simplicity, I used canned northern beans, but jazzed it up a bit with GRILLED chicken - AWESOME!

Fantastic, what a great alternative to "regular" chili. I omitted the tabasco (because of our toddler) and it was perfect...This will become a regular in our house. A great presentation with a green salad and loaf of bread! Excellent!

This is the 2nd time I've made this chili. Both times excellent, but both times made some changes. I thought it tasted a bit bland as another reviewer mentioned. So, out came some dijon mustard, horseradish sauce, and worstereshire. Very nice!!

This is delicious and not as complicated as it first appears. I reversed the quantities of chicken broth and half-and-half, and it was still rich and tasty. I will definitely make it again. I am going to try white kidney beans next time.

Very Good. I would definitely make it again. I like my chili mild and this suited my tastes perfectly. I used dry northern beans instead of navy and it came out great.

I was a little bit in-dubio about this recipe, but after reading the ratings decided to try it. When I looked at the ingredients, I couldn't imagine what it would be like - but I certainly wasn't disappointed! I used 1 cup biogarde yogurt and 1 cup goats milk instead of the half-and-half, and it was AWESOME! My boyfriend and I gobbled it up in no time flat and give it 4 thumbs up!

Definitely will make this again! It was very good and filling, did not need anything but some bread and maybe a small salad with it....Next time I think I will put more chicken broth and less cream in just to make it a little less thick adn heavy.....Great and easy!

This recipe has become a standard at our house! It isn't necessarily a cold weather dish. I leave the cream out altogether and add more broth and about 1/2 cup of good white wine. Did you know you can boil the dried beans in about a quart of water for 30 minutes and you don't have to soak them over night. Let them sit in the water for about an hour after boiling, and they're ready for use.

I only used about 1/2 cup half&half; for the rest of the liquid I used more chicken broth. Added about 2 tbsp hot sauce for more kick. This will become a new family favorite!

You normally wouldn't use the words "rich and luscious" to describe chili, but this recipe was just that. All the flavors blended very nicely with each other. I added minced garlic while sauteing the onions and used whole milk instead of the half and half. Even with the substitution it was still very creamy. I retained some of the cheese to use as a topping along with the cilantro and finely diced red pepper. A welcome change to the usual red chili.

After reading the other reviews, I was tempted to use canned beans so I could have the canned liquid for the roux, but I ended up using dried beans (easy, just plan ahead) and whole milk. Still very rich (and I completely omitted the sour cream). Next time I will use 2%. The only criticism from me (and the folks at work - this was my contribution to a chili party) was that it lacked "kick". We all added several drops of hot sauce - a big help. People were surprised at how much they liked it.

Great chicken chili. I agree with the other reviewers, the half and half was good, but combined with the butter made the dish VERY rich. Big hit at Super Bowl half-time, especially with non-red meat eaters.

I used 2 cans of Northern beans instead of dried, and therefore used the liquid from the 2 cans of beans and only 1 cup half&half cream. Was very creamy and very filling. Served it with corn bread.

Rich, but well worth it. I like to use fresh rather than canned chilies, so I cooked a couple of chopped mild green chilies along with the onion. I also added four or five garlic cloves. I'll definitely add this to my permanent repertoire.

I made this for a pitch-in at work and it received rave reviews. Several people requested the recipe and are among the many who have made this dish over and over again. It is definitely a favorite!

This chili is really good, but a little heavy for my taste - and waistline! I substituted one can of Cream of Chicken soup and 1 can of 2% milk for the roux and half and half. It was delicious and I would definitely make it again.

Both my boyfriend and I LOVED this dish. I added garlic and substituted one can of jalapenos for one of the cans of mild chiles, as we both like things with a little more heat. I liked it very much with the 1/2 & 1/2, but I will try the other cook's suggestion of using the bean juice next time. Also, I cooked the chicken breasts in low salt chicken broth, so I suppose I could use that too.

This was fabulous chili ... different and very, very delicious. I doubled the amount of chili powder, cumin and canned green chilies; halved the Tabasco; and also followed Reviewer Jim's suggestion and used the bean cooking liquid (reduced to 2 cups) in place of the half & half. Instead of adding the cheese and sour cream to the whole pot of chili, I served it on the side (my boyfriend's not a big dairy lover). Since I like it milder and he likes it pretty spicy, I put the hot sauce on the table and we could "doctor" it up the way we each like it. Leftovers heated up great, too. I'm going to be making this often!

Excellent. Will make over and over. I used pickled jalepenos to add spice.

This recipe made a delicious chili which will be an excellent variation to making soup with leftover chicken. Instead of using the roux I did not discard the beans cooking water and used this. It was great. Jim

I lightened the recipe up by using evaporated skimmed milk in place of half and half, plain non-fat yogurt for the sour cream, and 2% fat Monterey Jack cheese. Also used the suggestion from another reviewer to use jalapenos to replace green chilis. Everyone who tasted it gave this chili RAVE reviews!

I prepared this recipe for my husband. He loved it! We prefer food a bit spicier, so I substituted one can of chilies for a can of jalepenos, increased the cumin to 2 tsp., and used canned great northern beans instead of navy beans. It was delicious. It has been requested again and again. Thanks!

I like food really spicy, so I added red and green pepper sauces to taste, a little more chili powder & cumin than called for and I sauteed the onions with chopped garlic. It was great!!

I made some minor changes to use supplies on hand- like 1/8 tsp. cayenne pepper, instead of tabasco and canned northern beans, instead of dried navy beans. The recipe was still wonderful! I've had several requests to make it again. Thanks!!
