We found this to be ho-hum. I didn't think the meatballs were interesting or tasty and the broth was lacking something. I had high expectations, given the reviews, but won't be making it again.

Actually not a review, but does anyone know what I could substitute for the sausage?? Many thanks in advance -

For a healthier version. I used a combination of ground turkey breast and thigh meat along with spicy Mexican sausage. Brown rice, organic low sodium chicken broth, an entire jar of salsa, some chipotle chile in adobe cause (to taste depending on amount of heat you want), and remaining ingredients about the same as recipe. Yummy! Rave comments from guests.

this recipe is a great. Easy to make, low cost, delicious, and nutritious! I used habanero bulk sausage, and up the proportion a bit. It gave it a nice kick wihtout overpowering. I also added a large zucchini, which created great texture. Added cumin and Mexican oregano to the soup (about a teaspoon ea). othewise, per recipe. It made a lot!

this soup was delicious! the only change i made was to substitute chopped meat for the pork sausage. my 10 year old loved it! i also served it with chips to crumble up and put in the soup and made some quesadillas on the side.

Amazing recipe!! Loved it....great flavors and the meatballs were excellent! I followed the recipe with a couple of exceptions (1) I added thinly sliced carrots and baby white potatoes. (2) I did not add milk to the meatballs. I wanted a firmer meatball and wanted to make certain they did not break apart while cooking. Outstanding soup...a keeper!!

Loved this soup - and loved it even more the next day as leftovers. I made two changes: I didn't have rice on hand, so I ended up using orzo, and added Penzy's Adobo Seasoning (plus the cumin), but other than that, followed the recipe to the letter. The depth of flavor makes this soup really delicious.

Very very good soup, would definitely make again. Was sort of on the fence about the beef broth with the tomato flavors, but when it all cooks down the blend is amazing. The meatballs are so tender, and it was very easy to make. Can't wait for the leftovers!

My husband and I love this soup. I have made it several times. We find it has plenty of great flavor and I make almost as recipe says, but for a touch of beef bouillon to season the canned stock and more salt in meatballs. I also make my rice in a separate pan with some of the soup broth and add to each bowl at time of eating. I always think the rice, or pasta in some recipes, soaks up to much of the broth if there are left overs, which I hate. So, I cook it with some soup if that's how it's suggested, only in different pan. I just made this for my mother-in-laws belated birthday with roasted poblano monterey jack quesadillas, fresh guacamole, salsa and chips and a salad. It was a hit! Oh, the Coffee-Chocolate Cake with Mocha Mascarpone Frosting, on this site, was a terrific ending! It's the BEST chocolate cake (I used regular cream cheese because I had it, still delicious. I have made it with both.)

I love to cook and my husband loves to eat. We both love good food and perhaps as little as once or twice a year there is something he will not care for. This soup is one of them, I thought the meatballs were good, but the soup was seriously lacking. I followed the recipe to a T. I do not believe in rating recipes if I don't follow exactly, it's not fair. But this I did follow and we weren't wild about it. I wouldn't make it again for sure.

I've made this soup for 8 years now. I like to either broil the meatballs for about 4 minutes , or saute them before adding to broth. I mistakenly used ground pork several times, but I think it's just as good that way as with the (more fatty) sausage. Freezes well .

This is a winner recipe, I have made it many times over the years. Instead of bulk pork sausage, I but the combo package that they sell in the supermarket with ground beef and ground pork. Don't skip the cilantro, its an essential ingredient. This is also a quick one to make, and it reheats nicely. Its great for leftovers!

This is probably the best albondigas soup recipe I have ever had. I have made it several times including following the exact recipe. My favorite variation is to replace the canned diced tomatoes with a 28 ounce can of regular Rotel tomatoes, and replace the yellow corn meal with corn masa (Masa Harina) The corn masa really gives the albondigas a nice south of the border flavor.

Great, Great Recipee. The only changes I made was to use Hot Salsa and double the amount of garlic. Now keep in mind I am an Italian making a Mexican soup so, of course, I will double the garlic. LOL! The meatballs were tender, the rice cooked up beautifully, it was wonderful. Make it and enjoy!

Please don't read this review if gallows humor upsets you. I made this recipe as directed except for partially baking the meatballs before adding them to the soup, to reduce the fat. My husband came home and told me that he had just been diagnosed with testicular cancer. We had a long talk, came up with a good start on a plan of action and had a lovely cuddle in front of the fireplace. Then I served the soup. I kid you not, for the rest of the evening most of our chatter was about how good the soup was: comforting, delicious, and hearty! We made lots of bad jokes about good meatballs and bad meatballs. I can laugh about it now as his treatment is going really well. We have this soup about once a week now, along with a fire and a cuddle, and talk about gratitude and happiness and eat and eat and eat!

I've made this soup three times and it's always delicious. I make it with ground turkey and chicken stock instead of beef but I don't think that takes anything away from the dish. I like to add some red pepper flakes and tabasco or chili powder for a little kick. So good!

Rating: 4
I think the diced onions in the broth was a waste of time, but everything else was great. You culd even throw in some lime wedges for a Carribean flair, I think I will try that the next time. The meatball recipe was outstanding. This was really something different, a delicious change of pace!

As the Ms.Jill stated, the more condiments on the side, the better. I did experiment with using Mexican-Chili-Powder mixed with seasoned bread-crumbs,and "Baked" the meatballs(yes,I DID use JD Hot-Sausage) and I made spanish rice, quite a bit for anyone who wanted to add more rice to the Feast.AND ,Yes,I did use hot El-Pinto chunky salsa when I made the sides of instant rice . Oh , So Good here in Albuquerque,N.M.

This was very quick and easy. I used only ground turkey (didn't have sausage on hand), and added one finely chopped Chipotle pepper to the soup. Frankly, it needed it as it was a bit too bland for us without. As for the meatballs, instead of the ground cornmeal, I threw in two leftover pieces of cornbread sitting on kitchen counter. Also - I ALWAYS grate my onions for any meatballs or meatloaf. It comes out much more delicate without that crunchy onion flavor assault you get with chunks. Not much else different. It was great with fresh Queso Fresco crumbled on top. Kids and hubby all loved it.

This was tasty. Wife loved it, kids were mixed but they ate it. The only modification I made was adding tostada crumbs I blended up in the food processor instead of the cornmeal. It gave the meatballs a good flavor- something out of the ordinary. 3.3 forks.

I've made this several times and have found that it's better when you make the rice on the side, and then put a healthy spoonful of rice in each bowl and top it with the soup. Otherwise the rice tends to disintegrate by the time the meatballs are done. Also, with the rice you lose the clarity of the broth. As others have said, ground chicken or turkey, turkey sausage, chicken broth, and skim milk work fine.

This was an excellent, rich soup. As some other reviewers have noted, I used ground chicken instead of the beef/pork combo and chicken broth. The meatballs were tender and delicious and the broth was thick and rich. I will definitely be making this one again. The only suggestion I have is to make sure to chop the portion of onions that go into the meatballs very finely. Mine were a little coarse and it made the meatballs a little harder to construct.

So... I know that since I modified the recipe (some) people get all mad and don't believe my forks count... but I just want to let people know that you can still make this recipe if you are short on ingredients. I thought I had them all, but when I was looking through my pantry I realized I only had one 14 oz can of diced tomatoes (used a TBS of tomato bouillon to substitute my lack), had absolutely no onions at all, was all out of cumin (where did it all go?), and to top it all of did not have any cornmeal. Why bother? Well, I read all of the reviews and went for it anyway. Used homemade chicken broth and minced garlic, used a reviewers suggestion to add the rice into the meatballs (and used a cup instead of a half with no complaints), and saved the salsa for a garnish to suit everyone's taste. Made bitesize meatballs (fun, cute and practical), and served with some tortilla chips on top. My 6 year old had THIRDS, and my other two gobbled theirs up as well. My husband commented many times on it's flavor, and our guest thought it was delicious. Must have been the garlic and cilantro, since there weren't many other ingredients!! Somehow, this soup really hits the spot and I highly recommend you try it; even if you don't have all of the ingredients! :)

We really enjoyed this soup! As other reviewers suggested, I used turkey instead of beef (both gound turkey and spicy turkey sausage). One thing I will definitely do next time is cook the rice separately and add to each bowl of soup. I cooked it in the soup, as the recipe states, and the next day the rice was rather mushy and made the leftovers just "OK". I also added a can of black beans to the soup. I will make this again for sure.

Rating: 4
Outstanding and easy too - since I prefer chicken, I used ground chicken for meatballs, (browning them first, since chicken is a looser ground meat and could fall apart in the pot), along with chicken chorizo from Trader Joe's, and chicken broth, and instead of cooking rice in the soup, I bake up a big crock of the Baked Mexican Rice from this site, perfect for large pot lucks, etc., everyone loves it, even friends who don't like 'mexican' or 'spicy' gavone it all up - it's a real keeper for me!

I have made this ever year for our New Years Party before we head over to view the Rose Bowl Floats-DELICIOUS! Make sure you use a good quality salsa, it makes all the difference.

My husband says that this soup was "restaurant quality". I disagree. It is so much better than most Albondigas served in Mexican restaurants. I followed the recipe exactly and the result was a very authentic- tasting, rich but not too thick soup with very delicious meatballs. It is worth making the meat ball recipe and not substituting frozen ones. It was really not difficult or time consuming. I guarantee that this soup will become a staple for our household.

This was very good. I had to improvise a bit:the only sausage I had on hand was Italian (worked fine) and I had no bottled salsa because we always make our own, so I just added some chopped canned chipotle. Yyum. Also, just a tip, if you like your soup to have lots of broth, as I do, Pre-cook your rice and then add a small scoop to each bowl as you serv. That way the rice doesn't soak up all of the delicious broth. Now, on to find a recipe for tonight!

I made this yesterday at a friend's house and we LOVED it. I did make one slight alternation in the recipe: I used a less fat sauasge. I'm sure it cut down on the amount of grease in the recipe.

Okay...wow! Did the four cans of broth as opposed to 5. Cilantro had gone off so I skipped that. Probably did 3/4 cup salsa. And was heavy handed with the garlic. Then taking the advice of previous reviews I doubled the amount of spice and egg for 2 1/2lbs meat, using 1 lb of hot bulk sausage (Jimmy Dean breakfast) in meatballs. I hate that I changed it this much, but the results are nothing to toy with! Without a doubt it is better the next day, if only you had enough leftover to have another meal.

Delicious soup, even though I did dink a bit with the recipe. Used L/O pre-made meatballs from a different recipe. Subbed canned Mexican Style sliced stewed tomatoes for the regular, and added a bit of crushed red pepper. When it was time to heat up my already cooked meatballs, I added a coarsely chopped Mexican squash. At the very end, I added some fresh spinach. An EXCELLENT soup!!! Next time it will be even better because I will make the required meatballs--but I will oven-bake them (to get rid of extra grease) before adding them to the soup. Do try this. And, zucchini (or Mexican squash) is very good in this. Unless you use a lot of spinach, it gets lost.

Also I decreased the broth, and put 3-4 cups of the broth when it was all mixed (minus the rice) into a food processor to give it some thickness. It turned out great!

I've been making this soup since it appreared in Bon Appetit in 2000. I've given out the recipe many times. I'm glad it will be cold for the next few days because I'm making it again for dinner. My family loves it. I've also served it at Christmas gathering with rave reviews. I recommend making the meatballs small and bite size.

This was REALLY GOOD and super easy the way that I made it. I used pre-cooked regular meatballs that I had in the freezer, so putting together the soup only took the time necessary to chop the onion and mince the garlic--no more than 5 minutes. Next time, however, I will make the Mexican meatballs, and I'll bet it will be even better. Used no-salt added canned tomatoes and low sodium beef broth to make it a bit healthier. DO TRY THIS!!!

This was really delicious. I am not a big proponent of messing with recipes, but in this case I used all pork for the meatballs and I added precooked brown rice at the very end instead of using white. Wow! I will be turning to this one time and again, especially when winter comes around.

We really enjoyed this, it was yummy on a rainy day. Here is my version: I browned the meatballs first, then removed them and drained most of fat, then cooked the onion and added a little diced carrot, then used low-salt natural chicken broth (with the other ingredients). I also cooked the rice seperate. This is a definately a great recipe to work with and add personal touches to - either in the meatballs or the broth or both.

I took a chance when deciding to make this (I'm really new to adventurous cooking and I was wary of the amount of cilantro) but it was SPLENDID. I recommend this for anyone who is a soup lover for the easy preparation, the full flavor, and for the fact that you can freeze very easily for a delightful re-heat. Don't be afraid of the cilantro -- it makes the soup. And, the soup doesn't wind up anywhere near as heavy as it sounds like it will be -- it's quite light and filling.

Ok lets, get real, I am Hispanic, and NEVER in my entire life have I ever encountered salsa in Albondigas. And yes I have had several variations, some Mexican moms like to add rice to the meatball itself, but always, vegetables are kept to a minimum, the whole emphasis is the rice and meatball, everything else is very secondary. Also, just try finding bulk pork sausage in a mexican Grocery store, its not exactly a best seller, and its not often used for Albondigas. And as for putting salsa in your Albondigas, well, that would be the equivalent of putting cheese dip or spinach dip into your soup. Also, "heat" has nothing to do with Albondigas, we make this dish for our babies to eat when they are ill, its comfort food. Chorizo is generally a breakfast item, however, its also used as a stuffing and side dish as well. Again, none of the many Mexican moms I know have ever used it to make Albondigas. Perhaps this recipe was introduced by someone hoping to "update" or put a spin on the original, but some things are better left unchanged. I hope this is helpful for those of you looking to make authentic Albondigas.

This was very good. I added more salsa & would recommend also making the meatballs bite-sized b/c they are a little "flat" in flavor - they need the flavor of the soup with them.

The soup was excellent. I added more rice to make it heartier. The other thing I did was sautee all of the onions and garlic together and then divided into the broth and then the meat mixture. I think it made the meetballs tastier. The next day the soup is thicker and more like a stew and that is great, it is like another dish!

Very good, the broth is very similar to another soup I often make, but the meatballs and rice are something different for a change. The kids were so excited to eat, but it was too hot for them to eat right away. I threw in some frozen corn kernals to help cool down the soup while adding veggies to their meal. They gobbled up so much, they had to wait and digest before they could eat the caramel apples I had made for dessert. :) Thanks for a great recipe, we will be making it again.

Thanks to hurricane Katrina and all of her rain, I was in the mood for some soup. I have never made this before and it was terrific. I'm sure it's going to be even better for left overs.

Next time I will add more spices to the meatballs and the broth.

Albondigas soup is one of our favorite comfort foods. This recipe is excellent, but we did some minor changes. I have never had this soup with tomatoes and salsa, so we tried it with and found we prefer it without, simply because that is familiar to us. We did add mexican oregano and mexican chili powder in additon to the called for cumin both to the soup and the meatballs, and left out the bay leaves. And because the meatballs are cooked in the soup a lean ground beef is best to avoid an oil slick. Wonderful!

I use a very spicy flavorful salsa, and on occasion I add potatoes.

This was a fantastic soup. I used chorizo rather than the bulk sausage and it gave the meatballs something extra. Guests raved.

YUM!!! I made this dish because I had leftover Spanish rice. I also just added the rice to each bowl and then ladled the soup over it. This might help people who said the rice soaked up all the broth or became soggy. I used sweet Italian sausage instead of making my own meatballs to save time. They were very flavorful and delicious, although I'm sure not terribly authentic. I also added potatoes and a dab of sour cream at the end for fun. I plan on making this regularly. It's a great mid-week meal.

I liked this recipe with a few changes, I form the meatballs, but then bake them on a cookie sheet at 350 for about half an hour. They get nicely browned and quite a bit of fat renders out. Then I add them to the broth etc. I also don't usually have corn meal on hand so substitute an equal amount of bread crumbs.

The flavor is great. I took the tip on the recipe and added my favorite chipotle hot sauce, even better. Not a very pretty dish though. The meatballs are boiled in the broth and they look it, kind of grey. But they are wonderfully tender. I took the advise of other reviewers and added a whole cup of rice, which was fine the same night but then sucked up all the soup overnight. Upon making this again I will try the other suggestion on this site and add cooked rice to the soup right before serving. It's a good use of ground beef but I don't think I would make it for company.

This recipe is missing a lot. Real Albondigas have chopped mint in them. THAT'S what people are saying is missing. I would add about 3 tb of finely chopped mint to the recipe. Also, beef broth isn't generally used. I add none. I use 3 cans of hiqh quality canned tomatoes as the basis for the broth, with onion, garlic, a pinch of cumin, and cilantro blended in. I also fry the tomato mixture in a little oil to bring out the flavor for about 10 minutes, then add a bay leaf. I thin it with a little water if it's too thick, but when adding the tomato juice from the cans, you generally don't need it. If you use fresh tomatoes, be sure they're SUPER ripe. The meatballs will add the meaty taste to the broth. Also, the meatballs are never browned, as one person mentioned she did. The addition of rice is generally made at the time of serving or the rice is put in the meatballs, but not just tossed into the broth.

I prefer mine a little thicker, so I only used 3 cans of broth, and added more rice. I think Pace chipotle salsa works well with this. Also, I used turkey last time instead of beef (1 gr. fat) and thought the result was just as good. I make this with the "easy corn bread" recipe on this site, makes a good, pretty quick meal.

I used a lot of the suggestions from the reviews. I used beef base instead of the canned broth. Added a can of Rotel tomatoes and a can of corn. When making meatballs (or meatloaf), I always cook a bit in the microwave to taste for seasoning. This definitely needed something so I added some chorizo and about a tablespoon of chipotle Tabasco. Much better. I forgot to add the cornmeal, but luckily the meatballs stayed together. Personally I don't think this is a quick soup. Unless you want to bring out the food processor, it takes a while to chop all those onions, clean and chop the cilantro and form the meatballs. The soup is so good it is worth the time though.

I must admit to feeling a little sceptical about the "homemade" nature of this soup as I poured 5 cans of beef broth, 1 can of tomatoes and some jarred salsa into a soup pot. But the final product was a happy surprise. My picky kids ate the meatballs alone and the rest of us enjoyed them with the soup. It was even better reheated the next day!

I made this recipe for friends and family for a small party. It was a huge success. I did alter the recipe a little and added 2 cups of black beans.

This was good. My family loved it. It was better to not double the rice as suggested, but instead to thicken it, I added some black beans and corn. The meatballs were everyone's favorite part.

Great soup, I used a large can of rotel tomatoes, celery, carrots and 1 tablespoon each of dried thyme and basil to the soup broth. I added the chopped cilantro to the meatballs. My family really enjoyed the spicy flavors and it was very good served with green chili corn bread.

Terrific meal! Each time I make this, I completely impress my friends & family! Simple and very tastey! I serve this with cornbread. Also great for my lactose intolerant friends!

Wonderful comfort food. The only changes I made was to make the meatballs smaller (bite size), used tomatoes with jalepenos and added a handful more rice. Served with cheese quesidillas (sp?). Will definately make again.

This is magnificent cool-weather food! The flavour is so robust and method very easy. I "kicked it up a notch" with more garlic, the whole jar of salsa as a previous cook had mentioned, and doubled the rice as my hubby likes thicker soups. This will be eaten regularly at my house -had leftovers for lunch today and it was even better than last evening (if possible)

I've made this soup several times, certainly a keeper. Next time I'll try the suggestion of using Chorizo in the meatballs. Just want to mention this: my hubby made this the other night and didn't read the recipe closely. He mistakenly added a whole jar of hot salsa instead of the 1/2 cup called for! He took a huge pot of it with him to work the next day and all of "the guys" begged him for the recipe! So don't be afraid to "kick it up a notch"!!! Just make sure you have a lot of cold Corona on hand! . . .of course you'll have to skip the beer part if you're taking it into work!

This is not a BAD recipe, and I have a feeling that it's only a few ingredients away from being fabulous. If I'm going to eat a dish, it has to be GOOD not just OKAY, or what's the point of eating? This was fine, but not fabulous. My fiance loved it, but to me it was missing something, something critical. Keep in mind that I'm a tish-bit biased, having lived throughout Latin America. It's worth a go but be ready to get a tad creative.

This soup was wonderful! I did dish it up a bit by adding more cilantro and threw some cumin and oregano into the stock. I made the rice seprately and put some in a bowl and ladled the soup on top. I prefer the rice to be fresh when its time for left overs. Its on my keeper list!

I made this soup for the first time last night a and served it to company. It was very good, and I wanted to make a couple of suggestions. I thought the flavor of the salsa was lost in the mix, so it may be more interesting to add fresh salsa as a garnish in the middle of the bowl when served, along with the squeezed lime juice. Another option or addition would be to squirt sour cream around the salsa with a ketchup squirt bottle for a pretty look.

I LOVED THIS SOUP AS DID MY HUSBAND. I USED A CAN OF ROTEL TOMATOES IN ADDITION TO THE REGULAR TOMATOES AND IT GAVE IT A BIT OF A KICK. I LOVED THE RICE AND THE CORN IN IT BUT DID NOT TRY THE LIME JUICE AND IT WAS AWESOME EVEN WITHOUT. I SERVED IT WITH MEXICAN CORNBREAD AND IT WAS A GREAT HIT.

Deeeelishis!!! I used chorizo sausage, and added some green beans for some color, and cut back on the rice a little. Also browned the meatballs first to cut back on the fat. Perfect soup for cold winter's day. Next time may add some chipotle peppers

We made this last night and it was really good. I'm cutting down on red meat so we used ground turkey and turkey sausage for the meatballs. They were delicious. Next time I will add more rice to the broth and throw in some corn. Easy and good - my kind of recipe.

This was a delicious dinner! I took the advice and added a can of corn and some rice to the broth and it was excellent. The meatballs held together better than any other I've made. Great soup with a kick!

Being a newly diagnosed diabetic, type 2, I was looking for good food low in carbs. This is a a keeper! I omitted the rice (very high in carbs) and added italian green beans (frozen are ok), everything else the same. You could exchange the green beans for zuchinni or ? Everyone loved it, especially the meatballs. I make a big batch on the weekend and have for a couple of lunches during the week and maybe a dinner. I serve quesadilla's with it. Excellent!

I tried an earlier cook's suggestion and squeezed lime into the broth in the bowls, and it was delicious. Also, a can of corn added chewiness to the broth. My husband loved it (as did I), so I'll be making it again. Next time, I might make the meatballs smaller - bite sized.

Tasty soup. I used 1/2 spicy Italian sausage and 1/2 plain pork sausage with the beef and I threw in a minced garlic head or two as well. The meatballs were flavorful and spicy. The soup was thick, flavorful and more or less easy to make. Everyone loved it.

Wow! I'm living in England and missing Los Angeles Mexican food. On cold rainy day I tried this recipe to warm me up and it did. I didn't have the salsa in so I substituted a couple of dashes of tabasco and squeeze of lime in each bowl as they do at my favourite Mexican restaurant. Brilliant!!!

This soup is really satisfying--especially with some grated cheese on top and corn sticks on the side. Next time I may throw in some corn and take the suggestion to add chorizo to the mix. I like to make a double batch of meatballs and freeze half for when my laziness acts up.

I loved this soup. I used a beef base 3 tbsp with 9 c of water instead of the canned beef broth. I also used tomatoes from my garden. Short grain rice. I will definately make this again. I served hot sauce on the side with the hot sauce added perfect zip.

This soup was great. I don't even like soup and I thought it was delicious. The whole family liked it. My son liked it so much he made a double batch and took it to work where it was a huge hit. One of his hispanic co-workers asked him for the recipe. Now that's a compliment.

Well.......I took into account everything everyone else said, and made the soup. Not only did I put rice in it, I also put corn and one can black beans. I did like this soup a lot, but would do a couple of things differently. I thought the meatballs were pretty flavorless, and think next time I might add some chorizo to the hamburger mix. Also, I agree with the people who say it might be better with homemade stock. Somehow the canned broth leaves a teensy bit of aftertaste (IMHO)...so will do the stock myself next time. I also used the chipotle salsa......nice smoky flavor and not too spicy. Nice soup. Very filling.

I have to say that I think that this recipe is terrific! It is the kind of soup that you are completely satisfied with after eating. It is very rich and flavorful-and not overly spicy for those who like a milder spice. I am going to try to rework the recipe to make it a little lower fat though. I think that the suggestion to add corn is a great one, and I will definately give that a try.

I had leftover homemade pureed root vegetable soup and used that for 1 and 1/2 cans of beef broth. I also used 1/3 pound of hot pork sausage instead of regular sausage, in the meatballs. Otherwise, I followed the recipe and the soup was a big hit here served with tortilla chips.

I have already made this soup twice and it is great. Took it to a potluck and now everyone wants the recipe. The only thing I changed was to use homemade beef broth instead of that canned stuff with all the chemicals. Another reviewer thought it bland, but I thought it was fine, perhaps the type of salsa used makes a difference. I served it with homemade tortillas and sour cream.

While this recipe wasn't bad, it just felt like it was missing something. More spice perhaps?
