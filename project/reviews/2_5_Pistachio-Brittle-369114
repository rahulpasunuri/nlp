After reading all the negative reviews for this recipe, I was really nervous to try it. But my dad loves pistachios, so I was determined to make it for him as a gift. I'm happy to say that this came out perfectly! Since brittle is candy, I used my candy thermometer while I made this to make sure the sugar mixture got hot enough(hard crack stage: around 295f), so it would set right. Once you take this off the heat, it does set up fast, so I stirred in everything but the baking soda right before I took it off. Then I removed it from the heat, added the baking soda, and poured it into the pan. This is so tasty, and I know my dad is going to love it!

I tried it twice - changed the corn syrup on the second - and both times it was a mushy mess. I was really excited about this recipe, but recommend not taking the time or wasting the pistaccios on this one.

We've made this recipe twice and it came out great! Brittle can be tricky and I've had issues with it not hardening. But so far this one has worked great and came out really delicious. I think that moisture in the air can really effect this kind of candy.

What a joke! I followed the recipe to the letter and two days later am still waiting for this to harden. What a waste of good pistachios...was really looking forward to this, too!

I could not find unsalted dry roasted pistachios so I substituted with salted ones and reduced the salt in the recipe to 1/4 tsp. The results were still a bit too salty, although I kind of enjoy the salty/sweet combo. The caramel sets up very quickly which makes it hard to spread once the nuts are mixed in. I would suggest spreading the nuts on the baking sheet and pouring the caramel over the nuts. Caution! The brittle is very sharp! I cut my finger while breaking it up into pieces. My finished product did not look at lovely as the picture, but it tasted pretty good.
