The texture of this souffle was a bit odd and even though it rose as it should, it was "heavy" on the tongue. This will not be a recipe I save for use in the future.

Great holiday dessert! I also made a creme anglaise along with the bittersweet chocolate sauce and thought the combination was perfect. Check your souffle often, as mine only took about 35 minutes to cook.

This was delicious, festive, beautiful and easy. I served it with an armagnac creme anglaise.
