This recipe rocks. Just follow the directions. Don't do anything funny with it. You can buy airline-sized bottles of Cointreau (2 bottles) and brandy (4 bottles) if you don't have these ingredients laying around. Be sure you have a good knife so you can slice the citrus fruits thinly. My only advice is to be sure you chill the wine, club soda, and juice overnight and then throw into the freezer an hour before serving. And do be stingy with the ice. You don't want to dilute it. The result is wine that has the "tang" removed from it. It is a smooth, refreshing summer drink. One thing: your guests may drink more than planned. This stuff goes down easy. It is a wonderful sangria. I haven't experience with the "real" thing in Spain. So I cannot vouch for the veracity of the recipe, but European travelers were pleased with the result.

Really good sangria. Did not totally follow measurements but used all ingredients and then some...you can add whatever fruit you like. I did add sugar...too tart without it. It was good!

Used Rioja instead of Zinfandel. Excellent!

The best thing I can say about this recipe is that when I served it at a recent summer BBQ my best friend's husband, who is from Spain, complimented me on it...and he is tough to please. Everyone else raved about it too. I won't go into the changes I made to the recipe but recommend adjusting to your own taste. We all have different requirements for sweetness and there' lots of ways to tweak it. But it's going to be my "go-to" recipe for Sangria.

Since I made this for a smaller party, I cut the recipe back, starting with 2 bottles of Sangiovese. I soaked the orange and lemon slices (and apple chunks and grapes) in brandy for 24 hours, and then poured the sangria over the brandied fruit (and ice) when serving. Also, rather than add sugar and club soda - I added some ginger ale. We were a very merry bunch by the end of the evening! This is now a "go to" recipe!

I have been making this recipe for years and always get rave reviews. I substitute Orangina for the club soda and orange juice; have also used Triple Sec instead of Cointreau. Basically any fruit that's in season will work. I marinate fruit in the brandy/liquore for at least one day - if not more, prior to combining with other ingredients. Never add the sugar - it truly doesn't need it. Great recipe to play with!!!

The recipe calls for a red wine -- Zinfandel is a red wine, not to be confused with *white* Zinfandel. If you follow the recipe, it will taste full-bodied and spicy from the tannins in the red wine. If you use white wine, it will taste more like a mimosa and less complex. Agree with recommendations to use Rioja as a substitute; alternatively, you could use a bottle of Malbec and a bottle of Cabernet Franc. I also omit the soda and add a splash of prosecco instead.

FINALLY! I have been searching for years for the perfect sangria recipe - one that tastes just like the sangria from my favorite Spanish restaurant. After many, many failed attempts - this is it! I never realized that the flavor I had been missing was orange juice. So, here is what I did - used two bottles of Gaston Malbec from Mendoza, Argentina ($10 each at Trader Joe's) and then half of everything else (per another reviewer's suggestion). I did not use the club soda as I didn't want to water it down and I used Grand Marnier instead of Cointreau. I also added some cut up apples in there with the sliced oranges. Perfection!

FYI, a few people have mentioned they prefer a red wine to zinfadel. I think they might be mixing up zinfadel and 'white zinfadel'. Zinfadel is a red wine, which is what the recipe suggests.

Rating: 4
This is a fail-safe recipe which encourages substitutions based on seasonal fruit availibility, liquor cabinet contents, etc. We prefer red wine to Zinfadel, Southern Comfort to brandy, and frozen juices for the ice cubes. Just tweak, taste and save some for your guests.

Perfectly delicious! I was only preparing Sangria for 4 people so I eyeballed the ingredients and only used 1 bottle of Zinfandel. I used cut strawberries in addition to peaches for adornment and flavor and let the fruit sit in the concoction for at least 2 hrs. When serving, I put in pitcher and added ICE as requested. It was a hit and I will definitely make it again!

Great base a little flat. I reduced the juice and added more fruit to create a more festive drink. 2 fuji apples cut to bit size chunk, 2 oranges, a little more brandy, Strawberries, lime juice and slices of limes cut to 1/4 's and watermelon in bite size pces. I change the watermelon to other melons to change the flavor. I have fun with this recipe.

This has been my go-to summer-sangria recipe for a long time. I wouldn't make any other. I use one bottle of Zinfandel and then 1/4 the rest of the recipe and it is just delicious. I always get raves and many ask for the recipe. Can't make enough of it when I do.

Rating: 2
Just OK. I made the recipe as directed and found it to lacking. I am used to red wine sangrias that have spices in it and are full bodied. This was very light and not sweet enough. To fix it I added chopped up granny smith and fuji apples along with Fresca. That seemed to help. I will probably make this again but will continue to play with it as a foundation. I found it almost sacreligious to add Fresca. There has to be a better way.

Yum. Added more Cointreau instead of Brandy, because what 20 year old has Brandy in their liquor cabinet? The fruit slices made it so pretty!

I made this last night, on a warm summer evening for a girls night bbq. I didn't want to make a chick drink, rather I wanted something sophisticated and refreshing - this was it! I have been to Spain 4 times in 6 years and have never had a sweet sangria, so I left out the sugar completely. I also used diet tonic water instead of club soda. The recipe calls for 2 gallons of wine - that is equivalent to more than 7.5 liters of wine - which is 10 bottles of wine (ea bottle is 750 ml) - so if you're only using one bottle of wine, cut the recipe by 8 to 10. Don't worry if it isn't strong enough, just add back in more brandy or cointreau as deemed necessary. I bought the cheapest zin I could find ($5.99) and it was perfect. Given all the fruit, brandy, cointreau and juice - a good wine would be a waste of money. Leaving the sugar out was an added bonus for the gals who are watching carbs in the summer diet season. Yes there are still carbs, but not nearly as much. Enjoy!

Had potential but was not quite what I was looking for. I did not find it sweet at all and in fact thought it could be sweeter. I did use regular sugar instead of superfine which might have been why. I did make a simple syrup to dissolve sugar. Would try with cheaper box wine next time.

I made this yesterday for a last-minute Memorial Day cookout with friends. I cut the recipe down three-quarters using one bottle of wine. I prepared it exactly as written. It was fabulous! Thanks to the reviewer who stated that the entire recipe serves nowhere close to 100 people. The quarter recipe was perfect for 8-10 adults.

Sangria is a classic summer staple that is pretty hard to screw up... Instead of a Zin, I used a Shiraz, a fruitier alternative. I also used only a third of the recipe because 100 servings is a lot.

8 lemons give 2 cups. For OJ, I used the more expensive Tropicana Valencia brand which tastes fairly close to fresh (I didn't trouble with using more than the single 54 oz container -- it was close enough to 2 quarts).

This was exceptionally good...we served to our gourmet dinner group and were surprised at how much people drank. My thought was, they'd have one glass and move on to regular wine, but 8 people did a pretty good job of demolishing a gallon! It was perfect for our "Night in Espana". I made half the recipe and used burgundy, omitted the brandy and the club soda. At the advice of other cooks, I used inexpensive wine in a box, and hoped that none of my friends were in the store shopping and saw me buying cheap wine..grin. We'll be making this for parties this summer, to be sure!

I used triple sec (orange liqueur) in place of Cointreau, bourbon in place of brandy, and a mandarin flavored seltzer in place of soda.

Read all the reviews first, & took some suggestions. I used burgundy wine. Just used regular sugar, it worked just fine. I made two batches the day before & they conveniently fit in the 3 gal water containers (didn't put soda in yet). At our party I combined the mixture & mixed w/Sierra Mist. Bought a 3 gal beverage dispenser ($20 linens & things --love it!!) & made some ice in plastic molds out of wine, soda & orange and lemon rings. Put that in with the sangria when I put it out & it kept it nice and cold even though party was outside & temp was 88. Only thing, for a party of about 50- 70 people, we also had a keg of beer... only used one batch of sangria. Next time I would only make one batch at a time. It went over well at the party but was not the HUGE hit that it seemed to be for other reviewers.

Made a half recipe. A bit less lemon juice would have been welcome--required the adding of more superfine sugar for balance. I suggest buying a zesty red (Zin or Merlot) rather than super cheap wine that only appears red. You need the wine to hold its own among the many other flavors.

I lived in Spain and loved the pitchers of Sangria served in the local bars and maison's. This recipe stood up to the best of them. I use peach brandy, cointreau or triple sec and lots of fresh fruit. I don't put it on ice, would rather not dilute it. I also make it a day before and add club soda or sprite or ginger ale just before serving......excellent for summer bbqs!

I grew up in an area of Tampa, FL that has many Latin restaurants..many of which are rated by how good their sangria is..this recipe rivals the best! I doubled the recipe for a party, used red Spanish table wine, added citrus fruit, apples and cinnamon sticks (a local flavor). I made it 48 hrs. before the party as suggested by a reader and the flavor was awesome. A guest at my party who is from Germany and has travelled to Spain many times said that this sangria is as good or better than any she has ever had in Spain. I sent her home with a "to go" jug. This is the sangria recipe that I will continue to use...can't believe it was written before I was even old enough to drink!

As others have said, this is a fabulous recipe. A couple of thoughts: I don't like watered-down drinks (and in NY summers the ice immediately melts, resulting in water floating on top of drinks) so I make ice cubes from whatever juice I'm using. And rather than using lemon juice and sugar (or simple syrup) I use lemonade with a little fresh lemon juice. This is a very forgiving recipe.

Always a hit! I use Hardy's shiraz in the 3 liter box, fresh squeeze oranges and lemons and adjust other ingredients to taste. Definitely add the splash of club soda or whatever soda you are using in the glass right before serving!

I have forgotten to add the brandy before and not missed it. Very refreshing stuff, and easy to guzzle on a hot day/

I made a whole recipe and found there was more than enough for days and days and days. (I'm still not certain how I'm going to drink it all now that the party is over!)

This is the best sangria recipe I've ever made and reminded me of being in Mexico many many years ago!

One more thing -- I don't know on what planet this serves 100. When I make a quarter of the recipe (one wine bottle's worth), it is enough for four friends sitting around eating dinner on a hot summer evening, maybe 10 generous (not 4 oz) servings?

DELICIOUS! The perfect summer party drink! I served it several times last summer, and can't wait for the first warm weekend, to have an excuse to make it again! We used cheap Spanish riojas.

I liked this but have a tip. I followed someone's suggestion and added sparkling white wine. My husband bought Asti Spumante (since it was cheap) but I utterly loathe the taste. I thought it would get masked in the sangria -- but it didn't. It gave it a weird flavor that just made it sickly sweet. I also didn't have Cointreau, and couldn't get it due to being Sunday the day we decided to make it (and they don't sell alcohol in my state on Sundays.) Probably obvious to most people, but I think it's key to add only add only liquids that you or your guests would drink if it wasn't combined with something else. Having said all that, I have made sangria many times and this is a good recipe and I will definitely make it again (sans Asti!) Some of my guests really liked it, although it wasn't the hit I thought it would be, but that's my fault.

Very yummy! I substituted Tirple Sec for the Cointreau as a cost-saving measure, and it worked well. Regarding quantity: I prepared this for a party of 40 people, where there was also hand-crafted beer on tap. I halved this recipe, and still had quite a bit left over, inspite of at least 20 people indulging in this instead of beer. I also added a wider variety of fruit then is listed in the recipe, but would probably leave out the apples and organges in the future and use more sweeter fruits, like peaches, watermelon and strawberries. The apples and oranges seemed a bit tart, and took away from the overall flavor of the sangria in my opinion.

Oh-My-God!! This is delicious and goes down soooo smoothly. We mixed everything in a very clean 4 gallon cooler, now know as "the vat". Used Shiraz and Cabernet , what we had in the house; added the almond extract as suggested previously and used regular brandy and the Cointreau. After mixing everything, added apples, oranges, peaches and lemons. We didn't add the soda but topped off each glass of sangria with Freixenet Brut. Yum! We made half the recipe with great results and now have 2 full 1 gallon thermos containers to enjoy.

This is excellent and I have varied this recipe in many ways. My favorite is using blackberry brandy, which I add with the wine, orange juice and sugar ( which I start with a half cup of sugar), then I let it sit for 24 hours, then I add the fruit and throw in chunks of pineapple with the orange slices. I let that sit for 4 to 5 hours and then add the sugar as needed and sometimes more orange juice. This is the best make ahead drink.

Try making this with a Cava (such as Friexenet) and maybe cut back on the club soda a little. Cava's a white sparkler. Vinho verde also works *really* well and is relatively cheap and high-quality.

!Que Bueno! I made this for a paella party we threw over the weekend. It was a huge hit! I did a tester recipe a couple weeks before the party and discovered that this drink is at it's most flavorful after it has sat for 48 hours. I did not use the sparkling water. I did not put ice directly in the drink for fear of watering it down, so I put it in a large decorative jar and placed jar in large bowl of ice. Used fresh oj (naked juice, strained the pulp out). Used amaretto instead of brandy. Also added frozen mango slices. I tripled this recipe for 90 people and put out small glasses. It was gone within two hours and people wanted more (not that they needed it). Everyone wanted the recipe!

Fantastic! I had to work with what I had in the house, so I made several modifications and it was a smash nonetheless. First off, I mixed white and red wines, then used Grand Marnier instead of Triple Sec, added some cinnamon for flavor, added lots of seasonal fruit, and left out club soda. I can't wait to make this recipe again. And I agree with the comment about servings, I had about 16 people and we drank the whole thing.

I spend a lot of time in Spain and have had many variations of sangria. A couple of hints: use inexpensive, but good (not heavy) red wine....all my Spanish friends insist that it be CHEAP wine (to buy their quality of "cheap", I recommend something in the $8-12 range. And use lemon-lime bubbling soda (or lemon) instead of flavorless sparkling water.

I used this recipie as a starting place. I made a batch of it for a summer birthday party. The first change I made was by making it a white wine sangria, using an inexpensive Viongier. I also used Triple Sec. As for the fruit, I added in what was in season, so I used mango, white nectarines, pear, grapefruit, honey tangerine and peaches. It was really a big hit.

To the cook in Toronto - half a gallon of wine would be 2 - regular bottles of red wine. A qt is 4 cups or 32 oz. I'm not sure of tha way to calculate that into metric.

I would like to half this recipe so for those of us living in the metric world, how much is a quart? A gallon?

As others have stated, I used no club soda, no brandy and Burgundy in place of Zinfandel (I think a peppery Zin would just be too much for this). It was fabulous. Watch the servings - I had 8 people at a party and we drank over half of it.

Makes a huge quantity but keeps well. Refreshing but not too sweet...would upgrade the wine next time.

I served this at a dinner party and everyone loved it. I used Burgundy as well, and triple sec b/c I had it on hand. I also added strawberries, apples, and peaches. Don't leave out the club soda - it has a nice effect when added at the end.

I added fresh mangos and apples. Very pretty drink.

Excellent! Everyone loved it. Best to make it a day or two before. I added two cans crushed pinapple and two cans sweet black cherries(juice and all). WOW!

This recipe scales easily. I didn't have cointreau but I did have Lemoncello. cha-ching!

I really enjoyed this recipe, however I took some tips from other users before preparing it. I left out the Brandy and Cointreau and used triple sec only. I also added some white grape juice. Perfect for a casual BBQ.

Great! I, too, used simple syrup to sweeten. It needed more sugar that the amount specified. I added probably another 3/4 cup, granulated this time. Lovely recipe, was happy to have leftovers from a bridal shower...

This was a huge hit at my barbecue! I cut the recipe in half and still had plenty for my dozen guests. I used cheap burgundy as recommended and mixed everything but the club soda the day before. It was spectacular!

What a fun drink! The drink was beautiful to look at and delisious to drink and eat. I put in every conceiveable fruit. The best tasting where pineapple(you don't need to use the most expensive kind)and straberries. Kiwi sunk to the bottom but I happily retrieved them. I couldn't keep my nine year old daughter form drinking it too. Enjoy!

Great combination !!! My friends loved it. I will try with the Burgundy instead of the Zinfandel next time. It is a terrific drink for a girls pary (like a bridal shower or similar).

Excellent recipe. I combined ingredienets ahead of time in one large container and then added the ice cubes and club soda right before serving. I used half of the recipe for 7 ladies. Served it in glass pitchers with paella. There was some leftover. Everyone loved it. It went the distance from appetizers through dessert.

This is the best sangria I've ever made. I cut the recipe in half but also cut the amount of sugar to half of that. Didn't have superfine sugar and table sugar worked fine. Also used orange liquer instead of Cointreau. I mixed it all together earlier in the day and then chilled it. Very tasty and not a drop left. Served it with paella.

I and My guess loved this receipe for Sangria-- I added apples to it!!! Delicious!!!

This is a terrific recipe. My guests loved it, and they happily finished the whole carafe. I used Triple Sec instead of Cointreau, as suggested by previous reviews, and it was still delicious. If you need a "can't miss" recipe for a party, this is it.

A great recipe that was a hit at college parties. Now post-college, it is still great and can be "dressed up" with higher quality wine and brandy and cointreau (instead of triple sec).

Very popular with my 60 guests (especially the women) and easy to make. I made half the recipe and had plenty since we also offered wine, beer, and soda. Many asked for the recipe so they could serve it at their next pary.

I made this for a party and people asked me if it was a mimosa-- very orangy, but everyone still liked it. I put springs of mint thru the center of the floating orange slices- that was a nice visual touch.

Wow what a great recipe. I followed others' suggestions and used cheap burgandy and triple sec. I cut the recipe down to 1/4 of the full recipe with no problems. It's very pretty when you put in an assortment of fruit. It's a very economical drink to serve a crowd.

I loved this recipe!!! After suggesting this recipe to a friend that didn't want to purchase many bottles of wine for a large party, I used it for my own summer kickoff party. It's a great drink for large crowds. I also used triple sec, jug burgundy and added red & green grapes, cherries, apples, oranges, limes & lemons. I think it will be my drink of the summer!!!

I used a mixture of cheap Burgundy and pre-flavored sangria (yes, the Carlo Rossi jug! I felt pretty cheesy buying it), then added more sugar and other fruits as suggested by other reviewers but no club soda or ice cubes. Then it sat overnight in the fridge. It was a big hit at a friend's birthday potluck, so even though I made 3x times the amount in the recipe, we ran out halfway through!!

I made this for a father's day cook out & it was great. I followed some of the recommendations and substituted burgundy for the Zinfandel and Triple Sec for the Cointreau. I also made a sugar syrup dissolving the sugar in boiling water before adding it to the mix.

I agree with all the comments - had to whip a fresh batch in the middle of the party ... worked like a charm! I'd left all ingredients in the fridge - the club soda really ads to the flavor! Burgundy was a great substitution for Zinfandel.

everyone loved this recipe. i made it for a mexican-themed co-ed wedding shower and it was a hit with the guys and gals. i substituted the contreau with triple sec and used cheap burgundy wine also. i added the extra 3/4 cup sugar and lots of apples too. i never added the ice or club soda (forgot to add the soda). i chilled it for two days and then served it in a container on ice. i was fearful the ice would water it down and it sure didn't miss the club soda. have given this recipe out three times since the shower. enjoy.

I had everything except the Zinfindel so I used an Burgundy. It was a big hit with my friends. I had made a pan of Paella and the Sangria went so well with it. Give it a try.

This was a great recipe!! Very colorful. All our guests loved the Sangria. We added a lot of different cut fruit for texture and appearance (Star fruit for shape, oranges, limes, lemons, apples, peaches for color). We also used Rioja Spanish wine and added additional sugar, to taste! We had nothing left over, as it went down like punch. Enjoy.

I doubled this recipie for a party I hosted for 40 people, and people absolutely loved it. I got so many requests for the recipie that I got tired of repeating myself. I used about 50% more sugar than the recipie calls for, and subsitituted triple sec for Cointreau, as Cointreu is very expensive and wasted in this drink. Use LOTS of fruit (I used red & green apples, oranges, & limes)and let it all chill for at least 6 hrs for maximum flavor. Even the most hardcore beer drinkers abandoned the brew in favor of my sangria. Will make this again the first chance I get.

This recipe was fantastic! The best one I have found yet. I agree with everyone else that you can substitute triple sec for cointreau and definately add at least another 3/4 cup of sugar! I also added 2 limes, 3 apples and starfruit to liven my pitchers up. The fruit is the best part. Peaches are good too when in season. I never added ice directly to the liquid to avoid watering it down. Since you are making so much and the container most likely cannot fit in your fridge, I put large bags of ice right in the tub I made the sangria in to chill it the day before serving and this kept it cold. Must make at least one day ahead!

My wife and mother both love this recipe. To last a few days, I leave out the fruit and the club soda and put it in the fridge. Pour a glass, add a splash of club and off you go!

I served this sangria at a Cuban-themed party and my guests absolutely loved it. This is truly a delicious and fun party drink. I would suggest adding limes to the fruit and also mixing all ingredients (except the club soda but including the fruit) and chilling several hours in advance of serving.

Who on earth would make sangria without rioja(light spanish red table wine)? skip the zinfandel and pick up a bottle of CHEAP rioja. Good rioja is wasted in Sangria beacause of the juices and sugar.

this is a real treat. we've skipped the cointreau ($$) and used blackberry brandy, triple sec, whatever we've got around. also added apple slices which a spanish restaurant here does. agree with the added sugar-

This went over great with my friends. I did have to sweeten it up a little bit, more than the recipe required. I would definitely make it again.
