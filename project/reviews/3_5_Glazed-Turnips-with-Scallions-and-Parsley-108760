This stuff is dope! And this is coming from a hardcore turnip hater. I do agree that the cooking time is too long and the glaze needs to be reduced without overcooking the turnips but otherwise the simple ingredients produce a wow worthy side dish.

i thought this recipe was really delicious, will definitely make it over and over when i get turnips in my CSA. i took the turnips out before reducing so they didn't overcook, and would recommend not adding the additional salt in the beginning, as the chicken stock gets saltier as you reduce it and makes the final dish a little on the too-salty side.

Very nice recipe and very pure way to use turnips. I had to take mine out before the liquid reduced to a glaze because i didn't want them to get too soft, but i returned them at the end to finish in the glaze.

Great way to celebrate super-fresh turnips. I'd leave the sugar out next time, given the natural sweetness of turnips out of the garden. Used good veggie broth instead of chicken and a heavy hand on the scallions and parsley. It's all I ate for dinner!

These are very tasty, but they tend to get lost on the Thanksgiving table. The flavors are so mild they don't hold up against other bolder sides. I honestly am not sure if I'd make them again just because there are so many other things I can't wait to make again.

I'm not actually rating this recipe since mine didn't come out well due to poor quality turnips. It was really sad, as we grew the turnips ourselves. With the drought here the turnips didn't grow quite fast enough and by the time I harvested them they were very woody and bitter. That said, my woody turnips required the full amount of cooking time to soften. I think that if you have more tender turnips, definitely keep a close eye on them to make sure they don't turn to mush. I added in some extra sugar to tone down the bitterness. I think this is likely a very good recipe, just don't bother if you don't have very nice turnips.

I make this all the time. Cut the cooking time way down or the turnips will turn to mush. Often I have to remove the turnips from the pan when reducing the broth lest I overcook them.

This is a pretty tasty dish, and I am eager to make it again. Next time I won't simmer so long, as I'm afraid the turnips were overdone. I removed them from the pan ASAP and then reduced just the sauce to avoid further damage. The turnips from our organic produce box were as sweet as could be, and with the parsley and minced garlic chive topping, they were pretty to serve.

I used salad/baby turnips for this dish and they worked just fine. I cut down the cooking time though so they wouldn't get mushy. My husband said these were "almost as good as potatoes" which coming from him is high priase for a vegetable.

This is really tasty! It turned out a bit too salty for me, but then I realized it was because I did not use low-sodium chicken broth. Next time I will omit the salt. I prefer my scallions less crunchy, so I added them to the pan in the last minute of cooking.

I really enjoyed this dish. My husband and son gave "2 thumbs up". My daughter gave it one nose turned WAY up (but what do you want from a 6 year old?) My only change in the remaking might be to add more sugar or even a touch of honey to soften the edge. To Indian Rocks beach - be sure to use a wide-bottomed pan to reduce the liquid more quickly, a taller pot will slow things down.

We loved this. Cooking for two, I thirded the recipe as did Susan in below review. I used baby turnips. I wasn't sure they needed to be peeled, but gave in and peeled them anyway. My meal needed some color so I added a few young carrots. I also added a bit more sugar than called for. At the end it took me quite a while to cook down the glaze so I removed the vegs until near the very end. I used more parsley and scallion for the third of this recipe. I could make an entire meal of this turnip dish!

I LOVE this. I fixed it for the second time tonight, since clipping it from Gourmet. I am a lifetime turnip lover. My husband is not. I think he didn't like admitting it, but he did like this. I thirded the recipe for the two of us, and when there wasn't any left for a second helping, he was disappointed. This and my all-time-favorite way to fix turnips, mashed with plenty of butter and salt and pepper and a teaspoon or so of sugar, will be repeated time and time again.

I am a lifetime turnip lover. My wife is not. She prepared this recipe and loved it although she claims the quality of the turnips had a lot to do with it. They were small, fresh and crisp, not pithy as many are. I thought it was very tasty but then again I love turnips in just about any way including raw.
