It was okay. Just okay. I followed the advise based on previous reviews.... but it was just okay.

This recipe stunk. While the cake had good flavor, it weighed like a rock. It was too dense, more so than a pound cake. Of all the cakes I have made and the different recipes I have used, I have never been so grossly disappointed. I do not think I have rated a recipe so low on Epicurious, and I have been using this site since 1995. I had a great white cake recipe, but could not find it the day I went to make a cake for Easter this year. I did find it though. So, here it is and please stop using this horrific recipe: Classic White Cake Nonstick cooking spray 2 1/4 cups cake flour (9 ounces), plus more for dusting the pans 1 cup whole milk, at room temperature 6 large egg whites (3/4 cup), at room temperature 2 teaspoons almond extract 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 3/4 cups granulated sugar (12 1/4 ounces) 4 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon table salt 12 tablespoons unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks), softened but still cool 1. For the Cake: Set oven rack in middle position. (If oven is too small to cook both layers on a single rack, set racks in upper-middle and lower-middle positions.) Heat oven to 350 degrees. Spray two 9-inch round cake pans with nonstick cooking spray; line the bottoms with parchment or waxed paper rounds. Spray the paper rounds, dust the pans with flour, and invert pans and rap sharply to remove excess flour. 2. Pour milk, egg whites, and extracts into 2-cup glass measure, and mix with fork until blended. 3. Mix cake flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in bowl of electric mixer at slow speed. Add butter; continue beating at slow speed until mixture resembles moist crumbs, with no powdery streaks remaining. 4. Add all but 1/2 cup of milk mixture to crumbs and beat at medium speed (or high speed if using handheld mixer) for 1 1/2 minutes. Add remaining 1/2 cup of milk mixture and beat 30 seconds more. Stop mixer and scrape sides of bowl. Return mixer to medium (or high) speed and beat 20 seconds longer. 5. Divide batter evenly between two

This was published in the May 1993 Food & Wine issue and I have used this as my go-to white cake recipe since then. Not sure why it doesn't show up on the food &wine website. It is moist and dense and a good foil for a sweet filling or fruit, nuts, etc. I will sometimes brush a flavored sugar syrup (coffee, liquor, etc.) on each layer, but it's not necessary. I would give this 3 1/2 forks, but the website won't let me. I would not give it 4 forks only because I am a chocoholic and only make this for folks who specifically ask for a white cake for their birthday.

I did not care for the flavor of this cake. I have made other white cakes and felt the same about them also. I prefer vanilla cakes made with whole eggs. I don't mind a dense cake as long as the flavor is there and this just doesn't have it.

Awesome. This is my go-to non-chocolate cake. It's dense, but tender, moist, and amazing. Holds together great as cupcakes but also makes epic cakes. LOVE it. I do whip the egg whites though for a wee bit of extra lift.

Giving it 4 forks for taste...mine still turned out a little dense even though I folded the whites (by themselves) in at the last step...but, I'm convinced I need "folding 101"! I also used a combo of vanilla & almond extract and really liked that taste. I'll give this one another try later,,,in 2012!

Definitely better with the eggs whipped and folded in at the end. I've made it by the directions at least 6 times, and it's always been nice, perfect crumb great taste, but a little dense. This time it's so fluffy and airy. Can't wait to get my customer's feedback!

IT'S SO FLUFFY I'M GONNA DIE! OK, not really, but that movie was cute, and that quote describes this cake pretty well. I made this cake for my grandpa's seventieth, so it had to be perfect. I started by sifting the dry ingredients together. Then, I made sure to cream the butter and sugar thoroughly, since I often cut corners on that, and added the full 2t of vanilla. Step four is where I really deviated- I just measured out the milk, and let it be. I added the pure milk and flour alternately, beating on low for about ten seconds each time, careful not to overmix. Once the milk and flour were totally incorporated, I folded in some egg whites. A little earlier, I had beat my egg whites with a little less than 1/8 of a teaspoon cream of tartar until they formed soft peaks. I folded these into the batter, stating with about a quarter, then all of it. It seemed for a while that the batter was too heavy for the egg whites, but it turned out fine in the end. I baked the cakes in two-eight inch pans for thirty-two minutes, and cooled them per the directions. They are delicious. I plan to put a lemon filling in between the two layers, and top it all with a seven-minut frosting and coconut.

I researched and chose this recipe for my daughter's birthday. I used other reveiwers' suggestion and folded in the whisked egg whites at the end as well as barely mixed the ingredients by hand. Unfortunately I ran into the same issue as some other rewiewers; the layers turned out dense, heavy and not particularly tasty, and so did not make for a nice base for a birthday cake. In the end, the cake looked nice with chocolate butterflies and little marshmallow flowers on top, but was a bit disappointing to everyone.

I've made 5 white cakes this week trying to get a really good one. This is the best I have found so far. I used 1.75 t vanilla and .75 t almond extracts. The key to this cake is to NOT over mix it. I mixed each addition no more than 20 seconds and just barely whisked the egg whites and milk. This turned out to be just what a delicious white cake should be; delicate flavor, very moist with a nice crumb. Perfect for a variety of fillings.

i found this to be too heavy and dense, despite folding in the egg white at the end as suggested by other reviewers. i'd look for and try another recipe for a white cake. only if unsuccessful will i try making this again.

Made cupcakes from this recipe and they were spectacular! My new go-to for a white cake! Great flavor, moist, a bit dense. They got rave revues and I will def make them again!

A great cake (if a little small)! It came out moist but firm - so it tasted great but was easy to work with. I live at altitude so often cakes just don't rise properly and come out crumbly. This cake, however, rose nicely and had a great, somewhat dense quality. It also looked beautiful. Following reader recommendations, I whipped the egg whites into peaks and folded them into the batter separately from the milk. Paired with a lemon cream cheese frosting, it was a hit!

I've made this a couple times for wedding practice. The first time, I made the 9 inch layers and used the mascarpone frosting from the almond praline cake recipe (Bon Appetit in Epicurious) with strawberries in the middle. The second time, I used the entire recipe to make a single 12 inch layer--same baking time 30-35 minutes, and it came out perfectly again. This time, I cut it in thirds, made a triple layer triangle cake frosted with the bittersweet chocolate frosting recipe also in epicurious. Now for that diet ...

This cake was awesome! I did whip the egg whites in last, as well as added a bit of lemon zest. I also made a raspberry mascarpone filling and topped it off with a whipped cream frosting. I did make two extra, as I wanted a 3 layer cake. I used the additional cake by making 3 cut outs and served them the night before as mini personal cakes. It was great!

I made this recipe for my dad's birthday, to be served with a brown sugar frosting and chocolate ganache. He LOVED it. And so did everyone else. I took the recommendation from the comments to whip the egg whites and fold them in at the end, which helped to lighten the cake up a bit, I think.

Perfectly moist, fine crumb white layers with a rich flavor. For dramatic contrast, layer with Chocolate Layer Cake (Gourmet 2004) and frost with vanilla buttercream.

Hmmmm. I'm not sure about this cake. I followed the recommendations of other reviewers and beat the eggs and mixed them in last. However, my cakes were still really short and unimpressive. The other issue I have with this cake is that it's really not WHITE--it's yellow. And for my purposes, that didn't work. All of that said, it tasted very good!

This is a superb, simple, and simply delicious cake.

Delicious! I, too, followed the advice of others and whipped the egg whites separately until soft peaks, then folded gently into the batter. I iced with the chocolate sour cream frosting from Epicurious. The cake disappeared amid requests for the recipe.

Don't mix egg whites with the milk. Instead mix the milk when you're supposed to. But mix the egg whites last as follows: - whip the egg whites until they get fluffy - then fold in the egg whites gently.

We made this cake today as a "practice" for an upcoming birthday party. It's a fabulous white cake - just the right amount of flavor for a white cake. A lemon filling would likely be perfect. My only complaint would be that it's too moist. It could be that it's really humid today. I froze a layer to see how that would turn out, so maybe that will help.

The cake was absolutely delicious. The only problem I had was the cake did not rise enough and I ended up having to buy a box mix to make a 3rd layer.

I replaced the all purpose flour with spelt flour and it was fantastic. My daughter came home so excited from school saying that they kids were bargaining away their jolly ranchers for a second piece.

Like others suggested, I beat the egg whites separately and folded them in last. I had the cake with whipped cream and strawberries, and it was delicious. I'll definitely be keeping the recipe!

I made this recipe but added 1/2 tsp almond extract and it was really flavorful. Until last night, I had never made a plain white cake (I always added fruit puree) but this was a great first. It is a good base for cupcakes and layer cakes. On it's own, it is a little dense and I would go for a chiffon or just whip the egg whites and fold them in after adding the milk to this recipe.

This cake was just what I was looking for. It was very light and moist. I added a teaspoon of almond flavor for the authentic white birthday cake taste. I really enjoyed it.

This recipe never tell you when to add the sugar and butter mixture the the rest of the batter. What's up with that.

In a 9" round, the cake was about one inch thick. The finished product, once frosted and layered looked more substantial. I used the Lemon Cream Cheese Frosting recipe from this site. The cake is dense, with good flavor and very easy to frost. Would definitely make the combination of the two again, as everybody enjoyed.

I wasn't thrilled with this one. The taste isn't bad, but the texture is very firm, verging on tough. It might be a good recipe if you wanted to cut shapes out of it to build a cake sculpture, but on its own it's so-so. I won't make this again.

Over the years I've tried a lot of 'classic white cake' recipes and this is by far the best I've ever made. The cake is moist and has a great flavor. It is now THE birthday cake recipe at my house.

Well, I made this cake with half whole wheat pastry flour and half all-purpose flour. Then I used 1 cup honey instead of the sugar, and I used vanilla soymilk and vegan butter. I also used a 9 x 13 pan instead of layering it. I can't tell if I'm brilliant or I just like weird tasting desserts, but I think it came out really well. It came out very light and fluffy which is unusual when you use whole wheat pastry flour and honey. Because of the 9 x 13 pan it did come out kind of thin. So if you like to substitute "healthy" ingredients I would recommend basing it on this recipe!

I have tried many white cake recipes but this one is the best by far. It is easy to frost yet still moist. Nick Malgieri triumphs once again!

Non-milk product version: Because of an allergy to casein, the milk protein, I cannot eat any milk products. I substituted cold-pressed sunflower oil for the butter and club soda for the milk. I followed the instructions exactly. The result was a rather insipid-looking, greyish cake. The texture was light and airy and it tastes fine, but definitely needs the dressing up of a filling and an icing. I made 12 cupcakes with all of the better and filled one with a very delicious no-butter lemon curd recipe (http://www.recipezaar.com/Lighter-Lemon-Lime-Curd-No-Butter-260160). Not bad, but I will probably fill the others with raspberry jam and ice with 7 minute icing.

Great basic white cake. I am a simple syrup fan so I brushed the layers before frosting. Everyone loved it.Will definitly use often.

This cake was fantastic. I searched for a basic white cake recipe and every recipe I found had reviews that claimed it was dry. I took a chance on this one (when I found it, it had no reviews) and I'm glad I did! The only thing I changed was that I made it in a 9x13 pan instead of two 9" rounds. Came out beautifully! I received so many compliments. Topped with a vanilla cream cheese frosting and unsweetened coconut.

This is one of the best white cake recipes I have come across. It is delicious with strawberry or lemon filling.
