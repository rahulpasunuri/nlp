I used a frozen deep dish pie crust and baked according to these directions. I did have to cover the edges to keep them from burning. I used a 16oz jar of medium salsa verde well drained instead of poblanos (I had the salsa and the store did not have poblanos). I used sour cream instead of heavy cream.....and this was delicious! It did make too much filling but I baked this in a separate dish and it was delicious as well! A great brunch with muffins and fruit!

I added chicken chorizo to this dish and everyone loved it. It need some zip.

This recipe is ok. The texture is fairly nice and consistent, but nothing special. I'd say the flavor was on the bland side, I'd use a different cheese, maybe an infused cheddar like horseradish, or add some spice... I also used a graham crust which was an interesting counterbalance to the savory flavors.

I clipped this recipe when it first came out and finally tried it yesterday-wonderful! I used 4 eggs and 2/3rds of the other ingredients (full dose of garlic paste) and baked 45 minutes in a 7 inch crust. Really tasty, will be making this again and again. Can't wait for this years Chile Festival in Hatch! Next time will get the crema; used regular cream this time. Now I need a good wine- Graves, maybe?

My family LOVED this recipe--even the non- quiche eaters. I did change the recipe as others recommended. I doubled the cheese and used sharp cheddar and romano. I also added pre- made chicken meatballs. Used zucchini. I used the 6 eggs called for in the original recipe and also used the heavy cream. The quiche was really tasty and I will make it again. One note: it took much longer to cook than I anticipated. I literally had to double the baking time.

I have made this twice, today makes 3! Perfect for extra Thanksgiving pie crust! I also use Hatch Green Chilies (we buy a bushel every fall, and de-seed and peel while still warm) from the freezer. I use cheddar and pepperjack cheese, triple garlic, and add about 1-2 tsp. coarse sea salt to onion while sautéing. I line crust with pepperjack b/f custard, then custard, layer of chilies and cheese, repeat. This dish is now our "I'm sick of turkey tradition!" I'm a modifier, but friends and family love it!

This quiche is even better for breakfast! But it makes A LOT, so a deep-dish pie crust is a must.

I made this with some of the variations recommended by other reviewers. I doubled the garlic, used 1/2 cup of grated white onion, and substituted Anaheim chiles because I couldn't find poblanos at the store. My guests seemed to really like it, but I thought it was a little bland and uninspired. Maybe the mexican flavors just don't work in a quiche? It was definitely edible, tasty even, but just lacked a certain something to be one of those recipes I will try again and again.

I would definitely make this again; however a deep dish pie crust is a good idea. The 6 eggs mixture made more than a regular 9 inch pie crust could hold.

Easy and a beautiful presentation. I agree it needs more garlic and more onion. I added a little crushed red pepper flakes beause I like spicy food. Delicious.

I've made this multiple times to rave reviews, but with alterations. First, I saute the onions in some butter. I also roast some sweet corn and add that to the mixture (about 1.5 cups). Finally, I serve it with some fresh salsa, although I think it's excellent by itself.

mmm, delicious! and so very easy! i used a frozen deep dish pie crust, all i had to do was throw the peppers under the broiler, prep the onions, garlic and cheese and mix it all together...i did double the garlic and added extra onions, also put in a dash of chili flakes, baked about 15min longer....my first quiche, i was worried it would be tedious and difficult, but turned out very tasty!

Making this for the third time tonight. I just love it! I use deep-dish, frozen pie crusts to cut down on time on busy weeknights, and I always make 2 at a time, since they freeze very well. I agree with some that this is not extremely spicy, but it's got such wonderfully delicate flavors and incredible texture that I don't think spice is the point. Also, roasting & steaming the peppers is fun!

This quiche had some real kick to it. We loved it, and will make it again. I served it with a nice fresh fruit salad, sausage and fresh OJ for Thanksgiving brunch. I would not recommend their suggested method for roasting the peppers (using the steaming after the broiling).

I think didn't think this was 'bland' as some other reviewers mentioned. I did double the garlic, and do think I had fairly warm poblanos...but either way I think a quiche-like dish should be fairly mellow. I liked it. We made a small salad and had white wine and it was a great meal. It did take longer than I thought - didn't see all of the dough chilling/par baking time in the recipe - my bad.

I used a pre-made pie crust to save time, and added chopped green onions to the ingredients. The results were very delicious. This recipe went into my favorites file!

Quite good. I agree that one it could use a little more zing. I doubled the garlic. The poblanos had a nice amount of heat.

THANKS for the tip about the 'Scoville scale'. After checking it out I got hold of some ancho chillies which worked a treat although we all thought a bit hotter would be even better. I used more onion and added some extra mature cheddar as well 'cos several reviewers said it was bland......DELICIOUS!

I would make this again only if I added some more ingredients. It was a little bland. I even used pepperjack cheese. I would probably add some green onion and spicy hot sausage next time.

Used pre-made crust to cut down on prep time. Used sliced green onion in lieu of onion and was delicious. Didn't change anything else. This recipe went into my "favorites" book.

Labor intensive, but comes out just like the picture. Was so busy this week, I simply tackled a few parts of this recipe when I had the time over the course of sev'l days--prepared the peppers and grated cheese one day, cooked the pie shell on another day, prepared the filling the next. When I was ready to cook it, I just had to assemble it in minutes. To save more time, I too used packaged crusts that fit the tart pan fine. I used only 5 eggs b/c I had Extra large eggs. I used half and half for the whole milk, diluting it a little. I used grated white cheddar b/c that's what I had on hand. Poblanos are mild, but the 1/2 tsp. of pepper in the mixture gave this a needed kick. I did not find this bland at all. This inspires me to do it again with an Italian flair w/ bell peppers and mozzerella, with or with crumbled sausage.

A unique and very flavorful quice! While the roasted peppers and Jack cheese are the foundation, there's plenty of room for experimenting with the herbs and supplimental flavors.

Re one of the previous reviewer from Skanksville. Poor dear must be still drunk. Gave the recipe four stars after saying it was horrid. And there is no Skanksville, NJ. Poor thing needs a life.

Very nice and easy to make if you just use the Pillsbury pre made crusts. Leftovers keep nicely for 2-3 days and still yummy.

I made this with fresh roasted Hatch green chiles, which are in all the markets right now, and cut down a bit on the quantity, since they tend to be hotter than poblanos. Yum! Cook from England, you can substitute canned green chiles for the poblanos if you can't find any fresh, they are usually fairly mild. Taste a bit and cut down on the quantity if you think it's too spicy.

To the cook from England: there is a "heat" scale for peppers called the Scoville scale; a websearch should find it for you. Poblanos are relatively low on the scale; they are mildly spicy, but with a wonderful, rich flavor when roasted, similar to a spicy bell pepper. Also, "Bravo!" to you for your comments to the "cook" from NJ; boors such as that should be barred from this website. Good luck with the recipe!

Firstly, to the rude drunk from Skanksville; I suggest you crawl back into your bottle of bourbon and eat take-away, alone, so you don't offend anyone else with your retching. Secondly, can anyone tell me how hot are poblano chillies? I haven't been able to get any and I'm wondering what to use instead.

My homemade piecrust (from the yellow Gourmet Recipe tome) helped fill the kitchen with impossible-to-resist fragrance even before anyone tasted the quiche, which was pure heaven. Picture perfect; I made it in a solid 12" square fluted tart pan with no problems. This one's a keeper as it behaved just as the recipe promised.

really good, but next time I'm using salsa verde instead of onions/garlic, and I left the seeds in the chiles, but not much heat

I made this as an appetizer. It was a huge success. The Jack cheese made a nice mild flavor for the spicy poblanos..What a great taste!!
