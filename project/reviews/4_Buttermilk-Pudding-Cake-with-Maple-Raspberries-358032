This cake was a little disappointing. My family really liked it, and it was a hit with our guests, but I wasn't wowed by it. I would highly recommend serving it warm, I liked it much better when I'd heated it up. It's a great dish for people who aren't too big on sweets, and it had a nice texture. Good, but not my favorite.

I thought this was way too sweet. There is so much sugar in the batter that the berries would've been fine without maple syrup. I didn't get either pudding or cake, just tasted like an under-baked angel food cake.

This is really special without becoming imposing. Yum. Also, there's a great video tutorial for making it on Gourmet's old site, here; http://www.gourmet.com/food/testkitchen/2009/09/gourmet_today_lemon_pudding_cake

Oh man I don't know why more people haven't reviewed this! I don't even LIKE cake, but that's okay because this really isn't cake! It's like fluffy happiness with just this hint of sourness that adds depth and amazing flavour to the 'cake'. It feels soft and squishy and cakey and delicious on the tongue but tastes like the worlds best happiest pancake. It's like pancake injected with custard and risen six inches. How can a pancake get better? This is how!! It's not a pancake - it's a bowlcake! Gooey fluffy and perfect. I can't stop raving about it, haven't you seen? I eat it with date syrup and it is amazing. Just a drizzle of sweet stuff and you're in heaven. I'm sure angels eat this for breakfast.
