I do this almost every week. Just love its simplicity.

This was a great alternative to eating squash as a sidedish, but I found the recipe lacking in flavor. The prepwork outweighed the end product, but I think I would have appreciated it more if I had used less pasta and thickened the sauce.

Good but not great. Not worth all the chopping - not a "keeper".

I really liked this, and although I did make some substitutions, I think they were minor to the overall outcome. I love the texture that the cooked squash gives - it just thickens to a rich sauce without being too vegetabl-y. I sub'd garlic for onion, left out celery and proscuitto, and used 2 tbsp tomato paste for fresh. In addition to Parmesan, I used gorgonzola, which I loved.

I made this a couple of times a while ago. Very tasty.

The recipe is good. For a little more flavor I used white wine instead of water.
