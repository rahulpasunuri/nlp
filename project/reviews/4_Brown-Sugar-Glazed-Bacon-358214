A sure-to-please staple for breakfast, brunch or appetizer. I have made it with brown sugar as well as maple syrup; both turn out equally delicious. The cayenne is a plus for contrasting with the sweet. Never a scrap leftover and I could make it every day with no complaints. Try it on a BLT and fall in love again! Have even taught my teens to make it as it is easy and makes them feel like accomplished chefs.

I made this for a brunch gathering and it was a smashing success. For a special presentation, I twisted the bacon before baking. It came out looking like curls, nice effect.

We meat smokers know this as "Pig Candy". And we add some cayenne to give it just a bit of heat. I use ground red Hatch chile. It is best cooked on a smoker with hickory or pecan for smoke. It's killer, you can't stop 'til it's gone.

Easy. Delicious. Plus, it's bacon, what's not to like.

To us meat smokers this is known as Pig Candy. It is best if cooked in a smoker with your choice of wood, I prefer hickory. And I would add a heaping tablespoon of ground red Hatch chile pepper to the brown sugar. Good eats Maynard!

I thought this was fantastic, and will definitely make it again--but a note to bacon enthusiasts--my boyfriend, who does not have a sweet tooth like mine (mine is insatiable) said that this bacon was too sweet and he called it "gummy bear bacon". He did eat all of it, so it must not have been that distasteful to him, though :) So, you might want to use a tad less sugar if you're feeding someone who might be less than a sugar-a-holic like me ;)

Made this just as directed for Easter brunch. It was inhaled immediately and I was yelled at for not making more! This will be a must for breakfast occasions from now on. I just love that it goes in the oven all at once and comes out perfect and effortlessly!

in addition, a couple of sprays of liquid smoke enhanses well cured bacon's savory sweetness

I've been doing bacon this way for awhile and it is a revelation! Only 2 ingredients and it's done in the oven. many thanks to valori for the accordion on a toothpick suggestion to serve as an appetizer - brilliant! I am eager to try it!

I followed the recipe and felt it was too greasy, no matter how many times I drained it on papertowels. I like the idea of skewers, and the cayenne pepper! I love sweet/hot combo. If I make it again, I'll try it. Maybe I will have a more positive feeling about it. As it is, not so much.

Recommendation from a friend - season with black pepper. Pepper is a perfect match for the brown sugar - this recipe is a must in our brunch menu!

we cut the bacon in half and then fold the strips accordian style and spear them on a toothpick. place the pieces in a pyrex dish with lots of brown sugar. serve them as a appetizer on the toothpicks. they will vanish

This is also great when adding Dijon mustard with the brown sugar.

I've made this several times for parties. It is always a HUGE hit. People talk about it for weeks. I like to cut the bacon strips in half and serve with deviled eggs.

This is my favorite way to fix bacon. No splattery mess on the stove. Use thick bacon for best results. I also sometimes use maple syrup brushed on the bacon instead of brown sugar. Num.
