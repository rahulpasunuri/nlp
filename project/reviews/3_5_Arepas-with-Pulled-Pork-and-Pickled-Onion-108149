Also - try to find Harina Pan for the arepa flour. It is what every Venezuelan uses.

From the picture, these do look like Venezuelan arepas... I am Venezuelan and pulled pork is a typical stuffer for these, though. You can stuff arepas with whatever you want.. not just butter and cheese. Ask your husband to take you to Venezuela and have a "reina pepiada" arepa that even has avocado in it. Puyi - you're right, arepas are all over the place, but Colombian arepas are way different - they are yellow and usually flat.

I used goya achiote paste. It gives a beautiful red color. I served half as a roast, and saved the rest for sandwiches and shepherd's pie with a twist. Worth the 2 and a half hours.

This was one of the best meals I have had for quite some time. I do not have a spice grinder, so the achiote seeds were tricky- but ended up simmering in a tiny bit of oil, tossing the seeds, and adding the enhanced oil to the marinade. Only other alternations were swapping 1% for the whole milk in the arepas, and garnishing with avocado. Delicious!

I made this for a party I had. I made the marinade the night before and it smelled awful, so I scrapped it and made up my own with some of the same ingredients added lemon juice and left out the vinegar. So much better. Everyone loved this dish, it was the highlight of the night. The arepas were good and mild, and the pickled onions were fantastic. cooked the pork in a slow cooker for eight hours too.

Reviewing just the pork part. I used pork butt, marinated for 2 days, then slow cooked in over for 3 hrs, annatto paste is key, got mine at Whole Foods. This was amazing! I shredded the pork and served it as burritos with all the fixen's, can't wait to make it again.

Haven't done this dish yet, although certainly does look interesting, but I had to say to Tallaan from Los Angeles, Arepas are not only a Venezuelan dish. Maybe it varies between countries, but Arepas are made in many countries throughout Latin America, and are served with many different things such as ham and cheese, beans, chicken, etc. I'd say this recipe is just another version and worth trying out.

My husband is Venezuelan and we eat a lot of Arepas. This receipe isn't that great, and we usually only eat them with cheese and butter. Sometimes I put eggs and bacon in them, but I'm American so they look at me in mock horror, but it tastes really good. No pulled pork! Ick! Arepas are NOT "mexican" cuisine.

This is in addition to my previous comment about using this recipe for BBQ. ~ Cut gourmet burger buns in 1/2 across the top (making 4 quarters. ~ Pour BBQ sauce into squirt beverage bottle. ~ Let guests assemble w/ tongs: Pile pork onto bun, then pickled onions. Squeeze on BBQ sauce and top w/ bun. Serving 1/2 portions allows people to enjoy other BBQ favorites w/out filling up too quickly. This will be the dish they remember...

Okay, I no longer bother with this recipe as an appetizer. I cook the pork in this fashion and then serve it at BBQs on hamburger buns with a squirt of BBQ sauce. Big crowd pleaser!

I was looking for a Mexican pulled pork recipe to use in tacos. I don't think this was exactly what I was looking for. The pork was certainly tender, but I think I expected the sauce to be more earthy and pungent instead of light and tangy. I ended up adding some tomato sauce at the end to thicken it up and add some body to it...probably sacreligious, but it did the trick...

This is so good and the pork freezes well. We make extra meat, freeze it and make nachos and taquitos with it for quick easy appetizers months later

Re the three components of this dish - the pickled onions are fab. The color kept beautifully and I've decided to keep these on hand for any plain meat, fish or chicken dish. Arepas are a big thing here and these are delicious The pulled pork is good - not great - just keep the cooking liquid (not just what collects in the plate) to let the pork rest in while assembling these things. Works well together with the onions and arepas. I like the make ahead factor here and as long as I could rememeber to save all the cooking liquid from the pork to save it in til the last minute I would absolutely make this again. And in case you didn't notice, we are INCREDIBLY picky eaters!!!

I made all three components of this dish for a Mexican theme night. The pulled pork was a lot of work and not the best I have had. The arepas were delicious although I changed the recipe so much that I can't really comment on this recipe. My real reason for leaving this review is to say that we all LOVED the pickled onion. It was easy and so delicious. I used it as part of a salsa I prepared for the evening and also used as a condiment to go with quesadillas. Although it requires 12 hours to pickle - it is super easy and fantastic!

This dish is amazing. All of the flavors really work together. Have made it several times. To the reviewer before me, Arepa flour is usually found in the spanish section of the super market. Goya makes it, as well as other companies. It's a very fine corn flour, sometimes labeled masarepa flour.

I love arepas as I grew up eating them for breakfast (being Venezuelan). But I never thought that my husband being as American as it can get, would love them. Well, he loves them and ask me to cook them all the time. This recipe is certainly a solution for variety when making them for him. Now, there is a kitchen appliance designed by Oster to help you make arepas. It is called: Tostiarepa, and it really helps me. THANKS for placing this recipe on your website.

This is not the typical way Venezuelans make arepas. Matter of fact the package of "arepa flour" calls for the flour, water and salt to taste. 90% of the time we fill them with butter and cheese. Sometimes we put other things in them, but usually it is just butter & cheese.

Nice recipe for the arepas (typical from Venezuela). They taste amazing with cheese and tomato (that's what we usually eat for breakfast here)... the pulled pork is not so appealing to me, though...
