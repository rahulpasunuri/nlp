Used this recipe for a base - dinner for vegetarian friends... It was enjoyed by all and there are still two servings left....Here's what I did: Sauteed 3 carrots, 3 celery, med /lg onion and 6 garlic cloves for a while, till soft... Added 2 cans tomatoes, prob 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes, maybe 1 C of red wine, salt, dried parsley and let it cook - maybe 45 min / hr... Added 1 can chickpeas (to warm) as pasta cooked. Made box of dried pasta - took out 1 min early, reserved 1 C pasta water and mixed pasta into veg, adding pasta water as needed to sauce it up. Then added about 7 oz fresh spinach, worked through pasta till wilted and lastly added about 1/2 C fresh grated parm. This dish got rave reviews. Will make again! :)

I really love orecchiette and chickpeas, so I was really looking forward to this recipe. However, the sauce was bland and tasted strongly of celery and carrots. It was not even "saucy". Perhaps using canned tomatoes or tomato paste as some reviewers suggested would have helped. It was edible, but I couldn't get myself to finish the leftovers...and I rarely throw food away. I was very disappointed.

I typically avoid packaged foods, with 3 exceptions -- canned chickpeas, canned tomatoes and dried pasta -- which turn this into a fast, flavorful, healthy weeknight dinner! After reading the other reviews, I upped the flavor in the sauce by skipping the water and substituting the juice from the canned tomatoes and some red wine, and added generous pinches of salt, rosemary or herbs de provence, a bay leaf and tomato paste. Also threw in chard near the very end. For dinner for 4, I used a can each of chickpeas and diced tomatoes, and the same vegetable quantities listed in the recipe. This will become a regular recipe!

I used green lentils, dried pasta, 400G canned plum tomatoes, 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes, 6 garlic cloves and 2 medium onions. I think the earthier taste of the lentils helps out. We enjoyed it, but I suspect this is a sauce that tastes even better as leftovers.

Two forks still means good, but it wasn't great. I made the pasta, which was interesting (in a good way!). I also made the sauce, but I really think it needed more flavor. I added tomato paste and basil. I would also recommend adding some greens to it. This is something that can be altered easily to suit your specific taste and my suggestions are only a few that can be used. Again, an ok recipe that has a lot of potential! I will make this again!

I make this recipe regularly. With boxed pasta and canned beans (and sometimes canned tomatoes too) its easy and delish. I toss a bunch of chard, chopped, into the sauce five minutes before serving to up the nutritional profile. I also sometimes top it with feta.

I note the good reviews are from people who didn't make the pasta. The pasta was ridiculously wet and unworkable the first time so I tried again and the second time increased the flour worked in during kneading. It it was still unworkable. I pitched the rest of the dough. The sauce was bland as good be even using the dried chickpeas. I usually only rate the recipes on this site I really like but this was perhaps the worst one I've tried.

The semolina we had was really couscous so forget that part--I used macaroni shells. Some tomato paste guaranteed that the sauce wouldn't be runny, and I added a little red wine and some italian seasoning, and used a fresh jalapeno pepper instead of the flakes. Anyway, this is a really good dish. Oh, and I used road salt instead of sea salt since we are 500 miles from the ocean and only 100 yards from the road. That's a joke...

I used canned chickpeas, canned tomatoes, and dried pasta, and it was delicious. I'd definitely make it again when I want to pull together a quick and healthy pasta dinner.

While I give props to anyone who makes this from scratch...this is just as good made from partially prepared ingredients. I do make my own marinara sauce, but my pasta is from "DeCecco", the chickpeas are canned, but the cheese is always "Parm Reg"! One little thing I like to do is to throw a small fresh branch of rosemary into the tomato sauce while it's simmering. Mix with the beans, taste for seasonings, and you should be good to go! This is just wonderful "comfort food"...go and enjoy!

I made this for my family last week and we all loved it. Although the ingredients are simple, the dish has a lot of flavour. I used dried chickpeas, store-bought pasta and extra parsley.

I was a little disappointed with this after reading all the rave reviews. As a disclaimer: I used store-bought small shell pasta instead of orchiette because they didn't have any at the store. I will definitely try to make orecchiette on a day I have more time. The sauce, however, I followed to the T. I felt it lacked flavor. It was a little bland and a little heavy. It was by no means bad, just not great.

One of the best recipes I have ever made, and one of the best things I have ever eaten. The flavor is light, yet earthy; simple, yet complex. It gets better as you eat it. And the orecchiette is surprisingly easy to make. I absolutely love this.

Better than the sum of its ingredients. A super staple in our repertoire now. Dried chickpeas definitely improve the dish, though I use the "quick soak" method. Also, I've never made the orecchiette by hand, only used DeCecco brand, and it comes out fantastic every single time!

I used white beans instead of chickpeas, and maybe that affected the taste of this dish. I thought it was good but not great. I think I also made my orecchiette too thick, and they were more like lima beans when they were cooked than like little ears. I might try this again, with chickpeas and smaller orecchiette. It WAS fun making the little ears, even if I didn't do it right!

Excellent dish. The orecchiette are very easy and fun to make. The sauce is to die for, so earthy, so full of simple flavours. A friend made that sauce to accompany polenta instead of the pasta and it was wonderful too.

This was very well received by my 9-11 year old classes. They love the story about eating 'little ears'

I think the dried chickpeas are part of the key to this dish. They have such a better flavor and texture than canned. This recipe is easy and delicious and will become a staple for me. I made the sauce the day before I served it and simply reheated and added the parsley before serving. The sauce is so easy! And the pasta is not difficult and so much better than dried. I do agree with the other reviewers, it took some trial and error to get my technique down for shaping the pasta and mine also were too thick. I will try making smaller ears next time as well!

This recipe was the surprise hit of the issue, I think. It's a good pantry staple meal if you don't make your own pasta and use a can of chickpeas. Since we're cooking for two, we use 1/2 lb pasta and a can of chickpeas but leave all the other ingredients the same. Makes enough for leftovers for lunch the next day. Surprisingly delicious.

This was my first time making my own orecchiette, and while I enjoy the chewiness, I thought the pasta instructions were a little off. I rolled the ropes of pasta dough out to 3/4 inch as indicated and cut 1/4 inch pieces, but next time I will roll them thinner before I cut. Once I got the hang of the thumb twist they started to look better, but they were much too thick to dry in half an hour. I'll make this again because it was fun to do (and I'm mildly obsessed with chickpeas), but I'll make smaller little ears next time!

This is a great recipe! I used canned chickpeas, baby grape tomatoes in a can called pomodorini and added Sauteed chard ,raw garlic & parsley at the end of cooking with a good glug of excellent olive oil to perk it all up a bit -fantastic!!!

Good, but not amazing. Recipe actually seemed to take less time that we'd expected (pre- soaked the beans). Used dried heirloom beans and cut the olive oil to 1/2 cup (that was still plenty). Recipe made more than twice enough sauce, but that was okay- I'm still eating it (I suspect we used a little too much dough for each pasta and that may have used the pasta up faster).

Reminded me of my Italian grandmother's cooking. Delicious the next day, too. I substituted one can of chopped tomatoes. I also used 2 cans of chickpeas (aka chichi beans) instead of dried. Ended up with twice as much sauce as needed for the amount of pasta made, so I froze half of it for another time.
