I made this dessert for Christmas Day filled with so much food and at the end of a turkey dinner with all the trimmings. It turned out fabulous, and although I could not find Boysenberry sorbet, I used Blackberry instead - it was marvellous...everybody raved about it!! It was so light and refreshing at the end of a very heavy meal, I will definitely be making this one again. This would be great on a hot summer day too, but is just fabulous any time of the year!! Thank You Epicurious!!

I love this recipe--great on hot, summer days. I've made it with all different sorbets and with and without the compote--substituting whatever fresh fruit I have on hand. Don't skip the vanilla--it adds a rich, sweet taste that complements the sorbets.

This recipe is absolutely fabulous. Every time I serve it people love it. Some have thought I bought it from a gourmet dessert store. It is elegant and tastes wonderful.

I don't know what I did wrong but the flavors were all off. I used good quality sorbets and ice cream but it just didn't turn out right.

This recipe is very easy and so classy. The flavors of the sorbet can be varied, but keep the vanilla ice cream. I have made this more than once and will make it many more times!

Have made this twice, with great results both times. The first time I substituted Tangarine Sorbet for Mango and it was terrific. Very refreshing. Very easy to prepare. Very pleasing to both the eye and the palate.

Just go to your grocer and look through the expensive pints section. Haagen-Dazs usually has a nice selection of sorbets & gelatos.

FYI - Edy's has all the sorbets listed in this recipe.
