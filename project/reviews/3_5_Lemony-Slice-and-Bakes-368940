My 6 year old and I made these together, and wow they are fantastic! I already have to make more. I'm thinking next time i'll drizzle them with some chocolate instead of the powdered sugar stuff... or maybe half dunk them in chocolate... and maybe make some orange and lime ones too... drizzled with chocolate... ok must stop now i'm getting hungry!

Made recipe exact, except taking tip from other reviews and added extra zest and juice. Won't make again. Dry, no flavor. Family agreed-They went in the bin.

Will become annual Christmas cookie. They are a nice cookie for variety for cookie exchanges and are easy to make. I upped the zest and added lemon extract. I was nervous about too much zest and so I added 3 Tbsp zest and 1/2 teaspoons lemon extract. Next time I will add 4 Tbsp of zest with the extract - it wasn't too much. I added a drop of coloring to the frosting - it then was a pale yellow color - not too bold! I sprinkled with multi-colored large crystal sugar. Sturdy, flavorful and cute!

Add more zest to the dough and lemon juice to the frosting and enjoy a light, delicious, and crispy burst of lemon flavour with every bite.

These were tasty and a hit with everyone who tasted them. I did add extra lemon juice to the frosting and lemon zest to the dough. They were a tad too dry in my opinion, so if you like gooey cookies you might not enjoy these as much. Still good!

We made these exactly as written an thought it was fabulous. They are the perfect balance of lemon with a hint of salt. They have been my favorite cookie recipe this year.

I added more lemon zest and lemon extract in both the dough and the icing to increase the flavor. I think they are just okay. The dough is a little dry for my taste. Don't think I'd make them again.

Everyone enjoyed these cookies! Like others suggested, I used extra lemon zest in the cookies and extra lemon juice in the frosting. Next time I will add even more lemon juice to the frosting. I also had better results using the oven rack in the middle of the oven (not the lower and upper third).

Very easy and lovely lemon flavor. I made these for Christmas and loved how pretty they were decorated with the drizzled lemon icing and multi-colored sugar crystals. I followed others' advice and added more lemon zest and think it was the right idea - love the burst of lemon without it being overwhelming. I'll definitely keep these in my family recipe book.

Thanks for the suggestion to use 1/4 cup lemon zest and 1/2 tsp of lemon extract. This sounds like a lot, but it gives the cookies a clean, assertive lemon flavor.

SO SO good and really easy. Every time I make these for my family they don't last longer than a day.

Thanks to other reviewers - I bumped up the lemon zest and these were a huge hit at my cookie party. They have a wonderful clear lemon taste. I added a drop of yellow coloring to the glaze - it was pretty, but I kind of wish I'd left it white.

Great Holiday Cookie: Won my cookie swap with these, mine came out just like the picture. (sprinkles must go on right after glazing: otherwise won't stick Used the zest from 2 lemons. I did add 1/4 tsp or so of pure lemon extract, which i think they did need. And as another reviewer: i watched these, and made sure i didn't overcook. Lovely little shortbread cookie!

These cookies are great. Everyone loved them. I also thought they needed more lemon, so I added 1/2 tsp lemon extract to the dough and to the icing. Next time I will add more zest to the dough as well. Very easy to make.

Turned out great, and loved the lemony flavor! I'll make again before Christmas! I added 3 tbl spoons of zest to make a little more tangy.

Very good and easy to make! I made log a little smaller, used for a cookie exchange party. I made dough 4 days in advance and kept wrapped in the fridge until I was ready to slice and bake it. Seemed to work out well. I added extra lemon zest and a squirt of juice to the cookies and extra juice in the icing. I baked on an insulated sheet for the minimum amount of time. I found that the cookies didn't look done through the oven door, but when I opened the door a crack I could see they were just slightly brown and took them out right away. I am already planning to make again for Christmas Eve.

My family has decreed these are our new Christmas favorite! I used far more lemon zest (1/4 C, grated with a slightly larger grater)in the dough to amp up the lemon flavor and a bit more lemon juice for the icing and with sanding sugar on them they taste exactly like lemon meringue pie! The other reviewers were spot on about needing more lemon zest. The result is a wonderful lemon flavor and using white and pale yellow sanding sugar made them beautiful as well.

These were quite good and VERY easy to make. As others recommended I used more citrus. Specifically, I used 3 tbs of grated lemon zest and 1/8 tsp orange extract. The cookies turned out flavored just the right amount of lemon and quite delicious. I also based in the oven for 11 minutes which turned out just about right. By the second batch I managed to put two trays in there and flipped tray positions 5 minutes in. It all worked quite well and was a breeze to do for our cookie exchange.

Very easy to make but definitely needs more lemon flavor. I will add a drop of lemon extract to the dough next time. Very nice shortbread-like texture. I can see where this will be easily adapted to any citrus flavor.

The first batch came out overbaked, so for the second batch I did one sheet at a time, middle rack, for 14 min. Still a bit overbaked, but better results. Good, but definitely adjust your baking time. Also I agree with the reviewer who said this recipe should be called "lemon-scented", that is much more accurate. I will definitely make again, with some adjustments.

These are lovely. They have a light, refreshing citrus taste to them. They do not spread out much during cooking so they are smaller in size. I will definitely be making these again.

These were good, but not lemony enough. They should have been called Lemon-Scented Slice-and- Bakes. I used the requested 2 Tablespoons of lemon zest (packed, took 5 large lemons), and it just wasn't up to snuff. I'm going to try them again because they are so easy,( at 60, I've decided to start baking cookies!) but I think I may add 1/8 of a teaspoon of lemon extract. As everyone else said, "Watch your baking time."

Can you omit the lemon for a typical sugar cookie flavor cookie? I dont think I would like lemon or any other fruity flavor Just curious if it will be the same

VERY TENDER. CAREFUL NOT TO OVERBAKE. THEY WILL KEEP COOKING ON BOTTOM OF PAN WHEN REMOVED FROM OVER. I USED TANGERINE JUICE AND ZEST - OUT OF LEMON. VERY NICE BUT NOT AS WHITE AS PICUTRE.

So easy and the perfect little 2- bite cookie. Gone in like 5 minutes when I took a batch to work. Followed recipe exactly, chilled overnight, added silver and gold cupcake sprinkles. Do not let come to room temp. If you do, reduce the baking time (my last batch, which had sat out a bit, turned golden in half the time).
