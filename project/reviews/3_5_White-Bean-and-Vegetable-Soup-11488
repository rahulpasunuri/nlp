I used organic uncured bacon instead of salt pork, no turnips and a few extra potatoes, some shredded cabbage, thyme instead of rosemary, vermouth for the wine, and stirred in 1/4 cup of smart balance at the end. We all loved it!

My husband and I are great fans of dried beans. I am always looking for slow-cooker recipes using dried beans. The flavor was outstanding. Next time I will use smoked sausage. Yum-mo.

This has become one of my favorite soups of all time. It is not as hard to make as it is delicious

This recipe IS really delicious IF you add ham shanks. I rated this recipe very highly earlier and then remembered that I had modified it to include ham shanks. Try it, it really is delicious that way (adds the flavor everyone says is lacking).

Ick. This was so bland. Not even a good veggie flavor, it was just blah. No amount of spice seemed to help- it was as if all of my fresh delicious spices were sucked into a flavor vacuum. This was a big waste of food- we tried a few bites and decided to order a pizza (since i didn't have time to cook dinner all over again.) Don't waste your time.

Although the texture and appearance of this soup was nice, there just was not enough flavor to consider making it again. I even used a rich homemade roasted chicken stock and that could not save the soup either.

This was one of the blandest soups I've made. I couldn't get it to taste like anything, strange, considering the variety of ingrediants. Won't waste my time again.

Overall, a good-n-hearty meal. But for goodness' sake, the potatos need to be incorporated much, MUCH later on, unless you want distracting tiny bits floating throughout the broth. Add the potatos in the last 30 minutes and it should be a real winner.

This is a really great soup that can easily be made vegetarian. I would recommend putting at least a third of it in the blender to make it thicker.

This receipe is just fabulous. I have been making this soup for my family since this issue came out and my copy of the article is splattered and worn. Now that it's on the internet I could abandon the copy but the picture of the dish is so inspiring. Please print the picture if you havn't already.

This recipe sounded perfect for a crisp fall day and it was! Made it pretty much as directed, but used saved bacon grease in combination with olive oil to appease my health conscious son (figured if he couldn't actually see the pork fat bits it would be OK). Because I was in a hurry on this first try, used canned beans also, but I don't think that was a significant change. It was wonderful.

This soup, which is really more of a stew, is a regular in my winter repetoire! I will admit that I do not like turnips, so I increase the amount of potatoes instead. Maybe I'll try some sweet potato next time! In any event, this is a brilliant recipe that never disappoints. One warning -- plan on eating a lot of it -- it cooks up to one mongo vat of soup!

My husband and I both enjoyed this soup immensely. I used canned beans and it was delicious. Quick and easy and the leftovers are great.
