I loved this. Used baby octopus instead of the large tentacles and organic Great Northern dried beans instead of gigantes. Very time consuming but well worth it, next time I want to make just the bean portion and serve it with grilled lamb.

I've eaten octopus before but this was my first venture at cooking it. It was horrible, I ate one bite and threw the rest out. The beans were nice, but wouldn't make them again. I followed the recipe exactly aside from including baby octopus instead of just large tenticles. Bad all around.

The octopus portion was delicious. Having never previously cooked octopus, it was surprising & worth noting how much the 3 lbs of octopus reduces to by the time the recipe is through. Beans were very tasty but required far less than the 2-3 hours specified (more like 1-1.5 in my case), and as a result maybe half to 3/4 of the fluid. A good recipe to play around with next around.

Really liked this octopus. I used baby octopus and just cut into 3 pieces (lopped of the heads and cut the tentacle bases in half) which worked well and presented nicely. I also really enjoyed the flavors in the beans, although I didnt think they complemented the octopus particularly well. Mine came out pretty tomato-y, and I think it really overpowered the flavor of the octopus. If I were to do again, Id possibly omit canned tomatoes entirely, or maybe just use ½ a can or some tomato paste.
