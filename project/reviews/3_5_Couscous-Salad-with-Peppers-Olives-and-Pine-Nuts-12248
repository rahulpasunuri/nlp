Good, easy, and very versatile. I substituted a tablespoon of sesame oil for olive oil, and added a couple of teaspoons of honey to the dressing. I also threw in a grilled chicken breast and a couple of carrots.

I have been making this recipe for years and I love it. It has a very unusual combo of salty, sweet, nutty, and bitter flavors. I leave out the capers because I don't like capers but there are plenty of other flavors to pick up the slack. When I am lazy I use jarred roasted red bell peppers--works fine, but not as good as fresh roasted. Even better the next day, if it lasts that long!

Salty and sweet is one of my favorite combinations. I followed the recipe almost exactly... substituted broth for water (and omitted salt), cut back on the oil, skipped the parsley (didn't have any fresh) and cheated by using a jar of roasted peppers instead of doing them myself. Perfect and a big hit at the party I brought it to. A keeper.

I love this salad and always make it when I have a crowd. It never fails to please. I use the large, Israeli couscous and I toast it first. Otherwise, I follow exactly and it is fabulous!

This is a fantastic recipe. I used currants instead of raisins. I would also decrease the amount of oil used to saute garlic and onions to 1.5 tbsp- two seemed a bit much.

I love this recipe. My kids don't normally like capers or green olives but they really enjoy the mix of flavors in this salad.

I made this for my gourmet dinner group. I loved everything that was in it, unfortunately not everyone was the same. However, I would make it again and omit the items that are disliked by the group.

Very yummy summer dish. I served it with beef kebabs. Personally, I would either use capers OR olives, not both. And next time I will roughly chop the olives. I also used roasted red peppers from a jar but, if you're grilling, you could easily cook them on the grill, then skin them and add them.

Very easy, very yummy. This dish has become a staple in my house. I used roasted bell peppers in oil and didn't add the capers. Next time, I would suggest 1/4c pine nuts. However, great dish that can be eaten as a main course for lunch or a great side dish for many different meals.

This was really good. I made the recipe as is. It was a lot of work for couscous, but the results were colorful and delicious.

I'm with Nancy Brown: I used roasted red and yellow peppers, red onion, and sun dried tomatoes. Very well received at a picnic for the end of school year.

I made this dish for a teachers' luncheon at school. It was a big hit. In place of olives, I used sun-dried tomatoes (in oil), chopped. I used red onion instead of white, and with roasted red and yellow peppers laid on top, it was very colorful and festive. I recommend it highly.

I made this for Easter as a side dish with Salmon. My guests loved it. I am making it again to serve as a salad for a barbeque.

Good side dish for middle eastern menus. Omitted the olives, capers, and red peppers because that combo with raisins sounded...well, yuk. Substituted green onion for white onion and added extra kosher salt, olive oil, vinegar, and parsley to boost the flavor. Worked really well served with Cumin & Corriander Marinated Lamb Kebabs and Moroccan Spiced Roast Vegetables (all recipes from Epicurious).

Easy,tasty and quick, especially if you use ready made roasted peppers. The capers and olives are a must, it must be rather bland without them.

I doubled this recipe for a large group and omitted the olives and capers. It was delicious! For my own taste, I would have liked the accent of the olives and capers, but it was quite good without them.

I love this salad and make it often, omitting the olives. I usually serve it on a bed of mesclun with haricot verts and grilled salmon.

Quick and easy. I left out the olives and added chicken to make it a main dish. My fiance loved it.
