This recipe was really delish. The bread was moist. Dough was pretty sticky, so I added just enough flour to keep it off of my hands when handling it. The flavor was excellent--fresh Rosemary is the way to go! Let the oil, Rosemary, garlic sit several hours to really get the full flavor. I baked on a stone-about 15 inches across--could have gone thinner--middle was about 1 inches thick (but the kids like the real soft part anyway). Took out at 35 min. Perfect!

This was amazing!!!! I baked a portion on a stone pizza plate and the other in a 9" cake pan. The cake pan version was thicker and moister. The one baked on the stone was thinner and crispier. I used fresh rosemary. Wow! This is a keeper : )

Keep potato skins on with fresh local CSA potatos, use the water from cooking potatos, knead in Kitchenaid mixer and get a nice springy dough. Top with chopped fresh garlic, fresh tomatoe and basil, all from the garden! Amazing!

This is a good recipe, though not the best I've had. The key is plenty of good quality olive oil.

Heavy and flavorless??....YOU must have done something wrong...this was so light and tasty...don't use so much flour...have a better feel for the dough..you don't always need all the flour a recipe calls for.

I didn't like this at all. It was heavy and flavorless.

This is absolutely delicious. I made it in 2 9" cake pans instead. It was thicker(my goal), and provided more crust, also my goal. This is just so good! You can't go wrong making it.

I've been making this since 1990, and it never fades. I've also used sauteed red and yellow peppers with herbe de provence and smoked mozzarella in place of the potatoes, and it was equally divine.

I know this will make purists blanche, but I used instant potato buds instead of going to the trouble to cook and mash the potatoes. It worked great (and saved time and trouble) and the focaccia won rave reviews at the party at which it was served.

I eliminated the sliced potatos on top, and used bruised fresh rosemary instead of dry. I left the thinly sliced garlic on top of the foccacia & added thin slices of goat cheese 10 min before it came out of the oven. My husband brought this to work for his lunch with onion soup and everyone at the table was jealous. It is absolutely wonderful!!!!
