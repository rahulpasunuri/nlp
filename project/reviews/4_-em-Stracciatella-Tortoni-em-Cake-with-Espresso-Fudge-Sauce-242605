I made this for my husband for his birthday and it was a huge hit!!! Delicious! I love ice cream and this is a great way to make a it a little bit fancier. Great for entertaining because it looks hard but is easy and can be done ahead.

I made this as a New Year's Eve treat for my wife and myself and we loved it. I see no need to cook the egg whites, and I agree that the vegetable peeler was a pain. I used a mouli grater and good quality chocolate. Will definitely make again.

Excellent make-ahead dessert. I made a few substituitions, still turned out perfect. Made a double recipe in a 10 inch springform pan = 12 servings. Should have made 2 pans - sold out fast!

Did this one last week for a dinner party and it was a hit! I did do the egg-whites at 170 degrees thing because if we ever cook this for clients we can't take the chance someone will get sick and we cannot obtain organic eggs and/or pasturized eggs in our small town. It was very tiring because I don't have a hand mixer so had to whisk a loooong time! I didn't mind shaving the chocolate and use one plastic glove so it doesn't melt all over my "holding" hand. I couldn't get Amaretti (small- town thing again) but used another almond flavored cookie and it was delicious. Next trip to the Twin Cities I will be sure to pick up some Amaretti so I can try it as written, but it was just delicious and I love that it can be done ahead. I agree with another reviewer that you could do smaller pieces, particularly after a very large or heavy meal. The sauce is to die for and I used what remained for other ice cream, but it could also be used for dipping strawberries, bananas, pineapple etc. Thanks for another winner, Gourmet!!

An excellent alternative to Ice Cream. It even won over someone who was "too full for dessert", as if there could be such a thing! I too skipped cooking the whites, and increased the Amaretto to Three Tablespoons. It could easily take more. I also agree with the cook from Mt Washington in that resting is important to improve the texture. I ate a slice too early and it was grainy like ice cream which had melted and refrozen. Be careful not to overcook the espresso fudge sauce.

GREAT DESSERT! I ate 1/3 of the cake by myself and that was prior to the choc sauce, it was soo good. I made the recipe in a 9 inch disposable pie pan. I used 3 tablespoons of Amaretto for the filling. I also chopped chocolate wafer in to little pieces instead of grating and it worked fine. I did not do the "170 degrees meringue mixture bit" -- use fresh organic eggs and no one will get sick. This is a great recipe for entertaining because you can make it the night before since it needs time in the freezer.

We LOVED this. I listened to other reviews and did not do the meringue over the stove, just the regular way. I also got tired of the chocolate and the vegetable peelers (since my chocolate was a bar and not even to use with the peeler) so i grated it very finely on the fine side of the grater. This dessert is beautiful, light and wonderful, and great for a small group. You could cut it a big smaller and serve 8. A DEFINITE keeper!

This was very very good. I made it for Memorial day BBQ and everyone loved it. Peeling the chocolate bar with a veg peeler was a pain, and the whole "170 degrees" bit was ridiculous.. it just needs to look like a proper mirengue -- mine never reached 170, and because the texture is so light, the thermometer reading kept changing. I also noticed that it tasted better after it stood for a few minutes AFTER I cut into slices: the cloudy softness was to-die-for delicious. Enough (without leftovers) for 8 people. And yes, people wanted leftovers! :)

I made this dessert this weekend and everyone loved it. I must say, however, that the instructions to beat the egg whites over simmering water for 7 minutes (until they reach 170 degrees on a thermometer) resulted in curdled, partially cooked whites. I've made meringues dozens and dozens of times and have never cooked them. So, I simply threw out the ruined whites, carefully cleaned the beaters and bowl, and remade the meringue in the traditional way of simply beating the whites with sugar, salt and cream of tartar. I understand beating egg yolks over simmering water to produce a custard or a zablionge, but not whites. I fear someone who is unfamiliar with how a beaten egg white meringue *should* look would fold a curdled or broken/partially cooked mixture into the whipped cream and ruin a somewhat expensive dessert. Other than that, the dessert was wonderfully light and flavorful! I will definitely make it again, and may even substitute a different liquour such as Kahlua and a chocolate wafer/cashew crust. Or even a creme de cacoa with chocolate/pistachio crust.

I cooked this recipe last night for an Italian grill dinner party for 7 people. The Stracciatella Tortoni cake was delicious. I added some sliced toasted almonds and some crumbled amaretti inside to enrich the texture and put a lot more amaretto di saronno (4 tbsp.) In addition I drizzled the espresso fudge sauce on top of the whole cake before serving it. It was a hit! All guest loved it. I will definitely make it again during this summer

This is a thrilling, amazing, incomparable dessert...I've never tasted anything quite like it and my dinner guests oohed and aahed like they had just won the lottery. It takes a bit of effort, but is well worth it. It creates an elegant, memorable ending to any dinner party. I highly recommend it.
