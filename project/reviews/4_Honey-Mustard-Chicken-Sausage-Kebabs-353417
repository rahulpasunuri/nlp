I made this for my family over the summer on the grill. I didn't have mini bell peppers so I just sliced up regular bell peppers. I thought it turned out good, not exceptional, but everyone liked it. My brother, who's never excited about trying anything new, loved it and said it was one of the best meals he's had. Very fast and easy dish.

Excellent excellent excellent!! Easy to prepare, cooks quickly, super healthy & absolutely delicious! Everything was perfect :) The one quirk is when it says to brush the skewers with milk before grilling...not sure they meant MILK, as that isn't called for in the recipe and seems kind of random. I just brushed them with olive oil, then with a little bit of the mustard mixture & it was great. Highly recommended - will definitely be saving this recipe :)

Yum, this is so easy and a great week night meal. Pretty healthy. Served with a green salad, grilled potatoes and fresh August corn on the cob (the only time to eat it in Massachusetts!). It says to brush with milk, I think that's a typo, we used olive oil. Will definitely make again.

I was able to buy the sausages and baby peppers at Trader Joe's.Very easy and flavorful. Agree that the peppers were the best part.

I found a package of baby sweet peppers in red, yellow and orange. I only had a tiny bit of dijon left so mixed that with gulden zesty honey mustard and added in a little wasabi for more kick. the peppers were the big winner hands down. They grilled nicely and the entire dish tasted wonderful.

It was delicious and easy. I also added brown rice to make it a little more heavy. I didn't brush the bell peppers (I used regular bell peppers as well, the supermarket didn't have baby ones) with milk, but they turned out delicious anyways! Also, it took a little less than 10 minutes to prep everything.

This was fantastic! I used regular bell peppers (red) because I couldn't find baby bells, otherwise I made exactly as written. Well, I did cook them on a foil-wrapped baking sheet in the broiler since I don't have a grill. It was very easy to throw together on a weeknight and the flavors complimented each other perfectly. Served over brown rice for a more hearty meal, but I could see it with a green salad for something lighter. The boyfriend loved it too and I will definitely add this to my rotation.
