Have made twice now and altered the recipe a bit the second time. I doubled the amount of marinade to make it more "saucy", it was a bit dry as written (esp when served with rice), except I only used 1 tbsp of oil (I used sesame oil) to limit the calories, and that was plenty. I also added ginger when sauteing the garlic and vegetables, as well as a TINY amount of chili flakes. I didn't have celery and didn't miss it (I used a green pepper as well as red and yellow). I also got away with only using one pan - I marinaded the beef in a bowl; sauteed the garlic, ginger, red onion & chili flakes, then added the beef and marinade, then added the vegetables and sesame seeds. Easy.

Not bad but bland. I added ginger and more soy sauce but it still didn't have enough kick for my taste. If I did it again I'd probably marinate longer and add a ton of ginger and maybe even red pepper flakes.

I thought it was very good. I used low sodium lite soy sauce. I added 1/2 lb of sliced mushrooms too & served it with additional soy sauce and mango chutney. The flavor was rich and satisfying.

Needs more kick. Ginger and hotness of some kind.

Loved this recipe!!! I used Europe's Best Zen Garden veggies to save time chopping. The marinade/sauce was delicious. The only change I made was to add sesame oil. Will definitely make again. Great for a quick, healthy meal!

I found this surprisingly tasty. The sesame seeds acted as a thickener, in the absence of cornstarch. I did add some minced ginger. And, since it's the start of the new year, and I'm atoning for all my holiday gluttony by going on a strict low-carb regime, I ate it with cauliflower fried "rice," which was also quite a bit better than expected.

This recipe could be great with a few tweaks. I used a rib eye instead of sirloin but I would add grated ginger and substitute zucchini for one of the bell peppers.

I agree with the other reviewers, bland and as written not worth making again.

I too took the suggestions and added fresh grated giner and a few drops of sesame oil to the marinade. Also marinated the beef for about 3 1/3 hours. To the stir fry I added broccoli florets & crimini mushrooms and omited the celery. The flavor was outstanding!

We loved it! Disclaimer, I followed the suggestions: marinating overnight, adding to the marinade some sesame oil and on a whim some freshly chopped ginger. I ended up cooking the steak first in the marinade, then removed the steak so it wouldn't overcook and cooked the veggies in the sauce - onions and garlic first, and then the rest. Included celery AND broccoli. I'll definitely make this again in the same manner. Used boneless sirloin if anyone cares, it was outstanding!

I thought this was a nice, easy to prepare dish. It was bit bland, but I added a bit of oyster sauce (rather than salt & pepper) and red pepper flakes at the end to boost the flavor, and it was quite good.

This recipe was bland to say the least. Certainly other things could have been added, but then why bother with the recipe at all? My thrown together beef stir fry that I make with no recipe at all is loads better than this dish. I won't make this again.

I used sesame oil for the marinade, and I left it overnight in the fridge. I thought it had a very nice (but not overpowering) flavor.

This was a bland dish. I made it a while ago but I remember that I added some Thai chili sauce which really helped the flavors. It was good after that.

Very good and easy to make. I served it over basmati rice which was good. I added a can of bamboo shoots and a can of sliced water chestnuts and a few handfulls of frozen broccoli and glugged in some extra soy sauce to make sure there was enough liquid. I doubled the recipe and the leftovers were delicous. I only put in half of the sesame seeds since it sounded like too much. Make sure you cut the beef in small thin strips so not too chewy. I marinated the beef about 4 hours, try not to overcook the beef like I did.

I think my cut of beef must have been sub-par, because it was chewy. Other than that, the dish was bland. I would add some red pepper and serve over rice to make this better. And the amount of sesame seeds was overwhelming. I would cut the amount in 1/2.

This recipe was terribly bland. The meat was tough and the stir fry sauce left a great deal to be desired. tasted mostly of salt. very disappointing.

Rating: 3
The marinade makes the flavor of the beef wonderful, but the success of the recipe depends on the quality of the meat. Because the marinating time is so short, a good cut of beef is essential or the meat will be tough.

Next time I will add some red pepper to give it more zing.

The marinade is absolutely delicious. Put more vegetables in than what was recommended.

This was a very tasty dish that's easy to make after a long day at work!
