I made this as directed and have to say I did not enjoy it and will not make it again. Way too much acid for the amount of honey. I doubled the honey and the sauce was still to acidic and watery.

I only had thighs (with skin & bone) on hand, so I amended the cooking time by keeping my fingers crossed and hoping for the best. The sauce really kicked up my potatoes, which I mashed with butter and a mexican cheese blend. This was super easy, and as someone who has been accused of "cooking like a scientist", it made my night and my guests very pleased. This will be added to my rotation.

I loved this recipe; what you choose to serve it with along with the quality of Sherry- Vinegar and the correct reduction can put this over the top. I decided to use O Sherry-Vinegar from the O Olive Oil Company and I made sure to reduce it to 1/2 Cup. I served it with Basmati rice cooked in chicken broth and Sugar Snap Peas as my vegetable.

We've made this twice now and think it's a fantastic dish made exactly as directed. The crisp skin is delicious - don't be shy with the salt and pepper at the prep stage. My only wish would be that the sauce be more creamy and less thin.

Great chicken dish. I've made it a few times, and its an easy weeknight meal that is gourmet. This last time I ran out of sherry vinegar and subbed 1/2 white wine vinegar and 1/2 balsamic and it worked great. I also had to use skinless breasts and although it would have been better with the skin for the crispiness, it was still a great dish. The sauce goes well with mashed potatoes or couscous.

Be sure to use Sherry Vinegar... don't substitute!

I had some misgivings due to previous reviews, so I took the suggestion of adding two tablespoons of honey as opposed to two teaspoons. The result was just the right mix of tart and sweet. I'm not an accomplished cook so I was surprised by how much the sauce smoked. My dog kept barking at the smoke detector and I panicked a little. The smell also permeated the house in a not good way. Crack the windows while you're cooking and keep the vent fan on. I served with mashed potatoes to soak up the extra sauce, and threw the chicken under the broiler for a few minutes to crisp the skin up even more. Yum.

Great recipe. Everyone loved it, easy to make. It would be great with mashed potatoes to soak up all that great sauce.

Great Recipe

I didn't have sherry vinegar and substituted a mixture of white vinegar and cooking (dry) sherry, which worked well. I used chicken thighs rather than chicken breasts (because that's what I had); if you do this you need to reduce the broiling time.

I can't help but think that the amount of honey listed in the recipe is a mistake. To balance the acidity of the vinegar, I added 2 tablespoons (not teaspoons). Then as a matter of personal preference I increased the chicken broth to 1/2 cup. Even with the better balanced sauce, and even though I like how all the ingredients are every day kitchen staples, I can't help but think that this sauce would be better suited towards something gamier like duck or venison.

Followed recipe exactly, and wasn't disappointed. A good quality sherry vinegar is essential. The sauce was delicious with the chicken as well as with the mashed potatoes we served with it.

Having read the reviews, I knew they were mixed, but gave it a try anyway. I figured how bad could it be? This recipe was truly awful. I made it exactly as written (I even found the sherry vingegar at my supermarket!). If you like the idea of pouring vinegar over your baked chicken breast and eating it that way, be my guest. I found it atrocious.

This is delicious. As a single person, I made the dish with one breast half but prepared the entire sauce recipe. The next night I just prepared the other breast half, and the sauce was already made. No need to halve the sauce recipe for two servings. (TIP: serve with sauteed broccoli rabe for a delicious fall meal.)

I followed the recipe with the exception of reducing the butter by 1/2 at the end and thought is was delicious and would definately make it again. The sauce was very tangy and flaverful. Also, it was simple which is a bonus for a Sunday night dinner.

I go to Marshall's where I buy all sorts of vinegars and infused oils.

There are a thousand other chicken recipes on this site, and I'd try just about every one before I made this dish again. It was edible, but nothing special. The garlic was overwhelming, and the honey didn't add the sweet balance to the savory elements of the recipe that I had anticipated.

Bev-I too had to go to 3 stores to find sherry vinegar, and I live in the land of upscale stores. When I found it was $7 a bottle, I passed. Anyway, we loved the dish but I made a few changes. Instead of sherry vinegar I used white wine vinegar and a generous glug of sherry. I also coated the chicken with flour (boneless and skinless by the way). My husband did add a sprinkling of Wondra flour to thicken a little at the end. Would make again in a heartbeat (but I won't rate the recipe since I changed it).

You can find sherry vinegar on-line at La Tienda.com

To the Chicago reader who couldn't find Sherry Vinegar: Green City Market. Any high-end grocery carries sherry vinegar, so you might want to scout around a little more. I have no trouble finding it in Toledo, Ohio, so I can't imagine that Chicago wouldn't have it!

I would love to try this recipe; however, I have tried many stores and cannot find sherry vinegar. Any suggestions?

Delicious and super easy. I coated the chicken in flour before putting it in the pan. I decided to splurge and buy the sherry vinegar and glad I did because I'll make this again.
