It was just "good," I thought it was too sweet, and the complexities of the spices didn't have a chance with the natural sweetness of the squash and the added sugar. Also, it rose...and then fell, I just don't think squash can be made to rise and hold like a normal souffle. A bit disappointing, but was worth trying for an interesting side dish made in ramekins.

I loved this dish. I am a squash lover so that certainly helped in my appreciation but the flavor was a nice combination of the earthy sweetness of the squash, the subtle creaminess of the cheese, the sweetness of the nutmeg and the spice of the cayenne. I used freshly baked hubbard squash that I pureed until very smooth and then drained through cheesecloth. This may have helped some but the souffle was still a little too moist. I am going to cook it again using the far drier Kabocha variety. Also, I used a fine shredder to grate the cheese so it was very uniformly distributed through the mixture and helped to hold the air whipped into the whites. Based on the suggestions of the other commentators, I only used 1/3rd a teaspoon of dried nutmeg and that seemed to work fine. I found the cayenne to be tasty but a little on the hot side so I am going to use a little less when I make the dish for my parents.

Awful! My husband sort of liked it!

Fabulous recipe! I oven roasted a butternut squash and used cotswold cheese instead of swiss. This cheese has onion and chive in it and added lots of flavor. It was as delicious when I served it the next day.

I am planning to try this recipe with my own squash puree. Is this 12 ounces of puree by weight or volume? Does anyone know?

I loved this dish. Used baked flesh from a Kabocha squash, a very sweet variety. Next time I will drain the flesh with a cloth in a sieve to get the excess water out - it took a long time to fully set and there was some water in the bottom of the dish during serving. I used provolone cheese and vegetable broth instead of milk (might have had something to do with the wateriness?). The flavor is wonderful for squash lovers. Is good cold out of the tupperware later in the day, also.

This was amazing. I used the puree I had leftover from another recipe (kabocha squash cooked in milk and a bit of vanilla) and it worked out very well. I also didn't have any swiss so I used the cheap colby-jack that I had onhand and it was still heavenly. My husband said it tasted a bit like a pie. It was a perfect compliment to a dinner of ribs and salad. Easy, too.

I cut a Hubbard squash in half, removed seeds, placed it in 1/2" of water and microwaved it, cut sides down for 18mins, scooped out and pureed the fruit in a food processor. I used nutmeg from a jar at the recommended 3/4 teaspoon. Since I'm high altitude, I baked at 435. Apart from that, I cooked the dish exactly as written and it came out fantastically!

I really liked this dish but it does need some modifications if you don't have fresh nutmeg. I didn't have any fresh and I went a little overboard with the bottled nutmeg so make sure to cut back, like another review mentioned, to 1/3 tsp of bottled. Other than that, it was really good and not too cheesy but I love cheese plus I did use a milder Swiss to the balance things out and it was great. I will be making this dish again!

we really liked this! I used fresh squash, and i think it would've been good to strain it b/c the souffle let off a bit of water. It didn't hurt the taste. next time i would cut the sugar just a little. Also, i paid attention to the other reviewers and went easy on the cheese -- but then i wanted a little bit more cheese! overall, we really liked it!

I made this as a vegetarian main and was disappointed. It didn't rise much--maybe because it doesn't call for many eggs?--and the squash really weighed it down and made the texture too gooey and not light enough. But, it probably is healthier than the cheese souffles that I usually make.

This was a great side dish for pork chops. I didn't have fresh nutmeg so I used 1/3 t. bottled nutmeg. It worked out great.

LOVE this!! I would rate it 4 forks, but I agree that it's a little too cheesy for my taste; I did, however, use a very strong swiss, so that could be why. I brought this dish to a Thanksgiving dinner and it was the hit of the table! Everybody raved about it. Do be aware that it will start falling if you don't serve it immediately... (still tastes great, though!) Next time I'll use a milder swiss to make it a little less heavy.

It was ok, but still a little too "cheesey" for my taste. The flavor of the squash did not come through. Must be served immediatey or else it will deflate... So plan accordingly.
