i've made this for years, but with a different green-a little cilantro. it creates a different taste that i like better than the watercress.

definitely do the grilled roast beef with stilton instead---much better for the same type of tastes :)

This was OK, especially since you can't go wrong with good French bread. However, I would recommend the Grilled Roastbeef with Stilton sandwich hands down over this. The watercress really added nothing and was a pain to work with.

this is great for leftover roast beef,flank steak or prime rib...but I added tomato slices instead of the greens and broiled it under the broiler in the oven until the cheese melted and bread was heated....I've also tried this with feta cheese, but whatever your favorite cheese is may work! yum! {also broil this "open-faced" under broiler}
