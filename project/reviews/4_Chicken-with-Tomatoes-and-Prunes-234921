This recipe came out delicious, but I did change a few things. I used chicken pieces instead of cutting up a whole chicken (laziness), and I added fresh thyme and bay leaves when I added the wine. I didn't use any sugar because the prunes made the sauce a little sweet without sugar. I also threw in some carrots. It was great and the leftovers were great too. I served the chicken and sauce over olive oil mashed potatoes, which was a great match.

The blurb is right, amazingly complex for so few ingredients. I used prune plums because we have a tree, and bone-in thighs. I also used the Alice Waters method of putting the skillet uncovered in the oven with the skin above the liquid to finish the cooking with crispy skin.

This recipe is surprisingly good!I served it for dinner with the neighbors, and even the kids liked it. I made a few alterations; I salted the chicken a few hours before cooking and used canned instead of fresh tomatoes. I also used half the vinegar and sugar as it was fairly tart already from the wine. I found whole prunes a bit large - next time I'll cut them in half or quarter them and use a few less.

I thought this was very good. Be aware the sauce is sweet. We used boneless chicken breasts and I adjusted the recipe a we bit to compensate. I used 4 breasts, sustituted a can of fire-roasted tomatoes for the plum tomatoes, used a dash of cinnamon when I realized my neighbor had borrowed my last stick. I also reduced the prunes to 10 as 16 seemed overkill for 4 breasts. To use boneless chicken, I simply browned it as instructed, but did not add it back in for the wine reduction process. Once reduced, I added back in the breast and simmered for 10 minutes instead of 20. I then removed the chicken during the prune simmering process to make sure it didn't get overcooked. Served it all over rice.

Great recipe! I used canned tomatoes like I had read in an other review - tasted great. The chicken was so moist and tender that it almost melted in our mouths. A definite must-eat!

Who says "wow" to chicken? You do, after making this dish. The blend of flavours is very interesting. I understand how others say Moroccan, but it doesn't have ginger, cumin, tumeric, saffron, paprika, or other usual Moroccan suspects. But anyway, this is a great dish. Made with bone-in thighs and breasts, which worked fine, and I didn't need to do two batches as a result. Out of fear and after reviewing others' reviews, I added some roux at the end but I'm not sure I needed it. Fantastic dish.

Just made this last night, so good! I used boneless, skin on chicken breasts (from a local poultry butcher). I did not remove chicken while reducing and simmering sauce, I thought the chicken absorbed the flavors nicely. I used 3lbs. Of chicken, which was 10 breasts and two cans of fire roasted diced tomatoes. I also added more prunes and used the sugar, I thought it balanced the salt nicely. I might consider capers next time, but this was so delicious as it was, that no improvements are necessary. I served it with the Moroccan spiced vegetables from this site as well. Cannot wait for leftovers today!

It really does have a nice complex flavor and easy to make and get right. The right tomatoes is key! It's winter time and I used fresh tomatoes so the flavor was a little dull compared to using canned tomatoes. Best to use fresh tomatoes when it's actually tomato season.

I used bone in chicken breasts, a 14 oz can of drained roma tomatoes and put it all into a casserole dish after the wine reduction step. Baked it for an hour at 350 degrees. For the last 12 minutes or so I baked it uncovered and added a flour/water paste for some thickening. Even with these shortcuts it was delicious.

Really awesome recipe. I will definitely make this again. I used a whole chicken and skinned it (just too much fat), and deboned the breasts, leaving the bones on the other pieces (which ended up being pointless as the chicken was so tender it came off the bone very easily). I decided on a Viogner, on a whim, and it turned out wonderfully, and paired really well with the meal. Having read the other reviews, I upped the initial cook time to 30, plus the additional 10 with the prunes. By that point the chicken was so tender we ate with our hands.I served it with some fresh baked bread - a must to sop up the sauce - and some rapini.One of the best things I've made from Epicurious, no doubt.

This was delicious. Made a day ahead and reheated in a pot. I doubled the recipe using on cut up chicken and one package of 9-10 chicken thighs. Took the skin off. Drained the pan after browning the chicken - too much fat and liquid in the pan. I used plum tomatoes, but you could easily substitute a can of drained diced tomatoes. YUM!

I made this for a dinner party last night, exactly as described except I used bone-in chicken breasts only, cut in quarters. Made it ahead and it reheated perfectly. The flavors were hearty and complex--I reduced the sauce quite a bit at the end and thus did not need to thicken it with corn starch. I agree that the butter could be reduced, and perhaps olive oil substituted for some or all. I used fresh Roma tomatoes but I think a good quality canned tomato product like Muir Glen could be used. All-in-all, a great fall/winter entree. I served it with roasted fall vegetables and will make it again.

This was really delicious, albeit sweet. The acidity of the tomatoes marries nicely with the prunes. I agree with the previous reviewer that there are hints of Moroccan flavors. Although I was nervous that this dish would be too sweet, it turned out well. Good to serve with bitter greens for balance. Bravo.

This was good and had a very unique flavor. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of substituting 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon intead of a cinnamon stick since I had no sticks on hand. I thickened the sauce a bit with corn starch and served over rice. This reminded me of Morrocan flavors. My husband didn't like it as much as I did.

What a pleasant surprise this was. If I had simply read the list of ingredients, I would not have thought to make this dish - but the positive reviews led me to give it a try since I had the ingredients on hand. My husband and I both loved it and my kids, who prefer plain food, happily ate the chicken without sauce. I found the sauce too thin, as others had mentioned, so I thickened it with a bit of cornstarch.

A definite keeper. I didn't have cinnamon sticks so I used 1/2 tsp. good quality cinnamon. I added a pinch of saffron and used canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh. Next time I'll discard the chicken fat and use honey instead of sugar. I served it with Israeli Couscous.

This recipe is excellent. I also have converted it to a crock pot recipe substituting the wine and water with a cup of quality chicken stock, adding an onion (and somtimes chorizo sausage) and always using a 28 oz. can of San Marzano whole tomatoes, chopped. Also, in the interest of time, eliminating vinegar,sugar and cinnamon and it is equally good.

Very good. The Roma tomatoes in the grocery store were hard and green tinged, so I drained canned tomatoes and chopped them. I would definitely use less butter next time. I made ahead of time and reheated for 1 hour in a 350 degree oven as one reviewer had suggested. One hour was too much, the chicken was very well done by then. Also, by the time I took it out the fat had separated from the sauce and it was quite greasy. Still, I loved the combination of the sweet prunes and the acidity of the tomatoes.

This was really really good, I didnt have Roma tomatoes so I used some diced tomatoes I had available still great. Just to let everyone know when you thicken the sauce it will only get slightly thickened so don't be alarmed

The flavors in this dish are exceptionally simple yet perfectly harmonious. Salt, sweet, and spice come together with color and texture to put this dish over the top. If you can get over the fact that your grandmother eats prunes for an all together different reason, this dish is a winner. If my kitchen was a favorite neighborhood restaurant (...which it is) this would be one of those favorite dishes that you order over and over again in spite of other worthy choices.

Very good but not worth 4 stars. It's quite sweet, even though I used less than half the sugar. I cooked the prunes 30 minutes instead of 10 to soften them up. In short, good and quick but nothing earth shattering.

i made this dish for a dinner party of 35 people. the day before i made the dish (doubling the sauce for each batch of chicken),placed all of the chicken in a large roasting pan & refrigerated it until the party. covering the dish with foil, baked in a 350 oven for about an hour to reheat. easy to make & it got wonderful reviews.

Perfect for a weekday dinner. my family devoured it, including a picky carnivore (husband), two preschoolers and a toddler. had fabulous flavor, was quick and easy. skinned chix first and served over brown rice for a nutritious, yummy dinner. i suspect it will be even better the next day.

I didn't substitute anything, and the dish came out delicious. Lovely balance of tangy and sweet, and so easy to make! We served it with couscous, as well as glazed carrots (someone else mentioned carrots and it sounded like a nice match - it was). My husband liked it so much he requested it the next night!

Delicious over egg noodles with a side of carrots. Halved the amount of chicken but made full amount of sauce, so had enough to coat noodles.

I was suspicious that the prunes and tomatoes would not work well together, but just as my worries were not necessary with the fantastic Brisket with Aromatic spices on this website, the chicken was perfect. Flavorful, sweet from the prunes with a hint of exotic from the cinnamon stick....
