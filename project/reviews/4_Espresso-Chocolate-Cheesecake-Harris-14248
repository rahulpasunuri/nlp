This is excellent. I served it slightly warm in the center with whipped cream topping. It is dense and delicious. Everyone loved it, even a guest who normally does not care for cheesecake.

It's in the oven as I type, I must say I'm excited, it smells lovely! I agree about the order of mixing, I used my standard method and the texture turned out fine. I'll review again once it finishes baking.

I accidentally followed the recipe as written and it still turned out o.k. although the batter was chunky, as others had mentioned. I will definitely try it again with beating sugar+cream cheese together first, then adding eggs later. For those of you who are skeptical that this is the right order to do things, read *any* other cheesecake recipe on this site, they all add eggs last and with scarce blending. This is one of the denser cheesecakes on epicurious, it has a really rich/thick taste and the batter barely pours. Be sure to heavily foil the outside so that the crust doesn't get wet. Remove the foil before you chill the cheesecake so that it doesn't retain water. 1.5 lbs cream cheese is 3 8-ounce packages.

I used this recipe to make mini-cheesecakes, and that might explain the problem I had, which was that the two layers seemed to blend together somewhat and didn't taste very distinct. In fact, I could barely taste the chocolate at all. Also, I thought that the whipped cream added to the preparation time without really adding much to the finished product. I think I will stick to my other cheesecake recipes (which have the added advantage of listing the instructions in the right order!).

My husband and I both really liked this cheesecake. He said it was the best cheesecake he's ever had. I was a little annoyed at myself because I started the cooking having forgotten the top layer! But..in the end I spooned the espresso whipped cream (without the cream cheese mixture) over it and it added nicely as a cold topping. I also used raspberries as a garnish. Any berry or berry sauce would complement nicely. I am looking forward to trying it again with both layers. I did adjust the recipe to make it more healthy and this did not compromise our enjoyment. Instead of 4 large eggs, I used 2 medium and 1 pkg. (12.3 oz.) Silken Firm tofu. I cut back the amount and type of cream cheese to 2 pkgs. (16oz.) Neufachel cheese (a lighter version of cream cheese.) And finally, I made 2 other substitutions: I bought ready made Oreo crust and since I could not find the espresso powder, I used 1 tbs. concentrated liquid coffee: Victorian House Mocha Java. Boy was this decadent, even with the healthy substitutions and my assemblage error!

A very rich dense style cheesecake. Very impressive presentation. Made it for an Oscar party, no one payed any attention to the awards when this was served.

Wow! A lot of work but worth it. For the first time in a long time I had the blender, the Cuisanart & the Kitchen Aid all going on one dessert! I couldn't find instant espresso powder so I used International Delights coffee powder...it turned out yummy! Also, I used Trader Joe's Chocolate Low Fat Cats for the crust instead of chocolate wafers. My only complaint is that it cracked in the last 10 minutes of baking. What did I do wrong?

This was my dessert for New Year's dinner last night, and I followed the recipe exactly, except for adding more chocolate wafers to the crust, and beating the sugar and cream cheese first, then adding the eggs. It's a mistake to follow the order as written. I also placed a pan of water on the lower oven rack below the cheesecake, instead of using the direct water bath. Even with a high-end Kaiser springform pan and heavy-duty foil, there is always leakage to the crust. I watched through the oven window in astonishment as this started rising like a souffle, puffing high above the rim. It did settle down during cooling, as expected. I decorate the top with just additional grated chocolate. Quite delicious and rich, and loaded with caffeine- a sliver was just enough after dinner. Would have been nice with fresh raspberries for contrast. I don't think I'll be repeating this one, as I prefer a more traditional cheesecake filling with interesting touches, such as the Chocolate Orange Cheesecake with tangerine marmalade topping.

I made this for Christmas day and it was indeed delicious but I wish I'd followed the advice of those cooks who say to add the eggs after combining the cream cheese because I did indeed end up with lumps despite using very soft cheese. I will certainly do the ingredients in the 'tradditional' order next time and there will be a next time because it was a hit - gorgeous! It was certainly a labor-intensive dish to make but the result was (lumps and all!) wonderful. I also think it would be excellent with a regular, non-chocolate crumb base. Re: the cook who had a problem with water leakage - I have encountered this in the past and the I think only answer is to get a very good quality springform pan - Williams Sonoma do an excellent one but its over $40 - Crate & Barrel do a very good one for about $22 - and treat it VERY well to avoid warping etc.

The mixing of the cheeses should definitely be done in the more traditional way - sugar and cheese mixed in, then eggs! That is the reason the cheesecake is lumpy; in fact many cookbooks say that as soon as you add the eggs, any lumps that are in the cheese will remain. You could really beat the mixture thoroughly, but that incorporates a lot of air and leads to a souffle-like rise that would crack the cake. Even with a water bath, mine ended up cracking.

This was delicious in spite of me forgetting to add the heavy cream (which I did whip early on and returned to the frig to keep chilled.) I added chopped hazelnuts to a graham crust which was delicious! My only other problem was that the foil liner didn't hold up and the edges of the crust seemed soggy. Any suggestions on this?

I made this recipe the month it came out in Gourmet. I've made it repeatedly since then as this is this is by far one of the most requested desserts by my friends and neighbors. It does take time and it is well worth it! In response to comments about lumpy cream cheese by others...if you use Phila Brand and it is soft, the recipe comes out fine. If the cheese is not completely soft, microwave each 8 oz for about 25 sec. The lumps will go away and you can follow the recipe as it is listed.

I made this cheesecake for Easter and it was a big hit! I made the fatal mistake of cooking too late at night so had a few mishaps due to fatigue; my cream cheese was too cold and I ended up with small lumps throughout the finished cake. AND, I realized 5 minutes into the baking that I had forgotten the sour cream! I scooped off the top layer, carefully stirred the sour cream into the bottom layer, replaced the top and continued baking. Now, if a cake can withstand all of that and still get rave reviews from family...it's a great cheesecake!

The order of beating the ingredients seemed odd to me. (Most cheesecake recipes call for beating the cream cheese and sugar, then adding the eggs one by one.) Regardless, I followed the recipe and the cream cheese did not fully incorporate into the batter. The cheesecake tasted fine, but the batter was lumpy and I ended up with tiny bits of cream cheese bits in the finished product. Will definitely remake in usual cheesecake order.

This has become my standard show-off dessert, everyone loves this. I couldn't find the chocolate wafers, so I tried the crust once with chocolate Nilla wafers, and once with Chocolate Teddy Grahams - the Teddy Grahams were much better.

I rated this a 3 instead of a 4 only because of time and preparation involved in this. Whew ! Otherwise, this is an elegant, impressive and heavenly-tasting cake. I would have to wait for a special occassion before I would want to go through the time and effort it took to make this again, though.

I was concerned when I made this cake. The crust proportions seemed off to me. Too wet. I called Gourmet Magazine and asked about it. They returned my call and verified that the recipe is correct. They also informed me that chocolate wafers refers to "Nabisco Chocolate Wafers" in the long thin box. I took it to a party and everyone loved it. It was so delicous and decadent! Not heavy but very rich!!! Definitely thumbs up!!!

Scrumptous! The cheesecake is as great as the chocolate and coffee you put in--use Valhrona or other high quality chocolate, and freshly ground espresso beans. This and the triple layer carrot cake (also featured on this site) are mainstays of my New Year's eve table!!!!!!!

The first word out of anyones mouth when I served this was from my sister, "How decadent!" Great recipe that was a perfect ending to a family Easter meal. The only item I changed was the garnish. Instead of garnishing with chocolate curls, I sliced some very fresh and deep red Florida strawberries to serve on top of each slice. We put away the scale for a few days to prevent guilt over eating this incredible dessert.

Because of the added air due to the whipped cream, this cheesecake seemed to rise more than others. I would suggest spitting this receipe into two smaller pans. Otherwise, the taste was great!
