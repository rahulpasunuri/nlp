This is a good recipe that I've made many times, but you MUST use chicken broth instead of plain water. A nice way to introduce people to a vegetable they may not otherwise have tried before. And with that, I recommend doing the puree first, then adding the mix back to the pan before adding the milk, bring it back up to temp w/o boiling it. And of course, S&P to taste!

I found this soup to be flat and lacking in flavor. I followed the recipe. Perhaps if I had read the reviews first, I might have used broth. But it needs something else to add zip. Maybe a spice such as nutmeg? I won't make it again.

I served this to my book club the other night and everyone loved it. To give it a bit more zing as other reviewers requested, I topped it with fresh nutmeg and grated X-sharp white Vermont cheddar cheese. That seemed to take it to another level. I opted for using water but cut it back to 2.5 cups plus .5 cup of apple cider.

Definitely must use chicken stock for water, but can thin with a little water when necessary. A real treat for parsnip lovers. I thought it was great served cold and so refreshing with our 104 degree heat yesterday.

Mild and sweet; I substituted chicken broth for the water and was short one leek, and I felt that it needed something more to enrich the flavor. I'm inclined to experiment with other parsnip soup recipes, having tasted a delicious parsnip and roasted almond soup in a Swedish restaurant recently.

This soup was very well received when I served it to guests. I did use chicken broth instead of water, and I did not add any sugar as the parsnips were naturally sweet enough.

I agree with a previous reviewer - it needed somthing more. It was sillky smooth and had a pleasantly sweet tinge to it. I served it at a family dinner and everyone loved the texture and the subtleness of the parsnips.

Not as tasty as I would have liked. It's missing something - perhaps a more flavorful broth to add depth.

Very nice and easy!

Very good. Try using mild paprika instead of pepper....and as an alternative garnish, you can take very thin slices of parsnip with a potato-peeler an deep-fry them for a few seconds.
