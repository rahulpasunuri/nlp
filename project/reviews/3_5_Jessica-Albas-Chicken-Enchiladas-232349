This is a flavorful enchilada dish. I've made it several times and have changed things slightly each time. I don't use cheese because of an allergy and it's still very good. I also used a roasted tomato salsa which kicks up the flavor.

This is a great recipe! I frequently buy a rotisserie chicken from the grocery to save a step. I also find I need more sauce then the recipe calls fro. I bake it for about 30 minutes covered, then remove the cover and back about 10 more minutes or until the cheese melts.

This was so simple and so delicious! If you read the ingredients on the enchilada sauce bottles, you can find red and green ones that are healthy and all natural. Makes great leftovers too! I left out the olives and would do that next time too.

This is the worst enchilada recipe I have ever tried in my life. It's way too much work for something so incredibly mediocre. I was looking for a "quick" new enchilada recipe and was horribly disappointed. Going back to onion, garlic, bell pepper, canned tomato sauce from scratch, with black bean and sauteed chicken thighs for the filling.

My family and friends love this recipe!! Quick and easy!! This is our number one go to enchilada night!

This is good, though it definitely doesn't taste as rich as regular enchilada recipes. It's a great diet recipe, but I wouldn't serve it if I were having guests over.

Have tried other enchilada recipes and this one is the best. The key is cooking the chicken with jalapenos first - adds an extra layer of flavor.

This is my go to enchilada recipe. It's easy and fast and it taste amazing! The only thing I don't add is the olives but other than that I follow the recipe exactly.

This is super easy, with a few changes, it tastes great. I don't boil my chicken, I cover it in a saute pan with olive oil, garlic, cayenne pepper, cumin, chili powder and s&p. This gives the shredded chicken more flavor. I also use Trader Joes salsa in the chicken mix and added sauteed peppers and onions to the filling. Green enchilada sauce and mexican blend cheese on top. So very good.

This dish was really easy and very tasty. I modified it by adding jalapenos into to sauce. I also added organic back beans and organic fire-roasted 356 brand salsa. This dish is amazing!

Great enchiladas, I have made these a couple of times and both time I made a large batch lasagne style with layers of tortilla and added beans. I left the salsa out and hot sauce out and even the kids loved it. Will make again, easy and great for a large group.

Great recipe - real crowd pleaser with tasty leftovers! I used two bottles of Trader Joe's enchilada sauce and used TJ's corn salsa (without tomatoes). I also added a can of chilis in adobo sauce. I will definitely make this one again!

very good. my husband and I loved it. I used green chiles instead of olives. fantastic!

Great recipe!! However, the amount of chicken specified made two recipes, not just one. I certainly couldn't figure out how to cram that much chicken into such a small tortilla (nice to have additional chicken though) also used the prepackaged Mexican cheese. Great flavor and easy!!

I never really follow any recipe to the exact, I always add my own touches. This one was so simple that only thing I added was a small onion to the stock. I also saved 2 cups of the stock to cook some rice to serve with it. Both turned out awesome. One thing I def gonna add next time is some refried beans to the mix somehow. I also topped it off with a dollop of Daisy.

Try wrapping the tortillas in aluminum foil and tossing in a 350F oven for 10 minutes. Better than frying, better than microwaving.

These enchiladas have become a staple meal in my recipe box (my head) But I made several changes to the recipe. I use only the traditional sauce by doubling what the recipe calls for. I also skip the whole "no fat" "low fat" the recipe calls for and goes for the traditional. I also just buy the grocery store "Mexican or taco" cheese mix instead of the several different types of cheese. I suggest adding lots of hot sauce, be sure to include the jalapeno, and some extra cheese on the top for some browning :) Other than those simple changes, great recipe

My boyfriend and I loved these enchiladas. It was my first attempt -- they were very easy and yummy. I left out the olives too. Served with refried beans covered with a little cheese and lime on the side. Would definitely make them again.

Used as the basis for a very easy recipe and my husband says we'll never eat out for Mexican again. Also left out the olives and used a little cheese on top. I also used white corn instead of yellow corn tortillas.

I'm only giving this one fork because Epicurious says that one fork = "okay." And this was okay. So it's not haute cuisine, but it's an easy enough recipe and I would make it again. I agree with the reviewer who suggested only adding the cheese on top toward the end of baking. It seemed to me like there was a lot of enchilada sauce. Maybe only half the suggested amount would be adequate.

i loved this recipe. I did alter it slightly (no olives, didnt use lowfat cheese) and it was delicious. I do just have to say that it wasn't quite as easy as some other users were saying. I will definitely make it again, but I might try out using already cooked chicken.

My husband and I loved this dish. I used a little salsa in with the enchilada sauce, omitted the olives (he doesn't like them) and used a Mexican cheese blend from the supermarket. He said, "save this recipe!"

Trying this tonight... In reference to the microwaved tortillas, another enchilada recipe has this method as well. I'd assume it's a healthier way than frying to get softened tortillas. (They recommended placing a damp paper towel on the tortillas before microwaving.)

Microwave the tortilas???? You got to be kidding. Like she really makes this recipe anyway. Heat the sauce and dip the tortillas is how its done. Unless of course you like rubbery tortills.

This recipe is so delicious and very easy to make. I don't like olives so I substitute 1/2 of a 7 oz. can of chopped green chiles (mild or hot -- the hot gives it quite a kick!). On another note: does anyone know a good brand of corn tortillas to buy that don't break easily? thx!

This is an awesome recipe. esp. when your in a crunch for time. It can be made ahead. I used left over turkey, and added 2 oz of cream cheese to the meat mixture. It is even better with homemade enchilada sauce. But for the convience canned is good too

I made the recipe for boyfriend and 8-year old son. They both loved it! Adjustments: Used bone-in breasts and extra garlic cloves. Added 1 can of chopped green chilis to enchilada sauce. Extra cilantro too because we love it. Excellent!

I tried this recipe tonight, and my husband and I enjoyed it. Few changes - baked the chicken with seasoning to give it plenty of flavor, and used 2 cans of traditional red enchilada sauce since hubby doesn't like green enchilada sauce. Also, he brought home fresh parsley instead of cilantro so I used that for the fresh herb. The dish turned out well. It is very simple to make so it's a good recipe for beginning cooks wanting to impress Mom and Dad or friends. It's also good for a simple family dinner.

I just made this dish tonight-this turned out delish! I did make my own salsa, and I used a bit more cheese. Also, I found that even without using all 4 chicken breasts, I still had a lot leftover. I used a large can of green chile sauce, and a small can of red. I also used assorted peppers from my garden. Very good!

I made this recipe and even my ultra finicky 16 month old loved it. He ate a whole enchilada by himself. I am of Mexican descent and while I do agree that it is not extremely authentic It was yummy. I put it in our dinner rotation and it is always a hit.

I made this for a party and got rave reviews. I did add a small amount of sour cream to the chicken and I think I will also add some additional chopped garlic and seeded jalapeno to the chicken next time as I feel I did not get enough of the flavor simply from boiling. A definate keeper.

This recipe was super easy-made it as written and it was very good considering how easy it was. My family enjoyed it, and would like me to make it again, so it is a winner in my book.

I thought this was terrific; better than a creamier version I usually make. I used left-over roast chicken and spiced it up quite a bit with cayenne and Tobasco and omitted the olives (per my fiance's request). Easy and delicious.

I doctored these up a lot, so I guess it isnt fair for me to rate this recipie. Lets be honest - using low fat cheese and not a lot of it is not going to make a delicious enchilada. This recipe is a good starting point, if you modify, however modifications are not going to be healthy if you want to make it taste good.

Don't be put off by the snooty reviews below. I grew up in Texas eating Mexican food at least once a week, and this recipe for enchiladas is as good as the local Tex-Mex restaurants in the trendy part of town that were always packed with people. This recipe is easy and tasty, and while it's not a gourmet meal, it's not meant to be. I'm making a batch tonight for an easy dinner when my mom arrives from out of town tomorrow. I make it just as it's written, except I don't use low-fat cheese. I recommend Old El Paso enchilada sauce, or a higher-end organic brand if you shop at Whole Foods. Add a tossed salad, some chips and guacamole, and you're all set!

Nobody should be surprised at the outcome of this recipe. Canned enchilada sauce? Oh please. Jessica Alba clearly has a long way to go in the kitchen before she should be considered worthy to have her name tied to a recipe here. Beauty and youth do not make you a good cook.

This recipe is best cooked with two people, as many of the steps can be multi tasked for a faster prep time. It will feed A LOT of people so it's completely worth all the steps. It's easy to substitute also if there is another kind of cheese, olive, sauce, etc that you prefer. And, it's delicious!

Wonderful and so easy. I made this for some friends and everyone loved it. I had some extra chicken/cheese mixture, and it was great leftovers for soft tacos - and would probably be great on nachos too.

Totally delicious and warm on a winter's night! The only change to the recipe was buying the Mexican cheese blend rather than combining the cheeses myself.

Absolutely delicious!! We used non-fat cheddar in the enchiladas and they still tasted great. We also spooned some of the enchilada sauce into the chicken mixture in place of some of the salsa. Great, quick, and easy dish!

We really loved this recipe. My 8 year old daughter helped me make it. One tip if you are serving it to children, the red enchilada sauce was spicy you may want to use tomato sauce instead. I also added corn to the filling.

Made this last night for my husband and myself. Absolutely wonderful. We ate all but one enchilada between the two of us. I used Frank's Red Hot for the cayenne sauce and used this great cheap Mexican hot sauce. Next time I will probably sprinkle the excess cheese on top for only the last 5 minutes, since it browned a little too much for my taste.

I thought this dish was very good. I was unable to find green enchilada sauce so I substituted salsa verde. It was delicious! It was spicier than I expected but I suspect it was the salsa verde and none of the ingredients that were originally called for. I didn't add any cayenne or hot sauce.

I have made these now a number of times and they are absolutely scrumptious! I use a creamy green chile sauce for extra spunk...

My husband and I both loved this. I sauteed some onions and green and red peppers that I added with the chicken, and as recommended didn't bother with any of the added "heat." I used a can of "medium" red enchilada sauce along with the mild green, and it was plenty hot without the tabasco or jalepeno. Just taste the sauce first when you heat it and decide if you want to add tabasco. Easy and delicious. My husband said I needed to add this to our rotation!

I loved this recipe! It was really easy to make, and REALLY good! I'm not a big fan of spicy food, so I omitted the Mexican Hot Sauce, Cayenne Pepper and also the jalapeno. I found that with the remaining spicy ingredients, it was just enough spice to really give it a kick, but not so much that you're uncomfortable, and downing every glass of liquid you can find. :) The only downside to this recipe is that it is quite calorie laden, which is hard for someone who might be trying to cut back. Perhaps one could use whole-wheat tortillas and add more veggies like onions, greed and/or red peppers, mushrooms, or whatever suits your liking. All in all, this is one of my new favorites!
