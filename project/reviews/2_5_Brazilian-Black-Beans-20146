Here's an idea -- let's call this dish "Outrageously Delicious Black Beans of No Particular National or Ethnic Origin." I think the ratings will then be a lot higher.

This is not how Brazilian beans are made. Here is how I make them. Get 1 package dried beans black (or brown) soak them in water for 1-4 hours. They will absorb it so you may need to add more. Chop one onion. Crush 6-8 cloves of garlic. Finely chop 3 tablespoons of cilantro and 2 green onions. Sautee onions, cilantro, green onions and garlic in 1/4 cup of olive oil for about 5 minutes. Add 1tsp of oregano, 2-3 bayleaves and 1/2 tsp cumin. Then add beans and cover with water. After that I usally add about 1 TBSP salt and cook for at least one hour. It is best if you have a pressure cooker, it usually makes the beans more tender. I usally add more salt at the end to taste. You can also put meat in like chorico, linguica our salt pork. I would usually do that at the same time I add the beans. You can also add other vegetables like tomatoes or pepper, I would do that when I am sauteeing the other vegetables.

I just want to make a quick comment, this is not a typical (or at all) Brazilian recipe. The idea of adding cumin, cardamom, sherry, orange and serving this with sour cream makes no sense in that context, this is not a Brazilian flavor combination.

This is the best bean recipe I have ever tasted! I was surprised at how low it was rated overall in the review. But I see that the main criticism isn't of the dish itself but that apparently it is not authentic by the standards of Brazilian cuisine because of the ingredients that actually give it the unique and amazing flavor. Maybe if we just take "Brazilian" out of the name everyone will be happy.

We start with drained/rinsed canned black beans, and let them simmer in broth for a bit. Absolutely use crumbled chorizo for this (there is no substitute!), and save a smidge of the fat runoff for the veggie sauté. I use yellow onion (for antioxidant properties), Red Bell Pepper (because I hate green), and twice the garlic, because That Is How I Roll. I double the spice amounts, because I cook like I'm running the light show for a hair metal band. I drop an orange peel into the bean pot along with a can of ro-tel, and keep adding orange juice until I like the taste/texture. Your house will smell amazing. You should open your windows and make folks jealous.

I find it hard to believe that this recipe was intented to be feijoada. Actually, not even plain black beans are cooked this way in Brazil. Cumin, cardamom, orange juice and Sherry?! My guess is that the author took one too many caipirinhas before she wrote this. :-)

I am Brazilian and I assure the readers that this is not a true/real Brazilian recipe.You would come closer to the real recipe if the cumin,cardamon and the sherry are not included in it.

As a Brazilian I can tell you that it would be a cold day in Hell before any self respecting Brazilian cook would serve this. You're better off scraping the soles of your shoes and serving that on a dirty platter. That's just my opinion...

I'm no Brazilian, but it tasted good to me, even without any of the proper meats, all of which are unavailable here in Japan. Can't wait to try a real Feijoda.

Being a Brazilian living away from home I was looking for a good recipe... unfortunately this one is not authentic at all. Brazilians use a lot more meat (mainly cured pork), and add only salt and pepper to the dish. The side dish should be spicy. Too bad...Fortunately there are other recipes available. It's worth it to look for them under 'Feijoada'.

for an authenic feijoada completea(the name of the black bean dish) a bit of linguica,sliced pork and sweet potato needs to be added. to be true to form you'll want to find a recipe for farofa..the toasted manioc flour that brasilenos spinkle on everything. you'll want to serve fluffy white rice and sauteed collard greens on the side.

Try using Chorizo or fennel sausage to make it more authentic!
