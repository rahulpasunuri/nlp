Simple and good. The grocery store only had enormous eggplants, so I substituted some cherry tomatoes and a red onion; as the other reviewer said, you can substitute other veggies easily. I am too lazy to skewer kebabs, so I just used a grill basket. I cooked the pasta in broth/ water, and it tasted good with the dressing.

Excellent. A great way to eat a variety of veggies. I strongly disagree with the cook who criticizes reviewing our own revisions of recipes, as we have a great deal to learn from one another. This was the first time I cooked with Japanese eggplants, and their addition was my only complaint about this recipe. I disliked the flavor and next time will leave them out. I too made my own vinaigrette, tho I lacked confidence as to what amounts of the various ingredients to add -- used 4 T. of olive oil, same of balsamic, 2 T. lemon juice, and generously sprinkled oregano. I added 2 T. water and several pressed cloves of garlic to the mix. The marinade turned out beautifully. I added lots of variety to the vegetable mix as well, including pieces of green pepper, yellow squash, red onion, and shitake mushroom. I'd include all next time around. I also cut up excellent quality lamb chops and used the pieces very sparingly (as they were expensive) on the kabobs. Forgot to add marinade to the orzo, since I made it along with the kabobs, which already had soaked in the marinade, but didn't miss it a bit. The orzo was fine with some sprinkled pepper; feta added just the right amount of salt, so no extra sodium chloride (is that what we called it back in high school?) was necessary. Enjoy!

Very good. Did not have mint or a bottle style vinaigrette so made a vinaigrette with olive oil, balsamic vinegar, lemon and oregano. Also marinated the vegetables in advance. Vegetables were very flavorful. Defintely a keeper.

Yum. Very easy and delicious. I marinated the veggies in a storebought lemon herb dressing, and grilled some shrimp as well. My husband loved it.

Love it! Definitely not bland once the feta is added. I made my own viniagrette from juice of one lemon, olive oil, one clove of garlic and some dried oregano. And I took the advice of others and marinated the veges first. Lots of veges - good healthly meal!

Loved this dish! Marinated some chicken breasts in the dressing also and tossed it on the grill. Doubled the orzo since there was such a large amount of veggies.

Orzo was bland. I added lemon juice the next day to leftovers and that really helped. Also, I would have marinated vegetables rather than just brushing. That said, very simple and went well with salmon on the grill. Amy
