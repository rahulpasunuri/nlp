A person had said they had a problem shucking the oysters. A simple solution is to not shuck them at all and let the oven do it for you. When baking oysters if you leave them in their shells the shell will open on its own after 3-5 mins. Enjoy!

I looked at a lot of recipes for this and finally settled on this one. Loved it, but found the bacon a bit overpowering. I think I would still include it but perhaps use a bit less.

Perfect Oysters Rockefeller. Have made this recipe many times with great results.

I made this for my lovely wife a couple days before her birthday, and it was exceptional. We did, however, have trouble shucking the oysters, my wife thinks, because I had them on ice and they were really, really cold. Any suggestions out there?

Used Kumamoto oysters and served with champagne - everyone wished there were more than two per person but with the beef tenderloin on the way, they were glad they stopped. Made no modifications, but if you are using larger oysters, easily you would have to double the filling - I barely had enough to make it stretch.
