Well, I suppose you can give this recipie the name "Green Goddess", but this is not Green Goddess dressing...It is not even similar.

Made this recipe and hated it. Not sure where or what I could have done wrong, but it was not good at all.

I substituted the mayo & yogurt with tofu and EV olive oil (1/4 cup each) and 2 T fresh lemon juice- very good results! No one could tell the difference and it was a hit! Served it on a bed of mixed chopped veggies(colorful bell peppers, cabbages, corn and lettuce mix)

This recipe was fantastic! I served it for a party with a crudite' of fresh veggies. For presentation, I surrounded the dip with cauliflower and then alternated colorful veggies around that. It was a hit! Several people asked me for the recipe. It had a perfect blend ("bouquet") of flavors to compliment the veggies.

As I was lacking watercress, but flush with a spring planting of arugula, I substituted with rewarding results. I also might have used a fennel-dill mix since these are hard to distinguish in the garden at an early stage and I was using ingredients at hand. Plan to use this on fresh garden lettuce salads with goat cheese and hard-boiled eggs for my lunch this week

This is a great basic recipe for Green Goddess, but I always use creme fraiche (use it instead of yogurt or sour cream) and the payoff is huge.

I served it with mixed baby greens, asparagus, poached salmon, hard boiled egg wedges. It was so yummy. Um....

Simply delicious. I made it for a veggie crudite and did half mayo, half sour cream. Would be great with cold poached salmon in the summer time.

Fresh and yummy. I had it on a salad and also have used alongside roasted potatoes.

I've used this as a dressing and dip. Both are wonderful with veggies. For a dip, substitute 1/2 cp mayo and 1/2 cp sour cream for the yogurt and mayo in the recipe. This makes it thick enough to use with a veggie tray.

I made this dressing to be used as a "dipping" sauce for a full course fondue. It was excellent on the filet mignon, the shrimp, the mushroom caps and all the other veggies. Would I make it again?....You betcha!....It was EXCELLENT and my company was very impressed!

Wow! This is a delicious dressing that is so versatile it can be used on anything from tomato to seafood. I feel lucky to have found it.

such a fresh, new way to top salads and fish. i even made baked "tortilla chips" from pitta bread to dip. i felt healthy eating it! the mint gives it a middle eastern flavour.
