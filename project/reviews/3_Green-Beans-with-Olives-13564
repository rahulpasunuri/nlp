I made this for a dinner party. It thought it would be a little different, but didn't expect too much. Substituted olive oil for butter. Everyone loved it.

Instead of butter I used olive oil and sauteed some minced shallot, then tossed green beans, olives and lemon juice into the saute pan. Served with filet of sole and roasted red potatoes...delicious!

I expected a bit more from this recipe. The olives got lost within the green beans. It will do well for the family, but I don't think I will use it for guests
