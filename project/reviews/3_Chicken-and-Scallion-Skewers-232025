Pretty bland, even after four hours marinating in the mirin sauce. I served with stir-fried veggies and brown rice and had to pour on the hoisin sauce to give it some flavor. I prefer the recipe for Soy-Glazed Chicken Skewers with Scallions, also on Epicurious.

I've made this a couple of times for potluck cocktail parties: it's very tasty, good for advance prep and last minute broiling, and great finger food. It always disappears quickly and people rave. I like it better when it's marinated for 12-24 hours (in response to the question from A Cook from HK): the flavor is much better and it browns better, too. I put it under the broiler for 3 minute, brush again with sauce and broil another two; then flip and repeat on the other side.

Got a question, I followed this recipe religiously and because I only brushed on the sauce right before grilling, the chicken meat didn't have enough time to absorb the flavour in the sauce. Do other ppl have the same problem? I will make this again but next time I will marinate the meat before grilling. Tips: After grilling the skewers, I used a torch (those sold for making creme brulee) to sear the skewers. The end result was very crispy chicken skin with juicy meat.

Got a question, I followed the recipe religiously and only brushed on the sauce before grilling. But the end result was the chicken meat didn't have enough time to absorb the sauce and thus tasted quite bland. I will marinate the meat beforehand next time as I still think this is a good dish, but want to see if others have the same problem? Tips: After grilling, I also used the torch (for making creme brulee) to sear the skewer for couple seconds to get the crunchy skins and crispy meat.
