Very simple and so flavorful! Roast chicken is probably my most favorite thing to eat and I have my very favorite recipe (Thomas Keller's Favorite Simple Roast Chicken on this site) that I cook over and over again. I was looking for another roast chicken recipe that is a little different, and this fit the bill. I used an Asiago sourdough bread from a local bakery and made my own Za'atar, just buying the ground sumac at the spice store. The result was absolutely delicious. The stuffing makes a great side dish and although I won't say that the chicken was the moistest I've ever had, it's far from being dry. The stuffing is really yummy and it's fun to become acquainted with a new spice mixture. I would definitely make this again!
