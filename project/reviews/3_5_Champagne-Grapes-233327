Perhaps the people who didn't enjoy this recipe, haven't tried it with ACTUAL CHAMPAGNE GRAPES! They come into season around mid August and in the fall. They are very tiny purple grapes, seedless, and deliciously sweet. How about making a fine Almond Cake, or a Genoise, and placing these marinated grapes on top of it? Buy these grapes--they are worth paying the extra cost.

so easy to make. always make for parties, usually a day ahead. sometimes use the lemon zest, sometimes don't. i always use regular sugar, and it turns out fine. agree with the reviewer who suggested using a good sparkling wine. can totally get one under $15.

This is SO easy to make. I've made it numerous times and each time, guests ALWAYS ask for the recipe.

There was a bit of champagne flavor in the first bite, but other than that, they tasted like regular grapes. Most of my guests didn't touch them.

These were good, not great. I agree with an earlier reviewer -- I couldn't taste the champagne that distinctly. Perhaps they should be macerated for a much longer period of time. But, they were sweet and somewhat delightful.

Not worth the effort. After marinating the grapes all day in champagne, I really couldn't taste the difference. Besides, red seedless grapes taste great by themselves- why add to them? My guests voted by hardly touching them.

Holy smokes, these were good. Not to mention easy! I'm not a fan of champagne, etc., but I loved these grapes. They were a big hit at our New Year's party, and I'll definitely make them again!

Very easy and delicious. Be sure to use a quality Sparkling Wine of Champagne - there are many under $15. I will omit the sugar next time as the grapes were plenty sweet without it. A hit at the party and a delicious fridge snack too.
