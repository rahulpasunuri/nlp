A lot of work, but the results are well worth it, especially for special meals! Homemade stock makes this recipe much richer, and the blend of woody wild mushrooms, saffron & curry (if you can, get fresh spices from Pensey's - the quality is first rate) create marvelous depth of flavor which, when combined with the mixed texture of the pureed and sauteed mushrooms (I left out the confetti and opted for a bit more sauteed mushrooms) gives you a dish your guests will devour now and remember later!

This soup was a wonderful first course for Thanksgiving but pretty pricey since it calls for 15 ounces of wild mushrooms AND saffron threads. I didn't make the stock from scratch and it turned out superb. I thought the confetti was a nice addition that added color and texture. My husband loved the little bit of heat the curry (I used more than the recipe called for)gave it.

I found the soup very enjoyable. I also found it ironic that I found this in a cook book designed for quick/easy to prepare recipes even though everyone is complaining about the time it takes. I used canned chicken broth and found it to be very tasty. Next time I will skip the vegetable confetti since in my opinion it added very little to the soup.

Made the stock from scratch, followed all the instructions...ended up with ok tasting soup, nothing special for the amount of time involved

This is the 1st recipe I've used off this site which was excellent! I "cheated" and used prepared stock, therefore no leeks in the veg mixture. I used chanterelles for the wild mushrooms and cremini for the white. Even our 11 yr old daughter wanted seconds.

I had hoped this recipe would be as good as one I enjoyed in a restaurant in New York that closed a few years ago. While this one is good, and very rich, it failed to hit the mark for me. I would make it again, but only until I find a recipe that comes closer to what I am seeking. I did not use the turnip, and I substituted dried mushrooms for part of the recipe and used fresh wild mushrooms for the other half. I found this to be a very time-consuming soup to make.

DELICIOUS! Easier than it looks, especially if you use prepared broth (watch the salt). I agree with another review which hailed the complexity. The saffron and curry really add to the taste. I used dried mushrooms and cooked them in the broth while I sauteed the fresh mushrooms.You might add cream if you want to give it that bisque like flavour.

This turned out really well, which surprised me because in the middle of making it, I tasted the soup and it was a little bland. I added a tiny bit of wine to the broth in an early stage. Also, I sauteed the wild mushrooms used as garnish with a little Madeira at the end, which added a little depth of flavor. In the end, this tasted great! My guests loved it.

Tremendous "depth" of flavor and texture! If you shortcut the stock, use a rich, flavorful one!
