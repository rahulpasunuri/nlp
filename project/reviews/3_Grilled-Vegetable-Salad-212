I didn't like this. Tasted too much of balsamic vinegar, and was a lot of work to prepare.

A definite keeper, even for my finicky partner. This was part of a late dinner last night (my second time making it) and we completely forgot about the chicken I had grilled and didn't even miss it, which is really surprising for us. Very simple but very full flavor. The basil in the dressing does something wonderful with the grilled veggies. I do have some trouble with the eggplant, though, which I rarely cook. The skins are so tough I end up ripping or cutting out the soft flesh. It's delicious, but not pretty. Any tips about this would be great.

Yum! This is easy and great and works well with any grilled meat. It serves 6-8, though. I think it would be a main course for 4 people.
