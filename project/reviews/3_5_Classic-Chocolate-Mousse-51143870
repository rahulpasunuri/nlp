Excellent recipe. Followed the instructions exactly, and the mousse was fantastic! I didn't add additional whipped cream to serve it - it was rich enough without. I'll definitely make this again if I want to impress guests!

Why the negative reviews? It's v simple ingredient, pretty easy steps, and turns out AWESOME!! I am craving it now as I am writing this review. I am not a big chocolate dessert person, but I consider this as the perfect dessert. I followed the recipe exactly, and I do agree that it seems so thick and cluey after adding the chocolate, but after I added the egg white and whipped cream, it got fluffy. Be patient, it will turn out amazing!

I made this today following the recipe very closely. It had good flavor but it was very heavy, VERY heavy and thick. No air at all or light texture. Any thoughts about how to make it better?

Fabulous! Don't pay any attention to the reviews posted by "A Cook". This was a delicious mousse recipe and don't forget the whipped cream for a little extra decadence!

This is very tasty, but I was afraid half-way through the recipe it wasn't going to come together. My egg-yolk concoction thickened and doubled, but only got to around 105 degrees before I pulled it off the double boiler as it was starting to cook too much. The next hang up was trying to whisk the chocolate -- the mixture was a thick sludge, so I shifted to a spatula, which worked a lot better (I also had to return the bowl to the heat to melt the remaining chocolate). Once the egg whites and whipped cream went in, the sludge finally turned into a mousse. It tastes great, but mine ended up being somewhat heavy for a mousse. I'll have to try it again and see if I get different results.

This was a wonderful recipe, too bad there was so much "operator error" on my part! While I'm a pretty good cook, I never was much of a dessert person and don't really make many, so for me to attempt this was a little out of my comfort zone to say the least! I also took several minutes to get the yolks up to temp and had trouble with the melted chocolate..by the time the egg yolks were ready, the chocolate had cooled and I had to reheat but still wound up with large chunks of it in the finished product. Not as pretty as I would have liked, but didn't stop us from enjoying it!

Was out of espresso, used Kahlua instead, very good, could also use Baileys or Grand Marinier. I just wished i had doubled this as there were no leftovers. Easy and Elegant.

Made as prescribed. Outstanding flavor. Rich and decadent. One note: you should have an understanding of the cooking properties of eggs (both yolks and whites) as well as chocolate. If so it will be perfect.

I haven't made this, although it sounds good. But I have made many times Julia Childs' wonderful, VERY chocolatey mousse, from the second volume of MASTERING THE ART OF FRENCH COOKING (She calls it "Le Saint-Cyr, glace.). It has no egg yolks, only whites, whipped to a meringue, and they are cooked by adding hot sugar syrup to them, so there is no problem with raw eggs. The chocolate is melted and added to the meringue, and then cooled, and then the whipped cream is added. Much lighter than most choc mousses, but the taste is anything but light. For the reviewer who does not want to use coffee, you could add some orange liqueur for flavoring, which is a lovely and sophisticated addition to chocolate.

Easy to make, I have never made mousse. I will put mixture through a sieve to get out cooked egg helping make it smoother next time I make this. Fun, Fluffy, Perfect for a simple or fancy dessert. Put it in one big bowl for people to serve themselves or in your favorite dessert bowls for individual servings. Definitely is the answer to your chocolate craving.

Nothing classic about this chocolate mousse. Try 1 oz of dark Belgian chocolate (45% cocoa)and 1 egg per person; melt chocolate on bainmarie, cool slightly, add egg yolks, then egg whites beaten to a stiff peak. Put it in the fridge for 6 hours. There you have it, the classic chocolate mousse and the best one ever!

Flavor is good for sure. I used Trader Joes Dark Choc. 54% and it was not too sweet. Have to say hardest thing was whisking egg yolks over simmering water. After a few minutes (NOT 1 min as recipe states) egg mixture was at 120 degrees. I stopped there for fear of curdling eggs. Since you use raw egg whites anyway, why go there? Had to put mixture back over hot water to melt all chocolate though - no flame. I will look for easier recipe. Also like adding creme fraische to whip cream for added tang.

This is a fabulous chocolate mousse, especially for coffee lovers. The consistency was exactly as pictured-- light, airy, and creamy. It was lovely served in crystal glasses with a dollop of whipped cream. I will definitely make this again.
