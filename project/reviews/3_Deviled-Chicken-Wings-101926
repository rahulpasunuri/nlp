This dish was a big hit at the superbowl party I attended. I made a low-carb version by using only parmigiano cheese, no bread crumbs. I skipped the spice mill bit by using 2 t. Colman's mustard. I omitted the salt based on another reviewer's admonition, but I disagree that the mustard was overpowering. In fact, I served a mustard dipping sauce on the side, which also went over well.

Didn't care for this at all. Found the mustard taste overwhelming. The Dijon, plus the salt, plus the Parmesan made the wings taste too salty as well. I baked the wings on a rack and found the coating on the top cooked golden brown and crunchy, while the bottom was soggy. If they could be flipped without losing the coating, maybe they wouldn't be so soggy.

I tripled this recipe, made it a day ahead of time and reheated - Everyone loved it. I also cooked the wings a little longer (due to quantity).

The perfect picnic food, if you can hold yourself back from eating them all right out of the oven! The coating stays on well, and we usually have them with corn bread and baked beans. Do try this one!

Served this dish at a party and everyone loved it. A little different twist on chicken wings.

I doubled the coating recipe and used chicken thighs. I also used half whole grain mustard and half dijon so I didn't have to grind mustard seeds. Nice and spicey -- a welcome change.
