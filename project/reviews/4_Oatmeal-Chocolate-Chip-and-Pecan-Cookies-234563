This one's a keeper! Katy Sparks really knows her way with flavors, so this is no exception. I used clementines for the zest since that was on hand, and I also threw in a dash of fiori di sicilia, the King Arthur Flour Company "secret ingredient" that's a mix of vanilla and orange flavors and really punches up any vanilla-flavored recipe. Besides, orange and pecans go together just as much as chocolate and pecan do, so the myriad flavors in the mouth just really sang. And they stayed soft and chewy! A real winner when it comes to cookies in my book.

This is a cookie that is a best ever. The pecans give it the crunch, the orange is a perfect foil for the chocolate. I cut back on the sugar and used bitter sweet cacao which were not as sweet as regular bittersweet chocolate chips. Raves, Raves, Raves from everyone that ate them.

Reduce both sugars by 1/4 C each and the Hersheys Special Dark chocolate chips to a scant 6 Oz. Used rolled oats for quick cook oats. Baked at 325 for 11 minutes. Results were excellant. All or the ingredients were identifiable and worked together well. Will make this many more times.

Tastes pretty good. The cookies were very flat though, but maybe because I used Gluten Free flour.

I appreciated all of the reviews, and as a result, reduced the amount of sugar, pecans & zest. I also used bittersweet chocolate. Have to say they turned out mediocre. Probably won't make them again, since I would have to add back a lot of sugar to get a better taste. I liked their complexity, however.

I made these on impulse and didnt have any pecans, but I used walnuts and thought they were awesome! I could see how some might say that they were too sweet, but I like my cookies really sweet, so it wasnt a problem. I also made a batch without any nuts and I def decided that the nuts are mandatory! So much better!

I'm not a huge cinnamon fan, so I left out the spices, and these were still great. The orange zest adds a nice touch. I like the ratio of oatmeal to flour better than in some other cookies I've tried. I'll make these again for sure.

Excellent cookies. I made them with old-fashioned oats and with only 1 cup of pecans. And Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate chips rather than Nestles. Freshly ground cloves and nutmeg probably didn't hurt either!

this is my go-to recipe for cookies, and has been for a couple of years! it is simply excellent! the orange zest is the secret ingredient that truly makes it...

This is one of the best chocolate chip cookie recipes I have made. I modified the recipe by using only 3/4 cup of light brown sugar, 1 cup of whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup of wheat germ and double the spices and vanilla. Also, half way through the baking process I used a spoon to flatten the cookie dough. They were perfect, chewy in the center a slightly crunchy on the outside.

Rating: 3
Delicious recipe but too sweet. I cut the regular sugar down to 1/2 cup. Next time I will cut the brown sugar down too. I will also try it with orange zest next time since its tartness should help balance the sweetness and spice. Baked for 13-15 minutes, not 10-12.

This cookie was great! My mother and I could not stop eating the cookie dough. However once to the actual cookie.... lets just it wasn't as great. Nothing can beat that salty and sweet flavor. Didn't have actual oranges but substituted with 2 teaspoons of orange extract instead of zest. Turned out well.

These cookies have nice flavor, but they came out really crunchy when what I really wanted was a chewy cookie. I tried baking them for less time and they still came out the same. The only change I made to the recipe was using all white sugar and no brown (I was out), so that may be why. I would try it again though.

Today was my second attempt with this recipe, but the cookie is still way too sweet for me, even after I cut the sugar to 1/2 c and the brown sugar to 3/4 c; used bittersweet chocolate instead of semisweet, reduced the chips to 1 c.; and increased the oats to 1 1/2 c (I also added a Tbsp. of water right after the eggs so the excess oats wouldn't dry out). Not sure what else to modify, I was ready to give the recipe up, but I see that more recent reviewers have tried doubling the spices. I'll give this one more shot, as I love the concept of the cookie. Maybe I'll also try walnuts instead of pecans, although I like to pair this with a chocolate-raisin-walnut cookie from Maida Heatter.

This recipe is great except that it calls for too many chips. By the end, when I use 12 ounces, I make chip balls instead of cookies. Try 1 cup of chips, and it should be perfect.

These are yummy - I substituted dried cranberries for the cherries, used a bit less chocolate, and added a small amount of chopped hazelnuts. Will definitely make again.

These cookies came out allright, but didn't have any wow factor for me, just a good chocolate chip cookie with a little undercurrent of spice. Could be because I ran out of fresh nutmeg and used already ground. I also used lemon zest instead of the orange and that may have made a difference. OK, but I probably won't make them again.

Rating: 4
I love this cookie recipe. I do make a couple of changes, but the recipe is great as is. But! I think it's even better if you toast the pecans before chopping, and add 1 cup chopped dried cranberries. You can also get away with cutting the sugar back to 1/2 cup without altering the flavor. I get requests for this recipe all the time.

These cookies are great! I doubled most of the spice measurements---I like to taste everything in a recipe--and I was very pleasantly surprised how much those flavors came through. It was an excellent combination of chocolate chip oatmeal cookies with spice nut cookies. One of my friends said they tasted like Christmas! Next time I will add more nuts and try to reduce the sugar; these are very sweet, despite the spices and oatmeal.

Absolutely wonderful! I am not a fan of orange zest and cloves so I left both of those out. Also cut down the cooking time to take them out when they were just beginning to brown @ 13 minutes. As long as you let them cool down they are crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside. Perfect cookies!

Rating: 4
These are delicious! I didn't have any oranges on hand, so I left out the orange peel, and I also omitted the cinnamon and cloves because I thought the nutmeg alone would add a nice subtle spice. I did add about 2 tbsp. of smooth peanut butter when I creamed the butter and sugar together. I live at altitude (about 5200 feet), and I baked them in a 365 degree oven for about 13 to 14 minutes. They were perfect -- crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside. I had to tell my husband to stop eating them before dinner! 2 cups of pecans seemed like a lot, but they're essential to the flavor and texture of the cookies. Yum!

Super good! I omitted the orange peel, and used 1 cup pecans and 1 cup of walnuts. This recipe yielded 5 dozen cookies, rather than the 3 dozen it states. Very chewy and delicious.

this is one tasty cookie. My only complaint is that mine came out more crunchy than chewy. Even the batch I undercooked came out crunchy. I just dipped a few in my coffee this morning for breakfast, so problem solved with a tasty solution. Also, I added 1/2 cup dried cranberries, which gave a nice tart/chewy bite to the cookies.

These are yummy! I've made these twice, once with the orange and once without. I just made them today without the orange, added a cup of craisins, reduced the pecans to one cup, added a heaping cup of oats, and reduced the white sugar to a scant half cup. The orange is pretty strong, so omit it if you're not a fan. I think it's alright, but better without. Oh, and I had to bake the cookies for about 15 min. I like that they're chewy and chunky. :D

Very good cookie. Easy to make. I found the orange peel a bit overpowering. I will cut that down by half next time. They should have been named orange chocolate chip cookies. Nevertheless, easy, yummy, and a keeper for my recipe box.

This is my new go-to chocolate chip recipe. These cookies are amazing. I had never made oatmeal c.c.c. before and wondered if I'd like them or if they would taste too "healthy" (a fate worse than death) -- well, I loved them! The oatmeal adds a great chewiness to the cookie. Next time I would use bittersweet chocolate chips as I think the cookie is sweet enough.

Fantastic cookies! A pretty invincible recipe (even for a novice baking aficionado like me) - whatever combination of oats, nuts, or sugar you choose seems to work out. I added an extra 1/4 cup of oats, only had 1/2 cup of pecans on hand, and the cookies STILL came out tender and subtly complex. I'll definitely make this again!

Excellent cookies. I didn't have the cloves or nutmeg, but they were fine without those spices. The orange zest added an extra zing. Don't overcook them -- they are best a little underdone. If you wait until they are browned, they seem a little dry. We will definitely make these again!

OMG - these were SO good! I love baking and very rarely rate recipes but felt compelled to review this one. I used mixed nuts from the bulk bins (almond, brazil, macadamia, and pecan) and roasted them before chopping and adding to the batter. I also added an extra half cup of oatmeal. These really were amazing. The orange was very subtle as were the spices. Loved it.

A bit too much orange zest for my family's palate, though I liked them very much! After it's baked, it gets even more pronounced. I used up all my cinnamon in my Christmas pumpkin pie, so I didn't have any for the recipe (of all things not to have!), but I added some allspice and ginger (~1/4 tsp and ~1/2 tsp respectively). I couldn't taste the spices, which reflects more on the missing ingredient than the merits of the recipe. The cookie itself is great! Next time, less orange zest and I will definitely have cinnamon! OH, and they did take about 14 minutes in my oven at 350 (I have a thermometer, so it was definitely at the right temp). They came out perfectly chewy with slightly crisp edges after I cooled them on the pan for a few minutes.

This is the easiest and mistake-pliable cookie recipe ever... to my horror i actually added 2 cups of flour instead of 1 1/2 and it still turned out superb

This cookie was very good quality cookie, even with my mistakes. I only had 1/2 c of brown sugar, so I compensated with regular sugar and added molasses. I also had one medium orange and I thought the orange flavoring was plenty from that small amount I had (I didn't measure). I decided to be bold today and use spices I'm not used to baking with and I was very well rewarded.

Not bad. Chewy and quite moreish. Half the amount of choc chips is more than enough for me. And next time I'll use half a cup less of sugar I think as they were too sweet. Oh, and I had to bake them for 15 mins.

This is one of the best chocolate chip recipes we've ever made. My high school daughter, now just in college, has made a career of trying different CC cookie recipes. She done and tried everything with excellent to mediocre results. We all agree that this is one of the best recipes. The cookies in this recipe had just the right amount of goo-iness, weren't too flat and were about perfect on the "chewiness" scale. I attribute that to the oatmeal. We combined bittersweet chips with milk chocolate chips. The combination worked out very well. I slipped and put in half a teaspoon of the ground cloves instead of the quarter teaspoon called for. This little slip gave the cookies an exotic flavor that combined well with the orange zest and the bittersweet chips. Fabulous!

Rating: 3
The flavor was great, but it's a thinner, flatter cookie than I prefer. I also wanted there to be more oatmeal. I'll tweak the recipe next time. I didn't have orange zest, so I used some lemon extract instead. I used what I had on hand, so I didn't have as much chocolate or pecans as the recipe called for, either. I had 1 1/4 c of choc chips & chunks, and a bit less than 1 c. of chopped pecan.

This recipe was great. I've never made cookies before and this was easy to follow and the cookies came out just wonderful. I did cut the amount of orange zest in half. Everyone loved the hint of citrus and thought these cookies were very well seasoned. They have a great texture. They are crunchy on around the edge and soft in the middle. They will stay soft for about a week if you keep them in an air tight container. Maybe longer but my cookies were gone on day 5.

I made these with 1/2 C white flour and 1 C whole wheat pastry flour. The pecans I chopped pretty fine. These are great, I can't stop eating them! I used the zest of a whole orange for the 2 t, next time I might use 1/2 as much. Some people were a little "surprised" by the citrus taste.

I usually don't write in reviews unless something is really good or really bad.

These cookies just came out of the oven, so I'm reviewing on the just baked cookie. Very good, different. Love the orange zest, chocolate combination. They needed to bake a bit longer than the suggested time, about 15 minutes until golden. I'm taking them to a party, so we'll see!

These cookies were delish! They were soft (but not so soft that they were falling apart). The cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves really gave these cookies a unique flavor.

I didn't find this recipe as good as the other reviewers. I thought the proportions of the choc chips and pecans were off - way too much of both. I would half those measurements. The spices and orange rind were a nice touch, but then again the flavours were really subtle and I would double these if I make these again, which I probably won't. The texture of the cookies was not as nice as I thought. I baked only 10 min. and cooled on a wire rack. They were soft and chewy when they 1st came out of the oven but later solidified and got really crunchy and hard, esp on the edges. Overall, they were just OK. I will keep hunting for the perfect choc chip cookie recipe. If anyone has any recipe suggestions, on this site or elsewhere - please leave them in the comments section!

Delicious! As the other person wrote - I loved the orange zest and spices, what a delicious twist to a classic cookie! Only had 1/2 c. of oatmeal and didn't have enough orange zest or pecans, but they turned out great - looking forward to adding the right amount of ingredients next time!

These really are good. The orange and the spices add a great twist to a classic recipe and the proportion of the key ingredients is just right. As for the additionals/flavourings- I was a touch below 'scant' on my measurements of the spices (just out of personal preference), I added a tbs of water to keep the cookies moist (this is a great trick if you want your cookies to last a few days), and I added about a 1/4 tsp of maple extract (which might sound odd given the other flavours, but it really boosts the caramel undertone of the brown sugar). I also subbed in 1/2 cup of cake flour for tenderness. Anyhow. Yum!!
