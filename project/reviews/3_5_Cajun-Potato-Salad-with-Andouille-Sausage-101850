I was expecting something wonderful since everyone seemed to give really good reviews on this, but I was a little disappointed. I thought that it could have used more flavor. Maybe I should have poured in the oil after browning the sausage like the other person did. It was just okay for me.

loved this - served it with turducken for a N'orleans BBQ - I trippled it for 18 adults and had a lot of leftovers

really, really good. Not "a dish beyond compare" but really, solidly good. I never give 4 forks. Anywho, a couple of things, I used Aidells andouille sausage and although it comes fully cooked, I still browned it in a skillet and dumped the whole thing (with grease) into the potato mixture. I used a 13 oz. package which I think is the right amount. Other than that I didn't change a thing. It was GONE about 15 minutes into the buffet and many people commented favorably on it. I will make it again. A

Wonderful warm, spicy taste, the flavors blend together wonderfully!

I have made this recipe for years, always to rave reviews, and requests to bring it to parties. I use grilled keilbasa when I can't get andouille, and am sure to up the hot sauce, depending on the type of hot sauce I use. I like to use Maille whole grain mustard for it's course texture.

I made this dish last fall for a large party we were invited to. This was the first to go, even over all of the catered items. I made a few changes - used 10-12 oz. of andouille and cut it into even smaller pieces, left the skin on the potatoes, used less oil and more hot sauce (combo of Tabasco and Crystal) and spicy mustard. I loved it as did everyone else. In my potato salad rotation for life!

Pay no attention to the rude southerners. They give us all a bad reputation. I'm Cajun and I love this recipe. Other types of sausage may be used in any Cajun dish, not just Andouille. In fact, unless you live in the Bayou Country, authentic Andouille is hard to find. (I've tried it out of state and it just wasn't the same.)

this recipe sounded great and i was impressed with the reviews - but couldn't bring myself to douse everything with oil! i omitted the 1/4 cup oil and used 1/4 cup fat-free mayo instead. i thought it came out wonderfully and it got rave reviews at the bbq. i like my 'cajun' dishes a bit spicier also, so i added more hot sauce and provided some zatarain's seasoning for people to add at the table. also, i tried it warm, but thought it was much better the next day cold. i would certainly make the day before to let the flavors meld a bit.

This was YUMMY!! I made it for a barbecue at our house and even my toughest critics went wild.. I did make a minor adjustment - I added a little light mayo - just enough to lightly coat.. I just felt like it needed a little bit...

Have been wanting to try this recipe for some time, and recently came across it again, dashed to the store and bought what I needed. It is awesome and couldn't be easier to put together. Fixed it for a pot luck and it went fast. The folks who panned it must be extremely bland people. Stay with your usual mayo based potato salad folks and don't even try something new.

This is an excellent potato salad. It has received many compliments, including great reviews from friends in the food business--a chef and a caterer.

I made this for a put luck Christmas party. Everyone was crazy about it. Our group goes to New Orleans often so we all enjoy spicy food. If anything, it could more hot sauce. I have also made this dish with Andouille Chicken Sausage and thought it was an excellent low-fat alternative. I could not find Whole Grain Dijon Mustard, so I used Whole Grain Creole Mustard.

I brought this salad to a picnic and it was a hit!! I was asked for the recipe several times which I happily passed on. I served it cold instead of warm or at room temperature since it was very hot on the night of the picnic.

I first made this dish for a Mardi Gras-themed teacher luncheon. The reviews were spectacular. I then made it for a friend's annual cookout and have been asked to make it the thing that I bring every year. Every one loves it, its not too hot and it's very different.

I altered the recipe slightly. Using homemade sausage and my own "essence" spice mix I followed the remainder of the recipe. It was not as hot as it could be but nonetheless I,(we) found it to be very very tasty.

We love this one and it's become a staple at cookouts. Don't know how the complaints about cajun seasoning got passed onto the poor spud salad--it's certainly not in the recipe, which has nothing all that hot in it except some tabasco sauce and some sausage that can be as spicy as you want. Emeril, too, seems to have dropped in from another conversation or another planet. When I make spicy food for kids I taste as I go, and don't over-do, although my own little hotheads like it as spicy as the grown-ups. Lotta folks sounding a little tense out there.

We really enjoyed this cajun version of hot german potato salad. It was spicy, but tasty. Anyone who loves New Orleans style food should try this.

Rating: 1
I used cajun seasoning instead of creole as it was not to be found in the market; could that have made such a huge difference? I found the 1 TBL. hot sauce way too much--it was uncomfortably hot and no one enjoyed it. The kids flatly refused. For the amount of labor, I must say it was a dissapointment. Was asked Not to make it ever again.

This was wonderful. What a nice change from standard mayo based potato salads. Also, unlike German potato salad, there's no bacon grease! It was fast, easy, and got rave reviews from dinner guests. (No leftovers!) I doubled the hot sauce and it was not too spicy, but just right.

This is missing a little something but I can't decide what. I added capers & 1/4-1/2 tsp Cajun Spice mix, but that still didn't do it. It's tasty... just have to figure out how to tweak it.

I have never read such hostile reviews before, sounds like all three are from the same person? Like the old saying goes, if you can't say something good about someone, don't say anything at all. Why the hostility against Emeril? Give me a break.

This was a nice change from mayo-based potato salads. Very different flavour. We really enjoyed it and will definitely make it again, but I don't think it's something we'll have on a regular basis.

Oh the horror. This made me nauseus. I wanted to wretch for three days after eating this. Cajun food royally sucks. God please make the memories go away.

This truely was a great potato salad. I did not have the andouille so I substituted some fresh (1 link) chorizo sausage (take off the casing, crumble, cook for four to five min). I didn't even use oil to cook it in, saving on fat. Unfortunately, I coked to pots a bit too much (forgot to set my new timer), but the flavor was fantastic. Had it with freshly caught blackened grouper, parsley, and lemon wedges.

This was really, really good! I made it a day ahead, refrigerated it, and brought it to room temperature before serving. Tripled the recipe for a big barbecue, and it was a huge hit. Several people asked to take a container home with them. What better compliment is there? I highly recommend heating some of this in the microwave - what a delicious lunch it makes! I think you could get by with about 2/3 of the green onion and celery. I love the stuff, but the quantity seemed out of proportion when the dish was completed. Will definitely make this again for any summer gathering.

I made this for a potluck dinner,it went over great! It was all consumed. I used a red bell pepper just for a better look in the dish, and pam in skillet instead of oil. I also cut back oil over potatoes by half.

Why would someone make a dish with Andouille sausages in it if they did not care for them in the least in the first place? I cannot for the life of me understand why someone would spend their time cutting down someone's cooking based on their using an ingredient they detest in the first place. I hate brussels sprouts, so I don't cook them, and neither do I review recipes in which they are contained. Why are some of these comments so hostile? Is something wrong at home?

This was a fantastic dish. Apparently the "guy down South" doesn't appreciate anything but boring grits, etc. Kick it up a notch and then some. Bam!!!

This was horrible! It must have been submitted by that bonehead Emeril Lagasse. Can't that guy do anything without putting andouille in it? This was terrible!!!

This is a delicious alternative to regular potato salad, especially because it can be served warm. The addition of hot pepper sauce (I used tabasco sauce) is a wonderful surprise and my guests really enjoyed this. I will make it again and again, and it's great as leftovers, warmed up in the microwave!
