I made a few modifications to this recipe because I'm on a program that is specific to my metabolism. I substituted splend for the sugar and i used a jalapeno pepper instead of the habanero so it wouldn't be so hot. I used it on broiled chicken breasts that i had spead liberally with mashed garlic and served it with saffron infused basmati rice. Next time I think I will use this on a pork tenderloin.

A lousy recipe if I may say so. Any food with chile ought to be no good. All you are tasting is chile, nothing else. That's why Chef Norman is using mango; it makes no-never-mind. Instead of mango you could use strawberries, or appricot, or what-have-you, it won't make no difference; it will always taste chile.....lousy! Salud, a Habanero (from La Habana, Cuba).
