I served this Christmas morning for a crowd, and it was a hit with adults and children alike. The young kids were not thrilled with the cranberry-apple compote, however, so I was glad I had maple syrup available. The french toast was easy to prepare once I figured out how to cut the bread. Because my country bread was not very tall, I skipped cutting the loaf in half horizontally. This made fewer slices to turn during the cooking process, which was an advantage. The bread did not soak up all the custard mixture, so I had custard left over to use for a small batch of toast the next day. My husband and daughter loved it just as much the second time around. This recipe is so good it might become my new Christmas morning tradition.

Probably one of the best recipes I've ever had/made. We make it every year on New Year's Day. It is so good and so filling. My mouth is tingling as we speak, in anticipation of Jan. 1!

This was very good and the entire family loved it! I served it with my homemade cranberry sauce with pineapples as I had that already made and it was easier for Xmas morning that way. I made this the night before so it ended up soaking for 10-12 hours so it took a bit longer to cook and was a bit too soft in the center. Still amazing, but next time I would let it soak for just a few hours. I used the Hawaiian Sweet Bread pie loaf and cut up into large pieces. Will definitely make this again!

Excellent Christmas morning dish with nice subtle eggnog flavour. Next time I will cut the eggnog to 3.5 cups as mixture did not completely absorb. Definitely use a hearty bread cut 1"thick. Turn pieces after 2-3 hours of soaking to ensure even coating. Cooking time was longer, about 12 minutes on first side and about 12 after turning. I made half the compote recipe and that was just right. Will make again.

This is a wonderful recipe especially for the holidays; easy to make the day before, and it is so delicious. I substituted fresh pears for the apples in the compote recipe (only because I had them already ripe), and it was outstanding. The leftover compote I served with a plain cheesecake a few days later--yum!

I do not leave reveiws often, but this receipe deserves it. DO NOT serve it without the Apple compote, it makes the dish. So simple, yet I received rave reveiws for days after. I even loved it and had seconds, and I do not like french toast! Easy, presents well, but make sure to get good solid breacd & thick slices.

Made 1/4 of recipe for 2 people. Used 4 pak of King's Hawaiian rolls split horizontally and a dash of gold rum. Yummy! Served with maple syrup, sausage with apricot mustard sauce and grapefruit with wine syrup from menu. Easy do ahead and delicious!

Made this for Christmas Day breakfast. Was a huge hit! I also made the "Sausage and Egg Casserole with Sun-Dried Tomatoes and Mozzarella" recipe which is on this site (got rave reviews!). The two went very well together, so I highly recommend pairing them! The advantage to both recipes is that, for the most part, they can be made a day ahead. It worked great because it gave me more time to socialize and open presents, instead of being stuck in the kitchen! ;-)

I have made this recipe twice, both to rave reviews. The first time I followed the recipe exactly. The second I forgot to buy a couple ingredients so I substituted OJ for cider and honey for corn syrup, and I think the compote came out better. I also had to use regular bread instead of thick sliced bread, which worked, but I wouldn't recommend it. Make sure you cover the bread completely the night before, and that you get in between the slices otherwise it won't fluff up as well.

My brother turned me onto this great recipe and it got rave reviews on Christmas morning, I improvised a little because I only had time to marinate the bread for a couple of hours (still turned out great). I also forgot to pickup ingredients for the apple/cranberry compote, so instead, I whipped up apples and bananas sauteed in butter & brown sugar. Delicious!

I made this on the morning I decorated my tree...and I think I just created a tradition. It was absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe exactly as written, and I wouldn't change a thing. The eggnog and nutmeg make it taste delicious. And that compote is exceptional!

We really thought this recipe was fantastic for Christmas morning. The cranberry-apple compote made it for me, but some of my family preferred powdered sugar and Vermont maple syrup. We usually have an egg casserole on Christmas morning, but I think I've converted everyone to French toast from now on!

It is Jan 17th and I made this french toast for breakfeast.we loved it.Someone said what do you do when you can no longer buy eggnog. My husband goes to the liquor store in February, when they have eggnog left over and they put it on sale, we buy 2to3 bottles then we have it through the winter months

LOVE this recipe! I actually just make the French toast and then serve with syrup. It is a Christmas morning tradition now. It's also fun to make for any type of breakfast/brunch party in the winter. Just make ahead and keep warm in the oven.

Also, I used a french baguette instead of Country white bread because I couldn't find that at the store.

This is something that I would definatly make again. I might add a bit more cinnamon and nutmeg, but this was a huge hit at the Christmas Brunch!

Loved the cranberry-apple compote. I made the mistake of using cooking spray on my pan instead of melted butter (to save some calories) and the french toast stuck like crazy to the pan. Other than that, this is an easy recipe to follow and the eggnog leaves a good flavor (even for someone like me who doesn't drink eggnog)

Fabulous! A great recipe! I forgot to let it sit overnight and only had time to let it mixture sit together for 10 minutes versus 6 hours. Still delicious!

I made this for Christmas Day brunch and greatly enjoyed it. For more eggnog flavor, I added brandy (a couple of splashes for a half recipe, no need to measure).

Rating: 4
This recipe is delicious, I made it for Christmas breakfast and everyone loved it. I used pain de campange which held up very well, there was no sogginess after baking. I love eggnog but I must confess the taste really is subtle. Expect it to be an undertone rather than the predominant flavor. The star of the show, however, is the compote. Seriously - it was one of the tastiest things I have ever made. The recipe made far more than required but I served it with other dishes (it lasted a week) and gave the rest away to my happy guests. Please give yourself a chance to try such a delight by making the compote along with the toast!

Rating: 4
I make this every Christmas morning with a crab quiche (John Travolta's favorite) it is wonderful. For the bread I like to use Texas toast, the slices are consistent in size and bake more evenly. I only make this once a year due to high caloric intake (along with the heart-attack-on- a plate-quiche)but I can justify it for Santa and Mrs. Claus. Treat your friends.

I made this for my in- laws on Christmas day and everyone LOVED it. First of all, it is VERY easy to make. I sliced the bread and whipped up the egg mixture before I went out for Christmas Eve dinner. When I got home, I assembled put the bread in the egg mixture and soaked it overnight. I baked it in the oven as directed and it came out PERFECT! It had a little kick from the egg nog, and was moist and fluffy on the inside and toasted perfectly on the outside. The compote is the ideal complement to the dish. The cranberries cut the sweetness from the apple and sugar. I think the secret is to use a thick, dense bread. That way the french toast will not be soggy. I bought a country white loaf and sliced it myself. I can see how a thin bread might be mushy. I am trying it with challah for New Year's Day brunch because I have egg nog and compote left over.

Rating: 4
Fabulous! Easy to make and everyone loved it. I made it in the oven and it turned out just fine. The compote is a MUST. It is very good. I might cut back on a little sugar as the apple cider probably had enough sweetness to compensate. This would also be a great side dish with pork tenderloin or a ham.

Everyone loved it and looked really Christmassy. I used light egg nog, and would repeat with using less butter

I'm not sure what other reviewers were complaining about? This had the perfect eggnog kick, but needs the compote for a perfect complement. I served this for 38 women and they all loved it! I think I just boosted circulation for Bon Appetit!

Definitely wouldn't make again. Super easy - love the do-ahead - but do not make in the oven. Make it on the griddle, which puts the time & energy back into the cooking work. Didn't try the compote, but I would try that again. Tried for Christmas Brunch, sad that I wasted the holiday with a bad dish.

For a more grown-up taste and to accentuate the eggnog, add 2 tablespoons of rum as you reduce the cider mixture. The alcohol will cook off, leaving just the essence of truly festive brunch.

I was disappointed with this recipe, having looked forward to it all night long on Christmas Eve. I expected to really be able to taste the egg nog, but the flavor was very very subtle. The transferring process produced nicer looking french toast, but to avoid the hastle and get better-tasting results, I would recommend the Baked Blueberry-Pecan French Toast over this.

Made this Christmas morning and it was delicious! I was looking for a French toast recipe that I could do ahead (to save on the effort on an already busy morning) -- this worked beautifully. I made the recipe to 3/4 proportion and substituted croissants for the bread. The apple cranberry compote is FABULOUS and added a very Christmas-y touch -- it would be good on pancakes or waffles, pound cake or cheesecake, too.

This is so simple to make, and easy too. It's great to pop in the oven on Christmas morning and not have to worry about it. We leave it in a warm oven and sort of "graze" all morning while opening gifts.

Fabulous! I had company over Christmas morning and served this with rave reviews! I doubled the amount of nutmeg and freshly ground it - what a difference - Yum! I'm not a huge fan of cranberries, so I made a blueberry compote instead and it turned out amazing. This is definately a keeper!

I received many compliments from colleagues recently when I took it for "breakfast" on the day of parent/teacher conferences. It combines two big holiday cravings (eggnog and cranberries) for a festive brunch dish!

Rating: 3
The french toast is delicious. I made mine with "silk nog" -- soy milk egg nog and it was terrific. However, despite my better judgment I followed the cranberry compote recipe exactly - way too much butter! The butter takes away the tart, wonderful taste that the fruit would give to this dish, and leaves you with a big butter mess, not to mention what it does for the fat and calorie count. I would eliminate the butter entirely from that part.

Rating: 4
This recipe is super-easy and delicious. I used an electric skillet because I had something else in the oven and the compote took a bit longer to thicken but otherwise I followed the recipe step by step. I will definately make this again next year - it may even become a tradition...

I purposely didn't rate this recipe because i am willing to accept that my less than desirable results may have been my fault. I was SO looking forward to this recipe...but sadly disappointed. I think maybe because i used home-made country white bread...perhaps too dense for this recipe? I ended up with too much liquid-and my bread stuck to the glass pan and i ended up with a soggy mess. I would like to try again with another bread.

I saw this recipe this morning and can't wait to make it. French Toast is my favorite meal. The Creme Brulee French Toast on this site is beyond good. I have made it countless times and even did it for 70 people once. It is easy and EVERYONE will ask you for the recipe. Use the suggestions of leaving the crust on the bread as that is a huge time saver. I am ready to try this today. Thanks for all the reviews.

This was pretty good, but I could barely tell there was eggnog in it. My family like it a lot for Christmas morning, though. Next time I'll use a different bread, since all I had was Italian bread.

We have a culinary academy at the high school level and our students have been doing quite a bit of catering in our area. For our high school's Dad's club, we prepared breakfast for 100. One of the favorite items on our menu is this french toast with apple-cranberry compote. As reiterated by so many others, it's a wonderful do ahead recipe and loved by all. Don't forget to butter not only the bottom but sides of pan or the bread may stick. We actually put parchment paper down first now. Thank you Bon Appetit !!

I made this recipe on Christmas morning - it was the perfect wintry mix of delicious and nostalgic flavors. I liked being able to make it the night before so the time spent cooking in the morning was minimal. All I had to do was pop it in the oven and reheat the compote. This way, it took less time than even "plain old" french toast would have taken to prepare in the morning and was so much more impressive. I did find the compote took much longer to cook than the recipe stated. Perhaps I cut the fruit too large. It was wonderful, though, and kept getting better with each reheating. There was enough left over to serve as a side dish with a future dinner and as a topping for another dessert! I was afraid that soaking the bread in the eggnog mixture overnight would make it too soggy in the middle, but the baking (rather than grilling) took care of that. I would make this again any time I can find eggnog in the store!

We made this for Christmas morning and everyone enjoyed it, from the 15 year old superjock to Grandma. The compote wasn't too sweet and is a good complement to the eggnog flavor. We dipped baguette slices in the eggnog and cooked it on a griddle. Next time I think I will beat extra eggs into the eggnog before dipping. We hate soggy French toast although it wasn't too bad this time.

Made this over the holidays for guests, and while everyone ate some, no-one was very enthusiastic! I used my husband's homemade white bread, and followed the recipe exactly. I didn't, however, make the compote, as I had no cider, so I sauteed some chopped apples with cinnamon/sugar to top. I don't believe the cranberries would save the dish. I may try the compote alone to serve with other dishes, but we won't be repeating the french toast.
