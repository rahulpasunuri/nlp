Nice combination of flavors, however, next time I would double the first five ingredients. Also, alternate the measuring of the oil and maple syrup, found that the syrup "spills" out of the measuring spoon when done that way...

Loved the mixture of sweet vs. spicy. I made a lot of replacements with things I already had in my apartment - Pecans in place of walnuts, oregano in place of fresh thyme, and honey in place of syrup - was still delicious! Mixed with dried/roasted edamame and cranberries for a great trail-mix.

Followed this closely, except used honey, having recently run out of maple syrup, and didn't want it too sweet, so used only 2 tsps.honey, not 5. Was great with drinks before dinner. Watch closely to avoid burning, but it may take longer than the time stated, depending on your oven. Keep trying them. When the walnut has a definite crunch, they're done. A keeper for me.
