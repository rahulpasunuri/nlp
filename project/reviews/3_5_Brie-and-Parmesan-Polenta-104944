This was delicious! The polenta needs more than the stated time to cook (unless maybe you are using quick cooking but I use traditional) but it is easy and comes together wonderfully. Served with simple grilled sausages and a green salad

Very easy to make. Nice comfort food.

OK, nothing spectacular, a little dry.

Yummy, easy comfort food. Very adaptable and forgiving. Would be good with many other cheeses as well, although it was perfect as written.

This was a great dish. Didn't have the Brie and substituted cream cheese. It was wonderful. Leftovers were fried and served with pork chops. Yum!

Made this with short ribs and it was a huge hit. A WONDERFUL starch dish.

Have you ever seen Homer Simpson with doughnuts? That was our reaction to this side dish. I served it with grilled asparagus, zuchini, carrots, red onion and eggplant, along with roasted red pepper and baked japanese eggplant (baked with soy sauce, vinegar, a tablespoon sugar and a touch of sesame oil). Served after a quick gazpacho, this was the essence of summer in a meal. Truly a perfect side dish, enhancing instead of overwhelming the rest of the meal.

This is a very easy side dish to make and the "heat" can be adjusted to your specific taste.
