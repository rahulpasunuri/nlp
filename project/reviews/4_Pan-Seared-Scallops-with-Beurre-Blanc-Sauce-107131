My sauce turned out way too vinegary. Would make the scallops again, but not the sauce.

Only changes I made was to sub. light cream for whipping cream and didn't have any shallots on hand. Served them with twice baked potatoes and brussels sprouts. Simple and delicious with no fuss.

Use 4 T. cider vinegar and a pinch of fresh thyme for beurre blanc, then serve over creamy polenta made with fresh pureed pumpkin. Unbelievable.

I saw the most gorgeous sea scallops at the store tonight and had to have them. Found this recipe on the epicurious app on my phone. LOVE!! They came out perfectly. A big part of the success was the quality of the scallops to begin with- at $23 a pound they were a bit more than I was planning to spend but they were BEAUTIFUL!! They cooked up perfectly too- just a light dredging of flour and cooked in a cast iron skillet. Melt-in-mouth perfection. YUM. Will make again the next time the scallops look so perfect!!

I recently tried this recipe to rave reviews from my dinner guests. It was quite easy and relatively quick to make. To kick it up a notch, I added crab claw meat to the finished buerre blanc sauce and served it over the seared scallops in a gratin dish as a first course. Absolutely delicious!

This sauce was a big disappointment - tasted like bland stroganoff sauce. Loved the scallops though. Mine had a lovely crust and wonderful flavor thanks to the white pepper and salt.

I have tried a number of beurre blanc sauce recipes and was so disappointed. Not this time! This was perfect and no changes were needed. I also loved the way the scallops seared with the flour. I will definitely put this in my "keeper" file.

I was so looking forward to this preparation after reading all of the great reviews, but was sorely disappointed. The coating on the scallops completely fell off, the beurre blanc just tasted too vinegary and weird, and I ended up throwing out half of the dish. Yuck.

I though the white wine vinegar was going to be too much but when combined with the sweetness of the scallops it made a great complement. Would definitely make again.

Made this for Xmas dinner. Very easy and very delicious. The sauce may sound odd, but it works very well with the sweetness of the scallops. It also worked well with the buttermilk mashed potatoes and steamed asparagus I served with the scallops. Everyone loved this dish.

oh, and then serving on a bed of wild rice as an appetizer?

Can't rate this yet since I haven't tried this exact recipe but was wondering how it would be instead of searing the scallops with flour but flaming them in chatreuse?

Low fat? No. Absolutely delicious? Yes. I served it with mash potatoes and asparagus for a weeknight dinner, and it was fast and easy to prepare. I think I might have used a bit too much flour on the scallops but they turned out delightfully seared and brown anyway. My new favorite scallop recipe and the beurre blanc is to die for.

Getting a good crust on scallops have been a little difficult for me lately. I think I'm buying the non-chemically frozen, pat them extra dry after defrosting, and don't peek while they are cooking. The addition of the flour really helped to add that lovely caramelized crust, and I'll use that again. The beurre blanc was a very nice addition. Mine was a tad on the sweet side,I think it could have been a combination of the vinegar and the shallot I used.

Wonderful - the scallops get a nice seared crust with the flour, and the beurre blanc sauce is a perfect accompaniment to the scallops' delicate sweetness. Will definitely make again.

In spite of the fact that I was out of white wine vinegar and had to use red, and forgot to put the freshly chopped chives on top at the last minute, these were still excellent. Will definitely be making these again!

This was wonderful and wicked easy...Although My sauce wasn't as thick as it should have been (my mistake) it still tasted great. I served it with polenta YUM! The sauce is so good you'll want to eat it like soup!! Not figure friendly but ohhhh so good! I have extra sauce...think i'll hold it for an egg dish or something...this is a keeper for sure!!

I made this for guests and we all LOVED it. I made it as written serving it with rice and salad. Perfect dinner!

YUM YUM! This is a fantastic way to cook scallops; it's simple and the subtle flavors shine through. I realized too late I was out of white wine vinegar, so used wine instead. I also used 1/2 water, 1/2 wine. Next time I'd like to experiment adding garlic, perhaps some lemon peel or juice. Delicious.

With large sea scallops in abundance now, I'm so glad I found this dish! It produced the best scallops and sauce I've ever made. For the cook who said the flour stuck to the pan, mine did too, a little, but having the pan hot enough and using DRY scallops, rather than those soaked in chemicals, help a lot. The chemical-soaked scallops exude a lot of water when they're cooked.

I loved this one, but honestly, I tried the scallops in beurre rouge recipe from this site and preferred it. This one was delicious as well... I served it with mashed potatoes and asparagus, but I think I'll go to the beurre rouge next time I want to do scallops.

I added a very light dusting of garlic powder with the salt & pepper and followed the remainder of the recipe. Extremely simple and delicious!

I made this dish last night and it was fantastic. We have created a special binder for *restaurant quality* recipes, and this dish officially made it in! Didn't change one thing and even my picky teenagers loved it.

I made this for my husband for Valentine's Day, and we both were floored!! I did substitute some white wine for some of the water, but other than that followed the recipe. The cooking directions were perfect- the scallops looked like they were just barely done when we took them out of the pan, but by the time we sat down they must have cooked while they rested, because they were perfect. What a fabulous meal!!

I used 3/4 cup of champagne in lieu of the water. The scallops used were fresh and wild caught. The results were excellent!

I made this dish for my husband and 2 kids (5, 7) and we all loved it. Served it over basmati rice with spinach on the side. Made it as specified in the recipe but didn't have the vinegar so used dry white wine instead. Also added a finely chopped clove of garlic to the olive oil when cooking the scallops. I had never tried cooking scallops myself before but will definitely do so again. It was easy and delicious. (I'm currently living in France where scallops are sold with the coral attached. I went ahead and cooked it with coral left on and found it all tasty.)

I also found the sauce to taste too much of vinegar. Reducing the sauce for about 10 mins helped and also thickened the sauce. Most of the flour coating stuck to the pan; it was non-stick and I used olive oil?? But the part that stayed on did have a nice golden color and overall they were very good.

Followed the suggestion of reducing the amount of vinegar slightly, and I think that was a good move so the dish wouldn't taste too acidic. This dish is really delicious, and well-worth the calories of the "white butter" sauce.

My family and I love this recipe. It's quick and easy to make. I use only dry white wine instead of the white wine vinegar. I make this quite often.

This dish was fabulous, we can't stop talking about it! This was the first time I cooked scallops but will try this again soon. I took a few recommendations and decreased the vinegar and upped the whipping cream.

I made this for company and got rave reviews. However, I would use a little less vinegar next time. I'd like a creamier sauce.

I made this as an appetizer for Father's Day. Scallops are my Dad's favorite. He raved about the dish and said it was the best scallop recipe he's ever tasted. Because it is very rich, I would serve it only as an appetizer with about 4 scallops per person. It was very easy to make and I would definitely make it again. My Mom used the leftover sauce on her baked potato. YUM!

Delicious! I would make this again...for a special occasion...lots of butter in this one!

HOLY COW! This was divine!! I didn't have chives, so I didn't worry about it. Only draw back was whisking in the butter one piece at a time---but well worth the effort. We will definitely dine on this again--and again!

Damn the cholesterol, full speed ahead. This is delicious. I didn't have all the ingredients so made the following substitutions. orange muscat vinegar for the white vinegar - the touch of sweetness went well garlic and the white part of green onions for the shallots green part of green onions for the chives Part margarine for part of the butter canned milk for the cream Served it with new potatoes, but I'd use rice next time. The potatoes kind of overwhelmed the sauce. Don't forget to take your cholesterol meds.

This was our Valentine's Day dinner and it was wonderful. I made exactly as directed serving it over a wild rice pilaf. The beurre blanc sauce was a perfect complement to the scallops. I didn't use a non stick pan as I find I can get a much nicer crust on the scallops using a well seasoned cast iron skillet. I think I would like to try using raspberry vinegar next time as a raspberry beurre blanc with fresh raspberries would be delicious.

We've made this several times and it always came out delicious. An excellent and simple recipe for scallops.

Instead of 3/4 cup water, I used half dry white wine and half water. i also used a little less vinager. It was very good. i served the scallops on a potato pancake,with some wilted spinach and crumbled apple smoked bacon then drizzled with the sauce. Yum.

Great meal - I served with rice pilaf, which soaked up some of the beurre blanc sauce and was sinfully good. My husband, who claims that he does not like seafood, asked me to make it a staple.

I followed the recipe as printed. Placed the scallops atop a shiitake/shallot/green onion potato pancake and poured the beurre blanc over it. My guests raved!

Loved this recipe but made some changes. I only used 3 tbs of butter for the sauce, but added grated parm at the end. I coated the scallops in a mixture of fresh, finely chopped bread crumbs mixed with flour, curry powder and pepper. The white wine vinegar gives the dish a most wonderful tang that compliments the the sweetness of the scallops. Easy to make - a real keeper!
