These do not come alive until you saute in olive oil and salt generously with kosher salt. Also would recommend turning halfway thru the baking to even their browning. And do not skimp on the Ricard (or Pernod). It's not a fair review if you skip steps or skimp on ingredients.

This did not seem any more labor intensive than any other yeast bread, but I cheated and used a bread maker for the dough, then added the anise, salt, and pepper at the last minute. I also added a couple of tablespoons more extra fruity olive oil and some lemon zest. Delicious and different! This will deffinately make many more appearances at our table.

Delicious and different! My husband ate as many as he could for breakfast the next morning, and then took a bunch to work with him. This recipe will deffinately make more appearances in menus at our house.

These were ok...I have to admit I did not saute them in the oil and finish with the salt prior to serving. The problem was that they were labor intensive and by the time I finished preparing my meal (goose, potatoes, salad and green beans) the last thing I wanted to do was this. Since I live in Healdsburg, I have been able to have the real deal...they are good however I would rather visit the restaurant opposed to taking the time to make these again.
