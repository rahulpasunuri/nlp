This is the first time I've cooked fish that was as good as something I would have gotten in a restaurant. I, too, like strong flavors, but this was mild and delicious.

very nice! I think I will skip the sauce and extra butter next time. Just the fish and veggies coming directly out of the oven were very tasty, and I think the butter made it a little too heavy for an everyday meal. Otherwise, this recipe is easy enough for a nightly dish. I used Voignier instead of Riesling since it is what I had on hand, and it was delicious!

I thought this was flavorful and perfectly cooked. Very tender, and the riesling adds a nice acidity. You can definitely cut down on the butter -- I did and still thought it was yummy. The only thing was, the boneless butterflied trout I got at my local fish market was not totally boneless. I'm ok with that, but it's something to keep in mind if making this dish for kids.

This was simple an lovely! I am making it again tonight for company. I am not one for following recipes to the letter and found that variations stood up very well.

This recipe is fabulous and very easy! If the amount of butter scares you, don't pour the sauce over the fish, serve it on the side.

This is a fantastic recipe! We had a special on large 'Golden Trout" at the store we shop at and in this recipe, they were outstanding. Surly one of the most attractive and savory meal I have ever prepared for a diner party of 10!

I happened upon some trout at the grocery store last week and wanted an uncomplicated recipe. This fit the bill. I didn't have leeks on hand, so I skipped them, and I also didn't use nearly as much butter as called for. I don't think the recipe suffered. I really enjoyed this. It came together quick.

This was a very pleasant dish. I usually like things with really strong flavors, but this was very delicate and nice. I left out the carrots, but loved the leeks, and the riesling gives it a nice subtle flavor. Fairly easy too. A good bet for non-adventurous company.

This dish had a very nice light flavor - not overpowering. I would go a little heavier on the salt next time (I used 1/2 tsp sea salt). The carrots and leeks were cooked perfectly. Eating this made us feel like we were eating a $30 meal at a fancy restaurant, yet it was sooooo easy!

I loved this recipe! It was really delicious and very easy to make. I also used just 2 trout but the full amount of the rest of ingredients as written. I didn't have any riesling so used gewurtztraminer.

This dish was delicious. As always I made a few changes the first being to cut back on the butter. I used only the butter to saute the vegies...then at the end I added a small amount of cream to round out the sauce with a touch of dejon mustard. I also used the full receipe but for only two trout, so I would double everything if I made it for four. But the flavors were wonderful and we will have this one again!
