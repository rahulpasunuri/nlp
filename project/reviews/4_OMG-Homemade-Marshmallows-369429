I have tried several homemade marshmallow recipes and this is my favorite; easier than others I have tried and just as good. Can add peppermint extract instead of vanilla for peppermint marshmallows. Spread on large rimmed cookie sheet and cut with cookie cutters (we used snowflakes) or use a 9X13 pan for large square marshmallows. Works fine to line pan with parchment.

I made this one, but didn't have light corn syrup, so I used dark. I liked the texture and the method was easy in my big kitchenaid. I would let them sit overnight before cutting them as the texture changes and firms up more upon sitting a little longer than suggested
