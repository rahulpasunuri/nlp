Exceptionally quick, easy, healthy and tasty weeknight dinner. 3 forks for flavor, 1 extra for being just what I need on a busy evening -- chop and drop cooking that yields a yummy-good and healthy dinner in a short amount of time. My changes: used less onion, used some fresh grape tomatoes and some grape tomatoes that I'd frozen a while back (briefly thawed under running water and chopped - great use for these!!). Fresh herbs were wonderful in this dish. I added chives instead of parsley because that's what I had. We rounded things out w/ some reheated leftover basmati. Oh - fish substitution here - used tilapia instead of halibut - it would be great with halibut, but tilapia fits the budget better.

Just returned from the farmer's market and found this recipe. Used leeks instead of red onion,fresh cherry tomatoes, corn and zucchini. Also had some foraged chanterelles brought back from Maine! What a treat.

After reading the reviews complaining about lack of liquid, I used a le Creuset enameled cast-iron pot and added white wine, extra lime juice, and cumin. The result was very saucy and reminiscent of the subtle flavors of Peru. I could imagine it served over a bed of fluffy quinoa. Will definitely make it again.

I also cooked this with a good white wine, instead of lemon and added some (unfortunately) dried basil. It would have been better with fresh. But it was quite nice and light and good with roasted finger potatoes.

i added 1/2 cup white wine, 1/2 cup water to make it more like a sauce and added crushed red pepper for some heat. really delicious. sauce could easily be a great side dish.

I added baby Yukon Gold potatoes cut in quarters with the onions and grape tomatoes instead of plums. Doubled the basil (we love basil!) and quadrupled the lime- used key limes. The whole family loved it, even the 5 year old.

This does not yield a sauce--it's fish with a side of vegetables. If I were to make this again (and I don't think I will), I would cut the vegetables into small pieces, cook them down and reduce the liquid, and then add the fish. There are lots of other ways to cook halibut that produce better results.

Yum! I used salmon instead, skipped the corn, doubled the veggies, and added red pepper flakes. Served with rice mixed with toasted pine nuts and the pesto that the cook from Denver suggested. I cooked the tomatoes longer than instructed before adding additional ingredients and the "veggie sauce" was plenty liquid - great to soak up with the rice. Everyone loved it!

This was a very nice dinner but I had to add liquid to the vegetables before adding the fish as there was almost no liquid in the pan. I added about 1/3 cup dry white wine and let it reduce a little bit and then added the fish. I cooked all the vegetables for two of us along with two fresh halibut filets and served over orzo. A nice, light one dish meal. Next time, I will add a little more wine, a little more lime and some cumin to give it a Peruvian twist. This should also be very good with snapper and very pretty if the veggies are diced rather small to be more of a salsa on a lighter textured fish like snapper or even tilapia.

I didn't consider this a "sauce" either. I added extra olive oil to keep from getting too dry. It looked great and was healthy. I didn't drop over the taste but would make it again for a lite fish dish.

I made this for a dinner party and it was awesome! I used salmon, doubled the veggies and added just a bit of crushed red pepper as others had suggested. I served it on a bed of herbed orzo. For the orzo, I tossed in a pesto like sauce- with a bit of olive oil, garlic, lime juice, fresh parsley, green onion, thyme and oregano- then tossed with a bit of feta cheese crumbles. The tastes were great together. I'll definately make it again- needed a huge pan!

Delicious! I used turbot fillets instead of halibut (which the fishmonger told me was very similar). I don't know how that affected the end result, but I thought the fish could use more flavor. Next time I will season the fish more before cooking with the veggies and add a generous amount of lemon. The veggies were excellent. Great flavor, esp. with a lot of tomatoes, and very healthy. I made roughly the same amount of veggies called for in the recipe, with only 1 lb of fish and we really enjoyed having lots of extra veggies on the side. I also loved the fish cooked this way -- it turned out very delicate and flaky. I will definitely make this again and again! I only wish I had discovered this earlier in the summer so I could have made it with all the fresh seasonal vegetables available.

WONDERFUL! I live in California, so I was able to obtain fresh Halibut and farmer market veggees. Used summer vegetables instead of zuch. and added red pepper. The fish was very flaky and the sauce to die for. Cheers!

I used fresh Brandywine tomatoes and the result was wonderful! Healthy and delicious - definately will make again.

Wow, this was great and very easy to prepare. I like fish but rarely prepare it. Only problem was that I forgot my wife had a canker sore in her mouth, so she thought the dish was a little too acidic... More for me ;-)

Where did I go wrong? I seeded the tomatoes, maybe I shouldn't have? I don't think this is really a "sauce". I found I had to cook on a lower temp. and add water at the end as it was drying out and sticking to my pan. On the positive side, the flavors tasted well together and it was pretty to look at. I think using fresh corn made a difference.

I am reviewing in retrospect. Made this last summer and it was truly delicious and sophisticated. Used very fresh corn and tomatoes and suspect this is key to success.

I have made this dish about four times over late summer and early fall. It's very easy to prepare and tastes delicious. Hard to believe it's lowfat. I highly recommend the orzo versus rice as well.

Very tasty and pretty! I took the advice of one contributor and added a bit of fresh hot pepper as I felt the dish might be a bit blah otherwise. I cooked salmon instead of halibut. ANY thick fish would do, really.

Great recipe, but I substituted Chilean Sea Bass and marinated it for about 30 minutes. As I added the fish to the pan I included the marinade which consisted of a soy sauce, worcestershire, lemon juice mix. Gave it a nice kick.

Great, easy recipe. Beautiful. Tasty - good with salmon, too. I recommend leaving out the parsley and using just basil. I like the taster better and you don't have a bunch of extra herbs you might not need. Make extra vegetables, freeze and have ready for another quick meal -- when ready to serve, thaw, put in sauce pan to warm and place fish on top. Ready in 10 minutes. Great for potlucks, too.

Yum-yum! What an excellent dish with light, yet tantalizing flavors! When I do this again I will add more veggies (the fresher the better!) and less fish - though the leftovers were a hit too! I served this dish with orzo (as suggested) and it would have been a nice addition if I had cooked the orzo long enough - watch out! Bottom line, this was a hit and I will surely make it again!

Nice presentation. I've been disappointed with some highly rated recipes on this site, but this was one well worth the raves. Simple, light, and good.

This dish was very easy to prepare and tasted wonderful. The vegetables were suprisingly flavorful. I didn't add any salt, and I didn't think the dish needed it.

I thought this was a very simple dish to make and did not take too much time to prepare. Would work well for a dinner party as most of the sauce can be prepped ahead of time and then put together just before cooking.

Wonderful dish. Fast, easy. Looks beautiful and tastes great! The halibut does need longer cooking time.

I served this dish at a small dinner party and it was a HUGE hit. It's so flavorful and goes well with just about any side dish. I served it with a warm green bean salad with basil and pine nuts (epicurious recipe) and broccoli with garlic,olive oil and lemon juice. Some warm, crusty ciabatta bread with rosemary olive oil for dipping, and you've got yourself a great meal! Next time I make this, I'll add some chilis, just to spice it up a bit, but it's fine just the way it is!!

Wow. A simple, "health conscious" entree that can stir a strong emotional response. If you want to make this dish a knockout, serve it with American basmati rice (Texmati). The popcorn aroma of the rice simply makes magic with the fish and veggies. A flavorful, eye-appealing, and satisfying dish. Quick to prepare as well!
