So, like other reviewers, I used this as a base recipe and expanded from there. I left the skins on the potatoes (they were tiny, it was easier that way), and I sautéed some onions, garlic and red pepper flakes. I had a wee bit of cream in the fridge that I needed to use up, so I added that and the pesto. It was fantastic! And there's a ton, so I have lunch for at least two days!

A total waste of my wonderful pesto. I now know that I do not like the combination of potatoes and pasta. It is rare for us to toss leftovers, but we did.

Nice, and every easy, but a little bland. Next time I might add a little extra garlic and red pepper flakes.

quick tip... in a seperate pan, saute LOTS of garlic, red pepper, onion and red pepper flakes for 5 minutes. then, add 1/2 cup each of white wine and chix or veg broth; then add sea bass or other similar fish and cover and poach. when fish is done, remove from pan, and add pepper, garlic, onion mixture to the drained pasta broccoli, potato mixture. mix well, then top with fish, parmesan and a sprig of basil to garnish... quite delish!!!!

I love this dish and have been making it regularly since the recipe first came out. I too use a smaller-shaped pasta (usually penne or farfalla) and add some toasted pine nuts. Sometimes I also add sliced green onions.

I also use a smaller, shaped pasta - and add a handful of fresh toasted pinenuts.

I have made this many times, except I have used green beans instead of broccoli. I'm looking forward to trying the broccoli. I'm sure any in season vegetable would work. I have done it this way, and I have also tossed the potates and green beans with a bit of olive oil and roasted them in a 400 degree oven for about 40-45 minutes before tossing with bow tie pasta and pesto. My girls love it.
