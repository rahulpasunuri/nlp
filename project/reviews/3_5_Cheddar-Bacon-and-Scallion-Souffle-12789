Excellent recipe. I made this in 8 small ramekins, coated 1/2 with butter and 1/2 with butter and parmesan. I didn't notice a difference - both versions rose high above the rims and tasted wonderful. I did follow others advice to add a pinch of cream of tarter to the egg white.

My first souffle ever and it was delicious and successful. I used breadcrumbs on the dish like others suggested.

Excellent, and for a souffle it was not too complicated. I will certainly make it gain.

This was soo yummy, and I was surprised how filling the portions were! Used parmesan on the ramekins instead of breadcrumb. One of the souffles barely sank, and the other sank quite a bit, which was really strange...

Super Souffle - I'm no master chef and I used this recipe for my first time making a souffle! Mine dropped a little after I got it out of the oven but it was still super fantastic! Made two in large ramekins - amply satisfied my husband and I for brunch. The flavor was great! I coated the ramekins in butter and pain bread crumbs to help it climb. - this is a technique other first-timers have recommended to me. Good Luck!!

This did not rise as high as I expected, but it was a perfect souffle texture, so I didn't mind.

So very delicious, so very sad looking after it 'crashed', which means it more than sank! Thanks, Paula Wood, I will add the 1/4 t. cream of tartar next time. With salad, a few glasses of white wine - so very lovely.

I hadn't made a souffle in about 15 years when I tried this one. It was great! I left out the bacon and that was fine. I buttered and bread crumbed the pan. Cooked it 40 minutes. Just right!

First attempt of this produced a good souffle, but it didn't rise as much as I would have liked. So I made adjustments after watching a "Food 911" episode (thanks Tyler!). First, I added 1/4 tsp. cream of tartar to the egg whites while whipping them. And secondly, I buttered the dish and dusted it with bread crumbs (you could use parmesan cheese as well). It turned out beautifully -- the souffle rose approximately 3" above the top of the dish. It was picture perfect.

I found this recipe while doing research for my Advanced Baking class in Culinary School. I made the souffle and it was perfect--color, texture, height, everything. I then came home and fixed it for my family and they all loved it.

I love souffles and don't make them too often, fat being the culprit. Tonight I decided to go ahead and indulge. I was surfing souffle recipes and came across this one. I had already thawed a box of frozen chopped spinach earlier thinking I would make a spinach souffle. After draining the spinach and squeezing out all of the liquid I added this to the souffle base. It was terrific. What could be more natural than spinach and bacon and some cheese. I used yellow onion instead of the green onions and did use skim milk. Another tip for those of you new to souffles, with cheese or savory souffles, I spray the souffle dish with cooking spray, then dust with freshly grated parmesan cheese. It gives the souffle something to grab on to as it rises and gives a wonderful flovor to the crust. I often do that with mac and cheese too. I helps it come out of the dish more easily and makes clean up a snap. With sweet souffles spray the dish with cooking spray, or butter it and then coat with sugar.

This was my first souffle - either making or eating. If you love souffles, this is probably a great one, but I wouldn't bother making this again. It tasted great (with cheddar cheese, scallions and bacon, you really can't miss, can you?) but I don't care for the texture. It's basically very airy, moussey scrambled eggs. Next time, I'll just make normal scrambled eggs with cheese, bacon and scallions and skip the airy moussey part.

I thought this was scrumptious! I'm not a fan of souffles because I don't care for the texture, but the taste was delicious. I ran out of scallions at a 1/4 cup, so I added some sweet onion as well. My boyfriend ate the entire dish by himself aside from two small pieces!

I made this for supper last night, using low fat milk. It came out perfectly and was delicious. Paired with a green salad it is a simple but elegant meal. If you want to make ahead, you can do the sauce part and refrigerate it, then return to room temp, whip and fold in the egg whites just before putting it in the oven.

This was my first souffle...I liked it, but I did not love it -- the ingredients make it quite unhealthy, but it was tasty.

If you've never made a souffle before, this recipe is a good place to start. I was able to serve this dish to company one night after work - took little time to prepare and the results were impressive. Delicious and great for cheese-lovers.
