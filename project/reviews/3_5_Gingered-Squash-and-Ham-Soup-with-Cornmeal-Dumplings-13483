also... oven roast the squash. I don't think you get enough flavor from it if you just cook it in water

I've made it a few times, and I am giving it 4 forks because of the potential that's in this dish. I add curry to it, and some habanero peppers to give it a kick. the ham can be sauteed before adding it to give a nice texture counterbalance. If you play with the flavors you'll find the flavors of tomato and squash that otherwise may be lost in this soup.

Yummy, but not what I expected. The soup looked really thin and I was concerned, but it turns out once you put in the dumplings it thickens up quite a bit. The dumplings fell apart, so it wound up more like polenta than a soup with dumplings in it. I would make with broth rather than water as it was a little bland on its own. Also, the brown sugar was a good suggestion.

I made this recipe as part of a week-long Use Large Amounts of Leftover Ham cooking series. As a dumpling novice, I was curious to try them. The soup itself is extremely simple -- yum, pureed squash -- and the raw ginger is a bit sharp in it. The ham seems an afterthought, not necessary to the dish. However, things pick up when the dumplings appear. They're so salty and oniony that they go beautifully with the sweet, underspiced squash (as the recipe authors intended, presumably). Follow the dumpling proportions closely, and they're extremely tender, on the verge of turning into mush but not quite -- is this the dumpling goal? Add even a little too much egg or flour, though, and they become solid, meatbally creatures (yes, I tried this also). I recommend dropping them very small and being generous with the chives. While this dish has its interesting points, unfortunately people did not eat it well and I had to freeze most of it. I do not plan to make it again.

We really liked this recipe. A few notes: my squash was closer to 2 lbs so the amount of liquid was too much. I let the soup cook down for a while, which brought out the delicious ham flavor. I dropped some of the corn bread into the soup, and some of it I patted into little round shapes. The ones that were dropped were much fluffier and better. Also added a can of drained white beans to compensate for too much liquid. Yum! Will definitely make again. Perfect for leftover ham.

Delicious! Polenta lovers will be rewarded by using stone-ground cornmeal in the dumplings. I substituted 3 cups of homemade chicken stock for three cups of the water and added 2 - 3 tbls. of brown sugar and some freshly grated nutmeg. Will deinitely use the dumpling recipe in other dishes!

This turned out a little bland. I think when I make this again I'll try sauteing the ham in the pan, removing it, and sauteing the squash with some onion before adding the water. The flavor might be improved by using chicken broth or boullion instead of water as well.

I made this soup with a nice piece of smoked ham and it was fantastic. Its very under-rated. 3.5 forks.

Didn't care for this recipe at all. Perhaps my squash was the problem but I thought the soup was tastless and mealy. Too bad because I love squash soups.

My husband and I loved this soup. I especially enjoyed mashing the cornmeal dumplings in my dish to spread that flavor throughout. It's a wonderful winter meal.
