This was a really yummy way to used up some leftover pork tenderloin (pork tenderloin w/ avocado salsa from this site). For the record, I've never had an authentic Cubano sandwich...my apologies to the purists...I promise to call it a pseudo-Cubano next time I make it. I liked this better than the other recipe on this site that uses a chili mayo and a mint-lime-shallot mayo.

I have been searching for an authentic cuban sandwich in the DC area ever since I had one in NYC. It's just not the same when you make it for yourself. Thanks for the info, Tampa!

I grew up in the Tampa Bay area, and I agree that this isn't authentic but I gave it a shot anyway. I live in Washington DC now, and the best Cubans that I have had since leaving Florida are at Cubano's in Silver Spring, MD (a few miles outside of DC). Definitely worth the trip if you are in the DC area.

To make a real Cubano you do need Cuban bread, roast pork, flavored mayo and the other ingredients. The key to the whole thing is to PRESS the sandwich. If you don't have a press you can cook it in an electric fry pan with a heavy weight on top of the sandwich. An old cast iron skillet will do.

This is pretty close except for the fact that you need cuban bread, sweet virginia ham instead of turkey, and roasted pork that was marinated in mojo (oil, sour orange juice, garlic, and onions). Basically the 3 things that make it a Cuban sandwich. Otherwise it is just another perversion. Oh yeah, and the cheese is swiss cheese.

In Puerto Rico this sandwich is sometimes called a "Cubano Libre" sandwich,since it was originally introduced to that island by Cuban refugees, and while it has been several years since I have had the sandwich, I also agree that turkey is not one of the ingredients. And plain old roast pork and ham will not cut the mustard! Both the pork and the ham are specially seasoned for this sandwich, although after all these years the meats may have become anglicized for the non-Cuban audience. I have searched for years for the proper way of preparing the meats. And also, I do not think that the cheese is Swiss cheese as we know it to be. How I would love to have a real Cubano Libre!

Growing up in Tampa, Florida and having cuban sandwiches regularly, I agree with all before me. It's the bread that also makes it special and I have learned from experience, its hard to duplicate if you don't live in that environment. Ah, to sink my teeth into a "real Cuban sandwich"

Hey, I agree with my cuban friend. If you've ever had a midnight sandwich in Miami you'd agree that this cannot be called a cuban sandwich. But alas, what's in a name anyway. If you want the real deal make it the way he suggests. You'll be so much happier.

the cuban sandwich does not contain turkey it is made with serrano ham,sliced roasted pork,swiss cheese,pickles & mustard on special cuban sandwich bread.to call this sandwich & grilled cubano is some what of an insult to the cuban sandwich.the cuban sandwich is in a class by it self.turkey is not used in any cuban to use turkey should be a sin.
