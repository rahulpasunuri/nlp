OK- after significant mods this turned out delish! zest of one orange, 1/4 cup of soy sauce, 1T. Hoisin sauce, 1/4 cup sesame oil, 4 garlic buds chopped fine, 1 T finely chopped fresh ginger (and I added more). Also added an extra dash or two of red pepper flakes. When I first tried the mix with orange juice and zest, all I could taste was orange. my version turned out amazing. And we used brown rice rice noodle. will make again.

I clipped this recipe from Parade a few years back and just got around to making it. I wish I had read the other reviews before I made this. The recipe was a disappointment. The orange zest was too strong for my taste. We salvaged it by pouring some sweet chili sauce over the chicken and broiled it. Would not make again.

Followed ideas from other reviews, to come up with something really worth keeping! Here is what I did: for the marinade: no zest! used juice of 1 orange, made a little more than called for. I set aside about 3/4-1c. of marinade. Use rest to marinade chicken (use ziploc bag, push all air out, you'll need less marinade). I reduced the marinade I had set aside, to about half. I pan fried the chicken. I made the noodles, and chilled them, added lettuce, red pepper, cucumber, orange pieces, green onion and cilantro, basically a salad. put the warm chicken on top, poured on warm dressing, and sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds. Turned out REALLY yummy. Otherwise, I think this recipe as directed could be bland.

The marinade works great for grilled chicken breasts, so I guess this rating is really only for that part of the recipe. I'm guessing the marinade carmelizes better when grilled than it would in the oven. Have used it a few times this summer and it's a good choice for a crowd - tasty but not so adventurous that you scare off the picky eaters.

This recipe was pretty bad indeed. The orange zest is the only thing I tasted in this recipe  way too overpowering! This chicken was orange with a huge side of bland.

Terrible recipe. Tastes like orange juice poured over chicken. Nothing asian about this at all.

This recipe is nothing special at all.

This is simply delicious. Great flavor and really nice bite. Very easy to prepare: assembled and marinated it the night before; cooked the next night. I served it with rice instead of the noodles. Brought it to work for lunch the next day, and my co-workers were salivating outside of my office hoping for a morsel. You'll love it!
