Loved this salad, although made the following changes. I doubled the amount of bacon, and topped the salad with one over-medium fried egg per person instead of using hardboiled eggs. The flavor combination was delicious.

Loved this salad -- left out the goat cheese and it was still very hearty. Like a riff on the classic French frisee salad with poached egg and lardons.

This was a great departure from the normal healthier salads I tend to make. It was very rich and all of the contrasting flavors went together incredibly well. I also couldn't find escarole but found a mix of hearty greens that contained some and it tasted just fine.

Could not find Escarole at the market, so I substituted it for Romaine. Was good, but not great. Not sure if I'd make it again.
