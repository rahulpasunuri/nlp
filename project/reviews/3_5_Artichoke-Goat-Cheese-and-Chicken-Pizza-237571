Wow. This was a great meal. I added the basil and garlic to the cheese spread, and also put some toasted walnuts, artichoke, sun dried tomatoes (in lieu of the plum) and carmalized onion. Superb. Everyone Raved.

I loved this pizza, I am just starting out trying to cook at home and this was a great recipe to start with. I did make a couple changes, I added a prepackaged pizza red sauce and cut the ricotta to 1/4 cup. I liked the extra taste but I am excited to try the regular recipe with added garlic as is suggested in other reviews. I am also excited to try making my own pizza dough.

This pizza was fabulous but I made some changes. I added minced garlic, italian seasoning and some pepper to the ricotta/goat cheese mixture. I also put fresh spinach, basil, pine nuts, and green onions on the pizza and it was amazing! You can basically add whatever you want! This is something I could eat like once a week!

I gave this recipe four forks, but I've modified it each time I've made it. After reading another member's review of this recipe, I added garlic to the cheese mixture, which adds great flavor. Also, I've never made this recipe with chicken, but I have made it with chicken sausage and also with spinach for a vegetarian pizza (just make sure you drain all the water from the spinach before putting it on the pizza). Both are fantastic. This is definitely a recipe that I will be using often...always gets great reviews from my husband and friends :)

I used low fat ricotta and added some salt and dried basil to the mixture. Was good but not outstanding. Adding garlic sounds like a good idea.

This pizza was pretty good and very easy to make. I used TJ's "almost whole wheat" refrigerated pizza dough. I did make a couple of slight revisions: I used italian seasoning to season the chicken and the cheese mixture; I couldn't get ff ricotta, so I used ff cottage cheese, drained and processed smooth - worked perfectly; added toasted pine nuts and 1/4 cup part skim mozzarella in addition to the parmesan.

This pizza is great. My husband and I made it last night for a friend and we all loved it. We cooked the chicken on the grill. Also, we added about a tablespoon of chopped fresh basil and a large clove of minced garlic to the cheese mixture.

Delicious...I used lowfat ricotta in place of the nonfat...the taste was much better and the increase of fat from calories was not that bad. I also did what one of the other reviewers suggested which was adding finely chopped garlic to the cheese mixture before I spread it on the crust. This recipe is a keeper!

These ingredients do not mesh well together. The goat cheese is too "gamey" and the veggies are not seasoned well enough. We eat healthy veggies and whole wheat goodies all the time in this house, this was a disappointment.

This was not one of my favorites. The cheese was overwhelming and I didn't feel it kept well. Wouldn't make it again.

Love to try new pizzas, this was excellent, the only thing I might do next time is add some crushed garlic to the cheese mixture,because we love garlic, it is not necessary. Had it for breakfast next day, toasted it in toaster oven. was great again.
