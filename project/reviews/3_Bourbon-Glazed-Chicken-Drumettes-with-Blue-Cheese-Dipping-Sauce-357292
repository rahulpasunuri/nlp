As I was making the sauce for these (using much more bourbon as advised by other reviewers) I decided to taste test....it tasted like ketchup! Called my bf over for a second opinion...yep. Just ketchup. I ended up finding a St. Louis BBQ sauce recipe and doctored it up with apple cider vinegar, yellow mustard, more hot sauce and some garlic powder. Much better. But the actual recipe just seemed off.

I call these "Tomato-Pasted Drummettes...oh, did you hear 'Bourbon'?" To call these "glazed" is false advertising--they were unappealingly thick and sticky, and the Bourbon was undetectable. The chicken proved tender and flavorful, so I'll use this marinating technique again; but the sauce, for all its ingredients, was a snooze flavor-wise. To those who reviewed that their sauce wasn't hot: use Tapatio--it was the only nice thing about this recipe. Total waste of Bourbon.

These are great - used Jack Daniels. Here are my suggestions: I used more bourbon (about 1-1/2 cups total), I also added a splash of bourbon to the marinade prior to coating wings. Definitely marinate them overnight or don't even waste your time. I also added cayenne pepper and extra hot sauce. Then I grilled them to added more smokey flavor and basted them with extra marinate. Served them at Super Bowl and everyone loved them.

I made this last Super Bowl weekend as well. Marinated the chicken overnight. Used a little more bourbon than called for. I also used both wings and drumettes. It wasn't at all spicy, considering how much hot sauce the recipe called for. Tasty, but not outstanding. The best thing about this recipe is that the marinade really kept the chicken moist. I cooked the chicken for an hour and it still came out really tender. I also made the blue cheese dip, it was O.K. Used the leftovers as a salad dressing.

This recipe was easy and good. Finding the party wings/drumettes was a different story. Marinated 2 days instead of overnight. Chicken was flavorful and tender! Increased the bourbon and brown sugar. I did not make the dipping sauce, and it certainly did not need it. This recipe is a keeper.

We thought it was very tasty. I halved the recipe and used whole chicken wings. Didn't have time to make the dipping sauce and used bottled blue cheese dressing, but it was better without. I think I may try using more bourbon next time.

Great recipe! I made these for a Superbowl party, and they were a hit! However, I did make a few changes to the recipe. I used 3/4 cup ketchup, 2 extra tablespoons of hot sauce, and 2 extra tablespoons of brown sugar to give them more of a sweet/spicy flavor. Definitely marinate the wings overnight for best flavor. Also, I would agree to use a bbq sauce in replace of ketchup. This is a great base recipe. You could really add/change anything to give them different flavors.

Boring, really. I was expecting something with more complex flavor, but it was pretty ordinary. The recipe did work, so I'd use that method again but not the marinade. The dipping sauce was OK, but nothing special

Great recipe! The wings have exceptional flavor -- probably from marinating overnight. A bit of a kick, but not too spicy. Even my 18- month old son loved these! The recipe made a lot of wings, so we thought we'd have leftovers, but they were gone before we knew it. I also like that these are baked, not fried (like traditional buffalo wings).

I just made this for a super bowl party. I didn't have time to let the wings marinate overnight, so I'll do that differently next time. The sauce is very good, though I may tone down the ketchup/tomato paste and substitute more of a smokey BBQ with the hot sauce and bourbon. Also, I made the blue cheese dipping sauce with cilantro instead of parsley. Yumm-o. Will definitely make this again.
