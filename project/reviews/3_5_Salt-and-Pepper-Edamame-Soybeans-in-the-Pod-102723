I began making edaname with this recipe but I now add ground Chipolte chilis, garlic powder and a four-peppercorn blend. It makes a much spicier version that people easily become addicted to. People flip over it!!!

I was first introduced to this dish in Horagane, Japan on a farm belonging to my friends family. I eat it as a snack like you would peanuts, pretzles or chips with a soda or a beer or a glass of wine. Healthy, low-cal, and delicious!

Edamame may be acquired taste, but it's one that all the kids on our street have become obsessed with! It's not something I would have guessed would please kids, but there you have it. The frozen ones at organic markets are quite good also.

I prefer using a little teriyaki sauce with the edaname in addition to a little salt. The taste for edaname is definitely an acquired one.
