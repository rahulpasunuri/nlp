Great, used homemade broth and spinach. We don't discard the cheese rinds-it is considered a treat to be able to chew away the soften cheese and something that gets fought over-although not when company is around. Also use rinds in tomato sauces.

Great. Easy. I finally used all my Parmesan rinds. And if you don't have a million Parmesan rinds lurking in your fridge, then you aren't a good enough lover of Parmesan.

One of my favorite new recipes - perfect for when you want something special that takes very little effort. Living in Italy, I may have an advantage in that I can easily buy hand- made tortellini and that parmesan is cheap, but I imagine this would be just as good in the US! Like a previous reviewer noted, the broth and parmesan add to the salt content quite a bit, so be sure to sample before serving in case it needs to have some water added to even out the flavor a bit.

This is a great simple recipe for a lazy night. I used fresh torn basil and sub vegi broth. Yum!

This is excellent, and very easy! Wonderful flavor, have made it twice now and will definitely make it again.

Delicious. Also used the small imported tortelloni -- nicely mouth- sized, and homemade chichen broth. You can't beat the homemade stuff! One tip: I save the rinds of all my hard cheeses in the freezer. Then when I need to add some flavor to a sauce or a soup, like this one, I don't have to buy anything new, and there is no waste.

this soup visits our table frequently because it is delicious, cheap and quick to make. Make sure to use a rich dark stock, or even try a boullion cube - the dark color sets off the light color of the torellini and is beautiful and richer in flavor.

well, my hubby ate it because he was starving... I took two bites and then made myself a pb&j. It tasted like it came out of a can... or like something you'd eat at Olive Garden on a bad day. Quick & easy- yes. Cheap - no (wedge of parm cost me nearly $10!). Will not make this again.

Every time I make this recipe I get rave reviews - it's one of my fiance's frequent requests - he's an amazing chef and there are few recipes of mine that really impress him - this is one of them!

Very tasty soup...I liked it a lot. Easy to make, but not cheap. Made the chicken broth from scratch a few days before and it really made the difference. Recommended!

Delicious. Absolute comfort food. Spinach is good, but I've also used red chard, which is very tasty.

So easy to make & quite delicious! One thing to note is watch the amount of salt added as the chicken broth & the cheese already adds a bit of saltiness to the broth when simmering.

Super fast & easy. Used frozen three-cheese tortellini and added extra garlic in broth. Very tasty.

Fabulous and so easy! I simmered the broth longer than called for and it was delightful.

Fast and delicious! I used the imported dried tortellini, which are smaller. When I added the spinach, I added some poached shredded chicken.

This was very tasty & easy. I made it into a main course by adding pieces of roasted chicken. I also added a handful of chopped basil. Add a side salad & maybe Italian bread. The family ate it well. So, that is always a good recommendation.
