I thought the sauce was a bit thin, lacking in richness. I added quite a bit of cream... almost doubled it. This was an easy sauce to make. The next time I would probably decrease the amount of water to one tablespoon rather than two and bump up the cream another 1/8 cup.

A very easy sauce and it makes just the right amount.
