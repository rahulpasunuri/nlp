This was easy and delicious! It was cold out, so I just sauted the marinated shrimp quickly and served them over "Mexican Chopped Salad with Honey-Lime Dressing" ...a recipe also on this site that my husband and I both loved.

OH MY ! Amazing! Didn't have dried hot red pepper flakes, didn't use chili powder = red thai paste worked just fine. Didn't broil shrimp, just threw them and the marinade in teh fry pan for 30 sec at hot heat - this is so going to be a summer favorite for quite some time - Just excellent!!!

I made this for a dinner party along with a spinach salad with bacon,pears, red peppers, shallots and asiago cheese. The two went perfectly together. I followed the advice of other reviewers and marinated longer (about 3 hours). I increased the chili powder by 1/2 -- would probably double the next time as suggested by another reviewer. Served it over brown rice and it looked and tasted amazing.

Due to a soy allergy, I substituted the soy with balsamic vinegar and molasses. (2 part vinegar to 1 part molasses). It really gave it a nice punch. I have made it both ways but prefer it with the substitution. (Both ways are awesome, however)

Everything about this recipe was delicious. Easy to make and the marinade is gorgeous.

This recipe is great!! Easy, fast, and universal. I actually serve it with tortillas for shrimp tacos. The marinade works well with fish and with fish tacos too. YUM!!

Very good. Will make this again for sure. Fast and easy. Used Asian Chili Garlic Sauce instead of chili powder and turned out great.

I love this recipe--have made it many times and always with great reviews! I have used raw shrimp and pre-cooked/have both broiled and fried it and all with good results. I toss it with angel hair pasta....or eat it straight out of the pan!

greeat everyday dish, I love the combination of chili and lime. I added extra red pepper flakes to give it a little extra kick, and served with basmati rice and a cucumber salad. yum. will definitely make this again.

I marinated the shrimp overnight and they were very tasty. I love avocado but it didn't add to the shrimp so I will make it without next time. This would be great barbecued. And as others said very easy to make.

I really liked this recipe. It's a wonderfully refreshing summer dish that appealed to everyone in my family-even my fussy 6 year old. We actually served it in a wrap, which my boys enjoyed. Definitely a keeper.

I make this all of the time, especially when we have company. Everyone always asks for the recipe. Its so easy to make. I leave out the coriander because I HATE it. I also use fresh lime juice at the end instead of lemon juice. It tastes great over Basmati rice.

This recipe is delicious and has the added bonus of being quick and easy to make. I serve it over rice. The only hassle with it is that I have to plan 3 days ahead since, living in Canada, it takes that long for the avocado to ripen.

I think that reviewers who make the recipe incorrectly (i.e. with Japanese peppers they are really not very knowledgeable about, and w/o cilantro, which to many dishes is THE ingredient that makes the dish), should not rate the recipe as "not so good". The recipe is fine (delicious, actually), it's maybe the cook that is "not so good".

Rating: 4
This is a family staple. We LOVE it. I make it whenever we have company because its so easy and exotic, and the company always asks for the recipe. I make it at least once a week at my husband's request. I'm one of those people who HATES coriander. So, I left it out completely. I replaced the lemon juice with more lime juice at the end.

Rating: 2
Pretty good but not great. Perhaps it would have been better if I could have found cilantro to go with it. Also, if you happen to be using Japanese crushed chili peppers, don't use too much! I added a teaspoon extra thinking they were similar to what I would buy in the States and it was so spicy we needed jugs of water to down with it! Hopefully next time I make it the results will be better.

This is such an easy dish to prepare. My guy actually begs me to make this every week. More avocado is a good idea and in a pinch I use ground or crushed dry coriander when fresh is not available and the flavor is still quite nice.

Rating: 3
Super quick and easy and very flavorful. Great over jasmine rice. Skewering the shrimp is a great tip to make turning quick and easy. Don't over marinate or you'll ruin the shrimp texture. Double or enhance the spices. Consider adding banana or something sweet to off-set the tang and extra heat if you use it.

I am rating the recipe as written. A little bland. The flavors are delicious but I might marinate a little longer next time and also add more garlic. Very healthy recipe. I ate it with brown rice. Will make it again.

This is not a mexican recipe at all!!!! Chilli is more a US dish than a mexican one.

Wow! I wasn't sure about the soy sauce and brown sugar with the cilantro, but it was terrific. My husband & I absolutely loved this recipe. I doubled the chili powder as many suggested and used only lime juice (no lemon juice). Served it over plain jasmine rice. DELICIOUS, FAST & EASY.

This recipe has become a family favorite. We serve it over rice. Its easy to make and looks like a million bucks. I add more avocados and more red pepper for a little more heat. As written, its not all that hot. Don't make extra for leftovers...the cilantro wilts and the avocadoes turn brown. Plan to eat what you make.

Tasty and easy! I doubled the chili powder and the flakes. Another reviewer suggested making the Basic Flour Tortilla with this dish - great advice! Our guest was impressed with the simplicity and flavour of the meal.

Very easy to make!, I put the shrimp on bamboo skewers to make it easy to turn them in the broiler, and I did notuse coliander but used cilantro like everyone else said and ate the dish with brown jasmine rice it was delicious!

Yummy! I grilled instead of broiled and it was absolutely superb. I might add more spices and use less soy sauce next time, I thought the soy sauce was a little bit too overwhelming.

This was a good recipe, although I was expecting it to be a little more spicy, and it wasn't spicy at all - I would add more chilis next time. I was pleasantly surprised with the shrimp/avocado combination, it was really good!

What a great dinner this was! I served the shrimp and avocado in a salad with balsamic vinaigrette, and it was absolutely delicious. I left out the cilantro entirely because people in my house don't care for it, and I don't feel that we missed it at all. The only modification I would make next time is to kick up the heat a little more, as the shrimp were flavorful but not too spicy.

Rating: 4
What an easy-to-make and yummy dish! I did it pretty much according to the recipe, but tossed the cubed avocado in lime juice (to keep it from turning brown, and to separate the pieces) then tossed that in with the shrimp mixture before serving. I used all lime juice (no lemon) and also included a couple of sea scallops, which I sliced horizontally before broiling.

After reading the reviews of others, I added black beans to the shrimp/marinade and broiled this. Once cooled slightly, I added the avocado mix and served over corn tortillas. This was easy and quite good. Next time I will add more chopped coriander and increase the spiciness.

Flavorful and easy. Next time I will serve on top of baked tortillas for more substance. I love how light this recipe is! Great recipe for everyday dinners or lunches

Rating: 4
This was wonderful and so simple, not to mention light and fairly healthy! I added an extra clove of garlic, doubled the amount of cilantro, and used only lime juice. Since we didn't have chili powder or red pepper flakes on hand, I substituted with 2 teaspoons of Sriracha, an Asian chili sauce found in most supermarkets. It was the perfect amount of spiciness. I also marinated the shrimp for 30 minutes instead of 15, then broiled them in the toaster oven, and dinner was ready in about 45 minutes. I served it with tortillas made from the Basic Flour Tortilla recipe found on Epicurious (also very fast and simple...made them while the shrimp were marinating). My boyfriend and I loved it!

This recipe is one of my husband's new favorites! I will say that I did change the preparation a bit, instead of tossing the awesome marinade, I poured the sauce and the shrimp into a casserole dish and then broiled it. We also served it with store-bought coconut ginger rice. Great combination!

I am so glad to find this recipe again, after losing the issue of Gourmet which had it. I am sensitive to chili pepper, so I only use a hint of chili powder and no red pepper flakes, but it works for me and my friends with New England palates.

i love all the ingredients of this recipe and so i decided to give it a try... delicious. and not only that, but it's a quick and easy meal. i served this over yellow rice; it went very well. next time i may try using low sodium soy sauce. and i would spice it up more by adding additional amounts of red pepper flakes (i love spicy foods). other than that, i don't think that i would make any other adjustments.

We LIKED, but didn't love, so by definition, we give it a 2. However we will make some version again. -A bit unusual for our palates, combining hot/warm shrimp with avocado. Also, the shrimp didn't "take" the marinade (too dense a protein maybe.) I'd try it all again substituting shrimp with a more permeable chicken, scallops, salmon, etc for enjoying the DELICIOUS CHILI-LIME MARINADE; -something that would soak up the vibrant, spicy flavor better. Could use tofu for a vegetarian alternative.) We served with rice, steamed broccoli, and orange slices. Might consider adding toasted almond slivers. Also, may sub parsley for cilantro. (Hummm... will probably eat the leftovers cold -maybe over bibb lettuce or spinach- as, again, I can't quite see heating the avocado.) Did we mention that we LOVED the chili-lime marinade?!

I've made this many times since it was published in 1997. All I have to say is I love it. Everytime a winner. I serve it with mesclun greens (raspberry chili vinagrette) with crispy polenta, and an open faced jalapeno, jack, tomato, cilantro quesadilla. Yum.

I've made this several times and it is always the same: wonderful! Absolutely terrific on a grill, and great to make in LA when avocados & limes are plentiful. Lord knows why they call it coriander, tho - make sure to use fresh cilantro.

Very savory! We used skewers as well which helped. We only had dried coriander on hand and it was still okay...will definitely make it again.

Yum! We loved this recipe. I bought smaller shrimp, to save money. So grilling them would have been hard. Instead, I put them in a hot oven, still in their marinade, and cooked them till they curled up a bit. Then drained the marinade and proceeded. It was incredibly flavorful. Served with rice and black beans.

Great recipe! I put shrimp on skewers to make it easier to turn. Also, I used lime juice in lieu of lemon juice. The combination of adding to avocado sounded a bit unusual - but it was wonderful. Served with rice and green peas.

This is an outstanding recipe. I have made it numerous times so it was not a fluke. I love to substitute 1/2 the shrimp for some sea scallops, making it a great seafood combination. Also, add some black beans and you have a full meal. I like it spicy and go wild with the red pepper!
