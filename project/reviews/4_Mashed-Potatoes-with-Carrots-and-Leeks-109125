This was good, but didn't overly impress me. I've had this dish in Belgian restaurants, and there's something missing from this recipe. Nutmeg or something. Or maybe you need the good European butter.

This was very tasty and quick to make, even though I'm not a big fan of cooked carrots. Next time, I might add some sautéed, chopped cabbage to make it more like the "stoempf" I had in Brussels recently.

I was a little skeptical about the texture of the chopped carrots in the mashed potatoes, but this recipe is wonderful! I made it for Christmas, then make it again just a wk or two later just for a mid week dinner. The buttery flavor of leeks made the potatoes rich and delicious. I used fat free half & half instead of whole milk - definitely a keeper.

I loved this recipe. Easy to make too. My husband wants his potatoes the simple way, he said this was good but he wants them the way he wants them. I will make this for friends and family when they come. Yummy

I loved this dish. I was glad to read the reviews first as it is especially important not to over mash. I added garlic and goat cheese!

Simple and gorgeous. I often serve this with a hunk of meat and a veggie when I'm feeling traditional. Everyone always thinks it's so novel to stir veggies into the mash.

This dish always receives raves whenever I make it. Yesterday, I substituted parsnip for one of the carrots and it was just as delicious. I also used two leeks, which enhanced the flavor..

The leeks made the diffrence with their fragrance. I used two leeks; probably for the better.

this was delicious. be sure to not overly mash the potatoes. i left the mashing to my flatmate, and she was a bit too vigorous and it became a bit gluey. i used skim milk, because it was what i had, and i think it was still fine.

Good, took longer than advertised, next time I will use two leeks. Since I made it ahead, I put the mashed potatoes in a 9 inch Pyrex and dotted it with butter. I heated it up at 375 uncovered and it made a nice brownish crust on top.

This recipe was very easy, yet for the small amount of extra time you put in you really take regular mashed potatoes the extra mile. To add some extra texture I leave the skins on my mashed potatoes, just make sure you're not using russets. Very yummy!!

I having been making 'stoemp'for a long time using only one pot. I start off by frying pieces of bacon, then I add the leeks (and occasionally Belgian endive) and sweat them off, then I add the potatoes, carrots and water, etc. So you only need one pot, much easier.

One of the easiest and best potato dishes I have found-underlining easy. Can make at least a day in advance and be done with it. As simple as it is, it is also unusual - the texture of carrots with the smoothness of the potatos. Leave carrots chunkier than the recipe says.

Extremely tasty, easy to make, very nice texture. Not elegant by any means, but very good. I think I'll use the leftovers to make a shepards pie!

This is great! It's unusual, but oh so good! I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it. I made it ahead of time and just re-warmed it in the microwave. And the leftovers were even better the next day. I think the flavors blended more. I told my vegetarian friend about the recipe. She made it for dinner one night, and said that it was a real hit with her husband. This is a real keeper!

Great flavor! I cooked the carrots with the potatoes in the last 8 minutes of cook time and coarsely mashed them together before adding the leeks.
