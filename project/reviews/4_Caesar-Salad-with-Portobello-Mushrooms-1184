I'm about to make this for the second time in a week -- my husband can't get enough of it.

Outstanding. Please do not be afraid of the anchovies! It makes the dressing tastier without any fishy taste what so ever.

It was a tasty salad and the mushrooms added the right amount of texture and flavor to make it just right. We omitted the anchovies but didn't seem to miss it. The dressing was good -- not the best ever as another chef noted. Will definately make again and again!

made the dressing as directed except reduced the anchovies by 2. Used freshly grated parm and mixed in, also served some on top. Everyone loved it. Even 8 yr old. Read More http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/foo d/notes/Caesar-Salad-with-Portobello- Mushrooms-1184#ixzz0uLZC0txi

This is one of the best salads I've ever made.

Delicious! I added the sauteed garlic to the salad for extra flavor and skipped the anchovies. One of the best salads I've eaten, even my carnivorous partner was jealous!

Grilled Portabello mushrooms help make this a perfect side dish for a Bar-B-Que, my guests loved it.

This was quite good in itself, but not really like a Caesar Salad. We made a meal out of it along with French bread. I really enjoyed the mushrooms.

A big success at my last get-together; the creamy/cheesy version has become so ubiquitous in restaurants that many guests were pleasantly surprised at the lemony tang of a more authentic caesar. The recipe does not use Worcestershire and I didn't miss it. I used a potato peeler to shave off pieces of Parmesan cheese and tossed in whole wheat croutons (store bought). I will definitely be making this again.

I USE THIS AS MY EVERY DAY CAESAR DRESSING. IT IS ALWAYS A HIT, AND I AM A CAESAR FREAK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I MAKE MY OWN CROUTONS WITH RYE OR PUMPERNICKEL BREAD WITH BUTTER AND GARLIC. AWESOME.
