Fried pasta? What fried pasta? Where did this come from? I destroyed the original recipe by adding carmalized onions, basil instead of the parsley, and toasted pine nuts. Yummy. But is my rating for the recipe or for "my" recipe?

Made this and loved it! Only deviated from the recipe slightly: -Used rotini instead of penne pasta. -Added one sliced red onion to the grilled veggies (seemed natural) -In addition to parsley (dried, unfortunately) I added some basil, marjoram and a tat extra ground black pepper. -Since we didn't have the cheese called for, just used "shaker cheese" (Parmesan cheese often used on spaghetti/pizza) and it came out very well! I grilled all of the veggies on a Foreman grill, but instead of spraying, I brushed on olive oil. If you go the route I did, you will likely need 1/2 cup olive oil total. I tried the panfry method described by other reviewers, but my noodles stuck. So I scraped them off the bottom, added everything else very quickly, stirred until it was nicely warmed and removed from heat. I'm ok with experimentation unless it ruins dinner ;p The only thing I didn't do was attempt to grill garlic cloves. The house smelled wonderful! I highly recommend this for people who like light Italian dishes that give them a chance to play with seasonings. This dish is very basic to begin with and it is very easy to customize and personalize so that you wind up with something that is both unique and different!

I fried the pasta after cooking it as directed by a reviewer and liked it, as did my husband. Grilled the veggies on our outdoor barbeque and let them get a little too done, but the taste was good. Added extra garlic while the pasta was frying. May add more veggies such as squash and onions next time as suggested, but with the original ingredients it was still quite good.

Just a question. I don´t find anything about fried pasta in the original recipe. How did those of you liked it, prepare it? Here in Ecuador, often dry, raw bowtie pasta is dry fried in a pan before it is boiled. But I see on the web a process of deep frying...

While I like all the individual components, I didn't like all the combination. Honestly I think it was the fried pasta that I didn't care for. It was a weird textural component that just didn't work for me. It was a distraction as opposed to a complement to the eggplant. I do like fried pasta, but it really ruined this dish for me.

I thought this recipe was absolutely delicious. My husband and I love eggplant and so I thought this would be a good recipe to try. I turned out awesome! It's so nice to have a pasta dish that does not require a tomato based sauce.

I made this as described in one of the reviews with the marinated chicken and red onion and yellow squash and it was delicious. The only change I made was to add a little garlic salt to the chicken/olive oil/balsamic vinegar combo.

This is an awesome recipe!!!! I added grilled bermuda onions, yellow squash and grilled chicken all marinated in olive oil and balsamic vinegar first. I used sundried tomatoes instead of grilled fresh tomatoes, and used whole wheat pasta. This turned out so awesome, and very healthy! This will definetly be a regular dish on my menu!!!

This is a very interesting and delicious recipe when everyone's suggestions are used. I did almost everything fellow cooks suggested and the outcome was exquisite: used just less than a pound of left-over eggplant and threw it and a pound of halved grape tomatoes on my stove-top grill. Mixture was too liquidy to char but the flavors deepened very satisfyingly. Fried the ziti in a couple tablespoons olive oil for a delightfully different texture for the pasta portion -- this strategy works exceedingly well with this earthy sauce. Added twice the garlic and chopped capers to the sauce, also superb. Then sprinkled the whole thing with toasted pine nuts, which, though even a tad burnt due to my roving eye, completed the dish perfectly. This recipe takes a bit of work but it's well worth it. Thanks for the excellent suggestions, all!

I made this with the pan fried penne suggestion with the addition of the pressed garlic to the olive oil which greatly increased the flavor. I also added a tablespoon of chopped capers. The family loved it. Terrific on a hot summer night!

This is a great, simple recipe. I added a grilled red onion, and before grilling, tossed all the vegetables in olive oil with salt and pepper. When the veggies were done, I cooled them in the same bowl, and then added all the juices and excess oil to the pasta instead of adding new oil. Yumm!

This was pretty good but better the second day... flavors needed to mesh a bit. Lots of good quality romano helps, otherwise a bit bland n'boring.

I found the secret to turn this dish from just an "ok" dish into something amazing. After cooking and draining the pasta very well, heat about 2-3 tablespoons olive oil in a heavy large skillet over high heat. Add pasta and fry it until the edges start to really crisp at the edges, stirring frequently, about 10 minutes. Let the edges get pretty brown and crisp, some almost looking burned...it's ok. The flavor will be magnificent! After frying, put in bowl and toss in remaining ingredients. I also added about 1/4 cup toasted pine-nuts. This just really put the finishing touches on this dish! I also think that grilling the eggplant and tomatoes adds lots of flavor. I loved the fact I could grill the vegetables in the afternoon, save and just throw everything together at the last minute. Everyone in my household went nuts over this dish. Will make it again, and again!! Really, try frying the pasta......it changes the taste and texture completely and you will be hooked!

I also brushed both tomato & eggplant with good olive oil before broiling (alas, no grill handy).

This was quite good and easy to make. I did the eggplant and tomatoes under the broiler, and I think it lost something for the recipe. Would definitely make it again, but do the veggies on a grill. Also doubled the garlic, which I think helped a bit. This would make a great picnic dish.

Both my husband and I were very disappointed in this. Would not make it again!

With our weekly foray into the open air market of Jerusalem for fresh eggplant and tomatoes, this recipe has become a staple in our house. We use the broiler instead of grilling, watching the eggplant (with olive oil instead of spray) carefully to avoid overcharring and dividing firm tomatoes into quarters instead of halves (they sometimes get a little mushy, but they still taste great). This recipe turned my husband into an eggplant eater!

Very easy to make. It didn't take any time at all. If you need an easy and quick dinner, wwhen working late, make some pasta with a different twist.

This recipe is one of our favorites to prepare for guests. It is easily doubled or tripled, and we never tire of it. We recommend brushing olive oil on the eggplant and tomato as opposed to using a spray. Also make sure to adequately salt the eggplant slices as this tempers their bitterness. This recipe makes for great leftovers, such as a next-day lunch at the office.
