I wasn't crazy about the flavor. Listening to other reviewers, I cut back to half the sugar; it seemed too sour/vinegary and too salty for me. My husband liked it better than I did. I doubled the red pepper, but it still wasn't hot. If I make it again, I'm going to triple the red pepper and try doing the sugar as written, but I don't really have high hopes for this one.

This is a good recipe for a weekday lunch and it is pretty much like other stir fry recipes. I used a 3/4 tbsp of palm sugar and 1/4 tsp dried crushed pepper (with few seeds) and came out well balanced. I am very sensitive for hot spices and I guess would be fine if I had added all the seeds from the dry pepper (because my husband grows peppers, I picked one and crushed it freshly). I also added much more ginger (+/- 2,5 tbsp). Because I am a pesctarian, I used vegetable broth, which I think it is much better to use with shrimp anyways. I didn't have snow peas, so used broccoli instead and also added red bell pepper.

I made the mistake of using frozen uncooked shrimp, which made this much more watery than it probably should have been. Other than that, I pretty much followed the recipe, though I used snap peas instead of snow peas as a matter of personal preference. I also added extra red pepper, as we like things a bit spicier. Easy and tasty, good weeknight dinner.

I added extra shrimp and was generous with all the seasonings, while skimping on the sugar, and it got rave reviews.

Absolutely delicious! Doubled (at least) crushed red pepper, cut vinegar in half, used 1TB honey instead of sugar. Used only 1/2lb. of shrimp, so this made a lot of extra sauce, great with jasmine rice. will DEFINITELY make this again.

Really was disappointed in this one, but that's what I get for not reading all the reviews. The dish was a definitely sweet-n-sour type and heavy-handed, with a cloying sauce that both overwhelmed and under emphasized the shrimp at the same time. If I made this again, I would definitely leave out (or radically cut) the sugar & vinegar, increase the garlic & ginger (but then it would be a different dish, right?) and put the veges in more towards the end of cooking time.

I also thought this was a great blend of flavors of sweet and spicy but I only used just over 1Tbsp of sugar. Add more cayenne if you like heat. This is not at all like a hot and sour/sweet and sour. My parents thought this was better than any nice asian restaurant style of a simalar flavor but you need to cut back on the sugar and add heat to your taste. I used red or green peppers instead of peas.

Have made this for my boyfriend and we loved it! Can also be made with chicken in place of shrimp.

This was my first attempt at Asian cuisine using a recipe, and being a ginger and garlic lover, I thought this one was perfect. Unfortunately, the rice vinegar and sugar seem to transform the dish with a rich sweet and sour flavor. If you like sweet and sour flavor, this is great. If not, keep looking!

Excellent dish. Quick and easy to make and tastes wonderful. I used fresh red chili peppers to add more heat. Great balance between spicy and sweet. I almost considered leaving out the sugar, but I'm glad I didn't. Wonderful over Jasmine rice.

Wonderful, I used a lot more hot pepper, more sesame oil, and no sugar.

Overall a nice simple dish. But I added extra red pepper and reduced the sugar to make the flavor more bright. Next time, I'll double the sauce and serve over ramen noodles. I think it would make a great soup.

I agree with the cook from Birmingham... This recipe is lackluster. I helped it out after our first try with substitutions of d'arbol chiles for the red peppers and sugar snap peas, but overall, cheap. Like average take-out. Shoot somewhere else.

I used regular green beans instead of snow peas which gave the recipe some heft. I enjoyed it with seasoned rice. I'll be making it as an appetizer for Christmas eve. We get pretty fancy around here.

This has become one of our staples. Very, very easy and very good. I've used different vegetables, thrown on a few cashews, but basically follow the recipe.

I totally agree with the reviewer below. Edible but uninspiring like a cheap chinese takeout dish. There are far better recipes for using shrimp.

Well it looks like I'm the only one who wasn't thrilled with this recipe. We found the sauce to be way too sweet, with barely any heat to it at all, and this was after following the recipe exactly. It was more of a sweet-and-sour taste than anything else. What a waste of $10 of beautiful jumbo shrimp. I have several stir fry recipes that are so much better than this one.

This is very good and very easy to make. If you want sauce to pour over the rice, double the sauce quantities. I recommend adding asparagus, too.

Delicious! Substitued blanched fresh asparagus cut into thirds for the snow peas. Very easy to prepare. Definately will make again.

We were surprised by how good this was - both spicy and sweet, and very authentic tasting. Instead of the green onions and snow peas, we bought a frozen bag of stir-fry vegetables (with carrots, snow peas, mushrooms, onions). Will definitely make again - next time, might try with chicken!

My family loves this recipe. It's easy to cook. I often use sugar snap peas (which we prefer to snow peas) and sometimes add the red pepper, but this is one recipe that I (an improvisational cook, usually)don't think needs much tinkering.

We never made the entire recipe, however we have used the Marinated shrimp portion. The marinade we used the first six ingredients, then after marinating we sautéed in olive oil just until tender. We have served them over mixed field green with balsamic vinaigrette or as an appetizer with a mango red onion salsa. The possibilities are endless.

While surprisingly spicy, this dish had a wonderful blend of flavors. The amounts of the ingredients are perfect, and this dish excellent for those who love hot foods.

I've made this a couple of times it's very good. Here are my suggestions... I added 1 can of straw mushrooms and served it on linguine. I found that the recipe makes tons of liquid that doesn't boil down in 1 min. as it says. I also cut back on the sugar. you don't need 2 tbsp. - 1 will do.
