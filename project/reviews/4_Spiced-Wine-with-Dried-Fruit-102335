This is such a good recipe and huge hit! I can't wait to make it again. I think it's much better than the stuff you get in Switzerland.

Vin Chaud (in French): this recipe was easy and turned out very well. I liked making the vin chaud with white wine and used a cheap sauvignon (2 buck Chuck). Everyone really liked it. I also added almost double the rum as I was probably drinking while making it. Instead of using Orange juice, I used frozen concentrate and just spooned it in. The perfect winter party drink!
