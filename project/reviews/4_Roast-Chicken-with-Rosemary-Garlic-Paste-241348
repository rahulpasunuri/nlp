This was my first whole roasted chicken. It was a lot easier than I anticipated. I brined it before-hand in 1 qt water, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup salt, 1 tsp peppercorns and 1 bay leaf for an hour and a half before roasting. The chicken was super-moist. I put in a few yukon gold potatoes with the chicken. I also roasted on top of a few slices of lemon. This made the thigh pieces a little too lemony.. too sour. I think I will skip the lemons next time. This recipe was super easy and super yummy! I highly recommend it.

The first time I made this was for company, and I've made it countless times since. Easy, delicious and the skin gets nice and crispy, which I love.

1 & 1/2 hours was too much for a 5 lb bird. Cooked out a lot of the juice. Otherwise fine.

Really terrific. In my experience, feel free to increase the quantity of whatever you like in the rub. e.g. more rosemary and salt :-) Works better with Whole Foods air-chilled free-range chicken than with the organic. Juicier. Add to the roasting pan a layer of cubed root veggies (turnips, rutabagas, gold/red beets) plus some carrots and brussel sprouts. Add 1/2" chicken stock to the pan and roast uncovered, no basting.

This has become a family favorite at our house. Simple and delicious! I make a bit more of the rub than it calls for, but otherwise I stick to the recipe. I really can't find a way to improve it!

This was really easy to make except I had some trouble grinding up the rosemary paste. I don't own a mortar and pestle so I tried mixing it in my normal-sized food processor. The rosemary just got flung to the outside edges and didn't get ground up, so I ended up having to use my coffee grinder! Other than that, this recipe was really easy and delicious!

I made this tonight, and everyone liked it. I thought it was OK, but not exceptional. I was looking for the best chicken recipe ever, and this was good, but it was not it. I might make this again, but I am still searching for something better.

Simply stated - this was fabulous! I didn't have juniper berries - so I substuted a generous teaspoon of Gin (sans the tonic). Definately a "do again".

I brined my grain fed capon for 1.5 hours, rinsed it, dried it well and applied the paste. I would make twice the amount of paste next time (and I used a 4 lb bird), add some pepperoncini and use 5 cloves of garlic instead of 4. Baste the bird during baking. Check your bird 20-30 minutes before it is supposed to be cooked. I found my capon was very ready at 1 1/4 hours. The brining may be responsible for the juiciness of this dish, but in any case, this recipe is a keeper. Served it on a bed of arugula and mesclun with some dressing (juices of the capon with some fresh lemon juice) - rave reviews. Every time I roast a chicken I use this high heat/shorter roasting time method with consistently great outcomes.

This recipe is in the regular rotation in my house. Love it! Butterflying the chicken is key, cooks much faster and allows you to impart lots of flavor by getting the rub on the bone side. I usually double the rub and sometimes add a bit of grainy Dijon mustard. It is just as good with dried Rosemary. Actually sometimes I prefer dried Rosemary over fresh for some recipes - not as perfumey. Perfect with your favorite creamy mashed potatoes recipe.

Easy and delicious. Just a note to Joel about the so called "normal" feed. It often includes the ground up beaks of the chicken's slaughtered brethren. Organic, vegetarian fed is the way to go if you like clean food.

I'm sorry but I think a little fact checking needs to be done. First fact, fat content does contribute to a more "juicy" chicken but it contributes more toward the tenderness of the meat. Second fact, bone density, muscle density and marrow content are bigger factors of juicy chickens. It is also fact that FREE RANGE, often organic, chickens have higher muscle density and bone density contributing to a more "juicy" chicken, also contributing to longer cooking time. Bottom line, FREE RANGE chickens are better tasting and treated more humanely.

I usually brine whatever chicken, game hen, or quail I'm cooking for 1-2 hours before I season and cook it. There's no better way to make a bird moist, provided you don't overcook it.

This recipe is good. However, it calls for an 'organic' chicken stating matter-of-factly that it will be juicier than one that is otherwise. My personal experience in preparing both organic and non-organic fowl has not born out the statement. In fact, after 35 years in the kitchen using both types of chicken I find that reliable juiciness comes more often from non-organic chickens combined with the proper roasting technique.

Trust me when I tell you, I cannot cook!!!! This recipe was phenomenal and easy to follow. I got rave reviews from my boyfriend who is very apprehensive when it comes to me trying new recipes. When I cooked this meal, I used a whole chicken. To make the meal more interesting, I cut up red potatoes, added the herb mixture to them and then stuffed it in the chicken. I also put some of the left over potatoes around the outside of the chicken. I basted the chicken every so often and let the oven do the rest. DELICIOUS!!!

We were a bit disappointed-chicken wasnt all that juicy and even tho the paste should have taken care of boosting flavor, it didnt knock our socks off. Followed recipe inc juniper berries. I do love to butterfly and roast chicken so will keep searching.

What a great way to roast a chicken. It was so moist and flavorful. I added lemons as was suggested and it really goes well with the rosemary. I reduced the sauce made by the chicken and made a gravy. Wished I had made potatoes with it as my family loved the gravy.

This was SO easy to make and everyone liked it. I'm glad I made two whole chickens!

Great recipe. Made without the juniper berries. In a convection oven with a whole chicken cut up, took about 45 minutes to reach 170 degrees temperature. My husband was trying to extract every ounce of chicken off the bone.

This is the best way to cook chicken I've found yet. It all works. Don't change a thing. People swoon. Seriously

Easy and delicious. Used a 3.5lb organic chicken but made the same amount of rosemary paste as the recipe (minus the juniper berries). Also took a small lemon and put some slices underneath the chicken with the rosemary sprigs. Took a little over an hour to roast and was delicious and moist. Easy to do and will definitely make again!

Wow. What a fantastic dish. I made this as a kid-friendly Easter dinner and my kids gobbled it up and asked for more. At first I was going to skip taking the backbone off, but found a video and it looked so simple. (Make sure you sharpen your kitchen shears before you start to cut). It filled the house with a heavenly smell and every part of the bird tasted divine.

The rub is exceptional! I will be trying it on pork in the future. My 4-year-old devoured both legs of the chicken and was asking for more!

The chicken turned out very juicy and delicious! Only, I think I should have let the chicken rest, as stated (ran out of time!) I changed the recipe, because I really felt like having lemon/garlic chicken. I only had thyme, no juniper, bumped up garlic, rubbed chicken down with butter, and squeezed a lemon all over and cut up the lemon and tucked it around the chicken, baked as directed.

Solid dish that's pretty easy to prepare. Although I only applied the rub for an hour, the chicken was delicious.

Yummy! Juicy chicken and delicious crisp skin, just the way hubby likes it. I had to use dry rosemary so cut down the amount but it was fine. Simple delicious weekend dinner! Prepped in the AM and threw in the oven later, couldn't be easier. We'd give it 3.5 forks but I can't get my cursor to do that!

I often switch the recipe based on the fresh herbs I have in the fridge. Substitute sage, thyme, is still come out great.

Doubled the rosemary paste for 2-4# chickens and let chickens sit overnight. Guests thought it was the 'best' roast chicken they ever had.

Not a memorable dish. I followed the recipe exactly and out came one of the blandest chickens I've ever tried. To the recipe's credit, the chicken was moist but that was the only positive outcome. I would not make this again.

I also added more garlic, more rosemary and did not use juniper berries but put in a bit of worcestershire sauce. I also used chicken breasts with bone and skin on making sure to put olive oil on outside as well. I made this early in the day. The chicken sat in the frig for hours. It was wonderful and juicy!

I made this meal with Garlic Mashed Potatoes for my mother for Mother's Day and it was a MAJOR hit. The flavor was great and it was honestly the best chicken I have ever had. (or at least in the top few). The oil left in the bottom of the dish after cooking was great to put over the mashed, although it was a bit sinfully oily. :) I will definitely keep this recipe for years and years.

was super easy, I cut the rosemary since I am not too much of a fan. It cooked in less than 90 minutes so make sure you check it often. Made it for a party and served it with the gorgonzola polenta from the Oct issue

My husband hates chicken. What's a girl to do? This was SO GOOD that he ASKED if I would make it for an upcoming dinner party. Unheard of! The juniper berries really do make the dish - otherwise it's just a LOT of rosemary. I was able to buy just 5 berries (for $0.02) by buying them in the bulk spices section of my market. I also used a 1/2 chicken (which was fine for the two of us), and cooked it for about 50 minutes.

I have tried many roast chicken recipes (haven't we all) and they all come out pretty much the same to me. Not this one! This one really packs some serious flavor that goes perfectly with moist chicken. dont skip the juniper berries!

I used dried rosemary since that's what I had on hand, and a little extra garlic. It worked great. My husband said it was the best roast chicken I'd made - butterflying certainly helps keep everything moist.

Easy to prepare but nice enough to serve to guests. I used only bone-in chicken breasts, 45 minutes cooking time was more than enough. The skin was a crispy brown and the meat was moist and flavorful.

This was the BEST roasted chicken myself and 2 guests EVER had. Two things different, I placed the chicken on a broiler pan - to keep it from splattering - 2nd, instead of laying the rosemary underneath it while cooking, I chopped it all together and used it in paste with an extra garlic clove and a few extra juniper berries.FABULOUS.... and leftovers make excellent sandwhich meat.

Excellent recipe - Full of flavor & aroma. This was our Sunday chicken dinner served with wild rice & steamed asparagus - my guests went back for 2nds. I felt the recipe was easy & browned up beautifully - It's a keeper - I will be making this roasted chicken again :-)

This was moist and flavorful. To the cook who worries about splatter and smoking, there is nothing you can do about the splatter, but at the oven temp in this recipe, it should be a long way from smoking.

I'd love to make this recipe, but I have one concern that perhaps someone can help me with. How do you keep fat from an uncovered chicken from spattering all over your oven and smoking while its cooking?? This happens to me every time I cook a chicken without a cover. Thanks.

Great chicken recipe! I made this exactly as stated, juniper berries and all. It was moist and delicious...and my kitchen smelled heavenly throughout the entire cooking period. Try it -- you'll like it! Plus, it was so easy to prepare...what more could you ask for?

I have to say, not only did this dish fill our kitchen with the most heavenly aroma, but it was absolutely delicious. Don't let the juniper berries scare you away. It was easy to prepare, and having the butcher remove the backbone made the presentation perfect. I've made it twice now, and my guests have been thrilled. Just make sure you have plenty of rosemary on hand!

I've made this recipe twice with a couple (possibly sacrilegious modifications). I didn't have juniper berries on hand (does anyone?) so I added a very scant dash of Worcestershire sauce. It was the only ingredient I had on hand that I knew contained juniper. Yes. I'm a neophyte. I also prepared the recipe with thyme instead of rosemary because no one in my little family (especially not my husband) likes rosemary. This is a fantastic recipe and I may never make roast chicken any other way. Both times I've saved the turkey neck and spine for stock which makes me feel like such a good, frugal woman. All in all - the recipe is pretty simple to prepare, will make your house smell delicious and it tastes divine. Careful not to overcook and the chicken will be tender and well-flavored throughout.

I tried this last night and it was excellent. I basted the chicken a few times, though maybe it wasn't necessary, and I put the rest of the bulb of garlic in the pan to flavor the juices, which I degreased and poured over the chicken. I was afraid of the juniper but it was very subtle. I might use more next time.
