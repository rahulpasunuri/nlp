Not a fan..just alright. Flavor needed something. I added a few splashes of balsamic as another suggested but feel they needed something else. Cutting the logs made a mess, even when I scored them ahead of time. They also took longer to cook than recipe stated.....found that if the baked log rested for at least 45 minutes, they cut better and made a better presentation. I'm not deleting this from my recipe box as I will tweak it.... there is always hope for anything wrapped in phyllo!

The filling was really tasty and it was popular at work, but I wish I had read the reviews first. It definitely needed a couple more sheets of phyllo to hold in the filling and provide more crunch. Or, maybe split the filling into three logs instead of two.

Delicious and relatively quick bites, fit for guests. I cheated and spooned the pear mixture into phyllo cups and baked for about 15 minutes. My Thanksgiving guests devoured them.

This filling is extremely tasty - but the phyllo makes for messy presentation. For a catering event, I made pinwheels using puff pastry - spread 1/2 the filling over one sheet, sprinkled fresh thyme leaves over, rolled it up, chilled it for easy cutting, and sliced rounds about 1/2 inch thick. Baked cut-sides down at 400 about 25 min so the pastry in the middle was cooked.

So delicious! The phyllo dough makes it a little messy to cut an serve, but it disappeared from my Thanksgiving buffet!

Probably should have read the reviews before making these (always a good policy!). I followed the recipe as written and they were just this heavy mess. Way too rich, and the pear was completely lost in this dish. Might try it again with more pear and less cheese.

I used pre-bought phyllo cups as suggested and those worked great. I also used 2 pears instead of 1, which was a great suggestion. I used 1/2c Jack and 1/4 c white cheddar and it was very good. Very easy!

I'll confess that I made some modifications. First, I used gorgonzola instead of cheddar because I love it with pear. Second, I stirred a little balsamic into the fruit for the final minute of cooking. They turned out beautifully. I followed the suggestion to score the logs halfway before baking and found that not only did it cut cleanly when done, it also gave a better interior texture than the test batch that I didn't score.

just a quick suggestion- if you want to use the phyllo sheets definitely double the amount first. Once you have rolled the strudels and they are complete in their form, take a sharp knife and score the log into sections. Just score through the top layers of phyllo not all the way through the strudel. Bake as directed and once it has set out of the oven, slice through each of your scores and you will have perfect- not messy and crumbly phyllo.

these were great - add some chopped prosciutto to the onions and its sublime.

Made these for a holiday party I was hosting and they were great. I took the advice of previous reviewers and chopped the pears and used phyllo cups. I didn't have dijon mustard, so I substituted a honey mustard. I suspect the dijon would have offered a bit more of a kick.

a wonderful and elegant treat. using phyllo cups made this very easy, but if using sheets i would use at least three sheets and brush the roll with butter to keep it together while baking. i made some modifications...i used two pears so they wouldn't be overpowered by the onion and i would DEFINITELY use no more than 1 scant teaspoon of mustard, and mix it in with the sauteed onions before adding diced (not sliced) pears for easier mixing. they were a great start to a thanksgiving dinner!

This is a very easy and tasty appetizer to put together. I made the filling ahead of time and then brought it to room temperature before using. Based on other reviews, I reduced dijon by 1/2 tsp and then used frozen phyllo cups instead of the sheets. Used a very sharp white Vermont cheddar combined with the parm for the cheese. Could not have been easier. The guests really ate them up.

I just made this for a wine tasting party and everyone loved these. Definately the most commented on appetizer at the party. Dry jack really makes it great. I used Athens tart shells and cut the pear small enough to fit in with the onion and cheese. I will most certainly make again. It was super easy!!!

I used apples instead of pears, and parmesan and cheddar cheeses. I served it for my family thanksgiving and it was really well received. I premade the logs, and used an extra layer of phyllo, but still they crumbles when i cut them. Would definitely make it again, but using phyllo cups !

It's about 2.5 forks. It would be much better using tart shells rather than the phyllo... way too messy (doesn't slice well) so the presentation is not good. Using tart shells, I would garnish with a small slice of pear on top. I used parmesan and asiago cheese which was a pretty good combination. I used about half the Dijon and would use even less if I made again since it's overpowering. I would also increase the amount of pear as it seemed too subtle with the onion and mustard. It's very easy to make, and with some tweaking of ingredient proporations and cheese types, this could be an excellent appetizer.

Love this recipe just as written but after trying it that way, thought I'd check out some of the suggestions i.e. the one who added gorgonzola and the one who used prepared tart shells instead of the phyllo - both excellent ideas, also dicing the pears instead of slicing ! My own additions/suggestions. I've added chopped walnuts to the mix...and...for an extra special presentation, I've served this with a drizzle of melted red currant jelly - looks and tastes fantastic!

This had a nice enough flavor, but I felt like it was missing something, a little tang? I don't know. Maybe I'm just not a big pear fan. Mess-wise, I didn't think it was that bad. I did use one extra phyllo sheet per strudel and put in fridge overnight so that may help with maintaining the form. I think if you like pears you would like this strudel.

I've made this several times.To make the appetizer presentation easier, I use frozen phyllo dough cups. You still have the delicate crust of phyllo dough but they are very easy to make and serve. Just bake at 375 for about 12-14 minutes.

I made this as an appetizer for a dinner party, and it was a huge hit. I altered the recipe quite a bit. I omitted the onion and used extra pears instead. I also used equal parts monterey jack, white cheddar and gorgonzola cheeses. Delicious. Also, if you brush the strudels with melted butter just before baking, it will make the phyllo dough less delicate and your slices will look prettier.

I agree with the folks below.The filling is delicious.The phylo presentation is spectacularly messy,making it lousy for an appetizer.So,I use the filling as a starter - often.I buy (mea culpa) prepared pastry shells.Scoop them out extra-extra well after baking.Stuff the shells with the filling.Bake/brown.Serve as a starter with a grating of the jack on the plate including edges for looks, and a glass of fume blanc for umph. It hasn't failed yet.

Yum! Made this as an hors d'oeuvres for a holiday party with rave reviews. A bit messy, but that didn't stop anyone from devouring them! Will make again at this year's party.

This recipe was relatively quick and easy. I was a bit short on filling, and I would also recommend using an extra sheet of phyllo to prevent the streudels from breaking. Though a bit messy, the taste was worth it - everyone loved these.

For the work involved I found this recipe to be not very tasty, and most of all extremely messy - I made it for a party and it wasn't very finger friendly. I may have made a mistake (?) but to me the filling was just too runny.

I made this recipe over the holidays. It was a split. Half of my guests loved it and half said it was o.k. I don't think I will make it again. It was a little time consuming.

I had major problems with the phyllo dough and these were extremely messy. Was my first time w/ the dough so it could have been me. The taste was great but I think the ratio is off. I found myself short on filling. Would adjust the ratios next time.

A very nice surprise for something so easy. I took reviewers advice and used double the phyllo sheets. Good tip. And I diced the pears. I forgot to take the dough out of the freezer ahead of time so while it thawed, I stuck the filling in the fridge for a few hours and brought it out about 20 min. before rolling. This may have made the whole thing easier to work with...stiffer filling and more sheets...a snap. I brought the streudels to room temp. before baking.

When I made this I made the mistake of using puff pastry sheets instead of phyllo dough and as a result, the pastry was much thicker - almost too much pastry and not enough filling. I should have used only one puff pastry sheet. Very good - though next time I will use the phyllo.

I made these for a holiday brunch to rave reviews. I did not have the problems with the phyllo that other cooks had, but the next time I make them, I probably will double the pastry. Very flaky and tasty!

This was very good but a bit difficult to work with the phyllo dough, though it was my first time with phyllo dough. I double-layered the dough so it would not burst. Make sure you finely chop the pear and onions so you have enough filling.

Made these for a wine & cheese party. I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and used 4 sheets of phyllo. It was a good idea. They were a hit! Very different taste, but delicious. Not difficult to make at all. I will make these again. As a matter of fact, I only served one at the party - the other one is for Christmas.

I agree with the other cooks - more than 2 sheets of phyllo would help - mine also burst during cooking so the presentation wasn't wonderful but they do taste yummy!

Made it for Thanksgiving Day... was a big hit with the family although I think next time we will double up on the phyllo too. They got a little messy, but still very tasty!

Greasy and difficult to prepare. The flavor was heavy on onion and the pear was lost. Also diffcult to cut.

I agree with the other cooks; next time I will use more sheets of phyllo. Very tasty.

Great dish. People couldn't stop eating them. I made four strudel logs and two of them burst during cooking so I would definitely recommend using at least a third sheet of phyllo (unless maybe I didn't roll the logs tightly enough).

This was really good--and easy to make. On one of the rolls, I used 4 sheets of phyllo rather than two (not out of any great experimentation--they were stuck together!) and that one came out much better and sturdier than the one made with only two sheets, which kind of melted and collapsed. I'm making these for Christmas, too!

I found that I needed to use more than 2 sheets of phyllo per strudel. It gave the strudel more structure. Otherwise the dish is delicious!

This recipe's quick, easy and impressive. I had never worked with phyllo before and had no problem. The strudels are very rich, so even though they don't look like a lot, they go a long way. I made the strudels ahead and baked them the day of the dinner with great results.

These strudels were so tasty! We all loved them. I am planning on making them again for a christmas party. You will not be disappointed.
