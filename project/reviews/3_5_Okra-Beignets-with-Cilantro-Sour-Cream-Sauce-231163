Good enough... they were better the longer I left them in the oven. They got crispier. I think they'd be helped by hot sauce (in addition to the sour cream).

I'm going to have to add to my previous review and re-recommend this dish. It's great. I made this dish again and made a different sauce to go with it. I mashed two cloves of garlic with the salt in a mortar and pestle and mixed it into the sour cream, and I replaced the cilantro with basil. It fit the dish much better - I will make this again and again!

Hey, this is good. It's not as much liked fried okra as it sounds because it has multiple layers of okra/veggies inside the crunchy outside, so you get a little gooey okra in the middle. If you truly like the way okra tastes, try this! The sauce is good too - I don't think of lime and cilantro with okra, but it works. You also could use it on other types of fritters or savory pancakes as well (I'm thinking black bean cakes or corn fritters).

These were so delicious. I was hesitant because I am not a big okra fan but tried them because of the reviews. The reviews were correct. Big hit at my soul food dinner. I did not care for the sauce...don't really need it anyway or try some other sauce. Try them, you will not be sorry.

These FRITTERS (beignets? c'mon!) are really delish and deceptively easy. I subbed spinach instead of green peppers and mint for cilantro.

Surpisingly good and not at all slimey. Good use of leftover rice and an excellent side to a variety of dishes. Sauce is very tasty.

Made this dish to the letter and it came out great. Definitely a good use of okra.

This was a new way to prepare okra which my guests appreciated. The sliminess of the vegetable diminishes somewhat when fried and the rice gives these fritters a nice chewy texture. Definitely make the sauce. It's what makes this dish extra special.
