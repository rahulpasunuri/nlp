This was very tasty. We completely enjoyed it. The only thing I did differntly was that I covered this and kept it on low for those 10 minutes. I liked it warm... interested to try it cold as I think it would be a great thing to bring to a potluck

I used this recipe as a base for a great make-ahead salad. I roasted the asparagus with a fair amount of garlic before tossing with white beans, lemon zest, juice, parsley etc. I also added sauteed corn. Was wonderful for lunch the next day.

I had low expectations going into this recipe, but they were blown away. Delicious, delicious! Also, not that difficult to make, and a really cheap meal! This will definitely go into permanent rotation. I cooked the recipe exactly to spec, except perhaps a smidge more parmesan since I eyeballed it. The garlic toast really made it. Overall, wonderful flavor and texture combination. Seriously - make this!

I used chickpeas (garbanzo beans) because we didn't have white beans. Also didn't serve it on toast but added the garlic and parsley to the beans and asparagus. Snipped off the asparagus tips and cooked them along with the rest of it. Let the whole thing simmer until the asparagus were cooked. All-in-all, it was quite nice for a meal on the deck after a hot summer day.

I love this recipe. It's very simple, but the flavors are well balanced. I don't serve it with the toasts, but instead over a bed of lettuce and quinoa for a perfect light lunch.

I didn't have lemon juice so I used lime juice and zest. Also only had one can of cannelinni beans so I also used a can of black eyed beans with corn. Followed rest of recipe as is. Great. Will definitely make again! Next time I may use lime juice again and try cilantro in place of flat leaf parsley.

Easy to prepare and very flavorful. Makes a great summer meal. I used Asiago instead of Parmesan, and olive oil on the bread instead of butter.

Really good, easy, and healthy. A good meal for a hot summer day as it's so light.

This was really good, and an excellent make-ahead pot luck dish. I followed the method described by the cook from Knoxville (thanks!) but decreased the oil a bit. The garlic was a good addition. If you make it ahead of time, it could use a quick squeeze of lemon juice just before serving to brighten the flavor.

This was a really great, really easy recipe. I didn't have any asparagus, so I omitted them, but this was great standing alone as well. Next time I'll try it with the asparagus. I also served the salad on the toast, bruschetta style, and loved it. A very easy lunch or appetizer.

This recipe was ok; there were elements I really liked about it (like the taste of the white beans and lemon together), but I would not make it again.

A wonderful combination of flavors, textures, and colors! My husband and I love asparagus, so I'm always looking for new and different recipes, and this is one I think I'll make again and again! I found halving the recipe was just right for a light meal for the two of us. I did choose to make a few changes in method, but not in the basic proportion of ingredients, with the exception of the lemon zest. I removed the asparagus tips (1.5 to 2 inches) and blanched them, reserving them for garnish, before cutting the rest of the asparagus on the diagonal. I heated the olive oil in an electric skillet and sautéed the asparagus slices for about 2 minutes, then added a small garlic clove, minced, which I sautéed for about 30 seconds before adding the white beans, lemon zest (the full amount, 1/2 teaspoon), lemon juice, salt, and pepper, and turning off the skillet. Then I added the reserved asparagus tips (about 12 for the half recipe) and let the mixture sit for 10 minutes before adding the shaved Parmesan and chopped parsley, as the original recipe specifies. When serving the salad, I kept track of the asparagus tips and placed them on top for decoration. I accompanied the salad with plain French rolls, heated, rather than the garlic bread.
