Great recipe, but I did reduce the butter down to a couple tablespoons. The thought of adding so much butter to truffles was very unappealing. Truffles need little if any butter. I increased the recipe by half and got 50+ large truffles. (I am making a truffle assortment for Christmas gifts, so I did not shape them as eggs.) I used callebaut chocolate and they are holding up fine at room temperature. I did dip them in chocolate and was going to try the previously mentioned technique of dying white chocolate orange and drizzling it across, but my white chocolate curdled. I just drizzled them with plain white chocolate. :)

Awesome recipe, but definitely don't try to shape them like easter eggs--impossible...And covering them in cocoa powder adds a bitterness that's too intense for my taste. I've made this recipe about 15 times now, making adjustments here and there, and here's what I do to minimize the frustrations I encountered: refrigerate the mixture as stated, but do it in custard dishes so that you don't have to waste time re-refrigerating a larger pan when the mixture gets too warm to continue shaping (which happens pretty fast)...just take out one casserole at a time. Use a mellon baller to shape. Spheres are fine. Place on cookie sheets and lightly freeze. Dip in melted chocolate and refreeze lightly, just enough to keep the warmer chocolate coating from melting the truffle centers. The chocolate coating gives stability to the otherwise VERY "melty" truffles. You can then actually make it to the party with your truffles turning to soup. Add some orange food dye to white chocolate and drizzle over for decoration. Now THAT is perfection! Hope that helps whoever takes the time to read all this!

I didn't bother shaping them like eggs, but as spheres, they're very easy to make and delicious. I also made three separate batches, one orange as in the recipe, one with cherry liqueur, and one with hazelnut liqueur and chopped up hazelnuts mixed in (the last was best).

I have made this recipe many times. However, I don't try to make the truffles look like eggs.. that's almost impossible! Instead, I make round bite sized Govida-esque treats. It makes the recipe less time consuming and the results are just as tasty!

IT was very difficult to make the truffles actually look like easter eggs - they rather resembled turds. Getting them smooth was hard - I ended up dipping a knife in hot water to try and smooth them, and it still didn't work well. They taste pretty good, but I might prefer a hard chocolate covering to the sifted cocoa powder.

Yes, chocolate and orange is a delicious combo. Also as an aside, many a spelling error is actually a typo! Be kind!

Ok now did any of you make this??

These people don't like a (polite) spelling "lesson" yet they have no problem being the internet etiquette police - how interesting.

I agree with the last person's entry, this is a web-site to learn about cooking. No one wants a spelling lesson. Thanks anyway.

I am alway extremely disappointed when I see a posting like the woman's from Seattle. Why on earth would anyone deem it necessary to correct someone's spelling?

The truffles tasted great but they would not shape using the spoons. We even tried putting them in a mold, but ended up with a mess.

If you like the flavor combination of chocolate and orange then this recipie is not to be missed. I used triple-sec instead of Grand Marnier (cause that's what I had on hand) and the orange taste was very intense. Along with the sweetness. Wow. Of course mine didn't look much like easter eggs (shaping will take practice) but the flavor makes up for it. Beware, most people will only be able to eat just one so you might want to adjust your recipie and yield accordingly.
