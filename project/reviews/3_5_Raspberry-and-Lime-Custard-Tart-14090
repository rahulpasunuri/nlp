We haven't eaten this yet, but I already know its amazing. I was in a hurry and baked a gluten free pie crust with toasted coconut, subbed non-dairy creamer for the cream, added a few drops of vanilla to the filling and cooked it on the stove, covered filling with heated seedless raspberry jam and topped with raspberries. Just a taste of the filling and a raspberry was divine.

This was fabulous! I didn't have any problems with the lime and raspberry contrast. The crust takes time, but it is one of the best tart crusts I've ever made.

My shortening had gone bad, so the crust was awful- my fault, but the filling was delicious. I forwent the cooked raspberries and just put fresh on the top- it saved time and still tasted great.

I thought this was great and would make it again. That said, I would get the pan that is called for. I used a 10" tart pan and tried to make accommodations. I made about 1 1/3 times the crust and filling. But, I didn't cook the crust long enough and I didn't cook the filling long enough--I just couldn't get the timing right. It still managed to taste delicious, though!

This is the prefect dessert for a hot summer evening meal! I will be making this again.

This was nice, but . . . there was not enough contrast between the tartness of the custard and the raspberries, which were some of the best I've had (unexpectedly, too, since it's only June). Overall, I'd suggest sweet pastry cream or a chocolate cream instead of the lime.

This was a big hit, even though I had to substitute strawberries for the raspberries. The tart was really gorgeous and we all liked the lime custard very much. When making the jelly layer, I chopped the strawberries into 1/2" dice, cooked with sugar then used an immersion blender to puree. The texture was perfect without straining.

This recipe was incredible. I am not a baker at all and even though this recipe is a bit time consuming, the crust is just right and the raspberry/lime filling is supreme. Perfect!

I have made this recipe several times and it is really delicious. I love lime; this tart is just right!

This was a huge success at a gathering of critical dessert eaters! Loved the lime flavors with the raspberries. The crust was easy and tender. (Do not forget to refrigerate before baking, mine shrunk slightly but did not effect the flavor. There was nothing left but compliments!

excellent. I used a 9 inch diameter round tart pan, which worked just fine. I served this to 6 adults and 3 ten year old boys, and we all wished we had more.

I served this for Thanksgiving, and everyone loved it. I'm glad that I listened to the reviewer who cut down on the lime zest. I'm a lime fanatic, but I only added 1 1/2 tsp of zest. I also reduced the amount of sugar in the custard and raspberry sauce. Not that I don't love "sweet", but the sometimes pastry recipes are just so rich, that you can only eat a tiny piece.

Wonderful recipe, however I can't believe I am saying this as my husband and I are the ultimate lime freaks--we thought the lime taste was a bit overpowering. Next time we might not use zest, just the juice. Anyway, this tart was fairly simple to make, looked gorgeous and tasted delicious; this shaped tart pan is so pretty and less predictable than round ones are. The raspberry sauce/juice stuff you cook on the stove never got solid and I am not sure it is supposed to, but that could be my fault as I let it boil wildly (cause I forgot about it) but it didn't matter; it creates only a very thin layer anyway and is delicious. This dessert is a real winner.

This was a wonderful tart recipe! The raspberry and lime flavors definately complimented each other. It was devoured immediately!!

Sophisticated and delicious! Adults and children all loved it. I would cut the zest in half next time, but my zest might have had a stronger flavor because I used organic limes.

Fabulous - loved the strong lime flavor

Nobody will believe that you made this yourself and you will use the pan again - it's the same one you need to make the delicious three mushroom tart in Gourmet, April 1996.

This was delicious and the presentation was lovely although I will probably never use this size tart pan again.
