Dont't mean to be snarky, but isn't it "octopi"?

This is delicious! Baby octopus is more tender and looks more interesting than more mature ones. The only thing I added was a small clove of garlic, pressed. Took me right back to Sicily!

This dish tasted like home. I also added some extra octopus to rice noodles and sauteed mushrooms. They were very tasty leftovers.

This dish was wonderful. I added about 1/4 cup of finely shredded fennel and a pinch of sugar. The flavor was wonderful - delicate, but very satisfying as a light first course. Everyone raved about it - even my father who thinks there's no reason to eat anything other than red meat and pototatoes.

This is a good and simple recipe for octopus. I am appalled by the first comment. As an improvement on the recipe, there is really no need to discard the heads -- they can be cut into strips, much like calamari rings. Capers always add a little zest to octopus, I recommend them.

I have not made this recipe, but have to respond to the person who posted the first review. A little closed minded, don't you think? Not many people I know have tried octupus, but I can tell you that it is one of my favorite things. I make a baby octopus salad that I created on my own that is fabulous. Baby octopus has a very mild and nutty flavor and is excellent as a salad or main dish. If more people would be just a bit more opened minded and not so sheltered as the previous writer, many would discover the awesome taste of baby octopus. If you decide to try this baby octopus recipe though, be sure you cook them for at least an hour to an hour and a half to be sure they are more tender. Cooking for only 45 minutes (as this recipe suggests) will only leave you disappointed. Happy eating and try new foods!!!!!
