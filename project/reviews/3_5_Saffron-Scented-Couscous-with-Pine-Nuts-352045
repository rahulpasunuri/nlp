Excellent accompaniment to the leg of lamb, even without the saffron (which my grocery store was unfortunately out of!).

I used one bunch of green onions, my guests loved it. Super fast. The menu was easy to execute as well.

I've always looked for something really quick and easy to do with couscous, to be served as a side dish (other than simply adding broth), and this recipe totally fills the bill - definitely a keeper!

A no fuss dish that looks and tastes like you went to a lot of trouble. Perfect for company and way more impressive than potatoes or rice. I also make this with toasted almonds and without the saffran to keep it economical. Goes great with lamb, roasts, chicken, fish, stews. A winner!

Really delicious and quite easy to make. I will definitely make this again sometime, but not too often due to the saffron.

I agree this is tasty, easy, and lovely. I've substituted toasted almond slivers which my family preferred over the pine nuts.

It's easy, makes a lot and tastes great. I'd cut back on the green onions next time, personal taste. Love the pine nuts. Went beautifully with the lamb and fruited mint chuntey from this site. Made for pretty array on the Easter talbe.

I've made this recipe both with, and without the saffron and it still have a very nice flavor. Pine nuts were enough to make it speacial for the easter dinner menu.

This recipe is delicious. It's beautiful, simple, and I love the earthiness. Too bad saffron is so expensive or I'd be making this all the time.

easy and tasty. Goes well with the lamb. I like the pine nuts for texture.

Was delicious & went really well with the lamb. Really easy to make - and fast - with great saffron flavor. The green onions gave a nice color contrast.

Huh....I thought this was very good. It had great flavor, the toasted pine nuts and green onions were delicious in it. It went beautifully with the spice rubbed pork tenderloin and the colors were very appetizing. My guests loved it. It's also very easy to make. So I'm suprised at the negative reviews.

Funny, but at this time there is only one review with one fork, but the user rating with the recipe shows three forks.

Doesn't taste all that different from plain ol' normal cous cous. Hard to justify the cost of the saffron and pine nuts (both a pricey ingredients).
