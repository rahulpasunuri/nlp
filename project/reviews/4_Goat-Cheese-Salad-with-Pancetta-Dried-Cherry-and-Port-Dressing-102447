Sensational. Definitely drain the fat from the pancetta. I tossed spinach with crumbled goat cheese (rather than baking the cheese separately) and used pecans instead of pine nuts. The warm spinach salad was beautiful alongside orange-glazed salmon. Another terrific twist would be to toss it all with slices of grilled steak and serve with gougere.

This is the PERFECT recipe to serve with duck breast. I do extra dressing to use as sauce for duck. Absolutely divine! Serve for company you want to impress.

While I underestimated the time to make this dressing, the salad was very well received, and I really liked it. The warm dressing and goat cheese seemed a good way to make salad a part of dinner on a cold, rainy november night. I made two changes - drained the fat from the pancetta after browning, and then added a bit of olive oil before sweating the onions and garlic. Substituted dried cranberries, as I couldn't find cherries.

wonderful! perfect side with duck breast.

Fabulous and have made many times. I half the sugar, drain off the fat from the pancetta (to reduce calories), half the cherries. Usually egg wash & dust with fine bread crumbs the goat cheese before baking. Use good quality goat cheese. If your goat cheese rounds are not wonderful, blame the quality of the cheese, not the recipe. I use mid quality Port.

I made this to rave reviews for a retirement dinner. I enjoyed it, but next time I would make a few changes - first, the cherries should be removed from the port after soaking and added to the salad as a topping, not as part of the dressing. I would use only half as many cherries, too, and a LOT more greens - the cherries overpowered everything else. I added walnuts for crunch and would definitely do so again. With tweaks, this is a real winner!

Followed recipe to the letter and it was outstanding. Though next time would use half as much cherries and sugar. Delicious served with the seared salmon with balsamic glaze on epicurious website.

Incredible! I served this at a dinner party consisting of excellent cooks and true foodies. I used crabnerries and bacon. I was concerned by the amount of fat from the bacon, so I drained the bacon and poured off all of the grease. Using the same skillet, I added enough of the olive oil to cook the garlic and onion, then followed the recipe from that point on. I did save the bacon for topping the saland rather than encorporating with thte dressing, but I'm sure it is delicious both ways. A keeper!

I have made this salad numerous times & have always received rave reviews (even from the foodies!) Make the dressing ahead, as it is the most time consuming. Enjoy.

This was well-received at my dinner party and was fairly easy to make. You might try broiling the goat cheese on toasts for something different.

There's nothing I love more than a good, unhealthy salad. And this one does a fine job. I replaced the cherries with cranberries and used mid-quality ($13 half bottle) ruby port. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. My only complaint is that the goat cheese adopted, what was to me, an unpleasant texture after being warmed. Gritty, and resembling curdled milk. Next time I'll put it on crumbled plainly. Otherwise, absolutely delicioius. Got the pancetta from A.G. Ferrari's.

I don't know why it would have been greasy unless you use fatty bacon and not pancetta. We made this for New Year's Eve for 12 (we had just the salad course) and no one left any on their plate. It was incredible. I just sent it to my brother to use for a neighborhood dinner group.

Rating: 1
I always read and usually agree with other recipe reviewers, but this time I can't. This was the worst dressing I've ever tasted. I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with a very oily, greasy and tasteless pile of stuff. Thankfully I did a "test run" of the recipe before making it for Company.

I rarely make the same dish more than once, but this dressing has become a staple for us when we have guests. I think the combination of flavors is outstanding. I like the suggestion of adding some red onion to the salad.

This salad is beautiful and delicious. I did not include the goat cheese since I was serving the salad with a mozzerella risotto and I thought that would be overkill with the cheese. The dressing is wonderful and very easy to make. I soaked the cherries in the port overnight. In place of the shallots, I used red onion. Very delicious.

For a dinner party, I'd make this dressing a day ahead and warm it up at the last minute. It's a GREAT salad. I left out the pancetta (vegetarian) and my carnivore husband said he didn't miss it. I also left out the pine nuts (yuck). You have to watch the goat cheese so it doesn't burn. It's very elegant.

Delicious. I chose to serve most of the dressing on the side. Next time I would strain it better if doing this, as it doesn't look like dressing with all the solids in it. Also, I would increase the port in the dressing and maybe decrease the oil

This recipe is superb. I doubled it and served it at an elegant dinner party for 8. I felt this dressing was anything but bland. I used high-quality Port so perhaps the discrepanc--from other review's ratings--lies there.

Yuuuummm! I was the guest of the Fairfield cook who made this salad, and of course had to have the recipe, not realizing it came from my favorite source - Epicurious. She used the bacon, of course, instead of the pancetta, as she said. An incredible offering, and it will become part of my own repertoire.

Wonderful salad. I did half the amount of dried cranberries. I also didn't put as much olive oil since you also used the bacon drippings.

I was disappointed in this recipe after the expense and work of making the dressing. It was fine but not great. I love dried cherries but agree w/ other reviwers that there were too many overall. I thought the dressing lacked something, some kind of kick or spice. I've had better store-bought dressings than this.

Rating: 4
We love this salad. We usually don't add the goat cheese and use bacon for the meat. It is also good with baby spinach or romaine lettuce and with toasted walnuts or pecans substituted for the pine nuts. Dried cranberries are prettier substituted for the cherries, but the flavor is better with cherries.

Rating: 4
This salad was amazing! I used pancetta, cranberries and the goat cheese. I doubled the recipe for a dinner party, but didn't double the cranberries, oil and pine nuts. I also tried on spinach for my leftover dressing and it was just as good with feta instead of goat chease. Will definetly make this salad again!

This is a wonderful salad! Served it with clam chowder-a great contrast in flavors. I used cranberries and goat cheese, but will use gorgonzola next time as suggested. For 4 servings, I thought there were too many cranberries. Will cut back next time.

This recipe is amazing!!! I have made it every Thanksgiving and New Years for 4 years now. I use bacon instead of pancetta (since pancetta can be hard to find), and I prefer to use Gorgonzola or Stilton cheese instead of goat cheese. I make it ahead of time and then just reheat in the microwave before serving.

Everybody raves about this salad. I found that the dressing is enough for a one pound bag of mixed baby greens (from Costco), 5 oz crumbled goat cheese, and 1 cup of the pine nuts. I mix it all together and it's just great!!

Worth every penny of the rather pricey ingredients! Go for the cherries and pancetta if you possibly can. Way more mysterious than common cranberries and bacon. This is a salad you won't get off your mind, neither will your friends and family. Serve it on a flatter platter, circled by the goat cheese, rather than a salad bowl, and watch your guests' glances of curiosity as they try to figure out what hit them!

One of the best salads I've ever eaten. Served at Thanksgiving to rave reviews. The balance between sweet and savory was perfect. The texture of the bacon wasn't quite right so I removed it from the dressing. The result was great- the dressing was infused with a smoky flavor without overwhelming it. The color of the salad was lovely-I used a mixture of red leaf lettuce and spinach for the greens. Thanks epicurious!

This is a fantastic dressing. I cut down the amount of cherries to 3/4 cup, which was plenty. I have also made this with chopped prosciutto instead of pancetta. Instead of pine nuts, I chop up 1/2 cup of macadamia nuts and press the cheese rounds into the nuts, and saute in a few tablespoons of olive oil until just warmed through, about one minute per side. Slices of avocado add even more to this salad. Everyone requests this salad, it is orgasmic!

I cut this recipe out of the magazine when it came out (and we were still in the USA) and it took me this long to get around to making it. I agree with the others that there were way too many cherries and pine nuts. Overall it was just too sweet. I will not make it again.

A weird and interesting mix that I was unsure of while making it, but in the end worked out very nicely. The pancetta is probably a better choice over bacon as it is not as salty. I also found no need for additional salt or pepper for the recipe. Enjoy!

I made this salad for a church potluck recently. It was a smashing success! Here are my variations: I used bacon, instead of pancetta, and combined some of the drippings with the oil. I also toasted the pine nuts in the drippings as well. In addition, I used a combination of dried cherries, strawberries, cranberries, and currants. A definite winner!

this salad was a great start to a duck main course. The cherries, pine nuts and goat cheese made a wonderful combination.

This is very good and worth the effort. Because I used bacon instead of the pancetta, I had a lot of grease left over in the pan. I cut down on the olive oil and increased the vinegar as I found that after following the instructions, a lot of the liquid seemed to burn off. The goat cheese perfectly compliments the dressing. YUM.

This is a wonderful recipe, and worth the effort. I have been cooking a lot lately, and while I have gotten many compliments on the things I have made, this has by far been everybodys favorite. I have not tried it with the Pancetta yet, as I have been preparing food for Vegetarians or trying to serve Kosher meals. A keeper for sure!!!

Our "Gourmet Group" of thirty-some years gave this many kudos at our Christmas dinner. To serve 9, I doubled the recipe (using cranberries). There was enough dressing remaining for a couple more salads to enjoy the next day. I do recommend its being served as a first course rather than with the entree. It stands on its own. Upon merely hearing about it, my daughter requested it for our Christmas dinner.

What an outstanding salad!!! Coming from a person who cooks often, I can honestly say that this one tops my list! The dressing intermingled very diverse flavors: sweetness from the cherries and port wine, tartness from the red wine vinegar, crunchy texture and toasty flavor from the pine nuts and the unforgettable sharpness and creaminess of the goat cheese. I served this at a wine tasting dinner and everyone loved it! I do suggest to make the dressing ahead of time; just reheat before serving.
