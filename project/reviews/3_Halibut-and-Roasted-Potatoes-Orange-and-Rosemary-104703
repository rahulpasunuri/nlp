I came to Epicurious for my first attempt cooking halibut to get an idea of cooking temperature and time, as well as what flavors would go well. I started with a couple of good-quality fresh Alaskan halibut steaks from Fresh & Easy, cut up some tri-color potatoes, and substituted lime juice for orange because I was out and was afraid the orange juice might be too sweet. Although the lime was a little overpowering, the overall flavor with the roasted potatoes was delicious. I'm sure the potatoes helped keep the fish from drying out. I also added half tablespoon of butter in small pieces on top of each piece of fish. I will definitely make this again but use orange juice as called for.

This was fantastic. I made it for a dinner party and everyone was really impressed. More importantly, it was easy enough to make that I didn't have to spend the whole evening in the kitchen. It gives a great 'wow' impression but with not too much effort. The fish and sauce and potatoes were delicious. Can substitute any white fish.

made this dish per the recipe except I used talapia in lieu of halibut. Next time I will halve the rosemary and omit the orange peel or perhaps just use a little zest. Potatoes were delicious.

I would guarantee this would be a big hit. Be sure to roast the potatoes as described and don't overcook the halibut. The sauce is just enough to give the food flavor and color to make for a great presentation. Easy to make.

This dish was wonderful! My fish guy didn't have halibut, so I used swordfish. The flavors were perfect. I was a little hesitant about orange zest on my potatoes, but WOW, what a great compliment to the final dish! Next time I will double the orange and balsmic reduction, as we would have liked more for our potatoes too! I may also use a red potatoe as the whites I used were a little too dry.

This is not only a very delicious recipe but one that is very easy and relatively quick to make. The fresh orange juice blended with the balsamic vinegar is a wonderful accompaniment to this mild fish. The fresh parsley, garlic - which I doubled - orange zest and rosemary are also great with this recipe. I will plan on making this again and again.

We really enjoyed this. I basically stuck to the recipe as written and was very pleased. The fish was perfectly moist and the orange/balsamic accompaniment was delicious. Having an excellent, fresh cut of fish definitely helped. I will definitely make this again, it's also easy!

I tried this out on some friends, and it was a hit! Definitely follow the suggestion to put some of the spice mixture on the potatoes before roasting, and also double the spice and sauce amount. I didn't put the entire amount of the garlic in, and didn't think it was missed. I served it with a spinach salad with a tangy dressing which complimented it nicely. A nice, easy to put together Springtime meal. Definitely making this one again.

We like all these ingredients and the red peppers that another reviewer suggested adding but not this recipe. Tonight's dinner was a flop. There are several much better ways to prepare halibut on this site. Try one of them... not this one.

This was a delicious combination of flavors. I was a little leery of combining rosemary, orange and parsley with balsamic vinegar, but it was a wonderful idea. A great dinner!

I love this recipe and have made it several times to great reviews. One change: I put half the parsley, rosemary, orange zest, garlic mix on the potatoes when I put the fish on top which makes the potoatoes a lot more interesting. Great fresh ingredients make this dish, don't bother making it with dried herbs.

If I had eaten this at a restaurant...I probably wouldn't go back! We really thought it was a mediocre dish.

This recipe was too tangy for my liking and the garlic was also a little overpowering. The concept of combining these flavours is good but it just didn't work for me in this recipe.

The flavors compliment each other surprisingly well. I took a cue from earlier reviewer and used new, red potatoes and also added red and orange bell pepper chunks to roast with the potatoes.

Based on the reviews I cooked this recipe and wasn't disappointed. As we don't have halibut in Australia I used barramundi which is a fleshy white fish and very popular here.

My husband and I loved this dish! I usually don't favor recipes using zest, yet something about this is a fabulous combination. I've made it three times since I saw it in last year's issue of Bon Appetit. I came to this site specifically, in fact, to find it again!

I found this recipe to be bland and the flavor mix not very appetizing. In fact I only ate half of my serving and threw the rest out. My husband agreed it was awful.

The flavors of this dish are EXCELLENT. I think it is a bit difficult to get everything piping hot to the table, but it is a lovely and worthwhile treatment. As the recipient of about 100lbs of halibut from my fishing father-in-law, I was really desperate for how to use it up. Even my anti-fish husband requests this--if we HAVE to eat fish :-)

I loved this dish and would definitely make it again!! The serving size is a little small, though, so we usd bigger steaks!! Delicious!!

We loved this recipe. Very light, but with a nice mix of fresh flavors. I would not cook the fish on top of pototoes, however (more crispy that way). I used a mixture of small white potatoes and red new potatoes -- and the orange and rosemary was heavenly.

We loved this recipe! I couldn't get fresh halibut so used chilean sea bass which I pan- seared before roasting. For those who thought this might be bland, the sea bass was anything but! The orange and rosemary sauce was fantastic.

Made it for four like in the recipe but with only two halibut steaks which made it more tasty, you have to love garlic.

I found the sauce a little bland but the flovours interesting. The second time I made it I added a tablespoon of soy sauce and a small chopped jalepeno which made the dish more festive to my taste buds. I also used new potatoes rather than white which added colour. Thanks for original idea.

This is a delicious, simple, one-dish meal. Next time I would add some chopped fresh rosemary (or garlic cloves?) directly to the potatoes before roasting them, instead of just putting it in the sauce for the halibut (my fiance felt the potatoes needed something and reached for the ketchup). While I use lemon a lot, I loved the fresh orange juice and zest in the fish sauce.

This dish was ok, but a little plain for my taste. The fish was juicy but the sauce left something to be desired which made it a pretty bland dish. This is one of the few recipes I've found in this database that I wasn't thrilled with.

Very good! Even though I made some substitutions such as new potatoes, Talapia fish and and dried rosemary(using 1/2 the amount).I think fresh is always better if available. I'll definitely make this again. Parsley mixture on top gives it a restaurant look!!
