This is delicious. My boyfriend was craving the Italian ice he had as a kid, so I wanted to try making it myself. This was so easy to make with such a wonderful result. I was worried it seemed like a lot of sugar, but it came out perfectly sweetened. I've since made it a couple of times, even as dessert for a big dinner party, where it received rave reviews. Even though you are supposed to stir it for two hours, I'm not sure how much it matters. Sometimes I forget and only stir it 2 or 3 times in the 2 hours, and it still turns out fine. A wonderful summer dessert!

I've made other granitas before, and this one's flavor is the most strong, most delicious. Easy to make, and flavor with color that stands alone. Excellent.

This is extraordinary! I've made it several times in different ways: mixed berries, blueberries only or raspberries only. Different fruits take different amounts of time to freeze because of their natural pectins. When it's not berry season, or when they're really expensive, I've used frozen berries with great success. Enjoy!

This is an intensely flavored confection. I put things together in a little different order (sugar with the raspberries, added the water at the end) and I added a tablespoon of Amaretto liqueur to it at the end. You must try this, it's the height of summer splendor.
