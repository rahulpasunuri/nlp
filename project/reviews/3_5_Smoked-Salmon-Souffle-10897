I made it for the first time, but we did it a little different ! We put half lb of fresh salmon mixed with 4oz smoked, added just a bid of green spinach for little texture, and we didn't have dill , I put parsley !!! My family loved it !

Lovely and light! I too waited until the end to fold in some smoked salmon offcuts. We really enjoyed this.

I enjoyed this, although I agree with the reviewer who found it too salty. Next time I'll add the salmon at the end as well.

Yum. Did wait til after the onion/butter combo was done before adding the salmon. Made these in individual ramekins(6)after halving the recipe and it was perfect. Nice dish for a "meatless Monday"

I thought it was too salty and the flavour not so amazing as other reviewrs stated, maybe because the smoked salmon shouldn't be cooked for so long. I might try it again, only adding the salmon at the end (see another recipe in this site: smoked trout soufflé in phylo shell).

I made this for a party this past weekend, serving it in individual ramekins (14). It was a big hit, judging from the oohs and ahhs when they came from the oven, and the silence that descended while folks ate them. The remaining 2 were great for a lazy Sunday breakfast the next day. I will definitely make these again.

Made this for 14 people with indivudual ramekins for first course to an elaborate Christmas dinner. They were a triumph! Easy to do and very tasty.

My first souffle and it came out perfect. After pouring the batter in the pan, be sure to run your finger around the rim of the pan to wip away excess batter. This creates a very high crown.

This recipe was very easy to prepare and turned out very good. I think I cooked it a bit longer than the recipe called for - the key was to take it out of the oven when it was golden brown. Served it with sour cream and chili sauce. Yummmmm!!!

I followed recipe exactly and it turned out beautifully except for one thing. It was a little runny in the center. If I had let it cook longer the top would have burnt. Nonetheless, a super recipe. Used it next day for left overs and it was still great.
