These were easy to throw together with ingredients I had on hand. They were approved by my picky 12-year-old daughter, who usually complains that my cookies are too hard. Not so with these pillowy-soft, moist, chocolate-blobbed cookies. I did up the chocolate factor a bit - I had leftover mini-chips, big chocolate chunks and regular chocolate chips. They made a fun mish-mash of chocolatey goodness in the cookies.

Amazing! I replaced the honey with granulated sugar and used chocolate chips. Since we have a peanut butter allergy in the family, I used toasted soy spread instead (tastes like peanut butter!). So delicious. This recipe is a keeper.

I've made this recipe as written many times and to great result. Today I made them by using a combination of barley and oat flour, and substituted almond butter for the peanut butter. FABULOUS!

My daughter won first place out of thirteen kids at a cookie bake off at her school with this recipe. We all were so amazed because we had never made it before. The only thing we did differently was that we added lots more chocolate chips and a chunk of Reese's peanut butter cup on top of each cookie after it came out of the oven. This cookie is definetely a winner!

Ok, so kinda uncool to review a recipe that I altered, but this was so rock and roll it must be shared. I skipped the honey (ran out), oats (hubby won't eat "health food"), and used milk chocolate chips rather than semi- sweet. Then, I spotted an overripe banana - threw that in for good measure. So good! As observed by other reviewers, these little gems don't spread out, but stay round and soft. Yum!

These cookies were SO delicious!! I was very surprised when I opened the oven, I expected them to flatten out like regular chocolate chip cookies but they stayed nice and puffed, and were very moist--my favorite kind of cookie! I love that honey and oatmeal are in these cookies, it adds some more texture and interesting flavor rather that just tasting like straight peanut butter. I made two tweaks: I used a nonstick cookie sheet and did not need to butter the pan at all. The cookies came right off with a spatula, no problem. I also used a full cup of milk chocolate chips instead of 4oz. I assumed a 4 oz solid block would equal roughly a cup of chocolate in chip-form, and it seemed fine to me.

Really great recipe, cookies are delicious! But I got to admit, 5oz of chocolate does NOT satisfy! Who are they kidding? I need more like 10oz! I also added some Reece's peanut butter chips as well. Yum yum yum! :)

I read the recipe and it looked good, but I had to add some pecans and my old fall back. Baileys Irish Cream, about a teaspoon, just to perfume it. And they were gone gone gone!

These were delicious, however it took me two tries to get them right. I would suggest using about 1.5 T of dough, rolling them into a ball, and then, as another user suggested, flattening them with a fork. Also, for extra soft cookies, I only baked them for 10 minutes.

Wow, these are amazing as written! The only change I made was to increase the chocolate by half again and to use 65% dark chocolate. The perfect peanut butter cookie! I think the only thing that would improve them would be to take the suggestion of the reviewer who said to add a little sea salt on top - the contrast would have been delicious. I think I'll sprinkle some on next time while they're spending their 5 minutes on the baking sheet right after they come out of the oven.

Agree with all the reviewers...this is a great recipe! The cookies are soft, chewy and delicious. I add a little extra salt and oatmeal for sweet/salty contrast. Also, you can reduce the amount of white sugar because there are so many sweet ingredients. Peanut butter lovers will adore this cookie.

Excellent recipe! The honey adds such rich flavor and the oats add to the texture. Avoid the temptation to over bake to ensure they stay soft and moist.

Very nice cookie. I used organic roasted valencia smooth pb from Trader Joes & added coarsely chopped roasted peanuts. I used dark chocolate & doubeled the amount, which was perfect. I also sprinkled a little sea salt on top, because my pb was not very salty. I made bigger cookies (1.5-2Tbs) & flattened them slightly. I got perfect 3-4" round, .5" thick cookies. I did have to increase the cooking time to about 18 minutes at 325 & that was perfect for chilled dough. I think using dark & doubling the chocolate was key. Also the sea salt was really nice, but that depends on your pb.

These are perfect. Ten minutes in oven, used semisweet chips this time, parchment paper does not stick. Flattened with fork. I finally have a recipe for peanut butter chocolate chip cookies and a thrilled husband as a result.

I used unsweetened Caillebaut chocolate instead of semisweet because it was on hand. I wouldn't recommend that. But, I did flatten them before baking with the traditional fork pressing, and they look nice. More crumbly than chewy--intend to add an egg yolk next time and the semisweet chocolate. I also agree with the two other reviewers who thought that they did not taste enough of peanut butter. I wonder if the Nestle peanut butter and chocolate chip mix would work...

These were very good. I used Peanut Butter & Co.'s chunky peanut butter. The more natural pb, along with the oats and honey gave these cookies a heartier, healthier feel. Make sure the cookies look a bit soft when you remove them from the oven as they tend to harden up as they cool. I found that my batches took anywhere from 11-12 minutes.

My daughter is allergic to peanuts so I subsituted the peanut butter for almond butter and chopped dry roasted almonds. They turned out great and my daughter loved them.

Best peanut butter cookies I've ever had. They were a big hit. The oats kept the cookies moist unlike most peanut butter cookies. They weren't too sweet or bland like other reviews said. I pretty much followed the recipe exactly. The only difference was I did not refrigerate them because I didn't have time but they turned out fine. And instead of nuts or chocolate chips I added skore chunks. I will always use this recipe from now on.

Rating: 3
Good but not great. Tend to burn on bottom easily, to be sure to take them out promptly at 12 minutes or just before. I used organic chunky Trader Joe's peanut butter and semi-sweet chocolate that I chopped into chunks. Oatmeal added a nice textural element, but I think I'll stick with my old Joy of Cooking standby.

Rating: 2
Too sweet, even after reducing the sugar a 1/4 cup. Will make it again but not sure how to make it much less sweet! Ingredients: Made it with 3/4 cup br sugar, all else the same. Using processed Peanut butter is key, so is creaming the wet ingredients until they are a golden brown. Used Reeses peanut butter chips instead of chocolate, and the chips alone are too sweet so the entire cookie is a sugar rush. Baking: Dropped rounded teaspoons onto the baking sheet. Those baked for full 12 minutes and cooled for 10 to a nice crisp exterior and chewy interior.

Love this recipe - especially for "kisses". Most peanut butter cookies spread out too much so when the kiss is added to middle, the whole thing is flat. These cookies hold their shape. Made the recipe as is except omitted the chocolate chunks and pulsed the oats as another reviewer suggested. At 8 minutes, added the kisses then back in the oven for another 2 minutes. With the chocolate kiss on the top, definitely let the cookie cool the full 5 minutes before transferring. Perfect cookies every time.

Rating: 4
These cookies are fabulous! I used Dark Chocolate Dreams creamy peanut butter from The Peanut Butter & Co. instead of regular crunchy peanut butter. I then added chopped peanuts (these looked very pretty in the finished cookie!) and used Ghirardelli's bittersweet chocolate chips - amazing! Do not overbake these cookies - 12 minutes is all they need. Upon removing them from the oven, they will be a bit gooey still, so let them cool on the buttered cookie sheet for the full 5 minutes (or even several minutes longer) before transferring them to a cooling rack. Then let them cool completely on the cooling rack, and you will have moist, chewy cookies. I'm guessing the reviewers whose cookies turned out too crunchy overbaked them....I think these will be just as good with regular peanut butter next time, I just had the chocolate peanut butter on hand.

Rating: 3
Very tasty! These are nice, moist cookies that pack a great peanut butter and chocolate punch. Perfect for kids (one three- year-old guest ate at least 6 large cookies in one sitting). I dropped the cookies off a tablespoon onto a baking sheet and the resulting large cookies were chewy, with no hint of a problem with texture (unlike earlier review).

I really didnt care for the texture or flavor of these cookies. I am not a big fan of honey in cookies so that may be why. I did bake them for 12 minutes and they came out nicely baked and they look good but that is the only good thing I can say about them.

An absolutely fabulous cookie - my go-to recipe, without a doubt. I find that they do not take nearly12 minutes - I go for 8 minutes, so I would make sure that you check early if you like them just golden and still soft.

I think this is a great recipe. I have made it several times and brought the cookies to work and everyone loved them. They are soft and chewy and just the right level of sweetness. I added about a tablespoon more of oatmeal (for chewyness and texture) and about a tablespoon less of the brown sugar because people in Japan (where I live) don't like their cookies as sweet as Americans do!

not too bad, people like it. used creamy PB and added sunflower seeds instead (don't like peanuts). batter is a little dry and had to push the dough down because it stayed in the ball shape. i used the ice cream scooper and that required about 18 mins in the oven.

Rating: 2
These cookies were easy to make but they aren't amazing. They are a bit on the dry side and sort of crunchy instead of chewy. I made them in tablespoon balls as instructed but they never spread out so the cookies sort of look like little nuggets. By the last few trays we just smushed the balls flat and those came out a bit better.

These are very forgiving cookies- I had to substitute white sugar for brown, and had no vanilla, and they still came out great. I used natural creamy PB, and baked the cookies for 12 min, with 2 min left I used a fork to quickly push down the cookies as they stayed in their ball shape otherwise. I liked the oats and would add more but it would probably make the batter too dry. Definite honey taste, very yummy!

Good cookies, but they definitely needed the full cooking time (at least using an airbake pan). I went by the reviews for 10-12 minutes in the oven with 5 minutes cooling on the pan and came out with half raw cookies that I had to rebake. I agree that the oats don't make much of a difference. I imagine you could leave them out without really noticing a difference.

I followed the recipe very closely except mixed in some King Arthur white whole wheat flour and some K.A. whole wheat with K.A. white flour. (It really is great flour!) Baked for 10 minutes on a silicone baking mat and was very pleased with the results. A huge hit. The subtle honey undertone makes the flavor a bit more complex. I'd say the oats were somewhat pointless.

A favorite with the husband and nieces & nephews. I make it fairly often, as they are quite easy. I use a round tablespoon to scoop the dough, and flatten it down, then use a small silicone spatula to scoop it out onto the baking sheet. This makes a smaller, neater cookie. I bake 5 minutes, then flip it around, and bake another 5 minutes. Store with large marshmallow in airtight container to keep soft.

I substituted 1/4 c. of flour for whole wheat, next time, I willk use at least 1/2. I also used the splenda brown sugar and light butter and mixed in M&M's because that's what I had and they came out FANTASTIC! I agree that the oats are barely there, but I think I might just add more next time. And since so many people said they didn't spread, I pushed the tops flat, but they're still thick and delicious!

Made these for the first time. YUMMY!!! Made the following substitutions: 1) Didn't add chocolate chips becuz I didn't have any; 2) Used 1/2 salted butter and 1/2 margarine and then omitted the salt; 3) Used natural, organic PB; 4) And instead of wheat flour, used spelt flour (1 cup all-purpose spelt; 1/2 cup "whole" spelt flour). They turned out great!!! Didn't seem greasy or fatty and the texture was light and fluffy when eaten fresh out of the oven. They have a distinct PB & honey flavour. Even over-baked the first batch but that didn't seem to affect the texture -- they were still light and slightly chewy (could be because they were rather large cookies). They didn't spread much during baking and ended up kind of domed and crinkly looking -- like snickerdoodles or soft molasses cookies. Overall, these cookies are great in taste and texture, super easy to make, and I like the hint of oatmeal. My Dad, who hates PB, even eats them!!

This is a follow-up to my previous review. The first time I made them, these cookies tasted good, but took twice as long to bake, didn't spread at all, and were like little rocks in texture. The second time, they turned out wonderfully soft and chewy, and baked in exactly the time specified. The difference? This time I made them with Skippy peanut butter, as compared to 100% peanuts, no additives or emulsifiers peanut butter. I think the additives that prevent oil separation in most commercial peanut butter act as shortening. Some previous reviewers said that natural peanut butter worked, but I believe those were US reviewers. Canadian flour is made with harder wheat, meaning there's more gluten, and this was probably a contributing factor to the tough cookies I got with attempt number one. Moral: unless the recipe specifically states all-natural peanut butter is required, use a standard supermarket brand. Believe me, the difference is night and day. I will definitely make these again - very rich, very peanut-buttery, and a lovely consistency (if you use the right peanut butter for the job :-)

Good recipe. Used Jif Creamy Peanut Butter (instead of old-fashioned), added NO salt, used only 3/4 cup of golden brown sugar, used only 3/4 cup of chocolate chips (instead of chunks), used 1 full TB of Mexican vanilla, and baked for 10 minutes. In the future, will replace the choc. chips with peanut butter chips. I really liked the taste of the cookie dough, but thought that the chocolate did not add that much to the cookie. (And yes, I do love chocolate!)

these were delicious, i used natural chunky peanut butter. the oats didn't really add much to them though, there were so few that each cookie had about 1 oat. beware, they really don't spread much so they are little balls and it's hard to tell when they are done, but don't overcook them and dry them oat, take them out when they still look under cooked.

THE BEST PEANUT BUTTER COOKIES, EVER! I used natural chunky Peanut butter. I ommited the chocolate and added 1 cup of honey roasted peanuts.

Great taste, though not without some problems. I made the cookies a little smaller than called for, so you'd think the baking time would be shorter, right? Wrong. It took about 12 minutes for them just to start spreading, and they definitely were not 'just starting to brown on top' until after about 16 minutes. The bottoms at this point were slightly overdone, though not burnt. The cooking times on Epicurious have usually been dead right with my oven. Maybe it was the pure 100% (no sugar, salt, emulsifiers or any additives) peanut butter I used. The cookies were very soft out of the oven, but hardened a bit more than I would like. I did get compliments when I brought them in to work, though, and they do taste yummy. I think I'll try making them in about 1"- 1.25" balls next time, and baking no more than 12 minutes.

Rating: 4
Very good!! Defintely a keeper in my recipe box. YUMM!!! Please note, that the cookies seem to lose their soft-like quality over time even when contained in an sir-tight container. If cookies start to turn hard, add a slice of bread into the container. The moistness of the bread will be adsorbed by the cookies, thus causing the bread to turn hard. An old trick my mother taught me.

Made these cookies tonight for the first with the ingredients, except I ran out of unbleached, all-purpose white flour and had to substitute with 100% whole wheat flour for the extra 1/2 cup of required flour. Could not taste the difference. Wonderful recipe, easy as ever to make. Soft inside, chewy outside. I am not a cook or baker by all means and I couldn't even goof up this one! Yielded around 40 cookies (based on the overstuffed one-tablespoon instructions), but am not complaining. Curious to know what the nutritional facts are.

I'm still trying to perfect these, but they're pretty darn good. I'm using natural PB, which is not as sweet, and also drier due to the lack of oil/emulsifiers or whatever. This time I added 1/4 cup white sugar (in addition to the 1c brown and the honey), and also 1/4 cup of plain yogurt, to thin them out a little and try to keep them more moist. Make sure you don't over-cook them -- they really need to be underbaked -- for me that's about 9-10 minutes. I tried some without the air-bake cookie sheet, and they burned, so stick with the air-bake!!!

Did not end up with puffy round cookies, but very nicely shaped cookies with a good texture.

Delicious - a real keeper. Couldn't be easier (especially with a KitchenAid mixer) and they came out perfectly.

These cookies were really yummy! I suggest making them with unsalted peanut butter or skip the extra salt if you're using salted. I only had creamy PB on hand, which is what I prefer to use, anyway. Unfortunately, I didn't have any honey, so I substituted a bit of corn syrup, molasses, and maple syrup. No worries...the cookies turned out really well! I'll definitely use honey next time, though. I liked the additions of oats and chocolate, which made for a more hearty cookie. The best thing about them is that they're very low-maintence: easy to form, they freeze really well, and they keep even better. Make sure to not over bake them - I found that they were especially good a little undercooked but left on the hot cookie sheet to cool. YUM!

These cookies were great. I made them with the help of my 4 year old nephew and they tasted and looked like gourmet cookies from a bakery. I just dropped the dough in spoonfulls onto the baking sheet. They flattened out nicely while baking. Also, I put in less chocolate chunks than they said. I usually prefer less chocolate. But next time I'll probably use the full amount. The chocolate goes so well with the peanut butter taste that you want chocolate in every bite.

Over the years I´ve baked many types of cookies and these are hands-down my favorite, they're chunky and so scrumptious, and so easy to make. I do flatten them with a fork prior baking and use parchment paper as another cook has suggested. The texture is incredible! Please try this even if its your first time baking cookies (follow suggestions, though!), you won't regret it!

This recipe is great and so easy. I use whole wheat pastry flour and add extra chocolate chips. Everyone at work loves these cookies.

This cookie is DELICIOUS!! It's great for fans of the classic peanut butter cookie and the chocolate makes it even that much better. Extremely easy to whip up. Refrigerating the dough is key, makes for a much hearty cookie. Thanks for the recipe!

These were great cookies -- easy to make, good-sized batch and stayed chewy and fresh for a few days stored in a ziploc.

Really, really good! I used a cookie-scoop ... and then flattened them with a fork. If you don't do this I don't think they would spread very much, so be careful, unless you like igloo shaped cookies. Well, I did the whole lot by hand, no big deal, and had great fun creaming all the gunk. I didn't have chunky peanut butter, so just threw in roasted whole peanuts. This is a wonderful recipe, and beats your boring, bland, usual peanut butter cookie

these were really good. much better than the average pb cookie. course, i overcooked them a little because i didnt trust they were done, but even at that, still a do-again. as to ease, if i didn't have a kitchenaid, i wouldn't bake half as much, and certainly wouldnt have creamed all this gunk together by hand. kudos to the hardy souls! now, if i could just get an oven that would sense doneness....

I did not find this recipe time consuming at all, but that may be due to the help of my Kitchen Aide mixer. I made these for my partner and myself and we both loved the cookies a great deal. They were moist and delicious. I brought in the left overs to the office and they were consumed in a matter of minutes. Instead of chocolate chunks, I used a mixture of milk chocolate and peanut butter chips - yummy.

The cookies were fantastic. They are very rich cookies so I might try to make them smaller the next time. Everyone loved them!!

This recipe was a little time-consuming, but still fairly easy. The peanut butter flavor is balanced with the honey. I got rave reviews from my friends, who had never before tasted a peanut butter, chocolate chip and oatmeal cookie!

Rating: 4
What a fabulous cookie! I skimped just a little on the brown sugar, added an extra spoonful of peanut butter, and chopped up the oatmeal. They took exactly 12 minutes to cook and came out with a wonderful soft, yet crumbly texture. I used high quality dark chocolate and some dark chocolate chips. The peanut butter taste is there but not overwhelming and I think the honey really gives them a depth of flavor. I will definitely be making these again!

Most peanut butter cookies seem to turn out dry, but not these. They are truly chewy and remain so even after a couple of days... which is as long as they seem to last around here. Another keeper!

Rating: 4
This is my favorite cookie recipe. For an even richer peanut butter taste, I add 6 oz peanut butter chips. Chilling the dough is key, and these cookies even freeze well (if they last that long).

A really good peanut butter cookie! I like chewy cookies, and these have stayed moist and chewy. I used natural peanut butter, and it turned out fine. I also skipped the chocolate chunks. This is my new recipe for pb cookies!

mmmm.... so yummy!! i would definately make these again but i cut down on the sugar by 1/4 cup, they were very sweet for my taste with all that sugar, honey and peanut butter! but they were very good otherwise. i also made them smaller than the recipe said, this way there's more!

We made these for a birthday treat and substituted chopped chocolate covered peanut clusters for the chocolate ingredient. Then we added a handful of chocolate chips to the recipe. The cookies were moist, rich and absolutely delicious. They puff up so they look good, too! Better than the dry bakery cookies around here...

These are the best "gourmet" peanut butter cookies I have made! My husband, kids, and the neighbors, all give it a HIGH FIVE! I used Orange Blossom Honey and King Arthur Flour. Note! Using unbleached flour seemed to be very important for the great texture. NOTE: 6/9/02 I just made two batches of these cookies, one using the last high quality orange blossom honey I had and one using a cheaper (but easier to purchase) Kroger brand honey. Oh my goodness.. USE GOOD HONEY! Kroger must be watering their honey down or something, a day and night difference.. same day, same oven, same recipe. The quality honey had nice texture and were wonderful as usual.. the cheap honey produced flat and a fake honey flavor that over-powered the recipe.

I have been known to really louse up even the most basic cookie recipe. Not this one. I used semisweet chocolate chips (instead of chunks) and it still worked wonderfully. Delicious cookie. Definitely a keeper.

These are by far the best cookies I've made. When I make cookies for my friends and family I always use this recipe. However, I don't refrigerate the dough before baking and I think I get a better cookie that way. Don't pass this one up! It's a keeper!

This is a great cookie. I try lots of different cookies for my Debbie Does Desserts business. I was tired of my old recipe and wanted something new. I made my own peanut butter, added 1/2 cup oats and used milk chocolate chips. My grandkids are my taste testers and it was a big thumbs up from them.

I always bring cookies to work on Mondays. Since I have quite a few co-workers I made them a little smaller and cut the baking time to 10 min. which worked out great. Everyone loved the cookies. They tasted great and were nice and soft. I was worried when I took them out of the oven, they were so soft they didn't seen done. They were just starting to brown on top as the recipe indicated so I took them out. (I was tempted to leave them in longer). When they cooled they firmed up. Recipe is definitely a keeper.

in a word...FABULOUS! i used king arthur unbleached flour, creamy peanut butter and 3-4 ounces ghiradelli semi-sweet chocolate chips (i cut down as the first batch i made was too chocolately)...they are wonderful!

Rating: 4
These have been my "best" cookies for a long time--what I make when I want to impress. They manage to be both homey and sophisticated. I adapted the last batch to be vegan by substituting margarine for the butter, 1/3 cup water blended with 1 T flaxseed until emulsified for the egg, and a combination of corn and maple syrup for the honey. Baked for 8 minutes, and they are spectacular!

this cookie is wonderful as a cookie...but i was really looking for a more peanut buttery taste, really a classic peanut butter cookie, but the other "classic" peanut butter cookie recipes got such dismal reviews, it didn't seem worth it. i used whole wheat flour and smooth commercial peanut butter and they turned out soft and chewy.

Fantastic recipe! We made these just yesterday for my 9-year-old daughter's 4-H Christmas Cookie Contest, which took place this morning...and she won first place! The recipe (including cooking time) was followed precisely with the exception of using semi-sweet chocolate chips, and the results were delicious. My husband consumed four of them before he could stop himself - we'll definitely make this one again.

Ok, I flattened the cookies with my wet(clean)hand. I followed the recipe exactly (GASP) and baked for 12 mins. First bite I loved them then I started to read the reviews while eating the cookie :( I do think that they are a little salty. But The chocolate helps with that, no salt next time. My cookies are soft and chewy, mind you they are still warm....(two hours later they are still soft and chewy and salty but yummy!) I think that there ARE better cookies out there yetI will make these again. the oats make the cookie special somehow... I do like these and am off to get one (or three) more.....

what more could you ask for in a cookie? Chocolate, Peanut butter and oatmeal-great cookie. I didn't use chunky PB and did not flatten with a fork, my baking time was exactly like the recipe and came out with 29 cookies. Very light and chewy. I will make them again.

I've made this recipe twice, and will probably make it many more times. This is a great cookie. Follow the directions carefully and watch your dry ingredients measurements, as this cookie has a tendency to be dry if you don't get the ratio of dry to wet ingredients right!

Definitely flatten the cookies. Mine came out too lumpy, and they just weren't big enough. I used Nestle Tollhouse semi-sweet morsels, and I wish I had used real baking chocolate. The morsels just weren't chunky enough. My oven is usually perfect, but I found that 12 minutes gave me cookies with pretty dark bottoms. I'd recommend 11 minutes.

Soft and chewy - easy to prepare. How big were everyone's cookies? I got 4 1/2 dozen good sized cookies.

These are excellent cookies...I baked on parchment paper and had no sticking problems. Very crunchy as they were flattened with a fork prior to baking. My only problem was fork sticking as the dough warmed. I kept unbaked dough in refrigerator and dipped fork into flour prior to flattening cookies, but needed to shake flour off so it wasn't transferred. Probably should use my hands next time. Between the chocolate chunks, the nuts in the peanut butter and the oatmeal, these are really terrific.

Rating: 4
This has become my all-time favorite cookie recipe. I have never had a tray of these cookies turn out badly, and they never last long in any setting! I always use natural peanut butter such as Laura Scudder, but typically put in whatever chocolate squares I have on hand (anything from Bakers to Ghiradelli) and have had great results every time. Yum!

Rating: 4
TERRIFIC!!! Peanut butter cookies are one of my all-time faves, and this is one of the best I've had. I made them for a friend who had me over for dinner, and she and her husband raved about them. I used Jif Extra Chunky Peanut Butter, which I found perfect for this, and Ghiradelli Double Chocolate Chocolate Chips, which gave it a "grown up" tase. I also flattened them out with a large fork; in fact, in the March '97 issue, there is a picture of the cookies and they are flattened out. I think they just left that part out of the recipe. Anyway, I will make these again and again and again.

Rating: 3
Agree with reviewer who flattened cookies - makes a chewier, more conventional peanut butter cookie. Made the first batch per recipe and then "played with" remaining sheets, varying degree of flatness. Flavor is great and the oatmeal adds a little texture without compromising peanut butter flavor. I used 5 oz semi sweet mini morsels and would make them the same way again and then flatten with a fork.

A very good recipe. However, I doubled the recipe and increased the the amount of oats to 2 1/2 cups plus added 1 tsp. baking powder.

I absolutely love this recipe. I still have the original issue of Bon Appetit that it was published in! I always get asked for the recipe by those who are lucky enough to sample them before my boyfriend eats them all. The trick is to leave them slightly underbaked so they're really moist, not crumbly.

A very good cookie! Okay, okay I made one small substitution..I didn't have American semi-sweet chocolate on hand so I used a Belgian semi-sweet bar with hazelnuts. The combination of peanuts and hazelnuts made the cookie delicious, not to mention the taste of belgian chocolate. Blew more than a few diets at the office.

These cookies are eaten too fast at our home! My kids are picky eaters-- even when it comes to sweets, but these cookies hit the spot. My husband has a new favorite. Great texture, but one batch go over done (my 5-year old turned off the timer!!!) and we crumbled them up for ice cream topping! Yum!

Even without the salt the recipe calls for, the cookies are too salty -- I think the amount of peanut butter needs to be reduced. Otherwise, they are a nice texture and reasonable taste, and I shall make them again, using less peanut butter and more chocolate.

After the first batch came out, I flattened the cookies a bit (they didn't spread on the first batch). One other reviewer suggested to add a couple pieces of the chocolate to the top, which I did. It made a much better presentation. For me, these were even better the second day (chewy and softer).

Awesome, baby. Really great taste and texture -- I made it for my wife on Mother's Day -- loved it and has made it several times since.
