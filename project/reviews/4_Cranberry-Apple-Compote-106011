Can this recipe be canned?

Very good. I used apple juice, 4 Tbl butter and increased the cranberries to 3 cups. Next time I will cut the butter down to 2 Tbl as it didn't seem to add much to the recipe except calories.

Since my original review in December '09, this compote remains the star of the Boxing Day Brunches, so much so that I now quadruple the recipe so the guests can go home with their own stash of compote. I have made two changes. I do not add that 1/2 cup of sugar to the cranberry-apple mixture; for those counting calories, the butter added to the reduced cider is yummy but not necessary. The reduction is tangier without the butter. Enjoy!

I made this compote and put it on top of baked brie. It turned out beautifully and was enjoyed by all!

Compote was great! I always worry when making this type of stuff that it won't thicken...but it did of course when it sat overnight. Just heat through a bit before putting on your egg nog french toast.

I used peeled, ripened pears instead of apples, and it was outstanding. The leftovers I used on plain cheesecake a few days later. Absolutely delcious!

Decided to make the Eggnog french toast with leftover eggnog from the holidays. The Compote looked wonderful and I decided to make it also, though I knew I didn't have cranberries. I ended up using berry juice instead of cider, cherries and blueberries instead of cranberries, and a couple tablespoons of agave (or honey) instead of the sugar and corn syrup...It was quite good. Hopefully I will be able to make it with cider and cranberries sometime.

OMG! Generally, I'm not interested in any sauce that doesn't have chocolate, but this is the one of the few glorious exceptions! This is the second year that I served this as part of our Boxing Day holiday brunch, with the guests clamoring for it again. This year, I doubled the recipe so the guests could take some home, along with the printed recipe, which was very much appreciated. This compote would make a lovely hostess gift over the holidays, which is what I am threatening to do next year--again! Because some have a sensitivity to corn, my only change was to substitute 1 cup of maple syrup (Grade B) for the corn syrup and golden brown sugar, which increased the reduction time 2 or 3 times over. The only problem with this recipe was finding fresh cranberries, so I have made a note to buy them at the beginning of the month, not the end! Enjoy!

This was scrumptious! I made it for Christmas breakfast last year (with eggnog french toast) and it was a hit - I plan to do the same again. It's actually quite versatile, I used the leftovers as an accompaniment to duck. For me, the rich buttery sauce is perfection. Easy and quick to make, and you can prepare it in advance.

This was an amazing recipe to mix traditional Thanksgiving cranberry sauce with a new twist. The only thing I would say about the recipe is to make sure you cut the apples up fairly small, and you can use a whole bag of 12oz. cranberries (3 cups instead of 2) It had a little to much apple, which for me was fine, but it is cranberry sauce.

The Compote isn't a MUST with the Eggnog Fench Toast, but my guests raved about it, so I would definatly make it again. It took about 10 minutes to make and I did it the day before. We only used about 1/2 of the finished product, so I gave the left overs to my moter-in-law who wanted to make the recipe the next day.

Made this for my family the morning after Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit. I didn't let it set in the eggnog mixture for several hours, as called for, and used pumpkin eggnog, and it was delicious.

I loved this, and so did my family. We made it for a French Toast topping, and it was perfect. I gave it 4 forks, even though I made a little ((big) mistake by using 1 c sugar instead of 1/2, but I quickly added another cup of cranberries and another apple. It's still too sweet, I'm sure, but so we just spread it a little thinner. Overall, a winner! And SO glad to have another way to eat these lovely cranberries.

This is the best! I make it all the time now as a desert, spooned over vanilla ice cream after warming! Phenomenal!

This was absolutely delicious. I used 1 cup apple juice, 1 T brown sugar, 1 T maple syrup and just a dab of butter. I added cinnamon, clove, vanilla, and nutmeg to this which tasted great. Then I used two apples and about 1.5 C cranberries and maybe a tablespoon of sugar. It was very flavorful and everyone loved it over french toast.

This is great and easy. Wonderful on the Eggnog French Toast.

Do your waistline and taste buds a favor and skip the butter in this recipe. It is far too overwhelming for the fruit. I made the mistake of following the recipe to the letter, even though skeptical that so much butter was necessary. Fortunately you can skim a lot of it off if you chill and then reheat later. Otherwise, this is a delicious companion to the french toast and many other things (ice cream, cake,...).

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone raved!! We spooned it over the turkey and the comination of flavors was just outstanding! I don't normally like cranberries - so I think it was the apple cider and apples in this compote really made it work for me! This one will certainly be a holiday tradition in our house from now on.

I made this for Christmas and we served it over waffles and french toast. I gave some to my cousin-who is pretty picky-and she loved it. Very nice blend of sweet and tangy.

Wonderful on eggnog french toast as well as vanilla ice cream!

Like I said in the review for the accompanying french toast recipe, it's a bit spicy rather than sweet. But that can be altered to suit your taste or you can drizzle maple syrup on top to sweeten it up a bit. A nice fruity touch to a rich recipe.

I made the compote to accompany the Eggnog French Toast for a Christmas breakfast for friends and they all raved over it. I thought it was tasty with just a tiyn bit of tartness--a nice contrast to the sweet toast.
