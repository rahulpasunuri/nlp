Surprisingly good for such few ingredients. Peace of cake to put together, too. Try it.

Wonderful and so easy to make. I love creamy potato salads but don't care for the classic type w/ egg and mustard in the dressing. This really fit the bill for me! I made it exactly as written and was quite pleased.

I love love this recipe. I change a couple things. I usually make this with 5# of potatoes so adjust accordingly. I zest one lemon and juice 2. I forgot about the chives so I don't even put any onion in now. I added celery. Finally, I start with 4 cloves of garlic and then taste. I don't bother with the garlic paste. I either dice with knife or press. Usually, I end up adding 2-3 more. I make the dressing the day before. Then when I am ready to serve, I place the dressing in a big bowl, pour the cooked potaotes in and taste. That is when I add more garlic. This taste best when hot but not too hot.

For those of you concerned with the raw garlic, consider blanching it with the potatos for a jew minutes just before they are done. This will temper the flavor just a bit.

This is an excellent recipe -- I used a mix of baby yellow, red and blue potatoes, green onion instead of chives and reduced-fat vegan mayo. Despite the changes, the salad is fantastic and packs lots of garlic punch.

This is such a wonderful salad, a nice change from the traditional "made with egg" recipe. Everytime I make it, it never lasts for very long; have also made it for pot lucks, and it is usually one of the first dishes to empty! You know you have a keeper when everyone (at the potluck) either asks who has the recipe or recommends another person to try the dish! My only advice is to add an extra clove or two of garlic, only if you love it, otherwise stick to the original recipe - tried and true.

Very nice recipe. I used baby purple potatoes, which cave it a lovely, unusual color. At first I was skeptical that the dressing mixture was too watery, but the warm potatoes absorbed it quite well and the texture was fine.

I used Yukon Gold potatoes which are far superior to boiling potatoes. I roasted a whole head of garlic which imparted better flavor than raw garlic. Cut the mayonnaise to 1/4 C., more than enough. I get rave reviews!

Wonderful, different take on potato salad. I served this with Bourbon Molasses Chicken Drumsticks and Grilled Corn with Citrus Butter. Perfect combo!

I made this recipe with thyme since I did not have chives and it came out quite good. I agree with another reviewer about quantity of mayo - only 1/4 cup is needed.

No leftovers. Delicious and simple to prepare. The mayonnaise is necessary or it wouldn't be the same recipe at all however 1/4 C. is enough. I did add more garlic because I love it.

Yummm. Didn't need more mayo at all, in my opinion, which is nice because I prefer not to add more fat. Excellent contrast of the lemony tang with the sweetness of the russet potatoes I used.

My guests and family all thought this recipe was fantastic. I used the Best Foods/Hellman's reduced fat mayo (green label) and it was great!

I had no chives and substituted it with scallions; I also used a 1/4 more of mayonnaise to make a creamier salad and it was divine! Serve this with the Cod Cakes recipe available through Epicurious and voila! Another tip: spoon the potato salad on top of a bed of spinach!

Superb!! Only used 3 T. of lemon juice, and left the skins on the potatoes (I used small red potatoes). I put the garlic through a press & then mashed with the salt. Served with Grilled Porterhouse with Tarragon-Tomato Salad, also from this site.

This potato salad is a real crowd-pleaser for a picnic/barbecue. Be prepared to have your guests ask for the recipe!

One of our favorites - the closest we can get to one of the most popular recipes at our local tapas restaurants. I usually add an additional clove or two of garlic, and use only the 3 T. of lemon juice - any more and it gets too sour for us. This is an excellent way to use up our "nuclear chives", which never seem to stop growing, despite rain, wind, drought, snow...

I actually love garlic and frequently up the quantity in pasta dishes etc ... but this very garlicky potato salad just didn't do it for me.

Rating: 3
This was pretty good. I do think it needed extra lemon juice and salt. My potatoes were underdone...but that seems to be a chronic problem with me. I'd make it again.

This also is one of my staples. I'm glad to find the original recipe again since it has mutated over the years!

Our family favorite. I've been making this for years. Sometimes I peel the potatoes, sometimes not, and always add fresh cracked black pepper. I think the key is to serve at room temp.

Very good - use plenty of salt, a little extra lemon, and one extra clove of garlic.

Very good! I used red-skinned potatoes and left the skin on. Definitely added much more lemon than the recipe called for. Have extra lemon juice on hand and try adding more a little bit at a time. Everyone loved the zesty kick it had.

Used this as a side dish for grilled pork and wow did it ever make everyone want to go back for seconds! Nice little recipe!

Absolutely wonderful if you love garlic - one guest commented that he would even like more garlic in it. Very simple to prepare and great when potatoes are still slightly warm.

The lemon adds a nice change to the traditional potato salad.

I enjoyed this zesty potato salad. I added a dash of lemon pepper for extra zip.

This is a wonderful salad, especially if you love garlic. It's a cinch to make and probably less fattening than other potato salads because it uses very little mayo. I've made it many times and will continue to do so. A definite winner!

OK but not outstanding. I think I'll try something else next time

We love garlic! What a delicious and simple change from the traditional. Made it twice in one week! Definitely use redskinned potatoes, white ones not as tasty and do not seem to absorb flavors as well. Can be made 30 to 45 mins. before eating and even good if potatoes are still warm.

Very intense garlic flavor - definitely for garlic lovers. I have substituted yogurt and sour cream for the mayo.
