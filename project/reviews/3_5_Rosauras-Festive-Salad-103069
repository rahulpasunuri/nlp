I made this salad for a group of about 20 and although it was interesting and good, it didn't go over that well. You have to be careful with the beets as they discolor the other ingredients. Lots of chopping and slicing.

This is a great salad. Do becareful with the beets. They can dye the jicama pink.

I will definately make this salad again. This dressing recipe would be nice on other salads as well. I forgot to put in the croutons, when I had seconds and used the croutons, I discovered I liked it better without. I have to try harder to find the amaranth seeds, curious to see the difference.

Absolutely wonderful! I made the salad for a family party as an accompaniment to a Mexican themed menu. Everyone loved it -- especially the mix of beets, jicama and candied pineapple. Unfortunately, I could not find puffed Amaranth seeds anywhere. I found, through my search, that they are often sold as cereal in health food stores. No luck though. Note to cooks, this makes a boatload of salad. Even too much for 12. Will certainly half recipe next time. Give this recipe a try!!!

All my guests requested this recipe. The julienne blead on my cuisinart made short work of this recipe.
