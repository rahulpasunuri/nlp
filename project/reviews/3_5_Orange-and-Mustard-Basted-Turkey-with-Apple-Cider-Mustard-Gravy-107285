My Husband makes this turkey every year and he is forbidden to change one single thing! I serve it with a Grand Marnier stuffing and guests rave. Everyone wants a "care package" of leftovers to take home so this year we're making two turkeys to make sure there is enough for all!

This recipe is absolutely delicious! Everyone raved about how juicy the turkey was and how the gravy tasted great even on mashed potatoes! A must try!

I made this turkey the last two Thanksgivings and it turned out great both times. The gravy is delicious - it makes a TON, though, always way more than I need. Definitely a keeper in my recipe book!

I have made this dish three times and each time have received many reviews about the superb moistness and flavor from my guests. The gravy is pretty good but the turkey itself is outstanding.

Once again the kids liked this slighlty sweet recipe. Next time I will sub wine for the apple cider or maybe add a little balsamaic vineger. Also I stuffed some of the butter under the skin for added flavor.

The apple gravy was a huge hit!

Everyone raved about this when I made it for Thanksgiving. "Like turkey, only better!!"

It was very good and simple to make, compared to other turkey recipes. The sking got a little dry, but I'm not sure if it was the turkey or the temperature in the oven. Keep basting it often (every 30 min). Overall a very good recipe, especially for people who don't like to do complicated recipes (if you can say that about a Thanksgiving Turkey...!!)

I served the gravy today at Thanksgiving lunch and everyone loved it even the kids. I highly recommend it. My additions were to add sauted Turkey liver and the pan vegetables all pureed.
