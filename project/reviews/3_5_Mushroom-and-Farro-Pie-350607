Thanks to the reviews I cooked the farro in chicken stock, increased the ricotta to 1.5 cups and added 1/2 cup of parmesan. I also sauteed some pancetta before adding the mushrooms. Awesome...

I religiously read reviews for Epi recipes, but guess I forgot for this one, before saving as something I want to make. The mushroom/farro mix was delish before adding to the pastry. I hesitated to add any more salt, but should have. Though bland (as other reviewers have mentioned), the presentation was beautiful. I cut out a few flowers from the pastry I trimmed from the edges. Will make again, but will try punching up the flavor per some others' suggestions. I think the farro/mushroom/ricotta mixture on its own could make a great side.

I doubled the garlic, added an onion, added spinach, fresh sage AND lemon juice--and cooked the farro in broth the way others suggested--and it still needed more flavor! I hate to turn to cheese for that, but next time I might mix in just a hint of vermont cheddar or another more pungent cheese. Different varieties of mushrooms, and maybe cooking the farro in the water of rehydrated mushrooms, would probably also help. With all that said, I'll definitely use this as a recipe for playing around with in the future.

Great for vegetarians and non, alike. Really easy to make. I used a mixed bag of mushrooms in season at the farmer's market (cremini, shitake and trumpet)and pearl barley. Delicious!

At other reviewers' urging, I punched up the flavor a little by using 4 cloves of garlic instead of 2; cooking the farro in stock rather than water; adding about 1 tsp. of dried thyme with the mushrooms; 1.5 cups of ricotta instead of 1 cup; and adding 1/4 cup grated pecorino to the mix before enclosing it with pastry. Delicious. We are not vegetarians and decided this would be a great main for a vegetarian dinner party if served with some sauce: maybe red pepper cream sauce or something colorful? Very pretty, easy, and satisfying.

I have made this several times already: as a main dish for vegetarian friends as well as a side dish with roast beef. I use pearled barley and a generous amount of garlic and ricotta cheese. The addition of 3/4oz of dried porcini mushrooms, hydrated, squeezed dry, coursly chopped and sauteed with the cremini mushrooms really ups the "meatiness" quota. A glass of red wine will be necessary! I also reserved, strained, and reduced by half the soaking liquid. This I then added to the vegetarian gravy recipe found in "Smashed Potatoes with Roasted Garlic Gravy, Gourmet, November 2008". It works fabulously; my confirmed meat and potatoes husband wanted seconds. THAT is a success!

I followed the other reviewers suggestions and bumped up the flavor. This was fantastic, even the meat eaters loved it. Used 4 large cloves or garlic, 3/4 C minced shallots instead of green onions,half Shitakes, half crimini, 1 tsp. fresh thyme and added 1/2 cup grated imported parmesan. Wonderful!

Regarding punching up the flavor: I make a barley mushroom casserole that is tasty and doesn't have wine, cheese or pastry crust. But a fine pearl barley is browned first with sauteed mushroom and onion in olive oil, and then cooked in a well- seasoned vegetable broth rather than water. I will incorporate my old method when I make this and post the results.

This recipe has a lot of potential, but needs more flavor. I used barley instead of farro, and I wouldn't recommend it! The recipe is really missing out on taste.

I think this recipe is a delicious vegetarian centerpiece. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I substituted a blend of chantrelles, a porcini-like local mushroom, and creminis instead of all cremini. I sauteed them separately to ensure that they were all properly cooked. I found the tart very satisfying, but I can imagine that it would be less interesting with only one type of mushroom.

Looks nice and it's hearty fare but I agree with those who say it's bland. I was hoping to serve this alongside turkey at a T'giving dinner involving a vegetarian and carnivores. Any ideas for punching the flavor up? The farro/barley is a substantial part of the recipe and it's the blandest part, I think. Butter? spices? Fire-roasted diced tomatoes?

Yes, this was gorgeous, but sadly, it lacked any flavor. The filling was very bland. You could try to punch it up, but I think the combination of farro and puff pastry ends up as boring.

I made a version of this tonight and it was fabulous (note, I made my own pastry rather than using frozen). There are a lot of directions you can take the stuffing for the pie but that core combination of farro, mushrooms and ricotta is really good. It's a wonderful "comfort food" dish.

Anything baked in puff pastry is delicious. But I'm not sure the guts of this recipe -- farro, onion, ricotta, mushrooms -- are quite flavorful enough to be considered the main course of a meatless Thanksgiving dinner. To me, it tasted more like a yummy side dish. Next time I make it, I'll be sure to add more seasoning and ingredients to the insides.

this is a great vegetarian main entree for a festive holiday meal. It's easy to make but it looks complicated and "fancy." It's great with the vegetarian gravy in the same menu.

I loved this recipe. I made it exactly as written. It was very easy to make. I found the farro at whole foods in a little package. But I think almost any kind of wheat would work. I served it at a dinner party and several people asked for the recipe. People who are vegetarians seem particularly interested in it because it looks festive and is delicious with gravy, so it's a great alternative to those loathsome tofurkeys that some vegetarians try to love at Thanksgiving. This is a much better option.
