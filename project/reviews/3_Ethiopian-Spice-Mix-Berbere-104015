This is a very good recipe for Berbere. I, also, mix the dry spices with Ghee to make a wet rub then add the dry mixture. Just made Berbere Chicken for lunch today... YUM !!!

Delicious berbere recipe -- I had enough to make a ton of Ethiopian food. I would definitely use this Berbere recipe again.

Just wanted to chime in that you can make berbere into a sauce and some recipes call for "berbere sauce". This is pretty much just berbere mixed with olive oil. And also, how did toast enter into this?

This is a pretty authentic Ethiopian recipe. It does need some rue, maybe 1/2 tsp. for this recipe. Ethiopian cooks tend to mix their spices by "feel" so play with this until you have exactly the right taste and heat. It should be hot.

there seems to be some confusion about Berbere. It is a dry powder spice mix of Ethiopian origin. Very distinct, very flavorful, and depending on the quantity used in a recipe can make a dish somewhat mild or quite spicy. Think of it like curry powders from India -- there are many different ways of preparing curry, and similarly, in ethiopia each family may have its own distinct blend for berbere. It is used to flavor meat and veggies prepared Ethiopian style, and though I've never heard of it spreading it on toast, a little sprinkle over a smear of butter could be good. I like mixing a little in with scrambled eggs, personally. Berbere can also be sprinkled on injera (Ethiopian bread) with the crumbly indigenous cheese and rolled up to make a tasty wrap. The sauce one reviewer may be thinking of is "awaze". Awaze is a mix of berbere with (again, it can vary quite a bit) lime juice, whisky, salt and olive oil. Awaze could be considered Ethiopian hot sauce, but berbere is not a sauce in and of itself. I hope this helps clarify a little. Happy eating!

I took out the fenugreek seeds and chiles because my family doesn't like spicy food even though I do. I thought it was really good. i put it on tofu with butter and it tasted very good.

If you are TRULY interested in making the real deal, you need to make it with Berbere peppers. These are what the sauce and blend are named for, not paprika or mexican peppers. Grow from seed or buy plants from Cross Country Nursery. The rest of the recipe is fine and worked out well with the berberes I had at the end of the hot summer.

i thought berbere was usually a sauce? all these spices cooked dry, first, and then blended in with water and oil?

I lived in Ethiopia for many years. When I returned to the US I kept a large mayonnaise jar filled w/berbere which I used for years as seasoning in spaghetti sauce, stews, meat loaf, chicken even. I never used it on toast though I should have tried it -- those of us who like spicy food can think of nothing tastier in the morning than coffee accompanied by a buttered, toasted english muffin with hot sauce sprinkled on top!

One might put niter kebbeh (spiced butter) on toast... This mix is pretty yummy. I would roast the mix for 10 -15 min stirring every 5 in an warm oven (300'). Always good to have on hand and adds a kick to bbqs/grills.

I am glad that I finally have this seasoning recipe so that I might create the Ethiopian dishes I love. p.s. Considering the ingrediants, why would anybody put this on toast??

no, don't put this on toast, or eat it straight at all. it's a seasoning used in meat dishes (in traditional ethiopian cuisine) and sometimes with vegetables. this particular recipe is fairly good. most berbere recipes would call for about a half-cup of minced onion as well.
