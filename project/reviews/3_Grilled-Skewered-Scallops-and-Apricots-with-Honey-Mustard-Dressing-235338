this was superb...I think it depends on the freshness of the apricots and the quality of the scallops. I did place basil leaves between each because it needed it asthetically. It was the PERFECT light summer dinner for a crowd. Everyone LOVED it. Served it with a lemon herb asparagus couscous salad (also from Epicurious)

Not good at all....it was tasteless....we like grilled fruit but the apricots were not tasty with the marinade. Maybe if you marinate the scallops it might have been better but the flavor didn't stay on them as recipe is written. I will not make this again. there are so many other good scallop recipes to offer.

i did not like this recipe at all. i like all the components seperately, but not together. i didn't think the tanginess of the dressing with the intense sweetness belonged together. the scallops were really bland.

This was easy and tasty. The grilled apricots added a sweet contrast to the dressing. Next time I think I will marinate the scallops before grilling

To call this recipe average would be generous. There are a lot of great recipes out there for scallops, so I will not be making this again.

The key to this recipe is to find really ripe apricots. The flavor of the hot apricots with the scallops is sublime. Next time I would marinate the scallops in the dressing for several hours. Delicious!
