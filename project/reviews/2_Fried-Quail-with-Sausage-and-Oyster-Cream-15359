At a glance, it's plain to see that this recipe just won't work. First off, it's crying out for some acid to balance it. How about deglazing the pan with white wine? We could go on and on. Better yet, just let this one rest in peace.

The oysters totally overpowered the sauce. What an odd combination. I would not use oysters with the delicate quail. Served with rice. No one at the table liked this dish. I was very disappointed and embarassed.

I would fry the quail in the sausage grease. Most sausage would not make enough grease to be deep enough, so I would double the sausage and make a stuffing for the quail out of half of it. The next step, I would make milk gravy in the same skillet with the other half of the sausage and pour it over white rice. Then place the stuffed fried quail on the rice. This is a recipe that most any true southerner would know how to do. In most restaurants you would not have stuffing with rice at the same time. On the table of a red neck,You normally would not put sea food anywhere near a quail. However IF IT TASTE GOOD, PUT IT ON THE PLATE.

I don't eat quail but tried the sauce on rice and pork. It worked well with both. I did add some Tabasco to perk it up a little.
