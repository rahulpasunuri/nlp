Pavlova originated in New Zealand, not Australia. Like many actors, directors, musicians and chefs that originated in New Zealand but now Australia claims as their own.

I thought this was fabulous. It looks great and tastes equally as good. The pastry creme was a nice addition, i have made it with lemon curd before. I served in my cafe this past week and got rave reviews. By the way, this is a traditional Australian recipe, not American.

This was disappointing in almost every way. The meringue was too sweet, and heating it over a water bath was to me the equivalent of making a "7 minute frosting," if you are familiar with this american recipe. The pastry cream was too thick, and I ended up halving the sugar called for in the raspberry sauce. I would definitely not use this again. I will try a pavlova recipe that uses more traditional meringue and no pastry cream next time.
