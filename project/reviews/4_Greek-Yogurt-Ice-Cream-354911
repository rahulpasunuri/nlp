I found this recipe quite sweet, even after adding an extra cup of yogurt. And, I'm not sure the cream is necessary, though I could be wrong. I'd probably try to make it with just milk next time.

I make agave sweetened, greek yogurt ice cream in a high speed blender at consultations4health.blogspot It only has 3 ingredients!

This tastes more like cheesecake than yogurt. It is plenty rich with non-fat yogurt. However, the extra fat might make it stay softer in the freezer? I leave mine out at room temperature to soften for a couple minutes before serving. I am a big fan of cheesecakes, so I probably won't be making this again. cswalsh2002: Did you add the 1 cup heavy whipping cream?

I don't make ice cream often, but that may change. This is a wonderfully tangy, but sweet, ice cream with a lovely texture. It was a perfect foil to the buttermilk cake with pear compote. I realized once I began making this that I had 2%, not whole, yogurt and that it was a 7 ounce container rather than a full 8 ounces. We didn't notice any missing richness. One word of warning: this recipe, along with the cake, entails several steps so be sure to plan ahead.

I have made this twice and love the taste. The only problem I have with it is that it's way too hard. I have to leave it out for at least 10 minutes before I can even serve it. Does anyone have any suggestions?

This was absolutely devine. I served it with the raspberry buttermilk cake from the 6/09 issue of Gourmet. Huge hit with family and friends!

I am just about to make this and wanted to check the reviews. The online recipe omits an ingredient that was in the print version in the magazine-- i cup heavy whipping cream! I can only imagine that it will make all the better.

Fantastic. Not too sweet and perfect texture. Needs at least 2-3 pinches of kosher salt added at the end though, taste between each pinch to be on the safe side.
