On my second effort I carmelized the onions slightly and added some good quality feta and the recipe. The recipe went from good to special.

for christmas 2011 breakfast: grammie, ck, clint, and me. loved the recipe. used 10 inch frittata pan. perfect texture. next time use ever so slightly more pungent onion, not already sweet onion.

This should be called the blandest frittata ever. I don't love spicy food but this was way too far in the other direction. Maybe adding some bacon would've saved this dish??

What a great quick dinner! Didn't have the fresh marjoram, so I substituted some fines herbes, and was probably a tad generous with the parmesan... My cast iron is well-seasoned (used almost daily), so sticking wasn't an issue. Definitely a good working evening menu item.

Very tasty and wonderfully easy! I had half a carton of ricotta left over from lasagna, and was scrolling through recipes when I found this. It was so good I may well buy ricotta to use primarily in this recipe, not as a "leftover" for anything else. Didn't have fresh marjoram, but did have fresh thyme.

This frittata is delicious and so easy. It's become a staple in my house and everyone who tastes it wants the recipe. It is a simple dish with simple flavors. If that's what you're looking for, you've found it!

I LOVE this recipe with a few variations. I omitted the onions, added chopped garlic instead, and layered in fresh basil leaves and tomato slices.

This recipe is very easy and works well with alterations. I used a lot of zucchini instead of onions because I found zucchini goes very well with Ricotta cheese. I also found the receipe better when I poured the whole mixture to the pan without settling the egg on the stove. I put them straight to the oven and baked for 20 minutes. Delicious when fresh, not bad to reheat either.

This was pretty good. I added a couple cloves of garlic to the onions, and some marjoram to the egg mixture as well. I probably used 4-5 tbs. parmesean too since I grated too much. I reccommend eating this one right away. We had it at room tempurature and it just tasted a little stale.

This is delish! I had some leftover egg whites and wanted used them with this recipe, so I combined 4 whites with three large eggs. I also substituted oregano for marjoram, since I didn't have any and added a few tablespoons chopped fresh parsley. My only problem was turning it out neatly onto a plate -- it stuck to my cast-iron pan. I'll use more olive oil next time. Drizzling a little good olive oil on top is a nice touch too. Be careful not to overcook it.

Very nice way to use up some left over ricotta and eggs when I didn't want to go to the market. Tasty and light, definitely deserves a drizzle of fine olive oil on top.

Good basic recipe. Added some fresh greens and herbs to the onions. While the oil drips at the end were nice, overall was too oily. I'll use less initially next time to saute the onions.

This was very good! The olive oil drizzle at the end is a must (use the fruitiest extra-virgin stuff you've got), and I topped it off with a sprinkle of fleur de sel, which really brought out the beauty of the fresh ricotta.

Delicious, easy to make frittata! I use this as the basis for all my frittatas now. Easy to modify, great with leeks and mushrooms! Much easier to get out of the pan if you cook the veggies with olive oil before adding the eggs. Yummmm....

very good even though I did not use parmesan cheese...it did stick a little bit to the pan, but I was able to take it out and serve it like a cake cut up, even my kids loved it.
