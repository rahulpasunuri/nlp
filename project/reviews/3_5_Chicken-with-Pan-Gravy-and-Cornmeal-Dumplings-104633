Delicious! Rave reviews on this one from dinner guests. Notes: I salted the chicken as I initially placed it in the frying pan. As another reviewer pointed out, this recipe becomes easier if you prep/cut prior to starting. Please remember to reduce the heat on the gravy to a simmer prior to placing the dumplings in, and also remember to put the lid on to cover as the dumplings cook. So very yummy!

This is a fabulous dish with a couple modifications. 1)Reduce black pepper in dumplings to 1/8 tsp. 2)Add vegetables to gravy (carrots, string beans, spinach) For health, I skinned the chicken, skipped the heavy cream in the stock and used gluten-free baking mix for the dumplings. I substituted leeks from the garden for shallots. Fantastic comfort food.

Perfect comfort food for a snowy night. Gravy was fantastic and the dumplings flavorful and feather light. Didn't have heavy cream for the gravy so I used fat free sour cream instead. It was absolutely delish!

Makes its own gravy! My dumplings fell apart in the simmering broth and proceeded to thicken into a pot of cornmeal mush instead of the luscious little pillows you all have described. Granted, I just threw in the measured buttermilk instead of adding it a bit at a time - so the batter was probably just a little too thin. It should make for good polenta though.

This was so easy and delicious. I used chicken thighs and breasts rather than a whole chicken. The dumplings were fantastic and next time will add a little sage to make them taste more like my mothers stuffing recipe. (Cornbread/biscuit stuffing) Throughly enjoyed it warmed up the next day.

Well, the dumplings and gravy were fantastic.... but the chicken had zero taste. The chicken looked gorgeous -- brown and crispy -- but it tasted like nothing.

As another user said, this is "comfort food." Hubby and I both love this one. The chicken is always moist, the gravy and dumplings are flavorful, overal MMM! It may look daunting, but it really isn't hard to make. Just a little time consuming.

I've made this recipe many times and it is comfort food at its absolute best! Be sure that the gravy isn't too hot when adding the dumpling mixture or they'll fall apart. I'm curious, what's with the Bisquick? Do they top the finished product with ketchup too?

This looks like a lot of work, but if you chop all the herbs and veggies first and have it all ready it isn't hard at all. I added a finely chopped carrot and stalk of celery with the shallots for more color and taste and it was great.

This recipe is worth trying. The dumplings turn out light and fluffy. Be sure to brown the chicken well. I think next time I will take the chicken off the bone and add it to the gravy after cooking the dumplings. Still thinking about this dish the day after. Try it!

Thought the dumplings were great. Good butter flavor andgood texture with the cornmeal. I've used boneless thighs and breasts for this. Just pound to even thickness and brown. remove add shallots, carrots and celery then deglaze with wine. Add 1/2 and 1/2 and broth. Simmer until veggies are tender. Add dairy. I add the chicken to finish cooking when I top with the dumpling batter. This helps to keep the chicken from being dry. A really good recipe.

This was easier to make than I thought. Don't tell my husband though he thought it was a realy gourmet meal. He loved it. My young kids enjoyed the chicken but weren't interested in the dumplings.

The chicken was very tasty and tender. However, the dumplings did not work for me. They did not have a good flavor. I will stick with my grandmother's dumpling recipe, which has no equal in my opinion.

This is a great recipe. We make it with canned chicken my husband's mother makes. It totally makes a richer sauce and the taste is out of this world. You just peel the chicken right off the bone. We make this at least once a month. It's the best.

Very delicious recipe. My husband loves this and always hopes there's a bit of leftovers for the next day. Sometimes we have made this recipe with chicken that his mother cans in a pressure cooker. It gives a much richer flavor and the gravy is awsome...a bit naughty but nummy. This is a recipe that we make at least once a month.

I really enjoyed this dish, and was pleased with the simplicity as I have never made dumplings before. Modified it by using about 2lbs of chicken breast strips that i needed to use. Also made the dumplings smaller for a couple of reasons, first of which I wanted to eat sooner! Simple flavors, pure comfort food!

This is excellent and has replaced all my chicken and dumplings recipes! The dumplings are buttery and delicious not those hard hockey pucks a bad recipe can give you. I also add carrots and celery to it. You MUST give this is a try. This is a lot faster and easier than all those directions may seem.

Since I was making a stew in order to use up various ingredients in the fridge, I only made the dumpling component of this recipe. But, I have to comment that they were outstanding. After various failed attempts, this is the first dumpling recipe I have ever used where the dumplings were fluffy and tender, yet just firm enough so that they entirely held together. Thank you Epicurious! I was beginning to think I was dumpling challenged! :D

Stop reading the reviews, and start getting out your ingredients. This recipe is far beyond whatever you imagine. Even though it was my first time making this kind of dumpling, I was planning ahead when I could have the leftovers. The chicken was succulent and flavorful (make sure you use a good white wine) and just finger-and-plate-licking good. The stock really enhances the natural tastes in the poultry, and unifies it with the gravy 100%. This might be my new favortite dish.

I'll make the dumplings again with another dish. That's for sure. In my opinion, this receipe was missing something that would make me crave it later.

This recipe was generally easy to make and very, very satisfying. I made it for my husband who has a cold and it brought a big smile to his face. I added carrots, peas and mushrooms to make a complete one-pot meal. Don't be tempted to shorten the recipe by not making the dumplings. They are the soul of this meal. Just use a pastry cutter to work the butter into the dry ingredients and don't go over board stirring the dough. Also, make sure the gravy is simmering gently while the dumplings are cooking. That way you won't end up with mush! I used a quartered chicken which worked out fine. Next time I think I will use legs and breasts only for simplicities sake. I agree that the dark meat adds flavor. Also, choose cuts that don't have a huge amount of fat, it cuts down on the skimming!

Comfort food at it's BEST! Took the advice to add vegetabes tossed in chunks of carrots for some colour. Didn't have buttermilk on hand so soured some milk with a little of vinegar, you get the same chemical reaction the dumplings were perfect, fluffy and light yummy!

Bisquick, boneless chicken breasts???? Okay Anaheim, I don't know which recipe you made, but it wasn't this one!

Rating: 4
Wonderful recipe - I followed it exactly and everything came out perfectly, though it took me about 15 minutes to brown the chicken thoroughly. I had no problems with the dumplings coming apart like other reviewers have commented - they were compact, light, and fluffy. One thing though, I made it using my favorite boxed organic chicken broth, which is much richer and flavorful than the canned stuff, and it was a mistake - by the time it had cooked down it tasted far too much like rendered buillion cubes. Next time, I'll make sure I use the more watery brands, like Swanson. Do not attempt to make this dish using boneless/skinless breasts and thighs - the savory flavor of the finished product relies heavily on the juices from the dark, fatty parts of the bird (I even cooked it with the innards in, even though I don't eat organ meats). The cornmeal really made the dumplings - as another reviewer said, it's really a forgotten treasure! Overall, this recipe was absolutely perfect. Follow it exactly and you will definitely be pleased.

This was one of the yummiest things I have ever made. I added carrots and peas (added carrots with the dumplings, cooked the peas separately then added them in just before serving) for a one pot meal....oh mama was it good. And the kids liked it too.

This was pretty good. I had to add some vegetables to it because that just seems like the right thing to do. I put some canned corn, frozen carrots, and fresh mushrooms in because that was all I had. The dumplings didn't stay together very well. BUt it still turned out okay. I kept the chicken in the gravy the whole time. I had to transfer everything to a pot eventually because my skillet wasn't big enough. All in all, a pretty good recipe.

This was a tasty meal that served up equally well as leftovers the next day. We used boneless chicken breasts and made basic dumplings from Bisquick. We doubled the gravy and used half & half instead of heavy cream. It's easy to make, tastes good, and is really filling! We'll definitely make it again.

I used this recipe as a starting point for a simplified version -- used boneless chicken breasts, and added half and half and mushrooms with the shallots. Then made quick biscuits instead of dumplings, and served the chicken with peas and corn on the side. Was delicious, and very easy.

The flavor was wonderful and there were no leftovers, but the dumplings didn't hold together well. Just kind of lumpy mushy gravy... Next time I will add an egg to the dumplings and see what happens.

Added carrots and celery to the dish and used 1/2&1/2 instead of heavy cream. Also used chicken breast and found that the recipe goes quite fast and the whole family loved it. From age 6 to age 73.Next time I will add more vegetables and double the gravy and dumplings.

I used chicken breasts with this and it turned out really well. The cornmeal dumplings are nice, careful not to overmix or add too much liquid. Overall, homey and comforting. Passed this on to a friend who loved it. Will make it again.

I would make this dish again but I think I would just bake the chicken and then go from there with the drippings. The gravy came out good, no problems. The dumplings - I flipped them over in the gravy towards the end because I didn't forsee them hardening on top anytime soon and I didn't want the gravy to simmer down into a paste. The chopped parsley at the end was just the thing to brighten a very beige, albeit tasty, meal. The 1-3/4 hours time to prepare this dish is not an exaggeration btw.

My mother hated cooking and used to make chicken and dumplings out of Jiffy baking mix, I thought I'd try something different. THIS WAS A HUGE HIT! My boyfriend loved it, I made it for his family for a sunday dinner and they ask for it again and again. The chicken can be done many different ways to make it look pleasing. It really isn't THAT time consuming, at least not for someone who loves to cook.

I thought this receipe was absolutely delicious. My husband is extremely fussy and finished every morsel on his plate. I did make one addition though, which was lemon chicken broth. It was quite by accident, since that is the only broth I had in the house, and it just added an extra special something.

I enjoyed this dish more than my husband. The dumplings and gravy were excellent! The chicken could have been cooked a bit longer though. When I make this again, I'll double the recipe for the dumplings. Especially if I plan to serve 4.

I have made this dish many times, and even my kids love it. I usually slice up some baby carrots and sometimes peas to add to the chicken while it simmers.

I agree with Nancy on every aspect of her review; in the end, a very dissapointing recipe. I found the gravy to be way too rich (and I even used lowfat buttermilk) and I didn't like the dumplings at all. However, my husband loved it! ...and then finished all of the leftovers.

My husband unbeknownst to me loves dumplings..I have never made them before....what a hit !!! Not the floury goo I tried at my in'laws but a light almost cornbread like dumpling!!!.I followed suggestions and took the boneless skinless route ( used breasts and thighs) perhaps that is why I didn't think the gravy was as flavorful but now I know what to add to make it 4 forks in my house!!

I am a real dumpling fan. I am also a corn meal fan and usually like anything using it. But not this time. Contrary to other reviews, I really disliked the dumplings in this dish. I was also very labor intensive. I was most disappointed.

This was delicious, definitely comfort food at its best. It did take a lot of time to make, though. I was worried that the dumplings wouldn't turn out as the consistency of the batter was a lot thinner than I would have thought was right, but they actually turned out great.

This was very delicious. I love gravy so this was a perfect recipe for me. I doubled the dumpling recipe ( I also love dumplings) which was a bit too much for 4 people. I think 1 1/2 would be great depending on the size of appetites.

As with all Gourmet recipes, this was labor intensive. Unlike most Gourmet recipes, the return on investment was nil. The flavor was okay, but the dish wasn't pleasing to the eye, and the consistency was peculiar. It read beautifully, but ended up a disappointment.

This dish was REALLY good, but when I make it again, I'll do a few things differently. The sauce was pretty greasy, and I had a hard time skimming all of the fat off. I think next time I would use skinless chicken to save on a few calories. The dumplings were beyond compare - they reminded me of southern-style stuffing. I loved this one!

I was craving chicken and dumplings and this was SOOO good! I bought a cut up chicken and after it cooked I removed it from the bone and added it back into the broth. I also added sliced mushrooms, carrots and fresh corn before adding the dumplings. Fabulous!

This recipe is so delicious you wouldn't know how easy it was to make! There are so many different ways you can make this dish. You can add veggies before putting the dumplings on top; you can skip the dumplings and just make biscuits in the oven, and it would be great. What makes this recipe, in my opinion, is the gravy, which comes out so tasty. I also cut my chicken breasts (used four) into little squares, and made the gravy in the same pan without taking the chicken out. That worked just fine, and it took less steps. I had to add cornstarch though to thicken the sauce, but that seemed to not hurt the sauce at all. I will make this again and again. This is comfort food at its best!

This is exactly what you want from chicken and dumplings, plus so easy and delicious it will become a staple! I used boneless, skinless breasts (2lbs), cubed by the butcher to about an inch. The shallots and wine lend the gravy such richness, it is wonderful with those fresh-herb dumplings. We are big eaters, but the two of us ate all the dumplings on the first round, with chicken to spare.

I'm a new cook so I looked for a receipe that was simple and good...and this is it. I'm going to make this again and again. The only thing I would do different is use sweet corn meal and make smaller dumplings... this is a wonderful receipe-everyone loved it.

Let's just say we WERE going to have leftovers. This dish was definitely a "make this again" meal. I added some fresh mushrooms at the same time the chicken was cooking,and I used skinless chicken thighs.

I simplified this recipe, all for the better. I cut boneless chicken breast into cubes and proceeded per recipe, but instead of removing the chicken, I sprinkled it with the flour and made the gravy. I stirred in fresh baby spinach leaves, then added the dumpling batter. Excellent.

Yummy!I had never made a dumpling recipe from scratch before, I will never make them from a box mix again! I will cube the chicken to make more of a caserole next time.
