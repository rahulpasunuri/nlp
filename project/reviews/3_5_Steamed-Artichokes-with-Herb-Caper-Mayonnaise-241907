The true test is when one's husband keeps proclaiming throughout dinner how much he loves it! I made 2 small additions to the recipe: (1)add one large finely minced garlic clove and 1 Tbl. fresh lemon juice the the mayonnaise. It went from Wow to Zing.

very good! i divided the batch and only put capers in one portion. both equally tasty. (the only fresh herbs i had were basil, oregano, and parsley.)

The herb-caper mayonnaise is to die for! I'm sure there are lots of recipes for herb mayos, but I'd never tried it with artichokes. But I've made it twice and find it a great alternative to basic melted butter, and summer just isn't a time for a baked stuffed artichoke. I am lovin' it and used the leftover with some raw cauliflower. Super easy, especially if you have the herbs growing in the garden. Didn't change one thing. Make sure you go heavy on the chives and dill.
