Very good and earthy. I halved the recipe and used 1 Rapunzel veggie boullion cube and 1/2tsp salt with 4 cups water in lieu of the chicken stock.Topped it with a dollop of lemony sour cream made with 1/4 cup low fat sour cream and 1/2 tsp grated lemon peel. I also left out the celery leaves as a topping as it seemed unnecessary. Great for a winter dinner with a protein rich salad.

Good recipe. Made a nice fall accompaniment for Thanksgiving. However, several reviewers appear to be put off by using heavy cream. I substituted 2% evaporated milk and you could even use evaporated skim milk, which really cuts down on the fat. I regularly substitute evaporated milk for heavy cream in most recipes with good results. In a pinch, I have even used plain yogurt thinned with a bit of milk.

I am not quite sure why people seemed to like this. I thought it lacked flavor to be honest. I made it as noted except without the cream and I wasn't impressed. It needed some spices - maybe less potatoes...I could not really taste the leeks and onions.

i thought this was good, but not as stellar as the other reviews implied. It is a nice soup but neither the celery nor the leek flavor really "pop"

Very tasty, flavorful potato leek soup. Would make again if looking for this style. Didn't use cream.

Very pleasant and mild soup. Made this for the hubby when he wasn't feeling so well. I must say that remember to remove the bay leaf before blending the soup. I left it in by mistake and I had the leaf specks all over the soup - it kind of annoyed me. Otherwise very nice and I would definately make it again!

Browned up some chunks of bacon and sauteed the veg in that. Bacon truly does make everything better. Used fresh leeks and celery root from the farmer's market. Truly amazing and comforting.

This is a fixture in my repertoire. I usually don't add any cream. It tastes creamy enough just from the blending.

Just made this without the cream and it was great. I also made a smaller 'sweet' carrot version of this soup and placed two tablespoons in the center of each bowl of the potato soup, the color and flavor contrast of the soups really worked well.

This soup is just wonderful. It has drawn rave reviews whenever I have served it. I have several comments. (1) Celery root is expensive ($4.98/pound in St. Louis this summer) but this soup is worth it. (2) The whipping cream--or any milk/cream--is unnecessary. I have been taking meals to a neighbor who is dealing with some family stress. She is lactose-intolerant so I left out the cream. It was still a terrific soup. (3) The last time I made it I had a "senior moment" and brought back rosemary from my patio herb garden instead of thyme. Just as I threw the leaves into the pot, I realized my mistake. It was still wonderful. (4) Knowing how much of the skin to remove from celery root takes some experience. I've found that most of the remaining skin softens with cooking, so I don't have to be obsessive about removing all of it.

I made this exactly as written and loved it--as did my guests. A perfect winter soup. As to the reviewer who didn't understand why this was listed as lowfat with "all the butter olive and cream"--if you do the math, it is a very lowfat recipe. The yield is 8 generous servings, which means less than 1 teaspoon butter, less than 1/2 teaspoon olive oil and less than 1 tablespoon cream per serving--and chock full of wonderfully nutritious and delicious vegetables. Lowfat and nutritious do not have to mean nonfat, especially if you want your food to have flavor.

i think this was too much celery flavor. i ended up pureeing more sauted onions and mushrooms the next day, adding them along with broth from polish sausage and ham and a couple more potatoes to get more flavor in this soup.

The celery root adds a delicious background flavor to this smooth soup. I added some salt, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

This is a pretty good, fairly basic recipe. I made it because I was looking for a way to use celeriac root. The taste was wonderfully creamy considering there isnt much cream in the recipe. I think it will be better the second day, as is the case with most soups.

Followed recipe exactly. Lovely flavor, not too rich, but still satisfyingly creamy. My kids loved it too.

I chose this recipe to useup some celery I had in the fridge and because I like cream of potato leek soup. This was the best I have had thus far. It is super creamy, very subtle in flavor, a delicate soup I enjoyed very much. I probably added more cream than called for just because I was liking the texture so much. My guest enjoyed it as well. I served it along with Risotto with Peas and Green onions and the Rustic Apple Galette for a lovely meal.

Very good recipe. I also added 1 cup cheddar cheese and about 12 bacon slices. I used Hormel precooked bacon which really bumped up the fork rating. The soup was even better the next day. This would be a great make a head recipe when entertaining for a weekend.

I found this recipe listed in the Low Fat catagory. With the butter, olive oil, and the whipping cream, I must have missed something.

I've made this soup several times, substituting vegetable broth each time. Since I always feel bad about tossing the leafy tops in the trash, this last time I just added them to the soup when I added the stalks. They added great peppery flavor, but diminished the elegance of the original dish. I recommend adding the leaves as long as you are not preparing this dish for a special occasion.

Celery root wasn't available, so I used 3X the celery called for...it still came out fabulous and has gotten rave reviews from all.

This soup is fabulous and very elegant. I used the heavy cream but I think you could substitute milk to lighten it up. And it's easy to make. We had it on New Year's Eve and everyone loved it.

Sublime soup. I served this New Year's Eve and my dinner guest loved it. There is no denying the rich texture and subtle blending of flavors in this dish- not to mention the color, which looks great in candlelight! A note about the thyme and bay leaf: "two large sprigs" of thyme means that you will also have tough stems to contend with when blending- I recommend using only the tender leaves. The bay leaf should be removed just prior to blending. For this refined soup, I opted for a snippet of chives as garnish rather than the celery leaves. Happy New Year!!

I made this recipe as the starter dish for our thanksgiving dinner. I started the soup two days ahead because of travel plans, and although I was a bit worried that the soup would go bad (because of the cream), it turned out to be extremely flavorful and a hit at the party. The recipe takes a lot of cutting and patience (especially with cleaning and cutting the celery root); I also suggest using regular chicken broth. And once all the ingredients were in and boiling, the rest of the recipe was simple and fast. C'est delicieux!

A very nice soup - creamy and flavourful. However, instead of low-salt chicken broth, use regular. Otherwise, you will be adding salt to it like everybody else.

I added some spinich and crimini mushrooms before pureeing it. Delicious. Needed more salt. The celery in the recipe is just right.

Very nice. It's been rainy and cold here, so I wanted something for soup weather. This would make a good starter first course at my next dinner party. Different and unusual. I agree with the previous reviewer -- it does need to some salt. I salted to taste.

This was delicious. I thought perhaps there was too much celery called for, but it's just right! I used half and half istead of heavy cream. A wonderful winter supper.

This is a delicious treat for celery lovers and is very easy to make. I assumed the recipe contains an error, and the five stalks of celery it calls for are really five ribs. I used one-percent milk rather than cream to thin it out at the end, which worked out fine. It's a good idea to remove the bay leaf and thyme branches before pureeing. These were hard to find, so next time I'll make a bouquet garni out of cheesecloth. Also, it needs salt (about 1 tsp) earlier in the cooking process; adding it at the end just doesn't give the same good result, in my opinion.

Although this soup involved lots of chopping and dicing, the result was well worth it. The consistency was rich and full, and the celery root, thyme and bay leaf added just enough flavor. Even my kids loved it. I'll definitely make this again.
