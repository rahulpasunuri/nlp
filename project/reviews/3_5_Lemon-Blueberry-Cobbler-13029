A delicious and very easy way to use summer berries. The cardamom and lemon juice/zest are wonderful. I'll make this cobbler again and again for family and friends. Following advice in this forum, I added an extra cup of berries--blackberries--to the 2 cups blueberries, and it was outstanding. I also followed the suggestion to use a bit of extra cream in the dough. Next time I will use a slightly smaller dish than the one recommended to ensure more complete dough coverage of the berries underneath.

Good taste, the lemon is a nice fresh touch. As others stated it was runny, not sure if it's supposed to be? The topping could use more liquid, but I liked the cardamon.

I took advice from earlier reviewers. I used a little more cornstarch and it was still soupy. I did use 4 cups blue berries and 1.5 times of everything - but 2 t cornstarch. I had a 9 inch pie pan. Also, I used orange rind and lime rind as I didn't have lemon, very tasty.

After I made this dessert one weekend, I made a double recipe for guests the following weekend. Everyone loved it, and I find it much better and far easier to make than any blueberry pie recipe. Lemon and blueberry is always a good combo, and the cardamom in the biscuits is an interesting touch. I offered folks the leftover cream to pour on their helpings, and no one declined. Highly recommended.

Serves 2??? That's pretty hefty recipe for only 2 people!! Think I'll stick with Bill's Blueberry Cobbler or, better yet, BLUEBERRY UPSIDEDOWN CAKE from Martha Stewart's Living Magazine...Now THAT'S a recipe!!!

A very dull cobbler.

I doubled the recipe and used an oblong Pyrex dish. These changes worked fine. I substituted cinnamon for the cardamon, and that was good, too. This recipe is really quick, under 30 minutes,and very good, so it is great for drop-in company.

I used blackberries (about 3 cups) since the store was all out of blueberries and it was wonderful. Next time I would probably add only 1/2 t. of cardamom, but will definitely make again. Would probably be good with almost any fruit and makes a great light summer desert.

Very easy cobbler, and good looking dessert, especially served with vanilla ice cream and a strawberry garnish. Also good to add extra cream to make the biscuits a little more flaky.

This is an excellent cobbler, and very simple to prepare. The lemon adds a dimension which we have not found in other berry recipes. We agree with the cook from San Diego, and added an extra cup of berries. The next time we are going to mix blue berries and blackberries and see what happens.

This was a no-brainer and really delicious! Easy and impressive to serve.....everyone wanted more. A little ice cream won't hurt, either.

Great taste, very easy. I like to add a peach for taste and color contrast.

Simple and delightful. A terrific, easy cobbler for a last minute summer dessert. Next time I will use at least one more cup of blueberries.

Easy to make - the hint of cardamom and the lemon zest were nice touches. Served with vanilla ice cream to guests who all wanted more.
