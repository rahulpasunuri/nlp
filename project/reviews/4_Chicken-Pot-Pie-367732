Definitely a fantastic pot pie recipe. For those who enjoy cooking and have the time, it's worth the extra steps. As others recommend, parboil the potatoes. This recipe made 2 large pies (8" pie dish)and 4 small ramekins. I froze the extra ones without cooking the crust. Just put it in the oven straight from the freezer and cook at 375 for about 1 to 1 1/2 hours, you may need to cover the crust toward the end so it doesn't burn. It's as delicious as the day it was made with no clean up!

Hearty and delicious--the crust was especially good-- beautifully flakey and golden. That said, this dish was a lot of work--I split it into two days as suggested by others, making the entire filling one day and the crust the next. I made a half batch of the filling and a full batch of crust for six mini pot pies baked in ramekins. There was enough crust to make bottom crusts for four of the six, though the resulting crust/filling ratio was maybe a bit high. I also substituted dried porcini for the chanterelles, (accidentally) omitted the celery, and parboiled the potatoes as suggested by others.

Everyone agreed it was the best pot pie they've ever had! I would definitely recommend making all of the "do ahead" parts the day before because it's pretty labor intensive. Well worth the effort though!

I have made this recipe several times now and every time everyone has loved it! I added celery instead of green beans because I didn't have any and used the last of a turkey roast I had cooked earlier in the week. What a truly delicious cold weather dish!

This is what I made out of our leftover Thanksgiving turkey. Even though the turkey/chicken step was done, this recipe took longer to make than expected and made a larger mess, too. Still, it was delicious and worth the effort. It was totally yummy. I especially like this crust! The potpie filling was the perfect balance of thick and runny, but I didn't use even close to all the roux.

This recipe yields an exceptionally delicious chicken pot pie. As other reviewers have stated however, it is extremely time consuming. There are a few short cuts I used last night that did not make it any less delicious in my opinion, and easily shaved a few hours off. (The complete time, including baking, was 3 hours :). 1.) Use 1 lb. chicken tenderloins instead of a whole chicken (this will allow you to cook the chicken fully in the 10 minute simmer period, eliminating the 35 minute poaching period entirely 2.) Skip the chanterelle mushroom step entirely. Substitute the 1 cup mushroom broth with 1 cup water or 1 cup chicken stock. 3.) Use a ready-made crust. 4.) Instead of fresh pearl onions, use frozen. These may sound like drastic measures but I promise it won't be any less delicious in the end. ;)

This is an amazing recipe with tuns of flavor. A lot of work it is true but it worked well in two days. I roasted the chicken and got the veggies ready the evening before. Did the rue and threw everything together the next day. I used puff pastry for the top. I took this dish to a family that was in the middle of a move. Served it with biscuits and a salad

I made a simplified version of this - forgive me. Am only posting this to tell you you can retain some of the amazing flavor without spending the hours. 1. Crust: used puff pastry shells (the ones with a lid). Very well suited for this kind of recipe. 2. Chicken: Just poached chicken thighs in chicken broth, adding some white wine and thyme. Added tomato paste at the end. Didn't do all the straining. Used less chicken. 3. Filling: I followed the recipe except: used plain onion, sauteed that with the carrots, then stirred in peas and removed from heat. Used corn instead of potatoes, skipped mushrooms, skipped thyme because had added it at the top. Again, no straining. Seasoned before and after adding vegetables and chicken. Simmered only 10 minutes or so instead of baking for 40. I ended up adding the filling to the pastry shells. The special flavor comes from the acidity added by the wine and the tomato, and the umami added by the tomato paste and the chanterelles. It gives it enough of a kick to turn it from bland to addictive.

Spent the day making this dish, I started at 1 and we ate dinner at 8. Hubby and kids loved it, I thought it was OK. I do think part of it was due to the fact that I had spent my entire day on it. Would I make this again ? Given the effort involved for the end result, no.

I agree well worth the effort. I took two days just because of my own time issues, but can't imagine doing it all in one. I added parsnips just because I had them and also precooked the potatos as someone ele mentioned. It was fabulous and I will make it again.

I disagree the recipe has to take a full day or more. From the trip to the grocery store to the time the pie was ready to pop into the oven, it took me 5 hours. I don't waste time letting the ingredients cool, and I parboiled the vegetables in the broth (in a strainer.) And don't let anyone tell you there is something wrong with using frozen pearl onions. These steps cut a lot of time and effort out of the process. I used white whole wheat flour instead of plain white in the roux but let the sauce simmer uncovered for an hour before straining it over the chicken and vegetables. The dish got rave reviews.

This is definitely a two day process, I agree. My short cuts included home-made chicken stock I had in the freezer and I roasted the chicken the night before, as well as making the pie crust dough. Saved a lot of time. As it was it was 4-5 hours start to finish, including clean-up. The result, however, was amazing. That's my once in a life-time trial however. Been there, done it !!

This recipe was certainly delicious, but incredibly time consuming. I would not have minded spending the time if the recipe would have called for parboiling the potatoes. I agree with the reviewer that suggests this step. The flavor of the pot pie was amazing, but I had a hard time getting past the half cooked potatoes.

Fantastic recipe! Made it for our Christmas dinner this year. Everyone loved it and went back for seconds. Flavours were great and the sauce had a nice consistency. Definitely worth the time. The only warning I would give is to be careful with the potatoes. The recipe does not specify to parboil them. Next time I make it I will definitely do so as they came out a little bit crunchy in the middle (especially the larger pieces).

Phenomenally delicious! Took a good amount of time, but wasn't hard.

The best I have tasted!!! Would suggest using the 2 day approach.

To preface this, I am not typically a review-writer. However, I think anyone attempting this recipe should know three things: 1. It's delicious and the flavours are nuanced and amazing and perfect. 2. It took 24 hours to make. Literally 24 hours. 3. You should always read a recipe from beginning to end before starting.

WOW! This was the first CPP I have ever made and it turned out great! My boyfriend was very impressed with the crust. You can certainly make this much more simply by using store bought chicken stock and a precooked bird, but then that defeats the purpose of making it from "scratch", which is what this recipe is. If you don't have all afternoon to make every part from scratch then avoid this recipe, but the flavors and satisfaction I got from this recipe were great and worth the effort. It is enough to feed 6 adults, easily.

What a boring train-wreck of a rehash of a 50's recipe. Get a grip! I find myself sleep walking and looking for Kraft miniature marshmallows and lime Jell-O in the cupboard of my youth. Make the stock SEPERATLY from the chicken in the pie. The idea of boiling the essence from meat is so 18th. Century British, I feel in a time warp. Brine the bird and smoke it! Use duck fat in the roux and consider some sharp Cheddar in the crust.

Although this recipe is very time consuming it came out fantastic! We slow cooked the chicken in a crock pot and seasoned it properly with a nice combination of flavours. Rave reviews from everyone. Would definitely make again.

This is similar to the Jacques Pepin recipe and procedure. His version does not take all day.... is explicit. You cook all of the vegetables in the same broth.... you remove as cooked, and then add the next one. As in this recipe. Important to put the cooked veggies into cold water to stop the cooking. Personally,I would just use Jacques.

Beware! I've spent most of the day making the recipe and discovered that there is an error as it is written. After you have cooked the roux and poured the broth into it to make the sauce, the broth is then unavailable to simmer the veggies and chicken. Cook the veggies and chicken in the broth first, then strain it again to make the sauce. In short, switch the 2nd and 3rd paragraphs under the "filling" section and you'll probably be fine.

This was worth every minute I spent in the kitchen yesterday. Everyone in my house raved. I will definitely make this again. Notes: 1) I accidentally used only 1 stick of butter instead of 2 in the crust - I loved the biscuit-y texture, and it really stood up to the liquid filling. Next time, I will purposefully only use 1 stick. 2) I also cooked the roux for about 15 minutes instead of 10 - I love a dark roux and I find that the darker it gets, the richer the flavor.

Made this on a Sunday and loved it. Because it's a bit too fussy, I changed a few things. I used rotisserie chicken (amish with no additives), shitake mushrooms (no soaking), pre-prepared chicken broth (no straining)and saved quite a bit of work.

Yes, this is no weeknight dinner - but I think I figured that out when I read the recipe! This is as from scratch as you can get and made for a really nice Sunday dinner with the family. I would definitely make this again!

I agree it took way too long, or longer than I had expected to prepare. However, I though the flavor was excellent. I also made my crust gluten free so I did need to change that portion of the recipe. I will be making this again and will not poach the chicken, it took longer to cook the chicken. I also used truffle seasalt inside and on top of the crust...these were the only changes and everyone loved it.

I really wanted to love this recipe - it looked so good! But this recipe should come with a warning that preparing it will take ALL day. I miss how Gourmet used to tell us the length of time a recipe would take, but I digress. I have made many pot pies from scratch in my life, and this was by far the most unnecessarily complicated. So much boiling and straining! The flavor was fine with some tweaking, but you really can achieve fine flavor by tossing everything in the pot and letting it cook down. Much less work!
