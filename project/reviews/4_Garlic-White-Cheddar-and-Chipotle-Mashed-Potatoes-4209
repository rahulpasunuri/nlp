I have made these 2 times in the past 10 days - they are wonderful!! First time - made exactly as written as they were delicious. Second time - I used asiago cheese, a little garlic powder and milk, butter and chipotle - but no cream cheese and they were just as good. You've got to try these!

These were good, but (for me) just weren't worth the effort. I have another wonderful mashed potato/chipotle/cheese recipe that is much easier and, I think, tastier.

To avoid the Play-Dough texture, try using a potato ricer. It's a bit time consuming, but worth it for the resulting fluffiness !!

Made this entire menu in an attempt to recreate a world-class meal at Inn of the Anasazi in Santa Fe. Steak and salsa were superb, but these potatoes had the consistency of Play-Doh and the flavor wasn't as cheesy as I would have liked. Still, I got enough compliments that I'd be willing to make them again in hopes of getting a fluffier version. And they did make great potato pancakes the next day.

Big hit at dinner party this weekend. Served w/ribs. I messed up on the roasted garlic, undercooked, and it was time to eat, so I had to omit and the potatoes still received rave reviews from my guests.

used almost double the chipotles, and an even 40 cloves of garlic. despite all that, I wasn't too impressed . . . until I remembered to add a little salt. I'm usually very stingy with salt and I didn't think this dish would need any, what with all the cheese, but that last little sprinkle really made all the difference. wonderfully tasty stuff. husband loves it!

These are just delicious...my brother in law asks for these at every family event. Put all the garlic in! it mellows out in the oven, and the potatoes definitely need all 36 cloves, if not more!

What's not to like? A delicious, easy to make side with roast pork and mole sauce. I have a rule about making a recipe only once every six months, so I can't wait until Spring.

Yes, these mashed potatoes completely rocked.

These are incredible mashed potatoes. I added some heavy creme to the recipe and I served them with additional grated cheese sprinkled on top. Delicious. The chipolte flavor is subtley in the backround, if you like things hot add more peppers. Definitely a WINNER!!!!

Delicious! My husband, who hates potatoes said he would eat potatoes every night if they tasted like this!

Our favorite potato recipe, always a hit with company. When we dine alone, I add more chipotles AND some ground chipotle powder, we love the heat!

Well, heart smart it's not, but, boy, were these potatoes good! Definitely worth repeating. My son says these were beyond belief.

Great recipe, made them for new years with maple soy glazed salmon. Great combo. I used 1/2 Russet 1/2 yukon gold(what i had at the house) very flavorful and rich. recipe makes a lot. have had numeous requests for a repeat. roasted garlic is an entirely different animal than raw garlic. do not be afraid!

Made these for Christmas dinner and they were a huge hit! The flavors came together wonderfully and I was surprised at how easy the dish was to make. Using all of the garlic is very important. Definitely a keeper.

Good potatoes. I went a little easy on the garlic, as the amount made me nervous. if I make again, will put all of the garlic in. I knew nothing of roasting garlic, but I discovered that you need to leave as much of the outside peel on the clvoes as possible when you roast. The onces where the peel came off a little were more likely to burn.

These potatoes are delicious with the beef short ribs with chipotle and green chiles! I forgot to add the butter, but there is so much flavor it didn't matter!

AWESOME. We added double the chipotles (we like it spicy). These go great with the steak and mango salsa. Got RAVE REVIEWS about how well the flavors mix. A keeper for sure!

These are the best mashed potatoes I've ever had! Wonderful combination of flavors. I used less cheese & added a bit of whipping cream and it was delicious

How fun to have mashed potatoes with lots of flavor (that don't require gravy to taste better)! I agree - one little chipotle can pack a lot of heat. A big hit with everyone here in So. Cal, and great because they can be made in advance. An added bonus - the leftovers make terrific potato pancakes!!!

Oh man, these taters are the greatest. Halved the recipe, using less garlic than half. We all loved these. They disappeared in about 5 minutes. This whole menu--the steaks, the salsa, and these potatoes--is well worth the expense.

Rating: 3
Very, very good! One piece of advice - the garlic is easy to overcook - it burns more quickly than it would if you roasted an intact head of garlic with just the top trimmed. That may seem obvious, but I ended up with dark, brittle garlic, which I had to crumble into the potatoes. Maybe that gave it a more nutty flavour. Even so, the potatoes were very tasty! Very good balance of flavours - definately not bland! I highly recommend serving it with the beef tenderloin steaks and mango salsa! Wonderful!!!

Very good and very easy. I skipped the chipotle chilies because of a menu taste conflict. Due to lack of time, I substituted processed garlic that I sauteed in the olive oil. Rave reviews from all guests!

I made these for a family gathering and they were a hit. The only substitution I made was red potatoes(w/skins) instead of russets, because I had a lot of reds on hand.

I was disappointed with this recipe. For the variety of great flavors in the ingredient list,(and I followed the recipe exactly) I was surprised at the overall lack of punch! Fortunately, I prepared the entire suggested menu of tenderloins with salsa; these won such raves, we could easily forgive the potato dish. Much better mashed potatoes out there, per our humble vote...

Fantastic -- hotter than I thought they'd be but just the best. Definately make again.

Ok....yes I would make this dish again....no, I wouldn't put the all that cheese in it. Way to much fat for the resulting taste. The peppers and garlic were great. Adding whole milk or half and half will be how I do it next time.

As I did not have such an extensive supply of garlic gloves or white cheddar and did not need to cook for eight, I cut this recipe in 1/2, used only 6 cloves of garlic and mixed sharp yellow cheddar w/plain "white pizza cheese". (The cheese mixture does not satisfy the gourmet element, but does surprising justice to the dish!) I also used fat free cream cheese, low sodium butter and red potatoes. Even with my low-brow substitutions, the dish was delicious.

Delicious, even with all my changes. I microwaved the garlic cloves in less oil, used nonfat yogurt cheese, and halved the butter. It was still wonderful. And versatile -- we used the leftovers to make aloo parathas, a potato-stuffed Indian flatbread, which also came out great.

This recipe is absolutely delicious, the flavors blend together wonderfully. I had to whip this up quickly for a dinner guest so I used a pkg. of instant potatoes and to my surprise they didn't know the difference.

After a trip to SantaFe I wanted to make a dinner for friends with a New Mexico theme. These potatoes were spectacular with 5-chile rubbed grilled chicken breasts. The potatoes are smokey, creamy, and just plain good.

As mashed potatoes go this is such a yummy recipe. If you have guests that like spice or garlic they will love this. I have had many who have asked for the recipe. You can make it an hour or two before and warm it up just before serving. This will stay in my recipe box.

I've been fantasizing about making this for some time, and when I finally did, it surpassed my expectations. It may be the final word on mashed potatoes.

I didn't have the time to roast the garlic so I sauteed it in a chunk of butter, I substituted sweet potatoes and added leftover havarti dill and cream cheese -- basically what I had in the fridge. It was fantastic! I made sure the chipotle in adobe was added for flavor and not for scorching heat so my 2 1/2 year old son could eat it too. MMmmmmm, my husband the picky chef loved it.

I have made baked stufffed potatoes using this recipe for the filling. They are a crowd pleaser. Perfect with roast beef or steaks.

Great recipe. First time I made it I could not find Chipolte peppers, so substituted a teaspoon of canned sliced green chilies. Second time I made it I was able to find the Chipolte- and I have to say, I think it was better with the green chiles. Make it as a side for the port wine tenderloin- worked out really well.

Execellent dish! Everyone loved it. I added a couple more teaspoons of the peppers. Remember to get all the seeds out!

Excellent, but don't overcook the garlic (30 mins covered is enough). You might just take 3 large heads of garlic and cut off the tops and drizzel with oil oil, cover and cook 30 mins. Then just squeeze then out when cool. Much easier. Served it with a rare seared ahi -- nice contrast of flavors and of course, everyone wanted the recipe!

This was fabulous with grilled salmon with a soy-mustard glaze. It got raves from our guests and I'll definitely make it again! Don't skimp on the garlic!

I've made this twice now, the second time doubling the amount of cream cheese. Everyone who tries it asks me for the recipe.
