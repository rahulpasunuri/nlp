With a little tweaking, this recipe is wonderful and tastes authentic. First, to address the lake of flavor that other reviewers commented on, you need to be very heavy on the curry paste and chili garlic sauce. I used both, and probably doubled the curry paste. I also added about a tablespoon of curry powder and threw in some red pepper flakes. Second, since we are vegetable lovers, I put in way more vegetables than called for, including broccoli and some carrot sliced on the bias. Anything you have in the house works. The eggplant is a must, though, but regular eggplant works just fine. I stir fried the vegetables first then removed them while I cooked the chicken so the vegetables remained firm. We also prefer rice to noodles. Enjoy

this dish was ok, i like all the elements included, but NO flavor. I agree with others who are saying that it is bland. i thought i would try it again to deviate from the recipe with additional spices, etc...but from the other reviews it doesnt sound like it will help. maybe use a Tblspn of sweetened coconut milk also? dont know, will keep looking for other versions:)

This is a standard in our house. It is a great way to use vegetables and all my non-vegetable eating kids like it. I feel free to substitute whatever I have on hand for the eggplant (often zucchini), and we all love it. So quick too!

Me and my boyfriend made this and it's soo tasty I added more of the thai paste about 1 tbs., some garlic and a bit more coconut milk and basil I like to have some extra sauce for the steamed rice. It's fast, easy and delicious!! We make this about 3 times a month.

Not sure why this one gets such bad reviews. I made it along with the Butternut Squash and Noodles with Coconut, Lime and Cilantro Sauce also from this site and we liked it. It could be because the squash recipe carried more heat from the addition of jalapeno's. Anyway, One can of ococonut milk is enough for both and the flavors go well togather. I mixed the two together for great lunch leftovers.

This dish doesn't even deserve one fork! Unbelievably bland. And, I actually added seasoning after reading the reviews thinking it would help, but it didn't. Look elsewhere for good Thai recipes.

I, too, found this recipe to be bland. I added fish sauce and red chili sauce to my Thai red curry paste, and still, my husband had to add tobasco sauce. So, while I found if flavorful enough with added salt, it was too bland ultimately.

I've made this a few times, I notice it helps to use more spice/marinade and less coconut milk-- I use half a cup and reserve the rest for mild coconut rice. The basil is nice but cilantro is fine, as somebody pointed out.

If you like mildly flavored Thai food then this is for you. However, if you are like me and love spicy food, then I would pass. This dish did not pack much of a punch; It needed a lot more flavor. If I do make this again, I would probably add some lemongrass, thai fish sauce, and more chilies.

Excellent dish. One thing that made a difference was the Chill/Garlic sauce. I used something from the local Asian market and not one of the Americanized versions of Asian sauces that you buy at the normal supermarket. Went well over Japanese Rice ;->

I agree that this dish is a little bland considering the use of red curry paste. I would possibly make the dish again with the addition of more curry added to the coconut milk and some other spices. I would also blanch the green beans first since they take longer to cook (my eggplant was mush before the green beans were done) and I would use cilantro instead of the basil.

Aside from the spiciness of the red curry, this dish had no flavor. I usually love everything Thai, but this recipe really stinks.

A wonderful basic recipe that you can add to. I sauteed some red onions with garlic and ginger and then added some carrot slices before cooking the eggplant and green beans. The coconut milk was a bit intense so I only used half a cup and had to triple the amount of chili sauce as indicated to add some more spice. Some chopped green onions sprinkled at the end provided some nice color and flavor to the dish. Quick and scrumptious!

Yuck.

This was really good. It was flavorful and spicy and very easy and quick to put together. And I just love the eggplant in this. I've only ever had eggplant in Itallian dishes, so this was a nice new way to use it.

I found this recipe to be fairly bland and uninteresting.

Good recipe. However, I used mushrooms, red and yellow peppers instead of eggplant. I also, used only 1 tablespoon of paste. I would make this again. My son even liked it.

This was spicy and very flavorful! My husband and I enjoyed it with a cold beer. I substituted carrots and mushrooms for the eggplant and used light coconut milk to cut down on the fat. If you don't want it pretty spicy, cut down on the recommended chili dosage.
