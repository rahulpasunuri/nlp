Delicious salad! I added grilled chopped shrimp and used Cindy's Kitchen Greek Dressing with Feta and Black Olives to make it into a meal. Amazing!!

Yum. Made this exactly as written except, instead of oil and vinegar for dressing, used a simple dijon vinagrette recipe as follows: mince one clove of garlic with kosher salt. Add 4 T olive oil, 1 T red wine vinegar, 1 t. dijon, salt and pepper to taste. Got tons of compliments and all of the veggie colors made for a pretty presentation.

We loved this salad. The pita croutons were fabulous. Definitely add more feta. And use the best dressing recipe on this website -- balsamic dressing from March 1999.

Excellent chopped salad. Great flavor and the pita croutons are worth the (little) effort.

All my favorite ingredients in one recipe - this was so very very good! I am a tuna fan, so I added a can of good quality italian tuna in oil (and skipped the olive oil called for)- also doubled the amount of Feta cheese. Any leftovers are great in a whole grain bun-wich the next day.

The olive oil gives the croutes a nice crispness and sheen. I substituted a tomato for the red pepper for flavor, and the color balance was maintained. I used a whole yellow pepper, doubled the amount of feta. It makes a nice, very good for you, salad for 4. If it is for two people, it is their entire dinner.

What an easy salad with lots of crunch and flavor. I baked the pita croutons for a lower fat version.
