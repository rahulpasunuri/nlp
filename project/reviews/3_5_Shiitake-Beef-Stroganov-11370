I use filet tails, sear brown quickly and pull while still pink in the middle. Can't imagine this dish with any other cut of beef. Love the layers of flavor. Couldn't find a turnip, served it on potato puree, still good. I use gluten free pantry flour, good texture and thickening. This time was for our anniversary. You can prep the ingredients for an easy final cooking after the appetizer.

This is a good recipe but not great. There was something off about the flavor and I'm not sure what. I was very careful not to overcook the tenderloin and it came out 'melt in your mouth'. For something different we served it with the turnip potato puree which is good but quite stong of the turnip.

i used about half of the mushrooms and stew beef instead of mignons and it was definitely a hit. it was better than i expected.

Used about 20 ounces of filet and the turnip potatoe puree. Best Stroganov I have ever tasted.

I made this last night for our first home-cooked meal a husband & wife. It was pretty good. Very rich & I thought there was not enough meat. I would up the filet amount & decrease the mushrooms & onions. It was tasty & satisfying overall though.

Dish was wonderful and easy to prepare. We just loved it. Great way to use the ends of a whole tenderloin.
