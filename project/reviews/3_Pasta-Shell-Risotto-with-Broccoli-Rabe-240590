I thought it very good and easy. I used broccoli, leeks instead of onion, and added some hot red pepper flakes. I did not add the cheese until at the table.

I really liked this, more than I thought I would. Simple to make. I halved everything (didn't use water, only broth) and it worked well for just 2 of us. I added zest of one lemon and juice of 1/2 lemon, and I tossed in some shredded roast chicken to make it a 1-dish meal. Also used about 1/2 the parm to keep calories down. I love that this is creamy while still being healthy. I would make again, but try different veggies next time.

I found it to be a good fiber & greens source but not too exciting - until I served it with the Shrimp Charmoula recipe on this site (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/241504) - the extra sauce/marinade from the shrimp was excellent with this dish! A nice surprise.

Not bad at all... a good, healthy 1-course meal. If you don't time the noodles properly and let the veggies wilt you will get a gooey mess, as the Empress apparently did. Also, do yourself a favor and use good Parmesan.

This recipe turned into a gooey, sticky mass. It didn't have much flavor, either.

This recipe was great! I've made pasta with broccoli rabe many many times and usually add crushed red pepper at the table.This method of cooking the pasta "risotto" syle made the pasta much more flavorful. In the end, just before serving, I stirred in red pepper crusted ricotta salata--it was scrumptious!

This was ok. I'll make it again, if only to have another way to eat broccoli rabe. But it was basically just pasta shells, I didn't catch the "risotto-style". Nothing too exciting, a good basic to have in your recipe box.
