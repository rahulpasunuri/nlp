This was a lot of work. I couldn't find affordable snapper to use with this recipe, so I used tilapia instead; maybe that has something to do wiith why the flavor was so bland. I was pretty excited to taste the end result, what with all the prep and interesting ingredients involved. Unfortunately, it was a disppointment. I'm glad I didn't spring for the $18/lb snapper.

I'm a big fan of coconut milk. The sause is refreshing and just delicious. I added a pinch of brown sugar to give it a twist. It turned out amazing! Very popular among friends and family. Lucrecia, Littleton, CO

I LOVE this recipe. I've made it many times I now have it memorized! It's definitely one of my go-to dishes! I love that sauce...it's so rich and delicious...and tastes like it's fattening but it's not! I've used it on all different kinds of fish and chicken too! I usually up the garlic and the ginger (jarred minced ginger is fine) and omit the cilantro (yuck...) and serve it with quinoa to make it even more healthy.

I made this as directed. It was just ok. I think it would be improved by some thai chili paste and some shredded coconut added to the recipe.

Wow, what an utter let-down. Wish I would have listened to the cook in Boston. I agree, wasn't worth the time & effort. I think I was expecting a much different flavor which is why I was so disappointed. I love coconut, so by calling for the coconut milk I thought it would give the fish more of that type of flavor. Of course, I've never cooked with coconut milk so maybe that's not the case--obviously not with this recipe. I thought it strange that with all the ingredients it called for that the sauce was so bland. On a positive note it was edible, but I think I'll stick to another recipe I have for coconut crusted fish if I want that flavor enhanced. This recipe just didn't cut it for me at all.

I made this dish last night, but substitute it with salmon...and left out the bell peppers, and came out delicious. I removed the pan off the fire immediately after the simmering time, so the fish didn't become overcooked. It was nice and moist, and I would definitely cook it again.

Actually, I first read the name and ingredients of this recipe before I headed to buy all the stuff, without reading the full preparation instructions. When I came back home and started to cook, I finally took a look at the recipe itself and - to be honest - I thought it was a little "simple at heart". I really had something different in my mind when I initially saw the name and ingredients, also, I did not get Snapper, I went for Salmon steaks instead and so I decided to use the same stuff but cook it totally different. Here is my variation of "Coconut Spinace Salmon": Heat the canola oil over medium-high heat. Put the diced red onion, the garlic, the grated ginger in it and cook until tender. Add coconut milk, lime juice, cilantro and bring to bpil. Add soy and hot sauce AND SPINACHE, and simmer until everything is nice and done. Add some bell peppers, TURMERIC, sea salt to taste off. Meanwhile place the salmon steaks in a flat canister and poor some canola oil on the fish. The fish needs to be covered by the oil, but must not "swim" in it. Put some ground pepper and fleur de sel or sea salt on the fish. Heat a large frying or grilling pan with NO oil until hot. Place the oil covered salmon in the pan and fry until one side is nice and slightly crisp (if the salmon got a skin, use this side first and make it real nice crispy. You can enhance the crispyness by dusting some flour on the skinned side before frying.) Reduce heat and turn until done. In deep preheated plates, first place some of the coconut milk spinach and place one salmon steak with the crispy side up on top and serve while hot. Enjoy!

Loved this. I forgot the soy, and chose the cheap, frozen, white fish (cod-block) that we get around here. I also got the regular coconut milk and not the light version. The cilantro really gives the dish a kick, and I thought it was a great weeknight fish dish :)

I and my guests very much enjoyed the dish. It had many flavors while remaining low fat. I spiced it up a bit with a pinch of chile pepper.

I made this recipe for my husband and a couple friends and they all loved it! I thought it was just OK. I used tilapia instead of snapper and that worked well. It was nice to have a "lite" recipe that was flavorful.

I'm not an expert at this type of food, but this did not come out at all well for me. Very bland sauce which sort of ruined the yummy fish. Don't know what I'd add to fix up the sauce, but I think it's not worth the effort.
