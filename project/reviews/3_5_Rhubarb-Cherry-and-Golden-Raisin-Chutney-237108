This was too sweet and needed a bit more spice to round out the flavor. The lime juice was much needed to balance the sugar, I would cut back a lot and let them tartness of the rhubarb come through.

Delicious! I was very generous with the mustard and fennel seeds, which gives it a great flavor. It's good served with crackers and Brie, but better with Cougar Gold.

Be careful of the aniseed! Many do not like it! It does mellow the sedond day. I put this on a goat cheese crostini. It was beautiful and yummy.

This was absolutely excellent. We had it with sauteéd duck breasts (just salt, pepper and olive oil) and it really complemented them well. I'm sure it would also be great with lamb or a roast pork tenderloin, too.
