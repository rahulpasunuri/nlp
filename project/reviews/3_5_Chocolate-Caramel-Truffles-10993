I make this recipe for dinner parties when I want to offer just a bite of chocolate but dessert will actually be something else. It's always a huge hit. I think it's important to use a fork or whisk to stir the sugar so it's smooth with no crunchy bits. And it does take some time to smooth it out again after adding the cream. I also found that just rolling in cocoa doesn't work -- it masks the caramel too much. I either roll in ground nuts or a mixture of sugar and cocoa which cuts back on the cocoa finish.

This is a great little recipe! In full disclosure, my first attempt was a colossal failure - but it was my fault - I didn't read the cooking instructions carefully and I'm not much of a candy maker... Also, using the "fork" to stir the sugar didn't work for me - I used a DRY wooden flat spatula to melt the sugar - perfect! Also, be mindful of the simmer after adding the cream (my first attempt was a bit too hot and became a clumpy mess). Otherwise, they've turned out beautifully the next two times I've made them and I didn't increase the chocolate as others have described, you'd miss the caramel I think. I rolled half in lightly toasted (sea)salted pecans and the other half in Droste cocoa - most folks liked the pecans the best! Yum - in my keeper list for a quick easy dessert!

I am not a sweet or a chocolate fan. I looked up this recipe for my son's grade 3 valentine's party, as there is a student who had a gluten-free diet in the class. What a success!! I made these over a two-day period and they turned out so lovely. I left the truffle mixture in the refrigerator overnight and it was too hard to work with the next morning. I nuked it for 15 seconds and that did the trick. I rolled mine in cocoa and sea salt.

This is my GO TO recipe for truffles. They are simply divine. The slight crunch from the caramel in the finished product is wonderful - I have made these as gifts many times.

I disagree with the cook who claimed there wasn't enough caramel flavor...I was impatient and didn't even let my very-amber caramel remelt into the cream/chocolate mixture, and started pulling out big pieces and eating them, afraid they wouldn't mix back in with the candies! Even after eating half(!) the caramel in this way, the taste came bursting through the chocolate. I think it completely has to do with just how close you get to the scorching point on your sugar, and I love pushing the envelope. I think I will use a scoop to form these next time instead of a spoon; it became a very messy procedure as I had to shape the chocolate a lot with my hands. I did the half cocoa/half pecan method. The pecans I used I keep in the freezer, so they really retained their moisture and the coating very thick when you rolled the truffle in it. I think these should be taken out of the fridge just a bit before serving; when they're eaten too cold, you do lose some of the flavors, as I discovered when I got greedy (again).

Oops. I didn't realize their were two chocolate-caramel truffle recipes, and I rated this one, when I really meant to rate the Caramel-Dark Chocolate Truffles with Fleur De Sel. I did not make these.

These were a religious experience! Absolutely fantastic! I went with what the other reviewers said about letting the caramel get nice and dark before adding the cream. I also added a tablespoon of butter after the addition of the cream. I wonder if adding a splash of vanilla to the caramel mixture might bump-up the flavor too? I experimented with rolling some in raw cane sugar, and some in cocoa before coating, and the cane sugar ones do have an interesting texture and sweetness to them. Both are good. Don't try to cut costs on the chocolate here. buy the best you can afford. Oh I just can't wait to see the looks on people's faces when the pop one of these this holiday season. Thanks SO MUCH!

These were very, very sweet even with the bittersweet chocolate I used. The caramel gave the truffles a nice consistency, but it was overkill. I'll stick with the ganache type method. Its a much better showcase for high quality chocolate. Don't be a cheap bastard, spring for the good stuff and you will be showered with praise from all!

I've made this a number of times (always with 12oz of chocolate) and they're wonderful. Recently I found myself with a lot of white chocolate I'd bought by mistake. I decided to try these with white chocolate (I omitted the vanilla) and they were terrific, althought a bit soft. To cut the sweetness I rolled them in Droste cocoa. They were devoured. I think next time, I may try dropping the soft rolled truffles into dark chocolate cordial cups.... should be a good way for them to keep their shape!

Tasty little morsels indeed, but I'm not impressed with the consistency. I used 12 oz of chocolate, as one reviewer recommended, and they turned out too hard and difficult to handle. Not bad, just not worthy of a second act.

Tastes like there are more ingredients and much more difficult. I roll mine in crushed homemade tofee

I have made this recipe many times over the years and was devistated when our computer crashed and took the recipe with it. I'm excited to make it a part of our Christmas again.

I have given these truffles, since 1997 ,many times and always get requests for the recipe.

Have made far superior truffles to these. Not enough caramel flavor and too chewy... just plain boring and sweet for my taste. Try the "Cranberry Milk-Chocolate Truffles" from here - this recipe embodies what great truffles should be.

I cheated a little with these and added a little dark rum to the cream as it was scalding and rolled them in UNSWEETENED coconut! MMMMMMM. These are sweet, yes, but hey, you've thrown caution to the wind when making truffles anyways! Calories SHMALORIES!! :)

Wow! These are very easy to make! When I served these for some dinner guests I got all sorts of "oohs" and "ahhs". The nuts are an asset since the truffles are very very sweet, I also coated a few with cocoa to round out the sweetness and it worked well. I will definately make these again!

This received rave reviews by family, friends and strangers alike. Rather than using 2/3 c. heavy cream I substituted same amount of cream cheese. This made for a firmer and more easily handled consistancy. Also dipped these gems in melted chocolate and let set. A Favorite!!!

these truffles are excellent. i increased the amount of chocolate to firm them up, 12 oz in total, and it worked beautifully.

These were AWESOME!! I was looking for a way to use up some leftover caramel that I had from the Caramel Napolean recipe and this worked perfect. I just used about 1 cup of the caramel, heated it up and mixed in the rest of the ingrediants. It worked great and now I get two great desserts with half the work!

This was my first attempt at truffles and they turned out good. Next time I would do as another reviewer said and roll the truffles once then put them in the fridge and then roll them again so they will keep there shape. They are very rich and dense almost chewy. My husband suggested putting a whole almond in the center to break up the richness of the chocolate.

These little morsels are absolutely divine! Much easier to make than I thought they would be. I didn't need to return the pan to heat after adding the cream, the caramel was plenty hot to melt down on its own.

This was an immediate hit with my family. Be sure to cook the sugar well (this will help with the softness issue). I also added finely chopped toasted almonds for more holding power. If your truffle mix is still too soft, use it as a filling for a cake!

Delicious and easy. Could be firmer. I roasted the pecans and chopped them rather coarsely to give texture. Keep chilled batter in fridge between rolling,to keep it firm.

I rolled these, then refridgerated them and rolled them again as they had melted into a patty shape, a few at a time, returning them to the refridgerator immediately to retain their shape. I then dipped them in chocolate to enable them to retain their shape at room temperature. They are outstanding and a real hit with us!

An incredible recipe. No other truffle recipe comes close. Skip the Callebaut -- go with extra dark Valhrona, Scharffen-Berger or Lindt. The darker, the better. Still experimenting with the best way to form them. Piping works well if you get the batter to the right consistency first. Any other ideas?

This recipe is the best truffle recipe ever. First timers, after adding the cream allow all of the crystallized sugar to melt smooth again. I make over 100 pounds of candy every Christmas, and rolled in chopped pecans, this is the most requested.

I made these for Valentine's Day and thought they had just the right amount of decadence. I also thought they were very easy, especially since I've never made anything like this before. Mine were a little soft when I was shaping them also, but they firmed up fine after chilling in the fridge. I don't think anyone will care if they're not perfect round, since they taste so amazing.

The taste is wonderful, but I also found the texture a bit soft. They do not hold their round shape, even when in the fridge. This batch I will put into chocolate cups. Next time I will try letting the caramel mixture cook a bit longer. That's a guess, as I'm not experienced with candy/truffles. The flavor is extraordinary -- really strong caramel and chocolate. The texture, aside from being soft, is wonderfully creamy.

I'm not sure if my truffles have the perfect texture -- they always seem a bit gooey -- but I've never gotten a complaint on the taste. One of them puts me away for the night.

This recipe is very simple. I've found the best chocolate to use in this recipe is Callebaut- it lends a wonderful creamy mouthfeel without being cloying.
