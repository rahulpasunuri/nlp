I used unpeeled red potatoes sliced with the 1 mm blade in a food processor, soaked them an hour in ice water, then wrapped up the slices in a beach towel overnight so they'd be really dry for frying. I used canola oil and sprinkled them with salt, pepper, and a dusting of rosemary. They're delicious. Next time I'll slice them just a bit thicker, only because I like a heftier chip. I might try using peanut and olive oils, too, just to see the difference. I've tried making potato chips several times and haven't been too pleased with the results. I think the extended ice water bath and overnight towel-dry made the difference this time.

Four potatoes goes a long way. We made one batch with canola oil and one with peanut oil. The peanut oil was much better.

I am amazed at the reviewers complaining about the fat content. These ARE potato chips! I guess I shouldn't be surprised though, this is just another example of our distorted perspective of food. It is funny how we are sooo obsessed with low-fat food yet our obesity rate is over 4 times greater than countries that fry there potato chips and turn their noses up at "lite" food! These chips are so much better than anything in a bag. Definitely use the least-starchy potatoes you can find.

Definitely better than store bought.

For better tasting chips use red potatoes and cook them in olive oil. Sprinkle them with onion powder and sea salt. For faster results use a deep fryer and put in about 20 chips at a time.

These were great. Nobody believed that I made them myself. What I cannot believe is the other reviews who were surprised that this is a fattening recipe. What does one expect from potato chips. Don't make them if you don't want the fat.

I have been using organic potatoes in all of my potato recipes, baked, mashed, fried, etc., and have been getting a superior product. Cooks better, tastes like a potato!

Great recipe, but too fattening. Would appreciate a good recipe for baked potato chips.

The Russet potato is great for baking, but not for frying. The best potato for frying is the New potato, the large potato with the smooth light brown skin, sometimes called the White potato. The New potato absorbs far less oil. It's great for French Fry's Too. Try Fry's Louisiana style: Toss a hand full of Corn Meal in a brown paper bag. Toss in your cooked Fry's and shake to coat.

I have been making chips for sometime. The important part of the recipe is soaking the slices in cold water. I put the bowl in the refrigerator with slices for a few hours before frying. For a real treat use sweet potato's.

From just reading this recipe, I am not inspired to make it. Isn't this how ALL potato chip recipes are made? Cut potato and deep fry? Perhaps I'm missing the point but I don't see how this is a special recipe for chips.

This recipe sounds delicious, but the deep frying would most likely prevent me from trying it.

I am used to making "pommes chips" in France, and I make them easily with the potatoes found in France. I find that the potatoes here have too much starch and I can never have them as crisp as I used to.
