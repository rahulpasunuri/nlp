The most confusing and incomplete reciept ever written, made me want to scream. Funny texture. If you love fennel you might like it, but still not worth it.

I made this the day before Thanksgiving and baked on Thanksgiving day. I followed the recipe except for reducing the oil to 1/4 cup, used crusty whole grain bread with the crusts left on and added a bit more of homemade turkey stock than the recipe called for. Very delicious and I liked the leftovers cold the next day.

My opinion is that a good dressing recipe should be treated as inspiration - a good jumping off point - to make your own invention. I loved the idea of making kale a focus of the dressing. I omitted the fennel and fennel seeds, and added some fresh, sauteed oyster mushrooms to round out the earthiness of the dish. It was great! My mother said it was the best stuffing she had ever had.

Wow, this was fantastic! I made according to recipe with one exception. I did not have a bulb of fresh fennel on hand so I substituted a shot glass of Ouzu and deglazed the onions with it. I think it is possible to reduce the amount of oil called for in the recipe without sacrificing any flavor.

This sounds very good, and I am going to make as soon as I can get some good kale. But, man!, that's a lot of oil and butter, especially when you add in the far that the kale has already "slow cooked" in. Will reduce, and report back.
