I really liked this dish. It's great for the fall and winter. I left out the chicken livers, and served it over homemade whole wheat fettucine. Be generous with the black pepper - it really made the sauce come alive. I followed the directions for cutting the duck meat into 1-inch pieces, which meant that the breast meat turned into 1-inch cubes, really. I found that I liked the smaller pieces of meat in the sauce better compared to the larger 1-inch pieces, so next time I'll try cutting the meat more thinly, or shredding it. It seemed to be a bit of a waste to throw the breast meat into the sauce. Next time I'll think about setting the breasts aside, and using the thighs and some extra thighs if I can get them. It wasn't clear to me whether I should throw the wings into the pot with the bones and the meat. I did put them in, but then found that there was too much moisture in the bottom of the Dutch oven, preventing the meat from browning, so I removed them.
