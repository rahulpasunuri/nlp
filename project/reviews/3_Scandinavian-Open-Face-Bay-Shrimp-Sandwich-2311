Edible but completely forgettable and mediocre. Ingredients don't work well together for flavor or texture. Use the shrimp for any random recipe and you'll have a better meal.

I made this as a "dip" to serve on Wasa (Scandinavian) crackers and it worked quite well. This makes a nice and easy appetizer.

Cool and delicious. I don't know why this recipe doesn't get more traffic. Bay shrimp was worth it. So sweet! Now I'm ready to travel to that part of the world as well.

These open-faced sandwiches are a family favorite. I substitute dill rye bread for the pumpernickle. The perfect light meal for a hot summer evening.

IMHO, this was mediocre at best. I believe that there are probably tastier recipes out there that use $9/lb bay shrimp. For $3 less per pound, I think I'll buy large shrimp and cook them on the grill instead.

Added hard-boiled eggs as suggested by an earlier reviewer and served it for lunch with the tomato-basil crab bisque (recipe from this site) for lunch. It was excellent and beautiful. Most of the preparation was done the day before, so it was quick and easy to finish up just before serving.

This a favorite summertime recipe for me and my husband. It is a remarkably tasty and light meal. We use slices of toasted dill rye bread, rather than pumpernickel. Like the cook from Nova Scotia, we also use frozen shimp from Costco.

Delicious... almost as good as the open-faced sandwiches we get at Stockmann Department Store in Downtown Helsinki, Finland ! My husband is Finnish and we visit every couple years. This comes awfully close to the real thing!! I did add a hard-boiled egg, not the same without it!! This would also make a great appetizer (cut the bread into small pieces) ! Try this!!!

Yummy! This was so easy and so good. Better than the shrimp-wiches I get in restaurants around Halifax. I just used frozen cooked shrimp from Costco. I also tried it as a wrap in a wholewheat tortilla and it was equally tasty!
