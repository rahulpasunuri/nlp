Made this for an appetizer reception - my first trial I tried to bake in a sheet pan but had forgotten much of the salt which is crucial. For the real thing, did all cooking in a non-stick skillet as directed, thinly sliced yukon gold potatoes and onions, added a few dashes of paprika and 2 smashed garlic cloves to the oil as it heated, fished the garlic out as the veggies drained. Placed the pan under the broiler for 2 minutes to set the top enough to be able to flip. YUM!

This recipe is great except that it says to simmer the veggies in oil for far too long. My potatoes were done at 15 minutes. Mark Bittman's recipe is better. I also like a few of Bittman's tips like: the potatoes should not be put in the oil until hot enough to make the potato bubble. I also like his direction that tells you to turn the temperature down until the oil bubbles lazily, what a perfect description.

What a pain in the patootie this was! All that oil in the painstaking prep of the veggies and then ruin it all with only a scant tbl in the pan and the thing sticks and isn't cooked anyway because "Low" meant medium so the thing had not even BEGUN to cook after 15 minutes. Sheesh. I returned the mess to the pan, cranked it up and cut little squares out of it when done. THe painstaking prep at least resulted in a tasty if ugly result. Find a simpler recipe.

I can't write a review of this as I made a significant change, recommended below by another reviewer. Rather than slow cook the potatoes in oil I used kettle cooked potato chips (Route 11 chips, a local Virginia brand). I slow cooked the onions in about 1/4 olive oil and let them cool. Then combined about 4-5 oz of chips with the onions, fresh ground pepper, and 5 eggs. Once the chips had softened I cooked the mixture as directed in about 1 T of the oil from the onions, pressing down with a spatula. This served four as part of a tapas buffet with few leftovers. After dinner I asked my foodie friends if they could tell I had taken a shortcut and no one could. Great time saver!

Delicious and useful base that gets better with time. We spread cambazola cheese on top. I did add red pepper flakes, chopped fresh oregano and parsley and garlic. Did bake in a rectangular, well-buttered pan as we didn't have a nonstick skillet that was large enough.

Perfect recipe! Used my 10.25" well-seasoned cast iron skillet, 1.5 pounds red potatoes sliced at 1/4" on my mandolin, 1 large yellow onion, and 3/4 cup olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 6 large eggs. Followed all directions religiously and ended up with a magnificent tortilla. Recipe is amazingly easy and requires very little active work--just use a timer and check on it occasionally.

It's a great base for the essential Torta Espanola. I made three today for a dinner party, with more experimentation on the second and third. Adding fresh chopped thyme and sage when sauteing the veggies was a nice touch. It adds a little different, but complementary character.

use fewer eggs, put in paprika, and use olive oil.oh, and put in cut pieces of spanish chorizo.

This is a fantastic recipe for a basic Spanish Tortilla. I like this one because of the "low and slow" cooking method which yields more consistent results -- the version I've been making for years that I learned in Spain from my friend's Grandma is delicious, yet it is made quickly over high heat, and is a little more difficult to control the final product.

Good recipe, although I would make a few changes next time to make it more authentic-seeming. I'd use fewer eggs, maybe 6; you want the tortilla to be mostly potato, with egg as a binder. Olive oil is best. Don't worry about the amount of oil because you drain out a lot of it - use the remainder in other dishes because it has a wonderful flavor. And I just kept inverting without waiting in between - worked fine for me. Tastes awesome!

A tip from a friend saves me some time: I microwave, in batches, the onions and potatoes (post slicing) with a bit of oil tossed in, until tender. then finish off in pan before soaking in the egg and returning to pan. I like to let it soak for about 10 minutes.

this recipe is great! i've tried other tortilla recipes, and they just didn't have that same deliciousness that i remembered from eating in spain. i also agree that thinly sliced potatoes is definitely the better way to go. though i'm not a huge believer in the need for authenticity, that's how the tortilla i ate in spain was done for the most part. it also makes a great stacking effect. you can definitely use less oil than 1.5 cups. i've made this several times and have done between 1-1.25 cups, which is plenty.

This was my favorite meal when I lived in Spain...it's best as a bocadillo (served cool on crusty hard bread). I love the potatoes sliced thin so they make layers in the tortilla instead of cubed. My shortcut? Kettle cooked potato chips (Cape Cod Potato Chips are best but Lays makes some too). Just soak them in the egg mixture. Cook the onion in MUCH less oil and add when cooled. The rest is the same. Ooooo....leave out the extra salt. Your chips will be salty enough!

Incredible! It's potato heaven! Tastes better at room temperature than cooled.

I make this all the time, and I love having it either for breakfast/brunch or cut into squares for an appetizer for parties. Even though you cook the potatoes in oil, my finished tortilla never seems overly oily. Just makes sure you drain the potatoes well. Every time I make it it blows my mind that so few ingredients can create such explosive flavor.

This was very time consuming, but worth every minute! I had a dinner party and everyone raved about it. I added some grilled red & yellow peppers for color. I also used about half of the oil suggested as it seemed excessive.

This is a delicious tortilla. It is not difficult to make, but it is labor-intensive and takes a while. The omelette is huge--it filled my nonstick 12-inch pan entirely, and almost was too much.. Next time, I would divide the recipe and make it smaller. But the flavors are wonderful.

great recipe and easy. I halved the recipe. I used ramps instead of onions since they are in season and they actually made it tastier and more complex than usual tortilla espanola. Also sauteed the veg in truffle butter and 2 tsp of oil. I covered it so it cooked in 20 min. Didn't drain and added beaten eggs directly to the mix. 20 min on one side and 2 min on the other. My husband who was not in the mood for eggs really enjoyed it and asked for seconds. Served with spicy mesclun salad with a citrus dressing and garlic french string beans.

This recipe is delicious. I used what others recommended for oil - about 2 tbsp - and could have probably used a bit less. I made it in a Calphalon non-stick pan and it set up very nicely and didn't stick at all. Excellent, and will make it again!

This tasted very much like I remembered from Spain. I brought it to a family sunday brunch and it was a big hit! Tasted great at room temperature. I used much less oil, probably about two tablespoons, and added some red bell pepper to the potatoes and onions and a bit of paprika to the eggs. I used red potatoes (sliced, not chopped) and left the peel on for the color. Also, because I used less oil, there was no need to drain the potatoes so I skipped that step and just poured the eggs right in to the pan. This recipe makes a lot of food. Be prepared for leftovers!

It was great, however I'd cut back on the oil (next time I'll just use 1/2), and potatoes. The oil was okay, just unnecessary, the potatoes seemed like too much for the "authentic" dish...

This is an excellent and very easy recipe! My friend Maria from Spain used to make this all the time for an easy weeknight dinner. The only hard part is getting it out and back into the pan, but I feel victorious everytime I manage it.

Excellent basic recipe for Tortilla Espanola. Try adding a little pimenton - Spanish smoked paprika usually used in paella - for a subtle flavor boost. For a more robust dish, you might add chopped bell pepper and Spanish chorizo. Tortilla with a green salad was truly one of my favorite meals when I attended school in Madrid. M.

I've made this several times and it's a hit every time. An alternative to all the flipping is: preheat your broiler, when the tortilla is 3/4 cooked from the bottom up, broil the top of the tortilla. Also, think I've added sun dried tomatoes and feta; or, cubes of ham and cheddar. It's a fool proof recipe and it's easy to play with it.

This was great! Like others, this recipe brought to mind time spent in Spain. I cut the potatoes into 1/8" slices, rather than dicing them. I also ended up cooking the potato-onion mixture in a Dutch oven, as the potatoes kept falling out of my skillet when I stirred them. (After they were cooked and drained, I finished cooking the tortilla in the skillet.) Although it did take about 45 minutes for the potatoes and onions to soften, I found the cooking times after adding the eggs to be too long (although I suppose it could be my stove burner that was at fault). I'll defintely be making this again and again.

So simple and sooo delicious! Added one additional egg - might add two the next time -- amd there will be a next time!! Not at all oily or greasy as one may think just reading the ingred.

This dish is VERY simple and should take more than 45 minutes, start to finish, to make. I lived in Madrid and ate this everyday and saw it prepared by native Madrilenos. First, the potatoes should never be chopped: thinly slice them whole, about an 1/8 of an inch thick. There is no need to precook the onions and potatoes in so much oil. Simply cover the bottom of a large non-stick skillet with extra virgin olive oil, heat and add potatoes and onions and cook, uncovered about 20 minutes, until soft. Add the eggs right on top so that they cover the potatoes entirely, cover and cook until almost completely set before inverting. Here's a trick--invert it onto a flat skillet, like one you use to cook pancakes, then you can finish it up on that skillet for a few minutes w/o having to invert it two more times.

Excelente! Great comfort food. Wonderful cold, room temp, or hot. Perfect for brunch. I might use a less onion next time. I agree to reduce cooking time of potatoes by covering.

I prepared this exactly as the recipe said, and it was fabulous! A friend who has lived in Spain found it very authentic. It's also great for people not able to eat dairy.

This was OK, but I had two problems with it. First of all: 45 minutes for the potatoes and onions?! After 20 on very low heat they were shrunken and withered - I feared for their lives so proceeded to the next step. I can't imagine what 45 would do to them. Then the eggs were overcooked, again even on extremely low heat. The tastes & quantities were good, though.

I cut the oil to 2 tablespoons and did not drain it. I also added a couple of tablespoons of chopped roasted red bell pepper. It really perked up the look and taste. I cooked it in small nonstick skillets. The recipe made four smaller tortillas. They were one of the hits at my tapas party.

I pretty much followed the recipe, but tweaked it here and there...no major changes. This was delicious. It tasted just as I expected it to.

This recipe has allowed me the luxury of reminiscing of the good old days I lived in Madrid. I've tried to make tortillas many times over the years, but this one is just as delicious and MUCH easier than most. If you follow the recipe exactly, you won't be disappointed. In Spain in the tapas bars, this is often cut into squares and served with toothpicks.

Haven't tried to make this yet (will attempt tonight!), but I just wanted to note that a great way to eat tortilla after it's cold is on a sandwich (as they do in Spain). Take some French bread, and smear it with tomato. Very tasty.

Great recipe. Had a little trouble getting it to set, so I put it under the broiler for a few minutes, and then inverted - voila! Used much less oil - it went like hot cakes!

This is a good recipie. To speed the cooking time up on the potatoes, put a lid on them to soften them up. The key to really enjoying this recipie is to let it sit at room temperature for several hours before serving.

Don't be fooled by the simple ingredients, this dish is a lot of work. I think a non-stick pan is a very important part of its success, as is paying attention to the terms 'low heat'. The top should still be wet when you turn it over, otherwise it will just get brown in spots and look pallid. I used safflower oil to cook the potatoes in and that seemed to work, almost the entire amount drained away afterwards, so I wouldn't worry too much about using the cup and a half. I made this, sour-cream streusel coffee cake, and buttermilk biscuits with smoked ham and cheese, and this was the first to go. People adored it, I cut a circle in the center and cut that into wedges, and then cut the outer ring into wedges also so the slices weren't too dauntingly big. People speared them with toothpicks and kept coming back. Superb,and according to a Catalan gentleman at the brunch, perfectly authentic.

Seemed like a lot of work for an omelette but the results justify the method. I halved the recipe and it fed four easily. Oil wasn't specified so I used olive and reduced the amount from 3/4 to half a cup. Next time will add a bit of garlic. Needs something tasty on the side - I served green tomato chutney but I wonder what would be appropriate the Spanish accompaniment...
