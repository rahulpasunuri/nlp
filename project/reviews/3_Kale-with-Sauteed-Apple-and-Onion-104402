Really easy and quick and very tasty. Made this with a bag of kale and turnip greens I got from my farm share this week, which was about .5 lbs, but after reading previous reviews, I kept the rest of the ingredients the same except the water, which I cut in half and added some bouillion to as well. Waited until the end to add the apples and also threw in some craisins and toasted pine nuts. Made sure to season well with salt and pepper and a dash of lemon juice. Will definitely make again.

I often wondered how kale would taste but never tried it as I've always been told it is tough, and bitter, but yesterday when I found a 1 lb. bag in the vegetable display for a little over a dollar I decided to go for it, as it offers much in nutritional value. I followed JinJo's advice. Thought I had curry in the cupboard, but since I was out I used instead 2 generous tablespoons of Dijon mustard andthrew a handful of golden raisins with the apples which I cooked for the last 4 minutes. It was delicious! Now I want to try it again with the curry. Made for a great lunch and will be an excellent Fall/Winter sidedish.

This is so good I've made it twice this week already. I used a small organic red delicious the first time and a large Johnny Gold the second time. Both times I used apple juice instead of water as other reviewers suggested. I didn't mind the apples getting a little mushy. My toddler even loved this pureed. I loved it so much, I ate the pureed leftovers. The trick is to caramelize the onions. I chopped the kale, stems and all, finely.

The ingredients here are include an excellent blend of tastes. My problem is that there is not really enough of anything, except the kale but I ten to like strong flavors. So, I changed and added the following with very good results: 2 Granny Smith/other apples 3 tablespoons olive oil 2 small/medium onions, chopped finely 2 large cloves garlic, minced 1 tablespoon curry powder 1 lb. kale, as above 1 cup salted canned/other chicken/vegetable broth 2-3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar Freshly ground black pepper to taste More Kosher salt to taste This worked wonderfully. I received rave reviews! And I totally enjoyed the dish! Being a child of the Deep South, I'm used to greens being cooked for at least two hours, which drains all the vitamins and minerals from them. I continue to learn. Able to whip up a mean risotto, I was still unable to cook greens properly. Thank you!

I'm not a huge kale fan but this was great, to my surprise. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and didn't add the apple until the last minute, just letting it all sit together for a minute or so on the heat until the apples were heated through and got some of the curry and other flavors mixed in. Great texture and flavor balance. Will DEFINITELY make this again!

this wasn't as tasty as I thought it would be. I think adding chicken broth would have been a good idea.

I love this recipe. I actually added the apples for just a second or two before I took it out of the pan. I cut them into thin slices. I really enjoyed the sweet crunch it gave the dish. I also added a little hot sauce along with chili flakes which gave it a nice zing. Over all it was really good, ill make again and again!

Wonderful! I do agree adding the apples towards the end of cooking would make them less mushy. I substituted chicken broth for the water. This will be one of my staple sides, now. Excellent!!

I added some coconut milk I found hiding in the back of my fridge in place of the water. Yum.

maybe I just don't like Kale, I did not care for this neither did my boyfriend. I tried putting the apples in the same time as the kale and they still turned to mush.

I attempted to eat a salad made with kale without knowing what I was getting myself into. In an effort to not waste the head of kale, I discovered this recipe and I love it. I make it for as many people as I can! This is a perfect dish for getting your servings of dark leafy greens while making them taste good at the same time.

This was so great. Delicious hot or cold. I added the apple at the same time as the kale. I might even add it a little later next time. Also added a bit more curry than suggested. The sweet curried apple complemented the kale perfectly!

Rating: 3
Tasty. Like others, I waited to add the apples until I threw in the kale to keep them crisp. Also added a few extra shakes of curry powder. I served the kale on top of quinoa cooked in chicken broth. Delicious and well-rounded meal!

This is my favourite method for cooking kale. I substitute 1 tsp of curry paste for the curry powder.

I like the idea of this recipe a lot. I didn't have curry powder on hand, so I used brown sugar instead to sweeten it a bit. I was serving pork tenderloin, and a little sweetness works very well, especially with apple and onion, two things I would almost always serve with pork tenderloin.

This recipe wasn't the best. I thought the flavors would meld more together. Perhaps, as one reviewer stated, if I would have used same day fresh kale it would have had less of a contrast in taste. I did like the apples and onions with the curry, but my kale felt bitter and too much of a contrast in texture, compared to the soft apples. I don't think I would ever make this again. Maybe the apples, onions but instead of kale, perhaps spinach?

i don't even need to review this because it has all been said, but i also doubled the curry and used to fuji apple (all i had on hand). definitely add them when you add the kale. i also left a handful of apple chunks and tossed them in with the finished product to give it a little bit of crispiness. i think this would be good with added cinnamon as well!

Definitely use chicken broth, and 2Tbsp curry. I mixed finished recipe with pasta and some ground lamb--a complete, wonderful meal!

Marvelous take on greens for fall/winter. My only suggestion would be to double the amount of curry powder.

I've never eaten kale in my life - totally freaked me out before, and I had absolutely no idea how to cook the stuff. I followed the recipe, almost... used red fuji apples instead, and threw in about 3 teaspoons of curry powder (cause I love it)... Loved how it tasted, but like someone else said, my apples were mushy - so next time, I'd use green, and not put them in until the end (or not saute them with the onions). I'm not a cook by any stretch of the imagination, so I loved that this was not an intimidating recipe to follow!

If you're not a fan of kale, give this one a try - it won me over. Fantastic recipe that lets you experience a familiar vegetable in a new way.

This recipe as written is about a two fork recipe. I made changes which brought it up to a 3 or 4: Per other reviewers I used apple juice and chicken broth. I also used freshly ground sea salt (not much) two grinds of the salt mill for each serving at the table. I also added two packets of Splenda to it, and more curry than called for. It was delicious that way, and my husband ate it until it was all gone, something he rarely does with any dish. He really watches his weight. Remember with cooking with kale, the older it is the stronger it will taste and the tougher it will be. Use kale and other strong flavored vegetables the day you bring them home from the store. My kale was the freshest I could get, straight from the farmer's garden. I still prefer kale raw in a salad. Yum!

Delicious recipe. I removed the onions and apples from the pan to avoid the sogginess of boiled apples and sauteed the kale in 1/4 c. chicken broth, 1/4 c. apple cider until liquid was reduced by 2/3. Added back the carmelized onions and crisp-tender apples to heat through. Super healthy Can be super good :)

Love this recipe, but I think next time I'll add more curry and cook the apples at the end. Mine turned out mushy what with timing everything as I was cooking other dishes for my dinner.

The recipe was simple & pretty quick; this is my first time making kale. I used 2 Fuji apples & about double the curry (I heart curry!). I'm giving the dish 2 forks because it didn't "WOW" me nor the people who I cooked for, but it's still decent. (I rarely give 4 forks.) Next time, I will try addig some toasted pine nuts, as some other reviewers have suggested; and I'll probably add some garlic too because what is a dish without garlic?!

Rating: 4
This recipe rocks! I used Lacinato Kale with lemon curry powder because that's what I had. I also used Fuji apples instead. Just for kicks I added toasted slivered almonds. I always keep nuts in the freezer just fot this occasion. I really recommend this tasty treat!

Fast, easy and satisfying. I didn't realize I was out of curry powder, so in desperation, I turned to chili powder. Not the best substitution, but the finished product turned out well enough. Instead of a Granny Smith, I used a Northern Spy apple (one of the best cooking apples - try a pie full of them sometime, you won't regret it), and a bit of white wine with the water. I look forward to trying it with curry powder next time.

I have never cooked Kale before because I didn't know how and so I chose this recipe for the simplicity and both my husband and I were very pleased and both had seconds. I used a gala apple and it was fantastic. I also chose to add a lot more curry and it was great!

This is a simple, delicious, and nutrious recipe that can be made quickly. One of the previous reviewers (Princeton, NJ?) obviously didn't follow the instructions. Everything comes out crisp and fresh tasting, especially with green apple.

I might have given more forks if I'd followed the recipe to the letter, but it made a "medicinal" veggie much more palatable to me. My husband liked it quite a bit, and our 6-year-old asked for seconds after finally consenting to try a smidgen with a bite of grilled chicken (she responds well to our playing hardball: You must finish a small serving of each item offered in order to qualify for dessert). Ease of preparation is a must in this house, so I used frozen kale and a snack cup of Mott's unsweetened granny smith applesauce, along with thinly-sliced vidalia onion and a splash of outdated hard cider (which is just this side of vinegar--perfect for cooking). Will definitely make this again.

Rating: 1
This didn't do it. The apple was mushy and almost indistinguishable from the onion. Not a lot of interesting flavor. We ended up adding a splash of viniger and that perked it up a bit. Wasn't difficult to make, but simply not worth making.

Not bad, but not amazing either - I wouldn't go out of my way to make it again.

Quite good. Unusual and a perfect match with cider-glazed pork as recommended on this site. Good way to eat kale, which can be an "unapproachable" type of vegetable.

A nice, healthy unusual side dish. Possibly our curry was outdated, but next time I would use more curry. A colorful and interesting side dish and worthy of company.

I've made this recipe many, many times over the last couple of years. I really enjoy it--especially with one of the non-ornamental kale varieties, like dinosaur kale (lacinato) or black or red kale. I like these better than the curly ornamental variety, but that was my only choice for a long time and it's good too. I am seven months pregnant, and this is a tasty and simple way for me to eat healthy kale.

This was just okay. My boyfriend didn't want to eat it. I didn't think it was so hot myself, and I grew up on kale. It tastes healthy but needs more flavor. Not so great with porkchops, but maybe something lighter like fish.

Delicious recipe! I didn't think I liked Kale until I tried this recipe. I followed other reviewers suggestions and added more curry powder. I used Red Kale. Would definetely make it again, mainly because it tastes great, it has very few ingredients and it is quick and good for you. It went really well with the pork we had.

Aack! Aack! Aack! I love leafy greens, and especialy kale but this was pure yuck. I even tried reducing white wine as a substitute for half the water but it was just utter uck. I threw the whole thing out and sauteed some snow peas instead. If you want a really great kale recipe try the kale, white bean and roasted vegetable soup (it includes roasted butternut squash...yummmm). It is lovely.

I didn't think I liked kale until I tried this recipe. It's a perfect side dish to pork. My junk food eating husband even liked it and I normally can't get him to eat more than a bite of any one vegetable. I thought the curry would be too overwhelming but it was extremely subtle and complimentery to the apples and onions.

In the past, I've been preparing kale steamed, with just a splash of red wine vinegar. This recipe is sweeter and more interesting. My husband liked it and so did my son-in-law. I followed the recipe exactly. I'm printing out copies to give to fellow cooks.

This dish is just what I like when preparing a large meal - easy, attractive, and just a little unusual (compared to other green vegetables). Leaving the peel on the apple made it even easier to prepare, and as I was making this ahead of time, kept the apple from turning to mush on reheating. I doubled the recipe and had plenty for seven people - the serving size of 2 must be based on main-dish size servings.
