Just a quick story. My 13 year old grandaughter told me about this delicious dip she had eaten. With a few guesses from me, it turned out to be hummus. I/we found this recipe to be so very good. My grandaughter thought it was even better than what she had. We, and the rest of the family just loved it. I went with the cilantro, and the cumin. It kicked it up a notch!

Excellent and easy to make. And addictive! I first made them w/ the accompanying clam dip but they are just as good for any kind of dip or just to munch on.

I've tried these in many variations - sprayed them with garlic Pam instead of butter or oil, dusted them with cayenne papper, seasoned salt, seasoning blends. They're great with Salsa.

These are delicious and so easy to make! Served with hummus, tzatziki, and eggplant spread. Will definitely make again.

These are surprisingly wonderful. Try variations like using wheat pitas, or often mince some garlic cloves into butter and spread this on the pitas before baking. This is amazing!

i didn't think these would be anything special but they were delicious. they were light & had a very rich flavor, far better than chips or crackers. i cut them before baking & only baked about 8-9 minutes on bottom shelf. i will definitely make them again when using anything that can be dipped.

Very good. Another hint; cut rounds first and then separate for even less tearage.

I used kitchen shears to cut the edge off of the pita before separating it. Much easier and it didn't tear the bread. I also used spray olive oil and regular salt. Great for hummus and any other dip.

Perfect vehicle for all sorts of dips. Classier than potato chips, lighter than baked baguette toasts...
