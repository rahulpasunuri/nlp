Although liquids & dry ingredients do need a tiny bit of adjusting, this recipe deserves a place in the 'classics' section of your recipe book. Easy enough to make - AND to eat (they'll be gone within minutes...)

The water, you are right, it's too much. I made this recipe from the magazine and while it is quite liquid, the end results were amazing.

Something went wrong here. My batter turned out to be very liquid--there was no spreading it. Note the amount of liquid exceeds amount of corn meal and flour! I mixed another cup of dry ingredients into batter and they turned out pretty good.
