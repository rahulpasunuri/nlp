These potatoes were a huge hit with our large group of Thanksgiving diners, most of whom were in their 20's. We are saving the recipe and will use it again.

Definitely the fluffiest and tastiest mashed potatoes I've ever eaten! I don't like using a food mill, so made these with a mixer and got great results!

We made this last night and loved it! Selected thyme instead of the rosemary. In addition, we made a few more changes: added a few more peppercorns, used a ricer instead of the food mill, lowfat milk instead of whole milk. Potatoes fantastic!!!

The potatoes were, indeed, fluffy. But I did not like the slightly bitter taste from the herbs. I prefer mashed potatoes to be comforting -- tasting of cream and butter. I will continue to use the technique but will eliminate the thyme and bay leaf.

I followed the recipe to the letter and behold, perfect mashed potatoes! I didn't even have to add salt at the end...I'll follow this method from now on.Perfect texture and flavor.

Made this recipe EXACTLY as indicated. Who knew potatoes could be so quick and easy. The small size vuts the boiling time way down and they were very light and fluffy. Everything cooked in exactly the time indicated. I will be tripling this recipe for Thanksgiving this year.
