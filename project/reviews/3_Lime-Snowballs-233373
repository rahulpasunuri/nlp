Excellent! Sift the flour and cornstarchfor a more powdery cookie.

I thought the recipe as is was too chalky with the 1/2 cp of cornstarch so I made another batch and used 1/4 cp cornatarch and an additional 1/4 cp of flour. Much better taste. Lime oil no longer available at Sur la Tab. King Arthur catalog carries it.

Love lime, but didn't care for these. Found lime oil, made as directed, but the lime taste was artifical not fresh as I had expected

I too had melted snowballs. I used a cookie scooper and made them exactly. They taste great - a little dry but that might be how they are. I also could not find lime oil (Williams-sonoma disc. it, but did have lemon oil)

A quick note before your holiday baking begins- do not freeze or chill dough overnight. This dough works best when chilled, but also made on the same day.

The cookies taste great. But, I too had melted snowballs, and had left the dough in the refrigerator overnight. In addition, my cookies were done in less than 1/2 the 23 minutes referenced.

These cookies are a hit. I have made these twice now and have 2 tips for fantastic cookies- refrigerate the dough longer than the recommended time (2 hours or more) and pack the cold dough into a small cookie dough scoop (the size of a melon baller)- these two changes ensure a nice tight snowball when baked(no melted snow!) and uniform snow balls. These cookies are tasty, light and simply fantastic! Make a double batch as they don't last long.

I am only 12 years old and I thought that this reipe was extremly easy! They were so good! I didn't use any lime oil and they turned out perfectly fine! They were also really adicting! Once you had just one, I couldn't stop eating them.

My husband and I found the flavor of these cookies spectacular but I couldn't get the cookies to keep a snowball form, even after putting them in the freezer. I had the melted snowball effect that another reviewer wrote of. I will make these again and again because they are very good and hopefully I will figure out how to keep them in snowball form. Re lime oil. I found an affordable and small bottle of lime oil at Balduccis. It was $3.50. I believe Williams Sonoma also carries it.

Just simple and an immediate new favorite! We've made the standard and tasty Russian Teacakes for years at Christmas and my husband wants to switch to these. I didn't have the lime oil, so packed it with lots of lime zest, and they were wonderful. The cornstarch makes them light and delicate (not dry at all for us). I rolled the little balls out as soon as the dough was mixed and chilled it a short time - not the 45 minutes. Still wonderful.

These cookies were very good! I put several dozen in a large glass jar topped with a ribbon for Christmas gifts!

This was delicious! I could not find the lime oil so I used a lemon one and they were still great. Loved the lime flavor! My only advice is do not use a silpat sheet since you dust the cookies w/ sugar. Parchment paper makes more sense from a clean up perspective.

There must be something wrong with the ingredients - I have never used 1/2 cup of cornstarch in anything! They were very, very dry! As I paid $15 for a bottle of lime oil and just used a 1/2 teaspoon in this failed batch, I decided to modify a snowball recipe I use with walnuts and brandy - substituting the lime juice, zest and oil for the brandy. These were VERY good. The lime did have a good zing to it. But I would like the editors to advise if there was a misprint, but in the interim, my version worked fine.

I made these with lemon instead of lime. I made them twice, and the second time I doubled the amount of lemon oil. It made a HUGE difference. The lemon was still delicate but a lot more flavorful.

I'll try it with more flour; mine melted, too. Also, a bit of salt would perk up the flavor. I DID use lime oil but I think maybe a bit more is needed.

i didn't care for the lime oil, it gives a slightly artificial flavor. the fresh lime juice and zest should stand well on their own. if i were to make these again, i would omit the oil.

I made half the recipe but still ended up with 20-odd cookies, so I'm not sure about the stated yield. I skipped the lime oil and used extra juice and zest instead, but there still wasn't enough lime flavour. I will try making another batch with the lime oil, but will probably still use additional juice and zest - I think these need a lot more flavour. The texture was fabulous, though.

Not too thrilled with the consistency of these cookies - they were more like melted snowballs... :-) Too much butter, too little flower. Taste was pretty okay.

These were good, just boring. I was expecting the lime to put some excitement into traditional snowballs, but I think I'd rather have the old. They were very easy to make though.

These just melt in your mouth. My daughter said they were the best cookies she has ever had. Didn't use the lime oil, does not exist here in our small town, but they were still yummy.
