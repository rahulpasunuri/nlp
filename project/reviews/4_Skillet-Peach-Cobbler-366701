me again - not a cobbler person! i liked the result - then altered the mix/process: i cut the sugar to 1 1/4 cups, cut the creme fraiche to just what was in the cake 3/4 cup - swapping it for buttermilk. i added the butter to the batter. and omitted the preserves.put raspberries and peaches in the bottom of the skillet, caramelizing them first. it came out more like a classic southern upside down cake... :0)

I love this recipe. I can my own peaches and peach preserves and use those when fresh peaches aren't in season - 2 quart jars equals about 2 lbs, just drain them good first. I also use plain yogurt instead of creme fraiche and sometimes sub in goat milk for regular whole milk. I find I also need to cook it for 60-65 minutes, maybe just my oven. A little nutmeg is also fantastic.

I have made this so many times. It is the best peach cobbler out there. I substitute the Creme Fraiche with Sour cream. It comes out perfect.

I made this for our small group at church and they loved it.

Gave this three forks instead of 4 because I changed it so much, and did so because of previous reviews. Used the pyrex suggestion and made in a 2 qt casserole dish, used 6 peaches blanched and peeled in the bottom of the dish, sprinkled with some ginger powder, and covered with the batter. As for the batter, I used sour cream, had skim milk so used only about 3/4 cup, less than one tsp salt, and only 3/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar. Added cinnamon and ginger to flour also. This upside down peach cake turned out very yummy, both warm and cold. Baked 1 hr at 350.

Making this for my foodies unite dinner on Saturday. I've alresdy made it once and totally enjoyed the peach cake. Any suggestions for an after dinner drink to serve along side the dessert?

This was delicious but definitely more cake-y then cobbler-y. Needed more peaches, which i blanched for easier pealing. I used full fat greek yogurt in place of creme-fraiche.

The cobbler with the creme fraiche whipped cream were outstanding. However the cobbler took more than 1-1/2 hours to cook completely so only the whipped cream wound up making it to the party for someone elses pies. I served the cobbler the next night with dinner to rave reviews. The recipe is worth the effort but the cooking instructions really needs to be revised.

This is more like a coffeecake than a cobbler. The salt needs to be reduced and I also added a few good grinds of fresh nutmeg to the batter mix.

Well, it definitely isn't a cobbler - more of a cake. I used the 2 cup measurement for the peaches rather than the weight measurement - which was only 3 peaches. I think it could have used more! Also, my skillet is about 14 inches and the listed cooking time was perfect. ALSO - far too much salt as written. Half it, at least. I'll try a more traditional cobbler recipe next time.

Made this two days ago with delicious red haven peaches. Reading through the recipe, I was surprised by it calling for TWO tsp. of salt. That seemed like an awful lot to me so I cut it in half and glad I did. Also think the recipe is misleading in that it calls for more peaches by weight than will fit in the specified two cup measure. I used the weight measurement which was about 6 peaches before pitting/peeling. It seemed like too much but that could account for it taking extra time in the oven. I would not make it in a skillet again; I think it would have cooked more evenly in a pyrex baking dish. I did not have a 12 inch cast iron skillet but did have an anodized Calphalon 12 inch, which is what I used. It turned out alright but I have tastier recipes for peach cake/cobbler/crisp.

Delish!! Glad I read the other reviews first so I was prepared for increasing the baking time by another 30 min. or so. I splurged on the creme fraiche (much richer and creamier than sour cream) but used Trappist peach preserves rather than making the Lord Grey's recipe as mentioned in Bon Appetit. Think I used 7-8 large fresh, albeit very ripe, Georgia peaches. Husband raved and had a 2nd helping. Topped with Breyers Natural Vanilla ice cream. Yummo!!!!

Outstanding! I, too, used the sour cream instead. The issue though, for me, was how liquid it was during the baking process. I baked it for a full 30-40 minutes longer than called for in the recipe. It turned out great in the end, but I was a little freaked out at 50 minutes when it was peach soup in the middle.

Delicious. We also used sour cream. And almond extract.

Amazing! I too substituted sour cream for creme fraiche. Also added cinnamon to the batter and increased the preserves by half. It's more like a cake than a cobbler but either way it's delicious!!! Going to try it with raspberries next time. Worth a try for sure!
