This is so good! I made it with venison with and added a tablespoon of smoked paprika and it was moist and delicious! I did not do the tomatoes and shallots, but served it with potatoes and gravy.

Could not pass on writing a review because this was so exceptional. I made this as specified, but made my own gravy in a crockpot with beef stock, roasted shallots, tawny port, diced tomatoes and sauted mushrooms that sat on low all day. I also basted the loaves with a mixture of ketchup, mustard and brown sugar and baked it in the convection oven at 350º for 1 hour. It was exactly 160º. For some reason I expected it to be on the dry side because of the lack of fat in bison/buffalo. I was stunned. It is the most moist and tasty meatloaf I've ever eaten. It wasn't cheap- regular supplier suffered a fire therefore I paid $23 for nearly 2 lbs of meat- but in the long run, it was definitely worth it.

The best meat loaf I've ever had. We've made it several times now, and each time it's been terrific. Only once did I have enough juice at the end to make gravy, and even that was really good. After a small bit of experimentation, I've replaced the bread crumbs with instant cook oats, and I double the carrots. Sometimes I use new potatoes instead of tomatoes around it, and either work. Make sure you mince the vegetables really well. The smaller they are, the better the meat loaf will turn out.

I've made this recipe many times since it was first published in 2000, and it has never disappointed. Tonight I used 1 lb bison, 3/4 lb ground pork shoulder, and substituted green pepper for celery. My family of four scarfed down the whole thing. Yum.

Used lean ground beef instead of buffalo, skipped the shallots & tomatoes and used BBQ sauce instead of ketchup. Very lean and tasty.

We doubled the onion and made sure we used a red onion, we've tried it twice with different cuts of buffalo from various vendors (all online). Our fav is Cowboy Free Range... http://www.cowboyfreerangemeat.com We haven't went back and usually buy 4 lbs of buffalo meat, split it in two, and make two of the Meat Loafs from this recipe!!! THANK YOU

I made this in a loaf pan, skipping the shallot/tomato part and glazed with ketchup instead. It was moist, tender, and very flavorful. I'll definitely make it again!

This is a great meatloaf recipe. My family prefers it to the "regular kind". It moist and has its own "gravy".

I made this last night and followed the recipe exactly. Served it with the Sauteed Kale (also on this site) and mashed Yukon Golds. LOVED it. I was amazed at how moist the meat was without being greasy. Bison (I was told by our local farmers that "buffalo" doesn't exist - must be a Canada-U.S. thing?)is our new favorite red meat and this is a perfect way to introduce it to your family.

Absolutely love this recipe and found it originally when I was trying leaner meats for my husband. Since then I have made it multiple times and the only change I do is put the meat in a loaf pan and line the loaf pan with the shallots and tomatoes and then top the meatloaf with tomatoes. It is easier and the meatloaf is so flavorful on it's on that I don't find that it needs anything else.

Using ground beef, I doubled the recipe and made it at the firehouse. They all said it was the best meatloaf they had ever eaten. I followed the recipe to the letter (except for the buffalo), including the cooking time. Next time I'll use less salt than the recipe calls for.

I'm certainly not a chef or even consider myself culinarian, is that a word? - but I have used this particular recipe for buffalo, chicken, turkey and beef. It is particularly good in turkey in my opinion. Buffalo, when I feel like it is very tasty also. I do use oats instead of bread crumbs, olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and I now skip the shallots and tomatoes part. If you like just good eatin', and not too fatty of a palette , give this a whirl.

Other than one important change to the meatloaf part of this recipe, I follow it exactly and love it. I make it a lot and serve it with pureed cauliflower (South Beach Mashers)and broccoli for a low carb dinner. I am lucky enough to use really good venison and I do not add any other meat to it. I tried it once with buffalo and did not like it as much. I think buffalo is actually leaner than my venison but, this is a guess. I think if you use buffalo you might want to add some ground pork. I like the tomato and shallot base as well and prepare it that way some of the time.

This is going to replace my current recipe for meatloaf!! You cannot tell that it is bison versus hanburger. Also, the lack of grease leftover in the pan speaks volumes. I used mini multicoloured potatoes instead of tomatoes.

I made this recipe for my husband tonight and if I had let him, he would have had thirds and fourths! I put aside some extra sauteed onion and celery which I added to sauteed wild mushrooms to make a sauce. Served with oven browned potatoes and a salad it was wonderful. I don't use beef any longer for health reasons and I'm always looking for good bison recipes.

I made this with beef since I didn't have buffalo and it was delicious.

This recipe is excellent. I had to adjust it because I only had 1 lb. of bison, and I replaced the shallots with green onions. I highly recommend this recipe, and I will definitely make it again.

This meat loaf was amazing. It was so moist and delicious. I'll take buffalo over beef any day. I also didn't deglaze the pan and didn't feel like it was missing anything. ENJOY!

I've made this dish 3 times now and have never been dissapointed. It's a tasty, moist meatloaf and I cannot ask for more. One point; don't use canned, dry breadcrumbs. Take the time to make fresh ones. I freeze my bread slices and then chop them up while still frozen with a sharp knife. It's easier than using a food processer with none of the clean up!

Superb buffaloaf! Made some minor changes with ingredients on hand; used oatmeal instead of breadcrumbs, merlot sauce instead of worcestershire, and deglazed the pan with sweet vermouth instead of water. Looked great and tasted terrific! Will definitely make again!

I've made this meatloaf here in New York for my husband and myself. We loved it. When we were visiting our son and daugter-in-law in Nevada I found the recipe on your website and made it again. It was, again, a delicious and beautiful dish. It also provided a source for terrific sandwiches with what was left over

WOW .. I love this recipe, it's a keeper.. This was my first time cooking with buffalo and i was amazed :)

Easy recipe, but difficult to get buffalo meat, so I just use beef.... it juicy and delicious!

Rating: 4
I was skeptical but this was great! I didnt bother with the shallots and tomatos or deglazing the pan. I cover the loaf with my moms old glaze of 1/2 cup ketchup, 3 Tbl yellow mustard & 3 Tbl brown sugar. I think its important to use fresh breadcrumbs instead of dried, I ground some sourdough in the food processor. A lot of fat cooks out of the loaf so if you are watching your fat intake be sure to form the loaf in a pan instead of cooking in a loaf pan.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. The flavors were very bland and the meatloaf did not hold together at all.

My husband loved his mother's meatloaf, but I finally out did her with this one. I used 1/2 ground sirloin and 1/2 ground buffalo.

Very flavorful and the vegetables mixed in gave a good texture. I did, however, omit the Worcestershire sauce and instead of ketchup, added tomato paste. All in all, an excellent dish.

We're not ground meat lovers, but with the health crisis (!) and all, gave this one a shot. We liked it a lot, but next time, I'd cut down on the Worcestershire sauce a bit. The vegetables and the fresh bread crumbs fill out the loaf quite a bit, and made for a nice meal.

This is an excellent meatloaf which has become a regularly requested meal in my kitchen. I use 1 pound ground buffalo and 3/4 pound lean ground beef, and skip the deglazing step at the end because it seems unnecessary. I usually serve this with Rosemary-Roasted Sweet Potato Wedges and a green vegetable...yum!

Finally a tender buffalo recipe. Great flavor and so moist. Thank you for this recipe!

I am a good, Lutheran-Norwegian boy and we LOVE our meatloaf. This is absolutely wonderful! Much more flavorful than Grandma's recipe -- Sorry, Grandma! -- it has a wonderful texture and subtle flavors. I have made it with half buffalo and half beef and it's turned out great. Serve it with scalloped potatoes and green bean casserole. A new spin on a Lutheran Sunday Dinner!

I've made this recipe many times but have substituted a veal/pork/beef mixture for the buffalo meat. It's one of my husband's favorites.

I am a buffalo meat lover,so i tried this recipe to impress my dinner guests. I wanted to show them how wonderful the taste of buffalo really is. But, after following this horrible recipe perfectly, i found it digusting. Even my dog wouldn't touch it!
