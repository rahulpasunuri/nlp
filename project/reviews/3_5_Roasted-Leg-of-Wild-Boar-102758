Just made for Christmas dinner and it was fabulous. Two discussion points however: Cloves (and I do mean Syzygium aro not garlic) - next time I will reduce the number of cloves. A bit overwhelming. Temperature - I ordered my wild boar leg from Broken Arrow and as others have noted the temperatures in the recipe vary greatly from the recipe on the BA site. I went with the BA cooking recommendations. A five pound leg took about 3 hours to reach 170.

I made it for Christmas, and I have to say it's a really good recipe, but It would be better by making some changes. I had one main problem, after rubbing the leg with coarse salt and pepper, it's necessary to clean it very well before marinating with the wine, otherwise the remaining sauce after the cooked wil be really really salty. In order to solve that problem I had to mix the sauce with unsalted chicken stock in proportion of 3 parts of stock for 1 part of sauce, and then I added the jelly. I didn't use red current jelly, I couldn't find it in here (Venezuela) Instead I used almost a complete bottle of Four Fruits St. Dalfour Mermelade. Another important thing I did, was to take out the fat from the sauce after the cooked, because it had too much. Besides that I think it's a really good recipe, the pork takes a fine flavor and really soft texture. *For those who don't know, the cloves are a spice, not garlic cloves.

This was delicious, but a few modifications: 1. After the wet marinade cycle, I patted it dry then combined about 2 T of fresh thyme leaves and 8 cloves of crushed garlic. This I chopped together until it was a single mass of seasoning. I then mixed it with a fair amount of olive oil and spread it over the outside of the roast. Finally, I let it dry marinate an additional hour. 2. After the second dry marinade cycle, I browned it on both sides for about 5 minutes each. 3. I set the oven at 350, not 450, then cooked it for two hours. 4. I also used a cooking bag to help keep things moist. With these modifications, it was delicious. Tender, moist, and flavorful.

I made this for thanksgiving and it was wonderful! I substituted a black berry low-calorie / high quality Jam for the Black Currant Jelly. (The Jelly was diffulcult to find in the store) I paired this dish up with a very simply prepared baby yukon - garlic potatoes. I really loved the sauce, and ended up drizzling the meat with it.

Cloves means cloves, as in the spice. If the recipe called for garlic, it would say garlic and probably put a teaspoon amount, rather than a number of cloves, or "one clove of garlic, chopped." Cloves are a spice that you can purchase in the spice section of any grocery store. They have a pungent aroma and strong flavor. I really don't understand the confusion about this. My mom put cloves in her ham all the time and it's a staple here.

I served this for a dinner party, and we all really enjoyed it. We decided that it tasted similar to a Virginia ham, but not salted. The big question for me was how to actually cook the leg. This recipe says 450 degrees for a couple of hours, but Broken Arrow Ranch recommends cooking Boar Legs at a lower temperature. See their instrucitons at http://www.brokenarrowranch.com/consumers/consumerinfo/wholelegs.htm. So I ended up roasting mine at 425 convection for 15 minutes, then dropped it to 250 convection for 15 minutes, then switched it to 250 regular, using 160 degrees as the target temperature. I tweaked the temperature throughout to try to get the leg done close to the appointed dinner hour. Final cooking time for our 10-lb. leg was 5 hours. In order to get access to the "Chefs Section" of meats at Broken Arrow Ranch, where the whole legs are, you have to order a minimum of 20 lbs. of meat. We took the opportunity to order some venison tenderloins [they have three different types to choose from] and antelope tenderloins. Customer Service at Broken Arrow Ranch was great.

Its a pretty basic recipe for leg of Boar, I usually add some port reduction to the sauce and serve it on freshly made noodles. Save all your Boar bones and make a demi glace with them and veal if you really want an awesome sauce. Do not use canned broth or stock, puhlease. I still think there are better ways of preparing the leg, like on a spit. Such a pity that Americans don't even have a clue what this stuff is. Their loss.

I made this dish for dinner party. It was amazing. The wild boar has a flavour somewhere bettween lamb and beef. The only difference is that I used a shoulder roast rather than a leg. It is a bit fattier, but the flavour was wonderful. The cloves helped to give the meat a bit of sharpness that really enhanced the flavour. I served with the wild mushroom potatoe gratin (also from epicurious) and grilled veggies. Serve it with a big Gicondas or maybe an Aussie Shiraz.

I'm confused about why this is rated 100 percent when only two out of ten people even rated it. I'm not confused about the cloves. Obviously the recipe means the spice. If it meant garlic it would say so.

I have not made this yet, but it seems too long of a process, so I may not make it. There is also too much confusion about cloves. Personally I think both should be used, that way any confusion in the matter is taken care of.

I just read this recipe and it sounds wonderful. I haven't made it yet, but in response to the questions about cloves--I really think the recipe refers to cloves the spice, not cloves of garlic.

Guys, this says cloves. Not cloves of anything. Just cloves.

To answer the previous question: yes, cloves of garlic...just like you'd do with lamb.

I read whole cloves and NOT cloves of garlic as the review below is suggesting. Anyone?

This was really delicious! The only problem I had was when roasting the leg of boar. The marinade evaporated very fast and I had to keep adding chicken stock so the bottom of the roasting pan didn't burn. I also wouldn't stud the roast with 20 garlic cloves again. I would use half. This was better than a pork roast.
