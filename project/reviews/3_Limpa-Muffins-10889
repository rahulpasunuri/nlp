This is a delicious savoury muffin (like a wholesome biscuit)! Great with cheese, or butter. I replaced 1/2c. of the flour for whole wheat pastry flour. I would definitely make these again.

I didn't think these would rise with the rye flour but they did. I added 1/4C sugar to a half recipe. Next time I'll try brown sugar. Also I will crush the anise and caraway seeds to distribute their flavor more.
