Good marinade. On a spicy scale it was medium, but for serious spicy lovers (like my boyfriend) it wasn't spicy. I think I will add some hot sauce to the marinade next time just for him. Otherwise, it was a great dish. I will definitely use again.

Everyone adores this dish. It's my summer grilling standard. I halve the chicken crosswise so that it cooks more evenly and more quickly. Makes a nice presentation this way, too.

Very tasty and moist but nothing exceptional. No complexity of flavors. But it is quick,

I made this as chicken skewers on the grill last night and it was delicious. I cut the chicken in pieces first. I wanted a sweeter taste so added 2 Tbsp. brown sugar to the marinade. On an impulse also soaked a can of unsweetened chunk pineapple in about 1/4 c. marinade for an hour. Put that with the chicken and chunks of onion, bell pepper, etc. I will definitely marinate the pineapple again, it picked up the sweet hot flavor even more than the chicken did. Wish I'd made more!

This should not be offered as a "recipe!" It is a packaged marinade.
