I've made this pie twice now, once for Thanksgiving and once for Valentine's Day. Both times I added an additional half teaspoon of cinnamon to the crust to get more cinnamon flavor and also a generous pinch of cayenne pepper to the chocolate filling at the stage where you mix the cornstarch and the brown sugar for an extra kick. We're big fans of spicy + chocolate!

This is astounding. I would not change a thing.

This is my go-to recipe for a custard pie. Quick and great results every time. I've used a store-bought crust in a hurry.

I didn't make the filling because I was in a hurry but I used the cream recipe and it was spectacular!

yummy! not too sweet, great chocolate flavor. I can never get filling/pudding really smooth- always turns out grainy, but this is good pie and simple enough!

The pie set so well, made a good amount of filling, & had a lightness about it. I still favor my Family Circle cream pie recipe from 25 odd years ago however....it was more intense in flavor. I guess I'm just not a cinnamon/chocolate person. Also prefer a regular piecrust.

I love to make memorable desserts, and this is one of the best I've ever made. I followed the recipe exactly. It is SO important to use the high quality chocolate, because the intensity of chocolate flavor is just what you want. I used 62% "semi sweet" Scharffenberger. This is not a case when you should consider "baking chocolate" from the supermarket, or just chocolate pudding mix. Go for the real thing; it will be worth it. The cinnamon flavoring is subtle, just enough to be make the dessert special. Everyone asked for seconds, inluding picky eaters.

Made this for Christmas '08 dinner, which was a simple affair (just me and my 5-year old). It had just enough challenge to give me a sense of accomplishment and what fun to make! My pie pan was only 8" but that didn't seem to make a difference. I used the plain graham cracker crumbs I had on hand and added a half teaspoon of cinnamon to the crust -- which I couldn't really taste so next time will add a mite more. The cinnamon whipped cream is a FAB! idea. It's special and worth the calories -- will make for Thanksgiving next year.

Yes, four forks for "exceptional." I made this (and this site's Sour Cream Raisin Pie) for eight people at Thanksgiving dinner this year. Praise for both pies dominated conversation after dinner. Since this was the first time I made this pie, I followed the recipe nearly to the letter, although I found that eleven 5 x 2-1/2" cookies were more than enough; I also used an extra tblsp. of melted butter when making the crust; the chocolate filling was 65% cacao and the shavings were semisweet (62%). Nonetheless, the recipe delivered all that it promised. I'll be making it again for New Year's dinner.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner with some co-workers here in Japan. Growing up, we always had a chocolate pie of some kind at the table, and I wanted to try something new. This was an excellent choice. I used cappuccino cookies for the crust - a tasty substitute! Everyone especially loved the chocolate filling - very smooth and creamy. I agree that working with the sieve was the worst part, but worth the effort.

Yum- It is a lot of work to strain through a fine-mesh sieve but, well worth it.

I made this for an 82 year old whose favorite pie is chocolate cream pie. Fearing that the updated version would be a bit too exotic, I was proven wrong.The pie was loved and asked to be made for Thanksgiving.

This was really good. I didn't have cinnamon graham crackers, so I used regular graham crackers and added some cinnamon (maybe 1/2 teaspoon or so - was not precise at all). I accidentally used salted butter, which gave the crust an added salty flavor, although that wasn't all together unpleasant (definitely use unsalted butter or don't add salt if you use salted). I liked the cinnamon whipped cream - it's so simple and I'm surprised it didn't occur to me before.

Delicious! I added some extra spices - cinnamon and ginger in the crust, a few dashes of cayenne in the chocolate, and more cinnamon and ginger in the whipped cream - but the recipe is a definite keeper. It was a huge hit at my dinner party.

I'm new at baking and this recipe was easy to make and delicious! It took about 45 minutes of prep and turned out great (not to sweet). My dinner guests loved it.
