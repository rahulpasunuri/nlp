DELISH! Definitley worth it to splurge on a good quality beer and cheese. I used Hennepin beer and an Irish Cheddar that also had stout in it. I skipped the Worcestershire and mustard completely and also put the cooked veggies in a blender before adding the flour. YUM

I'd say this recipe, if thickened some, would serve much better as a dip. It was rather too beery for me to enjoy as a soup. I dipped my bread in it, which was pleasant, but I ended up having to throw so much of it away.

Fantastic recipe! Followed the recommendations of other reviewers: skipped the Worcestershire and mustard, and used a stick blender to puree the vegetables until nice and smooth. I also modified the recipe slightly to make it gluten free, substituting gluten free beer and cornstarch for the flour. Reminded me of this awesome beer cheese soup at a local pub in South Buffalo.

We love this in my house! I am making this again for super bowl Sunday, but as a fondue style dip. I did this before with the leftovers, just added some more flour and water to thicken. This time around I will lessen the stock and maybe up the cheese. Looking forward to making this again!

Quick, easy and delicious!

Holy cow, yum. Purists unite against me, but I also made a few changes. First, I used 4 leeks, 3 ribs of celery, a bunch of baby carrots, and probably 2-3 T of garlic so there was no exactness to be found around here, but it was around 5-6 cups of veggies total. This includes the ribs of a bunch of wilted kale I was feeling guilty about. Cooked those bad boys for about 20 minutes, pureed, added the flour (as others suggested, more like 1/2 c). It made a very disconcerting paste that looked like a colorful weird saag. Added 2 c broth, then the chopped leaves of the kale which I had earlier attempted to revive in a cold water bath. Pureed again (stick blender fun). Then in went a 16oz can of Boddington's, blend, the cheese (half mild and half sharp, then some more sharp that I found, about 20 oz total), the milk (2%, unmeasured, but probably close to the directed amount), the mustard, and eventually the bay leaf when I remembered. I apparently have something in my constitution that prevents me from believing that there really is no worcestershire in my house, so that didn't make it in. Simmered on super low, and ate the heck out of that stuff. It was a good night around here.

luv it with the pureed vegetables and extra flour. skipped the bacon just because it seems as though every thing has bacon in it.

Rating: 3
Very, very rich but good! The bacon really guilds the lily. I too whipped out my stick blender and pureed the vegetables, however this causes the carrots to turn the soup orange, so if you want to keep things a pretty white you might consider using parsnips instead.

Rating: 4
Spectacular! I sauteed the minced garlic while blending the leeks, carrots and celery, returning them to the pot before adding the flour, which I increased to 1/2 C (as others suggested)...I used imported Irish Cheddar (hardcore sharp); this soup has a stranglehod on first place in my book - it's simply the best soup I've ever tasted!

Rating: 0
Make this one over and over...serve it in individual bread bowels. Use skim milk, puree veggies after cooking before adding the cheese. Use Great Lakes Dortmunder...yummmy!! Made it for the SOUPer bowl last night!

I was hoping to replicate the Beer Cheese Soup at a local haunt(in Skagway, Alaska), and sure enough it was as good as the original. I agreed with other reviewers that some pureeing needed to happen, but I didn't want to have to do it in batches once the soup was hot. So I cooked the veggies, THEN pureed them--then transferred them back to the pan to be coated in flour, etc, etc. I recommend using Corona beer instead of a traditional Ale. A girlfriend had tried to make this soup a few times and had said the corona was best, and it was perfect tasting. Plus, five bottles of corona left-over? Win.

Rating: 4
Holy cow, this was good! Like other reviewers, I pureed the vegetables after cooking, and I cooked them until they were soft and mushy. I didn't have any Cheddar cheese, so I used old Gouda cheese-FABULOUS!

Rating: 3
Really nice soup. I followed the advice of increasing length of time for cooking veggies, adding more flour, and using less worcestershire. I used Newcastle for the beer, although next time I make this, I'm going to dry a cheddar that isn't *quite* as sharp as this calls for.

Rating: 4
I have been on a quest to find the perfect cheddar-ale soup, and this (with the mods suggested by others) is it! As per some of the other reviews, I simmered the veggies for 15 minutes instead of 5, I pureed the veggies before proceeding to the next step, I used 1/2 C flour instead of 1/3 C, and I used 1/2 T worcestershire sauce instead of 1 T. PERFECTION. (I used Bass Ale and a basic extra sharp cheddar).

Rating: 4
Great cheese soup! I took the advice of others and used a 1/2 of cup flour instead of 1/3, making it thicker and cut the Worcestershire sauce in half. I also blended the ingredients to make it creamer and added broccoli after the cheese. A teaspoon of red pepper really gave it a kick as well!

Rating: 3
Good basic recipe, you can make it your own. Very tasty.

Rating: 4
Very good for such an easy soup. Not having leaks handy, I used green onion - and used the entire green onion. If you like a thick soup - use more flour/less chicken stock to thicken. I also opted for no bacon.

A tip I've used twice with this soup: simmer the vegetables for 15 minutes, not five, and cover them with a buttered round of parchment paper while simmering. No gritty taste, and they puree into a silky smooth texture in the blender.

Had a wonderful smooth and rich cheddar beer soup at a restaurant last fall and was hoping to duplicate it. This recipe disappointed. It was too thin and even pureeing the cooked veggies didn't help the texture. The overall flavor was fine, but there's way too much liquid.

Rating: 3
I made this soup and chose to puree it. We thought it was a really good, solid cheddar beer soup and will make it again. Make sure that you use good quality beer because that will make or break this soup.

We really enjoy this recipe on cold nights in MN. It easy very easy and quick to make and goes well with day old french, or any crusty (a al "Breads form the La Brea Bakery), bread. The first time I made it I used very good cheese and followed the recipe. Last night I only had good, production, extra sharp cheddar, white onion and ham. It turned out just as good. The Bass or any other sharp ale makes up for using cheaper cheese. I agree with a previous review: the worcestershire is too much. It adds a good flavor component but I will half it next time (more can be added if preferred at the table). I have had thicker beer cheese soups, but found this one just fine with 16 oz of beer, perfect for dunking a slice of bread. I have considered blanched broccoli to counter balance the nutritional value, but had none last night.

This was an awesome recipe. What a great soup on a cold winter's eve. I will make this again.

I added some potatos to this to make it a bit heartier... I also thickened it up with some corn starch. Smithwick's Irish Ale worked great. It was delicious and there are many servings left over!

Rating: 3
Next time I'll greatly decrease or omit the worcester sauce, because that flavor seems to have overwhelmed the soup. This definitely CAN be both frozen and reheated. I didn't like it too much at first, because I thought the flavor was much too sour and sharp. I froze it and reheated in a pan on low and it was much mellower and more subtle. It also benefits from the addition of hot sauce or ground cayenne.

Rating: 4
I blended the soup for the first time and loved it. I think it made it much more creamy feeling, and intend to continue making it that way.

Rating: 4
Extremely easy to prepare and hearty enough to stand on its own as a meal. I used a wand blender after removing the bay leaves to make a creamy-textured soup. I will definitely be saving this one to make again on a cold Winter night.

Rating: 3
I read the reviews before making, so I followed others' suggestions. I added some cauliflower and put all in a blender before finishing. I used Sam Adams Irish Red beer. Delicioius! However, I'm back on website now to see if there is any mention about freezing it. This recipe makes more than we need at the moment... SO, good for having guests!

Before adding the cheddar cheese to this recipe I tasted it and, although I liked the flavor of the broth, found the texture of the diced vegetables off putting. I put the soup through a blender in batches to make it smoother, but the grittiness persisted, so I forced it through a sieve, then added the cheese, as directed. The results was a delicious, velvety smooth cheddar bisque which I will certainly make again. :

Very good. Made a few changes... used Becel, vegetable broth and a Corona beer (it was what I had). Forgot the worcestershire sauce! But was still excellent. I did puree the soup though for a little smoother consistency. Will definitely make again.

Very good! I used Becel instead of butter, vegetable broth, omitted the bacon and used a Corona beer as that was what I had on hand and forgot to add the worcestershire sauce but it was still delicious. Will definitely make again.

So good, but since I am a vegetarian I had to make a few changes.I did not add bacon and used veggie broth instead of chicken. I also used a honey lager (what I had on hand). Everyone thought it was amazing

Rating: 3
This was quite a tasty soup. It was also pretty quick to make (about an hour). The only thing I'll do differently next time is puree the vegetables. They didn't feel right all lumpy. (I hail from the land of cheddar-beer soup--Wisconsin--and I've never had it lumpy anywhere). One thing I really liked was the Bass ale. It was really hearty and totally made the soup.

Had some leftover cheese from a wedding so thought I'd try this. Everyone loved it but the veggies took much longer to cook although I had used a cuisinart to dice them. Agree with those who suggest blending the veggies to make a soother soup. I'm still looking for the ideal cheese & beer recipe tho.

Used onions instead of leeks and garnished with Snyder's Pretzel Nibblers. Super Good . Had no problems reheating.

Loved! Will add more veggies next time and a bit more chicken broth, as this was a bit thick. Loved it!!!

Another reviewer said this didn't reheat well?? Mine did wonderfully! I used Redhook Blonde Ale. Finished with some fresh cracked pepper before serving.

Rating: 3
This is delicious! I noticed that some people were saying the vegetables were taking longer to cook than 5 minutes. Perhaps that's due to not having done a 1/4-inch dice? Mine were soft by about six minutes. Also, I used two teaspoons of dijon mustard rather than the dry mustard, which was fine. Next time I would make a separate roux to thicken the soup somewhat more (though I used 2% milk which may have caused the soup to be thinner than with whole milk).

Rating: 4
This was excellent! I made it with Guinness, extra, extra, extra old cheddar cheese and 2% milk. The perfect meal for a dreary, rainy night.

made this for a football party. Many compliments. We made just enough, since the reviews said reheating wasn't a great idea.

Very good flavor, but the leeks still had an unpleasant squeaky texture. I pureed the soup and that helped a lot. Very tasty!

I finally made it for my wedding shower and every single person that tried it absolutely loved it! I made a triple batch for 28 people and there was barely 2 cups left. I had several requests for the recipe and thought it was easy to make for a crowd. I did the same thing as last time (using extra sharp cheddar and Bass beer) and it was another great success! I am seriously making it tonight again because we have lots of leftover cheese and beer and of course, all the requests!

Rating: 4
I followed the recipe exactly except for cooking the veggies longer and blending it at the end and it was delicious! We made it just for two of us so there was a lot leftover (and it reheated very nicely, that might depend on the kind of cheese?) but the leftovers didn't last for more than 24 hours. My boyfriend raved about it and we absolutely loved it! I'm already planning on making it for a wedding shower I'm having in a few weeks, it's that good!

As I was tasting during the cooking process, it was turning out pretty darn good before I added beer. (I used one of my favorite microbrews, Mirror Pond Ale from Deschutes Brewery.) And the vegetables definitely needed more than 5 minutes of cooking time.

Rating: 4
Don't make too much to eat in the first sitting -- this is one soup that doesn't take well to reheating.

Even better with a malty brown ale, like Newcastle. For fun, make croutons out of big chewy pretzels to top it with.

Very good, just increase the vegetable cooking time by 5 minutes.

I made this recipe exactly as stated but it got far from rave reviews. My husband thought it was "good" but I thought it was only "okay" at best. My problem with the soup was the overwhelming flavor of the dry mustard - it was simply too harsh for me. If I make this again I'll definitely drastically reduce the mustard or omit it altogether.

Rating: 4
If you use a really good cheese (we used a $16/lb. Vermont cheddar), it will complement the bitterness of the beer (we used Bass as suggested). So, it may be a little pricey, but good ingredients result in good tasting food.

This soup benefits by being pureed to a velvety texture before serving.

It was just ok, husband said I've made better. Couldn't find Bass Ale so I used Boddingtons Pub Ale, unsure if this lead to the demised of the recipe.

This is a decent recipe. I would recommend that anytime a recipe calls for beer that you use a malty, low bitter beer. The english ales tend to be fairly bitter. I would recommend a german maibock for this recipe. IF you must have an ale use a blonde ale instead of the ESB or bitter.

Great loved the robust flavor. Everyone enjoyed.
