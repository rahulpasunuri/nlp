We liked these a lot. They were certainly easy and fast enough to make, and we thought they tasted great. Only problem: They stuck to the pan which made turning them difficult. I didn't oil the pan because I thought the potato coating would suffice, but for me it didn't. Future readers: did you have this problem and if not, what did you do to prevent sticking?

Tried with sweet potato, sour cream, and cumin instead. Delicious and so easy!

I agree with the "easy and yummy"! I'm not sure I like it with glazed salmon, though. I'd prefer it with some kind of Mexican meat dish. Also, I had to roast the potatoes for somewhat more than 15 mins. Finally, I've learned to always replace mayo with sour cream in recipes like this, and was glad I did so.

I wouldn't make this again without seriously adjusting the flavor! I was not too impressed- but I know I am a harsh critic! It wasn't as flavorful as I had hoped for!

Wonderful! Try it with the Glazed Grilled Salmon recipe, which got almost three pages of favorable reviews here. A great match.
