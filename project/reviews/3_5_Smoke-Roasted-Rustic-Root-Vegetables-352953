I use three colors of potatoes and added turnip,onion,galic and parsnips. I think next time I will try adding radishes.I have done this in the oven minus the smoke. Broil until browned toss broil some more turn heat to 400 until tender

Delish! Added some fresh thyme and a dash of sherry vinegar at the end which really woke up the smokey/sweetness.

We used sweet potatoes, white potatoes, and carrots we had gotten from our CSA. Everyone loved it! The smokey flavor was fabulous.
