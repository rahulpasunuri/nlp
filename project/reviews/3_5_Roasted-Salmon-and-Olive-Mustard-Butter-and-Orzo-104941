I absolutely love this recipe! This is a very easy recipe to make. The butter mixture lasts a long time in the refrigerator so if you have left over butter, you can use it weeks later to make this salmon again.

Ok..ok...I always grippe about people changing up recipes and making something totally off the wall and then critizing....I did change two things here but I'm not to critize. I discovered a lack of black olives in my kitchen so had to opt for a brined stuffed green olive and I added about five more than the recipe specified AND I had a left over fillet of bbq'd salmon from the night before. So I used the green olives in the butter and instead of a roasted salmon fillet I used left over salmon. I warmed up the salmon in the hot saucepan with the butter after removing the pasta. I was VERY pleased with the results of this meal. My three little guys devoured it and my husband was very impressed as well with this "leftover" meal. You know, you could even use (eeek) a can or two of salmon in this way instead of fresh which would result in a quick and inexpensive weekday meal.

I honestly wish I could give this recipe zero forks. I am an olive and salmon freak, and this recipe was truly disgusting. There was almost no flavor once the butter was mixed with the orzo, and the orzo was not only bland but greasy and an odd, unappealing purple color. All I got was a faint taste of shallot and a really unpleasant aftertaste. We threw the whole thing out and had frozen tacos for dinner, which sadly were a world of improvement over this disaster of a recipe.

This is so delicious. I have served it three times next to a salmon with a dill-lemon sauce and this is the one that is gone at end of the dinner. I top the sauce on a large fillet before it goes into the oven so the flavors get into the fish during baking and the sauce is hot. Yummy!

This recipe got my sons to eat salmon - now it is one of their frequent requests. It is quick, easy and all the prep can be done in advance. I use only half the butter called for and save the rest for tossing over veggies or other grilled meats. And, I usually increase the mustard while reducing the number of olives and use only half the amount of shallots.

I think there's more exciting ways of preparing salmon. It was a lot of butter, for my tastes, but my boyfriend loved it. I wouldn't make it again, because the orzo is an unfamiliar type of pasta for both me and my boyfriend. Fine to eat one night, but I'd rather experiment with something else the next time I prepare salmon.

Was looking for easy recipes for a fishing trip. I bought Tasso's Bruschetta spread (in the olive aisle) and used it instead of the kalamata olives. Since the spread has kalamatas and other good things ($7.49 a jar), the pasta was great and quick. Tasso also makes a Mediterranean spread that has green olives and sun-dried tomatoes. Grilled the salmon on a Le Creuset stove top grill. Presentation was very good.

This meal was not only delicious; it was very easy and considerably quick. I believe from start to finish it took about 45 minutes!

I'm so disappointed! I was really excited to make this recipe after reading all of the positive reviews. I was excited to have such an easy, prep ahead company meal. To my dismay, the shallots overpowered the olive butter on the salmon, and I found the orzo pretty tasteless and just oily. I might try it again, using sundried tomatoes instead of (or in addition to)olives, as one reviewer suggested, to see if that improves the flavor, and would use less chopped shallot, or maybe even roasted garlic instead. The company I had over said they liked it, but I wondered if they were just being polite since I was so underwhelmed.

Loved this recipe! The butter is wonderful, and coats the orzo beautifully. I am making it for Christmas Eve dinner. Both the salmon and the pasta went over great with my kids.

I made this several times and love it! I substitute the olives with sundried tomatoes. Also, trout or arctic char go well with the orzo.

I just made the orzo--without the olives--to accompany another dish, and my wife loved it! This simple orzo recipe will become a pasta staple.

I have now made this recipe twice. I suggest making the butter as instructed but rubbing half of it over the salmon before cooking at a temperature of 450. The other half can be used with the orzo, but if you're looking for a great orzo recipe, I recommend the orzo with red wine mushroom sauce (on this site). This dish is better paired with a salad with feta and pine nuts. The salmon is really very good if you cook with the olive butter on; the butter forms a dark topping, quite tasty and complementary to the fish. Garnish with parsley.

I MIGHT TRY THIS AGAIN. THE ORZO LOOKED DIRTY WITH THE DARK OLIVES IN IT.THE BUTTER MIX WOULD MAYBE BE BETTER SERVED ON SOME GOOD TOASTED FRENCH BREAD.

Rating: 3
OK, I made this dish again and have upgraded my rating. It was MUCH better! I did not season the butter mixture (it was salty last time) -- that was perfect for the salmon which I did season but not so for the orzo (I guess I didn't salt the water enough.) I prefer my salmon to be crispier on the outside, so in addition to brushing with olive oil, I sprinkled cayenne and roasted it at 450 for 15 mins, turning once. The mixture stood up VERY NICELY to the touch of crispiness, and the hint of cayenne brought out the flavors even more! A keeper!

I've made this several times for guests. It always gets rave reviews, even from the harshest critics. Even the kids love it! Don't change a thing, it's great the way it is! An absolute favorite!

Made this for some friends last night. Salmon's always risky since not everyone likes it but 7 of the 8 cleaned their plate and the dish got rave reviews. I did not change the recipe at all and do not intend to alter in the future. It did take my salmon 30 minutes to cook completely but the fillets were very thick in the center. Easy to prepare for company and, we thought, very good--we'll have it again!

Fantastic! Even my "picky eater" friends who don't like olives liked it.

I used about half as much butter and added half a lemon's juice to compensate. I also used left-over roasted salmon and a TB of prepared tapenade instead of slicing up the Kalamata olives fresh, and it was just great. It was an excellent way to dress up some plain leftover fish and with the tapenade cheat, super fast. Would definitely make this again.

It doesn't knock your socks off, but it's fast and tasty--a great week night dinner.

Superb!! I only used about 2/3 of the olive mustard butter for the orzo and salmon. Otherwise, it would have been too greasy.

Rating: 2
If I do make this dish again, I'll definitely make some alterations. To my taste, the sauce is too weak tasting once it's diluted by all that orzo (and I only used 1 lb of orzo) and it's too greasy. I'll try substituting a fair amount of chicken broth for half of the butter, I'll add a few more olives, more dijon and I'm thinking about some reduced balsamic vinegar. Despite all of my complaints, there is something intriguing about the taste combination that merits some experimentation.

very good and easy

I added the butter to the salmon to baste during cooking...which helped the flavor. The salmon was moist, but still a little bland, so I would recommend marinating in lemon juice, salt & pepper for 30 mins before roasting. The orzo was delicious w/the olive-mustard butter. I would definitely try this again, perhaps with a spicier brown mustard.

I LOVED this recipe!!! I used a bit more wine and butter for a smoother sauce, but this was a total hit. I will add this to my dishes I serve guests-a lot of flavor.

Very good. My only suggestion is that I used some of the kalamata butter mixture on top of the salmon while roasting...I think it imparted more flavor. It's an simple recipe that amazingly changes the taste of roasted salmon.

I really loved this recipe. The olive butter was so easy to make and gave salmon a new twist. The flavor of the Dijon and Kalamata olives was a great combination with the sweetness of salmon!

Rating: 3
In addition to being delicious, this dish was absolutely one of the easiest things I've ever made - not something I thought I'd ever say about fish! Next time I might add a leeeetle more mustard, or perhaps more olives, to give the sauce more bite.

I liked this recipe and would try it again. The Salmon was great and I liked the orzo with it. I wasn't thrilled with the olive-butter, which surprised me. I think that possibly I would have realized more of a full flavor from the butter if I had either made it ahead or let it stand longer at room temperature. It was a nice and satisfying dish.

Rating: 3
Despite some initial reluctance on the part of my family, they ended up loving this dish. I served it with a fresh green salad and some garlic foccacia for a well rounded meal. The flavor was subtle and unexpected but quite delicious, and the orzo was a nice change from the rice which I usually serve with fish. This dish is unique enough and simple enough that I will probably even make it for company.K

The mustard butter with the olives in it was interesting, and I am going to try that on some pieces of french bread that I will either bake or broil in the oven for an appetizer. Otherwise, I didn't particularly care for this recipe -- as much as I liked the butter, it just did not make the salmon very "jazzy."

I substituted roasted garlic cloves for the shallot and grilled the salmon instead of roasting. We had rice rather than orzo. It was great! I ended up with leftover olive-mustard butter; loking forward to a repeat performance later this week.

This recipe was incredibly easy and very good. Nice and light, but not anything absolutely amazing. The olive butter, however, was a delicious addition to otherwise boring orzo. It also helped the salmon out a lot. I don't know about the rest of it, but I'll definitely be using that butter again.

My favorite new way to prepare salmon! The olive-butter prep is easy enough for a week night dinner, and loved the flavor combo with both the fish and orzo. Used leftover butter the next day on fresh steamed asparagus, and it was good on that too!

I really liked this recipe alot. My salmon fillets were slightly thicker, but they cooked to perfection in 14 minutes. I thought the olive-mustard butter worked great on the salmon and with the orzo. I used slightly less of the butter on the salmon and slightly more on the orzo. I plan on trying different variation replacing the olives with herbs. This one is a keeper.

This was really tasty. The butter could have overpowered the taste of the salmon, so we didn't use as much as it called for. I really liked the orzo, it was simple but more fun than rice. The leftover butter was great on our side of bread!

The butter on the salmon was terrific, but the orzo as a side dish was lackluster. I'd make the butter and fish again, but would choose a different side.

This butter is great on the Salmon. This is one I will make in the future. I've already sent it to 2 friends. I don't like orzo much, so I didn't make that. Served with polenta and roasted vegetables. Would also be good with any grilled fish. This is a keeper.

This was very easy to prepare and the presentation very nice. However, we felt the sauce was entirely too salty because of all the olives; I did cut down the amt suggested, but still to salty. The orzo was a delicious accompliment. The lemon chive vinagrette was a bit to sharp in contrast with the olives. I have used this vinagrette before and we did like it.

What a wonderful way to inaugurate the new subscription. Everything was surprisingly easy to make and my wife still talks about how good it was (possibly the best meal I have ever prepared). I did substitue rice for orzo (couldn't find it) and used a different mustard from Trader Joes, Aiola Garlic Mustard. I look forward to making it again.
