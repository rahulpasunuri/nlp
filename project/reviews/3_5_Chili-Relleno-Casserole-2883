I make this with poblanos then serve with enchilada sauce, delicous.

after reading all the reviews and evaluating the recipe, I would like to add to the concept of the recipe. I make it with slices of bread, eggs, milk and cheese and chilis and prepare the layers the night before and bake in the morning for a brunch. It has never failed me once and is a hit with everyone. Also do not use a lot of cheese, just enough for flavor and can use pepper jack for more heat.

OMG - EIGHT cups of cheese? I can feel my arteries slamming shut just reading this recipe! And I'm from Wisconsin!

We made this for our weekend halloween party and everyone loved it. We made some minor adjustments thanks to everyones reviews. We used roasted poblano chiles, jalapenos and fresh tomatoes lyered with the cheese. The egg mixture held well however next time I think ill add some puff pastery to make it a bit more fluffy. All in all it was yummy, spicy, cheesey easy to make and it made enough for seconds. : )

This was good. I felt the amounts were way off. 8 cups of cheese? I used about half as much and it was plenty cheesey. I only had hot pickled jalapeños, so I diced some green bell peppers and mixed them half/half with the hot peppers. It was quite hot, just how we like it.

I have never made this exact recipe, but at first glance I would just look at this as a REALLY basic starting point. You can layer anything you want with chilis and cheese and cover it in a seasoned egg mixture and come out with a pretty good dish. I have never used that much milk in something like this, though. Does it come out more like a custard than egg dish?

Tried this for friends and it was terrific. You might want to adjust the whole green chili cans. Figure 1.5 cans per layer. I followed the recipe, but it implies about 3 layers. That should have been more like 5 cans @ 7 oz. Not too spicy so if you want it so, add some diced jalapeno to your testes. Friends demanded copy of recipe too.

Made this for a dinner party of 8... everyone loved it. Very simple to prep ahead and bake before serving. Holds well too. I did 1 large can of chopped green chilies and half a jar of sliced jalapeno peppers that I rough chopped for added heat. I also used a 3 cup bag of a Mexi blend shredded cheese and about 2 1/2 cups of a sharp grated cheddar. This was served with a Chipolte-Marinated Pork Tenderloin with Black Bean Salsa.

I modified this recipe a bit & it was a big hit in our home! I used 6 Poblano Peppers steamed & cut up, I also used 2 eggs instead. Ground Chuck(browned in spices & well drained maybe even rinsed) can be used aswell as Fajita or pulled apart beef or pork that is fully cooked. I also used Queso Fresco (Fresh Cheese)instead of Cheddar for less fat, It is DEVINE!!!

Made the unusual decision (for me) to start by making the reworked version, posted by cwood17, rather than the original. I tried the 9x13 version, using cwood17's suggestion of doubling everything. Worked perfectly! The only comment I have is that the egg/spice mixture should continue to be mixed while you pour it over the casserole. I didn't and had a pile of pepper and spices poured out on top. Whoops. But after spreading the spices out over the top, it turned out fine. I'll try it next time with shrimp or chorizo added as a layer. Also, I used freshly roasted Anaheim (10) and Poblano (6) peppers, not canned. Using the quantities outlines by cwood17, I ended up with 4 layers.

Rating: 4
This is so, so easy and really delicious. But- holy cow- does it ever call for a lot of cheese! I whipped 8 eggs, 1 cup of milk and 2 tbsp flour in a blender. Layered chilies, then a mix of sauteed sausage/onion, then tortilla strips, then cheese, then repeat twice. I actually only used 2 cups of cheese for an 8x12 pan it it really was delicious (neither dry, nor swimming in oil- as I would imagine it would be with 8 cups of cheese!).

Thanks all for the kind responses over the years, on my adaptation of this recipe! Had not checked in on it for a while, wow! And Yes, the possibilities remain endless on this one. I have added so many things and nothing fails. For potato lovers, try cooked (or frozen) hash browns on the bottom & be sure to grease or butter pan. Any cooked meat or shrimp (YUM) or chorizo or machaca works well. Try roasting poblanos, stuffing with cheese ( Mexican queso or Monterey jack, hot pepper, asiago) and cooked or grilled shrimp, layering on bottom and pouring the milk/egg mixture with favorite spices (s & p, cumin, red pepper flakes, cilantro) over top and finishing with a layer of favorite cheese. Can also put a layer of thinly sliced tomatoes under top layer of cheese for color and a little flavor. I also often will put leftover tamales (or enchiladas, taquitos) on the bottom for a whole new direction from rellenos. Cheese in, stuffed in roasted whole peppers, or sprinkled on top- does not matter! the green chilis any way you like 'em. A little enchilada sauce can be added to top as one reviewer noted and cilantro, onions, mushrooms are also always good for variety. The key is 7-8 eggs whisked with 1/2 cup of milk or cream poured over to get the puffy stand alone 8x8 or 9x9 dish depending on volume of other ingredients. Double for the 9x13 pan. No need for flour either in this version. Continue to ENJOY!

Wonderful -- first made it for a vegetarian guest but EVERYONE raved about it so much, I've fixed it several times since. Exceptionally easy, exceptionally good. The only problem I've encountered is that I can't always find whole chilies. Diced ones work fine, you just have to drain them well.

Alright, I took the advice of another reviewer and followed the recipe proposed by cwood17. This version includes adding more egg as well as some other fun additions like corn torilla strips and cayenne pepper. Used mostly pepper jack with some sharp cheddar. I have to say WOW knock-your-socks- off delish! Made in a 9x9, roasted pasilla peppers - kind of a pain... (also used canned to see what i preferred) and the dish came out great. I think if you are short on time the canned peppers are great. The fresh roasted peppers are tasty too and add more vibrant color to the dish. Served with mexican rice, guac and salsa. Hard to mess this one up ya'll. What a treat. Boyfriend devoured. And that's the true test I suppose!!

Very tasty! I used fresh Anaheim chiles and queso fresco, added diced onions, cumin and garlic to the egg mixture. Served with green salsa, sour cream and warmed tortillas. It was quick and easy to prepare, and a flavorful brunch dish. I may put the tortillas in strips inside casserole next time to soak up some of the juice.

We used 6 eggs, 3/4 cup milk, and added 1 tsp cumin to the egg mixture. We also added 2 cloves garlic and 1/2 a white onion sauted and added to egg mixture. We layered the chilis and cheese with 8 warmed tortillas cut into strips. We used 4 cans chilis stuffed with cotija cheese. We cut back on the shredded chesse to 3/4 lb jack. 3/4 lb sharp cheddar. Then we poured 1 can of hot mexican tomato sauce on top.

Easy and delicious. I used 4 fresh chillies, 1/4 cup shredded cheese w some poblano to stuff each, served w fresh cooked pinto beans and salad. Next time I will add fresh cilantro, salsa, sour cream, guacamole and grilled corn on the side, a crust of corn tortilla, increase eggs to 6 and chillies to 8

Rating: 4
I've made this several times for different groups and they all rave about it. I also agree with the others about the proportions. I do 6 eggs, 1 cup of milk, about 8 poblanos, 4 cups total for the cheeses. I also add a creamy chipotle sauce that I add after the casserole comes out of the oven. The sauce is a couple of chipotle peppers from a can (depending on how spicy you want it), 1/2 cup mayo (I use garlic herb mayo), and some whipping cream and cayenne pepper. Mix it up in a blender and it's ready to go.

Rating: 3
An absolute staple in my house. I agree with others, the proportions are off in the recipe. The last time I made it I used 6 eggs, and decreased the milk and cheese by half. I then used a 9X9 glass baking dish. It's a great vegetarian dish. I always serve it with salsa and sour cream.

This is a great basic recipe. I add 1 cup sauteed onions, garlic and cumin; increase eggs to 6; reduce cheese to 6 cups; with layers of chilies add layers of strips of fresh corn tortillas; top with tomato salsa. Bake as usual. This is a favorite of my 36 year-old son and he will eat half of the dish if we let him.

Delicious. Wanted a more substantial dish for guests without all the fat from the cheese, so used 6 eggs and only 2 cups of cheese. Although I'll admit it could have been cheesier. Used five fresh pasilla peppers which I roasted over the gas flame, sweated in a paper bag, peeled, and seeded. Served with red enchilada sauce and plain greek yogurt.

So easy and got rave reviews at this morning's office potluck brunch for 12! Increased eggs to six and used four 4-oz cans of well-drained green chiles. Threw in 1 tsp of cayenne pepper for some heat and used just one pound of cheeses - mexican blend and sharp cheddar. It's so easy, the options are endless! Am sending link to co-workers now.

I loved this recipe. After reading other reviews I altered it slightly. I used 8 eggs instead of 4, 1 large can of chilies (27 ounce) and a little cream cheese in each chili. It filled the 13x9 pan perfectly and fed all five of us with a green salad on the side with zero leftovers. I usually make Rellenos only a couple times of year because it is time consuming, my husband loved this as much as the original prepared one at a time. This is a keeper.

Rating: 3
Like many other reviewers, I used fresh anaheim chilis. I bought 8, but it wasn't enough to cover baking dish completely...I'll buy more next time. Taking lead of other reviewers, I made up for lack of peppers by adding tortilla strips. I also added two chopped poblanos to add some heat. If you like cilantro, it would be a great addition. Also, I made dish in 9 X 9 pan, used only 3 eggs, 1 cup milk, and only 3/4 pound of monterey jack cheese.

Rating: 3
A great recipe to use if you want to avoid the mess-making that real chile rellenos entail. I reduced the cheese (using a 1 lb block of colby jack), reduced the milk (to 1 cup), and added an extra layer of chile. I used fresh roasted chile--can't stand the canned stuff--but then again, fresh chile is easy to come by in southern NM. Served with a side of spanish rice (2C rice, toasted, cooked in 1C tomato sauce, 3C water, 1/3 onion, and 2 cloves garlic until liquid is absorbed; salt to taste), this is a wonderful meal.

Perfect dish to make ahead for house guests. Jazz it up by topping with chipotle sauce before baking.

This has become our standard fare for a potluck. I bring a stack of copies of the recipe with me because people are always asking for it. More chilies and a little less cheese works fine. I'm considering using some cumin next time.

After reading reviews, I made this with 6 eggs, only 3/4 cup of milk, and just two cups of cheese. I grilled, skinned and removed seeds of 4 Poblano chilis. I mixed the first 4 ingredients and they had time to sit while grilling. Did put tortilla strips on bottom of buttered glass dish (an 8-inch square). A perfect fit. As it turned out... great! It puffed up nicely. Later, settled to on inch or so. Only had enough to do one layer of everything, but was okay (am on diet!). Next time I would use another egg and do a cup of milk and would add cumin and onion powder (did NOT need more heat for this Yankee). Pan size would definitely have to increase to 9x9 then. Good luck!

This recipe is a favorite at our house. One thing that I do differently is I whisk the egg mixture in a blender. This creates an even puffier casserole and a lighter texture. We top ours with a little enchilada sauce. Delicious!

Rating: 3
I made it the first time and it was too runny (by adding the milk and not separating the eggs). So I made it this time by using no milk or flour and just separated the yolks from the whites whipping the egg whites to peaks (just like in an original recipe), and mixing the yolks seperate. Pouring the yolk mixture first and spreading the whites on top, baked it till it was a light golden brown. People at my husband's work raved so much about it when they had their potluck!

Thanks to Cwood17 from Chandler, AZ for the modified recipe. The only changes that I made to his/her recipe was I added a layer of left over beef brisket in the mix and poured one can of red enchilada sauce over the top and it was incredible. I even surprised myself. My boyfriend was mmmm'ing the whole time we ate it. Served with spanish rice and fresh guac, sour cream, and salsa fresca. AWESOME!

this was great egg dish with a few modifications! i added 2 more eggs (how can 4 eggs serve 8?),some corn tortillas that i had dipped in chili verde sauce at the bottom to make a crust,a fresh diced poblano chili for extra heat and cut WAY back on the cheese. wonderful and easy to take this dish to a party with some pico de gallo on the side.

This was very good and very easy. I used half the cheese as another reviewer suggested, and it was the perfect amount. And there was enough left over for two lunches -it was just as delicious today as last night! Oh, and I baked in a 9x9 glass baking dish and got great results.

I made this dish with fresh poblano peppers from our garden that I had grilled,peeled and seeded. I was going to make chiles relleno-the traditional way which is very time consuming and messy.

The ratio of milk to eggs is not right and the reason for not setting up. The 13X9 size of pan is wrong also with 4 eggs. Heres what I do: In a 9X9 buttered pan I alternate layers of green chile strips(3 7 oz cans), torn strips of corn tortillas( about 4 or 5), grated cheese (1 pound) & optional sliced tomatoes or tomatillos. I then mix 8 eggs, 1/2 cup milk, 1/2 tsp each salt, pepper,cumin, garlic powder, & onion powder. Add choice amounts of cayenne or red pepper for high heat lovers. Pour over top, sprinkle with paprika and bake at 350 for 40 minutes until top is brown and it is tall and puffy. Let stand 10 minutes before cutting. Servies 6 -8. Using a 9X13 pan would require doubling all, extending cook time to 50 or 60 minutes & would serve 15 or 16. It can be made a day ahead and refrigerated before baking. Serve with sour cream, guacamole and salsa if desired but stands alone quite well. Travels well and holds up to re-heating left-overs the next day or two. Have extra recipe cards ready when they ask!

This did not set up. We served it more like dip with chips and that worked well. Would not serve as an entre.

My husband was in the mood to go through the trouble of grilling anaheim chiles. We used those, 1/2 the cheese and added a couple of layers of tomatillo salsa. The tomatillo gave it a great tanginess. the only minor draw back was that the salsa made it a bit wet. Next time, we think we're going to try using corn tortillas as a crust.

Good and easy, easy, easy. I added 1/2 can of tomato sauce combined with a can of Rotel tomatoes and poured that over the top, an addition I think makes it far more edible. Also, half of the cheese called for is plenty.

I separated the eggs, beated yolks with milk, whipped the whites, and then folded them together. I also added well-drained salsa (abt 1/2 cup) to the yolk mixture before folding with whites. Instead of splitting open the peppers, I stuffed monterey jack slices. I added soyrizo (vegetarian chorizo). Made it for a potluck party, it received rave reviews and was immediately gone.

I have made many variations on this dish. As I like hot food, I most commonly use pepper jack cheese which I stuff into each chile instead of slitting it open. I use the cheddar on top of the custard mixture and serve with sliced jalapinos and salsa or a mole sauce.

I followed this recipe to the letter and yet something went terribly wrong. Being that I have never had such a disaster happen with any other recipe I am at a loss for what could have happened. The dish cooked for 45 min at 350 and had a beautiful golden brown crust. I shook it and it seemed set, I let it rest and then cut it to find a large soupy puddle/mess underneath. My family could see my disappointment and they ate it anyway. I accompanied the dish with sides of spanish rice and beans.

After reading some other reviews, I just went ahead and made some adjustments, though I had not made the dish before.

We'll definitely be making this again.

Being an ex-pat from America I used only two cans of green chilies because they are as hard as hens teeth to come across. I also used mozzarella because we don't have jack cheese here. I took the advice of another reviewer and put a bottle of red salsa on the top and cooked it as directed. This is a recipe you can experiment with and make to your own taste. Great as a side dish and even better the next day!

I thought this was a great recipe but, yes, I did change it. I'm one of those cooks who appreciate the ratings even with the changes. I sauted one yellow onion, 3 smallish, sweeter red peppers (looked liked pimentos but they weren't) I got from the Farmer's Market, along with half a small orange pepper (not harbanero but within that spice range). I added that (cooled) to the egg yolks. I beat my egg whites then folded them in along with whole milk. I used half the cheese--jalepeno jack and cheddar (was going to use pepper chedder but that little yellow pepper had quite the kick). I also roasted four aneheim-looking peppers (I realize I don't remeber any of the pepper's names but the seller sure had a wonderful assortment!)under the broiler, then bagged and peeled. I put the peppers on the bottom, then some cheese, then egg mix., then more cheese. I served Hatch green enchalada sauce on the side along with sour cream. Refried beans and steamed swiss chard rounded out the meal. This served my husband and me for dinner and leftovers for lunch, and I'm not a HUGE eater. YUMMY!!!

Rating: 4
A winner for brunch. Use 1/2 the cheese the recipe calls for and you'll have plenty. It's not at all spicy, so you might want to add a bit of cayenne pepper to heat it up a bit. Serve with salsa and sour cream on the side and warm tortillas.

Loved the recipe. I read the reviews before I made it, and most everyone said it was too bland or they used less cheese. I used a little less cheese and added 1/4 tsp. of chili powder to the egg mixture for a little more flavor. I am making this for the 2nd time tonight!

I've been making chili relleno casserole for years - always a hit. However, this recipe seems to be missing an important ingredient. Top the layers of chilis, cheese and egg with 1-1/2 cup tomato sauce (or Mexican red sauce) and sprinkle with cheese before popping into the oven.

Delicious. Like other reviewers I cut the amount of cheese approx in half, but kept the number of eggs at 4. I minced a fresh jalapeno and mixed it with the cheese. I served it with heated El Pato brand red sauce (the sauce recipe submitted by another reviewer sounded delicious, but I was too lazy to make it). The El Pato is the best canned brand in my opinion. I got turned on to it by my Mexican friends.

This is a super quick recipe to throw together. I've made it 4 times and it always gets rave reviews. I assemble everything the night or morning before then pop it in the oven an hour before dinner is served.

Well this dish is good, not great, but good. If I make this again I will make it for a brunch, never again for dinner. I think its to much like an omelette than anything else. I did take the advice of others and cut the cheese more than half. I also used fresh chilis mixed them with anaheim chilis and poblanos. I fire roasted them than peeled them. I used nonfat milk, and 3 eggs. The overall outcome was good, just not for dinner.Served with roasted spicy potatoes and warm tortillas on a Sunday brunch is more like it.

Loved this recipe but added some extras. Crushed baked tortilla chips and made a bottom crust. We cut the whole chilies into 1/2 squares and arranged them on the crust. Instead of all the milk, used half non-fat sour cream and half milk in the egg mixture and topped it all with parmesan cheese and garnished it with a sliver of a green chile. We also halved the reicpe for four servings and it worked out great! This would make a wonderful brunch dish for a crowd.

Excellent addition to my usual mexican food menu -and everyone loved it! I would make only one change: instead of cutting the chilis open and spreading them out I will cut them into 1"-2" slices. This will make it easier to spoon it out of the casserole dish as the whole chilis were hard to cut through.

I won't make it as written, but my version was a hit with my family.

This is one of the most delicious and super easy dishes I've ever prepared! Everyone loved it, and we all felt that it tasted better than the "real thing" (much easier too) The chilies used are very mild and tender, and the egg batter puffs up so light and fluffy-it's just wonderful!

For what it's worth: I used this as a side dish to a pretty elegant rolled/stuffed pork loin. So to spiff it up, I roasted/peeled/deseeded 20 fresh chilis. Lined the bottom of a pie plate with 1/2. Filled the pie with the milk/egg/flour mixture plus 4 ozs. goat cheese. After baking 30 minutes, I layered the other 1/2 of the chilis on top, and finished by sprinkling jack/cheddar cheese on top for last 15 minutes. Served in slices with a homemade grilled vegetable salsa. Delicious, beautiful, less cheesy, but a lot of work.

I'm willing to compromise health for flavor but this dish ended up as interesting as pizza without the crust. Although, it was made with Hatch, New Mexican chili it doesn't come close to comparing with the real thing.

For a buffet where you hold a plate, I use diced green chilis to make it easier to eat. This dish not only tastes good, but the aroma is wonderful.

This was easy and delicious. I used fresh chilis and added salsa when it came out of the oven. Freezes well too.

I have been making is for years. It is my husband and brother's favorite. The 13x9 pan is barely enough! I spoon 2 cups spagetti sauce over the top before baking. With all of the ready made sauces out there, you can experiment. Left overs are even better...although that doesn't happen much!

This is super easy to make and quite good. It reheats nicely in the microwave which means great leftovers too!

I prefer this recipe over the mexican original because it's much easier to prepare. I always place Herdez salsa over the casserole after it comes out of the oven.

Easy to make and great to taste! How can you go wrong with 8 cups of cheese. I replaced montery jack for hot pepper jack cheese...

The basic idea is okay, but you must make this with real ingredients. New Mexico green chile is the primary ingredient. Those that like it "real" will go for Barker; wimps can do with "Big Jim."

Very easy to prepare. I used fresh whole green chilies and they worked well. I also prepared a simple ranchero sauce to serve along side. Very delicious.

I took this recipe to work and men and women alike raved about it. They wanted the recipe and called it a feel good food. It was easy to make. I would like to know the calorie and fat content. Is that available somewhere?

I'm on a low-carb diet, so omitted the flour. It came out a little too moist (OK, very wet!), and should have adjusted the liquids. I also used 2 egss & the equivlent of 2 eggs substitute. Next time I'm going to try using all egg substitue, and omit the milk (this should also help reduce the fat).

Very easy to make and a crowd pleaser for those who are not fat gram conscious. Just the right amount of mild spice.
