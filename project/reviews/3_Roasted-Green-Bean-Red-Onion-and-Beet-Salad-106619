Nice salad. Substituted white wine for the water, and will probably cut down on the cooking time for the green beans next time around. I also added broccoli with the green beans since I was a bit short on them, and included 4 cloves of diced garlic with the beans/broccoli.

If you like beets, you'll probably like this better than I did. Never having had beets before I figured mixing it in with other veggies would be a good introduction, but even cutting down the beets, they still ovewhelmed the dish. I realized that beets may not be my thing.

Terrific dish. You can dress it up or down, depending on your mood - I've added handfuls of chopped cilantro and crumbled feta (feta and beets seem to work especially well together). A dish that will turn even those who profess to not like beets!

There is no doubt that I will make this recipe again. Where should I start? Even alone the beans with thyme would be terrific. The onions are great and so are the beets. It takes a while to roast the veggies but its not exactly hard to do. I dont see any reason why the onions and beets cant roast at the same time. Looking forward to eating the leftovers!

Blah! Even with everything fresh from our gardent,that was overall feeling, both the looks and taste of this salad just didn't do much. Too much work for a weekday meal, not good enough for a special meal.

This was a great salad. I did the entire thing on the grill--following the directions as stated, but used my gas grill instead of the oven. It came out beatifully. I spread goat cheese on a baguette and served it with the salad. A keeper.

I made a smaller batch of this salad, and tossed the beets as well as the onions and green beans with the balsamic vinegar. Also used dried thyme and thought the result was delicious! Will definately make again.

I made a half-recipe of this and it would have fed a small town. I enjoyed it, but the beet-phobic husband couldn't be convinced to try it. I need to serve it at a dinner party, both for company and because it's pretty to look at. Never had roasted beans before, and that was a pleasant surprise! Good stuff.

I tried out this recipe to initiate my George Foreman Grill. Needless to say, it did not turn out. Perhaps it was wise to stick to the oven method as suggested. Something was missing taste-wise but I will add some goat cheese as recommened by some of your readers.

Seeing how it's July in Chicago, my oven isn't going on to roast beets for an hour and half, let alone onions or green beans. I steamed the beans and grill-roasted the onions and beets. Recipe is definitely "thyme-ly" (sorry), which isn't a problem because I love thyme. The salad went from okay to good with the addition of goat cheese as an earlier reviewer suggested. Bon Appetit should save the oven-roasted vegetable recipes for the cooler month issues.

Easy, great recipe. Bought everything at the local farmer's market - everything was fresh & delicious. Would definitely make again.

First of all these recipes need to get into the search index so you can actually track them down again under an hour! The vegies need to be cut smaller according to the feedback at our dinner and the beets need more than olive oil to flavour them. Added more vinegar and lemon juice and would try this with a better dressing I think. Had a lot left over and ended up throwing the leftover away after 2 days of people not wanting to eat it.

I added more balsamic vinegar at the end, and finished the dish by sprinkling goat cheese on top......delicious!
