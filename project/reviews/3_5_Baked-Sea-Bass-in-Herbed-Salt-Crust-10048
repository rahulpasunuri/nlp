Excellent! Lots of work, but well worth it. Very filling. Fun to make because it's different.

Cooking time depends on the size of the fish. To test whether it is done or not, poke the thickest part of the fish with a long skewer. If, once extracted, the skewer is hot, but not wet, it means that the fish is done. http://www.academiabarilla.com/italian-recipes/friuli-venezia-giulia/bass-baked-salt.aspx

This recipe is great of entertaining because it takes little time in the kitchen and has a great presentation, I used it for a large dinner party and even people that were not fans of fish enjoyed it. For those fearful of the cost and botching the recipe, I would recommend using something less expensive like trout and getting the salt in a large quantity from a bulk grocery store. 50 pounds of salt is about the same as one pound at the national grocery chains.

Ugh---this recipe was super anti-climactic. The fish was hard to debone and the flavor was tolerable at best. End of story, I won't be making it again. It was way too shi shi and a waste of expensive fish.

This was wonderful. Presentation is fun too; we had our dinner guests doing their best to peer over our shoulders as we served this. Very easy, very tasty, I'll make this again.

Wonderful, easy and quick....what I really liked about it is that you get the taste of the fish...some recipes add so many spices that you can not appreciate the REAL flavor of the fish. that is why, too, you need to buy a REALLY GOOD fish for this one. I served it with steamed red-skin potatoes and steamed green asparagus. And a tip....for a super-easy clean up, cover the pan at the very begining with aluminun foil, so at the end you just have to pull it out and throw it to the trash can!!

Very good! The crust kept the fish juicy. I thought the large amount of salt would make the dish salty but it didn't.

Excellent. My son in Naples Italy prepares fish with a simular recipe. To avoid an overpowering salty taste drain the juices from under the fish before serving or build a channel in the salt under the fish so it seeps out during cooking. The idea is to keep the fish juices contained in the salt dome but too much liquid disolves the salt. Any number of ocean fish can be used. Striped Bass will even work, but firmer fleshed fish is better.

i think sea bass should be served with a little more acidity with things such as fruit or a wine sauce
