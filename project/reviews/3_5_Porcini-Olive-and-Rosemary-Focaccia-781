Caution: Read this receipe all the way through at least twice before starting to cook. I had some leftover dired porcini and fresh rosemary and decided to give it a try. It sounds wonderful, but the receipe as written is confusing.

Yum -- but with caveats. I used 0.7 oz dried cepes, which was plenty flavorful. Also, the olives and salt were too overwhelming for my husband and almost too overwhelming for me. Next time, I'd halve both the olives and the salt.

Highly recommended! This focaccia comes out very earthy, robust and salty in flavor. Balancing that is its really delicate, moist, cakey texture. Warm, with a slather of sweet butter, it was a marvelous accompaniment to a strong pasta dish. It looks unassuming, but don't be fooled. Following the recipe exactly really worked flawlessly, including the sticky dough (don't work more flour in.)
