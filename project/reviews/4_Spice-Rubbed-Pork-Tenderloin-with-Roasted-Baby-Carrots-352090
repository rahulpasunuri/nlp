This was really nice. Except my carrots were overcooked after 30 minutes in the foil. I picked the smallest, skinniest regular sized carrots, cut them in half crosswise then cut the thicker side in half lengthwise. So they were probably too small for the recipe, but I didn't know. I would just keep a closer eye on them next time. The spice level was really nice, and I liked the jalapeno with the carrots. I might double the pork rub as it is written. I only made one pork tenderloin, and I thought the full amount of rub was just enough for that.

Easy and delicious! I would add a little bit of cocoa and using syrian cumin next time.

I've made this recipe twice and loved it. However, could never find smoked paprika. Trader Joe's now carries it.

To those who are having problems with the carrots: be sure to use real baby carrots - not the kind that come in plastic bags that are just regular carrots that have been shaved and formed to look like baby carrots. The flavor of those is far from what the recipe calls for. I make these carrots with these spices whenever I cook meat that could use a punchy side dish and across the board they are well-loved. Oh - the pork is great too!

Wow, this is my kind of dinner. Easy AND delicious. I didn't have any ancho chili powder, so I omitted that, but it was still really good. I also added some yellow potatoes, cut to somewhat resemble the size of the carrots. I couldn't imagine the pork without potatoes. Oh, I didn't have honey, so I used (real) maple syrup instead. I just wish I had more riesling to go with it!

I did not have any jalapeno on hand so I substituted 1-2T of canned chipotle in adobo. The smokiness of the chipotle seemed to really complement the rest of the recipe. My husband raved about the carrots!! Served it with couscous. Next time I will glaze the pan and pour the juices over couscous.

Easy and delicious. I served it with my cheese grits souffle. Instead of baby carrots, I used Trader Joe's organic carrots, which are smaller than your typical supermarket carrots, and pulled the smallest ones out of the bag. I wanted to avoid buying spices I wouldn't use again so used regular paprika and ancho chile powder for the carrots and a mix of ancho and cayenne pepper for the pork.

I did not have carrots and used sweet potatoes (peeled and sliced) and they were a perfect match for the pork. My family loved the dish. I did not have ancho chile and used regular chile powder and it still tasted great.

Yum. Didn't have carrots, just broccoli and one pork tenderloin. Sprinkled the extra rub on broccoli tossed in olive oil and roasted them both in 400 oven for about 25min. Fantastic and simple meal!

Usually I'm dubious of the rare spoiler, but I have to join that clan and say this was nothing to write home about. Wanted to love based on pic, reviews, ingredients. Ended up with blah mushy carrots which could have stood less water, time, or covering and perhaps citrus to brighten. Tender pork with underwhelming flavor. Followed recipe to a T, so it was likely the regular chili powder (chili+spice blend) I subbed for the ancho (dried poblano), the only exception made. So... per Oakland, something to consider if you're evaluating the adventure. Ups: beautiful looking, breeze to put together.

I used regular carrots and cut each carrot into about 5-8 pieces, about 4-5 inches long. I only roasted covered for 20 minutes (not 30) and that was fine. I used regular chile powder because I didn't have ancho. The carrots were good but I wouldn't rave about them. I took the pork out of the oven at 140 degrees and it was fine. Again I used regular chile powder, not ancho. I would omit or decrease the chile powder if I make the pork again as it seemed to dominate the other spices.

This was really good! I've had the recipe saved since last July, but tried it for the first time last night. Hubby is not a fan of cooked carrots, but he even liked them. I made it with one smallish tenderloin and half the carrots, but I used the full amount of spice rub on the pork and for the carrots. I also added about half a small onion cut into chunks and roasted it with the carrots. My pork took about 5 minutes longer to cook than the recipe called for, but it was still a pretty quick meal that would be easy to make after work and there were plenty of pan juices to drizzle over the meat. I served it with buttermilk mashed potatoes. Yum!

This is one DELICIOUS recipe! The tenderloin came out perfect- juicy and very tender; the carrots are phenomenal. Even our finicky 18 year old loved it and we decided we'll make the carrots even more frequently than the pork. Fantastic!

I'll just say WOW! I was planning on making this, but got invited to go ice skating, so my husband said, "I'll make it" (yikes!). I had my doubts but when I got home, the smell was unbelievable! The meal was delicious! The pork was wonderfully spiced, and the carrots were exceptional. It must have been easy, considering the last question I got before I walked out the door was, "How do I peel carrots?". Yummy dinner, and my husband was a total hero. He will be making this again, since it is now one of "his" specialties.

Most of my family won't eat pork so I just make the carrots. It's the only veggie dish that has caused a fight over the last piece. :)

excellent recipe, easy to make and flavorful. The only changes we made were studding the tenderloin with slivers of garlic and adding onions in the sauteed pan towards the end of the searing process, so that there are carrots and onions in the fisnished product.

Excellent and quick. Hubby and two sons loved it, as did I. Saved this one into the recipe box and will redo it soon, even for company. Used combination of regular carrots and sweet potatotes, cooked them on separate pan from the meat and didn't have a jalapeno but other than that followed directions as provided. Love this website!

I doubled the amount of spices and I thought it was still pretty bland. I probably should have cooked the carrots more so they would carmelize but still, overall just a very plain dish. If I make it again, I would add a lot more spices.

I made this recipe with one pork tenderloin and 4 chicken thighs (cooking the thighs exactly the same as the pork), I didn't have the pork, because I don't eat pork, but the chicken thigh was one of the best pieces of chicken I have ever had. And the carrots were amazing. I served it with mac and cheese (homemade not from a box), and cinnamon apple sauce, and watermelon. And the meal was pretty balanced.

This is one of the best pork tenderloin recipes I've come across. The spice rub is perfect with or without the carrots (although they do lend a nice sweet counterpart). I've made it again and again- in fact, I'm making it tomorrow. It's a must try for any pork tenderloin fan.

This was an easy dish to make with ingredients I had on hand. My children and husband loved it and ate it all, no leftovers. Key is to let the meat rest after pulling it out of the oven. Served it with rice and steamed green beans, too.

Wow, I found this to be a fantastic dish! So simple and quick to make. One of the best tenderolin recipes I've made to date. I subbed chipotle powder for the ancho chile and added a little paprika and cayenne to the carrots (and a few rutabaga quarters that I added!). Pork was cooked perfectly, however, I did reduce the temperature to 375 when I put the pork in. Great with smashed red potatoes and a light but zesty red wine.

This recipe is one of my absolute favorites! It is so easy to make and requires very few ingredients. I am a huge fan of sweet sauces with pork dishes so I have taken it a step further and I serve it with a honey-cinnamon sauce. The honey and cinnamon go great with the cumin in the spice rub. 1/4 C Honey 1/2 tsp. Cinnamon 1/2 tsp. Nutmeg 1 Tbs. Olive Oil Heat for 30 sec. in the microwave and serve!

I thought 2 lbs of carrots seemed like a lot, and made only one pound for four people. But it wasn't enough! Everyone was wild for those carrots! And, oh yeah, the pork was nice, too!

My family loves this! I always make a few extra carrots and make sure I don't overcook the meat. Regular carrots work just fine sliced into a large julienne. We usually serve it with a green vegetable like sauteed spinach or brocolinni. I love the way I feel like I am making a special dinner in less than 45 minutes! Once, I did have a leftover tendeloin and ground the cooked meat and created wonderful empanadas; so good I purposely made too much meat the next time:)

These carrots are fabulous and worth making the whole recipe as the pork juices and spices "influence" the flavor of the vegatable.

I just made this in a hurry without the carrots. The meat was tender and juicy. I halved the recipe because I was cooking for two, and it worked beautifully. Browned the meat first in a hot pan with olive oil and a little salt and pepper, then added the spice rub before baking. This recipe is a keeper and very easy to make. Will try with carrots next time.

I just tried this recipe for a weeknight dinner for two and both my husband and I thought it was delicious. As most reviewers have mentioned, the carrots were wonderful. I used larger carrots and only cooked them for about 18-20 minutes, and since we like spicy food I did not remove the seeds from the jalepeno. I halved the pork recipe because I was cooking for two. I mistakenly added the olive oil to the spice rub for the pork but it turned out to be a good mistake because it gave the pork a nice crust. I will be making this again.

Great dish but 20 mins. is more than enough for the carrots, otherwise they get mushy.

This was awesome. I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I only roasted the carrots for 20 minutes before putting the pork in the oven. The carrots have a delightfully complex sweet/spicy flavor, and the meat was cooked perfectly. I'll be making this one again, and soon.

I took advice from others and added yams to the regular carrots chopped thin. also marinated the pork in the rub for a few hours. didn't have honey and molassas made a great subsitute. pulled the pork out at 140 degrees and it went up to 150 while resting for a nice meduim well. veggies were outstanding and pork was tender and juicy. yum!

Either my meat thermometer is wrong, but the 145 degrees was a bit too long. It came out kind of dry.... The flavor of the rub was yummy though- and I agree about using larger carrots. Baby carrots can't hold up to the heat. And I'm not sure what I did wrong, but the carrots didn't have a caramelized coat, like I thought they would. Despite these issues, everyone who ate the dish said they enjoyed it. Maybe some tweaking for the next time.

Way yummier than I expected! One of the best new recipes I've tried this year...and I try new recipes on a weekly (almost daily) basis. I subbed chipotle chile powder for ancho chile powder, everything else was the same.

Have made more then once with never- ending rave reviews. Would suggest sticking to the ingredients exactly (a green jalapeno will also do fine). The rub spices can be used on steak as well. Baby carrots will be a bit too soft if you cook them suggested time, shorten time a bit but not too much because the sweet caramelization is oh so good. Also tried with regular sized carrots cut into three or four pieces (approx. size of babies) and cooked full time (are firmer and can handle the full baking time). Make extra carrots (w/a bit more of all marinade ingredients), they will not go to waste!!! If you follow pork cooking instructions should turn out a bit pink and moist. Use a digital leave- in meat thermometer to avoid unnecessary poking and cutting(If you don't have one, get one! They're great.). Can cook a tad longer if you are afraid but dried out pork is the pits! Yum yum yum. Enjoy.

I used regular chile powder and regular paprika since that's all I had in the house. I also used about half the amount of carrots and added a head of cauliflower florets to them. As another reviewer suggested, I put the vegetables in the oven while I prepped the pork, so they probably weren't in there the full 30 minutes. Served over creamy parmesan polenta (also from this site). It was absolutely delicious - the carrots & cauliflower were better than any recipe I can remember and the pork was just slightly pink and juicy. My husband said this dish is easily in his "top ten."

I made this dish but the pork was a little dry. Wouldn't it be better to lower the oven temp when the meat and carrots are returned to the oven? I will do that the next time I make this recipe.

This was really good even though I dried out the pork. Just couldn't get the temp right so wanted to be on the safe side. Used machined organic carrots, they seemed fine. And tasted delicious! I would even consider doubling the carrots they were so good. Maybe next time I'll cover the pork.

My cooking group made this last night. We followed the recipe exactly as written. It was wonderful. The pork was a little pink and moist (cooked to the 145 degrees suggested) and the carrots were a hit. I like the idea of adding sweet potatoes and parsnips to the carrots for more flavoring. If anything, I think I would not seed the jalapeno completely for a little more of a kick.

it turned out wonderful! i used fresh oregano and also added some fresh sage from my garden. also roasted some asparagus and shitake mushrooms along with the carrots. no changes otherwise. i didn't have a meat thermometer. found some websites that suggested 30minutes per pound at 400 and letting it rest for 15-20mins thereafter. it worked perfectly for me. it was nicely pink inside.

I pretty much made this as written, except the prep method. It was good and spicy. I roasted the carrots (used the organic machine cut with no adverse effects) in a rimmed cookie sheet with foil. Then I browned the pork in my All- Clad saute pan, took the carrots out and added to saute pan and then finished off in the oven to the desired temp. What I would do NEXT time is remove the food and deglaze the pan with broth and wine for a light sauce for the pork. Now that would be the bomb.

Thanks to everyone who left reviews! We've only recently started to contribute after benefitting from everyone else's reviews for years. That's why we like Epicurious... a lot of folks who know how to cook, try the recipe, make variations or note observations. Very helpful... [Some of you are kind of kooky, but it's all good!] We loved these flavors! Seriously great spice mixtures, great heat and sweet combinations. The tips to not over cook the carrots were really helpful. We've made this twice, and here's what we'd suggest. Use medium sized carrots, cut them into 3 or 4 inch sections, but only cook for them 18-20 minutes as you prep and sear/brown the tenderloin. Then combine and cook: we like it Med, Rare so we only cooked the pork and carrots for about 14-15 minutes. Then removed the pork to let it set for 10 mintues, and then tossed the carrots back into the overn for that additional time. And we upped the spice to water/honey/oil ratios a bit! Which is really great with both, but especially the sweetness of the carrots. And just to proselytize a bit, really splurge and treat yourself and buy a good cut of pork tenderloin. Get something local, sustainable, not overly chemically enhanced... Don't get the Costco/Hormel/Safeway stuff. Treat yourself and pay more and get real, flavorful, healthy meat. Yeah, you'll pay more, but spend more for it and eat less of it and you'll come out WAY ahead on all counts! Try it! It's a fun and versatile recipe, that real cooks will enjoy experimenting with.

I made this with a purchased pork tenderloin marinated in peppercorns and garlic which I had in the frig. Added this spice rub [sans the salt] and grilled it [with hickory chips for smoke] to just medium doneness. Served it sliced on a crusty sandwich bun with avocado, tomato, scallion slices and cilantro. Fantastic!! The men loved it!

Surprised the wife by fixing this when she got home last evening (not often). For someone who doesn't like a lot of prep this was easy and really good. She raved about the carrots. The pork was good but could've used a little more flavor, could've been because I put it on the smoker for an hour at 150 degrees to absorb some smoke flavor. I'm thinking it sealed the meat not allowing it to take in the spices. The pork was still moist, though. Will definatly make again.

Delicious rub, and will use for grilling chicken, too. Loved the carrots; spice mixture would also work great on roasted potatoes. My only criticism was pork was a tad dry, and I think this was more related to the fact that it's a very lean, low-fat meat than reaching an internal temp of 145. Next time I might deglaze the pan used to brown the meat with some wine or chicken broth, whisk in just a little butter to thicken, and drizzle over sliced pork.
