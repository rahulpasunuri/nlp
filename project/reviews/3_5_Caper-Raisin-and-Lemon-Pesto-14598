An interesting, sweet-and-sour twist on pesto. I used more herbs than called for, in an assortment from cleaning up my herb garden -- mostly basil and mint, some thyme, and a bit of parsley and tarragon -- and added a handful of almonds. With the extra ingredients and skipping the water (I don't approve of water in pesto), I needed a bit more olive oil to smooth it out. Served with shrimp and pasta to happy reviews.

This is really unusual and delicious. Like one reviewer, we added chopped toasted nuts (walnuts and almonds) and baked it with white fish. And because we don't have access to a food processor currently, we finely chopped everything together on a cutting board, then mixed it with the oil and lemon juice in a bowl. We also skipped the rinsing step and it did not turn out too salty.

Very unusual and always a hit. Nice with grilled lamb.

Great with white fish and a little bit of pinenuts while mixing in the food processor, just to give it a bit more consistency.
