I am a huge potato salad fan and this is one of my favorite recipes. Anything with leeks in the mix is OK with me. The fingerling potatoes are so flavorful and the mustard seed gives the dish such a nice, almost caviar-like, texture. I too like the no mayo dressing and I agree that making the salad the day before and bringing it to room temperature before serving is a good idea.

I have made this twice and it is so good!! both times i have made 2/3 the quantity of potatoes and leeks and the same amount of dressing because we like it a bit wetter. will make it again and again -- is my go to potato salad!

I loved this recipe. Made it the day before and you definitely want to bring it to room temp before serving. The flavor was subtle but delish.

I'm always looking for recipes wthout mayo - this is a winner. Mustard seed is a great add to the vinegarette, not too strong and nice texture. One caveat - use a screen over the top of your saute pan. Even though the seeds are on the heat just long enough to start popping - they pop quickly and travel far!

A great tasting, unique and easy potato salad.

My new favorite potato salad! Especially great when you're looking to avoid the mayonnaise factor on a hot summer day. The mustard seeds provided little bursts of flavor throughout and a nice, slightly crunchy texture. Will definitely make again!

Paired very nicely with just about anything from the grill. Leeks are always interesting! Added additional vinegar (and let it sit overnight for flavors to blend).
