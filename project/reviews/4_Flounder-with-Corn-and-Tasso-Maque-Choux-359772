The fish is fine - simple and good - I used catfish, because it's what I had...the maque choux is what makes this recipe! Poblanos are wonderful...if you have good tasso on hand (and I did) you're going to LOVE this dish!

Outstanding recipe. The flounder cooked to perfect done-ness. I was a bit disappointed with how it didn't absorb as much flavor as I would have hoped. The Corn and Tasso is killer! I used a high-end bacon and it turned out fantastic!

I thought this dish was really well balanced with the taso.I would find it a little overwhelming with the citrus and beer and wine flavor, but was fantastic with the corn and smokiness of the tasso. I didn't find that the thyme added much flavor to the dish. I also used sole as neither sole nor John Dory were available. My husband who seldom eats fish enjoyed this dish.

prepared the fish exactly as directed - delicious - used sole as no flounder was available. Fish had a custardy consistency and was fragrant with the citrus - will definitely make again.
