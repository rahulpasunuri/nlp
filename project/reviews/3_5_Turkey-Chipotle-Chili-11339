I was committed to the recipe before it dawned on me that this was not going to be a tomato based chili. I made half a recipe. My variation - added a fresh roasted poblano pepper, roasted corn, both white and black beans - 2 total cans, and more chicken broth the whole 14oz can. I love cilantro so I added twice what the recipe called for. The chili was tasty but not nearly spicy enough....will definitely be adding more chipotle and adobo at least twice what recipe calls for if not more to the leftovers....or maybe I should add the rest of the can :)

I just made the same mistake as another reviewer... "my chili turned out H-O-T. Maybe thats because I interpreted 2 canned whole chipotle chilies in adobo as two CANS of peppers," and I agree that I would not change a thing! Amazing flavor! I used a red pepper instead of green and added black beans, fresh sweet corn off the husk and a chopped serrano pepper. Awesome!

Nice if you like a lighter Chili made with Turkey. It got a nice heat level and flavor profile. It makes a ton so I halved the recipe and takes a while to make so plan accordingly. FYI...it took me a bit to figure out that Coriander is Cilantro.

Not often that I'll rate a recipe while I'm still in the process of making it, but I fear that I may not get a taste. I'm making this for the fellas for Superbowl. I used 3lbs of turkey (4 seemed excessive), 3 canned chipotles, and 2 cans of beans (mostly to absorb the heat of that 3rd chipotle-whoo!). I resisted the urge to add a can of diced tomatoes to make it more "red" and glad that I left it out. The green is different and the flavors are fresh and the heat is good. I can only imagine how much better it will taste tomorrow!

I have made this for the last 2 years on Super Bowl Sunday to rave reviews. I have made dozens of different chili recipes over the years and this has been the favorite by far. Tomatillos add a nice flavor to the standard fare. Just the way we like chili in the west!

I was excited about this because of all the great reviews, but I don't think I have ever had a recipe turn out as badly as this one did. It was more soup than chili - completely watery and bland, not spicy, flavorless, and just blech. Also, I found the recipe confusing/incomplete -- I pureed the tomatillos, but the recipe lacked clear instructions on what should be done with them. I recommend finding another recipe - this one was just awful.

I was so excited to find this chili recipe. I didnt want to make the same old red variety -- I saw tomatillos and I was sold! It turned out wonderfully spicy and delicious. To cut the spice a bit, I've been topping the chili with some greek yogurt (healthier than sour cream), and crumbled corn muffins. So yummy! Some reviewers are saying they didn't think this was spicy enough& I have a high tolerance for spice and my chili turned out H-O-T. Maybe thats because I interpreted 2 canned whole chipotle chilies in adobo as two CANS of peppers. Whatever - I wouldn't change a thing! I pureed two 7-oz. cans of La Morena chipotle peppers. I blanched the tomatillos whole for a few minutes, pureed them and mixed with the chipotle puree. I let that all hang out whilst I cooked the onions, turkey etc. The only off-label element I added to the mix was some roughly chopped leeks. I think that added a nice texture and flavor.

I thought this had a nice subtle taste with the right amound of heat. I'm tired of most red chili and welcomed the change. Tomatillos are expensive here so I only put in a pound and pureed them without precooking. Used 2 pounds of turkey but I can see where 4 pounds would be okay.Served with cornbread and life was good.

The BF and I made this on a cloudy cool day in Florida. We halved the recipe. We wish we hadn't halved it because it was delicious! It was spicy enough to warm you up, but not enough that we were grabbing for water. We didn't add any chili powder, though we were ready for it. Great flavor, so filling. We topped ours with a generous dallop of sour cream and mixed aged cheddar with jalepeno jack cheese. Other mods: Used the full amount of garlic. Used only 1.5 lbs of turkey (as per other reviewers recommendations). We didn't have to simmer the second time for the whole 30 minutes, probably because we halved it. Blached the tomatillos. When shopping in the store for the ingrediants, we used cilantro leaves insead of the dry coriander (no fresh available, same plant different growth stage). We used the small can of canned adobo chipotles (there were two sizes), and found the green chilies next to the taco shells (for some reason it was separate in Bravo supermarket). Lastly, we ended up reserving the canned bean liquid and adding it back in for consistancy at the end. Ours came out pretty red. Gosh this was yummy!

I have never cooked with whole chipotle chilies in adobo sauce from a can or fresh ones for that matter so had NO idea they were very spicy. You should make some note of the spiciness of this dish in the recipe. We like spicy but this was Way too much.

I was really excited about this recipe and chose it to cook for a friend that does not eat red meat. I was unbelievably disappointed with this chili, as was my friend who ate only a few spoonfuls. It lacked flavor and was only spicy hot. I made this in late January and have been wondering if the tomatillos I used were not in season and therefore flavorless, but they came from Mexico and were sold at Whole Foods...

Wow. Really fantastic. I added an extra chipotle chile and used turkey london broil instead of ground turkey, but otherwise followed the recipe to a T. I'll definitely make this again.

This is easily one of my all-time favorite chili recipes. I know most of the reviewers backed off the amount of turkey, but I went in the opposite direction and upped it to 4.5 lbs, most of which was bulk sweet Italian turkey sausage. I added another 1.5 cups of chicken broth to offset the extra protein and it tasted great. Next time, I'll add more garlic and maybe one can of petite diced tomatoes w/ green chilies.

Rating: 4
Fabulous! The whole family loved it. I chose this recipe because I was using up leftover turkey that had been cooked outside on the grill and already had a smoky flavor. My mods: As others have pointed out, tomatillos need to be boiled and pureed before adding. Used homemade turkey stock and some of the tomatillo cooking liquid. Added 1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa and 1 teaspoon whole cumin seeds when sauteeing onions, and sauteed a few sliced tomatillos in with the onions. Used red instead of green bell pepper. Used 1 1/4 lbs ground turkey and 1 1/4 lbs shredded leftover smoked turkey, and added two 15-oz cans white beans at end of cooking time. Skipped last 3 cloves of garlic. Served over rice with chopped fresh cilantro, grated cheese, and chopped avocado in addition to sour cream, with corn bread (from the Jiffy mix) on the side.

Well, I read several reviews prior to making this. 1: 3 Chipotles rather than 2; definitely. 2. Jalapenos!!! 3 unless the inlaws are coming. ( Habs good too.) Add to onions and garlic. Spicy is always good; sour cream is a viable mediator. 3. 2.5 lbs meat appropriate. 4 lbs would have been way too much. 4. If in canada, and can rarely get fresh tomatillos, and have to resort to cans, be wary of salt content. as in all cans. Salt closer to the end. *!!!* Will be making this one again. Arum, arum. ... :)

Really nice recipe. Yes there are some flaws but with the right correction this is a fantastic chili. You can either roast the tomatillos or use them raw and puree. And like other readers I added 3 chipotle chilis instead of 2 and I used 2.5 lbs of ground veal (just had it in the freezer) instead of turkey which definitely made it richer. I don't know why they have 4lbs in the recipe - that's way too mcuh. I also used fresh jalapenos and oregano since I grow them and I didn't separate the garlic, choosing to add them all at one time in the beginning. According to my husband, "best chili you've made"

Everyone enjoyed this version of chili. I did make some changes. One of the greatest things about chili is adding toppings so everyone can make it their own. Changes: 3 chipotle and some adobo sauce, added a bit of cayanne and chili spice, used a red bell pepper, added a can of white beans and a can of garbanzo beans. Toppings: It adds freshness to the chili, plus it's fun for a group of people. Chopped spring onions, chopped Cilantro, crumbled queso fresco, diced avocado, low-fat sour cream w/ adobo mixed in, and lime wedges. Everyone can go to town and add what they want.

This is a fantastic and unique chili recipe. I modified it like many of the other reviewers: -added 3 chipotles instead of 2, along with some of the adobo sauce -blanched the tomatillos and squeezed the water out before pureeing, used less than one cup of water to account for this extra water -more garlic -only about 2.5 lbs turkey -one big can of white beans and a small can of kidney beans -other spices such as cayenne, mexican chili powder The result was a spicy (but not too spicy), smoky, flavorful chili that seems relatively healthy. Yum!

Made this yesterday and thought it was great! A nice amount of spice (heat). I roasted the tomatillos under the broiler, reduced the ground turkey to 2.5 lbs and put in 2 15oz can of white beans. After I stirred in the bell pepper I did not simmer for 30 minutes, and I'm glad I didn't because the bell peppers were a bit overdone. Like another reviewer, I added some adobo sauce to some sour cream to place on top. Would be good with some cotija cheese on top too!

This is a great alternative to the "typical" chili, especially when you have non-meat-eating friends. I think this recipe may be missing the steps to blanch and puree the tomatillos if you buy them fresh.

Rating: 4
I made this pretty much as directed although I halved the amount of ground turkey to 2 lbs. I also substituted a red bell for the green bell pepper (to add a little color). I also roasted and charred the fresh tomatillos before pureeing them. Well, it was very delicious. Chili is usually best when reheated the next day, so it will probably be even better tomorrow. I think this definitely a dish you could experiment with and make your own.

Rating: 3
I found it odd that this chili recipe did not include any beans or tomatoes. I ended up substituting some of the tomatillos for regular tomatioes (canned, diced), and I added kidney beans, garbanzo beans and a can of corn. The recipe was very flavorful and the chipotle peppers added nice flavor and spice.

My second time making this recipe, and again it turned out great. The tomatillos are easy - rinse, chop, puree. There's no need to cook them before adding to the chili. You could roast them in the oven for a different flavor. The recipe is time consuming, but it makes great leftovers!

Rating: 4
This was great! For the tomatillos, I boiled for 5 minutes whole then pureed roughly. Had to use pinto beans because that was all I had, also used ground chicken and only 2 lbs of it. Instead of green chiles I sauteed 2 poblanos with my onions. This was a really great recipe and I altered it to use the ingrediants I already had. Will be making this again!

I HATE chili, and I LOVE this recipe! It's amazing. I add a little extra chipotles but thats because I like it spicy, and only use one pack of ground turkey. Add some cheddar on top, and serve with super yummy french rolls or ciabatta rolls and it's perfect on a cold day!

This chili received great reviews at a chili cook-off! Many referred to its flavor as "smokey," and it did have a bit of a kick! I made it with chicken and Great Northern beans. I used canned chilis in adobo, and fresh tomatillos. The tomatillos need to be boiled, then the water from the boiling that gets inside the tomatillos needs to be "squeezed" out gently. I pressed each one between a slotted spoon, and a soup spoon, when I removed them from the boiling water. Then, put them in a blender and pureed. Removing the water helps keep the chili thicker, rather than soupy. Note: fresh coriander is also called cilantro. Do not use coriander seed...it is not the same. The leaf and the seed of this plant have 2 completely different flavors. Enjoy!

The chipotle chilis add depth to the flavor of the dish. Overall, very good.

This chili tastes great, and I like the fact that it's really healthy. I will make it again, but I was somewhat disappointed in that mine was more like soup than chili. Here's what I think happened. Since the recipe leaves out an important step - how to puree the tomatillos - I was kind of on my own to figure it out. I think I cooked them in too much liquid. Then when I pureed, they were somewhat too soupy, thus making my chili too soupy. It's a little annoying to spend all the time and money making this recipe and then find out some important directions are missing.

DADDY LIKES! I followed the general consensus and bumped up the seasoning, doubling the spice and garlic. I added the chilis in adobo and also added half a can of green chilis to the mix. I used cocoa powder at two tablespoons. I really like it. Next to epicurious' recipe for Turkey chipolte chili, this is a favorite. It could use a dash of picante to it's flavor range, but really once you add a bit of sour cream you're ready to cowboy up.

Although I am a huge fan of regular old tomato red chili, this is a great low fat chili and yum. The chipotles give such a deep smoky flavor that adds depth to this light version of chili. Adjustments: -used 1/2 lb. of fresh tomatillos pureed with a smidge of chix broth and 1/2 a jar of Frontera tomatillo salsa (yum). -used 3-4 chipotles. -pureed some of the beans with the garlic (the 2 cloves that go in at the end) and stirred that in with the rest of the beans to thicken it. -used 1/2 red, 1/2 green bell for color. We haven't had dinner yet but I've snuck some out of the pan on some tortilla chips...whoah, it's good!

made only half a batch, but still used the two chipotles. After tasting it, I must say it surely needed that much chipotle, would double the chipotles if ever making the whole batch.

I wrote an earlier review and had misplaced my copy of the recipe... this is a favorite of my family and to the cook who said something must be missing from the recipe about cooking the fresh tomatillos, you are correct. An earlier version stated to boil/blanch them in salted water and drain... I always use a very small amount of chicken broth and puree it together

The recipee definately leaves out the instructions on pureeing the tomiltillos. Also, for my first attempt, I interpreted the 2 "canned" chipoltes to mean 2 "cans" chipoltes. My wife loved it because of her love of extreme spice. I almost died after tasting the 10X spice of the extra indegrediants. Be carefull of the chipolte's.

My husband and I have been making this recipe for over 2 years now and it's one of our staples. We halve the recipe and use 1 package of turkey (1.25 lbs). I think some information about the tomatillos must have been left out since I printed the recipe. I blend the tomatillos with some of the chicken stock and put most of it aside, but I leave some (few tablespoons) in the blender and add about 2 (individual) canned chipotles along with some of the sauce (adobo) and some chicken stock, for easier blending. Then, when it comes time to add the chipotles, I can control how much heat I want in the final product by starting with half of the chipotle mixture and increasing as needed. Also, I think the chili tastes great without the mild green chiles, bell pepper, cornmeal, or cilantro (coriander).

Also, the recipe should say that the tomatillos need to be pureed (although I did figure this out).

This dish was just so-so. There's another turkey chili recipe in your files - I believe it's called turkey chili with white beans - that I prefer and would make again, rather than this one. In the other one, readers suggested using dark beer as part of the liquid, and it was quite good.

With a few modifications, this has become my standard chili. I replace the turkey with more "beanage", usually black and pinto (reconstituted dry), and keep a bottle of GOOD QUALITY flat beer handy which I add with water when the chili needs need liquid. I add carrots chopped very fine, and a couple of beets if I can find them fresh. I don't let anyone know they're in there, though. You know how people are. But feel free to let them see the beer bottle.

This is a terrific chili! I made a few changes, simply because I needed to stretch the chili a bit to feed a crowd: I added a bottle of Michelob, eight dashes of green Tabasco sauce, and I chopped up a red bell pepper and added it for color, as another reviewer had suggested. I also used two 15-oz. cans of white beans (I used cannelini), instead of one 19-oz. can. I used fresh tomatillos. I love the flavor of this stuff!

I misread the amount of the chiptole chiles and put 2 'cans'. The recipe reads '2' of the canned chipotle chiles. Of course, ours came out a tad hot. Very good taste though since we like very spicy.

Puree the tomatillos in the food processor or blender.
