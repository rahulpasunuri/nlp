Awful--mushy\, too eggy, and horrible flavor. NO ONE ate it.

This was delicious! I made the egg bread from another recipe found here and everything turned out wonderfully! No regrets!

Delightful - everyone was pleasantly pleased with the custardy base - a wonderful change from traditional stuffing. I highly recommend this not only on Thanksgiving but it would also go great with roasted pork.

I made this receipe for Christmas 1999 (Australia) to go with a glazed apricot and honey turkey roll. I replaced the capsicum with zucchini and found this to be delicious. The only part of the receipe I would take out is the almonds as they were too hard for a stuffing. I would also add in alot more herbs, such as rosemary and double the quantity of sage.

Wanted to try but didn't have a large, heavy dutch oven. What a shame, I'll have to pick one up sometime soon.

This stuffing has a great texture and wonderful, delicate flavor. The apricots and almonds are the secret ingredients--they really give this dressing a boost!
