Great recipe. I will definitely make this again. Mixed the parmesan with about half reggiano parmegiano, which added a bit of depth. Served with a barbera...yummy!

Made this tonight for me and my husband--it was delicious. We both loved it! The peppery arugula adds really nice flavor to the spicy sausage. I halved it, but would probably do the full 2 cups of arugula next time. Plus, it was easy--from start to finish (on a MONDAY!) in a little over an hour.

super DELISH and so easy. made it to the T and would like but more even ratio of meat sauce to pasta so i'll use an entire 16 oz. box of rigatoni next time. but this is a keeper for sure!

It was good and a great way use arugula from my CSA. Also nice to add some greens to meat sauce. But it really needs salt added when you put in the tomatoes!!

This is one of my regular go to recipes. I usually make it with sweet Italian sausage so the kids will eat it too. I also found that letting the sauce simmer for 2 or 3 hours makes the sausage so much more tender and flavorful.

I really liked this. As a *new* cook, I've been looking for good recipes based on what I get from my share at my local CSA. I ended up with a bunch of arugula and had no idea what to do with it. This sounded interesting and I was surprised how much the arugula and basil added to a pretty common meat sauce. Will make again.

This is a great weekday meal. Simple, light, flavorful and delicious. It was a hit with my guests. I loved both the arugula and the fresh oregano! I substituted chicken sausage and it worked well.

I substituted the sausage with the vegetarian ground beef from Trader Joe's and was very pleased with the results. I just added some dried red chili flakes for heat. The dried oregano I used worked fine too. I don't agree that it gets lost with all the arugula. It seemed just right. Also there's enough sauce to use an entire 16 oz. rigatoni box. You'll have delicious leftovers for days.

Absolutely delicious and very easy to make! The fresh oregano adds a depth to this dish and really goes well combined with the other flavors, don't skip out on it!

This recipe is delicious and I will definitely make it again. Made if for a group including adults and kids and everyone liked it. You can easily double the amount of pasta the recipe calls for and it is still very saucy.

This a family favorite, great as is. For basil lovers, you can never have too much ...

This is really a 3.5 fork recipe. Warm and delicious! We made it with all hot Italian sausage and neither my husband or I thought it was overly spicy - just perfect! Loved this meal! Super easy and great for company or a cold Saturday night!

This was really good! I made it with half mild and half hot sausages for children's sensitivities, but otherwise made it as written. The sausage makes for a nice "oomph" to a basic tomato sauce and the arugula takes it the next step. Not guest-worthy but definitely a great midweek meal.

Delicious meat sauce! I made this when my in-laws came over and it disappeared! Getting some good quality sausage, and adjusting the spiciness to your liking, is key. This recipe does make alot, I have not tried freezing it but I imagine it would hold up well.

my girlspacefriend made this (actually I made most of it), It was DELICIOUS! But she bought small Rigatonis so It did not match the picture perfectly. And she didnt have fresh basil. But it was still DELICIOUS

This was delicious! I've never used arugula in a red sauce before, it added great color and flavor. Definitely a repeater!

Don't let the 3 fork rating fool you--I only give 4 forks to recipes that I think are absolutely insanely delicious. I thought that this recipe was nice and easy, and it made a tasty ragu-like sauce. It does make a lot of sauce, though. Half the recipe was enough for 2 people to have leftovers. I plan to make this the next time I crave pasta and my boyfriend wants something meaty.

Delicious and Easy! As a working mom, I am always on a quest for adding new fast, easy, and nutritious offerings to my repertoire. This was a big hit with my husband and 2 growing boys (8&10), as well as the office (makes a lot, so leftovers came into the office). I am a big fan of arugula and basil and wanted to try this out. I'm not the biggest fan of sausage, but this made me a convert! I did not used fresh oregano (didn't have on had, so used dried). Depending on how spicy you like, (I like spicy), you may want to try some red pepper flakes. I used 1 pound hot Italian sausage and 1 pound sweet for my milder palated boys...ENJOY!

Quick and easy, yes, but exciting no. When I have time I'll go for a more interesting sauce. In a pinch this is fine. The arugula is a nice touch in the sauce but I recommend using more-- it cooks way down.

As a previous reviewer, I used 16 oz. of pasta & 1 lb. of sausage (we prefer the Hot Buffalo turkey sausage from Fresh Market). Tastes wonderful w/o the arugula, too. In addition, I used shallot instead of onion. This recipe has become a family favorite!

This was easy and we liked it a lot. I would add some crushed red pepper next time - the hot sausage provided some bite, but not enough. I think some shrimp would be a good addition too.

I only used a pund of sausage and upped the pasta to 16oz. Still plenty of sauce and it got rave reviews from my husband and his friends

A few changes to this dish: half the recommended sausage in mild instead of hot plus red pepper flakes to taste; 1lb assorted summer squash added; spinach instead of arugula. A really tasty, quick recipe for a weeknight, with plenty of leftovers.

Killer recipe, easy to make, and very tasty. It's basically a bolognese with sausage.

I agree with the cook from Lynchburg -- this seems like an dish for autumn. It is very rich, but good. I have some beautiful arugula growing in my garden right now, so am on the hunt for recipes to use it.

This was good, but not exceptional. I am a little surprised that it was in an article about summer pasta recipes, because to me it seemed more like a fall/winter recipe. I will likely make it again in the fall, when there is fresh arugula at the farmer's market. I agree with the previous reviewer that the fresh basil was overpowered by the other flavors. It would be fine to use dried. Also, the recipe makes way too much sauce for 8 oz of pasta. I made 16 oz and there was still plenty of sauce.

i thought this recipe was great- easy to do and tasted fancier than it was. i omitted the oregano and the peeled tomato (kept the crushed tomato) and it didn't seem to miss it.

Thought this was a great pasta recipe. Made it for my husband and two very small kids and everyone loved it. I added a little extra fresh basil and used mild Italian sausage instead of spicy (the kids have trouble with extra spicy) and it was delicious. A very fresh, easy pasta dish. I might substitute spinach in the future for the arugula...

This was delicious. I made some modifications, and reviewed it on my blog! I halved the recipe, and it was enough for four. I also added spinach, rather than arugula, and chicken sausage rather than pork sausage. Delicious!!!!

this was a very savory sauce with good fresh flavors. I used chicken italian sausage which was mildly spicy. It does make a very large quantity, it can be halved with 14 oz cans of tomatoes. would be great for a crowd.

I made this recipe last evening and my entire family loved it! I bought fresh arugula from our local farmer's market. It was mild and tender. Just perfect! I also let the sauce simmer longer than 30 minutes. It simmered about 60+ minutes. The sauce turned into a nice ragu. It coated the 12oz of pasta very nicely. Will keep this recipe around for a long time!

First of all; there is an excessive amount of sauce for the amount of pasta; I cooked 12 ounces of rigatoni and the pasta was swimming in the sauce; I would not make this for children; the sauce is very spicy (due to the hot Italian sausage as much as the arugula); my children did not like it (they like my own made up stuff better). I might try it with Penne; the smaller sized tubes would likely take the sauce up better.

This was easy enough to make but there was way too much sauce for the pasta called for. We split the sausage 1/2 hot and 1/2 mild as well

Not very exciting. I will make modifications to this so its not so soupy and generic. I did really like the arugula though. Basil and oregano were pointless though...arugulu overpowered it.

I needed an easy, make ahead dish to serve a crowd after a busy Saturday. This was well recieved from the youngest (8) to the oldest (80). Since I was serving 14 I had to adjust the quanities. I doubled sausage: one pound hot, one pound mild.I used two cans crushed tomatoes and one pound of pasta (mini ziti). I followed the recipe for other ingredients.I made the sauce ahead and when it came time to add the arygula I felt it was spicy enough for my crowd. The fresh basil was not that fresh. I did not chop it small enough and it had a chewy texture; not enough to detract from the dish. Quick, easy, and appeals to a wide range of ages.
