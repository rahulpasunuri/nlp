Incredible! These are really simple but the lemon zest adds a lot of flavour - a seriously good, satisfying sandwich. My only criticism is the tomatoes. I'm sure they're delicious, but... 6 - 8 hours in the oven? Must be an expensive energy bill for veg for a sandwich! I used the tomatoes from this Epicurious recipe (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Slow-Roasted-Tomatoes-241181), which are absolutely unbelievable and perfect for this sandwich, great after an hour in the oven.

Delicious! Followed the recipe exactly as written. The only change I made was adding a little bit of fresh mozarella melted on the baguette. Will definately make this again!

This was a great surprise recipe. It seems simple (and it is) but the end result is so delicious and complex. I am not the best cook but this was easy to make. I would salt and pepper the tomatoes more while roasting them next time and I would also try adding some garlic to them as well. The chicken was delicious with the lemon and rosemary in the breading and it was still good cold the next day. This is definitely a new permanent addition to our repertoire.

this is actually now one of my favorite meals to make! i dont make it as a sandwich, but instead just eat the chicken topped with the baked tomatoes (i add a little minced garlic to the tomatoes before cooking as well). i usually cook double the amount of tomatoes and eat them as snacks for the next few days!

I made the kid unfriendly version of this and have to say it was fantastic! I didn't have any rosemary, so I used some herbes de provence instead, and used panko for the bread crumbs. It was a little dry so I spread some aïoli on the baguette to lube it up.
