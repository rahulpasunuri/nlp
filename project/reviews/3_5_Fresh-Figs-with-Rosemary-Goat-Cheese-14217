Disappointing. Served it at a New Year's Eve party and it was probably the least favorite. Very bland. We added more rosemary to try to kick it up, but even that didn't do it.

easy and delicious. we often serve with apricot-onion chutney, but just as delicious with apricot preserves.

This was so delicious, elegant and simple. For a dinner party with passed appetizers, I roasted the figs and put them on toasted baguettes, very thinly sliced and put the cheese and then the fig. It presented beautifully! We had left over cheese which my family devoured.

A good change in ordinary goat cheese, which is very simple in prep and taste.

Since there are few ingredients, the dish depends upon the quality of ingredients - so don't skimp! But This recipe was unique and delicious - and easy!

Incredibly simple, incredibly delicious. Fresh figs are a must. Use some rosemary sprigs for garnish.

I followed the suggestions of mixing it up the day before and using proscuitto. I found it needed more cracked black pepper than I originally had thought, and I added some freshly chopped thyme too as it seemed bland. The day before we'd had figs broiled with a little gorgonzola and I much preferred that to this goat cheese.

On the first night I served these appetizers, I scooped about a teaspoon of the mixture onto fig halves, then topped with a toasted walnut half. Everyone loved them. On the second night, I'd run out of figs but had lots of goat cheese mixture left. I served it with warm bread rolls and enjoyed it even more. The flavours were ultra smooth on the second day.

I made a couple changes and it still was delicious - sour cream instead of regular cream, herbes de provence instead of rosemary. Making it the day before allowed the dried herbs to often. Enjoyed ir at our wine tasting group, paired with Sauternes-styled wines.

Fresh figs were going out of season, so I used dried dates and it was wonderful. It really helped cut the sweetness of the dates.

The rosemary goat cheese mixture is better after a day.

This is an absolutely fantastic recipe! An incredibly tasty and dramatic (and more importantly, EASY EASY EASY) appetizer to make. It can get a tad expensive (fresh figs are pricey in Canada!) if you're feeding a crowd, but definitely worth it for smaller gatherings. And like others have suggested, you should add a lot more cream to the mixture. Guaranteed to disappear quickly!

Delicious and very easy. I agree with the reviewer from San Mateo that the consistency was more like a spread than a dip. My fix was to spread each fig half with the cheese mixture before serving. This took no time at all since I cut the proportions drastically for serving two as an appetizer. These lovely figs would also be good as a snack or dessert, in my opinion.

Mmmmm... After I increased the honey and rosemary somewhat, I thought this tasted terrific. BTW, with the specified amount of cream, this recipe is of spreading consistency, not dipping consistency.

This made for a first-rate appetizer. My only alteration to the recipe was to quarter the figs (instead of halve) and wrap each with a strip of prosciutto. Even people who claimed to not be fans of figs or goat cheese asked for this recipe.

I needed something different with an interesting presentation so I tried this. I'm not a huge fan of either figs or goat cheese, soI wimped out on the goat cheese and used half cream cheese instead & added some finely chopped roasted almonds as a garnish. Everyone LOVED it!! The goat cheese fans said that they would have used all goat cheese, but I got many requests for the recipe!

This appetizer was just delicious- it made quite an impression on my discerning husband and our foodie friends the other night. I used brown turkey figs and topped each with a sprinkle of fresh chopped rosemary. I can't imagine that this recipe would be the same texture if made with dried fruit. Definitely will make again!

The simpler and fresher, the better, as this simple and beautiful recipe shows. Don't mess with it, just make it.

UNBELIEVEABLE. Simple, and impressive, wow.

This recipe was very popular, but I was a bit disappointed in the flavour of the cheese. Next time I'd use either a more pungent goat cheese or plain old cream cheese. The recipe worked just fine with dried figs -- dried dates and apricots might be good as well.

What an amazing flavor this dish has! I had to add a bit more cream to get the right consistency, but otherwise this was a snap to make and tastes fabulous.
