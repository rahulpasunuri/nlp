Ok, I haven't made this yet either, but it does look good. To all you out there who are sticking your nose in the air, if you pull it back down you can actually see the recipe. It is a recipe that uses left overs, which in my opinion are wonderful. This is an interesting way to use them up too. People who don't eat leftovers are really missing out, not to mention wasteful. I have been cooking gourmet meals since I was a teenager and am a self-declared food snob. That being said...before you say something nasty about a recipe try it. Jumping to conclusions is a bad exercise!

I think this receipe for LEFT OVERs has potential. I think I am going to use a part of an old English receipe that I have for a great Shepard's/Cottage Pie... and I am going to use this sweet potato idea...

Four Forks for the great idea of combining turkey, adobo and sweet potato in one dish. I am always wondering what to do with the what's left in the can of ancho chile's in adobo sauce when I make turkey chili, now I have a plan for the next time.

No forks, This recipe is for leftovers no matter what you say. Anybody can mix leftovers and reheat in a microwave.

If it helps, this recipe was listed along with 4 or 5 other recipes in Self as part of a "make ahead" series so you could have healthy, easy to prepare dinners every day of the work week. That's why there are microwave instructions. It was actually a good article and I can't wait to make the various recipes!

Is everyone clueless or maybe your computers work differently. Click on turkey loaves (it's in bold for a reason) and you get the recipe for turkey loaves. It's not a prepared food product you buy it's a recipe that makes 2 recipes.

Bizlady, if you had checked out the recipe you would have seen that the turkey meatloaf is a link to the recipe. This site often does this to save space.

No forks. This recipe is so not what I expect to see in Epi. I did, however, enjoy the reviews. Chef Steve...

Not only didn't I make this recipe - I CAN'T make it! I have no idea what a "mini turkey loaf" is! This is very disappointing because I love sweet potatoes and thought it sounded good. I would have made it, though.

A Cook from ??? Qualified? Gourmet closing? What? Huh? Happy Thanksgiving to our friends in Canada. I enjoy this site and recipes too.

Soo...you just throw your leftovers away?

What snotty reviewers! I haven't made this, but it sounds pretty good, and a great use of leftovers for a quick meal. I just laugh at all you people that think that microwaves are somehow a source of evil; all it does is make water molecules vibrate to add heat. It's not exactly the creation of Satan. I for one will try the turkey miniloaves which sound pretty good, and use this for leftovers. Gasp. As a working mom, I don't exactly have three hours a day to cook gourmet meals everyday. If only I had a personal chef...

Thanks for all the negative reviews from people who haven't even tried the recipe. Of course, I haven't tried it either, but I'm every bit as qualified to rate it as they are. And what does any of this have to do with Gourmet closing?

no fork as I wouldn't make this. To be fair though I think this recipe was included at this time of year to use up holiday leftovers. I wouldn't use prepared turkey loaf (read the ingredients) but would use chopped left over turkey. I'm in Canada and our Thanksgiving is Oct 12th so timely for us. Otherwise I love this site and make many recipes from it.

No forks! Wouldn't bother with this one. Cooking with leftovers is not what I picture on the Epicurious site.

Okay--full and fair disclosure--I'm reading this recipe through a lens of sadness at the news about Gourmet and thinking what is the world coming to--when my eyes fall up an ingredient list that calls for "Turkey loaves, smashed" and can not help but wonder if the recipe was posted as a joke. Wonderment that only increased when I read down and (albeit mistakenly) concluded that finishing the dish involved microwaving it for four minutes.
