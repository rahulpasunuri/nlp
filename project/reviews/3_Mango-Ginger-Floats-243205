I thought it was very ordinary. Next time I'll try ginger beer so that the ginger flavor will be there.

I had high hopes but this was quite a flop. The ingredients were better on their own. Bummer!

Very ordinary. Saving grace...very quick and makes for pretty presentation.

this is unbelievably refreshing and satisfying!! use ginger ale brewed with real ginger for an extra kick!

Used a Keitt mango, omitted the sugar, and used Trader Joe's Mango/Vanilla soy icecream (lactose intolerant friend visiting). Was absolutely wonderful, everyone (6 adults) enjoyed it thoroughly. The soy ice cream worked great in this dessert too, I plan on using it in the future too.
