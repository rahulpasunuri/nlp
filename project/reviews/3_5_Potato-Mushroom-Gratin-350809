Great recipe, super simple to prepare and looks beautiful. It was big hit at our holiday dinner and a couple people even asked for the recipe. Mine turned out a little oily, so I might reduce the olive oil next time. Use good quality parmesan!

I prepared this dish for our company Xmas party and it's a perfect party dish: a few ingredients, simple to prepare, you can make ahead, nice presentation, aromatic and delicous. Absolutely will make again.

This should come with the surgeon general's warning - "This dish will cause a heart attack with the cream and cheese but you must eat because it tastes so darn good!" We used the mandolin to make even potato layers and also sauteed some of the mushrooms to layer in with the potatoes. I also recommend putting garlic and thyme between the layers. In addition to the Parmesan, we also added in some fontina cheese for extra cheesy goodness. Lastly, we baked it for the first part the day before. Then on Xmas day, we brought it to room temp, layered on the rest of the mushrooms (not sauteed) and then baked it off. It's a great make-ahead dish for the holidays.

Amazing! Told by all it was the best gratin they've ever had. Only change was I made 4 layers. I made it a day ahead, did not cut into pieces, and reheated.

I made this gratin for a holiday luncheon at work last year. Followed the instructions exactly and used a wedge of parm I hand grated myself. I think that the sharpness of freshly grated parm really would improve the dish over using the kraft shaker can (one reason some reviewers might think this a bland dish...although I'm sure still delicious). Slice your mushrooms into three parts and you won't be overwhelmed by "too many mushrooms." This was the first dish to disappear at the party and you aren't going to regret making it at your next event. Follow the directions, freshly shred your own parmesan, and don't slice the mushrooms too thinly. This recipe is crazy good!

This is a perfect potato gratin. I did exactly like the recipe called for and made it a day ahead. Wonderful. It was a big hit.

I also had way too many mushrooms, but I sauteed the extra in some olive oil and garlic salt. Yummy! I made this dish as directed and it was excellent! It got rave reviews from the family and I will definitely be making it again.

I made this gratin to accompany our standing rib roast on Christms Day. Noting the suggestion of another reviewer, I did decrease the amount of cream and added more fresh thyme for flavor. I definitely plan to make this gratin again but will decrease the amount of mushrooms, perhaps by as much as half. Twelve ounces of crimini mushrooms was overpowering and I found it necessary to remove most of them from the top of the gratin. But be reassured that this is a simple, delicious dish that could easily be served as an entree.

I made this last night, w/o the thyme, it was not missed. (well maybe a little) I did every thing else exactly as the recipe stated. I needed way less cream and I had way to many mushrooms. I think that I may put some of the mushrooms inside the gratin next time. I also think that it would be beautiful w purple and yellow potatoes. This is a keeper for dinner or breakfast.

My sister made this for Christmas. She had said it was wonderful. I didn't think so. She substituted 1/2 and 1/2 for some of the cream, which made is rather runny. It seemed to lack flavor as well. Didn't find it worth the calories. SD gal

This was the highlight of Christmas dinner! I made it the day before but was leary of cutting it into pieces and then rewarming because the dish was so beautiful and I worried about the slices kind of slipping apart as they warmed. I took it out of the refrigerator and let stand at room temp for about an hour to take the chill off and then put it in the oven for about 25 minutes at 250-worked like a charm without overcooking it. This is a definite keeper.

I made it exactly as written and it was delicious. My favorite dish of the night! I used half of the mushrooms that it called for and completely covered my gratin. I did not need to add any additional cream (thankfully!).

There was an unexpected sweetness to it that worked for me in balancing the other flavors on the menu but was disappointing for some guests. An easy make-ahead dish; rather than cutting and rewarming, I added some whole milk to the top, rewarmed the entire dish in the oven and transfered to a burner to keep warm while the yorkshire puddings baked.

WOW. Really, really good. Too good, actually. I doubled (tripled?) the pepper, used 1/2 & 1/2, and had enough mushrooms to completely cover the top. This was one of two dishes I made for a veggie Holiday meal and the guests loved it. I just ate what few leftovers we had for breakfast (!).

Made this recipe with a few slight modifications and it was simple and AWESOME. Used my food processor which is thinner than the 1/8-inch slice; Used 2 cups of cream and 2 cups of milk to cook the potato slices on the stove, then used a slotted spoon to transfer/layer in the baking dish with the parmesan...then poured all the milk/cream over. Cooked 10 minutes before following the remainder of the recipe. A perfect complement to the herb-crusted rib roast!

A wonderfully creamy recipe. It was amazingly easy and tasted delicious. All my guests said it was one of the best au gratins they've ever had. A really cozy, comfort food dish.

This was a hit for Thanksgiving - followed the recipe 'as is' and found it to be quite rich and the garlic a bit strong. Next time, will cut back on the parmesan, cream and garlic and boost the salt and pepper.

I was very disappointed in this dish. After reading the wonderful reviews I thought I was in for a real treat. Instead I found the recipe lacking in flavor, very bland and just okay. This is one that I won't try again.

Delicious but rich, even when you use half and half instead of heavy whipping cream. Best in small portions.

I forgot to mention that I chilled it, cut it into squares and re-heated a single serving in the microwave. It turned out great, so I think re-warming in the oven would work well. Being able to make it ahead is a plus for me.

This is a really hearty dish. I did a trial run to see if I wanted to make it for a holiday dinner. I wound up using 2 cups of cream, which made it too rich, and with just 10 ounces of mushrooms, I had enough to cover the whole top of the casserole. I also added a small amount of six cheese Italian shreds and reduced the garlic to just one clove, minced and scattered over the top, since some family members are not keen on garlic. Next time I'll stick with just the parmesan and use less cream. Perhaps slicing the mushrooms thicker would give me just enough for around the edge. It has great flavor and I'll definitely try it again.
