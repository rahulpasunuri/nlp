fabulous--and so easy. i used whatever dried fruits i had around: cranberries, cherries, and raisins-- and i added crushed walnuts. served it last night at a dinner party and it was fantastic. oh, and make sure to cook it long enough that it starts to caramelize a bit on top.

I thought the recipe turned out great. I added a little brandy to the dried fruit mixture and substitued cinnamon for the allspice. make sure you test the apple with a skewer for doneness.

Great combination of flavors, but over an hour to cook. Try putting Apples in the microwave. Much faster.

This recipe is a standard for me. I have baked apples for years as a special treat. You can use just about any dried fruit combination for a filling, soaked in spirits if you like, and use honey or syrup instead of sugar. I usually use demerara sugar and find Red Rome apples give the best results. Red Romes are available late in the season and keep well in the fridge for 6 months or more. I serve baked apples with custard, but again, that is a personal preference. This recipe worked well although the apples sagged/slumped as usual. A nice change to use the cranberries- a first for me.
