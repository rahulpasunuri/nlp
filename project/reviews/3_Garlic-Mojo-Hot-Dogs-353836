I gave this 4 forks if and only if it is made with the recommended changes. I used even less than 1/2 the oil stated in the recipe. I used 2 tomato-equivalents of grape tomatoes. I let the sauce cook down to quite a thick consistency. I used a bit of pale ale mustard on the buns and added a bit of Spanish hard white cheese. I skipped the pineapple as just too much. Given all of this, it took way too many changes for the original recipe to rate 4 forks, but with the changes (or similar) this takes a hot dog to an entirely new level. Thus, I agree with the previous reviewer who said that such a promising recipe should not be rated down--just corrected.

Normally if I make major changes in a recipe, I don't like to give it a high rating. But in this case the end result is so good I'd hate people to skip the recipe because of low ratings, when with a few changes it becomes a really excellent recipe. So for the mojo: halve the oil, double the tomatoes, and simmer until quite thick. This turns it into a cooked mojo relish that can go on everything from shrimp to chicken. Wonderful. On the hot dogs...meh. Between the pineapple and the avocado and the lettuce, the mojo gets lost.

I made this recipe as written, except subbed quartered grape tomatoes for the chopped tomato. Other reviewers said the Mojo sauce was watery so I simmered it for a minute or two until the sauce was reduced to a nice relish consistency. Yum! I loved the sweet pineapple, creamy avocado and the brightness of the sauce on a salty hot dog! Made this with the Cheddar Leek Dogs from the same article - both are great easy and delicious ways to jazz up hot dogs!

Meh...I wanted to like this a lot more than I did. My family did a huge Hot Dog Bar for the 4th of July, making several of the selections from this article. This one was okay...avocado is good on hot dogs, but the Mojo didn't really stand up to the other flavors. The Cheddar Dogs with Cider Braised Leeks (from the same article) were much better...

I found the mojo recipe to be quite tasty.

This was a VERY good sauce... I don't know if I'd use it for hotdogs again, though. It made the bun kinda mushy. I think this would taste exceptional with chicken. And I would probably use 1 more tomato.

very fresh and delicious twist on hot dogs. the sauce is a little watery, due to all the juice. I saved what was left for a chicken marinade.

A little bored with the standard grilled dogs and tried this one, the combination of ingredients was surprisingly good. The sauce was a little oily when reduced, I think I would use less olive oil next time.
