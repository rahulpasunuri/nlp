I swapped the broccoli for water and it still worked.

I made this for dinner last night. It was good - even the kids liked it. I thought it had too much bread crumbs on top. Also, I used a bit more milk than the recipe called for because it just didn't seem wet enough. Next time, I might add some garlic for added flavor.
