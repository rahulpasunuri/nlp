I have made this recipe several times. When I made it with garden tomatoes, I added the salt. When I used canned tomatoes, I did not add salt. I cook Italian all the time and my family absolutely loves this simple recipe.

I didn't expect to be entertained when I read some of the reviews, but you gotta admit, some of them were amusing. The bashing, the bickering, the almost name-calling made me chuckle in disbelief. Folks, it's only meant to be a basic tomato sauce recipe...OK! Lighten up, kids. I'm a 67 year old grandmother and all my kids love my cooking, especially when I cook Italian. I guess I could be considered kinda online saavy because even I could figure out to just click on the hyperlink to get the recipe. I just thought I would look up a different version for marinara to try and this one intrigued because of all the reviews. It is basically like the one I usually make. I just added a couple of my favorite herbs and some red pepper flakes. It was delicious. It's almost like what I always make and it's close to what my wonderful Italian mother-in-law used to make. You can enjoy being a little creative with this basic Italian tomato sauce. Enjoy!

Wow! Can't understand all the bickering going on here over a good, basic "starter sauce". This sauce is exactly how my x's italian grandmother taught me how to make. You can tweak it however you want by adding whatever spices and herbs you prefer. I do use more garlic than listed but only because we love garlic. What good cook follows a recipe to the tee? It takes imagination to create things we love to cook and eat!

First off, thank you to the person writing in letting people know to click on the Tomato Sauce link. This recipe has been a big hit with my family, and I've been asked to make it many times over. I did ease off the onion and only added one instead of two. It's pretty heavy on onion. I also add all the sauce to a pound of spaghetti. Excellent recipe.

This recipe as-is, is very basic. I used it as a base, and tweaked it a bit, and had a very delicious marinara sauce. I added garlic, dried oregano and basil, and extra salt and sugar. My family enjoyed it, and I used the leftover sauce on my eggplant parmesan, which came out better than ever due to this homemade sauce. So, while this recipe doesn't stand very well on its own, with a little help, it was delicious, and worthy of a repeat.

This is a good VERY BASIC start for an Italian sauce as understood by most Americans. As is it is great for kids. Once they are fed,it is easy to "doctor it" according to your own taste. A true marinara is not much more than OLIVE OIL, GARLIC & DICED TOMATO. Lighten up enjoy some good food Bon Appe'tit

It was OK. but rather bland. How hard it is it to add a few extra ingredients? Also, your web designers should say click this link for sauce recipe. I was taken aback at first until i realized it was a link. However, I had to add some other spices wehn i made it, i tasted so bland. Basil, Parsley, and Oregano are musts, but I also like to add red pepper. Gives it a kick and helps boost metabolism.

The tomatoe sauce recipe is easy and simple, but i prefer some basil, oregano, and parsley in my sauce. It was kind of bland. How hard is it to add a few more ingredients? Also adding a bit of red pepper gives spaghetti a great kick.

There is a lot of confusion/acrimony about this recipe, which was included in a Gourmet Magazine article about dishes that can be made ahead (maybe on the weekend) and then incorporated into other dishes throughout the week. Click on the tomato sauce text for a link to that recipe.

Very good! A simple recipe that everyone can follow. If you're looking for the sauce to thicken a bit, try adding a can of tomato paste & then season to taste. Also the sauce that's outlined in 'Sausage, Cheese & Basil Lasagne' recipe is also very good with a can of tomato paste added to thicken everything up. Despite the other reviewers critical outlook on this recipe, cooking within your own kitchen & following recipes is a great way to become inventive & explore new paths of how spices really work in conjuction with food. Everybody needs to start with a basic recipe & this recipe provides that foundation. Heck!! Epicurious even has a recipe on how to pop popcorn on the stove-top. Seems relatively simple to some, but to others that only used the microwave method learning new recipes & ways on how to do things in the kitchen can be a bit intimidating the first couple of times. Especially, when the chef has high expectations on themselves to want to make things turn out. Welcome to reality, not everything turns out in the kitchen & not everything is 'cookbook'. That's why it's called cooking. Not everyone that cooks has been doing it for years. Today's generations of children generally learn to make food that comes out of a box, where you add water & heat & instantly you have a 'gourmet-boxed' meal. Recipes like this one teaches chefs of today & tomorrow that we need to have a solid foundation for recipes before we can explore new ways of spicing things up in the kitchen. Remember that cooking has always been a hands on activity.

Everyone is forgetting that sometimes the most basic ingredients with minimal prep is the most rewarding. My family loves this recipe as is and with slight variations. Enjoy it for what it is.

This is a very dull sauce with very little flavor. The tomato sauce recipe is very bland with litle flavor, not what I would call a Marinara sauce. Bad choice

Too bad there are ZERO forks to "click on." What an insult. I usually like the recipes I find on this site, but as the other reviews echo ... this one SUCKS.

Its hardly a home cooked sauce for the tipical neapolitan "Vermicelli alla Marinara". You will need: 1/4 cup olive oil, 1 clove garlic, 1 pod red pepper, 3 cups plum tomatoes, 1/2 teaspoon oregano, 1 tablespoon chopped parsley, salt to taste and cheese optional.

SPAGHETTI Ingredients: Organic semolina angel hair, organic muir glen roasted vegetable marinara sauce, split mushrooms (canned or fresh- split then sauteed and drained of excess oil) dried basil, parmasean cheese, lean ground turkey (or sea scallops- butter and broil until centers are white and then split each scallop into four peices) Cook the turkey in a pot and add garlic, salt, pepper, cloves, ginger, and a tinge of oil. When water has hit a boil, split semolina into thirds and boil for 5 minutes and drain immediately. Meanwhile, heat sauce and add mushrooms. Sprinkle basil over the tomato sauce and then finely grate parmasean over it. That's my spaghetti for those who were disappointed by this "recipe".

Ok folks, anyone who does not recognise a hyperlink should NOT be surfing recipes on the internet. How sad it os that there seem to be so many stupid people who love good food. All you www-challenged people out there who equated 2 cups of tomato sauce with canned should be canned yourselves! Try clicking on the BOLD, COLORED text in the recipie next time. Oh, by the way, I HAVE made a similar sauce and it is absolutely fabulous! Get with the 21st century, people! Thanks, Epicurious for presenting so many fine recipies. Perhaps the next one should be "How to Navigate the World Wide Web"!

Too often, readers misunderstand that the ingredient is actually a link to a recipe for that ingredient. This site's graphics relative to links are too subtle. Why don't you just say after the listed ingredient "see linked recipe"?

You must click on the "tomato sauce" link to access the recipe for the homemade sauce. They should have stated this and called it "marinara sauce" as the title suggests. Tomato sauce makes me think "can". I do belive the overall recipe is extreemly simple and easy. My 1 year old loves it!

When I was in college (most often hungry and broke), I made something similar, but I would at least add garlic salt, some pepper and maybe dried basil or thyme. My cooking has progressed since then. How could anyone view this as a legitimate recipe?

This is crazy - the "homemade sauce" is just canned tomato sauce with some cheese on top. Maybe epicurious.com is just testing us to see if we really look at these???
