I never knew that Ranch from a package was considered gourmet. I call it pre-package crap!

A winner! The potatoes have a nice buttery taste so you don't need to add extra butter. I did add some milk though.

If you want average potatoes, this is what you'll get. Personally, whenever I want gourmet potatoes, I add cream cheese, sour cream, garlic powder and some Ranch mix powder by Hidden Valley that you can buy in a package other salad. Even if you just added the ranch and sour cream alone, it provides for a really tasty flavour! I like to serve these kind of potatoes alongside of a tasty meatloaf.
