Delicious and easy to adapt. I added another leek, some cream and a little crisp bacon to top it off. I din't have the sherry so used a little balsamic vinegar instead.

It seems impossible to make chicken soup exactly to a recipe -- we all tweak it a bit! Here are my changes: First, I made my own broth with a carcass I'd roasted a couple days ago. That chicken had garlic, lemons and Italian spice in the cavity, so I didn't add any more garlic to the soup. Since I wasn't sauteeing raw chicken, I just browned the mushrooms in a separate pan (I used shitake and cremini). I also have a big bag of dehydrated leeks that I'd been trying to find a use for, so I just threw a bunch of those in the pot instead of using fresh. Because of the Italian spice on the carcass, I was a little cautious with the nutmeg and sage (dried) - I don't often cook with those two spices, and I was afraid of a clash, though the combination smelled good. Added some half and half, too. Result was yummy!

This recipe is quite nice once enhanced a bit. My husband and I couldn't get enough of the batch I made with the following changes: two large frozen chicken breasts, the whites of three leeks, 8 oz mushrooms, extra sage, extra nutmeg, lots of pepper. I added about 3 tbsp of whipping cream just before serving, and it added nice depth to the soup. On of the things that makes this soup so fantastic is letting the fond develop on the bottom of the pot when sauteeing the various ingredients. Oh, and the sherry is essential. THIS RECIPE IS FANTASTIC!!

I used the basics of the recipe as a jumping-off point--a quart of chicken broth, some leftover shredded chicken, two leeds, a large handful of crimini mushrooms, and added a little chopped tomato. Used seasonings as specified, and added a touch of rosemary. Then I put in a handful of ditalini for the last ten minutes. This makes it a lot less brothy and much heartier. Excellent quick soup.

For convenience, I use one large, frozen chicken breast. I usually use button mushrooms and I add a few pinches of dried thyme. Omit the cornstarch and add 1/2 to one cup Half and Half which mellows the flavors. This is a great, simple recipe that gives satisfying results and lends itself to "tweeking."If you have never made soup before, this is a good start.

Great basic recipe, but I would modify a bit next time. More leeks, as they reduce and get lost in the soup, and a little less mushrooms. Another pinch of nutmeg, and play with the flavoring a bit when completed.

Great recipe, but I would modify a bit to make even better. More leeks are needed, as they cook down and using the whites of only one leek are not enough to enjoy the flavor in the soup. Next time I will increase the nutmeg by another pinch as well, and increase the garlic a little. Good base recipe, but think it needs your personal "tweaking" to be really good!

This was an incredibly easy soup to make. I misread the instructions and only used white mushrooms. I have to say that, as I was watching the mushrooms cook and reduce, I was a little worried that I wasn't going to like it. The smell of the nutmeg and sage were very off-putting and the whole thing looked kind of gross. However, once the `shrooms started to cook and get smaller, and create a beautiful brown broth, things began to look up. As soon as the mushrooms had cooked through, I served it with some toasted rye & caraway bread and it was delicious! My fiancee said that it was the best mushroom soup he's ever tasted - and he loves all variety of mushroom soup. It's much heartier than it appears and makes a great winter meal accompanied with a green salad. I'm betting it's even better if you use a variety of mushrooms. Either way, enjoy!

How great being the first reviewer and give something such a good rating! This was an incredibly easy soup to put together. I misread the instructions and didn't use a "mix" of mushrooms. Instead, I just used large white ones. I must admit, as I was stirring the ingredients and watching the mushrooms reduce, I thought - this soup looks horrible and the smell of it was putting me off as well [my boyfriend, who loves mushroom soup of any kind, thought it looked gross]. However, once the `shrooms had cooked through, and I added the cornstarch, the whole soup took shape. It has a rich brown broth and the chunks of mushroom were cooked perfectly. We were both very surprised at how delicious it was [even with just one type of mushroom - although I bet it would be even better if you used a variety]! My boyfriend said it was the best mushroom soup he's ever had - and I thought it was great as well. Lovely blending of the sage and nutmeg. This one's now in my recipe book. A real keeper!
