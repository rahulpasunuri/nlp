Delicious! I used 1 T red chili flakes in place of the 8 chilies. Too much spice! I'll use 1/2 T next time. Also, some reviews said to double the spice mixture, I didn't find this to be necessary. I used skinless chicken breasts because that's what I had - Delicious!

My go-to chicken rub. I recommend dropping the chiles, and rubbing it on a full roasting chicken, into a 450F oven for 40 minutes. Delicious.

Delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, included boneless breasts and thighs. grilled for 6 min per side. husband loved it- just added salt. I added Lime juice and salt to the finished meal. Delicious, simple and in-house ingredients.

Sensational! We followed the gas grill method and the chicken was perfect. For sides, we served the Yellow Rice and Cucumber Salad, both found under the African section under Sides. Cannot wait to make this again!

Easy and deliciouswhat more could you want? I used ground cumin and coriander for easy prep, and just kept the caraway seeds whole. Also, I didn't have dried chiles, so I used red pepper flakes and it worked out perfectly. Served with tarragon zucchini ribbons and it was perfect!

So delicious. I made it fairly close to the recipe as written, except I didn't have caraway seed, and it was raining, so I cooked the chicken under the broiler. It turned out exceptionally well. Served with saffron couscous, and vinegared cucumbers. The paste would also go very well with a flaky white fish.

I found this too salty, but otherwise very good. I omitted the black pepper since I don't like that in quantity, but the rest of the spices worked nicely together. Rubbed it on halved chicken breasts cut into thirds and grilled 'em on mesquite. I think we need to cook them more slowly next time; ours weren't that juicy, but the pieces were small compared to the recipe. Perhaps that's why it seemed salty; we were getting more spice per bite of chicken than those using half breasts. I will definitely be using this recipe again!

Loved this recipe. Had all ingredients so made exactly as written except used boneless skinless breasts. The chicken came out juicy and tender.

Great paste! I don't usually comment, but this is excellent. Add some cinnamon and it works great with pork.

I have to admit this recipe came out just like the picture and it taste as good as it looked. I can't wait to make this again. Great job try it you'll like it.

If you like spices, then double the quantity. I actually prefer chicken legs with skin for this recipe--you can stuff the spices between the skin and the meat--if you cook breast and legs at the same time, you'll notice a huge flavor difference for the drumsticks. Really nice for the grill. And no marinating!

This was absolutely delicious! My husband and daughter could not have enough of it. The blend of spices was just terific. Didn't feel like using the grill but worked just as well over a stove top. This is definitely a keeper and will spread the goodwill to others

I did not care for this one, but the husband liked it. We both love spicy food, but I thought the caraway seeds were an odd item with the other ingredients. We used chili de arbol and they gave a good flavor with a medium to hot heat level. We did not smoke the chicken, just used the regular gas grill. I don't think the lack of smoke was the problem, though. We used boneless skin-on breasts and they were moist and flavorful. The skin and the rub were burned to a blackened char, but since we put a little rub under the skin, too, we got the full flavor even after removing the burnt skin.

Outstanding flavor. I rubbed it onto a rack of lamb and cooked on the grill. The sweet spice of the paste was perfect for the rich lamb. Don't be intimidated by the number of chiles. If anything, I would ease up on the cumin just a bit. Also works great on salmon.

I love the combination of spices here! Instead of grilling, I've roasted 4 chicken quarters in the oven at 375 degrees and they've come out well. The first time I made it, my partner said, "That's great! You can even add more of that spice mix!" so the second time I made it I doubled the spice recipe and he loved it again. Not for people who can't handle bold flavors; definitely awakens the tongue.

We aren't allowed a grill here so I tried it in the broiler which may have been a mistake, especially considering I used skinless boneless breasts. I don't think I will do that again but I can see the potential for greatness here. Next time I will definitely use chicken with skin and either a grill pan or the indoor grill I've been promising myself. Next time I will cut down on either the chilis or the black pepper since I thought it was way too hot (although Hubby loved it as is). Has anyone tried dry toasting the seeds prior to grinding??

We made this last night for some friends who are not very adventurous in the food arena and it was a huge hit! Used a variety of chilies to cut down the heat and omitted the roasting pan as our grill is rather small - it worked just fine without. I took the advice on several reviews and made a bulghar salad with cucumber, mint and dill (similar to the recipe on this website) to accompany it - GREAT combination of flavors with the spicy chicken.

OMG this recipe is heavenly!!! We loved it so much that we took a chicken breast to our upstairs neighbors so they knew what all the moaning was about down in our apartment. This is a must have recipe!

I have made this recipe several times and perfected it. You sear the outside in the hot coals before placing the chicken away from the coals and cook it indirectly. The flavors are exceptional and the chicken is moist. This competes with fine restaurants. No, this is better than that. I did use quality chicken from Whole Foods to start. Browning the skin at the start of this locks in the juices and produces a succulent bird.

I made this with half red chiles and half ancho chiles and served it with pork loin. The coriander flavor is great with pork. Dinner guests asked for the recipe. I will be making this again!

Made this last night and though my teenage son thought it too spicy, my husband and I thought it was really good. Definitely worth making again.

This is excellent! You don't need to change a thing!! I have made it twice now once with legs and thighs and then again with a whole chicken laid out flat (spatchcock) on the Weber....Tender, moist and delicious!!

This recipe is by far my favorite new use for the grill. I modified it only slightly: I used ground cumin and crushed red pepper instead of grinding them myself, and rubbed it into boneless, skinless chicken breasts. For sides, I like corn on the cob and a spinach salad with a lime vinaigrette, or couscous. Sauvingnon blancs seem to pair well with the spices as well.

This chicken is by far one of my favorite uses for the grill. I modified it only slightly: I used ground cumin and crushed red pepper instead of grinding either myself, and rubbed it onto large skinless, boneless chicken breasts. It turned out perfectly spiced and succulent. For a pairing, I like it with corn on the cob and a spinach salad with a lime vinaigrette or couscous and a sauvingnon blanc.

The flavours were awesome. Marinated chicken thighs for 2 hours....cut them into inch and a half pieces and scewered them. Barbecued on upper rack of barbecue at 375 for 35 mins. Served with mango salad and avocado salad. We loved this recipe....thank you epicurous for another wonderful dish.

This was delicious. We did not find it overly spicy at all, just a great combination of flavors. The leftover chicken tasted great on a salad the next day. Will try it on pork next.

Excellent flavor. I made some extra spice paste and used it to make a bulghur side dish to go along with the chicken. Sweated onions and garlic, added some potatoes and carrots and chickpeas along with the spice paste, bulghur and vegetable stock, cooked it till the bulghur was soft. Delicious !!!

Delicious combination of flavors. I substituted dried pasilla negro chilies for half of the red chilies for a more complex flavor. I used chicken thighs and rubbed the paste under the skin. Served with a nice cooling cucumber salad.

3.5 for sure. Delish! I ended up using some fresh chilis, and went overboard, but had I not done that, it was really quite nice with pork. And, since it's winter, I made it inside on a grill pan and the house smells fab! :)

Excellent. I agree with a previous reviewer that the chicken was tender, juicy and full of flavor! I put the paste under the skin as well and did not find the spice overpowering. Served with a mint raita that complimented the spices well.

Sooooo good. I've made this a few times already, using it on grilled chicken and on grilled filet mignon. I used fennel seed instead of caraway and added some fenugreek and was delighted with the results. It's EXCELLENT on grilled steak!

My picky son and hubby loved this and so did I. Absolutely delicious. Next time I would double the spice paste so as to have some to dip the chicken in. What a wonderful taste. Not too spicy just perfect.

If you didn't find this flavorsome then maybe you used old spices or powder instead of seeds because we found this to be plate licking delicious. Plus for a dinner party it was easy. I rubbed halved small chickens with the paste, then browned on the grill and finished in the oven while we ate our starters. Everyone raved.

I would only spread the spice rub on only one side of the chicken because of the strong flavors of the spices.

Followed directions exactly. At best it was just okay, won't make again, much better grilled chicken recipes out there.

This sadly didn't turn out for me so well. I found the flavor to be just too strong and over-seasoned for my tastes.. Maybe I prepared the rub wrong but I wouldn't try this one again

We got a new BBQ grill and used this paste on two chickens cooked on the rotisserie. It was delicious! I applied the spice rub about 3 hours before we started cooking, and the chicken was fantastic. People couldn't wait and were diving in as my husband carved the birds, eyes rolling in ecstacy. Yum!

Just awesome. 4 out of 5 in my family thought that it was excellent.

Wonderful blend of spices. I used relatively mild chiles ("3/10") because my husband is timid about hot food, but I think I will go hotter next time. Would be great with a cooling side sauce in that case, like a cucumber riata or tzatziki.
