This looks like a great recipe! I love scallops with ginger. The recipe in the link below uses diver sea scallops (and also includes a quick overview of how to choose the best scallops) in a super fast, fresh and easy Summer Salad with Seared Scallops, Mango, Avocado and Red Bell Pepper. It can be made in 20 minutes or less. Perfect for a hot summer day! http://hotandhealthyliving.com/2010/07/fast-easy-fresh-summer-scallop-salad-with-mango-red-pepper-avocado/

This was lovely. I did use vermouth to deglaze the pan, and my taste in lemon runs higher than the recipe calls for, but other than that didn't do any tweaking. A surprisingly flavourful dish for such a simple process. I served it with whole wheat spaghettini.

Uuummmm! I also took Michele's and others' advice: white wine, sesame oil, broccoli and other veggies - plus some cooked angel hair stirred in at end...and a splash of soy. Surely w/b good as written, but the extras worked for me!

I took earlier reviewers' suggestions & added more ginger, more lemon juice, a little bit of sesame old, deglazed the pan with vermouth....& it was delicious!

Since finding this recipe on-line, it has become a weekly favorite of my husband and myself. I do what Michele does, but deglaze with dry white wine instead of the vermouth. (don't have vermouth) I definitely recommend using the sesame oil and the whole lemon too.

Definitely needs more lemon, but we found 1/2 lemon was enough. I use a non-stick skillet and prepared the scallops with about half the fat. Next time I plan to try adding the broccoli suggested.

Well, Michelle, your revision of this recipe was great. The only thing I did differently was to zest the lemon before I juiced it and added the zest to the ginger, garlic, broccoli and shallots. I deglazed the pan with Pinot Gris. This was a delicious meal. I'd do it again and again.

OK gals, here's what I did with this recipe. I seasoned the scallops w/ s&p before sauteeing them as per the recipe. I deglazed the pan with dry vermouth and then added a touch of sesame oil and sauteed onion and garlic (didn't have shallots) with at least 1T of ginger. Then I added juice from a whole lemon and a bunch of steamed broccoli and put the scallops back in. Another hit of sesame oil, more s&p et voila! It was toothsome!

I'm dissenting, too. I thought it was very bland, and given the price of scallops, a waste!

very quick and tasty. making extra sauce is a must. I tried green beans with sesame oil and toasted cashews (or almonds) on the side, and thought it worked well.

Excellent. One of the best and most innovative scallop recipes we've seen. We used the large scallops and served it over rice. Making extra sauce is a must.

Well, this was a disappointment; especially with scallops being so pricey. Thought this was boring, my husband was silent through the dinner and usually is raving about anything I make. Don't waste your time.

One of the best scallop recipes I have made. Just the right amount of flavor without masking the taste of the scallops. I like to use the baseball scallops and agree with the use of more lemon to provide some extra sauce. I have made it one more than one occasion and it is always a hit.

I really enjoyed this fast recipe. I put in extra ginger (2 tbsp by mistake) and didn't dry the scallops first. Plus I put in extra lemon juice (1/2 lemon). This made extra sauce to soak up with bread. Great!

Served the scallops over rice, so a little extra sauce could be made and with a mixed greens salad on the side. It was very good.
