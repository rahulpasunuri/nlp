Oh yes. Agree with other reviewers. I seared the scallops first.

Used blood oranges which was nice for a bit of drama. I really enjoyed the recipe but found the sauce just a wee bit too thick being so sweet. Next time, I would use less sugar and cornstarch. And just drizzle it over the top of the scallops at the end.

I made this with half the sugar (as previous reviewers noted) and added some ground ginger and a little red pepper (we like things a little spicier) and this was TERRIFIC. The Star Anise, OJ and Leeks combined beautifully with the Leeks. We served over whole wheat pasta and it was a meal in itself. The only reason I didn't give it 4 weeks is the simplicity.. I finished this in 20 minutes start to finish and it's hard for me to give 4 forks to something so simple.

I loved this, but made a few changes. I reduced sugar to one Tablespoon. I sauteed leeks, removed them from pan, seered the scallops in the same pan, added leek mixture back in after the scallops were cooked.

From a taste standpoint, this recipe is 4 forks. From a procedure standpoint, it's a 2. The tastes of this dish are to die for. The delicate leek, star anise and orange (I actually used Clementine tangerines) are brilliant with the sweetness of the scallops. HOWEVER, I really didn't like the cooking method. By doing the sauce first, and poaching the scallops in the sauce, you never are able to get a good sear on the scallops for fear of burning the leeks, etc. In my mind this is a big duh-miss. I would use all the same ingredients, and just modify the method as follows: make the juice mixture as directed and set aside. Then heat your skillet and sear the scallops first to get a good caramel brown color on one side. Remove scallops from pan and then continue with the recipe as directed (Sautéing the leeks, etc.) Then, add the scallops back in the pan at the end to with the juice mixture to heat through. THEN you will have scallopy leeky orangey perfection!!

This is excellent, extremely easy, and did not need any modification

I believe in making a recipe according to directions first and then modifying accordingly. With that in mind, I, like another reviewer added freshly grated ginger to the leeks. I also found the leek/orange peel mixture needing a braising element so added some dry vermouth to prevent sticking. I reduced the orange juice mixture a little more than called for and loved the result. Served it over spicy sesame pasta and it was very nice. I think it could use another note of flavor...maybe a little crushed red pepper. It seemed slightly 2 dimensional to me especially if it wasn't served over a spicy pasta. But all-in-all a nice dish that I will make again.

A very good recipe when modified. I added some grated ginger and garlic to the orange juice and star anise sauce. As well, I added a touch of both ginger and garlic to the leeks. Both added a level of flavour and complexity that elevated the dish that my wife and I enjoyed. The only thing I would do differently is add a bit less sugar with the changes note above.

This is a wonderful dish. It is so fresh and "tastes of Spring". It certainly has an ASian flair, but sort of rises above a specific ethnic classification. My guests were dipping bread in the sauce -- all was eaten to the last drop. If you have big eaters, increase the amount of scallops, even for a first course. You need to present this dish carefully-color of dish should highlight the paleness of scallops and soft color of sauce or effect, despite the taste, is insipid upon presentation.

Much as I love orange and beef or pork in Chinese dishes, I felt the natural sweetness of scallops and leeks were overwhelmed by the orange juice and sugar in the sauce. At around $18 a pound, fresh sea scallops are precious in my neck of the woods, so this also seems a waste. Leeks and scallops, on the other hand, complement each other beautifully.

Made this exactly as recipe stated. It was easy and pretty good but I probably won't think to make it again because it didn't make a strong impression. The flavors were nice, delicate, nothing wrong with it, but not a wow.

I made this for my wife who is a scallop fiend. She thought they were the best scallops she'd ever had. She called her friend over, who almost assaulted me for not having enough for her. There were expletives of pleasure at the flavor. I've been harassed for several weeks to make this again. Guess I better run to the store. This was very, very, very good. Did I mention it was good?

I prepared this dish as an appetizer and the flavors were complex, but not overbearing for the scallops. My guests were very pleased with this dish.

Made this as a small course for dinner party - everyone raved!

A good recipe, but it can be excellent with some modifications. Cut the leeks thinner than 1/2 inch rounds, or they may not be cooked all the way through. And cut the sugar in half, or it can taste like a dessert sauce.

This was a show-stopper! The star anise perfumed the dish beautifully, and the flavors came together unbelievably well. The only place where I strayed from the recipe was in cooking the scallops: I removed the leeks from the pan and seared the scallops (patted dry very well)in the pan (very hot), then returned the leeks after both sides had browned a little. We will definitely make this dish again.

Outstanding! Easy and delicious. The leeks are mild enough to use with the scallops. This was the first time I'd used star anise and wasn't sure what to expect. The sauce was great.

Very, very good. But unless your leeks are extremely small, use only half of what the recipe calls for--otherwise you'll have a leek dish with a couple of scallops here and there. I'll also use a bit less sugar next time. Nice presentation possibilities, especially if you have big, unbroken star anise.

Excellent - wonderful flavous making a delicious first course. Would also be good for a luncheon by increasing portions and adding rice and a salad.

This is the most flavorable scallop recipe that we've had in a long time. Even more importantly, the recipe is true to its times and method of preparation. The Star Anise is a wonderful change. My guests are still ranting about this one!!
