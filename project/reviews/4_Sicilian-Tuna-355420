it's really just tuna putanesca. marinade is nice, but not noteworthy. as many have noted, this is a good, easy, healthy, natural recipe, but nothing spectacular.

Great for a weeknight dinner.

I would say this tuna is very good, but not delicious. It is great for a everyday yummy meal but not for a special dinner. I did not have too much time and only marinated for 30 min (what is also recommended in the recipe) and will try to marinade for longer next time. I used much more fresh oregano for this marinate but could barely taste it. I skipped the anchovies because my husband cannot stand them. Added much more garlic than required. The sauce is outstanding and I will even try on a bruschetta or with pasta. I didn't add any salt and don't think is necessary. I used the iron skillet for cooking the tuna, 2 minutes each side and was perfect.

I chose to make the sauce as a salsa -- i.e. uncooked. Other than that, followed the recipe exactly and it was outstanding. The salsa was fresh tasting, very Italian, and paired so beautifully with the marinated tuna. Plus all of the ingredients (except fresh oregano) were things I already had on hand.

Yammy!!! Me and my boyfriend loved it!! He said: 'it's light, but so tasty'. (yes!) With little changes: To make fish less fat I add 1 teaspoon of olive oil in marinade. I hate anchovy so I skipped them. I used dry oregano. I used lime and lemon juice from concentrate . Marinated fish for 90 minutes. Pan fried tuna instead of grill it. I will make it again!

Never had tuna steaks before, but a friend told me to just marinate in lemon juice and herbs and pan sear. Just before I started, I thought I'd check what sort of herbs might be best and found this recipe. Now, I did not have anchovies or olives in the house, and it seemed they were major players in this recipe. But guess what? Made without them, this was wonderful! I love the "salsa" of celery, tomato and capers. Will probably make this the same way again - it was better than adequate without expensive kalamatas and anchovies. Yay!

Great marinade! The flavors were spot on. I normally love the ingredients in the sauce, but it was missing something for me. Not sure I would bother with the sauce next time.

This is an outstanding recipe. I keep anchoive paste on hand, so used about 1TBSP of the paste instead of chopped anchoives. A nice feature of this recipe is that the grilled fish imparts the garlic flavor. I was surprised that the sauce had no garlic, but it was not missed due to the garlic in the tuna marinade. Those who sometimes find raw garlic in a fresh sauce overpowering, will appreciate this feature of this recipe.

I guess I thought I would tackle all the things I normally don't like in one dish hoping that it would be better for me this time - anchovies, olives, capers. It was way too salty and I still don't really like those flavors that much. The husband and son liked it well enough but I wouldn't make it again.

Easy to prepare and tasty. I made the sauce ahead and heated it through to serve. My tuna steaks were small so I added three large shrimp per person to the marinade and grilled them alongside the fish. Then served it all with polenta and a green salad, piling the salsa on top of the fish and leaning the three shrimp up against the polenta.

Super easy and super delicious! I love recipes that I can make from ingredients I normally have on hand and this one worked. I cooked the tuna in a cast iron skillet for just 2 minutes each side, we like it rare and it was superb. The marinade is light and lets the flavor of the tuna shine through and the sauce was thick and chunky (I may have cooked it too long?) but went perfectly with the tuna. I served it with quick cooking polenta that I baked with some pine nuts, raisins & parm while making the fish and then steamed sugar snap peas for a really simple, really good weeknight dinner.

Great flavor for a quick and easy meal. Albacore is not my favorite fish, but this was good. Good week day family meal, but would also be good to serve to guests. No changes to the recipe. Served with B.A. Roasted Cauliflower (good) and spring salad with feta, pear and roasted maple pecans. A bottle of Syrah completed the meal.

Easy, delicious, full-flavored. Ingredients, except for the capers came from my garden. One substitution: used Italian black olive paste instead of the anchovies. Wonderful.

Easy and delicious! The tuna in the marinade was very good, and the topping just added another layer of flavors. I was concerned that with the olives and capers, the sauce would be too spicy but cooking it just seemed to tone them both down. I used cut-up grape tomatoes which worked just as well.

This was really quite delicious. Full, complex flavors melded surprisingly well with the fresh fish. I don't have a grill so I pan seared the fish. Also didn't have any capers and can see how they would add just that little touch more of flavor. Still, very, very good! Served it up with a light quinoa and herb salad. Excellent summer meal.

This recipe provides so much flavor for so little effort that it is my #1 tuna recipe now. I used fresh albacore steaks and there were no leftovers.

This recipe is quick, easy, and full of flavor. I served it along side of mixed greens with some goat cheese crumbled over it. Just pour a little olive oil and squeeze some fresh lemon on your greens and you have a great lunch or light dinner entree.

wow, I think this is the best tuna recipe I've ever tried. The marinating makes it. Delicious!

I used anchovy wrapped capers - worked well. Leftovers were exceptional over greens for a cold salad but won't have leftovers often. Used fresh albacore caught off of Bodega Bay

Yes, very nice way to prepare Tuna. I added a splash of dry white to the sauce, and accented (on the table) with Mario's Habanerro olives to compliment for those who wanted an extra kick.
