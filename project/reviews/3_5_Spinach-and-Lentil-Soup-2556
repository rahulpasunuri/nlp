Used red lentils (they easily cook using the time ranges listed in the recipe). No salsa so opted for bruschetta with a tsp of cumin. Sauteed 3 cloves garlic with the onions and the celery and pepper was replaced with organic corn kernels. TASTY: Colorful, presents very well and filling. Will make again with salsa and balsamic!

LOVE IT! I was also suspect of the salsa but it adds a great kick to the soup. This is in our heavy rotation file. I use fresh baby spinach.

I didn't think much of this receipe. I think it would tase much better without the spinach. Spinach does not add much.

Really really yummy! My husband likes things very spicy so I added a bit more salsa. I also left out the spinach. We will definitly have this again

I used fresh spinach and French green lentils. What an awesome flavor. I was not sure about adding the salsa, but it added a nice kick. I also had a smoked pork shank that I trimmed of fat, chopped and added. What a great "empty your frig" kind of soup! Also, I did add 2 cups extra broth, as it got very thick. Italian crusty bread and freshly grated parmesan are a must!

i thought this turned out great, even with the spinach...a little salty if you use store bought stock (i used veggie stock)--it would be great with homemade...i threw in a clove of garlic and a bay leaf with the lentils like someone suggested...i also had a mixture of green and red lentils by accident--but the red go mushy so it made the soup very thick...used 6 cups of stock...crushed tomatoes as opposed to sauce...added some crushed red pepper when i sauteed the onion/celery/pepper combo...very filling and comforting soup-- sprinkled some parmy on top and served with crusty italian bread turned into quick garlic bread (toasted with olive oil/garlic and fresh parsely)...quite tasty and packed full of nutritional goodness...quick enough for an evening meal...looking forward to my leftovers for lunch today

I tasted the lentil mixture before I added the spinach and liked it better. The spinach made it bland. Next time I'll just make lentil soup.

My super-picky vegetarian husband declared this the best soup he's had. I added cooked orecchiette at the end and followed another reviewer's suggestion to add some splashed of balsamic and that made it perfect!

Delicious! Served this for a dinner party and got rave reviews. The salsa adds a nice spicy touch. Even though it's a lentil soup, I liked the lentils so much that I thought there should be a bit more added. I also used vegetable stock rather than beef stock, for the vegetarians at our table, and didn't feel the soup was missing anything.

Super easy and very good. I added 2 Tbls of Pickapepper sauce. Hit the spot.

This was a delicious soup, although I changed a few things. I boiled the lentils with a few cloves of garlic and a bay leaf. I also used chicken broth instead of beef. I used fresh spinach and some crushed red pepper for a little bite!

If you like lentils, this is a great soup. Very filling and low in fat. I used vegetable broth instead of beef and it turned out great.

I was unsure about this recipe when I read it, but given the reviews, I thought I'd give it a try. Even as I was preparing it, I doubted that my picky (but adorable) wife would enjoy it. But once it was ladled into bowls and served, I was pleasantly surprised. We both thought it was quite good (I made my own tomato sauce, used fresh spinach, and used pork broth instead of beef), and we'll be having it again sometime soon. Tasty, nutritious, low-fat, and filling.

Next time I will make sure I cook the lentils long enough. The 1/2 hour didn't cut it but the soup still tasted GREAT!. I added some spice to "kick it up a knotch". Will make again.

Best lentil soup I've ever tried!

This recipe needs about 6 cups of liquid. I also added some basil thyme and garlic powder to give it a little more zip. The key was adding a few splashes of balsamic vinegar at the end of the cooking process. My 6 year old devoured it!

This was a great recipe as is but I made it with homemade beef stock, fresh spinach, omited the salsa and the pepper and added carrots.Home made stock made it a four fork recipe!

This was a hearty treat on a cold February eve in Portland, OR. Try it with Chipolte salsa for a nice smokey flavour. Great topped with shredded parmesan cheese, or sour cream. Delicious with a microbrew!
