We really didn't enjoy this soup. It was just too dull. We were grateful for the crackers I had to go along with it. I have to admit, though, the color was gorgeous. I won't make again.

This is a very easy and delicious soup! I used tomatoes from my garden, and top quality balsamic. Make sure you use very flavorful fresh tomatoes, as the soup is a showcase for them. The soup freezes well, and has a very pleasing consistancy. It's one of those dishes that again points up that the best foods are those that contain very high quality ingredients!
