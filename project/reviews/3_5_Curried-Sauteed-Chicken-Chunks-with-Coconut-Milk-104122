This is such a great, easy recipe that uses Thai spices/seasonings wonderfully, but without being complicated. Perfect for weeknight dinners.

This was pretty good but extremely salty! I did season the chicken with salt which was a big mistake because with the nuts and fish sauce - much too much salt! Next time I would definitely not season with salt and use unsalted peanuts instead. Also - I would cook the nuts more to soften..Besides those to things - this is a nice quick and easy meal which I like:)

Great quick and easy dish, prepared twice now and getting better. Looking forward to repeating it with alterations as recommended. Definitely recommend using half fish sauce amount. Cashew vs peanut up to user's discretion. Can't wait to try with more veggies. We liked serving over quinoa.

just made this for the second time but used fried tofu instead of chicken. sauteed onions and carrots with the lemongrass and chiles and curry and then addd the tofu after the coconut milk was added. so good and took 10 minutes to make! i learned the first time to garnish with the peanuts instead of adding them since as leftovers, the peanuts get soggy and strange from sitting in the liquid overnight. this will now be a family staple and I plan to rotate proteins because this would be good with anything...

It was really simple and delicious. Great mid-week meal. I sauteed onions and carrots before the chicken, removed them and added at the end with the peanuts. Needed some vegetables. But flavor was lovely and a real comfort food favorite for our family.

loved it but made a few tweeks that made a huge improvement. added ver ripe mango chunks, and singed bell pepper chunks to the mix. also insead of the fresh chile or red pepper flakes. 1 teaspoon (maybe alittle more)Use hungarian paprika paste. add red pepper flakes or cayene pepper to taste (probably 1/8 teaspoon of cayene). also instead of cilantro I use a heaping spoonful of choped thai basil (from the can).

Rating: 4
was excelent forgot the cilantro through I did buy it will have to remember it next time. I added a spoonful of two of thai basil from the jar as I could not find it fresh in mine like they do in the restaraunt. In the restaraunts they usually add sightly charred red bell peppers which I added to mine. they also usually add mangos, though in one restraunt they had pinnapple instead in the mix. I put two very ripe mangos in mine. I did used hungarian chili paste in mine instead of the powder as that is what they do in the restaraunt and chili flakes for a little kick. my peanuts I roasted and finely choped before adding. The chicken like most asian dishes is best if you trim the fat butterfly the breast put ceram wrap over it and pound it with a meat mallet or hammer if you dont have a mallet before chopping it up. this dish is great with a bowl of white rice.

I have had this dish at multiple recipes it is one of my favorite thai dishes they normally serve it with a side of sticky steamed sticky rice. I asked the waitress and looked closely at the dishes before. there is normally little thai basil leaves in in as well as bell peppers and mangos though this time around I had it with pinnapple instead of mangos. the waitress said they use coconut milk, herbs and chili paste. i have a hungarian paprika chili paste from hunary which I think should do nicely in place of the choped peppers

Just finished making my first curry ever... i love what's in my bowl! Being a lil' Mexican girl from Texas, I don't have much experience with Thai or any kind of curry (unless you think Mole is curry) but OMG I love this!. I added ground ginger and some crunchy peanut butter b/c I didn't have fish sauce on hand. But it's definately not missing the flavor. Also, I added the salt at the end to make sure it wasn't over salted, which was a good idea bc my soy sauce substitution for fish sauce did the trick. I'm making this again to show off my MAD skills.

Rating: 4
A terrific and easy dish that will really hit the spot for any Thai cravings. I didn't have any fish sauce or peanuts on hand so I substituted 2 tbsp. soy sauce and 1-2 tbsp. smooth natural peanut butter, which made it a lot like a Panang curry. If you like peanut sauce, the peanut butter is a great addition. Also, adding some frozen veggies (I opted for a blend with green beans, bell peppers and water chestnuts) and some peas really stretches out the recipe into a few meals and makes it quite affordable. I made this for the first time last week and am already planning on making it again tonight.

Simple enough. I added cubed tofu, potatoes, cucumber, peanut butter (1tbs) and shrimp instead of chicken (adjusting cooking time for shrimp of course). Turned out amazing. Perfect basis for experimenting with thai style food.

Agreed with most other commenters: (1) Use half the amount of fish sauce. (2) Salt at the end and be delicate with it. (3) Use only a third of the butter. Will definitely make again!

I am a beginner cook and this was very easy to prepare and delicious to eat. I added potatoes and onions and used less fish sauce and it came out well. Easy dish to doctor to suit anyone's taste. I am planning on making it with tofu next to make it into a vegetarian dish.

Fantastic. Added 1 tsp to mustard and ginger. Used fresh, unsweetened coconut (just happened to have one I needed to use up). Also, 1 dried cayenne pepper instead of powdered pepper because I can control the heat better. My husband raved about this dish. Wants me to make it for company.

This is a gopod basic recipe that you can doctor up. Being Malaysian and having grown up cooking curries, one word of advice, never salt a curry at the beginning, always at the end. In this case, go with 1 T of fish sauce first and see how you go. It's too salty for me and I didn't even salt the chicken. I added shallots, 1 fresno chilie some grated ginger. I used nornal curry powder. Using Mae Ploy changes it into another curry altogether and that's fine if you liek it. I like this recipe because it's versatile and you can add your own flair to it. If you want a real Indonesian twist to it, add some peanut butter (I would do tha natural kind unsalted of course). Once again, it turns into a different kind of curry. Good luck!

1. Omit the salt & use unsalted peanuts. If too salty, add a cubed boiled potato. 2. Fish sauce adds depth. 3. Cook the chicken in small batches with lots more curry (2TB) & drain each batch of chicken on a paper towel, then added them back to the pan. 4. Put curry in a covered dish in the fridge overnight. 5. Serve over rice with assorted condiments to pass, our family tradition: fresh pineapple, coconut, mangoes, sliced bananas, mandarin oranges, candied ginger (diced), chutney, peanuts (if they weren't in the curry). Serve with sliced cucumber & yogurt dressing as a salad. Now that's a meal! Many thanks for this recipe which brings back memories of my Grandmother.

I first made this recipe in '03 & followed the advice of a previous reviewer "...This recipe was delicious... but I must admit I improvised a little. Instead of regular curry powder... I used Red Thai Curry paste (3 Tbsp), a whole stem of minced Lemon Grass, 2 cups canned Coconut Milk, 4 minced Shallots, 3 minced Garlic cloves, (Shollots and Garlic sautéed in oil at the begining), 1 can of diced baby Pineapples, and 1 Red Pepper cut julienne style..." It is a favorite among our friends & family. We switch between the red & green thai curry paste & we LOVE the fish sauce. I highly recommend!!!

Liked it. Added pea pods, garlic, ginger and a diced jalapeño instead of crushed red pepper. Also used red curry pasted instead of powder. I thought that the fish sauce was a little strong, I might go with just 1 tablespoon in the future.

This recipe was great. I added a small diced onion, a giant handful of shredded carrots, about 5 large sliced cremini mushrooms and one small diced zucchini. I used the whole can of coconut milk (I used light coconut milk) and served over rice. It was wonderful, easy and could have easily served six. I'll definitely make this one again.

I used this as a cooking class with my seven year old son. He's a chili-head, so we used red-pepper flakes, and I don't do cilantro so we substituted a cup of basil instead and topped ours with salted cashews. Also added a 15 oz can of pineapple chunks in juice (drained the juice). Used half the fish sauce called for, plus a little tamari and sesame oil, to make it a little less exotic for my son. Got two thumbs up from him, and we'll definitely make it again, esp. in summer with garden basil and our own hot green chilis. Had green beans on the side but they'd be a good addition, as would baby corn and red bell pepper. But excellent as is.

I've been making this for my husband for almost two years. Usually without any nuts, we don't think it needs it-and we don't have a lot to spend on dinner. We are always trying curry recipes-trying to find something that compares to our favorite Thai eatery. Because we are aiming for that flavor we usually add more curry powder and butter. I couldn't tell you how much-it's a taste as you go situation. I tried to warn my husband not to smell the fish sauce, but his curiosity won out. DON'T exclude it though! The flavor is worth the smell.

I made this with scrod instead of chicken. My husband and I LOVED this dish, but beware of the delicious fish sauce - makes it extremely salty. I love salt, but would add maybe 1/2Tbsp less next time. Will make this one with a jasmine rice side over and over again. Delicious!

I used 1/2 a pound of chicken and marinated it with 2 tablespoons of red curry paste. Then I cooked 1 small potato and about 10 petite carrots and about 3/4 c. of peas. I sauteed all of it in one can of light coconut milk (14 oz) and added a zest of one lemon, 1/3 c. of peanuts and about 1 tablespoon of chili paste. I served it with jasmine rice.

I made this dish for a family gathering and everyone loved it. I was concerned about the strong smell of the thai fish sauce, however, once the sauce cooked, the smell was not so overwhelming. Not having lemongrass available, I used lemon zest. I also forgot to add the scallions, but the dish was wonderful all the same. It was quick and very easy to prepare.

I really liked this dish and so did my husband. I would make it again. I did use Madras curry and I used a lot more than the recipe called for. I didn't have lemon grass and I didn't add the red pepper flakes but I did add ginger. I used "I can't believe it's not butter" and olive oil for a low fat version. I also used light coconut milk and I added a red pepper and snow peas. I would add garlic if I made it again.

Fantastic recipe and super easy! I did substitute a green curry paste (Thai Kitchen) for the curry powder. My husband said the curry was better than our local Thai take out! I did make one mistake....I'll leave out any additional salt next time. The fish sauce and nuts added all the salt that was needed.

The result was amazing and please at least try switching the curry with Red Thai paste (for a change... if you have already tried this recipe and want to make it again but with a twist)... and adding the pineapples and red peppers.

Excellent! And not too difficult (that is, after I had rounded up all the ingredients.) I had to make my own coconut milk, as I have no idea where to find any over here. As for fish sauce, forget it. I used soy sauce instead. And cayenne pepper instead of red pepper flakes, which I couldn't find either. The final result was really good, even in my opinion, and I am not a great curry fan. My husband, who is, got really excited about this recipe, which I prepared for his birthday supper. I reduced the curry (being a coward when it comes to heat) and only used about 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper. I think I was a bit too cowardly and next time would definitely use more. At any rate: this recipe is certainly a keeper.

I thought that this was a great quick curry. Living in Italy, it is almost impossible to find all of the ingredients. I followed some of the other advise to add enough curry to coat the ckicken. I also added a bit of cumin and cinnamon. We don't have cilantro, so I added basil. I had to do without the lemongrass and the fish sauce, but it was still tasty. I also added potatoes, an eggplant, and a red bell pepper. I served it with balmatic rice. My husband has never had curry and found this good. I will make this again!!!

Clearly this needs some more heat, add more curry to taste and more fresh hot pepper. I served it with chopped peanuts, green onions and toasted coconut. It is a nice, very easy meal and tastes fantastic. Also, this is not a traditional curry recipe, it is a "simple" version.

I made this for company and was disappointed. The guests insisted it was very good and my husband loved it, but I felt it was a little bland. I added turmeric and extra curry and kept to the recipe for all other seasonings. I also added stir fried quartered mushrooms, red bell pepper and onion to make it a little heartier. I love curry dishes and just think there are much better recipes out there. I will say it was easier than mose curries, but without the payoff

This is definately a "family favourite" in our home. I too adjust the seasonings to taste and thicken the coconut milk either by reduction or by adding some powdered coconut milk to the canned. I also omit the oil and cook the chicken in the thick coconut cream that rises to the top of canned milk (cook alone in pan to draw out the oil first). I usually serve with basmati rice that has been cooked in chicken stock with cinnamon, cumin, corriander and kafir lime leaves. It is a great last minute company meal or weekday dinner

I was surfing to find a recipe for the chicken and coconunt milk I had when I came across this recipe. I read the reviews which helped in my preparation. Taking the warnings to heart, I added 2 TB of commercial curry powder, used 3 TBS of jalapeno pepper that I had, plus the red pepper, didn't have the nam pla, and used dried cilanto. The warmth increased as we but allowed for the favors to come through. I would make this again, it was easy, but I can see how the original recipe as is would be mild.

A very disappointing recipe especially coming from Vongerichten and Bittman. I have their first co-authored book and have been very pleased with the recipes in it, especially the rabbit curry. However, though I made Vongerichten's own curry powder for this recipe it was bland and the sauce far too thin. I was puzzled at the 30 minute preparation note as the curry only cooks for several minutes and the prep work (if you use already prepared curry powder) is minimal - 15 minutes maximum. Perhaps the chicken should be removed after step 2 and the sauce reduced to thicken and intensify the flavors. Finally, 2 tablespoons of nam pla is a bit overboard. Start with 1 tablespoon and add more to taste as fish sauces vary greatly in taste and salt content from one brand to another.
