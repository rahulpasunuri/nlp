LOVED the flavors. Used this to make a soup by adding chicken stock to desired consistency and then pureeing half to three-quarters of the squash mixture. Added spinach to top of soup in each bowl instead of cooking it into the soup. This will now be a standby for a Thai-style soup.

The final product was three forks, but the dish as the recipe is written is only "good" (2 forks) not "delicious" (3). It was comforting but blah, so I added extra red curry paste, a couple of extra cloves, twice the fish sauce, and a tablespoon or so of ginger. Doctored up, it was really good. I would never have thought of doing this with squash, but I will do it again. Be sure not to forget the lime!

Yum. I really enjoyed this recipe, and must say that it's the leftovers of this curry that I've enjoyed the most. I used blanched kale instead of the spinach, almost an entire jar of red curry, a little extra fish sauce, and garnished with roasted peanuts instead of cashews. Served over barley, which gave it a really nice, chewy texture.

This recipe is easy and delicious. I always forgo the fish sauce, and it is perfect!

I signed up for Epicurious just so that I could review this recipe, to dispel any fears you might have based on negative reviews. It is TO DIE FOR!!! I'm a huge Thai curry fan, and this was better than any curry I've eaten in a restaurant. Okay, so I really love both squash and coconut, and I know that there are those out there who really don't like one or the other or both (I'm closely related to several of the later camp). So, if you don't like squash or coconut, maybe you're not going to enjoy this recipe so much. Also, I have to agree with other reviewers who said that the quality of your curry paste will really affect your final product. I have personally used the Thai Kitchen curry powders before, and frankly, think they're rubbish. I used the Maesri brand Panang curry for this dish (the entire 4oz can, maybe 3-4 Tbsp), and it was truly delicious. To those reviewers who didn't like the more "Indian" curry spices of cinnamon, cumin seeds, and cloves, I really have to disagree. Although I thought it was a little strange while I was reading the recipe, I really thought these spices added a special depth to this curry. If you use ground spices in the place of the whole ones called for, I wouldn't doubt the results being disastrous. Finally (I know...you weren't planning on reading a novel), I would like to pass on a tip. DO remove the cloves BEFORE you add the spinach. I debated about doing this, and really regretted not, when I twice bit down on whole clove (yuck). So, save yourself the unpleasantness.

We made this for vegetarian company so omitted the fish sauce, and it was still delicious. Next time we'll make it with the fish sauce and I'm sure it will be better. It goes great over brown rice and makes plenty of leftovers.

Only change was lite coconut milk; still came out delicious, but very heavy I found. Leaves us with lots of leftovers which is okay. Might try it with chicken next time. Like some others have mentioned, you could certainly experiment with the curry heat...I could have used an additional Tbsp or more.

Really good supper dish! Subbed Trader Joe's 11oz. bottle of red curry sauce for the coconut milk + red curry paste. Still added the water, though. Will definitely make this again.

Excellent weeknight dish, agree that amount of coconut milk can tolerate bumping up the red curry paste to your taste. Speaking of which, Thai Kitchen is fine if you don't live in a city, but otherwise look for Maesri (canned) or even better the fresh frozen kind imported from Thailand, if you really want it to taste like takeout. I found the cinnamon/clove/cumin addition fairly mild but definitely made it more interesting - I wonder if the people complaining about its strength were substituting ground spices, because when I served this dinner my friends hit traffic and it ended up sitting on the stove for an hour before reheating and putting in the spinach, plenty of time for the cinnamon and cloves to take over if they were going to have an insurrection, and I can confirm they remained gentlemanly.

I made this for my bosses and it was exceptional. even the kids were asking for more. I only added 3 tablespoons of curry instead of the 1-1 1/2 the original said. Also try peppered cashews. Delicious. I will make this again and again.

Made this tonight with lite coconut milk and it was great. I didn't have fish sauce so I just added some lime juice at the end and a bit extra salt to make up for it. Overall nice weeknight dinner.

I loved this recipe and found it a perfect balance of flavors. Unlike the other reviewer, the consistency of mine was creamy like most Thai curry dishes, because I browned the squash long enough that it was not too spongy to soak up sauce later. Did use yellow curry as its my fav, and will add shrimp next time. Will make again and again! Make sure you have enough liquid to cover the squash, as it is what makes it soft when simmered. Try it its an excellent warming, spicy winter dish!! You won't be disappointed!

Unlike some of the other reivewers, my husband and I liked the flavors with the cumin and cinnamon and cloves. The problem was the consistency. I was expecting it to be rather liquid like other thai curries, but the butternut squash soaked up virtually all of the coconut milk so the end result was thick and gooey, something on the order of hot oatmeal. I probably won't try it again, but if I did, I'd use a third of the amount of squash indicated.

Unlike some other reviewers, my husband and I liked the flavor mixture of cinnamon/cloves/turmuric, but the consistency was bad. I was expecting something rather liquid like other Thai curries, but the squash soaked up all of the coconut milk and the resultant consistency was something on the order of oatmeal. If I were to do it again (which I don't think I'd do), I'd use a third of the amount of squash.

I've made this recipe twice and thought it was very flavorful and tasty. My friends gave me rave reviews and wanted the recipe. I didn't use cloves only because I didn't have them. I'm sure the recipe would be even better with cloves.

A rare disaster from Epicurious. It was far too spicy, between the curry paste and the cumim/clove/cinnamon combo. And the overall over-spiced flavor completely overwhelmed the squash and spinach; I couldn't taste them at all. We threw the leftovers away (almost unheard of around here!)

A nice dish, but I think it needed some changes. Made it as written once. The spices are more like southern Indian curry and the fish sauce is more Thai. Putting them together made for, in my opinion, weird and muddled results. The flavors didn't layer well. The second time I cut out all the spices other than the curry paste (so no cumin, cloves, cinnamon) and mixed the fish sauce with some lime juice and brown sugar as other cooks did. I thought the flavors melded much better. I'm sure you could go the "Indian" route as well, and not include the fish sauce. If I'd had some thai basil, I would have used it. Kaffir lime leaves would have worked too, or maybe some lime zest. Had cilantro on hand, so used that as a topping. Lite coconut milk works, but be aware that it won't behave quite the same way as the recipe indicates. Tastes fine, though. I addded some chicken for protein as well. Red peppers would also be good.

This dish sounded like an interesting use of winter squash, but it proved heavy, with strange texture and flavor combinations.

I thought this recipe was fabulous! I did add garlic, salt and pepper. I will definitely make again! I'm still enjoying left overs.

This was fantastic! I used lime juice in place of the fish sauce and it was still sublime.

We like spicy, but I'd reduce the Thai Curry paste as it was extremely hot. Lite-coconut milk was fine. Agree chicken or tofu could be added, but it is a tasty meatless meal. Also adding chick peas would work.

Thought this was a good concept but really needed an extra kick, even though I doubled the curry paste. Next time I'll double the spices (esp. the cumin), use some fresh ginger and garlic, and add more salt. Roasting the squash might also be better, to get a sort of caramelized edge. Next time I will serve with cilantro on top in addition to the nuts.

FANTASTIC. If you don't have fish sauce, add a tablespoon of lime juice. It's wonderful, easy, and DELICIOUS. Will definitely make this again and again.

Tasty, easy and fast. I used half butternut squash, half cauliflower. I also added a clove of garlic and half a red pepper, diced, to the onion saute. Used chard for the spinach. Will definitely make again.

This recipe was easy and great for fall. I would definitely add more salt next time... maybe after the fish sauce to taste. Also, I prefer my curry a tad spicier. Next time I will add some dried red chili pepper flakes to the onions while they are sauteing for an extra kick.

If you purchase already cut up squash, this is a snap, and it's a little unusual despite the simplicity, because of the squash. I used some scallions for crunch instead of the cashews, and used only about 3/5 of the can of coconut milk, and some extra water. This was plenty, and I'm sure light coconut milk would be fine.

I omitted the fish sauce and otherwise followed the recipe. It was easy enough for a week-night dinner, but good enough to share with friends. We'll make this again.

Cumin?? I don't think of that as Southeast Asian. This dish tasted good but was a little heavy. So I think I am going to be using this as a filling to wontons/ravioli. Next time I would absolutely leave the cumin out. Maybe substitute ginger.

Good easy weeknight recipe. Next time I'll add tofu or chicken and increase the red curry paste. I made it with lite coconut milk and nothing was lost.

This was wonderful. Made it according to the recipe. I heartily recommend the cashews--don't leave them out if you have them!

This was good. I made it with acorn squash and lite coconut milk, skipped the cinnamon, cloves and cashews, and added a little brown sugar and finished with chopped cilantro. Easy, healthy and very filling.
