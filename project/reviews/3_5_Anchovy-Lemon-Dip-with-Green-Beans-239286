This dip is really, really great. I agree that it has all the seductiveness of a bagna cauda. I made a mistake and cooked all the sour cream with the anchovies---didn't seem to be a problem. The only anchovies I had in the house were rolled around capers. Pureed with an immersion blender instead of forcing through a sieve. Didn't bother immersing the beans in an ice-water bath---just rinsed them with cold water. This dish is so darn good.

I followed the recipe exactly and the dip was quite runny. It's super-pungent and because I love anchovies I love the taste, but I'd omit the water next time.
