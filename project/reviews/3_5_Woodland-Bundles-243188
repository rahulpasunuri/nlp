this is an interesting combination and generated the most..."what is this?" from my guests. I served the bulgar filling on endive and on cucumber rounds because the mount of work to roll into the lettuce leaves seemed too much. Not the most popular item I served, had a few left over but I think it is because it is a really substantive and filling little appetizer. I bought dried dates by mistake and used them and golden raisins instead of the currants - which I dont think mattered as much because the stronger taste elements came from the trout, pinenuts and bulgar. I smashed my pinenuts after roasting so that the filling would be more cohesive.

I make this all the time, both for parties or whenever I need to eat healthy. It's simple, delicious, and filling. I find the lettuce wraps cumbersome, so instead, I serve it on endive "bowls".
