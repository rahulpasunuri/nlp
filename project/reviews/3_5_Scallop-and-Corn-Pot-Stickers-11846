It was ok. You need to add more seasoning - some more salt and I would add garlic and sesame oil. Otherwise it's a little boring.

I was a little worried about my ability to make these, especially since I have no experience with tofu, but they could not have been easier! And they were gobbled up in no time flat. Will definitely whip these up on a regular basis.

FYI...fresh coriander is more commonly known as cilantro. Hope this helps.

Great with shrimp or scallops. Our foodie friends were impressed when I made these for New Year's Eve. I used square wonton wrappers, following the wrapping directions in the package.

with the addition of cilantro and shrimp instead of scallops this has become a favorite!

These are more beautiful than they are delcious, but make killer dinner-party fare. And they are so easy to do ahead, freeze, and then re-heat when guests arrive!

I made this recipe as a starter for an asian style dinner. It was a sensation, and I have made it at least a bazillion times since. I use shrimp instead of scallops. I lost the recipe and thank goodness located it via epicurious.com! It's the best!

I made this as an appetizer for an elegant New Year's Eve 2000 dinner party. I used shrimp instead of scallops. I couldn't find fresh corriander so I used a dash of dried and threw in a little tobasco, soy sauce and a couple of drops of sesame oil. EXCELLENT!!

I did this as an appetizer for a catering and it was the hit of the party. Fresh corn really adds a lot to the texture. shrimp instead of scallops works well, also.
