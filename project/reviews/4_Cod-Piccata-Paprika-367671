Delicious and easy. I didn't substitute anything.

This was very good. Cod can be difficult to flavor, but the smoked paprika and almond flour gave it incredible flavor. I used only olive oil, and I also replaced the kalamatas with capers, since I didn't have kalamatas on hand. I will definitely make this again and again.

This was very good. I use Almond flour with my baking so I thought this would be good and add a bit of a nutty flavor to the fish. I used more smoked paprika and sauted the wild cod in olive oil and a little butter. I wouldn't consider it spicy. Definitely will make again.
