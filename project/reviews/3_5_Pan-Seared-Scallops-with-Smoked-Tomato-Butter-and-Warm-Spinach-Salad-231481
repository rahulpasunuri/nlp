I didn't have time to make the smoked-tomato butter so I used sun-dried tomatoes instead. Softened butter then mixed in tomatoes and put in freezer for about 15 minutes while preparing the rest. I added caramelized onions and mushrooms as another review had mentioned... very good! I served the dish in individual 6" cast iron skillets on wood boards, it was a nice presentation and room on the side for crusty bread. I will definitely make this again.

When I have a lot of tomatos in Summer and I've got the bbq fired up I smoke the tomatos and make the butter. Then put it in the freezer - it lasts and then this recipe (at least the scallop part) is a scrumptious cinch.

I keep trying to review this recipe and all that happens is that I keep getting asked to rate it. Frustrating!!

This was awesome. Be careful w/ the scallops because adding them back into the salad in the oven could overcook. I carmelized some onions w/ balsamic vinegar and added mushrooms. If you have ever wondered how to get a "wilted" spinach salad without having to use hot bacon dressing, this is it. Fabulous and low fat!!!
