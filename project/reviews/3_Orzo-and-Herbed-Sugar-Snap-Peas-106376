I decided to serve this cold as a salad since it's a hot July day. I also added garlic for a kick and used dried dill instead of fresh. I probably added more salt than what the recipe called for, but that's my vice. It's a nice, refreshing side.

I took a few liberties with this recipe...I added crumbled bacon and feta cheese. It was great!

Nice side dish, liked the pasta/crunchy vegetable combination. Served it with baked fish, it went with the fish very well. Always like finding low fat recipes that taste good.

As the previous reviewer noted, this dish is an excellent accompaniment to the Baked Red Snapper with Avgolemono, which can be found at the following Gourmet link: http://eat.epicurious.com/gourmet/low_fat/?/gourmet/low_fat/april02.html

This recipe is provided as part of a menu, so try it with Baked Red Snapper with Avgolemono and you will not need calf's liver or feta cheese.

Served this with calf's liver and onions, a once a year treat. Did't read the previous review, but guessed that the recipe was too bland so I added feta cheese at the end and olive oil to my dried dill and onion/elephant garlic mince since I had no scallions. It was good with the liver and my guests ate it happily.

This recipe was really bland. I added some lemon juice and about a tablespoon or two of very good extra virgin olive oil to spruce it up at the end, but it still needed something extra. I realize this was a low-fat recipe, but it just didn't have a kick. It was very easy though, and with some modifications (maybe some feta?), it could be quite good.
