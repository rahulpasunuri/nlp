This was delicious. Instead of sauteeing the vegetables, I roasted them in the oven prior to adding them to the broth, herbs and couscous. I agree with another reviewer, go light on the oregano. Also, I forgot to pickup the artichoke hearts at the store...it was fine without them.

I learned the hard way that the size of the pot really matters with this recipe. I was too lazy to drag out my big Le Creuset dutch oven, dubbed the Orange Monster by my kids, so I started off by using my 4-quart All-Clad pot that I usually use to make couscous. The vegetables started to get mushy, because they were crowed in the pot and were steaming, rather than cooking properly. I realized what was going on, so I quickly transferred them to a baking sheet, spread them out, and stuck them in a hot oven. They never really did get quite right, though. Next time, I will roast them from the beginning, and then mix them in the couscous with the other ingredients.

This recipe was very easy and great for having as leftovers. Next time I'll just cut the oregano in half, it was a bit overpowering. I also added toasted almonds.

I really enjoyed this recipe, but it was a little shy on the herbs. I added pine-nuts to make it a little heartier to serve as a vegetarian entree. Some Kalamata olives were a nice garnish and added that touch of flavor that I felt the recipe lacked.

I've made this numerous times and it's been a hit every time. I add chicken and use a Meditteraean Curry couscous box -- this adds more flavor.

Found this to be a very good and easy recipe.

Very good served with Lemon-oregano Chicken, and I think the leftovers were even better the next day. I made a few alterations -- I grilled and then chopped the eggplant, zucchini, and onions (although I still sauteed some onions as well), and I used Israeli couscous, which is a much bigger grain and had to be simmered for about 10 minutes. Next time, I think I'll add the *tiniest* drop of Dave's Insanity hot sauce; it won't be remotely Greek, but I think a little bit of heat and the smokiness of the habanero will go nicely with the grilled vegetables.

I have made this dish numerous times and it has turned out to be delicious. It may turn out gummy if too much liquid is used or not enough couscous is added. I find that adding cashew nuts and raisins, in addition to the cherry tomatoes and feta cheese really make this dish superb.

I made this dish exactly as described and I thought it was delicious. I don't know why the other persons came out gummy. Mine was fluffy and tasty. My only change was using canned artichoke hearts, quartering them and adding them with the tomatoes. A very refreshing dish!

This was terrible. We managed to choke down one serving, but it made several more servings that we ended up throwing away. The flavor was bland and the texture was gummy. If I did try it again, I'd cook the couscous separately and serve the vegetables over the couscous rather than mixing them together. Needs more flavor overall.
