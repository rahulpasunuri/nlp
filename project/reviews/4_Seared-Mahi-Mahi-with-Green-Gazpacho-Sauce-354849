This was excellent. Made it for me and my husband for a quick dinner but easily good for summer meals with guests (would need some sides). Refreshing, tasty and pretty presentation.

Nice, light summer dish. I love 'heat' in the summer, so added more serrano pepper to the gazpacho and added crushed aleppo peppers along with the cumin to coat the mahi. Substituted a splash of rice wine vinegar for the white balsamic and decreased the oil to get a thicker gazpacho.

My Grandma really enjoyed this and so did I. I had the same problem as others. Local market did not carry Mahi so I had to get the wild caught tilapia, which substituted well. The gazpacho sauce is nice, I would adjust slightly but it had nice fresh, clean notes with the cilatro and cucumber. I would add a little more of the Serrano pepper though. Also since filets can vary your cooking times will too. Medium high seemed a little to high of heat, I knocked it back a bit and cooked 5 minutes a side. I did enjoy the cumin, it gave the fish another flavor level to mingle with the sauce. Served over rice and veggies with yellow and red grape tomatoes on top.

This was outstanding! We had a fresh-caught mahi mahi from off the coast of Key West, cucumbers and tomatoes from my garden and a happy mom, dad and kids! Very light and fresh tasting - not too spicy for the kids. Wouldn't have changed a thing (and I usually like to tweak things!)

This is an easy sauce that turns fish from blah blah to awesome! I used Steelhead trout instead of mahi mahi, it was a perfect complement to the sauce (and I don't particularly like mahi mahi). Leaving tomatoes out of the "gazpacho" keeps this dish very affordable.

i left out the chiles and used white wine vinegar instead of white balsamic. it was fast, easy, and delicious.

Quite delicious, my husband loved it too. I made brown rice, placed the fish on top of the rice and then smothered it in the sauce. Yum! Nearly any white or lighter flavor fish can substitute. Healthy and flavorful.

My husband and boys LOVED this -- asked for more! I made 2 slight additions that really worked: I put some ancho chili powder on the fish after the cumin. It gave the fist even more flavor. Also, I sauted the heirloom cherry tomatoes in the pan with the fish for the last few minutes Just so they were half-cooked. Delicious. I highly recommend this for a light summer meal that's fancy enough for company!

Wow! Simple and delicious, full of flavor. Used flounder because I prefer. No white vinegar, used regular balsamic. It was all good.

Delicious, easy, and something you could easily serve to company. I didn't think it was bland at all. I didn't actually measure the salt, pepper and cumin I put on the fish, so perhaps I used more and therefore it had more flavor. Need to make sure your cumin's not old and flavorless, too. And I warmed the sauce a bit just so it was room temp instead of chilled.

I thought the sauce was a little too watery, would try to reduce or strain next time, but the flavors were good.

The gazpacho pairs well with Mahi; the heat from the peppers and acidity from the vinegar mask the fishy Mahi.

I wasn't impressed. I served it as directed (just the fish ontop of the sauce) and thought it was lacking something to sop up the sauce. I would suggest serving it along with pasta, couscous, or quinoa.

I added salt and lemon and then it was delicious and absolutely beautiful!

Quite bland- initial flavor falls flat almost immediately unless this recipe gets a few more ingredients. Definitely needs the salt (at least 1/4 tsp) in the first step when adding all ingredients in the food processor. Also, add an extra serrano, a large garlic clove and most importantly, make it a few hours ahead of time since the flavors won't have time to come together.

This was very good, not amazing. The fish does not have that much flavor, and I used very good halibut instead of mahi mahi (what was fresh and available). The sauce (which is really just soup) is very tasty, but I added to grape tomatoes in the sauce itself, and a little more vinegar. Difficult to serve except in a bowl- with the amount of sauce you want with the fish, its too soupy to serve over rice- maybe a separate bowl? Served with roasted green beans and wild rice- definitely will make again, probably with tilapia.

I REALLY love this recipe! It was completely delicious. The star was definitely the sauce. Take the below reviewer's advice, and get some bread to wipe your plate clean!

Double the Green Gazpacho Sauce and grab a loaf of bread. Any light white fish is great with this, but the sauce - delicious and you'll just want more!

This was outstanding! Used tilapia, but this gazpacho would taste good on almost anything! Fresh, simple and light.

I prepared this using flounder fillets since that's what I had on hand but they are too thin and didn't sear well, falling apart in the process. I will definitely use the Mahi Mahi next time. The gazpacho sauce was very tasty although I added a bit of salt, fresh ground pepper and a more vinegar to brighten up the flavor. I served this with roasted green beans and a garlic wild rice side. Made for a very colorful and flavorful meal.

I'm not much of a fan of gazpacho, but I loved this refreshing summer dish. I made the green sauce as is, but substituted a pound and a quarter of shrimp. I served the dish with quinoa and garnished it with avocado and chopped cucumber chunks in addition to red and yellow cherry tomatoes. This is a stunning, colorful meal that takes advantage of summer's bounty, is relatively quick to make, and special enough for company.

Fantastic - hands down a new family favorite. I made it with mahi which is not my favorite fish but it was great with the gazpacho sauce.

I've reviewed a lot of recipes, most of them three forks. But this one gets four, no question. It's fresh, light, deeply flavorful and pretty. Like another reviewer, I used tilapia and it was great. I think the thin filets concentrated the flavoring on the fish and it was slightly crispy. This is good enough for a fancy dinner party, and could brighten up winter meals too. A winner and a keeper!

This turned out to be delicious, enjoyed by all guests (and hostess). Sorry to say, I did modify a little- tilapia b/c no mahi mahi, and canned serranos (I added a bit more since I like a little more spice). Overall great though. Cherry tomatoes are amazing this time of year, which helped. Also, the sauce is great- used leftovers on sandwiches and as a salad dressing. I also think it could be used for other types of fish, including grilled salmon.

This is definately a do over. The recipe is robust enough to be good with some substitutions. I know, I hate it when people review a recipe and change the ingredients, however I did out of necessity. No mahi mahi so I used halibut. I used white wine vinagar to taste instead of white balsamic vinagar and used hot sauce to taste instead of a serrano pepper. Otherwise I made it according to the recipe. It was still excellent.

This was a huge hit with my family. I couldn't find a serrano chile so I substituted a 1/2 tsp of hot pepper flakes. Good also with halibut.

I, too, could not find Mahi-Mahi--none of the stores were purchasing because it became too expensive. So, I substitued Swordfish. I thought the dish came out nicely, but like another reviewer--I might add a little more serrano for more kick next time. A "keeper" recipe.

Rating: 3
Fresh, easy, and very good. This missed the 4th fork because I was expecting more kick... Next time I would add more serrano chili and black pepper. I agree that the cumin was a surprising addition to the fish that I will use more often!

This was delicious and really easy to make! I used some red chili peppers that I had on hand and it looked and tasted great. I'll definitely make it again soon.

very delicious and easy! grilled the mahimahi. tasted fresh and light.

Nice sauce but misnamed. Gazpacho has three essential ingredients, without which it's not gazpacho: Bread, water, olive oil. Everything else is embellishment. Could be tomatoes, cukes, peppers, almonds, whatever, but it's got to be emulsified with bread to be gazpacho.

This was a really outstanding dish: quick, easy, beautiful and delicious. The sweetness of the tomatoes goes well with the spicy gazpacho. I used red snapper in place of mahi mahi and it was delicious.

I thought it was good, but can't rave about it. Only change was store didn't have mahi mahi so I used swordfish. I will now use cumin more frequently as a simple rub on fish before grilling; worked well.

We made this per the recipe, except with no hot peppers (daughter no like) and I accidentally added cumin instead of pepper to the soup/sauce, which didn't hurt at all. Next time I'd try to have a ripe avocado to puree in the mix. And this turned out to be a method of serving dolphin that my husband actually said was good!

I am making it again this weekend. It is fresh and light but with lots of flavor. I had tilapia on hand so used that as I have a friend who doesn't like real fishy fish but does like the mild tilapia. I served smaller portions using the dish as an appetizer course and my friends were sad to see the bottom of their bowls. One friend does not care for cucumbers or cilantro so for him I will try the NYT's corn and tomato salad others have recommended. Thanks.

What a great, fresh meal for summer! Used a red jalapeno instead of serrano, which added some nice color. I did cook the fish for less time and and a lower heat than suggested -- and it turned out perfectly.

This was delicious-- quick and easy, too. I made it with swordfish steaks instead of mahi-mahi and took the advice below to serve it with the NYTimes recipe for pan-roasted corn and tomato salad.

This was such a great, healthy, quick meal. I used frozen mahi (Whole Foods), grilling it for 4 minutes on one side, and 3 on the other. I also only had regular balsamic, which worked just fine. (Maybe not as pretty as white balsamic.) Added a tiny bit of sugar to cut the vinegar.

This is an easy recipe that is perfect for hot summer evenings. As with any fish, I would ignore recipe timing and say "cook until done," as fish is going to be of different thicknesses. The gazpacho sauce is delicious and simple. A really terrific accompaniment for this dinner is Mark Bitman's Aug. 19, 2009, recipe (nytimes.com) for Pan-Roasted Corn and Tomato Salad, which, like the gazpacho, calls for chiles.

I thought the mahi at the fish market looked a little iffy so I opted for grouper which I grilled. The green gazpacho sauce was amazing. I doubled the recipe and used about 4 tbsp of olive oil in total. Served with tomatoes from my garden and couscous. Even my boyfriend, who is not a fish eater, liked it.

I bought frozen Mahi-Mahi seeing as they didn't have any fresh stuff in at my grocery store. I'm not sure if that made a difference, but the fish was a little overcooked going by the recipe. I would say cook it 3 minutes on one side, turn and cook another 3 minutes on the other (Also depends on the thickeness of the fillets). I uped the recipe by 50% as well for more guests. Everyone enjoyed it! There are leftovers for lunch today!

Quick and easy to make. The leftover gazpacho was good enough to eat on it's own. I was able to score a container of mixed heirloom grape tomatoes which really made a nice contribution.
