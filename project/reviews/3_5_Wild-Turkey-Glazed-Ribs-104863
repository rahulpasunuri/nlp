I tried this with a rack of pork roast. Held the rack upright in a pan with skewers and moped every half hour with glaze. Best pork recipe every. Totally wowed the guest. A real keeper.

As one person cut the tabasco down to a 1/4 - can't imagine what it would have been like full stregth. Made them for a baby shower - cooked in the oven ahead of time then threw them on the bbq to re-heat. Everyone loved them. Making them for a big bash (100 people) for tomorrow night.

best ribs we've had in a long time. Will make them often

O.K., I admit I'm a wimp where hot food is concerned, but even my husband thought these were too hot. And, even with the Tobasco cut back, I don't think the rest of the taste would be worth it. Also, had to make MUCH more of the sauce, (about triple) as I kept running out with all the basting. Just disappointing, all around.

A HUGE disappointment after all the raving reviews. Not enough sauce for the ribs and not spicy at all. Too much trouble for nothing.

I was majorly disappointed after reading all the great reviews. There was not enough sauce for the basting, they were not very tasty and after cooking for over 3-1/2 hrs. the ribs were not very tender. There are tons or great recipes out there for ribs, would not do this one ever again.

Our company loved the flavor of the ribs, leaving us no left-overs! I will make again.

This is a great dish and a nice change from the ole regular 'barbeque sauce' rib recipes. However native Texans don't seem to what to change their heavy sauce ways. Bourbon works great in the cook too!

My husband and I loved this recipe! Of course, we love Wild Turkey, so it was destined to be a favorite. I took the below advice and used 1 Tbs. Tabasco, 1 Tbs. Tapatio (a more flavorful hot sauce), and 1 Tbs. Bahamian hot sauce (a yellow sauce). The spice was perfect, and the glaze cooked on beautifully (in 1 1/2 hours for 2 lbs. of ribs.) I'd be curious to try this recipe in a clay pot.

I followed the recipe and the ribs were great. I will make this again, but will add some chopped habenero peppers to the glaze. The ribs were very tasty but even with all of the Tabasco in the glaze I think a little more heat in the sauce will add a nice bite to the rib. Now I need to read his book. Has to be a great place to work with meals like this for the staff.
