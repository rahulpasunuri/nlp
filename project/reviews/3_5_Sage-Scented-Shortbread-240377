I make this exactly as written with fresh sage leaves every Christmas and it reliably makes people swoon with happiness. It's a particular hit with my Scottish family and they know from shortbread! This year I made a batch with a gluten free flour mix (Namaste or something like that) and while I don't think they were quite as good, they were much better than anything else I've made with gluten free flour mixes.

These are super easy. I took them to a party and they were gone in 60 seconds. DEVOURED by the guests. People BEGGED me for the recipe. Next time, I would cut down a little on the salt, and I think the texture issues people comment on come from overworking the dough. I used a pastry cutter, worked it by hand, and stopped just as it came together. Mine were light as air, I'm hardly a master baker, and I was able to reproduce it.

Great recipe! Very easy and tasty. I only had salted butter on hand so I cut the Kosher salt to 1/2 t and the balance was perfect. 2 T loosely packed fresh sage was a perfect amount. Not over powering at all. I will try it next with lemon zest and thyme!

I love the idea and the flavor of the herb scented cookies, but the shortbread wasn't great. Too crunchy, dry, blah. I still think this is the best shortbread recipe out of all the ones I've tried. http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Chocolate-Peppermint-Bark-Cookies-356321. I'm going to try to add the herbs and salt, instead of the chocolate and peppermint, to this one, and see how it goes. I bet it will be great.

Delicious! Note to other reviewers - sagebrush is NOT the same as the sage grown in your garden.

So easy, a perfect blend of savory, sweet, and salty, have baked them a few times and had rave reviews from friends!

Note to self: vegan shortbread is gross. So I substituted Earth Balance vegan butter spread, which was a mistake. Served these at a party and the comments were, "They're okay;" "Something just doesn't agree with me;" "Sure, I guess I'll take them home..." Sigh.

These cookies are amazing, very savory and salty and delish! I've never made short bread before, and they came out perfect. I did not have parchment paper, and they still came out fine. Very addictive though, watch out!

The first time I made this I guess I didn't put enough butter in and my mix didn't not get doughy at all so I couldn't form the cookies. So I don't know if I will make them again.

I loved this cookie it s so delicious. Actually I skipped the sage leaves and added a small drop of vanilla extract but they turned out so yummy.

I thought i'd try to be more Earthy by using fresh herbs and to put real sage in these cookies. I had my folks out in Wyoming send me some sagebrush. I ground it up with a mortar and pestle and used it the cookies. It gave the cookies a lovely scent that smells more like it belongs as an air freshener but not so great in the taste department. Maybe I shouldn't have used the brush bark in there? My dog wouldn't even finish them off.

Delicately flavored and super-easy! But watch the cooking time: my first batch got burnt after just 8 minutes at 350, so the next batch I cooked for about 7 minutes at 275-300. Keep checking 'em is what I say.

This recipe is fantastic! I've made it twice and it has come out well both times. My friends loved it. A lovely mix of sweet and savory.

These cookies are fantastic! The savory-sweet-salty combination is perfect and unique. I make them so often, I have started to make variations with different herbs....lavender blossoms instead of sage is also great.

Oh no! I burnt some of them, but even those I was able to save weren't very good.

The texture and flavor was excellent and I used fresh sage. Also, very easy to make!!!! A perfect shortbread cookie. I highly recommend this recipe.

This is a great recipe. I love shortbread, and the sage made the cookies interesting. I did end up using only 1.5 tsp of the sage, and that seemed to be the perfect amount. The cookies did not take as long to bake in my convection oven as was indicated (about 18 minutes total).

I made these because they were in the featured dessert section of epicurious. I'm not so into them. I might try again, but putting in more sugar next time.

these are really great! i put the whole two tablespoons of fresh sage and i didn't think it was too much.

I admit, the first time I tried these cookies, I didn't like them very much. But as we worked our way through the batch, they grew on me. I would definitely agree to use only 1-1.5 tsp of sage, at the most. Otherwise, it is not so much "scented" as it is "strongly flavoured". The cookies are much better when the sage is subtle.

This recipe was a huge success - super easy (and my first time making shortbread) and really tasty! I used rubbed sage instead of fresh and followed the recipe exactly and the taste was perfect - I wouldn't change the recipe in any way.

This recipe was my first attempt at a rolled cookie and I wasn't sure if the trouble of rolling it was going to be worth it. It was completely worth it. In my opinion this is the perfect cookie. Not too sweet. The taste of the salt and sage was completely delightful. I used rubbed sage which worked out perfectly. This is now on my list of cookies that I will make again and again.

I think this is a really unique flavor...some will really appreciate and enjoy and others will just not like them...this is the experience I had in sharing them with various friends. I personally thought they were great - slightly sweet, buttery and herby with a great texture...very nice!

the recipe is great. would work well at cocktail parties or as dessert. i used the recommended amount of ground sage and its a little much. 1 1/2 teaspoons would be ideal or use the fresh stuff.
