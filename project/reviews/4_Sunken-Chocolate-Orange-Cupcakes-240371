Absolutely delicious. I didn't have a food processor so I pounded the almonds in the bag and it was good enough for me. I cut 1/4 of the sugar of the recipe but next time would use 1/2 the sugar, particularly if using semi-sweet chocolate. I used dried orange zest and could not really taste the orange, so might try a bit of orange extract next time. I also whisked the whites until they were a little stiffer, so on the whole, these turned out more like souffles for me. Not that I minded at all. I thought it was super. It did leave me with more batter than expected, however. These worked perfectly for Thanksgiving dessert where one of my had to have gluten-free, and I will definitely make these again.

Just made 45 mini-cupcakes with one recipe and NO sinking! Moist, rich, you can't eat just one! Orange flavor is super. My only diviation was to add 1 tsp instant espresso powder,which I add to ALL my chocolate cakes....makes chocolate flavor stronger. This is even easier than my favorite Flourless choc cake recipe.

Wonderful recipe! I had the TJ's almond meal on hand and they went together very quickly and were delicious. I served them at room temp with a few clementine slices on the side. My guests loved them.

These cupcakes aren't much to look at, but they are absolutely delicious (and very easy to make). My husband I prefer them at room temperature without a topping, rather than warm with ice cream. I reviewed this recipe on my own blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins.

These were really easy and SO yummy! Moist, rich. I microwave mine for about 20 seconds before I eat them, makes them warm and soft.

These were cupcakes were a great idea-- orange and chocolate make for a knockout combination. These cupcakes were a little bit too crunchy though-- when I make a cake (or cupcake) I want the body of it to be moist and almost silky-- not something that leaves you feeling like you might have something in your teeth.

These are super-yummy, fudgy, rich cupcakes. The reason I only gave them 3 forks is because there is a lot of prep-work and steps involved. It IS worth it in the end, but all that work may turn some people off to this recipe. I made fresh whipped cream with vanilla and orange extract to go with them. YUM!! Next time I will try the almond meal as suggested. Will definitely make these again!!

I didn't have particularly high expectations for these but needed a quick and easy dessert and this fit the bill. What a nice surprise -- these were terrific!!! Make sure your eggs sit at room temp for at least half an hour so the whites beat up nicely. If you can find the Almond Meal at Trader Joe's BUY IT; it makes this recipe even easier and they're a great texture/consistency. Mine baked for 19 minutes and were perfectly set but still a bit gooey. I used my handy-dandy ice cream scoop to portion out the batter into 14 paper cup liners. The cupcakes DID, unlike many other recipes, come out of the paper liners with NO sticking. Can't say enough about how easy and great these were -- especially served with some vanilla ice cream.

DELICIOUS!!I omitted the orange peel and added some vanilla extract. It was really easy and simple, yet very tasty. I will definitely be making these again when I am craving chocolate.

These are delicious and the perfect treat if you have any gluten-free friends. Trader Joe's sells almond meal that works perfectly in these cupcakes and then you don't have to bother with grinding the almonds. They do sink a lot in the middle so I filled them with berries macerated with orange juice. They were perfect.

These were wonderful! Chewy! Would definitely make them again!

Five forks - four isn't enough! This was the easiest, most amazing dessert I've made in ages! Perfect for my chocoholic friend with a wheat allergy. I bought slivered almonds and processed them until they were almost powder. This step is very important - the first time I made them I didn't get the almonds fine enough and the texture was funny. I made them the day before serving, and only baked for 17 minutes. After 15-18 seconds in the microwave they were warm and gooey in the middle and chewy on the outside.

These are good... not fantastic. There was nothing about these cupcakes that really blew my mind. I am trying out cake/cupcake recipes for a special birthday coming up and this recipe didn't make the cut. With that said, it IS easy and tasty, maybe good for a casual treat but not for a special occasion. I skipped the almonds altogether since I don't have a food processor and the reviews didn't praise the almond addition. I also upped the orange peel amount and it was good. Cooked 19 mins.

Turned out great, but the almond pieces seemed out of place. I used my food processor to get them to a fairly fine grind, but it gave the texture of sand in the cakes. Next time I'll either grind it even finer, or leave it as a more coarse grind.

These were great, though I agree with the comments below about making sure the almonds are ground well. Must get a food processor...

Good, solid recipe. I'm tempted to make just one big cake in a springform pan.. maybe next time. The orange is subtle... these taste like good, rich brownies (but the meringue keeps them lighter in texture than you'd expect). Maybe I'll just make these instead of brownies from now on...well maybe not... too many bowls to clean. The ratio of bowls/tools to clean to yumminess rates this at 3 forks instead of 4. Next time, I'll get the almond meal from TJs (as A Cook recommends) and that will save me from dragging out the food processor.

Rave reviews from the dinner party guests and will make again. The picture doesn't show how much it sinks so don't be disappointed when the cakes cool. It baked for 23 minutes and they still looked wet on top when I took them out but cooled perfectly crunchy on top with a gooey center. My husband asked next time that I add pistachios to the nuts. No need to blanch, and do use a food processor to make the almonds a more fine consistency than chopped.

Delectible. Rich, but somewhat light in texture. I whipped some heavy cream and added Orange Extract, and it was a huge hit :) They smell heavenly and taste even better!

This is absolutely stunning, and so easy and fast to make. Fool proof. I used Bakers Premium 70% cocoa chocolate. The recipe is the perfect size for 8 medium ramekins (much nicer presentation than cupcake liners). I served them re-heated in the microwave with a dolop of vanilla ice cream - my guests thought they'd died and gone to heaven.

I made this recipe in 8 ramekins instead of cupcakes--they were beautiful. increased baking time accordingly. i also only got 1 teaspoon of zest from my orange and it tasted like the perfect amount--apparent but not overwhelming. these were a huge hit and relatively easy to make. i served them with homemade vanilla ice cream--delicious. i will definitely make them again.

So Yummy! Followed the directions exactly and baked for 20 min.

Divine. I baked them about 23 minutes, as they were simply too runny with less time. The flavour and texture were perfect, and I served them warm with a homemade loquat and orange sauce. So so good! Great for the "I don't eat wheat" crowd.

Great- and easy! Perfect for dinner parties. Grind the almonds fine enough to make sure that they aren't crunchy cupcakes.

Delicious & rich and soo easy! We had these for a Spring Garden Party & topped them with a chocolate ganache instead of plain whipped cream. Great do-ahead dessert for a party!

These couldn't be any easier to make and are almost impossible to ruin. I overcooked mine by quite a bit when my timer broke and they were still excellent. In fact a guest who had them both ways - perfectly cooked and soft, and overcooked and firm - said he couldn't decide which way he liked them better. I served them with vanilla whipped cream, blackberries and strawberries, all of which go beautifully with the delicate almond crunch of the cake. I have made them as cupcakes and in ramekins for more volume and either way works. I have found that this makes more than 12 regular sized cupcakes and I usually have about a cup of batter left over - hence the ramekins. This is a flawless recipe.

Oh and I forgot to add: Trader Joes has a gound almond meal that can be used in lieu of grinding your own from blanched almonds.

Best flourless cupcake. Orange extract really makes a difference, and I imagine grand marnier would work beautifully as well.

Wonderful texture, easy to prepare! Even better with some slightly sweetened cream (icecream is a little over the top).

Delicious! Loved the texture. I'm always looking for good cupcake recipies! I will definetly make these again, maybe with vanilla insted of orange flavoring.
