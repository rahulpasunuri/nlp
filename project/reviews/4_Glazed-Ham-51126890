This was absolutely delicious for my first Xmas ham ever. We used guava jam from whole foods and a pre cooked bone in ham from there as well. Keep ham uncovered at all times and you will have a crispy skin and a bowl of epic gravy/glaze left over to pour over the ham. Saving leftovers to make biscuit sandwiches with cheddar cheese and the epic glaze for brekky :) highly recommend. Don't skimp on quality ingredients here.
