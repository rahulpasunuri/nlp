Just the crepes - great crepe recipe for savory or sweet-stuffed crepes. Cook them on lower heat or they will get stiff. They are nice and flexible cooked over low heat (both in a crepe pan and a non-stick).

Made crepes for the first time using this recipe. I have always been intimidated by making crepes but I researched it and found it to be quite simple and fun. Now I am all about the crepes... I followed the recipe exactly but had to make a couple of substitutions: baby portabellos instead of shiitakes; cilantro instead of epazote; and muenster (crappy muenster, really) instead of manchego. I also used frozen corn kernels, but I'm sure fresh would've been better. The sauce was delicious (and beautiful) but might need a little more heat if you like it spicy. The husband and I topped it with a few dashes of chipotle tabasco and we both loved it! Will definitely make this again but I'll follow the recipe exactly and maybe spice up the sauce a bit.

Ok I admit it - I had no intention of making crepes I was looking for poblanos and manchego. What I ended up with was as follows - I used the grilled polanos to hold the filling to which I added about 1 breast and one thigh of cooked shredded chicken and one chopped japaleno. Then I made the sauce with fat free milk with about a 1/4 cup of heavy cream to make it rich. I shredded the manchego and added it to the sauce (I only used one chopped poblano in the sauce. I skipped the puree - I wanted texture. I greased individual oven safe plates, put a whole polblano in each, added a heaping amount of filling and poured teh sauce over the whole thing. Bake at 350 for about 15 minutes and YUM! No very time consuming effort to get an excellent dish.

These crepes are pretty good but they are VERY time consuming. I´ve made another version of poblano sauce with cream cheese that comes out even better I think. If I could find ways to cut down the time, I´d make them again, but I doubt it.

Delicious -- kids loved, too! Made 1/2 with tortillas and 1/2 with crepes, since I had just a few leftover crepes from another day. Also 1/2 with chicken and 1/2 with just the shrooms for my vegetarian daughter. Crepes are definitely lighter and more tender/delicious. But also good with tortillas. Used canned chopped fireroasted chiles and skipped the fireroasting/blending step. Used just lowfat milk; not whipping cream. Also placed all the tortillas/crepes in one large glass buttered pan to bake, rather than individual plates. Maybe not as fancy-looking, but easier. Scrumptious!

If you are going to make these, I highly recommend doing it over 2 days and/or buying as much pre- sliced and chopped stuff as possible: sliced mushrooms, chopped onion, premade crepes, maybe even the pre-roasted and peeled poblanos in cans. It was good, everyone liked it, but it looked like a train wreck on the plates (I used an 8" x 13" pan like most others). Plating them individually and putting the plates in the oven as per the recipe seems to be best in terms of visual appeal, but that limits the number of people you can do this for. I would recommend definitely garnishing the crepes with the rajas and corn (must be fresh kernals), as it adds a lot to the dish in my opinion.

This was fantastic! The smoothness and mild spiciness of the poblano sauce just goes perfectly with the flavor of the mushrooms. We didn't bother with the crepes; just used pre-made flour tortillas and assembled them like enchiladas. Served with Spanish Rice.

REALLY good. As written the filling sounded so skimpy so I added 1 large cooked, shredded chicken thigh to the filling and it was great. The recipe is somewhat time consuming but most of it can be prepared ahead. I bought manchego cheese ($20.99/lb!), it was good and worth trying but probably not worth the expense. For 2 of us I made 4 crepes. I added the filling to the crepes and rolled them like enchiladas; put some sauce on the bottom of an 8" square baking dish; place the filled crepes; poured the remaing sauce over the top; then the cheese; baked at 350ºF for 15 minutes and topped with the sauteed garnish.

I thought this was a very light and delicious recipe. I made it with portobello mushrooms, did not have cuitlacoche, and came wonderful!!, definetly I would make it again!.

I've made this a few times. I substitute whole wheat tortillas for the crepes and serve them like quesadillas. This saves a lot of time and it's great.

This is a wonderful dish. I used only 3 of Pablano Chile peppers and the sauce had plenty of "heat". It is a bit intense to put together but if you have the time (it took me 2 1/2 hours start to finish) it is well worth the time. I used a clear rectangle baking/serving dish for the meal. If I were making for a formal night the individual baking/serving dishes would be prefered. I added pepper jack cheese to the mushroom filling (would not do that again to cut down on fat) and used muenster for the top. This could easily be an elegant vegetarian meal. I used soy milk and half the heavy cream to lighten up the fat in the sauce. It was wonderful!

I thought this was pretty good. The suace was too mild for my taste. Next time I will add more chile to the sauce for more flavor. I'm not too crazy about shiitake mushrooms, but I actually really liked the taste with the crepes. I added some button mushrooms as well. The recipe was really time consuming but it's worth making at least once. Next time I'll add some chicken to even out the flavors. I added some corn and rajas together and added on top of the sauce, which added a lot to the presentation. It added some contrasting color. Will try again when I have time to spare.

Awesome recipe. Beware it is a bit of work, took me nearly 4 hours start to finish. But don't shy away because it's worth it. I did not assemble the crepes individually on plates, but instead rolled the filling in crepes (like an enchilada) and made two 11X7 pans, Or you could do one 13X9 inch pan, The recipe makes 12 crepes. Crepes: Only change is I only used 1/2 teaspoon salt and brushed my skillet with vegatable oil instead of butter. Mushroom filling: I purchased a roasted chicken and added some of the chopped chicken to the mixture. But not too much. Maybe only 1 1/2 cup. Sauce: The recipe calls for 6 large poblanos, but only 3 are used in the sauce. The other 3 are for garnish. Seemed like too much garnish for my taste. I only roasted one for garnish and in the end did not even use it. The recipe didn't need it. I added the 1 cup of muenster cheese (or whatever cheese you use) to the sauce. When I rolled the crepes, I put a little montery jack cheesed in each crepe. Next time I think I'll use pepper jack cheese in the crepes (but not the sauce) for a bit more kick. Poured sauce over the crepes and baked for 15 minutes at 350 degrees. I froze the second pan for another day. I also did not use the corn or any of the garnishes. This sauce is delightfully mellow. I think I'll make 1 and 1/2 of it the next time so I'll have enough to put in the bottom of the pan as well as on top. I like sauces and may add more cheese to thicken it up a bit more.

Have served this rtwice to large groups of people, and each time the reviews have been unanimous praise. Making the crepes can be a little time consuming, but overall the recipe is very easy and delicious.

Wow! This was even better than I anticipated. The flavor of the chili pureed in the sauce is so good. The whole thing can be prepared ahead and baked and served later which is great for a party. It is a time consuming recipe but at least you can do that the day before. I added chicken to mine for my husband. It was great!

pasilla and poblano chiles are completely different. pasilla are normally sold dried, and they are a deep red/brown. poblano are traditionally sold fresh and are bright green. while the two make wonderful sauces, the tastes are starkly different.

I made this for a dinner party and it turned out very well. The 'do aheads' were very healpful and made the preparation a breeze. Overall, i would definitely make the sauce again, for almost anything, but maybe not bother with the whole crepe thing.

An excellent recipe. All the flavors and textures mixed very well. The poblano cream sauce itself would work very well with other dishes, such as rice and chicken. (I believe the pasilla chiles the other reviewer mentioned are actually poblanos. They seem to misname them in most US markets.) The crepes were a nice touch. It might be interesting to make crepe based enchiladas with some kind of meat.

Is it just me, or was the May 2003 edition of Bon Appétit one of the best ever? This recipe is one of the many I have made from the magazine, and it, like all the others, was fantastic!! I had to substitute pasilla chiles instead of poblano, but it was great. My vegetarian guests were very appreciative of such a fun main dish.

I made the crepes for a dinner party, although the recipe was time consuming (especially making the crepes) it is really quite delicious and impressive due to the presentation and twist on the traditional Mexican tortilla. It's fun to tell guests why crepes are part of Mexico's culture which is explained in the recipe. The "do aheads" are a tremendous help so the last minute prep is a breeze! I will definately make this again.
