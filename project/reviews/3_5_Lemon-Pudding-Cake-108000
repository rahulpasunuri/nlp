My mom used to make this cake and I always loved it but lost the recipe for more than 55 years. I'm so glad to have found it again....It tastes as good as I remember.

Best ever lemon pudding cake recipe, with a light fluffy cake/meringue topping over a perfectly balanced sweet-tart lemon pudding. I made it in an 8X8 glass cake pan placed in a 9X13 pan of hot water. No leftovers.

This recipe is some kind of magic. Angel cake on top, pudding on the bottom, from 5 ingredients one always has around the house (I would use a little less sugar, a little more lemon). One of my all-time favorites.

I ended using skim milk in lieu of whole milk and no difference. Great, easy recipe.

Made exactly as written with homegrown lemons. We devoured it. Took it out of the oven about an hour before it was served, popped it back in to warm it a bit before we ate it. A real keeper...

I so wanted to love this! I made it this Christmas for a lemon dessert lover and the pudding part was a bit too eggy for my taste. It also wasn't as lemony as I anticipated and the cake part was more like a meringue. Ah well...

I have made this dessert very often, to a point where I now get cravings for it if I haven't eaten it in a while. When made with good lemons it is a delicious, fluffy pudding for those among us who like lemony things that are not too sweet. Totally delicious and simple!

I have made this for my family for years and always to rave reviews. A wonderful lemony pudding on the bottom with a souffle like topping. I always have the ingrediant on hands for a last minute dessert. My 9 year old is always delighted by the "magic" of this dessert. Very good with Meyer lemons-when I have them.

After reading a few reviews, I used 1/2 cup of flour, and then baked the batter in 8 individual 6oz ramekins for 25 minutes. They came out beautiful! Light, fluffy cake top and creamy custard on the bottom! Everyone loved it!

One of the most delightful desserts I've ever made. The light cake swims in a pudding that has a lemony sweetness. After reading the helpful tips, I braved adding a bit more flour (for a total of 1/2 cup)and it came out wonderfully. We ate it warm as others suggested with just dollop of whipped cream. I have to say that when we polished off the leftovers the next day after refrigerating, I actually liked it even better. The taste of lemon came out more and the "eggie" taste disappeared after it was chilled. Either way this is a real winner and will be a regular in my cooking.

I LOVED this recipe. I don't really know why people said that it was bland. I thought that it was subtle while maintaining a very fresh lemony flavor. I described it as distilled lemon meringue pie, and my brother thought that that was perfect. A friend of mine suggested cooking these cakes in individual souffle cups, and I think I may try that next time. I thought that this recipe was incredibly quick, cheap, and easy, and it produced very nice results. My only question is--how in the heck does one batter become a cake AND a pudding?!?!

I've used this recipe several times and it gives a superb result. It works best if you can use a stand mixer to get the egg whites properly beaten. I used one large lemon and its zest (a microplane zester works beautifully) and used frozen Minute Maid lemon juice for the remaining lemon juice.

I prepared this once using lime juice instead of lemon juice, but otherwise following the recipe. It was extraordinary. I also prepared using bottled lemon juice and about 1/2 tsp of lemon extract (instead of using fresh lemons and grating the lemon rind which can be tedious). The flavor was intense and everyone loved it. If you want a sponge instead of meringue, don't reserve any sugar; just beat the egg whites without the sugar. That gives the texture I remember from childhood, although it is perhaps less elegant.

boring, lacks any flavor

My husband's first comment: does this have a lot of eggs in it? I ended up throwing half of it away. Nothing special--a waste of sugar calories. The top is not very cakey, as one other reviewer mentioned. I thought the pudding part was mediocre at best. For light and lemony I will stick with my lemon chiffon cake topped with whipped cream gently folded into lemon curd and some fresh berries. Probably higher calories, but a more balanced flavor.

This dessert was really delicious. However, mine didn't turn out pudding-cakeish in a molten lava cake kind of way. I don't know if that's normal, but i imagine so given the tiny amount of flour - thus i found the name a little misleading. In any case, the soft part is like a lemon curd only less concentrated, and the top is more spongy and souffle-esque, rather than cakey. It is light and delicious, would be very nice served individually out of ramekins. Reminds me of an ile flottant. enjoy!

I made this to take to a dinner party. I followed it exactly and it was absolutely delicious -- light, airy, tangy sweet and pretty simple to make at the same time. I would definitely make it again. I would, however, time it so that I can put it out when it first comes out of the oven all puffy.

Just okay. Nice and easy for a quick dessert.

Nice, light and simple. We served it with homemade vanilla icecream. Half of the guests didn't want ice cream, but preferred this dessert as is. Of note, my children didn't like it (surprising!). I need to figure out how to make non-noticable zest. Will make again for the adult crowd.

I made it for my parents last night, and they went crazy. Not only was it simple, the fluffy top thirds and pudding lower third made a fantastic combo. Definitely serve 10 min. after it comes out of the oven. Use freshly grated lemon. Careful, it's very easy to eat a quater of it--it's so light and refreshing. I'm thinking of adding a few poppy seeds next time. . . ?

Amazing! My favorite lemon bar recipe contains about 20g of fat per serving, not to mention the prep time. This is quick and easy, and gives you the lemon fix you're looking for at a quarter of the fat and barely any time in the kitchen. Definitely a keeper...

Lovely dessert! I made this for our Easter dessert...we had roast leg of lamb and it was a perfect dessert for such an entree. Living in Florida, and with the abundance of fresh strawberries at this time of year here, I served this luscious lemon dessert with macerated fresh strawberries and a sprig of mint...very pretty! And very lemony and excellent dessert for a lamb dinner.

Easy to make and great after any meal. My family loves lemon desserts - this is one we will make again. I agree with another review - did not add the sugar to the egg whites - not as sweet - which is a good thing.

I made this for a dinner party that I had and served it in ramekins topped with fresh raspberries and powdered sugar for presentation. It was really fabulous and have used it frequently to finish off a "Gourmet" meal. I give it three and 1/2 forks!!!

Hope I'm not slapped on the hand for putting in my two cents here, though I did not make this particular recipe. I made Tony from Fresno's recipe (alluded to below) which I note is extremely similar, only Tony's calls for a little more lemon, a bit of cream, and some cream of tartar in with the whites. Hey! And less sugar, so perhaps I'd like THIS one better (I found Tony's a bit sweet.) Anyway, check out Tony's recipe provided under Lemon Pudding Cake with Raspberry Sauce for contrast.

I received a baker's dozen Meyere lemons and was searching for interesting recipes in which to use them, and am so happy that I chose this one. Friends and I enjoyed the cake several hours after it came from the oven and it was delicious and a wonderful taste and texture of a lemon sponge cake absorbing the underlying creamy lemon pudding.

This is an old fashioned recipe that hasn't lost it's charm. It is not really a heavy cake on top but more like a light sponge cake.I really enjoyed this warm or cold and would definitely make this recipe again.

I made this a day ahead and in 6 ramikins. I took them out of the fridge about an hour before dinner and served them with a rasberry swirl ice cream. I had one left over and it was still good two days later. It was simple to make and I was very pleased with the results.

I agree with the cook from Indian Rocks -- Tony's recipe is great. Quick to whip up and delicious -- both taste and texture. Wonderful even with plain old lemons, no need for the Meyers. Try it; you won't be disappointed.

For the best Lemon Pudding Cake you'll ever eat, do try the recipe provided by Tony of Fresno, CA on 1/26/03, listed in reviews under Lemon Pudding Cake with Raspberry Sauce, on this site. My review of Tony's recipe is also shown. There can be no better recipe anywhere for this dessert.

My attempt at this produced a light sponge cake sitting on a lemony custard. The lemon flavour could have been stronger, in my humble opinion. Eaten warm, I would have rated this cake two forks only since I found the custard a little too "eggy" for my taste. I found it more delicious the next day, cold from the fridge...three forks! I will definitely make it a day ahead next time.

Even though it was easy and came out w/ a very lovely lemon flavor (used meyer lemons) - I must not be a fan of a meringue type cakes. Just didn't have enough substance for my husband & I. Won't be making it again.

These was an easy to make dessert. I actually used 2 1/2 lemons to get the 1/4 cup plus 2 tbsp needed. The lemon flavor was very strong, so next time I will just use 2 lemons. It tastes best if you can eat it the same day as you prepare it. It will keep, but the bottom "custard" layer will change. I made a blackberry and strawberry sauce to go along with it and it was wonderful.

Made it exactly as written the first time and it had a great lemon flavor (must have something to do with the lemons you use), very good. Made it a second time with oranges as another reviewer suggested and it was out of this world! I will continue to make this recipe with oranges in the future.

I made this for Easter, came out very nice. I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 3 qt. pyrex glass baking dish. I dusted the top with powderd sugar, everyone loved it.

It was okay. Simple and okay. Love working with meringue! Followed the directions exactly and found it adequately lemony and creamy. A dollop or two of whipped cream would have made it perfect though. We polished it off... but my husband said I needn't rush to make it again. Served it as dessert after a meal of Asparagus Soup, Honey-Mustard Glazed Salmon and a spinach salad (the last two were Epicurious recipes).

This came out as a very mildly flavoured meringue as opposed to a pudding cake. When it comes to lemon I want a bright vibrant lemon flavour. This was just too bland and I will not make it again.

I made this recipe for Easter dinner. Picture is wonderful. It had a very good taste. Served with respberries like the other reviewer suggested. However, I must not have had the right pan. The cake was way too thin, did not have the pudding or custardardy like bottom. What size pan, and what shape pan did everyone else use?

Easy, fast and delicious. Would be great with whipped cream, and since there's no butter in the recipe, you couldn't even feel too guilty about the whole thing. Even kids liked it.

I was a little disappointed in the results. It tasted ok, but I expected a cakier top layer. Mine can out more like a flavored meringue.

I made this for our Easter dinner, and everyone loved it. Simple and fast to make. I doubled the recipe since we had a big group, and it turned out fine. The cooking time for the doubled version was under 50 minutes - it turned a deep golden brown on the top but still retained the pudding consistency on the bottom - so I would reduce cooking time in all cases. I garnished with raspberries and mint leaves.

Rating: 4
Very nice, light dessert. I made it in the span of about ten minutes while reheating dinner. I also dusted the finished product with powdered sugar, which already made a sweet dessert sweeter; nevertheless, everyone in my household enjoyed it. Its a great alternative to the heavier, and sometimes more complicated souffle.

Rating: 3
I thought this came out very well. Although the recipe doesn't call for sprinkling the cooled dessert with powdered sugar, it makes anice touch. Was even good from the refrigerator the next day even though the cake layer will be somewhat more soggy (but not enough to keep me from wanting to eat it!)

Rating: 4
Wonderful! I made this when my mother came for a visit, and she couldn't wait to get home to make it herself. It took a little longer to cook in my oven than the recipe says it should. The leftovers were great warmed up the next day. Has anyone tried cooking individual portions in ramekins?

This recipe is simple, great and well worth the making. I also made this recipe with fresh squeezed orange juice and used half the sugar, this recipe is also delicious. I agree with a previous review, I used a lower temperature and it also baked in 12 mins. Would definitely be making this recipe again.

Tasty! I even messed up the recipe and it came out perfectly - I added all the sugar with the flour instead of only half, so I couldn't add half to the egg whites, but they still formed stiff peaks and I folded them into the batter. I guess it all ends up in the same place in the end.

The recipe seems to be fixed now, so earliest reviews are now obsolete; now that the recipe is correct, it's delicious! It is a lot like a sponge, but the underneath stays custardy and soothing. (I may bake at a slightly lower temp next time--top got slightly more brown than the picture, but it was still great.) Easy, elegant, and comforting--this one goes into the entertaining files!
