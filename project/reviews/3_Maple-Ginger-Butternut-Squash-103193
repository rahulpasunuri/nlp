Wow. Surprised me by how the ginger and maple syrup made the butternut squash taste so light and bright. Definitely is going to be my go-to squash recipe from now on

Just needs a wee bit more maple syrup. The five-year-old actually asks for it and the 18-month-old devours it. And it's still reasonably healthy.

This was quite good but not 'amazing' or anything, Just good and I will make it again. The best thing to me about this recipe is how healthy and light it is. There is absolutely no fat at all but it has some nice earthy flavor. I used both the ginger and the maple syrup. I added about 2 tsp. extra syrup. The end result is a beautiful bright deep orange colour and easy to make. The only tedious part is scraping the flesh out of the hot cooked squash, but I don't mind that because I love to cook.I will use this again as a standby healthy recipe for when I'm trying to take a break from some of the more rich and decadent stuff I cook.

This recipe was a great success. The fresh ginger added such a nice flavour. I doubled the recipe for our thanksgiving meal last night and there are no leftovers. A great way to enjoy falls bounty.

Easy to make, but bland. I even added extra ginger, syrup, salt AND pepper. And then put Irish cheddar on top. Nobody liked it, and we aren't saving the leftovers.

Everybody raved about the squash, I eliminated the ginger added more sugar free maple syrup and dusted each serving with a touch of ground cinnamon.

The ginger was what made it unique, and though it was tasty, I have many things like it before.

Very easy to make and delicious. Especially good at holiday time because you can do ahead and heat in oven before serving. I mash a little butter in as well.

This recipe is delicious. I had to substitute fresh ginger with about 1/16 teaspoon ground ginger, but it came out all right. It has a nice, delicate flavor to it. Next time, I think I'll add a touch more maple syrup, though. It's an excellent dish, and I would definately make it again.

An easy side dish that was a change of pace. I used a bit more ginger (but I love the stuff). It turned out a bit watery and stringy- a food processor would surely take care of that.

I made this dish using squash I bought that was already peeled and seeded. I cut up the squash and put it in a pot with water and boiled it for about 15 minutes. I've never before used maple syrup with butternut squash. I got a lot of compliments on it at my dinner party!

Ginger is a great complement to the squash. I increased the amount called for, and also the maple syrup. The roasting time called for was insufficient (or my squash was too big).

The squash took a lot longer to cook than this recipe called for-maybe 1 hr, 15 minutes, but now that I know this, I would make this again when I see it in the grocery store. Very easy and good with the dry ginger that I used like another reviewer.

I made this up using dried ginger and found I did not have enough for the company. I cooked and pureed carrots with a little butter and mixed it with the squash. The compination was great.

This recipe is great! Simple, almost like sweet potatoes but with a firmer texture. A little extra maple syrup never hurts!

My husband thought the ginger flavor was overpowering and naseous with the squash, I thought the entire dish was boring. YMMV, but try it on your own before you cook it for others.

I thought this sidedish was a nice change of pace. It has a subtle flavor and goes well with quite a bit. I recommend it.
