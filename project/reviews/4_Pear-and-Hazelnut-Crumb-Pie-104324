This is an amazing pie. I have made it for four Thanksgivings and now it had become a tradition. Even people who don't love pears love this pie.

I thought this pie was mediocre, at best. Despite spending extra money on fancy organic Anjou pears, the pear flavor just didn't come through in the finished pie.

I made this one along with a Pumpkin Pie for Thanksgiving and it was absolutely wonderful. It had a much more delicate flavor next to the traditional punchy pumpkin. Most definitely a keeper!

I have made this recipe many times since it first appeared in 2000. It has become a family favorite and my children ask for it, especially at Thanksgiving. A really easy, no-fail, inpressive pie.

This is a realy, really solid recipe! Very good, makes a really big sized pie, and the directions are right on. I totally reccomend it, especially when good pears are in season.

I make this in the fall for my catering business, and it has brought me more referrals than just about anything else I make, I like this with a little whipped cream on top, also I use my own pie crust, because that "easy" pie crust is more like a pain in the rear

I made this for Thanksgiving dessert last fall, as my family is not big on heavy desserts. One change though- I don't have much luck with pie crusts, so I made it like a Pear Crisp and served it with homemade Cinnamon Ice Cream (also found on this site). It was a big hit and I hope to make it every year.

Outstanding. Very high pleasure-hassle ratio. I liked it with hazelnuts, but it was better with walnuts instead. I also added a little almond extract along with the vanilla. May use hazelnuts, walnuts and almonds next time. It worked well with a mix of red and green pears, but I'll try to find Anjou pears next time. It might also be interesting with a half cup of thinly sliced figs in the filling.

I'm sorry to disagree with the other reviewers, but this pie did not impress me. The crust was so-so and the pear flavor did not stand out at all. Because the spices are the same ones used in apple pie, everyone at the table thought it was an apple pie. That is what I will make next time!

In a word delicious! A perfect addition to the Thanksgiving table...Alongside my traditional apple and pumpkin praline pie...this was a tasty surprise! Highly recommended.

I make an apple pie every year for Thanksgiving, and last year made this one also, just to try it out. What a great surprise! Everyone loved it, and I think it has become an automatic Thanksgiving tradition. I used a Pillsbury Ready Crust to save time and energy...it was good, but I think next time I'll make a homemade crust to make it even better.

Delicious. One of the best pies we've made.

This is a quintessential fall dessert! The flavors meld together beautifully, and the texture of the hazeknut crumb topping cannot be surpassed. I must admit that I used a Pillsbury ready pie crust for the bottom, and I don't think the recipe was compromised in the least for it. Question - does anyone have a tip for a less messy and labor-intensive way to peel pears?! Any suggestions would be appreciated!

Have made this four times. All tasters rated it the best pie they have ever eaten, really. I've found that fresh grated nutmeg makes a huge difference. Used Cream Cheese Dough for crust, which also enhances the pie enormously. I also grate nutmeg on the topping. Try it, you'll love it!

I made this pie for a thaksgiving dinner party. Everyone loved it. It was a nice change from traditional Pumpkin and i especially liked the hazelnut crumble topping. It was also a very simple desert to make.

I took some liberties with this recipe, but it was certainly worth every change. First, I cheated and used a Pillsbury crust. Second, I used pre-shelled hazelnuts, chopped them and toasted them. Third, I didn't quite have 3lbs. of pears, so I supplemented a large apple in with the pears and it was great! Finally, I did not have lemon juice, so I used a tablespoon of orange juice and with all these changes, everyone thought the pie was wonderful!

Delicious pie. The pears and hazelnuts are a very tasty combination. I am fortunate to have a Mediterranean grocer nearby and they sell hazelnuts already husked, this made my job VERY easy!

Excellent - has become a family favorite. I solved the problem of husking the hazelnuts - my husband does them!

I enjoyed this recipe because the pie isn't as sweet as some I've tried. The husking of the hazelnuts was not very easy, however, the instructions on the package said it can be done in conventional or microwave oven. Next time I'll try the microwave!

This was really delicious and the pears and hazelnuts make it a good choice for winter. Very good if you want something like apple pie, but more interesting. I had some difficulty with the husking of the hazelnuts as well, though, and would be interested if anyone has any proven techniques for this. I even consulted my Julia Child cookbook and followed her technique (roasting and rolling the warm nuts between a dishtowel), but still thought it was a bit difficult.

Yum, Yum!! Easy, different and really delicious.

This recipe was easy to make and was a hit at Thanksgiving dinner. The pears and the hazelnut crumb topping was delicious. I will definitely be making this again!

The pie was excellent and the favorite dessert for Thanksgiving Dinner. The hazelnuts were a little difficult to de-husk and took a little time, but well worth it. A friend suggested heating them in a skillet on the stove, while hot, place them in a towel to dehusk them.

Excellent!! Out of the three pies I made this Thanksgiving this one was the winner..Because my daughter hated hazelnuts... I added pecans. I made the crust, filling (dry ingredients) and topping the night before. Thanksgiving morning I added the pears, lemon juice and melted butter...it was that simple. I will make this recipe again...and again.

This was a delicious pie.The pears were almost caramelized , it reminded me of a tarte tatin in flavor. The crunchy hazlenuts were a great combination with the tender pears.
