Wonderful - but gets better the day after ! It goes wonderful with grilled salmon steaks as well. I make a big batch and then I freeze.

Purists may think I'm nuts, but the best chimmichurri sauce I've ever had was/is at La Caretta at the entrance of MIA Int'l just before the American Airlines Departure Counter. I travel extensively, and it's my favorite. Try it sometime. Order the Churrasco Steak meal or sandwich, but make sure to ask for the Chimichurri sauce on the side. It's addictive and you better share with those closest to you. You can't go wrong w/ this recipe, neither can you go wrong w/ the reviewer's style that he got off a chef. There is a very similar recipe that is more ingredient intensive, but sounds like it would work right in New Yorker Magazines recipe section. (a good source for contemporary, cutting edge food ideas.) Enjoy.

This dish certainly gets high marks for preparation time and originality. I made it one evening for my boyfriend, and it was entirely stress free as the sauce only requires a bit of chopping and there is nothing special done to the steaks. My boyfriend loved the recipe and was impressed by the intense flavor. Be warned though: the sauce can be overpowering, and only serious garlic lovers need apply!

I seasoned the steaks with garlic, parsley and oil in addition to the salt and pepper, and thought it added such a wonderful taste. The sauce is straight oil, which took a little away from the meat. I would use less oil than it suggests. I also used twice as much garlic as it was suggested, and I made garlic mashed potatoes, which did taste wonderful with the oily chimichurri sauce on top.

I agree w/ the review about adding all those extras, the authentic one is only made of garlic, parsley, lemon juice, salt and pepper. Also being from Latin America this does come the closest to the real thing. If it sits an extra day it tastes better. Loved it!

This recipe gets three forks as written, four forks the way I made it; I doubled, possibly tripled the amount of garlic, was very generous with salk and pepper, and broiled flank steak. With Brazilian-style greens, skillet potatoes and a nice red wine, it was a perfect meal.

According to the recipes available on an Argentinian site, which were several, chimichurri always has red wine vinegar, parsley, oregano,garlic,cumin and chile powder or cayenne. It never has roasted peppers. It may contain several other ingredients such as tomatoes,paprika, bay leaf and black peppper,

Haven't made this version of chimichurri, but since I am from Argentina I just wanted to say that this recipe, as is, is the closest I have seen in the U.S. to authentic chimichurri. It shouldn't have vinegar, cumin, jalapeños, roasted peppers, cilantro, oregano, etc. It is just supposed to be olive oil, parsley, garlic, lemon juice, salt, pepper, and most people like to add crushed red peppers. That's it.

I've eaten Chimichurri in Buenos Aires, Mexico City, and other places around the world. The best ever was in restaurants "San Angel Inn" and "San Remo's" in Mexico City. The secret is the marinating time of the flesh, and the side dish to add extra sauce as needed. I've yet to meet a chef who'll share his chimichurri recipe with me except Carlos Almendariz in Cuernavaca. It is: Parsley ( 1 cup) and cilantro leaves (1/4) cup, 6 - 12 garlic teeth (you decide how much you like), 1 TB of oregano (Mexican is best), 1 - 2 seeded jalapen(y)os, the juice of 5 limes, 1/8 cup of malt vinegar, 1/4 tsp salt, 4 geneeeerous twist os freshly gound black pepper. Blend it in a blender or food processor and slowly add 3/4 cup of fine olive oil til well mixed. This is the marinade and sauce for dipping. It is best to allow it to rest for 1-3 days before using it to allow for total flavor infusion. Comments welcomed.

I like the one from the August Gormet better -- a little more garlic and it uses white vinegar not lemon juice -- I find it gives a truer flavor. I've played with adding mexican oregano and that also improves the flavor of this one.

The Chimichurri sauce was exactly like the sauce I had in a wonderful Argentinian restaurant in Chicago. A tip: chop the parsley coarsely, then throw everything but the crushed red pepper in the food processor--much faster and easier. I serve the sauce on the side in small bowls, so people can control how much of the intense flavor they want.

Well, it may not be authentic but it really makes a fabulous steak.

I don't think this is an authentic Chimichurri sauce recipe. Other recipes I have seen call for vinegar, fresh and dried oregano as well as Hungarian paprika and roasted peppers.
