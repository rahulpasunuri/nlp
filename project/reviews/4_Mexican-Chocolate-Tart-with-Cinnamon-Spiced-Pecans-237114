This is a great dessert. I personally wanted my kick in the chocolate so I added the cayenne to the chocolate mixture. I didn't use the pecans as I like the cinnamon in the crust and opted to make a Kahlua whipped cream garnish instead. This is a keeper!

Made as small tartlets for a cocktail party. Phenomenal. Kept them in the fridge until ready to serve as they sort of melt, but everything about them was great: taste, texture, presentation, etc!

This was totally off the chain, as the young people say. I wish I had read the reviews first, however, because I did ruin $7 worth of pecans and about 35 minutes of my life. Screw the pecans, anyway! I threw them out and re-made the nut topping with slivered almonds and only about half an egg white. It came out almost like almond brittle, and was absolutely delicious, and a perfect topping for a Mexican dessert. I did not have the Mexican chocolate so I substituted an extra square of semi-sweet chocolate and a 2-oz bar of of milk chocolate with cinnamon made by a local confectioner, plus about a half teaspoon of extra cinnamon. Like I said, it was OFF THE CHAIN; truly one of the best desserts I have either made or had in my life. Guests were swooning. One other note, next time I will cook the crust for about 5 minutes less. It was ever so slightly burnt and I took it out a few minutes early. So as a previous poster said: WATCH YOUR NUTS and WATCH YOUR CRUST.

Amazing! I made the crust with Goya's dulce de leche wafers which added a nice contrast to the chocolatey filling. Arrange the pecans in a heart shape for an added Valentine's Day flair.

I made this for Thanksgiving. The nuts were not exciting by themselves, but were great on top of the tart. The Mexican chocolate really gave it a different and good flavor. It got raves, and even the people who don't eat dessert tried it and loved it. I used health-food store chocolate animal crackers to make the crust, which turned out perfectly.

I made this today with a few changes to the recipe and it was amazing! I prefer to limit the fat in a recipe, and I didn't have some ingredients on hand, but it still turned out amazing! I made the pecans exactly as written. For the crust, instead of chocolate wafers, I used 1 cup of normal graham crumbs, with about half a cup of cocoa powder and about half a cup of sugar to add a bit more sweetness to the crust. Otherwise the ingredients used were the same. For the filling, instead of heavy cream, I used 2% evaporated milk in the same proportion and it didn't effect the texture at all in my opinion. I couldn't find Mexican chocolate, so for each ounce of regular semi-sweet chocolate I used, I added one drop of almond extract and 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon. Finally, I omitted the butter in the filling and instead of chilling the tart, I used eggs. I heated the evaporated milk, melted the chocolate and whisked in all the listed ingredients, with about 1/8 cup superfine sugar added in as well. In a separate bowl, I whisked two eggs and tempered them into the chocolate mixture. After baking 30 mins and then cooling on a rack, it was perfect. It had a truffle-like texture and you don't feel so bad eating it! I would definitely make this (with my changes) again!

Fantastic and super easy. I was in a rush and didn't have chocolate cookies at home, so used shortbread instead (and then decreased the butter in the crust). It worked a treat and was actually a nice combo.

Great recipe (with the adjustments to cooking time for pecans and crust as others have noted). I'm sure we will be making this again and again.

More like 3.5 stars. I burnt the pecans at 28 minutes in the oven, so the tart went without the nuts, which I think would have been the finishing touch. I also had to use a few more chocolate wafers/butter to get the crust to spread without holes. I also couldn't find Mexican chocolate at my grocery store so I used a combo of semisweet and couple unsweetened chocolate squares. Very rich, very tasty. But I would have liked to try the nutes!

Sorry, I'm the dissenter! The best part of this recipe is the cayenne pepper spiced pecans, [baked 25 min] which was a good twist and had a nice twist....will use them in future recipes. However, the crust was way too thick and, if baked the full time, gets brick hard. Chocolate crust was over kill as well. Perhaps a shortbread crust or pate brisee would have been better. All in all, nothing to write home about. There's other far better chocolate fixes.

Rating: 3
3.5 forks. Excellent & easy to make. As previous reviews state, the nuts took about 12 minutes. Using a gourmet chili infused chocolate bar may also be more effective in achieving the layered taste - I used a Lindt dark chocolate-chili/cayenne bar (World Market) and it worked very well. Ginger snap crust also added a nice contrast from the chocolate.

I made 2 of these at Thanksgiving - one w/gingersnap crust, the other w/chocolate crust (used the Trader Joe's cat cookies as another reviewer suggested.) I couldn't tell a big difference between the 2 crusts so I'd suggest if you have one of the 2 types of cookies just use them. Our guests really enjoyed the tarts as did I. They are super rich, so you can get many servings from one tart. Serve them just slightly chilled; they get a little goopy if they're at room temperature. And I found I liked the tart better a day or two later after the flavors had blended a bit. I ran our of time to do the whipped cream, but the dessert did not feel unfinished w/o it. As for the pecans - they are awesome! I will be making them for gitfts at Christmas. Definitely watch the time as many others have noted. They needed less than half the time noted in the recipe. Enjoy!

WATCH YOUR NUTS. Seriously, I took the advices of the reviewers and cut the time in half from 30 min to 15 min and they still burned. When I re-did the nuts, I put in for 10 min and they still got a little too brown. Beware. Also, I used ginger snaps for the crust and it turned out really crispy like a cookie instead of a crust. Not sure how to correct that but wanted to provide that feedback. Also, I added close to 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper to the nuts and they still needed more heat. I would also recommend adding a little cayenne to the chocolate filling also. I used Mexican chocolate, some with chili added. I just couldn't seem to get the layered, subtle heat I wanted in this dish.

WOW. Great flavor combination. Easy recipe. Perfect for the dessert selection in our evening of Stout pairings... I did use gingersnaps in lieu of chocolate wafer cookies (with some Dutch press cocoa) in the crust, just for extra depth of flavor.

I reviewed this before but here's another one. This dessert is very, very excellent. The filling is creamy and rich - i add about a quarter teaspoon of cayenne pepper to it for a little extra something. i have a question about the crust - i tested out baking it for 15 minutes and it came out chewy, whereas on previous occasions i baked it for 20 - 25 minutes and it came out really crunchy. I honestly can't tell when it's "set" or what the texture is meant to be. It tastes great though. I think next time I'll put it between two sheets of wax paper and roll it out thin before pressing it in the pan. It's difficult to spread it evenly with just my fingers.

Excellent! Great consistency throughout. Thought it'd have too much cinnamon, but it was perfect!

This is an outstanding tart that has a lot of taste dimension...one note: When roasting the pecans check them every ten minutes. They tend to cook much faster than the stated 30 minutes of roasting given in the recipe....

I had been waiting for just the right recipe to use my Spicy Mayan Chuao chocolate bar (infused with cayenne and chili) which ended up giving the tart a killer kick. Also used gingersnaps for the crust. Raves all around.

I wanted to experiment with the crust so instead of chocolate wafer cookie I used a cinnamon shortbread cookie I found in my supermarket and added a few teaspoons of cocoa powder. It was great. Also, I didn't use Mexican chocolate, so instead I just upped the total chocolate amount to 7 ounces of bittersweet morsels. I also added about 1/2 cup of sugar to the filling. It needed it. Don't cook the nuts for more than a few minutes or you will be left with carbon crumbs. Overall, it turned out rich and delicious.

My husband made this & we loved it, so I made several for holiday gifts. Absolutely you need to cut the oven time on the pecans to just a few minutes. They add a lot, though.

I too make this without the pecans. It is easy, and everyone raves about the flavor. I just dust the top with cocoa powder and cinnamon using a stencil then serve with lightly whipped cream, it looks and tastes fabulous!

This is so easy and tastes so good. I made it without the pecans and instead made cinnamon whipped cream (heavy cream, cinnamon, vanilla, powdered sugar.) I spread a thin layer on top of the tart and served the rest on the side. Great recipe!

First, the pecans should not be in the oven anywhere near 30 minutes. My kitchen filled with smoke after 20. The second batch was done in about 12 minutes, with a few burnt. I used Green & Black organic bittersweet (the one that's flavored w/orange and spices) instead of Mexican chocolate. It was delicious. Two people asked in disbelief whether I had made the tart myself. Tastes great even as leftovers.

Rating: 4
I took this to a pot luck and at least two people said it was the best dessert they have ever had. I didn't use the pecans, used 70% bittersweet chocolate and decreased the baking time for the shell as others suggested. It is absolutely necessary to use Mexican chocolate. I found it at the local whole foods store. Definitely a keeper.

Made this for a dinner party and everyone LOVED it! I used bittersweet chocolate with the Mexican chocolate and it was perfect. The Mexican chocolate really makes it unique (Ibarra or Abuelita). The only chocolate cookies I could find was Chocolate Teddy Grahams and they worked great.

I was delighted to find this unique recipe, as chocolate and chile are so hot (no pun intended) right now! Great advice from the previous reviewers. I agree with adding more cayenne to the pecans and cooking less than suggested time, stirring and checking. The recipe made much more than fit on the tart, but guests loved snacking on them (reminded me of the Sugar & Spice Pepitas on this site that drive folks wild!). I too baked the crust less than recommended time (used chocolate pizzelles from the Italian market) and it was wonderfully crisp. Mexican chocolate is sweet, so I paired it with bittersweet chocolate. To carry through the Mexican spice palate, I served it with the spiced whipped cream one of the reviewers suggested and extra pecans. Guests from 4 different countries cleaned their plates. Everything was great until it came time to divide the leftovers!

The first time I tried this, I slightly burned both the nuts and the crust. Re-starting, I used my own intuition as opposed to the recipe to determine time and temperature. Besides that, this is a yummy dessert and great if you want to impress your guests. Most people haven't had much with Mexican chocolate, so they're always pleasantly surprised by the cinnamon flavors.

I enjoyed this tart recently at our neighborhood gourmet club. I did not prepare it but can attest to it's marvelous flavor and texture. The woman who made it warned about burning the nuts, as did others here, and used the recommended Ibarra chocolate with great results. She substitued chocolate graham crakers for the crust which worked out satisfactorily.

Rating: 4
great recipe on many different levels. Loved that the potential over-sweetness of the chocolate is kept in check with the cinnamon and cayenne pecans. Aesthetically, it was clean elegant. Big hit with my guests and you can get more mileage out of the servings than the suggested 8 to 10 b/c it's rather rich. A keeper, especially for a special occaision celebrating a chocolate lover.

This recipe was fabulous as is. The crust was crunchy,and contrasted the smooth filling perfectly. The nuts were almost an over-the-top addition, spicy and chewy. Some of you clearly do not know what "mexican chocolate" is. You cannot substitute anything else for it. It is a unique, untempered, grainy, cinnamony chocolate.

This recipe is fabulous! I made this for a dinner group and several wanted the recipe.The pecans will take less time to cook. Watch so they don't burn.

I have made this 3 times now. Everyone loves it! I agree about needing to watch the pecans while baking so they don't burn, along with the crust- I think about 15-18 minutes. I also think a pinch more cayenne in the pecans adds a bit more heat but is still really subtle- the texture and heat ocmplement the tart beautifully! This is our favorite chocolate recipe!

Rating: 3
This tastes GREAT, but the recipe needs some tweaks. First of all, I would cook the pecans for 20-25 minutes, stirring a couple times in between and watching them very carefully as they will burn. I would also try to keep the excess egg-mixture to a minimum. Also, I would cook the crust for only 20 minutes. I left mine in for 30 as the directions say, and it was burnt.

Didn't have problems with burning pecans. I looked at them during the baking. Had problems keeping them. A group of friends happened to drop in, saw them and demolished them. Will use this recipe for spiced pecans. Never got around to making the tart. Another day. Rate the pecans four forks. Haven't the foggiest notion of how to rate the tart.

I tried this on the advice of my daughter Heidi, whose review appears here. Decadent, fast and easy. What more could you ask? I agree about less time for toasting the pecans. Couldn't find chocolate wafers, so substituted chocolate graham crackers, which I never knew existed. I used Belgian dark chocolate--couldn't find the Mexican.

This was quite good, but due to my mistake, it was not perfect. I thought the crust was great; I added some crushed semisweet chocolate chips to enhance the chocolate flavor. I did use the Mexican chocolate; but for the bittersweet, I used an expensive 72% chocolate with chili peppers. My mistake! The tart ended up being incredibly spicy! That being said, at least it was interesting, and I would definitely make it again, using Scharff. bittersweet for most of the filling. So, beware of using chocolate that is too spicy!

Rating: 4
I Love, Love, Love this tart. It was rich and smooth and got rave reviews from my family. For those of you who had crust problems, I suggest using the Famous Chocolate Wafers by Nabisco. They are a little pricey but well worth it. You can find them in most grocery stores, usually on the top shelf in the cookie isle.

Just made this for a dinner party tonight. It was a very big hit. One of the guests is allergic to nuts, so I substituted fresh raspberries on top instead of the pecans. Plus, of course, the whipped cream. I was worried that the Mexican chocolate would be grainy, so I first put it through the grater of my food processer. Maybe not necessary, but the dish was very smooth. I used Scharffen Berger semi sweet chocolate. For the crust I used the low fat chocolatey "cat" cookies from Trader Joes. Perfect! Definitely a re-do dessert.

Rating: 3
Made this on short notice, so I didn't have time to find Mexican chocolate, but substituted a bar of Green and Black's Maya Gold. It added a nice essence of orange and cinnamon, but not overpowering. I think Chuao's Spicy Maya bar would have been a good substitution also and then add extra cinnamon. I think I'll try that next time I make it.

We enjoyed this recipe but beware...I had to prepare the pecans twice---they ended up burnt even when I took them out at 20 minutes and let them cool as directed. Also---we added spiced whipping cream when served(1 cup cream, 1/4t cinnamon and 1/8 t cayenne and 2 T sugar) and it was a hit.

Half of my book club loved this, the other did not. Personally, I didn't care for how the crust came out, but liked the filling and the nuts. Agree with previous reviewer to cook the pecans for less than half an hour. If I made this again, I'd use another crust. (P.S. After much hunting, I found the Mexican chocolate in the Mexican/Goya/ethnic foods section.)

This was delicious, and everyone cleaned their plates at supper club last night! A couple of notes... Cook the pecans for 10 to 15 minutes, 30 minutes at 350 will leave you with burned nuts. And let the tart set a bit before decorating with the pecans. I decorated then set it in the refrigerator and my design slipped and set off center in our cockeyed old house. But otherwise, fantastic and easy!

I couldn't find any Mexican chocolate so I used Girardelli; the tart was still delicious, and so easy to make. I also skipped making the crust and just bought one of those Oreo cookie crusts. I highly recommend this recipe for any chocolate lover!
