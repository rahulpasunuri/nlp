I was a bit apprehensive about this recipe, because I am not a fan of feta, but it turned out amazingly! Made it during a massive snow storm so had to improvise with a few of the ingredients. Used frozen pre-cooked shrimp, yellow squash in place of mushrooms, used half fresh tomatoes and half canned diced tomatoes, used dried spices, and used herbed goat cheese and feta. Used jarred minced garlic, and added some garlic powder, and a tsp of lemon juice. Also used angel hair pasta instead of linguine Cut the recipe in half since there were only two of us and ended using 1/4 goat cheese and a couple tbsps of feta which is definitely less than half of what the recipe called for. Used the entire can of tomatoes, juice and all, and ended up needing to cook off some of the extra liquid because it was tasting a bit watery. We had no Parmesan cheese either, and this was one ingredient that was missed. I ended up adding some shredded mozzarella to my plate before eating, which was really good also. Additionally, mushrooms were missed. Next time I'll probably use the squash and the mushrooms. The end result was delicious though, and this is definitely a keeper. Probably won't ever use the full amount of cheese called for, but fresh herbs and mushrooms will be a welcome addition.

AMAZING! I was worried about the feta but it went so well with the dish. Fresh basil is the star.

This was quick and easy. I did not use the mushrooms-used broccoli instead. Used the grated lemon suggestion,and pine nuts. Used1/2 the oil and only 1/4 cup of shaved parmesan cheese-it was perfect.

This dish was superb! Added the zest of one lemon, and 2 handfuls of baby arugula for a great zing! Did not use the mushrooms. Suitable for company.

Very simple yet satisfying dish. I leave out the feta and parsley but increase the amount of basil. I also add the garlic to the pan after finishing the mushrooms in order to bring out the garlic flavor. I don't add the cheese until after I have combined the pasta with the sauce.

This is a weekday go-to dish---quick, easy, and delish. I use extra basil and crushed red pepper, and give the pasta a shot of chili oil after draining it for a little extra kick. I leave out the feta, too, as it seems superfluous.

corrections: weeknight (not weekend) and rock shrimp (not bay shrimp). such a nice recipe deserves a mistake-free review!

This was a rich, delicious, restaurant-quality meal. With the shrimp and the chopping it was a bit more prep work on a weekend than I like. My main complaint was that I feel plum tomatoes are too delicate to be chopped and put in this pasta. Even with them barely being heated, much less cooked, they still disintegrated into nothing but skins. I also feel that just "heating through" after adding the garlic is not enough to cook the raw bite out of it. Next time I'll use roma tomatoes and toss in some toasted pine nuts. I'll definitely be making it again soon, maybe with bay shrimp.

I have been making this for a couple years now and have never got a bad review from any of my friends- it has become my default fast gourmet meal. instead of cutting up plum tomatoes, i will use canned choped tomatoes just to make the preparation easier and it makes a thicker sauce. I also change up the mushrooms depending on what I feel like using. I have used dried herbs in the past but it is much better with fresh ones. Also, it makes a lot of food but the leftovers re-heat nicely. Overall, an excellent recipe.

Rating: 3
Easy and delicious. Once the prep was done (shelling the shrimp and chopping the tomatoes), this dish came together quickly. I had some fresh dill so tossed a little bit of that in together with the parsley and basil. And I added a bit of the pasta cooking water to moisten (I like my sauces to be 'saucy')

I had leftover shrimp to use and came across this recipe doing a search for shrimp, mushrooms and pasta. So glad I did! It was perfect for using the shrimp and my husband and I enjoyed it. I didn't do any measuring for the ingredients and unfortunately didn't have the feta and basil and chose not to use the red pepper. But I did use all the other ingredients and just measured it out for what I thought would work for a 2 person serving. I also added a little heavy whipping cream to the mixture, which made it a little creamier. It's all a great combo and easy to prepare and make.

Rating: 3
Very very good. I followed some other reviewers and used 2 large cans of diced tomatoes. It was much easier than chopping all those tomatoes. My only comment is that it's very garlicly -- and this is from someone who loves garlic!

Rating: 3
This is a fairly simple dish to make and keeps well for those who eat leftovers. I agree with everyone else as to the mammoth amount of food one gets if following the recipe exactly. It is perfect to make as is if you are have a dinner party (8-12) and want to have communal dining. Otherwise, simply halve it and you will have more than enough to feed four very hungry people, or two very hungry people, one of whom will happily reheat and eat the same dish for days. Changes/substitutions that have fared well for me: First, I have never used nearly as much olive oil as this recipe would have me use; 3 T on the halved recipe, maybe 5 on the whole. Second, I think the amount of cheese is also a little much - I used about 1/2 C when working from the halved recipe, and only a little bit of shaved parm. Third, I like using a good bleu instead of the feta on occasion and omitting the parm. One other way to switch it up is to make it as a cold salad and use fresh mozz instead of feta - just make sure to let it cool before you add the cheese.

I loved this recipe! I made it exactly per the recipe (OK, I halved it because it was only for my boyfriend and me. After we had dinner, there was still enough left for lunch and dinner again for the both of us.). Wonderful!

Excellent recipe. Definitely include the red pepper for a little kick. Very easy to make, but the portion sizes are huge. Could easily halve this recipe and feed a (hungry) family of 4 without a problem.

This was good, but not as outstanding as I had hoped, and in some ways seemed to add up to less than the sum of its parts. I used beautiful, ripe heirloom tomatoes, excellent quality feta and real parmesan, and shrimp that were divine when I tasted one after sauteeing them. Put it all together, though, and it was just a bowl of pasta, with the wonderful, intense summer flavors somewhat diluted.

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious! Made it just as the recipe called for. Surprising that the feta blended in so well. Not overpowering at all. Used exactly what the recipe calls for. And the kids loved it too!

Goodness how delicious. I am sorry to say I made it with dried basil: DH was doing the marketing & I wasn't specific enough on the list I gave him :-). With fresh basil this would be just perfect. As it was, it was really good. Perfect for a weeknight.

Everyone loved it. I cut down on the oil, my husband is not a fan of tomatoes, but he loved this dish, everything was scattered around and the Feta Cheese made it better. I am a cheese lover so I added more than recommended. I will definately make this again, may be for a small family gathering.

i too halved everything but the sauce for dinner for 2 and it was perfect. added about 1/4 cup red wine while sauteeing. also used frozen shrimp and saved some time! served over spinach linguine for beautiful presentation. will make again-- probably for guests!

Awesome! I halfed the recipe for the 2 of us however there wasn't enough sauce or gravy for my liking. So, the next time I made it I still halfed the main ingrd. but made the 8 serving sauce and it was perfect!

Have made this a couple of times. Find it makes too much sauce. I also use half the pamesan cheese and pass the rest. I also use good quality canned tomatoes and leave some of the liquid. Delicious.

Excellent recipe and very easy. I used the canned tomatoes as per the recommendations, which does cut down on prep time. Otherwise chopping the rest of the ingredients did not take that much time. Total thing took 40 minutes start to finish. I made it with angel hair and made some garlic bread to accompany; it was declicious.

Just ok, nothing to rave about. The chopping took FOREVER - recommend using the canned tomatoes. It seems like a lot of feta but it works.

Rating: 4
This is a great dish to make for guests, but it can be easily modified to make mid-week for your family. First of all, buy the shrimp peeled. Buy pre-sliced mushrooms. Even if you have to use plain old button mushrooms, it doesn't take away from the flavor too much. Chop your herbs in your food processor. Use canned diced tomatoes. Use minced garlic in a jar. Voila...you have this tasty recipe in about a quarter of the time. I always add a little bit of lemon zest in the sauce and mix in the rest of the lemon's juice at the end. The shrimp tastes better if you add it in with the sauce, but don't add it in if you are concerned about presentation. The cheese and herbs stick to it, making them look like big green blobs!

I loved this recipe. I am making it again tonight.

Delicious dish - everyone had seconds - 3.5 forks. Ingredients seemed an odd mix at first to me but I trusted the reviews. Chopping time (30 minutes or so) can be done before guests arrive. I used Muir Glen fire roasted diced tomatoes (drained) which worked perfectly. The cheese content seemed high - I used the feta but added only one cup parmesan and passed the rest to top the pasta. Fresh basil and parsely are key.

Tomato sauce, feta, paper-thin sliced mushrooms, and fat shrimp combine perfectly in this easy recipe. Added a few extra garlic cloves to the sauce. I made it for my man and two weeks later, he's still raving about that meal. I thought leaving the tails on was unnecessary (anyone sure why this is done? for show?) but the recipe is definitely a keeper.

Love this recipe...made this for the first time for an intimate valentines dinner party. My guests wanted to know what restaurant I got my reicpe from. They always asked for it. I too used the canned tomatoes. Awesome!

I have made this dish twice now and plan on making it again. I would recommend leaving the seeds and juices from the tomatoes. More importantly, melt the cheese while heating and toss the shrimp into the mixture. The recipe calls for topping the dish with the shrimp, I say add the shrimp into the sauce. As far as using uncooked shrimp, I prefer to buy cooked shrimp and just rinse them and take the tails off and add them into the sauce. Don't hold back on the basil or garlic as they compliment this dish very well. The last time I tried making this dish I tried to make it look like the picture in Bon Appetite (they had not melted the feta). Melt the feta.

This is another dish that is quick, easy, elegant and delicious. I'm new to cooking, so my skills aren't refined. Also, I have a very small kitchen, so I don't have the space to try anything complex, but I like elegance in my meals. This is a dish that delivers ease and taste.

this was great. leaving the seeds and juice in the tomatoes made a better sauce. the feta cheese with the fresh basil tasted amazing. it is really easy to make and i found the sauce tasted better the longer it simmered on the stove.

I love this recipe! I find that it always turns out well and, despite the long list of ingredients, is very easy to make. I think maybe the reason some people didn't like it has to do with the quality of the feta cheese they used. If you use the packaged or precrumbled supermarket variety it may not blend into the sauce very well (thus the "clumps" one reviewer complained about). To the person who claimed that the recipe is very expensive to prepare: Where do you live that feta cheese for this recipe cost $10?!? In New York City, not known for having cheap ANYTHING, a high quality Greek or Bulgarian feta cheese is about $3 a pound. Not a huge expense... I agree with the suggestion to add juice from the tomatoes - it makes for a smoother sauce.

I did a test run on this dish before serving it to company. It scored with my husband and I. We plan to serve it with rosemary garlic bread with oil and balsamic vinegar. It's VERY yummy.

Thought this was a great recipe! The only thing I would change is to keep the tomato juice and seeds as they blend well with the melting Feta cheese to make more of a sauce. Doing that might help reduce the amount of oil used.

Finally, something that actually looked like the picture and tasted delicious. I agree with whomever said leave the tails off though - not much point to leaving them on. Forgot to add the cheese until the end and it was still fabulous.

If that cooks shoe tastes this good, then I want the brand! This is a wonderful recipe and I would never use sun dried instead of plum tomatoes, since they are little more than tomatoe skins and really are only marketed to trendy Americans and restaurants that cater to them. I did reduce by half the amount of oil the second time I made it because of diet considerations. Thanks.

A considerable amount of work for an utterley tasteless dish. I think my shoe would be tastier (and it's three years old). The use of plum tomatoes is probably the cause, perhaps sundried would be better

Made as is, with all top quality fresh ingredients and using small shrimp, we gave it a 2+. Then again, we're living in Italy, the land of great pasta so we're spoiled. Here's what we think will make it a 3 or 4: cut down on the garlic and feta cheese--they took on too much importance in the flavor balance -- and add more basil. Your parmesan cheese HAS to be a good quality and the shrimp HAS to be big and plump (popcorn shrimp won't carry it's weight). We will make it again because the recipe seems to have promise and can so many people who loved it be wrong?

This dish entertained 5 people with very different tastes. I only used 1 lb of feta cheese to cut down on fat, and it was more than enough. Prep takes about 30 minutes dicing and cutting everything. I served this with a caesar found here http://www.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=1244

Wonderful dish--the wild mushrooms add a lovely smoky flavor that offsets the brightness of the cheese. I cut the amounts of cheese added in half to cut down on fat and it was still great.

I made this last night and everyone loved it (all three teenagers and Dad). I took the advice of removing the tails - I agree, it makes it easier to eat. To comment on a previous review, perhaps if you had removed all the seeds from the tomatoes, you would have better results.

Is there any reason that you should leave the tails on the shrimp? It is a pain to eat that way and I thought I would remove the tails before cooking but it clearly said not to so I didn't. Any feedback?

FABULOUS. After years of eating at PJ'S in San Francisco I finally feel I have a recipe that can live up to their seafood pasta dishes. Yes, it may be $$ to make but well worth the splurge since we have little ones and don't get out much. I've made it 3 times and its been equal to restaurant dining each time.

Purchased imported parmesan for $7, feta cheese was $10, shrimp was $16, everything else was $6 more. For a grand total of $39. For a runny, watery shrimp soup with noodles. Not worth the effort of an hour and a half prep.

My grocery store was out of fresh basil, so, in a rush, I had to substitute dried. I was worried that it would just taste oily and plain but this recipe is fantastic! I got the "thumbs up" from my sweetheart on the first mouthful and I swore that I had only ever tasted something like this in a restaurant. I can't wait to try it with that wonderful fresh basil and I might add a few olives for fun. Simple and delicious!!!
