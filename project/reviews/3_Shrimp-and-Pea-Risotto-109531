This was far from being a bad meal, but I just wasn't impress. I simply think it's a casual weekday dinner. I did use chicken broth and a bit a fresh parmesan. Next time, i'll add some fresh herbs and a bit more cheese.

I make this all the time but I add a couple ounces of goat cheese at the end and I simmer the shrimp in chicken broth till cooked thru. Try it that way if you think it needs a little extra flavor. It's even better the next day.

Recipe is great. Peas make a frequent appearance in Northern Italian cuisine and really add just that bit of freshness you might crave while eating a heavy risotto. Instead of using the shimp stock, I used chicken broth- the water would make it taste too flat. Added about 2 tbsp of lemon juice from the zested lemon to add more freshness. Also, even though in Italian cooking you are not to have seafood and cheese together, I did blend the token parm at the end of the recipe since risotto is so much enhanced by it.

I made this last night because I happened to have all of the ingredients on hand and I was looking for something yummy to feed a guest. I followed the recipe pretty much as written, except that I used fresh peas, used 2 shallots and 2 cloves of garlic instead of the onion, and added some cream and freshly grated parmesan at the end (in hopes of improving the flavour). Like other people have said, it lacks zip (in my opinion), and isn't really anything special. However, the two guys at the table both liked it (or said they did, anyway... ;)

I love this recipe, and family members often request it when they come over they like it so much, too. I usually add parmesan at the end, and just a touch of truffle oil. So yummy.

I was pretty disappointed with this dish. It seemed to be too bland for my taste. My husband liked it more than I did though. If i'm going to go through this much trouble, I'll just find a better recipe

This was nice, but not fabulous. I followed the recipe with the addition of two cloves garlic with the onion, and about a half cup good parmesan with a tablespoon or so of butter before serving. It was good, but not great. I'll try again and see what happens next time.

I had to come up with a recipe for some frozen shrimp (already cooked), but I lacked a lot of the ingredients. Y'all might like to try modifying this very flexible recipe. I had the shrimp and the peas. Had to use chicked stock. Took the advice to add butter and parmesan at the end. Chopped about 3 cloves of garlic and a lot of ginger root instead of the onion. Used a bit more pepper in lieu of the chives. It was a huge hit -- sort of a Tuscan/Asian fusion. I heated the peas and shrimp only until warm. I think you could do many variations on this excellent basic recipe.

Excellent and easy to make. I used a seafood mix of scallops and shrimp, and bottled clam juice instead of the shrimp shells broth (much easier). Would do it agains!!!

I made this for the second time tonight and can't for the life of me figure out why it doesn't have a better rating and more reviews. This is delicious. I did add the parmesan cheese and a little extra butter at the end like the previous reviewers and found that gave it the perfect extra touch. I will definitely be making this, perhaps not every week, but on a reasonably regular schedule.

This is the first time I used a broth made from the shells when making shrimp risotto and it makes a huge difference. The dish had a much deeper shrimp flavor than when I use chicken stock. I put a bit of lemon juice in the broth which was unnecessary--the zest gives the dish plenty of lemon flavor. I also added two cloves of garlic to the recipe (with the onions), and added a little butter and a half cup of good grated Parmesan cheese right before serving, and both gave the dish the oomph that the other reviewer thought was lacking. Overall, very good.
