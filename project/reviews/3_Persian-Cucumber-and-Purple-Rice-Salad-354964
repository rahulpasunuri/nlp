I haven't eaten this yet, but FYI 1 serving = 5 Weight Watchers "pointsplus" points

What a waste of cucumbers! For the amount of work involved, I expected better, but even if this was effortless it's not worth the trouble. Unimpressive flavors and greasy after sitting a while. I'm going to do what I can to salvage it, but more likely I'll just end up throwing the whole thing out.

I did not have their rice, so I used Uncle Ben's Sun-Dried Tomato Florentine Wild Rice. This was so easy and so very tasty! I will make this again.

This salad turned out very nice, though I made the following alterations: added 1 tsp. sumac, fresh ground pepper, cubed feta and a little chopped parsley. As I did not have purple jasmine rice I used forbidden or black rice and the colors were lovely.

To answer your question: The recipe isn't missing anything. A vinaigrette doesn't need vinager, just an acid. In this case, the lemon juice is the acid.

Is this recipe missing something? The description says "lemony coriader accentuates the citrus in the vinaigrette," but there's no vinegar in the recipe. Help!
