I just blanched the favas (removed from the pod, but still in their waxy inner skins) for 5 minutes and then did not cook them again after the second shelling; it was perfect. We liked this dish a great deal and would make it again, serving it as a side dish or with a salad for a light summer meal. It made great leftovers for lunches the next day, too.

Made this with fresh lima beans (fresh fava beans not available) cooked in boiling water without oil,red onion and a very generous amount of mint (more than 1/2C). It was delicious. Had no idea mint would go so well.

Simple and scrumptious! This was my first time using fresh favas, wasn't too much of a pain at all. The mint makes this dish!

I was pretty underwhelmed with this. Somehow it didn't have very much taste, even with the onion & mint (both from my garden).

This just didn't do it for me...

I hate to say, edamame is good but there's nothing like fresh fava beans. As for the difficulty, first grow your own fava beans (it's fun and easy) then give them to a child (3-5 years old is a good age) to hull and peel. You may have to help with the peeling (or give the task to an older child), but the hulling is a great way to get kids involved.

Fantastic. Used butter instead of olive oil and a white onion because I didn't have a red one on hand. Making it again tonight, since fava beans are in season at the farmers' market. Hubby loved it. Yum!

I used half shelled, frozen edamame and half frozen sweet peas because that's what I had on had. Cooked as directed, then sprinkled some freshly grated pecorino-romano cheese on top. Quick, healthy, delicious.

My family seemed to like this much more than I did. It was good, but not great. I used frozen, pre-shelled edamame, which worked well. Otherwise made as written. I used a little too much salt, so I recommend being careful about that. Very easy, fast, and healthy.

This was absolutely deliciousand speedy. I unfortunately couldn't find fava beans so I substituted Adamame instead. It worked very nicely. A keeper!

Too much work, some of you say? Shelling and skinning the fava beans is a lot less work than ... shelling english peas, and it's roughly comparable to shelling fresh black eyed peas. You wimps! Does everything have to be as easy as tearing open a bag of frozen vegetables? I, for one, am happy to take 10-15 minutes and shell the fresh beans and peas, It's worth the work, for those fresh flavors!

My CSA didn't give me anywhere near enough favas. So I added some shredded cabbage and tossed this with whole wheat pasta and topped it with a fried egg. Pretty good.

Fresh favas are a pain in the butt. It's better to just blanch them for three minutes max and then pop them out of their skin. For this recipe, upping the mint and going easy on the onion helps the fava flavor shine. Nice easy spring recipe!

Not worth the work.....

Skinning broad beans need not be such a hardship if you boil then before skinning them. After they've cooled, pierce the skin at the end and pinch it: the bean will come right out. Make sure not to overcook them, 8 minutes was a bit too much. A splash of balsamic vinegar helps.

This might be a good tip for this recipe. I have found very good quality frozen, shelled fava beans. For this recipe I simply thawed them and used them "frozen raw". As would happen, when I went to use the recipe I found that I didn't have it, so I had to improvise. Basically, the only thing I missed was instead of cooking the red onion, I used a couple slices raw. This little recipe was a hit, for a snack time with other stuff and wine.

Shelling was one thing, but peeling the beans took FOREVER, and while the salad was ultimately very tasty, I don't know if I'd make it again unless I had help shelling and peeling all those beans. Also, I bought 2 lbs of beans and even tho the recipe says 2 1/2 it was nowhere near 3 cups, maybe half that. I used less than one onion and quite a bit of salt. If I do make it again, I might try adding a little vinegar or lemon to make the flavors pop

This recipe was delicious and very spring. The mint made the dish. It is a ton of work shelling the beans but definitely worth making once a year.
