I was amused the first time I saw this recipe - come on, don't we all know how to do a hard boiled egg? Even my father could cook one, or rather he could tell you how to cook one! However, this actually works and consistently enables a clean separation between the shell and the egg white.

I like the turn of the heat method, though it is a bit more "high maintenance." My shells come off with out the egg white when I add salt and vinegar to the water (not too much though). I was always told the blue or green appearance of the yolk meant they were over cooked.

Where's the wine pairing?

I'm with you carolmce from Elk Grove....I can never get my shells to come off without eggwhite attached.. It makes for some pretty ugly stuffed eggs....not to mention the frustration....I too have tried the older eggs... I will try this one tonight...

I tried this, and the eggs came out perfectly. No green around the yolk at all. Just perfectly cooked white and yellow.

Strange--in my family the perfectly cooked hard boiled egg has a fully cooked yolk--crumbly and with the coveted blue exterior! We saw the same preference in China when we visited. Different strokes for different folks!

I was happy to see this method of cooking hard boiled eggs. I have tried the "turn off the heat method" and the eggs are not cooked to our liking.

To carolmce from CA: when eggs are done, immediately immerse them in ice cold water; this usually helps the shells come off easily.

I'd like to have a foolproof way to boil eggs so that the shells come off easily. Nothing frosts my cupcakes more than to have half the white come off with the shells! Yes I have tried using older eggs.

This is the way I've always made hard boiled eggs. Is there another way?? Funny to see this on epicurious.com!
