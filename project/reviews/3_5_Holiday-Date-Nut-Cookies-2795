I took these into work recently and got a lot of positive comments. People liked the chewy texture of the cookies. As for the scant dough versus the large amount of fruits and nuts- I think this dough is meant to resemble a fruit cake. Those recipes have just enough dough to hold together the other ingredients. Of course, unlike fruitcake, these cookies don't have the rum and the weird glow-in-the-dark candied fruit. Because this made such a large pile of dough- I froze some. It freezes fine and the cookies were great.

I used the exact amounts of fruit & nuts - there was barely enough dough to hold these cookies together. My husband thought they tasted like a dry Nutrigrain bar. Not exactly the "wow factor" you're looking for on a holiday cookie platter.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. It was expensive buying dried fruits and nuts, not to mention the work involved in all the chopping and mixing. It was really difficult to stir the hard dough. In the end, they turned out all right, but not great. They just looked like plain round balls. I never have problems with cookie baking. But my husband said he did not care for them. We took them to the office party and people liked them but they were not particularly exciting.

Very nice indeed for dried fruit lovers. I substituted mixed candied orange and lemon rind instead of the pineapple.

I made these for the first time. My husband thinks these are the best cookies ever. If you like nuts this is your cookie. The only substitution was macadamia nuts for brazil nuts. Will definitely make again.

You bet I will be making these again (and again and again!). I put these into the tins of assorted cookies that I made for my neighbors this past Christmas. Every person who tasted this cookie loved it--and so did I. In my opinion, it will be a treat at any time of year, and I won't wait until Christmas to make this recipe again. :) Thanks.

This time I used the pineapple (omitted it last time), substituted walnuts for the brazil nuts and used soy margarine instead of butter, and these cookies still came out wonderful! I keep getting compliments on them, and I'm so glad I made a whole batch this time. They're delicious!

I made these yesterday, and they are delicious! I used macadamias instead of Brazil nuts (don't like 'em) and candied cherries instead of pineapple (my store was out of pineapple). They are moist, rich and very Christmas-y! I made the whole batch....I'm glad I did, as they are rapidly disappearing!

WOW - definitely my favorite among the 6-7 cookies I made this year. Received rave reviews from all friends and family. The recipe makes a huge batch - I used a 1T scoop and the size seemed just right. Will keep this on my holiday cookie list.

I'm not a fan of candied fruit, but these cookies were really very good and not too sweet. I took them to the office and everyone loved them. I was even asked for the recipe, which is a true compliment. Definitely will make them again for others.

Made this as part of my cookie tray for the holidays and received many compliments. This is a substantial cookie, chock full of fruit and nuts, and very good. Next time, I'll try substituting macadamias for the brazil nuts.

These cookies are absolutely luscious! I made them for the first time today, 12-18-01, and I will make them every Christmas from now on. Wonderful texture-chewy and crunchy and not too sweet. I chopped everything in my food processor and bought my almonds already slivered, so this was a very easy recipe to make. What a great change from sugar and chocolate cookies. My husband described the flavor of these cookies as "heavenly." I highly recommend this recipe.
