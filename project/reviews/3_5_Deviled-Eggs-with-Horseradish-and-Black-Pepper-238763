The pickle juice is a mistake: the mixture was delicious before I added it but way too sweet after. Chopped sweet pickles might be okay. I added quite a bit more horseradish, a spoonful of Dijon mustard and some grated shallot, and it balanced it out. The pepper is important too, for our tastes anyway. With these adjustments these are really good deviled eggs.

Just served this at a Holiday party. A hit. Gone before everything else AND everyone is asking for the recipe. I didn't put as much black pepper as was called for, but other than that, I followed the recipe to a tea. Yummy!

I didn't use the juice but the actual relish. A bit runny so next time I would cut back on the mayo (i use sour cream tho, not a huge mayo fan) -- perhaps only 4 tbls. Horseradish is key. I would prolly just grate it fresh into it. I added the mustard and a tsp of apple cider vinegar to stabilize the dairy and also give a tang. It balanced out the sweet relish and rounded out the spice from the 'radish.

I made as the recipe called for first- but I ended up adding 1 tsp country dijon mustard as suggested by reviewers. Don't use poor quality prepared horseradish-- splurge for the good stuff. I used a cheapo kind and then discovered I had some good stuff in my fridge and added it, the cheap stuff was bland and overly sour. Next time I might actually grate fresh horseradish instead, I bet it would make a huge difference.

Nice subtle twist on classic deviled eggs. Made these with the eggs my son dyed and with ingredients that my mother-in-law had readily available. She didn't have fresh parsley but I added a couple of thin slices of sweet gerkin pickle to the top of each for a little color and sweet crunch. Also, just mashed the mixture with a fork and cut down on the pickle juice so the mix was just a little on the soft side. I'll definately make these again next Easter if not sooner!

I used relish instead of juice, but they still ended up runny. I'm going to try them again this weekend and use fresh dill and no relish or juice. Overall the taste was really good.

I used Olive Oil mayo (no discernible diff and a little healhier), added about 1/2 tsp Colman's hot mustard powder, used sweet relish juice (or sweet gherkin juice would be fine) and just a wee pinch of garlic powder. Sprinkled w/mild paprika rather than the parsley. It's absolutely worth buying the 12-pack of already hard-boiled eggs for this recipe (I also do a version of egg salad using the "devil" ingredients but also adding a little pickle relish and not just juice, a touch of white vinegar, less horseradish, finely chopped celery...)

The horseradish makes a WORLD of difference. To those who had the recipe come out runny: I would not recommend using a food processor. Use those biceps! Egg yolk falls apart easily and giving the mixture a bit (not huge chunks) of texture is not a bad thing, especially when it is paired with the slickness of a boiled egg white. I did a variation on this recipe with by substituting the pickle juice for sweet relish, adding mustard powder to taste, and replacing half the mayo with horseradish mayo (a.k.a creamy mayo). It turned out really well. I don't expect to take any of these home with me after tomorrow's holiday party...

These were fine but no different than regular deviled eggs...just a dash of horseradish, which I definitely recommend.

I used sweet relish rather than just the juice, as other reviewers have suggested. On balance, I think the flavor of horseradish just isn't suitable for deviled eggs. Worth a try, but I won't make again.

I know it's a basic recipe, but we all need those. Sometimes simple is best. I enjoyed the flavor of the horseradish...just a little bit diff't without taking away from being a basic deviled egg.

I added 4 sweet pickles + the pickle juice plus 2 tablespoons capers. Just spooned into eggs - much simpler. Delicious.

Best Deviled Eggs Ever! I used 2 tsp pickle juice instead of 2T and omitted the parsley (really, they weren't on the serving platter long enough to take the time to make them pretty).

I thought this was pretty good but not as good as the recipe with tarragon and capers. I used gherkin juice as in one of the reviews. I think the parsley can be skipped - didn't add much.

This recipe was very simple to put together, one tip I would give anyone doing this is buy the eggs already boiled and shelled, saves a lot of time. The eggs were pretty good, but lacked a little something. I replaced 2 tbs dijon for 2 tbs mayo and omitted the pickle juice and added some lemon juice instead. The horseradish was definitely great, but I think adding the pickle juice would brighten up the flavor just enough to make it stand out more. I'll try that next time.

Excellent! Made this for a cocktail party yesterday. Used juice from gherkins and added a little Dijon. Very popular!

More like 3.5 forks. Made this in the food processor and just added creamy horseradish and mayo until the yolks got to be as spicy and creamy as I wanted them to be. I left out the pickle juice for personal taste. Great make ahead, though you may want to keep the prepared eggs in a separate cooler/fridge from odor-sensitive foods.

I made these the other night and I thought they were amazing. I used sweet pickle relish instead of the juice and they were not runny at all. I skipped the parsely, too. They were so good, I had them for breakfast the next morning with leftover steak. Yum!

Made for 4th of July big hit. I didn't use processor just mashed with fork til smooth. Maybe due to this I had no running, I actually had to add more mayo.

These are not very good. I tried sprucing them up with a little wasabi, lemon juice and good olive oil (withholding some of the sauce ensuring they wouldn't be too runny) but I couldn't override that off-putting flavor from the sweet pickle juice. Maybe some Dijon would have helped, but save your time and energy and keep looking.

The recipe sounds great, as I love horseradish, but I can't believe we have to buy a whole jar of sweet pickles just to get two tablespoons of the juice for the recipe. I don't have any just sitting around, and don't like them anyway, so I'd end up tossing the whole jar. There must be something we can substitute that adds the same flavor, no?

Great flavor, but I agree that they were too runny. Maybe because I used light mayo?

These were wonderful! I added even more horseradish than called for and dill pickle juice as that was what we had on hand. Delicious - went great w/feta burgers!

Left out the pickle juice to avoid runniness...Can also add some teeny baby shrimp...Also add a little less mayo and do add some Dijohn mustard.

I haven't tried yet, but I have always made deviled eggs with horseradish and a little mustard, etc. I think everyone has a particular "deviled egg taste" they look for.. So its interesting the reviews are either love 'em or don't like them at all. This recipe is about the same as my "made up" recipe...

amgdixon - you might have done something wrong if you did it correctly they wouldn't have been runny :( anyways these are AMAZING.

I made these for July 4th and added 1 tsp dijon mustard and a little less salt. They were a hit. Not one left

These were a huge hit at our 4th of July party. I only used half the yolks, 3 tbsp. mayo and 3 tbsp. nonfat sour cream. Didn't need to blend the yolks, just mash with a folk. I'm sure they'd be just as good as written, but I always look for lower-fat alternatives.

We liked the horseradish flavor but the consistency was too runny to stay in the egg white halves. I called them "deviled egg shooters." Mash the yolks by hand and add ingredients as you go so they don't end up so runny.

I made this recipe for a pot luck yesterday and didn't like it at all. I thought that it was just me, although I do like horseradish but the flavors just didn't go together. I ended up pitching them. Not sure what the problem is.

I made these deviled eggs yesterday and am sorry to say that I didn't like them at all. The flavors just didn't seem to go together and I ended throwing them all out. Even my husband, who is a big fan of deviled eggs, didn't like them.
