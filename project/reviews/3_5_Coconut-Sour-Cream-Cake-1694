I used unsweetened cream of coconut. It was tasty, like a tres-leches cake. However - between the cream of coconut, sour cream, eggs, and flaked coconut - WOW, was this cake heavy/fat-laden! I would only make it again if I were serving it to a large group where everyone only needed a small piece.

really easy and hard to screw up. i avoid baking because of all the steps and measuring involved but this recipe is so easy. i cut the cream of coconut in half as the cake mix is already very sweet. i'm thinking of just adding coconut extract and/or coconut milk to get the coconut flavor without all the added sugar. the sour cream makes this very moist and adds a nice tangy flavor

So easy and good-be sure not to overcook the cake-love the toasted coconut!

Being from Knoxville, this is a cake my mother swears is her recipe. Who knows, I'm sure she started making it because The Orangery made a great one too. I can tell you that she splits the layers of the cake so that it makes four layers. She lets it "marinate" at least overnight for the most wonderful wet and delicious flavor imaginable. I love my mom, but her memory is slipping. She doesn't recall that she ever made it these days.

This cake was a hit. I put about 1/2 C. of coconut in the batter and used a little more Cream of Coconut to compensate. Also, baked it in two layers and used the frosting from this recipe: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Giant-Coconut-Layer-Cake-105698. It was delicious. PS: Did not toast the coconut and it was perfect!

Easy, light and flavorful. I used a French Vanilla mix and unsweetened cream of coconut, it was lovely. A bit of whipped cream at serving tops it off.

This is a truly quick and easy recipe for a fantatic cake. The cake is very moist and light.It melts in your mouth. It is difficult to just eat one slice. I gave the recipe to my friends snd the love it. Many of them serve it at their functions. I do like a lot of frosting on my cakes, so I add a small amount of cream cheese and a dash of lemon juice with lots of coconut. This takes the frosting to a different level. For those of you who cannot find CoCo Lopez, please look in the Liquor section of your Super Market. Usually it is in the section of Mixes in the liguor department. Liquor stores will always have it but cost more. Use the left over CoCo Lopez to make a Pina Colada!!!

This may be the easiest, most delicious (and moistest!) cake I've ever made. You won't believe the texture! I sought this recipe out after a friend mentioned a craving for coconut cake prior to a dinner party. It was easy and fast enough to make the afternoon of the dinner and it turned out beautifully! I couldn't get my hands on Coco Lopez so I used a thai brand of canned coconut milk and added a bit of coconut extract to enhance the flavor. Also, to make a slightly more elegant presentation, I baked two 9" rounds and used a coconut flavored cream cheese frosting (also from this site) to make a layer cake. I put fresh coconut between the layers and topped the cake with a bit of toasted coconut for garnish. It was so delicious that it is the only dessert any of them ever request now! And I frequently have to make an extra cake for my family so they don't get cranky when I don't bring leftovers home. It's a winner and one that is going in my permanent recipe collection!

I really, really enjoyed this. A couple things that made it better: I used the coconut cream off of a can of coconut milk (if you don't shake it, you can scrape off the top), mixed with creme fraiche, then made the consistency similar to coconut cream using leftover coconut milk. This made it very rich tasting. I also made double the icing/frosting using the same creme fraiche/coconut milk/sour cream mix and added some white sugar and vanilla for flavor. Covered in pecans and about double the toasted coconut (only natural, though a mix of sweetened and natural may have been better). It gave the cake some oomph. The cake turned out amazing. So incredibly moist, rich, and flavorful. Will definitely make again.

I thought this cake was simple and delicious. I did serve it with ice cream because I think without it, it may have needed more frosting or a glaze of some sort. Not exactly a show-stopper but perfect ending for a simple spring supper. I added lots of coconut on top and I wouldn't recommend using a lower-fat sour cream.

I don't like coconut, but my family does. So, I made this cake for Easter to take to my mom's. My mom, dad, and grandmother all raved about it! My grandmother wants me to make it for her 89th birthday next month. I guess it must taste terrific because they are all hard to please.

My husband made this cake for my birthday - he had never baked a cake before and had no problems because it was so easy. It was also the best cake I ever had! I was a little concerned because there isn't really a frosting on it and it is a sheet cake, but it is so tasty and unbelievable moist that it doesn't need layers or frosting! The sour cream and lemon add a little tanginess that is perfect. I will make it again and again....

I made this cake using a "Pudding in the Mix" French Vanilla cake because it is what I had on hand. This goes together so easily...and was quite good. I did add about 3/4 cup coconut to the cake itself, and still found a rich coconut flavor lacking. Maybe some coconut extract added??? Frosted with an orange flavored buttercream icing. VERY nice........

I make this cake for a party. Everyone loved it, especially with vanilla ice cream on the side. PLus it was very easy. I could not find coco Lopez, and used Goya brand cream of coconut instead.

Delicious! This recipe could not be easier. I made it for the first time with my two young nieces who enjoyed helping me add the ingredients and then the mixing. I also made it on a weeknight for a co-worker's birthday. It was a hit in the office and I'll surely make it again. I agree with other reviewers that it's a great cake for the Easter season. I'd even consider using a little pastel food coloring in the white cake to make it a little more fun and seasonal.

I made this cake for Easter dinner gathering of family and friends. It was simply delicious...SIMPLE...being the operative word. Easiest cake I ever made! Got rave reviews. I omitted the topping and went with a cream cheese frosting with toasted coconut on top. The tanginess of the frosting matched well with sweet cake.

I made this cake for a holiday party. I left before dessert but I got my dish back empty and many requests for the recipe. I thought the cake was very moist with a great coconut taste. The best part, it was easy to make.

I thought this was a delightful cake--sweet without being too overwhelming. I made the recipe and then baked it in two 6 inch bundt pans and adjusted the baking time. It was so good plain that I felt it didn't need the glaze/shredded coconut--could use just a dusting of powdered sugar if you needed to dress it up a little.

Easy and good. A little sweet for my tastes, but with a cup of coffee its great. Beautifully moist. My non-coconut loving boyfriend raved about it.

This is a great cake and it seems like you could make some fun variations. I want to try again with pineapple topping or into a layer cake.l

I love coconut. I usually like anything with it. However I found this cake pretty bland. I kept thinking it needed something - like some sort of icing. Pouring coconut cream/sugar and toasted coconut over the warm cake just didn't do it.

This cake was the hit at my luncheon. The blend of sour cream and coconut made the cake moist and delicious. Had to share the recipe with 12 women.

This is fabulous. I had it in the house for 3 days since only two of us are there, it lasted very, nice. With each day the cake sat, the cake got moister and moister. The 4th day, we gave it to a friend, the leftovers, and he saw me later that day in a pastry/coffee shop. He screamed, "You are not going to buy any of those pastries? Your coconut cake was by far superior to these!!" The only change I made was that I used a French Vanilla box of cake mix, since I had it on hand. In a word the cake is DECADENT with being too sweet, PERFECT.
