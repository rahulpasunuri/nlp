What a wonderful salad. Easy to make and wonderful to eat. I used roated pecans as I like them better than walnuts,and I will definately be making this salad for holiday pot lucks as it is easy and tastes great. Definately a keeper!

Great salad. The crispy pancetta adds a nice twist to this salad.
