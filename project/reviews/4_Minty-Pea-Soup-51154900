Followed recipe exactly. Fresh taste of Spring - even though I used petite frozen peas. Goes together in a snap and looks absolutely beautiful.

Excellent spring change up from split pea soup. Teens to 90 year olds enjoyed it as starter for Easter meal. Used 2x 16 oz frozen petite peas and added 8oz bag (nuked) after immersion blender. Bit of cream added too and I did not use the creme fraiche. Added the whole amount of mint and parsley and it was great.

I made this soup almost exactly as directed. It was quick to make and impressive. It had a flavor so rich of fresh peas it instantly reminded me of a very memorable fresh pea soup from a restaurant in Paris many years ago. I used frozen peas, substituted olive oil for the butter (and cut the amount in half), used Rapunzel brand veggie broth cubes, and low fat yogurt instead of the creme fresh garnish. I can't wait to make it again!
