Very easy and delicious. I used a food processor to combine everything - as I do with all my pastry doughs and it was fast and fabulous.

this version is incredible and not complicated to make...the sky is the limit for the filling, I also tried it without the egg, also very good, but less crunchy

I highly recommend this empanada dough It's authentic and has a wonderful taste. My Chilean husband and kids loved it. But it is time consuming especially when tripling it! We needed more water than 1/3 cup. Most of you epicurious purists won't go for this because you're such great cooks but there's a few of you out there who are looking for the secret short cut when making empanadas. If that's you, read on. If not, skip this part. Secret: Get Pillsbury's Grand "Buttermilk" biscuits. If it makes you feel better, my mother-in-law from Chile told me about them in her broken English. They are richer than this dough because of all the LARD.(ewww). But they are much easier to work with and so much faster. For a change, we followed the ideas on here of using 3 inch cut outs for appetizers as oppose to the traditional 5 inch. These can be filled and then frozen easily in zip lock bags and reheated in the oven at 350 degrees for 15 minutes. Don't reheat in empanadas in the microwave. We fill ours with the recipes that call for ground beef, raisins, hard boiled egg, etc. Hmm. Now we're talking authentic Chilean love.

Fantastic recipe. Perfect dough. I'd recommend more ice water (closer to 1/2 or even 2/3 cup)--just add it bit by bit. Baste with plain egg yolk before baking (I did 400 for about 25 min)--perfect!

Great recipe. I made this last week and stuffed with egg, bacon, sausage, and cheese. Made larger 12" rounds and smaller 3" bite sized rounds. I prefer the smaller, but all were really good. Also made pizza pockets that were outstanding. I made this exactly as the recipe calls for. Only suggestion is to roll it out very thin. It will hold up and stretch some over your food. Use the egg wash for great color and a crispy outside.

Great recipe for dough. Made a double batch of 1/2 all-purpose; 1/2 whole wheat yesterday by hand. Never made pastry before and it was easy. Today, because of the leftover stuffing, I made a single batch of dough using foodie411's suggestion of using the processor. Worked like a charm. I've made appetizer size vegetarian empanada's using an empty cat food can to cut 3" discs; also made larger meat-filling ones using an empty yogurt container to cut 5" discs...these bigger ones I shaped into little footballs for the Grey Cup football party tomorrow. Love your recipes Epicurious, and the feedback from readers.

Good Stuff... Baked mine at 375 with the rack middle high on a half sheet. Keeping an eye on how they are browning Pulled them 10/12 min through cooking and brushed w/egg wash. Fill them with grated Gruyère Cheese, golden raisins and grilled roasted lamb. ...and some red wine!

Just made this last night -- it turned out pretty good! The flavor was tasty and buttery. Cut the dough into 3" rounds (make sure to roll the dough kind of thin), filled them with a sauteed mushroom and cheese mixture, chilled them for an hour, and then baked them. I ended up baking it instead of frying them as it was a healthier option. Baked them at 400 degrees for 20 minutes -- don't forget to coat them with egg wash first other wise they come out looking really white.

Did a double recipe, 1/2 white & 1/2 whole wheat flours, FANTASTIC! My 10 yr old friend did the rolling out and assembling of the empanadas and they were fantastic. (We did mixed veggies, ground beef, and cheese.) The whole wheat flour made them a little heartier and toastier tasting.

Beautiful, flaky dough! I stuffed mine with Spinach Artichoke dip and froze them. I didn't need to chill my dough before using, and I made the whole thing in the food processor! Wonderful :)

I brought these to a friend's house last night and everyone raved! I used the Potato, Pepper and Chorizo filling that is linked to this recipe. Very flavorful and the crust is nice and flaky. Made the dough in the food processor. It was easy to handle. The chopping and assembly were pretty time consuming, but worth the effort.

Although I like to think I'm pretty competent in the kitchen, I have never in 20+ attempts made a decent pastry dough until I tried this recipe. It is excellent, and easy. Made it with the beef filling recipe on this site. Had leftover filling but the dough recipe made about 20 3-inch empanadas. Rerolled dough scraps to eke out the last few and they were just as good as the rest.

I have never made any kind of pie dough or pastry crust and I wasn't sure if I would have any success with this dough, but it came out great! I took one reviewer's tip to make it in the food processor, which really saved time. The empanadas I made came out so flaky and rich. I'll definitely make this dough again.

Super easy to make. I made this dough, and then didn't use it for 2 days and it was still great. My first flaky crust ever. I baked these as the accompanying recipe calls for and they are like heaven. The dough was easy to work with and would probably make fantastic pie or tart crust with a slight addition of sugar.

I made this dough using olive oil instead of butter and it still turned out so flaky and scrumptious. I use this for empanada and samosa dough and it does the trick every time :)

This dough is a dream! Rolls out oh, sooooo smooth! Just be sure to flour your board and pin often. I couldn't believe how light and flaky this was. Even if you think you can't make a pie crust type pastry you should try this - in fact I think I may use this as my pie crust recipe going forward! I did it all using the food processor -- flour, salt and fat, pulse 4 times. Add liquids, pulse 3-5 times just till it comes together. Gotta go! It's time to have another one of these tasty morsels!

Wow! This was so much better than the frozen empanada dough! My husband said they reminded him of the ones his mom used to make from scratch. I filled mine with picadillo (we're Cuban), then fried them (again, we're Cuban). I have another batch of dough in the fridge to fill with ham and cheese rolls. Ay que rico!

I had only tasted empanadas made by my Latin American friends before and was intimidated; I will say that the beef empanada filling on this website left something to be desired but the crust is impeccable, easy to work with, wonderful baked texture, and defrosts very well. Use this pastry with your filling of choice!

I've always wanted to learn how to make empanadas. I used this recipe to make 230 of them for a large fundraiser and they received rave reviews! They turned out flaky, but not messy and crumbly. They were the perfect consistency. I stuffed them with picadillo beef, baked them and froze them. They reheat beautifully. Just put them in a 350 degree oven for 12-15 minutes.

Made this in Tasmania for my sister and her friends, to show them some 'Mexican' food that isn't ketchup in a hard taco. I made the filling w/out a recipe. Didn't want to deep fry, so I put a little egg wash on them and baked them at about 400 until they were golden brown. It still came out flaky and delicious!

3/4 cup of butter and an egg yolk instead of the whole egg results in a richer, but more crumbly crust.

I didn't have time to chill the dough and it still worked fine. I made a double recipe and received many compliments.

Great crust is the secret to Empanadas. I replaced 2T of the butter for 2T crisco and dumped it all in my food processer ala Julia Child It takes literally 3 minutes to make the dough.

Extremely simple and makes me wonder why people would get pastry puff as an alternative...

this recipe is just like a super flaky pie crust. i like to add a but more flour and have a more firm crust for baking purposes and then glaze with egg wash. this is a very useful savory dough which i love to prepare in a food processor....

I really do not like making doughs or pastries of any sort so when I made this dough I did not expext it to be good. But it was delicious! I had an Argentina-themed dinner party and my empanadas were a hit! Rolling out and stuffing the empanadas was a bit tedious but so woth it!

This is a fantastic recipe and so easy to make. We substituted the distilled vinegar with balsamic vinegar. I would definitely use this over and over again.

This is almost exactly the recipe I received from my sis-in-law for pie crust. I think that it's the vinegar that makes the dough so pliable. Excellent crispy, flaky crust and easy to work with. I'm making empanadas today.

This basic recipe made great empanada dough. I used a number of substitutes for what I had available, and it still turned out great. I left out the vinegar on account of my not having any and added an extra tablespoon of water with 3/4 teaspoon baking powder. As another reviewer had said, I used half a cup of olive oil instead of butter. I also baked the empanadas using my own beef filling. With a beaten egg and olive oil finished brushed over the empanadas. The dough came out flaky and tasty with a nice golden finish.

Good recipe. I have even used margarine instead of butter (gasp) which cuts the richness of the dough when I am doing party food and don't want butter in everything. Making the empanadas, baking them then freezing them works well for large batches. The reheat in the microwave well. Good recipe.

This is a great dough recipe. It was so silky and smooth. As I used my pasta machine to roll out the dough, I needed to sprinkle with flour every once in a while, thereby using more flour than called for. Turned out great anyway.

This is a great, simple pastry recipe; flaky but not overwhelming. I didn't end up with enough for 12, but did get a good 10 out of the recipe. With the leftover dough, roll it out and bake until brown for some amazing appetizer chips- no need to use the egg wash though for the chips.
