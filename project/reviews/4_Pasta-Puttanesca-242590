Easy to make, good but not great. Not assertive enough - next time will increase the anchovies (use anchovy filets, not the paste), red pepper flakes and capers.

This sauce is wonderful over spagetti squash. Also added a few meatballs.

delicioso. i made a few changes only because i had them in fridge, added onion, red bell pepper, flat anchovies, parsley. couldn't find my basil no matter how i looked in fridge. but when i served the dish hubby reminded me i was growing basil on the terrace. wow another senior moment. i served the sauce over spinach tortilini added grated parmagian cheese. served with an israeli style salad with mint to great acclaim. now i hope he'll take me to a casino except the ball game is on. ha-ha to the chef who remarked that virgin olive oil is not appropriate to the origin of the dish.

We enjoyed this recipe but thought it was a bit heavy on the olives. We enjoyed the flavor, but would probably add additional garlic and basil if we did it again. We will make it again but increase the other flavors and probably decrease the olives. We added chicken, which was delicious!

Very nice indeed! But considering the origins of this dish, do you think extra virgin olive oil is appropriate ;)

Excellent and easy! I use Fire Roasted tomatoes for a subtle smokey addition and I do not puree them.

Im not sure why i have not reviewed this recipe sooner!!!! Have been cooking it for several years now and it is breeze to prepare, all the ingreds are pantry staples. The addition of fresh basil is what brings the whole dish together. Have made with both tinned anchovy and the kind avalible in tube form. This dish has never failed to impress me no matter how many times I've made it!!!

This was quick, simple and delicious! Everyone loved it (even my father who thinks there should be meat served at every meal!). While I had to buy the anchove paste (which comes in a tube and keeps stored in teh fridge for a year) I had all the other ingredients on hand and this is my new simple go-to recipe!

The ingredients are pretty correct, but the technique is not - I would advise looking in one of the great italian cookbooks (modern versions of il cucchiaio d'argento for instance) for the proper way to do it - can end up a bit oily but the flavours are MUCH richer. By the way, the reason I learned (while living in Italy) for the name is not due to the cooking time, but that only someone with lots of money but no class/taste, would put so many delicate and complex flavours together in one dish - similar to the english phrase "whore's boudoir" which typically has lots of garish and expensive items, but jumbled together in a tacky and classless way. It's a good thing that the pasta sauce tastes good though! :)

Great recipe! Most ingredients are in the pantry, so you can have it on hand for last minute meals.

A good fast version of puttanesca; I omitted the anchovies (allergic), and added about 1/4t salt - I would leave it out altogether next time, as I think it's salty enough with the capers and olives. I also just used a bit of oil, enough to coat the pan.

Easy and delicious. I find whole wheat pasta really bland and don't like to make pasta dishes with it because of the lack of flavor, but this sauce is bold enough to keep it interesting. Also I use anchovies packed in oil instead of anchovie paste. I make a paste in a mortar & pestle with the garlic and saute it together. Works well for me.

Rating: 3
A very rich and flavorful sauce. I used five anchovy filets (chopped) and turned down the heat on the first step. Two tablespoons of dry white wine added with the tomatoes really opened them up and allowed skipping the sugar. DO NOT skip the fresh basil.

oh, and I chop up the olives.

I love this. I've made it several times as written, except I use 4 or 5 whole anchovies rather than the paste and I put in a little bit more red pepper flakes and I use whole tomatoes packed with basil rather than adding basil separately. LOVE IT -- so easy and fast. I top it with parmesan, but it's not necessary for deliciousness.

This may be tasty (looks like it would be okay, I've not made it), but it is NOT a proper puttanesca, and just looking at the ingredients I can tell it would lack the richness. For a start, it should use anchovy fillets, not paste, and oregano. The recipe should seem oil-heavy at the beginning, as the tomatoes (and they should be chopped tomatoes which will melt down) need to cook in them, giving them the richness. It's still a fast, good recipe, this is just wrong - without the proper cooking approach, this is just tomato sauce with anchovies and olives. I'd recommend the version in "Enciclopedia della cucina Italiana", a bible for me :) You can find the recipe transcribed at http://labuonacucinadikatty.blogspot.com/2009/11/spaghetti-alla-puttanesca.html - just run it through a translator for English. Otherwise Jamie Oliver's which is quite close: http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/jamie-oliver/spaghetti-puttanesca-recipe/index.html

Nice and simple. About 15 minutes of prep; the rest was cooking the pasta and stirring the sauce. I chopped the olives (didn't say to) and mashed, then chopped the garlic rather than pressing it. Comes on subtle at first but after a half dozen bites your mouth will be a flavor-fest. Definitely plan to make again, maybe with a little pancetta thrown in.

Rating: 4
Excellent, flavorful puttanesca recipe. I omitted the basil with no regrets. I also threw a fresh, seeded tomato in the blender with a little canned tomato sauce and used that pureed mixture in place of the canned tomatoes the recipe calls for. I'd like to know if other cooks have any thoughts on whether it would work to use fresh peppers (like peppadews) in place of dried pepper flakes?

My only Puttanesca Sauce came from the back of a Ronzoni pasta box which is terrific (has onions) but thought I'd try this one because of the reviews - for some reason, mega-salty. Perhaps the Kalamata or capers - not sure, but whew! Since I doubled the recipe for a girls' dinner I had to salvage it so to offset the salt, I added, in increments, white wine, fresh lemon zest and scant amounts of sugar to get the balance. Also, a great recipe I have from a restaurant in Boston adds butter at the end with basil, and there I go. It actually is tasting pretty good and the zest and basil gives it a fresh taste. Hope the girls like it - what can I say?

Instead of whole tomatoes, i use diced which eliminates the blender.I like the pieces of tomato in the sauce.Awesome quick,fabulously fragrant,gourmet meal.I make sure I have all ingredients on hand should i get a craving for it.

This was so simple yet so tasty - a real winner. I used whole plum tomatoes and crushed with a wooden spoon whilst it was simmering. I also used a whole tin of anchovies (diced) with their oil and chose not to add much more oil than that. I used fresh pasta and when I combined it with the sauce, stirred through about 1/4 c of good parmesan for taste and texture. If you dont like heat then dont add as much dried chilli flakes as the recipe calls for because it was a bit burney'. Result: a new midweek favourite.

Fantastic and so very easy. I followed the receipe exactly, except I added the basil leaves while the sauce simmered, and I used less olive oil (for health reasons). I may have overbrowned the garlic and it was still delicious!! This is my new go-to pasta recipe.

Very good taste... a nice recipe for a spicy dish. This is one of those dishes that improves with age so you can make it ahead and serve it the next day. I found you had to saute the garlic more than 2 minutes to get that nice brown color but otherwise a very dependable dish.

This is a terrific, cheap, fast and nutritious pasta dish. Only my son didn't like it because of the anchovies. Instead of messing with the basil, I used Italian style canned tomatoes with basil. It tasted great.

If I made this recipe as described I'd give it 4 forks. As it is, I can't really rate it: I used campanelle instead of spaghetti, minced my garlic since I didn't have a press on hand, reduced the olive oil to about a tablespoon, and left out the capers, basil and anchovies. But even with all those adjustments it was still delicious. The amount of bite from the chili peppers was just perfect. Next time I'll give the olives a rough chopping so they spread out a bit more. Other than that, I thought it was perfect, if not entirely exact.

Try whole canned plum tomatoes. Squish with fingers as you add them to the pan, and continue to break up with a spoon as the sauce simmers. If you prefer whole anchovies over a paste, as I do, try soaking them in warm water for 5 minutes. They soften right up.

This I've made this a few times and I really like it. One time I used a can of tuna in the sauce (omitted that anchovy) and that was really good too. I always make sure to have all the ingredients on hand.

Very tasty, made it with penne pasta, crushed tomato and a bit more anchovy paste. I let the sauce simmer down a bit more so it wasn't so watery. Very good!

I loved this recipe - and have made it 4 times in the few weeks - sooooo delicious! Only recommendation is to watch the salt - make sure you rinse your capers - or if you use mashed anchovy fillets instead of the paste take into consideration the increased salt content - this is probably cooking 101 don't laugh... BUT as an amateur who loves cooking with wine in hand...word to the wise...

This gets points for being easy and requiring little to no shopping. The result is "weeknight dinner good" and I will certainly be going back to this recipe again and again, although I would make a couple of small modifications, mostly with regard to the timing. I think in order to better bring out the flavors, the sauce needs to simmer for much longer than called for and I would prepare the sauce well before I started boiling the pasta. Also, I think you need to use several anchovy fillets (If using instead of paste) in order to taste their flavor. I'm sure the paste is much more concentrated. I bumped up the garlic and pepper flakes and will do so again and I might increase the olives and capers. I skipped the sugar and don't think I missed anything. Parmesan on top is a must! Enjoy!

gtg422x: You did not make puttanesca! Puttanesca is a classic dish that has very specific ingredients. It drives everyone else on this site completely crazy when recipes are reviewed when they don't resemble the original recipe. Having said that, I agree with the other people who said that this was fantastic. It was the best thing that I've made in a while, and I didn't even have to leave the house to shop for the ingredients! If you don't want to buy the paste (like I didn't), I would suggest gently sauteeing the anchovies in olive oil--they melt and basically make an awesome paste. Then add the rest of the ingredients. I would use more anchovies and garlic than the recipe calls for, though. Just don't do something like adding bell peppers and mushrooms. That is NOT puttanesca! Which, by the way, translates to 'whore's pasta'. How fun.

Good, but I would recommend cutting back the olive oil to 2-3 tablespoons. I also threw the basil in while the sauce was simmering, added a few drops of lemon juice, extra olives and red pepper. I also let the sauce cook down for 10 extra minutes before I added the pasta. Another reviewer added tomato paste as a thickener and this would probably be a good idea.

Quick, easy and so tasty. I added a few things...Small can of roasted red toms in addition to the plain canned tomatoes, and a few dollops of tomato paste to thicken. I also made my own anchovy paste since the store did not have any...just ground up some anchovies in the food processor with the oil....I am not even a hard core pasta person and I thought this was great.

Made this last night on my daughter's first night home from college. Everybody loved it (including my husband who doesn't love olives). Easy, tasty. Next time I may up the red chili flakes.
