This recipe was very simple to put together and is great for a crowd. I found that the herbs left a very light flavor on the corn, which was perfect because it allowed the corn to shine as the main ingredient. Rosemary and oregano would probably work well in this recipe too, particularly if either of those ingredients were in other dishes on the menu. The one thing I would do next time is salt and pepper the corn after buttering it so those flavors have a chance to mix with the butter and herbs. Because this is a make-ahead recipe it's on my list of keepers for entertaining. The wrapped corn makes for a pretty presentation too.
