Hard to beat the flavor this packs with so little trouble. Mine was also very thick but once it was over the rice it didn't matter. Guests went back for seconds and didn't have room for dessert.

Four forks for being fast, easy and delicious. I sauteed the veg in coconut oil and added a couple of dashes of fish sauce to pump up the flavor. My current stash of red pepper flakes are sadly underpowered, so I also used a fresh, chopped jalapeno and a squirt of Siracha. Served with rice.

Looking for something different from NOLA fare for Fat Tuesday, came across this and thought: Mardi Gras goes south: Carnivale! I used sole fillets (on sale) for the fish and canned, diced tomatoes with their juice, instead of fresh because "fresh" winter tomatoes are generally awful. So it was more of a thick seafood soup, instead of stew. Chopped the cilantro and green onion together in mini-prep and added all at once (chopping cilantro is so tedious). Per recommendation, I added some smoked paprika and was generous with black pepper. It is rather an expensive dish (3 lbs of fish and shrimp!), but it very easy, very tasty, and is a keeper. Great with a baguette for dunking. Not sure how it will be as leftovers---most fish and seafood dishes are rubbery the second time around.

I'm new to cooking but this dish was easy to make. Made it for about 14 people and they loved it. I rubbed the shrimp with a little cayenne powder and let them sit for 5 mins. The stew came out with just enough kick and flavor to be spicy, but not overwhelming. I used tilapia for the fish.

Being married to a Brazilian, moqueca is a staple in our home. This recipe is missing one key ingredient, however - dende (red palm oil) - about two teaspoons. Also a small tablespoon of tomato paste stirred in with the coconut milk adds flavor and color. This recipe works well with mahi mahi and ono too.

There is nothing I love more on a cold evening, than slipping my spoon into a hot bowl of this stew. The combination of flavors is wonderful. I follow the recipe almost exactly, but will sometimes add a splash of dry white wine. It's best eaten on the first night so I usually make it when we have guests. Make sure to serve it with crusty bread for dipping up the liquid.

This is a household staple, I make it at least once a month and it is always delicious. The only thing I leave out is the shrimp. I often use Basa fillets, and have used halibut as well. It's always a big hit, and is much easier to make than the final presentation would make it seem.

Very nice! Used Halibut tails for white fish and shrimps.

Wow! This was my first fish stew and I LOVED it! It was so buttery-rich and flavorful! I forgot to salt and pepper the fish before marinating, and I'm rather glad I did--it didn't need anything else. I look forward to making this again. NOTE: dump the coconut milk into a container and stir to mix FIRST....

Made this for the first time for my boyfriend when we celebrated the first day of fall. A perfect meal for the chill night. I added some red pepper for more color and served it with some warm baked artisan bread. We couldn't put our spoons down. We like it spicy, so I added some extra crushed red pepper. I can't wait to make this for my friends! Yum yum.

I had a seafood moqueca at a restaurant in Provincetown and wanted to make it for guests, so of course I looked here for a recipe. I basically followed this recipe with a few changes. Just a dash of red pepper flakes (spice phobic guests), but added about 1/2 of a jalapeno (no seeds), and 1 1/2 poblanos (no seeds). I also added red bell pepper in addition to the green. Since it's tomato and corn season here I used fresh local tomatoes and I also added three ears of corn that I first cooked and cut off the cob. Delicious!

Made this last night for a romantic New Year's eve dinner. Both my boyfriend and I agreed that this is one of the nicest dishes we've ever had. I'm thrilled I found such a tasty and simple recipe  will definitely be making this one again. I served the stew with an arugula-pear salad with a lime dressing and toasted pumpkin seeds, and with some freshly baked jalapeno cornbread. I halved the recipe and used red/orange peppers instead of the green, and added twice the amount of coconut milk called for.

People went crazy for this when I made it for a large group. I added extra coconut milk (almost double) and palm oil is great add if you can find it. I also pan-fried the fish (I used red snapper and tilapia) before putting it in the stew. Delicious.

Very pleasant dish, the sauce is mild and creamy and lets the seafood shine through. (The spiciness must depend quite a bit on ones chiliss--I minced up some small dried red peperoncini, the Italian style ones, and it wasn't hot at all) It's quick to whip up, I think this one will be entering the weeknight rotation...

We loved this stew, it was so flavorful and pretty easy to make. The only thing I will do different next time, is not so much pepper, it was a little too spicy, and way more shrimp!! We loved it though!!

Here in Brazil this is called Moqueca and it is extraordinary. Cook the fish a little more longer depending on the thickness of cut, and add the shrimp later so it cooks less time. The dish is usually served with a side dish called Pirão, but ingredients are harder to get outside Brazil. More info in Portuguese at culinaria.terra.com.br, such as a nice variation made with salmon and a touch of champagne. Yum!

Disappointing, lack-luster flavor. For the effort, price of ingredients and time, the Ciopinno from this site is much more satisfying. I've used recipes from this site every week for the past 5 years and this is the first review I've ever submitted. I felt compelled to say this is a let down.

This dish takes very little time (for a stew) and the results are delicious. I agree there's a lot of room for experimenting with the type of seafood and the seasonings. We like spicy food, so I added a good bit more red pepper flakes and some Cholula sauce. This will be on heavy rotation at my house.

This has made it in to my Top Ten recipes I will make again and again. It's great as a soup with crusty bread on the side or over basmati rice. Everyone loves it and it's easy to prep the ingredients in advance and throw it together at the last minute.

This was unbelievably easy, delicious, and leaves lots of room for experimenting! Tossed a can of tomatoes in the blender and added that for a thicker broth, but the chunks of fresh tomatoes were essential as well. Often make coconut milk dishes but my boyfriend said this was the best thing I've ever made. Served with the incredible avocado/persimmon salad and a good pinot noir, it was a great and easy meal. Oishii!

This dish was unreal. I loved it, my husband loved it, our guests loved it, it is easy and fast to make...what more could you want? I made it without the palm oil and it tasted fine to us. I also used fresh chillis instead of chilli flakes. I would recommend cooking the tomatoes and peppers for longer to blend the flavours better and stirring in the coconut milk right before serving. I stirred it in and cooked with the tomatoes and I found that seemed to diminish the flavour of the coconut milk.

I can not say how pleased I am to see this recipe for Brazilian stew, was a favourite of mine at "Twocan" in Sydney. Fresh baby octopus or as others have mentioned, mixed seafood from the fish market is a great alternative. And the palm oil adds the real Brazilian touch. BRILLIANT!

There is a reason this dish doesn't serve the number of people it says it does - - it is so delicious that people can't stop eating it! I had 1 1/2 pounds of seafood (orange roughy, bay scallops and shrimp) and only two of us finished the entire thing, practically licking the plate! I don't want to know how much fat is in this dish - - it's probably a heart attack in a skillet, but it's absolutely incredible. I'll definitely make it again, but I think I'll try to reserve it for special occasions.

I distrust people who claim to review a recipe - and then go on about all the changes they made. They are "reviewing" their own creation, not the recipe as presented. And I am about to do the same. I read many of the previous reviewers comments and adopted some. My boyfriend and I do not like green peppers, so I used a poblano and a red pepper. One of my favorite items is "what's on sale" and therefore used that - Thai Snapper and a Frozen Seafood Medley of shrimp. mussels, clams, squid and octopus. Loved the coconut and lime combination and the heat. A good, easy recipe and am glad to have it in my stock of quick, easy and inexpensive.

I too use canned tomatoes. I have tried this without the fish and all shrimp but it is much better with the fish. Lite coconut milk is fine by me. Cilantro is a must.

I used turbot, bay scallops and littleneck clams in this dish and it was delicious. I also used green and red bell peppers, which gave this stew a lovely contrast of color. I deglazed the pan with a bit of white wine before adding the coconut milk. Next time, I will reduce the coconut milk prior to adding the seafood, as the broth in the stew was a bit thinner than I would have liked. Easy and delicious stew!

This stew was awesome! I cheated with prep b y using canned tomatoes (drained) and chopped the onion, garlic and peppers in the food processor. They got a little juicy, but that's okay because they all got blended together eventually. My only problem was leftovers since their are only 2 of us. We ate the next night, but had to toss the rest.

I don't remember what kind of fish I used. I didn't bother with the marinating step, although I'm sure it would have been nicer had I done so. (every time I bit into a piece of fish I wished it was tastier). Made a half recipe, probably added extra garlic, and substituted red bell peppers for green. I used grape tomatoes and popped them with a spoon after it cooked for a little while. Added all the scallions and cilantro while it was cooking. I was hoping for a soupier end result, but I quite enjoyed the delicious flavor of this stew.

Easy week-night fare, esp if w frozen shrimp (though I used fresh). Cut to 2T oil, 1 w the lime juice, also used scant pound of fish (tilapia) and shrimp. Good with low-fat coconut milk but agree that full-fat might make REALLy delicious.

This is wonderfully simple quick way to prepare a fish dish. A very mild flavoured dish so it's important to use good ingredients. I used lite coconut milk and it turned out fine. Because there is not a lot of bold flavouring in this dish, I can see that using full fat coconut milk would probably have turned this dish from good to great.

Rating: 3
One piece of advice to make this stew truly Brazilian: stir in about 2T of palm oil towards the end of the cooking. This imparts a unique flavor and, more importantly, slight reddish tint. Made this recipe for a fancy dinner party and it was a big hit. Don't forget the palm oil!

Wanted a simple Lenten dinner and chose this. One of my friends can't have shellfish, so I doubled the fish. It came out a rich, hearty, delicious meal. Think it'll be great with the shrimp, and plan to find out when I make it again in a few weeks.

This was a wonderful dish - mild, but flavorful. Even my husband (who does not like fish) enjoyed it. I used Pacific Halibut instead of the suggested orange roughy, since it is a more 'environmentally sound' choice and 'lite' coconut milk to cut the fat content. I don't think the recipe suffered for it - it was fabulous!

This dish makes you look like a kitchen whiz. A salad, stew, strawberries w/ real basalmic viniger for desert and served w/ chilled resling or sauvigon blanc {also good w/ Pinot Noir}. Good food! 2nd addition:I've made this a number of times now and have settled on using fresh or frozen albacore tuna for 1/2 of the fish and cod for the rest. The tuna holds up well in the stew while the cod breaks up to get like over cooked fish but together it works well

I was so disappointed to get such a bland dish after the rave reviews that I'd read! I tried to "fix" it with red wine, tomato sauce, and pepper. Nothing could save this dish. What a shame, since the texture of the shrimp and the fish turned out so well. Don't waste your time with this recipe.

A very good and simple recipe. Multiply ingredients by four, do all of the chopping in advance, and have friends over. They will reward your brilliance by asking for the recipe for months afterwards. It may not be Brazilian, but all things Brazilian are cool and your friends will think you are too.

I made this for valentine's day I absolutely love it...and my fiance could not get enough of it. He downed everything and kept murmuring scrumptious.

I make this recipe all the time. It's one of my favorites and now a standard. I do change two things. I use canned tomatoes, but I puree them in the blender first.
