Delicious! I subbed criminis because that's what I had. Two smallish onions,sliced instead of minced and beef broth rather than plain water. The mushrooms/onions/garlic were seasoned as they were cooked, and the gravy was perfectly seasoned. I had some rosemary from my garden and used that instead of parsley.

Made a few alterations, in that I used dry Rose wine and added some chili flakes for a little touch of heat. Also, like other reviewers have suggested, I used chicken stock and flour instead of water and cornstarch. It turned out fabulously! It's nice that it is a recipe that you can experiment a bit with and still get a really great-tasting end product.

Very well received. Followed recipe closely except for one change suggested by others, viz., substituted home made chicken stock for water. (I think it would have been insipid with just water, but that's me.) Served it with pork schnitzel and mashed potatoes. Might have a 1/4 or 1/3 cup left. I felt it could have been a bit thicker, though no one else thought so.

This recipe produces a much too dark, rich sauce. I would NOT call it gravy.

I made this with ground beef an pork and it was terrific. I also used a glaze of 2TBS brown sugar, 1TBS brown mustard, 1/4 C ketshup, and 2tsp horseradish, and a dash of nutmeg during the last 15 minutes at 500 degrees.

I am a vegetarian on a very low-salt diet. I made this gravy tonight and loved it! I didn't even miss the salt. The only changes I made were to use Bragg's Amino Acids instead of soy sauce and dill instead of parsley. Delicious on mashed potatoes and nut loaf.

Husband loved this one! I also deleted the sugar and added some thyme, always good with mushrooms. I used flour to thicken instead of cornstarch. Great with meatloaf.

Rich, easy, Delicious! I didn't use any parsley. I also lightly flavored the water with some powdered chicken broth. You can almost always do this for sauces and soups that tell you to add water.

Recipe has good flavor. Would use chicken broth instead of water. I also added some dilweed and used cilantro instead of parsley. Next time i'm going to use flour and more broth.

I've been making this recipe for years. For steak, I chop the mushrooms fine and make it the original way. For vegetarian gravy for potatoes, I leave out the water and cornstarch, add some vegetable broth and add a dollop of sour cream at the end. If you make the sauce thicker, it makes a nice side dish, too. Everyone in my family loves this recipe.

This was the star of Christmas dinner (2008)at our home. It went well with the prime rib roast and was fantastic on the mashed potatoes. The blend of flavors reminded me of the first time I tasted French Onion soup. Wow! I will be making this again.

Prepared just as written on numerous occasions. This recipe is a miracle. 100% vegetarian and it goes beautifully with a wide variety of dishes. A keeper.

What a waste of mushrooms. This had a very strong, ungravy-like taste. Definitely leave out the sugar as it added an inappropriately sweet flavor. I'd leave out the balsamic vinegar as well as this comes through noticeably in the final gravy. If I made it again, I might try adding something like Kitchen Bouquet for a more appropriate beef-like flavor.

I made this yesterday for Thanksgiving and thought it was excellent. I used closer to 1/2 lb of shittake and oyster mushrooms, and it was more than enough. Also used one cup vegi broth, 1/2 c water and addded salt to taste. Will def make again!

Like another reviewer, I used beef broth (2 c. reduced to 1.5 for enhanced flavor) instead of water. I also used shallots in place of onions and omitted the sugar just because. My family adores this with grilled steak--or beef of any kind. to accompany chicken, I switch to chicken broth, white wine, and white balsamic vingar.

Rating: 1
I found the flavor of the wine to be way too strong. Also, the consistency was way too thick. Maybe because I used flour instead of cornstarch as some reviewers here recommended. But I was afraid that cornstarch would be too gelatinous.

Several family members are strict teetotalers so I had to omit the wine and balsamic vinegar. If you do, be sure to leave out the sugar or it will be very sweet. Maybe the wine helps balance the sugar. Agree with what others said about broth or mushroom soaking water instead of plain water. For vegetarians, Morga boullion cubes are an excellent way to boost the flavor. With these few tweaks, this is now my standard gravy whenever I cook for vegetarians, or just lack pan drippings.

Best gravy I've ever made. I did use beef broth instead of water (just disolve the corn starch in a little water first) and it was so tasty. Perfect for anyone who doesn't want to do a gravy from drippings.

I made this with the plan of using it on top of mashed potatoes...however, it didn't turn out looking like the gravy my family was expecting...however I did use it as the topping for the steaks we made and it was delicious...I added some of it to the gravy I did make for the potatoes and it tasted good in that too...not sure if I did something wrong or if my expectation for gravy was off, but followed the directions exactly.

I loved this recipe. If you doit right it does not taste bleh. i'll definitely make it again.

I gave this recipe only 2 forks, but do plan to make it again. Here's the deal: I should always listen to my cooking instincts. 1 1/2 cups of WATER? After cooking up all those yummy (& expensive) mushrooms & wine, the addition of water was 'bleh'. Thankfully, I had Better Than Bouillon on hand, so I stirred some of that in to boost the flavor. Next time, rather than water, I'll use good beef broth. And, my instincts.

Take it from a true meat and potatoes man that this gravy will not disappoint. This was my first attempt at a non-meat-based gravy and I found it rich and flavourful. That being said, it is somewhat more complicated and time-consuming than it need be. Suggest a quick sauté of the onion and garlic in butter with added pepper and dried herbs of your choosing. Add mushrooms and soy and cook over med-hi until the juices and soy are only half evaporated. Add wine and balsamic until they are half evaporated. Add bisto amount of your choosing (diluted first in cold water), and stir until desired consisitency. It's simple, quick, and excellent gravy.

This was great!! I followed the recommendations of others and used dried mushrooms for part of the called-for amount--and used the soaking broth instead of water. I also used this gravy with pan-seared pork tenderloin medallions, so first browned the pork and deglazed the pan with the wine--then pored it back off for the next steps, wiped out the pan and started where the recipe said. I added the pork back in as the gravy simmered/thickened. Very nice! I'll definately do this one again--easy enough for a weeknight, but nice enough for a dinner party--and it would be very convenient to make ahead!

Very tasty recipe, everyone loved and had seconds. Used common mushrooms that I had on hand and still work great!

Very nice, easy, but fancy, gravy for those of us who do not make a 'drippings' gravy. Great addition for turkey.

Very tasty gravy. I made half of it and still thought it quite a bit of work, so although I indicated I'd make it again, I think that's fairly doubtful. I don't understand why the recipe calls for water instead of beef, chicken or vegetable broth. I used low-sodium beef broth; also flour rather than cornstarch, adding the flour and browning it near the end of cooking the mushroom mixture. My mushrooms were all cremini. Fortunately I have some of the gravy left over as a topping for chicken breasts. The first half was for my meatloaf.

Rating: 4
Delicious! Used 3/4 white mushrooms, 1/4 cremini. Didn't see the onion listed until I started cooking, so added 2 tsp onion powder to replace. Used red cooking wine (I don't drink) and it was great. Had to be careful of the salt though. Overall, a great, great gravy!! Enjoy

A little bland as written...try replacing a few of the mushrooms with dried. Use the mushroom soaking water in place of the water for a nice mushroomy flavour. It also needs a good salting. The sauce is great over poached chicken breasts...a light healthy meal.

This last-minute recipe saved me after all the drippings from our first-of-the-fall pot roast burned up (after my husband's well-intentioned but unfortunate misunderstanding between low and medium flame). I was in a hurry and forgot the balsamic (and substituted basil for parsley) but did follow other reviewers' leads on adding milk (well, soy), popped in some buillon cubes since I didn't have broth in the pantry, and for the very first time (OK, I'm a novice) pureed part of the quite chunky sauce to add back for thickening (feeling a bit carb-conscious about flour since I've been having a bit too much fun eating recipes from this site). Used all exotics, too. Rich, savory, delish. (A J. Lohr cab made a nice red in the sauce.) This was a great eleventh-hour, whoops-there's-no-drippings-for-gravy safety net, and still good enough to use (on purpose) in the future. (Wish I could've put it as a three-and-a-half forker.)

I have made this many times since I found the recipe in the magazine. It is great over chicken veal even beef. Baby portobellas with white mushrooms have made a rich gravy.

As said below, to avoid blandness, use broth instead of water. You can even cut the quantity! (I'm just getting ready to make this again, and noticed a recent cook's comment...).

Used only cremini mushrooms. Great gravy for a roast and mashed potatoes. Easy.

Excellent flavor. I substituted re-hydrated dried wild mushrooms for fresh. I also substituted broth and the liquid from the mushrooms for water, and used flour and a little butter to thicken. This is a very handy recipe for those times you need to make a gravy, and don't have the benefit of pan drippings.

I was searching for a mushroom gravy to serve with meatloaf, and this one did the trick! Mind you, heedful of previous reviewers who felt it didn't stand up to beef, I made a BIG, BIG substitution: Instead of the cornstarch and water mixture, I used a tablespoon of butter and a tablespoon of flour (creamed) as the thickening agent and replaced the water with beef stock. Deep, rich flavor absolutely wowed the hubby and complemented my mashed taters perfectly. This is a great recipe for gravy when you don't have pan drippings to work with...

The thing I like about this recipe is that it's on the lighter side but with plenty of flavor. There are plenty of delicious recipes with richer ingredients, but I will use this one more often and save those for special meals.

I was expecting a smoother and thicker gravy, but it was still a favourite at my party. A bit darker and chunkier than I expected, but leftovers were delicious poured on hamburgers. The next time I make it, I will try pureeing half the gravy in a blender for a smoother consistency.

Not really what I was expecting. I was looking for a mushroom gravy to serve with meatloaf and mashed potatoes. This "sauce" would have been better with broiled chicken breasts. I didn't care much for the consistency the cornstarch gave it. It was like watery jello. Also, I made it a day ahead and when I heated it up it got a smokey flavor.
