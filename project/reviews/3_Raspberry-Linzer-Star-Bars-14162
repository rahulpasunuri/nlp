Nice flavor. Not too hard if using "almond flour" I purchased ground nuts so I would not have to spend the time and mess of grinding the almonds. (only thing - hard to figure out how much needed. I used 1 1/2 cups- could have used 1/4 more possibly) Used a large baking pan with higher sides. Nice presentation. I drizzled a very thin ribbon of milk chocolate over top.

These turned out very well; it's a shame that others haven't tried this recipe. It is a great recipe for picnics or for feeding a crowd. The bars are very cute with the stars on top and they transport well.

It turned out beautifully and was a big hit with the company. However, it took a very long time to make and was very messy. I'd say it was to much of a hassle that it wasn't even worth it. If you have a lot of time and like to clean, it did turn out great.

These bar cookies did taste good but tended to fall apart because the base was too crumbly. Very disappointing after all that work!

These bar cookies were delish!! I looked at a couple of other recipes and incorporated them into this one. ie - I didn't have lemon juice so I used orange juice; I melted some semi sweet choc chips and spread a very line layer of choc before spreading the raspberries; used 1 jar of regular jam & 1 jar of no-sugar (spreadable fruit) jam; skipped the milk & sugar part at the end. Very yummy!!!
