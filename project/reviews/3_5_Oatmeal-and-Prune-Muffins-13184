These were very good. I added some cloves and nutmeg, as others recommended, but the flavors were still pretty subtle. Maybe just upping the amounts of allspice and cinnamon would be better. I also used one whole egg instead of 2 whites, plus I didn't have quick oats so used regular oats. This muffin isn't too sweet, but very satisfying with some jam.

Second time making these muffins and modified the recipe a little: replaced the butter with 1/4 cup canola oil, increased baking soda to 1 tsp, and used orange flavored chopped prunes. The muffins were moist and light, and the orange was a nice flavor addition.

Added extra prunes for additional flavour. Exactly what I expected- sweet and chewy. Would definitely make them again.

Just two regular-size muffins and I was full! Exactly as described, soft texture, slightly chewy. Crunchy top because of the oatmeal. It turned out a bit too salty for me so I would reduce the salt next time. I substituted oat bran and 1 Tbsp flaxseed for the all-purpose flour, and replaced the butter with applesauce. I'm thinking of adding blueberries next time.

These were excellent! I made them with raisins and yogurt instead of prunes and buttermilk, since that's what I had, but I'll try them as written soon. Yum! I also had no quick-cooking oats, so I mixed the oats in with the wet ingredients to soften them a little. It worked out great.

Excellent texture and taste.

Excellent texture and taste, similar to what you would find in the bakeries in Europe.

These tasted too sweet and somewhat sour at the same time. There are way better muffin recipes out there.

Best ever muffins. I ran out of prunes and substituted a combo of dried dates and prunes. Very delicious and the molassas did the trick!

These were quite yummy warm with butter and jam, but I didn't find them very interesting once they were cold.
