While this method may not produce the texture of traditional Hollandaise, as other reviewers have noted, I think that for most people, the simplicity and speed of this recipe outweigh that fault. When a pure, traditional Hollandaise is required, that can always be done -- but this is a foolproof method that will do the job 90% of the time.

Brilliant! I learned this when I was a kid cooking brunches and it saved me every weekend. I used to hold the sauce in an air pot for hours!

this was very tasty and not too buttery it was great, i cut the recipe in half because i didn't want to make a huge batch but it was very good with my poached egg, canadian bacon, and english muffin :)

Fantastic, perfect Hollandaise every time. Can't ask for more than that!

for fun, we tried several different traditional methods before trying this one. The sabayon method turned out awful each time (probably our fault). but this turned out PERFECT. we did jack up the lemon juice a bit. it was a hit.

Maybe it was a matter of operator error, but this sauce never thickened for me. So I went back to the listed recipes and tried the blender hollandaise from 1962 (good year). It was a hit with my family. The difference is the addition of a tablespoon of cream, one T of lemon and 3 yolks. Also, you add hot butter. I used my food processor with the lide on the opening and did not get splattered.

Excellent - quick and easy - tasted great! No one could tell the difference versus the cooked version I usually make.

Quick, easy and turned out great the first time. I did use only 2 sticks of butter and it was a beautiful consistency! Keeping this one.

Great, very quick hollandaise which is what you want for a dinner party. Definitely a keeper.

My friend and I are at the beach and needed a quick, easy Hollandaise recipe. Found this and voila! Quick, easy, and delicious.

I halved this recipe, and used less butter than called for (about 3/4 stick). I knew most of it would be stuck in the bottom of my blender if I used it, so I opted for a handheld mixer with the whisk attachment. I still heated up the ceramic bowl with hot water. It turned out very well- perfect blend of rich and lemony- for our seafood eggs benedict.

I made this to serve with artichokes - it is really easy and very tasty. While pouring the butter into the blender, drops of the mixture did fly out of the opening in the top, but once the sauce really came together, it stopped. I added sea salt, ground pepper, and a little extra lemon juice which was great. It's very rich so you don't need much.

Excellent recipe. I had just returned from Germany and was missing the taste of hollandaise, potatoes and asparagus. I made only 1/2 of the recipe and it was perfect. Thank you, Eric!

So good and easy. I used Irish butter, which I think made it extra rich and delicious. I did need to add a bit of water to thin it out.

I'm not a huge fan of hollandaise sauce but since I wanted to do a traditional brunch for Easter, I tried this recipe out in advance to test it. It was a solid recipe that produced a typical hollandaise sauce quickly. I added additional salt and pepper to taste.

Thank you for this recipe. It worked great and I am so happy that I don't have to stand over a double boiler anymore whisking away. I didn't need to add more lemon juice but did add a little more salt when it was finished.
