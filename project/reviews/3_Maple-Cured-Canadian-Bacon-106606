I agree that it needs to brine longer than the recipe calls for. I brined mine for 48 hours, and it came out perfect.

I found that the Canadian Bacon wasn't salty enough. On the next go around, I will brine longer. Also it is important to not smoke at too high of temperature. Also, I will get a better piece of meat next time. Grocery store loin just doesn't cut it.
