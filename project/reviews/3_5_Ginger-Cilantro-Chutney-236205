It was ok, but I wouldn't make it again. I served it with grilled chicken breasts. Also, I would not call it a chutney, I would call it a vinagrette. It was quite watery and tart. I thought of some ways to change it up, but they all involve changing it beyond recognition.

great flavors! I only used one serrano to start since it was kind of large, which was good thing as that was one hot pepper, so never added the second one. Used this on the Asian Latkes and it was wonderful. I also use it as a garnish for fish or chicken and rice dishes. Very simple but really nice.

This is an easy, delicious, and potent-tasting chutney. I will use this for many dishes but it is great with the veggie patties.

I already made this recipe twice, one with steamed bass and the next one with sesamed steak tuna. In both occasions I added cristalized ginger to decorate and emphasize the ginger flavor.
