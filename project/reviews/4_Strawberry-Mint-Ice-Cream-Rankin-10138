I have been making this recipe for the last 14 years and everyone still loves it. There isn't anything to change in terms of the ingredients with the exception of the peppermint extract. You may want to add a 1/4 teaspoon more but taste before doing so. Great recipe for brunches, summer lunches and dinners.
