I have been making this cake off and on for about 10 years. It's deliciously full of summer flavors. When I started making it, I did not yet own an ice cream freezer. Since it's tough to find lemon ice cream, I bought Breyer's all natural Peach Ice Cream and covered the cake with it. The peach flavor truly complements the lemon and blueberry flavors! I've never found the cake to be dry as some have said.

Pluses: the blueberry filling was delicious Minuses: after freezing the cake, the filling and cake were rather hard, even with the 20 minute softening in the fridge, and the cake was dry (like ice cream cakes I have purchased in the past). I would like to make this cake again, but will use lemon frosting instead of ice cream and will serve it at room temperature to take advantage of the delicious blueberry filling.

Perfect for a summer BBQ. I made this the night before and it tasted best 2 days later after flavors had a chance to sit. I used only 1/2 the specified sugar and found the filling to be perfectly sweet. Even the kiddies liked this but the grown-ups really appreciated it.

This recipe is worth altering to make it perfect. When I first followed the recipe exactly, it was too "lemony" so I eliminated the lemon in the cake and let the ice cream carry the flavor (I also thought the lemon make the cake too soggy). Lemon ice cream in the summer is wonderfully refreshing and pairing it with the blueberry filling is ideal. A wonderful cake you can't buy anywhere!

I made this cake with some modifications. I used a high quality store bought vanilla ice cream which made the preparation easier and the cake was quite good. I have also substituted strawberry filling which was also very good.

I found the recipe very reasonable to prepare, and it was quite delicious for a birthday party on a hot summer day. Blueberry and lemon is always a classic flavor combination.

I was very disappointed with this recipe! It was a fair amount of trouble and really wasn't that good.
