where it states on number 5...Dont keep the kreplach in the boiling water for 20 minutes like it states...they turn into mush! its better to boil them until they float in 2 to 4 minutes, then pat dry, and fry in smalts(chicken fat) or in butter. then make a gravy with onions and serve with dolups of sour cream. This is how I like it done, yummy!! After Thanksgiving I like to make Turkey Kreplachs and serve with Turkey gravy....Yummy!!

This is a good basic recipe and quite close to my grandmothers, she seasoned the meat much more and her kreplach were never paper thin, like wontons. I used wonton wrappers once and yes it is very easy but you don't get Jewish kreplach out of it, you get won ton soup.

Nobody in my family ever made them thin. I tried, and discarded, wonton wrappers decades ago. In my family, both sides, kreplach were thick and hearty. The filling was typically finally ground leftover roast with either hard boiled egg, or raw egg binder. Onions, salt and pepper flavored the filling. Kreplach were served either boiled, or boiled and then pan fried. Often both were present at the same meal. The kreplach were usually served with chicken soup, along with kasha, and matzo balls.

To make these just like my grandmother did: 1)replace the corn oil with chicken fat and 2) instead of boiling them, fry them in chicken fat. Not exactly the healthiest dish, but they sure taste great.

Even my traditional Russian born grandmother embraced the store bought wonton wrappers. I think these were a bit bland. I would add a bit of parsley, and more salt and pepper next time.

In my family my Mom made the most delicious kreplach using seasoned, saute, finely chopped chicken livers. Unique and well worth the effort.

Used wonton wrappers instead of making dough and it turned out great. Filling needed a lot more seasoning though - more salt, pepper, and garlic!

you can also use chicken--boiled and chopped--in this recipe. It's a big production, but worth making.
