No other upside-down cake will ever measure up to this one as far as my family and friends are concerned. It's light and fluffy cake with the perfect amount of spice. In the summer we make it with yummy ontario peaches and whipped cream. And we always ALWAYS bake at least 3 because everyone wants seconds and thirds (and for breakfast anyone?). I love this cake.

My husbank said this was definitely a keeper. I have added it to my 3-ring binder of dessert recipes.

People love sweet food round my home, but after serving it up one night, this cake sat on a plate for four days without anyone touching it. Bland, boring, nothing special. No real flavors emerge.

Good ginger flavor, but the cake wasn't anything special. Based on earlier reviews, I increased the cake amount by 1/2 and added some fresh nutmeg.

Very light and delicious. Only modifications were to use orange juice instead of lemon juice, which produced a great flavor. There was not much batter and since the cake does not rise much, would recommend doubling the batter if making for more then 3 people.

I used cranberries instead of raisins, and a macoun apple (what I had on hand). Also, I baked it in a square brownie pan. Delicious! The cake part itself isn't particularly flavorful, but the crusty, bubbly, brown sugar topping is fantastic. I also appreciated that it wasn't an enormous cake - just enough for 2 people to have a couple pieces after dinner for a few nights. Reheats fairly well in the oven.

After all the great reviews, I found that the cake was too sweet. Baking time was too long; batter did not rise as much as expected. Did not like this recipe at all.

I expected the cake to rise a little more than it did, but it was extremely fluffy and moist. I had to make another one right away, my family liked it so much.

This was a fantastic little cake. I made it during book club meeting (short book) and served it warm with vanilla ice cream. My club RAVED over it. Everyone thought it was delicious. And it was small enough that I didn't have leftovers to tempt me. I did cream a little extra butter with the sugar before I added the eggs and that made the cake so moist. I'll definitely make this again and again.

I omitted the currants due to raisin aversion. My family did like it but did not demand a second helping

I got rave reviews from my guests on this recipe. My husband was still commenting on how delicious it was the next day! I call this recipe a 'keeper' because it was SOOOOO easy! I measured and sifted the dry ingredients and also prepared the pan before I served dinner. When dinner was over, I beat the eggs and put the cake in the oven. It does not really need much time to cool before cutting, so it worked out perfectly. You could easily make this using pears instead of the apples and cranberries instead of the raisins for a change of pace. The cake is a little small - if you are serving more than 6 people, make 2 cakes!

This is my idea of the perfect recipe : very quick, very easy, and extremely yummy! My only problem with it is that an 8" cake is not big enough.

This has been one of my old easy and crowd-pleasing standbys since it was first published in February, 1990. This is the reason I always keep crystallized ginger in the house. If anyone has made crystallized ginger at home, I would love to hear about it! louern@vif.com

This was an easy and delicious cake. Our guests loved it and asked for the recipe. It was great served with vanilla ice cream. I would definitely always serve it with ice cream or something similar because the cake itself is quite rich and needs the contrast.
