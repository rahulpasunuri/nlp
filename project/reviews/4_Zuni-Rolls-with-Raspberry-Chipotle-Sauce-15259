For raspberry chipotle sauce be sure to only use 1 chipotle pepper so that flavor doesn't totally dominate the sauce or fry your palate and make you cry. (If you love super spicy, then add more.) Made the rolls and topped with the sauce for a delicious meal. Used the extra sauce the following evening on roasted veggies and topped with goat cheese - delish!

I made the sauce to go with meatballs as an appetizer, but I cheated a bit. I blended a 32 oz jar of raspberry preserves with 2 chipotle peppers and added 1 cup of port. I mixed it all and poured it over a bag of 80 party sized meatballs in a crockpot on high for 5 hours so the sauce could really get into the meatballs. Huge hit!

Rasberry Sauce excellent over broiled salmon - and for appitizer - 1/3c on top of 8 oz cream cheese served with wheat thins. Substitued 1/4c grand mariner for port and reduced chipotle to 2 tbs minced in processer.

I wish the sauce were in a separate recipe, because that's what I made. I used it as a BBQ sauce for skin-on, bone-in fresh turkey breast halves. I grilled them for about 50 minutes over medium/low heat with the top down and brushed them with this sauce, which I also served on the side. It was awesome! Excellent with the turkey.

These are absolutely fantastic!!!! I've made them four times and we continue to enjoy them as much as we did the first time, they have become a real favorite. The sauce is so simple to make and is delicious. I do add two additional whole chipotle chiles for a little additional spice.

Simply the best wrap out there. Thanks to the chef for sharing the recipe! When my boyfriend brought this to work for lunch, his co-workers started asking how much they would have to pay to get their own. Three years and a new job later, those co-workers still talk about these wraps. Like most of the other reviewers, I add green apple. I don't always put port in the raspberry sauce, nor do I strain it. I store the sauce in a squeeze bottle with an extra wide tip, which makes it so easy to portion out. These are good both cold and warm. An absolute must-try and a keeper recipe for life.

I really wanted to love these, but they just didn't measure up. The raspberry sauce overpowered the turkey and Havarti, and even the bacon! The sauce tasted great by itself, but it was all we could taste, and was very disappointing. I won't make them again, although I MIGHT make the raspberry chipotle sauce for something else.

Oh, and you MUST saute/fry these. That makes them authentic (by my standards, at least). It gives the roll a semi-crispy texture. BTW, this is how you make quesadillas - saute a tortilla in a large skillet (I use butter) and then pile on your ingredients. Top with another tortilla. Turn over (a challenge, I know) and "toast" on the other side. Great and much better than a wimpy, limp thing. :-)

These are delicious and so quick to make! I used bottled raspberry chipotle sauce, which is plentiful these days. Hint on the tortillas: warm them up in the microwave just a few seconds to make them more pliable. That will make rolling them into burritos (essentially, that's what they are) much easier. I sauteed in butter in a large skillet. These would be great for a gourmet picnic, too. Excellent!!

Made these for the second time for a Christmas eve appetizer party. Cut them into 1 inch pieces for finger food and ease of dipping in left over sauce. Totally gone, even the teenagers liked them. One chipotle is not enough, I put in 3, and my husband thought 4 would have been better. I think next time I will use a pre-strained rasberry chipotle sauce or rasberry seedless jam and omit the sugar. I fry them in olive oil for about 2-3 minutes per side for appearance and the crunchy texture.

The raspberry chipotle sauce is excellent. I didn't make the sandwich but used it instead for a dipping sauce for spicy pork empanadas. It was wonderful!

Absolutely fabulous and very easy to make, using a pre-made chipotle sauce. Like many of the reviewers, I added some chopped Granny Smith apples to the filling, as well as some chopped cilantro. I also used turkey bacon, rather than regular (just more healthy). Also, I used Bronco Bob's Rasberry Chipotle sauce, which is not only delicious, but the seeds have been pre strained by the company, so you do not have to. I brushed the inside of the tortilla with this sauce and also had some for dipping after the rolls were finished. The next time I made these, I had run out of Bronco Bob's Rasberry- Chipotle sauce, but had some of their Mango-Chipotle sauce. This was just as good, if not better, than using the rasberry sauce and the company also has an apricot-chipotle sauce as well. I baked the rolls, rather than frying, until the cheese melted, about 10 minutes. You do not have to turn the rolls over. Just make sure you fasten the tortillas with toothpicks, before baking. All in all, this was a spicy, yummy dish that I will continue to make on a regular basis. It is relatively inexpensive, easy to make, unusual, pretty healthfull, and can be served as an appetiser or main dishe.

Just wonderful! Impressed my lunch guest and I will use it again and again. Used Monterey Jack cheese instead of the havarti and baked instead of frying the tortilla.

I loved this quick and easy recipe. We were out of Havarti so I used Provolone. Also, I used "The Original Roasted Raspberry Chipotle Sauce" by Fischer & Wieser, available from Costco in a 40 ounce jar. It has a great southwetern flavor and we use it for grilling chicken among other things. I will definately try these with grilled chicken as several reviewers suggested.

I made these taking the advice of several reviewers to 1) include apple slices; 2) bake in the oven instead of pan frying; and 3) use Monterey Jack instead of Havarti. They were delicious, and very easy and quick, esp. because of the baking instead of frying. I think they would have been much too meaty without the apple slices. My husband loved them, and normally he hates dinner food where he can perceive a sweet component.

Made the sauce to serve over grilled chicken. It was perfect. The chipotles can be increased if you want something spicier, but the smokiness came through as given.

Mmmm....yummy yum! Like other reviewers, I didn't strain the sauce, and I used my stick blender instead of fussing with pouring hot liquids. I simmered the sauce with fried tofu, and added some buerre manie at the end to thicken it a bit. It was a definite "make again" from my boyfriend.

These were fun and different. The sauce was extraordinary and I was able to freeze just enough for another meal. I left out the scallions and substituted Monterey Jack cheese with some dabs of cream cheese. I also ended it with a quick bake in the oven. Next time I think I'll skip the frying. Defintely worth trying!

I intend to make these soon, just wanted to mention that there is a wonderful Chipotle Raspberry sauce on the market, made by Bronco Bob's,which is great poured over cream cheese and served with rice crackers...I was searching for a recipe to use this sauce with..and I could'nt be happier with this one(go to Bronco Bobs.com)

The sauce was really interesting, and we all liked that. Both kids said it needed something "green" aside from the scallions, but younger one finally gave up after a few bites and said he just didn't like it. Older one finished everything because he had just gotten home from track and was starving, but then again, he'll eat almost anything with a gallon of milk. But the sauce was really good!

Oh, God, did we love this! Made for a Sunday Brunch - used 2 of the chipotles (thank heavens I saw the post on using the whole can)- so, used a little caution. I like the suggestion from "Tina" to make ahead of time, will do that sometime when we have overnight guests. I'm req'd to keep a log book for school, so took prep pix and my husband liked this dish so well, he took a pix to work to "show & tell"

We loved this, and since there was extra sauce I used it on flank steak the next night and WOW was it good! Will make again for certain. As for the "ZUNI" I think that is the name of the place where the recipe came from...not that its supposed to be a native american recipe...just a thought...

This recipe is amazing. The first time I made it I actually hid it from my husband because I was so sure he would be turned off by the raspberries. It turned out to be the hit of the evening with everyone! I just made it again for our New Years Eve hors d'oeuvre's, only this time I had to triple the recipe because of complaints of not enough before! I did process the entire can of chipotle peppers, but added only what I thought our guests would enjoy. I left a dish of the strained peppers out with the raspberry sauce for those who "love" the extra heat. One friend bypassed the raspberry sauce and dipped straight into the chipotles. This recipe will now go on to our family reunion this summer where it will undergo the ultimate test!

This was fast and full of flavor. We added a couple of more chiles for the fire lovers in our house and it was just as good. I also made them ahead and rolled in plastic wrap in the fridge till we walked in the door and made them for a fast lunch. We love the combination of flavors!

This recipe sounds delicious... but, there's really nothing "Zuni" about it!

I can't believe a Yankee restaurant could make such a tasty Southwestern dish-- everyone loved it. I used dry red wine and only 1/2 tsp. sugar in sauce (plus an extra chipotle.) These also make great roll-ups without the tortilla for a low-carb snack.

I served these as finger food at a party and the plate was clean in minutes. Friends mentioned days later how good they were! The sweet-smoky combination is great. I used white port (it was what I had at hand) but the sauce was still delicious.

The first time my wife made this, she got dyslexic and thought that she should use "1 drained whole can of chiptle chilies" instead of "1 drained canned whole chipotle chile". This dish was still delicious, but smokin' beyond belief! The raspberry and chipotle are a natural. Better stick with the 1 chile! We like keeping with the havarti but did add a nice alder smoked bacon. Serious flavor here!

The combination of the sweet raspberries with the spicy chipotle chiles is any excellent choice to dip the egg-roll type appetizer in. I will definitely make it again.]

This was quite good. Quick and easy also. Used some muscat instead of ruby port, seemed to be just fine. I used fresh raspberries, can't imagine smuckers jam on anything.

Makes a great weekend lunch. In a pinch, there are good bottled spicy raspberry sauces on the market, Prairie Thyme, for one.

Enjoyed them emensely. The only substitution that I made was to use tawny port instead of the ruby port. I used turkey breast that I had applied a dry rub to before smoking in my stovetop smoker. After making the sauce I left it "as is" and didn't puree or strain. Thought it could have used a little more chipotle chile. Served with a side salad of baby greens and a balsamic raspberry vinigrette.

These wraps are a nice change from plain, old sandwiches. Loved the raspberry sauce. Used shredded Jack cheese instead of Havarti. Served with Smoked Chicken Chowder recipe (except kept it meatless).

I took the first cooks advice and used the Smuckers preserves. It turned out wonderful. I will be making big batches of this sauce and keeping it on hand.

Well, I make this all the time for guests for breakfast and they always lick their plates! I've altered the sauce a bit. I use Smuckers low sugar raspberry preserves and chipotles with a dash of oj and it's just as good and a bit more simple.

It's more like empty flautas. try adding chicken in the tortillas, and some more of the sauce. But I LOVE the raspberry-chipotle flavor.

Since when is New Mexico on the West Coast?

Rating: 3
To the New Mexican cook who says "there's nothing Zuni about this..." You may be right. BUT the recipe does, in fact, duplicate exactly a sandwich by the same name created by Norma Gillespie, chef at the Cottonwood Cafe in Boston. So, while you WestCoast purists may frown, it was EXACTLY what I was expecting by the title!

Very good recipe...quick and easy. I have made it a number of times and served to rave reviews. Recently I found a bottled Raspberry Chipotle Sauce which I like equally well and saves a few more minutes. I have made up the rolls to take along on picnics. Merely turn a few times on hot grill with great results.

Very good, and not difficult. I also add an extra chipotle to the sauce for a bit more kick. We make this frequently!

This recipe is great. To make it easier to roll and manage, I chopped all filling ingredients to make almost a salad with the raspberry sauce as a "dressing". I also added chopped apple and pine nuts. I think next time I make it, I'll use Jack cheese instead. The Havarti is really just a mild (and really expensive) cheese whose taste gets lost with all the other strong flavors.

Very tasty! You could cut these in bite sized pieces and serve with the sauce for appetizers. I served this with (boxed) black beans & rice for an easy dinner.

The chipotle/raspberry sauce is awsome. I place my tortillas on a sheet pan and heated them in the oven until the cheese melted - worked fine and seemed easier than toasting in a saute pan. I was making 15 of them. Sauce would go very well with grilled chicken.

Very good. I have made this several times. I use most any good cheese that I have on hand. I also add cilantro to the ingredients inside the roll. Alternating slices of avocado and mango on top of the roll (after sauce has been applied) adds color and flavor. I serve with black beans.
