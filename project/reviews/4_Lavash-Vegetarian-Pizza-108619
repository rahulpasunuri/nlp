This was absolutely delicious. I made the crust myself in the bread machine and used red peppers instead of green as I find them tastier. I also used a pizza sauce on the dough because I thought it would be too dry otherwise. Everyone that has tried it loved it and I will definitely be making it again.

Absolutely delicious!!! I used a tomato base that I had prepared for another recipe (sauteed mixture of onions, red peppers and canned tomatoes with paprika) along with a few chopped fresh tomatoes. The result was outstanding.

yummy. very tasty! i sauted my peppers, onions and mushrooms until soft. i also rubbed the lavash with the cut side of a clove of garlic. i added some turkey pepperoni and some sauted chicken sausage. i think it very important to heat up any veggies and meat as it's not in the oven long enough for them get hot. the lavash gets crispy very fast so stay close!!

This my cooking friends, is awesome. However, I would recommend one lovely and key touch in my opinion. After it comes out of the oven, drizzle with some balsamic vinegar (be sure to use the good stuff--not the bitter stuff) and olive oil. It was an awesome addition.

This recipe was GREAT for a quick, meatless, mid-week meal. Even my husband, the supreme carnivore, loved it. Definite keeper.

You really have to watch the lavash if you're making it fresh. I nearly burned mine, but once you load the veggies on it doesn't even matter because it tastes so good. It tastes healthy if you know how that tastes. It really is a lot of vegetables for the amount of lavash req'd. We had to make a few more lavash breads to use the rest of the vegetables. You can hardly taste the feta so, I probably won't bother with that next time. And after you leave this in the refrigerator for a day it seems to taste even better...the flavors get a chance to meld together in the refrigerator. Most definitely will make this again but maybe with a store bought lavash.

I make lavash pizza with little scoops of rather dry hummus under the cheese - fantastic. Got the idea from M's Pub in Omaha, NE.

Very versatile pizza. I used 3 whole wheat "Flatouts". They are like a soft flatbread thicker than a tortilla but thinner than a pita. I used more mushroom and sauteed them as well as sauteing the bell pepper and red onion. I thought they would be too crunchy otherwise. We are bad - the first layer was slices of pepperoni. Great flavor.

This is a very good recipe with great flavors. It is especially nice for guests who don't eat meat or are on a low fat diet since they can customize the pizzas to their liking. I have also made using whole wheat tortillas, with good success.

The basic directions were great! I laid out all sorts of ingredients/veggies/cheeses (anything I could find in the fridge), and everyone made their own pizza. Great gathering/social food!

This was very easy and delicious! I used roasted red peppers, feta cheese, kalamata olives, basil and cherry tomatoes. Watch the lavosh in the oven so that you don't scorch it.
