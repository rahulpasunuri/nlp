These are addictive! Next time though, I would cut the salt (maybe it was my cheese but I found these way too salty) and up the pepper and cayenne. I rolled the dough into logs, chilled them and then sliced them and baked them right away. Baking time was a bit longer but there were no problems with rolling and cutting the dough.

We can't stop eating these cookies! The Cayenne is my favorite part, although I am not much into spice. We made the mistake of chilling the recipe too long, so we found it hard to work with the dough. Also we weren't sure we used the right cheese. Regardless, we've decided to make this recipe a traditional staple in our family.

I loved them, the boyfriend doesn't like them. I would call this cookie more of a savoury snack. It is not sweet and I think it would go very well on a cheese tray or with pre dinner appetizers. I used an 8 year old cheddar. They are a little bit runny when baked, but were able to hold the shape in a circle. It took almost all of my cheese which cost 10 dollars. I think it is a pricey cookie but I will make it for special occasions because I love it. Kirsten

I made these for a potluck and they were gone in a flash. Everyone loved them. I would increase the Cayenne Pepper just a bit for a little more heat, but other than that - perfection.

This recipe is one of my favorites. An excellent shortbread. The key is using extra old cheddar cheese. The older the better. 7 - 9 years old.

Nearly didn't make this because whoever wrote it clearly dosn't know that Wensleydale cheese is utterly different from a cheddar and a truckle is a shape - which makes no difference whatsoever. However, the actual biscuit (or cookie in American) was really nice. Do NOT use Wensleydale - it is a soft crumbly white cheese and will not work. Scottish cheddar is hard to find in USA but English works.

These were tasty but a little too buttery (is this possible? yes, I guess so). This could have been because my cheese was not as "dry" as I had hoped it would be. I will definitely try these again with a proper dry English cheddar.

I made these to go with some White Chicken Chili I took to a soup and salad lunch at my church. It was a big hit, so much so that I only got to eat one and had none to bring back home! It was easy, even the rolling and cutting out part, which I usually avoid. The dough was workable right after mixing but I did chill it per the directions, and it was a breeze to roll and cut out. I used a round cutter with a scalloped edge, so the shortbread was beautiful as well as delicious.

Very good and easy! Just baked my first batch and going to bake another. Cheers

without a doubt, one of the best things to ever come out of my kitchen. delicious, easy, and totally addictive. baked them for my husband, but i have already eaten 3, under the guise of "testing". a nice change from all of the sweets given as gifts during the holidays... i followed the advice of previous reviewers and skipped the rolling/cutting process. rolled the dough into small balls with my hands and flattened between my palms- baked about 14 mins. also- i used the wensleydale cheddar suggested in the recipe- not cheap, but totally worth it, i think.

These are delicious. I served them to my bookgroup and they disappeared. I agree with the foregoing reviews that they can be much easier than as written. Instead of rolling them out and messing with sheets of paper, let the dough rest in the refrigerator for half an hour. Then use a small melon baller to make even-sized balls. I used one a bit more than an inch in diameter. plunk them on sheet pans with parchment, use a fork to flatten them slightly, and bake until they begin to brown. I baked them 15-16 minutes, and next time might give them another minute or two. How long you bake them will depend on how flat you make them. Yielded about 40 biscuits.

Hello to Alcasper from Toronto. I have had the same problems with cookies as you - I think it is b/c of all the fat from the cheese plus the butter. Try putting the dough in the fridge for an hour, the rolling or shaping. Works for me. Your pal, trout

amazing. I used the ball- rolling technique mentioned in an earlier review, and it worked perfectly, and was much simpler than the roll out, cut out, etc. I paired these with a black bean soup also listed on epicurious, and the combination was perfect. i even splurged on some $12 cheddar from whole foods. So worth it!

Delicious, but came out more like a cheese tuile or frico than a shortbread texture.

So good! After trying the rolling out, etc, I came up with this method- which worked great and was much quicker and less messy.I made little balls and then put them on an ungreased cookie sheet (no parchment needed)-I smooshed them down a bit with a fork. I ended up with cute, regular-sized(maybe 1 inch across) cheddar "buttons". I kept them in the oven til they were a tiny bit brown. there're lovely, cruncy, bite- sized with no crumble issues!I also added more cayenne. Perfect, really!

Delicious, I've made them twice now to rave reviews. Although I do have a problem with the cookies not 'rising' like my mom's shortbread - they usually end up shlumping all over the baking sheet. I didn't follow the recipe for cheese amount, though I know that I put in more than the recipe calls for. Can anyone help me; am I over-cheese- ing?

Delicious! I brushed the tops with egg white and water, and sprinkled them with just a bit of cayenne and kosher salt. Yummy and pretty!

Lovely biscuits. I made a second version - my healthy alternative - replacing butter with olive oil and whole wheat unbleached instead of regular flour. Rolled the pastry into a sausage shape and cut the biscuits after 45 min refrigiration. Better for the waist as well as my conscious.

Light and Crispy. Served at a party and everyone raved.
