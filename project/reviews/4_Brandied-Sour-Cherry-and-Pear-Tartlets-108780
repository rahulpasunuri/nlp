I am the cook in the household but by no means the baker, which is a shame because my family is french and creole. I wanted to try my hand at a fairly easy dessert to impress my mom and my boyfriend's family. I took this recipe for a test drive last night. Changes to this recipe: I opted for a half mix of whiskey & armaretto (almond liquer). I also did a mix of dried cherries and cranberries since both families are somewhat picky. I followed the advice below and actually added an extra pear and a half and added an extra 1/4 cup of water since to accomodate plumping of both dried berries. I boiled a littler longer to thicken the mix. I did two batches one with the pastry dough recipe, and the other I thawed out premade pie crusts. I added sliced almonds at the bottom of every tart to go with the armaretto. I opted for the deep dish tartlet 3 1/2 inch pans since my boyfriend's family is men with hollow legs. Both turned out great! Very decorative and the a great assortment of flavor to tantalize the tastebuds! The premade pie crusts is a great alternative to make this a more time efficient recipe!

This is an incredibly comforting dessert. I couldn't find sour cherries so I used currants instead and it was wonderful. The crust strikes me as more of a pie dough and not as sweet as tart doughs usually are. I took it to a party and got rave reviews from all.

We made this for Thanksgiving this year. It worked beautifully and was truly delicious. I like that it's not too sweet ans the filling was never gelatinous. We made the single pie and with all the cutouts and added pastry decorations, it was really pretty and festive too.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was a great hit, however I made a couple additions/substitutions based on the other bakers who posted a response. I added an additional pear (but I might have needed another), they didn't have pure dried sour cherries at Whole Foods so I got the Tart Dried Cherries infused with apple juice, I added a tablespoon of almond extract, and since I didn't have any brandy I used Madeira. I also didn't have any shortening, so I replaced it with butter, but it wasn't noticeable. I also didn't have the tartlet pans, so I made one pie. Next time I make this I will try it with the brandy and add another pear.

I just made this tart (a single 10" one) for the third time, and I am as pleased with it as ever. It's beautiful, tasty, and not at all difficult to make. I recommend using four pears instead of three, and preparing the filling a day in advance to give the flavors time to meld and the cherries more of an opportunity to plump. In the most recent version, for a lark, I placed some strips of almond paste on the bottom, under the filling; the flavor was a bit too concentrated, but I think some other form of almond substance would be very nice in this tart. An all-butter pastry would also make it more delicious.

This recipe is very good. I never have shortening so I used butter instead. I think the flavor was improved, although maybe it was not the same.

This was a real hit at a party I gave. Everyone loved the individual pies. The crust came out perfect, and the taste of the filling was amazing. I added a teaspoon of almond extract, and I found it to offset the taste of the cherries and pears quite nicely.

This recipe is fabulous. Not only does it taste great but the presentation is outstanding. I didn't have the right size tartlet pans so I used muffin tins instead. It wasn't as pretty but still worked just fine.
