I tried this because I thought it would be a refreshing combo with Jerk Chicken. It was but I thought it was a little too syrupy-sweet.

I made this soup as directed, and felt it was missing something, so I added a handful or so of fresh basil and pureed it in the blender again, and it was perfect! The basil added a savory taste that complimented the sweetness of the fruit perfectly.

I've had cantaloupe soup before and hoped this to be as good if not better. The first few spoonfuls were pleasant, but I was disappointed in the bitter aftertaste from there. My guests and I were quick to push the dish aside and chalk it up as a loss. I blame the mint--though it seemed a good idea at the time.

Good summer soup. I was about out of mint so I added basil and ginger to my syrup. I also added apple juice and a little extra sugar to make a thicker syrup. The sugar syrup was so flavorful I saved a little and made wine cooler cocktails whipped up in the blender with ice. Servied in martini glasses with a touch of Remy Red Liqueur floated in the middle. Served the soup with a Cobb salad. Very good meal!

I didn't have the wine so I just used water. I used artificial sweetener because by husband is diabetic. The results were very good.

I made slight changes in the amounts and I used Muscato D'Asti in place of the white wine. I received rave reviews. The cantaloupe I used the first time was just ripe, the second time the cantaloupe was very ripe. The first attempt was quite good, the second was not as flavorful, slightly watery.

Wonderful. Great success. Can't wait to make it again. The melon has to be ripe and flavourful (take note, Meriden, Conn.) and a tiny bit more Gewürtztraminer is not de trop.

Not very tasty- would not make it again.

This is a very refreshing summer opening to a meal.
