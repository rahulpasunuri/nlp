These were the best chicken tacos! Super easy to make and just enough to satisfy two people. I used Trader Joe's ready made grilled chicken and I also used soft corn tortillas. Delicious!

I substituted chicken for Angus ground beef, but otherwise followed the recipe as is.(except I used 2 cloves of garlic because I love garlic) IT WAS WONDERFUL!!!! Best TACOS EVER!!! I had a glass of red wine with...it was that good. I would order these at a 4 star restaurant. :-)
