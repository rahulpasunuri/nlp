This was a lovely and simple dish for a quick weeknight meal. It's also a fantastic vegetarian dish. We used red pepper flakes instead of the jalepeno since we didn't have one. We also addes more garlic and ginger like others suggested. In addition, we used chicken stock to cook the lentils. We didn't have any zucchini so we used spinach and carrots. It's delicious! I am so pleased.

My kids ask for this at least once a month. Its an excellent base for your adaption. I usually omit the zucchini and add cubed sweet potatoes and kale or spinach, and serve over steamed cauliflower, top with some flaked coconut with a whole wheat naan on the side.

This stuff is awesome. Made it last night with some modifications(used coconut oil, veggie stock, full fat coconut milk plus @ a cup of silk coconut milk, red curry paste, roasted curried caulifower and left-over turkey). So good that I will no longer need to go out for my curry fix, truely as good as the curry at my favorite Thai resturant. Might even have to have some for breakfast!

Delicious and easy. I didn't double the spices as others suggested but I only had one small yellow squash so I added a handful of chopped green beans. Served over mixed greens (bagged from trader joes).

This is delicious! I too made some minor changes to help the recipe pop! Extra ginger & garlic plus some stock! I look forward to making this again and again. Yup it rocks!

Love this one! Its super easy and I always have these things on hand. I up the ginger (I LOVE ginger) and I also add whatever veggies I need to use in the fridge. Tonight it was red & green pepper + some broccoli. I too use lite coconut milk & supplement with my almond/coconut blend milk. I like to lighten the fat content. Make this once a week! Thanks for the inspiration.

This is delicious and uber easy. Like others, I upped the spices - a must. I used full fat coconut milk and it made for a richer, silkier dish than subbing light. I'd stick with the full fat. Medium chain fatty acids in coconut are good for you.

This is a good basic recipe... pretty much a daal, and goes well with other Indian themed dishes. I adjusted like others by using lite-coconut milk, adding much more ginger and garlic - one more clove and at least double the ginger. I also added a little pepper and paprika and substituted one of the cups of water with chicken broth after reading comments that the recipe lacked a little flaver. I also, browned the zucchini to give it some carmel flavor ahead of putting it in the curry. The recipe required more water half way through cooking and the recipe also under estimates the time to cook the lentils... Add at least 10 minutes. Overall, I think it came out great.

So awesome! I did add about 50% more garlic and ginger than what the recipe stated - also no zucchini and subbed light coconut milk. It was easy to make after a long day at work and was kinda addictive!

I defintely would not use coconut extract. that is for baking! I think if you want more coconut flavor, use some un-sweetened organic coconut. Just my opinion, of course.

I read reviews and doubled all spices including garlic to start. Used 2 1/2 cups of lentils versus 1 1/2 to make it thicker. Did not have pepper so I used some cayenne for heat. After this it was good. To make it EXCELLENT we used 1 teaspoon coconut extract (I wanted more coconut taste) and some sugar to taste and it was PERFECT! I'm going to add some chicken and pour over brown rice. YUM!

Whipped this up after a long work day and not only was it delicious and quick, it makes plenty of leftovers for lunch tomorrow. We served it on spinach and the only change was to double the spices. Will also increase the amount of ginger next time.

this was a fantastic dish *when adjusted.* double the spices, definitely. i also added the juice of a lemon at the end, which gave it a good kick, and added a big handful of cilantro (not just the sprigs) at the end. i could see using greens, like bok choy, instead of cucumbers. a great dish for vegetarians and vegans (and anyone, really!)

My boyfriend and I enjoyed this curry for dinner and will definitely make it again! I would give it 4 forks, but we made a few substitutions. (1) We used curry powder instead of the cumin, coriander and tumeric. (2) We added more ginger and cilantro. (3) Instead of zucchini, we added a diced red bell pepper and a diced white sweet potato at the same time as the lentils. Delicious!

This recipe was super easy and tasty although it could have used some more spice. I added more jalepeno than called for and switched the zucchini for Swiss chard.

This dish was very easy to prepare and was quite delicious. I would have to agree that it was a little bland though and I added 1 tsp of curry powder. I see others doubled the spices and I might try that next time. Also a must, is to sprinkle some coconut and raisins on top along with the cilantro. I used some coriander chutney for extra heat on mine because the rest of the family can't handle too much jalapeno. Served with a pita instead of rice. I will definately make this again.

Rating: 3
Nice flavor, although I couldn't really taste the coconut too much. I ended up using dal yellow peas since I didn't have lentils, not sure how much that changed the flavor. Made with chicken tikka, mango and red pepper chutney, and indian pototoes (all from this site) and this one got kind of lost in the mix, since the other recipes were so delicious.

Rating: 3
Great base, but needs more spice. I will double them next time. Maybe more chile as well.

This certainly adapts to kitchen realities! So I had French Lentils, added 2 cups extra water, and cooked 45 min total. Added potato 20 min in, added zucchini in during last 5 - 10 minutes. I'm going for 2 peppers next time, and even though I doubled spices, I'll take it up another notch next time. Lovely with Naan.

Rating: 3
All I had on hand to add in terms of veggies were peas and carrots. The carrots I recommend, the peas didn't do much for it. I doubled all the spices, and might triple them next time; the end result was nicely flavoured but not strong enough for my tastes. It was a nice meal with basmati and naan either way. Some pickled lemon would've been great.

I agree with prior reviewers that you MUST double the ginger, garlic, cumin, coriander and turmeric.

Used one zucchini and a small sweet potato based on other reviews--really appreciate everyone's comments. Served it to myself with sliced banana, teaspoon of shredded coconut, some raisins, almonds and more fresh ginger. Didn't bother with the rice.

my family and I are just recently adopting a plant based/ whole foods diet. Even my picky eater gobbled this down. It was awesome! I made just as directed, only I didn't include the seeds from the jalapeño. It turned out great--not too spicy for my kids, and just the right amount of kick for me. It also came together really quick which I greatly appreciate.

Rating: 3
This is tasty but a few things I would do differently next time. It was a little too spicy for me. I haven't used a whole jalapeno in a long time so I thought I'd give it a try, but really it's too much. I would remove most of the seeds next time. Also, I added potatoes based on the reviews, and I cut them into chunks that were a little too big to cook at the same time as the rest of it, so I would recommend cutting them into a fairly small dice.

Rating: 3
Loved it! Instead of the turmeric, cumin, and coriander, I used an equivalent amount of my favorite curry powder. I also added potatoes and carrots instead of zucchini. In general, a great, quick recipe and easy to modify based on your preferences or what you have on hand. Would definitely make it again.

Rating: 4
Not sure why others found this dull---I thought it was delicious! My spices were fairly fresh (ground spices do lose their zing after months in the pantry...). I added just a dash of curry powder after reading the many comments that found this dish under-seasoned, but I'm not sure it even needed it. I also substituted light coconut milk to save on fat and calories and I didn't miss the regular at all. I did use a fresh chile, including seeds, and would not recommend skipping it unless you're dealing with young palates. I can see how it might be lackluster without the hint of spice the chile gives it. Served with brown basmati rice and some frozen naan, this was an excellent homemade Indian meal, miles better than many takeout joints. Next time I might add a bit of cubed paneer for texture and protein, but all in all, a new standby!

Don't use 'light' coconut milk. I made mine with light and it really lacks creaminess and depth, the flavors are pretty thin. I didn't try a potato, but I definitely will next time.

Based on prior reviews, I added one diced zucchini and one small diced potato -- in order to see which went better with this recipe. My vote: stick with the zucchini. Although the potato tasted fine, IMO the zucchini is a better balance/contrast in this thick dish of lentils.

Really tasty and very easy! Only thing I think I'll do next time is add more peppers - it could use a bit more heat. Makes a big amount!

This is a fantastic recipe! I thought the seasoning was just fine. couple of things I did differently: used the whole 16oz pkg of regular lentils cause I didn't want to end up with extra lentils and regular was what I had on hand. I cooked them about 5 minutes longer than the red (I added 5 minutes to the simmering time before adding the zuchini). I increased the water to about 2 1/2 cups. I don't do jalapenos (fresh ones, that is) so I used canned diced and I added 2tsp. So, not enough heat. Next time, I might add 4 tsp's cause you know I am makin' this again. It's great!!

So Good and so easy! I doubled the pepper and ginger because I like it spicy. I will make this dish again soon!

Very good lentil curry. I changed slightly using brown lentils instead of red which required extending the cooking time by about 10 minutes. I also only used 3/4 cup coconut milk, substituting the remaining with water to cut down on the fat. I would recommend doubling the zucchini to 2 lbs.

Rating: 3
I used this as a general guide and loved the doctored final result. I substituted coconut water for the coconut milk to eliminate fat and save calories. I omitted the chiles because we all eat the same meals but the kids don't like spice. Instead, we stir in coriander chutney from the Indian market--spicy, because it has chiles in it--at the table. I serve this with pappadums for me and naan for the rest of the family. Yum.

Double or triple the spices per your taste buds. Very easy and satisfying.

Rating: 3
Taking the advice of the other reviewers, I doubled the onion, garlic, ginger, and spices. I also cooked this the way I usually cook lentils: after adding the spices and toasting them, I removed them from the pan and proceeded with the recipe as written. I added them back about 10 minutes later. I think that retains some of the freshness of the flavors. I finished the dish off heat with about 2T extra coconut milk and the juice of half a lime. With these modifications, the dish was really, really tasty.

Rating: 4
Doubled the spices - except for the chiles, replaced water with homemade turkey stock, and added in diced sweet potatoes (boiled for about 15 minutes before I added then to the curry). Result was out of this world delicious! Easy enough to add chicken, too, on a non-vegetarian night.

Rating: 3
We enjoyed the recipe; however, I did increase the spices by 25% and used vegetable broth in place of the water as many of the reviewers suggested. I used a diced potato because I didn't have any zucchini on hand and I think I would prefer it with the potato. Overall, it is a good and easy recipe. It was served over brown rice.

Rating: 4
This was so so very good, I wanted to use red lentils in a way that is easy and good for the kids and the whole family ate it. It does need more salt at the table though. I did the potato substitution for the zucchini and left out the chile like a reviewer described (thank you!). Will definitely make this regularly, I love recipes where you don't need a special vegetable around to make it work.

I am always annoyed by these reviews because people will say a recipe is great...once they implemented changes to suit their own tastes. Yet, I am about to do the exact same thing. Suffice to say the FUNDAMENTAL recipe is good. I dislike zucchini, so I added one large diced Idaho potato in its stead, which worked great. I also added slightly more spice, did not add chiles (my 4 year old eats what we do, but can't deal with too much heat), and served it with brown rice and sauteed chicken breasts on the side. It was delish, and can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow which, according to these reviews, will probably be even better.

Rating: 3
I definitely agree with some of the other reviewers that doubling the spices makes for a far better dish. I also added in 2 potatoes & green peas into the dish for a heartier meal. Leftovers the next day were also much tastier than when initially cooked - I think the flavors need time to come together.

Rating: 2
I agree with earlier reviewers who thought this dish was better the second day! I followed the recipe exactly except that I used light coconut milk. Next time I would consider using the full-fat variety for a little more richness. It was nicely spiced as-is. My only other thought is that it lacked a little complexity - I found that I wanted some sweetness in there along with the heat. Adding winter squash might help, as well as perhaps some currants or raisins as a garnish. This is a versatile recipe - I think you could really add anything you want to it.

After realizing there was no good Indian food to be had in our area, I decided to do a little experimenting. This recipe turned out well, with some notable adjustments: I doubled the cumin, added some Garam Masala powder, and chopped up the cilantro and added that to the stew before simmering. I also made a little raita on the side to sooth the bite of the chili's. Overall, a success!

this was nice -- not too difficult, and easy to alter to suit your tastes and your supermarket's availability. i used pumpkin in place of zucchini, and am sure any firm veg would do well (adjusting time of addition, of course). like some of the previous reviewers, i ended up doubling the cumin, tumeric, and coriander and used veggie broth in place of half the water -- it turned out nice and spicy! this recipe is good, and while it won't knock your socks off as-is, it's a great base recipe to start playing with -- i'll definitely keep this one around.

I love to cook and this is a good basic recipe however needs lots of doctoring!

This is delicious! When I set out to make it I realized the grocery store neglected to put my jalapeno in the bag, so I substituted cayenne pepper. I also used a bit more spice than the recipe called for. Purposefully I substituted a winter squash for the zuchinni (I used delicata) because I was craving the taste of winter squash with coconut milk for some reason... It was excellent! So easy to make!

My husband liked this recipe, but I did not. I did increase the spices and added some extra curry powder but we both agreed that it would be better with cauliflower, potatoes, and peas (but then its perhaps a different dish altogether.) The one saving grace was that I cooked the rice in chicken stock. If I ever make it again I would cook both the rice and the curry in vegetable or chicken stock to give it some more flavor.
