I love this recipe made exactly as outlined. My teenage daughter and her friends gobble it up with carrots and celery. And, any left overs are nice on a baked potato

A big hit for my son and I, and I reccomend using whipped crem chese, not the block type. But if This ever appeared in front of my husband, he'd call it grounds for a divorce!

This was alright, perhaps a bit stiff for dipping. I agree it doesn't keep well, with the broccoli being such a strong flavour, it takes over given time.

This was very tasty. I used extra sharp cheddar and it was a little pungent. Next time I will stick with the recipe recommendaton of sharp cheddar. It's good with bread and potatoe chips, too.

Left overs aren't so great. The broccoli flavor really deepens and overpowers the dairy.

I used a whole garlic clove and it minced up fine with the broccoli in the food processor. I served with multi-grain tostitos, the broccoli spears, tomatoes and baby carrots and it was devoured by my family, including picky 4 year old daughter.

Followed recipe exactly. Well received at a July Fourth dinner. Only change I'd make would be to thoroughly crush or mince the garlic before putting it in the processor.
