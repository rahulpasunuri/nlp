Excellent! I used rib eye steak rather than the chuck steak the recipe called for... it was my lucky day and the rib eyes happened to be on sale. The mushroom-madeira sauce was the perfect combination. My husband is already asking when I am planning on making this again.

I made this with grass fed chuck eye steaks from the farmers market and the flavor of the grass fed meat stands up to the madeira sauce for a nice balance. I undercooked the meat a little then kept it warm while I made the sauce and it coasted in beautifully with velvety texture and nice flavor

Go for the sirloins or chicken breast stuffed w mushrooms & rice. The best of this recipe is the sauce. I put the mushrooms & some stock in my mini cusinart. The result was a great smoothe sauce to go under the featured presentation. Make in advance and freeze in multiple proportions in ziplok sandwich bags.

I thought this was an easy and flavorful dish but needed some kick. Next time I will use beef broth instead of water and maybe a splash of Lea & Perrins. Maybe a drop of hot sauce. I had to use two teas. of cornstarch for the right consistency.

The mushroom sauce on this is really good, but *don't* use blade steaks! They're tough, and my boyfriend wasn't able to finish his. Make the mushrooms and serve with a good cut of steak instead.

This was a tasty, easy weeknight dish. We used sirloin because our butcher didn't have blade steaks, and it turned out beautifully. Sure, using corn starch to thicken is a little out of the ordinary, but it tasted good and came together quickly. The sauce also reheated quite well the next day for lunch (I dunked cold steak in the warm sauce - pretty good!)

Cornstarch mixed with water to thicken a sauce? Mon Dieu! That's ancient, blah American/Chinese -- not French. A waste of steak, Madeira and mushrooms.

Easy for a week night supper, but nothing truly memorable.
