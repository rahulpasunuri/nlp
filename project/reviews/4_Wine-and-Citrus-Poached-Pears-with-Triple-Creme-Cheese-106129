This was great. I didn't have creme de cassis and it was still very good. I added fresh whipped cream on the side and a few mint sprigs. No problem with the stems - they sliced easily in half, lengthwise. Maybe I should be a chef.

I used 1 whole bosc pears per guests and didn't slice to serve. Easy and very elegant - tasty, tasty. Beautiful, light dessert after a heavy meal. I served with a cheese course instead of the one cheese. A hit.

I too had trouble with the stems. Luckily I as able to lcate a supplier on-line and had some extras fown in from New Zealand. Served them on the side. This helped make our guests feel like they were part of the serving/eating process as they could select their own stems. YUM!

yum! made a couple changes on presentation - did not fan out the pears but left the halves intact and scooped out a half-sphere in the center of each - rolled the cheese into small balls and dipped each in walnuts. Very pretty!

I have made this recipe twice so far - once for myself and husband as guinea-pigs and once for friends at a dinner party. All of them have asked for a copy of the recipe - I had no problem splitting the stems and because the pears lie flat on the plate, each portion still looks like it has a complete stem.

On reading the recipe it states for four people - 2 pears, peeled, stems left attached, halved lengthwise, cored. How can you have four stems out of two pears? The picture clearly shows a pear half with a whole stem. I am going to try this recipe but with four pears - in order to have four stems (for presentation) -I think there must be an error in this recipe unless I am missing something. I also consulted a chef and several others and they all state it is impossible - you cannot slice a stem lengthwise. The recipe is in January, 2002 Bon Appetit.
