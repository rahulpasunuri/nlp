I love this recipe, without the cheese, been making it for years from one of my favorite December B.A. issues. A perfect ratio of ingredient make a yummy yellow cornbread. Leftovers make an interestingly textured stuffing. Go for it.

Very tasty! Added some fresh sage into the batter which added a lot.

Finally a cornbread recipe I love! I always find them too dry but this recipe with the extra 1/2 cup of buttermilk and cheese makes the perfect cornbread!

Good cornbread. It's not too sweet like a lot of recipes, and the cheese is a great addition. Followed the recipe exactly, but I didn't have a metal 8X8 pan so I used glass. It took about 10 minutes longer in the oven, but turned out great.

So good- if you make a couple adjustments....I added 1/2 cup cream and instead of shredding the cheese I made 1/4 inch cubes. I baked for 21 minutes in a metal pan and it was perfect.

In the past 2 days, I've tried 2 different Epicurious corn bread recipes: this and one called Easy Corn Bread. I'm not sure why, but I preferred the other. I made this Cheddar-Buttermilk recipe exactly as written (i.e., I didn't incorporate any of the previous reviewers' suggestions), so maybe that's why I wasn't that impressed with it.

Rating: 4
As previous reviewers suggested, I increased the buttermilk to 1 1/2 cups and instead of a cup of shredded cheese, I added a half cup of heavy cream. I increase the sugar by about an 8th of a cup (I'm a yankee, I like my cornbread a little sweet), but it didn't seem to do a whole lot. These changes resulted in an extremely moist and even crumb cornbread that was absolutely delicious. I was very impressed as previous cornbread recipes I've tried have been disappointing. I baked it in an 8x8 glass baking dish and the crust got pretty brown (baked it for 25 mins @ 400), but didn't taste burned at all. Overall? Delicious! Highly recommended.

I also doubled the cheese and buttermilk and added a bit of real corn. My friends raved about how good it was. In my convection oven the top was browned a bit, but it's also tricky to cook since the cheese will make the fork come out "wet." This was a good recipe!

Very good. Moist and flavorful. Increased the buttermilk to 1 1/2 cups and baked in muffin tins.

these were awful. made them for thanksgiving and had to throw them out. they taste like bricks. jiffy mix was 100% better than these.

I've never ventured into the cheese cornbread realm before. I have to say, this recipe came out fantastic the first time. I mixed orange cheddar with extra sharp white cheddar. I added more buttermilk, as was suggested. I also added red bell pepper. My version was gluten free; I used Bob's Red Mill All Purpose Flour. The cornbread was very moist and delicious. My husband, who has Celiac, loved it.

I followed some of the suggestions of other reviewers here and doubled the cheese and buttermilk. I also added 1 diced jalepeno and about 1/2 cup corn kernels (defrosted frozen or cut from a cooked cob - even better), and it came out AWESOME!

Rating: 4
I gave this receipe a high rating only because I needed to add a few more ingredients to make it terrific. I agree that it still needed something to I added 3 habanero peppers (depending on how much heat you like).I also added one stick of butter as recommended and twice the amount of cheese. I used canned corn and mixed some of the corn water into the buttermilk to make 1 cup. I also used honey instead of sugar. It was awesome!

I made Chili for dinner and what better than a warm corn bread on the side? Well, I add an extra ½ cup of butter milk, 1 cup of frozen corn (defrosted) and a handful of chopped cilantro. I baked it in muffin pan. It was delicious! I will definitely make it again.

I took the other reviewers advice and added corn,jalapeno, extra buttermilk and cheese. I also used King Aurther whole wheat white flour which probably made it a little heavier, but it was still very good if you are trying to get a little more fiber in your diet. Definitely serve with honey butter!

This is a great recipe. I added some corn to the mix, was incredible. Just sauted the corn until slightly brown, added wonderful flavour and texture to the bread.

Rating: 4
Fast and delicious. I also added the extra 1/2 cup of buttermilk and the full stick of butter. Used Polenta meal for extra crunch and one minced jalapeno. Also used shredded 3-cheese I had in my fridge and put extra on top of bread before baking. Very cheesy. A real hit...

This was really delicious corn bread. I added an extra 1/2 c buttermilk as mentioned by other reviewers, and used coarsely ground polenta instead of regular fine ground cornmeal since it's all I had--the coarse gring was actually really nice and gave the cornbread a lovely texture.

Rating: 4
I made this with all the considerations that the other reviewers had- such as adding more sugar and buttermilk and it turned out incredible. We could not taste the cheddar, but I would still keep it in as I believe it adds moisture. I also baked it in a muffin pan which was great as the tops were nice and crunchy and the bases were still soft. Everyone raved about the cornbread and I served it with whipped butter and honey. Delicious!!!

I tried the recipe as is to see what it was like and overall it was pretty good. I made cornbread muffins earlier in the day using another recipe that called for more sugar and oil (no cheese). This recipe came out moister with the cheese but was not as sweet as the other recipe. I will follow the suggestions of the reviewers next time and try adding a little more buttermilk and sugar and definitely more cheese. Increasing all three will likely make this recipe a keeper.

Good basic cornbread recipe..I added fresh corn and that provided a nice texture. I think it could be a bit sweeter so maybe next time I will add some honey or more sugar.

Rating: 3
Added .5 cup of heavy cream instead of the additional buttermilk. Doubled butter, as per suggestions (ie, whole stick used). Also, soaked a chopped habenaro in the milk products for an hour (and added into the batter). Used habenero cheddar as well. I still give it only a 4 (of 10) on hotness scale. Great cornbread though, but something was missing...

very good for how easy it was to make. I added some dried thyme and oregano and some black pepper to give it a little more flavor which turned out well. I felt it was too buttery though, maybe less butter next time or a bit less cheese. Otherwise very tasty. Husband LOVED it.

It couldn't have been easier or more delicious :). This dish got rave reviews from my guests and they kept asking for more....

I thought this dish turned out great! It was very moist and not heavy at all. I served it with a mexican casserole, and I think it would go great with chili as well. I may try what another cook suggested and use pepper jack cheese next time, just to spice it up a bit. This was a keeper!

yummy! one thing only: more cheese! I served it with jerk pork, black beans and tomato salad and sweet potato fries and everyone LOVED it! Also very good with breakfast!

I liked this recipe, but I also tuned it up a bit. I increased the Buttermilk to 1 1/2 cups, the butter to 1/2 cup (a whole stick), and added 4 oz of pepperjack cheese. Everyone loved it! I also had to double the recipe for a 12 X 16 X 1 pan for a large party. It worked great!

I was not as impressed with this recipe as previous reviewers. I took their suggestions and added 1/3c. sugar, 1/4c more cheese, buttermilk, butter and it was just far too dense...it was like a lead ball sitting in my stomach...not my idea of corn bread. It also lacked flavour. Perhaps I would try the original recipe again, but these changes didn't work for me.

This is by far the best cornbread recipe I've tried. I did as others suggested and upped the buttermilk to 1 1/2 cups. I left all the other ingredients as is. So easy, moist and delicious. I've baked this 3 times now and love it.

Rating: 3
I did what I was told and increased the buttermilk (by half a cup) and butter (by half a stick.) The result had a texture more like polenta or spoon bread than the usual cakey cornbread, and it was delicious. I wanted to make another pan, right away, and eat it all myself.

This recipe just could not be any easier. It's a great, simple, savory cornbread - and the cheese really kicks the whole thing up. I also took everyone's advice about increasing the buttermilk, and found it to be moist.

This isn't the cakey kind of corn bread I usually make but It was great with Picidillo Chili. I made my cornbread with smoked cheddar and it was delicious.

This was such a quick and easy bread to make, and very moist. I took the advice of previous cooks and made adjustments to the amount of sugar(1/3 cup instead of 1/4 cup), buttermilk (+1/2cup), and butter (+1/4 cup) used. I also decreased the baking soda to 1/2 tsp. A

Found it to be very dry... will try adding more buttermilk next go around. Liked the addition of cheese.

I made just as the recipe calls and thought it was on the dry side, and a little bland as well.

First, I made a "tester" bread, as I'm more a cook than baker...and it came out divine. I made another the next day for an office party and may have been off with the time as it sank slightly in the middle. I thought the worst and was going to ditch it, but brought it in anyway and it was a huge hit - noone cared about the divet - they just wanted more! It is definitely a keeper.

Loved this recipe as a base for the Southwestern Corn Pudding. Yes, it does need more moisture, a 1/3 cup more buttermilk and 2 more ounces of cheese. It is important not to overbake.

A little dry but I would try it again. Had nice flavor I just prefer it a little bit more moist.

I definitely added more cheese (about 6 oz. total) and buttermilk (an extra 1/3 cup) and it came out nice and moist. Good idea with the Old Bay...gives it a nice flavour.

Before I made this receipe I carefully read everyone's comments. So I added more cheese, more buttermilk, and green onions. It was still a bland, bland recipe and did not have a distinct buttermilk or cheese flavor. With all the extra ingredients (and cost) that you have to add, you'd be ahead just to make a basic corn bread recipe.

I thought it was good. I served to a friend from Baton Rouge who considers himself an expert on corn bread. He raved about it and was actually shocked it contained cheese. Next time, I might add a spoonful of congealed bacon grease to moisten and flavor.

I especially liked this corn bread served warm. I might add green onions or chives next time.

An easy recipe, but kind of bland. I added Old Bay seasoning to the batter to live it up, which made it more interesting. I would definately add more cheddar cheese the next time

This recipe was good, but I thought a bit dry. It has potential so the next time I make it I plan on adding more butter, buttermilk and cheese to see if that helps.
