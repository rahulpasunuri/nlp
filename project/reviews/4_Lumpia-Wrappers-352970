I write this review as someone who has no idea of how a lumpia wrapper should taste, however I found them really easy to make. My only comment, and this is probably because my dough wasn't thin enough, was that I only got around 5 wrappers out of the recipe. I had to double it to match the lumpia filling recipe. Overall I enjoyed this dish, and found the sweet garlic sauce was essential!
