Also - we are vegetarian so replaced fish sauce with soy sauce and used a squirt of sriracha in place of tabasco. Fantastic!

Made this three times in the last week - it's a fantastic summer salad with the ripe mango that's been on sale at the market! I skimped on prep time by using prepared slaw (pre-chopped cabbage and carrots) from the grocery instead of cabbage/carrots called for here and doubled mango since I had so much. Delicious main course or side with a stir fry!

Made the dressing as written, but increased the greens and herbs. Lovely! We fought over the last bite.

We reduced the fish sauce and eliminated the cilantro. Beautiful and delicious!

Really good. However, I used way less sesame oil - scant 1/2 T. I never use more than a few teaspoons for most recipes that call for sesame oil. I added the corresponding amount of canola oil to compensate. Also added julienned red bell pepper. Fried rice sticks may be a good (but not so healthy) addition. I used more watercress and cabbage than listed, but the amount of dressing was still good. Don't over- dress this salad.

Loved it! I agree, more mango could be used. I, too, used sriracha sauce and the spicy dressing was great. No need to remove all stems from watercress. Jicama might make a good addition, but with any Asian main dish, this is a good salad to use.

Twenty minutes, hogwash. It took that long just to trim the leaves from the watercress. I used savoy cabbage instead of Napa cabbage, and I quite liked it, but not enough to bother making it again as it did take quite a long time (and got no comment either way from the guests).

this was an excellent dressing, even if my mom didn't like it. it tastes very asian with the sesame oil (i used hot pepper sesame oil, which made it extremely spicy). i didn't make the salad, i just used persimmons and mixed baby greens instead.

Although I was a little hesitant to use so much sesame oil, I made the dressing exactly as the recipe called for and it was delightful. Since it was on hand, I used baby salad greens, omitted the carrot and addes toasted pecans and thin sliced red onions. The company loved it. I think it will go well with any type of fruit and I'm sure will be using the dressing often.

This salad is so simple to make and it tastes divine! Normally, I find watercress a bit too peppery for my palate, but mixed with the napa cabbage and all of the herbs, it balances perfectly. And I love how you've got a mixture of all 5 taste sensations in the same dish: bitter from the watercress, sweet from the mango, salty from the fish sauce, sour from the lime juice and spicy from the hot sauce. (I used Siracha sauce rather than Tabasco for a more authentic South East Asian flavor.) I served this with grilled shrimped that had been rubbed in Thai spices (I used Penzey's Bangkok blend), and the results were a light, quick supper that was beyond compare!

This is a great combination of flavors. We were disappointed only because we served it with our dinner, instead of as a separate course, and it didn't match up well. We will make it again and serve it separately, and maybe preceeding either an Asian style or tropical style dinner.

This makes quite alot (could serve more than 4) and depending on the size of your mangoes, you might want to use two. Really light and delicious. The addition of avocado is a great idea. I was also thinking it would be nice with some grilled large shrimp. Will definitely make again.

Very nice salad. I loved the mix of flavors and all the fresh herbs. The dressing is also very nice. I had an avacodo that I used too. Perfect for a dinner party. If you are not partial to fish sauce, cut the amount in half, it won't be so overpowering
