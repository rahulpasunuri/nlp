Everyone who tries this salad loves it. I modify the dressing a bit. 1/4 cup of olive oil instead of the 1/2 cup. A touch more orange juice and a mashed garlic clove with 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Fantastic!

Just made this for a dinner party and had rave reviews. I made just as described but used the bagged butter lettuce mix (2 bags) and doubled the dressing for a party of 8. I probably added 1/2 tsp to 1 tsp. salt and lots of ground black pepper. Excellent and fresh salad.

This was fast and delicious. I served it with a marinated salmon and couscous with roasted vegetables. I will make this again soon!

I made just the salad dressing used in the recipe and it was fabulous. Incredibly easy and quick. Two thumbs up!

It was okay. I would only make it again if I didn't know what else to serve & had all of the ingredients. It's not going into my file.

A delightfully different salad. Easy to throw together. Makes a nice, light first course or accompanying salad. I served it with the almond crusted salmon, rosemary potatoes and lightly buttered green beans. Great combo. Raves all around.

My guest and family loved this salad. The dressing has a very nice balance. I agree with some of the other reviewers, having the Blue Cheese toasts is a great addition to the salad.

Don't know what all the fuss is about. I found this salad recipe to be just okay. Nothing special. My husband feels the same. It's nothing special.

I served this at a dinner party plus the blue cheese toasts - what a presentation and flavors - outstanding

Served as a first course - just amazing. I wouldn't necessarily do the bleu cheese toasts again - I don't think they make this salad. This was a perfect salad and the dressing was just delicious! A+++

I served this as a first course with the blue cheese toasts on the plate with the salad. It was a lovely presentation (very "restauranty") and very delicious. I highly recommend making the toasts with the salad- they only take a minute to make and really complement the salad. I'd make them just as an appetizer too.

I one-and-a-halved this recipe and made a tossed salad version to take to a dinner gathering. It was very attractive and most of the guests came back for seconds.

This is a beautiful and simple salad which is easy to assemble either before or during a dinner party. I substituted pears for the avocados, both for looks and taste. The dressing and blue cheese toasts complemented each other very well. Guests raved.

I only had dried sour cherries and it was a great combo! Adefinate keeper

This is a refreshing salad. The cranberries give it a tart bite while the cheese mellows it. It received rave reviews from all of our dinner guests.
