Pretty tasty. We had one bowl each per this recipe then made some tweaks to the broth: added more fish sauce, a little more salt, simmered for about another 45 min with all the bones/spices (no onions because I threw those out after the first boil), strained it then simmered for another hour. This intensified the flavor. Yum.

If you live within 50 miles of a pho restaurant, this recipe is totally not worth the time to prepare. Save yourself those 4 hours of prep time and drive to the restaurant. It was edible, but not nearly as good as any of our local pho places, and the time & effort involved is absurd. Especially since pho is one of the cheapest meals you can eat out.

Can anyone find within the recipe the purpose of the charred knife?

A Vietnamese friend of mine told not to put a lid on the broth as it simmers as this will cause the broth to darken and not have the light color. She said it doesn't effect taste. Can someone tell my why a lid effects the color of the broth. I believe her, she and her family are originally from Vietnam.. I'd just like to know why this happens. Today is my second attempt and cooking Pho. First try wasn't too bad. Hope to improve! Any tips would help

Not worth the effort unless you are cooking for a large crowd. Just go down to your favorite "Pho" restaurant.

I just returned from Viet Nam where we even had pho for breakfast, so I've been looking for a recipe that would at least approximate the yummy soup. This recipe is wonderful, my husband announced it smelled "just like real pho", and proceeded to eat two bowls. Due to pot size constraints i had to halve the recipe. Also, i skipped the beef chuck using only marrow bones for the broth. Admittedly this is a ton of work for one supper with leftovers, but since it freezes well (I tried) i'm going to pull my canning pot out and make a huge batch so we can have pho all the time :)

If you can find high quality star anise, not the .99cts in small packet, the fragrance of broth is unbelievably delicious. And also try the fresh and soft type of rice noodle.

I love pho but i never eat the beef type as I am allegic and always eat the chicken pho. when I have eaten it at other place there is a wonder basket of fresh mung bean sprouts, fresh thai basil leaves, 2 lime wedges, and fresh sliced green jalepenos. which I always promptly add to the soup right before I eat it. to make chicken pho I am sure you could use chicken stock instead of the beef joints and thin slices of pounded chicken breast pieces instead of beef.

I need to cook for 10 people so do I need change the ingredients ?

Really very good. Am thining about making again tomorrow. Next time will make double and freeze stock. Only made one change since I went to 2 markets and I couldn't get star anise. Used 4 tsp of anise seeds and couple pinches of fennel seeds in place of the 4 stars recommended by others(and toasted the seeds). I might reduce salt next time - wouldn't have been lacking with a 1/4 T less. Also, wondering if you need a full 2lbs chuck. Not a big fan. Maybe it would be okay with more marrow bones to make up for it.

Delicious! Yes, time consuming but most of the time is inactive time so it isn't a big deal. Like some of the other readers recommended I used on 3 "stars" of star anise (10 would have been crazy overboard). I also added additional aromatic herbs as another reader suggested (cardamom pod; 1T fennel seed; 1T coriander seed) quickly toasted all those spices in a small frying pan before putting in cheesecloth and adding to the broth.

What the Pho? This smelled amazing, but the broth was ho-hum.. kinda' bland, and not at all worth the effort.

I've been looking for a pho recipe ever since I first tried it... mine was definitely not as good as my local Vietnam cafe in Kansas City, but it was pretty close. I went with mdodd73's suggestion of the other aromatic spices: thank you! what a delicious addition. the broth turned out really well but right before I constructed the pho, I thought it was too salty and added some water... what a terrible idea that was! the rice noodles and fresh veggies really cut the salt, so my broth ended up too bland... nothing that a little more time on the burner didn't fix. My grocery store only had 2 lbs of marrow bones so I supplimented the other 3 lbs with beef short ribs. the meat was so tender it fell of the bone and I ended up using that instead of the chuck. Maybe not the most traditional but it ended up being delish!

This is a pretty good recipe, but the amount of sugar suggested is way too much, and the amount of salt was not enough.

Great start, but as I found out from trial error and other authentic sources (my wife's mom), here are a few alterations: 1.) Only use about 3-4 whole star anise. Also add to the mix: 5 whole cloves, 1 tbl fennel, 1 tbl whole corriander seeds, 1 cardamom pod (if you can only get the small ones, use 1 tbl) Toast over medium flame in a small non-stick skillet (like for fried eggs). Only toast till they're fregrant or they'll burn. Put them in a spice bag (cheese cloth tied with linen or cotton twine) or mesh container. 2.) Deeply char the Onion and ginger, this lends to a smokier deeper flavor. 3.) Use nice long marrow bones and knuckles. You may need to buy more, cause some places give you a mix, and some bones have little to no marrow in them. These bones can be tossed to the dog, cause they offer no flavor and take up room in your pot. When you parboil them, don't let the boil get too vigerous, because it will prematurely eat away at the marrow. This is marrow you want in your broth. It will also turn the remaining marrow an icky dark grey color. This doesn't hurt the flavor, but it makes the broth darker, and you want to strive for a clean transparent color.

This is a great recipe. I didn't have the ginger and it still turned out really good. Makes me feel silly for going out to eat this since it is so simple. Yes making the broth takes some time, but mostly consists of boiling, add a few things, simmer. It also helped that my husband had someone to help him navigate the ingredients at the Asian markets.

This is a great recipe, and I made it just as stated. My only issue was with the noodles. Does anyone know where to get good rice noodles in Boston, MA? The ones I used were limp and just about ruined the dish. The soup was exceptionally fragrant tho, and you could just smell pho after you add the spice bag! Amazing - and no MSG!

I made this for my boyfriend's birthday and it was better than any Pho that we've eaten in Vietnamese restaurants. Cooking the broth from scratch is time consuming but well worth it. I simmered the broth for about 10 hours before serving it. I suggest adding hot sauce (like Chinese srirchacha) and hoisen to the table so people can add to their liking. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious. I will be making this again for sure.

Made this for an impromptu dinner party last night, and it went over really well. I do think having vat-like bowls is important, since you need to be able to navigate the wodge of noodles and beef. If they aren't swimming in broth, it can be hard. This stock turned out really well, but I think next time I will make it the night before, since moving beef around and straining it makes for a messy kitchen. Next time, I may also double the sirloin (grilling half and leaving half raw) and just leave out the chuck and use more marrow bones. The chuck was too tasteless and rubbery afterwards, even with the cold chilling technique. The ginger, onion, anise and cloves were wonderful, and I didn't have any problems with them overpowering the broth. And we had lots of basils and chiles and things to add at the table, so even our too-shallow bowls looked and smelled heavenly. It made me miss San Francisco and Kim Son in the Richmond just the tiniest bit less.

I followed the recipe exactly and found it to be the best Pho I've eaten. Most restaraunts don't have the depth of flavor this recipe produced because they shortcut. It was well worth the effort for entertaining friends at dinner and fun for all. If you make the broth and freeze it you can mix a small amount later with instant broths for an amazing flavor that only takes minutes to pull together for a quick lunch. The ginger and onion are charred only to make peeling easier- do what ever is easiest for you. Sliced sirloin is awesome 1/16 to 1/8 thin. This also comes out better than what you get at most Pho houses. I've made this several times and will continue to.

Best recipe so far, but learned additional tips from Vietnamese cooks. To add dimension to the broth, boil the listed broth ingredients with peeled daikon roots, a peeled chayote, and the dried peel of a tangerine. These will confer depth usually provided by the MSG of the quick "pho mixes." Moreover, don't be discouraged by the gelatinous nature of the cooled broth as this is due to the tendons; broth will liquefy upon heating. Broth can be made ahead of time. It can be reduced and frozen, to be reconstituted at a later date when pho can be quickly assembled. Buy the "fresh" pho noodles in the refrigerated section of Asian stores, which requires no pre-soaking and a 40-second dip in boiling water. Uncooked extras can also be frozen.

If I could make a suggestion..this recipe is very authentic, but like many authentic recipes, is not an everyday thing. Grandma's is best but she had a lot more time and skill than I do. So...for a inauthentic but solid Pho--just change the broth portion of this recipe. If I have time, I'll just boil ox tail bones..if not, here comes the beef broth mix. I boil it for a while with the ginger, green onions (just peeled, no time to charr, ok?), etc. except....for the anise. There's many many types of anise, and the most common one here seems to come from China which is a bit stronger. Use...like three. And I don't have time to toast, sorry Grandma.

Absolutely perfect. Time-consuming, yes, but well worth the effort. I made this for my partner, who is generally not a big fan of Southeast Asian cooking, and he absolutely loved it. Will definitely make again and again and again. Lots of toppings make it fun to eat as well.

Overall this recipe was decent, with a lot of good details - however last time some aspects failed so badly, I had to re-do. failures had to do with a lack of knowledge about ingredients. This second time I used one tenth the amount of anise referred to in the recipe. The anise I bought at the asian market was like some sort of anise on mega steroids, and you could smell it outside of the package. Also simmered the bones overnight, and left out the beef chuck altogether (it turned out rubbery last time, so this time I didn't bother.) The marrow bones I purchased yielded a good cup of fat -- and it took a bit of time to cool and separate off the fat (a fat separator would probably have really helped) With these adaptations, the soup was absolutely excellent. We were able to enjoy it over several meals. Also, I soaked excess noodles one night, and was able to drain, refrigerate, and boil them a few days later. If you are new to these noodles, it might be helpful to do a sample soak/boil/rest to see how it all goes. The noodles will continue to cook and soften even as you eat the hot broth.

Don't know exactly why mine didn't turn out. However, the anise I bought (from an Asian market) was so overwhelming, you could smell it in the next town over after 15 min. of simmering (removed it after 15 min., but the resulting soup was like unsweetened licorice -- not good at all). Also, I was able to buy the fresh noodles, which turned to mush after 10 secs. on the boil. Next I tried pouring hot broth directly over them, and they were fine, as long as they didn't sit more than 10 min. (hubby took about 20 min. to get to his piping hot bowl, and by then noodles had quadrupled in size and were ultra-soft and mushy.) However, I'm going to give it another go! How hard can it be! Once you figure out how to char the ginger and onion, I think the most time-consuming part of the recipe is amalgamating the different fresh ingredients. If you're lucky, you can get all the ingredients at the same place. Then with a little advance planning this dish should be a snap. My mom mentioned to me that her Vietnamese acquaintances suggest this broth can be simmered overnight. I'm going to try that next. Also, the bones which I bought at a Chinese market on Clement were .69 per lb., and the computerized label said "cow feet". The bones I bought today at the local all-american market were $2.69 lb. WOW.

I took a huge shortcut and used a package of pho bo broth (mixed with 10 cups water and brought to a boil). It was so much fun making the pho, even though I didn't do it completely from scratch. I just started with step #3 and put it all together. It was delicious and I will definitely share this recipe with everyone who loves Pho as much as me.

I pretty much made this by the book. It was very good and having made it, I can see that the local restaurants here must be using the 'quick' version and not the from scratch version here. The broth really is the clue. The ginger made it slightly yellow and the beef color was not strong. The added salt was dead on and really, I wish I had added more as the noodles really did cut the salt flavor out. One reviewwer talked about the ratio of beef to bones, that may be an idea as the bones really did not produce a strong beef flavor I have had in most restaurants....but then again, they may be using premade broth. My other clue to this fact was the amount of oil or fat in the broth. I never seeit in the rstaurant, but it was very evident in this broth. Everything tasted so very good though! I used a bit more hoisin sauce than in the restaurant, probably due to the smaller salt content in this version of sauce, but I had it to where I liked it in no time. I made this for the family as they have never had this before and everyone loved it. It is light and fresh. My 3 year old ate it up! I would make it again, but I may save this long version for very special occaisions.

Although starting from the beginning is definately the way to go, I make a quicker variation by staring with beef broth and forgoing the charring of the onion and ginger. Toast the other spices and simmer for 20-30 minutes while prepping the herbs and this is an awesome 30' prep weeknight meal. If you can get heavy soup bowls appropriate for cooking in (mine are from a Korean market, I'm not sure which other countries they're common in), heat up the bowl before adding everything and the soup'll stay hot for as long as you take to enjoy it The heavy bowl makes all the difference.

When dining in a Vietnamese restaurant, I always order Pho because it is my favorite. I finally got up the courage to try this recipe and I have no regrets! It turned out perfect! I will definitely incorporate this into my regular recipe rotation since lime, cilantro and mint are among my favorite flavors. True this recipe is relatively easy, but I'm not sure it's worth going through all the motions everytime. I will probably try some short cuts on the broth next time (store-bought rather than from scratch), but I am not averse to going the long route again. I got lucky because I live near a large international grocery. Getting the "proper" ingredients could be difficult if you don't have the same access to resources as me.

This is one of the best dished I've ever made. Yes, it takes some time, but it is not at all difficult, and it's hard to mess it up. I did not add extra meat as a condiment, and it wasn't missed. But other than that, I followed the recipe. This is great for dinner parties...you can do almost all of it in advance, and its nice to pass the little toppings around the table. Vietnamese food is just so bright and fresh-tasting!

Granted, this recipe is long to make and seems intimidating. But the steps were easy and the result delicious. It's weekend afternoon kind of recipe. I made the whole batch and freezed the broth I didn't use for later times. Because, really, after the broth is done, everything else is quick and easy. If I had a Pho Bo Ga restaurant across the street, I wouldn't bother making this, but since I don't, this was just as good. I substituted pork hocks for the beef chuck since I couldn't afford the beef, and it came out very nicely. I also used italian basil since I didn't find any of the asian stuff, and it came out nice. Also, I used that thinly sliced raw beef they sell for chinese fondue/hot pot at the Asian food market, and it was just like at the restaurant. What's great about this soup is that it's a great flu soup. With that star anise (apparently used for Tamiflu, I've heard), lime, chilies, and fragrant herbs, I can see how it would do a sick person's body good. Delicious.

Fabulous and very authentic! A Vietnamese friend recently made it for me and explained the whole process to me and this is exactly the same, down to the star anise and cloves at the end. Also, it's much better than the pho at any Vietnamese restaurant where I've eaten. I think because the nature of the business, they usually don't make the broth with such detail, letting it simmer for that long. I also added fresh mint as a condiment which adds to the wonderfully fresh flavor. A lot of work, but definitely well worth it.

I found this recipe lacking on two major fronts. The broth turned out weak and watery (and I simmered it for an extra hour). I think that it would benefit from a higher proportion of beef to bones. Also, some browning couldn't hurt. I ended up adding a healthy portion of stock base to get the beef flavor it should have had. Second, the chuck roast simmered for 40 minutes was absolutely flavorless. Again, after cooking I had to improvise and marinate the beef with scallions, lime, fish sauce and some other items to give it flavor. I will not make this again.
