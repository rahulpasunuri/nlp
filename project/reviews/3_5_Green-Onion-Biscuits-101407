I have used this recipe for the last several Easters and always get rave reviews on these biscuits. I follow the recipe exactly and these biscuits turn out perfectly every time. Yum!

I have been making these ever Easter since the recipe first came out. My family says it isn't Easter without them! I agree with an earlier review that the onion flavor is not over powering, it's "just right"

Unfortunately this recipe falls short on all counts. It just doesn't work. I've made all different biscuts for years. How can there be 3 cups of flour and 2 1/3 cups of liquid? As you can imagine the consistency of the dough was nearly soupy. Stick with a buttermilk biscuit Nov 2001 issue has a great recipe for Green Onion Buttermilk Biscuits.

This biscuits are delicious. They are so moist and creamy. I have made them for years, and they are always a hit.

I made these last night and used the 2 1/3 cups of liquid that the recipe said to use. The dough was so soupy that we had to add flour to knead the dough. Adding flour made the biscuits heavy and they didnt' rise. The consistency was even too runny for drop biscuits. Is this amount of liquid perhaps a misprint?

Save the calories and money and make regular baking powder biscuits without whipping cream.

These are amazing! I thought the onion flavor would be overpowering but it's just right. Ate it with black forest ham and honey dijon mustard!

This is one of the best recipes in one of the greatest Bon Appetit issues I've ever read (April 1999). The biscuits bake up easily, and have big flavor. I usually make them to go with a hearty soup or stew. I freeze leftovers and pop them in the toaster oven for a quick addition to weekday meals.

These are terrific! They are so easy to make! I used garden fresh green onions (I had so many I didn't know what to do with them); the flavor was amazing! Even a few days later they were light and flaky, they were even good at room temperature! I used 2 cups whipping cream and 1/3 cup milk.

I've been making this recipe since it was first published in 1999. I always add a few handfulls of high quality shredded sharp white cheddar, and they turn out beautifully. They pair well with winter stews and spring lamb and summer grillables. Great recipe!

EASY RECIPE. WILL SURELY MAKE AGAIN. I MADE A LITTLE HAM SANDWICH WITH ONE AND IT WAS A PERFECT COMBINATION.

These Green Onion (Scallion) Biscuits are beyond scrumptious! I have made them, over and over again, since I first discovered the recipe in Bon Appetit. They work with nearly every meal that needs a hint of flavor to add zip. I've served them both "solo", as an accoutrement, with accolades, non-stop! These ARE the perfect biscuits to enjoy with left-over bites of ham or other meats in a sandwich-type of pleasure, or merely rewarmed one their own -- tremendously divine. A+++

Loved these biscuits! Although if you only use about half of the stalk you will need at least 3 bundles of onions. I will make these again and again.

Fabulous recipe. Didn't have any green onions, but plenty of fresh chives -- so I've substituted them each time I've made these. They came out perfect eavery time. Guests rave! These are a staple in my house now.

My husband liked these, but no one raved or asked about them. I thought they were "ok".. there are better biscuit recipes to be found.

I found this recipe to be fairly simple and tasty. I've made it a couple of times and it went over well each time. They are nice served with chowder. Even my picky 4 year old likes them. (Shhh... don't tell him that the green stuff is onion).

I made these biscuits to accompany a dinner that I made for a few guys at school. They were lathered in butter and devoured. It was a huge hit!

I had these at a luncheon this week & loved them so much, came home and made them for my family last night- absolutely delicious & so different from any homemade biscuits I have had. Served with ham,potatoes with leeks and grruyere (also in April 99 Bon Appetite), & stir-fried pea pods DEE-LICIOUS!!

I agree with the reviewer who said not to make them too thick. Mine took twice as long to get done as the recipe said. They had a really fantastic flavor, though.

Excellent and EASY. I actually got 20 out of the recipe, which was lucky since they were so popular!

So good, but be careful not to make these too thick, or they will be doughy in the center.
