This was a delicious and very simple meal. I had friends over and everyone enjoyed it. Love the mayo mixture. Will definitely make this again and again.

Whenever I make this wrap for friends, I get rave reviews. Very tasty and very nutritous. The dressing makes twice as much as you need, so cut the portions in half.

Best wrap ever! I made it to recipe except I added 2 teaspoons of curry powder for a bit more bite. Served these at a potluck and got a lot of great compliments. Will definitely use this recipe again.

I have to dissent with the majority on this one. When I read the recipe and the comments I thought it would be great. Has ingredients that I love. Made it for hubby's lunch and he was not enthused, which I couldn't understand. Made it for my lunch the next day and I could see why, just not very interesting. Nice flavors but just didn't have any synergy.

GREAT! My husband and I agreed that next time we'll have it without the wrap, mixing it all together, adding more slaw to taste. I used 1/2 C mayo, left the rest the same, although we could have used more of that on some left over slaw!

Oopsie, my above review got cut off! I had said that there had to be an error, since 1c of mayo + 1/4c of chutney would mean that you'd have lots of the mayo mixture left-over if you only used 2T (1/8c) for each wrap or sandwich.

3/4c left. That being said, I usually use as much curried chutney mayo as I want (definitely more than the recommended 1/8th of a cup) and the sandwiches are always tasty. I suspect there is an error in the instructions, although it wouldn't be the first time my math has been faulty. Also, I don't use an entire cup of cilantro; it was less than 1/4c. And I almost forgot to mention that I used TJ's salted cashews instead of peanuts. AND, the last time I made these, I put them on French rolls.

WOW! Don't just pair this with run- of-the-mill chopped turkey. Marinate your breasts in a blend of minced garlic, chopped basil, and pepper (rub it on the meat, not just the skin), then marinate it in a liquid blend of veg oil, soy sauce, lemon juice and brown sugar. Stud the breast with a couple of cloves and let it siiiiit! This blend, combined with the curry/chutney mayo (and I even used orange marmalade because our Commissary doesn't carry mango chutney)...PHENOMENA L! DELICIOUS! PERFECT!

I am planning on making this for my child's birthday party along with chicken sate (satay?) with peanut sauce. I will advise that these items have peanuts in them but I am seriously not concerned. Thank you to the New Yorker who pointed me to that Harper's article. I am the journalism advisor at the high school I work in and this would be a great story for rthe school paper. This is my first review- and I get political? Figures.

This gets four stars for being delicious, easy and healthy! I used a store-bought rotisserie chicken and made my own mango chutney, using the recipe on this site from The Complete Book of Year-Round Small-Batch Preserving. Didn't have any slaw mix so I just grated carrots and cabbage. I reduced the ratio of mayo to chutney for less fat and more mango flavor. We ate these for dinner last night - it was so good I made myself another one today for lunch, and this time added some chopped spinach as well. Yummy!

certainly, how DARE anyone ever suggest a child go near a peanut. http://www.harpers.org/archive/2008/01/0081878

I adore this recipe. I've made it numerous times, usually using leftover roast chicken, and it's always excellent. I only wish chickens were larger, so I'd have more leftover meat to use in this recipe.

This was yummy - my kids loved it. Filling, with complex flavors and a great way to wring an unexpectedly tasty use out of all that leftover turkey. To the person complaining about its classification under "lunchbox recipes": we are adults, we can figure out to omit the peanuts if it's going in a child's lunchbox. This recipe is perfect for grownup lunches and will be consumed in a world where peanuts aren't yet banned. Let common sense prevail - and don't have a cow, man!

WOW! I needed to use up some leftover TG turkey, and this recipe is now my absolute favorite. I forgot to buy mango chutney and had to make my own (which actually was better, since I'm a diabetic, and could sweeten the chutney with Splenda). I mixed the diced turkey with the mayo, and since I dislike fresh cilantro in anything but salsa, I just added dried cilantro (Penzeys) then, too. I didn't have enough peanuts so I had to add a few cashews, but the crunch from them, plus the coleslaw mix, was just wonderful. I've promised to make a wrap for my husband tomorrow for lunch, which he usually doesn't ask me to do. I will definitely make this again, probably using grilled or roasted chicken, since we have that more often than turkey. But what a GREAT recipe!

I am sure this recipe is delicious but I cannot believe this has been put in back-to-school lunch ideas !! For years now, we have not been able to send our kids with any food containing nuts since many children have allergies. So, I am astounded to see this...although my children are not allergic I do my best to make sure I only make nut-free items for school and go out of my way to buy products made in nut free factories !! Please epicurious move this recipe to another section.

Very tasty and satisfying! I used salted cashews since I didn't have peanuts on hand. I was surprised my children, who normally don't eat cabbage, curry or cilantro, enjoyed them.

This is absolutely INCREDIBLE. I was trying to use turkey leftovers in a variety of ways after Tgiving, but after I hit upon this recipe, that was it for the experimentation. I ended up wanting to roast another turkey just to keep making this! Don't change a thing -- each ingredient adds up to a complex melange of flavor. Plus, it's quick and very easy.

This is an excellent receipe. My finicky kids are asking for it again.

What a terrific use of leftovers! The taste and presentation are so different then Thanksgiving dinner that it is hard to believe it is leftovers. We subed broccoli slaw, honey roasted peanuts, and added green onion. Simple, quick, and tastey! Would work well for left over roasted chicken too.

Fantastic! I can't wait to have leftover turkey so I can make these again. A great combination of flavors. Yummy.

A lot of flavor and textures in an easy-to-prepare dish that we enjoyed a lot. Was excellent with a simple hot homemade soup.

Very flavorful. I will make this again but will mix all of the filling ingredients together, adding just enough mayonnaise mixture to taste, intead of layering the filling ingredients. Also I would warm the tortillas prior to the filling.

Yum! The curried mayo and the cilantro really make this sandwich. I used a hot curry powder for a little heat. It was a nice change from the normal after-Thanksgiving turkey sandwiches. Great with baked potato chips.
