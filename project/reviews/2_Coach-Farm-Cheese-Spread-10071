I loved the flavor and texture of the finished product. However, I agree with other reviewers that the recipe as written is too expensive. I recommend halving the entire recipe, and then using a more reasonably priced goat cheese. Splurge on best-quality paprika instead.

Way too expensive to make for the drab results. Sorry but it was too "tart" and too pink from the paprika. My 8 guests were luke warm about it and there was a ton left over. Wah.
