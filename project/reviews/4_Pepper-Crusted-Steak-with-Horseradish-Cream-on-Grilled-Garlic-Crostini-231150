I made this for the first time for Christmas dinner, and my guests went insane over it. The horseradish cream was incredible...I am currently trying to fabricate other reasons to eat as much of it as possible (e.g. I was snacking on crudite with leftover horseradish cream today). I had originally resigned myself to using pre-fab horseradish, but I accidentally found fresh horseradish at one market when I was digging around for parsnips. I made the crostini and horseradish cream the day before, marinated the steak overnight, and it turned out perfectly. For a 1 1/2 inch thick steak, in my oven, broiling just under 4 minutes each side was perfect.

was fabulous, and a great match with Bordeaux style wine. I marinated the beef for nearly 24hrs, and think this was best

This recipe was great. I used the top sirloin and sliced it really thin and it worked great. I tried the boursin spread on like the other reviewer said and it was really good.

This was awesome. I made it for a huge party, and my hired teens were able to slice it and put it together when the original amount was devoured. Guests raved. It would be a tad easier to do as a former reviewer said - crostini with garlic rubbed on the surface - and I may do it that way next time.

Bought sirloin on sale and needed a quick marinade that same day. Only had time to marinate it for an hour. Pan seared the sirloin and baked until medium rare. Topped w gorgonzola cheese and broiled it. Didn't actually prepare the recipe, but the marinade was great and will use it again. Would be exceptional with overnight marination.

I only had about 40 minutes to marinate and I had porterhouse steak (a bit fatty) but the flavor was still awesome. Served as a meal on Crostini with the Horseradish Cream accompained with mix veggies with red beans and a salad. Can wait to have it again! Husband and son (12) really liked it too.

Okay, I skipped making the garlic crostini (I just sliced a baguette into 1/3" thick slices, toasted them on a sheet pan, and rubbed each one with garlic or a mixture of olive oil and garlic paste), and I simply combined jarred horseradish with creme fraiche and salt & pepper for a sauce ... And even then, WOW. I am making this for every party, forever. Or even just to have the meat for sandwiches. I've made similar recipes with beef tenderloin, and I'll never waste the money again. The London broil was so tender and flavorful, and the marinade so excellent ... I did double the peppercorns (accidentally). I cooked it several hours before serving, and just left it to sit at room temp. Absolute success. You CANNOT go wrong with this if you get a good piece of meat and slice it very thinly. Incidentally, since no cooking times were provided, I just set my broiler up and watched and waited. After exactly 10 minutes, my 2 lb. piece of meat was a perfect medium rare. I know everyone's oven is different, but I didn't expect it to cook so quickly -- just a bit of guidance.

Honestly have never used flank steak before but opted to try it over the often tough London Broil called for in the recipe. It was perfect for this recipe! The horseradish cream sauce adds just the right amount of kick - I also made a spread of mascarpone, tarragon, horseradish, salt, pepper and put that on top of the crostini then the flank steak and topped with the horseradish sauce. I served with extra horseradish sauce on the side for the more adventuresome!

Made this for a 30+ person holiday party. Followed marinated to a "T" but used Beaver brand horseradish to save time. Made crositini with LaBrea Bakery bread and took olive oil, garlic, etc in a food processor to make a quick garlic oil. The leftover meat made great sandwiches the next day.

Very good, very easy and feeds a crowd. I made two london broils, one rare and one medium. I used lots of coarse cracked peppercorns out of a jar. The garlic chars easily when grilling, but the overall taste was great.

Delicious! I used filet so that the beef would be tender. Also smeared a bit of Boursin on each crostini before topping with the beef and horseradish cream, for a bit of extra flavor and "oomph".

I served this at a party and a few of my friends were talking about it for weeks. I will definitely make this again.

Simply an amazing hors d'oeuvre. Flavor was wonderful and everyone loved it. Only change I made is that when I grilled the London Broil, I added hickory chips to the fire. It was great. Tasted great for lunch on a french roll the next day as well.

To Genuine810: It sounds like you sliced the meat 1.5 inches as a serving size, when the recipe calls for a whole steak that is 1.5 inches thick that is to be thinly sliced after grilling. If I am mistaken, I apologize, but I can understand the mistake, as I questioned the thickness of the meat when I read the ingredients list.

This recipe tasted great but no one wants to bite into a 1 1/2 inch piece of london broil. The picture is off in terms of the thickness of the meat. I wanted to make 120 pieces of this hors d'oeuvres therefore bought 12lb of meat and used only 6lb. I did cheat and use bagged crostini for ease.

I cracked the peppercorns with a mortar and pestle. It turned out wonderful. I will try with another cut of meat next time. It was a bit chewy.

Definitely try this! The marinade is fabulous...the meat so wonderfully flavorful and tender. I've made this for 3 parties now and it's gone within minutes.

great crowd pleaser! I made the following changes in addition to doubling the recipie: 1. Upgraded to filet as it was a holiday party 2. Used prepared horseradish and skipped the vinegar. The sauce wasn't as zippy as I'd expect with that much horseradish but still really light and tasty. Subbed out sour cream for 1/2 the heavy cream 3. Let the garlic/olive oil mixture sit overnight to enhance the flavor before grilling the crostini. PS -- Keep a close eye on the crostini while broiling -- they cook very quickly and can go from perfect to charred in a matter of seconds!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I made it for New Year's Eve and it went over very well. The coarse ground or kosher salt really pulls all the flavors together so try not to skip that step. I grilled the beef ahead of time and chilled, then assembled the crostini's about an hour before the party which allowed them to come to room temperature. I stored the extras in a cool pantry and put out about 90 minutes after the party started. This recipe is great as is, but I also made half of them with a little truffle oil drizzled over the top and it was well received! The reason I did not give the recipe 5 forks was only because as good as it is I wouldn't consider it over the top excellent. It's an above average snack with familiar flavors that everyone can love.

Fantastic. I used a whole been tenderloin instead, and cooked it on the grill with wood chips to add smoky flavor. Horseradish cream and garlic crostini are essential. Guests raved.

Rave reviews at my cocktail party. I made it with beef tenderloin instead of london broil, and cooked it on the grill at 400 degrees until it reached 130 degrees internal temp. Fabulous!!

I cheated on this, and it was STILL great. I made it for an on-the-fly get together and only had about 3 hours to prepare, so I thinly sliced the raw meat and marinated it that way. When it came time to cook it, I simply dumped the meat into a hot pan for a minute, and then proceeded with the rest of the recipe. Like I said, I cheated! It was still great though, and I had more than one request for the recipe.

Fantastic marinade! Love this for parties! It is the number one request for our Christmas party by friends.

This was a great "core", filling appetizer for a recent cocktail party. I was making a bunch of different items so was trying to minimize day-of prep, so I prepped the crostini the day before, let it cool completely then placed in ziplocks--made things easier right before the party. It may have been a little better if I had made them immediately before, but not enough to make a huge difference. Would definately pre-prep again. I used flank steak insteak of London broil and tweaked the marinade to include some of my favorite marinade items. . . soy sauce and white wine. I also used store-bought horseradish sauce. This was a big hit! I might do half with blue cheese crumbles for those who don't like the zing of horseradish.

I really liked this. Instead of hors d'oeuvres, I made them for dinner for a change and I really loved it! The steak came out great, especially thinly sliced with the bread knife (great tip!) and still have a lot leftover for cold sandwiches tomorrow. Didn't have the fresh horseradish, so used bottled instead w/out the vinegar in the sauce, delicious!

This was a wonderful recipe. The marinade is perfect for steak. It gives it a lovely flavor with a bit of a bite. With the added Horseradish sauce it just gave it an all around robust flavor. They compliment each other perfectly. I would not change a thing. My husband and I both give it a 4 fork rating. It was a delish recipe that I will be making again.

absolutely fantastic! out of 30 dishes at an appetizer party, this one won best dish. Passed this recipe on to many people.
