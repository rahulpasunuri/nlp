Excellent all in all, though like others I doubt the necessity for a separate tomato sauce. If you do it that way, better to use white wine, and for God's sake don't add sugar- if your tomatoes are that bad this is not the dish to hide them in.

I made this recipe verbatim.... except I cut the recipe in half... exactly in half. There are only two of us. I used half a 3inch jalepeno. The freshness of the bell peppers and tomato's shown through the hot peppers to give a wonderful mix of pepper, sweet and savory..... the shrimp weren't half bad either. As far as Northerner is concerned this was pretty good Creole.. of course, the final judgement comes from those who live in the south... Perhaps next time I will add the Juniper Berries and cook it for 2 hours.. A different dish... but I am sure it will be every bit as good or better than this base. Jim

I followed the recipe carefully and found it too spicy for even my spice-loving husband. Next time I might salt the shrimp and cut back on the cayenne & peppers.

Recipe was over complicated. I enjoyed the finnished product very much. I had to up the spice slightly for my taste.

I grew up in south Louisiana. This recipe, in two stages, is more complicated than it needs to be. The ingredients are all the right ones, but we skipped the second stage and put it all in the pot at once, doubled all the spices and wine, added four juniper berrries (Grandma's touch) and cooked the sauce for two hours before adding the shrimp.

My husband enjoyed this dish. I found it hot after having cut back on the spices. I also used "Rogan Josh in place of cayenne, which added same hotness to the dish. The tomato sauce made quite alot. Will freeze and have 1st step completed for future use.

Fairly easy to make...lends itself to being spiced up (adding HEAT!) and very delicious!

I made this for 6 people, and we had enough left over for lunch for one person. So, the proprtions were pretty acurate. The seasonings were accurate as well, but I have to agree with the previous reviewer - the sauce portion could be cut in half. We will definitely mak ethis again!

Why make approx. 5 cups SAUCE when you only use 2 cups in the final mixture? Did I miss something?
