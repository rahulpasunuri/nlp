I have made this at least five times over the past few years. It is my favorite lamb shank recipe. I always get good reviews. Often two hours in the oven isn't quite enough and almost three is perfect.

I've made this recipe twice - once using the chicken broth called for and once substituting beef broth and red wine. I have to say I prefer the beef/wine combo. Absolutely delicious. It is perfect with polenta - thought I use a different polenta recipe from this site - with cream and parmigiano-reggiano cheese. Sooo good.

Excellent! Made it for Easter and my husband keeps asking for it again. The polenta was perfect with it. Had sauce left over which I froze and served last night with grilled lamb chops. Reminded me how good this was.

This lamb shank recipe is by far the best! I have make this many many times over the years and it is finger licking good..The peppercorns have always been as issue but I will take the suggestion of using cheesecloth. We are not polenta fans so I have always served this with garlic mashed pototoes. Amazing recipe....this freezes well if you need to prepare ahead of time.

Excellent dish. Tried it for the first time and all 12 guests raved about it; couldn't get enough. I added jsut one cinnamon stick to the herb sachet. It gave it another level of depth, but wouldn't add more than one. Can't wait to make it again!

This dish was great. I cut it down for two large lamb shanks and the only material changes I made were to salt and pepper the shanks before searing and the vegetables as they cooked, as well as add about a cup of wine (and boil it down) before I added the other liquids. Definitely an easy and delicious repeat recipe.

Really really wonderful. Know thine oven. I didn't want to increase the temp, but had to cook mine nearly 2.5 hours to get the falling-off-bone texture. I also used instant polenta, but cooked it on really low temp so it was still creamy. Added a little parm and, instead of mixing the thyme with the butter, sauted wild mushrooms with thyme separately, and then added to polenta at the very end. Went great with a side of beets and goat cheese! I went with the recommendations and used wine instead of chicken broth. I can't compare, but the wine was added a really nice additional flavor.

This was fantastic! I used just one leg of lamb for my husband and I and cut the rest of the recipe in half. It was so delicious and the polenta really set the dish off.

The lamb is really good and falling off the bone ... you need to add some salt to the sauce before you put the pot in the oven ... I couldn't have enough of the lamb!

I am an old experienced cook, 70 years of cooking lamb! This was a marvelous recipe. I followed it exactly, with the following changes: I added half a bottle of decent red wine to the chicken broth and used the fresh rosemary and thyme growing in my garden. I made a bundle with the peppercorns and put them all in cheesecloth. My shanks were fresh organically fed spring lamb.

I made this for my husband who is not a huge lover of lamb....he stuffed himself and the only request he had was to add less butter to the polenta....I made a half recipe and substituted half of the chicken broth with merlot wine....next time...no chicken broth..all wine... very good and extremely easy to fix.

This was great! My boyfriend said it was unbelievably awesome. I used 4 large lamb shanks for the two of us and can't wait to have the leftovers for dinner again tonight. I didn't have any cheesecloth, so I just put in some fresh ground pepper instead. Made half the amount of polenta but used all the thyme and added in a little parmesan cheese. 2 hours cooking time was perfect for the large shanks.

Yum! I made this for my husband and I, so I adjusted the recipe accordingly. The only thing I did differently, was to brown the lamb shanks in a very hot oven and deglaze the pan with red wine. Also, I added some mushrooms to the veggies. It was wonderful. The polenta is a must, it mingles so nicely with the sauce. I served it with a nice Pinot Noir and a radicchio salad with a pancetta and shallots . This is serious comfort food.

Awesome Awesome Awesome! I made this recipe as it is, one day ahead. Reheated slowly as not to overcook...It was excellent. All three guests claimed it was better than any restaurant lamb dish they'd ever had! Huge raving hit.

Just finished this dish and it was outstanding. My wife rated it 4 forks, but I thought 3 1/2. 4 forks must cause an addictive reaction. I had minor changes, used corn meal (very good), dried herbs (in cheese cloth) and stewed tomatoes. Only used 2 shanks, so I changed the proportions. Will make again, but maybe add some red wine with the broth.

Delicious ! The only thing I left out was the celery but other than that it was a hit. I served it with the polenta using a different receipe than the one suggested. Made it last week and doing it again this week. A good do-ahead dish to have up your sleeves. The only reason I did not give it four forks was because even though it was great it was not extra extra special.

This was a very good and easy recipe. One suggestion I would make is to tie the peppercorns up in cheesecloth for easy removal after cooking. Otherwise it was perfect!

This is a great recipe. I usually cook it for a good four hours so the lamb is fall off the bone tender. The peppercorns give it a nice zip. I haven't made another lamb dish since I tried this one about six months ago. It's just that good.

Brilliant! Easy... tasty...perfection in lamb!

Great and incredibly easy. My husband is the chef in my family and he cleaned his plate. Next time I'll add a gremolata to the lamb and add red wine just before reduction -as one reviewer recommended.

I made this dish twice in December-1st time for 12 (Book Club) and then New Year's Eve. It's easy and a great dish because you can start it in the afternoon, pop it in the oven and then clean up the kitchen and forget about it until it's time to serve. The 2nd time I made it I threw in a few pitted kalamatas and that was a nice addition. Several of my friends that said the didn't like lamb really liked this dish. It's a keeper for sure! Perfect "winter" dinner.

This was great and extremely easy. I left out the celery and cooked the shanks for 2 hours and they were falling off the bone perfectly. My family enjoyed it so much they jumped up and did the dishes!

I thought this recipe was excellent, as did my family. I did cook the meat for 3 1/2 hours and it was very tender. The sauce was delicious as was the polenta!

I wasn't overall crazy about this recipe. My husband loved the polenta, but I guess I'm not all that thrilled with lamb shanks to begin with. Needed a lot of salt too. Won't make again. JL

This is a tasty dish. I added some red wine at the end when I reduced the sauce.

Make this recipe the day ahead so that you can degrease it before serving. My husband doesn't like polenta so I served this over mashed potatoes and he loved it.

Shanks adapted very well to being made in a slow cooker.

This was a great dinner. In addition,I just served a green mixed leaf salad and the apple and cranberry crisps (recipe found in Oct. '03 Bon Appetit) for dessert. A dinner that was enjoyed by everyone present.
