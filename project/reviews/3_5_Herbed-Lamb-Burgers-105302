We thought these were fantastic, right down to the yogurt sauce. Not too minty, especially not with cumin on top. A great way to cook lamb.

Delicious!! Loved the Burgers-don't be afraid of the mint. Served with a lemon-garlic-yogurt dressing instead, along with tomatoes, cucumbers, and homemade hummus.

My boyfriend and I really liked these. For the sauce, I added chopped cucumber and chopped garlic. They tasted a lot like gyros. Yum!

I cut back on the mint (not my favorite herb) and thought this was delicious.

Really, really good, different, quick and easy. Don't know why other reviewer called it bland. Nice alternative to regular burgers and even the kids loved it.

These were very bland. Perhaps some garlic, salt and pepper wold bring out the flavor that should be there. The yogurt was tasty.
