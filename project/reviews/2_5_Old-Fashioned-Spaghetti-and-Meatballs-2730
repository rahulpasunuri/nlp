The best meatballs ever are in the Classic Spaghetti and Meatballs recipe, but made with 1/3 beef, 1/3 pork & 1/3 veal or lamb.

Never made meatballs before and these were a very easy and tasty introduction. Don't overwork the mixture, use your hands until *just* combined. Threw in about 2TB of finely minced onion, 1TB of minced garlic and a few shakes of red pepper flakes. I thought I may have browned them too much but they were very tender inside and the outside had a slightly crisp texture which I liked. Didn't use the marinara... Just canned crushed tomatoes with some garlic and onion left to simmer until I was done w/ the meatballs. Very good, will make again. Served w/ spinach salad and crusty grilled bread rubbed with garlic and olive oil

We liked this recipe, I added Romano Cheese instead of Parmesan. Probably added more garlic. I have picky eaters at my house but they all liked this dish. I also make it when we have friends over.

You can't get more basic than this and it was refreshing. The meatballs are easy to tweak to your liking. I added finely chopped onion, garlic powder and dijon mustard. A crusty loaf of brean and a green salad makes an easy, SIMPLE meal on a weeknight. Don't knock the simplicity.

Very simple recipe but pretty blah. Try it with bread crumbs instead of bread and a little lemon zest and parsley too. I also use half ground pork and half ground beef.

The meatballs weren't too good. I would strongly suggest using stale italian bread soaked in water instead of white bread. Also, I usually add pine nuts and bread the outside with flavored bread crumbs before frying.

I love this recipe! Because I am lactose intolerant I leave out the Parmasean cheese. I use Classico Fire Roasted Tomato & Garlic sauce with it which adds just enough flavor. Even my fussy eating son eats this dish and asks for second and third helpings of the meatballs!

used another red sauce, but the meatballs were pretty yummy. added bread crumbs instead of white bread.

Not bad, but bland to say the least. I improved on the sauce by adding chopped olives and chillies.

I thought the meatballs were pretty good, you could really taste the parmesan throughout. However, I personally liked the addition of some finely minced onion and garlic to the recipe(not too much)...this gave it just a little more pizaz.
