My family was not fond of this. Felt it "needed something". I thought it was too bland.

This was absolutely exquisite. Used a 2005 Erath from Oregon, which was very, very nice on its own. I made it into a sorbet with my ice-cream maker instead of a granita. I used the juice from the entire orange and lemon. Froze for several hours to firm it up, and served in a martini glass with a single curl of lemon zest. Will most certainly make this again.
