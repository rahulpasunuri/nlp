Outstanding! The combinations of flavors cannot be substituted. I used a french roast coffee, freshly ground, of course. Do not miss the barbeque sauce. All in all, a sensational burger.

This is our favorite recipe for grilled burgers. Great, interesting taste. I keep the dry rub handy for steaks, too.

Great spice rub, but really need to use good quality ground coffee and unrefined brown sugar. Use blue cheeze and avo for a bacon and blue cheeze variant (very nice). Additionally I add chilli caramelised onions (sugar added) which brings out some extra flavours.

Really great burger! I thought it sounded weird with the coffee rub and all, but after reading so many reviews and my wife being a coffee lover I had to give it a try. The wife said "This is the best burger you've made yet". So definitely will be making this again. I doubled up on the rub, used smoked gouda cheese and the sauce recommended on this site. I did not have time to carmalize the onions as other reviewers suggested, but am definitely going to try that next time.

Great rub. My boyfriend doesn't drink coffee and thought the rub sounded "weird" but now he asks for these burgers all the time. I have also used the on tri-tip and pork tenderloin and both were excellent. Typically, I use smoked gouda for the cheese which I think works great.

These were amazing! And that's coming from a former vegetarian. I did do a few tweaks...I used 1 lbs grass fed organic beef packed into 3 patties. I used the full amounts for the rub and made sure to give each side of each burger a good coating. I also took a yellow onion and carmelized it in the bacon drippings. Topped it off with some Sweet Baby Rays tangy BBQ sauce and it was so delicious. I did use some smoked mozzarella on two for the cheese lovers but found that I wouldn't have even noticied had I skipped that part. Overall, this is now my go-to burger recipe for years to come. Highly recommended.

Oh my gosh! This was absolutely delicious! This is the best burger I've ever made! Must curb enthusiasm...but really this was so awe inspiring and I'm not a huge burger fan. The coffee rub can be tweaked depending on the spices you have available. I didn't have freshly ground coffee so I had to use instant (blah) and I can only imagine what it is going to taste like when I get beans. I caramalized my onions as per other reviewers but this burger could stand alone without condiments and be great. Gonna try it with steak tonight.

Impressed that the recipe was so easy and tasted so good. Excellent rub and I wonder it will work as well on steaks which take longer to cook.

Amazing recipe for burgers! I made spice rub and used the chuck and sirloin mixture (not grass fed though). I was generous with the spice, as other reviewers suggested, and rubbed all of the spice on both sides of the burgers. I carmelized the onions. All of the guests loved them!

Delicious burger with a kick. The coffee in the rub also helps to combat food coma.

Absolutely delicious! Followed the recipe precisely except for the potato rolls and smoked cheese, which are just impossible to source in rural Ireland. Reminded us of home. YUM!

We all really enjoyed this burger but I expected more flavor. I think next time I will put the rub on both sides and see if it better meets my expectations.

MMMmmmm...I didn't mess with anything but the coffee rub, which sounds weird but is supertasty & not too sweet.

This is a great new way to have hamburgers! My family loved it. I did not have the potato bread buns but Texas size buns did very well. I also used Texas Pecan coffee and the flavor was fabulous! The bar b que sauce is perfect on this! The kids have already asked for it again!

A delicious way to jazz burgers up. For us the red onion is the key besides the bbq sauce.

Ive made this for so many people- everyone's always amazed. Many have requested the BBQ sauce recipe for other things. I HATE coffee but when grilled or seared on cast iron the crust comes out with a completely different flavor. Try some Jack Daniels or Vanilla flavored grounds for a twist. As mentioned, Gouda works really well and I think the raw red onion gives it a punch and crunch that really helps.

Got good reviews from the guests. I really enjoyed them. Kinda sweet which is really nice and different. Get a good smoked cheese, it is worth it!

this is the type of recipe where you can't help but to toot your own horn. seriously, this burger was amazing. it is in my top 5 for best burgers ever, restaurants included! the only thing i did differently was caramalize my onions as opposed to serving them raw. the flavor has so many depths, a definite must try!

Had this at our Cooking Club a couple weeks ago...incredible! I've made it twice since. Even those who never drink coffee LOVED these. I agree with a previous reviewer...feel free to load the burgers with the rub. Amazing flavors!

I'm a recipe-follower, so I made these burgers just as is, choosing smoked Gouda for the cheese. Paired with my own home-made buns, they were absolutely mah-velous!

I made this tonight with ground buffalo in place of the chuck & sirloin. Everyone raved about. Very easy, and very good.

Excellent, made as written except we sauted onions, which we think was a very good choice. The smokey bacon/cheese and the bbq sauce w/ this recipe are a MUST.

Rating: 4
Great rub -- it really transforms the burgers. I look forward to trying it on other things. I caramelized the onions, used sharp cheddar instead of smoked cheese, and just a dollop of bottled truffle barbecue sauce. Rave reviews.

I love this recipe. Don't be afraid to double the recipe and load the burgers with lots of rub. I've made this a few times now, next time i'll try mixing the rub in with the meat for a more intense flavor.

We do a coffee rub for steaks and expected this to be as good. We omitted the bacon and cheese for dietary restrictions, and followed the advice of the reviewer suggesting to just add the rub into the meat when mixing it. We also added one egg per pound of meat as a binder since the recipe doesn't call for any binder.

Normally coffee in this use is intended to add depth and complexity, not to taste like your morning cup-o-joe. I like the recipe as written.

Rating: 3
Everybody seems to love these, so I hate to say it, but they didn't do much for me. It's a good burger overall, but not much different from your average Texas burger. The smoked cheese is a nice touch, but it combines with everything else to completely overwhelm the rub. I figured 1 tbsp of coffee was too little, so I doubled it, and still couldn't taste more than the faintest hint of coffee. Again, it's a good burger, but nothing near as exotic as the name suggests.

Rating: 4
I made these burgers two ways: one with the rub as a rub; the other, mixing the rub in the meat itself, using the same amount per patty that was supposed to go on top. I found mixing it in to be more tasty, more flavourful. As a rub, it just got lost in the crusty outside, as we like them well done--yes, I know "Oh, the horror!" The barbeque sauce is a lovely starting point, though I think I would add less sugar next time for my husband's British palate.

These were Fantastic, I am not a fan of raw onion though so I carmelized them and put them on the burgers under the cheese on the grill. It was a very nice touch.

Delicious rub. So subtle. Husband loved so much, we had burgers 2 days in a row. Will be using on steaks.

Not what you might think. The coffee did not overpower the burgers, just added a subtle intriguing touch. Nice change of pace from traditional hamburgers. The cheese,bacon, onion & tomato slice make it a classy presentation.

I think there's a typo there. The last ingredients for burgers are 8 potato-bread hamburger. I think thy mean hamburger buns.

What a tasty burger! Made exactly as written. Can't wait to make it again with my friends grass fed home raised beef!

I made this over the holiday weekend for my boyfriend and some friends. I ground my own meat (chuck roast)and followed the recipe to the T. It was great. I do not generally like smoked cheese, but in this case it was great. BBQ sauce is very good. If you like this recipe, look up "cowboy steaks" on this site. Rub is made with coffee.It is REALLY good!

Excellent. I made these as sliders on Hawaiian bread for the 4th of July and used grilled onions tossed in balsamic vinegar as the topping. They were a hit and I loved them.

i was researching a salad on epicurious and this naughty recipe popped up. i ran out to the store & bought the ingrediants. it was the 4th of july and this was just perfect! gouda is a perfect choice-and i used UNsmoked cheese. i do not like smoked cheese & it melted like velveeta. i also used onion rolls instead, buttered with european butter & grilled. the rub is exceptional. i will use this dry rub on steaks & other food in the future. a serious hit & perfect flavors. lots of fun to make as well. i have always heard of coffee & beef, this was my first time sampling the flavors.

The best burgers down-right I have ever made. Followed recipe as printed and including the Texas BBQ sauce. The smoked gouda, applewood smoked bacon, bbq sauce... it's a mouthful of dancing flavors! Husband raved and he is a burger connaisseur. Well make again.

To A Cook: It is a taste thing a lot of Chefs use in Rubs for meat. Some rubs are strong enough to completely flavor the meat or vegetable by coating one side with it especially if it is a strong rub or has a lot of salt.. Steak is a good example. But it is a subjective technique and a matter of taste. When we use Cajun style rubs they are a bit salty and so we use them on one side of the meat and actually get two flavor ideas going from both sides of the meat as it grills or broils. Try it and see. Good cooking from the Poker Guys

Why would you put the spice mixture just on one side of the burger instead of mixing it in the meat?

Rating: 4
Outstanding!! Ground coffee is a great rub basic and this is a good example. If you have not tried this The Poker Guys recommend it as a change from other basic rubs.

Rating: 4
I was surprised at how delicious the coffee rub was! All the flavors mingle perfectly in all the ingredients and I think the smoked gouda is really a must. Husband was head over heels for the bbq sauce (we like it hot and added extra chipotle).

I haven't made this particular recipe yet (and I plan to), but I must take this opportunity to attest to the glorious properties of grass-fed beef that this recipe suggests. I didn't believe there could be such a difference in the quality of the meat based on what the cow ate or how it was raised, but I learned my lesson after buying grass-fed, pasture-raised beef from our local rancher. Now, it's all we buy (for a variety of reasons -- see/read "Food, Inc.") Let me paint you a picture: the beef is not injected with dye, yet is of a dark red, almost purple/mahogany color. When you open the package, it smells fresh, almost like herbs. The flavor is amazing, the texture practically melts in your mouth. There is no gristle or those funny little hard pieces often found in grocery store beef. Check out:www.localharvest.org to find a rancher near you. Not only will you be supporting the natural state of cows (they're not supposed to eat grain/corn), but you'll also be supporting your local economy. Happy eating! :-)

I do believe these were the best burgers we've ever eaten. I used organic, grass fed beef and smoked gouda. Family DEVOURED them. For the sauce, I used just a bit of chipotle hot sauce as we like flavor, not heat. Then I let the sauce sit on super low heat for an hour or two. Fantastic.

Made this for Father's Day. Outstanding! Great flavor. The rub really enhanced the flavor of the meat without overpowering it. The Texas BBQ sauce was sweet and smokey, and just delicious.

This is an excellent hamburger recipe! I did,however, make a couple of changes. First, I don't think any respectable Texan(or unrespectable one for that matter!)would ever make a quarter pound burger. The recipe calls for 2 lbs of meat to make 8 burgers. I made 6 out of 2 pounds of meat. I made them twice, both times on my Big Green Egg smoker, using sharp cheddar the second time. This worked well too. The Texas Barbecue Sauce recipe that accompanied this recipe in the magazine is amazing too, but it can be a bit spicy for the faint of heart!

Rating: 3
Made these burgers this weekend and they were a big hit. I left out the chipotle from the bbq sauce and supplemented with another 1/4 tsp of cayenne. The result was still spicy, but i think less spicy than having the pepper in there. Tried grilling them and frying them and they were delicious both ways.
