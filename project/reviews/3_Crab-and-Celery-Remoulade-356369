We just made this for Father's Day and we loved it. I do think this is a warm weather recipe. It is cool and refreshing. I did drain the crabmeat but I would have done that regardless. We made this recipe as described, and the only thing I added was a little salt. If my kids were not also eating it I would have added a few dashes of hot sauce to give it a kick. Otherwise it was a very nice, hot day treat.

One fix needed: skip the capers. Crab is way too delicate in flavor to make it go toe-to-toe with both capers and chives. Make sure you use regular, not garlic, chives. Add the barest pinch of white pepper and the barest pinch of sea salt. Then, this is delicious. And yes, make sure you drain the crab. Also, so folks don't have to wrestle with the crab, I have put this mixture in cucumber slices. That is, an English cucumber partially peeled, and cut crosswise in 1 inch pieces, hollowed on one side with a sharp melon baller. put an appropriate amount of the remoulade in the indention, sprinkle a few pieces of chives on top. Guests pop these pieces neatly into their mouths followed with mmmmmmm.

This recipe was extremely easy to make. I was a little disappointed with the taste, though. Reminded me of a fancy version of seafood salad.

When all ingredients were mixed together it was quite soupy so I strained the dip to remove the liquids. Also thought it was a little bland so I added s&p, a dash of cayenne pepper, and a dash of tabasco for a little kick - results were great, would definitely make a again.

This was very fast and simple to make and everyone liked it. I will drain the crab first next time as it was a little soupy for my taste.

I really liked this dish. Definitely let it chill for a couple hours to let the flavors come out. I served it with warm toasted pita and my guests really liked it.
