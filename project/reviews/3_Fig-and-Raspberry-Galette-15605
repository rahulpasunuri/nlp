i am going to be one of those people who rates a recipe eventhough I didn't make it the way it was written....But, I did make the crust as written and it was too dry and blah - there are better galette crusts out there. I made the filling with figs, plums, and blueberries - it was good. But there are better things to do with figs and tart fruits and berries work better in galettes.

The recipe was simple and the premise is good, I especially liked the crust. I used figs and raspberries and found the filling dry and unremarkable. Next time I'll try a different fruit combination.

This is a good recipe. I agree that many other fruits could be substituted. I am going to make it with plums and nectarines. The raspberries taste nice but arent very attractive when cooked

the perfect "rustic" dessert! the pastry is particularly good--simple and easy to handle with a satisfying crispness. i've also substituted different fruits for the figs and/or raspberries. friends and family prefer this dessert to a traditional pie!

I love this recipe. It's easy to prepare and quite delicious. I've been making this probably since 1998 when the recipe first appeared in print. It's a beautiful, rustic tart and the figs are "unsual" for most people, but every time I make this everyone raves!I have used both Brown Turkey Figs and Black Mission Figs, my personal favs. are the Black Mission. Sprinkle the raspberries with a little extra sugar before using if they aren't too sweet.
