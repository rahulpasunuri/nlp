This recipe is delicious. The only thing I did differently was add the dried mango and coconut at the same time I added the sugar and orange zest. My dried mango was quite hard and leathery and I wanted the liquid and heat of the rice and milk to soften it up. Also, after reading other reviews, I only added two tablespoons of sugar and the next time I make this recipe I will only add one (or even a little less).

Delicious!! In the interest of healthy eating, I cut the sugar down by half and it was still sweet enough. Would definitely make this again.

I used only 1/4 cup of sugar and unsweetened coconut and this was still way too sweet for breakfast! I liked the orange zest and coconut though, and would definitely try it again in a breakfast porridge.

I made this recipe a couple days back and plan on making more! It really is a tasty, creamy, guilt-free dessert. I used about half the amount of sugar, and instead of the dried mango and coconut topping, I mixed in some spiced pears and cranberries (I had filling left over from this recipe http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/foo d/views/Pear-Cranberry-Turnovers- 362951). I realize what I made is quite a deviation from the original recipe, and I'll re-review after making a truer version if I find it disappointing.

This is a nice change from regular oatmeal or cream of wheat for a hot breakfast, especially at this time of year. It has the added bonus of not being too high in calories! http://www.best5everything.com/best5ListPages/healthyfillingbreakfasts33125.php

This dish serves as a delightful start to the day (or as a midnight snack for that matter). It's even better without the sugar. Sweetened coconuts and mangos will do.

I know it is hard to find dried mango. As a little plug, we are now offering 7D Dried Mangoes through our e-store - www.sweetsweetmangos.com. 7D Brand really is the best I've tasted (as many others mention too!)

Better than the average breakfast. A twist on the average rice pudding. Not as good as the average dessert.

So creamy and good, and a great way to get whole grains. The orange zest makes the dish. As written, it's a little sweet for me, so I'll cut down on the sugar next time.

I make this as a treat for my boyfriend's kids all the time and they LOVE it! It doesn't take much to really sweeten the dish. Even though it is brown rice, it is surprisingly creamy and sweet! I highly recommend it!

Boring, bland and mushy. Not worth the time and effort. Needed a lot of cinnamon and nutmeg to make it even somewhat palatable. Make homemade oatmeal instead and save yourself the hassle.
