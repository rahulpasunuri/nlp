This is an easy + quick meal that will impress your guest. (We had unexpected guest arrive for dinner. Ingredients were pulled out of the refrigerator and the entire meal on the table in under 20 minutes.) I doubled the recipe and inadvertently used 2 cups of white wine instead of 1, even so, it was delicious and provided ample soupy sauce. Also replaced the medium tomatoes with a can of drained diced tomatoes & chilies. Served in antique soup plates, accompanied with crusty bread and a salad of mixed greens, olives, peppers, tomatoes, onions,(etc), with a fresh ginger dressing. Perfectly lovely!

This was superb. There was a mistake in the recipe. It said to stir in the tomato and remaining parsley, which I did and cooked for about another 30 sec to partially cook the tomato. It then said to use above as a garnish. This definately a keeper. I have even saved some of the leftover sauce in the hope it might taste just as great over breadcrumbed fish.

Somehow I expected the sauce to be somewhat thicker than it was. Next time I'd remove the mussels, keep them warm, and quickly reduce the sauce just a little bit. This is a very nice and different way to prepare mussels. It would have been a better dish if the mussels I bought had been larger. I think they were harvested way before their maturity. I plan to seek out a different and hopefully more trustworthy fishmonger than my local grocery store.

Husband (very critical regarding food) loved it! So did everyone else. Served with linguine and a splash of fresh lemon and it was light and flavorful. Says he was glad I insisted on trying it; now, it's a keeper.

This was delish!! I used 2lbs of mussels. I followed the recipe as called for with the exception of the advise of another cook to add more garlic and shallots. I used 3 cloves garlic, and 1 shallot. It was wonderful to the last drop. Make sure you have plenty of crusty bread to soak up the wonderful broth. I highly recommend trying this lovely dish.

Very nice but I prefer the complexity of flavors in the pernod-celery root-aioli combination.

Wow! I don't ever rate anything a 4 (beyond compare is a pretty high accolade), but this was one of the best dishes I've ever had, either from my own kitchen or anyone else's. Served with Whole Food's Pain Rustica and sopped the amazing broth shamelessly with it--absolutely fabulous. We doubled the amount of mussels and it still worked--don't be afraid to add more without doubling the sauce.

Unbelievable. This recipe was so delicious we were sopping up the sauce with bread. Takes any fishyness out of mussels. To die for!

Doubled recipe. Served 4 as a light main course with lots of fresh crusty french bread and a salad. Absolutely delicious!! Friends thought it was some of the best mussels they have ever tasted. A keeper!

This recipe is truly one of the best mussel dishes I've had. Now, I serve it as the main meal and I serve 3/4 lb per person and they always seem to want more. Serve with a fantastic Sauv. Blanc and you are set.

Very good! My fiancée drank the broth from his bowl and begged me to make it for him again! The only thing I can suggest is MORE GARLIC! Oh, and double the recipe... :-)

This was a fabulous recipe. Tastes great on pasta. Don't skimp on the lemon.

I would rate this recipe even higher if possible. I try new recipes all the time and have never found any as scrumptious as this one. It is perfect as is or wonderful with large shrimp added and used as a sauce for pasta. Make plenty of it and use some crusty rolls for mopping up the extra sauce. Then sit back and enjoy the compliments.

Excellent recipe and so easy! I added shrimp to it just at the end and served it with linguine as well. Have plenty of bread on hand as the sauce recipe makes quite alot.

This is as good as everyone claims. I squeezed some extra lemon juice in just before serving, and I think that added a little zing. I'd also warn to use ripe tomatoes (which we, unfortunately, did not). Served with grilled asparagus with saffron aioli, which made a delicious match. It also made me wonder if the mussels would have been even more delicious with a bit of saffron. . .

I served this for a casual summer evening on the deck with fresh bread to soak up the sauce and a salad. I also served shrimp cocktail and a Preston Marsanne. What a hit! A definite make again.

This mussel recipe is gorgeous. It was so subtle and and tomatoes add an unusually beautiful color to the otherwise creamy and pale sauce. The second day we heated the sauce up and served as a soup (first removing all mussels from their shells).

I made this great recipe as a first course for Easter, and it was fabulous! like everyone has said you need the bread to soak up the sauce. I will be making this again tonight for dinner with linguine.

A wonderful recipe, would definitely make again!

I made this with 4 lbs of mussels and served it over linguini for a lovely dish for three for dinner. THe crusty bread was an absolute must for soaking up the extra sauce. It went together very quickly once the ingredients were prepared, making it an excellent choice for entertaining.

I served this as first course for our French evening. Two bags of Mussels were sufficent for 8 guests. (Bags were 2-1/2 - 3 pounds) All 8 guests raved about the addition of the cream as a far superior way of preparing mussels vs. the standard of only wine/butter/etc. Several had seconds and everyone was dunking in the sauce. I used a large colander over a bowl to rapidly fill everyones plate. The Sauce was excellent. I used Mondavi's Sauvignon Blanc in the recipe and an additional bottle for the table. This was a perfect accompaniment. Light and refreshing without covering the delicate flavors of the mussels and that fabulous sauce.

Delicious! As good or better than any mussel dish I've eaten at a restaurant, and easy to make, too. My husband and I can't wait to have them again.

This was a delicious way to serve mussels. I cut the cream by half with no adverse effects. My house smelled like a French restaurant! Yummy!!!
