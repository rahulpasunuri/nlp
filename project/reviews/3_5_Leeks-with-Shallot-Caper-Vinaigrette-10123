This was even better than I thought it would be! I recommend either serving immediately instead of cooling the leeks, or taking them out of the cold water before they've chilled entirely.

Very nice dish excellent vinaigrette. Used the leftover vinaigrette over asparagus next night--even better!

A simply elegant side dish that is not the usual, same old same old. For that reason, it is nice for company. They were delicate in appearance and taste, very sweet and pleasant tasting. I steamed them gently for 8 to 10 minutes and didn't bother with the ice bath--served them immediately after draining well. I thought the vinaigrette would barely be enough b/c of the scant proportions of ingredients, but it was just perfect. I have other vinaigrettes I like with other veggies (asparagus, brussels sprouts, etc.), but this one had a lot of interesting eye appeal as well as taste.

This is delicious. I added a bit more olive oil and more capers because the shallot taste was a little overwhelming. Wanting something more on the plate than just leeks, I tried it with asparagus. I didn't like the vinaigrette with the asparagus. So I decided on leeks and tomatoes, and the taste was excellent and the presentation was very nice.

Delicious. Made this for guests and everyone really enjoyed it. The sauce was a little oily so added more vinegar and also a little rock salt. Left over vinaigrette was used the next day and the flavours had intensified. I'd make the vinaigrette the day before next time.

Great recipe. The dressing is good on a variety of salad foods but is best made with red wine vinegar rather than Sherry vinegar. Also, I serve the leeks or whatever I'm using on a bed of greens.

Very delicious and easy to make. It was a hit and I would make it again. I also added asparagus to this dish and it was a terrific combination and looked quite beautiful on the plate. The vinaigrette is first rate and could be used on a variety of vegetables. I served it before Shrimp Creole and it was a great combination.

I tried this just because I had the leeks on hand, and I am so glad! This is excellent! The leeks are almost sweet when they are cooked, and the vinaigrette is perfect! Bonus - so elegant looking. A great first course for company that you can make ahead! Watch the leeks when they're cooking, though......5 minutes is almost too long.

Enjoyed it more than I thought I would. The vinaigrette was wonderful, expecially with a fine olive oil such as Laudemio that I used. I added a few steamed clams (without the shell) to each plate. That was an wonderful enhancement.

I steamed the leeks instead of Saute....and prepared it a day in advance. It was delicious served cold.

I multiplied this to serve about 8 people as a salad first course. I also simplified the recipe by slicing the leeks into circles and placing them in a shallow glass dish with a little water and steaming them in the microwave for about 3 minutes until crisp-tender. Run under cold water to stop the cooking, drain well, then plate the leeks and drizzle with the vinaigrette. I got rave reviews!
