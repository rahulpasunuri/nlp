While the flavors were very nice, I needed much more than 1/2 cup of liquid for 12 cups of bread cubes. Even after I added a bit more it was still dry and didn't hold together well.

Everyone loved this! I did not add the fruit since I had a regular bread stuffing with fruit. I used almost 2 cans of chicken broth and added 2 eggs for extra moisture and flavor since I cooked it in a casserole dish, covered for 1/2 hour and uncovered for 1/2 hour. It was a great addition to the table since most Thanksgiving dishes have little spiciness. I will definitely make this again!

Oh, the house smelled wonderful while this was cooking! I used cranberries instead of cherries and combined the chirizo with the onion/celery mixture before stirring into the cornbread. I was a bit short on chirizo but there was plenty of flavor since I cooked the onion and celery in the chirizo pan after pouring off the excess fat. I baked it outside the bird and will use more broth next time; it was a bit dry. Will definitely make it again.

Definitely worth preparing for my Thanksgiving turkey. Will be making again!

So good! I have made this dish at least 3 times, each time it was great. One guest that ate it doesn't like dressing but loves this. We did not cook in a turkey (we fry our turkey with a creole butter injector-also yummy) and made it as a casserole with chorizo. We have used a variety of dried fruit and all have worked well.

Very good, but I liked it better when cooked outside the bird. Choose your chorizo carefully!

This was a hit, with some minor modifications ... thanks to those who gave recommendations previously ... I also substituted dried cranberries for the cherries, reduced the apricots to 1/2 curp and added one peeled, diced Granny Smith apple. Used 1+1/2 packages of Pepperidge Farm cornbread stuffing. Used 1+1/2 cups chicken stock. The stuffing that was in the bird was moist, the stuffing that was simply baked by itself was a little dry. Next time I am going to add more broth to the excess stuffing that does not go in the turkey before baking it. Very tasty, and nice sweet/savory contrast between the onions and celery and the fruits!

This dish - with a few adjustments - is absolutely fabulous. I've made it twice, once with andouille and once with chorizo, and the chorizo was way way better. Also, i thought it was too sweet the first time I made it, so I cut the apricots. Instead, I used more cherries and some tart granny smith apples. It was perfect. Also, it leaves the amount of liquid up to you - I really recommend using A LOT. I think I used multiple boxes of chicken stock. I didn't get it right until I added so much liquid that I thought I went overboard, and when it came out of the oven, it was at last perfect. Finally, and most importantly, the baking time is off - it took an hour to heat all the way through in the oven. This caused a miniature crisis at thanksgiving. Make sure you give yourself enough time, if it's done early, it's easy to keep warm. Practice this dish - once you nail it, it's awesome.

This worked very well as a vegetarian dish when made with vegetable broth, Boca Italian sausage, and baked in a separate pan.

This is now my FAVORITE stuffing recipe! Exquisite flavors, interesting, and not difficult to make.

Despite not being a cornbread fan in the first place, I really enjoyed the stuffing. I was looking for a nice, semi-sweet stuffing for some pork loins. This worked extremely well and my husband asked for it again soon! The apricots were a little overpowering, but still a neat touch. I'll keep the recipe around for awhile.

This was a great stuffing recipe! I used two cornbread loafs from Trader Joe's, and a Turkey Sausage from Henry's. Cranberries instead of cherries worked well to cut the sweetness, as other reviewers have said. I also used about double the chicken broth to make it nice and moist, as I cooked the whole thing outside the turkey. Absolutely delicious!

I would make this stuffing once a week if I could! This is one of the best dishes I have ever made, and I get requests to make it for nearly every occassion that comes up in my family throughout the year. I honestly hate giving it away though, because it's just too good!

Based on the reviews I was hesitant - but WOW! - this was great stuffing. I made it for Thanksgiving with the maple glazed turkey and evryone raved about it. I also used cranberries instead of cherries, and half regular cornbread/half jalapeno cornbread from the market. Other than that - followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful. Not too sweet or greasy. I did drain the sausage in a collander while I put the rest of the ingrediants together. Stuffed it in the bird and also had enough to bake a large pan - so everyone was happy. Give this one a try!

Wow! This was absolutely fantastic! I didn't have time to make the cornbread, so substituted corn muffins I found at the bakery. They may have made the stuffing a little sweeter, but substituted dried cranberries for the dried cherries to try to even out the sweets. Also, we used a sundried tomato and chicken sausage we had in the freezer since we were forwarned about grease. These sausages have very little grease and went wonderfully with this stuffing. I'm planning on making this again for next Thanksgiving!

The maple-ginger turkey was incredible, but this stuffing was a disappointment. Made homemade cornbread and used andouille sausage, otherwise followed the recipe to a T. I didn't like the grainy cornbread texture, and the apricots & cherries retained little of their flavor after roasting in the bird for 4 hours.

We this for Canadian Thanksgiving - everyone loved it! Used dried cranberries instead of cherries, worked well. Used 2 whole cans of chicken stock to keep the stuffing moist as we did not stuff it into the bird. Well worth the effort of making home made cornbread to add! Delicious!

I got raves from guests with this - I used andouille sausage.

I was skeptical of the chorizo for my otherwise traditional palette for Thanksgiving. But it was incredibly tasty! I actually loved the chorizo punch and the fruit was a nice touch too. Definitley would make it again!

The turkey and glaze that go with this stuffing are delicious, but the stuffing itself is not very good. One and a half pounds of chorizo makes for way to much meat in a stuffing--even though we drained the chorizo as thoroughly as we good, the stuffing was still sodden with grease. Additionally, we were hoping that the chorizo stuffing would be a spicy counterpoint to the sweet flavors in the turkey and glaze, but instead, the stuffing was just more sweet, which those at our house didn't care for. No one took seconds of the stuffing, and the leftovers were thrown out uneaten.
