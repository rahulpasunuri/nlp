I wonder if the problem is the cocoa? He is almost certainly using dutch process cocoa, which bakes up very differently from natural (i.e. the ubiquitous Hershey can). Hershey makes both but often only the traditional Americana natural cocoa is available at the supermarket. Even TJs only carries natural. This is a shame because dutch process is so much better to bake with. As a result, it tends to be what cookbook authors are using for recipes. When you substitute natural for dutch process, you have to change the quantity and it changes the texture too, because natural cocoa is significantly more acidic. I'm going to try Cost Plus to see if I can find dutch process cocoa in their food section, as 3 California supermarkets to date didn't have any (they used to!).

AS IS deserves 2, AS I MODIFIED IT imo 4. Maybe he's one of those chefs who can't measure or so. I doubled but used only 1 full cup cocoa - IOW 2/3 of the recommended amount. Used SALTED butter - shortbread without any salt? - and will admit, heresy, to having to sub a few tablespoons of margarine for the same amount of butter because I had not quite enough butter on hand. And they were delish without filling! Bit crumbly and hard to work with, but very good, just enough cocoa, sweet, buttery and salty balance. DID NOT MAKE FILLING - just cut-outs, could decorate with a dusting of icing sugar.

A **TON** of work & they were just awful! I brought them to an Oscar party, they looked great but tasted just **HORRIBLE**. Wolfgang should have tried to make them before he put these on his Oscar menu. Lesson learned - don't try a new recipe for the first time with guest. **VERY** disappointing!

I made this recipe for an Oscar Party. I modified the recipe by using Hershy's special dark cocoa and not putting the frosting on. Everyone at the party loved them! They are a bit delicate so I suggest using a round or square cutter instead of a star.

These cookies came out looking pretty with alot of fuss but they tasted a little too bitter. Would not bother making them again.
