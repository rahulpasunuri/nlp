Really thick with way too many ingredients having their flavors die in the heavy cream base. This was the epicurean equivalent of the La Brea tarpit...about as tasty too. One star is being generous.

Roasting the corn adds so much to the flavor of this chowder. Did not use the maple syrup, and reserved some crab to spinkle on top, along with a little smoked paprika. Delicious!

Very labor-intensive, quite heavy, a bit too much bacon, and the price of the fresh crab alone made me wish we went to fisherman's warf instead...

This is such a retro, overly rich, flour thickened soup. If I ever make it again it will be with these changes: Halve the amounts of bacon and corn and use less onion. Instead of 4 cups whole milk, use 2 cups good vegetable stock with 2 cups 2% milk and a bottle of clam juice. Use Half and Half instead of heavy cream and use parsley instead of basil. Double the amount of thyme. I added the thyme with the vegetables, not later as indicated. Finish with a little dry sherry. I saved the large lumps of crab meat, sauteed them briefly in butter and used as a garnish in each bowl. The whole soup would benefit from prepping the day before and adding the crab after re-heating the soup the second day.

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner and it was AWFUL. I followed the recipe and have been using this website for many years.

Even though the end- result was tasty I found this recipe to be way off. Took longer to cook to get the potatoes to their tender point, and was also way too thick. I ended up adding quite a bit of white wine and stock towards the end to thin it out. It was good but not sure it was worth the labor- instensive prep!

Labor intensive, quite rich though bland. Add some cayenne to taste at the finish.

This was delicious. I used pancetta instead of bacon, because that's what I had on hand. I also halved the recipe, and it was plenty for 6. When reheating, I added some 2% milk, so it wouldn't be too thick, and it worked great. I will definitely make this again.

I did not make this recipe, so I can't say how difficult or easy it was to make. I do know that it was really delicious and I will be making it in the future.

I used frozen corn kernels and toasted them in the oven on 350 for about ten minutes. Aside from that I didn't stray from the recipe. I served it in toasted sourdough bread bowls for my sisters, and they loved it. This does not keep well for leftovers, so unless you're serving ten, cut the recipe in half.
