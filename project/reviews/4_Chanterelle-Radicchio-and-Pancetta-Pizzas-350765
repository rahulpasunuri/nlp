Picked the chanterelles this afternoon around Mt. Hood. We used pizza dough from our local pizzeria, Hot Lips in Portland, used thyme & lemon juice when sauting the chanterelles. We added Italian sausage and yellow/red bell peppers. Couldn't have done without the thyme, I thought that added the best flavor! Delicious.

Have been searching out recipes for chanterelle pizza and I'm puzzled at the "store-bought" dough in most of the ingredients lists. If you have a Kitchenaid mixer you're five minutes away from having four pounds of dough that will keep in the refrigerator for two weeks. Dissolve 1.5 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon yeast in 1.5 cup warm water in Kitchenaid mixing bowl. Add four cups flour (I like good hard red winter wheat flours, like Gold Medal Artisan or Arrowhead Mills). Mix on lowest mixer setting with dough hook until dough ball forms, then continue to kneed two more minutes. Cover and allow to rise several hours. Store in large Ziplock bag in refrigerator.

Amazing. Followed recipe to a T. Also made it once with red cabbage when the radicchio looked a little suspect, and that also turned out fantastically. So good!!!!

An exceptional combination of flavors in a non- traditional pizza! Don't shortcut on any of the ingredients because you will miss out on some fantastic flavors. We use Naan brand flatbread for our pizza crust to speed things up and it is always easy and terrific if you like a crispy thin crust pizza. This was a real hit for our Friday night pizza crowd and I am sure it will become a regular request!
