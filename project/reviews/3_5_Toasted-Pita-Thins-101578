These are wonderful when prepared as directed! I used coarse sea salt as a seasoning. These are great! We love them when served with homemade humas!

I've been making this for years. We eat them as snacks with hummus - better than chips! I season mine with either salt, black pepper, garlic or cayenne; each trip to the hummus bowl tastes different! Certainly worth the (little) time required to make.

These are so good with hummus - much better than plain pitas. I use an olive oil spritzer in order to use less oil and sprinkle with adobo seasoning (a mixture of finely ground salt, pepper, and garlic powder found in Latin American markets). Also I cook the rounds whole, then when they're out of the oven, break each round into several large pieces. I prefer the rustic look of this to the strips.

We have been making this for years. Butter is good instead of olive oil for flavor, and we have sprinkled with minced garlic (MMM) and/or parmesan cheese for variations. Both of these variations are fantastic -- TRY IT.

Just don't burn them...cook in the middle of the oven for 5 minutes or so. Great with the Hummus recipe.

I'm giving these 4 forks because of taste, versatility and ease. Served with the white bean and sun dried tomato dip. One of my guests remarked that they were better than potato chips for dipping and I would have to agree. An easier way to cut the pitas in my opinion is to start with a whole pita, make 8 wedges with a knife or pizza cutter and then split the wedges by hand. Then place on a baking sheet, brush with oil and season as desired. I like to use coarse salt and I like the previous reviewer's idea about cumin

Much cheaper than buying pita crisps in a bag! And you can adjust the seasoning to your liking. I add just a touch of salt, and sometimes paprika or ground cumin, depending on what I'm serving with them. Also, forget the scissors. A pizza cutter works much quicker - just roll across to cut in 6 or 8 triangles.

I was shocked how good these are. Will definitely makes these again. Fast, easy and so much better than store bought.

It's definitely easier to split these if you cut them in half first. I added salt and pepper and garlic powder to mine and had them with pesto. Much crispier than a regular cracker and healthier than tortilla chips.

I've made these several times. Always a hit at the party. I, however, don't split the pita bread. I just cut it in triangles and put oil on them and bake. Makes it quick and easy.

Very good and easy. Also recommend sprinkling with some Zatar seasoning, available from Penzeys.com and other good spice merchants. Use olive oil sprayer to save a little time.

This was a good accompaniment to homemade hummus. Mine were done after 6 minutes in the oven - any longer and they would have burned on the edges. Also, I sprinkled a little salt & pepper on them before baking, and that added a little extra flavor.
