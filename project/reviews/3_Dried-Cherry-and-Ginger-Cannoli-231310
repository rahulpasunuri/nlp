Too much--flavor, money, time--just too much. That said, I gave it 2 stars b/c with 2 cups of the left over filling I added 12oz cream cheese, 4 eggs, dash vanilla; followed random water bath recipe with chocolate graham cracker crust and came out with a delicious cheesecake.

inspired by the reviewer that ate this right out of the bowl, I brought the filling with some waffle cone pieces (and I've used sugar cones with good results too) as a dip to more than one party. HUGE hit. absolutely delicious. Caught my husband sneaking home the leftovers and eating it by himself during a hockey game.

A long run for a short slide.

Subbed dried blueberries for the cherries and they worked fine. This filling was outstanding. I ate a good deal of it straight out of the bowl with a spoon. It was very easy to make and mighty tasty.

I've made this twice. It's easy and the best cannoli I've ever had. Great blend of flavors. It alwasys wows my guests!

I have made this twice now and received kudos both times. I doubled the mascarpone the second time and had much better results. This is quite possibly the easiest and quickest dessert I have ever made.

I have never had a cannoli before this recipe so I wasn't sure what to expect. A week later I was eating at Sal's which is an Italian place, and ordered their cannoli, to my suprise this recipe had more flavor. My only suggestion is try to find the fresh ricotta, it's worth it.
