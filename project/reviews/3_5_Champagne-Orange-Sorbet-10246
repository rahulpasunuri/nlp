I love this recipe. Have made it for sorbet course on Thanksgiving. I use blood oranges. I have not found the orange flower water, but hope to have it for next time I make this recipe.

Where does the egg come in? Poorly written.

Entirely too sweet and not enough orange flavor. I'd cut the syrup to 1/2 and add more orange juice, and perhaps some zest. It needs a little tartness.
