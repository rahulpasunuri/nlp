I made the fruit fool, it's easy and delicious.

These turned out pretty good- the second time I made them. The first time they came out gooey and sticky (should've left them in the oven a bit longer). The second time, I put them in for about an hour and 15 min, and they were just right- airy, crisp and light!

I didnt make the fool but I used the meringue recipe. It is MILES too salty. The meringues were inedible. I had to throw them away and start again. The second time I made them I used only 1/8 tsp salt and they were delicious. Now I have to find a use for 16 egg yolks!

Yum! Yum! Yum! I am 11 years old and love passion fruit and meringues! I changed it from passion fruit to pineapple, coconut, mango, guava, and a bunch of other stuff. I am going to have this dish at my 12th birthday on June 3rd, and all of my friends will love it!

This recipe is wonderful! I can't get passion fruit pulp in my local grocery, so I substitute strawberries and increase the amount a little for more flavor. I've made it several times and it's always a hit.

I made the kisses (without the fool) and they turned out very well. I sprinked sweetened coconut over them before baking which added a nice flavour.
