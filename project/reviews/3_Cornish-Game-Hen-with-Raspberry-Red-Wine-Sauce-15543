The recipe, as written, does not develop much complexity of flavor. I added a bay leaf, a little rubbed sage, balsamic vinegar and red raspberry preserves, allowed it to reduce and was quite happy with the results. I did not need to thicken the sauce. Wonderful served on a bed of wild rice.

Great meal!

My dinner party guests loved this recipe and it was easy to make. A thickener is not needed...you just need to give it time to boil down and it will thicken on its own.

I can not say enough great things about this recipe. Been making it for years. Have never felt need to deviate from recipe, as written. I have made sauce on cornish hens, chicken and turkey. It is sweet, and I love sweet. Try this!

I made this dish and everyone loved it! However, I did not strain the sauce, but left the raspberries in it! I would do it the same way next time.

I added cornstarch as recommended, and switched the sugar for honey, but otherwise made it just as described. Amazing! A really subtle complex flavor to the sauce. I doubled the recipe, and that resulted in the sauce taking a LONG time to thicken, but it was absolutely worth it.

I made this exactly according to the recipe, and I have to disagree with having to add thickener. I used a deep, straight-sided 10-inch non-stick skillet and kept the sauce at a steady boil. It thickened easily to where it coated a spoon. Maybe that's the problem; different people have different ideas on how thick something needs to be to coat a spoon. To me and my wife, we thought it was a very good recipe, and she does not usually like cooked fruit or "sweet" sauces--although this is not very sweet because of the wine.

Ah, yes thickening is needed for the sauce, although I made it without, and it was still quite good, albeit thin. I thought the flavor was great, and the hens delicious. I served it with green beans w/ lemon butter and garam-masala coated pan-fried plantains. A nice meal for two.

I haven't made this particular recipe but a similar one. The birds are rubbed with a combination of raspberry puree and heather. Then you make the raspberry sauce to go with. Tuck some fresh heather sprigs around the finished birds and they are so beautiful. Tasty too!

I thought this was easy and tasted delicious. I will definitely make it again. I added cornstarch to thicken and it took longer than 12 minutes.

This recipe is a bit incomplete. If you search 'onion compote', a recipe for cornish game hens with sweet onion compote will come out as a result. That recipe will guide you, except using these ingredients. First, cook the cornish game hens at 400 degrees after browning, then use the butter/flour mixture to thicken the sauce and this recipe will taste really nice.

The scauce was absolutly terrible, perhaps I made it wrong, although it's not hard to follow instructions. However I loved the method of preparing the hen.

i found the sauce to be nothing terribly special, but really liked the technique for cooking the game hen, actually cooked a chicken this way last night, just made a pan reduction sauce with the drippings in the pan and chicken broth. will definately use the technique again, tho i think that i may try another sauce.

Sauce was wonderful! The sauce did not thicken on its own so I used a little corn starch and water to thicken. Instead of sugar I used honey which worked extremely well. Definitely will make again.

Delicious! The combination of wine and raspberries gave the meat a sweet, yet sophisticated taste. I prepared this for Thanksgiving.....perhaps not traditional, but my family loved it. I've also used this sauce with duck. The color of the roasted bird is just lovely! Try this, it is wonderful!

This was a delicious easy recipe and was a big hit. Great with the Wild Rice with Roasted Pecans. The sauce could be thicker. I served the leftover on the side for dipping.

Well, i am an executive chef for a large entertainment complex in NC. I tried this in our goumet restaurant. We had good comments from our guests, i did thicken the sauce with some roux.Came out very well

The sauce needs work. It lacked raspberry flavor. I added more rasberries, wine and sugar. This helped quite a bit. My guests did enjoy the meal and I will make it again with the changes.

Well, I hate to say it, but this is the first recipe (and I've tried many) off this website that I was truly disappointed in. I boiled the sauce for about 30 min to get it a bit thicker - but the taste was yucky. I tried adding more sugar - that didn't seem to help either.

Well, the hen was good but to quote my husband, the sauce tasted like "watered down barbeque sauce." After 25 minutes of boiling, it never thickened past water consistency. I added some butter but it didn't help.

This really impressed the in-laws, served over wild rice! Will definitely make this one again for a special occasion, but will only make 1/2 the sauce that the recipe calls for.

The hen was good but why does one need 3 or more cups of liquid to get a bit of sauce. I boiled for more than 12 minutes and still had soup. This needs to be redesigned.

Wonderful dish, but I had to cook it about 30 min. instead of 20. I cooked this for a party of 40 and my children also loved it.

What a great dinner this was. Everyone raved. I doubled the recipe and served the sauce on the side in a small serving dish for each person and everyone wound up dipping their vegetables in it as well as the cornish hens. Thanks for a great recipe.
