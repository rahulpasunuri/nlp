Made these for Valentine's Day and they were a hit with my husband and teenaged sons. I only had semisweet chocolate chips on hand, so probably should have reduced the sugar even more. Only used 2 cups, but could have used less. I baked them on parchment, without anything additional and it worked quite well. I used a small scoop that I got from Pampered Chef that worked well for forming the balls. And I agree with the reviewer who said that these are not healthy cookies, despite the lack of butter and flour. They still have lots of sugar. But they would be great for someone needing a flourless dessert. With my scoop I produced 30 cookies. I will definitely make these again, but will use less sugar.

Excellent cookies. Two variations - 1. used white chocolate chips instead of bittersweet for the final mix-in. 2. Cut the rolling sugar in half and whisked in some cocoa to give the cookies a truffle look. Agree on using paper insted of greasing sheets, they came off quickly and cleanup was reduced.

PS epicurious, just because something does not have butter in it does not make it "healthy". These are not even remotely healthy. delicious but not healthy.

waaaay too much sugar. I would probably reduce it by half (1 cup in the recipe + some for the outside). Great idea and texture though. Yish though, too too sugary.

These cookies are a chocolate lovers dream come true. Yes, the dough is messy, but the outcome is definitely worth the effort. I did reduce the sugar to 2 cups - and next time I might reduce it a little more. I used 72% dark chocolate. Definitely a keeper.

I have done other chocolate cookies but this one really won me kudos with my guy. I reduced the sugar to 1 cup and used the parchment paper with margarine spread over as suggested and it works well. As well, by reducing the sugar, I had no problem with the batter, it was soft and easy to use with two spoons. I cooked a bit longer because of sugar reduction to 12 minutes. Fantastic......

I have made these luscious cookies, following the recipe as written, several times with no problem. It does take some time to roll them, but it's worth it. They taste far more sinful than the ingredients would lead you to believe. My husband, who likes his desserts rich, loves them. I would give them five forks if I could!

These cookies are heavenly. They are exactly what I love in a chocolate cookie. Dense and chewy and wonderful. My only problem was that they stuck to my pan even though I greased it really well. Parchment paper next time.

These cookies are delicious, with a wonderful texture. As others have mentioned, I found the dough incredibly sticky and hard to work with, so I dropped spoonfuls onto the pan. However as the dough sat on the pan it firmed up and became workable. Next time I'll let the dough sit for a few minutes in the bowl before trying to roll it into balls.

Great addition to any repitoire; especially a gluten free one. Very, very good as all who indulged agreed. Use of good quality cocoa & chocolate were evident in the final product. The only things I'll do differently in the future are to: 1) put on gloves before rolling these and 2) not assume cracked tops mean the cookies are done. Baked @ 375 in a (calibrated) convection oven 12 minutes & was surprised to find undercooked bottoms. They took about 16 minutes. The undercooked ones went too though!

OMG. I usually only do really indulgent treats but my daughter got on to a "health" kick, so I came across this recipe. Incredible as is; used the half & half milk & bittersweet choc suggestion as well as the vanilla - thought the cinnamon might be a bit overwhelming. The crunch of the pwdrd sugar coating really made it special. Made the batch this evening and only got 1 bite of 1!

Can't believe these worked perfectly at altitude with only a slight reduction in sugar - maybe 1-2 T. less. Just delicious and will be a great treat for the gluten-free guests. Only downside is that they're a mess to make - but worth it.

Wonderful recipe! We made a double batch...scooped out 15 plain with a small scoop, then added 1/2 teas cinnamon & chipotle powder, scooped out 15 more, then added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts and dried cherries and scooped out 20 more. Baked at 350 for 10-12 minutes. Our freezer is now well stocked with quick treats.

My 15 year old daughter Elke made these and came up short on reg choc chips. She used a combo of raspberry choc chips & bittersweet. Whoa. This is an amazing cookie, thin & crisp outside layer, densely chewy on the inside. The little bit of raspberry was a nice addition. Also, they are beautiful. They have a black & white cracked finish.

All my friends are on diets so I made these as Valentines treats. They loved them. I added toasted almonds, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon instant coffee granules. I liked the crunch of the ones I rolled in sugar before baking. Intensely chocolate.

These cookies are amazing and I changed the recipe only slightly and they came out amazing. I used milk chocolate chips instead of the bittersweet. The milk chocolate chips made it taste like a chewy hershey's cookie. Also, I checked out the reviews beforehand and made a half batch with the powdered sugar and half without. I prefer the powdered sugar; they look nice, taste amazing, and added extra sweetness to it. Also, they cook for longer than 10 minutes, but burn quickly after 10 minutes; so be careful. I will definitely make these cookies again!!!

The first time i made this it was WAY too sweet. I cut the sugar by nearly 1 full cup- didn't roll them in sugar and subtracted 1/2 cup from the batter, using bittersweet chocolate chips. oh, i also melted all of the chocolate. perfect taste and texture. could not stop eating these!

As is a habbit, I changed the recipe before cooking - I switched to dark chocolate, and added 1/3 cup of fresh jalapenos (finely chopped). I also didn't roll powdered sugar afterwards, and I reduced the temparature to 375, as I saw another commenter suggest. The cookies turned out great. Just a hint of spice, which the sweetness easily holds. My family loved them! Definitely something I will make again.

I always used to spend Friday nights angry I didn't have my chocolate fix. I never had enough time to put anything together. But now...let nothing hold me back. These are so easy and quick to mix up it's ridiculous and they are everything I love in cookies; dense, rich, soft, and chewy. I think I burned the bittersweet chips because they didn't melt smooth and even though there was the occasional crunch of hard sugar in the cookies they still tasted every bit chocolatey. I don't think I messed up too much in that respect. I also took the advice of some reviews and added about 3/4 tsp. of cinnamon. Wow, it's amazing what a difference that tiny kick makes. Perfect recipe for my cravings.

I am not a very good or experienced baker, but even so I didn't have any trouble with the batter and they turned out very well. They are rich and dark and chocolatey, perfect for chocaholics like me. My only complaint is that the powdered sugar coating crystallized and had an odd crunchy taste, so next time I won't coat them in it. But other than that, a great recipe!

I made these for a girl cousins' weekend at the cottage, and for a serious chocoholic friend. Everyone loved them. I followed the recipe exactly but used 1/2 cup of egg whites (equiv of 4 egg whites) out of the carton (not by breaking four eggs), and added a pinch of hot cayenne pepper and 1/4 tsp of cinammon. Baked on non-stick cookie sheet sprayed with canola oil. And yes, there is no reason why these wouldn't be kosher for Passover

I have friend who is celiac (allergic to gluten). These cookies are the best gluten-free cookies I've found (and one of the best cookies, gluten-free or not). I usually add 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper; I like the extra heat.

Rating: 4
these are the most raved-about thing i've ever made. i also change the recipe somewhat, often adding as much as 50% more melted chocolate than specified, plus adding raspberries, almonds, cinnamon, and sometimes cayenne at the end. i usually skip almost all of the sugar, especially the bit at the end, and i think that's why people love them--they're kind of like a baked truffle, just lovely chocolate flavour. i don't bother chilling the dough, scoop them out like truffles (with two spoons), form them into balls with my hands, and bake them on greased cookie sheets, and i've never had a problem with them sticking--perhaps because i don't let them cool, i just take them right off the sheets moments after they're done. that's how they should be served--they're AMAZING warm, with a glass of red wine.

These cookies turned out to be exactly what they say they are--deep, dark, and chocolaty. If that's not what you are looking for then don't make them! Here are a few suggestions if you do: definitely use parchment paper for the easiest clean-up and baking; the addition of cinnamon and/or cayenne is fine but the quality of the chocolate you use is more important (including the cocoa powder); if you're using the bittersweet chocolate that the recipe calls for then you'll certainly want to use the amount of sugar called for; let the batter sit for 10-20 minutes before working with it. I used 2 spoons to scoop out cookie- sized mounds onto the parchment paper. Then, I went back and rolled the mounds and tossed them in the sugar. This method worked great because you don't have to handle the dough as much and you give it a bit more time to set. I think rolling in the sugar is a must for appearance and for taste (it adds that extra bit of sweetness when you bite into the cookies). The 10 minutes baking time was perfect for me--check your oven temperatures with a thermometer to make sure your oven is heating properly. Overall, I would most definitely recommend these to my friends!

Rating: 3
Meh. Just okay. These cookies were very deep and rich, but they lacked dimension. I tried with the cinnamon and cayenne, and it still was a bit flat. It's important to note that I didn't have bittersweet chocolate on hand, so I substituted semi sweet, and cut the sugar back down to 1c. and it was perfectly sweet for my tastes. The batter is almost like brownie batter at first, but if you let it sit out for 20-30min, it really stiffens up and is like fudge. I spooned scoops onto parchment and dusted with powdered sugar and they came out with crackly dusted tops and were lovely to look at, but just somewhat lacking in flavor. Good, but not great.

I'm a super lazy cook (separate eggs? so much effort!), but after trying these cookies, I am a changed woman. These cookies were gooey chocolatey heaven that was well worth the extra steps. Dusting with powdered sugar seemed entirely unnecessary, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. The greasing of the pan is VERY important - I used a nonstick pan without greasing, for one batch and the cookies glued themselves to the tray. So far as the dough, it wasn't particularly sticky, but after overnight refrigeration, it was a bit crumbly. Still easy enough for Miss Lazy to work with, though. My only problem must relate to my oven or timer since no one else had it, but at 9 min cook time, my fist batch was badly burned on the bottom, the 2nd batch, cooked for 7 min was still a teeny bit burned. Six min seems to be just about right.

These were good but people even if you have a non-stick pan, pray it or use parchment paper , cuz these cookies are STICKY!!!!! And they burn so easily, watch them the whole time that they are baking. My friend and I made them the other day and while the dough was tasty, the final product was disgusting. So all in all you have to be an AMAZING cook to pull them off.

i added white chocolate chips too but made the mistake of adding about half a bag of each --semi sweet and white chocolate--so there ended up being WAY too much chocolate since there's so little batter in this recipe even with this mistake, they got rave reviews from the whole family and no one could stop eating them

OMG: these are it, the definitive double-dark deep choco-cookie. THROW-DOWN WORTHY! Deepest darkest chocolate color, crunchy craggy outside, molten inside. Just made them today and here are my notes if they are of any assistance: Used parchment, so easy! Used bar chocolate, not chips, so that they were "chunky" molten, evenly divided bitter sweet and unsweetened. Used the recipe amount of sugar and they are NOT too sweet. Added that cup of chopped walnuts and the 1/2 tsp cinnamon and the 1/4 tsp cayenne: the result is subtle but gets your attention. Re: the batter, it was very wet at first mixing but became quite dense very quickly. It IS very sticky/crumbly, but be patient, it's worth it! I just spoon-dropped the batter onto the parchment. (I did keep having to rinse off my chocolate encrusted fingers.) I baked them at 350 for 8-10 minutes. (Try a few test cookies if you are not sure.) Finally, the powdered sugar is not too sweet if it is a light, fine dusting - and it really looks so pretty. Astounding. A knock out. A light (no flour) but super-dense choco cookie. WOW! :)

These cookies are amazing-dark chocolaty, fudgy in the middle, crispy on the outside. I didn't have any trouble with the recipe, although I was anticipating some after reading other reviews. The dough looked like a sticky mess, but when I started working with it, it was fine. I would follow the other reviewer's suggestion and butter my hands next time. Also, these would be good with cinnamon, chipotle, or even as a rocky road version. My family told me not to mess with perfection, though :-)

Rating: 3
These cookies are SO chewy and chocolaty. Any chocoholic would love these cookies. The reason why I gave it three stars and I think others had this problem as well is that when it finished mixing, the batter was the consistency of brownie batter; it was sticky and I could practically pour it from the pan (not like cookie batter at all). Thus I thought I had messed up somewhere. I said what the heck and spooned some batter onto the cookie sheet and they baked fine. As I waited for cookies to bake, the batter slowly (approx 15-20 minutes) started to stiffen into the consistency of cookie batter. At this point it became a good consistency to roll into balls as described in the recipe. However I omitted rolling entirely as I found it easier just to spoon the batter with the two spoon method onto the cookie sheet. I would definitely make these cookies again, however I would let the batter sit at room temp for 15 to 20 minutes just to make it easier to work with. The great thing about these cookies is that now I have a recipe that complements my ice cream making which leaves me with left over egg whites!

I tried to make this recipe twice and both times the dough rolling part was EXTREMELY difficult. It was soo gooey and sticky, i stuck it in the freezer for a half hour and that still didn't help. I probably lost 1/4 the batter to sticky gooey fingers that then got stuck to everything i touched. The final result was pretty good, but I would not make this recipe again. The dough was too annoying to work with.

These cookies are very good and the technique for making the dough is a bit different. I found the dough to be somewhat difficult to work with- whether chilled or not, it was crumbly. I did not like how they looked when I rolled them in powdered sugar before baking. I preferred dusting them after baking and cooling with cocoa powder and a light dusting of powdered sugar. Then they looked pretty and tasted like a good trufffle, only much less fattening!

They were very good cookies, but a little too dark for me and my husband. I later made the cookies again, but (not having enough chocolate chips) just added 1/2 c or so of chocolate chips and none of the melted chocolate. Also added an additional 1/4 c of granulated sugar. We loved the cookies then -- they were lighter and sweeter. My coworkers loved them!

My boyfriend, who declines from chocolate flavored treats, had a bite, then without a second thought grabbed another and ran! I have broken his will to resist chocolate with this spectacular recipe. I did change this a bit: 3oz each semi sweet and unsweetened chocolate baking squares for the melted chocolate, then 1/2 cup Ghiradelli 60% cacoa bittersweet chips. I also added about 3/4 cup chopped fresh cherries and reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup, which made them a bit tart and took the sweet edge off. NOM. A word of advice: you can use bittersweet and semi-sweet chocolate interchangably, in a pinch. Also, I found it much easier to roll the dough into balls with greased hands after it had sat in the fridge (or freezer). I also found that the powdered sugar gets somewhat lost during baking, so it's just as effective to sprinkle it on as they just come out.

Absolutely divine. My grandmother used to say she only like chocoalte if it "bit"...and these cookies definitely have a bite. Perfect for a true chocoholic. I found the dough very gooey and impossible to roll into balls (as the recipe instructs). I just drop spoonfuls in the powdered sugar and rolled them around until they were coated and I could pick them up. Perhaps it would be better if I had refrigerated the dough.

It is very difficult to eat just one of these. I added about a cup of chopped walnuts and they were spectacular. I thought they would be too sweet for my taste because of all the powdered sugar, but all the bittersweet chocolate evened it out and they wee just right.

Yes! These chocolate cookies are exceptional. I didn't have bittersweet chocolate so I melted some semi-sweet chips with part of a 70% Lindt dark chocolate bar & I rolled them in powdered sugar mixed with regular sugar, which turned out great. The cooking heat & time was right on for me, but I only did one tray at a time and got about 18 cookies total (a very rounded tablespoon). The batter really does harden up when left out @ room temp for a while. And the sugar on the outside of the cookie adds a necessary aesthetic.

Easy and yummy. Possibly the perfect cookie recipe. IIt has gotten to the point that my friends insist that I bring these cookies to dinners and pot lucks. I want to make something else, but they won't let me! I now I make several copies of the recipe and bring them with the cookies.

Delicious! I used (melted) unsweetened chocolate and dark chocolate chips because a) that was what I had on hand and b) other reviewers said it was too sweet. That combination worked wonderfully, even when the cookies were rolled in powdered sugar. I also underbaked them just a touch, because I wanted a fudgy center. My roommate devoured them! Will definitely make these again.

This was a pretty easy and yummy cookie. I added cinnamon and pepper like the others recommended. A note: I used all semi sweet chips since thats what I had and next time, I think I will reduce the sugar in the recipe a bit if I use semi sweet since it did turn out a bit too sweet.

Made this as a last minute addition to a bbq I attended and they were a big hit. I follow other user reviews and mixed a bit of the bittersweet with semi-sweet, lessened the sugar, and added the cinnamon and chili powder. Easy and fast. Baked at 350 for 10 minutes. The cookies on the bottom of my oven were a little too browned at the bottom but the top rack came out perfect.

Extremely rich, very chocolatey. Followed the recipe as is, but had to supplement some of the chocolate chips with a bar of 70% dark chocolate. The powdered sugar at the end probably makes them look more attractive, but I think next time I'll just sprinkle rather than roll them around in it--I nearly choked on all the powdered sugar I inhaled when i took my first bite. They were also quite sweet. Think I'll take a look at how others reduced the amount of sugar and do the same myself. I gave some to a friend whose reaction was, Wow, you really outdid yourself this time.

As indicated by the many people who have made a variation of this recipe and still think they're amazing, it's pretty hard to have these cookies come out wrong. They're DELICIOUS and very easy. For those interested, I've included nutritional info at the bottom of this review. You won't be disappointed!! So the changes that I made were: -I used parchment paper instead of oil spray -I used 6 oz of high quality bittersweet chocolate, chopped, and then a sprinkling of mini chocolate chips later on -I used 4 egg whites instead of 3, cause I had two sets of two all ready to go -I used 3/4 cup of sugar in the dry ingredients, 1 cup of sugar in the egg whites, and I didn't roll the cookies in sugar -I added in a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and a 1/4 tsp of chili powder -I baked them in a 390 degree convection oven for 10 minutes YUM!!!!!! These cookies have a great outer shell and are soft and brownie like on the inside. I didn't find them overpoweringly sweet, just very deep and chocolately. They're not spicy or cinnamony, just very rich and flavorful so I highly recommend those additions. The batter gets VERY thick as soon as you add the melted chocolate, so make sure to add the choc chips at the same time and not afterward. Keep it in a mixer for as long as you can, then finish it off mixing by hand if you have to. I scooped out tablespoon rounds with a spoon, shaped them a little by hand, and pressed them down slightly. For those who had varying amounts of cookies, don't forget that when you use significantly less dry ingredients, or eliminate the choc chips, you'll get fewer cookies! My recipe made 28 cookies (1 sheet of 4x4, 1 sheet of 4x3). Given that number, and my ingredients, the calorie count is...drumroll please... 9 oz bittswt choc - 1288 4 egg whites - 68 1.75 c powd sugar - 816 1/2 c cocoa - 160 1 tblsp corn starch - 50 1/2 tsp cinnamon 1/4 tsp chili powder TOTAL: 2382 divided by 28... 85 CALORIES PER COOKIE!

I dropped spoonfuls of the dough onto buttered parchment paper and sifted powdered sugar over the cookies. Baked them for 9-10 min at 375. Cookies out with beautiful cracked surfaces. Did not stick to the parchment paper at all. I used semi-sweet choc chips (instead of bittersweet) and a total of 1.5 cups of sugar in the dough (instead of 2) and still found the cookies too sweet.

Holy moley are these good! I didn't have bittersweet chips so I used 2 oz of baking choc. and the rest semi-sweet chips. I melted the baking choc with 6 oz of chips. I also took the suggestion to add chile powder and cinnamon (1/4 tsp of chile, little more than that of cinnamon) and it gave them a great undertone. I messed up and mixed all the dry ingredients before adding the 1 cup of sugar to the egg whites so I just blended in 1 cup of the mix before stirring in the rest - worked out fine. Also, since my batter was incredibly soupy - I stuck the whole bowl in the fridge for ten minutes. The batter became very cakey and much easier to handle. Also, as it sat, it dried out a bit and was easier to manage. Definitely going into my recipe box!!!

I've made these twice and have to say that they are both delicious and easy. However, I found the same thing as the previous two reviewers- the dough is sticky and hard to shape and they don't look all that fantastic. But they are! I will make them again, but I'll try chilling the dough as another reviewer suggested, and I'll probably omit rolling them in the sugar, since it added nothing to the flavor or appearance.

I gave this recipe three forks for the following reason: the cookies taste wonderful and have an amazinge texture. They just don't look very good. They're kind of amorphous and half white (from the powdered sugar) and half chocolate brown. The dough is very sticky to make balls out of, so I sprayed some non-stick spray into a tablespoon measure and scooped them that way. I also found that the dough grew less sticky after sitting out at room temperature for about 20 minutes. After it dried out a little, it became easier to work with. I also found that the cookies burned after baking them for ten minutes at 400 degrees, so I lowered the oven temperature to 350, and they came out much better. Still cooked them for 8 to 10 minutes.

Great, easy recipe. If the dough is too soft or messy to easily form balls, let it cool further or chill it for a few minutes. I made a second batch, to which I added 3/8 TSP CAYENNE PEPPER and 5/8 TSP CINNAMON with the dry ingredients. I rolled the dough balls in granulated sugar and cinnamon to visually distinguish these from the plain cookies. They had a slight zip, but not too much heat for my mildly palated gathering.

this recipe is absolutely dummy proof: I didn't have powdered sugar nor an electric mixer to fully beat the eggwhites(did it by hand).they turned out wonderfully. "ready for massproduction" - roommate

These are delicious, and extremely chocolaty. Somewhat messy while shaping the dough, but otherwise very easy. I used the whole foods brand dark chocolate mini chunks. The only changes I made were to decrease powdered sugar by 1/4 cup and to sift powdered sugar over cookies while on baking sheet prior to baking. I used a foil-lined baking sheet sprayed with pam, baked at 375 for 8 mins. Removed from oven as soon as the edges felt dry, but still soft in the middle. It made 18 tbsp-sized cookies.

These cookies are divine. I sprinkled with powdered sugar before baking and baked for 9 min. This made 18 regular size cookies.

These cookies are awesome! Everyone that tried them loved them. I followed the recipe exactly except I baked them for 9 minutes. I used a small scoop and just dropped each little ball into the powdered sugar. They were very easy to make.

Rating: 4
Intense chocolate flavor and easy to prepare. Total mess getting it into the ball but things improve once you drop it in the powdered sugar - do that as quickly and deftly as possible. Mine didn't spread out very far as they were rounded when I plopped them onto the baking sheet. Next time I might try to squash them down a wee bit.

Ok, so here's the deal...I NEVER follow a recipe exactly. This is the BEST cookie ever. The last time I cooked them I was short of powdered sugar so used granulated with the egg whites. They were still so good the hostess of the event to which I took them HID them from the guests so she could keep them. A little bit of work but well worth it.

Excellent. For someone who is a chocolate lover and allergic to wheat, these are a dream! I used silpat mats, so I did not have a sticking issue and did not coat them in powdered sugar.

Soooo good! Rich, gooey, and chocolately. I used parchment paper and baked for 10 minutes as directed but some cookies were a bit burnt on the bottom. Will probably check after 8 minutes or so next time. Did not roll in sugar. Also only got 18 cookies instead of 36!! Delicious, will definitely make again.

Ended up baking these twice as long as recommended (and do use parchment or sil-pat to ensure cookies do not stick), but they are just as described--deep dark chocolate cookie. Very sweet, so I may cut back on the powdered sugar by 1/2 cup next time. They are light and lovely.

Wow, these are fantastic, my husband devoured most of the batch while I was at work. I don't roll in sugar just scoop and bake and I use Callebaut bittersweet chocolate - so they are not too sweet - and I am on weightwatchers and without the added sugar and making 36 cookies they are only 1point - wow.

This recipe is a definite keeper. The cookies received high compliments and rave reviews from friends and family. The recipe is easy and uncomplicated.

Very chocolaty. Very easy to make. My guests love them. I lowered the temp to 350. Baked the cookies on parchment paper. No sticking what so ever. I find that if the edges of the cookies look "dry" then the inside of the cookie is done.

I was not thrilled with this recipe. Even after only 7.5 minutes, my first batch was burned on the bottom so badly that I couldn't get them off the sheet. Second batch I only baked for 6 and those ,too, stuck, even with gratuitous amounts of Pam used. Overall the cookies were very chocolatey but also dry. Would not recommend.

Very easy. My guests loved the cookies. I found 10 minutes to be too long. Some of the bottoms burned. Will definitely make again.

My sister-in-law made these and they were decadent! If you are going to indulge in chocolate, this is the way to do it!

I find making cookies too messy and therefore distributed the dough into 12 small muffin forms. The result was truly delicious, and this became my favourite recipe!

Super easy & quick. They set up perfectly and I used silicone baking mats, so no sticking issues. I had to make two batches because my kids ate the first batch. The women at my meeting loved them, and the gluten-intolerant ones had to have the recipe.

Amazing recipe. Kind of messy at the end, but super easy to make, and really quick too! My only problem was that I only got 15 cookies and they all stuck. Next time I'll just use more non-stick spray.

These cookies were amazing and really easy. A danger to eat without milk. I will definitely make them again and pass this along. My only criticism is that the batch is small!

Rating: 4
Gluten-Free if made on non-stick foil instead of using Pam on foil. These are pretty sweet, but very good, and pretty. A little more time-consuming than previous reviewers led me to believe, but not terribly complicated. I let the dough rest 5 minutes before using a small scooper to form balls, and it worked quite well. I think there are better chocolate cookies in the world, but given the fact that these are gluten-free, these are a keeper for my ciliac friends, who raved about them.

I've made them twice in the last 3 weeks. My friends love them. Upon seeing them on a dessert plate, one friend said, "Oh! Chocolate Crinkles," since they looked like the traditional recipe. But once she tasted them, she said, "Wow! These are a lot more than chocolate crinkles!" I responded, "Actually, they're a lot less -- they're flourless." Mine were a bit soupy the second time I made them too, but if you spoon a ball into your hand and gently roll it before putting it in the powdered sugar bowl, it holds up and bakes just fine. Don't overbake them. Love 'em!

Everyone in my family loved these cookies. I mistakenly starting using granulated sugar (1/2 c) but then switched. Maybe that is why the dough wasn't firm enough to form balls but they were delicious. And I only had unsweetened chocolate instead of bittersweet. Loved the intense chocolate flavor and texture.

These just didn't work for me. I got them rolled out just fine, but they cooked up very strangely and tasted of crystalised sugar. The chocolate flavour is definitely great, but it just didn't have anything like a cookie texture.

These cookies were a hit! I made them in 90 degree heat, so the dough ended up a bit soupy. 20 minutes in the refrigerator did the trick! Satisfies the most intense chocolate craving!

I do an annual trip where everyone expects me to show up with interesting cookies - this one was a HUGE hit. I didn't have the chips, so I used some 100% cacao Ghirardelli with some semi sweet, and then tossed in some semi-sweet chips I had. They kept well and survived a 350 mile one-way car trip. I'll be making these a LOT.

I can't believe something so simple can be so good. Made these twice in a week for different groups and got raves from everyone.

Due to the simplicity of this recipe and the speed at which one could make this dish, I can't imagine giving it a lesser rating! They were a hit at the office and I would definitely make it again. I baked it for only 8 minutes - and noted that if a couple were underdone, they had a yummy, chewy, brownie-like consistency, which was great anyway!

these were amazing - made them for a dinner party last night and everyone raved. used a mixture of semisweet and bittersweet chocolate, and my oven only needed to cook them for around 8 minutes. will definitely make again!

These are great! I thought they would come out meringue-y but they are as described; dense and chewy! Perfect for chocolate lovers who want an intense chocolate flavor in a small bite. Cookies do not inflate much.

Using a mini ice cream scoop makes the cookie formation a cinch. Simply scoop, release into the powdered sugar, roll, and place on a baking sheet.

These cookies are absolutely delectable. My husband and I couldn't get enough. I will try to use a bit less sugar next time as I found them a tad too sweet.

These cookies were amazing. I made them with 70% dark chocolate and used a hand beater. The dough came out perfectly and the cookies really do satisfy your chocolate cravings. Plus, even with a hand beater, they were fairly easy to make...just really messy. I will definitely make them again.

Havent tasted them yet... they're cooling, but they smell delicious. yum! because im not particularly awake today, i put in regular sugar instead of powdered into the egg whites. The dough was too liquid to roll in powdered sugar so i just sprinkled it on after wards. Cant wait to eat them!

These cookies were absolutely delicious! I couldn't find bittersweet chocolate chips, so I used dark chocolate chips; probably sweeter than the recipe intends but they came out great! They are perfect with a glass of cold milk. I will definately make these again. I have a question though: my dough was not very thick so I couldn't form any TBS-sized balls. I plopped the dough onto the cookie sheet, then sprinkled with powdered sugar. Perhaps I didn't do something correctly? Could the melted chips have been too warm? Any suggestions?

These were great. Lots of chocolate and great to serve to the non-dairy tolerant crowd, except that they go especially well with milk

Yum Yum and double yum. My husband and I cannot stop eating them (even my 16 month likes them). These are great if you love dark chocolate. They are always chewy and delicious. Yummy

THe flavor was excellent. they did get a little crunchy the next day. i would make again as the only fat in it is the chocolate, which is good for you!!! also, one usually has all of these ingredients on hand.

I was in a high altitude setting, but these came out overly crunchy and dry. I would not make them again. The chocolate flavor was good though.

These are very easy and super chocolaty. I'm guessing they're lower cal with no butter or flower. Were a hit at my potluck.
