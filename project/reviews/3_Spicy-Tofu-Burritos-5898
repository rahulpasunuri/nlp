As other folks said, this is a good base. I took the advice of others and added black beans and mushrooms. I need to replace my spices for sure. :) I'd make this again and find other things to add.

This was an amazing dish:) I am a new vegetarian and this made me feel better about it! It was so good i wanted to go back for seconds:)

This recipe is a great base, though I think it really benefits from experimenting with different add-ins. I included mushrooms and black beans, then mixed in store-bought salsa verde. I also substituted a sprinkle of cotija cheese for the mozzarella to keep it lighter and more authentic. Delicious!

We were trying to experiment for our 12 year old vegetarian, she loved this recipe! Took some advice from others and added some extra spices and also used whole wheat tortillas. I was pleasantly surprised, very tastey. It was great the next day too, the flavors came together even more.

This was a really great recipe! You really don't notice the lack of meat at all, and I don't know how people found it bland, as long as the spices haven't gone stale. The lime and lettuce give a wonderful contrast in taste and texture. I will definitely try it with some beans next time. I've made this for people who normally turn up their nose at tofu, but they all loved it!

Delicious! Great base flavours and ideas here to run with. Didn't use cilantro, substituted whole wheat tortillas and low fat cheese. Carnivore boyfriend thought it was egg (ha ha) and loved it. Also added 2 tsp Cayenne. Will try with black beans next time. Looking forward to experimenting with this one. Give it a try!

This was somewhat bland, but I will use it as a base to make burritos again. I used an extra tsp of cumin, about a tsp. of chipotle pepper instead of the jalapeno and added black beans (great color combination), monterey cheese instead of mozz. and crumbled tortilla chips at the end. My husband did love it. Stronger flavors are needed.

I must say, this recipe is pretty good. Although I agree with adding some condiment to your product because it may be a little bland for some. I added ready made Dominican style pinto beans I had in my fridge after adding the tofu because my lack of wraps made the product a little "eh". The beans added great color and texture/flavor! Having no wraps, I enjoyed this dish over Spanish style white rice. I would make it again!

I did not have turmeric, so I left it out. I used New Mexico Chili Powder, which worked really well and added enough spice for my preference. I found that sauteeing the minced chili with a tad of garlic (I'm not a huge garlic fan, but the combo is really good) and olive oil is a good addition. These burritos need a bit of help with some additions like sour cream, guacamole, etc. They are a great base for creating a burrito bar.

Added mushrooms, 1 tsp chilli powder, and 1/2 cup (packed) chopped cilantro. The cilantro absolutely made the recipe. Be sure to top the burritos with avocado, salsa , sour cream and even a little swiss cheese! Loved it!

I felt the tofu mixture needed a little something extra, so I added some ground ancho and pimenton (out of ground chipotle, so that was the best substitute I could come up with) I skipped the lettuce so I could heat them in the oven, and served with salsa and sliced avocado. V. good with the additions.

My husband is a carnivore -- a real meat and potatoes guy. I can't believe he actually enjoyed tofu. He couldn't get enough of this wonderful recipe. He didn't miss the meat at all! It's absolutely delicious and so easy.

Great recipe, very healthy, very satisfying! I altered it by not mixing in the mozzarella, but just sprinkling it on the top - I liked how the flavors still mingled, but you didn't lose the color of the white mozz. which one would've if they mixed the mozz. in the dish. Enjoy!

This was delicious, and very healthy. i served it with whole wheat tortillas and salsa, it would have been good with beans and rice as well.

My fiance loves this dish, and I really like the flavors in it. I usually wrap the tofu in a teatowel and press the water out of it before adding it to the pan.

I was overall rather disappointed with this recipe. I ended up adding a TON of extra spices to simply give it some flavour. I tripled the jalapeno peppers and added about 8 cloves of garlic. I may make it again, however, only if I can think up some extra ways to make it taste better. There was nothing special about this recipe; an overall disappointment.

I substituted tofu lin for tofu and 1 tbsp onion powder for the onion (I forgot to buy onions at the grocery store) and was very happy with the results. Whatever spices go into marinating the tofu lin made it definitely not-bland. The tofu filling is enough for 6 burritos.

Totally tasteless. Actually, they do taste very similar to baked fish!!! We eat a lot of tofu and this recipe is by far the worst we've ever had.

My husband requests this recipe all the time. I add a lot of extra cheese and drain the tofu very well to avoid a runny mess. We love it and recommend it!!

not as good as I had hoped. It was not spicy enough and the tofu did not stand up well with the burritos. It might taste better with chicken?

Tasty and easy. I left out the tumeric and it was fine. We used non-fat yogurt along with salsa for the toppings.

This is a correction to the cook from Rochester below. Silken tofu comes in a range from soft to extra-firm, as does regular tofu; it does not mean "very soft," although it is usually softyer than its regular counterpart. It does have a different, finer texture, which can be quite nice. It is usually sold in aseptic cardboard packages, which have a shelf-life of about a year, so it can be kept on hand as pantry staple, which is a definite plus.

This was okay, but that's it. Maybe I was just expecting too much of the tofu, but it pretty much tasted like a scrambled egg breakfast burrito to me, which wasn't at all what I was hoping for. Maybe if I played with the recipe a bit, I'd come up with something I liked, but since the leftovers don't keep well and I'm the only one who would eat them, I probably won't bother.

Great recipe- so quick and with no complicated ingredients. I substitued green pepper for red, threw in some scallions, and topped with fat free sour cream and salsa. Good way to add some tofu to your diet!

Very easy. I used "silken" tofu and much preferred the texture to the other variety. Also, I substituted some chili powder for the jalapeno, and coriander for the turmeric and it came out great. I will definitely try it again with other vegetables.

Excellent receipe. I used a little lemon juice and a whole jalapeno & chopped zucchini instead of red bell pepper. Also added in my saute pan canned chopped tomatoes and shredded boiled chicken. Topped the burrito with a little sour cream. Great! I am a new tofu user and I hope I find as many dishes as good as this.

I fixed these last night and they were great! Goes well with refried beans and flavored rice. The variations of this recipe are endless as you can add any veggie you like to the tofu mixture. I'm going to try beans and eggplant next time around. Make this recipe! You won't be disappointed!

Just for clarification..."silken" refers to very soft. It doesn't necessarily have any textural 'advantage' over the firmer variety. It's just a matter of personal preference.

I am addicted to this recipe! The first time I made it I ate it three days in a row, including breakfast. Its easy and quick, and healthy. I prefer the "silken style" firm tofu, as it makes for a much nicer texture than regular firm tofu.

Very good! I will do this again and it is so easy! I added a little Taco Seasoning to the Tofu and it added a little kick.

This is the first tofu recipe I have ever made. We all liked it very much. It fooled my husband, he thought they were machaca burritos! We also put black beans and rice into the burritos. Very tasty.

This recipe was wonderful - flavorful and light. I had some leftover black beans which I added to the tofu mixture.

This recipe had great flavor but I had trouble keeping the tortillas together. I'll practice that more next time.

I also froze the tofu because I like a heartier consistency. I used half the amount of jalapenos - just in case, and it was mild. The lime added a great taste. I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe as some tofu recipes are terrible, but I'm always hopeful. I made this with the Three-chili rice, and combined both leftovers into burritos for breakfast. Also delicious.

we loved this dish and make it often. we will try freezing the tofu as the previous rater suggested next time. thanks!

good, quick, healthy meal and a good way to get more soy in your diet. Freezing the tofu and then grating it gives it the consistancy of ground beef rather than scrambled eggs.

Using only the ingredients specified, this recipe was definitely HOT - kind of like you have to bend over backwards to give the tofu some flavor. The tofu ends up having the consistency of scrambled eggs.

My first experience with tofu! Great & easy recipe. I substituted the red bell peppers with mushrooms and celery that I had on hand. I found shelf stable tofu, so I'll take this recipe camping this year.

Fantastic! The blend of spices and flavors make this healthy dish an aromatic and colorful treat. I used whole wheat tortillas and fat free sour cream to add texture.

I served this to my 13 year old son and he thought it was great...he was totally unaware of the tofu and said that he would like to have it again. I thought it tasted pretty good, too and was easy to prepare. Without salsa, however, it was a goner.
