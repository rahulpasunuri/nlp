Yum! Ribeyes aren't my favorite, so I usually make this with a sirloin roast. I also add hot peppers- the tomato corn salad is wonderful!

I love this dish. It's delicious and easy. I've made it twice now and can't wait to make it again. The lime really adds oomph to this dish and I add extra on my corn salad at the end. Yummy.

This was absolutely incredible. If your steak sucked, it's because you got poor quality meat, or you didn't use enough salt and pepper. It helps to bring the steak to room temp before you cook it, and for the dish to work, you have to have the pan hot enough to char the outside of the meat. It's also not advisable to use a non-stick pan. We thought that this meal was the perfect combination of summer flavors, and we loved every bite of it. This will most certainly be added to our regular rotation.

I found this easy and very delicious! Great summer dish. I used good old Montreal steak seasoning instead of salt and pepper on those wonderful rib-eyes, and the corn was exceptional! This one will go straight to the recipe box.

I liked this dish...I loved the salad part of it, but the steak was not so amazing. I think it needs more seasoning. I thought the flavors of the warm salad were lovely and assertive but the steak felt bland next to it. Maybe even salting it after you slice it might do the trick.

This dish is sure to please. Easy to make and flavorful. I use the leftover salad the next day to make an orzo salad adding cucumber, additional tomatoe and basil and lemon juice. This is also fantastic. I've made the recipe three times already.

We found the corn salad rather bland. We'd spice it up with a different kind of pepper, add some cumin, more chili powder, maybe a splash of balsamic vinegar. Me, I'd pile on the Tabasco.

"Italian" frying peppers are the elongated, normal size peppers that are pale green.

The tomato corn salad was delicious! Sweet, yet no sugar. It was great leftover too.

This was excellent. Next time, I will use a skirt steak instead of the rib eyes. We had some tomato corn salad left over, so my husband took it to work (the firehouse) the next day. He served it over scrambled eggs with cheese, to the rave reviews of his fellow firefighters.

A fabulous dish, delicious and easy to prepare. I did not know what frying peppers are (as some of the other reviewers), so I took a red pepper instead and it still turned out scrumptious.

this dish was great- really colorful and very tasty. the only change i made was replacing the chile powder with a cayenne/paprika mixture, which worked out well.

Made this with poblano peppers, a little spicy - will try with a more mild pepper next time.

Great, flavorful summer dish. Very easy to prepare and makes a beautiful presentation. I didn't know what Italian frying peppers were, so substituted Anaheim.

Great summer evening meal. Simple and my husband loved it! Used prime rib-eye and a yellow pepper. What is an Italian "frying" pepper?

Didnt have Italian peppers, but used my homemade B & B style banana peppers - It came out wonderfully - my family loved it!

My boyfriend loved this. A very tasty dish. It was easy to make, but tasted like a lot more work. The whole house smelled good.
