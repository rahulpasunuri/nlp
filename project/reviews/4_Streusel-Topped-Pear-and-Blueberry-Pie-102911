Delicious!! Made this for my boyfriend for his birthday and we both loved it. I used my own crust to avoid the reported shrinking. I also substituted pecans for the walnuts in the streusel topping. Next time I would add a little lemon to the filling: substitute one table of OJ for lemon. I cut the pears to 1/2 inch out of personal preference. They turned out soft (not mushy) with a firm middle. Seriously delicious!

Fantastic Pie. Streusel was the best I've ever had. I used a pear/apple cross fruit rather than pears and fresh blueberry. Fantastic. I also used a traditional crust. No shrinkage. This is a winner.

!!! To everyone whose crust shrank during pre-baking: the crust recipe is missing KEY information. All pre- baked crusts MUST be weighted down with raw rice, beans or commercially available pie weights during pre- baking. Simply line the raw crust with foil or parchment on the bottom and up the sides, and fill with raw rice or beans, ensuring firm contact all around the pie shell. Also, the crust should be pricked all over with a fork prior to baking. No need to discard rice -- just keep it in a jar and use over and over again. I've had mine for 15 years. I'm amazed this recipe neglected to mention such a crucial piece of information! Another useful hint: 10 minutes before the crust is done, remove pie weights and foil, brush with beated egg and bake 10 more minutes. This prevents the crust from becoming soggy after it's filled.

Delicious! Pears need to cook a little longer on top of stove. Didn't have OJ, substituted lemon juice instead. Turned out fine. The streusel topping is to die for! Crust shrank on me too even when I substituted spelt flour. Not the best crust recipe.

My crust shrank a lot during baking and was very hard to roll out in the beginning as well. I will NEVER use this crust recipe again. Also, the pears definitely need more than 6 minutes to cook before baking. They were too firm in the finished pie.

Perfect! Served to guests and it looked great as well as tasting great.

My first pie, and it was so easy! It was delicious.

My crust shrank too. And with 6 Tbls of flour in the filling it was horribly gummy. The topping was ok but I don't think this recipe is worth trying again.

Nice company dessert. Pears took much longer to cook than stated. Used store crust and there was so much flavor going on that no one noticed!

Very yummy. My crust shrank a lot during the initial baking so that very little of the crimping was actually showing once I put the filling in. The pie, itself was brown enough in about 50 minutes. By 1 hour, it looked a little overcooked.

I have made this pie three times-each time it tasted great. I even used a store bought crust to save on time and it was still delicious.

Excellent, my husband asks for it every year on his birthday.

I made this pie for a Thanksgiving dessert, substituted mixed berries instead of blueberries, and everyone raved. The streusel is delicious

This is the best pie I've ever made! The topping is perfect--I hate rolling dough! I followed the recipe exact, and it turned out beautifully. Better warm than at room temp.

I thought this pie was fabulous, and much better warm than room temperature. It was a little time consuming to make in one sitting, but the crust and filling can be made ahead, and assembled the next day if that is an issue. Next time I would not use all the juices, to make a firmer pie.

This was good....But I used a mixture of frozen berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries), which I would seriously recommend as it adds great flavor. I used two kinds of pears - Bosc and D'Anjou, make sure that they are firm. Also, I would only use 7-8 tablespoons of flour at the end - not 9. The topping of this pie was the best part - everyone at the party loved it! I also served it with creme fraiche...

Very good recipe, family liked it very much served warm with cold vanilla sauce. Would definately make it again. Used frozen raspberries instead of blueberries.

This is truly a to-die-for pie. I added a small handful of frozen strawberries, which worked out well. Used a mixture of bosc and anjou pears... Will be doing it again soon.

I made this when I had an abundance of pears. Substituted frozen blueberries, thawed. I couldn't keep my family out of this dessert before the party, so had to make another! We loved it- I did limit the amount of juice from the mixture that went into the crust - adding most but not all of the juices, because I was afraid it might get soggy- but it turned out wonderful (both times!)

This recipe is fabulous! I have made it at least 6 times, and have used different kinds of pears and even substituted apples. Great with warm Vanilla Ice Cream. Enjoy!

A great and relatively easy dessert. I used fruit from the farmer's market so I didn't have to worry about anything being underripe. I will definitely make this again--tomorrow if this one is gone by then!

I've made this pie twice both times with great success. Five large pears worked best though!

SCRUMPTIOUS. Absolutely loved it and so did my guests. I did it with pears that definitely weren't fully ripe but I used bosc so I think that helped.

I have made this pie three times and it was wonderful each time. Everyone who tasted the pie thought it was one of the best they have ever had. I used fresh Blueberries the first time I made this pie since my grocer did not have frozen. It was so good that I have only used fresh blueberries each time. This pie is a definate winner!

Not a bad pie for a winter fruit pie, but not great. I think it really depends on the pears - be sure they are truly ripe and cook them long enough so they're soft. I used pecans, rather than walnuts in the topping ("a cook" should remember to check out the "links" to associated recipes) and it turned out well. I took this to work and it was quickly finished. People raved about it for days afterwards, but I was less impressed.

My pie was a disaster! My crust fell into the pie pan on the first baking, I increased the amount of blueberries as suggested & it still didn't seem to be enough, plus it was rather watery and extremely disappointing! I had one piece with my husband and we threw the rest away...very time consuming and wasteful : (

This pie was delicious but you forgot to include the recipe for th walnut- streusel topping. I was able to get it directly from Bon appetit and here it is. Pulse the following ingredients in food processor until coarse crumbs form: 1 c flour, 1/2 c packed dark brown sugar, 1/2 c walnuts toasted, 1/2 c chilled unsalted butter cut into 1/2 inch pieces, 1/4 tsp salt.

we prepared this for a superbowl dinner for a group of judges and competing chefs at V.T. for a culinary competition and they couldn't stop raving about it-another big hit from the New River Valley chapter A.C.F.
