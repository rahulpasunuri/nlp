Good... the mushrooms needed more flavor. Maybe it's just that the batch I heard were not so good. Overall, a nice way to eat potatoes!

Okay but not worth the effort

It was very good but much like a lot of people i added some fresh garlic onto the potato's and onions as well with the mushrooms. It was very tasty for a morning munch but a little much with the butter.

I've only made this twice now, but I know this is going to be one of my favorite recipes from this site. I used plain button mushrooms and I also fried chopped bacon before adding the potatoes. And I sauteed some chopped shallots before frying the mushrooms. Delicious!

I love this recipe, but I improved on it a little (at least for my taste). I season the potatoes with garlic powder, salt and pepper. I sauteed the mushrooms with onions and fresh garlic and added them to the potatoes after they (the potatoes) were almost done. Also, I sauteed some pancetta first, then the potatoes.

I was not that impressed. I found it quite bland. I might try it again but with lots of garlic next time.

This one got a thumbs up from my entire family, including my three children (aged 13 months to 9 years). We love mushrooms and this is a keeper that surely works well with any combination. I added more mushrooms than the recipe called for and got no complaints!

Very tasty. I used portobella mushrooms as well for a great taste. Super-easy to prepare but a nice side dish for a brunch or breakfast-in-bed.

We found this dish to be so-so. Would not make it again.

This was a big hit with my family who love spuds and mushrooms. This was the first time I mixed them together, and I could not make enough. I would suggest doubling the recipe the first time, especially if you have big eaters at your house!
