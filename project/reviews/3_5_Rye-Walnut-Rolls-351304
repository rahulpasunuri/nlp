Fantastic recipe. Finding the nigella seeds wasn't the easiest, but they really added to the roll's deliciousness.

To ccraigb753: 2 teaspoons of yeast is indeed sufficient to rise so much flour, the rise will just be a little slower than is typical; in fact, for rye flour breads, it's preferable to have a slower rise (long story short). I had no problems with this recipe. The onion, walnut, and rye were fantastic together, but the crunchy and spicy nigella seeds really make it. Excellent bread.

I think this recipe is printed wrong. It calls for 5 1/2 cups of all purpose flour, and I think it should say 2 1/2 cups 2 tsps of yeast is not enough to rise a total of 6 1/2 cups of flour.

Fantastic! So much flavor. I used whole wheat instead of white- perfect. Nigella seeds are delicious. Be sure to begin early enough for the ~3 hours total rising time. Excellent warm with butter. Not as good cold the next day. These are great alongside a cold-weather soup.
