This was really easy. I used the bag of small sweet yellow, orange and red peppers from Costco. I found the brine wasn't quite sweet enough, so I added approximately 2 tablespoons more sugar, and dissolved it in the brine. Now I've taken small jars of them as hostess gifts, and they are very well received.It's a delicious addition to sandwiches. Definitely a keeper.

I used this recipe as a base for my effort to reproduce the fabulous spicy pickled carrots that accompany the croques monsieurs at Tartine Bakery in San Francisco. Obviously, I replaced the peppers with carrots. I also added two serrano peppers, sliced in rounds with the seeds included, to the mixture. The resulting carrots were just what I wanted, and were very similar to Tartine's. This is a fantastic basis for any pickling effort.

These are super easy and have been a hit will all pepper lovers. Made these with yellow and red bell peppers fresh from the farmer's market. Slighly sweet - they make an excellent appetizer or accompaniment to sweet Italian sausage. Am making a second batch.

Great! I had to substitute cider vinegar because I didn't have enough white wine vinegar on hand. Turns out great, I'm going to make some more for a BBQ this weekend.
