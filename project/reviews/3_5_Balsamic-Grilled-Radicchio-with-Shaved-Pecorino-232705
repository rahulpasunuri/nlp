Made this as part of a Food and Wine pairing evening. It was the best dish of the night, as voted by my guests. Served with a Cab Sav/Carmenere from Chile and it couldn't have been a better pairing. Everyone wanted the recipe.

This was my first introduction to radicchio as the main event, rather than just an extra in a bagged salad mix. I was afraid it would be bitter, but there was no bitterness at all on the charred pieces. The second time I made this I just tore the heads apart and laid it all out in a grill basket so that every piece would get cooked evenly. This year I am growing radicchio specifically for this recipe.

Excellent - I skipped the orange zest -not a fan. Put it in a grill basket with some unmarinated asaparagus - the flavors were perfect. BIG hit. Nice nod to the start of fall, but still in prime grilling season!

this looked and smelled beautiful but my whole family found it bitter. I would not try it again.

This was really nice and would make an unexpected and impressive salad course for a hearty Italian meal. The orange zest is the defining touch. Didn't use pecorino, used parmesan instead. I think the sharpness of pecorino would be better if you have it on hand.
