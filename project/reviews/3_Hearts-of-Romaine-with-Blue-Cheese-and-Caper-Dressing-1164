I liked the dressing, but not as much as my sisters did. I made this salad with lunch this week, but I felt that the dressing overpowered everything else.

I loved the dressing although I used a mixed salad of bitter greens(arugula radicchio oak etc). I would suggest that if you are making the salad ahead of time that the capers be added at the last minute.

This was easy and wonderful. I put some chopped vine ripe tomatoes on top for color and then poured dressing over. Guest loved it.
