This was FANtastic. I loved the breadcrumb stuffing, I can't wait to try it in another dish. Microwaving the artichokes was a great tip and made the prep quick and simple.

Love the simple stuffing for the artichoke. I had lots of red sweet peppers from my garden, and I made 10 times the amount of the dressing, and gave it away at a women's club I belong to. Everyone loved it!

Adequate, not great.

I added white wine, dried basil and parsely to stuffing. Very nice! Slicing them in half is the way to go...easier to handle and better presentation. I sprinkled top with paprika before baking for color and a bit of kick. If artichokes are cooled completely before stuffing, increase baking time to 20 minutes.

I cut the artichokes in 1/2 before baking to create smaller portions, but the end product was a little dry around the edge leaves.

This was a little putsy, but delectable. I would agree the vinagrette was not necessary. Great flavor. I used to steam artichokes on top of the stove. The microwave yielded great results. Would definitely make again.

These came out delicious!!! I did not have red pepper so I used yellow and it worked great. I also skipped the vinaigrette entirely due to other reviews claiming it was nothing great. I had a bit of trouble keeping them propped up but it was not too difficult. I loved these and will definitley make them again.

Served these for New Year's and they were a big hit! I cut the artichokes in half after cooking them, which made them much easier to clean and stuff -- and also made them the right serving size for individuals. They also looked very pretty cut in half on the serving platter.

This was excellent!! I just happen to have 2 artichokes and was looking for a new way to serve them. I did not have the red pepper, so I left that out. I did not have the scallion, and replaced it with a handful (about 6 sprigs) of chopped flat leaf parsley. I also had some of my home made vinaigrette on hand, which I used instead of the one in the recipe. I'd say there was almost too much stuffing. I served the artichokes as a side dish with roasted chicken and rosemary potatoes. I'll definitely make this again.

I've made this recipe several times since it first appeared in Gourmet. Each time it gets rave reviews from friends and family. I wouldn't (and haven't) change a thing!

Wonderful; looks beautiful and tastes great. Easy and elegant, and no more difficult to prepare 8 artichokes than 2. I served it at a dinner party and the guests were wildly impressed. Easy to do ahead: I prepared mine (except the baking) and refrigerated them, so the baking time to heat the atichokes was closer to 25 minutes. Yum!

The stuffing for this recipe was superb! This is the first time I've ever tried cooking an artichoke, so I had a few problems, but I will definitely use the stuffing in some other recipe. It was excellent! Vinaigrette didn't impress me too much, though.

I have had Stuffed Artichokes many, many, many times. I recommend this recipe for everyone. It is really easy, the only hard part is getting the artichokes to stand up evenly in the pan, I use coffee cups (the least height possible, corning ware is good brand). The weight of the water in them holds them down and I place in between each artichoke for support. Try it, you'll love it!
