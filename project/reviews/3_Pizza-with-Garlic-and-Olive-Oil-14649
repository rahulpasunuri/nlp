Sorry, I found this one boring and not very pizza-y.

My kids and I loved this. It reminds me of the "Mediterranean Bread" we order at our favorite pizza joint in Chicago. The topping is delicious but I wasn't crazy about the dough and will substitute my own recipe next time.

We loved this recipe! We grilled the pizza rather than baking it in the oven and it worked great. We're making it tonight for the second time.

I did this recipe because I had 2 back-to-back dinner parties I had to do. I cut the recipe in half and served it as an appitizer and it went over fairly well (mother-in-law didn't care for it...to spicy) It was a change from the same ol'/same ol' appitizer recipes. I wouldn't do it for a supper....not enough substance

Loved the topping on this "pizza" recipe. I made it for a pizza party and cut it into small pieces as an appetizer. Everyone liked it!

Add fresh clams and reduced clam juice for a delicious dish.

I work in a wine store and made this for our Italian tasting-I did put olive oil in the water/yeast mix, and infused oil with the garlic hours ahead. Instead of putting spices in oil, just sprinkled those and some rosemary on after pooling the garlic oil on crust. Wow. I doubled the recipe and shaped into rectangles-cut into 4in pieces(had to feed a lot of people)after baking, and it was all gone. Went well with meaty tortellini antipasto salad and sausages. Not to mention the wines!

The no-trip-to-the-store factor is why I will probably make this again. This is simply pizza dough w/ a garlic-oil topping, and it's a good way to use extra dough. But I wouldn't call it a pizza!

This turned out really nice and was so easy to make. Is a great appetizer. Next time I might try making this on the grill...

This recipe is really good. I agree with the cook in Seattle that it's nice not to have to make the trip to the grocery store. I'd encourage anyone to try it too. (By the way, I look at the reviews for input on the recipe, not for spelling tips).

Increase garlic to 2 large cloves, and olive oil to 3 tablespoons. I also used 20 ounces of dough, so it took about 15 minutes to cook. The 6-7 minutes in the recipe would be a very thin crust.....

I was a bit skeptical before making this pizza, because of it's simplicity, but went ahead, bacause it didn't reguire a trip to the store. Well, I am very glad that I did, it was awesome. I would incourage anyone to try it.
