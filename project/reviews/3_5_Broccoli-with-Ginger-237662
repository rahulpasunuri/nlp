I love broccoli and I love ginger. I doubled the amount of ginger and we all said this was not very good. It needs more ginger and it needs something else. I will not make it again.

I used more ginger and I am glad I did. This is so good. I will use this again soon. My husband liked it too.

Delicious, and it was the first time my 2.5 year old has agreed to eat broccoli, and even asked for more (she dipped it into Ranch dressing, too). I doubled ginger and added garlic, as recommened by other reviewers, and will definitely make it again. My husband liked it too, and noted that ginger gives it a nice flavor.

I added garlic too but I really didn't care for this recipe.

Very nice, and very easy. I also about doubled the ginger and added garlic. It needed it. What a wonderful taste combination - broccoli and ginger.

This was okay as written. Next time, I'll double the ginger.

This is an excellent way to spice up broccoli. Like the other reviewers, I agree that garlic is a nice addition.

I was making a chicken with thai basil and was looking for something to go with it using what was in the garden and we picked some broccoli this morning so this fit the bill but I thought it needed a bit more oomph so I doubled the ginger, added 2 cloves of garlic and a couple of good shakes of red pepper flakes while I was heating the oil. Yum.

I agree with almost everyone here... delicious recipe and would make it again with at least twice as much ginger as called for.

Very tasty way to make broccoli. I cooked mine a little longer than recommended because of the preferences of my family and found that it still turned out great. I used minced garlic in a jar and added a little garlic too.

I steamed the broccoli in the microwave, as I usually do. I grated the ginger rather than mince it and I think I would use more next time. It was easy and tasty and a change from our usual lemon pepper on steamed broccoli.

This recipe was very simple and tasty. Next though, I would add some garlic to give it some more punch. Other than that, It is a very easy and quick side dish that can be made on the weeknight.

Rather simple and tasty. I did throw in a little Maggi stirfry sauce.

I give this 4 forks because it is the only way my toddler will eat broccoli! However, I would use more ginger - maybe triple it.

I would never have paired ginger with broccoli this way, it was very refreshing.
