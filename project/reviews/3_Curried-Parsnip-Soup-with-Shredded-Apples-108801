This is a delicious soup; my dinner guest and I loved it. It has quite a lot of texture. I wonder if I undercooked the parsnips. No matter; great taste. After eating the first servings, I mixed the remaining shredded apple into the soup. Not as interesting a presentation for the leftovers but still delicious. I didn't do the fried peels; I rarely fry anything chez moi.

this soup is wonderful. I made it for Christmas dinner and received rave reviews. I omitted the apple as I don't care for additional texture in these root vegetable soups and made it the previous day (actually two days earler). velvety, nice curry flavor--simply divine.

Made it 3 times. Make it at least one day before you serve it since it gets better over time.

I really liked this recipe but I didn't use Granny Smith apples, I used Mcintosh. I also skipped the fried apple peel part and garnished with some toasted chopped pecans instead. I used Greek yogurt which made it very creamy!

Quite good but not great -- didn't care for the apples. However, my my fiancé thought it was great!

Pretty good soup. Be careful not to use a curry powder with too much cayenne, because the recipe calls for a lot of it. It also might be better with a sweeter apple than the suggested Granny Smiths.

I made this soup the first time for Thanksgiving in 2003. A friend who was there asked me to bring it to her Christmas party. I also brought it to my neighbor's New Year's Day party. She now asks for it every year for New Years. It has become my signature soup. Everyone loves it. I often make a batch for home throughout the cooler months. It is delicious, extremely easy and good for you.

Delicious soup, interesting mix of flavors. The fried apple peels on top add a tanginess and make the presentation great.

I spotted and saved this recipe to my recipe box back in 11/03, but I only made it for the first time today. All I can say is WOW!! Absolutely fabulous, earned every fork. If you like this soup, check out the Senegalese Soup, also on this site. :)

I have to agree with the reviewer before me - I am SO surprised that people did not like this recipe. My family and I really enjoyed this soup and I will be making it again!

I am surprised by the mediocre reviews. I found this to be an excellent, elegant soup worthy of serving even to discriminating guests.

At first it was OK, then the flavor became 'stronger'. I think the Granny Smith apples where the cause. If I made it again, which I most likely will not, I would use apples other than Granny Smith.

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone at the dinner table thought it was great. I served it with the baguettes with goat cheese, walnuts, honey and rosemary. A perfect pair!! Thank you!

This was ok. Kind of strange tasting but not bad. I wouldn't make it again but I didn't throw it out either.
