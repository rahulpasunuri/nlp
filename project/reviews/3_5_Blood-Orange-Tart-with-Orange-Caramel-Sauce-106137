Absolutely NOT worth the time, effort, and cost. The custard does not set as the recipe is written (and I'm not the only one who had this problem; see previous reviews). It's too sweet, so reduce the sugar, and as written, it makes about double the custard you need to fill the tart, so save your eggs and halve the custard recipe if you must. Overall, a waste of blood oranges.

There are 2 things that need to be corrected in this recipe: the amount of sugar and the thickness of the curd. I followed the recipe exactly and the curd didn't set to the point of being solid enough to cut into it. I think I'll opt for some gelatin next time or I may need to find another curd recipe that has been tested. As for the amount of sugar, there was just too much and the dessert ended up being too sweet. I would cut back on the amount of sugar next time because if you think about it, and you divide the tart into 8 pieces, 1 piece would have 3 tbsp of sugar based on the 1.5 cups of sugar in the curd. That's a little too much sugar in one sitting. The overall taste though was incredible! The amount of citrus flavour was lovely! I used mandarin oranges for the juice and it seemed to intensify the flavour of the lemon. Just lovely!

I'm confused when people make a dessert and say it's too sweet in a review. It's dessert! It's supposed to be sweet. Anyway, in the spirit of dessert, I did NOT cut out a part of the sugar as many did but my problem with this dessert is that I followed the recipe exactly, even had my candy thermometer going to the right temperature, and the curd never set. Even a day later, the consistency was exactly the same as when I pulled it off the fire, just colder. I actually had to re-heat it and add Wondra to it to thicken. But it is very tasty!!! With the full amount of sugar! Also did the caramel sauce which also was very thin. Like pouring a juice over it.

This is very easy and tasty. Love that the curd is already cooked and has a lovely pink hue. I used the curd the day I made it. I keep unbaked tart shells in the freezer for ease of use. Will make again!Did not make orange caramel sauce, so cannot comment on that.

This tart was delicious - the curd is fantastic and has a great flavor, but ours did turn out really runny, and it didn't set after a day in the refrig. Maybe I did something wrong, but I think next time I'll add a little cornstarch. Also...if you're going to make this tart be prepared for a MESS and don't wear clothes you don't want stained! My friend and I made it together and yes, I'm pretty clumsy and uncoordinated but that blood orange juice gets EVERYWHERE... :)

The orange/lemon curd was delicious. I did half the sugar, as was recommended by other reviewers. The sweet/tart ratio was perfect. I would not recommend serving the dish right away after spreading the curd into the cooled crust. It needs to be chilled for a couple of hours to set up for slicing/presentation. Mine was a little sloppy looking. Making the crust was interesting. It never formed clumps with the addition of wet ingredients. I even put an extra Tb. cream. Yet, with rolling and chilling, it produced a PERFECT crust. I will use the crust recipe over and over.

I really enjoyed this tart, but did make some changes (most based on previous reviews). I decreased the amount of sugar in the curd by half and it was plenty sweet. I also added some thickener so that it firmed up within several hours. To the crust, I added just a touch of Grand Marnier to enhance the orange flavor. Finally (and most controversially!), I added the cardamom pastry cream from another Epicurious recipe using blood oranges. So the final dessert included: crust, curd, pastry cream, orange slices. I didn't use the orange syrup. While the dessert ended up being somewhat complicated, I believe it was made much more interesting by the addition of the cardamom cream, a flavor that nicely complements the oranges. While this certainly wasn't the best dessert ever, I'd enjoy it again.

The curd was really sweet! I didn't end up making the caramel sauce because the tart would have been way too sweet. It took much longer than 12 minutes to thicken the curd but it did thickenn eventually, just be patient and keep stirring. I served the tarts with an unsweetened raspberry puree. They were pretty good but if I'm going to make the caramel sauce with them next time then I will reduce the amount of sugar to 1 cup. The pastry was excellent.

I have been making this tart since 2/03, and have never been disappointed. The curd alone is remarkable (good) and a wonderful gift!

I served this dish this evening and it was delicious and received good reviews from my foodie friends. Because I am hasty, I did not let the curd set for the required minimum of one day and it was slightly too runny. I couldn't believe that the curd actually needed 24H to thicken in the fridge (I assumed the 24H was to meld the flavors). I guess I'll know better next time, or perhaps nip the problem in the bud by cooking just a little longer or adding cornstarch as one reviewer suggested. I did get to 175 and held it there for a while, so I know the peak temperature wasn't an issue. Segmenting the oranges isn't too much of a problem if you use the technique of cutting the peel off the whole orange, then gripping the fruit and cutting out each segment while using the remaining fruit as a grip. Flip the cut membrane to one side and proceed around the orange. In my mind it's no more tedious than snapping peas or hulling walnuts.

Made this for a dinner party and thought it was just okay (as did my guests). The curd & the caramel sauce were quite tasty, but - overall - it just wasn't that thrilling. Also, one needs far more patience than I have to remove the membrane from all of those orange segments. Way too time-intensive for just an "okay" outcome.

I made this recipe for a local culinary contest that called for a "Citrus Recipe." I made 4 smaller tarts rather than 1 large one and saved a lot of time by only putting 3 small orange segments on the top, garnished with a tiny sprig of mint. The plate was lined with orange leaves, mint and then scattered raspberries sprinkled with super fine sugar on the platter. Spectacular presentation....and I got first place in the Professional category! Very time consuming, but very different and impressive. The curd is delicious!

On the rare occurrence of having an abundance of blood oranges in South Carolina, I indulged in making the curd for gifts. It is a truly outstanding and decadent recipe! Thank you.

This tart was absolutely delicious. I served it at Easter and the entire family was raving about it. The difficult and time consuming part for me was removing the "membrane" from the oranges. This took a very long time and I will save this one for special occasions.
