This is fairly easy to throw together if you use a store bought crust and it was quite tasty! My non veggie boyfriend loved it enough to take leftovers for lunch the next day.

This was divine! But with a few changes. I had a purchased pizza base, which I found out had passata already smeared on it. I also didn't have any fontina. I used soft goat's cheese dolloped instead. I like nutmeg but I think maybe it's too much? But anyway, try this. It's really-really good!

With a few tweeks our first time we loved this recipe. First change we made was to cube the butternut squash ( 1/2 inch ) bake for 25 min at 400 degrees. We did spinach instead of parsley. Caramelized the onion for sure:-)

Really liked it! my son looked at it first and snapped a "is this pizza!!??" - it only took one bite for him to give the thumbs up! i will definitely try it again with Sage.

I really liked the caramelized onions, but I am not sure I am a fan of the nutmeg in the butternut squash--or maybe I just prefer a more savory pizza. I would make it again, but I might add some vegetables and more savory ingredients so it isn't quite so sweet. I actually thought of the idea of putting the squash mixture into a plastic bag to make it like a pastry bag, just so you can control how it goes on the pizza. It looked a bit sloppy with the globs of squash.

Yum! I followed other reviewers suggestion and used sage instead of parsley. I omitted the cheese and used an alfredo sauce instead.

i just got back from a week out of town, and i stupidly offered to make dinner for friends, but when i got in the kitchen i realized (to my horror) that my boyfriend hadn't grocery shopped (or used any of the perishables in the fridge). the only workable ingredients left in the apartment were, quite literally, frozen butternut squash, onion, and fontina cheese. i also had the ingredients for a pizza crust, but i didn't use the recipe provided. anyway, this little number was yummy and easy enough to throw together in a pinch. i'll definitely make it (or something like it) again.

I thought next time I would try sage instead of parsley. Thought of that when I started smelling the aromas as the pizza was cooking. Just seemed to smell like it should have sage combined with the other flavors instead of parsley.

This is a great dish but the receipe is all wrong. I floowed the directions, but then bought a yummy frozen pizza pie crust. Fisrt I laid down the squash mixture (like pizza sauce), then added the oncions on top, then the cheese. Its so yummy. I think it would taste great over brown rice too.

This isn't really "pizza" per say, but it is a tasty recipe for some delicous toppings on top of a flat bread. I must confess I was strapped for time and used a Boboli crust rather than making the accompanying pizza dough recipe, so this review is for the toppings only. The butternut squash, onions, and fontina cheese all work really well together. I had been skeptical at first that the butternut squash would be too soggy for the pizza crust, but it worked quite well in lieu of the traditional pizza sauce. I would definitely make this again.
