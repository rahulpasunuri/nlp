Made these many times and each time they are a winner with guests. Light in texture and flavor. I don't see this as a negative.

This was one of my first times working with yeast and I was very happy with the results. I could taste the parmesan but I think next time I would add more, so it would be less subtle. I like the idea that another reviewer had of adding freshly ground pepper.

I am a beginner bread maker and got great results with this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and had no issues. These rolls got snatched up at the potluck I took them too¡

My 4 yr. old didn't like the parmesan flavor, but my husband and I LOVED them.

I made these once sticking perfectly to the recipe. The texture and appearance was outstanding, but I thought the cheese flavor was weird and off putting. I made them a 2nd time substituting buttermilk for the milk, added about 1 1/2 tsp chopped fresh rosemary, and omitted the cheese and they were delicious. I have made my altered recipe numerous times and they always go over very well.

I made these for Easter and they came out great. My family really liked them. I was a little surprised at how wet the dough was, but resisted the urge to add more flour. I added freshly cracked black pepper to them and it went with the Parm really well. My son even ate them with strawberry jam this morning and said it was really good. Also, because I used Kosher salt, I doubled it to 2 tsp.

These came out very nicely! They are easy to make and have a very nice presentation for serving. Don't add extra flour. The dough is very wet, but the rolls might come out too dry if you add more. I liked the taste and would make with or without cheese depending on the rest of the meal. With the cheese I might add an herb such as basil, oregano or rosemary next time. I also might try with some whole wheat flour.

I liked this recipe as it only makes one pan of rolls and the texture was great. Be sure to use good quality cheese and don't skimp on it. I added coarse salt to the top for crunch. Next time I will use a garlic butter - it will go good with the flavor and the texture. These are easy to make for a beginniner just don't be afraid of the stickiness of the dough. Great rolls for dipping in your tomato sauce or soup or with lots of butter.

Like other reviewers, I increased the parmesan to over 2 cups and increased the salt. While the rolls were beautiful they still lacked any stand out flavor. We couldn't taste the cheese at all. It was disappointing and I probably won't make this recipe again.

These are easy to make but quite dense and dry - my guests ate them but slathered them with butter or dipped them in olive oil. I would add some course salt and rosemary to the top to add some interest and pass a fruity olive oil for dipping...

They looked lovely but no-one in the house (three adults, two children) liked the taste. Despite the fact that we are all cheese-heads. The bulk of these were thrown away. A true tragedy. Next time I'll make them a bit sweeter and omit the cheese, no wait. I'll just make a braided Brioche!

melted the butter and cooked 4 chopped cloves of garlic in it, then added it all to the dough. i only had a cup of cheese, would add at least another 1/4 as the recipe calls for next time!

I was nervous that the dough/batter was too wet and added extra flour ... then they ended up a little dry. I guess I should have trusted the recipe to begin with. Used Romano because that's what I had on hand, but I think it would also be great with Asiago.

Bla...Nice texture, rose well, nobody liked the taste, kids or adults. I composted the whole batch. The only reason I gave it this many forks is that I'd consider making them again, this time with no cheese, a little extra honey, 1/2 whole wheat, a slug of flax seed meal and some wheat germ.

May God have mercy on my soul, a fallen cook I used shredded cheese. Never mind they were wonderful. Mixed by hand, so I made 2 single batches for a larger group.Second time I've made these.

This is a wonderful, basic dinner roll recipe that is very easy to make. The addition of the parmesan cheese gives it a nice twist. I used buttermilk in place of the milk and this made for a rich and tangy taste. The texture of the finished rolls is superb. Made for a dinner party and got rave reviews. This is definitely a keeper!

We didn't care for these rolls. They did have plenty of parmesan flavor, and by upping the salt to 1 1/2 tsp, they had plenty of salt flavor, but they were very heavy - I thought they would be flaky because of the "pull-apart" name, but that wasn't so. I wouldn't make them again, and I'm still searching for a great flaky, soft dinner roll....

We didn't care for the cheese in the bread...tasted funky. I'll try again without the cheese, and will baste with melted butter, olive oil, salt, garlic powder, fresh minced garlic, parsley and then sprinke with parm. cheese once the rolls are done. This would be similar to a pull apart bread we like at a restaurant in Canada.

Don't ruin these with parmesan! We make these for breakfast and eat with jam or honey. Very easy, especially if you make the dough in your bread machine.

This is Perfect!! i just added 1/8-1/4 extra Parmesan cheese and that took care of the lack of salt! It is soo soo easy and just goes perfect with soup!

You gotta be kiddin me. These were so good.....You can skip the rest of your planned menu, because once you taste these you'll just want to finish the whole pan!

Easy and delicious. This would be a great introduction to bread making for a beginner.

These rolls had a great texture and were easy to make but totally flavorless at the end, even after making them with double the amount of cheese. I think I will save this as a base recipe but will have to find a way to impart more flavor to them.

I make my own brioche weekly so these rolls in comparison were very easy to put together for a weeknight dinner. The parmesan flavor was stronger while the rolls were still warm but as they cooled it wasn't as apparent. I would make them again but maybe sub some fresh herbs in lieu of the parm and then top with a little salt after the egg wash.

For a novice bread baker, like myself, these were relatively easy to make. They certainly take a while to beat, rise, etc. and perfect for a lazy day. They were very brioche like -- probably because I accidentally put in all three eggs into the mixture. They tasted great though. Also, I omitted the cheese because I eat way too much of the stuff and added a little extra course salt into the mix and on top of the rolls before baking. Delicious.

These were excellent... I bake all of our bread products and these were just too easy! Nice brioche like crumb and very flavorful.

These rolls have a fabulous, airy interior. The question is whether or not you like the parmesan overtones. I really enjoyed it, while my sweetheart did not. So, I'd say the recipe is solid and the decision to make them is a matter of taste.

Delicious. Messy dough to work with. Next time I will roll the dough in melted garlic butter with some chopped parsley to produce melt in your mouth garlic rolls.

These rolls smelled heavenly while baking. Overall they were very simple to make. But, in the end, they were severely lacking in flavor - especially salt. After applying the egg wash I sprinkled the rolls with some coarse sea salt and a few grinds of fresh black pepper (b/c who doesn't love parmesan and black pepper). The crusts were delicious - it was the interior that was lacking. I would try these again - and maybe add in more cheese or additional salt. Not sure if they're a keeper just yet.
