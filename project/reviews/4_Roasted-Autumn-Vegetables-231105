Puzzlingly mediocre. Would have been awesome had I skipped the red onion, chives, and vinegar, and just added S&P. I'll see if these perfectly roasted but unfortunately seasoned veggies are salvageable by transmogrifying them into the soup another reviewer mentioned.

This was surprisingly good. I got some rutabagas in my produce box this week and had never made them before, so I decided to try this recipe to use them up. Even with the good ratings, I was a little skeptical, but it turned out really good. I have to admit I didn't follow it exactly. I didn't have apple cider vinegar so I used white balsalmic vinegar. I also added a little fresh rosemary, and I had 2 parsnips to use up so I threw those in too. I expected it to be bland but it was not. The ceyenne pepper and vinegar combo gave it good flavor. It was great!

I used carrots, squash, and a few shallots. Added 1/8th tsp each of cumin and cayenne, and about 1.5TB of olive oil / balsamic at the end. (To tame the balsamic tang.) My in laws are pretty conservative eaters but they loved it as much as I did. One error: I was worried about the cooking time, and cut everything smaller than 1/2 inch wide. It wasn't necessary, and we ended up with some rather small pieces. If you add carrots to the mix it's a good idea to put them in first (20 min in my case, at 450).

I wasn't sure about using Rutabaga, but I decided to, only because I'm not that familiar with it and it was a pleasant surprise. It's best to freeze the rutabaga first and when it's super cold, you can cut it easily..like a melon and then once it's quartered, or halved, peel with a straight veggie peeler and cube. You can eat it raw with crudite, for a sweeter taste but roasted, it adds a nice depth to the combo of veggies. I sprinkled a little cinnamon on the end and have been craving this for days. I served it at a dinner party for 8 incl 3 kids that weren't into squash and they liked it very much..

I made this last year and thought it was pretty good. I think if I make it again I will try subbing balsamic vinegar for the apple cider vinegar. When I did make it, I used Asian pumpkin in place of the butternut squash since that is unavailable here. And I brushed the vegetables with olive oil rather than vegetable oil. You couldn't even tell the difference in taste in the end.

I had this at a friends house and it was delicious. In fact two of us will be making it for our families for Thanksgiving. It was a hit!

I tripled this recipe for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a success. The tiny amount of cayenne pepper perfectly compliments the earthy vegetables.

Wow--can't believe how good & easy this was! I swapped parsnips for rutabagas but otherwise followed the recipe--really delicious. It would be good with many kinds of vinegar... I might try adding cinnamon next time, with balsamic at the end. Try this, you'll love it!

Very tasty dish. I made it for a family party and everyone liked it. Lots of compliments! Great side dish for almost any meal. We made it to go with a london broil and also grilled swordfish, and crabs all in the same meal.....very versatile.

Hate to be the detractor with reading such rave reviews, but I served this to 10 people at Thanksgiving, and had 9 servings left over. None was taken other than the obligatory "taste". I personally love all these veggies, but found this to be bland, dull and although the flavors were intense, not one I would ever make again. I have much better uses for these three great vegetables.

I made this dish for Thanksgiving with mixed reviews. It has an "earthy" flavor and many in the family do not care for such vegetables. Granted, I changed up a couple of things - no rutabegas, added parsnips and sweet potatoes. But here is the redemption - I used the leftovers to make BUTTERNUT SQUASH SOUP WITH CIDER CREAM (from Epicurious.com). The soup was a huge hit and I was told that "this is the way fall veggies should be served". The soup recipe has to be tweeked a little to use the roasted veggies from this recipe, but it was not a huge change. So, in summary this recipe was good, and well liked by some, but the soup was fabulous!

Delightful.

I didn't have apple cider vinegar so I used cranberry vinegar which was very tasty. A nice amount of spice without being overpowering. Leftovers were a great ingredient in soup.

The squash and sweet yams cooked faster than the rutabega. I had to use much more oil to keep it moist and I also put foil around it so that it would not dry out. I also put a little too much cayenne pepper on it thinking it needed spice. Just remember a little goes a long way.

I have made this dish on several occasions and it never fails. I occasionally substitute ground chipotle pepper for the cayenne and both versions are delicious.

I love this recipe. I've made it time and time again. It goes well with roasted meats and it is easy to prepare. Just peel, dice, roast, and serve.

excellent as written-I too cut smaller pieces to shorten prep time

A Thanksgiving winner! When I saw the recipe in the magazine, I assigned it to a friend to cook for our group dinner. We added a couple of parsnips too, a mistake that turned out great. The vinegar and onion at the end does something wonderful. Everyone loved it!

Very easy to make, and as the others states, one can increase or decrease the heat by adjusting the pepper. Presents nicely with the different colors of the vegetables. Even the grandkids ate this. A winner for sure

Very the recipe by changing the heat (more or less cayenne) and also try others like cumin. The dressing really finishes the veggies well. If you use turnip (like I did) either lengthen the cooking time or make smaller dice of the turnip. Great Fall side.

Excellent! Easy to make and so delicious. I'm not crazy about rutabagas, so I substituted diced red potatoes. Tested the recipe on my family, and they raved about it. We loved the crispy edges of the sweet and red potatoes. I loved the contrast between the warmth of the cayenne pepper and the sweetness of the squash and sweet potatoes. I wasn't sure they'd like the vinegar/onion dressing, but it was great! (Cook's note: it was even better before I added the dressing. Next time I'll serve it tossed with a touch of olive oil, onions and chives.) Either way, it passed the taste test with flying colors, and will go on to the big family Thanksgiving dinner.

Very simple yet delicious. I served it as a side dish for roast chicken with herbs. My husband has a distaste for butternut squash, but he loved it!
