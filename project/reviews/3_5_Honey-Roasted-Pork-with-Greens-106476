I LOVE this recipe, I switch up the lemon juice to 2 of lime juice and 3 of orange. My family loves it!

Light, fruity, delicious! A Greek version of sweet and sour, with honey and lemon. The chard was the perfect green! The only change I made was to sauté some garlic in the oil prior to sautéing the chard. The sauce is au jus, and should be watery.

Honest good recipe. Liked it would use it for every day meal.

Flavor-wise, we really enjoyed this. However, the amount of broth is too much, since you end up with way more "sauce" than needed. I even reduced it on the stove a bit and it was still way too much. We'll make it again, but I'll be tweaking the recipe.

I rated this dish three forks to compromise I thought it was worth two, my family said 4. It was very tender, but I did not care for the sweetness of the meat, all I could taste was honey. My family on the other hand adored it. I will make this recipe again for them, but fix myself something different.

Although I did a few variations on the recipe (no greens, used all the marinade on the roast, added a large, quartered sweet onion to juices as well as cooking longer after reducing temp to 350), there was no doubt that this is a "keeper" recipe. Browned to perfection and very moist, it was complimented by adding a bit of cornstarch to the liquid in the pan for a thin gravy. Definitely a big hit for an intimate New Year's Eve dinner!

Loved this! It was so tasty and easy. The combination of the honey, lemon, herbs and greens was delicious.

Absolutely delicious, and the juice was incredible. Due to scheduling the pork marinated overnight, but this did not seem to be a problem. I roasted mine on a flat rack above a full carton of broth and the marinade in the roasting pan, so it stayed nicely moist, and I could put in a temperature probe and walk away until it was done. I don't think the basting would have improved upon success. Next time I may use heather honey, which I think would blend beautifully with the other flavors. Although I am a big fan of greens, these greens were nothing special.

My family and I don't typically enjoy pork, but thought we would try something different. This was amazing and earned rave reviews along with several recipe requests. I skipped the "greens" protion and only used 1/2 cup of the broth. I reduced the juices and thickened it up using a little corn starch and water.

absolutely delicious, I wouldn't change a thing.

We loved this even with a not-so-prime piece of pork. I added some ground cloves to the marinade and drastically reduced the thyme -1-1/2t is far too much (IMO) even if you use fresh thyme. I used about two pinches of dried thyme. I also added some apple juice instead of chicken broth to the final reduction of the sauce (which I did reduce over high heat and added a little beurre manie for thickener). I cooked the chard in the remnants of the sauce, in the pan in which the pork had cooked. My husband gobbled up this one.

This was delicious! I made it with a boneless Boston butt that was on special. I only had coriander seeds, so I crushed them in a mortar. Otherwise I pretty much followed the recipe, but used more like half a can of chicken broth to assure moisture. Served it on chard from my friend's garden and mashed potatoes. Great combo of the sweet meat and bitterish greens!

I thought that this was an excellent recipe. The flavors were good together and out-of-the-ordinary. It also made a beautiful presentation. The only two problems I found were: 1- The price of the roast 2- The sauce was runny Otherwise, I loved it and I am making it again tomorrow.

I did not care for the overpowering thyme in this recipe. It might be ok if it was left out

Flavorful and moist, a good comfort food. I made this for a Saturday family dinner. Wife and daugthers liked it a great deal, 2 year old asked for more which is rare. I thought it was good, but not spectacular. I would serve it again for dinner at home, but not for guests. Cooking time was longer than indicated, probably because of the shape of my roast.
