This is an amazing stew! I have cooked it 3 times now but the last time I made some modifications that really worked well. I added a parsnip and 3 leeks, cooking the white end of the leeks in the pan with the onions and garlic. I also increased the spices (minus the cayenne and paprika per my wife's request) by 25%. I served over couscous, adding more of the spices to the couscous before serving.

I followed this recipe pretty closely, adding the specified amounts of sugar and spices, etc. Based on previous reviews, however, I did add a handful of lentils and some diced potato because I also thought it looked a little too soupy. This was a fabulous stew, which I served over mashed potatoes.

I gave this four forks, but I made some pretty significant alterations after reading some of the other reviews. I only added 1 Tbs of brown sugar, since the consensus was that it was too sweet. I also didn't quite use 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. About an hour before it was ready, I added a cup of green lentils and 1 cubed baking potato, and it made the stew really thick and rich. We served it over rice, with a side of homemade peach chutney (with lots of ginger) and passed a bowl of fresh chopped mint for freshness. Everyone absolutely loved it. I think if I'd had some chopped cashews or peanuts, that would have been a nice garnish as well.

this is a delicious stew. initially thought it was too sweet, but then tried it the next day and it was perfect. i ground the green peppercorns (which add a lot of spicy heat!) and also topped it with fresh a italian parsley upon serving over brown rice. yummy!

This recipe is really delicious and the perfect end to a chilly day! I added 2 slices of finely sliced bacon for some smoky flavor, but it really didn't need it at all. Leg of lamb works just as well as the shoulder. The sauce is not too sweet and with a nice spicy kick to it. It was nice served with some sour cream. It simmered for about 2 hours because we were getting hungry and the sauce was fairly thick, so 2- 2.5 hours slow cook is correct. I made this for myself and my fiance and his review was this: "It's one of the few best things that came from the internet!"

absolutely fantastic flavors in this stew. Even the kids came back for seconds. Very, very tender after cooking over slow heat...Will definitely make this again.

This is a sweet stew thanks to the brown sugar. I really liked the spices and sweetness. You can get away with a 1.5 hour simmer if you make sure to stick with shoulder cut, and go slightly smaller in the cubes. Tasted fine even with veg. stock substitution, but it could use some potatoes.

This was a delicious way to use up 1/2 a lef-over lamb leg. Lamb is my favorite meat, and I love stews. The spices in this recipe were perfect. I used Cayenne pepper, and it just bites. Might add a bit more the next time. I used 1 more carrot, and now recommend three additional. I also added about three tablespoons of flout mixed with water the day after making, since I found the sauce too thin. (Be sure to cook 5 minutes to get rid of starchy taste.) I served it in large pasta bowls with a big helping of spinach and regular couscous cooked together. For a change, to use up leftovers, I served the stew over some boiled white potatoes. Not great that way. Perhaps potatoes cooked in the stew would work.

I like this recipe. I only used half the brown sugar (could always add it), and thought it was great the way it was. My Ciuba cooked a little soupy and the noodles were a great excuse to eat the sauce.

I mostly liked this stew, but would make it next time without the brown sugar, or with maybe just a tiny bit. It was too sweet for my taste.

Despite the raves, I agree with the other cook from Virginia. The spices made an unappetizing sludge that neither smelled nor tasted good, despite high-quality ingredients and an unusually strict adherence to the recipe. I had an idea of what this was supposed to taste like and it just didn't. This is the first epicurious recipe I have been disappointed in.

I made this recipe with leg of lamb, rather than shoulder. Have cooked for 2 hours and meat is dry. Should I just stop cooking and eat as is or keep cooking and hope meat will get more tender?

I served this with couscous and it was wonderful....i also found that it needed thickening so when I re-heated it (I made it a day ahead) i added a slurry and it turned out perfectly....my guests loved it

Ultimate comfort food. I followed directions as is and it turned out wonderful. The wine is important, choose one that will support the lamb. I served mine over couscous, will certainly make this again!

I will add this recipe to my personal chef menu. I know we all make changes to recipes. I had just gone to Whole Foods near my home and purchased some wonderful lamb and in addition to the lamb I purchased a spicy lamb sausage. The spices in the sausage were similar to the ones called for in this recipe so I don't think it changed the basic structure and flavor of the stew. It is outstanding. Full of flavor and truly a comfort food. Great recipe!

This is an amazing recipe. The flavor is perfect. I diced the carrots and celery very very thinly because I wanted a more subtle vegetable presence. I served over Basmati rice - this is comfort food at its best.

I followed the recipe and loved the results!! I did not end up with too much sauce at all, but if I had, would have just reduced what I had and concentrated the flavors even more. Loved the spice flavors!!! Will definitely repeat this!

I have made this again and again and it's always delicious. It needs to cook long enough to thicken...and I grind the green peppercorns before putting them in (wouldn't be the same without them!). Serve with rice.

I've made this at least 10 times (always to rave reviews). It's a very easy, as well as forgiving recipe. However, I omit the peppercorns and wine. To those that found it too watery.......just continue to simmer partially covered, it won't overcook. Sometimes I like to add a tiny bit extra of the spices when it's almost done - or toss cubed potatoes in to make it heartier. Also, some fresh cilantro on top before serving will really compliment this dish.

I followed some of the other reviewers suggestions. I halved the wine and stock and it was the right amount of sauce for the dish, not swimming in extra sauce like others suggested. I added some zucchini the last 15 minutes and left out the peppercorns. This dish is very aromatic when cooking and tasted good. Can't wait to try the leftovers tonight!

I make this with ground lamb and make meatballs and then treat them just like the lamb pieces (ground lamb is easy to find). It's wonderful, but leave out the whole peppercorns, or you'll have a mouthful of buckshot with each bite.

I made this for a family of cinnamon lovers, but it was disappointing. The seasonings were overwhelming, eclipsing the flavor of the meat entirely. Also, there was at least a quart of sauce in the pot at the end, way too much and a waste of wine and broth. Altogether, this was not anything I will make again.

I left out the celery and my fiancee said that this dish was missing something........like celery. Hmmmmm..... so I guess it really does belong in the ingredients. We liked it. Definitely a different twist on lamb. Super spicy and an unusual flavor compared to Mediterranean style lamb dishes which we usually make. I'd recommend that you try this! My guests ate it all with sides of basmati rice.

This is very very good! I left out the celery and used the meat from lamb shanks. I also added about an inch of peeled, finely chopped fresh ginger. I cooked it for about 4 hours. It was delicious served over cous cous.

I made this once with lamb and it was wonderful (a 3+). Then, I made it again, but with venison, and it was downright fabulous (4, most definitely a 4). NB I think cooked celery is vile, so I omitted that both times and used a little more carrot.

I first got this recipe on 12/20/00 and have already made it again for guests. Everyone I serve it to loves it! Even my kids love it. My son wanted to know if we could make it every week!

Didn't care for the combination of spices - especially the cinnamon & cloves.

I used leg of lamb because I couldn't find shoulder. It was incredibly tender and delicious, especially when served a day or two after making it and letting it simmer twice as long. I've served this several times to guests, served on rice, with aspergus and always get rave reviews.

Great combination of flavors. Good over couscous or rice.

A lovely, aromatic stew which can be prepared on the stovetop and finished in the oven. I increased the thyme and spices by 50%. Serving it in soup bowls over basmati rice, sprinkled with some finely chopped flat-leaf parsley, makes a nice presentation. A simple green salad and warm baguette rounded out the meal.
