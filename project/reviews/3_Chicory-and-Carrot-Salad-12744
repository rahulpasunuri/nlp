This reminds me of a salad common in the Rhine/Eiffel regions of Germany during the holidays. Very similar except use salad oil instead of olive oil and replace the mustard with 1/2 teaspoon of poppy seeds. Add sugar to taste (it should be slightly sweet) and garnish with chopped cashews. Makes a really nice, simple, refreshing side dish to a holiday meal.
