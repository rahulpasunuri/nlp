This was good but nothing special. I doubt I'll make it again.

This was bland and boring. I just made it as an easy extra dish for a salad buffet, and it still fell short.

This recipe was great with a few additions. I brought it to a footbal tailgate. I added red kidney beans and used 1/4 cup canola oil, 1/4 cup cider vinegar (instead of the oil & vinegar in the recipe)and 2-3 packets of Splenda. I also added the leftovers to a Spinach salad a few days later.

Prepared the recipe a day before it was served, yet it remained relatively flavorless despite efforts to bring it to life.

This was a perfect dish to make during a NY heatwave. Quick, easy, and Deeeeelish.
