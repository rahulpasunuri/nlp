I changed this a little since I wanted more than 2 servings and didn't have all the ingredients. I used romano instead of parmesan and subbed garlic and parsley for the scallion in the meatballs. And I first mixed the egg and breadcrumbs and a little water and let that sit for a little before adding the other ingredients. I browned them in the same pot used to make the soup but I think next time I won't bother. For the soup, I omitted the onion and used 5 chopped carrots instead, which I didn't bother to saute. And I omitted the rosemary. The soup is FANTASTIC with the garlic added at the end. Do not leave it out!

Very nice, a whole meal in one dish. Go easy on the raw garlic and lemon at the end as it can easily overwhelm the dish. I found the meatballs to be a little dull, so I spiked them with a little aleppo pepper and some of the rosemary the second time.

Love this recipe, have made it exactly as is and my whole family devours it! I have a few picky eaters and they love the Turkey meatballs!

I've been making this soup since it was first published and it is always a very satisfying winter meal. I also like to add cooked white beans to the soups.

Delicious! As always, I fooled with the recepe to make it work with what I had on hand - in this case, a turkey carcase, greens from my garden, and limes from my lime tree. The soup base was stock from the turkey carcase. Meat salvaged from the cooked bones was the basis for the meatballs. (I added celery salt and ground chipotle pepper to the meatball mix to make up for the overcooked meat - the result was light textured and very flavorful.) instead of escarole I used fresh garden greens - mostly Asian mustard and mizuna. The addition of the garlic and salt paste and lime juice at the end of the cooking made a lively dash of taste on top of the well-simmered flavors. YUM!! and Healthy!

I love the simple flavors, yet when I bite into a meatball I get a garlicky surprise. I forgot to put in the rosemary, oil and onions but it was still delicious. This recipe is so simple to make, you just throw all the ingredients into the pot and let it cook for a little while.

Delicious soup! I took some others' advice and browned the meatballs in the same pot and added a can of white beans. Served with crusty french bread, this makes a hearty meal for a cold night.

Cooked meatballs first in a hot oven and used whole wheat orzo which added a nice nutty flavor. Definitely agree with idea of grating cheese on top at time of serving. Good recipe to cook on a Sunday and serve during the work week.

Loved this soup! Took the advice of other reviewers and made two changes: (1) cooked the meatballs first in the same pot used to cook the soup and (2) added a can of white beans. I definitely recommend adding the beans. My husband raved over this recipe. Great for a light dinner.

My friend who doesn't like turkey loves this recipe. We had it as a main course for dinner. Very good.

I must have made a mistake somewhere...I love the flavor of rosemary, but it completely overpowered the soup. I did use dried, but used the amount called for. hmmm. I would try this again, though, with fresh rosemary. The meatballs were excellent and saved the recipe.

I loved the rosemary flavor. I omitted the pasta for a lighter dish. I will definately make this again.

Rating: 3
Delicious, light, adaptable and easy. I didn't have orzo, so I used rice - which I sauteed with the onions, and substituted spinach for escarole. I tripled up on the rosemary, garlic and lemon juice. My husband proclaimed it "tasty", which he rarely does - high praise. Perfect for a cold night, like tonight. I'll surely make it again.

I've never made anything with escarole before, so maybe it's just me, but this soup reminded me of wet lettuce in thin, non-flavorful broth. The only edible part was the meatballs, which I made using ground veal instead of turkey. My husband thought it was "ok", but let's just say the extras went down the sink (except the meatballs which I picked out).

Rating: 3
Great, simple recipe. However, try these modifications: - Brown the meatballs first and use the same pan for the soup. The meatball residue adds great flavor; - Add a can of diced tomoatoes for extra color and flavor; - Top with parmesan cheese.

This is the best soup! I have made it twice since discovering it and that was last week. I used 1 pkg. of frozen spinach, thawed and drained well, instead of the escarole. I used tiny pasta which I cooked separately and then added to the soup.

Have made this numerous times. I usually omit the orzo, not finding it necessary. However, it is very important to do the lemon/garlic/salt finish to fully bring out all the flavors.

Super tasty and quite easy. A definate keeper.

This soup was delicious! I also used 4 cups of broth instead of 3 1/2, and added more lemon juice which gave it a very fresh taste. I only had 3 cups of escarole but actually think there would have been too much had I added 6. A great dish for someone who lives alone because it doesn't make too much.

Rating: 4
Incredible! This dish far exceeded my expectations. (A helpful hint when rolling the meatballs: wet your hands first with water & the turkey will roll nice & firmly & will not stick to your hands!) Can't wait to make it again.

I love this soup and have made it many times. I double the recipe and drop the uncooked little meatballs into the broth to cook, rather than cook than separately. I also season the meatballs with salt and pepper and add a but more parmesan than called for. A really good soup.

This is great soup! I'd suggest using 4 cups rather than 3.5 of the broth, but other than that, this is a really tasty soup that is virtually painless to make!

This soup was perfect comfort food. I made some variations to suit my picky family. I did not use chopped onion and just went straight to a saute of the escarole to which I added 2 chopped garlic cloves. I did not add the rosemary and I cooked the meatballs right in the broth. Everyone loved it, even those who do not like greens.

Rating: 3
The meatballs were great and I will definitely make them again. However, the escarole gave the soup a somewhat bitter/metallic taste. As a whole, it was a homey dish, but not particularly interesting.

Rating: 4
I have made this recipe numerous times, it's always a winner. I add lemon zest & garlic (I'm a garlic nut)to the meatballs, loved it! I make sure to use ground turkey breast w/o skin. I undercook the orzo, separately & add it to the bottom of the bowl, so it doesn't drink up all of the broth. Many a sick friend has thanked me for this lucious treat!

Given the ingredients, I thought this soup would be spectacular. It was good, but not transcendent. I even used great homemade chicken stock, and yet, until the reggiano was added at the point of serving, it was actually bland, not subtle, just bland. I will make it again, but next time I will increase the rosemary a bit, add more garlic and kosher salt, some lemon, a few splashes of pino grigio and marry it with some e.v.o.o. at the end. I'm guessing those additions will give it the kick it needs.

This soup is wonderful. I added a bit of garlic and some very finely chopped mushroom to the meatballs to keep them moist. I browned them also. I'm just wondering how this soup freezes..

This soup warms the soul. However, I made few minor adjustments. I doubled the recipe; cooked the meatballs first and used the great brown stuff for cooking the onions, rosemary and escarole (I also added some crushed red pepper to the mix). Finally, I added a can of rinsed white beans for more substance.

after reading the reviews for this recipe, i decided to give it a try. this is my first attempt at making soup and i must say how impressed i was with the results. this recipe is very easy and doesn't require too much time in the kitchen. the ingredients are a great combination and the soup came out absolutely delicious. this recipe is a keeper and i plan on making it again.

This was a great cold weather soup. The escarole at the store looked bad so I used spinach instead and it was great. The meatballs are really good, I added extra parm and garlic into the meatball mixture instead of at the end. I also didn't have any orzo so I used rice pilaf and I think the spice mixture really added to it.

Incredible! I made a couple of substitions that worked great. I added pesto to the meatballs, and used a box of frozen chopped collards instead of the escarole. My whole family loved it, I will be making this again, for sure.

I doubled the recipe. The family liked this soup very much. It was pretty effortless compared to most soups. Used Swiss Chard instead of escarole. I baked the meatballs for 10 minutes on 400F to brown them slightly, but agree with a previous reviewer that you probably don't even need to do that...just drop them in your broth to cook. I like my pasta al dente, even in soup, so I cooked the orzo separately---placed a spoon full in each soup bowl, then added the soup to the orzo---that way the orzo doesn't expand in the soup pot. Healthy and tasty soup. Has been permanently added to our Winter menu as well.

A very quick and easy dinner. i made a few changes taht iwas very happy with. I didn't have scallions for the meatballs-- so I used about 1/4 cup of minced shallots and a good amount of flat-leaf parsley. I also added white beans to the soup, to make it a little more hearty and it was great.

Beyond compare...the meatballs plus soup and time of preparation is super..there is a slight difference between BLAND and knowing that a great soup can be light and subtle..take it from an old cooking teacher at age 70..Loved the use of watercress and cooking the meatballs in the oven

This soup is so good the night I cooked it, after I went to bed, the smell of it woke me up and I dreamed about it. I varied it a bit to suit my tastes: More escarole, garlic, lemon, broth, meatballs...basically kicked it up a notch measurement-wise. Also, as another reviewer said fresh rosemary and garlic are key. Parmesan on every bowl and crushed red pepper. Awesome soup!

OUTSTANDING RECIPE! My man won't eat anything green and loved this soup. It is THE Gourmet Chicken Soup. I now make it all the time and have plenty in the freezer for those nights when I don't feel like cooking. It is the meal. I don't fry or bake the meatballs -- just throw them in. I don't know anyone who doesn't like this soup. 12 forks.

The meatballs were bland, there was not enough stock, the escarole bland... the whole dish screamed for seasonings. I should have done what the last poster did: Change everything!!!

Rating: 3
This is a variation (which I have not tried yet)on a dish we always have as a first course with our holiday meals. We do not use the escarole but substitute sliced carrots and celery instead. We also do not use the rosemary (although it sounds interesting!) and use a traditional Italian meatball recipe for the mini meatballs. We can never make enough to have leftovers (sadly) as everyone loves it. You MUST top it (after serving) with a healthy sprinkling of good Pecorino Romano cheese for that extra YUM factor (Locatelli recomended). Try this, you won't be disappointed!!!

This soup was a success with my family, and my vegetable-shunning 11 year old had two helpings with lots of escarole. I took the excellent suggestion to bake, not fry, the meatballs, on foil in the oven -- less fat, less work, came out great. I served this with Confetti Salad and Ranch Dressing from this website, and whole grain bread, for a complete dinner.

This soup is wonderful. Instead of browning the meatballs I put them on a foil lined baking sheet and baked them in the oven for about 10 min. @ 350. I also substituted spinich for the escarole--it came out very well. My family loved it--will absolutely make it again!

This is a wonderful healthy recipe, but my daughter doesn't like garlic so I omitted the garlic paste part. I also did not use orzo, but added my own preference of pasta. I did use more escarole than the recipe called for and I skipped the browning of the meatballs, just dropping them into the hot soup and simmering. My daughter and her friends all loved it and so did I!!!!
