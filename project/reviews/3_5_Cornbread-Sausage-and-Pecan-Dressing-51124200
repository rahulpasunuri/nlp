This is by far, the best stuffing recipe I have ever made. My guests all raved. Very favorful and I will definitely make it again. I made no changes but did use dried rosemary, sage and thyme, paying close attention to the conversion amounts for fresh vs dried. It does have a lot of steps but I thought it was well worth the effort.

Every year I've been trying new dressing recipes and this is truly the very, very best. I'm surprised we had any dressing left when we were ready to serve it. With that being said, I would make the dressing according to the recipe (two boxes of Jiffy mix)but use dried spices if you don't have the fresh and forget the rosemary. After you have mixed it and before you add the 2 eggs. Leave it alone. You are done. At this stage everyone went on and on about the dressing. I put the 2 eggs in and cooked it according to directions. Results so much less. The taste was flatten. Next year I'm going to make it without the eggs. May consider warming it and if so put a little chicken broth in for moisture. If I don't warm the dressing, I'll just put the gravy on it. Outstanding!!!!

I also omitted the pecans and used a little extra herbs with very good results. I made my own cornbread a few days before, let it sit out to dry, then toasted. One thing I will do differently next time...I will cut the cornbread into smaller cubes. I will definitely use this recipe again.

This was just OK. The herb combination is good, but I cannot say this dressing was all that great. I think if I were to make it again, I would not use the Jiffy mix.

For years I have searched for the perfect stuffing and have finally found it. I followed the recipe exactly (used the pecans). I love that you can make it a day ahead, which I did, and it still turned out great. My daughter said it tasted like lobster (I guess b/c it's so buttery!). Definitely a keeper.

I loved the sweet-savory flavors of this recipe. I made 1 box of Krusteaz honey corn bread the day before and let it sit on the counter. The next morning, I torn the cornbread into large chuncks. When I was ready to make the dressing, I toasted the cornbread as directed. I omitted the pecans but increased the fresh herbs to 1-1/2 TBS each. I also omitted the eggs. The result was a very flavorful, moist dressing. Will definitely repeat this one.

Took a good amount of time to prepare this stuffing, with many separate steps, and outcome was just so-so. Directions are a bit confusing regarding baking day ahead vs. day of eating. Some of our Thanksgiving guests loved it, but I thought it didn't have much flavor.
