I tested them after 12 minutes. Since they weren't done, I kept them in the oven for 2 more minutes. Then 2 more minutes. Eventually they had been in the oven for 24 minutes and they still fell! Did anyone figure out what we did wrong? The taste was fabulous, but I'm sure they would be better without a giant hole in the middle.

This is in my regular entertaining list of dessert options. Everytime I make it I get rave reviews (and the occasional outright moan!) I prefer making in large 10 oz ramekins which leave plenty of space for a big scoop of vanilla ice cream. Perhaps not as fancy as the vanilla whipped cream, but it sure hits the spot!

I have made this three times for company and each and every time it gets rave reviews - love it - especially since it is so easy as well!

I'm with the cook from Las Cruces--mine too flopped in the middle as they cooled. Perhaps this was my fault. I didn't have ramekins so I used small individual aluminum pie plates. The longer I beat the egg/sugar mixture, the lighter it became as more air was introduced. It did not get thick at all. I also think that there was not enough flour in the mixture to hold the pudding together. Also, when testing it for doneness, how can there be "moist crumbs"? I may try this again with some serious modifications, as the taste was DELICIOUS.

Not sure what happened, but 15 min after they came out of the oven they all collapsed in the ramekins and looked awful. Taste was okay, but sure didn't please the eye.
