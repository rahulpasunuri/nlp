I made this because we have a serious amount of basil in the garden and are looking for uses for it. I love herbal cocktails - I usually make simple syrups from rosemary, lavender and ginger for cocktails but thought I would try this. I used raw sugar, which I don't recommend; it gives the syrup a unappetizing brown color. I shook it with ice and rum and it is okay but something about it just isn't quite right. It could be the color but it might be that it tastes just a little too much like a pesto mojito. I'll stick with rosemary in the future.

I take this syrup, chill it, and then shake it in a martini shaker with ice. Then, I pour it into a martini glass with diet tonic water. I call it my Thai-tini Spritzer. My foodie-friends and I love it!

Absolutely delicious in a drink. I attended a cooking show with Sara Moultons, and the drink was served in between the foods we tested.

This was so refreshing and easy! Made this for two pregnant women at a party, but ended up being loved by all.

This syrup is delicious, and makes an excellent cocktail when mixed with vodka and seltzer. Very refreshing in the summer!

Please note that straining should be done with rinsed and squeezed cheesecloth, not paper towels. The latter doesn't allow the syrup to pass through at all. This syrup is delicious with fresh mango.
