This recipe is very under-seasoned. I doubled the cumin, coriander, and turmeric, and I added a cinnamon stick. I also added a cup of chickpeas that had been soaked overnight and then boiled for a half-hour by themselves. In addition, I added a half cup of currants, but I might choose a more assertive dried fruit next time. I cut down the preserved lemon a bit, but still used most of a small lemon. The cooking time is very understated for the carrots and turnips--they take 50 to 60 minutes to get tender. Add the yams after cooking the other vegetables for about 15 minutes so the yams do not get too soft.

I think that this dish could be spectacular with one subtraction and several additions: 1. Subtract the recipe for preserved lemons - it resulted in an overly bitter taste which almost ruined the dish. Instead I would in the future recommend 1/2 cup of lemon juice plus the grated rind of one lemon - avoiding the bitter pith. 2. Add some dried fruits to the dish to round it out: dried prunes, golden raisins, apricots, even dates - all add a sweet note and a bright color to the dish.

This recipe took a lot more than 1 3/4 hours to prepare and was a huge disappointment. Since the ingredient list (which I had shopped from) didn't include the lemon for the preserved lemon, I used only lemon juice from the half I had left in the fridge. Wish I had read the reviews about adding flavor. This was flat. In terms of ROI of time and energy, this dish just wasn't a good use of mine.

Bummer! I had such high hopes for this recipe. I made it a day ahead to let the flavors meld, as other reviewers suggested. However, I found that despite all of the herbs and aromatic spices, it was kind of flat.

The crunchy chick peas were the best part of this recipe. The root vegetable tagine was very bland. It needed WAY more spice. I would make this again but up the spices a lot. I served this on quinoa pilaf instead of cous cous to make it gluten free and used left over preserved lemon for a salad dressing for arugula and pomegranate salad.

For the most part, I followed this recipe to a T (I don't usually), and it is AMAZING. Many thanks to the cooks who mentioned the recipe calls for slices from one lemon for the preserving. I used a whole, small lemon and the flavor was perfect. Deviations: Didn't have caraway seeds or sun-dried tomatoes so didn't add those. Used fresh mint instead of dried as that's what I had on hand. AND, I added a cinnamon stick to the pot, as well as a large handful of chopped prunes, and probably a cup of chopped almonds. The flavor is incredible, my house smells amazing, and I struggled to keep from eating all of the roasted chickpeas before eating. I agree with others that the flavor only improves with time. I can't wait for more tonight!

Yum, yum, yum!!! I made this over a bed of israeli coucous and it's fantastic!!!

So delicious. I made Quinoa instead of couscous. I enjoyed this plate very much. I added raisins to it at the table, and I think the sweet taste from he raisins completed the dish. I loved the crackling and popping sound the chic peas made when I poured the tangine over them. So crunchy, it was a good change from the normally soft cooked chic peas dish.

I made this recipe wiht a lot of changes and it was amazing. I did not put in the sweet potato, potato, or sundied tomatoes. Used chicken broth, a leek, and only one salted lemon. I added some fennel seeds to the spice mix and also just cooked chickpeas and added them into the stew as is. It ended up begin really fantastic. So thank you for the inspiration.

Might try it with the caveats from others, but where are the lemon slices, in Ingredient List? If using preserved lemon at all, I think it's better to purchase a jar of high quality preserved lemons. There are some excellent brands available.

Yummy! Roasted chickpeas are a home run. Since my husband is diabetic I substituted butternut squash for the sweet potato. I bet it is even better with it.

I would definitely cut down on the preserved lemon; the dish had an overwhelming sourness to me. I used broth instead of water. I would recommend the broth and starting out with less lemon (and adding to taste) to anyone who wanted to try the recipe.

Solid, but it's a lot of work. I used 6 thin slices of lemon with the peel for the perserves and it was perfect. Will probably try this again to see if I can figure out a couple of shortcuts. Definitely recommend going with a flavored couscous for some added dimension.

Thoroughly enjoyed this dish. Although many steps well worth the effort. I used lemon juice, boiled down and lemon peel, rather than lemon preserves, and added them to taste. Also added some sugar, about 2 tablespoons. Really yummy dish and will definitely make it again!

I loved this dish and looked forward to making it again. The preserved lemons were confusing. They were not listed in the ingredient list, then directions for making did not list quantity. This recipe could be intimidating to a new cook, but is really just a series of steps, well worth it.

I made it exactly as printed in the magazine, but I should have read these reviews. Everything was fine until the preserved lemon came in. Others have said that their lemons were tart, but mine was painfully bitter. I had to add an incredible amount of salt and sugar just to make it edible. However, I do believe that adding a bit more of the spice mixture and cutting the lemon by at least half should make it worth trying again.

Delicious and hearty recipe. The spices gave it a wonderful depth. Don't skip the pickled lemon, it's worth it, though I used 1/2-3/4 of what was suggested in the recipe and found the tagine to be adequately tart. The cooking time was 15-20 mins longer than noted for me. I will definitely be making this again!

I cooked the dish a bit longer as the vegetables s eemed too crunchy at first. Then the dish didn't have enough juice. Over-all this was lackluster...I will try another recipe next time.

This was just OK. I will definitely try a different recipe next time.

A big thank you to the reviewers who came before me. I doubled the spices, added the lemon and lemon juice to taste, and simmered the chick peas with the tagine. It came out a beautiful, hearty dish for the first snap of cold air. I served mine with roasted sausages. It reminded me of a fabulous dinner I had one cold winter night in Paris at a little hole in the wall Algerian restaurant. I might suggest to anyone looking to cook this to add a stick of cinnamon to the pot.

I should have listened to the previous reviewer (A cook from Madison WI)! I found this recipe very sour. I would definitely cut down on the lemon as the lemon seems to take over the flavor of all of the other spices.

Ok dish. Was not as flavorful as I was expecting. Not worth repeating given all the other wonderful tagines on this site.

I read the ingredient list 3 times. Unless I'm blind, I do not see any mention of preserved lemon slices, nor preserved lemons. The only lemon mentioned is lemon juice. The instructions refer to preserved lemons as well as a recipe for them. Where is it?

I used the Bon Appetit magazine printed version of the recipe. I usually buy the magazine and use the Epicurious site as a search tool. The web version of this recipe is missing the lemon ingredient. It should read: 1 lemon, thinly sliced. My lemon was fairly large and I used about 2/3 of it. Usually, preserved lemon is made by steeping lemons with salt for a few days. The technique described in this recipe is much faster and, in my opinion, better tasting.

OK I missed the preserved lemon in the recipe. Where is the recipe & amount?

Very tasty. I was weary of using the preserved lemon as I had used purchased preserved lemon before and didn't like the overpowering taste. For one and one half recipe, I used only four slices of the lemon, prepared as indicated in the recipe. It made all the difference. It is an essential ingredient. I also replaced half of the water with vegetable broth and added some rutabaga and parsnips. The olives I used were also very good: they were flavored with lemon and herbs of Provence. I added regular chick peas directly to the tagine. My vegetarian guests loved it!

Took quite a while to prep. Good flavor and everything seems to go together well. I like the contrast of the olives in the dish. I used 1 sliced lemon (missing in ingredients list) for the preserved lemon part and did not find it too strong at all.

I just made and ate this and really(!) enjoyed it! Such a hearty vegetarian meal. I used whole wheat couscous and thought the veggies were super flavorful. The preserved lemon added depth- YUM! While I enjoyed the spiced chickpeas, I didn't think they added much. Perhaps I didn't cook them long enough as they were crispy on outside but soft on inside and I should have added more cayenne. I would definitely make this again and am looking forward to leftovers tomorrow.

Not great. I was expecting a super flavorful dish and it was rather bland. The tomato paste and sun dried tomatoes were lost in everything else. Also it was quite spicy (hot), I only used half the red pepper flakes but it had a noticable bite.

This dish was delicious, although it was a lot of work. I added the whole lemon's worth of preserved lemon slices to the stew, chopping the rind and discarding the pulp and seeds; it was VERY lemony, which suited our tastes well. The flavour of the olives blended into the dish very nicely, and even my brother - who generally dislikes green olives - really enjoyed it. In response to an earlier review, I think the lemon and olive are the key to its Moroccan flavour. Next time I'll stew the chickpeas along with the vegetables, rather than roasting them separately. While I generally like roasted chickpeas, I didn't love their crunchiness here. I served the stew on rice instead of couscous to accommodate a gluten-intolerance.

I am not rating this recipe because I didn't actually follow it. But, if you were curious as to whether this would translate to a crock pot creation, the answer is: kind of. I used sweet potatoes, carrots, onion, turnips and rutabaga along with the recommended spices, sundried tomatoes, tomato paste and water. I omitted the preserved lemon because I'm lazy and the olives because my husband doesn't care for them. It simmered in the crock pot for about 6 hours on low and was very tasty and very tender, but not very Moroccan. The flavors definitely mellowed with the extended cooking time. I also bypassed the chickpeas, which may have made a difference. Was it a delicious stew for a rainy Virginia Wednesday? Absolutely. Was it what the recipe had in mind? I doubt it. I may try it the way it's written next time, though you can't beat the crock pot for convenience.

To add to my first review...I took leftovers with me to work the next day for lunch. Much tastier the next day! (Still a lot of prep time though...)

This was good, but I'm not sure the amount of time/effort required for this recipe played off in flavor/taste. However, part of the problem could be due to the missing information in this recipe: 1) the recipe doesn't say how many lemon slices to preserve, and 2) the recipe doesn't explain how to chop the preserved lemon (i.e., pulp only, or rind and pulp).

I've never been to Morocco, but this tasted GREAT. sour, sweet, salty, earthy - tons of wonderful flavor. We both loved this. We served it with a little plain yogurt for a garnish/mellower. Yum.
