This kind of ok, but mostly gross and I am insulted that parade would title this "Chichen Fajitas" and claim it as a Latin American recipe. Actual Latin American recipes do not use ketchup and soy sauce! What a disappointment.

I thought this was only so so. I tasted the ketchup more than anything else. It was more of a BBQ chicken than a fajitas.
