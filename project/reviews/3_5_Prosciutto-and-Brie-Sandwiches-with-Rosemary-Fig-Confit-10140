This recipe is heaven on a plate. Wow. I followed the recipe exactly except for 2 things. I did not even bother processing the fig confit. It didn't need it. I also used "creme de brie", just for the convenience. Wow!! Great dish.

I have been using this recipe for many years. Currently I am making this into a fabulous appetizer. Just layer the prosciutto, and brie on crostini, top with the fig confit and put in oven just until the cheese melts! Luscious!!!!!

What a perfect combination; the prosciutto, Brie and rosemary fig confit. I did make the confit 5 days ahead and it was just fine. Got lots of raves for these sandwiches!

Recipe is perfect as-is if using quality ingredients. I did make one change, using red wine, since that was all that was on hand. The fig confit filled my kitchen with a delicious aroma as it was simmering. It is meant to be used as a condiment for this sandwich (2 T per serv.) and, as such, it is perfect and needs no doctoring. Bland? Certainly not! Anything more seasoned would overwhelm the prosciutto (esp. a good Parma) and brie. It is also not too sweet. Using 3 T of quality honey gives it a depth of flavor and a good consistency. I'll be making this again and will try using a good white wine--port is another interesting suggestion. I may also try a completely Italian version, swapping out the brie for Robiola. The brie is great, though. If you use a triple creme brie, you don't need to "freeze" it to slice (defeats the purpose!), since it's pretty spreadable when room temp.

I made these sandwiches as part of a picnic lunch to take to a reggae festival, and everyone absolutely loved them. I used Black Mission figs because I prefer them to Calimyrna figs for their richer, less sweet flavor. I also did not use any honey because my figs seemed to have crystallized sugar on the outside. I also used a little extra rosemary and found once I assembled the sandwiches that I could have used even a little more. I also added a tiny but of salt and black pepper. I can see why people like the idea of using red wine, and I also like the idea of adding balsamic vinegar. I think that it would have added a nice dimension of flavor, but my boyfriend absolutely can't stand the smell of vinegar, so I was forbidden to add it. Overall, I think that these sandwiches are delicious and impressive, and even people with less refined palates might like them.

Excellent -- used the red wine once and the white wine the other... then paired it with some Blue Stilton and crackers for a wine tasting. Excellent

The confit seemed intriguing, but need a lot of modification. I found the original recipe almost sickeningly sweet, and totally lacking in interest. On a repeat try, I used red wine (as recommended below), the seeds from 6 cardomom pods, about 1 tablespoon of minced ginger and 2 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar. NOW it was good, rich and complex with a bit of spice. I served it with roast pork, which complemented it nicely, though I admit it would probably overpower the sandwich it was originally paired with.

next time i'll increase rosemary to a full tbsp in the confit. i also didn't blend the confit and left it a bit chunky instead. i used the excellent quality honey and it really added a layer of complexity to the flavour. quality of ingredients seems especially important in a simple recipe like this.

I doubled it, using 2 full size loaves with a decadent 1/2 pound of the thinly sliced meat on each loaf. Safeway just started carrying creme de brie (basically blended brie without a rind) so it went together in a snap. I too used red wine, and a fig preserve instead of the diced dried...thus I omitted the honey. Extra rosemary as suggested. We had 9 folks in a limo for a wine tasting, and it was just the perfect sandwich for wine. Served with a wild rice and pine nut salad it was terrific. Next time I will make it with fresh Ciabatta using my favorite recipe from this site and add some fresh rosemary to the loaf.

The fig confit is so good! I'm trying to figure out how I can incorporate it into other dishes. Used red wine instead of white to make it a little richer. I'm definitely glad I did as it tasted amazing. I took the advice of other reviewers and halfed the amount of honey. Good advice as it was not too sweet. You might want to add more rosemary if you want it to be more pronounced since it's pretty subtle.

Made (minus the rosemary) and served the fig confit with the excellent Chicken Liver Mousse, also on this site. Wonderful contrast of smooth and savory of the mousse, with sweet, and crunchy of the confit. Heeded the previous advice of others and reduced the honey. If I ever were to repeat this recipe I would sub in either a dry red wine, a ruby port, or balsamic reduction.

YUM, YUM, YUM...have been making this for years, especially for picnics at local winery. Goes really well with Ste. Michelle Horse Heaven Sauv Blanc. Try it. This rating should be 100% would make it again. It is that good!

This dish got rave reviews at a picnic I brought it to yesterday. I cut the ciabatta into smaller squares and toasted in the oven before wrapping up to take with me. Everyone loved it and asked me to make it at least once a week.

FANTASTIC! Made this exactly as written for a picnic at the Hollywood Bowl. It was perfect - delicious and easy! I didn't read all the reviews that gave the great tip to freeze the brie, so I just spread mine. It makes a lot of spread and we still have a bunch left after 4 sandwiches. Next time I will try toasting the sandwiches as other reviewers suggest.

The fig confit had an empty sweetness to it, so I added splashes of balsamic vinegar throughout the simmering process til it made me happy. Cheese on one side of the bread and confit on the other, put it under the toaster oven, or broiler until nice and melty then sandwich the prosciutto inside. Yum! Try just nutty cave-aged swiss or gruyere with the confit too.

I dont know what "cook from Portsmouth" is talkin' about. This sandwich (I made it like a panini) was soooooooo good! Used a "ripe" brie and made the fig confit the day before. Sweet, salty and gooey lovliness!!!

Fig confit was delicious; however, in combination with the prosciutto, sandwich was too greasy and salty.

Fabulous sandwich. Cali, Stop modifying every gosh darn element of a recipe and rating it please. Drives all of us crazy! As for the Brie, splurge on a triple cream. Mmmmm.

I took the basic recipe as a starting point, and made several adjustments. I used a whole grain bread instead of ciabtta and grilled the sandwiches in a panini maker. I also substituted Adriactic fig spread for the fig confit, adding the chopped fresh rosemary to that. Much easier! The fig spread is available at Whole Foods markets in their cheese section (well, in Palo Alto and Houston, at least), and is 66% fruit.

This was a nice, easy lunch for clients. I served it with roast beef and sweet/sour onions sandwiches, pasta/veggie salad and apricot tart. I absolutely LOVE the crunch of the fig seeds combined with the smoothness of the ham and brie. I froze the brie for about an hour to be able to slice it paper thin. Also, the sweetness of the figs and honey was really nice combined with the salty prosciutto. Clients loved it, husband loved it, we all went away happy. Life is sweet.

I was so disappointed! I expected probably too much from the taste. It was not bad, but the effort was not worth it to me. Sorry!

I made this recipe for a gourmet picnic and it was a huge hit. I took the other reviewer's advice and cut the amount of honey used in half and it was still very sweet. Freeze the brie so that it can be cut or turn it into a spread. Too hard to slice as it is a soft cheese.

Fabulous! I grilled the sandwiches on the stove top with a ridged cast iron skilled brushed with olive oil. What a great combo!

I love this sandwich. The fig confit is so good. I've also used it with black Forest Ham or roast chicken. sometimes I substitute the Brie for Jarlsburg. These sandwiches are all at their best warmed in the oven,just delicious!!!

It was a summer night of opera in the park. I filled a hamper with wine, fruit and assorted sandwiches. This prosicutto and brie wonder was by far everyones favorite. The labor of making the confit was worth it.

Served this on baguettes, cut into small pieces, then heated in a 300 degree oven until the cheese melted, as part of a New Year's buffet brunch. The rosemary-fig confit is also good on other kinds of meat and/or cheese sandwiches. Experiment to find your favorites.

Great combination ... and... if you warm it all a little in the oven before serving, the flavors are enhanced and it becomes a "4".

I used bagette instead and made little appetizers of baguette, then fig, then brie, and topped with prosciutto. The flavors are perfect together and go well with champagne. I also experimented and broiled half of them. The prosciutto gets crispy and the brie melty - Delicious! I will make again as an appetizer for guests. Next time I will cut the honey as the figs are sweet enough on their own.

I haven't made these sandwiches with the fig confit, but I will try it next time. Prosciutto and brie are a match made in heaven...I suggest adding fresh arugula or spinach leaves to this combo on some good, crusty bread (this is the way I've been making them ever since I had my first taste in Florence last year). I serve them up with some extra-crunchy, thick potato chips and a nice, cold bottle of acqua frizzante (sparkling water). A good dessert to finish this light meal off is a parfait of strawberries, mascarpone cream, and balsamic vinegar reduction (this recipe can also be found on this site). WONDERFUL!

A delicious suggestion -- Make a double or triple batch of the confit. Then, fill ready-made phyllo cups (fron the frozen section at the grocery store) with a teaspoon of the confit, add a generous amount of diced prosciutto, and top with grated parmesan cheese. place this in the oven until cheese melts. serve them hot or cold. absolutely delicious. served them at a holiday party last night and they were devoured to rave reviews.

This is a favorite of ours, perfect for picnics or travel days. It's easy to make and the confit can be prepared well in advance. Highly recommended.

Shared this at a picnic on the beach. Added to a beautiful moment. The sandwiches go very well with the same dry white that you make the confit with. I think I used a Bordeaux. I found the confit to be too sweet, however and I would use two tablespoons of honey next time. I did add arugula for some roughage. The combination of salty prosciutto, sweet confit, and the creamy texture of the brie balanced with the arugula is a winner.

This is an excellent recipe! I loved the variety of flavors from the brie and rosmary and the subtle sweetness of honey. I made an adjustment by adding carmelized onions which turned out to be fantastic. Definitely delicious!

I enjoyed this with friends at a winery in Sonoma. Everyone thought it was very good. The sweetness of the confit goes well with the creaminess of brie and saltiness of prosciutto. Next time, I'll be careful not to add too much honey so it isn't too sweet though.

Fantastic sandwiches for a picnic! I added arugula to the sandwiches, which worked well with the rest of the flavors and added a nice touch. Uncork a nice bottle of white wine and you're all set for a lazy afternoon outside!

It's ok. Pretty bland, which is surprising, because prosciutto is not something that I usually think of as bland. And the fig confit turned into a crystalized rock-candy-like substance as it cooled. Not sure what I did wrong.

This was an easy to make, crowd pleaser for a party. I used it as an appetizer, omitted the bread, sliced the brie thinly and fanned it out, and made a pile of shredded proscuitto. People made their own little bites with baguette slices and have raved about it. Also the confit can be made more than five days ahead. Highly recommended.
