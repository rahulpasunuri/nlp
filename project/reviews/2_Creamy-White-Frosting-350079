This icing is horrible. Do yourself a big favour and skip it. It doesn't taste like icing at all. I made 24 chocolate cupcakes and put this icing (dyed orange) on them. I still had 20 left after the party and I through them all out. Previous poster is right. Why is there no zero fork option. This was way below okay. Horrible. Horrible Horrible. Am I being clear enough??

I liked this frosting, and so did my kids. I omitted the second flavor and only used vanilla and it turned out smooth, creamy and tasty.

This frosting is awful. I used lemon therefore it tasted like 'lemon shortening'. What a waste on time and ingredients. Wish I could give the recipe zero forks.

Tasted like orange flavored shortening. I think I'll stick to buttercreams from here on out.
