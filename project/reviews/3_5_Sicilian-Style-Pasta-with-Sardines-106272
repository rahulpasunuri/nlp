Really enjoyed this for many reasons: delicious, easy, healthy, unique. I was very excited to try it after having a sardine pasta at La Medusa in Seattle - an excellent Sicilian restaurant. Theirs uses tomatoes and olives as well, and while I really liked this version, I think just a bit of acidity would have helped such as from tomatoes, or olives, or as another person suggested, lemon. (Perhaps my wine was just a bit too sweet.) Otherwise, even with using a cheap piece of grocery store sliced bread for bread crumbs, this is a really great recipe!

It's a good recipe, that follows the traditional way I would add just one tip: for the sausage, in Italy we use also almonds (roasted and chopped)and 4 desalted anchovies (you must fry them, butterflied) Before using raisins, while the pasta is cooking, you should soak the raisins in a bowl of warm water for 20 minutes, then drain. The sicilian recipe, if you want to compare with your, is here: http://www.academiabarilla.com/recipes/sicilia/pasta-with-sardines.aspx

I have been craving this dish since we visited Taormina last year where I had this for lunch and dinner more times than I care to reveal. I added some tomato paste and hot water to the saffron as one reviewer suggested. Good call...it helped the fragrant saffron permeate the dish completely. I used whole wheat Panko breadcrumbs. Easy and so good!

This really is amazingly good for such simple ingredients. The only significant change I made was that I just used dry bread crumbs (homemade ones), without tossing them with oil. That's the way my friends in Sicily do it!

We make a lot of pasta, and we will be adding this to the rotation (along w/ Carbonara and Puttanesca). We always wanted to try it, but Marcella Hazan's recipe is too fussy for week nights and who has sardines & fennel on hand? The only thing I followed from Marcella was to dissolve the saffron in a TBS of hot water and tomato paste so that it impermeates the dish, and I added 2 TBS of butter at the end to bring the dish together. Also, I used whole wheat Panko as a shortcut for the fresh bread crumbs. Delicious way to eat sardines, which are sustainable, healthy and cheap (Traders has them).

I don't usually review, but this dish had seemed so risky in the beginnning, and turned out absolutely delicious! My husband who does not like sardines nearly as much as I do went back for thirds - he's also sensitive to fruit and savory combinations and has travelled italy extensively. He said Italians would applaud it, he couldn't get over it. I used really nice Spanish sardines packed in olives and olive oil, removed the olives. I also subbed currants for the raisins and italian parsley for the fennels fronds (which I accidently tossed out). It was so delicious, prefectly balanced, not fishy at all, refreshing and light - perfect for summer. Totally cravable and now will be part of my usual pastas. I also used Bucatini instead of the perciatelli. I used the best quality ingredients I could find and it was worth it. Very easy to make and clean up. I've made other sardine pasta dishes and I think this is far superior because the wine and fennel add light, fresh complexity. I think garlic would weigh it down. I put red pepper on the table and served a pinot grigio - perfecto!

I've been making this all spring, anytime I find fennel at the farmer's market. It's become one of my favorite, if not very favorite, pasta recipe. And I eat a lot of pasta.

Make this only if you like sardines. I happen to like sardines quite a bit. My husband is not such a big fan, but he really loved this pasta. Go figure. It's not so good re-heated. So this recipe was way too much for the two of us. We really liked the sweet and rich flavor that the pine nuts and raisins imparted.

My wife and I thought this sounded delicious. We've been looking for ways to eat more sardines because they're a relatively sustainable seafood. Unfortunately, this recipe was truly revolting. We each took a few valiant bites, but then moved on to bowls of cereal and yogurt. Consume at your own risk.

This dish has a really unique flavor, somewhat sweet. I made it exactly as written, but next time I might use scallops instead of the sardines. Also a note - don't put the entire 1/2 cup of olive oil your pan when cooking the fennel and onion - you will never get good carmelization. Rather, put 2 tablespoons in pan and remainder in after you add the wine mixture

I have made this three times and only on the last time did I get my hands on perciatelli, or bucatini. For some reason this made this dish all the more delicious. Maybe it's just the fun on sucking air through the pasta...I don't know, but delicious!

Very tasty, easy and quick. I added garlic and red pepper flakes as suggested.

This was such a nice change of pace from the typical array of pastas I've made. It was super easy and pretty much foolproof.

Weird. I don't know what to make of this dish. It didn't come together into anything cohesive, and while the flavors didn't clash, they didn't meld either. It took no time at all, which was great.

This dish reminded me of the food I ate while traveling in Sicily. I used fresh sardines, and only about half the amount suggested. Next time I would use the full amount. Delicious! And very Sicilian!

This recipe was a pleasant suprise! I used fresh sardines instead of canned, and sauteed them in bread crumbs beforehand as the base for the sauce. Before being fully cooked, I removed them, separated the meat to re-add to the pan later. Also--let the sauce go longer than 15 minutes to further develop the complexity of the sauce. I let it go more like 25. I also highly recommend using three cloves of garlic and some fresh ground dried red chili, and included capers in the final toos.

This is a REAL Siciian recipe you wont find in any restaurants. Haven't had it since I was about 11 years old when my Gran made it. Pasta Fenocchia (or something like that). I used Sardines in spring water (less heavy) and mashed the whole lot up. I added a bit of cayenne. I also thought maybe a squeeze of lemon before serving might lift it. A very exotic and yummy dish

I have to admit I doctored this up a bit. I cooked fresh tomatoes with the onion and fennel, skipped the wine/saffron/raisin mix, and added parsley, red pepper flakes and garlic. I tossed the sauce with gemelli pasta and enjoyed it!

I thought this was a wonderful combination of flavors. I thought the amount of sardines was just right. You have to mash them up good. I used spaghetti, but i didn't think the sauce coated the pasta well so next time i'd use a different type of pasta perhaps a shell that would collect all the good bits in it.

This dish received mixed reviews. The fishy flavor was a little overwhelming with all those sardines, but the fennel/raisin/saffron combination was interesting.
