replaced the croissant with whole wheat bread toasted, baked salami in the same pan i made the eggs with to substitute the use of oil. used Boursin chives and shallot cheese instead of regular cheese for a gourmet kick.

Absolutely divine dish...and makes a perfect sunday brunch. Easy to put together. I tried it with finely chopped green & red peppers as substitute for aragula, and it worked wonderflly well!
