Brought it to a Chili Cook Off party and it was the firs dip to be eaten up!! That is a good sign.

The party crowd absolutely demolished this dip - be prepared to go through two large bags of Tostitos Scoops! This is a really easy, very tasty dip that can be easily modified to suit your tastes. A few modifications you might enjoy: 1) Chipotle Refried Beans - slightly spicy, 2) Layer of 1/2 lb ground beef browned with Taco seasonings on top of the refried beans, 3) fresh salsa instead of bottled, 4) chopped pickled jalapenos instead of bottled jalapeno sauce, 5) Kalamata olives instead of regular black olives, 6) top dip with chopped tomatoes and sprinkle with cilantro - just makes it prettier!

Perfect for the "Bottled Salsa" Crowd. If you think a trip to Taco Bell is a good night out at a Mexican restaurant, you'll love this one! Bon Apetit!

This is by far the best dip ever!!! I receive requests for this dip at every function I attend. I have made it at least 6 times this year alone. It can be a bit time intensive but well worth it. I do not add olives or Jalapeno sauce, instead I add 1 teaspoon of Taco seasoning to the sour cream and I use 8 oz of Taco cheese and 8 oz of Sharp cheddar. Top with chopped lettuce and watch it disappear.

I make the avocado layer for this my regular guacamole recipe (avocados, minced fresh garlic, salt, lime juice, and chopped pickled chilis). Also, the cheese mixture looks more appetizing if you use white cheddar. I agree w/ a previous reviewer that the better the olives you use, the better tasting it will be (I used Kalamata). Oh - and really, you can just mix some bottled salsa you like w/ the cheese mixture as opposed to the whole taco sauce, jalapeno sauce, etc.

No one liked this. A total waste of good avocados.

I didn't care for mixing of ingredients. I prefer a basic 7 layer dip.

I have four teenagers (!). I made this last Saturday afternoon (I doubled the recipe), and it held up for each of the 4 group arrivals. They could not get enough. This will be a staple all summer.

I prepared this dish for a Friday food day at work and had about 6 compliments the following Monday as soon as I walked in the door. What a great feeling that everyone liked it that much, Thanks Epicurious

This stuff is fantastic, and I generally hate Mexican food! I've already made it at least five times now, and it's so simple that you have the recipe memorized after the first couple times. I leave out the olives b/c I don't like them and add the juice of 1/2 a lime and a dash of salt to the avocado mixture, which makes a huge difference. I also add an extra avocado, cubed, to the mashed mixture, which adds great flavor and texture. To make this a little less fattening, I use light sour cream and soy cheese (I like Veggie Shreds) - there are so many other great flavors going on that you can't even tell the difference! Finally, I heat this up and serve it warm, which makes it even better (by a lot).

This dip is always a hit! I replace the taco sauce with a Trader Joe's salsa and cut the onion in half. I also mix in taco seasoning with the sour cream.

This dish has been a party favorite in our family since the mid '80s. I lost my original recipe and was so glad to find it on your site. Thanks!

I made this dish twice and the second time I used the tip given by Downington, PA, and left out the sauce, using dry taco seasoning in the sour cream. The second batch was much better! Also try this with Queso-Jack cheese...yum yum

I used fat free refried beans, light sour cream, and reduced fat cheddar. I also added a couple squeezes of lime juice and a bit of salt to the avocado mixture. Was well received!

Have made it several times so far, the latest for a group of junior highers and high schoolers - could not keep them away from it and the bottom of the dish was cleaned out. To save time, I used guacamole dip in place of avocado and spices, and mild salsa sauce in place of taco sauce, jalepeno and tomatoes.

Just made it and took to a 40th b-day party. It was a hit. Have given out the recipe twice!!!

I've made this twice so far, and we love it! I made a few changes as well - I eliminated the taco sauce from the cheese mixture. Instead, I used about a quarter of a packet of dry seasoning mix and mixed it in with the sour cream. Also, I squeezed fresh lemon juice into the avocado mixture so that it holds its color.

I served this to a crowd of displaced midwesterners, who were overjoyed to encounter something so richly reminiscent of pot luck fare from their childhoods. I used nonfat refried beans and nobody noticed. A great combination of flavors, although it was a bit too robust for average corn chips; it worked better scooped out onto a plate and loaded onto chips with spoons.

Very good especially after adding fresh jalapenos.

excellent dish. highy recommended. When I made this the second time, I added fresh chopped jalepeno, cilantro and lime zest to the avocado layer and it was much better. That is how I always make this now. people love it!!

There was something missing for us. Despite the varied ingredients, the final result lacked "punch".

This dip was delicious! Unlike other taco dips, this one has a zing to it that's just right. The 6 people I made it for agreed that it was the best one they've ever had. I did add more chili powder and garlic powder than it called for. I will definitely make this one again!

At least 5 people at me dinner party asked me for this recipe! It was compared to an entire Mexican meal in one dish. The suggested spices are really nice, and I even added taco seasoning with the others. I will definitely use this recipe again!

This recipe is always requested whenever I have a get together. There's never anything left! Like others, I omit the jalapeno sauce as I cannot find it. I just add extra Tabasco to the cheese mixture. I also make my own guacamole as my family loves avocados! Great recipe!!

I gave this receipe 3 forks, only because I did not taste it for myself. I made it for a cocktail party and EVERYONE loved it! All the guys went on and on about it! They thought the "special" sauce on top was the best. My special sauce was only the green taco sauce, green tabasco jalapeno sauce and shredded chedder. I am making it again tonight, needless to say they are excited.

Very good, and it serves a lot of people. I would make a few changes though in the avacado layer. I would use real garlic, add a bit of salt and lemon juice and maybe thin it with a bit of water so that it wasn't so dense and heavy. Great combination of flavors though!

I made this for my Super Bowl party. It got rave reviews! Everyone ate so much of it that they hardly had room for the main course. I'll definitely make it again.

I wanted to try and make this dish a bit less fatty for the super bowl party. I didn't put any cheese in it, added cilantro, used a whole small can of chopped olives and used jalepenio refried beans. The whole family loved it. We will be making this for almost every event. An excellent recipe. Thank you.

I used sharp cheddar but couldn't find the jalapeno sauce. I served this hot with taco chips and it was absolutely delicious. My boyfriend said it was the best dip he's had so far. This recipe is a keeper. I'll be making it again soon!

This dish was very disappointing. I prepared it exactly as instructed for a potluck, and most of it remained untouched. I thought the cheese, taco sauce and black olive mixture was very unappetizing. Will not make again.

This has become a favorite in our family when entertaining large groups, or contributing to a pot luck. We find it best when fresh, local tomatoes are available. Also, black olives from a gourmet deli (not canned).

Taco Dip/7 Layer Dip - excellent appetizer that everyone seems to love and you can never make enough of it. I did a combination of this recipe and the Ortega 7 Layer version. I semi-doubled it for a 30 person party using a 13" dia. tray. I used 2 cans of refried beans mixed with 2 packages of taco seasoning. Then, 2 cups sour cream, the fresh avocado mixture (just as listed), chopped tomatoes, green onions, blk olives, 4 OZ CHOPPED GREEN CHILIES, SHREDDED LETTUCE, & 8 oz cheese. It was perfect and served a lot without taking up more table top space.

If you are a serious lover of Mexican/Spanish cuisine this is probaby too taco/nacho/guacamole for you. There are many ingredients and if you vary ony to any degree it will be different. I made this and it was gone after the guacamole made by a hispanic girl. Keep to good ingredients and this will be popular with all but the most finicky.

This was a great dip but made a few changes. I substituted the 8 oz. of sour cream for 8 oz of good quality cream cheese mixed with 2 oz of taco seasoning

This was a great taco dip, and nice change from the usual layered dip I make. I also thought 8 oz. of the grated cheese was plenty. The recipe called for a baking dish, but didn't say what size. I used a 9x9 pan, and that was way too small. The next time I make this, I would make on a platter like I usually make these type of dips. It was also a bit too hot and spicy for my family. Next time I will use milder taco sauce and skip the jalapeno sauce.

Not a hit, even amomg a crowd of southwestern food lovers. We found it to be rather dry and the avocado was too overpowering. So many great ingredients, but very disappointing results.

I haven't made this recipe, but noticed someone in the reviews asking for jalapeno sauce. It is widely available in latino markets. If you don't live near one, you might try an internet search for a source.

This is such a tasty dip! I did make changes though. I peeled and seeded my tomatoes used 8oz of cheese, added lemon juice to the avacados and put in a dash of Tabasco because try as I might I couldnt find jalapeno sauce anywhere. It got rave reviews and demands for future preparation. It is an instant favourite! Thanks Beth who ever you are!
