I loved tense pork chops. However, I mixed the rub together and marinated the pork chops overnight. My broiler may have not run as hot because it took me approx 20 min to cook under broiler. I love rosemary and my pork chops were so good!

Crushed garlic, fresh rosemary, olive oil and salt. Nice thick pork chop with the bone and a ring of fat, broiled into JUST done. That's like an atomic war of flavor. I can't imagine needing to amp this recipe up (aside from adding more rosemary, depending on its quality). If you want a sauce, serve next to mash and gravy, a creamy, cheesy salad or a bowl of mushroom bisque. But don't ruin this simple beauty. PS you can put this on the grill and it's even better

Very simple and awesome low-carb dish. I recommend frying a couple sprigs of rosemary in 1/4 cup of olive oil and finishing the pork chops with a drizzle of the oil then garnishing with the rosemary sprig.

Bang! Bang! Fastest dinner in the west. ...or east, north, south, whatever. Chops marinaded while I roasted pears to accompany. Served with salad. Alfredo?! Bleh, why ruin a perfectly heart healthy, waist friendly recipe? Solid, quick, flexible weeknight staple.

My boyfriend and I LOVED these pork chops. They were so easy to make and they were so tender!

No one had any complaints, but they weren't raving about these either. I think they were pretty good but my family missed the sherry sauce I usually serve with chops. Definitely get the rib chops, and tons of fresh rosemary and garlic. Ten minutes start to finish is very nice.

Cut recipe in half for the two of us. My wife commented how tender and tasty the pork chops were with the bone-in. Recipe is simple and provides another way of preparing pork chops.

We found this pork recipe simple and quick to prepare, but needed a bit of help to make it really shine. In future I will marinate the chops for a few hours in the rub before cooking, then serve with a mushroom alfredo topping.

This recipe was the easiest gourmet pork chop ever. Definately make it now! I paired it with some stir fried green beans and herbed potato salad.

I was tempted to give this 4 forks not because it's the most incredible gourmet pork chop I've ever made or eaten but because it takes me seriously all of ten minutes to make and for what it is it's completely delicious, requires almost zero ingredients and is incredibly easily modified. I add a little bit of honey to mine and some extra garlic, does the trick. Awesome in a pinch.

This was a simple, tasty rub for pork chops. The first night I made it, I substituted tarragon and a bit of thyme for rosemary, and it was excellent. A few days later I made it again using rosemary, and it was good. When I make it again, I will use tarragon and thyme instead of rosemary

I loved this recipe. I see a lot of people saying the flavor was not great. I guess I liked it because it didn't overwhelm the natural pork taste, but was still tasty. My only caveat is to be sure to get a good cut of pork chop, or it will dry out in the oven. I think I got tricked at the meat counter, as two of my pork chops were darker (a loin versus a rib chop maybe? I confess to ignorance about cuts of pork) and weren't as juicy.

I agree with the comment below - the pork chops were juicy, but the actual flavor was not amazing... it was missing a little something. I'm going to try the "Pork Chops with Cranberry, Port & Rosemary Sauce" tonight.

I am a college kid that loves to cook, but my time is usually very limited. This was an incredible quick and delicious meal. I also used it on just 3 pork chops and added a little extra rosemary. It paired really nicely with homemade garlic mashed potatoes.

A simple, very easy pork chop. Not spectacular for entertaining, but tasty for a quick chop. Variation: Used chops without bone and cooked on grill; they were still moist, just don't overcook. Used mixture in the recipe's quantities for 2 chops and it seemed the right amount...but we like things spicy!

This is a simple but delicious weeknight dinner. My whole family loves it and it is so easy to make. I grill it on our outside grill on low so the meat doesn't dry out. It takes about 15- 20 min on the grill- -just enough time to throw together a couple of sides.

These pork chops were delicious! I forgot the lemon after they were cooked, but think that it could make a really moist and flavorful chop even better! We grilled them for about 15 minutes. Yum!

8 minutes not nearly long enough. More like 10 minutes per side. Then very delicious and still juicy.

Just cooked this for 2, split the recipe in half. It was great but i would add a garlic clove (used 1). I baked them at 350 for 30 minutes then broiled them to brown. Very moist and delish! Used simliar mixture (without garlic) to coat cubed new potatos and broiled. It worked well! + salad = great dinner.

I've tried this as written and also with a thicker chop with no bone and I prefer the original recipe. The thinner bone-in chops stay moist and the flavor is better.

It is important to use the bone in pork chop or there will be no taste. I found this recipe to be an excellent spring/summer dish. To compliment the Mediterranean flair I made a tangerine salsa with tomatoes and red onion. I spooned the salsa over some white rice on a romaine lettuce leaf.

My husband and I thought the recipe was tasty. I didn't have fresh rosemary and I think that would have made a difference. I also did not add lemon wedge. I used center cut pork chops. Don't like bones in our food. I broiled each side for 8 minutes. Over the summer, I will use the grill. Will be part of our rotation.

This was superb. I baked them at 45 for 35 minutes (chops were a little thicker than 1/2 inch), and served with steamed creamer potatoes and green beans. Will definitely make it again.

I made this the other night and wasn't too impressed. I didn't use bone-in pork chops because I didn't see them at the store. Otherwise, I followed the directions exactly but needed to keep the chops under the broiler for a couple of extra minutes. The flavor was ok, but not as good or intense as I thought it would be. Also, the pork chops were tough in spots, which is why I tend to stay away from cooking them. I don't think I'll be making this again, but my husband seemed to like it better than I did.

This was very easy and very good recipe. Since my cheap electric oven doesn't broil with high enough heat, the first trial was a failure. But the second time, I sauteed the chops first and baked them at 450. (Just in case there are unfortunate people like myself.)

Very quick, easy, and tastes amazing. This recipe is definitely a keeper. I'm a bit paranoid with under cooking pork and my chops were about 3/4 in. thick. I cooked them for 12 minutes and they were still juicy.

Rating: 2
So I learned the hard way that the broiler has to be REALLY preheated in order for this to work. otherwise, the fat does not render, and the porkchops become tough and not very flavorful underneath the spices. This is a nice spice rub that you could use on a lot of different meats, but I'm finding that I personally prefer my porkchops simply brined and then grilled.

Could not be easier or better. Fresh garlic is key; garlic mashed potatoes is a good side dish.

What a great simple recipe. I probably would sear the Chops in a pan next time though, then finish them in the oven under lower heat. The broiler ended up burning the olive oil in the pan so there was a lot of smoke, they did turn out prefectly though. I will definitely make this again.

Heavenly and super fast - definitely go with fresh rosemary for the apartment-filling aroma. The lemon wedges make or break the dish - about half a lemon per person worked out pretty well.

My husband have long struggled to find the happy medium between my preference for big taste and sauces and his preference for the simplicity of well-cooked meat with just salt and pepper.

This is a 4-star recipe because it's so easy, inexpensive, quick, and tasty. I tripled the garlic and I'm glad I did because it made a great topping for the broccoli I served with the chops. The lemon juice was very complementary and I also added it to the broccoli. I used 1-inch thick boneless pork chops and they took 12 minutes of broiling.

Rating: 4
Wow! What an easy and delicious recipe! I'll definitely make this one again. Broiling is a cinch and the rosemary flavor was well-liked by the family. I didn't have lemon wedges and substituted lemon juice; also substituted Worchestershire sauce for soy and added salt. Turned out delicious!
