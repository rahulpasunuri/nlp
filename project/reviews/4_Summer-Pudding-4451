Just like my Grammy used to make. She used fresh berries and brick covered in foil just like Pam the cook's Mother in law. The only difference is that I was taught to butter the bread. One of my favorite desserts.

I had never heard of summer pudding before, and had my doubts about how this would turn out. It is fantastic!!!! I paired it with the LOW-FAT VANILLA CUSTARD SAUCE from Epicurious. Wow - what a hit!

We loved this recipe. I used a whipping cream recipe from Summer Pudding with Whipped Cream which was a combo of whipping cream and sour cream. To die for!!

Absolutely stunning! Mix + match fruit in any combination and really no need to use frozen.

My English mother-in-law makes her own version of this and it's my favorite summer desert, she serves it with creme fraiche. She uses fresh berries and never cooks them; the juices come out over night. I keep a brick covered with foil in my kitchen for a weight.

A light, simple and delicious dessert. I substituted brioche or challah bread instead to add bit more richness.

I had tasted this dessert in New-Zealand, thought it delicious and assumed it awfully complicated to prepare. Even as I was preparing your recipe, I had my doubts that the whole thing would collapse when unmolded, bur SURPRISE! It looked and tasted spectacular. So easy too! Didn't have cranberry juice so I used orange juice. The second time, used the berries I had at hand: mostly raspberries and thought your combination more subtle in taste. A winner!

Excellent! We have beautiful fresh fruit here in British Columbia, Canada and this recipe is an exemplary dessert. Definitely worth the wait and mess.

This turned out wonderfully the first time and mediocre the second. Couldn`t see what I had done differently!! Was very good, though.

A great summer dessert! I used store-bought pound cake (you know, the frozen kind) instead of French bread. Everyone thought it was delicious; it didn't last too long. I also added a layer of the pound cake in the middle with the fruit. Since it's weighted down it ends up being on the small side, so when I make it again I'll probably double the recipe and put it in a larger bowl.
