I used only one 1-lb fennel and I still think there wasn't enough dressing. It was tasty but I agree with the other reviewers that it needs a little something. Perhaps I will add some dry herbs to the leftovers. I also found the cutting instructions quite confusing.

I used the vinaigrette over thickly sliced grilled fennel and it was great. Also added a bit of mint and cayenne which I thought worked well.

I couldn't eat this salad. It was too bitter. Maybe it was my endive. Either way, nothing special.

This exact recipe has good intentions, but is way too involved for a college student like me! I made quite a few modifications and it was scrumptious, so I'll share. Here's how I made it work for me: I didn't do the fancy-schmancy cutting, but the fennel still tasted great with the orange vinaigrette! That's a super combination. I substituted balsamic vinegar for white wine vinegar. Tasted great! No need to buy something I didn't have. Then I found that squeezing clementines (didn't have an orange) was pretty hard without a juicer! And the zesting, eh, not so much. So I added sliced clementines and used my trusty ol' orange juice from the carton instead. Much easier than juicing and probably tastier and prettier, thank you! Then I added mache, parsley, and cilantro (fabulous, I wouldn't make it without it!) in lieu of the endive. Sliced almonds on top, et voila! A fantastic salad.

Delicious, you don't even need a japanese beringer, just slice the fennel thinly!

Jimmy from Chicago is absolutely right. At least the photo gives an idea of the intended results. The combination is a classic and the textures very nice. It needs a little zip like bleu cheese or parmesan and toasted walnuts.

It sounds good, but it's directions like these that make me stop entertaining the idea of making something: "Cut fennel bulbs lengthwise into very thin slices with slicer. Halve endives lengthwise, then halve crosswise and cut lengthwise into 1/4-inch-wide strips."
