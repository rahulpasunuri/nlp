Really delicious combination of flavors and the perfect ratio of spices. Everyone loved it as an accompaniment to lamb kafta and fattoush. The only reason I don't rate the recipe 4 forks is because I found it calls for too much liquid. It resulted in a soupier texture than I want in a pilaf. I'd reduce it by 1/4 - 1/2 c. next time.

i agree with those who substituted brown rice. We served this with Trader Joe's falafel and a yogurt, cilantro sauce for an easy, healthy weeknight supper. The onions add a lot to the dish.

This was delicious! We served it with pita bread, tzatziki, cucumbers and tomatoes and it really completed the meal. We also used brown rice instead of white rice-just added it at the same time as the lentils. Definitely going to become a popular dish at our house!

This is a staple at my house. We have it at least once a month and I make the homemade pita bread listed in the meatless menu. I've used brown rice, added at the same time as the lentils, as well as used white and it tastes very similar so now I always go for the healthier option and use brown basmati. Other than that, I make as written. If tomatoes and cukes are ripe, they're great additions, but this is also good fall/winter comfort food.

this recipe was delicious, nutritious, and easy to make. The onion part is the only thing mildly time consuming. Made it with lebanese chicken from this site, and mint, cucumber, yogurt sauce.

I love this dish served in Lebanese restaurants. This IS the best (better than restaurant)that I have tried. I used boullion instead of vegetable stock I didnt have.

So simple and delicious, even my 5 year old asked for not only seconds, but THIRDS! The cinnamon was an ingredient I had a difficult time adding, as I am Southern American and cinnamon is for apple pie and sweet breads; but it adds such a wonderful flavor that is subtle. I wouldn't consider making it without! Enjoy!

Delish! The flavors are divine and the onions and yogurt pair with the lentils and rice beautifully. Even my 2 year old loved the rice and lentils. Will be making this again and again.

I love the mujadara at my local Lebanese restaurant so I was happy to find this recipe. It's pretty good. I use brown rice instead of white rice so I put the rice and lentils in together. To make it more like the mujadara that I love I also add a little cinnamon. Try mixing some yogurt with schiracha for a fabulous condiment.

Wow. Loved this! We ALL loved this. It is such a delicious blend of flavors and textures, and sooooo easy to make. As others suggested, make plenty of blackened onions--the recipe recommendations were not enough for our tastes.

I would highly recommend this dish. We love it and make it often. I serve with lavash and hummus to rave reviews. I usually use brown rice and I've found it is wonderful w/out the tomato/cucumber as well.

My husband and I love this recipe! It's a fantastic, inexpensive, absolutely scrumptious meal--and so easy to make. Even your non-vegetarian friends will love this! This is one of our household staples now.

This is a favorite with both vegetarians and non-vegetarians. I serve it with yogurt raita on the side and naan bread (flat bread). It is also good with Mango Chutney. I like to carmelize a cup of onions to garnish with when serving. I also added a half a teaspoon of cardamom and a bay leaf.

this is going into my recipe library! i decreased the broth down to 24 ounces (and once i used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth). i omitted the blackened onions and the yogurt, just for simplicity's sake (i really only wanted to eat rice and lentils, a weird craving), and it was just very delicious. my husband, who HATES lentils...likes this dish.

As usual, I added more cumin. Everyone, vegetarian and others, loved this dish! I enjoyed cooking both lentils and rice in the same pan, and thought the blackened onions on top were delicious. My son's review: Very yummy!

Went with other reviewers who increased (or wanted to increase) the amount of rice and/or lentils to prevent wetness. Alas, all that did was make it a gummy mess. The flavour was good, however, and perhaps I'll try it again with the exact porportions as written. How novel! Making a recipe as written, haha.

Made this last night and was pleasantly surprised to find my husband loved it (thought the cinnamon would put him off). It was extremely wet though with 2 cans of broth. I simmered it for about 20 minutes after adding the lentils and another 20 minutes after adding the rice, and still needed to cook uncovered at a low boil for about 8 minutes at the end to reduce the amount of liquid to a reasonable level. Didn't quite blacken the sliced onions, per other reviewers ... used ground coriander instead of allspice because I didn't have any allspice ... but it was delicious anyway!

I have made this dish on more than two occasions. Contrary to some of these reviews, the amount of spices suited my and my girlfriend's palates just fine. The only caveat I would add is this: don't be afraid to add several cups of water and maybe another 10 mins. of cooking to the lentil-rice pilaf at the end of the preparation. I have cooked with moderate heat levels all three times that I have prepared the dish, and have found that the amount of broth is simply insufficient to fully soften the rice/lentils. Also, for all you lime lovers out there, don't forget to add a few squirts of fresh lime juice to your served dishes. PS- chicken broth is a perfectly viable substitute for the veg broth in this recipe.

I followed the advice of a previous reviewer and substituted bulgar for the rice. Served with the suggested accompaniments-excellent!! I will be making this regularly.

This dish is a take on the traditional and simpler lebanese moujadara or moudardara, which is a great vegetarian lentil and rice dish (some people use bulgur wheat #2 instead) with carmelized onions and no spices. This is a decent version, albeit very americanized goumet. To save some time and go for the more authentic taste, I would use salted water (water should just barely cover the mixture) with spices (the tradtional version omits the spices) instead of broth. Cook the lentils and rice together in the water until tender. While those are cooking carmelize, not blacken (blackening the onions makes them bitter-you want to really taste the onion here it's key), a few finely chopped onions in olive oil with salt and pepper and then mix them into the cooked lentils. The dish should glisten when done. I have eaten this dish a thousand times. My mother used to make it for us as alot a meatless dish during the lenten season. In Lebanon this is considered peasant food-I think they must be prett lucky peasants. Great with yogurt on top scooped up in torn pita or as a pita sandwich with some sliced radishes, shaved lettuce and tomatoes. I love in in a big bowl with a lemony green salad on the side. It's a repeater for sure.

This is great; easy and quick to make and after you make it once, you'll think of countless variations. Next time I'm adding golden raisins a/o dried cherries and toasted pine nuts or sliced almonds, whichever are hanging around in the pantry!

delicious, healthy, zesty, a great hit at my dinner party!! I made this for the first dinner party I invited my mother to and she could not believe she had produced such a chef for a daughter... it's all the recipe!! however, 2 things to note. the rice I used took 30+ minutes to absorb all the water, and carmelizing the onions took longer than I had anticipated too. but all in all it was a total smash hit.

I made this dish for the first dinner I have ever made in my house for my mom. It was a huge hit! the only thing I would suggest is that the rice I used actually took 30+ minutes to absorb all the water, so I would suggest padding the cooking time. also, the onions took longer than I thought too. I will definitely make this again!!

Very satisfying and filling. I had the onions cooked and waiting and my mom came by and threw them out. She thought I had accidently burned them. I made more of course. This is a good dish to have leftovers for work the next day.

I thought this was very good, the spices were just right. However, I did think the liquid ratio was off. I would prefer this to be drier, not as mushy as mine turned out and I let it sit for a long time before serving. I would perhaps keep the liquid the same but increase both lentils and rice to 1 cup.

My father even had seconds! Thanks to other reviewers who suggested making extra blackened onions. This recipe will make it to my "everyday favorites" file.

This is a great ethnic recipe to impress friends with, particularly if you have vegetarian friends. The onions really make the meal, and don't feel skittish about using mint in the pilaf - it adds a very subtle tone that would be missed if left out. If you don't feel like this is enough food for an entire meal, go with the flatbread and mango/vanilla pudding serving suggestions, and maybe start with a smooth, creamy soup beforehand.

This is a great weeknight dish! I followed the recipe to the letter and wouldn't change one single thing. It was very easy to make and absolutely delicious, especially with the yogurt and mint. I'm adding this to my list of quick meals and will also try it as a side dish. Highly recommended!

Rating: 4
This was wonderful. My grandmother made something similar, but not with all the spices -- I hesitated to change "her recipe", but am glad I did. For the cook from Pasadena, please try the recipe again with regular lentils. The spices give the dish a nice gold color (unlike the black lentils you tried) and with the chopped mint on top - it makes a pretty presentation. I have served as both a main (vegetarian) dish and as a side dish (I skipped the yogurt for the side dish).

I would kick up the spices a bit, otherwise it's okay. The mint yogurt is excellent and I like it directly on the rice.

I made this with small black "beluga" lentils because they were all I had. The entire dish was an unappetizing shade of charcoal gray. (I imagine similar nasty-colored results with other varieties of lentils, although my own outcome was probably the worst possible.) If I were to make this again,--and I probably won't--I'd cook the lentils separately and place them on top of the rice just before serving. Also, while I liked this blend of spices, the amount of spice called for is grossly excessive, since all 3 spices are very strong. I cut the amount of spice back by 2/3 when I cooked the dish and still felt the final product was a shade too spicy. I recommend proceeding with caution the first time you try it.

This is an easy, delicious dish. The spices are complex and satisfying as written, and the blackened onions (which I made in a cast-iron pan) are super. I used homemade chicken broth, and it was fine. This is one to add to the regular repertoire. I think it would also be good for a potluck.

Have tried another recipe that is similar but without the added spices, just as much onion -- also good and also veggie only. Can't imagine this with meat. I always wish I had carmelized even more onions, they deepen and almost sweeten the flavor a bit. Love this recipe and such a good way to eat lentils.

I liked this recipe a lot - I agree with the reviewer who said not to skip the onions. They really make the dish, and the yogurt was a nice addition as well, especially since I added some crushed red pepper flakes with the other spices and it turned out quite spicy. However, there seemed to be a little more liquid than needed.

I have to admit that I added the rice with the lentils, so the texture was a little off. Still the flavour was wonderful. With the leftovers we had some crumbled feta instead of the yohgurt, which was lovely.

Excellent. Very ethnic! It really doesn't need any meat, but I still want to try it with lamb the next time. Don't cut back on the spices, maybe add a little more for a more intense flavor. You have to add the onions, cucumber & tomato slices, the yogurt and some mint to experience a perfect, middle-eastern dish. Have a cup of mint tea after dinner!

A wonderful healthy and meat free dish. I don't think it needs any meat - great the way it is. It's nice to have a good meal the way it's meant to be without having to add meat to it. Hot dogs would totally RUIN this dish!

This is mjeddarra (sp?), which needs to be flavored with some kind of meat. Use any kind of stock you want, or even just water, but you should add some cooked bacon, cut up hotdog!!, or a little lamb. Also, unless you are used to the taste of cinnamon/allspice in main dishes, cut back on it a bit. You can eat this hot, warm, room temp, or cold. Makes great leftovers. With meat added for flavor, change to 4 forks!!!
