After reading the reviews, I also upped the flavor. I deglazed with a half cup of chardonnay. I used about 3 cups of beef stock, 2 of OJ, and 1 of red wine. That was enough liquid to cover the shanks so I stopped adding liquid at that point. I even threw in some thyme sprigs I had laying about. After cooking in a dutch oven, covered at 350 degrees, I strained the chunks out and began reducing. The reduction got quite flavorful even though the sauce itself wasn't quite thick. The sauce was slightly sweet but still it was a delicious complex flavor. I think a real chef could figure out how to tweak the ingredients. The star anise was the clearly dominant flavor. I would think that next time I would add some Grand Marnier, more orange zest, or even a vanilla bean to round out the flavor profile of the star anise. In fact, I didn't detect any orange flavor in the dish. Over all, this dish should impress most guests.

Fantastic. In light of other reviewers' comments that the sauce was bland, I substituted red wine and more beef stock for the chicken stock - which really has no place in a lamb dish. We pulled the lamb from the bone for service and served over potato gnocchi, with spicy sauteed broccoli rabe.

Meat was wonderfully tender, sauce was okay, although a little bland. This recipe seemed like a lot of work for a ho-hum result. We used dried star anise.

Absolutely delicious! I overcooked the lamb by mistake and it only made it better. I deglazed the pan with orange juice and the sauce was wonderful. Top notch with garlic mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach.

One of those few recipes that ended up delicious AND looking exactly as pictured in Bon Appetit. The star anise and orange juice blended extremely well.

I served this at a dinner party for 8. It worked well, being prepared in advance. Everyone liked it but it was a little on the bland side. I served it with spiced oranges and pistachio and mint couscous, which helped.
