I made this last Xmas and will make it again for my family and for friends. Excellent and not difficult.

Delicious...but how can you call these sugar free?

It is super easy, I will give it that. It was ok.. not as good as the bark you buy. NOTE, put the peppermint on first if crushed more finely than the pecans - otherwise it falls off.

dead easy to make and such a crowd pleaser! i used dove dark chocolate promises, melted them in a metal bowl over a pot on the stove, like another cook suggested, which worked wonderfully. used whole, large candy canes, which i unwrapped and double-bagged and smashed and poured - that worked out well. i would suggest not using the edge of a can, as it penetrated through the plastic bags. i poured the chocolate onto the prepared sheet, sprinked the candy and nuts and pressed with wax paper (another great tip) and popped it into the fridge. so many compliments with something so simple!

Very easy and delicious. I used 10 oz. of white chocolate and 10 oz. of bittersweet chocolate chips and swirled together after they softened. I crushed candy canes in a large ziplock freezer bag first with a rolling pin, then I finished them off with a hammer. Don't skip the pecans-they make the dessert!

So easy and tasty. I used roasted/salted pistachios and melted some of the peppermint dust (from crushing) into the chocolate instead of using mint chocolate. I mixed the nuts and candies into the chocolate before spreading and it worked great. Make sure not to skimp on the chocolate: 20 ozs with two cups of nuts&candy makes for some very chunky bark. Now I've got tons of other ideas: bark with espresso beans, bark with a little raspberry syrup and pretzels, bark with almonds and a dusting of chai latte mix on top... the possibilities are endless!

This is why I love epicurious. Used my predecessors' suggestions, such as crushing peppermints in their wrappers, melting the chocolate over hot water, sifting the candy powder into the chocolate...this is divine and equal to the flavor of high-priced, gourmet stuff. LOVE it!

very good- was severd at an auction party and I was delighted to see that less than a half of the recipe amount sold for $11 ! would defenitly make again mints were a little hard to crush. i used chocolate with nuts and did not use pecans.I Also did not use mint chocolate!

Very good-barks are so much easier than cookies for gift giving and look impressive. I'll do this every year for the holidays.

I'm giving this 4 fork rating because it truly is delicious. However, I did have a problem with cloudy and discolored chocolate on the underside of the bark. I followed the recipe exactly the first time around. It tasted great but was a little on the thin side and didn't like the discoloration on the backside. For my second batch I melted the chocolate chips in a bowl over hot water and took it off the heat for at least 10 minutes to make sure it was tempered. I used mini candy canes and followed a reviewers tip on crushing the candy in the wrappers. (Great tip, by the way!) Because I only had semi-sweet chocotate left, after I crushed the candy canes I put them thru a strainer and seperated the chunks from the powder and mixed the powder into the melted chocolate while it was resting. I poured it onto a prepared cookie sheet and spread to a desired thickness with a offset spatula. Then topped with the remaining chunky candy cane pieces and toasted pecans pressing lightley to make sure it was imbedded into the chocolate. Although it was a little more work, the results were excellent!

I have never in my life had a more luscious taste hit my taste buds. This dish had great flavor and it's a great holiday dish. It's a dish that everyone can enjoy and I would give it 10 out of 10 stars.

Great gift and easy recipe! I did it both with the hard candies chopped and small candy canes broken up...take the time to unwrap and chop the hard candy it is much better that way. I used Giradelli double choc chips - yummy and no chopping! Also did it with and without nuts, both were good. Used wax paper to press candy and nuts into choc - great tip! It does soften at room temp so handle carefully.

I made this for the first time, exactly as it said - to spread the melted chocolate and sprinkle the peppermint candies and pecans over it. When it hardened and I was breaking it up, most of the nuts fell off. I don't understand how they can stick when you're just sprinkling them on top. So I re-melted it all and mixed it all up and flattened it out again with wax paper and it worked MUCH better because everything was mixed together. You would need to save some of the peppermint to sprinkle on top for color though. I'll make it again because it is really good tasting, but I'll use a different method than what is described. (unless anybody has any other suggestions!)

6 batches later--this is DIVINE!! It's so easy it seems like cheating! I used Hershey's mint chocolate morsels, and half of a 6-ounce package of natural-peppermint green, red, and white candy canes from THE GROCERY STORE. I finally realized the easiest way to crush them was to leave them in the wrappers, place in a plastic bag, and gently pound with a meat tenderizer. Fingers may get sticky getting the pieces, but it's MUCH easier than peeling those wrappers when they're whole! I also melted a bag of white chocolate morsels, dropped it onto the melted (and spread) choclate and ran a knife through it before sprinkling the nuts and peppermint on top. A big hit at the neighborhood cookie exchange.
