Great bread! I followed the recipe exactly - and left the sponge in the fridge to ferment for about 15 hours. I didn't use any extra flour, but I did lightly oil my hands while working with the dough. The dough was a bit sticky, but not so much that I couldn't work with it! Turned out delicious - soft, moist, perfect. Cooking time was about 10 minutes less than the recipe.

Wow, the smell alone was worth the effort but the taste is incredible, too! I grew up on bland, squishy white bread and this was a revelation. Followed the recipe exactly, weighing ingredients and kneading this very sticky dough by hand. I was pretty worried because the dough was so slack, but it produced a very moist and tender loaf of bread. Follow the instructions as written, without trying to 'fix' it and you'll probably be fine. My one complaint would be that my loaf came out a little too squat for sandwich use. I think I my 8x4.5" bread pan might be out of spec and a bit too large for the dough volume specified.

I am a busy mother of 3 kids. I love this recipe and so does my family. I can prepare the starter the night before, make the bread in the morning, and it's so much better for us than store bought. I'm a huge allergy sufferer, so the fact that it calls for honey instead of sugar is the entire reason I picked this recipe. Thanks so much!

I just had my first slice of this bread and I love it. The only downside is the amount of time it takes to create, about 13 hours from start to finish.

Unfortunately I'm unable to follow this recipe due to the requirement for regional flours of limited availablity - not sure why the author did not state the particulars of the flours ie mesh, protein content, wheat strain??? corporate sponsorship! Assuming this is typical of the author's book, I'll not order it afterall :-(

This is the best sandwich bread I have ever made. My only complaint is the hardness of the crust, as my kids prefer the softer crust of store bought pre-sliced loaves. The texture is great and it really holds up when spreading peanut butter. I will continue to make this bread, though in the future I'll start the sponge the night before.

Note that different style salts weigh differently by volume. Use the weight measure to keep the recipe proportion when using kosher or other gourmet salts. This is a long recipe but well worth the wait.

Excellent results, except that there is not sufficient flour in the recipe to make this workable. Had to add more than 2 cups of flour in addition to what was called for in the recipe.

I made half my first batch of this bread into Cinnamon-Raisin Rolls, the second half into bread. Both turned out very well. After I cut the Cinnamon Rolls with dental floss I thought they looked pitifully small lying in the ceramic pans.....but they were HUGE after the final rise, prior to baking. More time consuming but a lighter dough than other Cinamon Roll recipes on Epicurious.

This bread is fantastic! I had to kind of plan ahead, to make it when I could be around the house for a pretty big chunk of the day - but it was well worth it. I've made it twice in the last week, and our little family of 3 had no trouble finishing every last crumb. The first time I let the sponge ferment 4 hours at room temp. The second time I left it in the fridge about 15 hours. Came out great both times. We like it better without the butter brushed over the top at the end...

If you are used to a country-style bread like Jim Lahey's No-Knead Bread, realize that this is a whole other animal. But it, too, is absolutely delicious and well worth the added effort. It also keeps quite well, and makes superb bread crumbs, although there usually isn't any left for that use. Fabulous plain with butter, and a great wrap for a burger; phenomenal toast.Wonderful texture and great flavor, and will now be made at my house once a week.

I am so excited to see the recipes from Beranbaum's book reprinted here. I just purchased The Bread Bible, and I have not purchased bread at the store since. I really agree that letting the dough ferment is key, however if you don't the bread is good just mellower. After much trial I have found that investing in a dough proofing bucket is a must. I found a cheap on at a local hardware store, and it is food grade. I made this recipe exactly as printed and I played with it a little, with the butter and with out. My final recommendation is long proofing time is the absolute best bread ever. My son doesn't want store bought bread ever again. I think I will go have some toast right now.
