We all had a blast the last time I made this recipe. The pork with the Chinese five-spice powder was very good. I jazzed up the ingredients that could go into the wraps and let everyone build their own. I julienned the snow peas, red cabbage, bean sprouts, and more. I just came online to find this recipe so I can make it again for friends. It tasted great, easy to make, and a lot of fun to eat!

Yum. Made with half pork and half tofu to use up what I had on hand. Will definitely make again.

Excellent! I used Romaine Lettuce instead of Bibb. It was a little more affordable where I live. I also made the dipping sauce but left out the optional garlic. Next time I probably would use a little less sugar. Both my husband and I loved it and since it's rare when that happens this will be making it's way onto our two week rotation. Yum!

Fantastic recipe. We used lean ground beef instead and kept the rest the same and it was wonderful. Quick, easy and delicious.

I substituted crumbled firm tofu for the pork, and added an extra clove of garlic and a tablespoon of fresh ginger to the mix as others had suggested. I served it with fresh chopped basil, peanuts, and hoisin sauce on top, and the rolls were sooo delicious! It is a healthy, tasty (and optionally vegan) dish that I'll definitely make again!

Make it veggi by substituting tofu (crumbled) for the pork. I prefer cinnimon over 5-star spice. Add sambal for a spicy kick. Let it marinate then stir fry or bake and brown in the oven. Play with fresh herbs either mint or cilantro when making the rolls. The meat lovers enjoyed!

This is a great easy during the week recipe. I add a chopped shallot to the meat mix. Sautee the shallot with the garlic and fresh ginger, if I have it, and when it is almost done, add the 5 spice powder to the sautee. I found that adding the powder to the meat results in uneven distribution. Adding it to the shallot mix gives a nice caramelized base. I also go easy on the sugar and heavier on the soy.

Nice and easy - and fun to play around with. I added chili sauce and ginger to the pork for a bit of kick. I also added cilantro and shredded coconut into the wraps; yummy.

This was such an easy recipe. I didn't have any soy sauce on hand, but did have a ginger/soy salad dressing that did the trick. I will definitely make this again.

Very good, simple meal. Next time I will use only 1T of brown sugar since I thought the dish a little too sweet.

I increased the garlic to 2 cloves and added about a tbsp of grated fresh ginger. I also added a handful of chopped mushrooms and water chestnuts to the pork while it cooked. After assembling the wraps I drizzled some hoisin sauce on top. Fantastic - just like the lettuce wraps our favorite local Chinese restaurant makes.

Simple, quick and good. I substituted ground turkey for the pork because I had it on hand. Makes a delicious weeknight meal.

Excellent dish, and SO easy to make! This is a great one to experiment with...we added some sambal oelek for heat, but if you want to make it more veggie you could cut some of the pork in favor of oinions, water chestnuts, or tofu...there are so many thinks you could do with this base recipe. The Bibb lettuce was kind of small, I may try something different next time, but the mild flavor of the Bibb is great for this dish.

Delicious, healthy, and fairly quick! What more could you want for a weekday meal with lots of flavor. I made a few additions. I sauteed a little fresh ginger with the garlic, used ground turkey rather than pork and spiced the meat up with siracha. I also added fresh mint, cilantro and sliced green onions into the wraps. Will definitely make again.

Quick, easy, and delicious! I didn't have 5 spice powder, so improvised with some cinnamon and clove. I may try using ground chicken some time in the future. This reminds me of the lettuce wraps at P.F. Chang and they're great to take to work for lunch.

I have always been checking this site for new food ideas. And this one was pretty good. I did not have the Bibb lettuce ( I live in a small town and its hard to find some ingredients you have three lettuce choices) but I added a red bell pepper minced to my fresh carrots and cucumbers. I also added a fresh minced clove of garlic to the fresh veggies. I love garlic, so often double or triple it. Otherwise, this was a great recipe and very simple to make. I added some rice to put inside the rolls. It would also taste great with rice paper to wrap the mixture in. This one is fun to experiment with! Enjoy!!

First, the review is incomplete. The first step is to saute the garlic until golden. Then follow the rest of the instructions. While I think this recipe is good, I think the addition of 2 tsp. hoisin sauce is needed to both thicken the sauce and give some needed depth to the dish. I actually served the leftovers the following day as a salad, using a hoisin vinaigrette as the dressing and it was very tasty.

Delicious recipe. I substituted the 1/3 of the olive oil for sesame oil. Added 1 extra clove of garlic and a little less sugar. The guests loved it.

The title of this recipe does not make sense and there are misspellings, not to mention incomplete instructions. This is shoddy work & Geneva is not wrong to point that out. While we all may not need to have a full illustration for the method of prep, some people may- and isn't that the point of cooking mags? This looks like something someone may have scribbled on a cocktail napkin to have an item to submit right before a deadline.

For crabtownc from Geneva--your indignant response suggests you are ready to awaken your intuition. To get you started, ingredients are usually listed in order of use. Imagine what you can do...Good luck!

Made it for dinner. Found the pork a bit sweet. Served with sriracha and soy sauce and they helped temper the sweetness. To make again, would decrease brown sugar, maybe add mint or cilantro leaves to the packets. SO QUICK!!!!
