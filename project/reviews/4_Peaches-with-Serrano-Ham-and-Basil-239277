My peaches weren't very ripe and the cumin was kind of odd in the recipe. I used prosciutto instead of serrano. Assembly is time consuming. Not a repeater:(

This has become one of my favorite summer appetizer recipes. It always receives rave reviews. The only substitute that I make is to use prosciutto instead of serrano ham. Also, make sure your peaches are ripe for the best flavor.

Used procuitto instead of serrano ham. Used red wine vinegar rather than sherry vinegar (could not find). These were AMAZING!!!!!

I took the peaches and basil and stuffed them into ham and cheese sandwiches. Perfect balance of flavors.

This recipe as is,with nectarines substituted for peaches, was delicious and paired with a nice spanish grenache wine was just loveley. It had a naturally sweet but fresh flavour. The recipe was asked for by all. Thank you.

I didn't use the sugar or cumin, but did drizzle on a nice Sherry vinegar. We agreed that the vinegar made the dish. This is a nice alternative to melon wrapped in Proscuitto. It's a nice appetizer for summer time.

Very tasty! Although, I only used prosciutto, basil, and peaches... it was perfect.

Nice idea. I drizzled the bites w/really good balsamico and it was perfect. Everyone loved them. Definitely an easy, elegant starter for keeps.

i'll admit the presentation was gorgeous but i really hated the seasoning on the peaches, i thought it was way too much for the nice, fresh juicy summer peaches. i will make this again but will leave the peaches natural

So easy and really flavorful...made a big impact for little effort. It's essential to use in- season peaches, though! I used prosciutto since I couldn't find serrano ham, and it worked perfectly well.

These are delicious, relatively healthful (as appetizer/finger-food goes), beautiful in the presentation, and super-easy to make. I brought them to a party and everyone oohed and aahed and wanted to taste them.

I made this last evening with fresh B.C. peaches. It was interesting, but not out of this world.

My guests loved the infusion of flavors.I asked them to be honest as I would write a review for this recipe. It was a hit that I included on the table for my italian "Apertivo" evening.

I used nectarines and prosciutto - because that's what I had. It was an explosion of flavors - really unique and delicious.
