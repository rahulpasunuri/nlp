One of my favorites when we have Christmas, special guests, or my husband's birthday. We do it gluten and dairy free, so GF broth and no cheese, it's absolutely delicious! Always have rave reviews from whoever we treat! Served with the Yukon Gold and Fennel Puree with Rosemary Butter also on this site.

Rating: 4
LOVE this recipe!! It's very easy, and is so delicious. However, it takes WAY longer than 8 minutes to reduce the sauce. They must have been boiling the pan on the surface of the sun, as it took me at least 20-25 minutes to get it reduced (and I have a Wolf commercial-grade burner). I also put a bit more butter in the sauce, but then I love butter, and am never one to shy away from it.

After all the wonderfully positive reviews, I'm almost embarrassed to post something less enthusiastic, but I found this rather mediocre. I followed the recipe pretty closely except that I doubled the sauce. I had very good ingredients, including some lovely Harvest Farms tenderloin. The steaks cooked perfectly (my thanks to the reviewer who suggested turning twice at 2-minute intervals rather than once at 3 minutes). The sauce came together well and was quite good. But the tenderloin and the sauce didn't marry up very well, and the sauce and the gorgonzola seemed uncomfortable together. The cheese and port reduction together atop the beef, even in very small quantities, overwhelmed the delicate tenderloin so far that I wonder if I could have identified the animal at all by its flavor. I suggest saving that sweet-savory sauce for a hearty pork roast, sprinkling the gorgonzola on a salad, and saving the tenderloin for a different dish.

The other thing I would add is to cook the steaks by flipping every 2 mintues 3 times to get the 6 minutes a time. It seems to be much better to get it to med rare. It's called "THE STEAK" at our house. my 11 Bonus Daughter LOVES IT!

I make this with the leftover port and Stilton from Christmas every year. And then a few other times as well - it is one of my favorite recipes. I make as directed. The port is a must. I used red wine a few times and it is good but not exceptional.

Rating: 4
I made this as written (except I used a couple of NY Strips) and it was really really good. I paired it with "Yukon Gold and Fennel Puree with Rosemary Butter" and "Arugula Salad with Pears, Oven-Dried Grapes, and Roasted-Shallot Vinaigrette" (both also from Epicurious), and it outstanding. Next time I make this, and there will definitely be a next time, I'll probably use more port and less beef broth because I thought the port flavor got lost a bit.

One of my 'go to' recipes on epicurious since 2000! For a special treat, a show-stopping meal, or if you are craving something that feels like restaurant food, but is easy to prepare...just do it! It's been two years since I made this one..just thought it deserved a new review!

This sauce was excellent-made it for Christmas Eve- it got rave reviews. We grilled the steaks outside, so there was no scraping up browned bits etc. Also, I strained the sauce - and melted the gorgonzola in it - about half the amount it called for. Superb!

This recipe makes me look like a HERO! It's loved by everyone I make it for. It takes a lot longer to make the sauce then stated by about 20 minutes.

another option is using lamb chops,dried cherries, and feta cheese. excellent flavors!!

Great!!!! Very favorable and extremely easy to make. We served each steak over a small portion of angel hair pasta with a little parmesan cheese and it turned out to be a great addition. Added a small decadent carved carrot and fresh rosemary for garnish and it looked like a meal made for a king. We will definitely serve this again.

Rating: 3
Gopd choice for Christmas menu. I thought the sauce was too sweet; maybe there are different levels of sweet in dried cranberry? I crumbled the gorgonzola on top as directed but if I made it again I'd melt it in the sauce as another reviewer suggested, it would give the sauce more tang (and maybe cut the sweetness that bothered me), and also people tended to just shove the gorgonzola off the top and to the side.

Fantastic! Made this for Christmas dinner to rave reviews from my family ages 11 to 56. Made sauce well before dinner, and finished off as steaks cooked. Although sauce required longer than 8 minutes for reduction, would not add ANY flour, cornstarch, thickener. Let cool slightly, and it is superb. Served with garlic roasted potatoes, and haricots verts with caramelized shallots. Looking forward to cooking this again.

While I have made multiple recipes from epicurious before, this is the first time I felt like I HAD to write a review. This recipe is a keeper. The sauce is absolutely, out of this world, amazing! Very easy and quick to make, but the results are fantastic, restaurant-worthy. I would be making this again, especially to impress my family.

..oh and another thing, i didn't have the port wine for the cranberry steak sauce and went with the 3 to 1 ratio of red wine to balsamic vinegar and it was delicious. Just great suggestions!!!

Rating: 4
THIS WAS AWESOME!!!!! I was SUPER nervous of cooking steak..seems so difficult to get it "medium rare", but this tells you exactly how long per side. Even the juice in the skillet trick at the end was fantastic, simple, but great. The 1st part DID take 20 min. to thicken, and as mentioned by others, I served it seperately in a bowl. Honestly, if you like steak alone (like my husband) you coulda done without this 1st cranberry sauce part, but I loved it....and easy to boot!! I can't believe how easy this was! Thx!

I have made epicurious recipes for years, but this is the first time I have taken the time to rate a recipe. This recipe is simply fabulous. The reduction sauce is excellent. The recipe is simple to make and perfect for special occasions. I will definitely be making it again soon. I made the recipe the way it was written and would not change a thing.

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was excellent, but I have to admit that I tweaked it a little. First, I browned a whole tenderloin in a cast iron skillet on the stove and finished it off in the oven. Second, I didn't have any port, so I mixed 3 parts red wine to 1 part good balsamic vinegar. It was perfect. I passed the sauce and the Gorgonzola separately.

I made a whole roast tenderloin for Christmas Eve dinner. I made this sauce through the "set aside" step, the night before and finished it with the drippings from the roast. It was amazing! I can't wait to try it again with the grilled steaks. Christmas Eve dinner was a huge success.

No need to add or subtract, this recipe stands on its own two feet and takes down the house!

I served this sauce over sliced tenderloin (that I roasted whole while my guests were having cocktails) for a recent dinner party for 20. I prepared it the night before and simply reheated just prior to plating the entree. A spoonful of sauce, topped with crumbled Cabrales and a sprig of fresh rosemary - absolutely delicious....and so easy.

Absolutely fabulous!!! I plan on making the sauce for another favorite of mine, the Blue Cheese Encrusted filets. The flavor was very flavorful, slightly sweet, with a great texture.

This was fantastic! Followed recipe exactly except I substituted 1/4 of a medium onion for shallot (was out). When reading the recipe I thought the sauce sounded a little too sweet for my tastes but because of all the glowing reviews I tried it anyway. Wow am I glad I did. The sweet flavor of the cranberries and port and the tang of the cheese together make a wonderful tasting sauce. It was not overly sweet at all.Reducing the sauce took about 20 minutes. My husband who claims he does not like port or cranberries gave it an "excellent" rating. I am looking forward to making it again...soon.

This is such a hit in my house. I have made it several times and it couldnt be easier or more of a "wow" dinner. This is a keeper@!!!!!! All my neighbors are making it for valentines day. This is totally kid friendly too. ( can leave off the gorgonZola for them if need be....my kids loved it with)

10JAN08, I am reporting to you from the kitchen of my home. Two nights ago, in an apparent random act of epicurean delight, I made this dish for about the tenth time, in a brazen attempt to assuage my appetite. I must inform you that the assault was highly effective having rid the insurgent appetite with devastating satisfaction. I followed the barrage with a Mouton Cadet, plain mashed potatoes, with a carefully deployed buttered and pan-fried vegetable medley consisting of, yellow zucchini, snap peas and red pepper. Back to you Wolf!

I made this Monday night for my husband's birthday and it was phenomenal! Our local grocery store is a bit skimpy on choice, so I could only find a dried mix of cranberries, blueberries and cherries. Also, no fresh rosemary so I had to use dried. Didn't matter, I think, because the taste was still very special.

If I could, I would give this recipe 3.5 forks. It was wonderful, fairly easy, and quick. However, it does take significantly longer than the recipe says to reduce the sauce. Perfect for a cozy dinner on a cold day.

Wonderful easy dish. Flavours are fabulous. I was little dubious about doing the tenderloins on the stove top but did and they worked beautifully! The sauce takes longer to reduce than the recipe says so I started cooking the tenderloins while I was doing the sauce. I made this for New Years Eve dinner for my husband. Had Shiitake Frittata Hors D'Ouvres. Baby greens salad with pear dressing. Roasted baby potatoes and roasted mushrooms. Vanilla ice cream with apricots preserved in amaretto over the top and then chocolate dipped strawberries at midnight with champagne. I'll definitely be making this again.

Really great. I used a tenderloin roast and grilled it as others suggested. The sauce was excellent but does take longer to reduce than 8 minutes, especially when the recipe is doubled. It would be incredible on any really good cut of beef.

I made this for my wife tonight and it was absolutely awesome. Make certain to get a melt-in-your-mouth cut of beef tenderloin and buy real garganzola rather than the crumbles. It makes a difference. I grilled my tenderloins and made a slight change to the sauce: I had a lot of solids after the reduction so I pureed some of the shallots and garlic with the last quarter-cup of the beef broth; then I added that to the sauce and whipped in the last two tablespoons of butter to make the sauce a little thicker and creamier. I also cooked the Carrots Glazed with Balsamic Vinegar and Butter as a side, and it went very, very well with the main dish. Served Five Rivers Merlot from central California - a nice accompaniment. My wife is on the phone with her best friend right now, raving about the dinner. The recipe is definitely a keeper.

Fabulous! I used blackcurrant, apple and Thyme reduction instead of cranberries, worked perfectly. Got the desired effect!

Fabulous flavor, as good as I've had at any fine restaurant! We grilled the steaks so I added all broth during the reduction and stirred in the rosemary toward the end. Regarding the longer reduction times, consider using a skillet instead of a saucepan to increase the surface area - that should help.

Rating: 3
My guests enjoyed this, though I don't think any of us will be "talking about it for months", as reported by some. I note a few people needed to thicken the sauce. I certainly did. I suggest making a roux of equal parts VERY soft butter and flour blended together until very smooth. A tablespoon of each might be enough, though I doubled the recipe and needed two of each. Stir it in as the sauce is on a low boil. It's the ideal way to thicken any sauce or soup.

As others have said, a good quality cut of meat is key, but other than that, you can't go wrong. I found that measuring out all of the ingrediants before I started cooking really helped. I served this with the "CARROTS GLAZED WITH BALSAMIC VINEGAR AND BUTTER" recipe that can be found on this site. Both were excellent.

This is a totally awesome dish. It has become the gold standard for family gatherings. My sons absolutely love it. The blend of flavors is not to be beat. I have always used the expensive tenderloin cut, but it would probably work with any cut of steak, it just might not be as tender. Enjoy!

This is a fabulous recipe. My daughter gave me this a year ago, and I didn't realize this was where she got it until I saw it here. Everyone I have ever made this for has insisted on having the recipe!! I like to add a tad more cranberries than the recipe calls for, only because I really love them. I am currently living overseas and, unfortunately, cannot get dried cranberries here. I ususally mail a bunch back, but when I've run out, I have substituted dried apricots/raisin mixture. Not quite as good, but is o.k. in a pinch. TRY IT...YOU'LL LOVE IT!

Terrific sauce. Since I grilled the ribeye steaks, I put all the ingredients for the sauce in one pan and reduced it to maybe a half a cup. How simple is that. The aroma, while it was reducing, was incredible. While it was reducing, I made a mushroom and truffle oil risotto and steamed some green beans. It took a half an hour of standing at the stove stirring the risotto while everything else cooked. The sauce is too simple to be that good. The combination of the sauce, the steak, and the topping of gorgonzola was a taste thrill.

Rating: 4
Reviewing sauce only - beyond delicious! The sauce is so perfect. I served this for Christmas dinner using turkey scallopini instead of steaks and chicken broth instead of beef broth. It was a wonderful chance to serve traditional turkey in a whole new way. The gorgonzola is delicious with the cranberries and port; many rave reviews. Served with roasted garlic mashed potatoes and steamed green beans. P.S. The sauce takes much longer than 8 minutes to reduce so plan accordingly.

Rating: 4
Very good! Although I have never cooked tenderloin steaks over a stove top, I understand why this recipe calls for it. They were so moist and tender and the scraped brown bits must be added to the sauce. Use a good Port. I added extra cranberries and minced the garlic instead of slicing. Don't skip the cheese!

Rating: 3
Yes, I would make this again. It was great, the sauce was to die for. The only thing with the one I made was that my husband did the shopping and picked up Craisins instead of plain dried cran, and Craisins are sweetened. So if I was to use them again, I would throw in a little vinegar for a little zip. Other than that, I did everything as written except using only 2 steaks with the full amount of sauce, since we are sauce lovers. Really great flavors, really easy to make. YUM!

I made this recipe for (2), knowing that neither of us likes cranberries - but after reading the reviews thought it was worth a shot. Had the butcher cut (1) filet in half, which made the perfect thickness, and for the most part followed the recipe to the tee. Take a chance on this one - even if the ingrediants sound like an odd mix - we ate every bite - and wanted more! Served with simple roasted garlic mashed potatoes from this site, and green beans. Total time in the kitchen was about an hour! I defintely plan to bring this one back for a holiday dinner party!

This dish was incredible! The only downside is that it is a little costly to make, so in te future for large crowds (like I had last night), I might use less expensive steaks, and the gorgonzola was also much pricier than perhaps another pungent cheese might be. others are right about the length of time it takes for the port/broth mixture to reduce. It was DELICIOUS!

Fabulous and easy - great combination. Sauce takes longer to reduce than indicated. Good quality port and gorgonzola shine in this recipe.

This is divine! We've used Epicurious for years and have yet to make a recipe we didn't like, but this one may just be the best ever. A few minor changes, however... Wine reduction takes quite a bit longer than suggested, and we cooked the meat for quite a bit less. Makes for a beautiful presentation and is definitely fancy restaurant quality!

Rarely give 4 forks, but this was incredible!! Restaurant quality. Cut recipe in 1/2 and used Pinot Noir instead of port and sauce was fine. The sweetness of the cranberries and the tartness of the blue cheese went so well together. I'm saving this recipe!

Tried this with venison medallions for a Saturday fireside feast and it turned out impeccable. It is essential to use good quality port if the dish is to live up to its four fork potential.Went to my favorite cheese stuff for some reserve gorgonzola. Mmmm...

Delicious - agree with the other reviewers that topping the steaks with cheese before spooning the sauce over them is a great change. Also, the sauce reduces considerably - so be careful else you won't have enough sauce for the dish. The sauce flavor is very powerful - less expensive steaks could be used to the same effect.

Excellent recipe!!! Served it at dinner party and everyone loved it. Served it with a spinash salad, Smashed red skins and honey ginger glazed carrots (from epicurious). Presentation and flavor was great. Will serve this again.

I have made this dish several times now, and each time my husband and I can't help but exclaim again how absolutely delicious these flavors are together. I have used tri tip steaks in the past and last night put the sauce and cheese over buffalo ribeye steaks (if you've never had buffalo, you really need to try it!). I love this dish for company, because it's easy and elegant.

Excellent! Very elegant and easy. I used premium quality 2" thick filet mignon steaks, but cut them in half (1" thick) for faster cooking. My guests were truly impressed.

Needed a little more than 5 minutes on each side, so I cooked the filets in the sauce for another 2-3 minutes. Awesome

I made this for guests last night and although we all enjoyed it, I've made better tenderloin recipes. I made 2 mistakes. I grilled the steaks and the char flavor overpowered the sauce and, you don't get the 'browned bits' flavor in the sauce as with sauteeing. I strained the sauce as another reviewer suggested. It may have been more flavorful and interesting had I not strained it but either way it was too thin and next time I would thicken it a little. I served it with Portobello-Layered Mashed Potatoes from Cooking Light, Balsamic Roasted Onions, and Artichoke, Romaine & Cherry Tomato Salad (BA 7/00) which were all excellent.

This recipe is excellent and perfect for a dinner party. We have made this several times and it always gets rave reviews. I would definitely cook the filet in a skillet because you need the meat drippings in the pan for the sauce. Use filet mignon or tenderloin steaks, it makes all the difference. Enjoy!

Maybe I was too excited by all the yummy reviews I read here, but the sauce was a tad disappointing. I mean, it was *good*, but certainly not extraordinary. Obviously, YMMV.

I agree with the chef from Austin below. Grill the steaks over a fire (even if it's winter in Chicago), but the rest is great.

One of the most delicious beef recipes I've ever made!! I used stilton instead of gorgonzola and a little less butter. Otherwise, it was to die for.

This meal is excellent. If you are like me and love to try new receipes, even at an important dinner party - this is the one to make! It was so easy and so delicious. My husband is still talking about it months later!

We grill the steaks, but no need to add or change anything else with this recipe!

Why go out when you can make this exquisite dish at home? The sauce was awesome, and even though a number of the members of my dinner party don't like cranberries - everyone adored the sauce. Adding the gorgonzola was the crowning touch - and part of what made this dish great. We will make this dish many times in the future - both as an easy work day treat meal (because it's so quick and easy)- and as a nice meal for company.

This sauce was SOOOOO GOOD !!! and so easy. Served the dish with herb mashed potatoes (put sauce on those too) and haricot verts. Simply smashing ! Would make again for dinner guests this weekend as they are foodies but price of tenderloin (two weeks in a row) is a bit much but I will save this one for a later date... My advice: Try It ! You'll like it !

I loved this I tries it because I was experimenting with gorgonzola cheese with tenderloin I recommend sliting the roast and adding the cheese inside with a drizzle of bourbon steak sauce it made the meat very tender and sweet

I cooked a full beef tenderloin on the grill, then sliced it, and I used dried cherried instead of cranberries. I served it for a dinner party. Everyone said it was excellent.

Wow. What a great recipe! It makes a grand impression for a dinner party. I placed a pile of mashed potatoes in the middle of the plate, stacked the tenderloin on top, poured the sauce over it and garnished it with fresh rosemary. You would of thought I was a chef!

I used fresh cranberries, made the sauce early and put in refrig. Used our favorite beef tenderloin on the grill. sauce is awesome, my dad even put it on his mashed potatoes.

This fool would have to agree, that this dish is foolproof. I doubled the recipe for guests, cooking the meat in two batches, and it turned out perfect. Like others, I served this with roasted garlic mashed potatoes. The meat I got for the recipe was on the expensive side, but truly good meat is worth it's weight in gold. Simple, delicious, and impressive--a real winner! I must admit, I have been screening my recipes from Epicurious based on the reviews. While I realize that tastes vary, those recipes that have had unanimous enthusiastic praise (like this one) have yet to let me down.

I needed a last minute dinner idea and chose this one entirely by the rave reviews. It was by far one of the easiest and most delicous recipes i've come across. I ended up using Craisins since i couldn't find unsweetend dried cranberries. It was perfect! I served it with asparagus bundles wrapped in prosciutto and mashed potatoes.

The sauce in this dish was fabulous! My whole family loved it. This would be a great meal for company, it's pretty easy and the presentation is impressive. I will make this again.

I made this dish for my husband's birthday dinner and it was absolutely delicious!! He thought I had spent hours on the meal but the recipe is so simple and foolproof. Served it with roasted garlic mashed potatoes, steamed asparagus and a bottle of 1995 Silver Oak Cab. He's still raving about the meal!

Delicious!!!! I made a few changes. Roasted a 3.5lbs. tenderloin and stuffed it with small diced shallots, garlic, carrots, leeks, shiitake mushrooms, red peppers, seasoned with salt & pepper (saute everything first for about 5 minutes, let cool and add cheese to the mix). Served with pumpkin risotto. Everyone loved it!!!

This dish was WONDERFUL! The sauce does take much longer than 8 minutes to reduce, but it is well worth the wait! I made this dish for my new boyfriend, I had never cooked for him before - he was definitely impressed! This one is a keeper!

Rating: 4
This dish is absolutely fabulous! The taste rivals that of any restaurant-prepared beef tenderloin. I have made it twice already with excellent results. I did cook the sauce longer than stated so that it was a thicker consistency. I also added an extra tablespoon of butter at the end of cooking for a bit of extra richness and decadence. Definitely a keeper!

OUTSTANDING! There were only two of us eating, but we made the full sauce recipe. Not a drop left! We grilled filet mignon instead of pan-frying, but that's just our preference. We will definitely make this many more times!

Rating: 4
Mmm! Served to a dinner guest and he loved it. I boiled my sauce for WAY longer than 8 minutes and it barely reduced at all, though. Added a bit or cornstarch and it thickened up some, I might ad more next time to keep the sauce from running all over the plate--but the flavor was wonderful. Since it was thin, I had leftover sauce which I froze and am planning to serve as a welcome home dinner to my out-of-the-country boyfriend!

This was fabulous! We grilled the tenderloins, strained the sauce adding a handful of dried cranberries and thickening just a little with a flour slurry as recommended by another reviewer. I served this with plain risotto, buttered yellow wax beans and popovers.

I usually don't try new recipes on people I haven't cooked for, or haven't tried myself. I went strictly off the reviews and followed the recipe as written. WOW!! We were all close to licking our plates clean! A very easy sauce to make and it makes a very impressive presentation. This is a keeper!

This is UNBELIEVABLE!! As Emeril would say, "BAM"!! I have made this for many friends and some who are in the restaurant biz'. I have not made any changes to the sauce, but prefer filet mignon's over the tenderloins when entertaining.

Fabulous tasting. I made this for my boyfriend and there was nothing leftover. I used dried cherries and cranberries for variety and the sauce was wonderful--I will make extra next time. The tangy chees adds nice contrast. Drink with a nice Pinot Noir or Zinfandel.

This recipe was FABULOUS! The very best sauce for red meat ever! The only problem was that the sauce took quite a long time to make. In the future I would start the sauce in advance.

Absolutely Great! I added 2 T. of red wine vinegar to the sauce though, to brighten the flavor. Caught my husband running his finger around the plate and licking it when he was taking his dish into the kitchen. Definitely a keeper.

This is the most awesome sauce I have ever had on a steak. The mixture of flavors from the cranberries and the blue cheese is wonderful. I have served it several times for guests and everyone raved about it. Even those who think they don't like blue cheese.

This was FANTASTIC! It was simple and delicious. I recommend this to anyone trying to impress his or her significant other! The only thing I did differently was add fresh cranberries rather than dried. It gave the sauce a bit of a bite. I highly recommend this!

Oh my goodness: This was so delicicous AND so easy! OK, here are my changes: We used all chopped shallot and no garlic. I didn't reduce the sauce further after cooking the steak, just added the rosemary. Also, we served it over a sliced, medium rare NY strip...personally, I had to restrain from licking the plate, the sauce was so good.

Well we made this recipe and then made this recipe and then made this recipe! Fabulous. We like best with extra garlic and without the gorgonzola - if using gorgonzola go sparingly or can overpower.

I'm adding this to my list of all-time favorites! After reducing the sauce, I strained it through a wire strainer and added a handful of dried cranberries. While not necessary, it makes a more attractive presentation. At the end, I also added a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce.

This dish was one of the BEST ever. I made this for our anniversary dinner for two. I served it with asparagus, a salad of baby greens and crusty bread. I left out the garlic (my husband's request), and used fresh rosemary in the sauce. THE BEST STEAK RECIPE I HAVE FOUND ON EPICURIOUS!!

This was wonderful! I used ribeye steaks, rubbed with fresh cracked pepper and grilled on charcoal. Made the sauce ahead of time and kept warm. The port and cranberries are an excellent compliment to the cheese.

I made this for my husband's birthday and he told me that it was the best meal he's ever eaten!! I agree! The best part about it was that it was really easy to make. It took about 15 - 20 minutes to reduce the sauce and I used all of the sauce for the two of us. Yum!!

This recipe was AMAZING. I made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it. The gorganzola went really well with the port flavour in the sauce. I will definitely be making this dish again but next time would roast the entire piece of tenderloin or grill it on the barbeque.

This was excellent. I was a little reluctant since gorgonzola is so similar to bleu cheese and my husband hates that. But, he loved it but would only give 3 forks since he says he has yet to have a 4 fork meal. It was EASY and good.
