This is really delicious - the yogurt/garlic/mint combo is fantastic. And simple, especially if you have a gas grill

I live in Israel where the mediterranean cuisine is prevalent. Eggplants are a staple and many times prepared like the recipe, with labaneh. But there is a similar recipe which is really good and non-dairy (vegan): Keep the eggplant whole, cut slits lengthwise in the peel. Roast over open fire or alternatively on the grill, until the eggplant is totally collapsed and mushy, the skin charred (20-40 mins). Serve on a platter, slit open with skin on bottom, and top with tahini sauce. This is great as an appetizer or side dish, goes well with pita bread or any other bread. The roasting gives the eggplant a smokey, deep flavor, and the cold tahini greatly compliments it. To easily prepare your own tahini sauce: 1 c. raw tahini, 1/3 c. water, juice from half a lemon, 1 chopped garlic clove, 1/4 c. chopped parsly (optional). Mix in small bowl till combine, add parsley to garnish.

Very easy and delicious. I grilled yellow and green zucchini as well for added color. I added a tad of lemon juice to Greek yogurt (Trader Joes) and put in a squeeze bottle and drizzled on top, so it was a "lighter" dish. I friseed the mint which was pretty.

Simple and superb. I didn't have a grill so had to pan fry the eggplant, but did so using only about 1 tsp of oil. I also salted the eggplant and let it sit for about 20 minutes before frying. It was creamy, flavorful and light at the same time.

Followed the recipe and used a ridged pan on the range to grill the eggplant. First time I ever tried lebneh and it was delicious with the added garlic. This is a keeper and will accompany future entrees, today it was broiled pork chops with bone in.

Made this tonight with smaller asian eggplants (the variegated purple and white kind) along side some grilled shrimp, zukes, onions and purple peppers. Made the Lebneh stand-in by combining a bit of organic whole milk sour cream with greek yogurt....fresh garlic in a mortar and pestle with a little grey salt, and mint from the garden. Absolutely delicious and perfect for a summer night grill meal. Beautiful presentation, and a delightful flavor combination. Will definitely make this again and again. I sliced the eggplant into rounds, salted it, and let it stand, weighed down, between a couple of paper towels. I think salting any eggplant makes a huge difference in the finished product. Try it!!

Fantastic! Simple and delicious. Used Greek yogurt. Can't wait for our own eggplants - garden freshness will make this even better!

For the cook who described how to make the yogurt: I am Greek and watched my Sweet Mother make yogurt, exactly as you described, all my life, right down to hanging it in a damp cloth to drain - everything as you stated. Boy, what memories -

You can make a pretty good lebnah by bringing 1 gal of whole milk just to the boil.Remove from heat and stir in 1 large cooking spoon of plain yogurt. Put the lid on the pot, wrap in a blanket and let set undisturbed for 24 hours. Place the contents into a cheesecloth bag, hang it up and let water drip out until contents of bag becomes consistency of softened cream cheese. Remove and enjoy.

This tasty and attractive dish was a great addition to my middle eastern themed dinner. Unfortunately I couldn't find lebneh and substitued sour cream, which was less authentic but absolutely delicious. I served this with Saada's tabbouleh from this site.
