I read what many people said and made some alterations to the recipe. I used 1 tsp cumin, 1 tsp garam masala and 3 tsp yellow curry. I also added 2 large cloves of garlic. I used organic chicken broth instead of vegetable broth (which has no taste). Instead of salt, I used original Spike. I also added a little lemon juice and between a tsp and a tbsp of agave for a little sweet to balance out all the flavors. My husband and I went back for seconds! It was so quick and easy

I've made this soup multiple times, and I've found that the quality and freshness of the curry powder makes all the difference. My favorite version is the bulk curry available at Whole Foods, but if I keep it airtight in the cupboard for even a few weeks, the quality of the soup suffers. But when the spices are fresh, it's great. I frequently add a bit of lemon juice and some extra cumin. The garam masala that many other reviewers like is a bit sweet for me. I always have to add about 1.5 times the total liquid as what's in the recipe, but that's not a big deal. This is a really healthy winner at our house, often served with crusty bread and our favorite Humboldt Fog cheese. (Yes, it sounds strange with curry, but it's really good!)

This is a great recipe as written, I've made it many times. Sometimes I don't have fresh greens so I put in frozen kale or spinach and it's always good.

Everyone in this comment thread agrees that the recipe desperately needs something more, which tells me that this recipe is a fail. I added salt, more curry powder, garam masala, and substituted Red Chard for the Swiss Chard. It didn't quite work. It had some flavor but not the right flavor. I would not make this recipe again.

We added 3 huge cloves of garlic as others have suggested, and it still tasted kind of blah. But then with adding and tasting, we ended up stirring in at least a full teaspoon of salt, and by the end it was super delicious. Obviously salt levels in stock/broth vary, so this might just be a recipe that requires a liberal taste-and-season approach.

This was really good. I added sliced garlic and garam masala, and (as we are not vegetarian) used chicken stock instead of vegetable, and added a little cut-up chicken sausage. Would definitely make again.

I added four cloves of garlic and 2TB of curry, but I still thought it was bland. The greek yogurt helped a little bit, and it needed a lot of salt. Still, I felt like I have curry veggie soup recipes that I like a whole lot better.

Followed others' recommendations to add garam masalla, extra curry powder and 3 garlic cloves. I also added a couple splashes of piri piri sauce. It was very tasty; however, when ready to serve it was one of the ugliest looking dishes ever---it did not look remotely like the recipe photo!

Husband had a summer cold, he's vegan, so this fit the bill exactly to clear his sinuses. As othere suggested, I added 3 garlic cloves, 2 Tbsp curry, 1 Tbs garam masala. I used chopped baby spinach instead of the chard because it's what I had. YUM!

We loved this. So delicious and healthy and it comes together very quickly. I did add three cloves of garlic as suggested by other reviewers. Also, I used two tablespoons of Madras curry powder and one tablespoon of garam masala. I omitted the cayenne since Madras curry is so spicy on its own. I will definitely make this again.

I have made this now 4 times and think it is terrific! I have made it for my family, my bookclub, my friend who had a baby and one who had a recent surgery- rave reviews all around. I did add garam masala along with the curry powder as someone suggested. But other than that, a bit of salt and it is good to go. So hearty and flavorful. It is now a staple in our house!

Rating: 4
My oh my...this is FABULOUS. I did follow many of the recommended changes--added garlic, upped the cayenne to 1/2 t., added 1 T garam masala, added salt, sauteed kale stems with onions and added lots more kale than called for, and added chopped cilantro at the end. Did do one other thing not seen in the reviews I read: the soup seemed very, very thick, so I put in 64 oz. (2 quarts)of chicken broth rather than the 42 oz. called for in the recipe. LOVED the texture of the kale; had just the right amount of heat; and all the other flavors combined for a wonderfully exotic richness.

Rating: 4
This is a very delicious and hearty soup. We love things spicy so I increased the Cayenne to 1 tsp and added 1 tsp of Garam Masala. I took the advice of others and cooked the Chard stems with the onion and increased the Chard to 15 cups. Absolutely delicious. We make homemade soup at least 3 times a month and my husband has declared this his all time favorite. PS, we skipped the yogurt, but sure it would have been good with that too.

Rating: 4
One of my favorites on epi! Healthy, hearty. We've made this 4 to 5 times in 6 months, it never fails. I'd say you could use way more chard. When you cook it you barely even notice it. Make sure to add a spoon full of greek yogurt to each bowl.

Rating: 4
This dish was simple, fast and absolutely delicious. I would recommend in a heartbeat. I added a good amount of salt per other reviews, and doubled the amount of cayenne since our household likes moderately spicy dishes. Serve it with rice and white wine or beer, and you've really got a hearty meal. We ate some leftovers a few days later with some warm pita bread for lunch... Even tastier!

this dish was excellent with the addition of garam masala and some coriander! my husband and I are not huge lentil fans but we loved this dish and would definitely make over and over again

Great as is, and this recipe is quite flexible. Yes, you can certainly add the chard stems once the onions are browned (and I usually skip the chickpeas if I do, given the volume of stems). You can also use French green lentils instead of red, just know that you'll have to cook them (sans chard leaves) for a good 25 minutes on simmer. I also usually mix in a tablespoon or two of harissa, since I always have it on hand (and this can take care of the garlic / salt / chili mods in one fell swoop).

Really enjoyed this. Followed some modifications suggested here and I wouldn't change it: added 2 minced cloves of garlic towards the end of the onion saute and 1 tsp garam masala.Would definitely make this gaain.

This is really yummy! I agree that if made as written, it is very bland. I added a little ground coriander, garam masala and salt and pepper. In fact, the salt alone would probably have been sufficient. I also followed others and added chopped swiss chard stems and garlic to the onions. I used half chicken broth and half vegetable broth, and did not add the swiss chard leaves until the end. I thought I would be smart and prepare this ahead, but it looks prettier if served as soon as it's cooked. Maybe it does taste better if it sits, but it definitely gets that pea soup look to it. I would definitely make this again. Its easy and nutritious!

Delicious! I followed the recipe pretty closely but used 2 cans of chicken broth, added garlic and diced carrot, and served it over basmati rice. A perfect cold-weather stew that really fills you up! The yogurt is a must.

I followed the recipe nearly to a T (just used homemade chicken stock in place of veg broth) and it was . . . awful. Who would have thought anything with 5 tsp curry could be bland, but this was. Hoping a little time would help meld the flavours I tried it the next day. Bad. Worse! It turned a very ugly, pond-scum green (thanks to the chard), and none of the usual culinary tricks for pepping something up (lemon juice, butter, more spice) were any help. Waste of good chicken broth.

Rating: 3
This dish is great. My boyfriend (who rarely eats vegetarian dinners) kept returning for more. I served it more like a Pakistani curry with rice and the yogurt (agreed that this is a necessity) and some garlic chili sauce. I took other reviewers' advice and added the chard stems to the onions (it is a shame to waste them). I also did about two cups of red lentils and added a little extra water. It took about 15 to 20 minutes to cook once I put in the lentils, and they were still had a bit of a bite to them (in a good way). I used all garam masala and a little cayenne for the spice. I think next time I will add even more chard. Also, this definitely tastes even better the next day.

Rating: 4
Delicious soup! I did make some changes: used half chicken broth and half vegetable broth, used 1 cup lentils du puy, and added about a teaspoon of ground ginger. I sauteed the chopped up stems with the onion, and a couple cloves of garlic, and cooked the lentils for 40 min before adding the chard. A dash of lemon and some Greek/Indian yogurt at the end tops it wonderfully.

Rating: 3
Wonderful wonderful. Doubled the recipe and made just as is written, the first time. Topped with yoghurt and peanuts. Yum. The second time I made this I tripled the recipe, upped the spices, and substituted some of the broth with coconut milk. This time I froze the results and took it camping. Worked out great. This is a wonderful recipe for alteration, it is a good jumping off recipe.

The yogurt does finish it off well. I found the basic recipe, with the recommended 1 cup plus amount of lentils needed a little coriander, cumin, etc. But what also helped was lemon, as others have mentioned. Will make this a staple.

This was a great recipe - especially for those who don't know how to cook swiss chard! I added carrots and the chopped chard stems to the onions after a few minutes. I used chicken broth + some homemade chicken stock as it was what I had on hand and close to a pound (about 1 3/4 cup) of the red lentils. Cooked a little over 10 minutes with lentils added as I like them more well cooked, although my garbanzos which I had already cooked thoroughly (from dried) were a bit overdone. Will definitely add to our regular menu rotation!

After reading some reviews, I made the following modifications: Added garlic and diced carrot. Cooked the stems of the chard along with the onions. Added 2 cups of additional broth. Added the leafy bits of the chard in the last 5 min. of cooking. Loved how it turned out. Definitely will make again.

Rating: 4
fab everyday wholesome recipe. i did a few things different though ;). i added the leafy bits of the chard at the last 10 minutes and steamed them and combined. used the acceptable parts of the stalks and chopped them and added to the spice mixture. for curry i put powdered coriander, cumin, tumeric and fennel in reducing order (by quantity) and added some chilli flakes (not cayenne powder). also added fresh minced garlic. for broth i used shitake broth cos I am a vegetarian and this broth is so healthy and i buy it at the Dufferin Grove farmers market. also re lentils taking long to cook - i think if the broth is cold and no salt is added till lentils are cooked - that is the trick to cook it sooner (we never add salt until the lentil is cooked and also we don't add lentils to hot water so make sure the broth is cold when you add it). and before i started prepping the veggies i roasted about three cups of broccoli florets tossed in a bit of olive oil and s&p in a 400 oven for twenty minutes till edges browned and added them just before serving. i cut up some lime to add at the table but forgot to add it cos the soup needed nothing more. i am now sooo full - and had it with some bread and a glass of red malbec. life is good. i feel so happy! such basic good food. what life is all about. no? peace!

As another reviewer said, a great springboard recipe. The tweaks are endless! This time, I added carrot and celery to the onion, since I had them around, some extra cumin and coriander as I was short curry powder, and only 1 cup of lentils (which, as many people have pointed out, didn't completely cook in 10 minutes). I can't wait to eat this again for lunch tomorrow!

We loved this! Very tasty and fit right in with our vow to do at least one meatless dinner a week (although I did use chicken broth...does that still count as meatless?). Anyway, I followed a lot of reviewers' advice and added a diced carrot, a couple of minced garlic cloves and only about a cup or so of lentils. I sauteed the chard stocks with the onion and carrots and didn't add the leaves until the last couple of minutes. I also used green lentils and it did add to the cooking time but I didn't mind. I thought I would need to add more stock at the end as many suggested but the consistency turned out perfectly -- more like a light stew -- not too soupy and not too thick. We will definitely add this to the rotation!

An excellent basic recipe and a great, quick, very healthy dinner! We enjoyed adding carrots, as other reviewers suggested, and substituted spinach and parsley for the chard. We also adding a half lemon's juice right at the end, and a jalapeno instead of cayenne. Spicy and absolutely delish.

This stew turned out excellent with a few modifications. I added a can of coconut milk, a carrot, kale instead of chard and lots more water. Garnished it with cilantro, hard-boiled egg, and fresh lemon juice instead of yogurt. I highly recommend trying it with lemon  it brightens up the flavors and makes the soup dairy-free. Made fresh dosai (south Indian lentil pancakes) to eat on the side. Perfect.

Yum. I added one small diced potato and used only one cup of red lentils and a small bunch of chard. I also added a tablespoon of curry paste to the onions and a tablespoon or so of sweet chili sauce for a little sweetness at the end. Cook until just tender.

What a treat! I followed the recipe, adding half of the chopped swiss chard stalks to onions as others have done (I figured they were too boring a flavour to add all of them), and the chopped leaves just 5 minutes before serving so they would retain their texture and colour. I also added 3 or 4 cloves of garlic and 3 shallots to counterbalance the neutrality of the chard stalks. And I made my own curry powder which made all the difference i think! (roasted and then ground cumin, bird eye chili peppers and coriander, ground cardamon seeds, some turmeric and a touch of ground cloves). The liquid was part chicken broth, water and chickpea cooking water. Delicious, and very fast cooking! (And yes, clearly using red lentils - not brown or green - is essential here for cooking times, flavour, and quantity of liquid indicated in the recipe).

I followed the recipe other than adding some chopped carrot with the onion and adding two more cups of stock. A quick and delicious recipe. Will definitely make again.

Made this with a neutral tasting oil (peanut or canola); don't like curry flavor and olive oil combo! This is like "dal" and could use cilantro as a garnish. I used chard stems chopped sauted with the onion. Cooks should try health food or Indian shops for red lentils, which cook in just minutes.

Rating: 4
i took others' advice and used a lot less lentil. i only used a cup, so it would be more of a soup than a stew. it is still quite hearty. wow, it is really delicious. i think part of it might have to do with my special indian curry powder. i think i will have some more now!

We absolutely loved this recipe. It is perfect for Fall and really easy to make. We used brown lentils because that's what we had laying around. We also used greek yogurt, which was amazing on top. The only suggestions I have are that the lentils took longer to cook that the 10 mins they recommend - could be b/c we didn't use red lentils, but I am not sure. In any case, we cooked the lentils for about 20 mins instead of 10 and they were perfect but the chard lost a lot of it's color and got a little soggy. I would recommend adding the chard a little later so it stays bright and beautiful in the stew.

Turned out better than I expected and did fill the house with a nice aroma! I followed the advice of a few other cooks and sauteed the chopped stalks of the chard with the onions, threw in some carrots, and ended up adding about 2 cups more of liquid (half was more veg broth, half was water). It turned out really great, though!

I thought this recipe would be good, but I didn't realize how amazing it would be! I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, since that's all I had, and added a little extra water at the end.

Yummy & tummy-warming. Like other reviewers, halved the lentils, almost doubled the broth + a little water. No kale or chard, so used (! I know there are purists out there who freak when one changes a recipe then reviews it!) last of the turnip greens from my garden, also cut up a little of the turnip and threw that in. Added smidge of garam masala and ground coriander with plain curry powder. Good idea to briefly toast the spices in a dry pan before using, ups the richness it seems. Used crema mexicana instead of yogurt since it needed to be used up. May try it next time with a little coconut milk.

I made this as written, except for using half the lentils and no greens. My red lentils cooked very fast and ended up quite mushy. I also used a madras curry, which I found had too much of a cinnamon note to it. I would make again with a different curry. Simple to whip up and tasty; the yogurt is a must.

This is a favorite for me, great right away and even better after freezing, but I do a number of modifications: - sometimes use green or brown lentils, increases cooking time. - add way more veg stock, 3 of those 24 oz boxes of it. - double or triple the amount of greens (chard, or a combo of chard and kale so far). - add celery and carrot, and sometimes more onion. - increase the reg curry powder to about 6-7 tsps, the cayenne to 1/2, and at least 1/2 tsp garam masala. - Optional great add-ins: sweet potato (2/3 steamed, then chopped) and raw cashews (added with greens), apple-flavored chicken sausage (added 10 min before done cooking)

Very tasty, and creates a lovely curry aroma in the kitchen while the spices cook with the onion. I added three carrots, doubled the cayenne and added cumin. Used brown lentils (I can never find red lentils at the store) and reduced it to a generous one cup. Used the same amount of broth and it still came out very thick - I imagine that more liquid would have to be added if the full amount of lentils was used. Served over store-bought polenta. A delicious, healthy and quick dinner.

I loved this soup. Couldn't find any chard at the store(I don't think my bf looked very hard), so I used kale instead. I had red curry paste on hand so I used that instead of powder and I added cumin and turmeric, as well as, upping the cayenne. I no longer need to go out to eat to get good lentil soup.

It took WAY longer than ten minutes to tenderize the lentils, but that may be because red lentils are nowhere to be found in this area so I made do with brown. Otherwise - YUM. I added some ground ginger and used hot madras curry. Also about a teaspoon of salt at the end upped all the flavors.

My family really liked this stew. I cut back the lentils to about a cup, and only had chicken bouillon cubes on hand. I added the chopped chard leaves after the soup had reached a boil, but put in the chopped stalks as directed. I also added two chopped carrots with the onion. My toddler ate a small bowl, and husband loved it. Simple, delicious, and so very good for you. This is a keeper for me.

Healthy and quick. This soup was great for a winter weekday. I used kale instead of chard. I'm glad I did because I am not sure that chard would have held up as well.

Like other reviews mentioned I did add more broth and was happy with the thick stew-like texture that resulted.

I made this for dinner, and I would agree with the reviewers who suggested adding more broth and less lentils--I did both, reducing lentils by about 1/2 cup and adding one extra can of broth. I served it with the yogurt (Greek yogurt, thick and creamy, was essential!) and cilantro (which my boyfriend loves). We also toasted up some store bought nan. Next time I will probably mix a little Za'tar into the yogurt. A very easy and hearty recipe.

This is a very tasty meal to prepare. Quite easy too, as other reviewers have said. :) I have made this stew twice now and each time I have had an issue with the broth. Most of it is absorbed and my final product ends up looking nothing like the more soupy picture on the site. I would still recommend this recipe though, as the flavors are very tasty and a pretty quick meal for a cold, winter week day. :)

I cooked up some lovely Phipps Ranch garbanzo beans that were so deliciously sweet and nutty on their own, then I ruined them by using them in this recipe. I should have known better as red lentils notoriously turn to mush, turning this stew into an unappetizing glop.

This is one of my go-to meals. Sometimes I use green lentils instead of red ones, depending on availability. I also sometimes add a bit of extra cayenne. Mostly though, I make the recipe as is. As other cooks have noted, this freezes well and tastes really great with a bit of time to sit and meld.

Wow! I was a bit skeptical; this recipe seemed too simple to have a lot of depth of flavor, but it turned out great. I didn't have chard, only kale from my garden, so I let that simmer for about 10 extra minutes before adding the lentils and beans. Following the other reviewers' advice, I added a bit more cayenne and a big pinch of garam masala, a bit of salt, and about double the stock to have a more soupy consistancy. Fantastic! The red variety of lentils do cook really quickly; less than 10 minutes would have probably been enough.

But, I followed the cooking instructions to the letter & it came out great. I'm amazed at how quick & EZ this recipe was! It's a keeper!

Yum! My first taste was not that wonderful, so I added a large pinch of graham marsala and decided to freeze it instead of having it for dinner. Best decision I could make. It's a wonderful dish after it has had a chance to sit and let the flavors meld. Brought it to work and got rave reviews.

This recipe was so good & easy that I was compelled to write my first epicurious review about it. I halved the recipe, but kept the chickpeas the same and used the entire box of chicken broth i had on hand (4 cups). I also added 2 cloves of garlic in the beginning, but 1 would have been fine. I think alot of the bad turnouts are the result of using the wrong type of lentil. Red lentils cook more quickly than some other types and give the stew the color it has in the picture. I can't wait to try it with a good vegatable stock to serve to my vegetarian friends!

I loved this recipe! So easy and full of flavor. I halved the recipe as I was only making it for two, but I still put in a full can of garbanzos and I'm glad I did because there would have been too few otherwise! I cooked the lentils for about 15 mintues total, I liked them slightly firm, I don't think they're meant to get mushy. I also added garlic in the beginning. Delicious, can't wait to make again!

Forgot to add that the stew freezes really, really well (without the yogurt, of course).

I thought this recipe was fantastic! I did end up adding 1-2 cups more stock to get it to my desired conistency, and I doubled the amount of cayenne (I like it spicy!). No problem at all with the lentils being thoroughly cooked, and the stew looked exactly like the picture- very pretty and colorful.

We found this rather bland and boring. It did require twice as much cooking time to get the lentils soft and therefore twice as much stock/water. Good for vegan guests, I suppose, but even then I'd look for something more flavorful/impressive.

Delicious! I used homemade chicken stock instead of vegetable stock, and I also added 2 fillets of tilapia cut into bite-size pieces. I'll probably up the cayenne because it wasn't spicy enough. This is a winner and will go into our weeknight dinner rotation! Just a note: this is not a *soup*, but a *stew*. No wonder some people were adding extra stock to theirs. It's supposed to be thick!

Delicious! I used green lentils (the store was out of red lentils), spinach and chicken stock. I will make this again soon. It was wonderful, especially with the topping of yogurt, and fast and easy to make. Highly recommended.

Contrary to what the other reviews said, I think that if you make this soup according to the recipe it tastes horrible. The lentils will still be uncooked after 10 minutes and the taste will be very shallow. I had to add some water, more curry, more cayenne, a lot of salt and pepper and then throw it in the crock pot for a few hours before it became a lovely and creamy curry lentil stew. Follow these directions and I'm sure you'll be happy with the end result!

I have a new found love and appreciaton for curry lately. I agree with some previous reviewers about adding salt and pepper to round out the flavors. I made a few little substitutions: I used a hot curry powder (I love heat), I substituted collard greens for the swiss chard, and used home made organic chicken stock I had on hand instead of the vegetable stock. Will try it with swiss chard in the future. I am not a big garbanzo fan so next time I will substitute more lentils. This was a nice recipe for an easy, quick, hearty, healthy meal. I will make this one again.

This is an easy-to-make winter dish that tastes delicious! After adding the swiss chard, the soup was looking too thick so I added an additional eight cups of stock before adding the lentils. I substituted brown lentils for red and cooked the soup an additional ten minutes. It worked out well. A dash of salt and some fresh pepper round out this meal.

I had a soup party & made three soups. This was by far the favorite. The only thing was I needed to add more stock (I'd doubled the recipe & may have added more lentils than called for - hard to say) to give it more of a soup/stew consistency than a side dish consitency.

Very good and easy. I used baby spinach as I couldn't find any Swiss chard. Definitely don't omit the yoghurt, it is key to balance the heat.

This was a delicious dish and very helpful for my low-carb diet. My local market did not have swiss chard, so I substitued with collard greens. Also, I had homemade low-fat chicken stock on hand and used that instead. It was delicious and very filling. A winner!

i made this recipe as written and found it to be so-so. it's definitely easy, but i found the taste to be rather average. i've had other lentil soups that take a little longer but taste better. also, not sure if the other reviewers found this to be true, but my version of the soup does NOT look like the picture...it is very dull and brown. i'm glad i'm not serving it to any guests!

Great, simple recipe, perfect for a weeknight meal. I made the recipe pretty much as written, except that I used water instead of vegetable stock and I boiled the crap out of it because I wasn't paying attention. (I wouldn't recommend that.) Do be sure to serve with yogurt. The soup is quite spicy, and the yogurt helps to mellow the heat. Plus, the sourness of the yogurt rounds out the flavors of the dish.

I made this recipe, and by mistake put in far too much cayenne pepper. My husband suggested adding coconut milk to tame it down, which I did. I also added garam masala to add a little depth to the spices. And because the grocery was out of chard, I used spinach and added it later. It came out wonderful and we really enjoyed it!
