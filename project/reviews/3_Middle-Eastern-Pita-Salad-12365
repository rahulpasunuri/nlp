I used this as a nice light salad to go with a Middle Eastern theme shish kebob barbeque and I thought the flavours were very authentic. Being of Armenian descent this salad reminded me of the flavours of my grandmothers salads (lemon,mint,onion, parsley and dried mint). My grandmother always used dried not fresh mint and I think the flavour is much more subtle without being overpowering.

Traditional fattoush salads that I have enjoyed use sliced red onion, instead of scallions, and usually sumac in addition to the mint. Also, the Romaine played a more central role, rather than garnish. I suggest playing around with the dressing (more lemon, some S&P, less oil, etc) to add flavor. This is an excellent side dish!

DOH! I meant to tell you to add sumac.

The only thing I would change about this recipe is the amount of oil -- at times I could taste the oil more than anything else and ended up having to remove some of the dressing from the bowl.

This salad is good, particulary becuase of its uniqueness. I didn't have fresh mint and had to use dried. I'm sure it would be better with the fresh. Adding prawns/shrimp might add complexity for those who want more substance. I would definitely add crumbled feta next time. A little weak and uninteresting as is.

This dish was delicious, but I found it too salad-y (not enough protein) to be a main dish by itself. On the other hand, adding hummus on the side would easily fix that issue.

A delicious salad with refreshingly different tastes! I served this with falafel and a cucumber-yogurt sauce and it was a big success. I will definitely make this again and won't change a thing.

Made this salad and it was delicious. It will be on my permanent make list.

In Arabic, this salad is called "Fattoush". It can also be made with seasoned pita. The pita is split, brushed with olive oil, and sprinkled with an herb mixture called "zattar". Then it is toasted. The zattar adds a fantastic flavor to the salad.
