This was very tasty. Not too salty at all. I used a 14oz. can of diced tomatoes not 24 and had more than enough. I also added a T of olive tapanade to it. I would definitely make it again.

This was very good and easy to make. The directions only use 3 oz. of the tomatoes and 1/2 tsp of the basil - What do you do with the rest? Must be a typo...

This is a quite tastey recipe for swordfish with a Mediterannean style sauce. It's easy to make and has a nice flavor. I grilled my swordfish I do find the recipe for 10 servings rather bizarre. I used 2 garlic cloves, 2 salt cured anchovies, and a 14.5 ounce can of diced tomatoes. That made enough sauce for 3 6 ounce steaks and enough leftover for perhaps 3 more. It's easy enough to adjust the garlic and anchovy to your own taste. As another reviewer suggested, adding olives or perhaps capers would also be a good choice.

It is a typical swordfish recipe. Cook the fish, make it edible with a sauce. The sauce is very tasty; however, the recipe says use only a few teaspoons of the sauce. I think it is in error, maybe this is for each serving...anyway, I loved the sauce. Have also added green olives to it and it makes it even more mediterranean in style.
