I revised this childhood fav ( I grew up in santa clara valley in the 60's ) by cooking a passover version: spring onions, kosher ground beef, added cayenne sauce to the eggs, very little parmesan( only 1/4 c.) and used red russian steamed kale instead of spinach. delish and kale is chewy unlike spinach. and very healthy. great texture. spring onions leftover from passover ritual of Persian tradition of gentle whips with spring onions to recreate whips imposed on slaves in egypt. good re-use.

Great recipe to use when you're short on both meat and eggs! Kids said it tasted like quiche and the adult men had their brunch hunger satisfied. Only added red pepper for color, then garlic and bouillon for flavor. No one used the Worchestire (would only recommend if actually eating for dinner as mentioned in the recipe introduction). Vegans: this can also be transformed into a colorful breakfast/brunch meal (as long as you know how to make "scrambled tofu"). I ate a vegan version and loved it too!

Thanks to lrs10463 and the Washington Square Bar and Grill. Their additions really raise the level of the dish.

I had this often when I lived in North Beach years ago (at the late great Washington Square Bar and Grille). The cook there put in lots of basil and garlic, as well as lots of grated parmesan right after the meat was browned and seasoned. He also threw in a handfull of pine nuts for crunch when he was browning the onions and sweating the mushrooms. He also seasoned it with some worchestershire sauce, which he claimed was the only way it could be authentic. He advocated that this dish be eaten before bed after a night of drinking, and no hangover the next morning! Now if that's not authentic SF, I don't know what is!

My husband and I had our first date at Joe's in San Jose, CA (we were students at San Jose State at the time) in 1971. This Sunday he requested "Joe's Special" for the family brunch we are having for his 60th birthday. We serve it at our lake cabin whenever we need a hearty start to the day, and use a combination of Italian sausage and ground beef and fresh garden spinach...when we have it! I agree: don't overpower this succulent dish with the meat!

I'm another whose Mom made this and we loved it. It's the kind of food that keeps you from knowing you're poor. Mom called it "New Joe's Special" adding a little grated cheddar to it. The recipe makes more than my family can eat, so here's a hint for leftovers (from the time I made a double batch): great filling for empanadas. I used up some leftover white sauce and a bit of sour cream to get the texture right, and everyone really liked them.

I cheated. Gave 4 stars & said I would make again, but just wanted to share my version with you all. Have eaten Joe's Special at Original Joe's many times over the years & it's my favorite. Mine is the same, but less rich with olive oil. I must emphasize that this is Comfort Food. It is lunch or dinner, really not breakfast. Also, eating a plate of this made with sausage instead of good ground beef is a whole different animal. Made it last night & make this a few times a year using this recipe from a 1950 SF cookbook. This is New Joe's version. Saute 1/3 cup finely chopped onions in 1 TBSP butter & 2 TBSP olive oil. Add 1/3 lb ground beef(I use butcher ground sirloin). When almost finished, add 1/2 cup cooked, chopped, dry spinach. When the spinach is heated through, add 2 beaten eggs & scramble. Season with salt & pepper. I do admit to adding about 1 cup of sauted sliced mushrooms before the eggs & top with grated parmesan (Original Joe's offers that, too). Last night I doubled the recipe & served 3 with salad & good sourdough. It is divine. If you come to SF, go to Original Joe's. You will never be dissapointed! Truly a step back in time.

I use extra lean ground turkey, and olive oil spray, and cook the meat just done, first and set aside. Using spray and olive oil, just enough, saute onions and sliced mushrooms, sprinkling a little nutmeg on the mushrooms as you cook til the juices are dried up. I usually put the seasonings in here, and stir them in, often using a touch of oregano and or herbes de provence. Turn cooked meat back into the pan, stir to distribute spices, and top with spinach, I chop it out of a pre washed and dried bag of baby spinach. Cover til it wilts, stir in, as above, add eggs and there you have it. You can make it ahead up to the eggs and then add the eggs when you reheat it, great for a high protein breakfast or fast dinner, if the mix is stitting covered in the fridge.

This was a great dish! I substitued Italian sausage and added mushrooms. Very good.

I'm amazed to find this recipe. For such a long time I thought that it was one of those dishes that my mother made up. We ate this it when time was tight and Mom was at her wits end. Which was often. All the kids loved it, all four of us. I haven't had it since I was a teenager (that's been quite a while) but I remember it fondly and will try my teenage son and husband on it this week. Thank you epicurious, you've done it again!

When I've ordered Joe's Special in restaurants, I'm usually disappointed because the beef is not seasoned enough. So I took the advice of previous reviewers and used sausage. Delicious! Next time though I would reduce the amount of salt in the egg mixture and add some later if necessary. Also, I doubled the recipe and by the time the eggs fully cooked, the spinach was very limp. Next time I might try steaming the spinach separately, just til lim, and adding it to the mixture towards the end? Just a though.

I did not make this version, but make a much simpler one myself. Saute some garlic and onions, cook up some gound Italian sausage, add the eggs (about six or seven) and the spinach. Cook until the eggs are set. Divy it up onto plates, and top with grated parmesan cheese. If you live in Seattle, go try this at Lowell's in Pike Place market. Their version is excellent!

Added fresh sliced mushrooms, Italian seasoning, and topped with fresh grated Parmesan. A great lite supper. Note: be sure the spinach is dry.

A wonderful breakfast, fast and easy. Must be made with hot Italian sausage not ground beef. Brown it in advance, not with the onions and pour off the oil. Squeeze with a paper towel to get the last of the grease out. We put in some jalapeno peppers and one habanaro. Yummy.

Great. However, on one early occasion I forgot the ground beef and had to use Italian sausage, hot. Never went back to beef.

As a San Francisco native, this has been part of my diet for years! It's great with grated cheddar cheese and sauteed mushrooms added. And it makes fabulous leftovers (if there's anything left!!)

I liked the idea but the ratios were off to me. Mainly too much ground beef and not enough egg. I left out the beef in a portion for a person in our group that doesn't eat beef and I was envious of her serving. The onions and spinach had a good flavor alone and I thought the beef overpowered all of it. I couldn't even tell at the end that it was an egg dish. I guess I had other expectations. Maybe this is what Joe's Special is like.

There is the original Original Joe's! It's been open in the heart of San Francisco for 65 years and is the source of this recipe. Joe and Tony opened this restaurant without a thought of patenting the name, menu, or logo- much less the recipe! (Obviously a big mistake.) But at 89 years of age, Tony still shows up to work every morning. You can ask him about the source of this recipe yourself!

There is, in fact, a savoy variety of spinach. This web link will take you to information on the variety, if you're interested. http://www.territorial-seed.com/testcat/vegetables/spinach/SP776.html

Spinach doesn't come in a crinkly "savoy" variety! That's savoy cabbage, not spinach.
