EUREKA! I WAS LOOKING FOR AN OMELETTE TO MAKE THAT INCLUDED DARK GREENS. HOWEVER, MY ORGANIC KALE HAD GONE BAD SO I SUBSTITUTED ARUGULA, COOKING IT ONLY 5 MINUTES WITH THE ONION; I USED MANCHEGO CHEESE WITH DRIED BASIL AND THYME. OTHER THAN THAT(;-)),EVERYTHING ELSE WAS AS SPECIFIED. IT WAS STILL VERY GOOD. WHEN I HAVE ACCESS TO CHARD, I PLAN TO TRY IT AS WRITTEN.

Straight forward and tasty. I think I will be adding this to the dinner rotation.

Wonderful! Three and half forks. I used our own garden chard and eggs from our darling free-range chickens. Served with garden tomato salad. Lovely August dinner.

To those who were concerned about time - I did not have swiss chard and completed the entire recipe as-is without it. Though it may not have had the earthy, slightly darker taste that chard would have given it, I absolutely loved the taste and the blend of spices (I did, however, use dried basil and parsley flakes, not having freshly chopped versions of those on hand) was amazing. It also shaves off 15 minutes of the recipe...a pretty good hand off, I would say.

This had such a nice flavor that my husband remarked several times after the fact that he really liked it. That says a lot since he doesn't usually pay attention to his food. I rushed the cooking somewhat and the omelet turned out dry. It also stuck to the pan. Next time I'll have to have more patience with it.

I made this recipe almost exactly as written, the only differences were that I used extra garlic, and subbed tarragon for basil, because I didn't have any basil. It is the perfect bruch recipe!

This was an excellent recipe, although it is a bit of a hassle to make. I made a beet salad the night before so I used all of chards leftover. I didn't have gruyere or basil, so i used pesto instead. I also added in some diced veggie patties. It turned out wonderfully. I'd definitely make this again......when I have an hour to cook eggs.
