These cookies are DELICIOUS! I served these to guests of my dinner club last night. Everyone loved them. The men could not stop eating them. My husband commented that they were :like a sweet, yet lemony confection that just melted" in his mouth. I doubled the recipe and added one extra Tablespoon each of lemon juice and lemon zest. I followed the advice of a previous reviewer and dropped scoops of dough onto parchment paper without chilling the dough as I was short on time. The cookies rose beautifully, and cooked perfectly. Iced with a confectoiners sugar and lemon juice combo was PERFCT!

This is a great recipe, but like most lemon recipes the sugar needs to be decreased and more lemon added. I used 3/4 cup granulated sugar in the basic butter recipe and my egg was at room temperature. When I added the vanilla extract and egg I also added the zest from 2 medium lemons, approximately 2 tablespoons, and the juice from 1 1/2 of the same lemons,approximately 3 tablespoons, and 1 1/2 teaspoons of lemon extract. I added the flour one heaping tablespoon at a time in my heavy duty KitchenAid mixer. I did not chill the cookie dough and dropped them on parchment lined cookie sheets using a 1 1/2 inch diameter bladed scoop. There was no need to press them down. I baked them on convection bake for 8 minutes, finding even on convection they need to be rotated at 4 minutes, and let them rest on the tray for 2 minutes before transfering them to cooling racks. I refrigerated the dough between batches. The yield was 74 perfect 2 inch diameter cookies with a rich lemon flavor. They must cool fully before serving because they are exceptionally flaky when warm. Great easy recipe.

Very tasty lemon cookie, though a very sticky dough. I divided the chilled raw dough in 4 sections and placed it between two sheets of lightly floured parchment paper. Working with the sections, I then rolled each section into four inch wide, 1/4 - 1/8 inch thick strips. Chilled the sections until firm and then cut into 2 x 2 inch squares. Placed on baking sheets and voila. Mixed heavy cream, lemon juice and powdered sugar for a drizzle topping.

I made so many changes it was it's own recipe... Added salted butter, but omitted the salt. Added brown instead of regular granulated sugar Had no baking powder, so I put baking soda. Added 3 tbsp of lemon juice and a about 1 1/2 tbsp of lime zest and a bit of its juice. Cookies came out great! Light lemon flavor. Not crumbly, but a nice consistency. However, they are still not lemony enough for me.

These were ssimple and great. I made them as part of a cookie tray for a lunch for 35 and they all dissapeared. Not crumbly at all. Added extra zest but not extra juice- wouldn't that affect the concictency? I drizzled with chocolate once as shown, but second time I made an icing from powdered sugar and lemon juice and zig-zagged ( as shown for chocolate ooption). They looked gorgeous and it was nice to offer a non choc cookie!

Although I did love the lemon part of the recipe, the butter cookie itself was dry and not terribly flavorful. A butter cookie recipe from 1995 that had a lot of cooks raving is much better - rich and tender. If you use it, the various adaptations turn out much better.

I have now made the Basic Butter, the Almond Spice, the Chocolate and the Lemon. (All from Dec. 2003 Gourmet.) The lemon have turned out really nicely, as have all the others. I've made only one change to all the recipes and that is that I've used superfine (caster) sugar instead of granulated. I find it improves the texture considerably. (1 C Granulated = 1 C Superfine)

Besides the plain butter cookies, this is the easiet recipe to make. The log was fine but I ended up slicing the pieces in half (about quarter sized) and that worked out best. 2 inch diameter cookies would have been HUGE. The cookies are very nice and tart. A little extra lemon juice makes them extra tart. Also, make sure to watch them in the oven as a couple minutes on either side can make or break this recipe.
