This dish did not turn out very well. The skins on the beets were not easy to remove. I have found a better recipe on Epi for beets with carrots, but alas, it seems to have been removed. Not worth making again.

This was good but was calling for additions. I used it on a spinach salad with goat cheese and walnuts and it was very nice but i think the vinegar might be a little much if served on its own. I boiled the beets.

I only had about 5 small beets, so I sliced and added 3/4 of a big sweet onion and two small diced apples. I started the beets and onions - took about 45 minutes before the beets were tender. I added the apples and baked another 15 minutes. It was really good hot, even better cold the next day, and I used the last little bit on a turkey sandwich. I think it would really be good in a turkey and cheese wrap - will try that next time.

These are good. The recipe is easy but beets, as always take a long time to cook. I boiled them instead of roasting. Nice flavor.

Easy to make and yummy. It was even better the next day.

I find this amusing they list this in their "Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur Guide" and list it as pairing with fried chicken or pork...ha! Sounds like a good recipe though, will give it a try.
