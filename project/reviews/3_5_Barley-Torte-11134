We eat this a lot, often as a main dish...even the kids eat it. Usually use 2 whole eggs, and whatever cheese is around, and it is always good.

A nice carb/starch change from the usual rice and potatoes. Nothing special, as indicated from the simple ingredients. Prepared in two parts (cooked barley one night, baked it the second).

A little time consuming to prepare. I thought it was delicious. The rest of the family didn't think so. I doubt if I will make it again.

A winner - guaranteed no leftovers on this one.
