While the proportion of oil to vinegar in the dressing seemed too high, the combination of flavors of the sherry vinegar, shallots, and rosemary with the toasted hazelnuts and lettuces was quite good. The rolls, however, were disappointing. Little texture or interest. The lemon overpowered the flavor of the goat cheese entirely. Think I'll try the modified dressing with warm goat cheese rounds coated in hazelnuts... probably much more pleasing.

I made these as an appitizer & used both procutto & capicolla for the meat-& served them in a raddicio leaf w/ the dressing & hazel nuts sprinkled on top-Very well recieved-a keeper for those of us who like "funny food" !!!

Classically sliced Prosciutto was a bit delicate, requiring multiple layers to roll and slice with spinach/goat cheese. A thicker slice or different ham may be better. I made a classic vinegrette with shallots and herbs with this. Added oil cured olives and suggared nuts :)

Made this salad for Christmas dinner. Dressing was a bit light - added another tablespoon of vinegar for a bit more zing. Guests from France loved the freshly cracked and toasted hazelnuts - worth the extra effort!

The salad dressing was well, nasty. We threw it out and made a simple vinaigrette. The little rolls were tasty and easy to make; they were good also as appetizers.

Made this salad with the Herb Beef Tenderloin from, truffle scallop potatoes and cranberry granita from the same edition. It was wonderful. The hazelnut was a great complement to the serrano/goat cheese combination.

I made this last night for our annual roast beef Christmas dinner. The roast was a little slow, so I served thed cut up rolls as appetizers. They are delicious. I ended up rolling them from the narrow end, and they came out a nice size. The dressing is also very good, especially with the toasted filberts.
