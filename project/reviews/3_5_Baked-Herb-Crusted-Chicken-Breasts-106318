2/4/2013 I used a whole chicken; only deboning the breasts. I did flatten the breasts. Chicken marinaded for 30 minutes. When using a whole chicken, I must bake the boned pieces longer. Family loved it!

delicious! Chicken was moist and perfectly lemony. Fresh herbs made the meal! Do not substitute with dried. I left out the rosemary (not a fan) and stuck with parsley and basil.

Easy weeknight chicken. Crowd pleaser - both of my young kids gobbled it up and my husband liked it as well. Good basic baked chicken recipe. I browned it under the broiler for about 3 minutes before serving.

I just made this tonight. Everyone loved it, the only difference was that instead of marinating in lemon juice, i brushed them chicken with seasoned butter and then coated them in egg so the bread would stick better.

This wass simple and wonderful tasting. I was cooking for just me so I didn't want to fuss and wanted something I could just "throw in the oven". I served it with roasted broccoli and orzo. It was perfect.

Easy and delicious, would totally make again. Served roasted winter veg. with it, very convenient to put them in the oven 10 minutes before the chicken.

Not sure what I'm missing here but I did not think this was very good. I made it per the recipe with the exception of using panko instead of bread crumbs. Perhaps that made the difference but i am not sure it was good enough to try again. The herb combination didn't work for me and it was soggy on the bottom when it came out of the oven. I usually rely successfully on the reviews here, but this time it didn't work...

I used skinless, boneless chicken thighs. I cooked for about 30 minutes. This was great!! Next time I will try with the egg wash as I believe the oil caused the breadcrumbs to burn before the chicken was cooked inside. Perhaps the egg wash will even this out. But the flavor is there and wonderful. I served it with baked veggies. Light and fresh.

Absolutely a new favorite. Easy, tasty and delicious. I didn't have fresh rosemary but I did have Thyme and it was wonderful. Can't wait to make it with rosemary! My husband's taste buds are gone and he even said it was great flavor! Will definitely be making this again and again. Great change from using the Foreman!

Simple, easy and delicious! I go heavy on the lemon and let it marinate for a good long while, as the lemon flavor is really what makes this dish. Usually needs a little less heat and a little more time to cook.

This is my new go to recipe for a light week night chicken dinner! My boyfriend and I made this exactly as written and enjoyed it very much with some fresh seasonal veggies. I agree the panko doesn't get crunchy on the bottom. ( You could pan cook your chicken in oil for a crunchy crunch!)yum!

This was a really good and easy recipe. The fresh herbs really made it nice. I used an egg wash instead of the butter and olive oil to cut down on the fat, the only thing was the bread crumbs weren't crispy. I also added the chopped tomatos after reading a couple of the other reviews. It was all good :)

This is a delicious recipe. The second time I prepared it I used an egg wash before coating instead of the oil wash. It was much more moist and the taste of the herbs and lemon were heightened.

Rating: 1
Other than dividing the recipe to make only 2 servings, I followed it exactly. The texture turned out well, as the chicken was moist and breadcrumbs were crispy. The flavor, however, was missing something. I tasted the lemon and a hint of flavor of the herbs, but cant quite put my finger on why the chicken seemed so bland. I am a bit disappointed and almost feel as though it was a waste of my fresh herbs. If I eventually decide to make this recipe again, I will definitely make alterations to add flavor.

Rating: 1
Not great, breading got too burnt on top, too mushy and all stuck to pan on bottom. Definitely bake on parchment so it doesn't stick. Not bad flavor, but texture was too mushy and blah for me.

Rating: 3
3.5 forks is about right for this dish. I used a combination of some fresh herbs and some dried. I also took one reviewer's suggestion and baked some tomatoes in the breadcrumb mixture to accompany the chicken - good idea!

Rating: 4
This is very good. I did use a bit less salt and lemon, though. I also used thin cut chicken breasts, so there was no need to pound. Excellent!

Rating: 3
I'd rate this 3 1/2 forks if I could. It was so good, and the lemon juice really lights up the flavor. Do use fresh herbs - I don't think it would work well with dried. I turned down the over from 450 to 425 at about the 15 minute point, as the crumbs were browning too fast. It took about 10 more minutes to finish. Don't put the pan higher than the middle of the oven.

I use this recipe all the time. I don't even do the lemon juice marinade, because my kid didn't like it. I use lots of fresh herbs from my garden and it's easy.

I've just started cooking and pulled this one off easily...had friends over for a pre-Thanksgiving casual dinner (which will end up being so much more fun than Thanksgiving)...everyone raved about this...moist, flavorful, similar to fried but so much lighter...and the lemon kept creeping in...yum.

Good flavor, but pretty salty and almost too lemony. Suggest minimal salt on the chicken while cooking, and decreasing lemon juice to 1/4 cup.

Rating: 4
My husband and I loved this, had fresh basil and rosemary in garden and it was a hit! One suggestion, if you have some home grown tomatoes, slice and throw in bread crumb mixture, bake for about 15 mins on bake sheet. Serve them with the chicken and it gives it a a little saucy flavor when combined in a bite with the chicken. Very, very good!

Rating: 4
This is one of the best recipes for boneless skinless chicken breasts I have ever had. Moist and flavorful. I did use dried herbs and left of the rosemmary because I don't like it very much and didn't have. Cut back slightly on the salt But I pounded to about 1/2 to 3/4 as instructed, marinated for about an hour, and otherwise followed the recipe. Mine was done in exactly 20 minutes. Will definitely make this again.

This was awesome! Made it to take to a friends house where we watched the Georgetown\Ohio basketball game. I loved the fact that it was super easy and tasted great! Very healthy as well. Served with roasted aspargus. Will make this again and again.

Whoa! Cut the salt in half! Delicious, but did take longer to cook than 20 minutes (more like 30-35, although to be fair, I did not pound them as thin as the recipe called for). This will be fabulous the second time I make it with about half the 1 1/2 tsp salt in the original recipe and kissed with a bit of ultra-pungent Parmesan Reggiano right before serving. All in all, lemony herby goodness.

I tried this using boneless thighs and it was fantastic - very moist. Beware, however, that they took quite a bit longer to cook than noted in the recipe.

Dad gave me and 2 brothers an ultimatum: Y'all pick the recipes and cook them for your Mother's Day and I'll buy the food. I picked this and it was AMAZING! Didn't have the required amount of breadcrumbs so used what I had on hand. Could have run it under the broiler to really crisp the breadcrumbs up though. Put this with some Hidden Valley Ranch seasoned baby red potatoes and fresh made strawberry shortcakes. That was our Mother's Day menu. First thing out of Mom and Dad's mouths after first bite? "You can make this again!" Both brothers and I agreed. ;) Planning on making this for my boyfriend as a candlelit dinner for 2.

Don't bother pounding the breasts. Just bake as is and they turn out moist and flavorful. I omitted the rosemary and you'll need to cut way back on the salt. Next time I'll just salt the breasts lightly before coating and not add salt to the breading mix. I used Panko and for some reason it didn't crisp up the way I would have like. Will try regular dry breadcrumbs next time. I also baked them on a rack. Lovely lemon flavor comes through nicely. Has a nice fresh taste. Don't need to marinate more than an hour.

Rating: 3
Have made this twice and it's a good basic recipe that can be modified as you see fit. I like to marinate the chicken breasts overnight in a garlic yogurt mixture in order to keep them moist during cooking. Otherwise, chicken breasts can be way too dry, even when pounded thin. You can also vary the herbs. In fact, I don't even follow that portion of it anymore... rather I just throw in whatever I feel like or have on hand. Herbes de Provence, lemon pepper blend, a mixture of my own, something fresh...etc etc. Changes it up a bit. It can be a little plain looking, so a sauce would be nice to dress it up. That's my only complaint. Otherwise, delicous and easy.

This is a great staple for a weeknight dinner. We used panko breadcrumbs to give it more texture, and they were great. The chicken cooked for 20 minutes and then I threw it under the broiler just to really crisp up the outside. The flavors are amazing and this is a keeper for sure.

The chicken breasts I bought were very big, so I cut them in half before I pounded them thin. I brought this chicken dish to a New Year's potluck supper, knowing that the kids would choose it over the other main dish that was going to be spicy. But I'm glad I made extra because the adults kept grabbing pieces too. Embarrassed to share the very easy recipe they keep asking for.

Rating: 4
This is easy, simple, fast, and delicious. Great family meal. Kid-friendly and will please adults as well. Lemon adds great flavor. I would suggest using kosher boneless chicken breasts, since they tend to stay juicier than other types of chicken, or, alternatively, you should try brining the chicken breasts before pounding them thin. Brining reduces the likelihood that these will emerge from the oven dry. Also, you may need a shorter cooking time--when I made this, the chicken was done in 20 minutes.

The lemon juice marinade adds such a zing. People said that this was the best chicken they ever had. Wow!

I made this for guests who like plainer food. It turned out really well - made sure not to overcook so it wasn't dry. For those of us who like stronger flavors, I passed a mustard cream sauce that complimented the delicate herb flavor without overwhelming it.

This is a wonderfully child-friendly recipe that grown-ups like, too. I have a 6-year old daughter that loves to help me cook, and she was able to help pound the chicken, and dredge it in the breadcrumb mixture. We made this for friends that have a child the same age, and we had the most fun "grown up" dinner party with this as the entree. And my daughter got to tell her friend that "she made supper all by herself!"

Rating: 3
I would have to agree with the previous review that this dish was too salty. Also, I wonder whether replacing the butter/oil with an egg wash would accomplish the same thing of getting the bread crumbs mixture to stick without the added calories. I adapted the recipe for my kids using just bread crumbs and shredded parmesan otherwise it would have been rejected for too many green things.

Very easy to make; chicken stayed moist. Although the crust was tasty, we thought it was a too salty. I would make this dish again, but I'd reduce the salt by 1/3.

Chicken breasts aren't my favorite. But my wife is keen on them. So I'm always hunting for a good recipe. This is clearly the best I've found. But I don't like it as much if the breasts are pounded. So I pass on that. And I don't think parsley adds much. So I use fresh mint instead. Very tender and moist and very tasty. The grandchildren love it too.

Rating: 4
Pretty good! I like the taste of the lemon and the herbs together. Next time I will let it marinate for longer as another reviewer suggested, and put it in a ziplock bag instead of a dish for more juice-chicken contact. I used all dried herbs because that's all I had, and I used thyme instead of basil, because that's all I had! I hate breaded chicken breasts, so I didn't use the breadcrumbs, but it was still crispy due to the herbs. It was pretty (not very) moist, despite my strange French oven, which only has two settings: on and off. I also flipped it over halfway through because I was afraid that the bottom would burn. I can't wait to make it again in a good-old fashioned American oven with a thermostat!

I made this and while I agree its not a 'dinner party' type of recipe, it was very easy and my family liked it. Mine didn't turn out dry at all. I think you just have to be sure you don't over cook it - which you have to watch when you flatten meat.

I prepared this recipe for the second time with equal kudos. Even with the comments of being "too dry" in mind, it surpassed expectations. If prepared correctly and even if one had to "tweak" the moisture input, ( all recipes must be formulated to individual cooking styles after all), this recipe turned out to be a winner. I simply do not understand how a discriminating cook, could come away with this recipe being too "dry". Trust me or not, this is an easy and savory treat!

Absolutely delicious. I've made it many times as written and with a few variations. It's great the way it is - have also made it with artichoke hearts, kalamata olives, and sun-dried tomatoes that were packed in oil. You can literally just throw all the ingredients in a baking dish. The lemon flavor is nice. This goes well with Greek stuffed tomatoes. Very easy meal for a week night!

Yes, I really loved these chicken breasts. I used fresh herbs except for the basil, since all I had was dried. Turned out great. I baked them on parchment paper, and they were a little soggy on the bottom but not bad. Another idea, is to bake them on a rack to prevent sogginess. Will definitely make again, a real keeper!

Another way to keep the chicken from sticking to the pan and getting mushy on the bottom is to bake it on parchment paper. I got that hint from another baked chicken recipe on this site. This dish was very tasty although I think I should have baked it 2 to 3 minutes less. It still was moist though. I seem to have pounded the breasts a bit thinner than called for in the directions, and I expect that's the reason. Overall, a very tasty chicken dish.
