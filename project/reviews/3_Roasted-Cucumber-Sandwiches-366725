I was a little apprehensive going in with this recipe thinking that it had potential to be kind of weird (never cooked a cucumber before, for one). What a pleasant surprise it turned out to be though! Very tasty and quick and easy, great for a nice summer lunch or dinner. On top of a nice, lightly toasted crusty bun or baguette.. YUM.

Besides the feta, we added roasted red peppers and tomato. A very nice meal.

Very good. Used plain cucumbers instead of English (or etc.), and turned out nicely. Also added crumbled feta for a heartier sandwich, which gave a lovely tangy note.

Sounds interesting, but how is this an hors d'oeuvre?
