This was very good. Although I rarely do this, I used converted rice and the dish came out fine. Also, following a suggestion by an earlier reviewer, I used about 1/4 cup less chicken broth. That was a good idea! Would make this again. We liked it because it was not as fruity or full of nuts as some fruited rice pilafs. It was just enough for our honey glazed cornish hens which with we served it.

Delicious. I agree with doubling the size. This recipe is enough for two generous helpings or 4 teeny-tiny portions. Of course, I like a lot of rice with my meal. I cut the almonds and the currants. Great as a side dish, but I think adding some steamed shrimp would make a full nice meal. I wish I had some leftover so I could try it cold as it might make a nice rice salad. Recommended.

Nice recipe. But if you want 4 servings though, double the quantities!

This is the Lemon Rice I've been looking for! A perfect accompaniment to fish. Didn't have currents so I chopped golden raisins. This is going into the permanent file.

No it's not a typo - it's a 1/4 CUP of lemon juice. I used jasmine rice, nixed the currants and added a bit of half and half along with lemon zest and paremsan cheese & parsley. Yummmm!

I love this recipe and use it when I want an interesting side dish. Recently served it alongside grilled Tuna Steaks with pineapple salsa. I also follow the recipe and use the measurements as stated - no problem.

really nice. i, too, thought it seemed like a lot of moisture, so cut the water in half, and the texture was perfect. and isn't that a typo in the lemon? -- i.e. 1/4 TSP, not 1/4 CUP of lemon juice. i was out of currants so used raisins. the presentation was less elegant, but the flavor still very nice. i will definitely make again, next time with currants.

Hey, one of the two reviewers below me incorrectly chose "Would not make this dish again" because both gave 4 enthusiastic forks. Anyway, this dish tasted and looked great. Next time, I plan to increase the onions/currants/almonds slightly for even more flavor, and decrease the water slightly so the rice will be less wet.

This is a great fish or chicken accompaniment. The lemon/currant combo gives a really subtle, delicate flavour. A snap to make and "converted" a non-rice person in our family!
