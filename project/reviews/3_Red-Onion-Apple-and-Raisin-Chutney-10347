I made this recipe with dried cranberries instead of raisins and added some chilis for heat. It is absolutely delicious, great on a sandwich or with fish. Also, I canned it and gave it out as gifts for my guests on Thanksgiving.

I served this with a roasted pork tenderloin and enjoyed it very much. It was a hit with the adults but the kids were not adventurous enough to try it.
