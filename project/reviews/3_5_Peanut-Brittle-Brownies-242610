Caution: highly addictive! Combination of p.b. and chocolate cannot be beat and these deliver on the yum! factor. Addition of brittle cranks up the salty/sweet quotient, and a few minutes in the oven remelts the brittle giving the brownies a crackle crust. OMG.

Really easy to make and a hit every time (even though I leave off the peanut brittle). Brought them to work once and they are now the office favorite. Delicious.

No rave reviews for this one. It sat out on our kitchen counter for almost a whole week & we have 7 people in our house with 5 confirmed chocolate-p.b. freaks!

Very easy to make and quite delicious. Decadent twist on a chewy, rich brownie. The crispy peanut brittle topping is excellent.

These are easy and delicious, one of my friends declared them the best treat I had ever baked.
