This was a really good salad. I don't give anything 4 forks unless it's out of this world. I made this for a quick, easy weeknight dinner. I did't have current on hand, but used pomegranite seeds instead (I know... who would have those on hand - LOL) Delicious. Also would be good with craisins. Trader Joe's smoked trout was fantastic in this. Will do again.

I substituted dried cranberries and walnuts - that's what was living in the frig - and this was fab!!!! If you like savory flavors and smoked trout this will be a pleaser.

I guess I'm just not fond of smoked trout. I'll stick to smoked salmon and basil!

Incredibly easy to make and absolutely delicious. I didn't give it 4 forks only because my wife didn't like it very much but our nanny and I thought it was tremendous. You gotta like smokey stuff, though, between the trout and the toasted almonds. I served it with a toasted crust of bread with a strong soft cheese spread on top. The bread makes it more of a meal.

The sweet and salty combination provided a nice contrast and was a welcome change from the typical spinach salad.

This is a weekday standby. If you keep packaged smoked trout and almonds in the freezer, it practically makes itself. Not only is it just delicious (I've made it for many guests), after eating it, I feel so healthy and light!

My husband loves this recipe. The great news is that in addition to being tasty, its relatively healthy--low in fat. With the addition of crusty bread, its a fast, good weekday dinner.

I would make this again because I love smoked trout, but I'd add something to the dressing - I found it to be not enough to complement the strong smokiness. I think something sweet like a honey-mustard dressing would balance the flavors better. As the recipe is now, I wouldn't bother using a superb olive oil because the subtleties will be lost.
