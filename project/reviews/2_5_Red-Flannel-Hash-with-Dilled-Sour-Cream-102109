I found this recipe like a big warm hug on a winter day. Quiet rich earthy flavors. I also did it with out the egg. Truly enjoyed it.

Following the recipe makes for a bland and soggy mixture. I suggest you use Idaho potatoes instead of Yukon Golds and form the mixture into samller patties which can be floured or breaded. Adding some garlic and scallions would help add some badly needed flavor.

We made this recipe with the leftover corned beef from St Patrick's Day. I was a little disappointed, finding it too bland for my taste. I think next time (if there is one) I would use pickled beets instead and maybe increase and saute the onions first for extra flavor. The dilled sour cream made for a pleasant and different accompaniment.

Wonderful flavour. We made it without the egg (my husband hates 'em) and it did not suffer...still hung together. So good we ate it right out of the frying pan!
