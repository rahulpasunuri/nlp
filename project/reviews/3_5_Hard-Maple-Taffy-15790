the directions are so confusing!

I think the problem is the excessive amount of directions in this recipe. Fluctuations in humidity in your kitchen and other factors can change how the taffy turns out. The key for telling when it's done is when a little syrup (about 1/4 t) dropped in a glass of cold water forms a little ball firm to the touch. That's the hard-ball stage. Making sure the taffy is exactly 255 is no substitute for experience and intuition and that old-fashioned test. Also, I like having a party and getting friends to help to pull the taffy, not playing with a dough scraper all alone.

I didn't get taffy either. As it cooled it crystalized. Yes, it was tasty, but it wasn't the taffy I was looking for. Followed directions exactly (down to 0.1 degree!) - where could I have gone wrong?

It didn't make taffy. Instead it made excellent fudge.

it may be a long recipe but after you taste it it is worth it!
