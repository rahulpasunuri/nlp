I didn't rate this recipe because I changed it quite a bit, but it was delicious! I decreased the cream in the ice cream to 2 cups and added an extra cup of whole milk. I also used the juice from 4 lemons (probably about 1/3 of a cup) instead of just 2 tsp. I was glad I made those changes, it wasn't too heavy (but also not too light), and was just lemony enough without being too tart. For the cookies, I was in a hurry to get them finished so didn't let them sit and chill or shape them into logs. Instead I just scooped teaspoons of dough onto the baking sheets and baked them for about 7 minutes. They flattened nicely and were perfect for the sandwiches. Since I wasn't letting them sit for the flavors to really settle in, I added a couple teaspoons of grated fresh ginger. If I were to do it again, I'd add even a bit more fresh ginger, but would probably stick with my abbreviated process. I served these to company on a hot summer evening and they were a big hit with kids and adults alike. I'd definitely recommend giving them a try!

So the ice cream isn't that lemony but the gingersnap cookie dough is the bomb diggity. I managed to save enough to make cookies with, which turned out a little on the soft side. But delicious.

I only made the cookies from this recipe, but they were a real disappointment. I followed the recipe exactly to a T (finicky as it is), and the dough was sticky and produced thin, greasy cookies. I gave 2 forks only because they still tasted pretty delicious--will use the cookies to make some sort of trifle so they don't go to waste.

Lovely combination,perhaps a bit too rich of a lemon ice cream. Note that the person who rated this poorly did not follow the recipe for the cookie that was criticized.

Our foodie friends made this recipe and it was phenomenal. She underbaked the cookies (as directed) to allow chewiness for the ice-cream sandwich construction and incorporated some crystalized ginger for good measure. She made the lemon ice cream from scratch (as directed)... Oh, joy! Ah, summer!

Only made the cookies. I substituted fresh ginger for ground as that was all that I had. Overall, disappointing. Followed the directions and my dough was very wet after chilling for 24 hrs. Cookies had a cake-like texture not crunchy at all.
