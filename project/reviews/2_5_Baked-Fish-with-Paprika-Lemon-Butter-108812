My husband and I really liked the dish, I didn't use any special paprika but did add a clove of garlic and used half the butter. He suggested it would be good on chicken as well. Very flavorful, colorful and easy!

I am iffy on this recipe still, but I think that I liked it, and I know my boyfriend did. I used tilapia which was great and the flavor of the lemon, butter, and paprika really sank in. I added salt and a scattering of bread crumbs.

This recipe was very good and easy, and had a fresh and healthy flavor. Our only changes were that we used ghee instead of butter, and my husband put some lemon slices on top of the fish before baking it. We'll definitely make it again.

This just seemed a little long. I just got a light salt water fish put in foil. Added a little olive oil (and/or butter), chopped parsley, squeeze of lemon, salt & pepper, paprika, and two slices of lemon on the fish. Close the foil loosely and bake on about 400-425 degrees for 10-15 minutes for a thin fish. Very simple and easy. Use a light thin fish.

We had this for dinner one night, and my boyfriend and I agree: Not very good. Not awful, but not very good. It looked, smelled, and tasted like public school cafeteria food (remember that stuff?), and I definitely won't be making it again.

I liked this recipe a lot. I used a halibut steak, just extended the cooking time. I will try with various other fish, I think this recipe lends itself to steaks not fillets. Served with smoothered summer squash from this site and Basmati rice. Poured some of the pan juices over the rice.

I made this recipe with orange roughy fish. It turned out very good. My family said it tasted like a lobster. So this is a keeper. The seasonings were very good with the paprika and cumin. I will make this again in the future.

Maybe the cooks who didn't like this weren't using a good paprika. That can make a difference.

I hate to say it, but this recipe was absolutely awful. We followed it to the letter, but ended up with something that was actually, much to my surprise, inedible. I guess we're not as in love with paprika as the others who said they would make this again.

Too much paprika and parsley

I tried this in my never ending quest to eat more seafood but I didn't think it was very good. IMHO, the paprika was overwhelming, if I do it again, I'd halve the paprika

For a bit of a change use either tequila or white wine instead of lemon juice.

I made this recipe as written, but knew from the start that I had this served to me on my last visit to Mercy Hospital in San Diego, CA. What's not to like. By simply reading it, either you want to make it or you don't. It's what it is, a basic, very simple "fish dinner" If you want to kick it up to higher levels, look deeper into the "Epicurious" recipe vaults. Try a bit of Bearnaise next time!

Well as another reviewer has said this is a basic fish recipe - which so far as I know as been used for years (I am an older person!) so dont find it particularly anything different ! Very simple if you are in a hurry tho ! ----

This is your basic 'Baked Fish' recipe.... don't know how ANYONE could mess this up... it's a standard in my house and everyone loves it!

It's a simple recipe and nice for a quick but good tasting meal. I used lime instead of lemon and "fish and chicken" spice instead of paprika (because I didn't have any paprika)It was quite good

Cook from Washington: what exactly was the problem? This is a basic baked fish recipe. I wouldn't think that it could turn out badly. Assuming that you like the ingredients (e.g. if you don't like halibut with lemon, don't make it), could you be more specific, so that those of us who are thinking about trying this can avoid your problems???

I don't agree with the first reviewer. I think it was a decent weeknight meal, and I would make it again. I followed the recipe exactly as written.

Wow! (and I say that w/ disgust). This recipe is the worst one I have encountered on Epicurious. I reluctantly tried this w/ fresh halibut; and I don't think there is anything you could do to salvage it.
