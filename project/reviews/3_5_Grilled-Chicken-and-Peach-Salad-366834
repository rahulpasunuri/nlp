Great flavors. Be sure to get ripe + sweet peaches. I'll definitely make this again.

Happened to have baby spinach on hand when I made this and it was very tasty. Used dijon instead of grainy mustard which I didn't have. A very big hit with my husband and friends.

I was surprised how well all the flavors worked together. I made it all on my panini grill! Its an extremely easy, healthy and tasty recipe that is perfect for summer!

This was quick, easy and healthy. I will make it again, but as another review commented, I may add a little red onion and parm for added kick.

This is my go-to weeknight recipe when peaches are in season. It's fast, easy, and satisfying. If you don't have arugala use mixed greens and add thinly sliced red onion and some parm shreds for extra kick. You can also lightly pan fry the peaches if you don't have a grill.

I love this recipe, I do make substitutions though, I always use chicken thighs, I think they are more flavorful and definitely more forgiving in the cooking, and I covered the chicken with jerk seasoning.

The dressing was a perfect compliment to the peaches and arugula. Fresh peaches from the farmers market were a hit. We marinated the chicken before grilling so it was nice and moist. Wouldn't change a thing and will definitely make this again. Yum!

I made this last night. It's super easy and very tasty. My chicken was slightly dry, but combined bites with the peaches helped the chicken go down much easier. Next time I'll cut the grilling time down on the chicken. The dressing is delicious and the grilled peaches are amazing!

I forgot to mention that really sweet and flavourful peaches are essential in this dish. We used some regular peaches and a few saturn peaches (aka "doughnut" or "flat" peaches). The regular peaches were phenomenal. The saturn peaches had zero flavour. So much so that we decided not to use them and pitched them.

Really quick, really easy and really good. I was a bit short on grainy mustard so I added a touch of dijon. I also added some chopped, roasted walnuts. The dressing is just so easy and good. All of the flavours complimented each other nicely. Watch the salt on the chicken, though, as grainy mustards can be a bit salty. I will definitely add this to the summer salad repetoire.
