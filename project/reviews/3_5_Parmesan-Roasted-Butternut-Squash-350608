This recipe works well in a corning-ware pot on top of a wood burning stove for great comfort food in a lights out blizzard.

I made this recipe for Christmas Eve dinner not knowing what to expect. Honestly, it was a matter of color. I needed something red or orange because the other dishes were green and brown. I had 20 guests. I served this dish as one of the sides, to the main dish that was barbecue baby ribs. This dish was the favorite. People had seconds and thirds. Of course I had tripled the recipe. I used a lot more cream that the recipe calls for, also I used straight parmegiano (fresh of course that I grated myself) because I couldn't find the cheese called for in the recipe. I also used a lot more sage than what the recipe calls for. But other than that I made no changes. Most of the changes in quantity were done by gut feeling. Just been cooking for too long. I will recommend this recipe. I will definitely so it again. One word of caution, this dish turns out rather sweet tasting so if you do not like sweet sides with your regular salty foods you may not want to serve this dish.

Made as instructed with pre-cut butternut squash, but I didn't have any sage. It was very good anyway!

This recipe is easy and delicious. My husband, who is not a huge fan of butternut squash, also enjoyed this recipe. The sage is a perfect seasoning - we used fresh leaves and it added a subtle but unmistakable flavor. We will probably put this on the table at Thanksgiving. It's that good! Also, according to Weight Watchers' recipe this is 6 points per serving (assuming 8 servings in the recipe) - enjoy!

I used goat milk instead of cream (b/c I'm allergic to milk), and I used vegan parmesan. Still worked out perfectly and fabulously delicious. Will use the base for pasta recipes too...my husband loved it too.

I balked at first based on the simplicity of the ingredients but b/c of the reviews, decided to give it a try. It was delicious!! DO NOT substitute shredded parm in this recipe or your sauce will be a clumpy, gloppy mess.

I didn't use enough cream for amount of squash I was preparing, so it was a little dry, but I have to say the flavor was amazing, and still had guests asking for the recipe.

Used this recipe since we had some squash to use up and had all ingredients on hand. I was very surprised! It was very tasty and my daughter who "hates" squash actually ate it and liked it. She said she'd give squash another chance. Prepared recipe as instructed with no changes.

Another delicious Butternut Squash recipe. I didn't have sage so I used fresh thyme and it was delicious. I made it exact aside from that. It's rich, so paired with a light salad, it was perfect!

Yum! I had all the ingredients on hand and threw this together on a whim. I made it exactly as written, and it's rich but totally delicious. You could certainly add a bit more sage or cheese, and I added a bit more salt at the table, but I'm a salt lover : ) Very rich, very good, very likely to be made many times over the next few months! And while some complained of this dish being "boring," I liked it a lot better than another butternut squash recipe from this site that was way more work (it had leeks and nuts as I recall). This is creamy, ooey-gooey comfort food.

For a simple and quick recipe this is wonderful. I increased amount of fresh sage -- about 1 TB chopped. Use good cheese for best flavor. This is a keeper.

Really easy to prepare and delicious on a cool, fall night. Tip if you don't have much time: Buy already peeled and cut squash at Trader Joe's.

Absolutely delicious - I didn't have sage leaves so used a tsp of ground sage - perfect flavor and a true taste of fall! I let it sit covered, for about 15 minutes after cooking and it was perfectly tender with that wonderful cheesy sauce. A definite addition to every fall dinner, buffet, pot-luck supper we go to!

It sounded good to begin with, but I wanted more of an entree so I small- diced a half of a ham slice and browned it really well first. Added a generous pinch of red pepper flake and dried sage and put it all into a shallow casserole dish, then poured the cream over it all. I covered it with foil for the first 30 minute or so, and it didn't seem to be cooking at all, so I kicked up the heat to 450, and let it cook for about 20 more minutes. By then it was getting bubbbly, so I took the foil off and sprinkled the cheese on top and popped it back into the oven for about 10 minutes until brown. The cream was still loose, but as it sat for about 10 minutes, it started absorbing back into the squash. When serving, we simply spooned a bit of the cream over the top. I was skeptical, but it really did taste good. The addition of the ham made it a nice homey entree, with some fresh green beans and a salad, it was a great dinner. I used precut squash, about 2 lbs. from the store, made an easy presentation.

I made this with a few tweaks, and it was a huge hit. It has been officially added to the annual Friendsgiving menu. In Lieu of sage, I subbed 5 sprigs of thyme. I also chose to use Toscano with cinnamon instead of Parmigaino-reggiano. Fabulous and easy!

Rating: 3
this was a hit this past weekend. did it for a dinner party on a trial run for Thanksgiving. I will definitely make for T-Day. Make sure you COVER the squash for the first portion of the cooking (a direction I missed but was still able to recover). As other reviewers suggest, go heavy on the sage. I even crisped some sage leaves in butter and crumbled over the top.

Rating: 3
I'm a little surprised at all the four fork ratings this got. Fresh butternut squash baked with cream and sage is gonna be pretty good no matter what. But the parmesan cheese is too mild to really add much too it. I might try it again with romano or a sharper cheese as another reviewer did. Also beware--as with any melted real cheese dish, you need to serve this piping hot out of the oven. As soon as it starts to cool, the parmesan starts to congeal and it becomes a hard, crusty mass. It definitely tasted good, but not four-fork worthy!

Rating: 4
This was&wait, give me a minute. We thought& all right. One more time&I can't even&. Ok, it's official. In my book there are no words to describe how delicious this was. I used RAW organic cream, which has got to help. We also had no sage but had homegrown rosemary, so I used a whole lot of that instead. And as I usually do I substituted romano cheese for parmesan, since it has more bite and flavor. May be making some more today, and will eat whatever portion is left after offering it to the gods as proof that I'm deserving of salvation.

A little too salty for my taste, and I think it would have been well served by more seasoning from the sage. Next time, I'll dial back the salt and amp up the sage. Tasty overall, though.

This was, by far, one of the easiest and tastiest recipes for a side dish that I've ever made. It's as good for company as it is for everyday family use. Both DH and I really enjoyed it and from now on, it's at the top of the side dish rotation in my home.

I used a little extra sage because we like the flavor, finely chopped. Found two uses for left-overs: 1) mash and mix with a little pasta water for a great pasta "sauce" 2) add some chicken or veg stock and puree for instant soup

I forgot to add that you should toss the butternut squash with about 1 tbsp olive oil before before adding other ingred. & roasting:)

This is an excellent recipe as is but my family loves butternut squash and I don't always want all that fat. I use 1/4 cup cream, 1/2 cup chicken broth, 1 tsp Rubbed Dalmation Sage instead of the fresh (just because I usually don't have it on hand) and 1 tsp organic Real Salt Seasoning Salt (an ancient, pure, unbleached sea salt - found at your health food store or online at www.realsalt.com). I prepare as recipe states, except I don't cover while roasting. This is simply delicious!

Rating: 4
For the calorie counters and non- purists: replace cream or 1/2 & 1/2 with chicken stock but first stir cubed squash with a tablespoon of olive oil and season according to recipe. Bake as directed in recipe. Absolutely outstanding. I wouldn't even think of adding cream. This recipe has earned its place on my table

This is a great different take on squash. Easy to make and yummy to eat. But it does not reheat well, so make sure you eat it all the first time.

Don't use half & half! It completely separated and curdled in the oven. I tried to create a mashed dish with the remains, but it turned out pretty disgusting...be warned!

One of the tastiest dishes I've had in some time. I was out of sage, but substituted some wonderful organic oregano. Everything else was exactly as listed. Relatively easy recipe - hey it's only four ingredients.

I would say, add this to whole wheat rotini or bowtie pasta, maybe with some asparagus, for a whole meal! I also used half and half instead of heavy cream successfully. I used about 3 pounds of butternut squash (which is not that hard to prepare, is fresher than out of a bag, and saves on packaging.)

Exceptional. This is a new fave. I didn't have Parmegianno-Reggiano, so I did 1/3 each of Parmesan and Asiago. Delish!

This recipe was quite delicious, especially considering the amount of effort that it required (read: hardly any). With an unlimited amount of time to cook, this wouldn't be my first choice, but it's so quick and easy that it will likely become a regular in my rotation. The only issue I ran into was that the uppermost pieces of squash did not cook as thoroughly as those actually in the cream, but knowing this is the case it could easy be avoided in the future.

Made this as-is except my sage plant up and died so I had to use the dry stuff - I'm sure it would be better with fresh. It was very delicious but possibly a little rich for the groaning Thanksgiving board. I'd like to make this again for a weeknight supper with a salad. Cooked in a single layer in a shallow pan covered with foil, then removed foil & added the cheese for final 20 minutes - by the end most of the cream was decadently absorbed.

@A Cook The sage is what makes this recipe and I usually add more to it. Without the sage it's really just cubed Butternut.

I just had a quick question for people--how necessary is the sage for this recipe/any suggestions on what I might substitute for it? I'd like to try to make this for Thanksgiving, but I'm living in China right now and I think finding sage might be kind of a struggle. Thanks!

I have made this recipe several times; it is a huge hit! This past time I added chopped Gala apple, a pinch of nutmeg and a pinch of cinnamon, all of which added a sweet and intriguing note. Extra sage is a must! Don't skimp on the salt and pepper either. I used Trader Joe's precut cubed butternut squash which saves a ton of time and anguish, and half and half which cut down on the fat. I'll be making this for Thanksgiving this year!

I must admit that this was the first time I've had butternut squash! I liked the squash but wasn't crazy about this recipe. It was too saucy and it the squash ended up muschy. The flavor was good though so I pureed it and turned it into a creamed soup.

I increased the fresh sage to over 1 T minced & would likely add more the next time. To ease the Thanksgiving rush, I did most of the preparation the night before -up to adding the parmesan. I refigerated it until an hour before dinner. Than baked it at 350 for 30 - 40 minutes. Everyone liked it including an 11 month old baby & a 3 year old. I'd doubled the recipe & 11 people ate most of it. I'm now sharing it with my friends.

I made this for Thanksiving '08 and it turned out wonderful. I tossed the squash in the cream and cheese prior to cooking and added just a tad more cheese on top at the end and put it under the broiler for just a couple of minutes to get the cheese melted and browned. Even people that didn't like squash loved this dish. It's a new Thanksgiving staple in my family.

Disappointing waste of calories. In the future, will toss the butternut squash in a bit of evoo and when it's done roasting (in the oven or on the grill) toss it immediately with the parmigiano-reggiano and sage. Virtually same result, far less calories.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving in a oblong casserole dish & covered it with foil. For this reason I believe, it did not turn out as expected. It was soupy and the squash was mushy. I mashed the squash because i could not serve it otherwise. It was incredibly tasty...everyone loved it and went back for seconds. I'm making it again!!

Made this for Thanksgiving 2008. Didn't measure anything, but followed the general proportions. Used two good-sized squash and threw them in a large oblong baking dish, salted it, minced the sage leaves and scattered over, then threw it in the fridge. When ready to bake, I glugged in 1/2 pint of heavy cream and covered with a good handful of high-quality grated parmesan. Had to increase the cooking time significantly as the bottom layer of squash was NOT done. I basically stirred the whole thing gently and continued to cook it. All 10 people at the table agreed that it was absolutely delicious.

Rating: 4
I did find some other suggestions helpful; heating the cream to infuse the flavor of the whole sage leaves worked well, as did a sprinkle of nutmeg. I made it for Thanksgiving and precooked it to the point where the cheese gets added, then added the cheese and refrigerated. Cooked it the rest of the way as my turkey rested and it worked out just great. Very delicious, and a combination of toothier squash and softer squash. Yum.

I was really underwhelmed with this recipe. It tasted fine, but I had somehow expected it to be more roasted and caramelized. I didn't care for the appearance of the parmesan, which clumped and looked almost curdled. I am a huge butternut squash fan but would probably never make this again. Not worth the calories!

I agree with A Cook from Windham, ME - its one thing to helpfully let the site know that there's too much liquid or the baking time should be watched. But random additions of chili or garlic powder seem way too common. Folks that love to throw garlic powder on everything probably would like most anything with garlic powder. I just saw a review from someone who usually rates the recipes based on how she thinks the ingredients will taste - not by actually making the recipe!

Rating: 3
This is really just a comment: It's very hard to judge a recipe by the reviews posted here when hardly anybody makes the recipe as written!! I read all eleven reviews and I think only one or two managed not to add something new, change the amount of something, or leave something out. When you're adding everything from red pepper to brown sugar and doubling this or modifying that, it's not the same recipe. It becomes all about personal preference and cooks trying to "improve" on something they haven't even tried as is. Not really helpful, Folks.

Butternut squash is one of my favorite foods, so I knew I'd like this regarless. This recipe was OK - used half & half instead of cream, and it didn't bind well so will probably stick to cream next time. Also added crushed chilli peper for a kick, which gave it more flavor (I love salty/sweet/spicy!)

I made this today but didn't have cream, so used half&half.... didn't have sage, so I skipped it. I did increase the amount of parmesan to a little over a cup and increase the amount of half&half so that it was saucy. It turned out yummy and simple. Presentation looked good, too. I would consider adding this as an easy side for Thanksgiving.

I took everyone's advice. I melted butter in saucepan (used 4tbsp instead of 3) added LOTS of sage and let this infuse for about 5 minutes on low before adding 3/4 c cream AND a 1/2 cup milk. I let this warm over low for about 5 minutes. I added 1/2 tsp of brown sugar and a generous pinch of nutmeg to the mix. I tossed the liquid with the squash in a casserole dish and cooked as directed, adding shaved parmesan and grated for texture. My version was soupy and saucy, had a good balance of sage, salty, and sweet (in my opinion). I made this for a potluck and served it with an apple, candied pecan, goat cheese salad. YUMMY!! Good comfort food for the winter! Next time I might add some Quorn cutlets (a vegetarian "chicken" cutlet) for a one pot meal!! SO GOOD!

We loved this and will serve it Thanksgiving, but I must admit I had a very small squash, and used 1/2 heacy cream, 1/2 cup of Reggiano, and extra sage. Will adjust it accordingly for a large crowd.

As buffster said - this is a recipe for roasted butternut squash, not creamed or "cheesy". I made this as written with the addition of 1 tsp each of fresh rosemary and thyme. Everyone mentioned the recipe being boring so use a bit more salt to bring out the flavors and a nice dose of freshly ground pepper. For those who love butternut squash like me, this is a keeper.

While I can't be sure what the two former posters may have been expecting, I expected just what the recipe stated, ROASTED Butternut Squash, not creamed, etc. I actually found it to be only slightly bland, added a dash of white pepper, a few pinches of savory spices. It was wonderful!!

This was great *if* you modify - thanks to CourtR111 for your comments (add cream, add 2times more sage and infuse by warming the cream). I also sliced the sqash in 1/4 inch slices and did not cube it - it looked beautiful in 2 pie pans. Sprinkled with nutmeg (unofficial mascot of all Fall roasting, I think). Probably used more cheese than called for and I am glad I did. The basic recipe is a good foundation - I think it lets you modify really well with anything you like.

The flavor of this dish was good but the recipe did not turn out as promised or perhaps what I envisioned. There was not enough liquid so no sauce ever formed. Bummer, as I was looking forward to a nice big plate of saucy squash for dinner.
