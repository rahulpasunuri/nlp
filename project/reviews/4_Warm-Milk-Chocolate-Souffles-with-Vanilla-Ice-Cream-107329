I used part milk chocolate and part semi-sweet chocolate - This was incredibly simple and very good but all of my souffles collapsed! If I could figure out how to make them stay fluffy, this would be the ideal dessert to serve.

I loved this! Easy and impressive, a winning combination. I one and a halved this for 12 servings for New Year's Eve, made hours ahead of time and kept refrigerated, popped into the oven as we started our main course, and they turned out perfect. Added a scoop of peppermint ice cream. Just the right of chocolate without being so rich you can't finish, in my opinion.

I halved the recipe and it still came out pretty well. But the dessert definitely needs vanilla icecream or just whipped cream.

Have made this a few times - it is so easy, always a success and a hit with guests. Best described as somewhere in-between a warm chocolate mousse and a soufflé, with a mild chocolate flavor due to the milk vs semi-sweet chocolate. I have prepared this in advance and placed in the refrigerator hours before baking and it has been perfect. A keeper!

Very nice rich chocolate indulgence. The molten center ( do not overcook - maybe undercook slightly to be sure) is so rich and dark and delicious and paired with the cold creamy ice cream - YUM!

This was the first time I attempted a souffle. What an incredible dessert. I topped it off with homemade vanilla ice cream tableside. It was very easy to make. Only drawback is you have to time it just right to come out of the oven in time for dessert. Looking forward to making this for another dinner party tonight.

Very tasty. This was my first souffle attempt, and it was wonderful. Everyone waddled away full and happy.

While this dish appears and tastes impressive to your guests, you will be surprised to know that it is so easy! It's sinfully rich and the use of milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet is an interesting twist. The combination of the molten chocolate center with vanilla icecream is divine. Everyone loved it and I highly reccommend trying it yourself.

This was good, but nothing phenomenal--the milk chocolate flavor was maybe a little too subtle for my tastes,(which I guess would be expected when using milk chocolate)and the souffles began to collapse before they were out of the oven. Overall not bad, though; I served them with peppermint or vanilla ice cream.

Simple, do ahead, impressive -- how can you beat that! I passed a bowl of raspberries along with the ice cream. Everyone adored these little gems!

Very easy and wonderfully sumptuous right out of the oven. Perfect for a cold winter day. Used half the recipe without a problem for four servings.

This is a fabulously easy recipe. We are eating them within 30 minutes of the first chocolate craving.
