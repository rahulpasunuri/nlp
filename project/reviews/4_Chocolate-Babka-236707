Wonderful! Yes, the dough is very sticky so just don't do much with it. I used a well-floured surface and rolling pin. Rolled it slowly once and then flopped it in the pan. It wasn't messy because there was little handiwork with it.

Great recipe but baking with yeast is not for the novice baker or someone who lacks the patience to wait for rising dough. When reading the other reviews, the low fork ratings are all coming from people who made mistakes during the process or perhaps never baked before and are better at cooking.

OMG...AMAZING!!My mom used to buy and make this when I was a kid, I was so craving it and came across this recipe and decided to try it - all I can say is WOW - tastes exactly how I remember, I didnt use the Chocolate filling as the Babkas we ate were Cinnamon,sugar and Sultanas,so used them as a filling and worked really well! Really easy recipe to follow, thank you for putting it up!

The taste was good. The dough was unworkable with the amount of flour given in the recipe. I had to add about 1 more cup of flour and used quite a bit to to roll the dough out. Even after that I had to sort of drop it in the pan

Loved this! I can't wait to make variations. I followed the recipe, but didn't shave the chocolate, just left it in chunks. I told my kids it was challah with chocolate inside -- and it was! It looks beautiful too.

I have baked this cake a few times over the last 6 months and it comes out great every time. I don't use a mixer to prepare the dough, its soft enough that I can mix it by hand. After it rises, if it is still too soft to work, I add more flour (sometimes as much as 1/2 a cup). For the filling I have used Nuttela, tahini + honey, jam + sugar + cinamon... everything works.

I was not impressed by this bread. but that's probably because I made some mistakes along the way! This was super dry....even though I baked it for the time suggested, I think I will have to significantly cut down the baking time, by maybe 5-10 minutes. Also, I used bittersweet Callebaut chocolate, finely chopped, as suggested. Not only was this almost impossible to grate- the hardest part of the recipe in fact, I would prefer a sweeter chocolate. I also found the texture very powdery. I wish I had used Ghiradelli chocolate bars as I had initially intended. This dough was very soft but I did not find rolling or shaping it too difficult. I will try this recipe again and hope for better result. Also, mine was more like a cake and I was hoping for a Brioche type dough. My family really like it though!

I can't exactly rate the recipe yet as I haven't baked it yet. I'm sure it is delicious but I don't know what I did wrong. I followed the dough recipe exactly, les it rise and it was still so thin and impossible to work with. I added extra flour and attempted to roll it out on an EXTREMELY floured surface. With all of the flour on my hands and surface/rolling pin, I'm sure it added another 1/4 cup! It was SO difficult to roll! I can't understand what happened. Is this the consistency every one else was working with?

Delicious...I almost ate the whole loaf!! I used fresh yeast, left the chocolate in small chunks, added cinnamon to the top before the egg wash...and left it overnight int he fridge before baking the next morning (after bringing to room temperature as suggested). Absolutely fantastic recipe and a cake that all will love!

Rating: 4
Great recipe! It was more moist and lighter than the Martha Stewart recipe and definitely better tasting. I also left the borders off when sprinkling the chocolate and sugar (except for the egg wash edge). I also used Ghirardelli Ground Sweet Chocolate and Cocoa and sifted it on the dough to keep the layer even (and it saved me the trouble of grinding the chocolate myself). It should be in most grocery stores with the baking chocolates. I also let the dough rise in front of the fireplace where it was slightly warm, not hot!, and it really rose well. Make sure it is cooled completely before you slice it or the layers gets mushed together. It is delicious!!!

This is a great recipe and makes a wonderful holiday gift. No one believed it was homemade. I don't love chocolate so I also tried the recipe using cinnamon powder and chopped walnuts and it was delicious. The next time, I will add currants. It's time consuming but easier than I expected, and very rewarding.

Also, I forgot to mention. I used granulated vanilla sugar instead of white. Worked nicely with the chocolate filling.

This was excellent! I followed the directions, and they were quite easy. The only part that was challenging, was putting the softened butter onto the rolled-out dough. It kept tearing. Next time, I will melt the butter. Be sure you use good quality chocolate. Using anything less will really compromise the overall taste. At the last minute, I decided to add a streusel topping - it added a nice texture and taste.

I am a former New Yorker and was/is addicted to Zabar's babka. Now I've found the perfect recipe to make it at home. I used 70% bittersweet chocolate and it was even better than the first loaves and used crushed raw sugar instead of white. Delish!

I followed the recipe exactly-except I mixed the dough in my Breadman machine on the dough cycle as a previous reviewer had suggested. I dumped the ingredients in the machine (after foaming the milk, sugar and yeast separately-although you could probably do that first in the machine as well and save washing another bowl) and let it cycle through, adding the softened butter in thirds towards the end. I left it in the machine for the first rise. The dough was soft but elastic when I took it out. I finished according to the recipe, and the breads turned out great! It was easier than I had expected, considering I am not experienced at making yeast breads. My 12, 10 and 8 year-old boys couldn't get enough of this sweet, soft, buttery, chocolatey bread!

Love this babka. I worried the dough was too sticky the first time I made it so I added extra flour. It was a mistake. Have gone with the sticky dough since and it turns out moist and delicious. Also used semi sweet ghirardelli. Yummo.

Rating: 4
Delicious babka! I added an extra cup of flour so that the dough would hold when rolling (first time I made this, I did not use an extra cup, and the dough was far too liquidy). Didn't add the sugar for the filling, but if you like it sweet then I recommend adding it as written in the recipe. Rich and light, a wonderful accompaniment to tea or coffee at any time of day. I was able to make 3 loafs using pans slightly smaller than recommended.

Rating: 4
This was a delicious babka and generally easy to make. I skipped the eggwash and it turned out great. If you arent very fond of a hard crust, I suggest doing the same. although it says 6.5 hours time, you really need to set aside a good part of your day for this recipe, as you must check the dough every half hour to make sure its ok. Everyone who has tried this recipe loved it!

OK, I altered this recipe. I used pumpkin butter instead of chococlate. I should have added cinnamon to the sugar sprinkled on the dough before rolling,but the result was still great. The dough held up extremely well to the wetness of the pumpkin butter, had great flavor and texture.

I was at first disappointed with the Babka, my twist design fell and the loaf had a smooth top. I'm not sure what I did wrong, but once I tasted the Babka, I know that I'll try, try again. Delicious.

I have since made this recipe with a variety of fillings, including caramel with cinnamon and bacon & shredded cheddar cheese and they have all been superb.

I grew up in NY and eating babka was a big part of our family traditions. Where I live now it's impossible to find so I decided it was time to make my own. We found this recipe to be a bit dry and not like the babka I grew up on. My kids said to them it tastes like challah with chocolate. I would make it again but as a breakfast babka. I'm really looking for more of a moist, chocolatey dessert style babka.

This babka came out great! My husband said it was better than the version we used to get at our local bakery that has since closed. I made several changes, however. I added almond paste to the chocolate filling and decreased the amount of butter. I also added the extra egg white to the filling mixture to keep it moist (something other recipes recommend). I didn't add sugar to the filling since almond paste is quite sweet. Also, I kneaded the dough by hand once it held together because I always find hand-kneaded dough comes out better. Finally, I added the crumbly streusel topping that I remember from the bakery versions - 1/2 confectioners sugar, 1/2 flour and 6 tablespoons of butter. This recipe is much better than others I have tried.

This was very good! I prefer a chocolate brioche, but this dough was light and buttery as well. This is a great recipe to try, however I noticed my babka had a slight yeast flavour. It was barely noticeable, but I think next time I won't let the dough rise for so long (try 1.5 hours)

I had started to make a babka recipe that I found on another site and had to start over (bad yeast). In the meantime, based on the reviews, I decided to try this recipe instead. As a result, I did not follow this recipe exactly. The short review: excellent, wonderful, delicious. Read on if you care to know the details. I had already made the filling for the first recipe, which was slightly different (unsweetened cocoa, ground semisweet choc. chips, and ground walnutsquite good) I had also pressed half the topping into a greased bundt pan, so I baked the babka that way. Some of the topping adhered to the pan rather than the babka, but I easily rejoined it to the babka using a simple glaze of confectioners sugar and milk. I followed the recipe for the dough almost exactly, but using salted butter and about 1/4 teaspoon extra salt, based on what other reviewers had reported. I found the dough relatively easy to work with and had no trouble with assembly. I divided the dough in half after Id assembled, just to get it in the bundt pan easily (made one, large babka). In my euphoria at actually being able to roll out and assemble the babka, I completely forgot about the figure 8. This did not seem to hurt the outcome at all. Having looked at many babka recipes, I think spreading the butter on the dough before filling it may be what distinguished the taste and texture most. The filling I usedlike the one for this recipeis not too sweet, but has a deep chocolate flavor. I dont like babka with too much sugar topping and filling. The level of sweetness was just perfect. Maybe because of the butter, this babka is not quite as dry as the type I am used to. I brought it to a potluck where it was a big hit with people who grew up eating babka, and with those who never heard of it.

Everyone's looking for the babka they grew up with, and for me, this is it-light, moist, not too sweet and perfect filling. Scharffenberger 60 percent chocolate chopped easily and tasted great. Here are my high altitude tweaks for 5,000 feet to prevent the dough from rising too fast. This makes a pretty slack dough, but trust me, you need that to bake a yeast bread way up here! Add 2-3 T milk; subtract 1-2 T sugar; subtract 1/2 tsp yeast; add 1/4 tsp salt. Check dough vigilantly and punch down thoroughly, probably every 30-45 minutes. Do two initial rises to let gluten develop really well. Before refrigerating, cool in freezer 15 minutes to slow the rise. I also added a cinnamon steusel topping after the egg wash.

Rating: 4
i thought this recipe was exceptional. the dough was very soft and sticky at first, but after the first rise, it's very easy to work with. i ended up making one giant loaf, which baked for about 1 hour (i tested with a toothpick). like other reviewers, i'm going to omit the border next time i make it, as i wasn't pleased with the end of dough that has no chocolate in it. i will definitely try it again with cinnamon sugar or with streusel on top!

This recipe is definitely a keeper. I have failed miserably with yeast recipes before, but this turned out perfectly soft and delicious. I didn't put Chocolate in it, though, I put a mizture of cinamon sugar - it was so good, my 4 year old son devoured it! Excellent recipe!! Can't wait to make again!

I'm really pleased with how this came out. I only added one thing and that was to salt the chocolate layer before adding the sugar. I made five batches of this yesterday and let four rise overnight in the fridge. They look as good as the one batch I baked straight away yesterday. I used the Guittard bittersweet (63%). I shaved the chocolate off the block, which made it it very easy to distribute evenly on the dough. I strongly recommend this recipe.

I made this exactly as the recipe advised, and it was spectacular. It made a very brioche-y dough and the chocolate (I used Callebaut) was enough to be interesting but not overwhelming. It did get very brown, but that's brioche for you . Truly excellent, and quite easy. The extra loaf froze well.

Delicious! I took others advice and increased the flour by about half a cup, maybe a bit more. I twisted it into one figure eight but couldn't see how to do two, so I didn't. It came out fine anyway. I tried one slice while it was still warm and it was so good I had to have another.

A terrific cake! I added chopped toasted walnuts to the chocolate mixture which made this babka even better. The recipe should emphasize that the chocolate mixture should be spread very evenly over the dough, so that when you slice the finished product, you get consistent amounts of chocolate in each slice. I love that the dough part is not too sweet.

Rating: 2
I enjoyed making this recipe. The second rise needed a good bit of warmth (next to fire place worked well). I used Scharfen Berger (sp) 60% chocolate - found it to be a bit too harsh in contrast with subtle sweetness of the bread. Would make it again - only with a milder chocolate. Family gobbled it up, though. Also, the top browned quite a bit before the bread was actually baked through. Will cover lightly with a little foil next time to keep the top from browning too much. Maybe next time I'll try it with cinnamon and nuts.

I made this recipe a couple of times. This bread only needs two things to make it great: excellent chocolate (I used Vahlrona 71% cocoa bars and more salt (1 1/4 teaspoons at least). I suggest you use salted butter as well. This will help to balance all the sweetness. It is a very sticky dough to roll out but I used about a half cup of flour, turning the dough over as I rolled it, adding more flour and liberally flouring my rolling pin and that really helped. I forgot to put the sugar into the chocolate layer and only used 3 tablespoons of butter (melted and brushed on) and it still tasted fine. Definitely worth making and is a nice gift for others.

I usually don't submit ratings on recipes I don't like but this one has me stumped. I followed the recipe exactly. The directions were well written and my babka turned out looking just llike the one in the picture. However, the test is in the tasting and that is where things went wrong. It tasted good but not great and for all the time and work this recipe involves, that was not good enough. I have tasted far better babkas...and I can't put my finger on exactly what is missing with this one...but someting IS missing. Sorry for the negative comments.

Surprisingly, this turned out really well. I had a somewhat disastrous day and ran out of time to get these baked before the party I was supposed to bring them to (the second rise wasn't complete after an hour). So I warmed up the car, carefully transferred them to the backseat, and left, intending to bake them there. A sudden traffic stop on the way sent the pans flying to the floor, deflating the loaves! I arrived in a sour mood with deflated, raw babka, but decided to bake them anyway. And lo and behold - they were delicious. They smelled so good while baking that no one would let them cool to room temperature before slicing. The loaves definitely weren't as tall as I'd have liked, but the bread wasn't dense like I had feared. The plate got gobbled up quickly. One dieting party-goer said "damn you and your chocolate bread" after eating two slices! I also neeeded more flour to roll them out - the dough was very sticky. And I agree that the instructions suggest you roll it awfully thin. My chocolate was poking through in a few places and the resulting loaves weren't perfect, but they looked fine and tasted great. I wasn't crazy about the part of the ring that doesn't have any filling (because of the half inch border you leave all around). Next time I wouldn't leave as much of a border on the short sides so that when it comes together the filling is pretty even throughout. And there will be a next time - on a day when I have plenty of time.

This bread was fantastic, especially right out of the oven. I noticed it is almost an exact copy of my cinnamon rolls, but with a chocolate filling. I did have a bit of trouble with the recipe. My dough was far too soft to work with at all - I added about 3/4 c. more flour. Also, rolling it out to the exact size the recipe called for made mine far too thin. It made it nearly impossible to roll up without the chocolate breaking through the dough. So, I simply rolled it into a smaller square. The streusel topping suggestion was great. A lovely tasting bread!

This was fantastic. This is the best coffeecake or sweet bread I've ever tasted! It turned out incredibly moist and delicious. I accidently left out the sugar that is spread on top of the chocolate --- and then added it back later on top of the loaves. Didn't seem to make any difference. I ended up using half milk chocolate/half bittersweet chocolate (Lindt chocolate bars), so the increased sugar content in the chocolate may have self-corrected for my omitted sugar in the filling. When we twisted the babkas, one twisted fine, but the other split open. It baked up fine, but was less attractive. I'd urge careful and slow twisting to prevent splitting..... Overall, this is a fantastic recipe. It is somewhat time consuming, but only because of the 1-2 hr. rise periods.

What on EARTH did I do wrong? My dough was almost as soupy as cake batter, impossible to roll out. I followed the directions exactly, except that I don;'t have a stand mixer. I just used a wooden spoon and stirred like crazy until it was stringy, shiny, sticky and "very soft" like the recipe said. But it stayed very soupy after rising. Would appreciate any advice for future attempts!

Wow! This is incredible! I made this for a bake sale and planned to freeze on of the loaves for Christmas. Before I got it to the freezer, a quarter of it was already eaten. This is much better than the Martha Stewart recipe, which has an insane amount of chocolate. I did add about 1 T. and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon to the chocolate and I made the streusel topping like the Martha Stewart recipe. I added a few dashes of salt to the streusel and another tsp or so of cinnamon. I HIGHLY recommend this!

Wow! This is incredible. I made this for a church bake sale and planned to freeze one of the loaves for Christmas. Before I got it into the freezer, more than a quarter of it had been eaten! This is much better than the Martha Stewart recipe which as a ridiculous amount of chocolate. I did, however, add 2 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon to the chocolate and I made the streusel topping that is in the Martha Stewart recipe( I added a few dashes of salt and another 1/2 tsp. or so of cinnamon to the topping). I will definitely be making this again soon!

Everyone knows that chocolate babka is a parve dish -- which means no dairy. While I'm sure this is lovely, it's wrong. I would love it if they had provided us with a recipe made with oil rather than butter and parve chocolate (dark chocolate) and without the cream. This way, I could serve it with meat dishes as well.

I loved this recipe!! It was really easy to make in my Kitchen Aid and the dough is just incredible. I wanted to make mini loaves to give as Christmas gifts and they turned out wonderful.

I made this dish for Thanksgiving dessert and, although it was a bit time-consuming, it turned out very well (it looked just like the picture in the magazine!). Everyone praised the dessert, which was fun. The bread itself was very soft and buttery, and I used Ghirardelli espresso-infused dark chocolate for filling - delicious. I'll definitely make this one again.
