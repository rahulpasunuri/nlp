This smelt amazing as it cooked. And the flavors were great. I am unlikely to make it again simply because the sausages have so much garlic and onion in them which we are allergic to. So nothing to do with the recipe. I did however switch it up a bit -- I wanted some vegetable in it so sauteed some fennel pieces until soft, used applewood smoked bacon and added a little sour cream towards the end of cooking. Used sausages with feta and spinach (and waaayyyy to much garlic) from my local butcher My partner didn't notice the fennel (which was the point), liked the pork and didn't like the sausage becase he was allergic. Served with Beer Batter Bread (Epicurious) which was great and potobello mushrooms stuffed with mozzarella and tomato.

This was really tasty. I used chicken apple sausage because that's what I had on hand and it lended a nice sweetness. Be careful that you don't make the bread mixture too wet, otherwise you will incur the wrath of splashing hot oil like I did. :)

I made this in vast quantity and served it with ice cold beer for a pool party. Delicious!
