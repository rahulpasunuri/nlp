Making this cake started out badly: the dome did not "dome" and the filling did not firm up. However, the resulting concoction tasted pretty good and my family asked for me to make it again. Thanks to the other reviewers, I'll be able to do a better job next time.

Made as written - this was somewhat easy. My guests and I found the honey flavors well blended in the cake and icing. Follow Jacksonville's method below to make the filling.

This cake was a breeze to make and looked very impressive on the Christmas table. I think the folks that used their own ganache and different filling had the right idea. I liked the honey in the cake part, but found it to be a bit too much honey all together since it was in every component. I will definitely make the cake part again.

Not bad at all. But it took longer than the required amount to make sure the middle of the cake was cooked. I probably baked it about 10-15 minutes more but lowered the temperature to 300 degrees. Also added 1/2 tsp almond flavoring to the cake. I had no time to do the filling so I used rasberry preserve and it was fantastic. The icing was wonderful too but I added some cayenne pepper and cinnamon to it.

The cake was great! I used a chilled rotary mixer and bowl to make the filling. The gelatin/cream mixture cooled until it was lumpy, and I was afraid I goofed! But the filling set up perfectly. I forgot the pecans, so I used toasted pine nuts. I think next time I'll also add a little cayenne pepper to the glaze to give it a little surprise zip!

I didn't make the filling, and made my own ganache. The cake itself if absolutely great, and very easy to make. The honey gives it a unique "warm" taste and the cake comes out more on the spongy side. Great for people who love chocolate, and those that don't care for it because the chocolate flavor isn't very pronounced

Made it for a beekeeping group. Chilled the filling overnight to set it, which worked well. Used sliced almonds instead of pecans. Cake tastes best if completed and refrigerated for 1 day. Took out of fridge for about 1 hour prior to eating. Added marzipan bees with sliced almond wings. A huge hit.

This cake was good, but I was really hoping for something much more "chocolaty"...If I try it again, I think I'll make it as a layer cake with the glaze as a filling instead of the cream (as the glaze was the kind of rich chocolate I was hoping for), as well as add more cocoa powder....

Exceptional cake; and here is the secret to the filling: make it as directed (same ingredients; same quantities). Just whip the cream first with a mixer; then combine the honey and sour cream before adding to the whipped cream. Turn the mixer on full speed to blend it. Add the chocolate and do the same. You end up with a LOT of sufficiently firm filling. Put it ALL on the bottom layer. Carefully place the top layer on and before pressing it to spread the filling to the edge, wrap the cake horizontally in plastic wrap which makes it easy to push the filling out even with the sides (but not beyond). Pop it in the refrigerator over night and it's ready for the glaze.

I follow this recipe exactly and I got delicious cake and glaze were delicious but like many reviewers I had a lot of problems with the filling. I put very little filling on the bottom part of the cake and it still ran out. The remainder filling was put in the frig overnight and that after it was thick like a filling. Based on this I would suggest making the filling first let it harden overnight and then fill the middle of the cake.

Although there were many steps, I thought this cake was delicious. The cake and filling were light and a nice contrast to the rich ganache. The toasted pecans complimented the flavors. I would certainly make this again.

I tried the cake in two nine-inch pans, pouring slightly less batter in one so as to still get the dome effect on the top layer. The cake did not "dome" much for me but I didn't mind the look. I skipped the gelatin and used my stand mixer to whip the cream for about a minute before adding sour cream and honey and beating into peaks. This worked terrific for me - the filling was firm and tasty. Not my very favorite chocolate cake ever but a nice one to try and the honey gives it a surprising taste!

Did not use gelatin for the filling. I have a mixer so the cream filling thickened just fine without it. I also used two 9-inch pans instead of spring form. Very successful! Perfect for Easter!

this cake was so easy to make. Baked it in a 10 inch spring form pan and it worked just great. You don't even need a mixer to make it, it is all done by hand. Soooo easy. Had to bake a little longer than recipe directions but just keep testing it till it is done. The taste was fabulous and not too sweet, can really detect the honey used in it. I used less than 10 oz chocolate for the glaze and it was more than enough and did not use the pecans. Everyone raved and making it again for Easter Sunday dinner. This is definitely a keeper.

This recipe would never work as written. The filling is too runny. Beat the whip cream to stiff peaks, then fold in the sour cream and honey. Let the mixture sit in the freezer for 15-20 minutes, then layer the cake. If you can, assemble the cake in springform pan (so the filling stays put); that worked best for me.

Having same problem as cook from Baltimore. The filling would not thicken so I put foil collar around it to hold the filling in and maybe by morning it will have thickened enough to hold the top up.

This is the best cake EVER! I made it as a thank you for someone at work and everyone thought it was WONDERFUL! A few said that they thought it was probably the best cake they had ever had. It's so easy and has a great taste! What a winner!!!

Honestly have not eaten this cake yet, but am having a terrible time with the filling. I have made it twice now, two different ways. The recipe claims the cream, sour cream and honey will peak - never happened. But I continued anyway and then added the gelatin mix and chocolate. The whole thing curdled a bit. Hoping someone else has the solution. I have it in the freezer right now to try to firm it up before I pour it on the cake, otherwise it will run all over!
