Just delicious - but next time - I will halve the salt - To shorten the time - I cooled the syrup in the pot in a bucket of ice and I cooled the berry mixture in the freezer for less than 1/2 hour and then processed. I almost didn't put in the egg - so glad I did - yummy!

OMG!!! Delicious!! I only used 1/2 of the sugar and did not cool it prior to putting in a food processor. I strained the mixture and let it 'set' for about an hour. 30 minutes in the ice cream maker (refreezable bowl kind) and it was PERFECT!!!! Might not have needed ANY sugar at all it was sooooo good!!!!!!

this had terrific flavor but the texture did not turn out for me at all - more like a granita. it almost seems like there's too much air in the sorbet. maybe i added the egg too early?

Judging from the other reviews, I must have bollixed this up somehow. I let the sorbet cool in the fridge overnight, and it turned into a gelatinous mass. I whisked before putting in the ice cream maker to beak up the mass, but it still didn't freeze quite right. Maybe the egg white would help that. But the taste was off, too. Next time I have 6 cups of fresh blueberries, I'll stick with muffins and pancakes.

I didn't bother with the egg at all. But I did add about a tablespoon of ginger preserves in the blender step. Perfect!

This sorbet had a great flavor. The texture, for me, was a tad on the icy side. Not too bad, but would have liked it to be a little bit smoother. Perhaps if I strained the mixture (I chose not to), it might have frozen more smoothly.

Fantastic. I added a cup of chardonnay to it, which gave it a nice tang. I don't have an ice cream churn, so I put it in the freezer and stirred it about once an hour, and just added the beaten egg white on the last stir. A friend remarked, "Why doesn't everything taste like this?!" I also saved the strained-out solids, which I will be adding to blueberry muffins.

I made this exactly according to recipe. No basil, no cardamom, no nuthin'! I just wanted a frozen blueberry explosion and I got it! This was easy as pie, I didn't strain (why bother?) and I didn't use an egg white to emuslify, I used a tbsp of lite Karo instead, which does the exact same thing...I just hate wasting yolk! This was delicious and I think the remainder of the blueberries we picked are going to make another batch!

Terrific with the basil leaves. I chopped them and added them to the blender. Subtle but delicious.

Made it with frozen berries, a pinch of salt and a pinch of cardamom. Egg whites make the texture just lovely. No complaints, but it's more "delicious" than "exceptional."

Delicious recipe, I added a bit of Grand Marnier. I just couldn't get over the "fresh" taste of it. This is the first recipe I've seen that doesn't cook the berries and I think it makes a HUGE diffrence. Thanks to the Bent Spoon

Alright, straining is unnecessary, and the egg white does not need to be whipped...just dump it in in the last few minutes and this holds wonderfully in the freezer for as long as you can resist it. If you're impatient like me, skip chilling in the fridge and pop the mix in the freezer for ten minutes instead. Since I like my sorbet with the chunks of fruit in it, I actually skip blending as well and just toss the fruit in to cook a little with the syrup instead. Taste it before you add sugar, and you might be happy to go with a lower calorie and purer berry flavor...

After having blueberry basil gelato in a restaurant I tried this recipe with about a dozen fresh basil leaves. It had a very nice, clean taste for a light dessert.

I pureed all the blueberries in one batch in my blender. Perhaps I should have pureed in batches because I wound up with lots of bits of skin which did not enhance the texture of the sorbet. I'll make it again, but next time I'll try to get the puree really smooth or else I'll just have to strain the mixture, which is a step I usually avoid on principle. Also when I chilled the puree it became sort of lumpy like gelatin, so I stirred it around a little with a fork before pouring it into the ice cream maker. I did use the egg white. I wondered if I was supposed to whip up the egg white before adding it to the ice cream maker.

I made this for the fourth of July. It really pops with the lemon ice cream. I added a few stawberries to lighten it up a bit since bluberries can have such a rich flavour. It was great.
