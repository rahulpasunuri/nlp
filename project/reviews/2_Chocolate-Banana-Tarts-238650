1. I didn't have heavy cream so I made a mock heavy cream which turned out that it wouldn't whip UNLESS you had raw milk from a cow. The cream/chocolate/vanilla/banana combo didn't get frothy like it should but it became liquidy. 2. This is for a very small portion so I made it larger and thought the recipe itself was rather bland. 3. The cream/vanilla/banana base was actually pretty amazing, though! I could drink that everyday! I wouldn't make it again (not because I didn't use heavy cream, either).

This was ok. I made some errors in that I used 4 3/8 in tins rather than 3 in. which left me short on filling. I would reccomend using a different crust recipe because this one was hard and dry. I was expecting more of a pie crust. The filling was good though.
