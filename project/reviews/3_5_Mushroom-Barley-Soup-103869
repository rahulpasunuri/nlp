Exceptional! I took mixed advice of others. Made the barley 1.5 cups and used beef broth instead of chicken stock. Reduced the onion/mushroom mixture in some sherry before adding it to the pot, and added thyme and chopped dill for some green. No need for salt or pepper!

Great soup! I added lots of different kinds of sauteed mushrooms (button, fresh shiitake, portabello), a couple of cut-up roasted beets (delicious addition!!- wrap them in tinfoil, bake at 400 for 50 mins or till tender), roasted fingerling potatoes (cook same as beets, for less time), and fresh chopped rosemary and thyme. Definitely add some herbs to this soup. As with previous reviewers, I added some sherry to the onion and mushroom mix and reduced a bit. Using the full 14 cups of broth makes an enormous batch, I only used 8 cups of broth and cut the amount of onion in half. Oh, also added 1 chopped shallot to the onion mix.

First time everybody in the family thouroughly enjoyed dinner! I adjusted it a little. Used 7 cups beef broth and 7 cups water with 2 heaping tsp. of better than bouillon mushroom base. Than I added a couple of splashes of soy sauce to the onion mushroom mix. I followed the rest of the recipe and of course served it with crusty sweet french bread. Truely a dish beyond compare.

Carmelize onion, then add nice spash of sherry or madiera to onion/mushroom mixture and reduce before adding to broth. Add sprigs of thyme, and chopped dill. Also, I used Aromont Mushroom stock for the broth. At end of cooking add chopped parsley and drizzle black truffle oil on each bowl.

It will be four forks if you make these changes: Carmelize onion, then add nice spash of sherry or madiera to onion/mushroom mixture and reduce before adding to broth. Add sprigs of thyme, and chopped dill. At end of cooking at chopped parsley and drizzle black truffle oil on each bowl.

I agree with everyone who complained that there was to much barley, but it's easy to tinker with soup recipes. I also agree with mixing up the 'shrooms. I do find it lacking in colour, needs some green. Maybe a couple of spears of cooked asparagus on top to serve, or at least some parsley. Also, it's an easy one to make as a vegetarian dish if you sub a good homemade or bought veg or mushroom stock for the chicken broth.

I made this with extra carrot and parsnip, chopped with the celery in a food processor and sauteed for 10-15 minutes; I also used about twice as much of the dried shiitake mushrooms and presoaked those in boiling water while I prepared the rest. To save effort, I purchased sliced mushroom. I prepared the soup the day before I served it - and it tasted much better the second day. Before serving, I added 1/2 cup each chopped Italian parsley and fresh dill. Despite the various flavor enhancements, I agreed with others who thought the soup was too bland and would benefit from something extra - maybe white wine or sherry; maybe good beef broth or actual beef (though it's useful as a vegetarian dish). I guess the recipe would serve 8 as a main dish, but when I served it to 8 people as an appetizer, I had nearly two quarts left!

This is a good soup, but it would be more flavorful if I'd made my own stock. I omitted the parsnip, added a cup of vermouth, and cooked the mushrooms down - for about twenty minutes. I will definitely make this soup again!

I was very pleased with this receipe. I used less barley, no parsnips and added parsley. It came out perfect, not too thick like I was afraid of.

MEOW! I can't believe how tasty this soup is! A HUGE serving for not so many calories (4 points on the WW system.) Wow. This is a must make recipe!!

I added more barley than called for to make the soup extra thick. This is a good soup very satisfying.

Wow- I made this exactly as written except I left out the parsnip. I live a few blocks away from the 2nd Ave deli and mine came out exactly like theirs! I loved it and my neighbor came back the next day to ask for some more after trying this. All the onions give the broth very strong flavor, as do the dried shitake. I suggest you make this and judge for yourself! Go for it!

This soup is outrageously delicious!! A few changes that I made were: I added portabella mushrooms and parsley, used butter instead of oil and left out the parsnip. I also used only 1 cup of Barley for fear of the soup getting too thick. After it was done cooking I used my hand-blender to make it smooth. It is a hearty, tasty soup that I would recomend to anyone!!!

I couldn't get this one down the disposer fast enough. The parsnips were awful in this. Way too much barley for this amount of broth. Bland but still unappealing.

Made a few changes to the recipie -- I was pressed for time, and couldn't find barley, so I used some wheat bulgar and some basmati rice -- about 2/3 cup of each. I only used fresh mushrooms -- bella, crimini, oyster, and something else. Used veggie broth instead of chicken or something else. Let the rice and wheat cook for 35 minutes before adding the other stuff, instead of an hour as in the recipie. In the end, it was delicious, and I have enough left over for dinner for the next week or so. Serve with a grain bread, it's a yummy combo.

So THAT'S why the 2nd Ave Deli mushroom barley is the worst in the 'hood! Frankly, I've never seen a shiitake mushroom in the Deli's soup.

This is a hearty fireplace on a cold night soup to nourish your soul! I use an egg slicer to slice the mushrooms (stemmed and cap side down)and cook them on high heat until they are almost leathery 15-20 minutes (add garlic after 10 min), this really boosts the flavor and color of the soup. Yum.

It's fabulous.

Very tasty, but takes a little more work than I expected. Slicing up a pound of mushrooms made me really want a cuisinart. I suggest rehydrating and chopping the mushrooms before adding them to the soup. And adding more carrots, parsnips and celery.

This is an easy to make, absoulutly delicious soup, perfert for a cold winter day. One time I made it I used mushroom stock instead and it gave an even richer flavor.

I used a variety of mushrooms to give it a woodsey flavor. Adding shreaded chicken or turkey makes it a full meal. I prefer chicken broth over the vegetable broth (unless it can be homemade). Great winter meal!!

This dish has a woodsy, fall flavor especially if it is made with a variety of mushrooms.

This is a winning soup! Would give 3.5 forks. I cut back a bit on the chicken stock, just used 10 cups. Quick cooking barley cuts down on the cooking time and I can't tell the difference. I added the barley to the stock with the veggies. Also replaced dried shiitakes with about 4oz of fresh since that was all I could get this time. Don't think I would blend this soup - the barley might get a bit sticky.

Satisfying is the right word for this soup. I made it with dried porcini mushrooms and it was fine.

Can't imagine what the previous reviewer did to end up with a "glutinous" soup. We loved it - I thought it was just perfect. I prefer clear soups to creamy ones, but bet it is tasty if blended with a hand-held blender. Yum!

I have made this recipe twice now, halving it each time. The end result is TOO THICK and glutinous. even after adding a lot of extra spices, and stock, even white wine to thin it out. My husband did not like this in the least. A waste of good ingredients and effort.

This was very tasty. I followed the recipe exactly except that I left out the parsnips and at the end I used my hand-held blender to puree the soup into a smooth mixture. My husband said it was the best meal I've made since we've been married!!! I would recommend it to anyone.

absolutely delicious! I substituted some beef broth for the chicken broth and used 2 .4oz. pkgs. of dried shiitake mushrooms first soaked in boiling water. Then use the broth from the mushrooms strained through a coffee filter. I also used 1 tbsp. of soy sauce when I sauteed the vegetables.

Excellent soup, my husband said it was the best soup I ever made,it makes alot but thats ok cause it freezes well.Perfect for a cold winter day, soup, salad and a crusty bread made a perfect meal.

Delicious soup and easy to make. I used dried porcini mushrooms in place of the shitakes. Also added some extra broth as the barley made it a bit thick. Served it with grated romano cheese. Yum!

Rating: 3
Very good. I halved all the ingredients when I tried it as I was just cooking for myself, but it still worked and was very nice. It was a bit thick due to the barley absorbing the stock, and it could have done with the addition of a little extra stock at the end to thin it up a tad. Two other changes I'll make the next time I prepare this will be to add the vegetables earlier (so they'll have more time to cook--they were a bit too crisp), and to saute the mushrooms BEFORE the onions, or at the same time. By the time my mushrooms were ready to go into the stock, the onions had gotten a little overdone. I used fresh shiitakes instead of the dried, and I added a small can of chunk white chicken meat to the whole mess. It was great!

I find it a bit strange that someone would leave the mushrooms out of this recipe? but anyways - I made this for myself, my husband and mother-in-law, all of whom love mushrooms, and we really liked it. It did seem to be missing a little something - like Worcester or something - to give it a little kick. But overall it was great and seemed to get better every day.

This was a great recipe. I omitted the butter and used a dry white wine to saute' the vegetables. I also omitted the mushrooms (since some of my quests do not care for them) and added 10oz of diced filet at the very end. Everyone loved it.

Made a half portion of this soup last night. It was delicious and I plan to have it for lunch as well. The flavor is excellent for not having many spices. It was easy to prepare and if you love mushrooms I reccommend it.

Next time I will cut the recipe in half. We are a family of 5 and I had a lot of soup left. The second day I used a hand blender to puree the left over and added cream to it. That was really nice. The barley created the thickening agent to give it a creamy texture.

This is a good quick soup. I added two fresh pork hocks and cut the recipe in half for a soup and salad dinner on a busy night.
