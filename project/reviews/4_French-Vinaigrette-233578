This is my go to vinaigrette recipe..tastes just like what I had when I was living overseas. I do add minced fresh garlic or tarragon at times, and with addition of egg yolk it is basis for the classic caesar dressing.

I had a craving for a French vinaigrette and then found this - it hit the spot! I listened to the others and went heavier on the mustard (and didn't add any salt). Next time I might add garlic instead of the shallots just for variety.

This has got to be one of the all time great recipes for French Vinaigrette. Perfection. Seriously. Do not doubt that. Seriously. Good to know that someone out there in 1952 knew what was up, and now we do too!

I wish I could give this a higher rating, it was amazing!! I used Champaign vinegar instead of the white-wine and a little more Dijon mustard (probably closer to 1-1 1/2 tsp). I served this to a large group of people who normally skip the green salad and just eat meat and starch, but it all vanished, and I had several requests for the recipe

this was amazing, I made it for a big group that doesnt normaly eat green salad and it was soo popular that by the time I got to the salad there was nothing left. I did add a little extra Dijon mustart (maybe closer to a whole teaspoon) and used champaign vinegar instead of the white-wine vinegar because thats what I had arround....it was fabulous!!

Made this for a dinner club party... one member lived in France for several years and pronounced it, "authentic"! My new go-to dressing recipe!

3.5 forks. A great basic vinaigrette that you can whip up with what you have on hand. I prefer a stronger mustard flavor, so I use a coarse-ground dijon, and add about 1.5 tsp. Adding a bit of grated parmesan cheese is nice, too.

Just the right amount of acidity in this classic recipe. It's become my go-to everyday salad dressing.

I used this over a mixed green salad and a spinach salad; it was terrific and and almost had a "buttery" flavor to it.
