This recipe is similar to one I have made many times which uses lime juice instead of lemon and in addition to the cumin, uses chili powder. I put it on corn on the cob or potatoes. Delicious!

A couple of things to try are to make a bowl of pasta and then add the butter and fresh tomatoes. Spread some on bread and then add sliced cold chicken breast and tomatoes for a wonderful sandwich. Try some melted on grilled chicken or pork chops.

And then what do you do with it?

Would be nice if there were suggested uses included...
