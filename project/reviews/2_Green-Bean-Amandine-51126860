Tried this for my pre-Christmas Eve dinner. Left out the red wine vinegar. Did one day in advanced and refrigerated covered to let the flavors seep into the beans. The day of the meal, put in oven at 375 for 30 minutes uncovered. Received many compliments.

I received no compliments on this one despite a pretty looking dish. Red wine vinegar + cream = curdled milk. Try leaving out the red wine vinegar or maybe using wine instead for better results than mine. another alternative may be to add some dried cranberries to spice it up.
