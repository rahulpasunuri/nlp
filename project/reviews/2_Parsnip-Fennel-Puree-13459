parsnips and fennel, two of my favourite vegetables what could possibly go wrong??. I do not think this dish"works". the result was like a "baby's first" meal after coming off mothers milk, and the combined flavour was, in my opinion, too sweet. I am going to try chopping each into small dice, and blanching them, retaining that "crunch" and just a simple helping of freshly ground black pepper.

Wonderful flavors! Nice accompaniment for baked pork chops.
