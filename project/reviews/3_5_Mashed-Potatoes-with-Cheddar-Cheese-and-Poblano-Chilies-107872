We quite enjoyed this. The Poblano add a subtle heat and flavour. This would be a perfect side for a delicate fish dish. I want to make this again with hotter peppers and sharper cheese.

Definitely lacked zip when made as directed; added garlic powder, extra poblanos, extra cheese, and the liquid from a can of chopped green chiles. It helped a little, but not the best recipe ever.

Used precut mangos from Costco, frozen corn and whatever onion I had on hand. Great salsa. For the chicken, I just added spices - cayenne and cumin. Easy, quick and good. Served with cheese and jalepeno mashed potatoes.

I am a mashed potato purist. I am not a fan of roasted garlic, so I never hopped on the bandwagon of roasted garlic mashed potatoes. However, I was preparing a spicy meat dish and thought that roasted poblanos would be a great addition--- I was right. These mashed potatoes were great, and they did hold up to being rewarmed as the recipe promised.

After reading the reviews, I added garlic, salt and used a little jalapeno cheese in addition to the sharp cheddar. I agree with others that the potatoes lacked zip and were not as good as roasted garlic mashed potatoes or another recipe I tried this week from this site for potatoes with sage. To ascend from the ordinary they need much hotter peppers or twice the amount of poblanos including seeds. I won't make these again since there are so many potato recipes and so little time.

Very bland. Can't really taste the poblano chilis or the cheddar cheese (I used extra-sharp white cheddar). I think that the recipe should include at least 1 to 1 and a half teaspoons of salt as a baseline amount and then say "salt to taste." All other mashed potato recipes include salt. --not a well-conceived recipe.

I loved these. I used a combination of chilies, including some roasted mira sols, jalapenos and anahiems. The extra heat was great. I also included garlic and 1/2 & 1/2 rather than milk. The leftovers were fabulous.

If there wasn't enough salt, you can only blame yourself... it does say "salt to taste".

Great recipe! I followed it to the T and my family raved. I served them with the Chili-Rubbed Baby Back Ribs with Espresso BBQ Sauce on this website. Fantastic dinner.

Although the recipe itself is lacking salt and the peppers are too mild (I also used New Mexico chilis) it is a great starting point. I added garlic the second time and it was delicious. Leftovers were sought after the next day.

This was a good side dish for the CHILI-RUBBED RIB-EYE STEAKS on this site. I also thought it needed something else and the 2nd time I prepared it I tossed in some roasted red pepper. It was a nice balance to the spicy-cheesy flavor.

It was okay, but needs some additional seasoning--at least salt, if nothing else. Not as good as garlicky mashed potatoes or horseradish mashed potatoes.

I put Chipolte chile in my recipe as a substitute and they were deliciuos, the chile had a little bit of a bite coupled with the creamy flavor of the cheese...excellent (I served this with breaded pork chops and Argulla Salad, a perfect dish.)

We made this dish last night and were very happy with it. I would recommend broiling the chiles instead of grilling them. I also think this recipe could use another spice, but I am struggling to figure out what would complement it. I would also recommend using a little more cheese. I will be watching the reviews to see the variations on this recipe.

These were good. I was going to add garlic which would have put these over the top. Will make these again.

My family loved these. I added 8 peeled, whole garlic cloves to the boiling potatoes. The previous reviewer's recipe sounds yummy, too. She's right about the chili names, but, in San Diego, I see the poblano chili named pasilla, in some places.

Hi, i'm from Mexico City and this dish seems like one we have called "Rajas Poblanas", this is named like the chile called Poblano and when you cut it in stripes these are called rajas. For a better taste, roast it, do not broil, this is an ancient techique for Mexican food and for salsas. If you don't want a very hot taste, devein it with careful and remove all seeds, you'll get the taste of the chile without its hot. I'm sure you'll like this recipe alot. In México we have this recipe:roast chile Poblano, then peel and cut it in "rajas" (stripes) add chopped or sliced white onion, sour cream, salt, pepper, grated cheese (such as manchego)and potatoe squares(optional) previously poached. Heat about 15 min. moving constantly until everything is cooked and cheese is melted. This is served in "tacos"(w/soft tortillas) yum!!! it's delicious!!! i hope you enjoy it. Ps.: Fresh chile is called Poblano, dried: Ancho, not Pasilla as in the recipe says.

I haven't made this yet, but am planning to. This message is for Chad in Atlanta. A restaurant in Phoenix makes something similar to this recipe and since you said you were looking for an additional spice, you may want to consider this. They add Chipotle Sauce (it comes in a jar and hopefully you can find it in the Mexican or Ethnic food aisle in your grocery store)to the completed mashed potatos. It will turn them slightly "pinkish" in color because the Chipotle Sauce is red. The flavor is wonderful. I hope this is help to you.

I've been making a variation of this for more than 3 years. After roasting, peel and seed but only make a slit in the side of the poblano. Instead of mashed, I make garlic mashed, change the cheese to smoked cheddar or edam. Fill the chilies with the potatoes, and just before serving, a quick pass under the broiler to heat through.

Wow!! Absolutely to die for!!! If you're a mashed potato lover like I am, you MUST try this. NOT your mom's mashed potatos....the chilies add enough bite to make this dish a main course. I will make this again and again.
