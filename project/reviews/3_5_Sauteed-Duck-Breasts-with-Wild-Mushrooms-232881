Had no wine, so used brandy, little unconventional bet it worked, and I agree with everyone who said no to fruit it really doesn't need it!

Wow - simple and delicious! We had a half duck instead of just breasts, but the recipe worked fine. We served it with roasted fingerling potatoes and sauteed spinach for an easy but fabulous weeknight meal. I imagine it would be perfect with some earthy lentils - we will try that next time.

ps: be sure to include shiitake mushrooms in your "wild mushroom" mix. Their consistency adds much to the finished product.

This is easy to make once you get the timing right on the duck (I undercooked it at first and had to return it to the pan). Served with Red Cabbage Salad with Green Apple, Lingonberry Preserves, and Toasted Walnuts (recipe on this site) and steamed Wehani rice. My wife loved it and insists I make this again for guests.

No recommendation here! Duck breasts without a sauce are best on a grill. If you cook it too slow you don't crisp the fat and if you crisp the fat the finished product gets tough. Plus a lot of splattering grease in the pan. Mushrooms were dry. There are much better duck recipes out there.

Finally, a non-fruit recipe for duck breast (I don't like dessert with my entree), and all the reviewers feel compelled to add fruit to it. Let it go. This recipe was great...and without the fruit in my entree.

This is the non- fruity duck recipe I've been looking for. I rarely give 4 forks but it had all the elements of perfect. It was easy, quick, and really tasty. The only change I made was beef broth instead of the wine. The balsamic sweet mashed potatoes from this site and a good Merlot truly made this a decadent supper. Do-over!

i took the other cooks' suggestions and added 2 tablespoons of red currant jelly. I also added a handful of dried cranberries and a handful of pinenuts to the sauce to add some complexity. It turned out delicious!

This was a very nice recipe. It was fairly quick, easy and yummy. I followed the directions as stated with the only exception being the addition of 2 tbsp of currant jelly to the wine mixture, as another cook suggested. The duck and sauce turned out wonderful. This is definitely a keeper recipe.

I prepared this with two sauces. One was exactly as the recipe stated. It would have been better for a steak. Instead, I pre mixed a jar of red current jam with the wine to create which added a sweetness to the sauce that was delicious over the duck. I also added some dry cherry's to the mushroom mixture. It was a hit with our party.

This was very good but not very pretty . Be careful not to overcook the duck past medium rare and it should be a more attractive dish.

I now know I don't like wild mushrooms. Next time, I'll make this with a more traditional red wine reduction.

It should be called red wine duck. This tasted like most dishes where red wine is added late. Mushroom medley was overpowered. Maybe white wine? As ever, duck is difficult to find fault with.
