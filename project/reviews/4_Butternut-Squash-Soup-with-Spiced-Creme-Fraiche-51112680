I usually make the ginger spiced butternut soup, this was a delicious change. I used half the squash and broth - but same amount of spices & wine, no cream or sugar. Didn't make a purse, just added the spices to the soup. Loved it and will add it to my regular dishes.

Hands down the best butternut squash soup ever. I love squash but am not a huge fan of sweet applications, which typically rules out most soups as they emphasize the sweetness over the savoriness of squash. This, however, was a divine balance of the two. The star anise combined with lots of onion provided a mouthwatering base for the squash, which still managed to shine through. The creme fraiche added that perfect "little something extra,"; left out the Tbs sugar and paired with a rustic olive and thyme bread. Delicious! Company loved it! The only squash soup I will make from here on out.

I can't really put into words how much I loved this soup. I'm a huge fan of butternut squash soup in general, but this recipe in particular was worth the somewhat lengthy prep time. I think it's something about the combination of spices and the use of shallots instead of onions that give this soup its distinctive-and amazing-flavor. I made the recipe as written-except I used chicken stock instead of vegetable. The spiced creme fraiche adds a nice flavor, but I think that the recipe would be nearly as good without it.

This is the best butternut squash soup I have ever made! My six year old daughter and husband loved it! I followed the instructions exactly but didn't have any creme fraiche - think it would be the icing on the cake though, so will try next time.

@ actionpash That depends on how big your squashes are. Take them from the freezer and weigh them. Or estimate the weight from the size using the old saying  "a pint's a pound the world around"

this is glorious - and i don't even really love squash. we had a csa share this past summer and as our last pickup, received a TON of winter squash, so i roasted, scooped out pulp, and froze them, then chose a couple of soup recipes to make. when pureed and strained, this has the most velvety texture. the base of shallot, garlic, wine and white pepper is very rich and earthy. i could not get star anise, but it would be a lovely addition to this combination of flavors/aromas. (i skipped making the spice purse and just put the thyme, bay, and peppercorns in the soup directly. it was not too much trouble to retrieve them as i ladled out the soup to puree it.)

could anyone tell me about how many squash this would be? i have a bunch of already roasted and frozen squash in my freezer, dying to be made into a recipe like this, but i don't know how many pounds it was...
