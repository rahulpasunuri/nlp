I only made two changes - added bay leaves and a squeeze of lemon at the end. The sauce was amazing. Truly delicious. Problem was that the meat didn't tenderize to the level I would have preferred. Perhaps the cooking time is not long enough? That is the reason only 2 forks for me.

Absolutely outstanding!!!!! Cut the recipe in half since there are only two of us - but there was nothing left! Only changes I made were to add about 4 oz. of fresh mushrooms which I sauteed along with the onions plus adding about a tablespoon of crushed caraway seeds (an old family recipe for veal stew called for caraway). Super!! With boiling to reduce the liquid after adding the cream, there's no need for that nasty cornstarch or any other binder.

This is a fair veal stew, but isn't a blanquette de veau. "Blanquette" refers to the whiteness of the meat - it must not be browned at any stage of the process! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blanquette_de_veau

Regarding the other comments: this recipe is pretty perfect as is. DO NOT: add veal demi-glace. That is a cheap restaurant trick that makes every dish taste the same. This dish is supposed to be delicate. DO: serve over rice, add enough thyme, add enough lemon juice. To ensure that the veal was not overcooked, I drained the sauce to a skillet, added the cream, and reduced quickly. Then add that back into the pot. I agree with adding cognac or brandy. I didn't have any, so added 2 tbls. bourbon. Unorthodox, but made a big difference.

Easy and delicious. I followed the suggestion of one other cook who used a cornstarch slurry to thicken it up a bit at the end. It was a great suggestion. I also added in frozen pearl onions to the stew.

My wife bought some veal, and, being from France, I wanted to try a Blanquette. I liked this recipe because of its simple aspect. Other recipes, while appealing, took way too long. This recipe turned out great. I made a few adjustments. I added some brown mushrooms, quartered, then sauteed with the onion, and used Brandy to flambe. I then followed the recipe to the letter, except that I used some cornstarch at the end to make a slurry to thicken the sauce a bit. It was delicious, a total hit with the kids. Every little bit was gone! So much for left over for my lunch at work! Enjoy!

I have made this recipe several times over the years but usually without all the cream and butter because I thought we could survive using canola oil instead and half and half or even milk. Tonight I decided to use half butter and half canola oil, and go whole hog with the cream for the holidays--I admit it's even better with all that cream. I don't know how anyone can find this dish less than terrific. I lived in France for many years and this would definitely be a hit in most French kitchens. People need to relax a little about taking short cuts--terrific ingredients, an attentive cook, and a little time to simmer and the results are sure to be delicious. It's really tragic to be so snobby about food that you get upset if someone modernizes a recipe!

This was really tasty! I used a leeks in place of the onion (still added a little onion), put the carrots in at the beginning, added a couple of spoonfuls of Williams-Sonoma veal demi-glace (expensive but divine), and threw in some sliced mushrooms. The sauce was so rich I omitted the cream entirely - didn't need it.

Great tasting recipe - husband and all 3 kids loved it! Used buttermilk instead of whipping cream as didn't have it in fridge..still tasted great. Didn't have thyme so used tarragon instead, again came out fine. Sauce thickened up nicely and was great over rice! Will definitely make again. To those who thought it was too bland, make sure you season w/salt/pepper as instructed - it came out very flavorful..

I find it disappointing to see this shortcut and find the taste inferior to what a traditional blanquette would taste like. For the person with the tough meat, all stews must be simmered, not boiled, or else the meat comes out tough, dry and tasteless.

This is a very nice "base" recipe. Obviously, other reviewers have tweaked the recipe over the years. Following some of their advice, I doubled the thyme, added some sauteed mushrooms near the end, and added the lemon zest and juice before serving. It received raves (if only they knew how easy it is).

Tweaking this receipe is personal preference. I do not know what it tastes like in France but I use this receipe as a base for a very simple but tasty veal stew. I use veal strips not cubes. I like to add a variety of onions and some garlic. I also add herbs de provence and believe it or not a touch, just a touch of hot pepper as well as a small cabbage shredded towards the end. If you can get a veal base to mix with chicken broth (I buy it at Williams Sonoma but it is NOT cheap, but you don't need a lot and it stays) it adds depth to the dish.

Need help. Made this last week and used some suggestions from others, adding lemon zest and juice as well as mushrooms. A very tasty sauce for sure BUT the meat was so tough. Any suggetions.....hesitate to make for guests

This is the first stew recipe I tried from Epicurious, but I thought it was very good. I would offer the following suggestions: 1) I added more than 1/4 tsp thyme, more like 1/2 tsp, along with some basil and marjorem. 2) Since I was already using a Dutch oven, I stuck it in an oven at 275 instead of simmering, for better temperature control. 3) I used a 10-ounce pkg of pearl onions instead the one large onion, this worked well and the onions did not need browning. 4) Be sure the butter is hot, not just melted, before adding the veal, otherwise it won't brown well. 5) The consistency of the stew is very nice, it almost tastes like pot pie. Next time I will probably get some puff pastry and use this as filler.

I PREFER THE VERSION THAT USES LEEK, INSTEAD OF ONION AND DEGREASES THE SAUCE BEFORE ADDING THE WINE OR CREAM, WITH LEMON JUICE, ALTOGETHER MORE AUTHENTIC, ( I HAVE LIVED AND WORKED ALLOVER FRANCE AND VISIT EVERY YEAR)

Boring. Not bad, just not a complex blending of flavors. Even the kids (who have been to France and who love French food) thought it was dull. Perhaps the recipe could be improved with mushrooms or red wine or herbs de Provence (in place of Thyme). With all of the great recipes out there in the world, why would anyone make this more than once?

Loved this recipe- Made it less than 2 weeks ago,(did not add peas).Making it again tonite, however, will skip the cream. Sauce makes wonderful gravy over mashed potatoes.

A great family meal. I did not add the heavy cream. I used a tablespoon of reduced veal stock(purchaed at Chef Central) and only one can of chicken broth with some additional water and it was lovely. I was tempted to add mushrooms as others have suggested but my kids hate them. I did it over broad italian noodles and all loved it. I confess, I added garlic as we all adore garlic. I used two sprigs of fresh thyme instead of dried. Nice.

Fantastastic just as it is, next time I will add mushrooms, possibly shallots. The thyme is just a nice hint of herb not overwhelming. Sometimes simple is good, even great.

Delicious.(used mushrooms and pearl onions) Relatively easy to prepare. Even better the next day.

Very nice basic stew recipe. I added chopped portabellos, and used red wine instead of white to make the dis a little richer & heartier (besides we wanted red wine w/ dinner!). Served w/ wide egg noodles, sauted spinach on the side and a lovely VA barbara wine & it was a lovely fall meal.

I added the lemon & mushrooms. This dish is great, it's easy, & relatively quick. My 3 yr. & 15 month olds both loved it! They are big fans of veal, carrots & peas. Served with Organic brown rice, very nice!

Tried the dish again - this time I used pearl onions, lemon zest and juice of one lemon. Outstanding!

This was delicious! I didn't make any adjustments to this recipe, it didn't need a thing. I planned to add the lemon juice at the end like some other reviewers, but I tasted it and decided it didn't need it. This is a very rich and comforting dish. I would definitely add mushrooms next time. The thyme flavor in this dish would be a perfect match with mushrooms.

Traditional French cooking has some sort of acid involved I did not see any in this dish. you will need to add some sherry vin. to finish the sauce and also a pat of whole butter that will give it the love you desire.

I gave this two forks when it tasted like one fork because it was my fault. I used fresh, home-made chicken broth. The resulting blanquette was perfectly tender veal in a beautiful, creamy sauce that tasted like dish water. I had to get up from the table and place a salt shaker in front of my guests (I usually don't allow salt or pepper on the table) which they snapped up and subsequently emptied. Still, although I recognize that this dish should be subtle, and I know canned broth would have been saltier, I still think it would have lacked taste. Especially paired with butter white rice or noodles. More thyme? Tarragon? Lemon juice? Something.

I tried this recipe on the spur of the moment, not having all the ingredients required for the classic french recipe. My husband and I both liked it very much. I might add a few button mushrooms next time, but it was delicious as in the recipe. I served it over basmati rice. I will definitely make this again.

Easy and excellent - added wild mushrooms & lemon as previously suggested. Peas are key, and prefer this over egg noodles. Practically foolproof and even better the next day.

This was one of the best dishes I've made from this web site. I was going to make the other Blanquette de Veau recipe listed, but upon reading the reviews, decided to make this one instead. A very delicious stew, one I will definitely make again and again.

This dish tastes good, and was easy and QUICK to make, very important for me. I would change the cream to something less rich, maybe even homo milk. Served it the day after with bread (stopped cooking before adding peas), and it was great.
