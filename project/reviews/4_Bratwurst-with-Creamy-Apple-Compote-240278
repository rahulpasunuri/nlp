Great compliment to brats and fun change to the flavor profile. Plus easy.

Very good recipe. I followed it exactly as other reviewers had mentioned it was great as is and I agree. Easy and a different twist to serivng Bratwurst.

The four forks for this one are all for the compote, which is incredible. I live in London and this reminds me of the best gastropub dinners I've had around. Even though I cooked this in June, I can see how this would be an ideal dinner for a chilly autumn evening when you get home form work and just can barely be bothered to cook... the compote is that easy and it is just such good comfort food. Next time, I will put this compote on simple roast pork where I will have more control of the flavour: the bratwurst, while delicious, slightly overwhelmed the sauce for me. Anyway just such a winner, an Epicurious favorite!!

Great recipe, easy to make. I used a sweet pinot gris in the compote, and should have used a drier wine, as the sweetness altered the flavor. I will make this one again!

This deserves 4 forks for the ratio easy/delicious. It was a great success, and it came together so quickly. I used a granny smith for one of the apples as suggested. seved with red smashed potatoes with roasted garlic.

After reading the reviews, I decided to deviate from my norm and NOT "customize" the sauce recipe at all, and I'm glad I did, because the compote was utterly fantastic exactly as is. We had it over roasted-garlic chicken sausages instead of bratwurst, with roasted kiri squash on the side, and it was superb.

I can't speak to the split, browned bratwurst (I pan fried some Italian sausages instead -- not that big on bratwurst). But the apple compote is definitely a keeper! Dead easy, wonderful, doesn't take long to make. YUM!

Whata fabulous and easy recipe to make. The contrast of the bratwurst, apples and sauce is perfect. We served it with new potatoes and carrots fresh out of the garden. What a HIT! Would recommend you try soon.

Absolutely Delicious! I'll definitely make again, but will probably prepare with pork or a better meat.

This recipe was easy to make and was a huge hit at our house. We used vermouth for the wine, substituted a Granny Smith apple for one of the Golden Delicious and served it with green beans and peas amandine, which was a perfect side, and some new potatoes. My husband raved about the combination of taste, and said that this is now one of his all- time favorite recipes. Will definitely make it again!

Oh, was this goo-ood! I always have some "smart" comment about what I changed with Gourmet's recipe, but this one has silenced me. All I can say is "YUM!!"

The best! Used fresh sausages and steamed them first. So decadent with the creamy apple sauce! Used fiji apples and used the spiral peeler/slicer which worked fine and saved tons of time.

Easy work night meal. Compote is very tasty.

yum! easy and good.

Well, simple and easy, but not sensational. I found the bratwurst dry and sauce was just too much liquid. Nice flavour and maybe I should try again with a different sausage or chops as another suggested...

As in all recipes, especially one this simple, the quality of ingredients is all important. My bratwurst was puchased at my specialty meat market in the Denver area, Tony's, and it was very lean and perfectly seasoned. I followed the recipe exactly, except I had cooked the bratwurst earlier and frozen it so it just needed thawing and browning. It made a great fall weather dinner.

As with any recipe, especially one as simple as this, the quality of ingredients is all important. I made this because earlier my specialty meat market had a two-for-one sale on their bratwurst and I had cooked and then frozen half of it. I just had to lightly brown it after thawing it in the fridge. I followed the recipe exactly and it resulted in a perfect fall weather dinner that could not have been easier.

I thought this recipe was good, but not great. Perhaps from the previous reviews, I expected a bit more. Don't get me wrong, it was good, quick and very easy and I will make it again. It just didn't have quite the flavor I was expecting. I did use pre-cooked brats, but next time I think I'll try the uncooked brats per some previous reviewer comments.

Actually really liked it, as did my husband and sons. Added a Granny Smith to even out flavours - worked very well.

Rating: 4
Almost forgot. I used Granny Smith apples, which I think are just a bit more tart than Golden Delicious. The tartness of the Granny's and adding vinegar to taste (I'm not sure how much I used because I just poured from the bottle and checked for flavor) helped keep the compote from being too sweet.

I've never bothered to review a recipe before, but this was so good that I think others should know about it. As to the preparation of the brats, I thought about pan frying them too, but decided to try the broiler method given in the recipe. It was very easy and well worth having to watch them like a hawk to make sure they didn't burn up. The cut surfaces of the brats carmellized beautifully under the broiler and made a beautiful broad surface on which to heap the incredibly delicious compote. If you're lucky enough to be able to buy fresh brats, you should probably boil them first as suggested by the others.

This was awesome! Everyone raved. My mother-in-law is making it for herself when she gets home. Make sure to use fresh brats, as they have a much better flavor than pre-cooked. I boiled them first and then put them under the broiler. Otherwise made as directed. Yum!

This was wonderful, and even though it was so easy, my husband commented that it tasted like restaurant-quality food. I only had cheddar wurst on hand, but it was very nice in this recipe&next time though, Ill use plain bratwurst. I served it with sauerkraut on the side (it had been simmered in pork broth with a little bit of apple and onions) and that made a really nice contrast between the creamy, rich bratwurst and the tangy sauerkraut.

Really good, served with hard cider. I pan cooked the brats and used a red onion. All worked fine and everyone liked this recipe.

A really delicious, sweet & sour combination. Two apples seems inexact, though: they should be very big apples or you'll end up with a lot more liquid than you want. Definitely rich & heavy.

I just wasn't too impressed with this recipe. Would probably be a lot better if the apple compote was used on grilled pork chops or loin instead of the fatty brats. It was okay but nothing special. It was extremely easy and fast but I won't be making it again.

Absolutely, surprisingly delicious. It is a very heavy, sweet, satisfying winter dish. I would highly reccommend cooking a green side dish.

Rating: 4
This was super easy, and very fast. I didn't broil the brats, just browned them in a frying pan. The compote was delicious. The kids had the compote seperate, they had brat with ketchup, but liked the apples. This is cheap (about $5) and quickly fixed for a hungry family. We'll definitely eat this one again!

Awesome. Overcooked the compote slightly, still awesome. Will be making this again shortly.

Quite an interesting taste, the creamy-sweet-sour taste of the compote goes quite well with the bratwurst. I made it with dry apple cider instead of white wine. I couldn't eat large amounts of it, so I wonder if this would fit better as a side order.
