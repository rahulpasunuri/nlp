Flavors are good but I agree, it's hard to get the seasonings to stick to the nuts. I also found the butter, even halved per suggestions here, to be too oily & not to be a great addition to the flavor. Next time, I'd try using a method from another recipe: mixing the spices into egg whites and then using that to coat the nuts. Sticks much better.

The flavor was a little bland (not quite sweet enough, not quite salty enough), it was hard to coat evenly.

This recipe has potential, but we thought it was over-salted, and more on the soggy side rather than crunchy. I think I would try it again with way less salt, and way less butter. The other flavors work well with the nuts, though.

A nice variation on spiced nuts, but I had trouble getting the mixture to evenly coat the nuts - it ended up in gooey clumps. On the 2nd try, I melted 1 T of butter with all the ingredients except the sugar. I mixed the butter and nuts to evenly coat, then sprinkled in the sugar. I really like the herb-y flavor of the rosemary and the subtle sweetness of the cinnamon and sugar, so I would make them again.

These are tasty. I could not find raw unsalted nuts, so I picked up some lightly salted mixed nuts and omitted the salt in the recipe. However, there is too much butter. The nuts are rather oily. Next time, I'd try half the amount of butter.

These were fabulous! I too cut the butter nearly in half, and used a little less sugar. They were so good out of the oven when I prepared them, that I re-heated them when I served them a few days later with other Thanksgiving nibbles.

I doubled the rosemary and reduced the time and temperature after burning the first batch at 14 minutes and 375 degrees.

Delicious. Try this variation: Use dried Chipoltle instead of Cayenne and 2 T molasses instead of the brown sugar. Yummy.

A good party nut recipe.

Very good! I got a lot of compliments at the party I brought them to; however, a bit oily. I didn't use raw nuts, which may have been why. I kept a close eye on them in the oven to keep them from burning - temp at only 300, and checked every 5 minutes for a total of 15 minutes.

We made these for a pre-Thanksgiving dinner snack and our guests loved them. They were perhaps a bit too buttery, but otherwise delicious.

I made these nuts for a wine tasting event and they were the biggest hit of the night. All 2 cups were eaten and everyone wanted the recipe! I roasted the nuts using a different method: I heated the oven to 250 degrees and roasted them for about 70 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes. (I had used this method for crunchy pecans with 100% success, so I thought it would give me better control over burning.) They were wonderful!

Made these last Thanksgiving as a nosh with drinks and will do so again. Very easy and quite good.

Watch these carefully! I stirred after 7 minutes as directed (they looked great) but less than 4 minutes later there was smoke pouring out of my oven. Now they are very black, but not charred tasting -- I added lots more fresh salt and pepper and they might be ok for my holiday party this week -- but not what I wanted/ expected!

The herbed butter and sugar mixture smells so delicious I couldn't wait to eat the nuts! However, I found that the flavor wasn't as strong as the scent it creates when cooking. Also, the nuts lost their coating when baked in the oven which created savory brittles too salty to eat. But overall this is a recipe I would try again to perfect.

These were better the second day. Nice combination of sweet- savory flavors and super easy to prepare. I find little things like this, added to a bar for a holiday or party, make a big difference when entertaining.

Watch that the butter mixture doesn't burn in the oven. These are delicious.

Delicious!! I was initially hesitant about the cinnamon, but the taste was very subtle and worked great! I'll definitely make this again!
