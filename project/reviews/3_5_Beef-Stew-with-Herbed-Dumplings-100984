There is a strange symbol in front of the salt. I used half a teaspoon, but you should probably check this.

My fiance and I enjoy very different things. He enjoys a nice thick stew with dumplings, while I prefer to just skip adding cornstarch altogether and leave it as a nice rich soup. Regardless, this stew is quite tasty. I made it as stated at first, and it was fine, but I and everyone else in this household like things with a bit more kick to them, so I added things like peppers and cayenne. Gave it a nice touch.

POSSIBLE ERROR! It looks like a computer issue at this point, but the next-to-last ingredient is the salt for the dumplings. I THOUGHT it state 5 teaspoons (which is WAY too much...) now that I look at it closely it's some sort of weird typo. Whatever it's SUPPOSED to be, I can tell you that it should NOT be 5 teaspoons! Otherwise a swell recipe.

Excellent - the best beef stew I've ever made. Minded previous reviews, and : 1) used potatoes rather than rutabaga 2)cut the beef in 1/2. two pounds was plenty. Next time I will cut back on the tomatoes, since it was a little too much -or puree them to disguise (I used diced).

Rating: 4
Soooo tasty just as written. I do like veggies, so I usually put a little extra rutabagas and carrots. I skipped the dumplings because I've never had luck with dumplings in stew. The tomatoes really adds a lot to this recipe. I've made this recipe twice now and will be making it for a 3rd time tonight.

Not your typical beef stew recipe! I substituted russet potatoes for rutabagas and 1 cup of merlot for beef broth. Rave reviews from guests as the dumplings are also very impressive. Separate dumplings from stew when storing leftovers or they will soak up all the sauce!

Great recipe! I made a few modifications: I substituted one cup of broth for one cup of pinot noir, and I substituted fresh green beans and russet potatoes instead of carrot and rutabagas. I also added shiitake mushrooms during the last 20 minutes. I made the dumplings but I really didn't like them and ended up fishing them out of the stew. Despite using ultra-fresh chives and parsley from my garden the dumplings tasted like flour and baking powder. Bummer. All in all though this tasted great and I will definitely make it again.

I have made this stew recipe for years and have always been complimented on it. I have made it with and without the dumplings but always with potatoes rather than rutabega. Just my preference I guess. Have tried other stew recipes, but prefer this one. Making it right now and boy does my house smell good! Can't wait til suppertime.

holy holy holy moley this is one amazing stew! the timing for the meat to become so tender is spot on. Just because I'm like that, I made the following subs/additions: sub 1 C of merlot for 1C of broth, sub 1 parsnip and 1 turnip for 2 of the rutabagas, added crimini mushrooms and pearl onions to the veggie mix, and added approx 1 tblsp of chipotle chili powder in the last 1/2 hour of simmer. PERFECT!

A light, savory dumpling which was the perfect addition to Campbell's tomato soup. I skipped the stew recipe entirely for the dumplings and was very satisfied. Perfect as is, I will definitely make these again.

The dumplings turned out great, and I thought they added a lot to the stew. One substitution: I only had 4 cups of beef broth, so I reserved 1/2 cup for the dumplings (as written), and put 3 1/2 cups broth + 1 cup water + 1/2 cup red wine into the stew. I made this in a 7-quart dutch oven, which was the perfect size. It takes a really long time to make, but it's pretty straight forward - just plan to be home for awhile and do something else while it's in the oven.

Made this yesterday and it was absolutely delicious. House still smells good today! I didn't think the dumplings added much...it would have been maybe better to have some good italian or sourdough bread on the side to sop up the leftover sauce in the bowl. But, the dumplings were not bad...just didn't think they added much to the stew. Used rutabagas. Thought they were great. Did need to season with salt and pepper. Can't believe anyone would not like this! And the meat gets super tender. Followed the recipe exactly.

I made this stew almost exactly as the recipe suggests, and it came out greatm - very flavorful, not too thick, and the beef was practically falling apart. Our butcher trimmed a lot of the fat beforehand so I was using very lean cubes of chuck. I erred on the small side with my chopped carrots and potatoes, and that worked well - everything was tender but not mushy. I substituted white potatoes for the rutabagas since I couldn't find rutabagas, used 2 bay leaves instead of one, and I added about 3/4 cup of red wine during the second oven phase. Otherwise I followed the recipe to the letter - including the dumplings - and the result was delicious. It didn't specify what kind of onion so I used Vidalia, which kept it slightly sweeter. Having never cooked dumplings before, I wasn't sure what to expect in terms of consistency and flavor, and I was interested to learn that they are basically just like matzoh balls that you'd find in a regulation chicken stock matzoh ball soup! If you're looking for a flaky biscuit, or for a more Asian sensibility in your dumpling, don't make these, but if you're open to what amounts to a big herbed matzoh ball in the middle of your beef stew, these were a hit. Note that this recipe makes a TON of stew. It filled my 7-quart pot to the brim once the dumplings were added.

The dumplings in this dish are simply delicious. I've even started using it in other dishes such as chicken and dumplings. The dish itself is good, but I had to cook it longer to get the beef tender. Also, it may be too many carrots, which made it somewhat too sweet for my taste.

BE WARNED! Dumplings we're horrible and ruined the whole dish. I've made dumplins. I had a feeling the batter was to lose and it was. It made the whole stew have this horrible consistency. I was wondering almost all the reviews said they didn't make the dumplings and know I know why.

This is hands down the best stew I have made! I didn't bother with the dumplings though I am sure they would be tasty as well. I prepared this as a special treat for my husband since I don't eat beef or pork and rarely cook either one. We were having a group of about 10 friends over so I doubled the recipe. This probably was not necessary because this makes A LOT of stew. I received rave review from everyone and I will admit that even I found myself enjoying a bowl!

Made stew this afternoon. Although I could incense the purist who believe reviews should only be submitted if recipe is followed exactly, I made some changes (due to ingredients on hand). Had some leftover Chorizo which I threw in along w/ potatoes instead of rutabaga. As a stew, it was pretty good. Nothing spectacular. Also threw in some Newcastle, can't have a stew w/o beer or wine imo. May make again.

Nice staple when you're looking for winter comfort food! I also used potatoes instead of rutabagas and threw in some petite peas. The dumplings were a nice change of pace. Simmered the entire pot for a few hours... why bother putting this dish in the oven when a slow braise over low heat accomplishes the same thing? It makes a LOT. I halved the recipe and will be having leftovers for the week.

Oh, yum, yum, yum and double yum. I substituted chicken for the beef, avocados for the rutabaga, and 7-up for the beef broth. Also, instead of onions, I simply chopped off the toes of my control-top pantyhose and added those. My hubby went hog wild, and I mean HOG WILD over this recipe which we later used to soak our dentures in. Would definetly make this over and over again, maybe next time making the dumplings with gummi bears.

Oh YUM! My husband and I both loved this stew - and he's a tough judge. I used 6 slices of bacon instead of just 4, b/c I love bacon. I also used Bisquick for the dumplings (w/ the herbs). The stew was rich, and so flavorful. Definitely a winter comfort food favorite!

I didn't have the bacon so I left it out, used sage istead of thyme and 28 oz. whole tomatoes and a large box of vegetable broth -- it was still great! This time I will make it without the dumplings - I thought they were a little too dense and chewy the first time I made it.

Here is a wonderful tip about dumplings that my mother taught me: use refridgerated biscuit dough.Simply roll out the biscuits as flat as you are able, and then tear them into manageable-sized pieces as you throw them on top of the broth. I thought this recipe was delicious- I also added wine and mushrooms. Definitely something I'll make again.

Delicious stew recipe. I exchanged potatoes (all I had) for the rutabagas. I used 4 cups of beef broth and 1.5 cups of red wine. After browning the meat and onions, I placed everything in the crock pot for 6 hours - turned out great. I'll try the dumplings next time.

I confess I didn't even try to make the dumplings. Not owning the right type of oven & stove top-proof pot I had to improvise and used a large skillet to brown the beef & cook the bacon, etc. Necessity really is the mother of invention since this meant I had to deglaze the pan with some red wine to preserve all the lovely browned bits and this added a great flavor to the stew. I went a little nuts on the bacon - we don't make it much so rather than toss most of a package of bacon in a week or so I cooked the whole package, drained most of the fat from the pan and crumbled 4-5 pieces for the stew but the browned bits left from cooking a lb. of bacon left a distinctly bacony flavor to he stew. Which was not bad, actually... the rest was mostly to the recipe. Lovely.

After reading the challenges and unreliability of the dumplings, I used Bisquick. Follow the recipe on the box and add the herbs. I've always used Bisquick for my dumplings and it saves time too. Stew was good but standard. Next time I'll soak/drain/chop dried porcini mushrooms and add to stew. Also will add a splash of red wine after the dumplings are cooked and removed to give a hearty flavor.

This was delicious! This is the first beef stew I've ever made, and everyone agreed there is no need to try another recipe! The only caveat is how long it takes to prepare - I didn't add it up ahead of time and it took about 3 hours. In particular, browning the meat took about 45 minutes. Next time I would use 2 skillets and cut the time in half.

I made this almost exactly as directed, and it was fantastic. The dumplings came out light, flavorful and fluffy and were very easy to make. Those who had lesser results may have been using something other than whole milk, which, ironically, contributes to the lightness of the dumpling because the fat in the milk melts out of the dough and leaves air pockets. Other causes for disappointing dumplings can be old baking powder or using too little salt, which plays a role in the leavening process. There is a garble in the ingredient list for this recipe so the amount of salt cannot be read; it should be 1/2 teaspoon. Another possible cause of doughy dumplings is cooking them over boiling, instead of simmering, stew. Phew! Finally, don't give in to rutabega-phobia. They are great! I never knowingly ate one until I made this stew, and I wish I had discovered them years ago.

The stew was really good. Followed recipe exactly except used turkey bacon. The dumplings, however, are VERY dense. I didn't have whole milk so I used half cream and half 1% - could that have done it? Anyway, I'll make the stew again, but without the dumplings, maybe just some yummy bread.

3 1/2 forks. Took others' advice and added some worchestershire and mushrooms to saute, subbed potatoes for Ruts, replaced 1/2 c broth with red wine, and, as always, added extra garlic and used fresh parsley, thyme and dill in the stew. Did not make dumplings (I was supposed to be working while I cooked most of it) and just served with a crusty loaf of bread to soak up the FANTASTIC sauce. Mom, dad and boyfriend loved it (picky mom kept asking what smelled so good and snitching from the pot)! I'll be making this all winter. * Used just under 3 lbs beef and increased carrots and potatoes, still plenty of meat, might even use less next time. My lid wasn't overproof, so I simmered for 2 hours on stovetop, uncovered and cooked for 2 hours at 325, then returned to stovetop for 45 minutes and thickened with butter/flour mixture.

This was a average beef stew recipe. Was looking for a varation for dumplings which were o.k. Used chicken broth not beef broth. Most stew recipies use the chicken broth. I used 2 cups of broth with 1C. red Zinfandel. Forget the bacon, used olive oil to reduce fat.

The stew is a simple, classic stew as are the extremely old-fashioned, Northern-style dumplings - rich, tender, light and fluffy, without that gaggy Bisquick aftertaste, or filled with Pillsbury hydrogenated-oils.

This beef stew is delicious. I halved the recipe since I was making it just for my husband and me. I substituted potatoes for the rutabagas because the grocery store didn't have them, and I doubled the carrots and the tomato puree. We made the dumplings and loved them. I added a bit more salt and some pepper to the dumplings to make them more savory. Perhaps too little salt and no pepper is what made the other reviewers think they were bland. The gravy was delicious (bacon is such a nice addition) and the meat was very tender. I served it with a dollop of sour cream on the side and fresh parsley sprinkled on the top. Delish!

The stew was delicious and pretty easy to prepare. I omitted the dumplings and substituted potatoes for the rutabagas.

This stew is outstanding. I made the dumplings the first time, but I don't think they're worth the effort so now I (like others) just serve with crusty bread. I use parsnips instead of rutabegas.

I just finised two helpings of this stew, and I regret I can't give it 5 forks. We read the reviews while we were enjoying our meal; I made the recipe just as written, and it it marvelous! I didn't substitute potatoes for the rutabagas, nor did I substitute salmon for the beef!

I like my stew with more vegtables and more zip. Therefore, I added mushrooms, celery and red peppers to the recipe in addition to worcestershire sauce, red wine and chili sauce, all to taste. I also did not include the bacon, as my wife is not a bacon fan. With the additions, I enjoyed the stew and would make it again, but with my additions. Also, I did not make the dumplings, but rather served the stew with homemade bread.

This stew was lovely (I LIKED the dumplings) --from the first carrot I taste-tasted to the after-dinner kiss.

My husband and my five sons thought this was best stew ever. I didn't bother with the dumplings since the reviews were bad. I served corn bread instead.

I decided at 4:00 that I wanted to have this for dinner at 6. So I used my convection oven, which cut about 45 minutes off the cooking time and it still came out fantastic! I used potatoes instead of rutabagas. Kids loved it. My husband had thirds, then took it for lunch the next day! I did also think that the dumplings were a bit bland but they're still great for soaking up all the leftover stew-y stuff in the bottom of the bowl.

This was a keeper. My family does not as a rule like stew, this they loved!!! I threw some portebello mushrooms into the stew. The dumplings were perhaps a little bland.

This is a Fantastic meal! I have made this twice now, the first time my husband grumped because he "doesn't like stew", he had 2 helpings and ate more for lunch the next day. The flavors are great and it is fairly easy to put together.

Great winter beef stew recipe. The meat comes out soooo tender. I used potatoes instead of rutabagas and canned whole tomatoes instead of the tomatoes w/ puree. Did not make the dumplings but served with crusty bread. Delicious.

Simply delicious. I've never been a big fan of beef stew, but I have kept looking for one I would like. Well, this is it. The beef was very tender and tasty. I could not find rutabagas, so I did substitute potatoes, and I also added quartered mushrooms very near to the end. My oven would not accommodate my stew pot, so I cooked it slowly on the stovetop instead. The dumplings turned out well, but I didn't think they had much flavor, so I might skip them in the future or modify the recipe in some way. They looked pretty but were fairly bland. This definitely goes into my winter meals repertoire.

I did not have a pot suitable for putting in the oven so I hade to make this stove top. It was a good comfort food. The beef was tender. I used buttermilk in the dumplings instead of whole milk. Makes a better dumpling in my opinion. I put sectioned Portabello mushrooms in a little bit before the dumplings.

The amount of salt is a bit screwey on this page. Anyway, to the previous reviewer, I looked it up in the magazine, and it is 1/2 teaspoon of salt.

This was a tasty recipe. I love anything braised. It was easy, althought time consuming. I'll make it again on a cold weekend, when I have a lot of time.

My husband absolutely loved this recipe. It's easy and very tasty. I recommend eating it the first day made, as the leftovers became very dry. The flavors were great and the smells in the kitchen are even better.

I made this recipe for Easter dinner. It was a big hit with my family. Everything was very tasty. The rutabagas added a very nice flavor. Please, don't leave out the dumplings. They added a nice texture and made a nice presentation. Also, the portions served alot more then 6 servings. Closer to 12.

I made this a three fork because I would not make the dumplings again and I would add more meat next time. The flavor was great and the meat very tender, just not enough meat for the amount of sauce.

I was never a big stew lover, but my husband is. So when I saw this recipe, I thought I would give it a try. It was wonderful! Maybe just a tad bland, but I am going to try adding wine and see if that perks it up. Overall it was great! Never made dumplings before and they were a great addition!!! And incredibly easy!! It

This was my first time making stew and it was great. My Dad and boyfriend loved it. I added some peas and carrots as well. The dumplings can be left out. Not alot of taste. Freeze this and you'll have a great meal of leftovers.

This stew has an incredibly rich flavour and texture.

An excellent dish. I agree with the others. This would be better with half the rutabaga and an addition of potatoes. I added some wine which added a richer flavor. The dumplings were a bit bland. Buttered French bread would be a lot nicer, though maybe not as attracive.

Great recipe...it's a keeper. The pea salad that goes with it in the magazine is excellent as well. Don't hesitate to make this one. Make sure you make the dumplings...they really add.

I thought the best quality of this recipe was the exceptionally tender meat. The overall taste was very good but not outstanding. It needs to be "kicked up a notch". Next time I'll take the suggestion of the previous reviewers and add wine. I could not find rutabagas so I used potatoes instead with good results.

This was absolutely wonderful. The stew had a wonderful flavor and after the prolonged cooking, the meat was tender enough to cut with a fork. I wouldn't bother with the dumplings though and serve the stew with a nice french bread instead.

Terrific and impressive. I have never made dumplings before, so I was a bit nervous that they wouldn't turn out. But they were so light, all my guests were commenting how they weren't heavy or doughy at all. I did add two cups of burgundy wine. Also, the online recipe does not specify how much salt to put in the dumplings. All I can say is -- one teaspoon is a bit too much! The dumplings were a tad salty; next time, I'll only use 1/2 or 3/4 teaspoon of salt. Other than that (and I was the only one who really noticed it), everyone loved this!

Made this recipe as written - wouldn't change a thing! Seems strange not to be putting potatoes in a stew but it works.

I too, was not a childhood fan of beef stew. My husband loves it, but I rarely cooked it for him, until I read this recipe and the comments and gave it a try. It was very good. I added potatoes instead of the rutabagas(I'll try those next time) This recipe is a keeper!

I hated beef stew as a child -- the beef always seemed tough and stringy, and I wasn't much for vegetables back then -- but I started craving it recently for some odd reason! Printed this recipe off and made it (sans dumplings, and substituted potatoes for rutabagas), and ADORED the results. I've never had anything nearly as good, and my husband thought I had turned into Julia Child. A bottle of merlot, a loaf of fresh homemade wheat bread, and a bowl of this oh-so-tender stew and we were set for a lovely winter's evening! Will definitely be making this stew again, without any ingredient changes -- it's rare that I make something exactly the same way twice in a row, so that's quite a compliment!

I doubled this recipe with no problem for a large group. I skipped the dumplings and added a bit more of the vegetables. Hint: make this a day ahead and let it sit in your refrigerator. The tastes combine much better. With a lack of wine for seasoning the beef, this is pretty important. Great recipe!

This stew has everything- great flavor & very visually appealing. But since I didn't have 5 cups of beef broth, I substitutied Knorr french onion soup (made according to the box) for the liquid, and omitted the onions from the recipe. It turned out great- lots of depth of flavor. Also, I skipped the dumplings- but if you do that beware- don't skip the cornstarch step near the end. It looks like part of the dumpling recipe, but it's part of the stew recipe! Overall great results.

This was delicious!! My boyfriend had never even heard of dumplings before. He was quite impressed. I would definitely add the peas and potatoes to my next batch!! So yummy!

Rutabagas were an undiscovered treasure for me. And the dumplings were unusual

Rating: 4
This is a great recipe. I found that this was very easy to make it was just time consuming during the cooking process. You have to be home for about 3 hours to make this dish, but its well worth the wait. Its even better the next day. I also added more vegetables (potatoes and peas) and cooked it on the stovetop. Only next time I would leave out the dumplings, they didn't impress my husband and I. They came out bland. You wont miss them if you leave them out. Great in the winter, and it freezes well.

My husband described it as "exquisite" -- have you ever heard someone describe a stew as being exquisite? That's how good this is. I added potatoes, couldn't find rutabegas, and substituted finely chopped green onion for the chives in the dumplings. Still fabulous.

This is a totally awesome dish. I've made it for many friends, and they have raved about it. My children ask for frequently and fight over the leftovers. It is time consuming to make, but the results are worth it.

Great stew. I added 1 cup of cabernet savingnon with the broth. Also, added some quartered potatoes. Easy, tasty and definately feeds at least 8 adults. We loved it.

One word...FABULOUS! I look forward to serving this to guests. It takes some time to prepare but well worth it! Served with a fresh salad and a rich red wine, you have yourself a winner! I did not find rutabaga in my market, so I substituded turnip and it tasted wonderful. I also cooked the whole recipe stovetop and it was great.

Wonderful flavors. The dumplings made it better than other stews. I did the whole thing on the stove top the way that I have with other stews. Worked fine.

The dumplings are fantastic, very light and the stew itself very tasty. Made the dish for my Brother, who never would have eaten stew, he thought it was fantastic.
