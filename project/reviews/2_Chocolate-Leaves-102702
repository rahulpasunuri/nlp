The hardest part of this recipe was finding the non-poisonous leaves. Luckily, a friend has a camellia shrub and she brought me some leaves. They were surprisingly easy to make. Be sure to put on a thick coat of chocolate--otherwise, they're too thin to peel. Also, I recommend when peeling the leaves off the chocolate, take only one leaf at a time out of the refrigerator--they start to soften and get gooey almost immediately.
