I love this recipe. It is easy, tastes good and is healthy. If you can bear to leave out the caramel, each serving has 94 calories and 99% of your USRDA of vitamin A (plus a little calcium, iron, and vitamin C). (With the caramel, it has 180 calories per serving).

This flan is a Thanksgiving standard at my house. I like to boil the sugar to dark dark brown because the bitter of the sauce and the sweet of the pudding is superb.

I was looking for a recipe to use the pie pumpkin that we had, and this was great - I hadn't made caramel in many years, and burned it (and my hand) a bit, but it was worth it. Actually an easy recipe, once you just relax, the caramel will finally work. Love all the other suggestions from other cooks- will try them with the next batch!

I made this exactly as the recipe called for and it turned out great! Initially I thought it might not be as silky when using a lower fat milk, but I wanted to try it with the 1% I had on hand. I will always use the 1% in the future, as it tastes so good and I'm always looking for low fat recipes that taste great. The only way that I waivered from the instructions, was that I did not chill it for 8 hours before eating. I only waited 15 minutes.

Was just okay, I don't think I'll make it again. The texture was more like pumpkin pie filling, wasn't smooth and silky enough to be a flan. It could also be a little more sweet and have a little less pumpkin taste.

I've made this several times. Yum! It is more healthy than traditional pumpkin pie (with no crust...) I added pumpkin pie spice to give it more of a kick. Try brown sugar for the caramel.

This tasted like the filling of a pumpkin pie only without the crust. I do have to admit that this has too much pumpkin for a flan. I don't think I'll ever make a pumpkin flan but will use this recipe for a pumpkin pie filling.

A little to sweet for me, will cut back on the sugar next time, but we loved it, I did not have allspice but I used pumkin spice and it was fine.

The flan was good but had too much pumpkin flavor for my taste...

Fabulous!! Creamy and delightful. A welcome change for the holidays. I plan to make this every year for Thanksgiving and maybe even in between.

Excellent presentation--served with sugared cranberries! Everyone said they loved it, but I think it needed a little more sugar. Perfect dessert for AROUND Christmas or Thanksgiving, but not for the actual dinner.

Great recipe. Be patient making the caramel. It does take time. I nearly thought I screwed up, but I waited it out. It's a keeper.

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this variation of flan. I made one change in the recipe due to lack of an ingredient. I substituted brown sugar in both places of the recipe and I felt it actually made the taste even better. I will definitely make this one again. The texture was soft and lovely and the flavor goes well with a spicy meal.

This dessert is wonderful! A huge improvement on the standard caramel custard. Easy to make and it especially impressed my daughter.

I completely disagree with the previous review. I have made this for Thanksgiving dinner for the past five years and everyone raves about its creamy smooth texture and wonderfully light taste. The dessert always has a place of honor on our holiday table. I sometimes serve it with a bit of heavy cream flavoured with a good brandy.

Yummy but not scrumptious! The texture was not smooth and the flavor not exactly outstanding.
