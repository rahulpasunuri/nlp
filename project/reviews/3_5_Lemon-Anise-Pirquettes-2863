I make these every year when I do my Xmas baking, and have since I saw them in B.A. in 1990. LOVE THEM! Lite, refreshing & crispy. Found them very easy to make, although they do take a little time. Look very impressive. I put them in Ziplocs this year, and they got soft - I think they need to be left in the air, just eaten in a couple days to enjoy the texture.

What an ordeal!! These cookies are interesting, but certainly not worth the effort. If you're going to try it, make sure you have excellent cookie sheets or a silpat. And work quickly!

These cookies have been a Christmas standard of mine since 1990 when I used to subscribe to Bon Apetit magazine. (Thank you epicurious.com for archiving so many wonderful recipes because I seem to have misplaced my dog-eared copy of the 1990 Holiday issue and I'm oh so grateful to have found this recipe online.) Making them is truly a labor of love and all who taste them will be impressed by their taste and their shape. My suggestions for making these cookies? First, if using a food processor, pulverize the fennel and anisee first before adding them to the dry mixture. Second, make only four cookies at a time as you have to roll them while hot and more than four cookies will take too much time. Enjoy!
