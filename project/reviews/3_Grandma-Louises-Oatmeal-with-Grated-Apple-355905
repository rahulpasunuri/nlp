3 1/2 forks? Really? This is the most boring, insipid oatmeal I have ever tasted! (except maybe it was similar to the ones I made as a kid). I don't know if it's because I don't know what "old-fashioned oats" are and probably used "quick-cooking" oats (I usually use steel-cut, but the short cooking time of this recipe suggests not to). I could not taste the apple at all. I will go back to chopping them. Only the sucanat I put on top was rescuing it with some flavour, and then I remembered to get some raisins, and then cinnamon (how was this left out?) and it was fine. The texture was good. My husband said he liked it (simple base, add your own toppings) as opposed to my usual super-oatmeal that's full of nuts, seeds, and all kinds of omega-3 goodness. Well, I suppose tastes differ. I'll probably make it again for his sake, when I'm short on time.

Seriously delicious. I'll make it again and again. As advised by other reviewers, I reduced the water and used 2 cups. I used old-fashioned rolled oats (not steel-cut) and a granny smith apple. I substituted almond milk for the whole milk because of a dairy allergy. I cannot imagine how this would taste without the lemon juice. It added a little bite and a zing to the taste of the apple that was perfect. Don't leave it out! It cuts the creamy, gooiness of the cooked oatmeal and creates a good balance. The only negative about this recipe is that it didn't make nearly enough for my family of four who LOVED it! I was asked to make more right away.

Even my husband, who is not a fan of oatmeal enjoyed this. I added cinnamon and vanilla and left out the lemon juice. Next time, i will take another reviewers advice and try with Granny Smith for a stronger apple flavour and add the lemon juice.

I also noticed the high amount of water and reduced it to my liking. I would suggest mixing the lemon juice with the grated apples to preserve them for a moment before mixing them with the oatmeal.

Update to my review: I have since made this with a Granny Smith apple and it its great! This oatmeal is so easy to heat up the next day by heating it up in a double boiler. It is now my standard oatmeal recipe.

We enjoyed this recipe, but I must agree with another reviewer that the oatmeal comes out a bit watery. I used a Honey Crisp apple and will experiment with other, less juicy apples too. My other family members thought the consistency was fine. I will make this again and tweak it to my likings.

I've made this recipe four or five times, and I've found that it is much more to my liking when I leave out the lemon juice. It's like a different dish without it. I like to top it with brown sugar and dried cranberries for extra flavor. Also, I substituted asian pair for the apple just this morning and it was very nice.

I was moderately pleased with this recipe. The oatmeal was a touch watery, however, and not the best I've ever had.
