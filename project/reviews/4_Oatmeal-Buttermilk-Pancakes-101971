Gluten free option... We love these pancakes. I substitute the flour for fresh ground flax and mix all the ingredients except the eggs and vanilla a day or more ahead of time and refrigerate it in glass or plastic. On the morning we're going to have them for breakfast, I add the two large eggs and vanilla, then slowly add in the melted butter. They are a hit with friends and family... great with homemade jams, hazelnut butter, fresh ground peanut butter or almond butter, or of course, real maple syrup. Enjoy!

I made these a little differently, I used soured raw milk instead of buttermilk, and I think it was a little thinner than buttermilk so I ended up needing a bit more flour because the batter was too thin. I also let it sit overnight instead of just two hours. But these pancakes were awsome! Usually when I make 'whole grain" pancakes they dont taste good, they taste...healthy. So we loved them, had them with homemade blueberry syrup :)

These should be called "fried oatmeal". I let the batter rest overnight and when I saw how thick it was in the morning I chickened out and added an extra half cup of buttermilk before making the pancakes, which was a mistake. They probably would have been better had I not done that. However, I will not throw away my wonderful buttermilk on this recipe again... if I want oatmeal, I'll just make it the old fashioned way, with steel cut oats and a saucepan.

Fantastic! I normally don't like pancakes as much as I do crêpes or french toast, but after preparing this recipe my opinion has definitely changed. The texture and flavours are wonderful, and unlike regular pancakes, while substantial, they don't land in your stomach with an oppressive thunk. I suspect this has something to do with the bulk of the grain content coming from rolled oats instead of ground flour, and the fact that they only take two eggs (significantly less than all other recipes I have tried). I actually did not read the recipe as thoroughly as I should have, so I missed the part about the two hour resting period. Since it was well into brunch time and everyone was hungry, I let the batter rest for 30 minutes, and I was able to easily salvage the situation. When cooking the pancakes I kept them over very low heat for at least 4-5 minutes per side to ensure they would be stable enough to flip and that they would be evenly cooked throughout. I also used a non-stick pan and a very large spatula for flipping. Though still fragile, this worked well and they tasted superb. As for the topping, I had some overly ripe pears and a few apples in the fridge, so I made a compote with these instead. I also skipped the whipping cream, I'm sure it would be tasty, but we didn't miss it all. I'm looking forward to trying this the correct way and letting the batter sit overnight!

Best pancakes hands down. I added semi-sweet chocolate mini-morsels and they were delish!

I wish reviewers would specify what type of oats they are using for this recipe. I bought my first can of John McCann's Irish oatmeal, and am loving it in this recipe. I'm sure the pancakes are denser/etc, but I'm loving it. I've never had such substantial pancakes, but color me a fan now. I've also never bought real maple syrup until now, but wow, that's got to be a factor here. Great recipe, highly recommended.

I make these gluten free. I use certified gluten free oats (like Bob's Red Mill certified GF oats) and an off the shelf gluten free flour blend like King Arthur's gluten free flour. I don't think there's any reason plain rice flour wouldn't work too, since there's only a half cup of flour in the recipe. I'm feeding the (seemingly) pickiest toddler on the planet, so I add a couple tablespoons of flax meal and a pureed can of pears or other fruit to the batter to add a little extra nutrition/fiber. Make a batch, freeze leftover cooked pancakes, and reheat in the toaster oven for weekday breakfasts. They come out great.

I love this recipe, but I was wondering if anyone had figured out a way to make it gluten-free? For example, has anyone substituted the flour for a gluten-free one, such as rice flour? I have two guests coming to my home for brunch who have Celiac's disease. Thank you, Epicurious community!

Perfect Sunday morning breakfast. Other toppings (if you don't have lingonberry preserves on hand) include a sprinkling of cinnamon and some toasted pecans. I mixed all of the dry ingredients the day before, which made prep time a cinch.

This became an immediate family favorite. I toasted the oats lightly over medium heat to give them a nutty flavor. I also used a combination of fresh milk and sour cream as I did not have any buttermilk. I think these work best as a savory pancake, like a potato pancake. They were great with sour cream and applesauce.

So tasty. I cooked them on a griddle with raw virgin coconut oil and the subtle flavor really went nicely with the pancakes.

These are the only pancakes I make, they are so good. I always make them the night before and they also freeze beautifully!!

Rating: 4
These are simply THE best pancakes ever. It essential to let the batter sit overnight, since this lets the moisture soak into the oats, resulting in less of an "oaty" texture. I use canola oil in place of the butter. Unlike most pancakes, which lose their interest after a couple of bites, you could 10 of these and not get tired of them! Try adding thinly sliced apples to the batter and serving with butter and honey...mmmmm.

Rating: 0
I serve these at my bed and breakfast and it is my most requested recipe. I use Bulgarian buttermilk (not lowfat) and make the batter the night before. No need to pulverize the oats. Don't thin them too much or they will be mushy and take much longer to cook.

Rating: 4
Many compliments on this one.. some said they were the best pancakes they'd ever had. I added extra buttermilk to thin them out, but they were still very dense. I had to cook them for an extra long time to make sure they weren't undercooked.

Rating: 3
I reduced the sugar to 1 tablespoon, substituted canola oil for the butter, and added a pint of fresh blueberries to the batter. They have a wonderful flavor and made my house smell delicious! The only problems were that the batter was difficult to spread in the pan (thanks to the oats) and the insides of the cooked pancakes were gummy (even after the batter sat for 3 days in my refrigerator because I kept being disrupted from cooking them). Next time I make these, and I definitely will, I'll pulverize the oats like others have suggested; hopefully that will resolve both of the problems I encountered. Yum!

These are a family favorite. I use fresh or frozen blackberries or cranberries. I place three or four on each pancake. The tartness of the fruit it the perfect counterpoint to the sweetness of the pancake and the maple syrup.

These pancakes are absolutley exceptional! I always like to add a little bit of cinnamon and nutmeg for extra flavour. However, if you're pressed for time, save it for another day! Don't try and skip the 2 hour batter-thickening period, its very imporant....I learned that the hard way. It let's the oats become softer, so that they cook properly. If you skip it, you get chewy undercooked pancakes!The pancakes also take a long time to cook, but it's worth it! With a little bit of maple butter, definetley my favorite breakfast.

Rating: 4
These are the only pancakes we make any more. Incredible! We put the dry ingredients in bags so that a quick addition of the wet ingredients the night before and you're good to go for cooking them up the next morning. Perfect for serving overnight guests. We add the dried blueberrys from Trader Joes sometimes. They're just dried enough not to create that blueberry mess, but still moist enough to match the moistness of these wonderful pancakes.

I made the following changes: heated buttermilk w/oatmeal, added 1+teas cinn, reduced it to 1.5 teas sugar, added 3 mashed bananas, added 1/4 cup of walnuts. they were delicious! perhaps a little mushy but i blame the bananas.

Exceptional recipe. My picky eaters love this (age 3 and 6). The 3- year-old won't touch oatmeal save for this recipe. My husband often requests this breakfast over regular buttermilk pancakes. You will be pleased with this recipe the first time making it. Resting time is essential, and they do freeze exceptionally well. Do go easy with the 1/4 c. of batter for each pancake and the heat, as they do take a bit to cook at the low temp. Higher temps or too much better will yield a gummy pancake in the middle. What a treat! Freeze great. I make double batches on the weekend for special treat hearty weekday breakfasts.

Very yummy & a different twist with the oatmeal texture to the usual pancake. I found mine cooked too quickly on the outside & were a bit mushy inside, but probably just my heat was too high. Very good.

Rating: 4
Delicious! May I present my annoying changes! ;) Buckwheat flour for all-purpose, halved butter. No buttermilk so 4/3c milk with lemon juice, 2/3c non-fat yog, 1/2c water, in which I cooked the oats. Whipped egg and sugar until fluffy, sifted in other dry stuff, then beat in hot oatmeal. This thickened without the long standing time, and could be good if yours turned out raw or gummy. Very filling, but incredibly light and fluffy. I didn't have vanilla, but still found these a bit too sweet eaten plain without syrup. The Lingonberry would have balanced this, but we just moved, so I think we already bolstered Ikea's profits enough for one month! :p I'll make a tart berry compote for these beauties next time!

Rating: 4
These are fabulous. No need to prepare the batter hours ahead. I pulverized quick-oats in my Oskar, used only 2 Tbs. sugar (will use 1 1/2 Tbs. next time-the vanilla adds a nice sweetness)and canola oil instead of butter. Set my electric griddle on 325, and cooked the pancakes 3 minutes per side. No need to butter the griddle. Pancakes were light, wonderful, not sticky and cooked through. This will be our new recipe. Makes 10 6" pancakes.

I made thse pancakes a few days ago and they truly are wonderful !! Have a few of these pancakes and I guarantee you won't be hungry until 3:00pm. To make them a little more healthier, I: 1) substituted half of the white flour for whole wheat, 2) substituted 1% cultured buttermilk for the straight stuff, and 3) added about 1/2 cup of crushed pecans (any favorite nut will work) Try not to make the mistake I made by putting too much batter on the skillet or they'll get too cumbersome to flip. They freeze quite well, as I found out this morning.

Rating: 4
These pancakes are REALLY good! However, I rarely remember to make anything the night before, so instead I heat the buttermilk, grind the oats, and combine the two. Let that sit maybe 15-20 minutes, and you're ready to go. They're not light, but they sure are good.

By far, our top family pancake recipe!! Make the evening before...also freezes well for quick weekday breakfasts.

A suggestion for the cooks who thought the pancakes were gummy: I pulverized the oats and flour (whole-wheat, plus 1/4 cup wheat germ) in a food processor, then added buttermilk, sugar, salt, and vanilla. The next morning I added baking powder, baking soda, egg yolks, and folded in egg whites beaten until stiff. It was much easier to flip the pancakes, and my husband swooned that the pancakes "melted in his mouth". We have enjoyed the recipe as printed many times, but we love oatmeal, so undercooked and gummy doesn't bother us.

Rating: 3
Great recipe. Maybe I would cut back on the butter in the batter, but the consistency is very good, very tasty.

This recipe is a weekend favorite. If you don't have buttermilk you can substitute a combination of yogurt & milk. You also don't have to wait 2 hours- instead place the mixing bowl in the microwave for 2 minutes- achieves the same result. Great served with yogurt & applesauce.

Rating: 2
This was tasty, but a horrible pain in the neck to flip over and maintain shape. Sweet, so syrup is optional. Good, delicate texture (I used McCann's Quick Cooking oats and encountered no heaviness at all). Batter held up well in the fridge overnight, and even into a second day. Adults enjoyed these, but oddly enough kids did not, even with the sweet flavour.

Rating: 4
These were fabulous! The perfect combination of oats and pancakes! We cut the recipe in half, and it was perfect for two people, and served them with raspberries, strawberries and maple syrup. They are so easy when prepared the night before, and we liked the recipe as it's written, although it would be nice with a few spices or nuts mixed in for something different. We didn't have a problem with them being gummy or too thick. We just stirred them in the morning, and spooned them onto the pan. Great recipe!

Rating: 4
Never before have my kids asked for seconds of any other pancakes. These can be quickly thrown together at night, and cooked up in the morning. A few minutes out of the fridge to warm up and the batter is the right consistency. They are sooo much healthier than traditional pancakes. I also use half whole wheat flour, half white. This is definelty my mainstay pancake.

Rating: 3
I really like these and have been making them almost every weekend. I didn't find them gummy at all. When I want to max out on the nutrition I use whole wheat flour, extra buttermilk, and 3/4 cup of ground flaxseed instead of the melted butter. They are a little heavier then but really healthy. Leftovers are fine for a quick breakfast during the week before I hit the gym!

I made these with a couple of other dishes for brunch yesterday. I quite liked these pancakes. I chilled the batter overnight and had to thin it with a bit of buttermilk the next morning. They cooked up well, but I didn't love the texture (i did find them slightly gummy--ostensibly from the oatmeal).

Rating: 4
I made a version of this in which the oatmeal soaked in buttermilk overnight and the sugar was only 1 Tbs. I had to add more buttermilk to thin the batter. The texture is unlike regular pancakes - these are more moist and tender but not gummy in the least. Try rolling them up like lefse or crepes after spreading jam!

Rating: 4
Wow. Quite possiby the best pancakes I've ever had. Great with blueberry jam or pure maple syrup. Using a non-tephlon calphalon pan and following the recipe exactly, I found I had to use quite a bit of butter in the pan so the pancakes wouldn't stick, which just added to their flavor. Yum!

Rating: 4
These pancakes embody the four-fork rating as "a dish beyond compare." I followed the directions exactly, but had to use both buttermilk and 2% as I ran out of the former. I also added a Tbsp of wheatgerm and a healthy dash of cinnamon to the batter, which I left out on the counter uncovered overnight. The batter thickened beautifully! Watch out when cooking these - they will burn quickly! Make these and your family and friends will sing your praises! Generic syrup isn't worthy to grace these pancakes, so make an easy compote with apples or blueberries!

In a word: Gourmet. I try to make by scratch either pancakes, waffles, or crepes a couple of times a week for my kids before school and I rarely eat any of them, but THIS, OMG! they have a uni texture with the oatmeal and served with a blueberry jam made them "not so sweet". A real adult breakfast that my kids loved. With the sit time of 2 hours, I made it in th evening and let it sit in my refrigerator. When I cooked them up, they had a brwon lacy crispy texture on the outside and a completely soft texture in the inside. I sandwiched two together with some blruberry jam and it was amazing.

I made these pancakes this last weekend and they were excellent. The best I have ever eaten.

It did not effect the taste.

So yummy, I've made these a dozen times at least and just recently tried them with the lingonberry jam and whipped cream as suggested, and WOW! Try these with the lingonberry if you can, it was definitely suggested for a great reason. I also like them with hershey's syrup.

I doubled the recipe and made these pancakes for a brunch and they got rave reviews. Prepared the batter and let sit for 2 hours. I agree that the batter needs to be spread thinly on the pan for them to cook throughout. I also thawed frozen blueberries to put in half of the pancakes, but as it turned out, guests preferred them with the blueberries. Served with maple syrup. Afterwards, I cooked up the extra batter and let the pancakes cool on a cookie rack. Then I froze the pancakes and heated them up in the toaster oven on 300 degrees during the work week. Sure beats Eggo and Aunt Jemima in the morning! Would love to hear any suggestions for toppings that aren't as sweet as maple syrup...Great recipe, making again this weekend following recipe exactly.

super yummy. I made these for a semi-healthy breakfast for my 10 month old & she loves them. I stuck them in the toaster on very low heat the next morning & they tasted great. I did have to squish them down once I flipped them to make the middles cook, but other than that, no problems. I used a little less butter in the recipe & cooked them in my nonstick pan without any extra butter.

My mom and sister liked this a lot, but I didn't like it whatsoever. It tasted absolutely bland and was a pain to make. In order to avoid a raw center, I had to spread the batter across the pan to make the pancake thinner and cook it for a long time on low heat.

Made them three times: 1st time (let it sit 2 hrs): Really fabulous. A little different; great texture. Be careful to mash down the pancakes when first poured so they're not too thick in the middle. 2nd time: (let it sit in fridge overnight) runny texture; still tasty but not fab like last time, had to fry them on a bit lower flame for a bit longer so they wouldn't be raw in the middle. 3rd time, let it sit for 2 hours, turned out great. Lesson learned: two hours on the counter is better than overnight in the fridge.

I must have tried 30 pancake recipes and until now none could compare to Marion Cunningham's Buttermilk pancakes. This recipe is totally different and great!! I now have 2 favorites. These are better with the lingonberry preserves than maple syrup. Great for house guests. Some difficulty flipping them and I thought they needed 3 minutes on the first side at 350° on electric griddle. Can't imagine adding more liquid. Made the batter the same day and let it sit 2 hours before cooking. Yummy.

For three Sunday mornings in a row, I have worked with this recipe. Rejected. 1. With a 325-degree skillet, the pancakes burn on the outside and remain slightly raw on the inside. Lower the heat, and they come out flabby. Raise it, and they burn faster and remain even rawer. 2. The pancakes are extremely difficult to turn with a spatula. The batter is very thin, but adding flour doesn't work help at all. 3. If you like pancakes that taste strongly of egg and feel slightly slimy in the mouth, then this is the recipe for you!
