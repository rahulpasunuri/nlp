Cacio e Pepe is one of the best pasta dishes you will eat. You must follow the recipe and directions to the letter for this one! After all, there are really only two ingredients. And MUST use pecorino! Parm is not nearly salty enough and a very weak substitution. I wish people wouldn't give low ratings to dishes when they did not follow the recipe correctly. That said, try this version by Mario Batali: http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/mario-batali/bavette-with-cheese-and-pepper-bavette-cacio-e-pepe-recipe/index.html The olive oil and butter help with clumping problems. YUMMMM!!!!

After reading some unhappy reviews, I tried this recipe for the 2nd time (loved it the first) and see if I would experience the same thing (cause I didnt really remember the first time). Im not a fancy shmancy person, so I just dumped the spaghetti after straining back into the pot from whence it came (not on the burner of course). Then, I gradually added the cheese, mixing it in with two spoons (mixing as in a tossing a salad motion), and made sure it was evenly coated. Then, I added the water. Mixed it again. Then, I gradually added the pepper and parsley. To finish it off, I poured a ring of olive oil on it then tossed it a bit more. It turned out perfect and delicious. My husband and I love this recipe!

What did I do wrong? When I mixed everything together all the cheese stuck to the bottom of the bowl instead of the pasta:( I used Parmigiano Reggiano because I didn't have Pecorino, was that the problem?

Would not make again. I too had clumping problems which was ok, just felt the whole thing lacked flavor. We had to add tomato sauce to eat it.

I don't normally follow directions to a 't', but in this case I did, except for one small detail, "serve immediately". This was a fatal error. The pasta had the consistency of dry play-doh. It was inedible.

One of my favorite recipes. Delicious!

Yum! Who would believe something this simple tastes so vibrant and fresh and fantastic? I clipped this from the magazine months ago and only now got around to trying it. It's a shame I waited so long - I will work this one into our week night rotation regularly. We followed the directions and didn't have any cheese clumping problems. Enjoy!

Go easy on the pepper in this, it's easy to go overboard. It was a little boring for me so we ended up adding some roasted red peppers and oil from a jar of sun dried tomatoes.

This dish has a ton of potential, but I also encountered a major cheese-clumping problem. This may have been because I added some hot cooking water too quickly. I would also definitely include more parsley to brighten the flavors. So it wasn't perfect this time around, but it's definitely worth another shot.

I thought it was very good. My only problem was that I wasn't able to keep the pecorino from clumping - so I had gooey chunks of melted cheese in which most of the pepper stuck. I did work quickly and the pasta was plenty hot and moist - not sure how to avoid this going forward (but it still tasted incredible despite my poor technique!)

Wonderful recipe! I made it for my roommates (who are very picky) and my boyfriend and it was a big hit!! The only request was more greenery!

This was great. It's the kind of thing you could surprise people with when they ask what's in it that makes it taste so good because it's so simple. If it ends up dry, it's probably because you're not adding enough cooking water once you start stirring in the pecorino and crushed peppercorns. You just have to work quickly and keep everything very hot. It also helps if you serve it in big bowls.

It's a very tasty recipe which is very quick and easy to make Definitely add all the water (add a cube of chicken or vegetable stock to the pasta water when it's boiling for added taste) and I added an egg, which made it less dry.

Very unique dish. The toasted pepper corns really did take on a nutty flavor. Delicious. Tasted just as good the next day as left overs.

It must be mentioned that the quality of this dish - as with many very simple recipes with few ingredients - depends utterly on the quality of the ingredients. If you get good ingredients, this recipe is fantastic- it's one of my favorite examples of Roman-style cooking.

Simple to make and so yummy. True the pepper is almost nutty in flavor and the cheese makes it rich and delicious.

For a guy who does not care for whole wheat pasta or peppercorns, this was incredible. My wife enjoys both and the other review, about the nutty flavor sold me on trying it. It is a winner. So simple, so yummy, so rustic. This may be may new favorite "quick" pasta.

the toasted peppercorn actually gives this dish a nuttiness i wasn't expecting. I would have liked it prepared a bit more moist (maybe by adding pasta w3ater?) this reminded me of almost being on the brinks of a carbonara, it might be really good with some egg tossed in with the pasta.
