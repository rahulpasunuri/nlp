Best Parts -easy to make -thickens up really nicely in the ice cream maker -tastes great (very rich) Suggestions: -I used store bought gingersnap cookies from trader joes and I think 25 cookies (despite the fact they are small) is simply too many cookies. I'd recommend 18 cookies -I'd suggest cooking the apples a little longer than the recipe suggests -I'd also suggest covering the sauce pan while the apples cook (at least for part of it) -I used fine sea salt rather than kosher -I'd just a little extra cinnamon Overall: -A great ice cream I'm sure my friends will love. -If you are the kinda person who wants a really rich ice cream and only plan to eat a little this is perfect (I used whole milk) -If you are looking for a lighter ice cream - use 2%.
