My dad and husband absolutely loved this. I thought it was pretty good, but a little too sweet for my taste. Next time I would reduce the molasses. I only used 1/3 cup cider vinegar, as suggested by other reviewers, and that seemed to work well. I did not have to remove the lid at the end to reduce the sauce, as some other reviewers did. There was exactly the right amount of sauce in mine. I also added about 1/2 a head of chopped garlic and used garbanzos, black beans, and kidney beans. Garnished with fresh basil. Next time will add more greens at the end, ideally cilantro, but garlic chives would work nicely too.

These are very good but would have been better if I had decreased the molasses as others have suggested. I used dried beans instead of canned: large limas, navy, and black beans. I doubled the recipe for a party and had no leftovers.

Wonderful--have made this twice in the last month for BBQs at the acreage; served with beer can chicken, steak, corn on the cob and potatoes. I reduced thyme to 1 tsp and put in crockpot on high for 3 hours, then low thereafter; did not need extra water. Perfect for ease; everyone loved them!

I agree wholeheartedly with the reviewer from Newark, DE who said that the thyme overpowered the other flavors. I did reduce the amount of vinegar to 1/4 cup as suggested by many and left everything else the same. If I made them again, I would omit the thyme altogether. If you love thyme, I would still greatly reduce the amount used.

This is an awesome recipe! I made this for a BBQ this past summer. I would add less molasses the next time I make it.

THESE ARE GREAT! I made this dish for a Memorial Day BBQ as a side dish for Spare Ribs and it was wonderful. Easy to make and delicious. I did only use 1/4 cup vinger vs. 1/2 cup and the dish still has plenty of tang!

I thought this was a great alternative to the typical baked bean dish I'm used to. I really enjoyed the flavor that the thyme added. Like other users, I also cut the vinegar from 1/2 cup to 1/4 cup and thought it had just the right amount of tanginess. I also used chipotle flavored Tabasco sauce.

The most delicious baked beans ever. They smell to wonderful while cooking. My guest devoured them. Definitely a "keeper" recipe.

These were especially easy to make since they are cooked in the oven. Great for a BBQ.

I've made this dish for our annual neighborhood 4th of July party for the last four years. This year, my husband and I are going out of town for the 4th -- and my neighbors called and asked me to make it and give it to them! Flavors are fabulous; I actually don't bake it (kitchen too hot) but cook it slowly on stovetop.

So yummy. made for a big group, cutting the vinegar to 1/4 cup - it was devoured.

I liked it but would lessen the molasses and vinegar.Interesting flavors though....I would love more side dishes that contain beans...happi cooking to all!

I very seldom made baked beans (almost did it again the other day, but changed the menu!). This is the only one I would make unless I was in the mood to use dried beans. Love it!

The only baked beans I use are from a can. However, someone asked me to bring beans for a barbeque and I found this recepie. Almost as easy as opening a can, but much much better!!I followed the directions exactly but found the beans to be too waterry after 45 minutes of baking. So I uncovered then and baked it for 15 minutes longer befor adding the bacon and Tabasco. Turned out fabulous. Even good cold in the morning!!

I cooked this for a large group of vegetarian folks for a garden party. I omited bacon and used carrots. I steamed the carrots aldente, chopped and sliced them. I mixed up everything else and refrigerated it overnigt with all ingredients Baked prior to serving for 45 mins.

I made this the other night in the crock pot - just too hot to use the oven these days. I cooked the bacon and poured off all the drippings, then sauteed the onion and added it to the crock pot. It turned out nicely. I cut the vinegar to 1/3 cup but I still think it was a little too much, it's quite tangy. Or perhaps it's because I used Heinz chili sauce instead of ketchup (found out at the last minute that I didn't have any). Great for a weeknight BBQ or for camping.

I followed the advice of the others who recommended reducing the vinegar to 2TB, and not using all the bacon drippings to sautee the onions. Next time I might try adding a little more vinegar. I used a Pyrex casserole w/lid and it baked out great---did not need more water. To make things easier for me, I mixed everything (except bacon)together in the casserole dish the night before and held it in the refrig. I baked the casserole out an hour before our picnic supper. Definitely a time saver. A very tasty dish!

I've never made baked beans before, but I certainly will again. These are easy to make and taste wonderful! I do think I'll cut back on the vinegar next time, though--I'd like more of the other flavors to come through.

I have made this dish many times for BBq's and am just about to make it again to take camping!!! Everybody loves it and it is easy to make!

I've made this recipe a couple times. The first time I thought it was too vinegary. The second time I reduced the vinegar to 2 Tablespoons and it turned out great.

All my guests absolutely raved about this dish. In preparing the dish, I reduced the vinegar to 1/3 cup, poured out almost half of the bacon fat, and for the last 15 minutes in the oven I took off the pot cover, as the beans were a little too saucy at the 30 minute mark.

I love this recipe. Sometimes I add cut up sausages or other meats to it for a heartier entree. I think the combination of flavors from the sweet liquids and the cider vinegar are just perfect the way they are. I use a half teaspoon of habanero sauce at the end, but I'd use more with a less-hot hot sauce.

We had it today for a picnic. Everyone loved it! Extended the cooking time to get a thicker sauce.

I made this recipe last night and I thought that the thyme overpowered the other flavors. My husband loved it. As a matter of fact, he was taking left overs in his lunch, but it just tasted too much like thyme to me.

Great tangy flavor! People always say they've never tasted anything like it. Guess that's good 'cause then they ask for the recipe!

I left out (on purpose) the hot pepper sauce and it was still quite good. Even my mom (a somewhat picky eater!) liked the flavors.

One of the best baked bean dishes I've ever made!!!
