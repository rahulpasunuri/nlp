I love these cookies, as does my husband and family. The dough is very easy to work with if you do the following: after mixing it, put the still soft dough between two sheets of parchment. Then roll to desired thickness and put into the 'fridge. When firm (20 mins or so), cut them out and bake. The scraps can be rerolled several times and not get tough because as long as you roll between two sheets of parchment, you don't need to add extra flour.

Decent cookies, a bit too crunchy, though. I used almond extract and omitted the lemon and vanilla which gave a nice flavor variation.

Bland, tough cookies. Not recommended. There are much better sugar cookies out there.

I was looking for a roll-out cookie for kids to decorate, and this is a keeper. I do agree that they can be bland without the icing, but since they're intended to be iced, they are perfect--not too sweet with the icing (they reminded me of biscuits w/o icing). If you intend not to use icing, this may not be your recipe! It was a bit difficult to roll out if too cold, but once the right consistency is reached it was fine, and I was surprised how easy it was to roll out between wax paper (hint--make one length of wax paper on the long side, and then hold the edge of it between the counter and your body to keep it from sliding!). I can see how adding extra flour to roll these out might result in dry, tough, tasteless cookies, but adding more flour is unnecessary with the wax paper method. I did not use the icing recommended here because I thought the egg white would impart an unwanted flavor, so I just did icing with confectioner's sugar, milk and vanilla. Next time I'll use almond extract in the icing. Seeing as I have a 3-year-old I will definitely make these again.

Blah. Bordering on not good without the frosting.

Not great. Dough difficult to work with. Too stiff when cold, and very sticky when warm. The waxed paper was very frustrating to work with. I eventually put some flour on the waxed paper and that helped some. However, it was almost impossible to roll the dough out between the waxed paper when it was cold. Definitely won't make it again.

For a roll-out cookie, fantastic. The rolling out was not the easiest I've ever tried (they get too sticky to use slight faster than normal). However, they came out of the oven extremely tender but still strong enough to hold up icing and the delicate cut-out shapes. I added the spices from the spice-roll out recipe, sans the mustard.

Easy to make and great taste.I put the dough in the freezer for 20 minutes. Did not use the royal icing, instead used colored sugar.
