After reading all the other reviews, I was compelled to make the recipe and see for myself. I followed the intructions and it turned out very well. We would make it again. It was easy and tasty!

one additional comment. Tarragon isn't our favorite spice and we prefer fresh thyme with the crab and mushrooms.

If you haven't made the recipe, then your comments can't be taken seriously. Trader Joe's sells a can of refrigerated pasturized crab,sliced cremini mushrooms and saffron all at reasonable prices. Shitakes are expensive and don't always look fresh. Double the crab, linguini,tomato paste and the liquid using wine that the saffron has soaked in and the crab juice (lightly rinse the canned crab) for the clam sauce. Keep the other ingredients as written and enjoy the recipe. My husband loves it.

This is a very expensive dish that serves only two or three people for dinner. It is bland and not worth the money or the trouble. Linguine with white clam sauce is a much better idea.

I have used this recipe for over 10 years and it always draws raves. Sometimes it pays to try a recipe instead of commenting on it just from reading the ingrediant list. as an option I've made the crab and mushroom portion and served them on grilled baguette slices for appetizers and everyone loved them. A Bon Appetit classic.

Food peeve number 1: Shitakes are NOT wild...they're domesticated, farm grown. Try this with chanterelles for a real treat!

This is the worst combination of herbs and other ingredients I've seen in a while. I can tell just by looking at it that it would be horrible. I'll make something up myself. Probably use a cream sauce and some wine..tarragon and saffron? ick!

I reluctantly have to agree with the recent reviews of this recipe. Individually, I love every single ingredient. But somehow it just didn't work for us. I agree with comments of the husband of the Fort Bragg review. We just couldn't eat it. I do admit to using dried tarragon, but I followed the recipe for everything else. I used king crab legs and fresh mushrooms. Perhpas the balance was off? Too much saffron or tarragon? I doubt I will try it again to find out.

Great use of leftover crabmeat. So many things you can do with this basic recipe. Instead of tomato paste use cream and less clam juice. Can do this with shrimp also.

This recipe failed us, too. I did use canned crab and we thought that the only thing to save this recipe might be fresh crabmeat ... but I guess my predecessor didn't think it was worth it that way, either. To each their own, I guess, but this was disappointing for us.

This is the first time reviewers have failed me. I think I'm actually angry after spending money on the crab, then the time picking the meat. My husband took maybe one bite and couldn't go on. Uck, Uck, Uck! I'm a good cook and know it wasn't my fault. Should have known better when I saw tarragon. I don't even think this would be worth it with canned crab. Shiitake mushrooms "ain't" cheap.

Definitely a winner. We served it to friends. I think that 1/2 the amount of saffron and 1/2 the onions is a better balance, though. When we made this again, we used portobello mushrooms which we thought were a little too strong for this mix, but our guests loved it. Since we quadrupelled the recipe, we used 1/4 peeled med. shrimp and those were a yummy addition, and not overpowering.

I couldn't wait to try this as it is rare to find a recipe that has received 4 forks by all as well as 100% saying they would make again. I added langostinos to this as well as the crab. Overall, I was disappointed in the flavor of the sauce. I found it quite bland. I might try it again sometime adding fresh garlic.

I substitute a can of crabmeat, so I can keep almost all of the ingredients on hand in the pantry. I haven't tried using dried mushrooms yet, but I suspect that would work too. I simmer the sauce for a while to thicken it up a bit, since I'm not fond of thin sauces. It's a nice quick and delicious weeknight dinner.

My husband was quite impressed when I served this dish to him. Not only was it so quick and simple, the taste was amazing. He's asked for this dish several times.

An unbelievably delicious dish! My wife and I were so impressed we're going to cook this for everyone we know!
