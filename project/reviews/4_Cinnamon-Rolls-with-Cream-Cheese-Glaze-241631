Best. Cinnamon Rolls. EVER. Seriously, make these. They will get eaten in one day - even if you're the only one eating 'em. Gooey cinnamon deliciousness. MMMMM.

I've tried 4 or 5 other recipes but this one is the best! they turned out so tender with a perfect texture.i used regular yeast instead of rapid rise and let them rise in a warm oven (turned it on "warm" a few minutes then off). The 1st rise for me only took about an hour--not sure the volume there was doubled but in the end the rolls rose like crazy. i did add vanilla to the dough since some reviewers said it needed more flavor. I'm so happily I've found this recipe!

I'm going to buck the trend and say these were good but not so crazy amazing that I won't tinker with the recipe, especially considering that this is a lot of work over an evening and morning when I have other cooking to do. First the notes: I use unsalted butter for the pans, never spray, and it works perfectly. I had regular, not rapid rise, yeast on hand - it worked just fine however I did not allow the milk and butter to get above about 105 degrees f, as I was concerned about killing the yeast. It rose, all's well. Because these really are best straight out of the oven, or close to it, I put the buns in the fridge overnight. It took a long time for them to come to temperature and rise properly in the morning - as in: a few hours. I sliced according to the recipe and would have preferred a thicker dimension, but that may affect the cooking time a little. Finally, where I live, during the winter "room temperature" is not warm enough for any of the spreading or softening temps required - so I turn on my oven to the lowest temp for a minute and then turn it off and use that insulated compartment for setting out the butter, rising dough, etc.. What I will alter: Not proofing yeast makes me nervous - I might just do that next time so that I'm not waiting until the first rise (and out all those ingredients) to find out how good my yeast is. The dough was nice and airy, but just a touch bland; I will add a small amount of flavor to it next time (citrus zest or other) The glaze was actually too sweet for my taste, especially given the filling, so I will decrease the sugar by 1/4 cup. Also, I am not certain that turning the buns out onto a rack is strictly required - I had no issues with any sticking to the pan, and the sugar was already carmelized, essentially "in place." May be a skippable step. And, finally, the filling was copious but in my opinion could use more butter to make it cohere. Still, all that said, these are definitely good as-written.

Rating: 3
Delicious!I will double the amount of filling though next time. I added raisins soaked in cognac as well and turned out just fine.

Rating: 4
These are delicious! Made 1 1/2 times the filling as others suggested and added pecans and raisins. Made them late in afternoon, put one pan in fridge and one in freezer. The next morning, let the one from fridge come to room temp, put in warm oven for about 40 minutes to rise and then baked. They did rise even after being in fridge overnight. These are fabulous.

I would not touch a cinnamon roll with a barge pole. Not my thing ever. But a friend was raving about them as something he loves absolutely so decided to try this recipe for his going away party. One has not lived until one has made these rolls and indeed eaten them. Had such fun making this and they disappeared in minutes at last night's going away party! I went nuts and doubled the butter (that which has to be spread before sprinkling sugar and cinnamon) and doubled the filling. I did dough in my stand mixer. Started with paddle and once flour was incorporated well switched to the dough hook and it did the rest. If dough is crazy sticky I added small teaspoons of flour but I like to keep it somewhat sticky and once kneaded it becomes less so. Just rising the dough for a second batch because I only had a tiny taste last night. Easy recipe (the rolling can be a a bit difficult if you are new to this but just go slow and it'll all be fine)! Fun to make. Magic! I could eat these every day!

These are really incredible! My oldest son turned 6 today and for the second year in a row, wanted these for his birthday breakfast. The entire batch is now gone. I make mine the night before, letting them rise for the second time in the fridge. Also, I cut the glaze by half. Delicious!

These cinnamon rolls are quite fantastic. First time to make, so I followed the recipe as written and it turned out perfectly. I'm stingy with 4 fork ratings, as most of us are and I fully recommend trying them. Happy baking

You will need 2-1/4tsp total. I use Fleischmann's active dry yeast. One packet is a little over 2 tsp, thus the need to use a second packet to equal 2-1/4tsp. I made this before and there were awesome, i'm making them again right now. Good luck.

Rating: 0
Can someone clarify the amount of yeast needed in this recipe? It states that 2-1/4 tsp are needed from 2 envelopes of yeast. However, 1 envelope is exactly 2-1/4 tsp. So, is it asking for just 2-1/4 tsp in total, or 2 envelopes that are 2-1/4 tsp each, resulting in 4-1/2 tsp total? Thanks!

This was my first attempt at homemade cinnamon rolls, and they turned out perfect. I was worried at first because the dough was so sticky. I ended up using about 4 cups of flour total just to make the dough manageable. I let it rise in the oven with no heat. The action of the yeast created enough warmth to make the closed oven a nice environment for rising. I hate working with dough, but this dough was really easy to work with. I doubled the filling, and would definitely recommend that. Like previous reviewers, I made the rolls one day in advance, and just let them sit in the fridge in their baking dishes until about an hour before I wanted to cook them. I also lessened the cooking time to about 18 minutes. I made the cream cheese glaze, but I think I would have preferred one with less cream cheese. I'll probably just make a regular simple glaze next time. Don't be afraid to make this even if you hate working with dough like me!

No forks on this one. The dough is reminiscent of play-doh. The only good thing out of this is the icing. I'll use that for something else.

I've made this 5 or 6 times. This recipe is perfect as written. The cream cheese is essential to the icing and the overall outcome. My family begs for these every weekend but it's about an hour and a half of cooking time plus almost 3 hours of rising time but the final product is totally worth it. Someone told me these were the best he'd ever tasted and I felt about ten feet tall!

Love this recipe. I usually make the day before. I let the rolls rise on my refrigerator all night, so I just have to pop them in the oven in the morning. I make the glaze while it is baking. Sooooo good!

Wow and double wow! I do lots of baking, but have never found a great cinnamon roll recipe. My 16 yr old daughter told me to just give up....but it's just been declared Colorado Cinnamon Roll day after my daughters' friend put in a petition with the governor. For my prides' sake, I had to try again, and am SOOOO excited - this is it!! The dough was very sticky, but that kept the final product light and fluffy. This is a keeper!

Will make these again and again; Just wanted to make a note that they can be made through the first rise, filled, rolled, and cut into the pans the night before. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator. Take them out the next morning and let rise for about 1.5 hours (or less, depending on how warm your house is). Then bake as normal. Takes the pressure off and turns out beautifully!

This is a fabulously easy recipe. The dough comes together swiftly, even without a stand mixer. The flavor is not overly sweet and I even halved the cream cheese glaze (I like a little less stickiness) and it was superb! My friends devoured it.

I decided to try my hand at these in a fit of boredom while waiting for Hurricane Irene to pass. These are delicious and incredibly simple (though time consuming) to make.

I made a double batch of the glaze and added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of nut Meg and 1/4 tsp of ground cloves the added flavor gave the glaze a little kick I think it tasted better with the added flavor

As many have already said: Deeelicious! I am somewhat hesitant about yeast recipes, but this was so so simple with 'warming the milk' it was easy! Also, make sure to add cinnamon (3 tbls) to the dough. I made it for a brunch and my best friend is a vegan so I 'veganized' one recipe replacing the milk with vanilla soy milk and the butter with earth balance. -- It actually turned out better than the original! (Although I think this is because i knead it more). Also for the frosting I made a double batch of: 1/2 cup earth balance (or butter) 1/2 cup coconut oil (magical ingredient) 2.5 cups powdered sugar + tsp vanilla 1/2 block cream cheese (optional) It was perfect!

Rating: 4
These are fantastic! I don't have a stand mixer so I did all the mixing by hand, which helped me to preemptively burn off some calories. I let the dough rise in the oven, which I preheated to 200 degrees and then turned off. I greased the pan with butter, not vegetable oil spray. I found the glaze to be a little thick so I thinned it out with a bit of milk and maple syrup. They were a big hit! Probably the best cinnamon rolls I've ever had! I'll be making these again...

Yep, yummy. Kinda cold up here so the first rising went oh so slowly, finally popped the dough into a warmed oven and that did the trick. Had the same issue with the rolls and then couldn't wait but they turned out well anyhow. I added some crushed toasted pecans to the filling and would advise that the next time I make this, I will double the butter in the filling, oh heck, the sugar and cinnamon too! The glaze is to die for.

I made these for a group of friends. They went over very well, but how can you not love something when it's covered in cream cheese icing? The icing might actually be the best part of these rolls. The dough seemed easy enough to make, as long as you're sure to mix in one cup of flour first, with the yeast mixture, and the rest later. I used the dough hooks on my mixer and it seemed to be a really beautiful dough. However, after just over 2 hours rising, it hadn't risen at all. I rolled it out and made the rolls anyway. They did puff up a bit in the oven, but didn't ever really get the loft that I'd hoped for. My yeast was fresh, so I'm not sure what the problem was. I would like to give them a second chance, but as they came out this time I found them a bit dense and heavy.

I made these for New Year's Day breakfast. I baked in a large pan - 13x9 glass casserole and it worked just fine. I made extra filling, and after buttering the pan (rather than using cooking spray - ick) I sprinkled the pan with the brown sugar/cinnamon mixure before placing rolls in there. That made the rolls have a sweet, crunchy cinnamony bottom. Yum! they baked for about 20 minutes, and I wish I had taken them out a couple minutes earlier as they weren't quite as tender as I had hoped for. But that may be because I have never kneaded dough before and didn't know what i was doing. These will be a New Year's tradition for us!

This is a wonderful recipe. The dough is velvety soft and so easy to roll out. It's a nice light texture, not too rich or bready, and with the filling and glaze are not overly sweet. I've made cinnamon rolls for years, and this recipe might just be the best I've tried. It's a keeper!

Rating: 4
Great recipe! BUT - be sure you use 2 glass baking dishes! I only have 1 9x9 glass dish, so I used a metal one as well. The rolls in the glass dish were perfect, the ones in the metal pan will go in the trash. Does anyone know if you can bake all 18 in a large, 2 qt glass baking dish? I.e. like a lasagne pan?

Rating: 4
A winner! To cut on a tiny bit on fat, I used skim milk instead of whole milk and substituted 1/4 cup canola oil for the butter to make the dough. For the filling, I used butter-flavored spray instead of butter, and I also added 1/2 cup golden raisins. I used a knife to spread the icing on the rolls right when they came out of the oven and sprinkled 1/2 cup toasted chopped pecans on top.

These are seriously good and seriously easy. I pretty much followed the recipe as written. Previous reviewers suggested measuring the yeast rather than relying on the 2 envelope designation. That's a good idea--it;s not quite clear from the recipe but you don't end up using two full regular size envelopes. Next time I would up the amount of filling. The glaze was excellent but I used a light hand with it, and had extra left over. I would maybe up the amount of filling too. Another reviewer's suggestion about cutting the slices with dental floss was spot on. I don't have a stand mixer, so I used my hand-held until the dough started to climb the beaters and then I finished with a sturdy spoon and elbow grease. I also made mine the night before and put them in the fridge, just after laying out in the pan. It took about 90 minutes for them to come to room temp and do their final rise. For those afraid to make a real yeast-risen bread this is a very rewarding recipe.

My daughter wanted some pastries to keep in the freezer so she could pop one in the microwave every morning before school. Instead of paying $4 or more for a bunch of preservatives, high fructose corn syrup and trans fats, I used this recipe to make cinnamon rolls for about 1/2 of the price. These don't take much attention to come together beautifully, especially using a dough hook for kneading. The finished product yielded nice, fat, golden rolls lined with lovely caramelized brown sugar. The sweetness isn't overpowering even when topped with the glaze, so the different flavors (yeasty roll, cinnamon, butter,cream cheese) really shine through. The next time I make them, I might mix it up a bit with some bread flour as well as AP flour, but other than that, this recipe will be my "go to" for a lovely morning pastry.

I have never made cinnamon rolls from scratch before...decided to give these a try and I am so glad I did. Not too doughy, not too crisp...a really great, consistent, predictable, kind of cinnamon roll you remember. The frosting was not overly sweet, had a great tang to it...not just that super sweet glaze on some cinnamon rolls. Great recipe. Will be part of our heading to the ocean breakfast in the car on future outings.

This is my one-and-only cinnamon roll recipe now. The only thing I change is to brush the tops of the rolls with melted butter as soon as I pull them out of the oven; it keeps the rolls soft so leftovers don't have that "crust" coating. Other than that, perfection as written.

Rating: 4
These were terrific! Because it took me all day to convince myself that I could do this, I had to let the dough sit overnight in the fridge before the second rise, then set them out 90 minutes or so before cooking. The dough was easy to work with (not too sticky), and the filling was just right. I should have known Molly W. wouldn't let me down! I only strayed from her recipe when making the glaze (no cream cheese in the house) so I added about 3-4 tablespoons yogurt just to cut the sweetness a bit.

Rating: 4
Amazing! Seriously the best Cinnamon Rolls I've ever had...like, ever. After reading everyone's notes I did a few things differently than the recipe: - I used my KitchenAid w/dough hook to knead the dough. I did it for about 4 minutes instead of the 8 that is recommended via hand. - I added about 1 1/2 cups of chopped pecans in the filling. I toasted them in a dry frying pan before using them - Even though it said to use a square, glass pan I used a round metal cake pan...it helped the cinnamon & sugar caramelize, which added great flavor. Note: - Be careful the recipe says to use 2 1/4 teaspoons of rapid rise yeast, which they suggest is 2envelopes...I almost followed those directions until I remembered that ONE packet of Fleischman's is 2 1/4 teaspoons. Just be sure to pay attention there. (Could these be the reason some reviewers have complained of the rolls being over-yeasty?)

It's hard to not love anything warm and smothered in cinnamon and sugar. I made this the night before and put in the fridge until morning. I used regualar dry active yeast and mixed everything by hand as I didn't have my mixer. Turned out just like it should and we are enjoying a very tasty treat on this very cold Valentine's Day.

Absolutely Fantastic. It's a keeper. Use parchment paper on the bottom of your baking dish, instead of cooking spray, and it's completely no-mess. I don't have a stand mixer, and so I made sure to knead the dough by hand at least ten minutes to release the gluten. Came out perfect. Regarding the reviewer who said the frosting was too cream cheesy, I added more powdered sugar to it and that reduced some of the tang from the cream cheese.

Rating: 4
These are great and pretty easy to make. I find it's easiest to cut the rolls by sliding a piece of floss underneath and crossing the ends over the top. The knife flattened them a bit. I've also made them ahead of time and frozen or put in the fridge overnight. If frozen, I thaw overnight in the fridge. I let them rise the final time on the countertop, then bake. Doing it this way, it takes a bit longer for the 2nd rise (but I'm also at 6100 ft above sea level...)

I made this using a cinnamon roll dough recipe for bread machines. (It contained the same ingredients as this recipe just in smaller quantities.) Used this filling and glaze. They were the best cinnamon rolls I've ever had. In hindsight, I don't see why I couldn't use these dough ingredients in the bread machine. Will give it a try next time.

Great recipe! These are in regular rotation in our house all winter long. I'm confused by the reviews talking about needing much more flour than the two and a half cups called for as the recipe calls for THREE and a half cups--you add the first cup in with the sugar/salt/yeast/butter/milk.

My family gobbled these up! I added an extra 1/2 T. of cinnamon per other ratings and doubled the glaze, but didn't use it all. I wish there was a way to make these ahead of time because I had to get up at 5:30 to have them on the table at a decent time. But it was worth it.

I have made these twice in the last couple of weeks. The first time I used one yeast packet, as it was all I had on hand. They did take a little longer to rise (the second packet of yeast would have helped) but were tender and tasty. They didn't last a day. The second batch is in the oven, baking as I type. Using two packages of yeast made a big difference in the rising time. They smell great. The kids are circling, asking when the cinnamon rolls will be ready to eat... Would I make them again -- absolutely!

Honestly.. these cinnamon rolls are amazing! I live at 6400 ft above sea level. I was concerned I'd need a special high altitude recipe, but I took the risk, and they turned out perfect. The recipe says 2 1/4 t yeast (2 envelopes), but 1 envelope yields 2 1/4 t so I only used 1 envelope. I also added 1 T more of cinnamon based on the other reviews. They were awesome, make these and you'll feel like a cinnamon roll pro! Oh, and my family and I all loved the frosting, I did double the recipe and added a pinch of salt. (to bring out the flavors)

I am experienced baker, but haven't made a dough with yeast in a while. these were light, steamy and soft on the inside and golden brown on the outside. I didn't have a square glass baking dishes available (I was baking away from my kitchen), so I used an 8" round cake pan and an oblong ceramic baking dish that looked pretty close to the right size. It worked loike a charm. These were promptly devoured, and I wouldn't change a thing about the recipe.

Rating: 3
Very good, but the taste of yeast was a little too prominent for me. I also agree that the icing tasted too much of cream cheese. I must say the dough was very easy to make and came together just fine. I did need a lot more flour than the 2.5 cups suggested, though it's better to underestimate this I guess. There was just the right amount of icing.

I tried this recipe today and my first batch just came out of the oven awhile ago. It tastes great and looks yummy even without the glaze. I just did normal glaze without the cream cheese because I hadn't the time to go get some, and it turned out more than fine. It was really easy to do despite this being only my second time working with yeast. I did have to turn down the temperature by about 10 degrees celcius, and baked it for only about 18 minutes. I did need a lot more flour too. But that's probably because of the weather here. Also, definitely cut the dough with thread! This was fun to make anyhow! Can't wait to try it again with the cream cheese.

Made these for Father's Day - big hit! I made the dough in my bread machine (added about a half-cup more flour than in the recipe), a big time saver. Ended up with 22 rolls instead of 18 (no complaints from my family) and used a different glaze without sour cream as the shop was out. Great recipe! Will add nuts next time and maybe raisins for those in the family that like them.

A reviewer on 03/22/08 made an excellent suggestion to cleanly slice the loaf with thread, rather than a knife. Dental floss or dental tape cuts equally well and one does not have to worry about dental floss breaking. NOTE: I used a JUMBO egg, because that is what I had. I needed 4+ cups of flour to get the dought to the correct consistency.

Delicious! I used skim milk and let the dough rise overnight, punching down once. Following generations of roll bakers in my family I never bother to measure filling; simply coat the dough with butter, cinnamon (higher quality tastes better), and brown sugar. The cream cheese flavor glaze is a bit over powering. I made one pan with the cream cheese glaze and another with a more simple glaze. All were in favor of the simple glaze. Eliminate the cream cheese, double the powdered sugar and vanilla, add a dash of salt and a bit of milk or cream to get to desired consistency. Of course you can never have enough glaze so keep adding milk and sugar until the volume and consistency seems right.

I used 1 envelope yeast, as that equals 2 1/4 teaspoons, and my dough turned out fine. I wish I had read the comments to add more cinnamon sugar, that would have been much better! However, I thought the quantity of the glaze was fine as-is.

I was surprised by the quick baking time for these rolls--20 minutes on the dot and they were perfect. I made 13 large rolls (instead of 18) and an extra half-recipe of frosting. The rolls were fluffy and not overly-sweet. Everyone enjoyed them. They reminded me of the huge cinnamon rolls at Ann Sather's in Chicago.

Pretty tasty and simple. If making this, check after 20 minutes. I covered with foil after 20 and removed from the oven after 30. They would have been inedible if I had cooked uncovered for 40 minutes. I know all ovens varry, but my oven does not run particularly hot so be careful when making for the first time. I went through the first rise, formed the rolls and put in fridge over night. Second rise was fine out of the fridge (but give it longer and/or rise in warmer) Most quick rising yeast recipes I have involve fridge time, so I wasn't too concerned about doing it that way. I upped the filling mixture by about 50% upped the icing about the same and included a good dose of orange zest.

With just a little introduction to bread making, this recipe is wonderfully simple and easy to make. Given a good heaping of patience you'll have wonderful scratch-made cinnamon rolls (quite impressive I'll say). If you aren't familiar with using yeast and kneading, call your grandmother, or your mom, or make a friend of their generation. It would be totally worth it. As for modifications, I usually like a good bit of icing. Even when you don't eat it, it adds to the presentation and makes everything softer from being covered in it. The quantities for the icing here could do to be doubled. That would give you good coverage, as it is, you get the moderate coverage that we all should adhere to... but don't want to.

First two notes: in microwaves things seem to cool very fast upon removal (glass does not conduct heat well) and make sure the egg is room temp - this will cool your yeast mixture too much if cold. I made these for my husband and myself so half the recipe was perfect. They were divine - even with 1% milk and a combination of butter and Earth Balance. I used an entire packet of yeast and one egg and 1/3c brown sugar and at least 3T of cinnamon and just a simple glaze. I just mixed by hand, too. The bread was light and consisted of wispy layers upon close inspection. I baked them 20 minutes and only had a tiny piece on the bottom be doughy, it just tasted cinnamony and gooey and that was fine.

Rating: 4
Excellent, easy to make and came out picture perfect. They were alot ligher than I expected, which was a plus. We didnt even frost them and I would recommend shortening the baking time so they are nice and soft. Overall a wonderful winter morning treat.

WOWZERS! These are super easy and very tasty. I used Vietnamese cinnamon from Penzeys and 3T. for extra cinna-flavor. I also added the butter that you spread on the dough to the brown sugar and cinnamon combo and mixed with a pastry blender.

These were an absolute hit at our impromptu brunch yesterday. The only question I have is, doesn't 1 packet of yeast equate to 2 1/4 tsp? I followed the 2 packet directions but I question the accuracy. All in all everyone loved them, especially the frosting. I baked them in a square teflon pan and a square pyrex and the ones in the pyrex turned out much lighter in color. I think I'll use all pyrex next time I make them.

I made these last night and they were a HUGE hit. Wow! The reaction from everyone definitely made me smile. It was my first time making cinnamon rolls so I was nervous about it, but everyone ate them until they were stuffed. I did follow some of the advice from other reviewers and added citrus zest to the glaze. I thought the glaze was still a little bland, so I doubled the cream cheese and added a little vanilla and salt as well, which I believe always makes sweet taste much better. To the cinnamon filling I added nutmeg and doubled the amount of cinnamon in it (or tripled- didn't really measure this!). I'm glad I did, it gave it a richer flavor. My suggestion is to taste as you go to get it just right. =)

These were my first attempt at homemade cinnamon rolls, and I must say I will not look for a new recipe anytime soon, they were absolutely delicious. I slightly modified the filling to: 1 cup of regular sugar, one table spoon of molasses, 3 tablespoons of cinnamon, little 5 tablespoons of room temperature butter, used an electric mixer to blend well for easier spreading.

This is only my second time ever making cinnamon rolls. And it had been awhile since I had made anything with yeast. I couldn't find the rapid rise yeast that the recipe called for so used active dry yeast. The dough turned out great (it did what it was supposed to do). I was doing a big breakfast in the morning so I wanted everything ready to go. I rolled out the dough and buttered and sprinkled with sugar mixture, rolled up and cut into rolls. I put them in the refrigerator over nite and pulled them out in the morning and brought to room temp. Baked and frosted (I added orange zest to the frosting-YUM) Everyone loved them and it was hard to only eat one! Definatly a keeper!!

This was a good recipe. It was my first attempt at working with yeast and it turned out surprisingly well! They were relatively light with the perfect amount of yeast-i-ness. The icing is awesome (my husband hates icing and after the first 2 un-iced, he tried an iced one and went back for even more icing for what he had left). The only thing I will do differently next time is to cook less. I cooked around 18 minutes (when they turned golden). I will probably remove at 15-16 minutes next time.

Great cinnamon rolls. My family doesn't like cream cheese so I just mixed 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar with 3 tbsp half and half and a tsp of vanilla for frosting. They were best right after baking but still good the next day warmed in the microwave. Will definitely make again

The BEST cinnamon rolls yet.

These were by far the best cinnamon roll recipe I've tried and the easiest, too. I didn't have whole milk so I used 1/2 cup half-and-half and 1/2 cup skim milk. I, too, speeded up the second rise time by covering in a 150 degree oven. I thought the amount of filling and glaze was perfect. Has anyone tried freezing the baked rolls? If so, did you glaze before freezing?

A helpful tip is to mix the butter with the cinnamon and sugar to make a paste, then spread it over the rolled-out dough. I didn't like the glaze much. Other than that it's a good recipe. My co-workers asked I make it again!

Good basic recipe. I also cheated and made the dough in the bread machine. My yeast was a bit ld and they didn't puff up as much as I would have liked but they also weren't too heavy and tough. I ran out of cinnamon so I used only about half which is fine by me since I don't like a strong cinnamon flavor. as leftovers these are best heated up a touch though - once cool they seemed pretty bland. It's the hot rolls that really get a good texture.

I had to bake these rolls longer than the recipe calls for at least by 15 minutes because they were not done completely....and when I baked them longer it dried them out.

I made this recipe several times now.. and it always turns out exceptional. I did however, add captain morgan's spiced rum to the cream cheese frosting (Because I was out of pure vanilla bourbon at the time and didn't know it) and omg.. it was awesome.. my coworkers and friends loved it.. it seems like a odd combination at first, but there is something about the blending of the flavors that bring it an extra richness. I did a couple of batches with just the vanilla, and I will admit, that I have gone back to the rum (orange zest added to that would be a yummy thought too).. Happy baking!

Terrific recipe. This was easy to make and the results were delicious. I baked these about 15 minutes, just until slightly browned, and the rolls were soft and moist. I will definitely make these again.

I just made these this morning, and am very happy with how they turned out. I followed some others' advice, and increased the cinnamon-sugar mixture by about a quarter. I also set the dough to rise in a slow oven of 170 degrees to speed up the rising process and found it quite successful - instead of requiring two hours to rise initially, the dough doubled in only 45 minutes, the second time round I let it rise for about 20 minutes in the oven. I will make these again!

I cheated a bit and made the dough for these in the bread machine, but otherwise, this recipe is a hit! Make sure you use good cinnamon, and don't skip the pan- flipping step after baking! It was the first time I made cinnamon rolls, and I thought they were WAY better than the ones from the famous mall food court purveyors of cinnamon rolls.

Easy, and a hit.

I'm really surprised this recipe is rated so highly. These were pretty average -- the roll itself was dry and fairly devoid of flavor and there was not quite enough filling to make these gooey or in anyway decadent. I'd be pretty sad to end up with this in a bakery and it was a bit of a downer to go to the trouble to have them turn out so dull. Definitely won't bother to make these again.

Rating: 4
I did a little experiment on these - one pan I baked right away, the other I put in the fridge overnight and did the second rise in the morning. The results were fantastic either way, which means that you don't have to get up at 4:00 AM to make great cinnamon rolls! Making again tonight for breakfast in the morning! Yumola!

Wonderful. Used whole wheat flour and recommend that. Doubled the amt of butter in the glaze by accident, and DEFINITELY would make that mistake again (had to add a bit more powdered sugar to even it out). Next time, I will double the amount of cinnamon / brown sugar mixture - seemed like it needed more in relation to the dough. Covered it with foil at the end - and they turned out PERFECT. The smells alone of them baking it worth the effort. Will think about adding some nuts next time. Definitely a keeper. Can't wait to make the next batch.

these were the best cinnamon rolls I've ever made. I found the dough to be very forgiving for a yeast dough, and I put the dough in a 170' oven to rise to speed up the process and it worked great!

Unbelievably good frosting; fairly good cinnamon rolls. Use all the sugar filling; I thought it was too much and skimped, a move I sorely regretted later.

These are amazing. I've had the best results with saigon cinnamon and long rises. I usually have to decrease the amount of flour though because it is so arid in Arizona, sometimes by up to three quarters of a cup. I make them at least once a week since the first batch came out of the oven. My five year old says these are the best kind of food in the world! My two year old just can't shovel it in fast enough, and my husband, who actually used to hate cinnamon rolls, is always asking when I'll make more. I've tried every other recipe for cinnamon rolls I could find, and this one reigns supreme. I've made them completely by hand, in the processor and with the mixer... you just can't go wrong!!

Hollyhayes from Georgia: the instructions for rapid rise yeast are on the package. Mix the yeast into the dry ingredients, heat the liquid to 12- 130 degrees and add. (Measure with a thermometer!) Mix in stand mixer, add rest of liquid ingredients. Mix. Put into oiled bowl and let rise 10 minutes. Lightly spray work station in oil and roll out. Oil rolling pin also. Cut and place in greased dish. Space at least 1 inch between. Let rise and bake. Or let rise overnight (I leave mine on the counter covered with plastic wrap) and bake. You will soon have cinnamon rolls!

hollyhayes from Georgia - mix the yeast with the dry ingredients, add milk that has been heated 120-130 degrees. (Test it with a thermometer!) Mix in stand mixer, add the rest of the liquid ingredients. The rapid rise yeast needs a higher degree liquid than regular yeast. Oil a bowl, put your dough in the bowl and let rise 10 minutes, then oil your workstation and rolling pin. Roll out as directed, then place in greased dish with space inbewteen the rolls. Let rise and then bake. (I let mine rise overnight and bake in the am. I don't stick them in the fridge overnight, I let them rise on the counter, cover the pan with plastic wrap.) There are specific instructions on the Fleishman's Rapid Rise Yeast to follow. (What I just gave you) Enjoy, you will have cinnamon buns that you love!

I was really worried these wouldn't turn out because they didn't rise the way I expected them to. I put them in the oven anyway and they still turned out great. My only criticism is that the cinnamon flavor wasn't as strong as I would have liked. Next time I will definitely put more of the cinnamon sugar mixture in the roll.

OMG, these are awesome!! I am an experienced baker, but I've always been too intimidated to try baking with yeast. These turned out perfectly, and we all had to restrain ourselves from gobbling them all up in one sitting! I used 1% milk, because it was all we had, and they turned out very well. I also followed other reviewers' suggestion to warm the dough on top of an oven set at 250 degrees. My son said, "These are even better than Cinnabon!" -- that's high praise from a 9-year-old!

Unbelievable recipe. Extremely easy to make but time consuming. I agree, they are not very good looking but the taste is incredible! I froze the few that did not get eaten and defrosted them in the microwave and they were still yummy! I am sure to make them again and again. This recipe is a KEEPER!

to hollyhayes from Georgia. I don't know what you are doing wrong, but I am impressed, I have only ever used rapid rise. From the recipe, I think the most likely possibilities are that the yeast you bought was old, or more likely you added it to a milk mixture that was still too hot. Touch the mixture with your clean finger, if it feels hot rather than warm, let it cool off more before you add the yeast. I hope this helps. You sound tenatious. Happy baking!

I thought the rolls were a little dull and nothing special. I much prefer a glaze that I make by mixing cream and brown sugar in the pan before baking, as I found the cream cheese to be a little cloying for some reason. I don't see how these are special compared to what you might buy at a great bakery...

This was the second time making this receipe. I changed the oven temp to 350 instead of 375 for 15 minutes. Rolls browned nicely and not as dry. Also the the bottom with the sugar did not burn. I also used my mixer for mixing & neading the dough. Fantastic recipe and easy.

I made these for Easter Brunch and they were delicious! I mixed and assembled the rolls the day before, refrigerated them overnight, and then in the morning I just let them do their final rise and then baked! After reading some of the other reviews here, I decided to double both the filling and the frosting. I ended up with leftovers of both, so I probably would have been just fine making the amounts called for in the recipe. Also, 20 minutes was the perfect amount of baking time! To answer the question below about yeast from 2 packets- just make sure that you measure out 2 1/4 tsps of yeast total. Even though the packets say that they each contain 2 1/4 tsps, when I actually measured I found that my packet only contained about 1 3/4 tsp. So you may be able to get away with one packet, but just measure to be sure.

Oh my! Delicious! This was my first attempt at making homemade cinnamon rolls and I could not be more pleased. I am not a baker person, but I found this recipe to be easy and the end result delightful. The one trick I used (given to me from my sister in law) was to use thread (as in sewing thread) to "cut" the rolls. You simply cut a length of thread and slide it under the "loaf" to where you want to cut, and using both hands pull the string in opposite directions. Kinda like being a Ninja but with cinnamon rolls, not with necks! The string may break, but just cut a new length. This gives you perfectly round rolls! I love this recipe and got 6 thumbs up from my guys.

I have made homemade cinnamon rolls before, and these were much simpler and tastier (especially with the rapid rise yeast). My family raved and raved. I followed the instructions exactly and everything turned out right, including rising time. I let rise in the oven with the oven light on. It seems to be just enough warmth. Even the cooking time was about right for my oven although I may use the foil suggestion next time to make them a bit less brown. I can hardly wait to make them again! I was wondering if they can be prepared the night before and then refrigerated and baked the next morning without affecting the quality?

Oh and yes. Put them in the pan you will bake them in. Freeze. Totally defrost before cooking in the oven. When you buy Cinna-buns from the chain store, they come frozen. The onsumer can take home and cook in their own oven when desired.

These rolls were terrific, although I agree with most people that they took much less time to bake (16 minutes for me). After cutting the rolls and placing them in the pan, can they be frozen for later? Also, can the dough be used for any other pastries...it's so tasty and easy to make that I'd love to use it for other recipes.

I have now made this recipe 3 times and have loved it every time. The changes I have made are to double the amount of filling (going easy on the cinnimon) and using light brown sugar (the dark brown kept burning). I also let the dough rise on top of the oven with the temperature turned to warm or around 250 which really helped it rise to over double in the two hours of time. I also put foil over the tops during the last 3 minutes of baking as others have recomended to keep them from browning too much. I'm not crazy about the cream cheese topping but I like the consitancy so I might try adding orange zest like some other commentors. Overall, a major success. I also used the mixing paddle to get the dough started in my Kitchen Aid and then at 3 C flour, switched to the dough hook and stoped every minute or some to make sure everything was getting incorporated.

Wonderful rolls. I decreased the filling to 1/2 C. of brown sugar and one T. of cinnamon. There was still plenty, and I also added about 1/2 C. of raisins. I formed the rolls, and let them rise overnight in the cool nighttime temperature of our midwestern home. I baked them this morning to rave reviews!

I don't even have a mixer and did this by hand (yes, that was crazy, but actually not so bad). Although I didn't end up with as many as it says in the recipe (I guess I like mine bigger) I was blown away by this recipe. Unanimously loved in my house. Agree with the tin foil technique, I didn't think of it and my second pan got a little too browned. HUGE success though.

This was a great recipe, but these rolls definitely do not require 20 minutes in the oven. I have made them twice. The first time I baked them for 18 minutes and they were dry. The 2nd time I only baked them for 13 mins and they were perfectly moist. These rolls were my first successful attempt at baking with yeast!

Forgot to add in my review that it did take several hours for my dough to raise, but this has been my experience with other yeast dough: the more sugar in the dough, the longer it takes for the yeast to "consume" the sugar and rise to double. It may take 3-4 hours for the first rising. It's day 2 after my first batch and the texture and taste are still excellent!

I'm always on the lookout for yeast bread recipes, and although I have my Mom's from childhood, this tops it! My sisters and I grew up baking every Saturday for our family of 10, and cinnamon rolls were my favorite....it does take me back and I'm so thankful to my Mom for MAKING us learn to bake breads, pies, etc. My two oldest married girls asked me to teach them how to bake rolls before Christmas. They did fantastic...This is my language of love for my family and friends to bake and share, since most don't have the time or inclination to make things from scratch.....but it's OOOOOOH so much better! Now I gotta wrap up these fresh rolls and make some deliveries before I eat 'em all myself! (I had 3 already, for shame!) By the way, I love reading the reviews and really appreciate all the little hints to make these and any recipe outstanding. I agree to cover rolls at 17 minutes with foil, then bake 3-4 more minutes. I also put parchment paper in my pan first so it lifts right out after cooling. Thanks all my fellow bakers!

I made these on Saturday night and parked them in the fridge to bake off on Sunday morning. They were very easy to put together and produced a beautiful looking roll. I made one pan with the cream cheese glaze and another with a conectioner's sugar, milk and vanilla glaze. I preferred the regular confectioner's sugar glaze as did the rest of my family. I did have to add at least another 1/2 cup of flour to reduce the stickiness in the dough...until it felt like the right consistancy. I also covered them loosely with some foil at 17 minutes to prevent them from becoming too brown...they were done in exactly 20 minutes in my oven. I will definitely make these again!

This is just a slightly-tweaked version of a recipe that has been listed on allrecipes.com since at least the year 2004. The tweaks don't produce a noticeably better roll. (One can find it listed on the All Recipes site under Top 20). Give credit where credit is due.

I found myself nodding and laughing out loud as I read Molly's article. I have always felt exactly the same way about baking with yeast. Reading about her success inspired me to give the recipe a try. I succeeded in making a great batch of cinnamon rolls for the first time. (My previous attempts have been dismal failures). The rolls were easy to make, except for the waiting (I am a bit impatient), and so delicious. I really enjoyed the glaze which is very similar to a cream cheese icing I make for cakes. Unlike the cook from Alabama, I love extra gooey cinnamon rolls smothered in icing, so I doubled the glaze recipe. I can't wait to make them again!

I sorry to say I was very disappointed with this recipe. Previously I have made other recipes Molly has posted on her blog and they were great. The dough took much longer to rise than stated on both risings. After they were made into rolls, I let them rise for 3 hours and they still did not get anywhere near double in bulk. I baked them anyway and they did rise in the oven. Now I am not a novice baker and I know my ingredients were good. The kitchen was not too cold, nor was the dough in a draft. I made another roll recipe the next day using the same yeast and flour and they turned out fine. Also, after these rolls were baked, they did not separate very nicely and looked all ratty. The icing was very good, but I did not care for the way it tasted on the warm rolls. Not only that, we felt there was too much icing. It would have been better spread on about 24 rolls. Of course, that is just a personal opinion. Others must like this much icing. The next day on a room temp roll it was a better flavour combination. I will likely make the icing again, but will stick with my tried and true recipe for roll dough.

These are certainly the best cinnamon rolls I've ever had, and the first time I've tried to make them myself! I made them for my boyfriend right after I read this article, and he was blown away! I used the stand mixer with the kneading hook to do ALL of the mixing, which made it easier for me and worked great. I also doubled the amount of filling which made them extra yummy and really wasn't too much filling at all, surprisingly. Many thanks to the author of this article!!!

Excellent! I was reading Bon Appetit in bed when I found this recipe. It sounded so good that I got up to make the dough and let it rise overnight in the refrigerator. I used a food processor to mix and knead the dough, which is much faster than a stand mixer, IMO. I finished with hand- kneading for a few minutes. Also, I used Vietnamese cinnamon, which is stronger than what's available in a grocery store. However, I only used 1 1/2 Tbsp. instead of the full 2 Tbsps. Also I used round metal cake pans instead of square glass pans, and baked them at 350 degrees instead of 375. I baked one pan for 10 minutes, froze them and will reheat them at a later date. The dough is meltingly soft and moist, and the cream cheese glaze is yummy. Thanks for a great recipe.

Thanks to BA for turning me on to a great Blogger! I tried the recipe and although I am NOT afraid of yeast I had difficulty getting these to rise. The 2nd rise in particular did not take 45 minutes as stated in the recipe but almost 2 hours. Regardless, they turned out deliciously. I always set my timer for a few less minutes than a recipe states to begin checking for doneness and I'm glad I did. At 17 minutes the rolls were almost too brown. Very time consuming but also very tasty. I might make them again.
