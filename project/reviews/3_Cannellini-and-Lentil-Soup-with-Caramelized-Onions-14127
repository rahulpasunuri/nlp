I thought this soup was awesome. Great flavour, nice amount of spice, and great meal to serve beans. We replaced the bulgur with pearl barley and used canned Cannellini beans.

This is a very curious recipe. It happened to contain exactly the ingredients I had on hand, so I made it despite the other comments. I used chicken broth instead of water and was quite pleased with the taste of the result. I also watched those onions very very carefully. They were fully cooked in 17 minutes - with a couple burned. But in my experience the beans would never cook in 10 minutes; it would be much more sensible to make the instruction to cook them until they were al dente and then add the lentils etc. for 30 more minutes or so. I (foolishly) followed the instructions and added the grains after 10 minutes. Two and a half hours later the rice, lentils and bulgar were more or less mush. Tasted good, though.

I followed the recipe exactly and found it to be very bland. Even though the onions were salted before baking, I still had to add more salt and plenty of pepper for it to be palatable at all. I do agree with Jennifer from WA that you really need to watch the onions (my first batch burned). Maybe if vegetble broth were substituted for the water, it would have been better.

This is an interesting soup with the unusual flovors of cinnamon & cardamom in the broth. I substituted a combination of small white beans & great northern beans for the cannelini. Be sure to watch the onions as they caramelize. I left them alone & some burned.
