It was good just a bit sour for my taste.

This is an absolutely delicious yogurt sauce. My family really enjoyed it. We used the Cilantro Garlic Yogurt Sauce as an alternative to traditional cocktail sauce with shrimp. Wow! It was good. I am not use to the sour taste of plain yogurt, and then adding the lemon made it even more sour. However, I did notice that it is very important to let the flavors blend together in the refrigerator before serving. I did add a half packet of Stevia - Pure Via sweetner- to cut the sour taste just a bit. It made a big difference for me since it is not a dish I am accustomed to eating. I am very pleased with this dish. A great way to get more probiotics in my diet. Thank you.

Really nice and versatile sauce, with great, bright flavors. I used it with naan, cucumbers and chicken with aleppo pepper (from this site) for a great middle eastern dinner.

I agree, easy and delicious. Went well with the Harissa Lamb Chops http://www.epicuriou s.com/recipes/food/v iews/238423 Also good as a substitute for tsaziki, with falafel.
