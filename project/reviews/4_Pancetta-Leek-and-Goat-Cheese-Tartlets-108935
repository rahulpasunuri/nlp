Wow, I thought these were super, and my guests loved them. Considering how impressive they are, this is a reasonably easy recipe. I did substitute garlic and herb boursin for the goat cheese because I had it on hand. Can't wait to try them with blue cheese crumbles. They only issue I had was the pastry. I just couldn't get it to come together without adding water.

This is a great base recipe - I substituted sun-dried tomatoes for panchetta and my guests really liked the flavor. Some people mentioned that they let the butter melt - that defeats the whole idea of somewhat crumbly crust. Also I added two tablespoons of water and now thinking that it was a mistake since the crust came out a bit crunchy. Next time I'm going to stick to oritinal instructions.

OK - so I made a boatload of changes. For those of you who that irritates, stop reading now. I let my cr cheese and butter soften, and mixed in a mixer - then added flour - only needed 1 tsp of water to get the dough to come together. I separated the dough into quarters, and then rolled 24 little dough balls (6 ea quarter) and then put it into the fridge for an hour. I cooked the leeks and the pancetta (thick cut / diced) and did not mix into the eggs. I softened the goat cheese and whisked it into the eggs + S&P. After I spread the dough in the mini tins, I loaded in the leeks by hand, then a couple of pancetta pieces, then added a spoonful of egg / goat cheese topper. This seemed easier than mixing it all together then trying to get it into the tiny cups. Note I used 2 whole eggs and about 1/3 C of mixed skim milk and cream. These were quite good and will make again - but will double the batch. If you are going through this work - may as well make enough to use near term, and freeze the balance!!!

Excellent. But one reviewer noted that the crust was crumbly. This is because pie crust needs WATER added! I used about 4 T cold water, after the flour and butter/cream cheese were mixed. Other than this (typo?), very tasty.

I made this delicious recipe for our wine club. I followed the directions just as they were written and they turned out perfect. I found the goat cheese to be lumpy so I used my fingers to break it up so it would be well incorporated into the mixture. The tartlets were a big hit! This is a very sophisticated appetizer!

This was a great recipe. I took the other reviewers' advice to add blue cheese as well. I also used about 1 1/2 cups of leeks. Finally, I made the crust and it fell apart so I ended up using store bought frozen pie crust.

Rating: 4
I actually made some substitutions. I used puff pastry instead of making the crust (to save time) - it worked OK, but I think the crust would have been just as good. I used prosciutto instead of pancetta, because that was all that I could find. It was just as good, I'm sure. I used gorgonzola cheese because my mom does not like goat cheese, and I think this change added a welcome flavor that would have been missing otherwise. I used some egg white to hold it together, and it was fine. I used some milk instead of all half and half and it was fine.

This is a terrific recipe! Delicious!!! You can make it very simple and quickly by using frozen phyllo cups/tartlet shells. When doing this you can make the filling the night before and pull it out and fill just before baking. I get raves every time I serve these and they last about 5 seconds...then gone!

I made these for Mother's Day Brunch and they were a big hit. I doubled the recipe to have 24 larger tarts using a regular size muffin tin. I also used Garlic & Herb Boursin rather than goat cheese because I already had it on hand in the fridge. I would also recommend not mixing the eggs/cream/cheese with the pancetta/leeks. I found it much easier to fill the pastry with the pancetta/leek solids then spoon the liquid eggs/cream/cheese into the cup.

great! added a bit more cheese, used only 2 cups or little less of the leeks, crisped the pancetta a bit longer as recommended. turned out great, will make again for sure.

I made this two days ago. It was a hit with friends. I used all the leeks, they cook down, and two cloves of garlic. I also used feta goat cheese. The feta were in little crumbles. It gave it great flavor without being to mild. Its on my make again list.

Rating: 4
I took the advice from other reviewers and didn't use all the leeks. I think about 2 leeks would do the trick. I also had to saute the pancetta for much longer to make it crisp. I used the given amount for goat cheese, but I think would be better with a bit more. I served them at a bridal shower at room temperature. Everyone loved them!

Yummy!! I made them in muffin tins, so larger, for a girls brunch. I made some shredded hashbrowns and topped a tart on a little nest, we had them with a simple green salad with strawberries and pecans. I will definitely make again.

Just okay, although very pretty on a buffet table. Next time: fewer leeks, more goat cheese. Once they were cool, they weren't very appetizing, so maybe they weren't the best idea ever for a baby shower buffet.

PERFECT - this is the third time I am making this. My friends are asking " will you have those goat cheese thingies"? Great recipe, particularly the dough, can't go wrong with this one. Enjoy!!!!

NOTE: While these are very good (the crust is flaky) they were slightly labor intensive from the standpoint of lining the mini-muffin tins. Since the flavor is very subtle the wine pairing suggests a delicate white. A little more flavor like some carmelized garlic would give them a somewhat needed bump to make them 4 fork worthy. Still, a good make ahead and freeze hors d'oeuvre.

Loved this recipe. I think a little garlic sauteed with the leeks would be good. Will bake ahead and freeze for the holiday season.

I have a question for those of you who have made, then frozen, these appetizers....Do you bake them, then freeze? Freeze before baking? Par-bake, then freeze? I have a big cocktail party coming up and need to do as much advance prep as possible. I'd love your advice! Thanks!

These were great -- made them once for a party and once for New Year's Eve. Used whole wheat flour which worked fine. Had more filling than I needed but am planning to make extra pastry and try freezing them. I think this would probably be great in larger servings--larger muffin tins or even as a tart. If it does freeze well, something I will be keeping in my freezer.

Very easy and a big hit! For ease, fill the tartlet pans separately with the meat, leeks and then cream filing.

These were fabulous. I cant imagine substituting phyllo for the pastry as the crust is the thing here. I added a bit of garlic and cayenne to the filling because it seemed to ask for it. I second Nocallulu from CA about the ice water. As written, my dough didnt do. I had to add about a tablespoon before it came together. Ill be making this again for a party later this week.

I made these a couple of years ago for a college "get ready to work on your B.A. paper all the time party" along with other hors d'oeuvre recipes from this site. I thought they did't turn out when they looked like a bubbly butter mess in the oven, but they set and were fantastic. I am making them again for a birthday breakfast at work. And I didn't use any meat both times.

I've made this recipe numerous times and it always turned out beautifully. However this last time I followed the recommendation of some reviewers and used the phyllo tart shells because we were in the process of moving and I had packed my tart pans. I found the recipe when using the phyllo tart shells not as good as when made according to the original recipe. It is a wonderful recipe and I'll make it again but never with the phyllo tart shells. Didn't taste as rich.

This has become a holiday pre-dinner classic. There'd be a revolt at our annual Christmas dinner if these weren't on the menu. NOTE: be sure to keep a few teaspoons of ice water close by in case the dough doesn't come together in the food processor. Go one teaspoon at a time until it does (it's usually no more than 2).

I have made these tartlets several times for dinner parties, and they are delicious. I like them, because they can be made ahead of time and reheated when guests arrive.

Using phyllo cups is a terrific alternative to the crust in this recipie. I made this with bacon instead of pancetta and when I ran out of goat cheese, used shredded fontina. Both were terrific. Bake them in the phyllo shells ahead of time in mini cupcake pans and then re-warm in the oven for about 10 minutes.

I have made these scrumptious little tartlets twice now. They are easy and re-heat nicely. I substituted proscuitto for the pancetta but kept everything else the same. The crust is my favorite part of the recipe because it is so flaky and flavorful with the cream cheese. I will definitely make these again.

The perfect savory hors d'oeuvre. I had never made crust before and found the recipe very simple and the results perfect (although I only used about half of the dough because it looked too thick as called for).

I made this recipe for a little cocktail party during the holidays. Excellent! and so easy. I was a little nervous about the dough...but the processor does all the work. It took 3 minutes and it was mixed and formed a ball. So easy! I also did not add any add'l salt since I read so many comments on it being a little too salty. The pancetta had enough salt. Try this...

I don't know if my cream cheese and butter were too cold or what, but I had a terrible time getting this dough to come together. I didn't want to overwork it in the food processor for fear of it getting over-glutenized, so I used the usual piecrust technique of adding a couple of tablespoons of ice water. That seemed to work fine.

A hit at all my parties, always one of the first things to go. The dough is wonderful and so easy to make! I made a vegetarian version using spinach and shallots instead of the pancetta and leeks, and they were delicious too.

I have made these on many occasions and they are always a hit. I wouldn't make these with crust substitutions - the cream cheese crusts are so good. They are worth the effort and add to the flavors of the filling.

This was a great appetizer. I did not have time to make the crust so I filled prepared mini Philo cups that you can find in the frozen food section by the frozen pastry dough. They were easy and very delicious. The mini Philo cups were great because a larger tart would be way to much for an appetizer and a little rich. I will make again for sure, and impressive appetizer and very very good.

Great recipe, very easy to prepare. I used regular bacon and to save time purchased ready-made pie crust and put them in a larger muffin tin(for 6). Served this as a first course with a side of mixed greeens. All of my guests were impressed with this very simple and no fault dish!

Oh so good! With a "tart tamper" (a wood tool available at kitchen shops), the pastry didn't require chilling and made absolutely perfect little tarts. I substituted a diced proscuitto from Trader Joe's for the pancetta, very good. This will be made again and again, I'm sure!

This was a taste explosion! I also made these a day ahead and since I was hosting Christmas and had lofty ambitions and I have a baking curse, I cheated and used frozen phyllo tat shells. They were perfect I baked and then re-heated and they werre fine. I think regular crust would be too heavy. Phyllo added a nice crispy accent!

I made these with frozen mini fillo shells and they were great! A definite hit at my dinner and they'll become a staple of my parties. I used only 3 oz. of pancetta (what came in the package) but I think next time I'll stick to 4 oz.

The pastry is VERY forgiving and produces excellent results. The dough can take a fair bit of manhandling as you work it into the muffin tin. The crust recipe is great for beginners or those who haven't much past success with pastry - just follow the instructions. As suggested by others, I used more cheese and was pleased that I did. I used pancetta but regular bacon could easily be substituted. The tartlets reheated nicely and I liked the idea of rewarming them in the muffin tin. A great appetizer recipe to have in my repetoire!

excellent recipe. I don't have a food processor so I made the dough by hand, working the fat and flour with my fingers. Great results.

The tartletts are cute and delish, will be making them in a few weeks again!

I, too, had trouble with the crust. It did not want to stay together, especially when slicing. I ended up putting a glob in each muffin space and pressing it down and around the mold with my fingers. The measuring spoon dipped in water idea did not work for me. But they still came out great and tasted wonderful. Guests loved them. I doubled the recipe, and I could've gone a bit lighter on the leeks and a bit heavier on the goat cheese.

Whoa - this one's a keeper. The trick with the pastry is to get it nice and cold, then use your knuckle to press into the mini-pan. For half of the tartlets I substituted smoked bluefish for the pancetta - both were outrageous. This takes a bit of time, but is well worth the effort, and the result is a winner! Go for it!

Thanks for the tip Great Falls, the measuring spoon worked great. I rolled the dough into a log the same diameter as the bottom of each mini muffin tin, and then sliced one for each. I used my tablespoon measure though (I have Williams Sonoma spoons and they are perfectly round) and when pressed down, it is the same size as my mini muffin holes. To keep the spoon from sticking, I dipped it in hot water between each one, making 24 took all of 3 minutes tops!

Divine. Absolute perfect consistency on egg mixture. Although I did substitute canadian bacon for pancetta, as I don't care for the smokiness, I'm sure any cured meat in this recipe would be delicious.

Other reviewers aren't kidding about getting the crusts into the pan. I thought I had destroyed mine by the time I finished but they baked up just fine. I substituted prosciutto for the pancetta, and left the goat cheese out of half of them. They were very good despite the substitutions/ omissions. Overall I thought it was a lot of work for just 2 dozen appetizers. But I'm sure I'll make them again. :) Served these w/ Greg Norman sparkling chardonnay/ pinot noir. It was great!

Made this for a holiday dinner party, over which I slaved for days, and I think this (along with the potato gratin with bacon and arugula which I also found here) was the favorite.

Vancouver's comment just shows us where cooking in the modern age has come . . . when people mistake your homemade pastry dough for "packaged". Seemed not too long ago when pastry dough tasting like packaged was an insult. I think we should all slow down, and bake from scratch a little more often.

I used this recipe to make a large quiche instead of small tarts, and it turned out great. I've never managed to make pie pastery without it coming out tasting more like bread dough, but this one turned out nice and flakey. My husband thought it came from a package! And the combo of pancetta and goat cheese was lovely. A word of warning, both the pancetta and goat cheese are really salty, so make sure not to add too much additional salt, if any. Also, to lighten it a bit, I used low fat sour cream instead of cream, and included the egg whites. It was still nice and creamy.

I measured things fairly exact, and the amounts were correct.

The dough was snap with my food processor. I had a little trouble pressing it into muffin pans since I have long nails, but I made do with the round, glass top from a vinegar decanter. I don't like goat cheese so I substituted grated parmesan. I had also read the reviews about blandness so I used just one leek, and then sauteed that with one finely chopped turnip, one cup of finely chopped mushrooms and a cup of finely chopped spinach. I also added a clove or so of minced garlic and a few dashes of red pepper sauce. They turned out great. I wish I could afford truffles. They remind me of a great truffle/cheese tart I ate in San Francisco last month.
