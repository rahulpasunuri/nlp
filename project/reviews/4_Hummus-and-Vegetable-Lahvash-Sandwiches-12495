This is a very tasty and a good on the run sandwich.

I didn't do the sandwich either, but the hummus was fantastic! I really like lemon, so I added a little extra. Also, I used my smaller food processor so it was a little on the chunky side, but I actually like it that way. The cumin adds a nice little extra dash of flavor, too.

I didn't make the sandwich, but the hummus is perfect! I roasted the garlic as others have suggested, used 1 lime and it turned out with wonderful flavor and the right consistancy (not too thick as other reviewers have suggested). This recipe is a keeper :)

This is a nice classic hummus. If you are used to store bought fancy ones this will seem a bit bland (like some of the earlier people commented) but it is not bland. The essential flavours of the ingredients shine through and it tastes wonderful. Extra lemon and cumin are wonderful, and I found it needed more water and oil. I'd like to add some fresh cilantro next time I make it.

The hummus needed more lemon juice and a touch more cumin, I thought, and once the flavors had a chance to blend, the hummus tasted better. The whole dish was satisfying and healthy.

I did not try the sandwich, but the hummus is tasty and easy to make!

Best hummus I've made. I don't like the sharp bite of raw garlic, so added two whole roasted heads. I think the cumin and parsley (italian in my case) make this recipe!

Hummus was way too dry! Needed lots of extra water and olive oil.

I love the flavors together but it required more fluid. I added more lemon juice and water. I also substituted parsley for cilantro. It turned out really nice.

Like others said - you need more liquid and the liqud from the can is great. I also added nore salt and more lemon juice and it was still flat. I tried adding a bit of fresh mint and that perked it right up.

I was looking for a good hummus receipe. This was not it. I only made the hummus part. It was very dry. I ended up adding more than twice the liquids listed and it is still a little dry. I will keep looking for a good hummus receipe.

Made this for friends and everyone loved it. Left out the radish and alfalfa and added a spring mix instead and it came out great.

I made the full recipe for a week's worth of lunches for myself. I used whole wheat pita pockets instead of creating wraps, but otherwise followed the recipe. The combination of veggies is really delicious, and provides a satisfying mix of sweet, tangy, and crunchy. The hummus is traditional and tasty.

Like many others, I made the hummus and not the sandwich. Outstanding. I added extra fresh herbs (dill, cilantro, a touch of rosemary and basil) from my garden. I added extra garlic, sliced and lightly sauteed to mellow out the flavor and added no other oil. Next time, I will omit the salt.

I didn't make the sandwich, but this was a very nice hummus recipe. I followed others' suggestions and used cooking water from the chickpeas (I made my own instead of using canned chickpeas as recipe calls for). I also increased the amount of olive oil and lemon juice and added fresh lemon zest. Delicious with fresh cucumbers and kalamata olives, on a heated pita with feta cheese.

These were so easy, tasty and fresh tasting. The Hummus recipe is amazing, I added a couple dashes of hot sauce to give it a bit more of a kick.

Delicious sandwich with a wonderful combination of flavor and textures! For the hummus, this recipe is accurate, but for deeper flavor, I double the garlic, substitute reserved liquid from the chick peas for the water (!) and add 1 or 2 Tablespoons of toasted pine nuts. Ive never heard of adding onions, but whatever makes this come across the way you like it is what matters!

This is a good recipe for hummus, and just about any combination of veggies can be used. I did it with roasted eggplant, red pepper, onions, and yellow squash, and will try one with the cucumbers, tomatoes, and greek olives next. Very versatile and extremely good.

We LOVE Hummus... order it often when dining out... this was my first attempt to make and was the best we have eaten. Only change to the recipe.. left out the water, added one tablespoon of juice from the chick-peas, which created a great creamy texture and gave it an extra boost of flavor.

didn't make the sandwich, but used the hummus recipe and will continue to--only change i made: left out the water and instead squeezed in the whole lemon (about 3 T.) and added about 2 T. more olive oil. i'm eating it in a pita w/ chopped kalamatas right now...

This was absolutely fabulous! We used a Trader Joe's prepared hummus to speed things along, with cumin added. Also, lahvash is much easier to roll if it's fresh (we have a middle eastern market nearby) ... I'd be inclined to use flour tortillas if fresh lahvash wasn't available.

This is a delicious, authentic-tasting hummus. Any kind of good bread could be used, and other raw vegetables are possible.

Delicious. Try flour tortillas (the large ones, for burritos) instead of the lahvash. I'm sure the lahvash adds a nice flavor, but (a) they're expensive in comparison ($9 per package) and (b) it takes some talent and experience to get them wet enough to be pliable but not so wet they're impossible. I saw the comments below and thought, oh dear, if a soupy mess can be made I can be counted on to make it! Sure enough - I was glad I'd purchased the tortillas as my back-up plan. I secured with toothpicks, cut into pinwheels, and had a smash hit at my picnic. Also note - don't skip the toasted sesame seeds - even though they seem redundant with the tahini in the hummus, they're a nice little accent note.

I make a similar recipe that is a club sandwich. This one would work well like that, too. It has so many colorful veggies, but their eye-appeal probably goes unnoticed in a rolled lavosh! They're more visible in a club sandwich, which make it even more appetizing. The hummus compliments the flavor of all the veggies (I have never seen a hummus recipe with onions either. I prefer to add garlic, but red onions are a great addition to the sandwich itself) and holds the sandwich's layers together. Yum!

Very nice. I had some trouble rolling the sandwiches, though, perhaps in part because I hadn't cut the carrot finey enough. I think next time I might use grated carrot instead. Unfortunately these sandwiches don't keep well at all - the lahvash gets too soggy. I would make this again for the right occasion, but probably not on a regular basis. As for the question of whether or not to use onions in hummus: I have had hummus in various Middle Eastern countries and have never tasted onions in it. That doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad idea, but I wouldn't try it in these sandwiches as they already contain a good amount of raw onion.

Where are the onions? i have read all these recipes on hummus, but all of them leave the onions out. i always cook the chick peas myself. never use salt when boiling the garbanzos, just use water and some bay leaves. i cut up some (regular white) onions and lots of garlic, cook them with a good pinch of salt (a good tip- keeps the onions from browning) in olive oil. i add some ground cummin and cook for a few minutes before adding the drained chick peas and some water. i let it all boil for a bit. then i add some lemon juice and tahini before purèeing the mix. as i often make big portions that i freeze, i add chopped coriander, cayenne pepper etc just before serving. i find that cooking everything before purèeing makes the hummus even more tasty. and the onions add a nice cream to the purè. happy cooking!

I loved these sandwiches. I actually made a different hummus recipe from this site that I love. These were my vegan-option tea sandwiches at a tea party. I used smaller lavash pieces and cut those up into 3 or 4 little rolls secured with a toothpick - so great! The sweet onion and radish really makes them tasty.

I love this hummus recipe. It is easy to make and tastes great. I use more garlic than the recipe calls for and I took the advice of one of the other reviewers and use cilantro instead of parsley. It is great. I make it all the time. I throw all of the ingredients in a blender and it is done. Only thing I found was leaving too many cilantro stems left a lot of strings that get wrapped around the blender blade. So primarly use the leaves.

I made this recipe for a baby shower, and what wasn't gobbled up on the spot went home with the mom-to-be and my cohostess. As for the tahini - I left it out of the hummus - I always do; but the cumin and the parsley were nice touches. I also skipped the sesame seeds, purely out of time constraint. These are especially great to eat if you have been eating lots of bad food and you feel you need something healthy to restore yourself with.

I made just the hummus after reading the rave reviews and didn't like it at all. It was very heavy on tahini, too thick and had a slightly bitter taste. I should say that I left out the parsley and cumin, but I don't think they would have helped the cause. There are better hummus recipes out there.

This is as good as the hummus at our favorite restaurant, Euphemia Haye, on Longboat Key, FL. I substituted 3 chopped scallions for the parsley and have gotten rave reviews.

Perfect for beach sandwiches. Healthy, delicious, and refreshing. The sandwiches were a hit -- despite my not having the time to add onion or sesame seeds and my being a sloppy jelly-roller.

Haven't tried the sandwiches yet, but the hummus is wonderful. I add black olives and red pepper, also extra olive oil - everyone loves it.

I added two extra cloves of garlic and a couple slices of roasted red pepper to the hummus. It was quite flavorful alone but the crunchiness and different flavors of the cuke and radish and sprouts made this a great sandwich. Even my health food-hating boyfriend liked it!

I used store bought hummus to save time. Also added some store bought tabouli added as a thin layer. It went together quickly and made great picnic fare. I'm sure the homemade hummus would make it even better.

I used this recipe just for the hummus and it was the best I've ever eaten. My family agrees--I've made it three times already this week. I am planning to try the sandwich soon. This is a winner.

I made only the hummus for a party and substituted roasted red pepper for the parsley. It was SUCH a hit! This is the best hummus recipe I've come across, by far. Now I'll try the sandwich part!
