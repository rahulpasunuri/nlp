This is a great recipe! I am not a good cook but I was charged to bring a salad to a celebration. This looks beautiful when served and many people have asked for the recipe - a first for me!

This sounds so good, but seemed to me to be a waste of a good avocado.

This IS simply delicious. It not only looks delicious and graces the table, bit it is delicious! I was sent this recipe from my sister who has made it and loved it and I have made it twice in the past 2 weeks. I made the recipe exactly as it stands and wouldn't change or alter a thing. I added the avocado last though as I was sure to forget it and it did not brown. Simply delicious!
