I made this cake before finding these reviews. Whenever I bake a cake, I always check it about 5-7 minutes before the baking time in a recipe. Sure enough, the cake was finished in 38 minutes (and my gas oven is calibrated). I used a dark roast coffee, as I didn't have a true espresso, for the batter. Instead of chocolate chips, I used Guittard Cappuccino chips and I added pecans. I also used 1/2 the amount of bourbon (as I don't drink bourbon and was a little nervous). The cake turned out flavorful and very moist, so those who complained of dryness must've overbaked it. Plus, I never overbeat batter, which was in the directions...or cake can be dense and/or chewy. The glaze... wow, I could eat that alone...or even over ice cream. Very, very good. The bourbon didn't overpower the cake or glaze at all. It enhanced it. It's a keeper and doesn't deserve the bad reviews. Just watch how long it bakes by checking it sooner than later.

I made this cake for Christmas day dessert, big disappointment-the cake was dry and did not have a good flavor. Next time I will check the reviews before tackling a new recipe.

After trying this cake once, I've had it for my birthday every year since. It's moist and delicious. I've never found it to be dry at all.

Due to other reviews, I didn't attempt the cake; however, I made the glaze and used it on my Apple cake, and it was fabulous! Everyone wanted the recipe for the glaze.

Yuck -- dry cake, poor flavor overall. The glaze wasn't bad but it couldn't make up for the lousy cake. This one goes to show that you can't judge a recipe by its title. It sounded so promising -- what a letdown. Don't waste your time -- make something else.

I also found this cake to be dry, but I really think it was due to too much time in the oven. I thought the flavors were great and it looked pretty, so I'll try it again.

Very disappointed - I should have looked at this website before attempting to try this recipe. Too strong of a coffee flavor.

I found the recipe easy to make, the only changes I would make is to put the glaze on while the cake was warm and lower cooking time for my oven.

Cake was very moist, dense and a hit with others. Glaze was a little sweet would have preferred a creamy chocolate glaze

I did find the cake a little dry, I thought maybe I had baked it to long. I think I will play with the ingredients. My friend likedd it very much - with a good helping of vanilla ice-cream.

I was really disappointed in this recipe - ingredients added up as well as my time. We found the cake dry, the glaze thin - very uninspiring. It sat on the refrigerator shelf for a week or so and then was dumped in the trash. Not a good sign from a family who loves sweets.

I was really disappointed with this cake. I followed the recipe to the letter and found the bourbon flavor much too strong and the texture much too dry.
