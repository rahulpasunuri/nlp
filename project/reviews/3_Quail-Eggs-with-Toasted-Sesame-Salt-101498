Interesting way to use up sesame seeds. I think more salt would have been appropriate to call the dip "sesame salt". I had to quarter the recipe and I used mixed black-and-white sesame seeds, which I think makes a different, perhaps more musty flavour.

To chickensoup52: Save the largest, most appealing sections of eggshells and use as a decorative garnish around the edge, atop spring greens perhaps?

I made these for Easter dinner. I left a bit of the beautiful shell on each egg, and my guests were a bit uncomfortable peeling even that amount. I gave it three forks instead of two because of the sesame salt, which is fabulous. I used the extra on steamed asparagus the next night, which was delicious. If I could figure out how to present the eggs with the beautiful shell, but not make my guests uncomfortable, I would make them again. I will definitely make the sesame salt again.

This system produces excellent hard boiled quail eggs, tender with fully cooked yokes. I have used the method 3 times, but for deviled quail eggs. I cannot comment on the salt sesame dip.
