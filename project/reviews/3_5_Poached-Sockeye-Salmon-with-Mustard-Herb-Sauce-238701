This was very good made with a piece of salmon fillet from TJs. Served with the Lemon Couscous with Peas and Carrots from this site. They worked together beautifully. So easy!

I used one half bottle of chardonnay with 32 oz. low sodium chicken broth, 2 bay leaves, 8 peppercorns, 2 celery stalks and one sweet onion quartered for poaching. Sauce was 1 cup mayo, 1/2 cup Greek yogurt, 2 tbsp.Dijon mustard and 1 tbsp Zatarains creole grainy mustard. I had to use what was on hand and we loved it. Will serve to family and guests often.

The sauce was bland. I kicked it up with a little white balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper. Not worth the cost of buying the fresh herbs.
