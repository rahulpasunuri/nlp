Having a grandmother that came to the US from Galway (alone) in 1903....I appreciate soda bread...this is exceptional....better than any other that I have made over the years....just spectacular....onto making another loaf this morning....thank you for the recipe.

Invest in the cast iron skillet. I know the recipe says oven-safe, but there is nothing that will cook more evenly and nothing else that will be more afforadable! In this case, I purchased one of Emeril's, but i have purchased Lodge in the past with similar results. UGH! What can I NOT say about this recipe.....it's absolutely perfect. Follow the directions to the "t" and you will have one DELICIOUS bread on your hands. I always pair this one with maple butter. After researching it online and trying a few things myself....yeah......go with the maple butter. If you do not have maple butter, then at least try to use pure honey. Wow.....I'm drooling just thinking about my next slice.

I used two cups of whole wheat flour, three cups of white flour, and I soaked the raisins ( a mix of black and golden) in whiskey. I baked the bread in a bundt pan for about an hour. Yummy!

Thanks to some of the other comments, I made this with four cups plain white flour, one cup of wholemeal flour. In addition, I added a heaping tablespoon of molases. This bread is to die for!!!! I have always loved my mothers soda bread, but will make this in future!!!

This was outstanding! Followed other reviewers' notes as follows: Halved the recipe, used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose, and baked in a greased 9 x 5 metal loaf pan at 350 for 53 minutes. It was PERFECT, and served as a great compliment to the Easy Split Pea Soup, also from this site.

This soda bread is both authentic and delicious. I have been making it for almost as long as it has been published. It's a nice way to pay tribute to those who were affected by 9/11. To the reviewer who mentioned "dark soda bread" you might to try adding molasses to the recipe in place of half of the sugar. My dad is from Ireland and he always talks about treacle bread which is basically brown bread using whole wheat flour and molasses. It's good, and this is a great base recipe to experiment from.

When my husband and I were in Ireland this summer, we frequently were served "dark soda bread" in restaurants and B&Bs. The bread varied from place to place, but was always delicious. This recipe comes close to the bread we had in Ireland. I replaced 3 of the 5 cups of all purpose flour with whole wheat, and reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup, but made no other changes. I baked the dough in 2 medium loaf pans, and the results were delicious. (The glass loaf pan was done in 47 minutes, the metal loaf pan at 53 minutes) We've already eaten a half a loaf! I plan to marinate the raisins in Irish Whiskey and make three smaller loaves for Christmas gifts. I'll wrap them in dish towels from Ireland. I will try this recipe with 100% whole wheat flour some time in the future.

I'm not Irish enough to say whether this is authentic, but I sure hope so, because I'll be making it again and claiming it. Easy to make, and delicious. Our first loaf disappeared within 15 minutes, and thank God we had a second one ready.

Really liked this recipe. Used currants instead of raisins, soaked them in a little hot water first to plump them up. Didn't quite use 2 1/2 cups because that seemed like sooo much, but next time I would probably go for it.

Great recipe. Added peel and juice of 1 orange to kick it up a notch. Fantastic!

I like this but made some substitutions to suit my palate. I soaked the raisins in whisky overnight then drained them before adding to recipe. Because of the flavor from the drunk raisins, I cut the sugar in half. I omitted the egg as I really didn't see the need for it, protein-wise, or binding-wise. Turned out just fine. I'll continue to use this as a launch pad soda bread recipe.

This is the second year I've made this recipe--everyone loved it last year. This year, I added about 3 tablespoons of butter to make it a little richer. I substituted about 1/2 cup of flour for whole wheat and another for whole wheat pastry flour. I added slightly more butttermilk--about 1/8 cup. I used currants instead of raisins. I used all of the caraway seeds--yum! And I used just a little less than the 1 cup of sugar. I formed into 3 loaves: one in a castiron skillet, one in an Emile Henri pie plate, one in a regular round cake pan. I cooked them a little too long, but pulled them out around 45 minutes. Very brown on the bottom--okay, dark brown. But still getting great reviews!

I love this recipe and make it every year. Also, love the idea of the bundt pan instead of the iron skillet. Makes a nicer presentation and easier to serve. I actually just made miniature bundt cake breads that turned out really well - baked for 45 minutes. Always get rave reviews.

I have made this recipe at least 50 times and I think of the chef who died on September 11th and his mother every time. I've loved this recipe from the first time I made it. I've never changed a thing, except once, I added dried cranberries instead of raisins as a favor to a friend.

Very easy to make and very delicious!! I changed one cup of all purpose flour for whole wheat flour, used a little more buttermilk because i find that the whole wheat flour absorbs a lot more liquid, and lastly I used a 5.5quart dutch oven instead of a skillet. Thank so much for the recipe I will use it again and again!

I made this gluten free, substituting C4C gluten free flour for the all purpose flour. It came out perfectly and tastes great! Like a lot of folks, I cut the caraway, using about half the amount in the recipe. I cooked it in 2 cake pans, 40 minutes seemed just right as another reviewer suggested. Tastes just like my mom's, but moister!

Great recipe, simple and quick to put together for a St. Patrick's Day party. I went freeform without a pan (mainly because I didn't have one, but I also noticed the other Irish soda bread recipes didn't use one) and baked it on greased parchment paper - and it was great. Huge hit! Would definitely make again - though I might divide it in two next time, as it makes a pretty big loaf.

Rating: 4
I admit I was nervous about making this because while I am an experienced baker I do not typically make bread. The first thing I want to note is that I used 2- 8" round cake pans, and it was done in 30 minutes, perhaps could have even come out at 25. Following some other tips I used a little more than a whole stick of butter, reduced the sugar just a tad and reduced to 2 TB of the Caraway since my boyfriend is not a big fan. I found this to be absolutely delicious, and in keeping with the trend of "you either love soda bread or you don't" my boyfriend thought it was good but wasn't excited about it. I made this 6 days ago and just ate the last piece for breakfast and it was still yummy! I will definitely make this a part of all my St Patrick's Days in the future...and now and then just for fun.

This is a wonderful recipe! A few moderations: I cut the sugar down to 3/4 c. and it is plenty sweet, I cut the caraway seeds down to 2 Tbsp, and I used currants instead of raisins. I also filled two 10" cake pans, instead of one skillet, because it is such a large recipe. It came out fantastic! I highly recommend it.

At altitude, I added about 1/4 cup more buttermilk to compensate for evaporation. I also went with about 4 teaspoons caraway (instead of 3 tablespoons, which seemed a lot), and a mixture of golden and dark raisins. I divided this into 2 5"x9" buttered loaf pans, and baked for 1 hour 5 minutes (testing at 55). Came out perfectly. My wife thinks it's the best soda bread she's had so far. I love the butter flavor with the raisins, and to my taste, just the right amount of caraway.

Rating: 4
Call me irresponsible, but I added another 1/2 stick of butter to the recipe. The mixture seemed way too dry with only the one stick, so I thought it might've been a mistake. The end result was fantastic! I even converted a soda bread hater.

I love this recipe. I've been making it for 5 years now and it always gets rave reviews. I omit the caraway simply because I don't much care for the flavor. The buttermilk keeps it wonderfully moist. No hard, dry bread here. Unless I know I will be making several loaves, I use dry buttermilk instead of fresh. I think the texture actually comes out a little bit better that way.

My sister and I have been making Irish Soda Bread over the years. Both sets of our grandparents came from Ireland and we grew up tasting different versions of Irish Soda bread, some better than others. I do like this recipe and I make it in 2 cake pans and check it after 40 minutes. My sister died last year at age 53 from lung cancer, I've made this bread 3 times since...and I think of her each time.

This was excellent and very easy to make. I reduced the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup and the raisins to 1 cup because the given amounts seemed excessive. I would make it again exactly the same way. This makes a HUGE loaf!!! It would serve 10-12 people quite generously!

I'm reviewing this recipe for my husband. I already wrote my own review of what I thought of it a few reviews back. Here's what he thought now that his cold is gone and he can taste again: He said he wouldn't request it again because it seemed more like a cake to him than Irish soda bread. He said its very sweet. He did however give it 3 forks.

this is one of the best soda breads I've ever made! I soaked the raisins in hot water (I HATE whiskey) and made this the day before st pats day. I separated the recipe into 2 cake pans instead of a large one, and 2 of my sons went through one of them in about an hour!

P.S. I just answered my own question from the previous review, This is not an 'authentic Irish' recipe, I noticed that it was written that this is an Irish/American recipe so mystery solved. It's still tastes good regardless of how authentic it is in my opinion.

I halved the recipe because its only my husband and I. I used a 10 1/2 inch cast iron pan which held the halved batter perfectly. The results were good but I don't know if they're authentic. Most of the other Irish soda bread recipes I've seen don't call for any sugar and if they did call for it at all its only one tsp. This recipe here has a LOT of sugar. Is it supposed to be this sweet? I used raisins soaked in whisky as some others suggested, it made them very moist.Everything else I did exactly as written. The bread itself tasted like a sweet rye bread with raisins in it. I find this recipe tastes very good with butter on it and has a nice texture, the outer hard crust is nice. My husband was indifferent to it but he has a cold and is unable to taste things very well right now.

I live at 7000 ft in the mountains of Northern New Mexico, and I routinely make adjustments to recipes for baked goods...this time I forgot to. The bread came out just right with no changes to the recipe! I baked it in my old ten-inch cast-iron skillet. Perfection!

Delicious (& easy!) Soda Bread recipe! I made this for my grandparents who are used to traditional Irish Soda Bread. They both loved it and were pleased to see the hard crust on top as many don't have that. I used fat free buttermilk and baked a large & small loaf both in loaf pans. Yum!

This recipe is remarkably similar to Brother Curry's Irish Soda Bread from the Secrets of Jesuit Breadmaking, which I discovered when it was being demonstrated at Bloomingdales Aventura in March 2009. It is as follows: 5 cups sifted all-purpose unbleached flour, 3/4 cup sugar, 2 teaspoons baking powder, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, 1 teaspoon baking soda, 1/4 pound (1 stick) butter, 2 1/2 cups mixed light and dark raisins soaked in water for 15 to 20 minutes and drained, 3 tablespoons caraway seeds, 2 1/2 cups buttermilk, 1 large egg, slightly beaten. I bake it in 2 9" cake pans. Just scrape the dough directly into the pans. Couldn't be simpler and it is delicious!

I made a few substitutions to suit what I had on hand and the tastes of my friends, and it was greeted with rave reviews and beggings for more. I substituted one cup of the white flour for buckwheat flour, curdled some vanilla soymilk with apple cider vinegar since I didn't have buttermilk, added a little more sugar (since this was for dessert), didn't have caraway or raisins, but added cinnamon & some mini chocolate chips. It went great with coffee and tea for dessert on this damp, dreary night. Not at all traditional, I know, but since it turned out so well, I wanted to share.

This is an awesome recipe! I made it as is with one exception -- my bread was done after 48 minutes of baking, maybe due to using a 12" skillet? This recipe is a definite keeper!!

Delicious. I made this recipe because I had lost my mother-in-laws recipe that I used last year. My downstairs neighbor who is a chef LOVED IT!!! I ended up sending him home with half the loaf. The caraway seeds make all the difference. Baked it in my cast iron skillet and came out perfect. Cut time by 5 or 10 minutes because my stove bakes a bit faster than usual. Just keep an eye on it during the baking process. Will make again even before next St. Patrick's Day!!!!

Wonderful flavor and texture. Only complaint is that it spilled over in my 10" cast iron. Will no doubt make again but in the alternate 12" pan they suggested. Only change I made was using fennel seed instead of caraway as I love the fennel/raisin combo.

I made this bread for St. Pat's dinner this year. It was super easy and the flavor was wonderful. I made it according to recipe with two exceptions: first, I used only 1/2 cup of sugar because I didn't want it too sweet (1/2 cup was great, and I may even use a little less next time, say 1/3). Second, I used only 1 T. of caraway seeds since I have never cooked with it and wasn't sure what flavor it would add. I think 1 T. was plenty for me. It had a great flavor and I imagine it would have been too seedy for me if I had added all three tablespoons. I loved the crunchy crust and the overall flavor of the bread. I wish the bread had been slightly more dense or moist as it was somewhat crumbly. I made it in my cast iron skillet and wonder if maybe I could have done with 5-10 minutes less cooking time (might have been why it was crumbly). I will definitely make this again, though. It was enough bread to serve 20 people. I cut it into thirds and stuck two loaves in my freezer.

This is wonderful  love it warmed up for breakfast with a little butter and strawberry jam on it. I use a cast-iron skillet and it turns out lovely. I definitely think it is better served warm. I take it out just a few minutes early so it doesnt get too dry & cover with foil towards the end of cooking to prevent over-browning.

Good ISB. I already ate 2 pieces! Certainly cake-y. After mixing everything found it was way too soupy so added another 1/2C+ of flour. Used vinegar/milk to substitute for the buttermilk. Baked it in a 12" cast iron skillet. Only baked it for 45 minutes, but it was certainly done. I would make it again. Slainte!

Just pulled this out of the oven 1/2 hour ago and it is AMAZING!! Did not wait to cut it up. Slathered it with butter and enjoyed!! I used slightly less raisins and caraway seeds and the flavor of both was still prominent. It is a sweet, almost cake like bread. Brought it over to my neighbor... she took one bite and was impressed and wanted to know "Whats in this?". I did not cook in a skillet. I broke it into two loaves, piled the dough into 2 mounds on a greased/cornmeal coated cookie sheet. I wanted the traditional looking loaf. They came slighly flatter than desired but no big deal. Make and enjoy!!

I love soda bread and it's a must have on my St. Patrick's Day menu. I decided to try this recipe this year and it was really good. The dough was a little too sticky and I should have added a little more flour to it. It turned out a little cakey and not as dense as I generally prefer. But the flavor was delightful and every loved it and went in for seconds on it. I did love making it in the cast iron skillet - that was a nice way to have it keep it's shape.

I have made a few different soda breads over the years and this was the best ever. I served it to my family tonight as we had our St Paddys dinner today. Every one was amazed by it. Sent 1/2 of the huge loaf home with my daughter, along with the recipe as my Irish daughter & her Dutch husband couldn't get enough of it. I only had 2 tlbs of caraway seeds, but the flavor came through. I used 1/2 regular & 1/2 golden raisins which worked well. I used a 12in cast iorn skillet for this, & when I told my daughter that is what I used she commented that she did not have any well seasoned cast iron pans(mine came to me from my mother & they are older than I am 54). She then asked when she could have mine & I said over my dead body. Her remark was I'll take them at the wake. I then replied well maybe you can have them when I decide to quit cooking, her response, like I said, I'll get them at the wake. Can you tell we like to cook in this family?

Before anyone gets upset, I'll admit up front that the substitutions I used do not make for anything like a traditional bread. I adapted it to suit the tastes of the folks I was cooking for (which I think even the most Irish among us must do at least once in a while!). I did want a sweet bread, so I increased the amount of sugar a little, substituted dark chocolate chunks for the raisins, and added cinnamon instead of caraway. I also sprinkled the top with some raw sugar before I put it in the oven. Additionally, I substituted 1 1/2 cups of the flour for buckwheat flour. I took the advice of the reviewer who suggested grating the butter while it was still cold. The bread did indeed come out very tender. I didn't have any buttermilk, so I used some apple cider vinegar to curdle the milk. It came out amazing, was easy to put together, and got rave reviews, even from the friend who swore up and down he hated soda bread. I'd definitely make this again without all the sugar, for a more breadish, less cakeish accompaniment to a meal.

My bread just came out of the oven and I knew it was going to be good based on the smell throughout the house. First off, let me say that I used half golden raisins and half regular. I used 1 cup of buttermilk and a cup and a half of 1%. And finally I used 3 T of fennel seeds instead of caraway. Those were all necessary substitutions so I wouldn't have to go to the store. I just tasted the bread and it is great. Very flavorful but the fennell is quite a nice touch. Not overpowering at all. I had to quickly put it in the freezer before I ate the whole loaf (and a stick of butter). I will serve it next Tuesday - St. Patrick's Day. YUM!!!

This is easily the best Irish Soda Bread I have ever produced (and I've tried multiple recipes over the years). Baked in a cast iron skillit it looks entertainingly like a muffin top for a giant (in fact, the only downside to this recipe is that it makes a truly family sized loaf...I baked one and used it for two holiday dinnere and still had leftovers...which I made into bread pudding). But it was simple and quick to make, and the texture is truly lovely and worth all the leftovers... (as a sidenote: I used the Alton Brown trick of grating the butter while cold then only rubbing it in a tiny bit...so that may have contributed to the tender texture since it reduced the amount I had to work the dough.)

Simply delicious. I made this exactly as written, using a cast-iron pan, and it came out perfectly. Everyone raved over it, both plain and with butter, and it is going to be my new signature dish to take to potlucks. Couldn't have been easier to make, too. Highly recommended.

I made this recipe exactly as written (except I omitted the Caraway)for a St. Patrick's day dinner. It was a huge hit. Since then I have made it twice more at the request of friends and will make it again for a baby shower next month. The second time I made it, I split it into two smaller pans, a bundt pan and a basic cake pan. I thought it is did not turn out as well but I might have over cooked it a tad. I switched back to the cast iron pan and again it was perfect. Super easy and my friend actually told people to stop eating it so she could take home the leftovers.

I made this recipe for Easter Dinner and everyone loved it. My only recommendation is to either bake it in two separate loaves or use a large skillet. My barely 10 in one seemed too small. Also, I substituted dried apricot, papaya and pineapple for the raisins since my kids hate raisins and it was very good.

Great Recipe. Caraway and raisin is a traditional Irish combination and is both a bit unusual and delicious. Like other cooks, I cut back on the sugar, as I wished more of a dinner bread not "cake." I kneaded the dough for a little, which made the texture a bit more scone/bread like. Sugar on top was nice.

This recipe has become my regular soda bread: it's super easy, and comes out wonderful everytime! I particularly like the cake-like consistency, as well as the combination of raisins and caraway.

You might also consider sprinkling a handful of sugar in the raw on top just before baking--I like the sweet crunch it adds.

One problem I have with this recipe is the same my Grandma from Newry would feel about most Irish breads that emigrate to the U.S. "It's supposed to be bread not cake," she would say. Now I'm sure there's room for many soda breads but I lean towards her idea. So, to make this "bread" bread, I simply halved both the sugar and raisins. It rivaled her breads and she made several types often especially Barmbrack. Even though Irish soda breads are generally easier to make anyway, this one can't be simpler to put together. Somehow, it stays moist as well. In case your breads dry too quickly a day later, place the bread in a plastic bag and zap it in a microwave oven for a few seconds. It will revive quite nicely. This version also toasts well.

I loved this recipe. I took the Bread to a dinner at my cousin's. They devoured it. It was pretty to look at and delicious tasting. I baked it in a 10" cake pan with 2" sides. Perfect. I did bake it for about 15 minutes longer than the recipe called for. The center was not cooked at 1 hr. 15 minutes. I will repeat this recipe again and again and share it with friends.

Yum! Substituted about a cup of the raisins with dried cranberries. I used my 12" non- stick skillet which worked really well. Glad to hear that others substituted some wheat flour as I was feeling a bit guilty about all that AP flour. Accidentally added an extra 1/2 tsp of baking soda & it was fine - I think it even added a little extra zing. Delicious, moist, & great balance of flavor.

Finally an Irish soda bread recipie I'd make again! I haven't been able to stop eating it since it came out of the oven this morning. I did substitute 1 cup of wheat flour for the white, used currants instead of raisins and only 2T of caraway seeds, but either way I imagine it would be delicious.

I was looking for the best ISB recipe and this one was recommended. So easy to make (no kneading required), and it came out moist and flavorful. I subbed golden raisins for regular. My mother in law said, "It's just like the bread my Irish grandmother used to make." This one's a keeper!

This is a terrific recipe and very easy. I used 4c. AP flour and 1c. whole wheat flour and it worked very well. This bread makes great breakfast toast the next day. Another great use for my trusty cast iron skillet!

Absolutely love it ! I over-cooked this time and came out little dry.. but will be more careful next times.. this is more delicious than the other irish soda bread recipes. Perhaps it is the egg ! defnetly a KEEPER !!

A WONDERFUL soda bread! I will definitely make again. Other soda bread recipes I have tried turn out too dry, but this was moist and delicious. This makes a huge loaf; next time I will halve the recipe (and adjust skillet size accordingly). Very easy to make.

This was a delicious bread. I omitted the caraway and next time might lessen the raisins (although my husband thought it was just the right amount of raisins). I loved baking in the 10-12 inch skillet and it came out perfect in the time specified. I also added a little bit of green food coloring since we were going to a St. Pat's party. It was a cheesy but cute touch. YUM!

This was my first experience with Soda Bread. I followed the instructions exactly and it worked beautifully. This makes a huge loaf - great for a crowd.I might reduce caraway seeds in the future. Fun and easy to prepare.

I made this last weekend with Lamb Stew and Champ. And I brought a loaf to work on Monday. Both times this bread got rave reviews ... very moist & the raisins & caraway seeds complement each other so well. Enjoy!

Really easy and delicious! I served it with the corned beef and champ recipes from this website and it was a perfect meal. Plenty of leftovers to send home with guests.

I used Spelt flour as I don't tolerate regular wheat well. I also had currants instead of raisins, and reduced the quantity to 2 cups. I only had course salt and salted butter so reduced salt to 3/4tsp. Baked in my 30 year old cast iron pan with 3" sides, this cake turned out fabulously. I'm thrilled to now have a Spelt sida bread recipe SOOO yummy with the wickedly wonderful combo of caraway and currant. Oh, and I used 3/4 cup brown sugar instead of 1 c. white.

My condolences to the author and her family on their tragic loss. Thank you for sharing your thoughts. Concerning the recipe, I agree with the comments of several others that this is a very good soda bread, moist and delicious. Several specific remarks 1.) The recipe struggles somewhat in its sweetness -- either it should be more or less so. I have experimented somewhat with more or less sugar with good results. 2.) While I appreciate the novelty of using an iron skillet, I have found this bread bakes more evenly in a bundt pan. However, one looses the traditional Irish cross pattern 3.) I prefer the texture of crushed caraway via a mortar and pestle rather than the seeds. One should cut down the amount with this method. 4.) Lastly, I prefer the raisans first soaked in an anise-flavored liquor. Jagermeister and Sambuca both perform admirably. I imagine Ouzo would also work. Enjoy.

This is "magically delicious" soda bread! I made two loaves of this -- one for my family and one for work -- and so needed 5 cups of raisins. I ran out of raisins (I used a mixture of black and golden ones), and so filled in with dried cranberries, which turned out to be a wonderful variation. My dough was more like batter, so when I cut an X in the to of the bread just before it went into the oven, it didn't "take" well, so halfway through baking I re-cut the X and it split just perfectly. Patricia, I'm so sorry about your stepbrother. I can sense your love for him, though, in what you wrote. And this is a lovely way to honor him, sharing this soul-warming, comforting recipe with us all. God bless you and your family, and thank you.

HANDS DOWN: the very best Irish Soda Bread I have EVER made. Moist and flavorful. I will use no other recipe for Irish Soda bread (except this one) from now on!!! Besides, it's a beautiful presentation coming out of the cast iron skillet! PS to mix the butter in with the dry ingredients, I used the food processor. Very easy. Sorry that I learned about the recipe as a result of the tragedy of Sept. 11.

A keeper though my kids refused to let me use the caraway seeds. This makes an ample loaf..enough to generously feed 8-10. Used a "crusenet"-type casserole which reduced cooking time by 15 min. Lovely bread. Will make again before St. Patrick's Day of 2006!

My first shot at making Irish Soda Bread...and it was a success with this recipe! Followed directions to the 't' (though omitted the caraway seeds and used 2 cups of currants instead). Used 10 in. cast-iron skillet, and the 1 hr. 15 min. was perfect timing. A nice start for a Happy St. Patrick's Day (or any day!) !

By far the best Irish Soda Bread I have ever made or had anywhere.

I had a recipe that was handed down(over 100 years) from an Irish cook, but this recipe is better. The addition of 1 stick of butter and an egg made it easier for mixing. Very moist and enjoyed by my family and friends.

Very good. Next time, I will follow the advice of the Santa Barbara cook and omit the caraway, glaze the top and sprinkle with slivered almonds. This was very easy to mix up in the kitchen aid mixer - no elbow grease involved. Baked in a dark skillet, it rises very tall and looks marvelous!

I made a double batch of this recipe... one loaf for my dad who loves irish soda bread, and one loaf for my husband and I. Everyone thought this bread was great. It is just sweet enough, and has a nice moist texture. Tastes wonderful! We're still eating the two batches that I made this weekend, but I'll make more when that's gone. Definetely a keeper.

This Irish Soda Bread is great! I made it for St. Patricks day and everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. I did not have the type of pan the recipie called for, but used a springform pan and it not only tasted wonderful, it looked great!! Thank you for sharing this recipie!

Ever the deviant, I left the caraway seeds out and the bread was wonderful. Next time I make it I may add toasted slivered almonds and drizzle a sugar glaze/frosting over the top. This makes great breakfast bread.

Thank you for sharing the recipe and your story. I'm so sorry for your loss. The bread was very good. Two observations - I cut back on the caraway - it's like nutmeg -too much can overwhelm the recipe. Also baked in 10 inch skillet, which I think was too small - the center didn't quite bake through, but the edges overbaked. I'm using a convection oven and 325 degrees. Once I get this corrected, the recipe will become one of our favorites - and every time I bake it, I will think of your step brother...

First, I want to express my sympathy to the family for their loss on that horrific day. It was wonderful of you to share the story behind the recipe. As for the bread, I would give it five forks, if possible. It is the absolute best Irish Soda Bread that I have ever eaten. I made and served it this year on St. Patrick's Day, and all of us agreed that it is delicious. I baked it in an iron skillet, with the temperature lowered to 325, since the skillet is black and absorbs heat. It took a bit longer to bake than specified, but perhaps that was because I cooked it in our fifth-wheel RV oven, which isn't as reliable as a home oven. It was beautifully browned and crusty on the outside, but moist inside. Thanks again for sharing the recipe. Everyone who likes Irish Soda Bread should try this one.

Patty and Mrs. O'Leary, thanks for your story and for your recipe. Both are delicious. So sorry for your loss. I think that stories like this, as well as good home cooking will help us all heal and be aware that there are bad guys out there. See you at GSS.

I loved this soda bread and so did everyone else at the table. It was fanstastic. Thank you Mrs. O'Leary.

I too lost a loved one on September 11, 2001, my dear nephew Peter O'Neill, as well as 65 additional beloved employees who worked at my husband's firm, Sandler O'Neill & Partners. Not only was this recipe wonderful but each time I share it with anyone I will tell them the source so that Jerry O'Leary and the day he died will always be remembered especially on St.Patrick's day and always.

I made this recipe for the first time about a month ago and have made it five times since. It was the closest recipe to my mother's soda bread, only she never had a recipe to follow. It was a hit each and every time. I made two of them this weekend for the Irish relatives who were in town and they all loved it. I did omit the caraway because I'm not a fan of caraway.

I cut this recipe in half (except used one egg and only 1 Tbsp. of caraway). I'm sure the batter was a little more wet than what the whole recipe would be. I baked it in a 9 inch round pan for 35 minutes. It was yummy. Not as "pebbly" as other Irish breads I've had, but still very good.

Made this for my Irish in-laws for St. Pat's this year (we always host the dinner: 11 lbs. of corned beef was demolished). It was really really popular and i ended up giving away the recipe print-out that night plus another family member copied it down. i had some leftover buttermilk so i made a half recipe later that same week. i used a pie plate once and a skillet once, they were both fine and tasty. i didn't use the raisins (as it was a dinner) and i halved or less the caraway seeds (eyeballed it).

Easy, delicious, moist, wonderful. I got the crust a little too dark the first time, so I put it on a higher rack in the oven. I also covered it with foil halfway through the baking time. It came out perfectly.

I'm planning to try this recipe. Would it work just as well if I don't bake it in a skillet?

I halved the recipe and left out the caraway seeds. Don't really care for them. Turned out great. I tried another soda bread from this site and thought it was good but I think this one is better. Its great toasted with a litte butter. Great in the morning.

Yum! I made this for St. Patrick's Day and I can't stop eating it. I added 1 cup of sultanas and 1 cup of dried cranberries, and that was plenty (I didn't need the extra 1/2 cup). I also omitted the caraway, as I don't care for it. It's fantastic for breakfast or a snack toasted with a touch of butter, cream cheese or jam.

This recipe was great and I would definitely make it again! I did leave out the caraway seeds (didn't have any), but was very pleased even so. It looked like a lot of raisins, but they all went in and it was perfect. I was told it was the best soda bread anyone had had.

The love between a mother and son will not be forgotten and neither will this recipe. It will be around for a long time! Great presentation and texture. I used Craisins instead of raisins and brushed top with melted butter when I took it out of the oven. I used the caraway seeds. They really give it a nice flavor & everyone loved it.

Very easy to make. We substituted craisins (dried cranberries) for raisins since I am not so fond of raisins. It turned out very well and received praise from my relatives of Irish heritage.
