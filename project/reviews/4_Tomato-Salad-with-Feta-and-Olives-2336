The lack of spice in this makes it pale next to other fresh tomato salad recipes. There are many other similar ones out there with better taste.

This is THE recipe for summer tomatoes. I added garden cukes & capers. It's the standard now for us. Very easy & spot-on mix of flavors.

This was easy and very good with paper thin slices of red onion. Used rice vinegar and liked it very much. Letting it sit an hour is key.

This is nice and easy and makes a nice presentation. I used fresh basil instead of the parsley and only made half the amount of dressing which seemed like plenty.

I am one of those unfortunate people who love raw onions, but onions don't love me. Instead of using raw onions in this recipe, I carmelized some onions and topped my tomatoes with them, along with a good quality feta and pitted, chopped kalamata olives. The carmelized onions added a lovely smokey-sweet flavour to this dish, and my husband went nuts for it! I also used basil instead of parsley and substituted white balsamic for the red wine vinegar, which is not quite as heavy and sweet as red balsamic. I will get a lot of mileage out of this recipe this summer...

This is sooooooo good! Do yourself a favour and buy the best feta you can find. (preferably Greek/goat's milk)

I make this alot but always substitute minced or pressed garlic for the onion and its a big hit. Fast, easy, and always gets compliments and requests for the recipie.

Basil goes much better than parsley here. Also added cukes and capers. Use red ripe tomatoes. Excellent and easy salad.

Made it once as written and it was very nice. The second time I made it I made a dressing -- 1/4C olive oil, 1/2C oil-packed sundried-tomatoes, 1/8C balsamic vinegar, 1T drained capers and 1 garlic clove --blended in the blender, then stirred in a good handful of chopped basil and seasoned to taste with salt and pepper. Now THAT was a hit.

I used home grown perfect tomatoes, and half balsamic, half red wine vinegar. Added a little cucumber between the tomoto and onion slice. Delicious. Even my husband - not a tomato fan - loved it.

For my friends who like feta and olives this is great. Some of us prefer it a little more on the Italian side. Buffalo Mozzeralla, basil and put the olives in the Martinis. This is even better.

Delicious. I took the advice of previous reviewers and used basil instead of parsley and added cucumber. I chopped everything into large pieces and served in a bowl -- it looked beautiful and tasted wonderful. Needed generous seasoning with salt and pepper.

Easy and great taste. Excellent summer side dish. Served with a seafood lasagna and asparagus. Made without onions because of non-onion lovers in group and it tasted fine. Used red and orange tomatoes to give it nice color.

I started taking this dish to summer gatherings four years ago, and now I am always asked "Will you bring that tomato salad thing?". I make it so often, I've started 'mixing it up' a bit with variations. I always substitute fresh basil for the parsley in the dressing, as this just adds so much. I sometimes sprinkle 1/3 cup rinsed capers over the top in addition to the Kalamata olives, and tonight, I am adding thin slices of cucumber between each tomato/onion slice. This recipe is summer on a plate! Yum!!

This recipe is great as is. But has to be with fresh homegrowm tomatoes.

As simple as it is, this recipe seems a bit off to me. The red onion was too strong and overpowered the tomato, both in terms of flavor and texture. The parsley wasn't enough--basil would have been a better edition. And balsamic vinegar works better than red wine vinegar for this kind of salad--you need a little more sweet in there.

Still one of the best, and easiest, ways to showcase fresh tomatoes in the summer time...

Very good. Really enjoyed it. Used Vidalla onion but no olives as we don't care for them. The cheese gives it a nice zing.

I make this recipe as is. It's beautiful and delicious! Thank you for the keeper, epicurious!

Wonderful flavor! As suggested by others, I also added capers and fresh basil - great additions! I also agree that althought balsamic is all the rage, for this recipe the red wine viegar is superior.

I prepared the dish with vidalla onions. It was dynomite!! I will probably add a bit of fresh chopped basil the next time around as suggested. It is a very attractive dish and a great addition to any italian meal.

This is recipe is a summer staple in our house. I agree with slicing a little bit ahead. It lets some of the liquid drain off a bit. Word of caution: DO NOT EVER REFRIGERATE A TOMATO. The cold will immediately and permanently ruin the taste and the texture.

This is wonderful! Better even than the other tomato and feta salad!

If you add some sliced green pepper, cucumber and oregano and if you omit the garlic and the parsley then you have the famous Greek salad called "choriatiki". The vinegar is optional.

I made this for the first time for a family get-together. It was quickly devoured, got rave reviews and I had many requests for the recipe. This is a keeper.

The dressing was lacking something even with the garlic and balsamic vinegar.

A gorgeous presentation on a big porcelain, painted platter. I made this (tripled the recipe) for a barbecue, and nine people asked me for the recipe. So fresh, so wonderful, this is food of the Gods. A perfect wine pairing (you will thank me!) is Basa Rueda 1998, from Spain. Only $8.99/bottle retail in Atlanta, its grapefruity subtlety picks up the acidity in the tomatoes, and oooooohhhhhh....Heaven. I added both capers and fresh basil leaves to this dish. I tried a little Balsamic vinegar one night, but found it a little too bitey with all the other fresh, raw ingredients. The red wine vinegar is just the right touch.

This is the BEST tomato salad recipe and has become a standard summer treat for our family AND guests! We love it with fresh basil. You can add capers instead of black olives for something different.

This recipe is great the way it is or if you like the spirit of adventure you can play with it as I have. I have used Balsamic Vinegar and fresh basil and it is wonderful. I am also able to get fresh local goat feta which makes it even better. My family loves this and it has become a favorite when fresh tomatoes come in.
