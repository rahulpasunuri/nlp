I have often made a similar dish, using cucumbers instead of zucchini; but, I will definitely be following this recipe from here on out. Simply delicious!

Quick and delicious. made for a bbq and everyone loved. nothing beats fresh herbs and veggies. increased fresh basil to about 1/3 cup.

I grow zucchini and tomatoes and am always looking for recipes using these ingredients. The only change I made was to soak the onion slices (I used a yellow onion) in ice water for half an hour and then blot dry. This little trick removes some of the "heat" from the onion. When I make this recipe again, I will buy sweet vidalia onions, which do not need to be soaked.
