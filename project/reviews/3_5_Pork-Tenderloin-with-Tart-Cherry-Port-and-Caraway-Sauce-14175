Unusual and really good. I cut the tenderloin into two pieces, used dried cherries plumped up in heated Reunite (no port), and used rosemary instead of caraway (which I hate). Just did it all on the stovetop as I didn't want to heat up the house. Since I didn't have port, I threw in a little sherry to get the fortified flavor. I think you can add water at whatever time, to get your preferred sauciness.

Easy, quick and delicious. I used Trader Joe's bottled sour cherries and they tasted great in the sauce. Followed the recipe otherwise, though taking reviewers' advice I used shallots instead of onions, cooked the pork for far less time and made more sauce. I thought the caraway seeds were a perfect complement to the cherries & port in the sauce. Definitely a keeper.

Ho-hum. I made this for a small dinner party and while the pork came out deliciously tender (a 1.4 lb tenderloin at 400 degrees and 15 minutes), I wasn't a huge fan of the onions in the sauce. I would suggest using shallots for better flavor, texture and presentation. Coarsely chopped and simmered onions just aren't that pretty. The caraway seeds were also an interesting twist on flavor and I thought they stole the show. Next time I'll use sage or rosemary stirred in during the last simmer for better flavorful and compliments.

My husband and I both thought this was fantastic. We did grill the tenderloin (rub with olive oil, salt and pepper)instead of roasting it. I left out the caraway seeds, used dried cherries that I soaked in the port, and after reducing the sauce, added a few Tbsp of cream and let it simmer a few minutes. Very easy, and definitely a repeat!

The flavor was excellent, although I thought the pork was a bit overdone at 155 degrees. Tender, but still overdone. Especially if I am going to reheat leftovers. I think I would cook to 150 and let carryover cooking do the rest. I also had little liquid left over to make a sauce. I think I would double the liquid ingredients and keep the onions the same. I skipped the fennel. Not a big fan. I used dried tart cherries.

I did cut the oven time and I would agree to cut the oven time even more and maybe brine prior. I had to use fresh (from who knows where this time of year, cherries) as there were no frozen. This one came out okay. The big issue was over cooked pork.

This dish was fabulous and quick and easy! I substituted Sherry for the Port, and frozen black cherries for the fruit -- worked great! Oh, and I forgot the caraway seeds but it didn't seem to matter. Word of caution: watch the roasting time; I checked my roast after only 20 minutes and it was already done all the way through. I would recommend checking it after only 12 or 15 minutes if you like your pork done medium.

This is a wonderful flavor combination. It never occurred to me how perfectly caraway, cherry, red vinegar, and tawny port blend. I used dried cherries--1/2 the amount called for the fresh, plus water to cover. I then added that cherry water to the sauce. I found that I didn't have to worry about the sauce amount, like others have mentioned, probably for this reason. I found the sauce flavorful, perhaps, it would have been even more intense without the added water. Maybe next time, I could add more caraway and port, but I felt fully satisfied without doing so. One issue was the cooking time. Once I placed the browned pork into the oven at the set temp, it reached the desired temp in 10 minutes, not 30! I had to turn the oven off and leave the pork in there until my bf arrived anyway. It made the pork tough to cut, but still delicious to eat. I either need to have the browning temp. higher and therefore shorter browning time, so oven time is longer, or only prepare pork when all dining parties are at the house ready to eat. I served this with a simple green salad and mustard vinaigrette; a raw red cabbage, apple, Gorgonzola, toasted caraway, and honey-white wine vinaigrette salad; baked potato; and steamed turban squash.

I took other cooks' advice and doubled the sauce. There wouldn't have been enough if I hadn't. Also, I cooked the pork 5 minutes less. It turned out perfectly. I was leery about the caraway - I don't really like it that much - but it really did add a nice depth of flavor to the sauce. I also chopped up the cherries in the food processor before adding. My daughter really liked this recipe. I thought it was ok, but not worth the time and effort. Doubt I would make it again.

delicious recipe!! now, i altered things a bit, having read the comments already. To start, I was using the boneless pork tenderloin cutlets, because I just cook for myself. So those were done cooking after doing them on the stove, and I didn't actually need to use the oven at all - nice if you're just cooking for 1 or 2. I ended up doubling the liquids, because I thought there was an absurdly low amount of juice that was supposed to cook down, and I added the pork cutlets back in to the sauce, to cook down for ~30 minutes. It was delicious and the flavor really got into the pork. didn't use the caraway seeds. So that's one way to make this for fewer people, and slightly easier! I plan on making this again for a dinner party sometime - perhaps then I will use a real tenderloin!

This recipe was a hit at our last dinner party. I added kumquats to the sauce as well as some white raisins and left out the caraway seeds. This made more sauce so there was enough for seconds.

My wife called to ask what we were doing for dinner while I was out riding with the kids and I just flipped back that we were having pork tenderloin with a sour cherry port reduction sauce. She found this recipe when she came home. Excellent and simple. Used balsamic vinegar, added a bit of sugar for balance. I agree that the pork is overdone at 155 (but still moist and acceptable) and will reduce the temperature next time (I clearly wasn't paying attention). I will increase the sauce because it isn't sufficient (for us) given the amount of meat. What I love is the simplicity, this can be knocked out PDQ, with little attention, and is terrific. I had cherries from our sour cherry tree in the freezer (1st year I've picked them and used them myself), but it would be well worth keeping a bag just for a last minute dinner party. It is a perfect plate in terms of eye appeal.

The tenderloin was excellent and the flavor of the sauce was great. I did not like all the chunks of cherries. I think I would try to puree the cherries next time. More sauce and less cherries is what I would do next time.

this was pretty good. I would double the sauce next time for sure. I did not add as many cherries as the recipe called for. Probably half. It was well received and I will make it again!

This is one of the best tenderloins I've ever made. The sauce has a wonderful flavor! Definitely a do again.

I tried this last night and it was delicious. Next time I would not cook the meat to 155 degrees, as it came out a bit overdone; and I would make more of the sauce as there wasn't enough to go around after reduction (what there was, was excellent). I used medium sherry instead of port, worked great. A final tip: it can be difficult to find tart cherries in the grocery store, so I use Michigan dried tart cherries that I order over the internet and have shipped to me. If you like tart cherries, Michigan grows the best, it is the nation's primary supplier. You can order them directly from Michigan vendors like Benjamin Twigg (www.benjamintwigg.com). I keep packets of the dried tart cherries in the pantry and use them all year round. They are great to eat by themselves as a healthy snack, or to use in recipes either as is or reconstituted. For this recipe, I reconstituted the cherries in water for a little while before I started cooking. The extra liquid that the cherries absorbed was needed for the sauce.

I used this recipe as a base but changed it quite a bit to fit the ingredients that I had in my kitchen at the time. I used red wine instead of port and added a few tablespoons of Grandmarnier and a sprinkle of brown sugar to sweeten the wine. I also used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar, and toasted cumin seeds (instead of caraway) in the pan before adding the onion. I got a little nervous about substituting the cumin so I added very little, however I got one bite with the cumin flavor mixed with the cherries and thought it was fabulous and wished I had added more! I used bottled Morello cherries from Trader Joe's and had to add a bit of chicken broth when the sauce cooked down too much. I would like to try this recipe again once with cumin and another time as written.

I served this for friends & they loved it! I did not put in the caraway seed. My little girls loved it too!

good recipe, but the sauce would have been fine without the caraway. definitely allow the sauce to reduce, the flavor changes almost automatically from bland, to flavorful. didn't have Tawny port, i used sherry instead, still great.

I substituted cranberries and black berries for the cherries and it was wonderful. A little more tart, yet sweet.

Rating: 3
Beautiful presentation and the sauce comes together very nicely to produce complex flavors that marry the pork very well. One successful simplification is to use regular frozen naturally sweet (but no sugar added) cherries and add the juice of one lemmon to one pound of cherries. You'll find the cherries in the frozen foods section of any supermarket, no sweat.

I used this recipe as a base, with noted changes, and it was amazing. Instead of the port and red wine vinegar, I used a nice balsamic (did use the fresh orange juice), skipped the seeds and used dried tart cherries. Cooked the sauce with dried cherries a little longer than suggested before putting it and the pork into the oven. At the end, I needed to add a little chicken broth to the sauce. Otherwise followed all directions. Wonderful flavor. Rave reviews from my guests.

I have never made this recipe but would like to know how much dried cherries I would use as opposed to the fresh cherries. Thanks

I thought this was just okay and wouldn't make it again...there are so many other wonderful (and easy) recipes on this site for pork tenderloin. Try the one with gorgonzola sauce...to die for! My guests enjoyed it though, so hey, I'm maybe just picky. I definitely thought it was overdone though, and recommend cooking to a temperature of 140, rather than 155 as it will continue to cook a bit while you're reducing your sauce.

God, mine was terrible. I couldn't find tart cherries anywhere, but then again, I didn't even look for dried. I substituted cranberries instead and it came out tasting like some freakish Thanksgiving leftover. ::Sigh:: I'm sure it would be really good with the cherries, though. Although, doesn't 2 cups of cherries really overpower the meat/caraway/port flavours?

This is fantastic. I probably get recipes 2-3 times a week from this site and this is the first time I have bothered to write a review. I am making it again tonight. I followed the recipe exactly. Except I am going to omit the carraway due to allergies. I agree with the chef who said to make sure you reduce the sauce enough. - big difference. And I don't even l like pork OR cherries!

One of my best tenderloins yet. I didn't have orange juice so used chicken broth. Had to add more as "sauce" evaporated during cooking (probably because I halved recipe). Also used dried cherries.

I use dried cherries and leave out the caraway. My favorite meat recipe!

This recipe makes a beautiful presentation and is delicious. I think it would be perfect during the holidays, with those beautiful cherries. The meat comes out exceptionally moist. My sister-in-law said it was the best pork she's ever eaten. In response to reviewers who didn't think the sauce was so great, I am wondering if they reduced it enough. I tasted it before and after the reduction, and there was an enormous difference. The meat does not absorb much flavor, so reducing that sauce and spooning it on top is a must.

I LOVED this recipe, and so did my gourmet cook sister-in-law! It's easy, it's delicious, it looks great when served...perfect for entertaining or for every day. I increased the sauce a little...it's not necessary, but it was great to have left over sauce to simply eat with a spoon!

I tried this recipe last night, and was disappointed. The tenderloin did not absorb the sauce or take on the flavor at all even though it was cooked in the sauce. The sauce was ok, but did not have any depth to the flavor. It seemed a bit watered down. I used high quality ingredients as well, including fresh pork tenderloin. I will not make this dish again.

Rating: 3
Quick and easy with the results very pleasing. I used fennel instead of caraway seed and I rubbed the pork with cracked pepper and coriander which made it spicy but the cherries and sauce made for a good contrast. An oaked heavy shiraz was the perfect wine match. Could allow for more sauce in the proportions.

I wish I wasn't the one to give this less than a great rating, but I value honest opinions myself and I feel I should disclose mine. I found this dish good, but not outstanding. I went by the directions, used high quality everything, and found it to be not as polished and sophisticated as I'd hoped. Color was nice but the meat didn't seem to take on the flavors of the sauce as nicely as I'd wished. Maybe I'll have better luck next time.

This was so simple and positively the most delicious pork tenderloin dish I've tasted. Great for company but so simple you could make it during the week. A genuine keeper and repeater. The sauce was to die for. Try it on chicken also. Just great!

I love the unexpected caraway. This is very easy to serve to guests too because its in the oven till you serve it, leaving last minute time for other dishes. I served it with polenta with butter and parmasan and asparagus with lemon zest and butter.

One of the best pork tenderloin recipes I've ever tried - incredibly moist and flavorful. Perfect dish for a dinner party. I served this with "Potatoes with Leeks and Gruyere" and chilled steamed asparagus with a simple vinagrette (sun-dried tomato flakes, basalmic vinegar, olive oil, garlic and salt) for Mother's Day dinner and it was one of the best meals I've made.
