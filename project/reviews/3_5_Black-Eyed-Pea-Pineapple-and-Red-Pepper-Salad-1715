Love, love, love this recipe! I think it's the pineapple and onion mixed together. Have taken it to church potluck twice now and have come home with a very empty serving piece.Hadn't heard about black-eyed peas bringing good luck for the coming year, so I guess this will become a standard dish at any New Year's Eve party where I have to "bring something."

This was a big hit on New Year's. All dinner guests liked this and I will be making this year round now. Did not have the roasted red peppers so I tried sun dried tomatoes (not in oil). Seems my guests enjoyed that and I believe I'll stick with that.

Since eating black-eyed peas is supposed to bring good luck for the new year, I made this for the first course for a New Year's Eve progressive dinner. I served it with crab cakes and saved about half the dressing to drizzle over the grab cakes after plating.

I think this is one of my favorite salads EVER. Great flavors, so colorful and very healthy. Leftovers were delicious the next day. One change- I used dried black-eyed peas and measured out 4c after they cooked. Any more than that, the peas would overwhelm the fresh fruits and vegis.

I love this salad. I add some bacon to it and have it on a bed of lettuce as a complete meal.

Every time I make this salad, my guests rave. This is a wonderful salad for a crowd--everyone loves it, and we rarely have leftovers.

Very different, but delicious salad to serve in the summer with grilled chicken or fish.

Peas and pineapple -- it didn't work, I thought. I made this for New Years; maybe it would be better on a hot summer day, at a picnic. It did look pretty. It actually was better as leftovers, when the tastes had married better. I won't rush to make this again.

This is a great buffet side dish for parties! It's unusual and pretty, gets lots of compliments and goes well with a big holiday ham. I've made it several times with no problems and don't find it too spicy for my tastebuds.

This dish took a lot of time to prepare, but was not worth the time, effort or ingredients. I was sadly disappointed with its outcome.

Yummy...the combination was delightful and very refreshing on a hot summer day. I had to make some adaptations...Used a can of black beans and only 1/4 c of oil as there seemed to be enough juice from fruit. Also DID NOT use jalapenos as my husband decided to make a very hot "Jerk" chicken. The cool of the salad was a great contrast! Think I might toss the leftovers with the chicken and greens. Maybe add some cumin.

This is a flavorful and interesting salad that I whole-heartedly recommend. The pineapple is the real "star" of this dish, and somehow it ties everything together beautifully. I've eaten this salad for lunch the past two days and wish I had made a full batch instead of just half of one! Make this salad and let it marinate overnight before serving ... delish!

This is a very refreshing salad, I served it along grilled chicken. Fast and easy to make, with alot of compliments.

This is a very nice salad - the pineapple made it nicely sweet, which made an interesting contrast to the mustard and jalapenos and onions. Also the contrasting textures are welcome. I used canned pineapple and that made this a very easy dish to prepare.

Served this as a potluck dish after a hike on the Oregon coast with a group of gourmet cooks. I was afraid that four jalapeno peppers would make it too "warm" so I used only two - I now think that this was a mistake on my part. The peppers definitely add to the flavor. This salad has a nice Ying/Yang with its sweet/sour and hot/cold attributes. It definitely got noticed even amongst a number of other outstanding dishes. Those that noticed it like it a lot - it got raves. I cooked my black eyed peas from dried beans using salt pork and dried Porchini mushrooms for flavor. I would like to try making it from fresh peas if I could get them.
