AMAZING! I used light corn syrup instead of dark, and the fudge on top was unbelievable. Really easy and really delicious.

this was just ok. Not worth the effort. Besiees the orea crust was frozen solid, even when the icecream had melted it was almost impossible to cut through the crust at the bottom. This is the first time i have had a '2 fork' recipe from Epicurious and i am bit disappointed.

I made with store bought Oreo crust filled halfway with Turkey Hill cookies and cream ice cream and then Turkey Hill mint chocolate chip ice cream on top of that. The sauce on top is awesome!

This was fabulous. So tasty that your guests won't guess how easy it is! I made the recipe just as it's written and wouldn't change a thing. But... you could easily subsitute almond flavor for the mint and change ice-cream flavors. The recipe's versatility is limited only by your imagination and the ice-cream selection at your grocery store!

Very Very Good! So easy to make. Do not leave out the peppermint, I almost did and was so pleased with that little hint of mint. Everyone loved it. Will definately make again!

It's not fair. It seems that the less effort that I put into a dish, the more my husband raves about it. He loved this, even though it's essentially just store-bought ice-cream, store-bought oreo crumbs, with a chocolate glaze. No more slaving for hours over a fancy dessert!

YUM! Doubled the crust, quadrupled the ice cream, tripled the delicious sauce, used a 9X13. Huge hit.

Made this with Turkey Hill mint choc chip ice cream on one layer then a layer of cookies and cream ice cream. This combo works great with the mint chocolate sauce.

We love this wonderful recipe! Thank you for suggesting using 1/2 gallon of ice cream as this made a nice mound. The fudge mint topping is amazing! This is incredibly easy and so delicious!

This is insanely easy, and everyone loves it! I used an entire half gallon of ice cream, and since we were experiencing unusally hot weather (90's) had to finish making it in the freezer!

this pie was so great - a real crowd pleaser and very easy to make! (a hint - you can even buy the pre-made oreo pie crusts and it works just fine! even tho it is a terrible way to cheat!) do use more ice cream than called for! this recipe will be circulating among my friends for the next few weeks!!!

I give this recipe 4 forks because it is delicious and *SO EASY*. The minty fudge topping is a wonderful addition to an already good pie. Everytime I make it, someone asks for the recipe. As others have stated, definitely add more ice cream than the recipe calls for.

It is so easy you are afraid it will not be good. It is very good but definitely add more ice cream than the recipe calls for.

This is a no-brainer, but it is still a very good recipe that will please most everyone. My friends loved it! I would suggest using at least a half gallon of ice cream instead of just a quart to make the pie a little "taller." We thought the peppermint flavored topping was spectacular.

This was great and foolproof. I doubled the recipe and made it for my nephew's birthday party but after spooning 1/2 the icecream onto the crust, I added a 1 inch think layer of crushed oreos and then topped with reamining icecream. There were no leftovers.

I usually make this dessert when there are going to be young children dining with us, but I find that the grown-ups love it just as much.
