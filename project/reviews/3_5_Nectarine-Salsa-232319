Ate this with leftover steak and lamb, very tasty. A good, different way to use ripe nectarines.

Great with tortilla chips. Refreshing in the summer with a nice hint of spice to it.

This was delicious! I served this with grilled chicken fajitas and it was out of this world. A keeper! My nectarines were just the right amount of ripeness and juiciness. Great a hot summer night.

I served this salsa with grilled pork chops seasoned simply with cumin, salt and pepper. It was a great combination enjoyed by the entire family.
