I followed the recipe except I made changes that I thought would only enhance it: I used home-cooked pinto beans and I sauteed the spices for few minutes with the garlic. It was a big disappointment. I won't make this again.

Tastes great, is easy to make, is economical to make (I use 1 pound of dried beans - soaked and then cooked, of course), is healthy if you go easy on chips and cheese, and is really versatile. A reviewer below said that it's like of a cross between baked beans and re-fried beans... I'd say it's a cross between re-fried beans and vegetarian chili. As a meal, it's great over rice (instead of the tortilla crust), but it's also wonderful as a side dish for a mexican meal, spread in quesadillas, or as a corn chip dip with cheese melted on top. If you're a fan of beans, try this one!

I used homemade beans, cooked 2 cups of dried beans. Used 1 cup of the bean water instead of broth and replaced one bell pepper with green chile. Next time I will omit the chips and serve with tortillas. I also mashed 2 cups of the beans with a potato masher instead of pulling out the food processor. We really liked it.

I made this as part of a Mexican meal for 12 (chicken fajitas, cabbage with honey lime dressing) and it was a big hit, even from people who said they didn't like beans. Only changes I made were adding a bit of chopped jalapeno I had left over from the other dishes and left off the chips and cheese topping. Didn't miss that at all!

This is a wonderful side dish. We had it for dinner one night and then re-heated the remainder to go with scrambled eggs the next morning. I hand-mashed the beans slightly rather then processing them. It seemed much easier than cleaning the food processor. I also made half the recipe and it was plenty for 4 for both meals. I kept the crushed tortilla chips and cheese amounts the same. Very good.

Made this ahead of time for a campground meal, chilled it overnight and then transported in a cooler. Baked in the oven of our trailer and served piping hot. People really seemed to like it; the reaction was definitely in the 3 fork range for most and in the 4 fork range for a couple. I used an extra 2 cups of beans and also pureed about half of the total beans for a more creamy texture. I'd make it again, and it's actually very low fat and healthy if you leave out the chips and cheese (I served it with...it was a party after all!)

I took this to a party and people went out of their minds over it. Big hit! This is a fantastic recipe. This is now my new bring-a-dish.

Beans are so good by themselves but when they are prepared like this they are fantstic! I like to add veggies to fill the dish out for a main course but this stands out as a side too. Onions and garlic and peppers are a must if you can handle it.

I rated this as a 2 just because I am not a huge bean lover, but my father thought it was terrific. Except I had made a few changes of my own. I didn't top it with the chips and due to what I had in my cupboard I used 1 can whole pinto beans, one can refried beans, and one can whole black beans, I also omitted the chicken broth. The result was very good, especially if you like your beans to have a little kick.

This is a wonderful cross between re-fried beans and baked beans. I have served it several times, always to rave reviews. I puree two cans of beans (to get closer to "re-fried texture") and omit the broth to keep them from being too soupy. I have left off the toppings to reduce the fat and they are delicious that way too.

It was a great side dish! It was simple to make and very tasty! I brought it to a party and everyone enjoyed it. This will become a staple bean side dish from here on out.

I have made this recipe several times for different occasions, it is always gone at the end of the party. I like to make it with Carolina pulled pork sandwiches, a recipe that came from Bon Appetite. I plan to make it for the Super Bowl Party, GO GIANTS.

We made this recipe for our Supper Club's Mexican theme dinner. It was very good, and served many people. I substituted two cans of pintos w/ two cans of red beans to add a little more color and better texture. (Just puree one of the pinto cans.) Overall the dish was very colorful and flavorful- it was also easy to adjust the spices to taste. Leftovers were great rolled in a tortilla buritto fashion, heated and served w/ guacomole & sour cream.

This is the best bean dish I have ever had. Just the right spices. Very easy to prepare.

Great with the chili-baked ribs from the same issue.
