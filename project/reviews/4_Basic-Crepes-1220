An all time favorite at our house. Recipe says to refrigerate; I usually don't refrigerate and I use low fat milk; the end result is still wonderful. My kids like the crepes with just plain powdered sugar, the adults do ham and cheese and different fruit jams.

What I like to do is mix the eggs and milk first, add a pinch of salt, a pint of sugar (for sweet crepes), 1/2 - 1 tsp of vanilla extract and whisk. then add flour and another pinch of nutmeg and cinnamon. Turns out PERFECT. Been making this for girlfriend a long time now and she loves smearing the crepes with nutella and strawberries.

Jamie, A little common sense with the order of ingredients goes a LONG ways! One can't be to literal with recipes.

Huge fault in method! I dont think ANY of the other reviewers actually followed the instructions. One cannot whisk a cup of flour into two eggs. What a mess I made! It makes a very sticky lump. Some of the milk should probably go in before all the flour. I chopped the lump into some of the milk with a knife and fork until I thought the blender could handle it. Maybe it will turn out OK.

My husband makes this almost every weekend for our family breakfast. Very good and easy to make. The kids love them with powdered sugar, we like them with strawberry jam or lemon curd.

I have been making this recipe since 1996 . The only thing I do differently is add a pinch of nutmeg. I use this recipe mainly for manicotti which is an Italian pasta dish. Each crepe is filled with ricotta & Italian cheese,covered with sauce then baked. Excellent!

This was great! My wife and her friends said Creps were really hard but this recipe proved them wrong. It's very easy and the result is great! Like the ones I remember having while living in Quebec.

I searched for a crepe recipe after returning from Paris. As it was my first time making crepes, this basic recipe fit the bill perfectly. I added various sweet and savory fillings and was happy with each combination.

I tried a half-recipe, I forgot to buy regular milk and had to use soy milk instead. I was afraid of what the results would be but it turned out pretty well! Will try to make this again using regular milk, I'm sure it will be fabulous.

This was actually a lot easier than I had been told crepes would be. My husband and I both enjoyed the recipe very much-- although I did try a variation on it using macadamia oil instead of the butter and it made for a vry intriguing difference.

I prefer savory to sweet. This crepes recipe was perfect for asparagus crepes with White Cheddar Cheese sauce. I served a hearty vegetable soup and crusty French bread with them. My family loved it.

This was the first time I'd made crepes, so I wanted a classic recipe, and this seemed to fit the bill. I modified a bit based on information I found elsewhere: use sparkling water, and chill batter before making the crepes. They turned out beautiful! Filled with homemade applesauce.

this recipe is extremely tasty with a creamcheese filling that you can find on like a search. Put the filling in the middle and cherry sauce and cherries on top. That's how my Grandma makes them :) Yum!!!!

Delicious!! I made a cinnamon butter glaze to go with the crepes and rolled them with fresh rasberries and strawberries then sprinkled powdered sugar over the top. We stuffed ourselves silly and I promised to make them again.

This is a wonderfully simple recipe that even I could do! I have always been a little afraid of making crepes because something so simple is usually so complicated, but this recipe made it easy.

Easy, tasty, good recipe. And yes, as another reviewer says let batter stand in fridge for the hour. Satisfied our craving for crepes from the ubiquitous Parisian street stands. Fill with thin sliced French ham and gruyere. For dessert, Nutella!

CHEAT, if you want, or need to for cholesterol and triglyceride reasons. I use only one of the egg yolks, and 1% milk. Works beautifully!

This is a great recipe that is super easy to make and turns out Great. I guess I put too much butter on the skillet so the first two were kind of greasy so take it easy on the butter. Also it does not specify this but let it stand for an hour in the fridge. You will like this.

I used fat free half and half in place of the the milk and added a tbs of sugar and 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract. It worked out well, but I would substitute 3/4 low fat milk and 1/2 fat free half the next time out.

I make this recipe routinely and, in fact, keep a jar of batter in the fridge almost all of the time so that I can make crepes whenever I want.

Good basic recipe but needs flavoring such as rum or orange rind.
