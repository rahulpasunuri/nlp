i'd double the amount of beets, and the dressing wasn't very distinctive or sharp--for a do-over, i'd add an additional poblano. we had leftovers, so i left the veggies (sans dressing) in the fridge for an additional day before eating again--and it was much more tasty: crunchy and the flavors (like the radishes) were more cohesive.

Noting reviewer complaints about the heat of the salad dressing, I added a little vinegar and used half as much poblano pepper. Whereas we didn't find the salad dressing very hot, we did think it was lacking. I added queso blanco to the salad, but even that did not release it from being ordinary. I'm sure it was healthful, though.

Less peppers in the dressing.

My son made this for me on Mother's Day. Served with Pork Tenderloin With Orange Chipotle Sauce. This is an awesome salad and I will be making it often...

The dressing was way to hot, but still managed to be bland. Couldn't make it interesting, even with some more salt, sugar, and lime juice. We threw out half the dish.

Big success! Everyone loved this salad. It was a lot of work but definitely quite the charmer.

I think you'll find your answer (re peeling the beets) in lines 2 and 3 in the salad instructions.

Do you peel the beets before wrapping in foil, after baking, or not ever? It beets me.
