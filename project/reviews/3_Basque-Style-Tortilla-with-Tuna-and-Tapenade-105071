I agree with the other review who said, "much work for little gain". My husband and I rated this "interesting" but will not make again.

forgiving recipe. I'd recommend using good canned tuna in extra virgin olive oil, and decreasing the amount of other oil used. I also omit the ham since I don't like mixing tuna with ham, somehow. It's endlessly adaptable, keeps well, and is great served cold or at room temperature, tapas style or brunch or otherwise.

Good flavors and easy to prepare. This would have been a 3-forker without the dry, stringy tuna. However, I used tuna packed in water and so perhaps a try with tuna packed in olive oil would lead to a better texture.

Fairly easy to make and really delicious. Instead of ham I used portobella mushrooms and I added some manchego cheese on top. For a vegetarian version, I would use mushrooms and more cheese & tapenade in place of the tuna. It was a hit for my valentine's dinner!

I made this dish along with Chicken Empanada w/Chorizo, Raisins & Olives (incredible) - Kale & Potato Spanish Tortilla - Manchego & Quince Paste as an appetizer for a Spanish inspired brunch for Father's Day. Everyone raved! As for the Tortilla w/Tuna and Tapenade, I didn't think the tuna was actually neccessary with all of the other wonderful flavors. Also, I added potato by mistake - turned out well.

I have made this dish several times for brunch for overnight house guests. Everyone has loved it. I have made may own tapenade and chared the peppers. However, in the interest of time saved sometimes I have used the bottled versions as well. I always use oil packed tuna as it has much more flavour than the tasteless water packed.

Sorry gang, my wife and both thought this was awful. A lot of work for little gain.

Wonderful!!! Makes a nice option for lunch if you are sick to death of the same old sandwiches. I nice glass of wine and some bread and this a great meal. Very worthwhile!

Excellent! I halved the recipe (used a 10" skillet vs 12") for dinner for my Husband and I - what a pleasant surprise. I wasn't sure if it would satisfy us for dinner but it did! The flavors were great and the recipe perfect as is. I sprinkled dried thyme (instead of using fresh) over the filling before adding the final egg layer. Assembly and cooking is all last minute so take that into consideration if serving as a brunch entree for company or a crowd.
