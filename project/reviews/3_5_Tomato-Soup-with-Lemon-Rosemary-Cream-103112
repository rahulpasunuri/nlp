This was a huge hit at my house. The whole town is shut down for Hurricane Sandy and this was the staple meal with roaring success. It is perfect for a day of rain and howling winds! I used half canned and half fresh tomatoes, blended half of the soup and left the other half chunky. I Also made double the cream sauce and added 1/2 strait to the soup. Serve with grilled cheese tomato and bacon sandwiches. Delish! I will try to make a vegan version next time and see how it goes. (substitute veg broth and soy or almond cream).

Used heirloom tomatoes and blended it. Followed everything else to a Tee. Lackluster.

My bf hates canned tomato soup and he LOVED this soup. The lemon-rosemary cream is so good and the lemon peel in the soup really makes the recipe. I did double the amount of thyme because I really like the smell of it. I also added a quartered a hard boiled egg in the bottom of each bowl because I had tomato soup served like that in Iceland and it was really good. This is will now be in our regular rotation.

After reading all the creamy tomato soups on this site, I found this one best suited my idea of tomato soup. I have followed it completely with the exception of fresh ripe tomatoes instead of canned. I used tarragon in the cream as I have been overwhelmed with rosemary lately...Love the addition of it upon serving; keeps it from curdling if you keep it for more than one meal. Delicious!!!!

We made our own chicken broth and roasted the tomatoes for this recipe -- as usual making it unnecessarily complicated. But ohhh my it was worth it. We also pureed after cooking. The cream is necessary to balance the tomato acid (maybe sugar would work instead?) Would not change anything to make it again!

Made this last night with sourdough-grilled cheese sandwiches. Awesome pairing. Made some adjustments (who doesn't?). Subbed a cup of frozen corn for the carrots. Used half the butter, half the crushed red pepper (baby was having some). 6 garden-fresh tomatoes, peeled, and only about 2-3 cups chicken broth. Didn't add the cream, rosemary or lemon peel because it didn't need it. And pureed it all at the end. This recipe will be added to my staple soups! Creamy, full of flavor, not too spicy for the kids, and great any time of year.

Wow, this was super yummy. Of course I changed the recipe. I put in more tomatoes (1.5 times) and only 2 1/2 cups chicken broth. Then, I chopped it in the blender after cooking. For the tomatoes, I used half fresh from my garden chopped in the blender, and half roasted tomatoes I roasted in the oven. It was spicier than expected, although my kids ate it. I like spicy food and it was mild for me, but a little hot for the kids. It was perfect as is, but might try less butter next time for health, but not for flavor!

Deliious! It's tasty and easy to prepare. I had to double the recipe (we are a crowd) so I decided to use fresh tomatoes as well and I also added a little more spices (saffron, cumin) and used fresh herbs instead of dried ones. It's a comforting dish. Great as a first course

This soup turned out great! It's so rich and creamy and has the perfect flavor balance. We blended the soup as other reviewers suggested and also let the lemon-rosemary cream sit in the fridge for a bit before we used it to help the flavors infuse. Otherwise couldn't be easier or more delectable!

This was so delicious. I made it for our Super Bowl party last night and everyone loved it, including my fiance who at first told me to cut the recipe in half because "he doesn't like tomato soup so he wouldn't be having any." Well, I'm glad I didn't listen to him because he loved it!

I LOVED this soup! Like other reviewers I blended mine after cooking. I love the fact that there is a little bit of heat on the back of the palette after you take a bite! Its really easy to make too. I usually have most of the ingredients in my cabinet on any given day so that makes it great too! The soup is extremely thick and rich even before adding the cream. I didn't find it too acidic, but them again I like foods with a bite to them.

I love this soup. I make it frequently and freeze portions for future lunches or dinners. I like the soup pureed and I make a simple cheater version of the cream with rosemary sautéed in a little olive oil and then wisked with sour cream - mostly because I usually have sour cream and rarely have whipping cream. Delicious.

Made this last night, excellent. I already had one carrot grated, so used that with one chopped carrot. I usually like a rustic, chunky soup, but the texture of this didn't appeal to me. The pieces were too small to be satisfying, and too big to be smooth, so I used a hand blender to puree the soup a bit. In my opinion, this was much better. My wife was happy with either texture.

this soup was exactly what i was looking for. just because i like to be complicated, i made my own crushed tomatoes (i put 4 1/2 pounds of tomatoes through a hand mill) and made my own vegetable stock. i don't like to use canned foods if possible. i really liked the lemon rosemary flavor in the soup. thyme is also one of my favorite pairings in tomato soup. i did find it a little acidic, so i made some goat cheese croutons. they really mellowed it out. i also pureed the whole thing in the end to make it smooth. i love my mom's immersion blender, a must if you make a lot of soups!

This was a big disappointment. We love tomato soup, and I followed the recipe exactly, but we each ate only a little of this, and never came back for seconds (and this recipe makes a lot). I found previous reviewers' comments about acidity surprising when I was choosing the recipe, but that was exactly the problem for me. Even with the cream (and I did use heavy cream), the acidity was still extremely sharp. Even more unfortunately, I thought that cutting the soup with water and broth might make it pallatable as an ingredient in minestrone, and all I did was ruin an entire batch of minestrone. Does anyone have solutions for the acidity? I tried sugar (1 tsp at a time), baking soda (also 1 tsp at a time), longer cooking time...I'm all ears!

This was great. What made it special was the lemon rosemary cream. Don't leave that out. My family loved it as did a girl friend the next day. I pair it with a Jarlsberg swiss grilled cheese on nutty eight grain bread. It turned an old favorite into an adult gourmet-like treat!One thing I might do the next time is send it through the blender for a smoother texture, but my family, even the kids, did not mind the bits of veggies in it.

This was easy and quick for a weeknight meal served with cornbread leftover from the previous night. The flavor was good, but it was a little acidic, as previous reviewers have noted. My husband really liked it though, and said it made him feel good for the first time today (he had a sore throat and was feeling tired previously). I only had dried rosemary, but the lemon cream was still really good, and definitely an important part of the soup. We'll definitely make this again for something easy that uses things we always have on hand, but next time I will probably follow previous reviewers' suggestions to make it smoother.

I made this because friends coming to dinner asked for "something simple, like grilled cheese and tomato soup". I thought the soup was very good, and the cream added the final touch to make it special. I paired it with the Ultimate Grilled Cheese Sandwich, and it was a hit.

I thought this recipe was good...not outstanding. Frankly, I was expecting more from all the rave reviews. HOwever, my husband who told me he didn't like tomato soup, really thought it was good. So....it's definitely better than Campbell's (ugh) tomato soup. It needed something more and I'm not sure what. I make a penne alla vodka sauce with some heavy cream which is really much better than this soup. Maybe the soup needs a little vodka.

Wonderful, easy, slightly spicey. I made it on the first cold day in October to serve with grilled cheese for the family. Husband thought it was delicious too, but didn't think it pared well with grilled cheese. I added cream for the kids to tone down the heat. That was delicious too.

I love this recipe! Here is the trick for a "cream of" soup: After the vegies have cooked for 40 minutes, discard bay leaf & season with S&P. Add rosemary & lemon zest then just start pouring the cream and whisking until you like the color! I would guess I add about 1-2 cups of cream. I top each serving with homemade croutons & Parm. Reggi. Yum!

I made this for a lunch with 20 of my girlfriends and everyone flipped over it! My sister craves it now. For those that don't follow the recipe, yeah it's not going to be that good because it's not this recipe anymore, it's something you came up with. Make the cream! It's what makes this amazing!

I think this soup was great. Originally, I made it for a luncheon in Decemeber and it got raved reviews. I now make it once every couple weeks because it keeps great for quick re-hearting. The lemon-rosemary cream definitely makes the soup, so don't leave it out.

Not a keeper. Was looking for a homemade, comfort food sort of soup - this is not it. Although quite quick and easy, it's not worth making again. I didn't make the cream and glad I didn't as it would have been wasted on this soup. I sauteed the vegetables longer than five minutes as they need longer to soften and release their flavour. Also, the thyme and bay leaf seem like odd spices for a tomato soup (I use these spices together for roast turkey) and is too overpowering which detracts from the tomato taste. At the end, I pureed the carrots and onions to make a smooth soup as I didn't want a vegetable soup...

A staple in our house. Healthy, easy and just fabulously delicious. I puree it lightly after cooking. Don't skip the lemon zest. I've also used dried rosemary and sour cream as a topper. So good. A little fresh brioche and a steak and you've got a tremendous meal.

I made this recipe first exactly as written and thought it was very pleasant, although faintly reminiscent of spaghetti sauce. The second time I made it with fresh tomatoes--didn't bother peeling them and the flavour was altogether different --much more subtle. If you have a bumper crop of tomatoes this is a delicious and easy way to use them up!

wow! i made this for last nights dinner for the kids! it was so good. (although i didn't add the lemon, fresh rosemary or cream only because i didn't have those ingredients handy. next time i will make it a point to try that. sounds like the lemon would add a summery flavor). i served the soup (pureed with a hand blender). and also served the grilled ham sandwiches with caramelized onion. what a combo!

Wow! This was the best tomato soup I've ever had...even better than the one at Jason's Deli here in the South. I skipped the lemon-rosemary cream since I didn't have fresh rosemary, and opted instead to just mix about 1/3 cup cream into the soup. It was absolutely delicious. I will make this often.

My husband said this was the best soup he ever had. I think you could do a lot with this basic recipe. I made a lot of adjustments. I used olive oil instead of butter and threw in some butter buds (I know, I'm a cretin) for flavor. I was out of chicken broth, so I used beef. Didn't have enough tomato puree so I threw some canned diced tomatoes in the food processor. I didn't have heavy cream so I just threw the rosemary and a little zest in the soup and then stirred in sour cream at the end. Turned out fantastic. Use your imagination with this one!

Very nice for a quick soup. A little goes a long way, so don't fill the soup bowl to the brim when serving. Quite acidic, so I made some garlic bread to accompany it as a first course. The garlic bread helped nullify the acidity a bit and helped to calm the palate (and in some cases, the less tolerant stomachs) to prepare for the next course.

This soup was simply delicious! I pureed the soup before reheating and adding the cream, which gave it a finer texture.
