This was just OK for me - my boyfriend liked it more than I did. I just didn't think there was anything special about it for all the work. Maybe it was because it was served at room temp.

So yummy! I serve with local raw milk colby cheese. I also use lemon zest instead of peel and a little more garlic and serve right away (of course it is better it left to sit), but still good right away.

Remove lemon peels guests before serving. Serve hot.

Really great flavor. Let marinate for several hours, was better the next day. Hard to eat with toothpicks, we needed forks.

THis was delicious. I made it as a side dish with some grilled halibut and a green salad. I don't really see it as an appetizer using tooth picks - you need to eat a spoonful at a time to get all of the flavors melded together. it sounds strange, but the combo is REALLY yummy.

Very good. We used a young but aged pecorino, and placed it on a bed of sauted spinach leaves. It needs something mild like spinach to round out the flavors. Really good though!
