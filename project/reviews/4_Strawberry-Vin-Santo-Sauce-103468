This sauce is so delicious, it will enhance anything! I've used it over cheesecake, cake, ice cream, and yogurt and granola. I do cut back on the sugar....the flavor of the strawberries is sweet enough. This has become a staple while strawberries are in season.

Didn't seem quite refined enough in taste and texture for our cheesecake, but i'm sure it would be excellent on other less fancy desserts, such as cake and ice cream. Might also make a good fruit dipping sauce.

This sauce was a complete hit. I substituted raspberries for strawberries since that's what I had on hand, and the sauce turned out perfectly. Smooth and rich, and so so easy to make. I served it over the new york cheesecake recipe on this site and both turned out perfectly.

I chopped the strawberries to give the sauce a chunkier texture. used a port wine. great with dessert crepes (also on this site)

Delicious. Didn't have a lemon so used an orange instead which gave it a slightly sweeter taste. Also didn't have the cream sherry so used madeira. Will definitely make again!!

We made this sauce and served it along with the Three Cities of Spain Cheesecake (also on this site). It was a smash! This sauce had a wonderful texture and flavor. I have already found several uses for this sauce. The Vin Santo wine is perfect with the strawberries. I have also adapted this recipie and used it with cranberries for Thanksgiving.
