Like most of the recipes I use, I glanced at this for guidance and then did my own twist on it from memory and what I had. So my review isn't very accurate but I found this to be a helpful guide. Instead of just water I used LSCBroth for half the liquid. I also didn't have chipotle hot sauce on hand so used an African inspired hot sauce that I'd been meaning to work with. I also added bacon that I had pre cooked in a separate pan and onions that I softened in the rendered fat. It was a great side dish to pulled pork sandwiches, the meat for which I smoked for about 7 hours.

Great recipe for collard greens with perfect flavor balances; I added ham base to the water. But, any vegetable recipe calling for water, I use beef stock. Chipotle hot sauce or tabasco/crystal works well in it and adds vinegar to improve overall flavor balances. Additional chipotle seasonng wouldn't complement the flavor of greens as well as the traditional hot sauce, unless you wanted smoky chili infused greens.

This recipe needed a bit of tweaking to be really good. Instead of hot sauce, I used two chipotle peppers in adobo sauce. At the end, I drained off a little of the water and added two tablespoons of balsamic vinegar. I served them over cheese grits, and they were very good.
