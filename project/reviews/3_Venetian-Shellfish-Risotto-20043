Excellent, except it doesn't require anywhere near as much butter as the recipe calls for, 2 tablespoons is plenty.

Excellent, but leave out the Parmesan and add some lemon or saffron instead. Venetians do not combine shell fish with dairy - it's un-Kosher for a reason: it's bad on the stomach.

Crab meat is also a good replacement for this risotto. It's true that In italy we never put cheese and fish or basil and fish together "Non ci va!" I never understood if this was snobbism or if there is a good reason for this, because some french dishes have cheese and fish together and they are delicious. I am positive a good risotto should always have parmesan cheese, and at least one marrow bone in the broth !!!

In northern Italy, they NEVER put parmesan cheese on a fish dish! Believe me, that's a lifetime of experience speaking! Other than that, the receipe is good, even though the seafood we have available here if Florida is a little different from the seafood of the Adriatic. As they say, "Chi si accontenta , gode" (He that can be contented is the one that enjoys himself!)
