I've made this as a side dish for dinner parties on several occasions. It is very nice with a pork tenderloin or a salmon fillet. This always gets raves from friends and family.

4 forks because this is a great backbone recipe that can go anywhere and always be good. Do not put this in the oven until YOU like the taste of the sauce. Gets a golden crust in the oven that is crisp and wonderful. My fresh dill rotted and I went with dried thyme. Wanted to try wine in it per previous reviews but did not have it so added 1 tbsp course mustard between the flour and the chk broth. Also added juice of 1/2 lemon and extra zest. Added 1/4 tsp kitchen bouquet. In a rare stroke of genius, diced cheese instead of grating and got small blobs of melted cheese - SO GOOD! 1/2 inch dice is perfect for me. Can imagine my future versions - add zucchini 1/4 moons before baking, or add carrots to saute and peas before baking, or use small marinated mozzerella balls and add diced heirloom tomatoes before baking, or add mushrooms to saute and truffle oil before baking, .... YUM.

This is really good, I prefer antique Gruyere and for those who would like a little more citrus, add some lemon and/or lime juice off the heat. Acidic ingredients retain their acidity better when added off the heat.

My kids request this recipe all the time. I do use extra cheese, lemon and dill, but it still has a very subtle flavor that complements almost anything.

This was excellent. Perfect with our spicy fish. I just don't get people saying "too bland" "too spicy". Recipes are guidelines. I made this according to our tastes. Smoked paprika was the perfect topper. And the use of really good cheese. Looking at a recipe, if it's too spicy, cut back to your taste buds. Not spicy enough? Add more. The recipe is obiviously fine with the author's taste buds. Not always with mine. Common sense. Don't tell me it was bland or it was too spicy. Tell me what worked for your family. Perhaps our taste buds are similar.

uninspiring, not worth the cost of good cheese.

Been making this dish since '01. It's a great side for pork chops, maple glazed salmon.

A decent side dish but nothing special. We agree with other reviewers that the amount of lemon zest and dill should be doubled, and that substituting some white wine and some lemon juice for a portion of the broth improves the flavor. The orzo should be boiled for six minutes (at which point it's raw, not al dente), otherwise it overcooks in the oven. The sauce should not be thickened too much, otherwise the dish will dry out too much in the oven. We initially thought it would taste good with salmon, but it's better with chicken, lamb or pork.

I have made this dish a few times and have always been pleased with the outcome. I used half lemon, half lime last time and served with grilled tequila-lime chicken. The more citrus in the dish, the better in my opinion. It goes great with a white meat or fish. A German Spatlese or a Sauvignon Blanc is a nice complement.

Way to much work for end result. It had many great ingredients in it, but for some reason the end result wasn't any good.

Very nice side dish in a Mediterranean buffet. I added a little lemon juice, a little more lemon peel, and a spoon of crushed garlic. Other than that, it was great and quite popular at a gathering of 12 people. Great make-ahead dish.

I followed the last person's advice and made this with wine, leeks, etc, and it was nice, but nothing dramatic. Definitely takes a lot of work to only be a side dish, but doesn't work well as a main course. Good, but nothing special.

This recipe has good components, but you have to tweak it to really make it worthwhile. I doubled the lemon zest and dill, and used leeks instead of celery. Also, adding about a 1/2 to 3/4c of a dry white wine during the simmering process helped give the other flavors a bit more nuance. Finally, I simmered it for a lot longer than reccommended to get a velvety, thicker sauce. With all the changes I made, it came out very very good and I would reccommend it as a great accompaniment to baked or grilled salmon filets.

My mom gave me this receipe years ago and I serve as a side dish with Pork, Beef or Chicken. It is always a hit. The lemon and dill add a nice twist.

this was great...except that it needed a ton more seasoning. i had to add a lot of salt and much more lemon zest and juice so it wouldn't be completely bland, but even that wasn't quite enough.

A very delicious, delicate pasta dish. Great for dinner parties since you can mix it ahead and bake it later. I would suggest a bit more lemon, but not too much more as you don't want to overpower the delicate dill and gruyere flavors.

I added some lemon juice to increase the Greek flavor- dinner party of 10, it was the hit-

This was a bit bland. I thought the cheeze might give it good flavor, but seems there was something missing. Probably needed more lemon (juice perhaps) and more dill.

Great flavour! I've also tried substituting different cheeses with wonderful results!
