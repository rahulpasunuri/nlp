My husband and I both loved this! My scallops looked a bit drier and more covered with spices than the picture here, but quite delicious! I would have to work on the prettiness factor in serving to make this entertaining-worthy, but that is possible and the taste was excellent!

I love braised red cabbage, and I love scallops, but I have the opposite impression from another reviewer: maybe these things are rarely seen together because they SHOULDN'T be together. Plus, I love colorful dinners, but this was way too much- I couldn't get behind the technicolor. If you want these colors, try the red cabbage sweet potato stir fry on this site, which is great- but I really don't think these spices belong with scallops, and the whole thing doesn't belong with cabbage.

I made the cabbage from this recipe and it was exceptional. Will definitely be making it again and again. I served it with garlic shrimp and some brown and wild rice...one of my new favorite meals!

I served this as the first course at a dinner party and got rave reviews. Everyone liked the subtle flavor and texture contrasts. Prep hints: I braised the cabbage earlier in the day, then re-heated and adjusted seasonings just before serving. Don't crowd the scallops in the pan; sauté them in two batches (or two pans) if necessary so they can be cooked just right.

I must not have as sophisticated a palate as my fellow reviewers. This dish for myself and my foodie partner was tossed directly into the trash two bites in. The flavors did not blend well and the color of everything was utterly unappetizing. A complete disappointment.

Excellent main course. Served with basmati rice and peas. Very colorful. Next time I'll make the following adjustments: 1) I had too many scallops, not enough cabbage. The weight ratio of cabbage to scallops should be 1:1 -- e.g., 1 lb of dry scallops and 1 lb of sliced cabbage. 2) Not enough spice mix to season both sides of all the scallops. I'll double the spice amounts next time --better to have a bit of left over spices than to scramble to mix up more while prepping the scallops. 3) Drain off the final reduction to bowl prior to serving. I left the reduction in the hot skillet while prepared the plates. By the time I got to the 5th plate the reduction was an unusable, thick goo.

So good!! I didn't have scallops on hand so i followed this recipe exactly but with large, scallop-sized chunks of chicken breast. We loved the spice combination (which i left exactly as) and the cabbage was a lovely compliment - both aesthetically and flavor-wise. Would definitely make this again.

We love this recipe! The color combination on the plate makes for an incredible presentation. One of the favorites on my "home bistro" roster. The cabbage alone is great with other foods; served it at our Oktoberfest celebration last fall. I do not agree with other reviewers about the spices being "too much". I make this recipe exactly as stated (one of the very few that I DON'T alter!) and it's delicious. Just popped onto the site to get the recipe to make again tonight, since I can't find my copy of Gourmet with the original recipe.......

I made this for dinner during a sister- bonding weekend. My non-foodie sister's reveiw: "Loved it. COLOSSAL YUM!!! There was crunch, nice blend of spices and very flavorful." I had just picked up scallops this morning thus my ingredients on hand were limited so I improvised using a balsamic reduction with "mediterranean flavors" (from Whole Foods). Sauteed the cabbage in Greek olive oil. The cut of the cabbage will determine how long it takes too cook. Just keep trying it for doneness. To season the scallops, I used a mild Jamaican curry power, nutmeg, salt & pepper. FYI the curry powder included: Turmeric, Foenugreek, coriander, Cumin, Anise, Star Anise, Pepper, Pimento, Colves, Garlic. Next time I may use a little green cabbage as well for added color. Will definitely make again I also plan to use with brussel sprouts which I normally separate the leaves, season with garlic, oregano, salt & pepper and saute with roasted pine nuts. Ah balsamic braised brussel sprout leaves!!! You will turn every non- believer into a fan of any vegetabal. I will certainly use this receipe often with other foods as well.

This is a great pairing of two items I had never thought to combine. The color is jewel-like and makes a great presentation. We love the cabbage portion so much that we use it frequently with other meats. We're having it tonight with grilled bockwurst!

I used 2 chicken breasts instead of the scallops and mixed the spices with flour as suggested by another user. i cut the breasts into scallop size pieces and tossed them into a baggie with the spices. It was great!

Amazing, one of my favourite recipes. I didn't find the spices overpowered the scallops at all, personally, although I would imagine it depends on the size of the scallops. I thought the spices were a perfect complement, delicious!

This was very interesting pairing of two items (scallops and red cabbage) that I would not have put together on my own. But this works. Be sure to taste the cabbage before taking it off the flame. I found it needed more salt and, more importantly, needed to cook about twice longer than suggested before it was truly tender. That said, a pleasant surprise.

I thought the spices were too strong for the Scallops, also cooking time for the scallops weren't long enough as mine came out Briney and underdone (not a good thing for scallops.) I definitely thought the highlight of the dish was the balsamic red cabbage.

We made this tonight and it was delicious. It's not going to knock your socks off with flavors that blow the mind; however, the combination of light and vinegary cabbage with a wonderful spice compliment to the scallops made for a main dish that kept us coming back for more. This was my first time preparing scallops, so those of you experienced with these mysterious sea delicacies will have to weigh that fact with this review. But it was a wonderful introduction to cooking a new type of seafood (for us), and my wife and I most certainly plan to have this on the menu again soon. Definitely recommended.

I really enjoyed this meal. I didn't have any cloves. The balsamic vinegar I used was from Oliviers & Co, and it's sweet. Maybe that helped the cabbage taste a little better. I will make again.

I made this the other night with Scallops from the Pike Place Market in Seattle and they were prepared perfectly. However, the mixture was too strong (I put the mix on the sides and it says only put it on the top and bottom - whoops). And the cabbage was just okay. They way we do cabbage and just about any other vegetable is to coat with olive oil, pepper, johnny's seasoning salt, and add flax seeds and broil for 10 minutes. Perfect every time. This way was a little disappointing. This recipe allowed me to confront my fear with scallops head on!

The spice dusting in this recipe totally overpowered the flavor of the succulent, local sea scallops I used. But I'm saving this recipe 1) to remind me that you only need 1 T. butter to saute a 1 pound batch of scallops and 2) because the cabbage was fantastic. I would recommend using about one-fourth of the spice mixture mixed with a couple tablespoons of flour to dust the scallops.

I am on a no-card diet and this was a great dish full of minerals and fiber. The spice mix was not too strong but very flavorful on the scallops. The cabbage cooked in vinegar turned out smooth and tasty. It is also a good-looking dish.

This was a really great light meal. Also very aromatic, with the balsamic vinegar, cloves, cumin, etc. Easy to cook, the house smelled great (and the spices negated the smell of cooking cabbage)!

Loved the unique ingredients. The cabbage tasted pretty tangy, the tender scallops had a great savory aroma, and the balsamic reduction was a delicious topper.
