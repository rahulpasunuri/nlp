This is great! The bread crumbs add that perfect crunch to the gooey, cheesy pasta. I did add about a half cup of cream cheese and instead of plain panko crumbs, I used Italian herb panko. It was delicious.

Fantastic comfort food. I used quality cheese to elevate the traditional dish, but it was still gooey and delicious. I substituted orecchietta for macaroni and omitted the reserved cooking water, per reviewer recommendations. Both are good tips!

This is the Mac n' Cheese for the rest of my days. I did make several crucial revisions, all suggested here. My key eater was a Kraft-loving, food-hating child. He loved it, as did everyone else. Used oricchette, used no water; let it sit 15 minutes after cooking so it would congeal; added 3/4 ts each of nutmeg, and mustard powder (ESSENTIAL); substituted 1/2 ts sweet paprika for pepper; used mixture of mild and sharp cheddars for young 'un. Note this recipe does not list the few seasonings that are suggested in its ingredient list. The consistency (after the 15 min wait) is gooey and wonderful. I may use only 4 cups milk, next time, for a touch more thickness. But even w 5 cups, it was not soupy. I did use skim milk, but it was lactaid milk, which is thicker than regular skim.

Saved with joy to my picky recipe box. Rich in cheddar flavor, texture is smooth and crust adds the grown-up appeal. I used Asiago cheese bread I had on hand to make the bread crumbs. Get out the bigger pants, this recipe is worth it!

best Mac and cheese ever. IT WILL BE SOUPY when you pour into the casserole dish. It will firm up after baking and resting for about 20 minutes . very creamy . I used cavatappi pasta. Feel free to experiment with different cheeses and additions.

Excellent results - nice creamy texture. Was a bit worried when adding the macaroni, as it looked like too much liquid, but it all baked into a perfect consistency (let it sit as others suggested). I halved the recipe and it made a full 9X9 pan-full. Children and adults alike enjoyed it - might spice it up a bit with mustard/paprika if serving to adults.

I made this with several of the suggested modifications and it is a great recipe. I halved the recipe, used orrichette pasta, added the spices and used about 3/4 cup of gruyere in place of some of the cheddar. The only issue was that 1/2 lb. of the pasta in the halved recipe wasn't enough pasta for the sauce so I added the other 1/2 lb of pasta and once it was baked up that turned out to be too much and a little dry. Everyone still loved it but I would go with 1 1/2 times the amount of pasta.

Absolutely fantastic! I let it rest for about 25 agonizing minutes per reviews & it was amazing. Savored leftovers every day for a week. The topping is really good, but imho it made a little too much; next time I will make a little less.

Cooked this for my new boyfriend and he was in heaven. The only modifications I was were adding a little freshly ground nutmeg, a splash of white truffle oil, and subbed in cream for one of the cups of milk. I took the advice to let it sit on the counter for a while before serving. It was perfect. Most of my guests asked for to take home leftovers.

Darling husband - with the best intentions - got the best (aka the most expensive) white cheddar available ($10/lb). Should not have done. It didn't have enough bite - a Black Diamond brand or other national brand would have provided better flavor I think. I measured & followed the recipe to the 'T' and the consistency was great, flavor pretty good but not cheddar-y or cheesey as I had hoped. Added a fat pinch of dry mustard, grating of nutmeg and a bit of cayenne since it seemed a little flat. That helped, but a more pungent cheese will be used next time - and there WILL be a next time. Good recipe. Thx!

I made this twice and opted for orecchiette the second time to cradle the sauce more. This recipe is creamy and rich without being too much of either. The panko topping adds a lovely texture to the dish. I can see adding broccoli florets, asparagus tips, peas, or caramelized shallots (the latter which I did the first time). It definitely makes a lot of sauce, so I didn't use all of the reserved pasta water. A keeper of a recipe for mac & cheese.

I prefer soupier mac n' cheese to the kind you can slice with a knife and this recipe fits the bill. I followed it exactly as-written. Like a previous reviewer, I was shocked by the amount sauce and hesitated on using all of it. But with so many positive reviews I went for it. It MUST SIT for 15-20 minutes before serving. It congeals, cools down and turns into a delightful, soupy, buy not too-soupy, and oh-so-cheesy dish. I usually skip the breadcrumb topping with mac n' cheese, but not this time and never again with this dish. I brought it to an adult potluck, so added a trio of cayenne, paprika and mustard powder while bringing the milk to a boil. I'll never make another mac n' cheese recipe again.

Rating: 4
I am keeping this as my signature mac and cheese recipe! I used a pound and a half of macaroni, subbed one of the cups of milk for heavy cream and added a little smoked paprika and cayenne pepper to the sauce. The pasta water didn't make the sauce soupy at all and I was very pleased with the finished product's consistency. Definitely a keeper!

Best mac and cheese I have ever tasted. I make it all the time.

Rating: 3
I think the cheese sauce is great - just like my mom used to make. After reading the other reviews, however, I didn't use the full amount of sauce, which seemed like a mistake. The baking dried it out and made the top a little chewy. Next time I'll try using at least 75% of the recommended sauce. Still hopeful about the next try, but it wasn't a big hit this time. I do think it has all the elements of a fantastic mac and cheese, just haven't got my proportions down yet.

This is not solid block, cut it with a knife macacroni and cheese. It is creamy, cheesey, tangy with a crunchy perfect topping. I closely followed the recipe, but not to the letter. I used seashells rather than elbow macroni. They hold the sauce better in my opinion. I also used a mix of mild and extra sharp cheddar as that is what I had on hand. I probably used more Parm than called for, as I didn't measure this. The sauce was smooth as silk. The addition of the starch water did not make it soupy at all. In the end, it was simply the best mac and cheese I have ever had

Rating: 3
I used orrecchiete instead of elbow macaroni, and also used a combination of mild and sharp cheddar, rather than extra sharp, because my kids don't like extra sharp. It probably would taste more flavorful with the extra sharp, but the kids loved it this way. I agree with the others who said that they had way too much sauce. I will need to cook more pasta to add to the leftovers. Also, my sauce turned out a little grainy - not sure if it supposed to be like this, or whether I did something wrong. Maybe because I used 2% milk?

Forgot to mention in my review below that I always make it in one large dish, have never made the individual portions, and it works just fine that way.

I have been making this for several years, and it has come out perfect every single time. I think that the dish might be soupy if you try to eat right out of the over, but if you let it stand and cool down a bit, it congeals nicely, even if 2% milk and the added water from the pasta. I follow the recipe exactly, and cannot say one bad thing about it. The Panko topping is the signature of this dish.

Rating: 4
This is the best mac & cheese recipe I've tried. I've made Martha's recipe, Barefood Contessa's, and Cooks Illustrated and I've feel this is the best of the lot. It holds up well in the oven and does not turn into a congealed lump, as is the case with some other recipes. The flavors are nice and the breadcrumb topping is perfect. I followed other cooks suggestions and cooked the pasta for 5 minutes, which turned out well. Highly recommend.

Rating: 4
Delicious! The crunch from the panko definitely beats traditional bread crumbs. I used a lb. and a 1/2 of pasta because there was too much sauce. It was awesome. I'll use this as my go-to recipe and change up the types of cheddar that I use now and then.

Ok. Wow! This is the Mac & Cheese recipe I've been looking for. Creamy & great for kids and adults. I've read a lot of these reviews and those who said it was soupy were NOT using whole milk. I used 4.5 cups whole milk and 1/2 cup of whipping cream that I had left over. YUM! I added truffle salt at the end. Wow! LOVE LOVE LOVE the Panko topping. My only problem was proportions. I had DOUBLE the cheese sauce and had to make a second pound of macaroni to use it all up. Two pounds of macaroni (8 cups) makes two 9x13 pans.

Delicious and loved by kids and adults alike! This is the first time I have ever made "homemade" mac n' cheese - my kids pleaded, so I finally gave in. I made it for the younger crowd at a dinner party and they all came back for seconds. My daughter has tried many and loved this one. The sauce is thick and rich and with all that extra sharp cheddar, you can't go wrong! I will make this one again and again!

This was easy and super good. It is very rich, and while I was eating it I kept thinking how good it would taste with brocolli mixed in. I halved the recipe and made it in a big casserole dish instead of individual servings. I didn't need the extra pasta water, this was perfectly creamy without.

This was easy and a fast recipe. I made it in the afternoon and reheated it for dinner. It made a LOT of mac and cheese! I loved the topping with the Panko crumbs. The cheesy sauce is also very good. It IS rich and creamy. The only thing I would do to modify this would be to add other things to it if I wanted to kick it up for a dressier dinner. Bacon and peas come to mind. Maybe some tomato slices on the top. But I will make it again as it is-- without dressing it up-- it is good.

Definitely with the don't water it down crowd... In fact, I'd love it to be even more rich, cheesier & fattening! I'm not a good cook & 1st time making something (don't laugh) as complicated as mac&cheese, but it came out brilliantly... & everyone loved it!! Did use 1/2 whipping cream & 1/2 whole milk... texture was creamy perfect w/out the water... a relief since I forgot to save any pasta water. Also used Cavatappi (short, spiral-shaped pasta tubes) instead of elbow which everyone thought was better... Not sure why, but plan to make it my signature mac&cheese pasta! Like other's ideas of adding paprika, pepper flakes & other cheeses... Can't decide whether to mess w. it or not... Really is a perfect, basic & delicious mac&cheese recipe.

I have made this numerous times for varying groups of people and always to rave reviews. I modified it a little. I saute shallots in the melted butter and add paprika to the panko topping. Bacon Bits in the cheese sauce has been recommended and it sounds awesome, however I have yet to try it.

To the Cook from WNY. I will be making this recipe again to go with Ham dinner and it will not feed 20 people unless you are having many other things.

Great Mac and Cheese recipe. I don't typically like a baked mac and cheese, I feel like they always end up dry. I added a touch of white truffle oil and baked just until the top browned. Great flavor, easy to make. Could be fancied up by adding any stronger cheese, such as a blue or even a triple cream brie. This will be my go to for mac and cheese from now on.

When you have a craving for mac and cheese, this is the deal right here. However, I did make a few changes. I used...dare I say it..whipping cream, as I had an abundance of ti I needed to use up. I also halved the recipe. I reduced the salt to a quarter teaspoon, and added a dollop of spicy mustard. I didn't end up using any of the reserved pasta water, as the texture was just right. Excellent. Won't make it often as it's absolutely loaded with fat, but when I get a craving for it, this is the recipe I will be using.

I was looking for a classic mac 'n cheese recipe and chose this one...followed the recipe exactly and it came out just as I wanted, which was creamy but solid, not soupy at all. Excellent flavor. I halved the recipe and baked it in a 9x13x2 pyrex dish. It made 8 single servings for my friends, which left a few people wishing for more! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Ian's panko crumbs, which have much better ingredients than regular Japanese panko...the Ian's can be found in the baking section of most grocery stores (not in the Asian section). Use good sharp white cheddar; can also use gruyere, which melts beautifully. Yum yum yum!!!

Best mac and cheese, EVER. This recipe is probably one of my favorite foods. It's amazing. Do not skimp on the quality of your cheeses or the amount of fat in the milk, and you will not have a soupy mac and cheese (or overdone pasta) as others seem to have experienced. This is a standby in our family, but I wouldn't advise attempting to make this one healthier. It's mac and cheese! Embrace the fat!

The flavor of this is absolutely delicious. I thought it was too soupy though and will use less liquid next time. I halved the recipe and used 2% milk instead of whole since that's what I had in the fridge. I also used store-brand shredded parmesan,since that's what I had on hand. I cooked it the full 25 minutes and then let it sit outside the oven for 10-15 mins before serving. I also added dried thyme and cayenne to the bechamel. I'll definitely make this again with less liquid. I think I'll also half the bread crumbs next time. It seems like there were a LOT of bread crumbs.

Had really high hopes for this one based on the rave reviews, but in the end the texture of the cheese was grainy and mushy, rather than melty. I made the recipe as written but halved. I cooked the pasta for half the time recommended on the package, and the texture of the pasta was just right.

This was fantastic. I left the crumbly topping off one pan, and put all of it on the second one while also adding bite-size pieces of kielbasa to that same pan. Everyone loved them and this is definitely a keeper.

I was looking for a great traditional mac and cheese recipe and this is it. My only mistake was not checking the number of servings ahead of time and ending up with a LOT of it. Though I followed the recipe exactly, I do think calories could be cut by using lower fat milk and less butter in the topping. I am personally not a low fat cheese fan though. It could also be changed up with ham or other spices (I like the idea of cayenne pepper suggested by one reviewer). I also thought the panko was a good change from traditional bread crumbs - I will do that again in the future.

YUM! I made an exactly half portion for my husband and 3 yr old. We finished it in 2 meals. Followed exactly except 2 minor things. I added about 2 tbs truffle butter (yeah, that's right, I went there) and in half i mixed in small cooked shrimp. Loved both plain and shrimp side. Will make this a weekly staple now that we live in London and the food is terrible here!

Made a half recipe in a 9x11x2 pan, with 1% milk, and it came out great. We boiled the macaroni only 6 minutes according to the box directions for "al dente," but I still felt that the noodles were overcooked after baking in the soupy cheese sauce. Next time we'll only cook the macaroni for 4-5 minutes.

This was yummy! I'm not rating because I did not make exactly as specified. I used skim milk instead of whole and Kraft parmesan cheese in the green tube mostly because I had both in the refrigerator. Everything else was as specified. It was very rich even with the skim milk. (It probably tastes even yummier with whole milk and the parmigiano-reggiano!) Next time I'll probably take the topping butter down to 1/4 of a stick and I think the entire recipe will still be plenty rich. PLEASE NOTE THAT MY MACARONI MIXTURE WAS VERY SOUPY, ALMOST LIQUIDY AND I USED A LADLE TO TRANSFER THE MACARONI MIXTURE TO MY CORNINGWARE--I think partially due to the skim milk. It baked down fine to a perfect consistency. So don't be concerned if the macaroni mixture is soupy. PLEASE NOTE THIS DEFINITELY SERVES 20 OR MORE.

This was very good. I was quite worried when I put it in the oven, because it looked VERY soupy, despite the extra simmer time I gave the white sauce. Consistency was perfect though - definitely do not omit the pasta water. I did lighten up the fat, but not by much. Substituted 2% milk for whole, and used "light" old cheddar (4 cups) and light mozzarella (2 cups). Also, I used half butter, half olive oil to moisten the topping. I did not butter the baking dish (with so much better in the recipe, wasn't necessary). I also added about 1/2 tsp of cayenne when I mixed it all up, which was good. I had to bake it for longer than instructed in order to get the colour I wanted in the topping, but only an extra 10 minutes or so. I thought boyfriend was going to faint when he tried it.

Thank you to the reviewer who posted that you could use 1% milk without a problem. It is true! Glad to cut down on SOME calories, yet it was still cheddary-good. Also, I was a bit nervous adding the 1 cup of noodle-water at the end, but I'm glad added it as the consistency was perfect after baking. One last comment: if you have the old Corning Ware baking dishes that are shallow, they work well so all that topping can be used up.

This is my favorite mac & cheese recipe -- so rich and deliciously fattening!

Perfect Macaroni and Cheese in my opinion. My husband said: "Finally a mac&cheese that I can taste the cheese in!" I agree with him. I think the extra-sharp cheddar helps with the cheesy flavor too. The panko topping is so delicious. I did cut the added salt in half because I have a lower salt-taste tolerance than most, and the cheese adds a lot of salt. I get kind of annoyed reading posts by people who complain that this is bland and want to spice it up or think it should be less rich: mac and cheese is a simple, high-fat dish. Come to terms with that. People who want to eat low fat and low carb all the time do not make mac and cheese in any form. If the smooth taste of butter and pasta and the tang of good cheese is not enough flavor for you, then I think you're missing the point of mac and cheese. Adding stuff is fine, but the recipe shouldn't be downgraded because it doesn't inherently have chilies and garlic-that's not what it's about. Either you like simple comfort food or you don't. It's not the mac and cheese's fault!

I thought this was a really great base recipe and will definitely make it again and add my own flair. I halved the butter in the main dish and did not find it greasy. I DID find the topping came out to way too much and drowned my m&c - and I only used 2/3 of it. So definitely halving the topping next time.

I was very excited by the reviews for this M&C, but disappointed with the results. If you enjoy the more Southern style "cakey" mac and cheese, this may be a great recipe for you. If you prefer the creamy-smooth style, keep looking. Very butter heavy which results in an oily consistency. The sauce was a nice consistency and flavor before baking but set up quite firm and cake-like. Was flavorful right out the oven. Only make what you'll eat in one sitting as the dish is not a candidate for reheating.

Rating: 4
Aside from adding cayenne and ground mustard, I was faithful to the recipe. Got it ready, slapped in the pan,refrigerated it, topping and all, until later. It came out perfectly and was subsequently devoured. You would have to be clinically insane to not use panko. *I love panko* One's mind boggles at the reviewer who was shocked, SHOCKED by the fat content of this recipe. Like, you mixed a 3/4 cup butter, a pound and a half of cheese, FIVE CUPS of milk, and a pound of pasta together, and then you thought it was going to come out diet food?

Rating: 3
This was very delicious but *very* rich as others have commented. I halved the recipe so as not to make so much. Added about 1 tsp dry mustard and a few shakes of cayenne as recommended by others. Combined the sauce and macaroni, and refrigerated them separately from the topping. Brought both to room temperature the next evening and baked as directed. As we were eating it, it cooled and the cheese became a rather undesirable consistency. Will definitely make again but will cut the butter by half to try and minimize the oiliness.

My hubby is Gluten intolerant and has not found a good Mac-n-Cheese dish that he likes on this diet. I made this recipe for him using Gluten free bread (toasting it in the oven for coarseness, be careful, not as dense as 'regular' bread) and used Gluten free macaroni (along with the other gluten free ingredients). He said this was the best Macaroni and Cheese he has ever had in his life! And I bet if you came to my dinner table, you would not even know I was serving you a gluten free dish! And I cooked this in my large cast-iron pot. This is a fab. recipe--recommend it to anyone!

This is fabulously good and is a go to recipe, plus it holds really well as a make ahead. I serve half the night I make it, reserve the crumbs separately, and then make the other casserole a few days later and add the crumb mixture at that time. The texture of the crispy crust and the yummy macaroni is perfect. I use about half the butter for the crumbs and sauce but otherwise follow the recipe. There's a reason this has such great ratings-- it's really good!!

This got rave reviews at my house! It's a great basic recipe with plenty of room for experimentation. I didn't have panko so I made bread crumbs from lightly toasted Italian bread. I had a couple of yummy cheeses I wanted try in this. I used a young, creamy Gouda, a 2-year aged cheddar, and some DOP parmigiano reggiano. All quantities were as written in the recipe. Another poster said they thought it was going to end up too soupy and I was a little concerned too, but the baking firmed it up beautifully. I made half to freeze and half to gobble up immediately.

this recipe is ridiculous. i started with thick cut bacon & fried to crisp. i added half as much butter to the remaining bacon fat & did my roux like that. i chopped the bacon & mixed it in with the topping mix. i used smoked gruyere, 10 year old cheddar, fresh grated parm/reggiano & some mozzerella italian mix used for pizzas. also-a half order is MORE than enough. excellent fool-proof recipe with room for lots of personal touches.

I made this for a friend of mine who just had a baby and was feeling a little overwhelmed and she loved it. I used pepper jack cheese to spice it up a little bit and wheat bow tie pasta because that's all we had. I do think there was too much sauce for the amount of pasta I had. I kept thinking "Did I put in one too many cups of milk?" It was way too rich for my blood -- I think if I made it over again, I'd cut back on some of the butter (especially in the topping) and reduce the milk and cheese a bit. But it was a good dish for someone who is breast feeding and can burn an extra 500 calories a day! It's a great comfort food and I think this is the most classic recipe I could find.

Made this EXACTLY as written! Totally fabulous! Brought it to a BBQ with very, very picky kids and... the dishes were practically licked clean. Everyone had seconds. My only advise is... don't be afraid to add the salt (I was thinking that the cheese would have enough, but it was necessary). Also, don't be afraid of the topping (I felt like it was way to much putting it on, but it wasn't). Relax... and enjoy the rave reviews!

This was fantastic! It's definitely going to be my go-to mac n cheese recipe from now on. Some minor adjustments: I did use a good high-quality cheddar, but I mixed in some stilton to give it a little extra kick; I used 2% milk instead of whole; and I also added in some carmelized shallots (sprinkled them over the top before putting on the panko crumbs). Otherwise made the recipe as is. Hit the spot!

I have used this recipe as a base recipe for many variations and each one has turned out exceptional. Sometimes I substitue 2.5 cups of milk with heavy whipping cream or half and half. I also add 1/2 cup to cup of either blue cheese or gorgonzola to cheese sauce, and stir in some grated asiago too. Another excellent tip is to boil the macaroni in a bullion base - chicken, veggie, beef - and add large chunks of onion and cloves of smashed garlic and salt to taste. This gives your noodles a great place to start. For the topping hardly ever mix any cheddar in - unless I have white cheddar - instead I used a mix of Parm, Asiago and Romano. I much prefer the Panko crumbs - much better flavor if you have it on hand. Those are just some variations I've come up with to tweek this great recipe. I highly suggest using good quality extra-sharp cheddar as I have used crumby quality stuff and my mac was WAY greasier than I'd prefer.

We cooked this in a casserole which served 10 easily. One half of the topping recipe was adequate. We also added lobster, cut into chunks, from 3 small lobsters. Beside being delicious, it can be made earlier in the day, refrigerated, brought back to room temperature and baked just before serving.

I followed the recipe exactly except I substituted ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs in the topping. It was VERY RICH and I found it somewhat greasy but very tasty. The sauce/macaroni/pasta water mix was so soupy I could hardly believe it would firm up, but it did. The cheese sauce had a somewhat grainy texture but it did not translate to the finished product. Unfortunately the final test in our house: my daughter didn't like it /sigh. She wanted the "real" mac&cheese (boxed).

My wife has been craving a good home maid Mac and Cheese so I thought I would give it a try. The only changes I made was to cut the recipe in half and I used whole wheat flour, medium cheddar cheese for the main sauce and sharp white cheddar for secondary cheese. I also used Italian bread comes instead of the panko which spiced it up a bit. My wife loved it saying it was the best she has ever eaten!

I made this last weekend for a pot-luck dinner - WOW, it was AMAZING! I think I was a bit heavy handed with the cheese, but as I have said before, is there such a thing as too much cheese? Brought one 2qt dish to party and reserved other 1/2 in individual ramekins and made the next night for company - definitely a winner.

Rating: 4
Stellar recipe in spite of the misleading photo and lead-in. Family cooks should consider halving this rich recipe since it does make TWO full 2 quart dishes. I don't suppose there is anything to prevent you from making these in individual ramekins, although I expect that would take a shorter bake time. Since I was depending on whatever happened to be in my refrigerator I wound up using only 1.5 cups of cheddar in the sauce, with 1.5 cups of smoked low fat Gouda, 2 cups of dilled Havarti, 1/2 cup of cream cheese, and 1/2 cup of blue cheese. I also used 3.5 cups of plain soy milk and 1.5 cups of fat free half and half. The sauce was... AMAZING. I think more blue cheese would be overkill and the cream cheese did make it creamier. Overall, I credit the topping with raising this from a lovely creamy Mac 'n Cheese to something fabulous.

My family loved it (one person gave it a 23 on a 1- 10 score)!. Macaroni and cheese is easy and this recipe is no exception. I added a little dry mustard in the cheese sauce but otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. This is now our macaroni and cheese recipe--no need to look further.

Rating: 4
Took some time but well worth it. I made this a day ahead of time by allowing the cooked macaroni and the completed cheese sauce to cool to room temperature before combining with the (likewise cooled) reserved pasta water (The water helps separate the cooled pasta). I mixed it all, put it in dishes (NO need to butter the bottom!) Then I put the prepped topping over it and covered it until the day of the party. I let the dish reach room temperature again before putting into the over - then cooked it for 28 minutes - it looked like it needed the extra time. Anyhow, it came out PERFECT. Much nicer to make it a day ahead too and then just pop it in the oven!

I have made this twice now with no changes, except for making 1/2 of the recipe and baking in one pan rather than in indvidual ramekins. This is the best homemade mac and cheese I have ever had (including the days I spent in the South!).

This recipe is fantastic! As others have noted, the topping is almost twice what you need for an average casserole dish. When I make this again I will definitely halve the topping recipe. That being said I used a finer quality cheddar in the topping that in the sauce (where I used Cabots extra sharp), and I added a teaspoon and a half of truffle oil. Ooooh la la! This is one of my new favorite recipes. Too bad it isn't lowfat!

great recipe! I have made soooo many different variations of Macaroni and cheese and this is one of the best. It is the closest to how my mother made hers. Using extra sharp cheddar is a MUST! and I think the parmesan takes it to a different level. The breading on top was superb too! It came out perfect. I forgot however to add the 1 cup of pasta water to the dish, but it still tasted great. Maybe next time I can remember to do that and see if it makes the sauce a little thinner, but I thought it was perfect the way it was.

Like buyer's remorse, I had a serious case of macaroni maker's remorse. Sure, the dish tasted good, but just what did you invite family and friends to? This recipe is insanely high in saturated fat, and a 2 oz. serving is not a happening thing for anyone. Get your pasta and cheese fix in a more rational manner!

This is wonderful - I think the cheese you use makes a major difference. There are really bitter cheddars out there. I've made it repeatedly for my daughter, who adores it. We usually use Cabot Extra Sharp. And real parmaggiano reggiano. And it comes out wonderful every time.

This recipe is so simple and so delicious! I followed the advice of other reviewers and reduced the milk by one cup. Perfect consistency - beautiful, creamy and rich cheese sauce. Also based on other reviews, I paid constant attention to the white sauce. It's the only part of the instructions that can make or break this dish. I will make this one again and again!

I have never made homemade mac-n-cheese before and this recipe was a hit. I found the ratio of liquid to pasta a little much...too much liquid than pasta. I worried that this ratio would make the recipe mushy so I removed about 1 cup of liquid. This created a nice balance. Also, I made this dish with thick rigatoni pasta. I like how the rigatoni added a little more of a contemporary look to the dish. Also, the dashes of nutmeg I added to the sauce, as well as to the top of the dish, made this recipe a winner.

This is a terrific recipe.I pretty much followed the directions and served this dish around. this is a large amount and it fine with me.I made 6 single person dishes and one large 12x12 dish and it all dissapeared. I think I made too much topping though. thinner-er is better-er

Awesome - although I used the cheeses I had SO mainly manchego replacing the cheddar, some Parmigiano-Reggiano and some VT Butter & Cheese Co. Goat cheese. Also - I only had a quart of milk so I used 1 C of Butterworks whole fat yogurt. Wow!!

While this was tasty I find it hard to justify the effort required. Other than adding a bit of diced ham I followed the recipe to the letter (although without a scale I had to guess at how much 1 pound of pasta was) and the sauce was not creamy. I used all purpose flour, whisked and stirred like mad, added the pasta water and yet was left with a mediocre (gritty) sauce and TONS of leftovers!

Rating: 4
This is a delicious and incredibly resilient recipe. I made a few minor alterations according to some of the suggestions in previous reviews (1.5 lbs of macaroni, extra parmesan in the topping) and made a couple of minor mistakes (overcooked the macaroni a tad, forgot to add the reserved cooking water, failed to butter the 9x13 pyrex pan), but it was still darn good (and would likely have been even better if I'd managed to follow the recipe exactly) and I think I'm going to make it again next week. I'm going to add a dash of cayenne and maybe some garlic salt, remember to cook the macaroni al dente and stir in the reserved cooking water (leaving the pan unbuttered actually seemed to work just fine, so I'll probably just skip that again), and swap in some gruyere for some of the cheese in both the topping and the sauce. And then the following week I'll probably try a further variation!

As a macaroni and cheese addict all I can say is wow! Creamy, tasty comfort food. I prepared as directed adding only tabasco and dried mustard to the cheese sauce. A perfect meal for a cold winter night with plenty of leftovers for lunch.

We did not like this at all. The cheese left a very bitter after taste. We had kids over who are very happy to try new foods and after 1/2 a bowl stopped. Thankfully the pizza was in the oven and a much better meal. We will not be making this again any time soon. I hate to waste food but this will not be a leftover.

Used whole wheat pasta and added 1 t. each of ground mustard and cayenne pepper and a dash of nutmeg but otherwise followed the recipe. We though it was just okay by our tastes; nothing spectacular.

I'm not a big mac and cheese fan but decided to make this in hopes of appealing to my kids at a small dinner party we hosted. It was a hit! I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. We're making it again for a neighborhood new year's eve gathering of families and I know there will not be a spoonful left over. You definitely should use whole milk on this. If you're going to make a real mac and cheese, why bother trying to lighten it up? Just uconsume a smaller portion of the fully loaded dish and call yourself happy! :)

This is a good recipe, but the sauce proportions are wrong. The sauce produced with the quantities listed produced about double the needed sauce. Also, the topping quantities are also too generous. Had leftovers of that too. If you half the sauce quantities you should be ok.

This is awesome mac n'cheese. I followed the recipe except I did prepare it differently. I used to make the other recipe on this site- the one that is with garlic breadcrumbs, plain and chipotle. It has an easier prep I think. I do the flour & butter the same and then add the milk with salt, pepper and 1 T. ground mustard (from the other recipe-this one's better!) and bring to simmer. Then add this mixture to a bowl containing the noodles/cheese mixed together. I pour the milk mixture over the noodles and cheese and this melts the cheese perfectly. This crumb mixture really makes the difference! Yummy! I guess I just didn't want to have to melt all the cheese in a pan...

So, so, so good! Super easy and a big hit with folks of all ages. Teenagers actually asked me for the recipe. I opted out of the topping and used ritz crackers as suggested by another user. YUM!

I gave this 4 forks altho I had a problem with graininess, which was my own fault. I should have used whole milk instead of 2%. Also should've let the bechamel cool just a bit before adding the cheese. Then add the cheese a little at a time. Research indicates that you don't have to use an expensive aged cheese; in fact, a cheaper version is preferred. It helps the sauce hold together better. I halved the recipe and poured it into a 2" deep, 11" diameter round ceramic dish, and it was the perfect container. The mixture looked very runny but baked into a perfect, creamy dish. I've been eaing leftovers for several days (microwaving), and altho it's a congealed, nasty mess in the fridge, after microwaving it is still creamy and delicious. The topping isn't so crunchy after m'waving, but it's still tasty.

Best mac and cheese I've ever made!! 1/2 of it was enough for 6 adults plus leftovers. I made a second even tastier batch to which I added a generous sprinkle of mustard powder and double that of cayenne powder. I also added only 1/2 cup of the retained pasta water and subbed cheddar jack for half the cheddar.

This was delicious and surprisingly easy to make. I did not have any bread crumbs or panko on hand, but thought it tasted great without it. The only thing I would do differently is cook the pasta a little less prior to putting it in the oven. The noodles were a little overdone for my taste. I also cut the recipe in half and am very glad I did! I found that it was still a bit too much for a 9x12 pan, and added the extra to small crocks... which came out Fantastic! Enjoy!

A good choice for children. Mild and rich but comforting flavor. Don't be tempted to pile it all into a deeper casserole dish, the topping will be very thick and won't get quite as crunchy as it will in the less deep dishes.

I am a bit dumbfounded as to why this didn't taste better than it did. Good care was made in the preparation of this dish. I am not a big fan of extra sharp cheddar though.

I've been looking for the perfect macaroni and cheese recipe for years,and I think this is finally The One. I prepared a half-recipe, which scaled down well. Added about 1/2 tsp mustard powder; next time I will probably reduce to 1/4 tsp. I only had medium cheddar, but it still tasted great. The panko makes for a fluffier crumb topping than regular breadcrumbs. But the recipe would be great even without the topping, so don't hold back if you don't have panko on hand.

This is phenomenal mac and cheese. I've made it many times now, varying it a little each time, and it's always great. Most of the time I make it healthier by using 2% milk and whole wheat pasta (this recipe is great with rotini) and I promise you it will come out just as rich and delicious as the original recipe. Sometimes I'll even use Kraft pre-shredded 2% milk cheeses when I'm making it for my daughter (milder than sharper cheeses) mixed with other cheeses like Manchego, Parrano, that sort of thing. Sometimes I add a pinch of nutmeg too. I don't always add the pasta water - only if the sauce seems a little too thick. EVERYONE I serve this dish to raves about it. My picky-eater toddler absolutely loves it, and my husband can't keep his face out of the leftovers. It really is THAT good.

This recipe was fantastic! I actually modified it to fit my sons Gluten Free diet (He has Celiac Disease) and it was so good, I couldn't even tell it was gluten free! Instead of the all purpose flour I used Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free All Purpose flour, and then used Ancient Quinoa Harvest Elbow Pasta. I also added just a pinch of dried mustard to add a kick. Everyone in the house loved it, and my son, who has yet to really find a great gluten free mac and cheese, was ecstatic! I would serve this (gluten free) to guests without hesitation!

Good, basic mac and cheese recipe. Fairly easy to follow. Followed recipe to the letter. It made a little too much for 9X11 pan. Took out a little sauce. Should have taken out more pasta and left in the liquid as it is slightly dry for my taste.

I've made this for my family and for my friends at college several times, and they all love it. One of my friends almost teared up talking about how much he loves it the other day when I told him I'd be making it again. It's that good. The only difference I make in the recipe is that I use crushed Ritz crackers for the topping in place of the panko. After trying a range of things (including panko, fresh bread crumbs, saltines, and various cheddar crackers), nothing beats the Ritz topping. =)

Lost my favorite mac and cheese recipe, so tried this. Too greasy. Proportions are wrong--way to much sauce for the pasta. Way too much topping. (I used the right pan.) Needs a little chopped onion and/or minced garlic sauteed in the butter before making the roux. Could reduce the butter by about half, probably. Or change the whole milk to 1%. Because of the bread crumbs, the only way you can reheat this is slow, in the oven. And there are lots of leftovers. I will reduce the bread crumbs and omit the cheddar from them. Will still use the Parm in the crumbs, though.

Astoundingly good mac and cheese. I did not add the cup of pasta water because I simply forgot to set some aside. It turned out fine without it. I also added a bay leaf to the milk while it simmered.

This was the 2nd time I've made this. College son comes home for summer and somehow he mentions homemade mac n cheese.

I have a great red Fiesta 9 x 13 baking dish and it was just beautiful. Who'd have thunk mac n cheese could be so fancy and delish??!!

I love reading all the reviews that are less than 4 forks. Here are some tips: if you want your sauce level to be just right, cook it right. If you sut everything in a deep dish, it will take a while to cook (and probably burn your toppings). Cook the Mac-n-Cheese about 2 inches deep, then you will have perfect sauce levels. It will absorb like it should and the excess water will evaporate out in the oven. The topping is really good. I used a 24 month aged white cheddar, and it was pretty rich. The kids liked it okay, but the box stuff has been the norm for the most part. I may "dumb" it down a bit next time and use a more common, less sharp cheddar. The kids are sure to enjoy it more then.

My family loved this recipie. They don't like breadcrumbs (crazy, I know), so I cut half a loaf of sourdough bread into small cubes and then tossed it with the butter and parmesan cheese (omitted the cheddar). For the sauce, I added a bit of mustard powder as well as salt, and pepper. I also sauteed some panccetta and leeks and added them in when I combined the pasta and sauce. This is the only recipe I'll be making from now on!

Excellent recipe! The sauce has a to-die for creaminess, even if you don't go for the full fat version. I made half the recipe and used 2% milk and less butter. Because I like my mac and cheese with a little bit of a kick, I added a little mustard, a pinch of nutmeg, some onion powder and cayenne - just enough to spice it up. I was eating it off the spoon! Mixing in the cooking water is key - the sauce really thickens up in the oven and the extra water makes sure it stays creamy beneath the crusty topping. Will definitely make it again.

OK, I can't resist changing recipes. I made an "adult" version of this. Inspired by a scalloped potatoes recipe, I added 4 oz of blue cheese into the mix - it's not very strong, trust me. I also use more cheese than is called for, and heavy cream instead of milk. Also, I forgot to save some of the pasta water, so I added white wine instead. Absolutely the best winter comfort food. NOT something for every week, but it is definitely a keeper!

Wonderful comfort food! It's cheesy alright and it hits the spot when you need it. It's a wonderful recipe to cook a couple of times per year just the way it is-cheesy and full of fat. Just keep the portions small, add a salad and some grilled meat and you'll be ok.

Wow! Being a southerner, I am extremely picky about mac n'cheese but this one is fabulous! I halved the recipe, omitting the topping, used orrichette pasta and added about an 1/8 of a cup of bacon bits for smokiness. Baked it in the oven and it set up perfectly. The key is to grate the cheeses yourself. Pre-shredded cheese seems to seperate and/or get grainy. This will be my go to recipe from now on!

This is the best Mac and Cheese recipe out there. I have made it for many guest and they love it and always want the recipe. It is a must to use Panko crumbs. This recipe should be tried by all.

What could be better -- an easy and yummy recipe !?!? halved the recipe and added cayenne. Would consider adding a bit of sauted onion or shallots next time.

This dish was talk of my Christmas dinner. I fixed it as a side dish for the children, but the adults raved about it and finished every last morsel. They are asking me to fix it again for New Years.

Classic Mac & Cheese! I missed reserving the cup of water as per recipe however.. layered a cup of diced tomotoes with juice just like mom used to do. It is the perfect comfort food for a cold Canadian night! We made it again following recipe; either way it is most enjoyable!

Delicious! Wonderful comfort food, perfect for a cold winter night. I used skim milk and 2% cheddar cheese, but other than that, followed recipe. Sauce thickened well, turned out great! Yum!

Absolutely delicious. As with so many simple recipes, the quality of the finished product depends on the quality of the ingredients; I used a blend of sharp and mild cheddar cheeses, and organic milk and butter. I also added steamed broccoli to make it more of a full meal. The sauce looked too thin at first but after standing on the pasta for ten minutes the consistency was just right.

Made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it - even my boyfriend who "doesn't like mac and cheese." changed a couple things... added a block of gruyere to cheddar for sauce. After pouring sauce over cooked macaroni, I folded in a 1/4 pound of boars head smoked ham (cut in cubes) and frozen peas. Then I topped with plain panko breadcrumbs and shredded parmesan on top. I baked in oven covered in foil at first and took off foil to brown the top. It was very very cheesy and delicious. will be my go to recipe.

YUM! I made this for a "vegetarian comfort food" dinner party and everyone loved it. Used 1% milk and it worked just fine. Also, subbed Pecorino for the Parmesan and I used 1/2 cup of gruyere in place of 1/2 cup of cheddar. Delicious! My only complaint is it didn't get quite hot enough- perhaps my baking dish was too deep.

This is a great home-style macaroni and cheese! The sauce is creamy and flavourful without being overwhelming. I halved the recipe, which still made enough food for eight generous servings. I followed the recipe exactly, then added 1/2 tsp. dry mustard and 1/4 tsp. cayenne. I'm not sure why some people felt there was too much sauce - perhaps they didn't cook the roux for a full three minutes? I used medium cheddar since my boyfriend objects to sharp cheese. It was delightful - just like my mom used to make!

Really good. Really easy to make adjustments with different types of cheeses, add-ins, etc. Great for large groups as this recipe makes plenty!

Halved the amounts in this recipe and it came out great! The crust on the top might be the best part. I think re-heating it should be done in the oven to save that tasty topping.

I think this recipe has a good base but made some adjustments. I used extra-sharp white cheddar, added 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper and 1 tsp of dry mustard. To make it more of a full meal, I also added chopped ham and broccoli, and even with the additional items, I still felt there was way too much sauce.

Delicious! My boyfriend proclaimed it the best mac n' cheese he'd ever had. I was able to clean some cheese odds & ends out of my fridge for this recipe, using a a local cheddar-style cheese (with 2% milk) for the main sauce and a mix of Gruyere and cheddar for the topping. Next time I'd add some finely diced hot peppers for a bit of a kick.

I tasted the macaroni and sauce before baking, and it was pretty good. In the baking process, the sauce was absorbed into the macaroni. It left the macaroni "uncoated" and kinda bland. I wouldn't make it again.

This was excellent. I simply could not bare to use that much fat in my food though. I used 2% cheddar, skim milk, half I cant believe its not butter in the cheese sauce, and omitted the topping. It was still amazing. For Thanksgiving, I will make it again using full fat ingredients.

Believe it or not, have never made mac n cheese (always dieting), but my husband loves it and I love to cook, so thought I would try this recipe. Delicious! I made half, used strozzapreti pasta, and added pancetta. I didn't have full milk, so used 2 cups non fat and 1/2 cup heavy cream. At first, I thought there was too much sauce for the pasta. I made it a day ahead, let it sit 30 mins outside of fridge, added topping and cooked and it was perfect. I had even forgotten to save the cup of water and it didn't seem to matter. I wouldn't use as much sauce if I were serving the same day, but sitting for a day made it appropriate. Will make again...when not dieting.

I find most mac and cheese sounds a lot better than the finished product tastes. This is an exception. Great taste and the topping is sensational (I used sourdough crumbs) I halved the recipe, because I'm the only one who eats it, and froze the rest as meal size packs and it comes to work with me. Yum.

My favorite macaroni and cheese recipe! For a creamier dish, skip the baking part altogether--perfect comfort food!

For 1/2 recipe(8 oz elbows),I cut back on the butter for both topping & sauce by 1/2. I did add some olive oil to compensate. For the topping I used french bread crumbs & reduced the cheese by about a third. I used 'Wondra' quick-mixing flour for simplicity. No lumps! Simple & fantastic!

I made this on a whim one Sunday evening to go along with my friends Panko-crusted pork chops. I have to say: it was a great meal! I made a few goofs and a few additions to the recipe though. For one, I was in speed-cooking mode, so I pretty much did everything at once. I didn't let the sauce sit under wax paper (no biggie I guess), but managed to rem the cooking water. Additions I made were that I chopped up some pepper bacon and sauteed some garlic to throw in there for flavor, also added in some red pepper flakes. I also used some really nice conch shell pasta instead of elbows. I used some pretty good parm, and just some cheapo Whole Foods 365 cheddar, but the next time I think the recipe could do with a variety of different cheese combos. I also think I could have cut the sauce a bit (as others noted) and added a bit more of the topping -- love that crunch! :^) All in all, it's going into the file, but make no mistake that this is not fat or calorie-free. Make it once or twice a year when your crew really needs it.

Delicious and memorable! A friend asked for the recipe, 9 months after she had it at our house. A favourite more with adults than kids; my toddlers prefer it without the topping, so I usually make half with and half without the breadcrumbs.

Mmm...comfort food at its best. I loved the topping. I made it exactly as the recipe called for and it was sensational. I took more liberties with the cheese combination for the sauce. Well, the truth is, I didn't have enough sharp cheddar and didn't feel like hitting the grocery store again. I used 2 cups of medium cheddar, 1/2 bag of Trader Joe's 4 cheese blend and about 1/2 of a small wheel of brie. It was fabulous! I cannot imagine a better recipe. The mixture of all the cheeses was smooth and delicious. I will definitely do this again and again.

This is really, really good. It's admittedly weird to add water in the sauce, but it came out perfectly. It's classic comfort food. It also works well as a make-ahead, prepared a day or so ahead of time and then baked when needed.

Good but not fantastic. I added more cheese then called for to give it better flavor. The topping was OK but did not really give it as much flavor and crunch as I thought it would

Outta this world! The changes I made were due to lack of ingredients or errors. I used salted butter and omitted the 2 tsp called for in the recipe. Had to use 2% milk, medium cheddar and (I'm so embarrased) parmesan from the green can. Also forgot the cooking water. But it STILL turned out fantastic! I could have licked the pan clean...in fact, I may just do that later tonight.

Very creamy and delicious. EXCEPT: Roux takes a long time to boil... standing over it is a chore... a little too much Pecorino/Romano, it tasted sometimes like an Alfredo sauce rather than a bake... so, I stirred in some (forgive me) American cheese slices and more grated cheddar. The topping was out of this world!

Follow the directions exactly, don't overcook the macaroni, use high- quality cheeses, and this will turn out beautifully. It's true that it will look soupy as you pour it into the baking pan, but it bakes up to a perfect consistency. I add 1 tsp paprika and about 1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce because I like the extra flavor, but it isn't necessary.

Rating: 3
Based on the other reviews I added a little extra pasta (about 1.25lbs), but I don't think I needed to do this. Maybe it is because I made the dish a day ahead, but there was very little sauce. I also added mustard and red pepper to add a little flavor. Good standard Mac & Cheese, and easy to prepare ahead.

Rating: 2
I can't recommend this recipe. It is unnecessarily fatty and heavy. If you halve the recipe as i did, you are still using 3/4 of a stick of butter. Eeew. It was also rather bland, even though I added a few things to kick it up (mustard, pepper). I usually make mac and cheese with a recipe from Joy of Cooking, where you make a mixture of milk, eggs and paprika and pour that over mac/shredded cheese. Much lower fat and more intense cheese flavor. Also, I didn't add the cooking water (dump cooking water into mac and cheese-- ick!), and it was somewhat dry as a result. If you do make this, use the cooking water as directed.

This basic macaroni and cheese is delicious. I used a little bit of heavy cream for a small part of the milk since I only had 2% and I added cayenne pepper and dijon mustard for a little spice. I also used whole wheat flour and pasta for added texture. High quality cheeses are definitely important as this dish relies so heavily on them. The panko bread crumbs add a nice crunch.

This was fantastic. I really don't care for mac and cheese but I had blocks that needed to be used and my daughter loves it. I used sharp cheddar and montery jack with a few left over cheese ends. It was a bit spicy and will reduce it next time ( if you usually eat spicy food it won't be spicy to you)And i added the tsp of mustard. I also just toasted 3 pieces of a hearty wheat bread for the topping. It came out great!

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and my mom and sister loved it. My sister especially enjoyed the crispy topping. I halved the recipe because I definitely didn't need so much. I've made it a couple of times since and I've added more cheese for a bit more kick. All in all, a great recipe.

I liked it but it was a bit much for Mac N cheese when the kids love the powdery crap in a box. I was the only person really savoring this flavor while everyone else was expecting easy mac. This is probably best served at a pot luck.

I always add some mustard powder and cayenne pepper (about 1 tsp of each) in the cheese sauce to give this more flavor. I also mix the cheddar cheese in the sauce with a small amount of emmental or gruyere cheese (same total amount of cheese). My boyfriend's teenage daughter loves this recipe, and would eat it every night if she could!

For a spicy kick, I subsituted half of what was called for of the grated extra- sharp Cheddar with Cabot Habanero Chile White Cheddar. I also included the Parmigiano- Reggiano. Adding diced ham and seeded Roma tomatoes made it a lot more interesting. Great comfort food on a snowy evening.

I made this tonight and couldn't wait until it was done. Boy was I disappointed! It lacks flavor and it more closely resembles a noodle kugel. I will try this again but I will definitely increase the amount of cheese I use and will use more varieties of cheese to add more depth of flavor.

SO GOOD! I halved the recipe & baked it in a 2.5L casserole. But we certainly didn't get 10 servings out of it, more like 4- 6. I substituted half fontina for the cheddar, and added 1t of worcesteshire sauce & 1T of grainy mustard to the cheese sauce (but might try nutmeg instead next time). I also used WW elbow macaroni, and no one could tell. But the best thing about this dish was that panko/cheese topping! OH MY GOOD HEAVENS, it was wonderful. Of course it didn't stay crispy on the refrigerated leftovers, but still, it was very tasty. I might even use it on my tuna casserole instead of crushed kettle potato chips, it was THAT good. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This is the basic baked mac and cheese casserole you know and love. Following the suggestion of other reviewers, I halved the sauce, and ended up running out halfway through. Frantically making two or three more small batches while attempting to layer the cooked macaroni, sauce and grated cheese in my baking pan was not fun. It's up to you to embellish this with whatever additions you like - I added a little sliced ham, a chopped slice of bacon, a small chopped onion and two cloves of garlic at the beginning of making the sauce. I also used a mixture of jalepeno jack, medium tillamook cheddar, parmesan and romano. The addition of a little dijon mustard, a couple squirts of hot sauce and a pinch of dried rosemary helped to cut the richness. I ended up with easily 10 servings - a full 13x9 pan of cheesy, spicy goodness.

Absolutely delicious, but I agree that if you only use a pound of pasta, you have WAY too much sauce. Either double the pasta or half the sauce and it will be perfect. I used at least a pound and a half of pasta. That being said, it has great flavor, is easy to make, and freezes well. I also added peas and ham!

This was excellent and my first attempt at homemade mac and cheese. I made a few substitutions. I used 100% whole wheat pasta and I used half skim milk and half 2%. I also added a small bit of cayenne pepper. It was creamy and cheesy with just the right amount of crunch in the topping. I'll be making this again and will be experimenting with different cheeses.

This was very easy to make and was eaten by adults and children alike. I baked it in individual servings as advised but the 20 servings listed was more like 8 for children 5-7 years old.

My girlfriend and I made this recipe for just the two of us. Being a mac and cheese fan I found it to be delicious dish. I particularly liked the use of Parmigiano-Reggiano and the topping adds a nice texture variation. I find it easiest to eyeball the ingredients when working with a roux. To add a little kick I added some cayenne pepper.

Perfect consistency and texture. Fabulous flavor. I am truly puzzled by chefmlm's comment. Perhaps he did not bake this long enough. When poured into the baking dish the recipe is intentionally soupy; the liquid then reduces quite well while baking and the flavors get absorbed by the macaroni. Great recipe, try it. The cooking times and temperatures worked great for me. Don't take it out of the oven until it has reduced a little and you're in for a treat.

I thought this was quite tasty, and didn't think there was too much sauce. The pasta soaks some of it in -- plus, this is homestyle mac & cheese, there should be lots of sauce. I did add crushed red pepper for a nice kick!

This recipe flavor wise is fine...I suggest that you double the pasta and cut everything else in half. You will have a soup bath mess of pasta otherwise. Come on guys that amount of sauce for a pound of pasta. I subbed some of the milk with beer. I also used very high quality ingredients making this by far the most expensive mac and cheese but pretty good. Add procuitto for a good twist. I would make again with adjustments in quantities. I hope the novice reads this before they make it or they will be disappointed to say the least.
