To El Paso, venison may have "almost no fat," but then it wouldn't be breakfast sausage, would it? You need the fat, especially in sausages, not only to carry the flavor, but to avoid, dry and tastless sausages. Sure you can make no-fat, or almost no-fat, sausages. You will not have the quality of flavor or texture. Personally, I would prefer to eat less sausage and reduce my fat that way, than to eat pore quality low fat sausage.

I've never followed a recipe in my life and was happy to see it sanctioned in this one. I mixed ground pork & beef, using a aromatic herbs and peppercorns for the seasoning. Great in patties and added to soups & bean dishes.

Venison (deer meat) trimmed and with all blue membrane removed is almost NO fat.
