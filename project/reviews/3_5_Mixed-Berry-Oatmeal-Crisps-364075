Made this with frozen raspberries and blueberries. Didn't sugar the berries, used only 1/2 cup sugar in the topping; great sweet-tart combo. Takes no time at all and it's really tasty!

We loved this and was incredibly easy to make. I used fresh berries (raspberries, blackberries, and bluberries) and tossed them with about a teaspoon of sugar. Cooked it for 4 people, so took it out of the oven after about 28 minutes. Covered it with tinfoil and when we ate it it hours later, it was still warm. We ate it after a big southern dinner, and it was the perfect dessert. The ice cream is a must.

This is such a great recipe. It is easy and unbelievably tasty. I like the mix of tart and sweet from the berries and toppings, respectively. I would definitely recommend making this!

This was an easy and delicious dessert! I made exactly as recipe calls for, and it was perfect. I added french vanilla ice cream after it cooled. If I hadn't added the ice cream, this would have needed a small amount of sugar- the frozen fruits were a bit tart by themselves. Very easy, and went over well with even the pickiest eater. My only complaint- it wasn't quite as fast as it seems. It was easy to put together, but the cooking and cooling time caused it to take about an hour, from preparation to eating time. I would definitely make this again!

I used mixed berries - blackberries, blueberries, raspberries and strawberries - and it was perfectly sweet. It really depends on your fruit, so you need to taste your fruit to see if it needs sugar. I didn't use nuts in my topping so added a little extra cinnamon and oatmeal. Made in a large gratin dish. It was a huge hit with kids and adults - big enough for party of 8. Takes 10 minutes to prepare - so easy.

Needs sugar. I followed other reviews and added 6 T. sugar. Also added a little lemon to berry mix and nutmeg and salt to the topping. Very yummy. Two forks just because I had to make the adjustments.

I used mixed berries just as the recipe indicated - I think the strawberries in the mix added the needed sweetess. So easy - it was a great dessert for company - I could enjoy my guests. And the reviews all around my table were great. Will make again - and maybe try with peaches and raspberries.

I used blackberries from last summer and I would have added some sugar to the berries. They were a little to tart for my taste. However this is a super easy recipe and I would make them if in a pinch for a dessert that is quick....just add some sugar to the berries with the cornstarch.
