The whipped cream is a must! It's too rich without it, but Oh God is it goooood. For coffee lovers, this is a great dessert.

This is one of my all time favorites. So decadent and delicious. However, demitasse cups are too small. I doubled the recipe and made it in ramekins, creme brulee sized. Made whipped cream with mint extract and garnished with fresh mint. Amazing.

Amazing. I have made it for two parties and people rave over this dessert. The recipe says not to bring it to a boil, but if you don't it won't set right. Make sure to stir continuously, bring to a boil (three or four full bubbles) then take off the heat.

Wow! Great and very rich. I also had trouble getting mine to set up. But put it back on the fire and rescued it! In the future I will cook it on medium and stir constantly. It will take longer than 5 minutes. I took at least 15. But do not stop stirring or it will curdle.

Absolutley delicious. My uncultured offspring claimed it tasted like pumpkin pie as they inhaled this delectable treat. The Cardamom lends it an unexpected flair. I suspect when next I make this, and I most assuredly will, I'll reduce the Cardamom by 1/3. I think a little more subtlety would enhance it's presence.

This is as good as any creme caramel I've lusted after. I made it precisely as advised with the exception of apportioning it into 4 servings, which was perfect. Just right. It's rich and creamy, prefectly textured. The cardamom adds an element of mystery and the whipped cream cuts the egg further. An absolute masterful dessert. FYI, I made these a full 30 hours before I served them.

This is a great recipe! I love cooking with cardamom since it is an unusual spice. I used a Kahlua spiked whipped cream and dark chocolate shavings as a garnish to give it a nice look.

mine didn't set up, so I made ice cream from it, really delicious!

This was quite delicious! Too bad the portions are not LARGER.

i made this a few weeks ago and while it was delicious i found it to be a bit grainy. i can't complain though because i didn't strain it. i will definitely try this again and follow directions (not my strong suit) very dense and rich, i served it in espresso cups which seemed to be a hit.

I can't wait to make this again. It is so easy, and all of my guests said I better make this every time they come over!

Absolutely addicting.

Intensely coffee-flavored, delicious and so easy! My only complaint is that it made just four servings. I skipped the whipped-cream topping, but would add it when serving it to guests.

I made this for a dinner party and received raves all around. Used crushed cardamom pods instead of powder and strained them out. I added a 1/2 tsp of Mexican vanilla. I made it in normal size coffee cups because my husband loves his sweets and didn't want me to "skimp." But we both agreed that a demitasse would have been the perfect serving. It is very rich! Topped it off with the whipped cream and a chocolate-covered espresso bean.

Very good and very easy to prepare. Had no Kahlua so I substituted a capuccino cream liqueur by Godiva. Served with Chai spiced cookies for dessert after luncheon of wild alaskan sockeye salmon and grilled asparagus.

Haven't made this yet, but would think you could make double strength espresso and use 2-3 Tbs. instead of the powder - might even be better? Sounds incredibly rich, if not cloying, but I suppose that's why the small serving.

I meant to give it 4 forks, and I'll make it again.

This was as close to excrutiating as tasty gets: elegant, slightly mysterious and very easy to make. I finally found medaglia d'oro espresso powder and thus was able to follow the recipe exactly. A sublime sweet that reminded me of the great chefs in France who believe no meal is complete without a piece de la resistance dessert. Thanks to mew1949 for the tip.

To pbonefirst from millerton, ny: in a pinch, you can use granulated instant coffee (I like Nescafe). Just double the amount to make it extra strong.

Help! Please! What is "espresso powder"? I looked everywhere for instant espresso, but didn't find any. I have some espresso roasted coffee beans...should I just grind them really fine? I'm afraid of gritty texture even if I strain. Making this on Sat...
