I've made quite a few charlottes in the past. And I make them with fromage frais in stead of whipped cream. A lot less calories and still delicious! I've made charlottes in the past layered with ripe sliced pear, fromage frais without sugar and melted chocolate, and repeat. Yummy.

I followed the recipe exactly and found the finished charlotte to resemble soggy bread with bland jam in taste and texture, and not at all "mindblowing". Maybe my storebought ladyfingers adversely affected the outcome? A very disappointing innagural use of my charlotte mold ($38 at Williams-Sonoma).
