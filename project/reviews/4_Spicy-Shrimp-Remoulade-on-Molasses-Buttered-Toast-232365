These were absolutely amazing. I had several guests comment about my chef skill and one asked me to cater her next party because of these... There is definitely too much sauce for 8 ounces of shrimp. To fix this I decided to tripled the amount of shrimp and diced them and I had to double the number of pumpernickel slices. Made more than enough for my guests! As for the molasses butter, I was a little put off by the negative comments about it but tried it any way and it was completely worth it.

This is a quick "stand by" type recipe that is not going to offend anyone, but I definitely would not give it 4 stars. I loved the concept of the molasses butter, but in reality I did not think it added much flavor. A good option if you have hungry guests and you need an additional protein based appetizer.

Excellent! A very popular appetizer.

Although the shrimp mixture was very good - the remoulade was perfection -the molassses toast just didn't meldn any way with the rest of the ingredients

I've made this so many times. Everyone always loves it. I often spice it up a bit more - but is perfect as written. Also a very forgiving recipe.

I thought this was great, as did my guest. My husband thought that the molasses butter didn't add much, but I thought it gave a subtle "little something".

Very very good! I made a few adjustments to the recipe and this will be a keeper for many years to come. I used only 3Tbsp of butter but kept the same amount of molasses and chili powder. Per other reviewers, I doubled the amount of shrimp but kept the same amount of remoulade sauce. I also roasted my shrimp in 2 tsp olive oil plus salt and pepper, coursely chopped them and then tossed them in the sauce while still warm. It took a while to figure out what Westphalian bread is - a very dense German pumpernickel bread. Most specialty grocery stores will carry it; you are looking for a small square package of bread not a big loaf.

Delicious and quick. I have made this recipe several times. It makes a lot of remoulade for the amount of shrimp, so I increase the shrimp by 50%. I never have ketchup around, so I substitute sundried tomato paste. I also have chili-molasses butter left over, which is wonderful on baked sweet potatoes.

I have made this remoulade many times.I usually skip the toast and serve jumbo shrimp for dipping. I have offered both the remoulade and traditional seafood cocktail sauce to my guests and there is never any remoulade left over. I also make this sauce at least one day ahead.excellent

Definitely make the sauce the night before to let the flavours blend. I didn't notice that the molasses butter added any flavour to the overall dish.

This was a great app for a cocktail party last night. Made the remoulade the night before and all the flavors blended nicely. Doubled the shrimp and added a few hours before serving. The mixture was tight enough to top the toasts without being runny. The westphalian toasts did not add a distinct flavor for me, perhaps I didn't use enough of the butter mixture. I'm willing to give the toasts another shot but the shrimp could easily be served on plain toasted baguette and be just as good. Oh, forgot the chives for the top and didn't miss them. I scraped the leftover shrimp off of the toasts and am enjoying it on a piece of Naan as a wrap for lunch. Delish!

Unusual and very good. The shrimp are perfectly spiced.

I've made this recipe several times and it is wonderful! I usually use bay shrimp instead of the medium shrimp called for. They are cheaper, and I find them easier to deal with when pileing them on the toast. Make these great little guys and you'll be glad you did!!!

made this recipe several times always to great reviews. I use bay shrip insteady of the larger shrimp sugested in the recipe. They are easier to eat on the toast, cheaper and made the dish better all around.

I first tried this recipe on July 4th and it was an instant success, two thumbs up. I agree with other reviewers who added more shrimp than the recipe called for. I added quite a bit more................

Love this - have made it many times to rave reviews. I add more shrimp because the sauce can go farther. Try to find the westphalian bread - worth it!

Not good. Did not like the toast and shrimp mixture was nothing special. Only a couple of compliments from guest(being nice).

these were very good. I used maple syrup because i could not find anything but blackstrao molasses. the flavored toasts really make it special. i will definitely use again

I made lots of this and was happy that we had so much food on 4th of July that there are left overs. It is terrific and easy to put together. The spicy taste is just enough to set off the taste of the shrimp. The sweetness of the bread also comes through so don't skip that part.

Made these for a dinner party last night. They were fabulous! I more than doubled the recipe and all were gobbled up. I grilled the shrimp which I seasoned with creole and seafood seasonings. Then I cut them up and folded them into the remoulade sauce. The molasses toasts were fantastic.

This is FANTASTIC!! Very easy, yet elegant presentation. Tastes GREAT! Just a little kick. The first time I made it I didn't have any moleasses so I used dark corn syrup. Didn't notice much difference from the next batch when I used molasses. STOP READING AND MAKE A BATCH NOW!!!

I made this for some friends and they loved it! I added more shrimp, like suggested. I also used regular molasses and it was fine.

Delicious and easy to make - I followed a few suggestions and increased the amount of shrimp, and also didn't use all of the remoulade sauce. These canapes were wolfed down by everone - only wishe that I'd made more. A keeper.

I think this a fantastic recipe. I just sent it to a caterer so he can make it for a party I'm giving. My only crtitique is to double the shrimp quantity.

This was so delicious and easy to make! I used regular molasses in the amount that the recipe called for and it was fine. All of the flavors blended so well together. One thing that I would suggest is adding a bit more shrimp to the remoulade to make the consistency a bit thicker. It was a really delicious and impressive hors d'oever!

Very yummy! Easy and little work. Perfect for a party. Do be careful not to overtoast the pumpernickel. They are too hard if overdone.

I made this appetizer for a party last Saturday night. It was outstanding! All guests, including the few seafood haters, couldn't stop raving. I think it would be incredibly tasty with lobster, as well.

Sorry all - I disagree. These were awful. I followed the recipe exactly. Waste of time and shrimp.

This was fabulous. EVERYONE (including shrimp non-lovers) enjoyed. Made this recipe exactly as written. I wouldn't change a thing except the quantity. Make more!

YUM!!! As mentioned in another review, this is an excellent hors d'oeuvre dish. I couldn't find light molasses, so I mixed equal parts dark molasses with corn syrup.

Delicious! I tripled the amount of shrimp, and would make the following recommendations. Instead of tripling the remoulade sauce, I would only double it next time for the 1 1/2 pounds of shrimp. Mine was a little soupy. The original amount of molasses butter called for was plenty for the triple amount of shrimp. And I could not find a loaf of good pumpernickel at my grocery store (just those gawd-awful cocktail loaves), so I used a nice fresh-baked country loaf instead.

This recipe is truly fantastic. It is a perfect cocktail party hors d'oeuvre. I love the combination of all the flavors, especially the molasses butter. Don't leave that out. One caution; 8 oz of shrimp wasn't enough for me. I barely eaked out 16 toasts. Perhaps it was the size of the cocktail bread I bought but the next time I will buy a pound of shrimp for 32 toasts. They will get eaten!

This is fabulous, but there is an even better Remlaude Sauce from Bon Appetit many years ago. Unfortunately, it isn't a recipe that they posted, but here it is....just mix everything in the blender: 3 chopped scallions 3 Tbs creole mustard ¼ cup ketchup 1 Tbs American yellow mustard 2 Tbs white vinegar 3 Tbs drained horseradish 2 Tbs parsley 1 tsp minced garlic 1 ½ tsp lemon juice 2 tsp creole seasoning ¼ tsp tobasco 1 ½ tsp paprika dash cayenne ½ tsp salt ¼ cup olive oil *can be made three days ahead

Outstanding! I added a little extra lemon juice.

I made this for a dinner party starter and created 8 addicts! Everyone raved. The shrimp itself is great, but the real secret is the sweet spicy toasts. I recommend following the recipe exactly!
