This recipe was good, but not the best I have ever had. There are other recipes on epicurious (particularly tenderloin with port sauce) that are much simpler, but tastier. It definitely cooks faster than the recipe states so keep an eye on the thermometer.

Excellent dinner party recipe...I DEFINITELY agree with the readers who state that 1 hr. is too long-we roasted it for 40 minutes; tented for 15 and it was a perfect medium rare. Also-we use thinly sliced prosciutto rather than bacon-delicious flavour and no splattering!!! I serve it with smashed red potatoes with goat cheese and horseradish...

I make Beef tenderloins all the time,I turn the oven up to 500' preheated for 10 minutes put beef in oven uncovered for 20 minutes (med rare in the middle for a 7 lb tenderloin ----15 minutes under 7lbs ) turn oven off leave in the oven 10 minutes DO NOT OPEN THE OVEN take out let set on the counter 10 minutes before serving it will be perfect!!!!!!

very simple, easy dish. I roasted two tenderloin roasts totalling nine pounds. 45 mins at 450 is plenty for a nice medium, be sure to let sit up at LEAST 15 mins, dish even better the day after. Would make again when occassion warrants.

Watch out for the bacon grease! The grease splattered all over the oven and set off the smoke alarms. If I did this again I would loosely cover the roast with foil in the early stage of cooking. Also, my meat thermometer went on the fritz and I had to wing the temp. An hour and our huge tenderloin was medium-well to well. It was a beautiful roast and putting it together the day before was a nice time saver.

the result was aesthetic, but the truth is that there are much better recipes for beef tenderloin. it was good, but considering that it was one of the best cuts of beef, it was underwhelming. not something i would stake a client dinner party on.

Excellent way to prepare beef tenderloin. I also did not use rosemary branches but instead rubbed the meet with chopped, fresh rosemary, kisher salt and pepper. The bacon keeps the roast in a place for a beautiful presentation. I served the meat with 3 different sauces: horseradish, mustard chive, and rosemary mayonnaise (all on Epicurious). I only had to roast the meat for appr. 40 minutes however - perhaps it was smaller than the one in the recipe - so I would suggest checking the temp after 30 minutes.

This was the first time I've made beef tenderloin and I was impressed. The bacon made this dish look beautiful. The rosemary can be a little overwhelming if you do not prefer herbs. We prefer our meat med. rare. I just made sure I payed attention to the themometer. It took about an hour. I would make this dish again for lets say a brunch or party because it looks so good.

I made this last night using a 3-lb pork tenderloin and adding 3 thyme sprigs to the rosemary. I cooked it for the same amount of time at 350. It was unbelievable -- it literally melted in our mouths. Now that the price of beef is out the roof, the pork was a great substitute.

This was easy and delicious. A hit for a buffet sliced thinly with silver dollar buns on the side. I would definitely make it again. I used very thinly sliced bacon.

First, allow me to admit that tenderloin isn't my favorite cut of beef. But, our local Sam's club had overbought for the Holidays, and the price was too good to pass up. I, following the advice of other reviewers, had my husband roast it on the grill. Instead of using whole sprigs of rosemary, I ran the leaves thru the processor with some garlic, ground black pepper, and olive oil. I rubbed that on the meat, then wrapped it in the bacon. While the roast was fine - again WATCH YOUR TIMING! - I'd really prefer a cut with more flavor, even if some tenderness is sacrificed.

Disappointed in this; we used a 4 1/2 lb tenderloin and an instant read thermometer so the temperature was perfect, yet the meat was a little too dry for our taste. But it LOOKED fantastic.

Excellent recipe. Make sure you buy quality bacon though to compliment the cost of the tenderloin. The meat was tender, juicy, and great even the second day. I would definitely make this recipe again.

This is a great dinner party recipe. It's so simple, but it looks and tastes like you spent the whole day making it. 1 hour is way too long; plan on a minimum of 30 minutes and keep checking the temperature.

This was the best meat I have ever eaten and I grew up on a cattle ranch! The meat melts in your mouth. Since I'd never splurged on tenderloin before I didn't know it's not normally cooked that long, but it was delicious.

I agree with other reviews here, an hour is too long, I would try 45 minutes next time. Still tasted great though. Will definately try it again.

Main course that I served at a dinner party and it was a HUGE success! It was delicious! I agree, an hour was too long. The meat was not as rare as we prefer it, but the flavor made up for the lack of rareness. Highly recommend preparing it earlier in the day, so that all you have to do is put in the oven once your guests arrive.

I put this on a gas grill, indirect heat, for about 1 hour. Too much bacon for the oven, IMO. Great taste.

I am not sure about this one. The flavor was great and we enjoyed eating it. But cooking it, smoked up my kitchen since the bacon grease kept splattering everywhere. Maybe I used the wrong pan?

I made this for my own birthday dinner last Sunday because I'm worth the cost of the tenderloin! It was also my first experience making a tenderloin. This was great, however, I made one change. I made a paste of crushed garlic, rosemary, olive oil,kosher salt and pepper and put the paste into the slits and over the meat. Then seared the meat, let it cool for a moment and then put it on the "bacon blanket". Really watch the temp as this is pretty much done once the bacon gets good and crisp. Served with green onion/ cheddar potato cakes and sauteed spinach with red onion and yellow peppers. Can you say YUM and Happy Birthday in the same breath!!

I am a butcher. Tenderloin is too expensive and too nice to ruin with a lot of rosemary! The garlic is nice, and bacon is always a nice touch. However, an hour is WAAAAAY too long to cook it -- you need to do about 500 degrees for no more than 25 minutes. If you don't want the fat from the bacon, use olive oil all over the tenderloin, and sprinkle the top with a mix of salt, pepper, and maybe a little marjoram. In response to another reader, filet mignon does NOT come from one particular end of the tenderloin -- a filet is just tenderloin cut into individual-portioned steaks.

I don't eat large servings of meat,so the cost wasn't a deterrment.This is easy and good and you can easily substitute chicken breasts for the filet of beef.I would grill some mushrooms while the fire is hot also.

I also tried it with a round roast because of the cost and it didn't go that well. The round roast is too large to cover with the bacon in one wrap and the bacon peels off so it doesn't cook evenly even with toothpicks. I ended up taking the bacon off because it was burning and the roast wasn't cooked enough. The finished product tasted fine - we actually enjoyed the flavors of the rosemary and garlic (especially when you hit upon a piece of garlic that had been hidden in the meat, but it was way too much work and quite expensive. Much prefer beef with a garlic and herb rub mixed with olive oil. Easier to do, less expensive and tastes fantastic! Might make this one again if I hit the lottery and can afford to buy Beef Tenderloin.

Beef tenderloin is an expensive treat. In my opinion,rosemary's pungency is too strong,whether fresh or dry. Mixing a rub of dried marjoram, coarse salt, freshly ground black pepper and brushing with olive oil infused with crushed garlic is another option. I'd forego bacon, brush with olive oil.

Not to impressed with this one. It is just basic. I did cook it on the grill and that was nice. The rosemary was very overpowering. I used rosemary out of my garden, don't know if that had a difference.

Technically "beef tenderloin piece (large end), trimmed" is what you get filet mignon's from. My butcher was going to charge me about $12/lb for it. So, instead I used a bottom round roast and it worked out great! Use tootpicks to help keep the bacon in place. And dried rosemary is fine, just use more of it (I sprinkled it all over the bacon before I wrapped the roast). Easy to prepare and my guests loved it for diner.

This was the first time I ever made roast beast but; my husband thought the rosemary was overpowering and the bacon didn't crisp... it wasn't pretty. But, it was my first try and the blame could have laid squarely with moi.

This dish came out great. This was the first time I've ever made roast beefand it was so easy. My boyfriend and I loved it. It tasted even better the next day.
