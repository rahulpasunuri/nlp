I've never been a big fan of papaya, so I was surprised by how much I loved this salsa. Colorful, easy, and flavorful. Will definitely make it again.

very good. If I make it again I'd use serrano chiles instead of jalapeno.

Fantastic salsa. I made it exactly as described and it was perfect! I just added a little extra jalapeño because i like spicier foods. I will definitely make this again.
