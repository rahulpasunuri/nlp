Creamy mushroom and potato goodness. Read reviews that it was bland and there were boil over problems. When I finished the leek and mushroom mixture I salted it to taste. It came out perfect! great texture and just enough cream.

I was thrilled to find this recipe, an idea I had had for a Gratin. The reviews that said it was bland made me a little wary, but it turned out really well. I have to say I think sometimes when things don't work out, perhaps its the ingredients? I know from making thing with out of season peppers or tomatoes that it really affects the flavor? The leeks I had for this were amazing and strong, but not enough. I used Crimini because it's what I had and its 1 1/2 hours to the store. I did up the amount of Gruyere, not by much, used good wine (too good), home-made stock, and Yukon gold potatoes. I used half and half because thats what I had.. this is going in my regular rotation- we had it with a fantastic nitrate-free ham and asparagus, but I'm thinking it's good with turkey or chicken, AND it reheats well. The potatoes and mushrooms, tang of the cheese and winey sauce are fabulous.

I agree this is a bland dish. The premium gruyère was lost - as was most of the flavour - the cream covered it all up. My end result was soup-y - I think I'd use half the amount of liquids if I made this again. But I won't make it again - there are far better gratins out there.

I made this dish last night (not a special occasion - I simply had leeks and potatoes at hand) I didn't have many potatoes but quite a bit of leeks, so the ratio of leeks - potatoes was doubled and now reading other reviews I think it made a big difference, you want the leeks to out-weight the potatoes. For the same reason I ended up with a shallower gratin, potato-leeks-potato Vs 2 layers of potato, also used less cream (only 250 ml) which also made a difference as I see many reviewers had the "boil-over" problem, I didn't. Less mushrooms, I only had portobellos and some jarred truffles, but I think the recipe can do with or without the fungus, I did use the same amounts of butter and made sure a few of the leeks caramelized. I covered the dish with foil and uncovered for the last 20 minutes to finish reducing the liquid and finalized it at 7 minutes on the broiler and it came out perfect and delicious, boyfriend couldn't get enough. Used regular gruyere which worked out well. Somehow the odds of not having many potatoes, or cream and having lots of leeks worked to my advantage.

This is very yummy and I've been asked to make it for my family's Thanksgiving dinner. I used Yukon Gold potatoes, Swiss cheese and baby portebello mushrooms. To avoid the complained of spill over, I covered the dish with foil, removing it during the last 15-20 minutes of cooking for the final browning.

This recipe was okay, but not outstanding. It smelled delicious cooking, but flavor-wise, it lacked punch. I'll try it again, but maybe try a different cheese or add more garlic.

this recipe is exactly as it is described....a rich and elegant special occasion dish. I've made it for Christmas 3 years in a row. Everyone loves it and there is never any left. I make it exactly how it says to....except, I can't always find the oyster mushrooms, so I just substitute sliced button mushrooms, and it is still superb. I will continue to make this again and again.

Loved this recipe. I agree that it was bland...but second time I made it I used smoked gouda...made all the difference and gave it some pop.

Gruyere was lost in this dish. I was really hoping it would stand out.

I'm not sure why so many people felt this was bland -- this dish is absolutely incredible! I added a bit more garlic and leeks and substituted veggie broth for the chicken and shittakes for the oyster mushrooms. Next time, I'm going to increase both the leeks and mushrooms and make the dish as a vegetarian entree. YUM!

I made this for a Christmas eve party this year. It was a huge hit! I will definitely be making this again!

I really wanted to like this dish, but found it mediocre at best. I used a very good Gruyere, but it was lost in this dish. In fact, the Gruyere, leeks and mushrooms all sort of faded away and the dish overall was very bland. I made the dish strictly according to the recipe. If I tried this dish again, I would leave out the mushrooms, add more cheese, and either add more leek or substitute thinly sliced onion. It wasn't bad, but for all the work and expense (the cheese alone was $10), I was expecting something much better.

Looked for a potato gratin recipe on the site and picked this one because the addition of leeks and mushrooms sounded interesting. It wasn't. It was watery and blah. I didn't taste the "richness" other reviewers talked about (though I do appreciate the warning about the run-over). I'm sure there are better gratin recipes out there and I'll keep looking.

Did anyone else have a problem getting it to be a sticky gratin? Mine came out runny like scalloped taters, but delicious all the same. Didn't think it was too rich at all. My adjustments: 2tsps of salt, more black pepper, and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. Plus truffle oil in the mushroom saute pot because the oyster shrooms would be overwhelmed by the other ingredients. Served with bratwurst, then pork loin. French pinot noir went perfectly.

I love this dish! It's easy, makes a good presentation and is of course delicious.

This recipe is both easy and delicious. I've given it out to several friends and plan on making it for Thanksgiving. For a lower fat version, saute the leeks and mushrooms in 1/2 butter 1/2 olive oil and use 2% milk instead of cream.

Excellent dish, but very rich. There had been a holiday run on gruyere, so I substituted fontina. It was a bit of trouble, but not too much for a dinner party dish. We served it Christmas Eve to raves. There were some leftovers which I sprinkled with white truffle oil and reheated a few days later. Leftovers were never so good!

Substituted Havarte cheese instead because I couldn't find Gruyere at the time I was shopping for Thanksgiving. It was just heaven in a pan. Everyone raved about this dish and there were no leftovers!!

I thought this was a really nice dish. I used a combination of mushrooms (oyster, shittake and baby portabella). I think that it's important to use a good quality Gruyere, otherwise the cheese won't add enough flavor. Also, make sure to adjust the seasonings - with the low sodium broth you may actually have to add a bit of salt. The leeks were a very nice touch. Guests loved it.

I would expect any dish with so much cheese and cream to be remarkable (I love Gruyere!). However, this dish went un-noticed at a dinner party. I felt the leeks didn't add much -- I'm sure there are other gratin recipes which have much more flavor!

Rating: 4
This is a very rich dish, so I would recommend serving it as a side for a simple meal. I made it for our Y2K New Year's feast, accompanying filet mignon and asparagus. It is a spectacular special occasion dish. I will definitely make this again...perhaps for Christmas 2001. Addendum: I made this dish again last week, omitting the mushrooms and adding some bacon bits and arugula (inspired by another gratin recipe on this site). AMAZING.

This is indeed the finest potato dish I've tasted in a long time. I made it for a dinner party and people took seconds and thirds. The oyster mushroom and leeks really added to the dish. Instead of chicken broth, I used college inn garden veg. broth. I'm making it again for friends. IT WAS DELICIOUS. A DEFINITE KEEPER

Rich and delectable! We loved this dish. Comfort food at its best. We omitted the mushrooms; we're not fans of fungus. We used half gruyere and half smoked gouda. DIVINE!

Very rich! I also used Gouda instead of Gruyere and it turned out great. I did have boil over as some mentioned, but other than that it was simple to prepare and tasted oh so good.

Who needs a special occasion to make this??? This dish is fabulous. The best potato dish I've ever eaten. I made it on an ordinary Saturday night just for myself and served it with BEEF TENDERLOIN STEAKS WITH PORT-ROSEMARY SAUCE (also found on this sight http://www.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=268)

One of my favorite dishes, in fact, I just put a pan in the oven. I usually omit the mushrooms, for some reason I prefer it that way. I always use yukon golds and, when in season, I get home-grown leeks at our Farmers Market. I've started using swiss instead of gruyere and can't tell the difference. This has been a huge hit whenever I've served it. Leftovers, if there are any, are delicious, too.

I made this for dinner last night - halved the quantities and made it in an 8" square glass dish - and it was superb. The only change I made was to substitute ordinary mushrooms. My husband, who generally turns up his nose at anything he considers 'creamy' came back for seconds and told me I 'could serve this to anyone' ! It WAS rich and it wasn't a quick dish to prepare either - lots o' chopping and measuring. I solved this by making the other parts of the meal simple - a rotisserie chicken from the local deli , a big, crisp green salad and a glass of white wine. Delish !

Decadent, but worth it. It is possible to "lower" the fat content (by no means will it be low fat) and still have a great dish. I did not add all of the cream and broth mixture, so boil-over was not a problem. To shorten the cooking time, before assemblying the ingredients I quickly parboiled the potatoes.

Very rich dish. Watch out for boil-over. Always gets rave reviews when served. It's great for leftovers but doesn't freeze well.

Rating: 4
Really outstanding combination of flavors. I made it at the last minute for dinner guests. didn't have oyster mushrooms, so substituted regular, plain brown ones. Also, didn't have Gruyere on hand, so use good quality smoked Gouda. Wow -- it was excellent. My husband isn't even interested in tasting it with the gruyere - he says it was perfect this way. Definately a keeper.

This is a fantastic side for special occasions. This year will be the third year we've made it for Christmas Eve dinner - it's become a staple. The only change I make is to prepare it with mixed wild mushrooms instead of just oyster mushrooms.

I made this dish to accompany my easter ham, and found the flavors of the thyme and mushrooms to be too strong for this particular meal. It was very rich, a little too much for an already elaborate meal.

I also agree with the other reviewees, this is a very rich dish for special occasions. I made it with a ham Christmas dinner too. I also covered with foil and had the boil over problem. This one is a keeper.

This was a wonderful dish to prepare for a dinner party. Much of it could be prepared ahead. The flavor was wonderful and got rave reviews from all. One lady, who lived half way across the country had to take a copy of it with her. I served this with ham and it complimented it nicely.

Very nice dish (less complex than it looks). Used a dish with very high sides, so bubbling over not a problem. Everyone really enjoyed it!!

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious! I halved the recipe, and while making it decided to cut the amount of potatoes down just a bit so everything would fit. I also took the advice of another reviewer and covered the top with foil for the first half hour, and also the advice about using Yukon Gold potatoes. The flavors were wonderful, and the texture of the potatoes and mushrooms was great--not overdone as I worried they might be.

Rating: 3
I had the boil-over problem, too, in a 13"x9" pan and I thought the top got a little too crusy. I'd either cover it with foil for the initial part of the cooking or add the top for the last 15-20 minutes. Everyone did love it, and I printed out several copies of the recipe.

This is a really wonderful thing. I brought it as a side dish at a pot-luck dinner party, and it stole the entire show. Make it with Yukon Gold potatoes; they produce better results in a gratin than do russets.

This was an excellent make ahead potato dish. I was kind of worried about the boiling over element, but mine didn't. I used baby portabellas instead of the oyster mushrooms, and it was great.

Be careful! Liquids boiled out of my baking dish (the recommended size) and caused quite a clean up job.
