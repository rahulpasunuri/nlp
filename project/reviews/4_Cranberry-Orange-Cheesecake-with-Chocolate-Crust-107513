I made this for Christmas. I thought this was excellent. I made it according to the recipe (how can you give an honest review if you are going to change it drastically) with a few minor changes. I used light cream cheese instead of regular cream cheese, and did not put the cheescake in a waterbath. Instead I placed a pan of water on the rack beneath my cheesecake. I find this method more to my liking. Very nice orange flavor. I will definitely make again

This is the first time I've ever made a cheesecake. Was scared I would ruin it somehow, but this recipe was easy and straightforward. I made it for a fundraiser at work and it sold out.

I made the crust and used some Ginger-Curry-Cranberry Sauce as filling. It was pretty good except I put too much butter in the crust, so it didn't hold together well and crumbled easily.

I couldn't find fresh cranberries at my grocery store in March. But, I just dipped a few fresh raspberries in melted chocolate and placed them around the perimeter. The cake was delicious!

This has become our family tradition for Christmas dinner. I don't change the recipe in any way. It's perfect as is and not nearly as difficult as it looks - the kind of dessert that gets lots of praise for the chef but doesn't take hours to prepare. You'll love it!

Previously made this cheesecake to great applause. However, this Thanksgiving decided to marry the topping with another cake from Fine Cooking website, "Flourless Choc and Vanilla Marble Cake" as had guests watching fat content. That cake is superb as well, very rich so goes a logn way but only uses 1 pkg of cream cheese (used low fat with no discernible loss of flavor). That cake also is like cheesecake but much easier to make and it freezes beautifully. To this cranberry topping I added dried cherries, a clove of star anise and half tsp of vanilla which really took it to another level.

This is the first cheesecake I have ever made, and it was fabulous and fool-proof. I took it to a Thanksgiving gathering, where there were at least 10 other desserts on the table, and it disappeared while other desserts were untouched.

This is always a crowd pleaser. I've made it for several years now and always use this recipe when I take something somewhere during the holidays. The presentation is absolutely gorgeous and the topping covers any imperfections in the top of the cake. One of my standard holiday desserts.

Great special occasion dessert! Everyone loves it and asks for it again. Relatively easy and you can sub low/no fat cream cheese or sour cream for some of the cream cheese to lessen the caloric attack.

Made this for Christmas and it was delicious AND beautiful. People thought it was professionally made when they saw it. Everyone thought it was super yummy. I used low fat cream cheese, and you couldn't tell. I also added and extra teaspoon of orange peel to the filling. To save time and energy, I used chocolate cookie crumbs that are already finely crushed.

Gorgeous presentation and so delicious! I used Annie's brand organic chocolate bunny cookies and 60% dark choc chips for crust and it was perfect. I cannot wait for a reason to make this one again! My springform pan is an 8 inch and I did not use a water bath. Turned out beautifully in 60 minutes.

My guests loved it. I cook the cranberries longer than the recipe states. I improvised on the chocolate crust (chocolate wafers are hard to find!) And I had a heavy hand on the orange peel. Beautiful. The tart cranberries with the orange are a great combo with the chocolate crust. Takes time to prepare but worth it.

I'm not a fan of cheesecake, but this one makes my mouth water. It takes some time to prepare, but it can be done in stages and a day in advance of serving. I don't change a thing from the recipe, except maybe increasing the orange peel because I love that combo with the chocolate and cheesecake filling.

I have made this cheesecake a number of times and it is always a crowd pleaser. The chocolate crust is perfect with the light orange flavor of the cheesecake. The cheesecake is light and creamy without being overly sweet. The cranberries make this special -- I cook them a little longer than the recipe recommends.

Rating: 4
This cheesecake came out amazing and everyone loved it! The orange flavor of the cheesecake was so delicious without being over the top or phony tasting. The cheesecake had a wonderfully creamy consistency -- not too dense, and not too soft; just perfect! I did not bake in a water bath because I don't mind cracks on the top of the cheesecake when there will be a topping covering it. Also - I would cook the cranberries a bit longer so they become sweeter. I took them off the stove as soon as they started to pop. The topping was a bit too tart and I think cooking them longer would've helped. It didn't matter though because it was so good and it looked so beautiful! Thanks for posting the recipe, I will definitely make it again.

Made this exactly as written, and it was spectacular; great presentation for the holidays. Unlike some reviewers, I thought the orange flavor in the cheesecake was perfect; subtle but definitely there. The contrast in tastes between the tart cranberry, bright orange, and deep chocolate made for a great flavor explosion with each forkful. Wouldn't change a thing!

Rating: 4
Amazing! I followed the directions except for the baking method. I did not use a water bath, but used Ina Garten's method instead: baked at 450 for 15 minutes, lowered the temp to 225 and baked another 1 hr 15 min. Then turned the oven off, cracked the door open, and let the cake sit for another 30 minutes before taking out and cooling at room temp. It worked perfectly. I would make this for any holiday celebration. Yum!

This really is the perfect holiday cheesecake. Excellent flavor and very easy to make. We couldn't find chocolate wafers or the pre-crushed Oreo's so we scraped the cream from regular Oreo's. A little too sweet - will use Newman's in the future. One complaint I have is the baking time. I left it in 60 minutes and it wasn't enough. Should have trusted my judgement and given it at least another 5 or 10 minutes as it fell apart when cut. Otherwise a big hit.

Rating: 4
I've made some great cheesecakes off this site, but I think this one was the best. Such a lovely combination of flavors. The orange and chocolate and slight tartness of the cranberry. Perfect. I used newman's O-s for the crust to avoid all the artificial sweeteners and other stuff in regular cookies. Fab. The best crust ever.

I made this cheesecake the first time I met my boyfriend's mother. I made a whole Italian inspired meal, and knew that cheesecake would be a hit. I made them in small white Ramekins I purchased from Pier 1 for $1! (They still have them.) When they were finished, I used a double boiler to melt some chocolate chips and I drizzled chocolate over the top. They loved the fact that they had individual cheesecakes, and I refrigerated the rest of the batter and made more later in the week! Best cheesecake for any occasion! I am making it again this week for Thanksgiving. (A request from my bf's mom. :)

This recipe is a great combo of flavors, especially as the end to a big dinner. The cranberries and orange give zing to the mellow cheesecake, and the bitter chocolate crust sets it all off well. Don't mess around with this recipe--make another cheesecake, if you must.

This cake looks beautiful on a holiday celebration table. The first time I made it in the 9 inch springform and the middle of the cake was not set (though I had left it in longer than recommended). The next time I doubled the crust and cranberry topping and made two 9 inch tarts instead (divided the cream cheese filling between the two tarts) and it turned out just right.

Rating: 4
I altered the recipe a tad and used a simple graham cracker crust and added all the zest from a medium orange into the cake, then used another orange for some zest in the cranberry sauce mixture. I thought it was very delicious. I will to try the chocolate crust next time. I also used a water bath and the cake turned out perfect. Also increased the cook time by about 5-10 min by turning off the oven at 55 min. and just leaving the cake inside for a little bit longer. I would make this for any occasion, THAT'S how good it is! Plus, it freezes well:) It's also very good w/o the cranberry sauce, but....come on, the cranberries are what make it really goooooood.

Excellent! I made this for Thanksgiving along with some traditional pies. What a hit. We're still eating it. I used a combination of light, regular, and fat-fre cream cheese to lighten it up a little. Beautiful presentation. Pressing the crust into the pan was the trickiest part.

Almost a 4. Big wow factor in the way it presents. Tasty and easy - I actually followed the recipe for a change - I agree the cheesecake itself could use a little kick - if I'd had some Gran Marnier that probably would have done the trick.

Great recipe. An easy cheesecake that is festive and beautiful! Nice combo of sweet and tart with a crunchy crust. I used a little grand marnier in the cranberrys.

Rating: 4
Oh so tasty! The orange flavor was very subtle, so I would go a little heavier on zest next time. Also, make sure you check the center of the cheesecake for doneness (should be set, but slightly wobbly), as the baking time in the recipe was not quite sufficient. Otherwise, everyone at my dinner party loved it- even those who claimed an aversion to cranberries ate the whole thing! Don't let the tartness of the sauce discourage you- the flavors blend very nicely with the sweet/richness of the cheesecake and chocolate. Excellent!

I don't know about the rest of you, but any recipe that can win me $60 to my favorite sushi restaurant in a Christmas party dessert contest has my vote. I have made this cheesecake twice now, and it's the first cheesecake recipe I've ever used. I'm about to make it for the 3rd time now for my parents, who have never tasted it. I know they'll love it. It's not too heavy, but has a great body to it and the cranberry topping is just a perfect compliment. The cheesecake is somewhat simple, but that's the best part because it can't be dressed up any way you want!

I've made this several times around the holidays. It's easy, unusual and very popular. The sweet cheese cake/tart cranberry combination is great. To avoid an over-sweet result, try Paul Newman's chocolate wafers for the crust. They are chocolatey but not as sweet as other brands.

Delicious, creamy cheesecake. I added the zest of one orange and a TB of Grand Marnier, and the orange accent was perfect. I used regular cookies, but added the chopped up chocolate for the crust and liked the result. The cranberry sauce was not liked by all and labeled as a little bitter. I decorated with slices of fresh orange a bittersweet chocolate curls, and gave the sauce on the side.

My first attempt at cheesecake, and it turned out perfectly. I took the advice of a previous reviewer and put it in the freezer after baking. It didn't crack and it looked beautiful.

I made this dessert for Christmas dinner. I used orange segments, whole cranberries and holly leaves to decorate the top and it looked very festive. Although many of my guests loved it, I felt the dessert was too rich with the chocolate crust. If I made it again, I would use a regular graham crust. Although I chilled it overnight, it still didn't cut into nice wedges; the middle was too creamy, even though I followed the instructions precisely for cooking time. Some of the guests, however, liked the creaminess and felt it added to the yummy taste. I was disappointed when my lovely presentation "fell apart" when we put it onto the plates.

Rating: 3
I made this to use up the last of my cranberries. It's a great combination of flavors. I made it as written and thought the orange flavor was just right. The tart cranberries are the perfect foil to the creamy cheesecake. I did have to double the cranberry topping though. Once doubled it was the perfect amount of topping.

Wonderful! I made it for Christmas dinner and will be making it again for New Year's Eve. I followed the suggestions of other reviewers who felt the orange flavor wasn't strong enough, so I added about a tablespoon of Grand Marnier to the cheesecake filling. Wasn't able to find fresh cranberries, so I used a can of whole berry cranberry sauce with a tablespoon of Grand Marnier and a couple tablespoons of orange zest. Overall it was easy to prepare, elegant, and tasted fabulous!

Festive, easy, beautiful and most importantly delicious! Made it for 2 different Christmas parties, everyone wanted the recipe. Added orange zest to the crust to boost the orange flavor - yummy!

Definitely a big hit! I added a bit more orange zest as well as sour cream and heavy cream to the mixture, as I like super creamy cheesecakes. I also couldn't find chocolate wafer cookies on Christmas Eve so I just used regular graham crackers in the crust (omitted the chopped chocolate as well), and it turned out fantastic. Also, I recommend cooking this at 450 for about 15 minutes, then at 250 for the remaining time. I found that it did get a little darker around the edges than I like, and most cheesecake recipes call for a temperature change throughout cooking. There was pan big enough for me to do a water-bath, so I just put a pan of hot water on the lower rack of the oven for the benefit of the steam. I made the cranberry sauce the night before and just served it on the side because we have some family members who do not care for cranberries. But the taste combination was perfect. Nothing beats cranberry-orange!

Excellent! It was the first time I made a cheesecake who's top didn't crack! The texture was perfect, and the cake was even better the next day. I would recommend putting some orange extract or extra orange rind in the filling, because the orange flavor was barely noticeable. I also cooked the cranberry topping a bit longer than the 'popping' stage.

To San Antonio - try freezing your cheesecake in in the pan first before transfering to a serving tray or platter. I always freeze mine and have no problems removing it without the crust cracking. It's also easy to pre-slice it cleanly with a heated knife when frozen.

I wanted to make this cake for Xmas so I decided to try it out on my girlfriends. It was a big hit! To Julie from Woodbridge, if you use a springform pan it separates quite easily and I think the cracking may be from overcooking - take it out a little earlier next time and don't worry - they'll still eat it with the cracks.

Question-- my cheesecake cracked on top- anybody else have that problem? When the recipe says to slide a knife down the side, am I supposed to go all the way to the bottom or stop when I hit the top of the crust? I'm very much a novice. This is my first attempt at cheesecake and I don't want to mess it up.

I decided to make this after the stores had sold out their fresh cranberries, so I used a 9-ounce jar of Knudsen's whole berry sauce instead. I also used Oreo cookies (reduced fat!)as suggested by another poster, plus a few drops of orange oil instead of grated peel. I highly recommend getting a bottle of the latter; it keeps forever and gives you all the orange flavor without interfering with the smooth texture of the cheesecake. It looked beautiful and tasted wonderful. One of the attenders of the potluck to which I took it thought it came from a bakery--the ultimate compliment!

I've made this cheescake twice now during the Christmas season and love it. I agree, use the Oreo crust it's much simpler and yes it did take 60-70 minutes to cook completely. I would also make it at least one day before serving so the cheescake has plenty of time to set-up. The filling is a great basic cheescake recipe that I think could be used with any number of add-ins (chocolate chips, strawberries, etc.). This is definitely a keeper!

I saw this recipe in Bon Appetit and knew that I had to make it for Christmas dessert (it was a good way to use leftover cranberries from Thanksgiving). Everyone raved about it -- saying that it would be worth $20-$30 if bought from a bakery. One thing, though, is that it took longer to cook than the recipe indicated -- about 65 - 70 minutes. Also, if you're concerned about the crust sticking, line the bottom with greased parchment.

Wonderful cheesecake -- our family fought over the last piece. I, too, used crushed Oreo crumbs and had good results. The cheesecake isn't too heavy and the orange zest adds great flavor.

Excellent cheesecake, even without the cranberry topping (I ran out of time before the party!). I added extra orange zest, so it had plenty of flavor even without the cranberries. Also, instead of using chocolate wafer cookies, I buy the box of pre-crushed oreo crumbs (in the baking section near the pre-crushed graham cracker crumbs)--it's cheaper than the wafer cookies and more convenient if they're already crushed for you. This recipe is a keeper!

This was the first cheesecake I've made that didn't crack! I was so excited, I hated to top it... but the topping was wonderful. I made this for a Christmas celebration for my husband's family. They loved it! The orange flavor is subtle, the texture wonderful, the topping tart, but still sweet. I made orange curls with the v-shaped part of my zester, then wound them around the handle of a wooden spoon until they were tight, then laid them on the berry topping and stuck the ends into the berries so it stayed in place. Instead of mint, I garnished with some fir cuttings from my tree (washed of course) for a holiday look. This recipe will definately become part of my holiday 'classics' along with the Cranberry-walnut Pear torte also found on this website.

My family thought this was the best cheese cake they had ever had. The texture is very light and therefore it works well for dessert after a company dinner. To make the recipe even easier, I used Trader Joes Fresh Cranberry Orange Relish for the topping and it was a real hit!

My boyfriend made this wonderful cheesecake for my dinner group's Christmas gathering. The votes are in: 9.5 out of 10! It looked just like the photo, clear down to the fresh mint sprigs found in my garden in Buffalo, NY in December! The smooth texture of the cheesecake, combined with the mildly chocolatey sweetness of the crust, contrast beautifully with the slight tartness of the cranberries. The tool that is used as a zester usually has a v-shaped blade for removing strips of orange peel. If you put the peel in the fridge in plastic wrap for a while, you can twist, turn, curl the orange peel easily and it stays put on top of the cranberries.

This beautiful cheesecake was a big hit in the neighborhood. The orange flavor of the cheesecake combined with the cranberry topping was outstanding. The chocolate crust was a nice twist, although it stuck to the bottom of the pan more than I would have liked. If you love cranberries like I do, you won't be disappointed. Except . . . I couldn't make orange curls for anything. Guess I need to research that a little; wish recipe had included instructions.
