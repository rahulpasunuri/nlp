The thick consistency of this soup is not the problem for me, as I was looking for a hearty winter soup recipe. I used organic ingredients and the flavor was still very odd. My dinner guest disliked it and I will not make it again.

Excellent soup, subtle flavors, easy to make. The thyme and green onion really make it. Thick and luxurious, great on a rainy wintery day.

Don't know why the reviews are so extreme. It's a very simple and basic soup. I used a sweet onion and sauteed the garlic and bay leaf a bit before adding the rest of the ingredients. The russets I used were small - maybe sweeter. I didn't even bother with the thyme or green onions. I added a touch of cream but, it was wonderful on it's own.

I added a few extra cloves of garlic and some extra onion, yet still very bland. I wouldn't make this again. Gross Gross Gross

Very good, easy, delicious and adaptable. I used Yukon Golds instead of russets (was what I had on hand), extra garlic, and threw in a sprig of thyme while simmering. It pureed into a velvety soup. I didn't think it needed the fresh herbs. I found the green onions I had available a little too overpowering.

Giant Yuck! I followed the recipe exactly and found that the soup came out way too thick. Instead of soup, it came out the texture of mushy mashed potatos.

Excellent restorative soup. It tasted like a "cream of" soup, but without the cream. I added a splash of white wine vinegar and doubled the garlic.

Well,I didn't follow it exactly. I had to use 2 very ripe roma tomatoes,which I seeded,chopped,and added to the almost-ready onions,cooking for another few minutes.Added dried thyme with the vegetable broth,instead of at the end,along with a good pinch of saffron. It was superb.

This was not the soup I imagined when I set out to make it - the potatoes smothered most of the flavor of the chives and thyme, which is an amazing feat for the amount included. I found the soup to be way too bland. Skip any fix ups and find a different recipe!

Nice subtle flavor. I doubled the garlic, but opps forgot the scallions. We all still enjoyed this dish. I thought a sprinkle of dried ground chipotle pepper and a dollop of sour cream might be a nice variation. I will certainly make again.

I liked this recipe, I always have the ingredients on hand. Might be too bland for adults but perfect for kids. I did increase the amount of garlic. Definitely needed to be seasoned with salt and pepper.

I followed the recipe, but I found the resulting soup bland and boring for my taste. It definitely needed salt added to make it palatable.

I make this one frequently, especially during the winter. I swear, it cures colds and flu! Definitely don't be afraid to increase the amount of garlic. It becomes very mild and delicate with cooking. And the flavor is actually better the next day!

I made it just as the recipe said. It was a bit bland for my husband and I, but my 2-year-old daughter loved it. It wasn't bad, but I don't think we'll be making it again.

Terrific! Didn't have to substitute a thing! I blended it for only 10 seconds instead of 20 so it had a little more texture. It came out creamy and the garlic didn't take over the whole meal. We all went back for second helpings!

Delicious and easy, altho my husband ate it as mashed potatoes -- prob because I under-pureed the soup -- altho still yummy.

Fairly delicious soup. It gets better as it sits and the flavors commingle. Everyone emptied their bowls.

This recipie called for no salt which made it very bland but it was the first soup I ever made and I would definatley do it again. I added some dill...alot of dill.

This comes together quickly. I actuaaly heard gasp when my family tried it. It was awesome. The best soup I have EVER had!

The flavor of this soup is not to be believed. I added a little more garlic than the recipe called for, and the broth before pureeing was so delicious that I considered leaving it that way. I have only one complaint, and it is a small one. I really like texture, and this soup doesn't really have much (especially since I forgot to buy the green onions). When I make it again, I will only puree for an instant so that some chunks are left of the potatoes. Otherwise, this is an amazing soup which pleased my picky man!

This was a delicious, easy, low fat recipe that my family loved. Perfect dish for a cold winter night. I found that processing the potato mixture 20 seconds was far too long. About 5 seconds was just right, leaving pea sized lumps of potatoes.

I love it. I have given the recipe to lots of people. I usually double the amount of garlic and take care not to use starchy potatoes or it can go a bit too much like wallpaper paste (my husbands description - not mine! )

Wonderful. Added a little sour cream to garnish.

Great recipe! Definitely a comfort food on those sniffly, San Francisco foggy days! Boyfriend loved it and begged to take the leftovers to work the next day.

When vegetable broth is used this recipe makes a wonderful vegan potato soup.
