Wonderful, impressive dessert! Make it all ahead so even if it does take some time to make the profiterols, it is definitely worth it.

Powdery, flat cocoa taste, didn't puff up nearly enough.

This is one of those classic Gourmet magazine recipes!! (I think it was featured on the cover in '93 ?) It has versatility potential too!! Yummy!!

I was expecting more of a cream puff - these are more like cookies.

This is a wonderful recipe, and even though I do not have a sweet tooth, nor a fondness for making dessert, it is one of my favorites. I did take a shortcut, and use Hershey's ready-made chocolate syrup rather making it myself. So far, no complaints! That way makes it easy to decorate the plate, too.

This has been a favorite of ours since we first made it in 1993 - a great twist on the "old cream puff"! We have a friend who makes wonderful coffee ice cream, but we usually settle for a good store bought brand.

One of our all-time favorite deserts. The key is the ice cream, which balances the two chocolates. We make more of the profiteroles, and use less of the bittersweet chocolate. Enjoy.

If you use elbow grease and a metal spoon, you can easily beat the eggs in (one at a time)instead of the mixer program. Not a Kahlua fan, I use a chocolate sauce made from slowly heating 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips, 1/4 cup butter and 2T corn syrup, stirred constantly.

This recipe is delicious and worth the extra effort. While it requires a fair amount of time to prepare the recipe is straightforward and not as difficult as it might look.

I have always been very impressed with Gourmet's chocolate desserts. I enjoyed the different textures in the dessert - but the profiterole itself almost tasted bitter. I would only eat this dessert assembled as directed (it was magnificent). But alone, all three components could be tastier
