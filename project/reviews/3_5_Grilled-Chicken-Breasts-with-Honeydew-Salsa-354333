I used watermelon instead of honeydew, a mixture of cilantro, mint and basil and lots of lime. A great side for just about anything; chicken, black beans and yellow corn, tortilla chips, a taco salad. Perfect for those who don't like tomato salsa.

This salsa was awesome! Darkknightdad was right... the more lime the better! One and all LOVED it! I also doubled the batch later and used as a summer salad and a salsa with corn chips. Wonderful!

I thought the salsa was marginal. There are better salsas out there.

This was a great success! I agree with another review, be heavy handed with the lime and the flavors will pop!

This was good, not great. Fun for summer BBQ's, but the salsa didn't 'wow' anybody, although everyone liked it. Probably won't make again.

I used butterflied skinless, boneless chicken breasts, and that worked just as well. Delicious!

Wow this was so good and so easy to make....perfect recipe as is....even my 9 year old loved the salsa! Took the advice of another review and grilled some sour dough bread w olive oil then and added a touch of fresh parmesan cheese -- great combo. will definately make again.

I received some honeydew from my CSA and my SIL found this recipe so I decided to try it. I wasn't that excited about because I thought it wouldn't have flavor. I was very wrong. It was delicious and reminded me of a dish that I'd get at a higher end TexMex place here in Austin. I did alter the recipe a little bit, though. I marinated skinless chicken breasts in lime juice, canola oil, some cumin, a touch of chipotle power, salt and pepper. It marinated for about 30 minutes. I also topped the chicken with some cotjia cheese and served it over white basmati rice. So good!!

This was pretty good. The onions kind of overpowered the salsa. I made as instructed. I would make again if I needed to use up a melon, but otherwise, probably not.

I love this recipe. For a deviation, I used mango instead of melon and fresh anise from the garden, which ROCKED!

This recipe was fairly good. For me I thought grilling the onions makes it better. Also, adding a little bit of sour cream. But, all in all, good.

This was excellent! Quick, fresh, light, and if you use a heavy hand with the lime juice & lime zest, zingy. I doubled the salsa, which gave us a higher salsa/chicken ratio, which we all loved. I served it with a few slices of bread, that I brushed lightly with olive oil and grilled, which added a nice crunchy, smoky flavor.

I absolutely loved this. It's a really easy recipe and so delicious. It's something different, and really fresh as well.

Pretty good - simple. Best with super fresh, farmer's market quality ingredients, or would be boring. takes literally like ten minutes to prepare. Would recommend adding LOTS of the lime.

This was delicious. I had an avocado and added that to the salsa. I'll definitely make this again.

Very tasty, no brainer recipe. I didn't have chile, so I used crushed red pepper and we still loved it.

Healthy and delicious recipe. Not to mention, super fast! served w/brown rice.

This was a very simple dish to prepare. I enjoyed the balance of sweet (honeydew) with kick of spice (chile), always a winning combination. You could easily substitute honeydew with pineapple, or nectarines.

This was easy and delicious. I did not have cilantro, so I used some fresh basil and mint from my garden. I think the mint really made it special.

So the only "hot" pepper that the grocery store had was a jalopeno. A serrano would have definitely added the needed zip but I think a habenero would have been a perfect amount of heat and a pretty color contrast. Nice refreshing summer dish, will make again with the change of pepper...

This dish was yummy! Used a different variety melon than the honeydew, but the salsa was outstanding. Served over jasmine rice.
