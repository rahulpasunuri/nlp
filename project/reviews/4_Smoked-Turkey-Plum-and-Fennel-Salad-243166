We thought this was a delicious and interesting flavor combination. With the exception of the turkey, we followed the recipe to the letter. Our local store didn't have a turkey drumstick so we just thinly sliced a smoked turkey breast half. The only quibble is the yield-either we have gigantic appetites or this recipe only serves 2 as a main course.

Excellent picnic fare and great light lunch in general. Used halved red seedless grapes instead of plums with great results. Pulling turkey meat off the bone is not for squeamish but if you are not newly converted from vegetarianism (like myself) it should pose no real threat.

This is a great, healthy, simple summer supper. I couldn't find good smoked turkey so I grilled a turkey kielbasa and loved the combo of the flavors and textures.

I used a chunk of smoked turkey from the deli. Made a great summer picnic.

I don't even like smoked meats usually, but the flavor combinations were fantastic. It was relatively easy to put together too. I followed the recipe exactly and it was a great summer meal.

I don't even like smoked meat usually, but the flavor combination was great. And it was relatively easy to make (if you have a mandoline, otherwise the prep could be tedious). I followed the recipe exactly. It was a great summer meal!
