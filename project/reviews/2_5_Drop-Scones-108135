These were delicious however I needed to add at least 3 more tablespoons of milk and the pan needed to only be medium hot. My first batch burnt because the pan was too hot. With these adjustments the recipe was great and went down a storm in my house.

This recipe was so disappointing! I made it with a Brit friend of mine and it was nothing like what she grew up with. The consistency of the mixture is way too thick, 'very hot pan' scorched my first batch to the point when I had to throw it out. I suggest that you cross check this recipe with other versions you can find. 'It turned out dreadfull!', is what the Brit said.

Thisis a delicious recipe although it needed about 2 tablespoons of milk extra then its perfect - the tea towel system works a treat , they're easy and quick to make , mouth- wateringly delicious to eat and lot more relaxed then normal pancakes. These will definetly become a usual in our house!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Very good recipe, Bit like the ones we used to eat growing up in Scotland (A traditional teatime snack). Bit less sugar and and a wee drop more milk worked great for me. Thanks

This was good. One thing you have to do is press down on them so all of the batter will get cooked. Dont turn the tempature so high, they will burn faster than they will get cooked. If too plain, add chocolate chips or cinnamon. D

I'm so dissapointed about this one. The batter was fairly stiff which didn't match the description from the recipe ("smooth batter"). I tried to thin it with an extra couple of tbs of milk but that didn't do much to make it smooth and I was nervous about changing the quanties more than that. I'm not sure if I had the heat too hot ("Pan needs to be pretty damned hot" is apparently not medium or medium high in a calphalon professional anodized skillet) because the outsides browned extremely rapidly while the insides were raw (probably also because the batter wasn't liquid enough?). The taste was very good and I like that the ingredients are always available, so if someone could clarify the consistency and temperature issue I would try again.
