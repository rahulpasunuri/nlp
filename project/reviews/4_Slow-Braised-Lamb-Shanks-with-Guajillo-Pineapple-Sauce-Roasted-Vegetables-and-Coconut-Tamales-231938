This recipe was good, but not good enough to justify all of the time needed to prepare it. The meat was very tender and juicy, but we felt that the chilies really overpowered the other spices and pineapple flavors. The coconut tamales were really great.

Very good! I was unable to get lamb shanks, so I used oxtails instead. Rather than steaming them, a arranged the oxtails atop the pinapple in a Dutch oven and roasted the oxtails at 300 F for 3 hours until tender). I let the casserole sit in the fridge overnight and skimmed the fat in the morning. Reheated at 350F for 30 minutes. Very good; not too spicy.

I made the entire menu and everyone loved it. If you love braised food and want to try something new, this is it.

This dish was amazing. The lamb was tender and succlent, and the sauce was complex and layered with flavor. Based on my braising experience, I like to brown anything this is going ot be braised to prevent grayness, so I quickly browned the shanks before wrapping them, and that added yet another layer of flavor to this dish. I'm looking forward to making this after Passover so we can have the coconut tamales as well.
