Abosulutely fantastic. I made the recipe almost as written and it was worth every minute. I had about 1 3/4 pounds of chicken wings and cut them at the joints before browning. I used low-sodium chicken broth and simmered (while we golfed) for about 5-6 hours on very low. The stock MAKES the sauce. They only ambiguity to the recipe is how much of the stock to use in the sauce. I just kept pouring more in as the sauce kept thickening. I served this with mashed potatoes and steamed asparagus. Comfort food at it's best and I have some home made stock leftover.

I enjoyed this dish, but I [ahem] kicked it up a notch. Here's how: Stock: I used 4 cups of broth and 2 cups of dry white wine. I simmered for 3 hours instead of 1-1/2, but it could have easily stayed on the burner for 5 or 6 hours to extract maximum flavor. (Note: the CIA's Professional Chef has a better poultry stock recipe.) Sauce: I used 2 tablespoons each of thyme and sage, rather than the 2 teaspoons called for. I also used 1/2 cup of cream sherry in place of the 1/4 cup of Madeira. Cooking: Instead of oven roasting, I used the Weber grill. I browned the chicken peices over a direct fire, then moved them to an area of the grill without coals. Because my wife grew sage as big as a bush this year, I then put two large bundles of sage on the coals, closed the lid, and let the chicken smoke/roast for 20 minutes.

People please. This is just simple comfort food. If you can't execute simple rudimentary cooking skills, go to McDonald's and leave communal dining to us.

Pretty blah, even with home made stock, which I always use. There are so many great chicken recipes out there - I won't bother re-making any that aren't fantastic.

I am not sure why this got poor ratings, we thought it had a fantastic flavor and I will definitely make it again. I used a high-quality (homemade) stock, perhaps that makes the difference?

I'd actually like to give this a rating of between 2 and 3, but that's not an option. It was good! I hesitated to make it because of some reviews, but it sounded good, and I was looking for a recipe to please both young children and adults. I used vegetable stock I had made earlier in the day instead of the brown chicken stock and a little more sage and thyme because of some of the comments. I thought the flavor was just right.

Don't make this recipe if you value your chicken.

A lot of work for a pedestrian sauce which didn't have enough punch from the Madeira. The sage didn't flavor the chicken very much. Definitely use a non-stick pan when you brown the chicken, or you will lose the skin!

Couldn't find thighs with skin and bones so I just used skinless and boneless and they worked fine. I used breasts with skins and bones, though. Also, added a pinch of flour during the reduction stage to give the sauce more cling. Everyone loved the flavor of the sage. My mom said she wanted to recipie to use for guests.

We really liked this - the flavor was great. Used regular chicken broth which saved the step of making stock. Didn't have madeira so used dry sherry - I'd definelty make this again if was very good!!!

While I have no complaints on the overall taste, I couldn't believe the number of redundant steps to get a very simple flavoring! I would guess if one used basic, high-concentration chicken stock one could get away with skipping the brown-chicken stock preparation. A pain!!
