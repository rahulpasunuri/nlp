I thought this recipe was decent but not great. I didn't realize just how strong the garlic would be (extremely), and for me it overpowered all the other ingredients and made a dish that was very pungent but lacked any complex flavor. That said, I think with a bit of tweaking this could become a nice summer staple. I loved the freshness of the basil & green beans, and I added some quartered grape tomatoes as well which worked out nicely. I think next time I'll try something closer to a regular pesto and cut back on the garlic.

This is a very good dish and something different than the usual side of steamed green beans. I followed recipe as written, and everybody loved it. Great dish to serve with summertime meal. Leftovers are good too! Will defintely make again.

Definitely not a mild dish. Garlicky and spicy, but decent.

Addendum...also used fresh baby green beans from TJ's with this recipe, which definitely added to the yummyness...

Rubbed garlic on the cooked beens and mixed with Trader Joe's prepared pesto for a wonderful, very quick, less garlicky version. Would be excellent/elegant enough for for a dinner party.

Great recipe. I made it for a family gathering and it was the first dish to disappear. Garlic lovers will adore it. For a faster version use prepared pesto. It is a great make ahead recipe. It is also a very beautiful dish.

Used fresh, locally grown green and yellow beans in equal amounts. Substituting Vidalias for the red onions didn't hurt it a bit. Very garlicky. Just as good the next day when brought to room temperature.

Really nice, summery flavor. Use Vidalia onions for a milder result.
