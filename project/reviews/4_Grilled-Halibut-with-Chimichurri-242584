Really delicious!

Made this recipe exactly as specified last night. It was really good. To save even more time in the future, consider whirling the Chimichurri in a food processor. I would also bring the recipe up a notch by putting a little lemon zest in and adding a fresh herb such as cilantro or basil but still keep the flat leaf parsley. I used a Meyer lemon which gave it great depth, oh and a small splash of red wine that made it taste a bit richer.

Very, very good, and quick and simple to boot. Hubby commented that the Chimichurri was the perfect complement for the fish. I grilled some mixed squash from the garden at the same time, and the Chimichurri complemented that as well. Made a Saffron Almond Rice Pilaf to accompany the fish, and was thrilled with the entire meal.

Made this as written except I used Red Snapper because the Halibut was outrageously priced at our local market. The Chimichurri--good God, I could cover just about anything with it and be quite happy. We used a natural charcoal, served with grilled asparagus and steamed baby Yukon Gold potatoes and it was a meal to die for. Very little cleanup, very big impact on our happy tummys. Passed the recipe on to 10 friends already!

I made the chimichurri exactly per instructions ( with very fresh parsley this needs no cilantro). Used fresh cod. Marinated the fish in some chimi for 30 mins, then broiled. Very good results for the effort! The chimi is excellent ( with a kick); we are trying on shrimp and pasta tonight per another reviewer suggestion.

A delicious change of pace for fish! Served it over brown rice. I did not have any shallots and it was still delicious and healthy!

Terrific weeknight dinner. Broiled the fish in the oven, but stuck to the recipe other than that. Super simple and fairly quick, with flavors that really popped. Served on a bed of steamed spinach for a hearty but healthy dinner.

Followed the recipe exactly and was very pleased with the result. However, I will try the cilantro suggestion just to pick it up a little.

Delicious! I used all of these ingredients as inspiration, but I improvised in terms of how I put it all together. After mixing the chimichurri sauce, I marinated the halibut fillets in it for about 20 minutes. Then I drained off the excess marinade and soaked up excess oil from the fish with paper towels. There was still plenty of seasoning and parsley from the chimichurri sauce stuck to the fish. I placed it in a shallow baking dish with a pat of butter beneath the skin side of each fillet, and instead of grilling it, I baked it in a 405 degree oven for about 17 minutes - 14 minutes covered with foil, and the last 3 minutes uncovered. (These were particularly thick fillets - normally it would have probably required less time.) I served it with wild rice and steamed asparagus, and it made a delicious, fresh, and healthy meal!

Delicious! I baked this in the oven at 500 for about 8 minutes.

i made this with orange roughy as they had it fresh and it was wowsie. i think the sauce would be good with just about anything. broiled the fish so it wouldn't fall apart on the grill. will definately try again with most any other type of fish. this would perk up a red snapper really well.

Delicious. I made this with cod fillets, and sauteed them in a grill pan. They only needed to cook around 2 minutes on each side. I didn't measure the ingredients for the chimichurri -- just kind of eyeballed it, and chopped it all in a mini processor. It didn't matter, the end result was delicious. This is a quick, healthy, inexpensive dinner. Definitely a winner.

My guests could not get enough of this dish. I made it according to the recipe except for the parsley, which I replaced half of the quantity with cilantro. Extremely simple and fast if you prepare the chimichurri in advance. I'll definitely make it again.

I would rate this b/w a 3-3.5. This was a tasty, light summery dish. Fish was so super tender. I served it with almond rice pilaf (which soaked up the sauce greatly) and steamed green beans. I did tweak this receipe a bit after reading the reviews: 1. Made the chimichurri the night before and refrigerated it overnight. 2. For the chimichurri, used 2/4 cup parsley and 1/3 cup cilantro. Would have used more cilantro, but my friend doesn't particularly care for it. I did think the chimichurri was a bit lemony (don't know what it's supposed to taste like), but I added some sugar to taste (didn't measure-- maybe several tsps). 3. Marinated the fish for 2 hours in the chimichurri prior to cooking. I used Halibut filets and not steaks. 4.Started to bake fish at 450 but after 3 minutes, increased it to 500 since it was taking a long time for the fish to cook. Total baking time was probably 8 minutes. But definately watch your fish. Nothing's worse than overcooking fish. Enjoy:)

This turned out great! I actually had made several substitutions and made some changes to the cooking time, but it was still delicious. First, I used chipotle chili flakes instead of red pepper flakes. Second, I used cod instead of halibut because it was cheaper (I find halibut too dry anyway). Also, I couldn't fit all the fish onto one pan because we just have small pans. So I split them into two pans, and put one on the top rack, one on the bottom. I didn't have a grill, so I put them in the oven at 500 degrees, according to another fish recipe I found. I'd just put them in the oven for about 5 minutes and was ready to take them out to flip them when I realized that they actually were already cooked. So I just took out the pan from the bottom rack. I flipped over the fish that was on the top rack, then put the pan on the bottom rack, then turned off the oven. I kept the fish there for another few minutes while I got my side salad ready. The fish came out tender, and the pieces flaked off easily. The sauce took longer to make than it did to prepare and cook the fish, but I would definitely make this again. Also, the chimichurri (which I thought was made with cilantro rather than flat-leaf parsley) is great with bread, like an herbed olive oil and garlic infusion. =)

I loved this. I made the chimichurri as written. I can't remember if I baked the fish or pan-cooked it, but it still turned out great.

Was a hit during Christmas dinner. Setting the chimichurri overnight allows the flavors to meld together beautifully. Made a few tweaks along the way... 1) used 1 part parsley and 1 part cilantro 2) added lemon zest 3) blended with blender 4) let sit in fridge overnight 5) used half of the sauce to marinate halibut for 2 hours 6) wiped off marinade and save in a baking dish with baby carrots (placed in oven). 7) washed off rest of marinade and patted dry 8) pan seared halibut with salt and pepper for 2-3 minutes a side and finished in oven (placed a bed of spinich on top of carrots right before you place halibut on top). baked for 5-10 minutes. 9) removes from oven and toss spinish carrots together...served halibut on top and other half of sauce on the side.

I followed a previous reviewer's suggestion to marinate the halibut in orange juice, olive oil and garlic. Also, used cilantro instead of parsley, and a whole shallot (didn't want to waste it). Found the 1/4 cup of lemon to make it too acid for my taste, so I balanced it with a few teaspoons of sugar and maple syrup, until it had just a touch of sweetness. The final product received rave reviews from the family (including my 4-yr-old).

The chimichurri recipe works great with halibut and probably with many other fish. The halibut we was very fresh and I marinated it first in fresh orange juice, olive oil, garlic, and pepper so it was quite moist. The dish was quite tasty and delicious.

I'd give the chimichurri 4 forks, but the fish totally lacked flavor. Maybe it just needed more salt and pepper, but it was very bland. The sauce would've been good on swordfish or cod, as well.

Tasty and light. I used my mini food processor to blend all of the sauce ingredients, and rounded out the meal with a caprese salad. A watermelon and feta salad would be a nice complement too.

This was fantastic! Halibut was tender and flaky. I added another tablespoon of garlic and a handful of arugula. The whole sauce was pureed in the food processor and was amazing.

My family loved the chimichurri over the halibut but they loved it even more tossed with shrimp and pasta. It is an easy and delicious meal!

I love this chimichurri, best recipe for this sauce that I've found so far. I'm surprised by the negative comments about it being too oily. If you use a high-quality oil that tastes good on its own, and you whisk all the ingredients (except the parsley) into a light emulsion (then add the parsley), you should get a thick mixture that does not separate. I serve this with green beans and a starch (brown rice or orzo) and put the chimichurri over everthing. I've served it with beef and chicken too. The red pepper flakes give it a nice unexpected kick.

The Chimichurri was exceptional! I threw everything in the food processor instead of chopping and it turned out great! I also served with Sea Bass. I will definitely make this again!!

I thought the sauce was too oily as well. Not sure I loved the flavors either but it might make a good marinade for chicken, etc..

The supermarket didn't have halibut, so we made this with seabass. Very quick and easy. The chimichurri was very good. The parsley lent a very fresh taste. You have to love garlic. I think this would be good over some grilled sea scallops.

The sauce was flavorful, bright, and easy to prepare. Substituted Pacific Cod for Halibut. Will serve the sauce again over grilled fish.

The fresh lemon and herb flavors of the chimichurri are an excellent understated addition to the delicious falvor of fresh Alaskan halibut.
