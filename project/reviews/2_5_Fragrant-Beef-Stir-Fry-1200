I agree w/ the previous postings - definitely needs a lot of garlic and ginger.

To be fair, the ginger, garlic & sesame are in the oil that is recommended for the stir fry.

The ingredients not mentioned in this recipe are ingredients in the commercilly purchased stir fry oil........

I didn't even make it but by looking at the description and the list of ingredients would say some ingredients are missing. It mentions garlic, ginger and sesame in the description, but none of these things are listed in the ingredients list -- perhaps someone should recheck the recipe.

I made the recipe making several changes. It was pretty good! Then I realized that by making all of the changes, I really didn't make the recipe. I made the changes because there just didn't seem like there was enough oomph to it. I kept tasting & changing & adding. Nah! There are better recipes out there.

I have been cooking from this website for just under 2 years now, and I have ran into very few recipes that I've placed directly into the garbage after use. This is one of them. It was just so bland. In retrospect, I look at the boring ingredients that went into the so-called 'fragrant' sauce and I suppose my disappointment isn't much of a surprise. I might make this again, but only after adding my own spin to things. Life is too short for boring food...

This wasn't bad, I made a few changes, but it helped me as far as a base. I used fresh orange peel and juice instead of the lemon, and I added chopped garlic, fresh ginger and scallions instead of onions. Also used orange bell pepper, water chestnuts and cherry tomatoes, basically what I had in the fridge. I also omitted the cilantro since I didn't have any and added some hot red pepper flakes for spice. Served with white rice and my son ate it!

Great simple stir fry recipe. We have made it several items.
