The dish was unique in its presentation - so beautiful! However, like others I was underwhelmed by the sauce - fairly pedestrian and similar to an Indian raita. We did not have a deep fryer, but used a deep layer of oil (~2 inches) in a heavy pan, and it worked fine. I'd made it again, but use a sauce that can stand up (and change the curry in the flour to match the sauce)

This was a really great presentation, but the dish itself was just so-so. I wouldn't make it again, and we didn't care for the sauce at all.

Excellent presentation and idea. Many variations are possible using the same basic recipe. We used this for an app for Christmas and our guests loved it. We cheated by using purchased shredded filo and served the scallops with a chile aioli. We also used this recipe with mushrooms stuffed with gorgonzola coated and wrapped with the filo for our non-seafood loving friends.

I first tried this as an appetizer for Thanksgiving then for a special dinner party and some one told me they never had scallops but loved this. Having a deep fryer helps. I'll be taking this to a Christmas party too!!

This is a recipe designed to impress. It's much easier to make if you have a small deep frier since the dough has room to spread out. Your guests will surely be amazed and want the recipe. Other sauces (check the scallop recipes here) also work well.

I couldn't give this four forks because I have not tasted this dish myself, but the people I was serving it to absolutely loved it and raved about it all evening.
