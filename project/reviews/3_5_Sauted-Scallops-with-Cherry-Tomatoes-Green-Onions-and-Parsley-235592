The family gave this a thumbs down. The tomatoes and lemon together were too acidic. Something seemed to be missing or maybe the flavors didn't blend well. I used garden cherry tomatoes and green onions. This one won't be a repeat.

This dish was delicious and full of flavor. We also added shrimp to the dish. Yum! Served over rice and will definitely make again.

I also had the tomatoes not bursting issue. It was a bit bland but I think that's because I cut the recipe down for one so the amount of paprika was next to nothing.

Made this last evening over orzo -- quick, easy & tasty. Used grape tomatoes & only one actually burst open. Next time will saute the tomatoes after the scallops and throw in the green onion before the parsley. Cooking the onions before the tomatoes caused them to become mushy.

Very quick and easy to make. Absolutely delicious, especially since local tomatoes are in season and have so much flavour. I would cook scallops on high next time (not medium high) because there was too much liquid. Other than that, really enjoyed recipe. Try putting some Italian cheese on top.

I would prefer to give this a 3.5, but liked it more than just a 3. I made the sauce as directed, but mashed the cherry tomatoes a bit with a potato masher as they weren't really spliting open. I reduced scallops to 1 lb and had ample sauce for that amount. I loved the smokey sweet tast of the paprika and paired it with a lovely riesling which really complimented the scallops. My husband (who doesn't like to venture far from steak and potatoes) loved it.

Made this with the explosion of grape tomatoes from my garden. Nice combination, but I would recommend being generous with the white wine, lemon and olive oil to have enough to pour over the rice, pasta, etc.

Great way to use the abundance of cherry tomatoes in the summer garden. I used frozen Trader Joe's scallops, and after reading reviews used less lemon juice and added white wine to deglaze the pan, and a bit more for a light sauce. I cooked linguini, then added to the pan, and was a huge hit with family.

I have actually never made this with scallops, but I love making it with chicken. The combination of green onions, tomatoes, lemon juice, and paprika is great. I like to make it and put it on baguettes for a sandwich.

We enjoyed this recipe so much that when I discovered I'd misplaced it I searched the web for an hour. I added a little sherry and served with yellow curried rice. Delighful!! Making it tonight..

One of my favorite recipes, and so simple. I sprinkle Paul Prudhommes Blackened Redfish Magic on the scallops when sauting and omit the Paprika for a bit of a kick.

Thanks for the suggestion to deglaze pan; used Costco scallops (huge!) and local tomatos with hot paprika; served very simply with green salad tossed with white balsamic and EVOO and some artisanal focaccio bread that I toasted to sop up the lovely juices from the tomatos. Will surely make again!

I took a chance on this recipe because of the mixed reviews. My family loved this. I used Penzey's Hungarian sweet paprika and dry scallops. At the end, I added cooked linguine and tossed it in the pan with the scallops and tomatoes. It was so easy and looked beautiful!

A flavoral and simple dish that my family thoroughly enjoyed. The only change I made was to deglaze the skillet with some white wine BEFORE putting in the tomatoes.

The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly but I made it two ways--one with scallops and one with haddock cut into pieces. It was easy and yummy. We liked the scallop version, but the haddock variation was fabulous. All of our guests love it (both ways) and each have since made a variation of the recipe (e.g. with basil instead of parsley). Since that dinner party I have made the haddock version two more times, both times I added a little veggie broth. Yummy!

I'm sorry to disagree with other reviews, but this was a big flop with my family...even my easy to please teenager with gourmet tastes. I followed the instructions completely and used dry pack scallops and farm picked cherry tomatoes to no avail. The paprika/lemon dominates and there is no complexity to overall taste. A waste of otherwise great ingredients.

We have spent the summer in France and one night we had our neighbors over for dinner. They appreciate good food, it was hot and we were looking though our magazines for a recipe that was easy to make, but full of flavor. Our neighbors loved the meal and after asked for the recipe.

Horrible! Very bitter. Waste of good scallops. Would not make again!

Perhaps it was the salt, cherry tomatoes and the paprika, but it all overpowered the taste of the scallops. What a waste of perfectly wonderful scallops!

I've made this four times in the last six weeks. With frozen wild scallops from Trader Joe's and cherry tomatoes from the back yard, it's one of those quick but delicious meals you can throw together at the last minute. I double the sweet paprika and even add a teaspoon of dried red pepper flakes. I might also try stirring in a bit of heavy cream the next time. Wonderful!

I'd give this 3.5 forks if I could. I used meyer lemon juice and added some chopped heirloom tomatoes with the cherry tomatoes. The chopped tomatoes sort of "melted" and made a wonderful sauce. We were sopping up the sauce from the pan with bread and almost liked it better than the scallops! We loved it and will certainly be making this frequently - quick, attractive and very tasty.

This was a tasty dish but I'd definately omit the lemon juice all together next time. The lemon juice makes it much too sour. I added 2 tbsps. of white wine and 1 tbsp. of lemon juice and found that the lemon still overpowered the other flavors so I added chicken broth and a splash of heavy cream to dull out the lemon and it came out yummy!

This dish satisfied taste and sight. It was great. I will definitely make again.

The first time I made this it was just a little too sour for us, but by substituting white wine for the lemon juice it was perfect.

Not only delicious, but beautiful as well, especially when prepared with both red and gold cherry tomatoes. Even the non-scallop lover in the family enjoyed it. A perfect taste of summer!
