I make a much larger batch because this recipe doesn't serve 10. It is now a standard side for all of my holiday meals. There are never any leftovers. It vanishes quickly! I love this recipe!

Very tasty. I tried it with grana padano. It's what I had. Also good.

Very tasty dish with a lot of flavor. I roasted it in a ceramic serving dish so it looked very nice when brought to the table. Anything with browned bread crumbs and cheese on top looks good! It would not look so good if you tried to move it from a baking dish to a serving dish because it is not and would fall apart. The taste complimented lamb and heavily spiced pilaf. Two comments: 1) 5 fennel bulbs is way too much, especially with only one onion. I ended up using about 3 bulbs with one onion and it served 8 well as a side. 2) I agree that the cooked fennel looks gray and dreary. That's another reason to bake it in the serving dish.

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was excellent. I followed the recipe exactly and it was both attractive and tasty, not sure why other people were cooking the fennel more. I would probably add less salt to the fennel next time though, between the cheese in the topping, the coarse salt and the chicken broth it was a bit too salty.

Fennel is really quite an interesting vegetable and this is such a lovely provincial Italian type of dish. Made as a side to Anchovy and Rosemary Roasted Lamb, with some buttery potatoes. And the leftovers are totally delicious too.

I followed a previous review and added white wine and extra broth to the fennel. I definitely cooked it too long and the fennel looked like dirty dish water. Once out of the oven though, it was delicious. The lemon pecorino combo is tantalizing for the pallet and baking the fennel really mellowed the flavor. This complimented Thanksgiving well, it just didn't present well. I've used the panko/lemon zest/pecorino topping on potatoes and to bread chicken and it has become a staple in my kitchen now.

This was the hit new side dish at Thanksgiving. The tangyness cut through all the sweetness of turkey and stuffing and gravy. It is also pretty good reheated the next day. Followed the recipe as written, with a smidge more pecorino. Perfect.

Made this for a pot-luck dinner party. Everyone seemed to enjoy it, but I found the texture of the panko a little off-putting. Next time I might try using regular breadcrumbs instead.

I made this with some modifications, cooked the fennel longer with more broth and equal amount of white wine, added some lemon juice and a dash of sugar. It came out incredibly good. My husband liked it and doesn't normally eat fennel.

I thought this was delicious! I made the fennel mix a day ahead of time and let it sit overnight. Took out of fridge to come to room temp while I made the topping. The flavors were great. And yes, cheese (which doesn't melt so it adds a wonderful saltiness), lemon, fennel and the herbs are a wonderful combination. Will definitely make again!

Its a lovely dish and not at all complicated, but somehow lacked some pizzazz. Perhaps it was because the receipt appeared in the Thanksgiving section, or maybe it's the exorbitant price of fennel from the Publix/Kroger/WholeFoods/Grocer Whatever, I guess I just expected more flavor.

Making this today for a brunch tomorrow. I have been making a similar but simpler version for years and this is just that much nicer for company. I usually poach the fennel in chicken broth, dot with butter, sprinkle with parmesan or romano and put it under the broiler to brown. The kids love it too.

I wanted to try this recipe before Thanksgiving to see if it was worthy making for a crowd, I thought it was a tad bland but brought it to a pot luck and everyone asked for the recipe. Having made it 2 days before and reheating brought out much more flavor.

WHOA Nellie! I recently had this recipe (at an Italian Canadian Thanksgiving) but made with cambazola cheese. Out of this world - we were all going for 2nds on this dish. An interesting twist and as we like to tell our kids "try it first before you make a decision." I have been trying to locate this recipe and have been experimenting on my own. I found it an unusual marriage of flavours that brought many compliments that day. Another way of preparing the fennel is to steam it before adding to the final steps.

Sounds marvelous ! I believe the SIMPLEST and FINEST ingredients return the MOST delightful recipes...going to try this, and perhaps add a [few] capers...that sounds DELICIOUS to me; any thought .?
