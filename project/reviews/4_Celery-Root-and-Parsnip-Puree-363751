This is a great recipe. Even my 11 year old loved this and asked for more. Celery root is also called celeriac. Great with grilled elk.

omg this was creamy soft and silky - speck of honey/thyme/butter was brilliant. Because I have a sweeth tooth, i also drizzled honey over the top. Parsnip is sweet and smooth. I loved this.

This recipe was SO easy and really delicious. We didn't have the inclination to use the ricer, so we just mashed it. We also didn't have half-and-half, so we used some milk, sour cream, and the pink peppercorn butter. We will definitely make this again!
