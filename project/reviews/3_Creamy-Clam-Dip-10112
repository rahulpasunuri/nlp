On it's own, this is a flavorless, bland dip. I had to add so much seasoning to make it tasty that it was no longer the original recipe.

This is great, but insteading of adding horseradish, I add cocktail sauce on the top of the dip. It has the needed horseradish, plus a little extra flavor, and it looks great!

This is a good basic recipe. With some tweaks it took it up to 4 forks. I added a little horseradish, lemon juice and crumbled crisp bacon to this recipe. It turned out lovely. My Dutch in-laws loved it and the bowl was quickly empty. I served this with crackers as that is how they prefer. Everyone thought it was delish and I will definitely make this again.

Soooooooo good. Use Snow's chopped clams, not minced, and Ruffles chips. yum.

Dips like this can always benefit from a little lemon juice, especially seafood of any kind. It makes a dip snap with flavor. In cream cheese and sour cream combos I also add a tiny bit of chipotle pepper sauce...or finely chopped chipotle peppers in adobo.

I added a little horseradish for extra kick and very much enjoyed this dip.

This is a fine clam dip; I don't know what others have been so unenthusiastic about. I used a minced garlic clove, since I didn't have shallots, and a couple of slices of bacon, fried crisp and crumbled.

Hey Sacramento. I am From Sacramento too. Adding horseradish is a must. It adds the zing to the dip.

This was a very good clam dip. I added the tobasco as suggested and the Old Bay seasoning. It gave it just the right kick! My husband thought the red bell pepper was a little too much so I might cut that in half next time and I think cilantro instead of the parsley would be better. I would absolutely make this again.

Like everyone else, I had to tinker with the recipe; it is a little bland as written. Omitted the bell pepper, added more Worcestershire, and gave it a shot of tabasco instead of cayenne. It definitely improves with age so make it ahead of time!

This is very easy to make and has a great texture. However, to make it tasty and memorable you do have to adjust the seasoning a bit. I increased the seasoning, added some lemon juice and a dash of Old Bay. This made it very tasty!

This dip was tasty but not worth a repeat. Nice creamy texture. Not enough pizzazz.

I've made this several times & always had rave reviews. However, make it the day before to give it a chance to blend the flavors, otherwise the taste just isn't the same.

I made this dish for a family gathering and everyone loved it. I also made it again with chopped clams instead of minced and it seemed to add more texture and a little more flavor. This is one recipe I will use when unexpected company shows up b/c it's so quick and delicious.

I made a few changes to the original recipe. Replaced the red bell pepper with roasted yellow pepper, carmelized the shallots & added 1 T. lemon fresh lemon juice. Also let flavors blend in fridge for 2 hrs. My friends liked it & asked for the recipe.

The clam dip was tastier when we put it in a covered bowl and refrigerated it overnight. The flavors all came together.

Wouldn't make this dish again. Was not lacking in spice but flavour was just . . simply bland. May have potential with a few variations. I did add red onion to give it a bit more zip, helped . . . but not enough.

I made this recipe for the Superbowl party & it was okay. A lot of it was still left & friends also agreed that it was okay not great.

This is actually just like my own recipe for clam dip but with red pepper. Add a teaspoon or two of fresh lemon juice and it's absolutely divine. If it's your first time, you'd better double it for a party because it goes fast every time!

Wow! Tried it once and now I can't have a party without it. My family asks me to bring it to every function.
