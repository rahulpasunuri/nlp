I thought these were good - I would make them again. But I also agree with others - the batter needs something. I used three tbsp olive oil and 3 tbsp butter for the sauce and it was still very good. Next time I will add some parsley or use seasoned bread crumbs.

Heard the basic recipe was less than eventful so I followed the recommendation to add sautéed onions and extra parm. to the batter (also added a handful of fresh basil to the batter) and less breadcrumbs. Instead of dropping the dumplings into water I steamed them (place the batter on little squares of parchment paper so they don't stick to the steamer). The mushrooms were sautéed in less oil and just a tablespoon of butter (add about 1/3 cup sautéed onions to the mushrooms. Very tasty meal.

Surprisingly disappointing -- my husband and I would agree with the evaluation below. The dumplings looked oddly pale and had a "mushy" consistency. I would recommend trying to bulk up the dumplings with other ingredients, which would perhaps lend a little flavor as well.

Don't understand the hype on this one. The dumplings had NO flavor and a strange consistency. The mushroom sauce was tasty but very high in fat, so no wonder. Husband and I decided it was not a keeper!!

To enrich this delicate side dish, add one more egg yolk, lots of steamed and sqeezed dry spinach and sauted onions directly to the batter and more parmesan---absolutely cut the butter....less bread crumbs--it's easy to tell when the batter will make firm but soft spoonfuls. I then leave the musrooms out of the sauce. They become a totally different delicious treat...even good with a nice marinara sauce as substiture.

Delicious! I made a few substitutions, though, through choice or necessity: I used sherry instead of vermouth and cheddar instead of Parmesan. I also left out the butter, as the fat content appeared awfully high. The sauce could, perhaps, do with a little thickening. I'm planning to experiment with different sauces, or with boiling the dumplings in stock instead of plain water.

I thought these were delicious, even with half the butter. I added all kinds of herbs to keep them from being bland. My boyfriend still thought they were bland, though, so they are probably not for everyone.

these had potential but something wasn't right..the sauce was great (how could it not be with almost a whole stick of butter?!), but the dumplings came out grainy, somewhat dense & a little bland. I would try them again & reduce the amount of breadcrumbs, add some garlic or something to add flavor, and cook them all at once instead of dropping them one by one as suggested; since it's a little difficult to round them out nicely, by the time you get to the end the first ones have already cooked for several minutes, then it says to cover & cook 3 mins...so they're not all cooked evenly.

Wonderful and elegant recipe. I didn't bother to separate eggs and I used seasoned (store bought) bread crumbs. I chilled the dumpling mixture after mixing everything in the Cuisinart. It all worked out. The dumplings held their shape and boiled easily and that mushroom sauce was excellent. I'm sure you could cut the butter in half and use part or all olive oil. I heard only sounds of delight for the first fifteen minutes of my dinner party! Everyone loved them.
