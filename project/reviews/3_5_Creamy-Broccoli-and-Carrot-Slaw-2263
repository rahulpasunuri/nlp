Easy and quick. Okay without additions, but better with broccoli flowerettes or nuts for crunch. I erred by adding the juice from the grated onion and it was too strong. I did add a bit of sweetness to the base recipe, too, as some others reported.

Good base recipe, but needs a kick. As other reviewers suggested, I would add dried fruit, sunflower seeds or nuts and maybe bacon. All I had on hand were hulled pumpkin seeds. I also subbed yogurt for the mayo, only because I didn't have mayo. I'd probably do part yogurt, part mayo next time. Also used red onion, as well as florets and stems.

This was pretty good, but was missing a little something. It became excellent when I added maple syrup and salt to taste, to flavor the dressing. And added dried cherries and toasted almonds to the slaw. Now it's pretty amazingly good. I will continue to use the base of this recipe to make that.

I make this every time I have fresh broccoli - it's a great way to stretch the broccoli to two meals. I've added white raisins, almond slices, and cranberries, depending on what I had in the pantry. I've also added the broccoli head (chopped into small bites) when making this for a party or picnic - then you definitely need to double the dressing.

This was o.k. - in fact, it's an interesting way to use those broccoli stems that sometimes end up in the compost pile. However, I prefer coleslaw.

Add sunflower seeds, bacon bits and raisins. Use less mustard and use a slaw mix. Very good and refreshing.

I was so surprised that you could use broccoli stalks instead of cabbage. I grated them with my box grater and they came out great. I changed the recipe though. I used the broccoli stalks, and carrots. However, I added red and yellow peppers, scallions. I made a dressing using lime juice, cilantro, honey and olive oil. It was fantastic. Very healthy. I will never throw away my broccoli stalks again!

I made this with some prepackaged broccoli slaw mix (broccoli stems, carrots, and red cabbage) and for the onion I used red onion. It was good, not great. The flavors in the dressing just didn't come through as much as I would have liked. I'll make it again only because it's so easy. Maybe next time I'll add a pinch of sugar or throw in some lemon zest.

I didn't have quite the same proportion of broccoli to carrots, but followed the dressing proportions. It was GREAT!. Dressing is similar to my normal cabbage cole slaw dressing, but the change to broccoli and carrots instead of cabbage was wonderful.

This coleslaw is simple to make and really delicious. I substituted orange juice for the lemon and used broccoli florets as well as the stems. The grated onion is what really makes the sauce...I will probably add a little more next time. Tasty!

My boyfriend has never been a fan of coleslaw, but I love it. I decided to try this different version, and we both really enjoyed it. The broccoli has a much better taste than cabbage, and the Dijon mustard gives it a nice zing. Now that picnic/barbecue season is just around the corner, we will be making this one often.

Would add some other ingredients to it such as a little horseradish in the dressing to give it more of a tang.

Good substitute for the regular slaw. I made mine with chopped broccoli florets instead of the stems. tasted great!

A nice change from cabbage coleslaw salads!
