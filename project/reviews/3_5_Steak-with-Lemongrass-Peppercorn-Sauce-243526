Good steak dish, not a lemongrass fan but it was an interesting flavor for the meat. Different dish but an OK one.

Make sure you chop the lemongrass VERY finely ... as in powder. In place of vermouth you could use dry white wine or sake. Or, just use brandy. Also, what is that nonsense from 'shellks from wichita'? Your non-review isn't even coherent: "A decent steak doesn't need anything except salt and pepper. A pat of herb butter is all that is needed for a decadent steak."

A decent steak doesn't need anything except salt and pepper. A pat of herb butter is all that is needed for a decadent steak. Check the price of steak with the price of herbs and cream, how it's cooked can make a huge difference! A skirt/flank steak is a better buy. It's a cheaper cut, but cut thin on the bias...oh so tasty!

Any suggestions for alternative to vermouth (other than brandy) as I don't have any? White wine perhaps?

Good recipe. It is simple to make and the taste is very rich. The cream has a taste like coconut milk.
