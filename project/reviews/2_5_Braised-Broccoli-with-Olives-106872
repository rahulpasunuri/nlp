To the Cook from Norcross, GA: if you don't know what a Gaeta olive is, do a search on the web. You will find that it is a substitute for Kalamata olives, and each type has its own marketing group which will tell you that that particular olive is the best. I agree with the previous reviewer who noted to use larger pieces of broccoli. Otherwise, it will become like the frozen broccoli pieces my mother used to boil on high for 45-60 minutes--YUCK. Larger pieces boiled or steamed for only a few minutes then sauteed as also previously stated. Also, unless you are a vampire, double the amount of garlic.

I read the reviews and adjusted the recipe. I prepped my broccoli as regular bite sized pieces. I steamed it. While the broccoli steamed, I sauteed the onion, marjoram (dried, so half the amt), garlic, olive paste in EVOO. When the broccoli was done cooking, I quickly tossed it with the olive "dressing." Squirted a little lemon juice and sprinkled some salt. Very, very tasty.

I thought this was fine. I used pureed green olives and cooked the onion with the broccoli in water and drained it all and then added the other ingredients. The end is just a basic sauteed broccoli and onions.

The overall idea of this recipe is okay but it needs to be worked on a bit. For instance, I wouldn't chop the broccoli that small as it tends to become a puree then. I also have my doubts about the slow braising method. I think it's best to cook the broccoli for about 3 minutes, drain, let cool, and then saute for 3 minutes. Throw in the onion and garlic and then the rest and cook for another 5 minutes. Should be better!

I had high hopes for this recipe but was dissapointed. The dish had unappatizing coloration and the flavoring was poor.

I was really disappointed in this recipe. I looked all over for "Gaeta" olives and ended up using black jumbo olives, because I could not find them, and did not know if they were black or green. Perhaps that is why it had a slightly bitter taste. There were NO seconds required.

This is not a review, it is a message for Irene Sax. Dear Irene, Broccoli sprouts are sprouted broccoli seeds, with just the seed leaves (the true leaves have not yet developed) and the stem. In our local produce departments we can buy many different varieties of sprouts, not just the usual bean sprouts and alfalfa sprouts. Deborah Madison means fresh herbs. Fresh marjoram is common in the produce departments here, even in chain supermarkets. Jill Otto
