This is an excellent recipe. I have put it in my recipe box and have made it since 1994. I pass around fresh parmesan cheese to sprinkle on it. Really tasty. I give it all forks!

This is a staple in my recipe book that I have gone back to year after year, especially when my parents harvest their tomato crop. Fresh tomatoes make the difference, and I don't see the need to add anything else. With lots of fresh basil, homegrown tomatoes, fresh seafood, it's a keeper. I do agree that the sauce really doesn't thicken up, and I usually cook quite a bit longer than the receipe calls for. Love it. My kids love it.

The sauce did not thicken. It does need more flavor...parm helped. You really dont need the scallops.

I did as recipe instructed and even tried to make it more exciting with some green onions, spinach, lemon... for some reason it was very unimpressive. I couldn't get the sauce to thicken and didn't have corn starch. Not making this again.

SO Yummy (doctored up)! Added one large chopped green onion, 4oz thinly sliced baby bella mushrooms, 1/4C white wine (to sauce), crushed red pepper flakes, lemon zest (over seafood), and parmesan cheese over combined pasta. used 1 14oz can diced tomatoes i/o chopped seeded. also added pasta water to sauce at end. next time will add few handfuls of fresh spinach to dish as well.

I agree with other reviewers-- this needed a little something extra. I added white wine, crushed red pepper, a lot of grated fresh parmesan, and at the end, some lemon zest. The lemon really seemed to give the dish that depth that I was looking for.

I agree with previous reviewers; overall this is a good 'starting base' or basic recipe. It benefitted from a little 'doctoring' with additional Fresh Basil, Fresh Oregano and Garlic. I sauteed the additional garlic with the Olive Oil and then sauteed the Scallops and Shrimp in the seasoned oil. Very nice! Don't leave out the clam juice as it gives that additional dimension to the sauce which helps the flavors. Prep your sauce 1 day before, as once this sits the flavors are much more pronounced. Guests all loved it with above revisions!

This was delicious and quite easy to prepare. I made a couple of changes. Like another reviewer, I used canned clams instead of scallops and substituted chicken stock with the clam juice from the canned clams to make the 3/4 cup. Other than that, followed it to a T and it was scrumptious! The leftovers were even better second day!

To add a little more flavor to this recipe, I added butter, white wine, scallions, shelled baby clams and a little bit of tomato sauce.

I, like others, made some changes to the recipe. I used half and half which was plenty creamy. My only complaint was that the sauce needed a little something else. I will make this one again, but next time I'll sautee up a lot more garlic as well as onions before adding in the tomatoe sauce. I also believe this could use some fresh oregano in addition to the basil. A bit of red pepper flakes would also add some flavor. So the net is the sauce has the right consistency, but needs a little more flavor to balance it out.

Easy and delicious - looks like it could be served at a fancy restaurant! I used canned whole tomatoes instead (just cut them up in the can and threw them in). I did add some of the juice from the can to the sauce. I used about 3/4 pound of scallops, 1/2 pound shrimp, and a full pound of penne. I also used half and half instead of cream. This is a fabulous dish and definitely a nice one for company.

Have no review as of yet but will soon. Wanted to thank cook from Renton, WA - I like your changes and will try it "your way" when my son is home from college this weekend. He asked for some pasta with seafood! Thanks

This dish tasted nice, but it took an unexpectedly long time to prepare. I thought that I could whip this up in a half an hour and was wrong. Maybe it was because I doubled the recipe, but I couldn't get the sauce to thicken.

This is an excellent and easy seafood pasta. Other reviewers have suggested reducing the amount of fat and cream, but our experience is that the dish really benefits from heavy cream and the full quantity of olive oil.

This is an easy dish to make. I recommend kicking it up a notch and add some red pepper flake to this dish. I loved the flavors but it seemed to be missing something and that was it.

half and half no heavy cream... crushed red pepper...excellent and easy

I modified this recipe using one lb. of Peruvian scallops (they're like Bay scallops), and 6 oz. of canned chopped clams (didn't have shrimp), which solved the problem of not having clam juice on hand. I used the juice from the canned clams and topped it off with chicken broth until it made 3/4 of a cup. Even though I used a full pound of penne, there was plenty of sauce. This dish is incredible. My daughter was handing out left-over tastes the next day to neighbors and every one raved.

This was very tasty. I spruced it up a bit by using roma tomatoes and adding some oregano and crushed red pepper to the sauce. I had to use pre-cooked shrimp because my grocer screwed up - not worth explaining. Also, I am very glad I used half and half in this recipe instead of heavy cream - it would have been too heavy otherwise. Perhaps one part half and half and one part cream would have worked fine, too, but we try to avoid the saturated fat where we can. :) All in all, a keeper!

I make this all the time. It is so easy and flavorful. I substitute skim milk for the whipping cream to make it less caloric and add corn starch to thicken the sauce. But my mom was visiting once and had to finish preparing this for me and added cream cheese when she realized that I did not have any cream. It was out of this world. YUMMY! Sometimes you just have to splurge.

Excellent recipe! I did not have Penne pasta or clam juice. I used Tortellini for the pasta and substituted chicken boullion for the clam juice. My husband is begging me to make it again!

I had had this recipe in my recipe box for ages, but it wasn't until recently that I decided to give it a try for a small dinner party I was hosting. It was wonderful and very easy to make!

This is an excellent recipe. I agree with the cooks from Akron and Raleigh, the sauce can use a little tweaking. I added roasted red peppers and some pepper flakes. I also used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of whipping cream (too rich for me). I will definitely make this again. Thanks to the reviewers for giving me hints.

This is a WINNER! Took an awful lot of prep time. I'm a bit of a *foodie* so I deveined the shrimp myelf which took about 15-20 minutes and chopped the tomatoes and basil by hand. It was worth it! My finished result was probably not as 'saucy' as it should have been, but there was no way I was going to use a 1/4 c of olive oil. I have too much respect for my thighs! Used 4 tsp instead and 18% table cream instead of whipping cream. My husband loved it ... but, he's a good man and will eat pretty much whatever I put in front of him. One of the reasons I married him! But he definitely loved this.

Delicious! I got rave reviews on this one. Definitely a keeper. Perfect as is, but would also be tasty with mushrooms added. Unfortunately,my family does not share my passion for mushrooms.

I served this dish at a dinner party I had for 14. I had to quadruple the recipe but it was still very easy to prepare. I received complete raves about it and everyone asked me for the recipe. I WILL make this dish again.

I agree with the reviewer from Akron, I think the sauce is somewhat bland and needs something to fill it out. Maybe sun dried tomatoes? But, it's easy and a great base for something that could be spectacular. It'll be fun to tweak this one!

This recipe was a winner in my home! My husband and I are on Weight Watchers and this was a great point value meal. While it supposedly serves 4, we finished the whole thing ourselves! I used only a Tbsp of olive oil vs. a 1/4 cup. I did not use cream, but rather corn starch mixed w/ water as a creamy thickener. I also added a Tbsp of ricotta cheese. I used the frozen, uncooked seafood mix from Trader Joe's. This dish was really yummy and so easy/quick!

very fresh and excellent. even the kids ate it. i substituted larger sea scallops for the bay scallops. if i had read the reviews first i may have been discouraged, but i'd definately make it again and again. it's too easy and delicious.

I made this recipe to the letter, adding the meat of two small lobsters to the scallops and shrimp. For some reason I found it bland and boring- the sauce doesn't cook long enough for any complex flavors to develop nor does it adhere to the penne very well. Perhaps cooking the tomato- basil sauce longer and adding hot sauce would improve it.

Rating: 3
Very fresh, vibrant taste. Surprisingly subtle blend of flavors considering the ingredients! In a hurry, I used Trader Joe's frozen bay scallops & pocorn shrimp, then added a can of whole baby clams. Loved the fact that the sauce wasn't too heavy or creamy. A repeater!

I wanted to use up a lot of leftover bits of seafood from my freezer (a couple of slipper lobster tails, a few scallops, a few shrimp, a tiny tuna steak), and the recipe search turned this up. As I had all the ingredients, I gave it a go. Fabulous. Except for the seafood mix, I didn't/wouldn't change anything. I thought about peeling the tomatoes, but my husband doesn't think it's necessary. One caveat -- watch the sauce as it thickens; it goes from runny to almost gone in a moment. The next day I gave the recipe to my sister, and she called back the following day to rave: "It tastes like restaurant food." How can you lose with these ingredients???

With some minor modifications, this became a dish just to my liking. I used all bay scallops for the seafood component, used white wine instead of clam juice, and, most significantly, substituted julliened sundried tomatoes for fresh ones. I served the sauce with angel hair pasta and a bit of freshly grated parmesan. When tomatoes really hit their season I'll try this again with fresh ones- I'll bet it's just as good in it's way- I just can't tolerate less than perfect tomatoes!

To this wonderful dish i would add mushrooms and mussels. I rate this dish a 10!!!

My husband and I both loved it. A good company dish. I decreased the oil to 2 Tbsp. and next time I will decrease it even more (to 1 or 1 1/2 Tbsp.). I also cooked it 6 min. on med-high after adding only the clam juice then added the cream and cooked it another 6 min. on med-high, stirring frequently. This resulted in a very nice consistency.

Re: last reviewer's comments -- I was worried about how watery it was too, but cooking it longer than the recipe states thickened the sauce. I made this over the holidays for my parents and we all thought this was extremely good. Will make it again for my husband's birthday. I used only shrimp the first time but I'm going to use lobster and shrimp the second. I substituted a large can of chopped tomatoes instead of using fresh and that worked fine. A definite keeper for me.

I was expecting something great based on the reviews. But the sauce was watery. Also, I made it just with shrimp which was probably the best part of the meal. I am sure there are better shrimp pasta dishes out there. Although this was easy -- I do not think I will make it again. A little to bland for my liking.

Excellent Pasta Dish! I used slipper lobster instead of scallops for a nice change of pace and a great dish. While incredibly rich, not using heavy cream destroys this dish. A great pasta for a special dinner or entertaining. A definite keeper!

I made this last night for my husband and I. It was simple to prepare and delicious to eat! I was hoping to have the leftovers tonight but my husband ate some more after work and I had the rest for lunch!! There is a similar dish served at Il Bacio here in Redmond (the owner/chef was the head chef for the Rainier family in Monaco) and this dish tasted just as good.
