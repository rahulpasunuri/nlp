I was looking forward to trying this because I remember our relatives in Sweden bought one for the special occasion of American family visiting. I served this to my family and their teenage friends, and suffice to say, it didn't go over well. It's very dense, and not the flavors that appeal to us. I'm glad I tried it, though, if only to broaden our culinary experience.

I first made this in 1997 and somehow lost the recipie. I am delighted to see it here and can't wait to make it again--it is delicious!

This was delicious and made a beautiful presentation. It also was pretty easy. I halved the recipe, which worked great (I used four slices of bread as the base). I think this would make a great brunch dish.

Made 2 for a graduation party. What was very convenient for me was that I could break up the task. Made the egg salad in the morning, herbed cream cheese and salmon filling in the afternoon. assembled in the evening. Made my life so much easier.Many people asked me for the recipe. Co-workers saw them, asked for left-overs. I Promised to make them one. Presentation is very appetizing,many people asked me for the recipe.

As a shared appetizer for a Summer meal on the patio you can´t go wrong. Flavors blend perfectly. Presentation is beautiful. Quite easy to make.

My husband is Swedish and we long for Smorgastorta during the summer. This recipe is great and the ingredients are easily found. I use three bread layers in a large pyrex dish.

I discovered this recipe about two years ago and have been making it ever since. I only use one row of bread and make three layers, so the whole thing is about the size of a small loaf cake. Instead oc sprinkling herbs, I cover the entire outside with the salmon mixture, then cover that partially on the diagonal with slices of smoked salmon, and garnish with a couple of dill spriggs and some capers in the corner. It looks incredibly chic and people always ask me for the recipe. Definitely cut back on the amount of egg salad and herb cream cheese.

This was an instant hit at our annual Midsummer Party. A crowd pleaser with a distinct taste, which even non-fish lovers enjoyed.

I will make it again because it tasted very good and looked wonderful. Even though there is nothing to bake, the chopping is very time consuming. I feel that the time is worth it for special occasions (not an "everyday" dish).
