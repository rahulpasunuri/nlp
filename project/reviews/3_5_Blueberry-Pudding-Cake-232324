I make this with a non-gluten flour (just check the one available by non-gluten gal). Its far less $$$ than Cup-for-Cup at Williams Sonoma. I use 2 eggs. If you find your blueberry mixture lacking try adding 1or 2 T.s of blueberry preserves to add depth. You might find yourself pleasantly surprised !

I made this dessert expecting to eat it the same evening, but something came up and so we didn't get to eat it until the following night. I had covered it with foil and left it on the counter overnight. The next morning when I peeked at it, the top was really gooey/sticky. I took off the foil, thinking that some air would help it, but it was still really sticky on top when we had it for dessert. But I reheated it and topped it with whipped cream, so it wasn't too noticable. Very buttery taste, but good. The berries were delicious.

Used much less sugar (probably half in berries and cake), 3 T water in frozen berries, much more lemon. Lots of zest in the flour mixture and 1/2 t vanilla. Excellent for such a quick dessert. Served with a bit of whipped cream. Fabulous for the easy prep.

My go-to recipe for quick, stress-free dessert. Last time I made it, substituted 1/2 teaspoon of lemon extract for the vanilla. Delicious!

4 forks for ease to taste ratio. I put this together in about 20 min, following the recipe exactly, and made dinner while it baked. For some reason my berries did not sink. Maybe it was because I melted the butter in the baking dish and used that for my wet ingredients as I tried to save washing another bowl. In any case, so moist and flavorful. A perfect dessert for blueberry season.

Converted to lower fat/lower sugar. Delicious and berries did not sink! Used 1/3 C. sugar, 1/2 cup Splenda & added 1/2 tsp. baking soda to Splenda; used 3 TBS. water, 3 tsp. cornstarch; 12 oz. frozen blueberries; 4 egg whites, 1/2 c buttermilk; 1/4 c butter, 1/4 cup low fat sour cream. I added a generous helping of cinnamon/nutmeg to the batter to add to the flavor. I also used a slotted spoon to spoon berries onto the batter so all the liquid was not used. I think this helped the berries "stay afloat." The trick to cooking w/ Splenda and lower fat is to reduce baking temp. I baked this @ 350 deg. using my speed bake setting on my oven. It took 30 min. I was very pleased w/ the taste and texture. Plus it was a great way to use up the last of my blueberries from last summer! My husband also liked the reduced fat/sugar version.

There's nothing better than an easy, stress-free ending to a summer meal. I made this for a small guest list dinner party served on my screened in porch. I was able to make it early in the day, freeing myself up to do other things throughout the day. It serves up beautifully in a crystal bowl with a little topping of vanilla yogurt. So summery in every way! Yummy!

This recipe is delicious. Although the berries sunk to the bottom, a lot of the liquid remained on top. The end result was that this was not the most attractive dessert. But the taste was fabulous and it really shows off summer berries so I'll be making it again.

This is easy and not too sweet. I found the vanilla flavor a bit overpowering, though, and in the future I'll cut it back to 1/2 teaspoon.

Everyone in the family loved this. The cake had an excellent texture and the blueberry flavor really came through nicely. Taste the blueberries before you add all the sugar. Ours were quite sour and the amount of sugar called for in the recipe was just right, so if yours are sweet, you'll need to cut back a bit.

Delicious with a fantastic texture! I also used frozen blueberries as I just missed the fresh blueberry season. I used 12 oz of frozen berries, only 3 Tbsp of water, and then left out about 1/2 of the berry juice when I assembled the pudding cake as I was afraid it would be too soggy with all of the juice. I will make this again and again with frozen berries throughout the winter. Loved it!

I made this cake in early spring using frozen blueberries,12 oz., and it was delicious! I used two eggs thinking it would hold it together better which it did and added a little more lemon zest than called for. Will definitely make it again this time with fresh berries as they are in season,even better I imagine!

For starters, I had fresh blueberries and used about 2.5 cups. This is more than the recipe called for but IMO this only enhanced the recipe. My berries were not the best I have ever eaten so I was a little surprised when I followed the recipe (not changing the amounts of sugar) and the blueberry sauce was a little on the sweet side. The sauce had a delicious flavor but it was just a little too sweet as far as I am concerned. The cake is good. It is a very buttery tasting cake. Overall the recipe is so easy that it will be added to blueberry baking repertoire with minor adjustments to the sugar in the blueberry sauce and the amounts of butter in the cake. Oh one last thing, I ate the cake both hot and cold. And I must say that I believe it was better cold. I thought that time only help improve the melding of the flavors.

I too ended up using more blueberries and it turned out great. I baked it in a silicon flexi-pan and turned it out on a cake plate topped with banana gelato (epicurious strawberry gelato recipe made with bananas). It was loved by all.

Blueberries. I love blueberries. In fact, I used 2 1/2 cups (instead of 2). It ended up being a very, berry treat .... more berry pudding than berry pudding cake. lol That's okay though since it makes the dessert taste more "nutritious" that way! The cake part was deliciously moist and would even be good just on it's own. This recipe is a keeper for my blueberry dessert collection.

I love this recipe and have been using it for a couple of years now. When simmering the blueberries, I use half water/half Chambord for a little extra flavor. The cake part of the recipe is so versatile that I use it for Peach Pudding Cake to and it's great.

Rating: 3
I'm not saying this isn't good but I didn't get the "berries sink to the bottom" feature when I made it. The batter was very loose and the berries, just kind of made a big pool in the middle while a cakey crust formed around them. The taste is a very buttery cake with sweet thickened berries. I would have liked more sauce and denser, like a cobbler, biscuit-like cake.

Rating: 4
I got some of the last fresh berries of the season and decided to try to make this fast tonight. It took about 15 minutes to prepare and it is delicious! I was uncertain when I put it in because the batter was thick and seemed so thin in the pan, and then the berries were so wet and soupy. But it baked up beautifully and the cake absorbed the berries and has a nice crisp on the edges and bottom. Tasty, fresh and so simple.

Liked the recipe. Very easy to make and tastes wonderful. But it is very similar to an easy cobbler recipe of my Grandmother's - so I would probably just stick with that recipe instead since it is pretty much a mix it up in a bowl type of recipe!

It's just a good, simple recipe that allows you to utilize seasonal berries. Don't get hung up on the "pudding" aspect of it - it's a warm cake that you eat with a spoon. It's delicious, it's simple and your guests will rave! Try it...

Just okay. The cake part was bland. A waste of good blueberries. If I wanted a blueberry dessert in the future I will make blueberry crisp.

I added 1/2 tsp. lemon rind to the blueberry mix. To the cake, I added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and 1/8 tsp. nutmeg and also increased the vanilla to 1 1/2 tsp. I did follow another reviewer's suggestion to use brown sugar in the blueberry mix. With this minor tweaking, the cake is sublime. I've made it with both fresh and frozen blueberries (hardly a difference). This has become a family favorite for a summer dessert.

I made this recipe last night for a casual dinner with friends. I was the only one who thought it was just ok. Blueberries are my favourite fruit and I found the flavour just wasn't intense enough-despite the fact that I added almost an extra cup. I did add grated lemon rind and may add even more next time -maybe that will do it. That said, the pan size was perfect, the blueberries do not sink until the baking and serving the dessert warm (reheats well)with frozen yogurt is a must.

Such an easy and tasty dessert! I made this with whole-wheat flour, so to compensate for the higher density of the dough, I added some extra milk. Also, subbed half yogurt for some of the milk to give the dough a little tanginess. Most importantly, I added some lemon juice and lemon zest to the batter, which made it a little more interesting. Yummy with a little whipped cream!

I have made this cake many times, with all different types of fruit. I have used peaches, nectarines, cherries, apricots, blackberries, apples and pears. It is a great recipe for whatever fruit you have in season...make sure to adjust the sugar in the jam accordingly based on how sweet your fruit is, and remember that some fruits cook down a lot more than others so you will have to pay attention to your finished volume of fruit. Experiment and enjoy!!

Easy and tasty - that's about all that needs saying. Used about 1 cup blackberries, 1/4 cup raspberries, 3/4 cup blueberries, and used 2 per cent milk with maybe 1/8 cup leftover half & half tossed in. Came out great! Definitely best warm, since the cornstarch thickens as it cools. Hard to beat this for 10 minutes prep in the kitchen and 30 in the oven! I would cut back on the sugar in the berries if serving for breakfast (could maybe even leave it out).

I made this last night with Farmers Market blueberries and it was EXCELLENT warm straight out of the pan, and superisingly EVEN BETTER today. Followed the directions exactly (I think) and my blueberries sank in some spots but not others. (Not sure why.)

I made this recipe without modifications and found it simple, delicious, and a great breakfast treat with a little fresh fruit and whipped cream on the side. For those who complained that it was too salty: the recipe calls for unsalted butter. If you use salted butter plus the tsp of salt called for, of course it will turn out too salty! Berries sunk just fine during baking, and it looked exactly like the picture. I would definitely make this again, perhaps experimenting with other berries as well. Easy, delicious, and a great no-fuss summer dish!

With a few minor modifications, this turned out fantastic! I substituted the milk for buttermilk and used an extra egg for increased richness.

Not a difficult recipe at all, even with the modifications! Perfectly moist and sweet. Definitely worth the effort and berries!!

I made this recipe with the "help" of my 3- and 5-year-old daughters. Thanks to their 50 million questions, I forgot to add the 1/2 cup sugar to the cake batter. When I realized my mistake (after I had already poured the blueberries over the batter, of course), I just added the sugar to the top of the blueberries and smooshed it in slightly. I had nothing to lose, having invested $5 worth of fresh blueberries in the recipe. As it turns out, it was still quite good. I agree wth the other reviewers that the addition of salt is unnecessary. I will definitely make it again -- hopefully without my girls' help.

I made this recipe for a brunch party and it was a hit. I dusted each serving with powdered sugar and served it a la mode with low-fat Edy's vanilla ice cream. I followed the recipe as called but saved a 1/5 cup bit of the syrup to drizzle on the top of the ice cream. It was divine. It was simple and refreshing. The best part was that it was a very yummy yet light dessert.

Subbed low-fat buttermilk for the milk and water, cut the butter back to 2/3 of a stick, increased the lemon juice to ~ 2/3 of a medium lemon, and used dark brown sugar. Whisked a healthy teaspoon of ground ginger, one pod's worth of vanilla beans, and a sprinkle of ground cloves into the flour. Omitted the salt. Used a 10 oz bag of previously frozen wild blueberries, with about half the juice drained off. Whisking the egg until frothy yielded a light, moist crumb to contrast with the mildly tart blueberry marbling.

I read a lot of the reviews before making this recipe for the first time. First can I just say "pudding" is an old world term often used to describe "dessert". Don't think of this as your average American cooked custard "pudding" dessert (e.g., Jell-o Pudding). That's not what this is, it's closer to a buckle and should be a cross between cake and fruit compote. Secondly, I made this for my hubby the first time according to the recipe, but did incorporate the advice of others (especially that about the salt) on this site. It was fab-o and he loved it. This is important because he's not a very big blueberry fan. The second time I made it, I used rhubarb (more to hubby's liking). It still turned out great, but needs a few modifications to be the same steller recipe of the original. I added to the ruhubarb some traditional spices (nutmeg, star anise, cinnamon) and used brown sugar instead of white in the fruit component only. As I said, I need to figure out the ratio (too much rhubarb to cake). I will do this by making the blueberry version again and measuring the blueberry syrup before adding it to the cake. However, if anyone has ideas on the amount of syrup to cake, I'd love to hear them. Bottom line, I'm adding this recipe to my summer/fall recipe collection. Give it a try, you won't regret it!

We've had this four times, which is unheard of in our kitchen in such a short time. Everyone has been pleased thus far. I don't cook the berries; I simmer the water-sugar-cornstarch-lemon and then put the berries in when the pan is off the heat. We love it.

Would make this again with some improvements, probably using brown sugar instead of white. I thought it had an overwhelming baking powder taste, a bit on the bitter side. Maybe I'll cut back on the baking powder next time. All in all it was pretty good, I did not use all the butter it called for and my blueberries did sink. Stirring them into the batter helps. Good with vanilla ice cream.

A friend served this with lemon verbena whipped cream, which was a terrific addition! Bring 1/4 c. whipping cream, 3 Tbs fresh lemon verbena (don't even need to chop it), and 2 Tbs. sugar just to a simmer. While this is cooling in the fridge, whip 2 c. cream to soft peaks. Strain the cooled verbena mixture, add to the rest of the cream and finish whipping. Just lovely - brought a nice contrast to the berries.

I made this twice, once as written and then with some changes. Much better with changes: half sugar, half brown sugar, as another reviewer suggested; poke some raspberries and/or blackberries into the batter before pouring the blueberries in; add a little more lemon juice plus 2 tb lemon zest. The simmered blueberries look strange poured over the batter but it all works out when the cake is done. The blueberries didn't sink, so I sort of pushed them into the batter more. With these changes, this is a very very easy, satisfying, and delicious dish.

I've been tinkering with this recipe since it first came out and just made it for the third time, which was the charm. Modifications: buttermilk instead of whole milk; light brown sugar instead of white; a pinch of cinnamon and cardamom in the batter; reduced salt to a pinch. Used a full pint of blueberries. Baked for 20 minutes exactly on convect, in a Le Creuset 10" round tarte tatin pan. The cake portion was light and springy, with more depth of flavor than original version, and more penetration into the cake by the blueberries. More puddingy. Several reviewers have complained about the saltiness, and they're right. The 1 tsp is excessive.

I made this this morning and we loved it for breakfast. My blueberries didn't sink (perhaps this has to do with how moist the berries are, not sure) but I assisted by making a few indentations in the batter with a spatula. It ended up looking just like the picture. Flavour was great - not too sweet, not salty. I think this could be prepared successfully with frozen berries in winter months. This is a nice quick homespun dessert (perhaps not a company dazzler, but then again I find that guests often love simple desserts like this that feature local foods in season).

I made this recipe with plums. My family said this was better than any cobbler I've ever made, probably because of the plums which were both sweet and tart. Blueberries require quite a bit of lemon juice to make them not so bland when cooked. Fruit didn't go to the bottom. What's the big deal? Batter came up through the fruit in places making the top look like half fruit and half cake. It looked as delicious as it was.

Despite all the precautions I took, based on the suggestions of other reviewers, I made this recipe and ended up with a mottled mess that wasn't worth the time, effort, and ingredients that went into it. I also found the Betty Crocker recipe that this was based on, mentioned in one review as a Bisquick recipe, and they were essentially the same - and I'd expect the same results from that recipe. The next time I have fresh blueberries on hand I'll make my cobbler recipe, which is similar to this (a layer of melted butter, a layer of batter, a top layer of fruit that really does sink to the bottom during baking). Don't waste your time with this recipe; I know I won't again

This recipe turned out exactly as it should. The blueberries sank (I thinkn the key is making sure not all the blueberries pop while in the saucepan). I added cinnamon and a little extra lemon juice; I think without these additions it would have been a little bland. I also would add a little more vanilla to the cake batter next time. A great tea cake, breakfast treat or dessert for guests.

After reading all the reviews, I couldn't imagine what I was going to end up with. Made the recipe exactly as written and it was delicious. It wasn't too salty, wasn't too sweet, wasn't too gooey, wasn't too dry..... it was what is was, a blueberry dessert! What are you people cooking with out there?

I put some cinamon in flour, and it came out really good. I would reduce suger next time as someone suggested. It was a bit too sweet for me. Blueberry did not sink although I followed the receipe exactly as written. Otherwise it is easy and great dessert.

I was expecting something very moist, but this was not that at all, in fact dry. Also found it very bland, no spices, e.g. cinnamon, to enhance the blueberries. My husband also found it salty, as the previous reviewers, however I used salted butter, as I usually do. And the recipe didn't make enough for 6 people for a breakfast, not by far. I would opt for another blueberry buckle recipe over this, definitely.

Simple and delicious, my kids and their friends loved this recipe. Being calorie conscience I substituted Splenda, low cal margarine and 1% milk-fabulous!! Quick, easy and tasty! I would agree with other reviews to definitely reduce the amount of salt, a pinch will do. As far as the type of cake this is, does it really matter? I think it would be great for breakfast/brunch, with tea or as a dessert with ice cream. What a versatile little cake!

Use fresh picked wild Himalayan Blackberries and its my mother's version of cobbler. Yes, a bit less salt, a bit less sugar, and some vanilla in the batter.

I made this with some excess blueberries that we had and accidentally forgot the sugar in the cake portion and it was still really good. I did add lemon zest and cinn / nutmeg as other people suggested. The blueberries all stayed on top of the cake, not sure why. Overall, a very easy and good dessert, served with vanilla ice cream!!

In my previous comment I neglected to say that among my other objections, I found this recipe to be way too sweet. Unnecessary with the sweetness of the blueberries. Blueberry pie would be a better choice if you need to do anything to blueberries in season.

I cannot believe anyone would waste delicious, fresh blueberries by using this recipe. It is mediocre at best and warmed blueberries with vanilla ice cream would be a much better dessert and no trouble to prepare. Very over rated and disappointing.

I'll have to be in the minority heree and say I didn't love this recipe. It wasn't bad, just boring, and certainly not something I'd serve for company. I have no idea why it's called "pudding" cake, since there was no pudding in sight! I thought it tasted like a bisquick cake with an uninspired blueberry topping.

Excellent flavor and texture and easy to put together. You will almost certainly have all the ingredients on hand. Makes a great dessert or decadent breakfast.

Rating: 3
This was great and a big hit all around. The recipe, though, drops off without any serving suggestions and so here's what i concluded: its a pudding more than a cake. I hestitated to pour all the liquid onto the batter but did, in the end. As noted by others (and the recipe), everything sank. I inverted the cooled pan & I think that made it much easier to serve (than it would have been otherwise). Nonetheless - however served, its really good a great use of fresh blueberries.

Rating: 3
I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious, although a tad salty. Very moist and not overly sweet. Would try with a light whipped cream next time for extra sweetness. My blueberries did not sink, in fact, the watery mess sloshing around on top of the batter as I slid it into the oven made me nervous and I started to cut of fresh watermelon as a back-up dessert last night. BUT the light and fluffy batter expanded and "took in" the berries and all the juice, somehow, during 27 minutes of baking. Perfection!

Like other reviewers I added ground cinnamon (1/2 tsp.) and ground nutmeg (1/4 tsp.) to the dry ingredients. These spices give the pudding cake a nice flavor. I used frozen blueberries and used the juice from the package. Next time I will drain the juice as it made the cake a little too liquidy when pouring the blueberry mixture over the batter. My husband was the first to taste the pudding cake and had two servings, one right after the other. Since he is not a real fan of "sweets", that means this dessert was just "sweet" enough, not overpowering at all. I will definitely make this again, it's so quick and easy and a real comfort food, especially served warm.

Although it disappeared in minutes during our block party - and everyone raved about it , I thought it was good - but needs some improvement. I cut down on the salt and used unsalted butter too.

i had high hopes for this but was slightly disappointed. i didn't think it was awful - just mediocre. i will make again though in an effort to correct. i love salt but thought, like many others, that it was too salty so i will cut salt in half, or use salted butter and omit salt entirely. also will try nutmeg and lemon zest (i added cinnamon.

Just excellent...way better than I expected. Per earlier reviewers, added lemon zest, ground cloves, and nutmeg to the blueberry sauce.

Modifications: omitted 2 tbsp of the butter. Added small amounts of nutmeg, clove and cinnamon to the blueberries, and extra lemon juice. Doubled the vanilla in the cake batter. I do think it would have been a little bland otherwise. I also spooned some of the batter over the blueberry layer. With the additions, it's delicious (very sweet) and very easy. The cake part is buttery and tasty, and using fresh blueberries prevents them from falling apart so it stays pretty.

So simple and great for breakfast! I think its going to be one of my new favorites! I was nervous from the other reviewers to avoid adding all the liquid from the bluberries so I added about half and I wish I added it all. The liquid would have made it much moister (hence the pudding part of the name) but even so, it is still VERY tasty!

Delicious! I made this last night with only two modifications. Based on other reviews I reduced the salt to less than a 1/2 tsp which seemed to be about right. I had frozen berries so I used those instead of fresh. Otherwise I followed the recipe to the letter and it came out perfectly. Moist and not too sweet for us. This will be one of my dessert standbys since I usually have all these ingredients stocked in my kitchen.

Save those fresh blueberries for a worthier dish. Bland---very low pleasure to effort ratio. I added a little cinnamon and zest to no avail: lacked distinction. This dish might look good in a photograph but it doesn't pass the tongue test.

Our family loves blueberry desserts in the summer so I tried this one cause it was a little different. While it was easy and quick, it definitely needs something, like cinnamon and nutmeg to enhance the flavor. Even with extra blueberries (freshly picked besides), it was only so-so.....

Had no cornstarch, so I omitted it (dangerous, but it still worked) and no milk, so I used sour cream and some extra vanilla. Added some toasted slivered almonds on top, and voila. The recipe is forgiving enough still to have turned out blue-ly attractive and extremely tasty! This would make a great brunch sweet; mine was a bit too funky looking for a formal dessert.

Very good, very easy to prepare and can be made in advance - tho' it's best served slightly warm. I served it with Creme Anglaise first spooned onto cut glass desert plates, then squares of the cake and a garnish of fresh mint and a few strips of lemon zest (strips not grated). If you want to get fancy add 1-2 T of cassis to the blueberry sauce. French vanilla ice cream is another most acceptable accompanint to this excellent finale.

I've made this cake twice and it's very yummy. I used a slotted spoon to load the berries on top of the batter; it would have been too gooey with all the liquid added. I added some of the blue liquid to whipped cream and served it alongside the cake. The blue goo is also good for french toast, pancakes or just tasting with a finger or spoon!

I followed the recipe exactly, and used a 9 inch sqare pan. Like many others have noted, the blueberries did not sink; and the texture was cake-like, not pudding-like.

My friends and family LOVED this recipe. The first time I prepared it I made it right before dinner so it was ready and hot for dessert. We served it with french vanilla ice cream and it was a hit. It even came out looking just like the picture. We had leftovers for breakfast at room temperature and that was just as big a hit. It was like two cakes in one!!!! We are currently on our third batch!!! I definitely recommend this cake.

I made this for a brunch today. Since my husband is on a low fat, low salt diet I used skim milk, unsalted butter and a very small pinch of salt which I would omit next time. It was served slightly warm with non fat lemon yogurt on top. My friends wanted the recipe and I will make it again. Using whole milk would make it richer but we don't have that in our house.

This is the "scratch" version of a "pudding" my mom has made for 50 years with sweetened bisquick. The trick is to take the fruit and juice to a simmer before pouring it over the dough. Then the fruit sinks thru the dough and makes a delectable squidgy fruit jam at the bottom of the pan. Mom always used a 9x13 pan and a quart of fruit and juice. I beg for it every time I go home.

While my family and I found this to be tasty, I wouldn't say that it was anything special. I followed the recipe with the exception that I used salted butter and reduced the amount of salt that I added to the batter. My berries really didn't sink that much so I ended up with blueberries sitting on top of a somewhat firm cake. Overall, I would say that it's not an outstanding dessert but it is a quick and easy one for a weeknight meal.

I used multigrain flour instead of white - it made the cake more interesting. I added the berries to the thickened liquid and then took the pan off the heat. It looked lovely and got rave reviews from my family - my two year old grandson called it blueberry treat. I am looking forward to using this one often - and with other berries and fruits.

Thought this was tasty & will make again with modifications. My blueberries sunk so that was not an issue. I reduced the amount of sugar in the 1st step to 1/4 cup and next time will heat liquids to disolve and add the berries but not cook them. Also found this a bit salty but was more put off by the metalic taste of the baking powder. Next time will try 1/2 tsp salt & 1 1/2 tsp max of baking powder. I think some light brown or even raw sugar in place of some of the white sugar would add richness as the taste was a bit flat. So all in all - maybe 2 1/2 forks. Don't overmix the flour - that is key!

This is really good! I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with a spongy cake on the bottom and a broiled blueberry topping -- in other words, my berries didn't sink. At all. But it's not a problem, because it all tastes so good. I like the idea of the brown sugar and think I'll try that next time (there will be many next times, I suspect... at least during blueberry season!). Oh, and I didn't think it tasted too salty at all. Maybe it's a question of personal preferences, maybe (not to point fingers) there was a slight error in measurement, maybe... I don't know. But this is a really good recipe, a great way to use those fresh mid-summer blueberries.

Salt thoughts: Sea salt tastes far less 'salty' than table salt ... and then there's kosher salt, gray salt, etc. If a recipe gives no hint, it's easy to make a wrong turn. For baking, table salt is nearly always best for the small even grains spread evenly throughout the batter. But if this recipe were written/tested w something else, that might explain the salt comments.

Rating: 4
This is fabulous--I followed the recipe exactly, although next time, I think i'll follow advice of other reviewers and not cook berries just to see how it goes. On the salt question, 1 tsp. salt for 1 cup of flour is ridiculously high, even if you use unsalted butter. I cut down to 1/2 t. and it was fine. But I've noticed this with lots of other Gourmet recipes. Someone in their test kitchen REALLY likes their salt, so beware!!!

I would have given it 4 forks except that I also found it too salty, even though like many others I reduced the salt. I'd use 1/2 tsp or less next time. One trick for the person who had trouble stirring the melted butter into cold milk: mix the butter into the egg first, then add the milk. The egg/butter combination is less likely to get lumpy when you add the cold milk.

After making this and reviewing it last week, I tried a variation today using a 6-ounce container of low-fat Stoneyfield blueberry yogurt in lieu of the milk. Also cut back the sugar in the batter to 1/3 cup, because of the sweetener in the yogurt, but used light brown instead of white sugar. Loved it even more than the original recipe. As before, used a 10" round enameled cast iron pan, and baked on convect for just 20 minutes.

good but the recipe was hard to follow...ie "whisking melted butter after its cooled with milk, egg..." Uh yeah whats fun is whisking melted room temp butter into semi-cold milk and egg then you have a flippin mess.

This is just incredibly good for such a simple recipe - a real keeper. I followed the recipe - except for adding a bit of lemon zest as recommended by one reviewer. One person referred to it being too salty - but I reduced the salt as I always do in ANY recipe. Several people mentioned trying it with other fruit - I suppose you could use almost any fruit - even fresh cherries. (These might not work if you just add fresh fruit without cooking first as one reviewer did successfully). As far as not meeting the definition of 'pudding' - I think it falls more into the category of what used to be called 'cottage pudding' - however - the berries on the bottom do form a thick sauce. Whatever - it is SO good!

This was heavenly!!! I needed a good blueberry pie/cake recipe as my daughter was coming to visit and she loves blueberries. This was an easy, fool-proof recipe. I only had a frozen container of wild blueberries (14 oz) so I used them and it was absolutely delicious. As another reviewer notes, though, you must use unsalted butter. This is now my official blueberry recipe, also!

This recipe is easy and very affordable!! I agree with other reviewers that it would be great with other fruits. Also, to the reviewer that stated the batter was "too salty"-that's why the recipe calls for un-salted butter. I always use that for baking, and it seems to make all the difference. I also added a pinch of cinnamon and freshly ground nutmeg to my berries. Its in the oven now, and I can't wait to taste!!

I did not pre-cook the blueberries or use any of the ingredients for pre-cooking them. I just made the cake as per the recipe, spread it in an 8x8 metal pan, then poured on a 6-oz container of fresh (raw) blueberries. This homey cake was fantastic! It is a moist and tender cake with a slight tang. We served it topped with fresh mulberries and vanilla ice cream. The whole thing came together quickly and baked while we ate dinner. We look forward to making it with fresh peaches, topped with fresh raspberries. Trust me, skip the pre-cooking on the fruit!

A great blend of tart/sweet, and an easy, impressive way to take advantage of the seasonal abundance of blueberries.

Quick, easy and very yummy! What more could one want from a simple, homey dessert? Re the blueberries: I added the juice from 1 large lemon, deleted the water and simmered only until the sugar dissolved so the berries were still whole and not mushy/liquidy - about 1-1/2 minutes. Re the cake: I stirred the fine zest from the whole lemon into the batter. Results: The cake had a nice lemon flavour; the blueberries were also pleasantly lemon-tangy and were well distributed throughout the cake as well as on top. Served warm with whipped cream sprinkled with a little more lemon zest and received many sighs of pleasure from my dinner guests.

This was very pleasant. I didn't have any lemon juice, so I substituted Grand Marnier and cut back a little on the sugar. Yum! It does look a little strange before going in the oven. The cake batter looks like pale polenta and then you dump the blueberry mixure on top. But it was picture-perfect after baking. I used an 8X8 pan and it cooked in 25 minutes.

Nothing beats a recipe that tastes great, is easy to make. The cake looked exactly as it appeared in the photo and was moist and full of fruit. I am going to try freezing one to see how that works out. Anyone who was unsuccessful the first time, try the recipe again. It's worth it.

This is a great, easy, and rustic recipe, and I can imagine it used with lots of different fresh berry ingredients! We are currently "between berries" in our local growing season, so I had to use canned blueberries (drained and rinsed). This did not mar the recipe's success: they sunk as the batter rose during baking. Next time, I'll add lemon peel and Chambord (black raspberry liqueur) to the mix, as suggested by another reviewer. To those who seem disappointed that this didn't turn out like a pudding, I challenge them to explore the wider world of puddings beyond bland egg and milk dessert custards. For example, the British call a baked batter of flour, milk and eggs, with the addition of meat drippings a "Yorkshire pudding."

Wonderful! I made this last night for a gathering, and multiplied everything by 1 1/2 and baked it in a 13x9 glass dish for the same amount of time as the recipe calls for. It turned out great. The only slightly tricky measurements were the baking powder (I used 2 1/2 teaspoons) and the egg (I just used one extra-large egg). As noted by others, the berries and liquid do not sink immediately, but will during the cooking period. I would imagine this would be wonderful with raspberries and blackberries as well. I will definitely make this again whenever I have fresh blueberries.

Okay no "pudding" texture or "sinking of berries" took place here but - a truly fresh and wonderful simple marriage of fresh fruit (I probably used more than 2 cups) and lemon cake batter created a very tasty dessert. We shared it with our 94 year old neighbour who pronounced it "wonderful".

This was easy to make and worked perfectly for me in an 8X8 square glass baking dish. My husband loved it warm with vanilla ice cream. The berries did not sink when I poured the berry mix on the batter (recipe led me to think they would sink immediately for some reason) however the cake rose and the berries sank during cooking and it turned out perfectly. It has a very airy consistency and would be a superb dish for a dessert at a buffet supper or dinner party. It also microwaves well to warm it up again. I will definitely make again and recommend to friends...It is one of those dishes that is easy to make but it seems quite special and different...

This is a very simple cake that is perfect for breakfast or a picnic. I have made it twice, using different sized pans to see the effect. In an 8 inch square glass dish you will get a core of blueberry that is tasty but not very pretty for guests. Using a 9 inch round glass dish I got a more presentable cake but less pudding like consistency and more suitable for breakfast than dessert.

Maybe the batter was too thick on the first reviewers cake, but this was absolutely perfect when we made it last night. Our guests ate seconds and my office this morning ate the rest for breakfast. Set up beautifully and has many layers of blueberries and cake. Fantastic! To the first reviewer, try it again, it's worth it!

This was extremely simple to prepare but very disappionting in appearance. My blueberry mixture did not "sink" as described. The surface had a violet discoloration and not the golden and blue contrast as photographed. It tasted fine, not great. There wasn't any component that could be construed as "pudding". I followed the instructions exactly and made no substitutions.
