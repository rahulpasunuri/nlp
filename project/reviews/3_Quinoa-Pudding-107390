I'm rating my version of this recipe which I changed quite a bit. I'd love some help trouble-shooting this if anyone tries my version. I cooked the Quinoa in two cups of milk. I heated two cups of milk on the stove and added 1 cinnamon stick, 1 vanilla bean, and 1/3 cup SPLENDA. I figured this allowed me to test the sweetness before adding the raw eggs. I then added the egg/milk/salt mixture. I omitted the breadcrumbs, nuts, and raisins. Next time I will add more cinnamon (powder) and vanilla extract to boost the flavour. Maybe even a little rose water. I'm not sure what to expect as far as consistency goes, but it tasted alright. I added some fresh berries today which improved the taste. Adding the egg custard, made the dessert not as sweet as I might have liked. I'm not convinced my method of cooking in the milk even requires teh egg custard, as by cooking it milk, you get sort of the consistency of rice pudding. I may try it again without the egg custard. Definitely a recipe worth playing with.

I read all the reviews before making this, so I only used 1/3 cup Sucanat (Sugar Cane Natural) instead of all that sugar. I also reduced the fat by using skim milk and only two whole eggs plus one egg white. I added 1 tsp cinnamon to the mix, as well as one shredded apple, and a small handful of dried blueberries. (Ileft out the currants). It is delicious, low fat, and not too sweet. I will make it again.

I only do 1/2 a recipe because this makes so much... we also double the raisins and almonds as well as mixing the cinnamon throughout. Accordingly, we are able to seriously cut the sugar. The bread crumbs simply aren't needed. Great for breakfast or dessert this is a fabulous way to get a complete protein into my daughter! A must have at least once each week.

For my taste, this is more like hot cereal than bread pudding. First time around, a little too sweet and bland. Second time around, I changed the sugar to brown and added the raisins to the last part of the quinoa prep to steam them up a bit, so they wouldn't sink to the bottom. Somewhat healthful (for a sweet recipe) and tasty, but not spectacular.

Quinoa originated in the Andean region of South America, especificly in Peru. Got 12% - 18% of protein, I Love the idea of this recipe, I agree... too much sugar...

Yum! I used two eggs (all I had) and 1/3 c. sugar. Came out great! Topped it with a drizzle of maple syrup and chopped pecans when serving. Totally delicious.

A very unique and interesting dessert. I actually used a product called Whey Low sugar and did not find it to be overly sweet. Whey Low sugar (while a bit pricey) has 70% less calories than regular sugar and a greatly reduced glycemic index but does not come with the artificial taste of other sugar substitutes. I do love the blueberry idea of the other reviews. I will try that next time.

Definitely too sweet. You could use 1/2 the sugar or simply replace all the sugar with apple juice as someone suggested below. Still I will make this recipe again because it was a great way to use leftover quinoa and tasty. I'll eat the remainder with plain yogurt. -- could probably also use something to make it more creamy.

I prepped the quinoa the usual way with 2x water and agree there is too much sugar in this recipe. The second time I made it, I omitted sugar, increased the cinnamon and added fresh raspberries, blueberries and bananas instead of the dried fruit. A great dessert or breakfast.

I never thought quinoa would taste so good. Haha. I skipped the crumbs and I think by accident used more sugar on top but it kind of caramelised so it was nice. It's WAY too sweet even for my sweet tooth. I'll see what it tastes like tomorrow cold...

Revisions: I agree w/others, no need to go through so much work to rinse the grain. Simply boil for 15 minutes, strain, and steam for a few minutes. I used skim milk as well as a cored/skinned apple instead of raisins, etc. I also eliminated the extra sugar. I just added 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the general mix and sprinkled with cinnamon in the end. Perfect, healthy dessert or breakfast!

Splendid. I forgot the breadcrumbs but didn't miss them. This recipe could probably withstand a reduction in sugar. I also boil and then steam the quinoa according to this recipe-- http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/reviews/108112 -- as I believe it turns out fluffier and drier. It's not significantly more work, and probably results in less water content in the pudding.

I am perplexed as to why anyone would cook 1 cup of quinoa in SIX cups of water, when quinoa is cooked in a 2:1 ratio of water to grain & does not need to be drained at the end of cooking. That said, I used 1 cup of cooked, leftover quinoa, which promptly sank to the bottom of the cooked pudding, leaving a custard on top. All of which is quite nice. However, I'd rather serve this as a yummy breakfast dish, than as a dessert, topped with some yogurt.

What a delicious and unusual recipe. I love the fact that quinoa is very healthy and high in protien. Will be making it often.

Very tasty recipe! And simple, with simple ingredients. I used slivered almonds, but added a handful more of them as well as a handful more of raisins. I tend to like cinnamon, so I put in about one-eighth teaspoon in with the batter, and mixed up a more generous mixture of sugar and cinnamon for the topping. A really unusual and lovely dish. Will definitely make it again!!

This pudding was great! The quinoa gave a nice texture (as did the ground walnuts). I made it in indvidual buttered ramekins and thought it was wonderful comfort food. I used dried sweetened cranberries (since I had no currants nor raisins) and they were fantastic.
