To eckmanm - the directions are: "Pour polenta into a lightly oiled shallow 1 1/2-quart bowl and cool." The bowl is the mold.

While making this recipe I found that not only are the instructions oorly written, but they are incomplete. There was no mention of needing a mold, nor was there any direction to mold the polenta, the directions simply said "unmold the polenta". I thik the sauce was good, and would only make this again using the store-bought polenta and the sauce from the recipe.

I used the store bought Polenta that comes in the tube. I put the cheese (I substituted Monterray Jack) on after I flipped the Polenta. It was great!

There are so many delicious dishes that one can make with polenta. I love this recipe and one other with roasted bell pepper ketchup. It would be good with other kinds of cheese, also and I think with the roast bell pepper sauce or ketchup.
