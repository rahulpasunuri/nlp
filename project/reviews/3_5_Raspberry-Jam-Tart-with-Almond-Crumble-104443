I made this with blackberry jam instead of raspberry for Christmas dinner - omg was it good. I used Bonne Maman jam and a pack of Cascadian Farms frozen blackberries, thawed and stirred into the jam. It was basically like a big linzer tart. Only complaint is that it fell apart a little when I went to serve it, but honestly, no one cared. It tasted ridiculously good. Served it with whipped cream and subbed almond extract for the usual vanilla in the whipped cream - mmmm. Definitely will keep this in the repertoire - it was so easy and yummy!

Simple and tasty. I made this exactly as the recipe called for, except I forgot to set aside dough for the crumble on top until after I mixed in the egg. But this was not a problem and the egg helped the crumble adhere in chunks better. I used jam with seeds in it. Good crust.

This is a very good, easy recipe. It is also rather sweet. I added some raspberries to the jam before baking which I think was a good addition. I also used almond meal instead of processing whole almonds.

The temperature times on the recipe are not correct. I tried to bake this tart two times and adjusted the times and both instances the crust was burnt.

I made this with blackberry jam and a box of fresh, big blackberries. You MUST add the fresh fruit. Mix it with the jam before you put it on the crust. I also used a piece of parchment paper on the bottom of the tart pan to make removal of the tart that much easier. Really impressive up on a cake plate.

I am hoping someone can help me... My son and I made this recipe twice this weekend (as practice forhis 5th grade bake-off) and while it was delicious, we had a very hard time getting the tart to release from the pan's fluted edges. Did anyone have this problem and if so, what did you do?

Great recipe. Easy and impressive. it is on the sweet side but still, very tasty. Would be good with either a little whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. Will definitely make again.

Wonderful! I added about a tablespoon of Amaretto to the seedless raspberry jam, also added fresh raspberries and blackerries. Fast and delicious!

Absolutely divine - everyone raved about it and asked it they could take some home - and one of the easiest desserts I have ever made.

I have made this tart many times and it always gets people raving! The only problem I have ever had is with the crust sticking to the bottom of the tart pan, but lining it with parchment paper fixes that. YUM!

Delicious! Served with homemade vanilla ice cream. Everyone loved it.

This is my old stand by for a quick delish dessert. Everyone always asks if I bought it and I never tell! Even better is I always have the ingredients on hand so can make it at a moments notice!

I made this for a Christmas dessert. Made it the night before, then traveled with it. It received rave reviews. It could not have been easier to make. The crust is moist and delicious. As a previous reviewer noted, the final product is probably only as good as the jam used. I used Stonewall Kitchen's raspberry jam and it turned out great. The tart is very sweet, so each person only needs a sliver...but after a big meal, that's all anyone has room for anyway.

Four forks for ease, it is is true. Flavors, though overly sweet, are good but this is such a very basic jam/almond tart, I'm not sure what all the raves are about. Certainly not company fare. I won't be making this again.

I have been making this since 2000, and it is a hit every time. Excellent recipe.

If you're looking for a quick dessert to make ahead, this is a great one. My guests loved it. It's definitely on the sweet side, but the crust is yummy and nutty. I made it the night before and kept it in the fridge, then served with vanilla ice cream.

Delicious and very easy to make. Plan to try variations on this recipe, even though it's great as is. I did add frozen raspberries (thawed first). Thinking of adding the cream layer from the "Fresh Raspberry Cream Tart" recipe on this site. Also, I think the almond crumble could be jazzed up a bit. What I loved was the jammy taste of the filling, and the almond crust. This will become one of my regulars.

Super easy and a hit.

This is delicious - one of our favorites. Try it with seedless jam (Smuckers makes some). I think the recipes makes a little more crust than you can squeeze into the tart pan, so if you have some left over, don't fret - you're not the only one!

Fabulous and so easy! I have made this several times in the last month and it has been a hit every time!

This dish was FABULOUS. I wanted all different kinds of "new" dishes for my Christmas buffet and I had selected this as one of the desserts. It was easy and quick to make and it was the first thing to go. People were licking up the crumbs! I should have made two and skipped the pudding. I served it with a chocolate Cool Whip. I am about to make it again for a birthday party. It's a sure winner.

Excellent and easy. I also added about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of frozen raspberries which worked out great.

I've made this recipe time and again. It is a winner! In order to improve the filling, I combine real rapsberries (in the Summer) or frozen ones (in other seasons) to the jam (about half & half). It is just as simple and gives great results!

I used this recipe to make an excellent bar cookie. I used a 9x13 inch pan; there was just enough dought to make the crust. Though the recipe didn't specify seedless jam, I strained mine and liked the results.

This is yummy but probably no better than the quality of the jam you use. Watch the timing so as not to overcook.

A treat this good and attractive shouldn't be this easy to make. Everyone thinks it must have taken forever! I make this any time I'm in a crunch. I especially like that all the ingredients are things you can have in the house at all times and don't need to be bought fresh. I might try it with apricot jam next time for fun, but the combination of raspberry and almond is perfect. The recipe is foolproof.

A snap to make, and all my guests loved it at Christmas. (Plus it looks like it was more difficult to make.)I'm making it again in a heart shaped tart pan for a Valentine's get-together. This one's a keeper.
