I made this gluten-free by using ground almond meal with the fruit and ground oatmeal for the topping. Delicious! It smells great when it's cooking and tastes amazing. The maple syrup whip cream is well worth it too!!

This is a great recipe! As others have mentioned, I cut down on the sugar and used a little less butter. For the topping, I used 1 C. flour and 1/2 cup rolled oats.

Made this as described, except cut proportions in half, used all granny smith apples, dried cherries, tossed in some blackberries and used a ceramic pie dish. Delicious!! This would be great with many fruit combinations.

Very easy to make and very delicious. I omitted the cherries and the whipped topping,and it was still amazing! My friends told me that instead of the usual Dutch Apple pie I usually bring to potlucks, I should bring this. Perfect recipe!

Simple and absolutely delicious. I halved the sugar requirements in the recipe and it was perfect.

I was looking for something with an apple/pear combination and this was great. I didn't have dried cherries so I used dried cranberries and it was terrific. Wouldn't change anything in the recipe

Very very good. Dried cherries were pretty pricey, but it might work with cranberries. Try it the 'correct' way first though. Agreed with the previous comment, way less sugar is needed to mix in with the fruit.

Very easy to make, although I may reduce the sugar used to toss the fruit in as is was quite sweet.
