Oh my goodness these are absolutely wonderful! I found these very easy to make -- I used a small relatively stiff paintbrush and a silicon mold. Dropped the chocolate into the mold and then painted it up the sides with the brush and chilled then added the filling which was simple to make (I took the skins of the hazelnuts) and when those had chilled added the base. Just popped one out to see if it worked -- it did and how! My partner even commented that they looked like real chocolates!

I give these candies 5 stars for the amazing flavor. I could have eaten every one of them myself. That said, they were not easy to make. I bought a set of kids' paint brushes at Target and used one long narrow brush to paint the chocolate in each paper candy cup. I had to hold the cup in my fingers and painstakingly paint each one. This took a long time. OK, fine, the brush helped. But after all was said and done, the paper stuck terribly and you had to peel each paper cup off of the candy. I'm planning to purchase a silicone pan for candies. That way, I can chill the candies, pop them out of the pan easily, and plop them into a paper candy cup. I gave them as gifts, so unfortunately I can't warn everyone that peeling off the paper cup strip by strip is worth it. Yum.

Wow! I love trying new recipes like this one, and several of my friends told me that this was their single favorite thing I've ever made. I used doubled 1" paper cups and the back of a teaspoon to coat them (worked a LOT better than either a boar bristle or silicon pastry brush). Had plenty of both types of goo. The basic coating part of the recipe is very versatile. I'd like to try a peanut butter filling and a mint filling next time, too!

I thought these were WONDERFUL!!! My oldest daughter loves Nutella so I'm always looking for some new way to use it. And these made delicious little treats to send to her at college (and further my reputation as a Kitchen Goddess!) for Valentines Day. I didn't use the candy molds this first time, but I will every time I make these again. And I will make lots of these! They were an absolute HIT with everyone who tried them. I agree, these little babies are impressive, are not that difficult to make (but I'll never tell anyone that) and worth the time without a doubt.

I used petit four foil cups which I believe are smaller than the mini muffin cups and found I had a lot of both the bittersweet and hazelnut mixture leftover. I think I used about 1/2 of the hazelnut mixture before running out of foil cups, and I ended up making 40. I did not use molds so some of the cups did not come out perfectly round but were still presentable. I went with a previous reviewer's suggestion of microwaving the chocolate and using a spoon to place the chocolate in each cup without any problems. They took some time to make but made great gifts!

Loved this delicious recipe! I used both cups and molds, and I must say the molds ended up in a more professional looking result. Didn't have any problems whatsoever preparing them, and the recipe yield was as stated. This recipe is going in my tried and true repertoire!

I made these last year for my daughter's pre-school teachers as a Christmas present and shared the "leftovers" with several friends. They were a "HIT" and I have already received 4 requests to make them again this year. I used the Wilton Candy molds and chopped hazelnuts (as I was unable to find whole ones) - which worked out perfectly. It took a little time, but once you get everything set up, you can move along "assembly line" style.

Very rich, sweet, impressive-looking, and time-consuming. I needed only 13oz, not 18oz, of the bittersweet chocolate. The melted bittersweet chocolate hardens at room temperature quickly, so melt only a few ounces at a time as needed. Forget the double boiler; a microwave does the job quite well. Even the hazelnut mixture hardens at room temperature eventually, so coat all cups before preparing the hazelnut mixture. The pastry brush was inefficient and messy. It's much faster to use a regular spoon to place a dollop of melted chocolate at the bottom of the cup. With the back of the spoon, push the chocolate up the sides of the cup. Then again, I had the benefit of mini-muffin tins, which propped up the candy cups perfectly. I am impressed that people were able to make these easily without them. BTW, I calculated that each cup is 150 calories without the whole hazelnut. Ouch.

These turned out great. I used Wilton plastic candy molds instead of paper cups -- the ones that look like the small Reese's. Worth the effort.

These take a little time to make, but are easy and delicious. They will be part of my holiday treats from now on.

Made these for Christmas this year and they are as good as store bought chocolates. Great gift for a chocoholic! They look impressive but are easy to make.

Very time consuming but delicious. I recommend using smaller mouthed cups rather than the larger mouthes (like Wilton brand). The larger mouthed cups were more difficult to handle and the first coating of chocolate cracked when I picked them up to fill with the Nutella mixture. I've made them two years in a row as Christmas gifts and the recipients were very impressed!

I made these for gifts last year at Christmas. Everyone raved over them. They were delicious. They are very time-consuming, but not too difficult, and the effort is worth it if you're trying to impress. They look very nice with the hazelnut on top, but I started to run out of filling at the end and started putting the hazelnut inside (a little filling, a hazelnut, a little more filling, cover with chocolate) as filler, and that turned out to be even better, for the surprise of finding a nut inside.
