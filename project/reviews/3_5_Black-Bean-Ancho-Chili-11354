I made this chili times 1 1/2 for a party last night. Let me tell you, the original recipe makes much more than 4-6 servings. We had plenty for 9 people plus about 1 quart of leftovers. The dried chili puree makes this dish. So, if you are thinking about leaving it out, don't! This was fantastically spicy and flavorful and a great vegetarian chili option.

I made this using canned beans and it was quite good. I added some habanero for a kick. Also added tomatoes to the salsa as one person suggested. For the meat eaters version I cubed and cooked some steak and added to the chili. My husband loved it.

Good recipe. Easy to follow, and I liked the result. I would factor in some extra time for the beans to get tender - maybe an extra hour or so.

Wonderful, hearty chilli recipe. The beans take much longer to cook than indicated. Next time, I plan on cooking the beans with the lid on for an hour, and then removing the lid to cook off any excess water. I love the rich chocolatey color. Corn might be a good addition.

This is an excellent, hearty black bean chili. As has been previously mentioned, the black beans take about an hour longer to cook than stated in the recipe. The result is worth the wait.

This is a great recipe. However, I made a few changes: *added 1Tbsp Corriander powder along with Cumin; * boiled water for bean soaking, removed it from heat, added beans, covered one hour. Also added one diced, seeded tomato and 1 tbsp of sour cream to avacado salsa to make it more of a guacamole. everyone loved this dish.

Excellent! I have added cooked ground turkey at times and it is great.

A very good, hearty chili! The beans needed an extra hour to cook. Adding salt and more lime juice and cilantro helped a lot. I added 2 tbs. chickpea flour (besan) to make it thicker and served it on rice. Two other Epicurious chilis I highly recommend are the Vegetable and Bean Chili and the Lamb Chili. All the best.

Super recipe! You have to be aware of how hot your anchos are, since they are not all created equally. Having some rather hot ones, I cut the amount down to about two ounces (or three large anchos), and that was plenty to make a very hot, spicey chili (and I am a Californian used to spicey Mexican food). Other than that, I made it per the recipe and was very satisfied. The comment about salt was right on, I think -- you have to taste carefully to adjust for salt before serving because the recipe itself doesn't contain much salt, other than what you add yourself (and the chicken stock, which can be salty).

Very good chili - made it for guests and they asked for the recipe - the beans took longer to cook than the recipe stated, so be sure to taste test and I added a good bit of additional cilantro.

I made this for a pot luck at work for the vegetarians in the office, and it turned out to be the favorite of everybody. I modified the recipe just a little by cutting back on the tomato (it's a lot) and using vegetable stock instead of chicken stock. If you make this, don't be worried if it doesn't seem like it'll turn out good while you're making it. The finishing touches (lime, cilantro) really pull it all together. I was really amazed at how hearty a meal this makes. This goes good as a replacement for meat in tacos as well.

This was quite yummy, even though as I was making it I wasn't quite impressed. The addition of the cilantro and lime juice at the end really makes a difference! I also had to add quite a bit of salt "to taste", and I'm generally not a salt fiend. I also didn't add the one cup of chicken broth, the consistency was fine and definitely didn't want to thin it out anymore than it was. Next time I'll probably add some ground chorizo to make it a bit more hearty, although it was GREAT as is.

Very good black bean chili, and reasonably low fat.

I have been making this chili since 1992. It is a crowd pleaser and really delicious. I add an additional onion and a few more cloves of garlic. Also, I am generous on the cumin and chili pepper. I substitute more chicken stock than water.
