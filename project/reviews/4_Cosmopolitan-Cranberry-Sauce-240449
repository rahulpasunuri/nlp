This recipe is amazing! I added a 1/4 cup of grated orange peel and 1/3 cup of Drambuie instead of vodka which was absolutely delicious! This was an easy recipe to follow and I couldn't recommend it more.

I have been making this for years. I have stopped looking at any other recipes because this one is PERFECT!

I made this last thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I put the vodka and GM in just as the sauce was finishing up on the stove cooking most of the alcohol off but leaving the flavors. I had several children for dinner. I made this a few weeks ago putting the vodka and GM as perscribed in the recipe. Way too boozy but mellowed the second day. I still like my way better.

Delicious and beautiful when served in Cosmo glasses.

There's no excuse for opening a can of cranberry sauce, even during busy holiday meal preparations. This is the best cranberry sauce EVER, and so easy even a kid could do it. I always buy fresh cranberries in season and freeze some just so I can make this sauce at other times of the year. It's an unexpected cool side for a hot summer night...wow! Don't leave out anything...all the booze is necessary for flavor, and all the alcohol cooks out of it so it's OK for the kiddies. Yum!

Bravo! So easy, so delicious. It was very alcoholic when I first made (no problem here), but it mellowed out by the next day. It will be my go to cranberry sauce from now on. It was just lovely.

This recipe rocks! It has been a hit every time I make it, there are never any leftovers. You can use different flavored vodkas, to change it up.

Excellent - everyone enjoyed this sauce at Thanksgiving - will use again as it was so easy yet good. I reduced the sugar but otherwise followed the directions.

I was looking for a new recipe to try and this looked good. Made it the night before Thanksgiving. It was a hit. There was none left. I will be making this again and again

Eureka! A delicious cranberry sauce that doesn't have orange zest! I was worried about it being too boozy, so followed the advice of another reviewer and used 3T vodka along with the 3T Grand Marnier. It's still not a kid dish, but for the grownups, this is absolutely delicious. AND, it's easy! Try it. :)

by A Cook from vancouver, bc : Why the heck would you feed these to the kids... I make these every year and they are a huge hit the the "Adults" of the family. I make a separate dish for the children.

not a hit at our Thanksgivings dinner last night. We all said that we preferred the basic one with orange zest. Also, this was way too boozy for the kids.

I made 2 batches of this sauce for Thanksgiving, and my guests all loved it. I couldn't resist multiple 'taste tests' while making it. :-) Very easy to make, great taste, and will be my standard from now on.

I made this twice in a row in 2010: Thanksgiving and Xmas. It is very good, though it looks less elegant than the picture. But the taste is terrific. I cant add anything more than what other reviewers have said. Make it and you wont be sorry!.

I like trying new foods (or new variations on food I've had before) so I gave this recipe a try. My whole family really enjoyed it. Sometimes I find myself wanting to make turkey just so we can have this cranberry sauce again.

Rating: 4
This outranked the non-alcoholic version - even with my mother-in-law who no longer drinks. Adding the lime rind at the end seals the deal. I also went with orange-flavored vodka. I could smell the alcohol cooking off when I added it before the sauce was fully-cooled. That could be the answer to the question I previously posted. This is the new go-to cranberry sauce.

Real simple - it rocks! This is now our new traditional Cranberry Sauce!

Has anyone added the vodka during cooking to remove the alcohol? If so, has it altered the final taste?

Very good and easy recipe to make. Added lime juice as suggested by another reviewer.

Excellent! I didn't have any plain vodka. I used 1/4 cup of lemon vodka, topped up with fresh squeezed orange juice to equal 1/3 of a cup. This is delicious - not at all bitter, and not overly sweet.

I prefer my old recipe with added spices for Thanksgiving day and this Cosmo recipe for the rest of the year. It is very good....a perfect match for a turkey sandwich.

Wow! This is Fabulous! I did add the juice of 1 lime while it was cooking & the zest with the vodka & triple sec because that's such an integral part of a Cosmo. This is my new favporite Cranberry Sauce & it will be the one on my table whenever we have Turkey. (And sometimes just because it's so yummy!)

Much better than canned cranberry sauce! Added a little lime zest to really give the Cosmopolitan flavor. Definitely wouldn't reduce the alcohol, but perhaps, it's because I'm a bartender. This will be on the table next year for sure.

Doesn't get much simpler than this! I made exactly as written, with vodka and Cointreau. I can't necessarily say that it tastes all that different from if I had used water and orange juice or something, but why mess with success?

Delicious. A real hit at Thanksgiving dinner. I added zest from one orange and reduced vodka to about 3 tbsps. Beautiful color too.

fantastic cranberry sauce, I loved the flavors and tanginess but my husband found it to be a little to tart for his taste but after 1-2 days in the fridge it mellowed and he loves it.

This is a great recipe -- I decreased the vodka to 3 Tbs, but added the zest from half a lime during cooking for a little added kick. Perfect.

So easy and delicious. Several of my Thanksgiving guests had never tried homemade cranberry sauce before, and they were all amazed by good it was. The sauce wasn't too sweet, and the triple sec added just the right amount of orange flavor.

I made this last night to have with Thanksgiving. Very easy to make but I did make a couple of changes. Instead of adding water I took one orange, zested it and juiced it. I did not measure the juice, not sure if it was equal to 1/2 cup. I also added one cinnamon stick and removed it after it was cooled and before I added the vodka and grand marnier. For a raw relish in the food processor I chopped one bag of cranberries, one whole orange, one cup of sugar, 1/2 cup candied ginger and about 1/2 tsp. ground ginger. It's very good too and I like the crunch. It will be fun having two variations on the table.

So easy and delicious! I definitely agree with the previous posts and lessened the alcohol. I used 32 oz bag of cranberies to 1/3 of stoli organge vodka and 3 tablespoons of Grand Marnier. Been trialing cranberry recipes for the last few Thanksgivings and I think this is it!!!!

This is ridiculously easy to make and absolutely fantastic to taste. The second time, I used a very high quality raspberry vodka (natural flavors only) for a subtle fruit kick that put it over the top. I'll be serving this for every holiday from now on.

I like this recipe quite a bit, but I always add a bit of spice to it: nutmeg, cinnamon. . .anything along those lines. Great!

This was out-of the-park fantastic. Everyone raved about how fresh and lively it was. Served in large fancy martini glass on the Christmas table so it would get mixed up with the kid's cranberries. I have made my own cranberry sauce for years and years with lots of gourmet variations and this is everyone's favorite by far.

Everyone loved this, I served it in martini glasses rimmed with cosmopolitan rimming sugar. I was lucky enough to use wild cranberries that we harvested and don't plan on going back to my old recipes.

Wow, fantastic for Thanksgiving. The adults all loved these and definitely got the kick of the vodka and liqueur. I love cranberry anything, but these were especially good. And so easy which is appreciated at holiday time. Because we had kids at the table, I made regular sauce as well and differentiated by serving the cosmo cranberries in an antique brandy glass which looked beautiful.

The recipe was fairly good and many seemed to like it, but I found the taste of alcohol to be very strong and overpowering. It did not remind me of a cosmopolitan.

Better after 2 days, reduced vodka a bit. Used OJ rather than water, reduced cook time so not so mushy!

Very easy, but the flavors were not complex enough for my tastes. I added the juice of half a lime, one tablespoon of Cranberry Rasberry Cocktail frozen concentrate, orange zest.

Fabulous recipe -- it will certainly be a Thanksgiving tradition for the grownups in our family. Inspired by my favorite cranberry martini, I used Citroen vodka for this recipe -- I definitely recommend it.

This creates a delicious cranberry sauce with a slight twist! I used a few extra cranberries (the organic berries came in 2 9 oz packages) so added extra water and sugar. I cut back on the vodka to a bit less than 1/3 cup but used the full 3 tbsp of Cointreau. Even with less vodka the taste is still strong. Start out small - you can always add more! Make this ahead of time so it has time to gel and the berries can absorb the flavor.
