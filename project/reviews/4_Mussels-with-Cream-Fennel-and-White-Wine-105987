I make it every year for our Christmas party and every year before the Christmas party I am reminded by the staff that I have to make "the soup.P

Have tried many different mussel recipes and this one was very popular with my partner. I used half-and-half since that's all I had and used the same amount of sauce for two of us that is called for to serve four. Came out great. Must recommend!

This is the first time I have cooked mussels. It is such an easy and tasty dish. I took the comments of other cooks and but used only 1/2 tsp of pepper flakes, which I found added enough heat. My husband loved it - will definitely make again

OMG! For years I've been making mussels with thyme, white wine, garlic, and cream, but this fennel recipe is waaaay more interesting and really yummy.

Great recipe. For greater depth of flavor I added chorizo when cooking the shallots and fennel.

Made this as a main course for two. I left out the fennel seeds and added red chili flakes as suggested by other reviewers. The butter and cream provided a delicious richness. A grind of fresh black pepper added another dimension to the dish as well.

I left off the fennel seeds as the fennel I had was very flavorful and I didn't want to overwhelm. I boiled down the wine a bit in advance to save time. The 3rd time I made it I added saffron towards the very end. Fabulous

I thought it was very good but the rest of my family found the amount of anise/fennel flavor to be a bit much. Next time I'll cut back on both the fresh fennel and seeds and increase the garlic and the butter(3/4 stick perhaps). I also took the suggestions of adding some red pepper flakes and fresh parsley at the end that I'll keep. I also didn't reduce the wine cream mixture quite enough so the end sauce was a bit too thin. It's definitely a keeper base recipe though and I'll look up the roasted garlic cheese toasts for next time (yes we do love garlic!!)

First time out with this recipe and a "hit". Outstanding first course for anyone who likes mussels and fennel. It's a keeper in my kitchen.

This dish was great- and very simple to make! Make sure you have plenty of bread to soak up the broth!

Very good -- I added 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes and followed the earlier recommendations of using 1 cup dry white wine coupled with 1/2 cup of clam juice. I garnished with chopped tomato and Italian parsley. Try it -- you won't go wrong!

Very good, very easy. I have made twice now, exactly as described the first time, and with a splash of pernod the second time for a bit of extra anise (note - be careful how you describe this to the guests, with the wrong pronunciation it can be off-putting).

Very good -- would definately make again!!

Awesome and easy. I have made this several times as main course and first course. Doesn't hurt to improvise with this one. I have added one finely diced plum tomato for color and threw in some thyme sprigs. I use 1 cup white wine and 1/2 cup of clam juice. Results are beyond compare. You'll get raves for very little effort on this one.

Loved this recipe! My boyfriend isn't wild about mussels, but went nuts over this one. I did add chopped tomatoes and parsley at the end. This is very easy and could impress anyone.

Ok, I admit I altered this a bit. I used only 2 lbs of mussels (as a main dish for two) and I used more fennel than called for. I also cut the butter to 1/4 stick and subbed low-fat milk for cream. The result was still quite good. Since we were having it as a main, the cream and extra butter seemed too rich. I served it with a baguette and a Belgian ale. Very good combination.

Uh - many grocery stores label fennel "anise" or "sweet anise" - I know mine did. If you find something that looks like fennel (white bulb, green fronds) but is labelled anise, go for it. The epicurious food dictionary confirms this.

WOW! I adore mussels and have eaten them in countless recipes but this is my favourite. As suggested below I added a bit of extra fennel and ground it for extra flavour. I also added some julienned red bell peppers for colour. Just EXCELLENT!

This is super and very easy to make. Not too much fennel for the average person and I think it could use a little bit more fennel seeds. I'll grind the seeds next time too, maybe that will help kick it up. The sauce comes out very thin because of the liquid the mussels give off, but it is wonderful. Make sure you have lots of crusty bread on hand. I made the roasted garlic crusts that are recommend. They were wonderful too, but I thought the two were too strong individually to compliment each other very well. BTW, I wouldn't recomend trying to use anise. If you can't find fennel I'd suggest you make something else instead of trying to make this recipe work.
