We ate this as a dinner with a warm spinach salad on the side. Instead of truffled butter, I buttered the toast (Italian bread) and then brushed it with truffle oil, which worked well. The textures are wonderful and the egg makes it taste nice and rich. A pretty quick recipe!

I agree--this is excellent, and my husband and I eat it for dinner or a celebratory lunch. We've used truffle butter and truffle-infused oil-- either works.

This is a wonderful way to start your day. Amazing combination of flavors but not too rich. Definitely do not skip the vinegar in the water for the poached eggs...works beautifully and the eggs look spectacular. This would make a wonderful holiday breakfast dish that's elegant but not too time consuming. Would absolutely make again.
