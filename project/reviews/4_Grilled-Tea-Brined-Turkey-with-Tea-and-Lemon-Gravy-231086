Usually I do the cider brined turkey from epicurious but this year hubby wanted something different. We decided to give this one a go and WOW! This may now be our go to recipe. It helped bring out the best in our "frou frou hippie turkey" as my husband calls the turkey I get from the farmers market. I was afraid the lemon would be overpowering but it was quite subtle. The tea also helped give the bird that picture perfect brown color. Even my MIL enjoyed it! We only brined for 24 hours and used half the brine since it was a 14-pound bird. For commenters saying it was too salty, make sure you're not using table salt, that your turkey isn't prebrined, and that when using a smaller bird you brine for less time. My biggest complaint about brine recipes on this website is they don't give you the weight of salt to use, which is much more accurate than cup measurement!

Best turkey recipe ever.

Best. Turkey. Ever! I had a 12 lb bird so I cut all the brining ingredients by about half. I also roasted it in the oven (30mins at 475, 2.5 hrs at 350) & even though I think I could have taken it out about 30 mins earlier than I did, everything was just perfect. The skin was crisp & lemony & all the meat was amazingly moist. By far the best Thanksgiving turkey I've ever had! Question for those whose bird came out too salty - did you use Kosher salt or regular table salt?

I'm so disappointed! The brine was so overpowering -- made my turkey taste like ham - salty/cured. Albeit, it was very moist. The best I can say is that I enjoyed the smell of tea and lemon while I was brewing the brine. I only make turkey once a year and this was a waste of 2009.

Logged on to thank NC Chef from Raleigh for that persuasive review - I've been telling everybody "This reviewer on epicurious said people have been calling her house..." :) Did two roasting hens in 1/2 the brine recipe and it was a HUGE hit. People will probably be calling my house next year. And thanks for saying not to bother with the gravy - I didn't.

I love brine and I love TEA! I wanted the brine more spicey so I added: whole allspice, whole cardamon, whole clove, whole peppercorn, and orange peel with a clementine, and fresh fennel fronds. I also used decaf tea to avoid adding caffeine. Been using brine for many years, and it does make a difference. I can't wait for the results!

I love brine and more importantly, I love TEA! I wanted it spicey too, for that ying yang, so, I also added the following to the brine: whole allspice, whole clove, whole cardamon, whole peppercorn in small amounts, orange peel, a fresh clementine,and fresh fennel fronds.I can't wait for this!

This turkey is simply outstanding. I have grilled and brined my turkey for the last 3 years and this is without question the best! Everyone at my table last year stated it to be the most moist and flavorful bird ever. I won't make the gravy again as it was just so-so. To answer A Cook, no the turkey does not taste smoked at all.

I have a question not a review- I was ready to make this Turkey when I read reviews that it had a smoked flavor. I have a gas grill but do not like smoked turkey. Can somebody comment on whether it tasted smoked or not? Thanks

I LOVE this recipe, so delicious. Sometimes I use this one too, pretty similar: http://www.life123.com/food/cooking-tips/brine/turkey-tea-brine-for-moist-turkey.shtml

This recipe is truly exceptional - my boyfriend and I have made it numerous times, and it is always fabulous. We often cut the brine recipe by 1/3 to make a large roast chicken instead of a turkey. I typically add 1/4 cup each, dried minced onions and granulated garlic to the brine recipe. We find that brining for as close as possible to 48 hours works best. We have not tried the tea-and-lemon gravy.

I'm not a huge turkey fan, and always wonder why Thanksgiving revolves around it. WHY? But I tried this recipe, and it was delicious. Easy to make, moist, flavorful... delicious. My family thought I was crazy for not flipping the turkey while it was on the grill, but 1) Flipping a 12-pound turkey is a little different than flipping burgers and 2) As long as you maintain the heat at 350 and don't open the grill every 30 seconds to check on it, it cooks through just fine.

PLEASE TRY THIS TURKEY. I have rated this recipe before, but have to say that I am getting calls from people who will be coming to my house for Thanksgiving again this year and they all want to make sure this turkey is on the menu. We have such a huge crowd every year that I always make two turkeys, and every year, this one wins. It is fabulous. I know the list of ingredients is off putting, and frankly I wouldn't bother which the gravy at all, but if you just make the bird as directed, you will not be disappointed. Also, if you are oven challenged (one oven), using this grilled recipe gives you much more flexibility in the kitchen.

I love brining but never tried with tea. Boy, this was great and I can't wait for the holidays this year. One suggestion about the amount of salt. Add kosher or sea salt to a brine a little at a time while stirring with a raw (in the shell) egg in the bowl. When the egg begins to float and just breaks the surface, you have an adequate amount of salt. That is usually about 3/4 cup of salt per gallon. No matter how much water you use, the egg will indicate perfection, eliminating that "too salty" situation for most people.

This was the second Thanksgiving we made this fabulous turkey. The first was two years ago. Both times it cooked a little faster than we expected, but I believe that's just a grill difference. The wing tips get dried out, but that doesn't matter. The interior meat is tender, moist, and delicious, and the turkey comes off the grill looking beautiful enough for a portrait!

We have been brining our turkey for the last few years. I started with the honey brine recipe,but found it a little too complicated.Have been following Alton Brown's hilarious instructions faithfully for the last 4 years and loved the way he broke things down and used an ice chest to simplify things. But now (sorry Alton) I have a new favorite recipe! I loved the mess-free way of brining the turkey in the oven bags (much cheaper than the ones they sell at cooking stores), and then putting it in a cooler chest. The tea brine is delicious! we loved the flavors and the gravy was great!

My daughter-in-law made this today, and it was the best turkey I've ever had!! Had to join to get this recipe.

FANTASTIC! This was the first time I tried brining and this was definitely more moist than usual. Made a smaller turkey so cut back accordingly and took the advise of others and cut back on the salt a bit. We had just completed our new built in bbq so we tried out the rotisserie. Aside from the initial mistake of using the rotisserie setting that was a little too far away from the heat source for our size turkey, a beautifully browned, moist and delicious turkey that I plan on repeating next year!!

This was THE BEST TURKEY I HAVE EVER HAD! Seriously, I made it for Thanksgiving and family is still talking about it at Christmas. I think what made it great was the brining. A previous reviewer said the brine was a little salty so I reduced that a bit, and you could still taste the salt but in a good way. I used a gas grill per the instructions and it was cooked absolutely perfect, juicy and flavorful. I am one to try new recipes every holiday, but I will definately make this turkey again next year.

I make the turkey every year. This is the best I have ever made. I did not grill it. I baked it at 325 upside down for 2 1/2 hours and then the rest of the time upright. It was not my prettiest turkey, but we carved before serving and no one knew any different. Did not use the gravy recipe.

We made this turkey along with the Apricot Glazed one also found on epicurious.com, and this turkey won hands down. Boy, was it a hit! The turkey turned out beautifully -- the most gorgeous color -- and the tea and lemon brine were magic together. However, I'd forego the gravy recommended with this; it was too creamy and not in any way Thanksgiving-y.

I made this last year for my family, who traditionally don't have turkey for Thanksgiving, or any family gathering, (we're Chinese-American) and they all loved it! They requested it again this year! I baked instead of grilled and used other types of tea since none of us are Earl Grey fans, and it still comes out well. I didn't brine long enough this year and it did seem to affect the juiciness of the turkey; definitely brine for at least 24 hours. Now I'm the designated Thanksgiving cook!

Baked the turkey instead of grilling, and didn't include diced giblets in the gravy. Also deglazed the roasting pan for added flavor in the gravy. Turkey was too salty, though very moist and flavorful - would cut the amount of salt in the brining solution by half. Gravy was excellent with the added flavor of the drippings, and velvety.

to A Cook from Utrecht on 12/15/04, bbq-ing outside in the cold is just fine as long as you don't minding popping out for a couple of minutes every once in a while to check on things. I've bbq'ed sub-freezing weather plenty of times and even in snow.

This was the best turkey I've made and a few guests commented that it was the most flavourful turkey they'd had. I roasted it in the oven, like many others. I also substituted xylitol for the brown sugar in order to accommodate my Atkin's-dieting boyfriend. It seemed to brine just fine nonetheless. The colour of the bird is impressive, the skin being bronzed by the tea.

I believe this will now be my standard roast turkey recipe. Very tender - even the breast! My husband and guests raved. (I did wimp out and roast in the oven but it was still absolutely delicious.)

Wow, I have brined before, but this turkey is sublime. What a treat to have the oven free. We used a gas grill and rigged an oven thermometer up inside to regulate the temperature. My guests swore they could smell the bird as they came in the driveway. The lemon tea flavor really added to the bird and the gravy was amazing and quite easy to prepare. Can't wait to make this one again.

My husband and I always brine our turkeys for the added moistness, subtle flavors and reduction of bacteria. This recipe was great! We added our own touches to the brine, including black pepper corns & whole allspice berries (1T of each). We also used a 11.5 lb bird and grilled it on a gas grill outdoors. Awesome! The "Tea & Lemon Gravy" was also very, very good.

Question: this recipe looks really interesting, and seems like a great idea for a new year's even feast. Do you experienced Turkey-briners think the BBQ-ing will work, even if it's very cold or freezing outside? We don't have a garage to BBQ in. Do you think otherwise I could maybe BBQ it for half the time to get the BBQ-flvor and then finish cooking the bird in the oven? Thanks in advance for all tips and ideas!

What did I miss here? Honestly, I didn't notice any improvement/change in flavor, even though I used more teabags than called for on a smaller turkey. My guests, foodies all, didn't think it was that great, either. The brine, however, smelled wonderful. Next year, we go back to our old recipe.

Every year we grill the turkey and always brine. This is one of the best recipes yet. It was awesome!

Fantastic - the sweet tea flavor carried over to the smoked turkey. I have grilled over 10 T-Day birds and this was by far the best. I was concerned about the meat drying out so I did use some bacon fat to baste the bird while it was cooking. I can now turn my focus to the perfect stuffing to complement this perfect turkey.

I used an 11 lb turkey, half the brine, and smoked the turkey for about 18 hours at 200 to 220, using the brine as the initial liquid in the water basin and basting with tea. We also injected beer and olive oil. The result was moist and delicious.

This was absolutely terrific! Unfortunately it didn't fit on the grill so I roasted it but it was so good. On the upside I was able to make gravy from the pan dippings and I even stuffed it. This brine isn't nearly as salty as a lot of others so the stuffing and gravy weren't too salty. Everybody raved and wanted the recipe.

This was fantastically moist and delicious! We used a 6 lb. free range fresh turkey from France and cooked it for 1 1/2 hours on the grill. We usually use the Honey Brined recipe, but since it was only the two of us this year, we decided to experiment and we were pleasantly surprised! The flavor is very tea-smoked and lemony. We'll definitely make this next year and the years to come.
