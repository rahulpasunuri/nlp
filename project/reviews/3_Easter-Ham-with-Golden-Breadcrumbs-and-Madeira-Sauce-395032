Excellent easy recipe. I substituted syrah for the madeira and cut out the first two baking segments as i was starting with a fully cooked small ham- simply glazed and baked until 145 then added more glaze and breadcrumbs and proceeded with recipe...really pairs well with the dried plum stuffing featured in the same issue from April 2012.

This was recipe was amazing. Did not strain sauce. Covered roasting pan with foil - placed loosely over ham leaving ends open. Delicious. Buy a good ham.

I generall do not like ham, but made this recipe for my ham loving family on Easter. I was very impressed with how easy the dish is and how tasty it turned out! Everyone loved the ham!

My family really enjoyed this recipe. The glaze, though simple, went over really well. I did, however, have trouble getting the bread crumbs to stick and I question if they were necessary at all. The Madeira sauce was very tasty and complemented the meat nicely.

I wasn't impressed with this recipe. while ham is hard to mess up, this recipe did not add anything to it. Breadcrumbs seemed pointless, Madeira sauce fell short. I won't make this again.
