I first made this recipe many years ago, and it's definitely worth the effort. Holds up very well in the freezer!

I've served these for dessert on Christmas several times. Even when guests say they are too full for dessert, they enjoy these airy parfaits. They're pretty and just the right texture/taste/size to complement a big meal.
