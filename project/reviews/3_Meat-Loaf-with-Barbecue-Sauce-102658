Ok. Too sweet. Very moist, almost "mushy" Wouldn't make again.

My family loved this meat loaf. Even my picky 10 yr. old. Like other I cut the barbecue sauce to 1/4 cup and used only 1 egg. I also added 2 gloves minced garlic, 1 tsp. Smokey Mesquite Seasoning, and a good spicy barbecue sauce. Will make this again.

I was so surprised to read that people did not like this recipe. I did not find it plain or soggy in fact it is our meatloaf staple. The BBQ sauce makes it sweet. I use Hoboken Eddie's BBQ sauce. Delish!

This is bad. I would suggest simply omitting the bbq sauce in the loaf, merely topping it with the 1/2 cup bbq sauce. This would at least alleviate the sogginess, which seems most agree on. Alternatively, one could slather a topping of mashed potatoes on top 1/2 way through baking, which would temper the overpowering bbq flavour.

Bland, runny and not a hit at the dinner table. Too many other wonderful tasty recipes to bother with this one.

Runny, bland and not a hit at my table. We all had two bites and went for the salad. Will not make it again. Too mny other great dishes out there to bother with this one.

I've made this dish dozens of times and it's a big hit. The trick is to use a v. good BBQ sauce and not too much. Maybe 1/2-3/4 cup in the recipe (until not too dry) and then just enough to cover the top. We stick to Daddy Sam's original sauce from Texas. Very tasty. And 90/10 beef is fine and little less heavy.

This meatloaf is awesome! It is the only one I make now. I use half ground pork with the ground beef, and I add a little cayenne pepper and oregano for an extra kick. Everyone loves it!!

Rating: 1
The mixture looked too liquid-y when combined & after baking the loaf fell apart when sliced. If I try making it again I'll use less BBQ sauce & perhaps only one egg.

If you love BBQ sauce, you will LOVE this meatloaf!!! I followed the recipe exactly and was pleased with the results. Can't wait for those sandwiches tomorrow!! yum

I made this for my boyfriend and he loves it. I followed the other reviews and cut down on BBQ sauce, leaving a nice consistency. I used Bone Suckin Sauce thicker style which is a personal favorite. I also added some shredded sharp cheddar into the meatloaf and chopped jalepeno peppers. They added a nice contrast to the sweeter sauce. **Also, If you place the meatloaf on slices of bread, they bread help draw out access moisture, and it wont be too runny. I do this whenever I'm adding a sauce or cheese to the meatloaf.

I've never had meatloaf before and found this to be very tasty. I added 1 minced clove of garlic, added the extra egg and used day-old cut up bagette. Also think the BBQ sauces I used that had brown sugar and honey in them added sweetness which was a great addition. My husband gave big compliments so will definitely add this to our family meals.

We use Progresso bread crumbs and dried parsley and leave out the onion. We use Charlie Beigg's Maine Apple Barbecue Sauce from Whole Foods. I cook this once every two weeks and freeze it in 2 parts. (It takes 5 minutes to prepare and then I bake it while I'm making the current night's dinner.)

We found this meatloaf to have an awful consistency--very soft and mushy. The BBQ sauce overwhelmed the flavor everything else. Will not make again.

Rating: 3
Great flavor. Super easy. Followed recipe exactly. Consistency was very mush! Next time will try an extra egg and cut the bread crumbs down.

SUPER easy and yummy.

This dish was soooooo tasty, I would make it again & again. We really enjoyed it, I think I would add one extra egg next time because my meat loaft fell apart a little.

AWESOME. Followed the recipe to the tip and it came out great. Who ever thought of this is a genius.

This was great - made it just as written. It was equally good cold and reheated the next day. It also took about 2 minutes to put together. Very good use of ground beef!

Rating: 3
I followed the others lead and only used 1 cup of bread crumbs. This was good for a change from typical meatloaf and super fast to put together.

Rating: 3
This was an easy, yummy recipe. As previous reviewers suggested, I cut the breadcrumbs down to 1 c. and I used plain Contadina breacrumbs b/c that's all I had handy. I added 1 T. Worcestshire, 1 t. oregano, 1/2 t. cumin and 1/2 t. ancho chile powder for a little Tex-Mex flavor and substituted cilantro for the parsley (b/c once again, that's all I had). Oh...also rolled cheese slices in it b/c my husband insists on it (I personally prefer it without), and used KC Masterpiece sauce. I broiled it for a few minutes first to try to "sear" it b/c I used lean grassfed beef, which can get really dry if you're not careful, then I baked it per the recipe to 145 degrees. My hubby loved it--even though it had onions in it!

If you like BBQ sauce, then this recipe is a must. I did away with the fresh bread crumbs and made it with the Contadina bread crumbs.

This meat loaf had excellent flavor, but lacked a meat taste...I added half a pound of pork sausage and dressed with bacon on top...However I would recomend cutting the bread crumbs down to 3/4 cup..otherwise you get a MEAT BREAD...

Rating: 2
Adequate, certainly a reasonable way to use left over, frozen ground beef. Perhaps I'm just not the connoiseur of meatloaf the other reviews are, but this just didn't do anythign for me.

This was very tasty, but had the consistency of bread. I would cut way down on the bread crumbs next time, although it did hold together very nicely!

Who would have thought meatloaf could be such a treat?! Certainly not my husband nor my daughter who are NOT meatloaf fans. Yet, they LOVED this meatloaf. I followed the recommendations to cut down on the barbeque sauce. I used a local favorite sauce - Montgomery Inn Barbeque Sauce. I will never make meatloaf any other way and I will make it more often than twice a year. I served it with garlic mashed potatoes, steamed green beans and a salad. It was the perfect comfort food for a family winter meal. And did I mention easy......

Great Meatloaf! I used a Cherry BBQ sauce, added red peppers and cut down on the onions. I will definitely make this again and try some other BBQ sauces listed in the reviews.

Rating: 2
This was adequate but hardly anything special. Perhaps a better bbq sauce would have helped... Rather boring for meatloaf, though it did hold together well.

Sometimes the simpler the recipe is, the better it is. Too many meat loaf recipes on this site are over-complicated, but this one is just about right. I also agree that the quality of your bbq sauce makes the dish. Anything from Dinosaur BBQ in Syracuse (I like thier Wango-Tango Sauce, and they have a web site you can order from) is great, and I also like Crazy Charley's Cajun style sauce.

OK - so 4 forks is a little over the top for meat loaf - but I've got to say this is THE BEST meat loaf I've made (in 47 years of marriage). It might not be so great if I hadn't used a really good bar-b-q sauce - Dinosaur Honey-Garlic sauce. It's made locally in Central NY but is in super markets here so may be available elsewhere. Anyway - since there are just two of us, I divided it between 2 small loaf pans - worked fine in terms of volume - and froze one. Even with the smaller size - we usually have leftovers but this disappeared without a trace and my husband commented on how good it was & that he could have eaten more! I used 1 egg instead of 2 because I use so-called 'jumbo' size and it was lovely & moist.

The meat loaf was terrific. I made my own barbeque sauce. If you have M. Stewart's cookbook (teal/lime) it's the rib sauce recipe on page 181 (RibsII). I will use this recipe again.

Rating: 3
I attempted to double the recipe and used 1/2 ground turkey and half beef. I used less BBQ (1 cup) sauce as the other reviewers suggested and still ended up with a runny texture. The tasted was good, but next time I would cut back the sauce even more.

Rating: 3
I made this meat loaf using ground turkey. It was delicious. The first time I made it I used the recommended amount of barbecue sauce -- that was a mistake. A 1/2-cup works just fine and then brush some across the top to the loaf before baking. It really is delicious and you would never know you were eating turkey.

I read the reviews, so I added a bit of Quaker oats to make it less runny. It was great!

All that barbeque sauce made it so sweet. I like my meatloaf a little salty. Plus the kids did not like the sight of all those onions.

Not good. Agree with Karin, Elk Grove, CA. Did not firm up--finished like ground meat baked in the oven. Mixed flavor. Would not make again.

This is a great recipe for a busy mom trying to feed a hungry family fast- you can easily cook it even if you have a hungry toddler trying to climb up your legs while you stand at the kitchen counter. I didn't think I was going to like this recipe, because I'm not a big barbecue flavor fan, but I made it because of the high recommendations. I'm really glad that I did, because both my husband and my 13-month old baby boy just love it. I've made it twice, and plan to make it again. I agree with the other reviewers that about 3/4 cup of sauce is plenty, with a couple of tablespoons for the top of the loaf. Make sure that you buy or make really good barbecue sauce, because the flavor really comes through. The second time I made it, I added in a little finely diced celery, red peppers and carrots, and we liked it even better.

This was really good! I used meat loaf mix (half ground beef, half ground pork, about 1 1/3 lbs. meat total), dried parsley because I didn't have fresh, and homemade barbecue sauce. I added the barbecue sauce last of all and didn't even measure, just kept working it in until the mixture was the right consistency. My two-year-old ate two large slices of this meat loaf for dinner tonight.

I wish I had read the reviews before I made this--my meatloaf, too, was runny. Next time I'll cut down on the sauce--though it sure did taste good!

This is the best meatloaf that I have ever had in my life. The usual meatloaf that I have had is bland. This meatloaf is superb. I promise you that it will not disappoint.

I have always been a meatloaf fan and have tried many different recipes over the years; my husband said to throw all the other ones away after we had this one. My four year old and two year old liked it too. It's a keeper! Great with mashed potatoes and fresh green beans.

Rating: 3
This is scrumptious provided you only use half as much barbecue sauce as is called for: 3/8 of a cup in the meat mixture and 1/4 cup on top. This recipe stands or falls by the type of sauce you use, so choose wisely.

Rating: 4
I am a brand new cook, and while I know this is not a difficult recipe, it is definitely the best meal I've ever made. I made it with 2 pounds of beef, so I doubled all the ingredients but the barbecue sauce. I am also not partial to parsley, and it was not missed. It ended up having a stuffing-like flavor and it was absolutely delicious. This is now THE meatloaf in our house!

I really like the flavor of the meatloaf, but it came out too liquidy. The ingredients didn't hold together well. It just fell apart upon cutting.

Now that I am an adult, I love meatloaf and this recipe is my favorite to date. This dish needed no accompanyment such as gravy or sauce. Great leftovers. The only alteration I made is reducing the barbecue sauce by half because anymore would have made the recipe too "wet".
