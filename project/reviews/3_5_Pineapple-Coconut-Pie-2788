We really enjoyed this pie for Thanksgiving! One comment was "Decadent!" I will be making it again for the rest of the pineapple lovers in my life. I used a frozen pie crust, very easy. The only thing I might change would be to make the pineapple pieces smaller. It would make the pie easier to cut for serving, as well as eating. Overall, a fresh & delicious pie that was simple to put together.

Excellent pie! Everyone that tasted it, loved it! I do like coconut, so next time I would use more.

This is a delicious pie and I always make it with pecans instead of macadamia nuts ( although macadamia nuts is a liitle more fitting with the theme, I just enjoy pecans) This pie is so buttery and flaky, its great for when guests come over. One can even roll the pie crusts flat, substitute chocolate chips for the pineapple, and bake it like bars for children. Great recipe for all

this pie underwhelmed me--i felt it was kind of bland (i think i prefer pineapple unaltered & therefore tart). that said, the flavors mixed nicely together, and it's a good, unusual-looking winter pie. using walnuts worked for the other reviewers, but the macadamia i used really tied the pie together--what grows together goes together!

We just came back from Hawaii Honeymoon with fresh pineapples. Used one for this recipe. Awesome! It's like a coconut custard pie with a fresh lift! Made it twice it was so good. I used frozen piecrust,defrosted. Macadamia nuts are a nice mild crunch. Will be making this again and again!

This was so easy and delicious! My boyfreind really liked it. I thought I could skip a step by buying crushed pineapple but i think it caused the pie to be a little dry. Next time I'll use chunks.

Not having any macadamia nuts in my larder, I substituted walnuts, and was very pleased with the results. The pie is not too sweet, is very pretty and the one crust feature was nice with such an attractive topping.
