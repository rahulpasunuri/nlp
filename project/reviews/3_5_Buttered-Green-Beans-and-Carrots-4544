I must have had too thick a bean and cut the carrots too wide because the veggies too hard. I don't know how small you have to cut the carrots to just cook for one minute.

I served this for Christmas dinner and it was as festive as it was delicious. I added fresh chervil from my garden.

We truly enjoyed this side. We served it with the butternut squash and red pepper casserole and the garlic rosemary marinated lamb chops. My whole family enjoyed the meal. The fact that you can make it ahead is a added bonus

Excellent--made with Christmas dinner and was enjoyed by everyone. A recipe that is so easy and simple is one to keep. The six-minute cooking for the green beans was perfect and one-minute for carrots was perfect too. The cold water "bath" preserved the crispness, color, and taste.

This looks so pretty...but I thoughtthe carrots could have cooked a bit longer. They were a tad too crisp for my tastes....however the beans were perfect. I too, added the garlic and almonds. This dish is particularly nice in its simplicity when you have an elaborate main dish.

I got compliments on the presentation, but I think I'll use a little garlic next time for added flavor.

Piece of cake. Easy, looks nice, fast, lots of room for variation. I'll happily make it again.

Very good, and for a variation, saute minced garlic just prior to adding the blanched vegetables, and toss in some toasted almonds at the end.

A fast, easy, and tasty side dish. I like making this with french green beans. It's great for make ahead dinners, and it looks pretty on the plate too.

A quick and easy side dish that added alot of color to the table. When you have your hands full with the main dish this one is a no brainer.

This was clearly a utility dish with no outstanding advantages other than ease and color. To flavor it up, I grated 1/2 chicken boullion cube over it after placed in a serving bowl. It helped.

Has great texture, color and flavor. Even warmed over it still was crisp. Gives a very fresh-like presentation. Will make again!
