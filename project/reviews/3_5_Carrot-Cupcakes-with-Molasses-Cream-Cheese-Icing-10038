Cupcakes were very good, but I did not care for the icing at all. I will make the cupcakes again, but will ice with a cream cheese frosting with more sugar - this icing was pure fat.

Lovely. The only changes I made were to grind the toasted nuts in the food processor, substitute 2/3 of the flour with wheat flour, and add 1/4 cup of carrots to balance the lost moisture with the addition of the wheat flour.

i made these cupcakes for the second time today- they cupcakes are delicious. it's definitely worth taking the time to toast the walnuts and coconut flakes, and i like to use whole wheat flour also. i don't like this frosting at all, i make the creamy vanilla frosting from the red velvet cupcake recipe on this website, which works great with the cupcakes' flavor.

I could eat these every day! The only changes I do make are to add raisins (even though my husband hates raisins) and I use a different icing. Ginger cream cheese - less butter, approx 1 tsp ground ginger, and 1 tblsp finely chopped crytallized ginger. Totally yumminess!

I make these as muffins for my toddler, who adores them. I have made the recipe as written, but have altered it since. I like to use 1 C whole wheat flour in place of one cup of the white flour--you can't even tell, due to the other ingredients. I also up the carrots to 2 C, and I grind up the nuts finely before adding (just to prevent any choking hazard for my little one). Also, I like to use virgin coconut oil for the oil, and a mixture of honey, blackstrap molasses and maple syrup in place of the sugar. Just to add more calcium, iron, and magnesium to the muffin. Anyway, they are quite high in calories, but chock full of nutrients--perfect for skinny picky kids!

Delicious! Moist and yummy. Take the time to toast the nuts! I did not and wish I had. I liked the subtle molasses flavor in the icing but thought maybe next time i would try maple syrup instead. I am definitely adding this receipe to my repertoire!

I made these for my roommate for his birthday, and everyone who ate one said they were delicious. One of his friends even swiped all of the remaining frosting I had left in the fridge (I only frosted them as they were eaten) and by morning it was all gone. I will definitely make these again. Oh, and I used pecans instead of walnuts only because of personal preference.

My daughter had been making muffins for Thanksgiving....they were okay, but they tasted sort of bland. She looked up a recipe for cream cheese icing and glanced at this one. We were surprised at how quickly we could make the icing. The icing tasted okay.....it went pretty well with the pumpkin flavor of the muffins, but there was a little too much of molasses.

I actally followed the recipe closely and it was wonderful. Raisins would be good. The icing was delicious, but without it, these would pass for muffins as well.

Wonderful: fragrant, moist, flavorful and just delicious. We could hardly wait for the icing ... these are so good we ate them practically right out of the oven. I am not one to fiddle around with someone else's recipe until i've followed it at least once to the letter -- but this was emergency baking so i made do with pecans instead of walnuts and a handful of golden raisins thrown in for good measure. Even the "I hate coconut" crowd is clammoring for more!

Major wows. I will now use this space to thank the deities that be for bringing the microplane down to humans. Carrot cake with sweet, delicious taste of carrots but not a one stuck between your teeth afterwards? yes! The recipe was super tasty. I used two cups of carrots, added a 1/2 tsp. of ground ginger to the batter, as well as a whole tsp. to the frosting. Keep the molasses! It adds a great layer of depth to the taste of the cupcake as a whole. I doubled the frosting recipe because I work at a bakery and couldn't dream of meandering away from our time tested cake-to-frosting ratio. Used all the frosting, made 18 cupcakes exactly. I will make this again. My boyfriend ate three in a row.

As someone who is relatively new to cooking and baking, I found this recipe accessible, fairly quick, and quite satisfying! I loved the flavor of the cupcakes (I also added raisins and punched up the spices a touch). I overcooked one batch so they were drier, but the second batch had a nice consistency. I would definitely make this recipe again, making sure to make a larger cupcake and to bake for slightly less time to keep them moist.

Great cupcake recipe (earned RAVE reviews at the office), but I didn't care for the frosting. Replaced with a traditional cream cheese/lemon juice/powdered sugar frosting, which worked fine.

moist and spicy. i guess that's a pretty racy desciption for carrot cupcakes, but you know those wild root vegetables... i used a micoplane grater on the carrots- i don't know if that was what the recipe intended by "finely grated" but it worked real well. ppl liked that the carrot texture wasn't all up in your face. i used raisins soaked in rum instead of coconut. i didn't make the frosting- instead i made regular cream cheese frosting, just cream cheese, vanilla and powdered sugar until it tastes like frosting. that whole half butter thing seems weird. oh, these also took longer than the stated time, even though my oven runs really hot.

We left out the coconut and added drained crushed pineapple and raisins. Did not add molasses to icing. Very moist and delicious. Enjoyed every morsel.

When I was about 13 weeks pregnant, I got a craving for carrot cake and found this recipe. I've made it many times since (I'm due in two weeks), including on Christmas morning. I usually make them as muffins with no icing, with this recipe yielding 12 (I bake for 20 minutes). Also, I never have used coconut. I add about 1/2 cup of golden raisins instead. So simple and utterly addicting.

Great consistency, easy to make and delicious. I got a lower yield than the recipe stated, but they were still very good. Instead of molasses in the icing, I used 2 tbls dark RUM and 1-2 tbls of maple syrup. Mmmm

I thought these were terrific. Only thing I changed was to half the molasses. Sprinkled coconut on top. Big hit!

I forgot to toast the walnuts and coconut, but it didn't seem to make a huge difference. These were moist, with just the right amount of spice. The icing was a little on the not-sweet-enough side, so I added a little more sugar. Problem solved. Yum!

they were very nice... but too much textures....

Wow, I made these as mini-cupcakes and they were a huge hit at a couples shower. I used a butter/cream cheese frosting, really terrific!

These cupcakes / muffins are delicious - made them just as the recipe calls for, except for the icing and loved them. Remember to spoon flour into your measuring cups and then level (rather than dip and level) as this is the standard Gourmet protocol - and can be the difference between dry and moist muffins!

I thought the cupcakes were okay, but a bit dry. The icing was way too buttery and not sweet enough. The thought of it makes me quesy.

Made these cupcakes for Easter dessert, and they were wonderful. Some guests had 3 or 4! You can't make too many!

A grown-up cupcake, if there's such a thing. I didn't make the icing, because I already had some cream cheese frosting I wanted to use. I only used 1/2 cup of oil, and added half a can of crushed pineapple and 1/2 cup of raisins instead of the nuts and coconut. Very yummy.

Delicious and moist - both kids and adults loved them (kids minus the icing and walnuts and with gobs of Thompson raisins added.) Great without the icing, also, and wonderful as an addition to Sunday breakfast.

Luscious, moist, just sweet enough - perfect. I made these for my one-year old's daycare birthday party (substituting raisins for the nuts & coconut, and using mini muffin tins & liners). She loved them, and my 4 year old couldn't get enough. The molasses icing is delectable and a perfect complement. I'm already planning when to make them again.

These are delicious, super moist and nicely spiced. The coconut and walnuts give a nice crunch. Careful about adding too much molasses. When I make them again, i will increase the cream cheese to butter ratio in the icing.

Cupcakes were incredibly moist and very flavourful.

Easy to make - and really moist and delicious. I wanted extra molasses in the icing, but then only iced half of them - the rest we ate for breakfast! These will become a family tradition
