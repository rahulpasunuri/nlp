I served it over quinoa and substituted fresh green beans for artichokes. Very good.

absolutly agree with Cook from Vancouver. It was terrible, I will not make this again.

Am I missing something? Against my better judgement I left the skin on the chicken. It never browned even though I cooked it at the recommended temp and time. The sauce was very greasy what with the olive oil from the marinade and added chicken grease. Tried straining off the chicken grease from the drippings but still resulted in a greasy flavour. I wouldn't make this again. Not worth the time and effort.

Great dish - it creates juicy, tender chicken and artichokes. A wonderful recipe for a fall evening!

Served this to family on my husband's side -- mother-in-law, father-in-law, aunt, uncle, cousin -- the first time we had them to our home for dinner. It was the first time I made it, and it went over well. I liked that it's just fancy enough for company yet not fussy. The best part was I had everything ready to go ahead of time. When people arrived I put the food in the oven and spent time talking rather than in the kitchen. No stress, no fuss, no one watching over my shoulder. :-) My junior high school-aged cousin didn't care for the artichoke hearts and found them "weird." More for the adults. Alterations: used canned, not fresh, artichokes. Used boneless chicken breasts and reduced cooking time accordingly.

This recipe is so similar to one my Greek mother and grandmother made that I needed to try it. It's wonderful! And the dill makes the sauce. I agree the amount of sauce/marinade needs to be doubled, and also agree that using frozen or canned artichokes is fine and far less trouble (the only alteration I made to the recipe). This is a dish which can be prepared in advance up to the sauce, which can be made just prior to serving. Gently reheat the chicken and artichokes. We served this to three neighborhood couples, and they all loved it, even Mr. Meat-and-Potatoes-Picky-Eater!

As others have said, this was delicious. I also doubled the sauce and that really made it perfect.

I really liked the flavors of this dish, but needed more marinade. I was only using one chicken, so I made half the marinade recipe. By the time I marinaded the artichokes and used some to baste the chicken (and I should have used more), there was little left for the sauce. Next time I will make the full marinade recipe. Also, trimming the artichokes took a long time, next time I would cook them in advance.

This dish turned out great. I added extra lemon juice during the basting, but didn't add more wine because I was out. In the end I wished I did. It was the first time I made artichokes and had a lot of fun with it.

This dish turned out pretty tasty for me, although it seems that many other people had problems. It was more time consuming that I thought it would be but the results were good. The sauce was very tasty but rich - I wish there was a little more of it too. The chicken was flavorful and very tender - I used only breast meat with bone in and cooked it for a bit longer than 45 min. This was my first time cooking artichokes and thay turned out pretty tasty too.

We loved the sauce, but not the dish as a whole. My family all said they'd rather have eaten the artichokes steamed as an appetizer! Time consuming. I won't make it again, but my advice is to use the canned or frozen artichokes.

My sister made this recipe with bone-in chicken breasts and it was outstanding. I immediately requested the recipe. She made it with canned artichoke hearts instead of fresh, which made it easier and quite tasty. It was easy and sooo good.

One of the worst Bon Ap recipes! Not worth the trouble!!!!!

I really enjoyed this dish when I made it, but I agree that it was time consuming. I used chicken pieces - thighs and legs- instead of whole chickens. I would do this again, however, I would not used fresh artichokes next time. While I love arichokes, I hate preparing fresh ones. Also, the fresh artichokes didn't add much to the dish considering all the effort involved. I'll try to find frozen artichoke hearts next time. Without that step, the process should go alot faster. The dish was flavorful and went well with the orzo.

UGHHH! My effort turned out really terrible. I used skinless chicken legs instead of the skin on that was called for (to cut out some fat...), but the end result was too lemony and the sauce (while perfectly formed) was way too overpowering for the chicken. Also, even with extensive preparation (mis en place) this was a very time consuming recipe. Give it a miss.

The first time I made this recipe it turned out perfect, everyone thought it was delicious. I thought I had found the perfect lemon chicken recipe. But last night I made it again and the egg yolks began cooking immediatly when added to the pan drippings and I could not get the sauce to thicken! The taste was great, but the sauce looked terrible. Also skipped the whole artichoke ordeal this time and just sauteed some asparagus with butter and garlic. Didnt miss the artichokes. Also, cut mess and cooking time down to just about an hour.

I love all the ingredients for this recipe on their own so I was truly excited to make this dish. Half way through the whole mess, I gave up. Too many steps to lead to a simple chicken dish. I wish I had read the instructions better and could have seen that this recipe was a lot of effort.

I had a few friends over for dinner. I had everything prepared the night before, so there wasn't much to do for the evening. I always make recipes exact the first time, then make any adjustment. I served this dish over the Orzos. We all loved it!!

I usually read and respect other reviewers, but on this one, the ingredients (and picture) made me so excited that I decided to go against the curve and try this dish. Don't make the same mistake. Wayyyy too much of an effort (and resulting mess in the kitchen) for something that doesn't deserve it at all. The sauce was too heavy; and came out a very unsightly brownish color. Very disappointing.

Way too much effort for the end result. There are better and easier chicken dishes out there.

I love artichokes but was disappointed with this dish. Maybe mine were past their prime. The sauce was delicious- wish there had been more of it. The chicken was nothing special- just baked chicken. Overall this was too time-consuming for the so-so results

It's fine to rate a recipe if you only make MINOR adjustments (didn't have linguini so used fettuccini, didn't have fresh oregano so used dried, etc) but PLEASE don't rate the recipe if you don't use the major ingredients! This recipe was call "lemon chicken and artichokes with DILL sauce". When you don't use DILL you are not making this recipe. If you want to write in and tell everyone how fabulous or not so fabulous your version was, by all means do so. I learn a lot from other posters. However, many of us actually use the rating system to determine our level of interest in a particular recipe. It is a big pain to have to read through all the review to see whether the rating holds up. Thank you

This is a great dish. The chicken has a wonderful taste. I also used canned artichokes. Fresh would have been better, but I often make time trade-offs. I didn't have any problems with the sauce. Just keep the heat low.

Very easy, very tasty. I ommited the dill because I was afraid it would over power the artichoke taste. I also took a short cut and used jarred artichoke hearts, rinsed.

To the cook from New York: As long as you bring the marinade to a boil, it's safe to use.

I haven't tried this recipe yet, though I'd like to. I have one concern: I've always read that once you marinate any kind of meat or poultry, you don't re-use the marinade, as this recipe calls for. Thoughts on this???

If you've ever made a hollandaise or bernaise, you know how tempermental egg yolks can be. Keep the heat for the sauce relatively low and stir in the yolks thoroughly. Keep whisking until the egg is thoroughly combined and the sauce thickens. We steamed the artichokes rather than boiling them as the recipe calls for. We then drizzled lemon juice over them to avoid the browning that plagues them like freshly cut apples. The acid prevents the discoloration. This recipe is terrific. Try it out.

Loved this recipe--with modifications: Use artichoke hearts from a jar (rinsed and drained) and dried dill. Great flavor combination. Fabulous, faster, less expensive.

Dear Bon Appetite! I have been a loyal follower for over 5 years and never had a problem following directions, until the Lemon Chicken was published. A what should have been an easy-to-follow-and-fun-to-make recipe turned into a long frustrating process. Too complicated and confusing.... Disappointed.

The combination of flavors is wonderful and such a desired achievement from the chicken dishes prepared during the winter months.

Had high hopes for this recipe but the dill seemed to over power all the other flavors. Not sure what I did wrong. I am pretty sure my measurements were right on. Did any one else feel this way?? I might try it again since I love artichokes and just make a lemon cream sauce or go back to one if my favorites-"CHICKEN WITH LEMON-BASIL SAUCE" from this site and adapt it to incorporate the artichokes.

I also haven't tried the recipe to rate it, but maybe instead of just putting the saucepan over the heat, you can try a double boiler method. Place the pan over boiling water instead, this should reduce the heat and prevent the yolks from cooking so quickly.

Rating: 3
this recipe sound very good but just an advice for the person who is suggesting to prepare the artichokes in advance a day before, you should be very careful because not freshly coocked artichokes can develop an enzyme that could give your insides a very very hard time.

Sub 1 package of hollandaise. Ba da Boom. (store bought) and skip all the fuss. Simple, easy and kids inhaled it.

I haven't tried this recipe yet, but I will soon & I think I will like it, though I may change it a little. Advice for New Orleans cook: add yolks off the heat & do not let it boil even though the recipe says to do so. The sauce doesn't contain anything to stabilize the yolks, so you have to heat it slowly. On the other hand, a little thickener such as cornstarch will ensure that the sauce will thicken.

I have issues with this recipe, but the flavor is great and I hope to resolve them. The method for cooking the artichokes is different than I use, and they turned brown when started in cold water. I've always heard that they should be put in boiling water to retain good color which I'll do next time. Also, I couldn't get the sauce smooth when I whisked in the egg yolks. Even though I whisked a little hot pan drippings into the yolks before adding to the other pan drippings, they cooked immediately and my sauce looked more like egg-fried rice. However, the flavor was wonderful, my family LOVED it, and I'll try to improve my method--anyone else have these problems? Suggestions? I recommend prepping the artichokes a day ahead--it's pretty labor-intensive otherwise.

This dish got raves from my family. I added salt to the marinade, used dried dillweed instead of fresh dill, and used sherry because I didn't have any white wine on hand. It tasted great.
