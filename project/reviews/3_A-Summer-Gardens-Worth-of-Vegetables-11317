I made this without radishes (I don't like them) and used dried herbes de Provence instead of the fresh herbs listed. Everyone loved it!!

I did not even make "this" recipe. I grow my own veggies and herbs. What I love about steaming food is the wholesomeness. It is amazing to me that someone would take fresh steamed ingredients and then cover them in oil! I steamed all vegetables together (this adds flavor) with the fresh picked herbs. My husband and I both enjoy our veggies this way.

Peas should ALSO be steamed!

Very pretty/colorful. Requires a lot of prep time, especially to peel the small onions. Use more herbs.
