Pretty good recipe, especially the pork marinade. I did add a few things though. In both the marinade and the sauce I put some coconut milk. I also added trassi (Indonesian fermented shrimp paste) and a tbs of chicken stock to the sauce to make it more authentic.

The marinade for the kebabs was delicous and I would use it again, but the sauce was so-so. I added chopped peanuts and red chili powder to give it more oomph.

This recipe was ok... but among other appetizers it wasnt a hit...

This was delicious, especially the sauce! I didn't have any brown sugar, so I omitted and it was still yummy. We actually had it as a main course with a cucumber salad and rice.

I have a lemon grass plant, so I actually followed the recipe. It is excellent. Another winner at my party. I didn't make this peanut sauce, but rather, the version from coconut, basil shrimp and from teriaki beef, chicken + shrimp. Mixed or separate, those sauces were excellent with the pork.

Delicious blend of flavors! I made this dish for company, and one of the things that I liked about it was that I could reheat the sauce without having it break. The pork could be prepared in advance as well, we just threw it on the grill later.

I made this dish for a party and everyone loved it! I added chopped cilantro and sweetened coconut flakes to the marinade to add a little flavor.

I loved this dish. I ate the whole thing all by myself. I'll have to find a use for the leftover dipping sauce - I'm thinking chicken....

I made this in 1992 when it was first published, I have made it a number of times since. I was glad to find it so readily online-since I lost the recipe! Thanks! Ground coriander works in place of the seeds. The lemon grass is hard to find- so I have used juice from 1/2 lemon. You can use this sauce with pork chops, ribs or shrimp.
