The best EVER fries that I have ever eaten in my life, and my girlfriend, who has long term restaurant and cooking expertise, agrees! The Shichimi Togarashi is CRITICAL.

This was great! Fun, easy and delicious (we love spicy).

Perhaps the best fries I ever had! Even our young children loved them despite the fact that they're a little on the spicy side. It was hard to find the schichimi togarashi, but it was worth the trouble (I eventually found it in a small Japanese grocery store.)

The first thing my husband commented on was the kick of the shimichi togarashi (a good kick). I can definitely see myself making this over and over again. In the mean time, I'm contemplating more things to put this togarashi stuff on :-)

This recipe was so great. I hate frozen fries and these were an easy and much better version. I didn't have the shichimi togarashi, but I used a salish smoked sea salt and a bit of cayenne for the pepper. I found that the time on this recipe is just about perfect, 50 minutes to delicious fries.

The pepper is in the shichimi togarashi. It is a wonderful recipe.

Any noticed there is no pepper in these "salt and pepper oven fries"? Just saying... Haven't tried them yet but they sound great.

I just realized it has been almost 2 years since this came out. I make it all the time. Russett still the best. The Asian market in Albuquerque used to carry the spice and then quit. So I went on -line and found House Schchimi Togarashi. Got 20 bottles, have ten left. Everyone loves this

First of all - nanami togarashi and shichimi togarashi should be the same. 'Nana' and 'shichi' both mean the quantity 7. Just so no one drives themselves crazy looking for nanami togarashi over shichimi... Since it's all I have at the moment, I'm using a couple of gold potatoes and a Japanese sweet potato (satsumaimo) - since the Japanese ones have a higher sugar content, they are browning & pretty! I will definitely use all russets, for their texture, or all satsumaimo next time - the golds have a lot of moisture which is steaming them before they can brown. Great starting point.

Made as directed, red potatoes cut 3/8 - 1/2 inch squares. cooked convect bake 400 on parchment lined cookie sheets, left separation for browning, for total about 40 mins. Delicious. sprinked with salt, served in parchment cones. would try tograshi, just didn't have on hand.

I made this for a dinner party as a last minute appetizer. I had purchased the shichimi online, and had no idea what to make with it - looked it up on Epicurious and found this recipe for fries. They were a huge hit, and it didn't take long for my friends to go through all of them.

We've made these at least five times now, and they're great each time. Tasty, but not overly greasy.

I loved these! The only thing was that I couldn't find the Japanese spice but McCormick's makes an Asian sea salt (sea salt, sugar, black/white sesame seeds, garlic, red pepper) which worked really well. I actually tossed them with it when I flipped at the halfway mark!

I followed the recipe exactly except I used sweet potatoes instead. They were delicious! They will definitely be a regular thing around our house. They might be a little softer than the potatoes called for in the original recipe ( I've only tried the sweet potatoes ) but we loved them!

These fries are great and such a simple recipe! I found the spice at the local asian market. The togarashi gives the fries a great spicey- kick! Definately recommend making this.

I made these without the Japanese seasoning and everyone loved them. This will be my new 'healthy' french fries for my family.

Very good recipe, if you cant find Shichimi togarashi you can buy NANAMI TOGARASHI or regular TOGARASHI, the one listed in the recipe is much harder to find and the only differenc is white sesame instead of roasted black, Which frankly I prefer. Why make it harder? You can usually buy Togarashi at a supermarket in the asian section.

Really tasty fries. I used extra shichimi togarashi because I like it spicy but the salt and sweet of the sugar makes this an exceptional twist on regular fries. I'll be making this again and again

These were just great! I made them with an Asian-inspired meal - wasabi-salmon burgers and Asian cole slaw. I think that the sugar really makes them unique! A different take on fries!
