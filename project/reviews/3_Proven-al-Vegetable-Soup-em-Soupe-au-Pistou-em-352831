We loved this soup. An excellent, hearty meal good for a chilly evening. I cooked the pasta separately so it wouldn't soak up too much of the broth, added about a cup of canned corn, used frozen green beans, and doubled the pistou recipe. It could stand up to at least double the garlic if you fancy that.

Forgot to add that the reheated soup was terrific tossed in the blender for a quick puree! Smooth and creamy!!

I didn't have leeks or celery so I added onion for a little more flavor. I also omitted the pasta for less carbs. I used garlic, carrot, thyme, green beans, zucchini, and potatoes from my own garden. I also subbed chicken stock for the water. The soup, just to that point, was pretty good. The pistou was fabulous and a big hit with everyone that tried it. I used all fresh ingredients from my garden and subbed parmesan reggiano for the Gruyere. I did add a bit too much salt since the cheese was salty enough, live and learn. It worked so well in the soup! I also served it spread on toasted baguettes with sliced tomatoes. The kids loved it! The next morning I tossed some with pasta for my son's lunch box. Yumm!

This soup was delish. We added some cannelloni beans and used chicken stock. We also used some plain yogurt on top with the pistou. Next time I'm going to drop a piece of grilled fish in the middle. Yum.

Following other reviewers' advice, I used chicken stock instead of water. I don't like swiss chard so substituted spinach and couldn't find edamame, so used petit pois. Also modified the cooking; adding the spinach and petit pois as the very end so they didn't overcook. Forgot to add the gruyere, but it was still a very tasty, healthy soup. Will definitely make again for a special occasion.

I thought this was very good. I used homemade chicken broth after reading some of the reviews that said it was kind of bland. I also added mushrooms in the step with the zucchini and substituted a marinated bean trio (garbanzos, kidneys and canellinis) for the edamame. I didn't have thyme so I used a bay leaf; and had some aged gouda that I used in place of the gruyere in the pistou. It is a very healthy spring soup that I would make again. The pistou is awesome and I'd definitely use that in pasta in the future.

After reading the reviews, I went ahead and substituted chicken stock for half of the water called for and it came out great. I substituted fresh spinach for the chard and it was just fine. I suggest adding the zucchini with the pasta so it does not get too soggy with the boiling. My husband and I ate all of this soup in a week! Fantastic! Also, the pistou (pesto) was fabulous with the bread.

The reviews are right, this is a pretty mild soup. It needed a lot of salt. I usually use less than half the salt in a recipe and then add more at the table if needed, mostly, I don't have to add any but, for this i needed to add a lot. The only other change I made was to use store bought pesto and blend it with the tomato because the basil just isn't looking that good right now. I used the edamame and we liked them.

I know its a provencal soup but jeez was it bland. It's not bad just a little too simple for my tastes. I'm hoping it improves on the second day because I've got a lot of leftovers. Served with sourdough with melted gruyere on top.

excellent the kids loved it and the pistou was great. great and hearty dish for winter.I would substiture the pasta with white beans as pasta tends to get "soggy"

I followed this recipe pretty much exactly (except I used red chard and almost doubled the leek) and the soup is wonderful, somehow hearty and delicate at the same time. As far as all the complaints it needed more this or that, or things substituted in or out: geez, let its flavor be - it's a Provençal soup, not an Italian one!

I love this soup. I like to add all of the pistou to the pot, as opposed to swirling some into each bowl, and then season the soup: it needs way more salt and pepper than the recipe would have you add. (And it's even better the next day!)

Good base for a soup, but not enough "wow" factor without some tweaking. I swapped 3 roasted chicken breasts for the edamame, and used chicken stock instead of water. Added maybe an extra 2 handfuls of the chard leaves (I had lots). I pureed a charred, seeded serrano in with the pistou. Such a nice change from the normal chicken vegetable soup. Will make again.

Really loved this - would have given it 3 1/2 stars if I could. Only changes I made: used spinach instead of chard and omitted the edamame. Probably should have stuck with the chard, it would have been a better texture than spinach. The pistou is lovely!!

We found this to be very bland, despite using additonal garlic. My families comments: too many potatoes in relation to the pasta, Edamame was not a positive addition. Boring.

If you love pasta alla genovese, you'll really enjoy this soup! Great recipe.

This recipe was a hit with my family(including my 5 and 3 year olds). I took another reviewer's advice and doubled the leeks as well as used chicken stock rather than water. There's a fair amount of prepping, but it's well worth it.

A very good soup. Fresh, earthy, and herbaceous flavors. I added more garlic and an extra half teaspoon of salt. I would not skimp on the leeks. Letting the vegetables caramelize helps to build the flavor of the broth. The pistou really brought it all together. Makes a nice healthy dinner. Took me longer than the 40 minutes to prep and cook.

After reading previous reviews I changed this up a bit and it was GREAT! I left out the leek and sauteed the carrot and celery in about 8 cloves of organic onion garlic and in addition to a thyme spring I added an oregano sprig. After the above said browned I added the potatoes and instead of swiss chard I used KALE. Before adding 8 whole cups of water I added one cup and let it simmer for about 20-30 min. I ended up adding frozen corn, doubling the zucchini and using 1/2 portion chicken stock to h2o. Orzo was substituted for shell pasta... My fiance, who does not like soup LOVED this!

Eh, not really that exciting. I did sub veggie broth for the water and used an extra leek. The pistou was great, I would make that again as a dip for bread. Hopefully the soup will taste a little more flavorful tomorrow.

not bad as is, awesome with a few modifications. doubled up on the leeks and garlic, used chicken stock instead of water, and white kidney beans instead of edamame. No leftovers, many raves. will definitely be making this again.

We did not like this soup. It takes longer to prepare than the recipe indicates and it isn't worth a fraction of that effort. My husband is usually quite accepting of vegetarian foods but he said, "this needs a ham bone"!

This soup turned out really good, but it definitely needed a little love to get there. I think if you follow the recipe exactly, it'll be rather bland. I used veggie stock instead of water. Also instead of edamame, I used a can of cannellini beans. When I tasted the soup, it seemed a bit thin and watery, so I ended up pureeing another can of cannelini beans and adding that to the stock. It had a lot more body and depth of flavor that way. I also use parmesean cheese instead of gruyere...the gruyere seemed kind of weird to me. Anyway, it was delicious, with some modifications.

I really liked this, but made it with all water as the recipe directed and cannelini beans instead of edamame. I agree that it should really have some more flavor. On day 2 I used the leftover baguette and gruyere to make a little mini grilled cheese with it, and that made it great, so instead of stock, I think it might also be nice to try more gruyere in the pistou, or just more pistou, which was delicious. More butter or even a touch of cream might also be good. These would be ways to keep that "fresh" concept while still adding flavor. But I will probably also try it with just stock some day.

With all the delicious vegetables I thought it would be tastier. It lacks something...next time I might add pancetta. I took the advice of others and used more garlic and vegetable stock in place of water, it helped. I also used a bouquet garni for a little more taste.

I was out of thyme so used tarragon instead. Also, used 1/2 vegetable stock, 1/2 water. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. The pistou makes this soup delicious.

I made this with chicken stock and it was great. I can't imagine that it would be good using water...I'd use vegetable stock at least.

I liked this. I'm not in love with it, but i'd make it again. I didn't have edamame so I threw in a can of white beans and it was very good. It gets very thick as it sits - when I reheated it today it was barely soup, but it tasted good.

Good soup, good texture, but not great because it didn't have the right kind of flavor. The pistou helps, but not enough to really make it a great soup. Worth trying again, so next time, I'll use veggie stock or chicken stock to see if that helps the flavor. And I'll use the white kidneys instead of edamame, just a personal preference.

A wonderful recipe. I love how healthy this soup is. The browned leaks gave it a great flavor and it was an excellent hearty soup for being all veggie. My husband despises vegetables, but he ate this soup. I bought all the ingredients the same day to make sure it was the freshest it could be. The pesto really makes this soup. Served it with a great wheat bread that was topped with additional gruyere.

Delicious recipe and wonderful on a balmy spring night. I made some minor changes. I increased the garlic to 2 cloves and omitted the celery and edamame (didn't have on hand). I added some red pepper flakes and a teaspoon of herbes de provence to the first step. I also used 8 cups of vegetable stock instead of water.
