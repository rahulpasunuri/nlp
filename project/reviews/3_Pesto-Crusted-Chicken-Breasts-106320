The chicken stayed tender and juicy and I didn't find a need to make the sauce with lemon juice at the end -- I just spooned the pesto mixture from the pan as its own topping. I used cashews instead of walnuts and the store-bought pesto had enough oil in it that I didn't drizzle any extra on top - turned out great even with deviations!

hadn't made these in awhile, but did tonight with some leftover homemade pesto and served them with fettuccine with asparaugs. https://fineeats.blogspot.com

for a super quick delicious recipe, this one can't be beat. I had to get together a quick dinner party for a few friends and so I used store bought pesto in place of homemade and no one noticed. Its the baking that really makes it.

Love, love, love this recipe.. I just made it for my husband and he really love it too.. it was so juicy and tasty. I used hazelnuts and it give a really nice texture.

I loved this recipe. I needed to get a meal together quickly for some surprise guests and this was perfect. Because I was pressed for time, I used store-bought pesto, but it came out great. I covered the chicken in tin-foil and that made it really moist. I paired this with fettacini w/ pesto, tomatos and chopped olives. It was ready in under and hour and every plate was cleaned and bellys full:)

A couple reviewers got it right. Too lemony, too messy. I couldn't taste the walnuts.

I made this again, using chicken this time, and I think I won't bother with it anymore. Not worth the effort and time. Also, too lemony for my taste.

I made the pesto as directed and used it on salmon instead of chicken. It was very tasty and my meat-n'-potatos-boyfriend loved it.

not bad! I almost gave it three forks for simplicity. I did like it, but wasn't wowed. Used homemade pesto, served with tomatoes concasse with leftover mashed potatoes from xmas dinner.

I made this according to the recipe but found at 30 minutes the chicken was basically raw. I ended up baking them for 50+/- minutes.

This was very good and easy for a weeknight dinner. The key here is to have the chicken breasts with the bone because that makes it juicy. Made the recipe exactly as stated and it came out perfect.

Used the recipe with boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Covered with foil and baked at 350 for 30 mins. Came out moist and delicious. Served with the carmelized onion pasta but used sun-dried tomatos vs. roasted peppers in the pasta. Combination was excellent. Very easy dinner but looked like it took hours. Will be making this again, soon.

We made our own pesto. The pesto, prior to putting it on the chicken, was really flavorful...like we like it. After cooking, the pesto was bland. Next time we will grill the chicken breasts and add the pesto after the chicken is cooked.

The dish turned out great. I ended up using mixed nuts because I did not have walnuts. (Note: wash off the salt, b/c it will make the dish too salty). I also added Parmesan cheese on top of the chicken and pesto. That was a nice touch. To keep it from being dry I added more olive oil to the mixture.

I could not find fresh Pesto, but used Di Giorno Basil and Pesto Sauce. I added the Walnuts and Lemon Peel but only half the lemon juice. This is not my normal type of cooking, but this morning my wife asked what me what we are having for dinner tonight. I guess I have a talent that is about to be cultivated.

This did not work out for me; I used boneless breasts and baked the chicken using a stone. Result, no juice and dry chicken. However, this method works well using the Parmesan Chicken Recipe on this site. Linguine was good however.

Terrific! Served this at a dinner party, didn't happen to have all the stuff for the linguine so just made a basic Alfredo sauce. The chicken was wonderful, I didn't think it was really neccessary to reduce the pan juices at the end. Served with Tomato&Mozzarella salad, linguine alfredo, red wine and tiramisu. yum!

We make this with chicken cutlets instead & bake 10-15 min. It is a crowd-pleaser! The walnuts are a great addition!

This was so easy to make and sooooo tasty. I made fresh pesto and put the chicken over cous cous instead of having pasta. My whole family loved it, even the picky 2 year old.

We had a bumper crop of basil this year and froze alot of it. This dish is super simple and brings back the glorious days of Summer on a plate.

This was just awful! I followed the recipe exactly and wound up with a huge mess in my oven (oil spattered, then smoked) and chicken with pesto sitting on top of it. Not pretty!

Rating: 4
Very good. I butterfly the chicken and fill it with the pesto mixture. I also add a little parmagiano cheese to the top and remove the foil (careful not to burn yourself!) a few minutes before the dish is finished. I served it with a medley of vegetables - orange yellow and red peppers, onions and asparagus to balance the richness...

I use boneless breasts and refrigerated pesto (cheating--I know) and it always turns out juicy and delicious! It is definately in the monthly rotation.

This time of year I have lots of basil around so I'm on the lookout for an interesting pesto dish. This dish was interesting... and delicious. The walnuts and the lemon were great additions to basic pesto. After not cooking much this summer, it was very rewarding to be back in the kitchen again. I made the linguini as well, and will definitely make them both again.

Rating: 3
So yummy! However, I don't totally follow this recipe, if all I have on had is pesto, I simply cover the chicken breasts with it (and adobo, of course) and grill it. It's tastey all the time. A good solution for just defrosted chicken (doesn't need to marinade).

Easy to do but tastes like it's from a Gourmet Kitchen. I like to complement the green pesto sauce with a tomatoe side salad for a healthy and colorful meal.

I followed the recipe and the chicken turned out very tasty. Next time I'll try it with boneless breasts or cutlets for variation. I made the caramelized onions and red pepper linguine as a side, and found the chicken and red peppers worked very well together. Yummy!

I made this with the red pepper linguini for a dinner party. It was great because it was so fast and the pasta turned out better than expected. However, overall I felt that the entire dinner was bland.

I made this with homemade pesto - and had enough to coat six chicken breasts. Turned the heat down after 15 minutes and they came out moist and delicious. Served it with a risotto that included red peppers and fresh basil - delicious!

Very easy to make. Good but not outstanding. I omitted the walnuts and marinated the chicken for 2 hours with the pesto.

I made this to go along with the caramelized onion and red pepper linguine for friends. This was great and really easy! I added the walnuts and lemon but you could leave that step out and just use the store bought pesto to make this a really quick meal.

I made mine with the boneless breasts and they seemed to turn out fine- the pesto was great- I made mine with homeade pesto from fresh basil, parmesan cheese, garlic, and olive oil and then whrilled in the walnuts and lemon juice.Yum!

Very interesting taste but I would use less pesto then the recipe states. I made the dish with the recommended pasta which was a bit bland but O.K. The chicken was unique.

Rating: 3
I've made a variation of this before (with no recipe) but adding the lemon juice and zest made a nice difference. Several previous reviewers said the chicken was too dry--if you use boneless breasts, which I did, you need to adjust the heat. I baked mine at 350 and covered with foil (removing toward the end) and it turned out great and moist! I also cut up the lemon I had juiced and zested and threw it on top while baking--lemony and yummy!

This dish was excellent! I added extra lemon juice for an added zing and wrapped up the chicken in aluminum foil to keep the juices in. The chicken was very juicy considering I used boneless breasts and cooked it about 30 minutes. Will definitely make it again!

This along with the above mentioned linguine is REALLY good. There isn't any pan juice in the end so I just sprinkled the lemon juice over the chicken. Made it for Mom's Day dinner, there was nothing left!

This was so delicious I've made it several times. Buittoni(?spelling) pesto with basil is the pesto I used and it was wonerful.My husband and mother-in-law loved it as well!

This dish definitely satisfies any pesto craving. Reduce oil to half and add fresh lemon slices while baking - this adds flavor as well as adding to the presentation

Rating: 2
Although the taste of this chicken was good, it looked ghastly and made a huge mess in my oven. For some reason, it created a lot of oil that splattered and spilled over, smoking out the kitchen. As a result, I had no "pan juices" to speak of and therefore eliminated the last step of straining the juices and adding more lemon juice. While my husband raved about the flavor, I will not make this again!

We served with lemony cous cous and the entire meal was wonderful! The chicken was tender and flavorful, and though it wasn't the best looker of a meal, the texture of the nuts and the flavor of the lemon were fabulous. Will be a repeat performer in our house, no question.

This recipe needs some adjustments...first of all the pesto recipe is very good and versitile...use the pesto to coast boneless skinless chicken breast and press italian seasoned bread crumbs...brown in a skillet with equal parts olive oil and butter...cool until warm and toss with a ceasar salad...its and great one-dish meal.

I only made the chicken and was so disappointed. It was nothing special. My chicken was a bit dry and the pesto did nothing. I won't bother with this again.

I made this when the issue first came out and it was great. I always make my pesto at the end of summer and freeze it. I had some I had made with nuts so did not add that.

MY FAMILY TOOK ONE LOOK AT THIS DISH AND SAID "WHAT THE HECK IS THAT GREEN STUFF? IT LOOKS LIKE BABY PUKE!" NOT TOO ENCOURAGING HUH! LOL IT WAS OK... BUT I DID NOT EVEN FINISH MY DINNER. WE WILL NOT MAKE IT AGAIN. NOW THE LINGUINE.....MMMMMMMMM THAT WAS THE BEST!

Although the walnuts gave this dish a nice texture and crunch, this didn't wow me at all. I used fresh pesto that I made from the garden, but failed to see the recipe called for bone-in chicken breast. Despite that, I still found the pesto to be over-powering and the chicken dry.

I really liked this recipie - very easy and tasty. The first time i made this, I made it for my mother who also really liked it. I froze the extra sauce in ice-cube trays for her to use at another time. Used boneless breasts which worked fine. The only trouble I had was that the olive oil spattered in the oven - cover it lightly with foil at first and take it off for the last few minutes.

The whole family liked this one. I tried using boneless chicken breasts (20 minutes in oven) to cut down on the "work" for those dining. It was great. I also made the suggested linguine . The two worked very well together.

It is important to get chicken with bones. I used boneless and they shrivelled up quite a bit during baking. However, they tasted good and were incredibly quick and easy to make.

I'm so surprised the last cook didn't like this dish -- my family and I agreed this was the moistest, best chicken breast we'd ever had! The breasts we bought were HUGE (4 halves fit a 9x13 baking dish snugly); perhaps that made the difference (this also meant that I had to cook them for about 45 minutes) This was an incredibly simple dish to make, and a huge success in my book (in fact, I've already given the recipe to at least 5 people, and I only made it last week!) I served it with a variation on the pasta dish listed with it (used bowtie pasta instead of linguine, added one sauteed yellow bell pepper, 2 T chopped sundried tomatoes in oil, a little more chicken broth, and a little white wine), plus a salad and sourdough bread -- quite excellent! AND, the leftover breast made excellent sandwiches the next day (scraped the coating off and mixed it into some mayo, spread on sourdough baguette, added sliced chicken, tomato, baby lettuce, muenster...) Definitely a keeper, I'll make this dish again and again.

Not impressed. I love pesto, but didn't care for it as a coating for chicken. I'll stick with pasta.
