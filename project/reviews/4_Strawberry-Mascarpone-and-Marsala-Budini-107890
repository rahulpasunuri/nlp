Ooooh. So good. I can't think that this would be as delicious with any other cookie besides amaretti. They were a little hard to find but so worth it. A perfect quick dessert when strawberries are lovely and plentiful.

I have been making this for years and it always gets raves, It is easy, foolproof and pretty.

A real winner, tried first with the amaretti cookies, then with Belgian Butter Almond Crisps from Trader Joes. The Trader Joe substitution is great, and easy to purchase.

Incredibly quick and easy and very tasty besides.

very elegant and easy to make ahead for a party & whip out once the dinner plates are cleared. The only drawback is that the amaretti cookies are hard to find & expensive so not an every day dessert.

These were so easy my 4-year-old pretty much made these herself! They were a huge hit with the kids and adults alike. Man do I love mascarpone.

Amazing Dish! The only one slight mortification; I sliced the strawberries and then very lightly mashed 1/2 of them and then tossed them back with the sliced berries. Created more juice and enhanced the Marsala flavor.

This was amazing. I followed the recipe exactly - our local strawberries aren't quite as sweet as the California ones so the sugar was just right. We were able to polish this off with no trouble even after finishing a ridiculously large, rich meal in 30C weather. My husband even went for seconds, and he isn't a dessert person! Can't wait to make this again.

This is light and delicious! I added more Marsala to taste and I used light brown sugar instead of white in the cream component. You will want every last bite!

Made this to share with some friends and everyone loved it. in. Very elegant. Little more sugar and Marsala to strawberries next time.

A simple, yet elegant dessert. It's the perfect ending to a summer dinner when you don't want anything heavy. I have yet to serve it without someone requesting the recipe!

Fabulous! I doubled the Marsala and added a layer of fresh blueberries and whipped cream at the last moment. My guests loved it.

I made this for a dinner party and was surprised at how well this went over with the group. They really liked it. I strongly recommend this easy-to-make recipe for dinner parties. I used marguerita glasses which enhanced the desserts' "presentation".

Wow. Served this last night for a dinner party and it won everyone over with the first bite. I used Nonni's chocolate-dipped biscotti and would highly recommend it. I was worried that the marscarpone mixture was a little too sour (from the marscarpone itself), but when it's refrigerated, the sweetness seems to come out. This is an elegant, easy dessert that I'll make over and over again!

I picked strawberies one summer and ended up with a freezer full of them. In desperation I went looking for strawberry recipes and found this one, what a find!! The first time I made it I didn't have the amoretti but I wanted the almond flavor so used Amoretto instead of marsala. My guests were fulsome in their praise, licked their glasses clean (many fingers were coxing the last drops from the bottom of glasses) and all asked for the recipe. I've since experimented with different fruits and liquers and all have been fantastic. This is such a fast and easy dessert for a dinner party that I feel embarrassed when everyone gushes over it!

This was delicious and great presentation for company. Definitely make again. Used martini glasses and was great.

My idea of perfection -- an easy,urbane, delicious recipe with one of my favorite flavors, marsala. The first time you make it you have to figure out the best way to combine marscapone with liquids (a potato masher) and the best way to crumble amaretto cookies (one by one, by hand). After that, you can do it again and again with ease, as long as strawberries are in season.

Wonderful dessert! I made this tonight for my father-in-law's birthday and we all loved it. I now know, however, that I have to double the mixture too if I serve it in larger glasses. I loved making this - it's so easy - but I loved eating it even more!

One of the best deserts ever! I make it all the time. Double the mascarpone mixture for use with larger glasses. This is definitely a keeper.

Delicious, easy and quick to prepare!! I used 1 cup of blueberries, 1 cup of raspberries and 1 cup of strawberries and it turned out great!! I could not find amaretti cookies, so I used ladyfingers, which was really tasty. And I spread some chocolate powder and shaved almonds on top...I will be making this over and over again.

Very delicious and rich. I wanted the mascarpone micture to be very soft and creamy so I did not refrigerate it (just let it set for 15 minutes). I also made strawberry puree to drizzle over the top. Next time I'm going to double the macarpone mixture as I didn't feel it really was enough for six servings....but then maybe I made mine to large!!! :-)

My friend and I made this for a gourmet dinner party which was also a reunion for those of us who went to Tuscany! We searched for an Italian dessert and decided to try this one. It was so elegant and so delicious!!! So simple to do. We were highly praised for our contribution. We used blackberries and raspberries. It was summer and we served it in charming silver compotes. The condensation on the outside of the compotes from the cold ingredients made it look even more appealing in the hot summer.

I put in martini glasses and guests loved it. It was easy, elegant and did not bother my lactose intolerant guest.

Tried this tonight to see if I wanted to serve it to guests; I do and will soon. It looks great and isn't too heavy or too sweet. Try it.

Wow - this was very unique and delicious! I loved how the Marsala added a subtle kick. I couldn't find the Amaretti cookies, so I used regular camaroons. I think any old cookie would be great with this - it's the Marsala and the Mascarpone cream that make the dish.

We really enjoyed this. I used lady fingers because of an almond allergy. I did have trouble mixing the mascarpone smoothly with the sugar and cream. I think it needs a mixer to get out the lumps.

This dish is delicious and easy. The marsala really compliments the strawberries and is a good balance for the mascarpone. I have made this a number of times and it is always a hit whether I use just strawberries or a mix of berries. Try to use amaretti cookies as the flavor really works well with marsala. No need to assemble until ready to serve as long as the cookies are crumbled.

Rich and sophisticated, without being much trouble to make. This could be good with other berries as well, I expect. I'l be making it again.

I used chocolate biscotti instead of the amaretto cookies and it was fabulous.

This was so easy and a lovely presentation. I used margarita glasses! I highly recommend using original amaretti di saronno italian cookies. Making it again for a lobster party this weekend.

Easy and elegant! And you can prepare it several hours ahead, even though the recipe says only two hours. I'm not a huge fan of marsala, but this is really delicious. I've served it six times in the last two months, and everyone who has had it has loved it.

Beautiful, elegant, and delicious. Loved the marsala sauce dripping into the cookies in the bottom (I used Stella D'Oro anisette toasts; no amaretti macaroons in store here)--next time I'd use more crushed cookies in bottom. While the mascarpone was good, I think I might prefer with whipped cream next time, or a little of both.

This was just about the best dessert I've ever had! I didn't expect it would be that good. So easy to make and looks so elegant. This is a favorite I'll make again and again!

We made it with fresh raspberries, as I am allergic to strawberries. It was soooo good. We also made 2 layers of the mascarpone instead of just on the top.

This was VERY easy to do and tasted wonderful. Don't use cheap Marsala; you can get decent imported brands at the grocery store for under $10.

This dessert was so easy to make and dreamy to look at. I served it in long legged Martini glasses which showed off the layers and looked so sophisticated. My guests all commented with oooo's and ahhhh's. This one is a keeper !
