everyone loved them. i used fresh rosemary. at first the marbles were too big, but I redid them (didn't want them too overwhelmingly cheesy compared to coating) -- were good at under 1/2 inch each. I used basil leaves rather than parsley as someone else at recommended. and I did some of them with hot paprika and they were quite popular -- i might make them all spicy next time. also, I found this recipe at the last minute and used some of the goat cheese for it: http://cookandbemerry.com/pistachio-and-goat-cheese-wrapped-grapes-drizzled-with-honey-black-pepper/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+CookBeMerry+%28Cook+%26+Be+Merry%29 didn't compete with marbles, and is really interesting mix of flavors.

I brought this to a friend's who was hosting a turkey dinner & it was a hit! As if the recipe wasn't easy enough, I simplified it further by using Trader Joe's cranberry goat cheese (seasonal) and eliminating the sugar and parsley.

Como otras críticas, no da para hacer 50 o 60 cn estas cantidades. Pero la receta es genial. Todo depende del queso, que es el sabor de base. Cambié las nueces pecan por una conmbinación de almendras y avellanas, pero quedó genial. Y la próxima vez, creo que no voy a hacer el arenado con la manteca y el azúcar. Lo encontré innecesario. Pero son muy sabrosas.

I love the idea of these, and they were easy to make, but the flavors just didn't do anything for me. I think I'll play with the seasonings and try to come up with some other kind of goat cheese "marbles".

I didn't have coriander seeds, just ground coriander so I used that. I thought they needed a bit more flavor, so dusted them with a little cayenne. I didn't find the parsley to be that difficult to spear on there and it added a nice fresh flavor and a bit of color.

I served these --modified--with some other appetizers and wine, and they went over well. I thought I had coriander, but discovered at the last minute I didn't, so I spiced the pecans with salt and a tiny bit of smoked paprika. Everything else was the same, except I got frustrated spearing the parsley, so I switched to nice-sized basil leaves from my plant, and it was a lot easier. Am considering making the marbles even smaller and skewering a grape tomato on the end after the basil (or parsley). And like other reviewers, 11 oz of cheese didn't yield 50 marbles.

Awesome! And addictive!

Excellent. You won't get 50-60 marbles with 11 oz, so if you need that many, double the recipe. Ground coriander works fine. All in all very tasty and also looks wonderful. (I used the decorative toothpicks which held the parsley leaf and were also helpful to pick the marbles...)

These were good. Please note that there is no way an eleven ounce goat cheese log can make 50-60 of these. My Marbles were pretty small and it yielded about 30. It was a great appetizer and a really nice presentation with the parsley. Next time I will probably vary the spices depending on what I have available.

These little darlings were a big hit. I had a hard time with crushing the coriander until I wrapped the seeds in a little packet with plastic wrap and let my 9 year old niece bang on them with a meat pounder kind of thing. She loved helping with the mixing and rolling, so I'd definitely recommend making these with a bored kid if you have one handy. Totally yummy and fun, and I have to say that while nice enough, the parsley wasn't completely necessary, so if you don't have it, don't worry about it.

I made these as one part of our Thanksgiving appetizers and everyone really seemed to enjoy them. I did not use the coriander seeds and speared dried cranberries on the skewers to cut the goat cheesiness. I would definitely make these again!

I was very pleased with these nutty little goat cheese bites. I liked the addition of the parsley leaf, but it wasn't critical to my enjoyment and yes, it was a bit of a pain to get the leaf to stay stuck. I made fairly small marbles and was happy with that -- no shooter marbles here!

These were fine, but I thought a little boring. Too much goat cheese flavor and I love goat cheese!

These were good but not worth the trouble. Half of the parsley leaves fell off. When they stayed on they were tasty, but honestly, I probably wouldn't make them again because of the amount of time to roll all those tiny balls and then spear each one with a parsley leaf that was painstakingly torn off the sprig.

These were a great addition to the cheese plate. I had a small goat cheese log (4 ounces) and that made about 15 marbles. Forgot to get rosemary, so I used basil instead, I really liked the combo of the coriander seeds and the basil. Oh, and I cheated and used spicy pecans from Trader Joes. In any case, a keeper for sure!

These were very easy to put together and nice with drinks. Followed all instructions except that I made the balls rather small and so had to make a bit more of the pecan mixture to coat the extra surface area.

These were gone within 5 minutes from when I put them down at a party last night. I didn't even get one! I did not use coriander seeds, I'm just not a fan. Instead used the rosemary and some dried herbs I had on hand. Maybe I made the balls too big, but mine only yielded about 25 cheese balls. Great hors d'oeuvre! Enjoy!
