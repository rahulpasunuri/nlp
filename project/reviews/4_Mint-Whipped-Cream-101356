Chilled my metal whisk and mixing bowl beforehand. This is perfect for the chocolate cake; not too sweet, somewhat refreshing with the delicate mint flavor. Has been a popular request for birthdays!

This makes a great filling for chocolate meringues. Mmmmm, so good for a tea party!

Whew! This frosting is one of a kind. The pepermint extract was very tasty. It went very well with chocolate cake. I will definitely make it again! It would make a great Christmas cake.

I would definitely make this again! It tastes so much better than normal whipped cream! The mint adds a nice flair to it.

The word that best illustrates the Mint Whipped Cream would be "okay." It wasn't bad, but it wasn't particularly good. IF I make it again, I will definately use irish cream or some other thick mint liqueur and lots of it. Oh, and obviously, this does NOT travel well.

I am absolutely in love with the chocolate-mint combination and I must say this recipe is like tasting a piece from heaven
