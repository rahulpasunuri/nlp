This Orange-Ginger Swordfish was absolutely easy to make and utterly delicious! A bit of tangy spice from the orange peel and cayenne which suits me fine! I only wish I had made more so I could have leftovers! Enjoy!

This was quite good! The sauce never got exactly "syrupy" for me, but it had good flavor nonetheless, and as a marinade, it made for awesomely juicy swordfish. We grilled the fish instead of broiling, and I think that kicked up the flavor a bit. Will definitely add more hot stuff next time, and doubling the sauce was a great idea.

It is delicious. The flavour of the sauce is delicate. Instead of 1 Tb of sesame oil, I used half a tablespoon of sesame oil and the other half regular cooking oil.

My family loved this but I used it on tuna and cooked the tuna on the grill (Big Green Egg.) I also did not scrape the marinade off the tuna before cooking as the recipe suggested. I marinated the tuna about an hour and would go for 2 hours next time.

I love this dish (but I must admit my husband is not too wild about it, probably because he doesn't like sauces that have any sweetness to them). It's quick and easy, the combination of flavors (vaguely Asian, but not exactly) is just great, and the reduced sauce looks very pretty poured over the fish. As for the amount of fish, well, frankly I never pay attention to serving recommendations in recipes, since my own instincts are better. I usually allow a half pound of fish per person regardless of the type of fish or preparation--most fish stores would agree. The amount of marinade/sauce in this recipe is adequate for one and a half pounds. As for cooking times, again, I follow my instincts. As a New Englander, I've been eating swordfish all my life and can tell when it's done just by looking. You want it just cooked through, but not dry--it's best to cut into it to tell, rather than ruining this expensive fish. One important caveat for those who are trying this type of fish for the first time--you want fresh, not frozen and defrosted swordfish, and the stuff you find in the supermarket is usually pretty poor. Stick to a reputable fish store--truly a case of you get what you pay for.

Not bad, quick and easy, but for the time put in it would have better simply to blacken a good piece of fish. The flavors were interesting, but didn't combine particularly well. For the record, I doubled the sauce and reduced by 2/3, and I also had to broil the fish perhaps 1 1/2 minutes longer per side.

Maybe it's just me, but I think the amount of fish is fine. Serve it with a salad or a veg (try sesame asparagus) and your dinner is complete. Anyway, I've used this recipe a few times and even made it with sea bass once. Pretty much a guaranteed hit.

I just didn't like this. The sauce was thick and clumpy, not syrupy. The fish required an extra 3 minutes to get done. I followed directions, so I don't know what happened.

After marinating, I grilled the swordfish on our Foreman grill, added more orange juice to the marinade, then reduced it by 2/3. It came out great! The sauce was a little tart though, so next time I'll probably add a little sugar to the sauce. I also used a pound of swordfish because I agree that 10oz. really isn't enough. Aside from that, I'll definitely be making this again!

I hate to be the one to destroy this dish's 100% rating, but I made it for dinner tonight and neither my husband nor I cared for it -- and he will eat anything except squash! He left most of the fish on his plate. First problem is that the amount of fish called for is not enough for two people with average appetites. Secondly, the cooking time is too short. I broiled it 3 minutes on the first side, and after 3 on the second I checked it and had to put it back in for another 3 minutes. Even then, we found it to be raw or "sushi-ish" in the middle. Finally, we didn't care for the taste of the marinade. Oh well, can't win 'em all.

Very pleasant tangy taste. I ran short of sauce and would start with more orange juice next time. I also added a little bit of honey to the sauce to balance the flavors, and finished it with a little butter.

Recipe was very good served with steamed rice. I made double the sauce for about 1lb. of swordfish. It produced just the right amount of sauce for the fish and the rice.
