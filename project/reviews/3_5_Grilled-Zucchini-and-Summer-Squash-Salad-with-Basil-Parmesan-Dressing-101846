I loved this dish. I used patty pan squash and heirloom zucchini straight from my garden - along with homegrown basil. I used really good aged balsamic vinegar, which I think worked best because of its sweetness and lower acidity. The Parmesan was also aged and finely ground. To make it into a meal, I added some al dente fettuccine and it was PERFECT. If I had some cherry tomatoes handy, they would have been a tasty addition.

Ths is the blandest dish that I have ever made. No matter what I did to try to liven it up, it just fell flat. We didn't even save the leftovers.

Found the dressing to be gross. The balsamic vinegar just ruined it.

Garden fresh zucchini, squash and basil made this a fabulous summer salad, or side dish in our case. The basil was outstanding in the vinaigrette. I'll definitely make it again and soon.

I added both cherry tomatoes and pine nuts, and it sooo good! I have made it a couple of times, and I halve the recipe and it's enough to feed 4 as a side.

This was easy and delicious. It can be made ahead, freeing the grill for other courses. The flavors come together beautifully, and the parmesan cheese mellows the tanginess of vinegar and basil. A lovely midsummer side dish.

This salad was so refreshing and light! There is no guilt factor in eating it! I served it at a dinner party and everyone loved it (even the guys!) I will definitely make this again and again.

This was a nice summer BBQ recipe. I followed the recipe using only zucchini, as that is the only type of summer squash available in Holland. As suggested by other reviewers, I added some cherry tomatoes to the recipe. It was easy, full of flavor and a colorful dish that will compliment any meat or fish you may choose to grill. I will certainly be making this dish again.

I love this recipe. I used a little extra balsamic vinegar and some Itaian seasoning and it was fantastic! I'm making it again this week.

I agree with the person who said this was too much effort for the result. It lacked flavor.

I made this salad all last summer--great way to deal with a bumper squash crop. we found we like the squash grilled just brown--not really tender-and I cut the oil back a bit. A real easy side to throw togather in a flash.

Since I was only making this for 2 people I cut down on the recipe and used my own judgement on how much basil, parmesan and olive oil to add to the grilled zucchini, but it just turned out okay. The zucchini had enough flavor on it's own before I added the rest of the ingredients. I served it with couscous and grilled steak with chili and cumin spice rub (recipe from this site) and that too was just okay. If I make this again I will not half the recipe. Maybe that's where I went wrong.

This recipe is a simple way to add a little variation to grilled vegetables. Will definitely make again.

This receipe was too much work for the results. Perhaps using an expensive and sophisticated balsamic vinegar was the mistake. It was mushy and overpowering. Best part was the fresh basil.

This is a wonderful salad. I have made it three times in two weeks! I use my Foreman grill for the squash and it works like a charm. I add a little extra cheese and basil and cut down on the oil a bit. I added halved cherry tomatoes one time and that was delicious as well.

This was a quick and tasty recipe for grilled zucchini. The green and yellow combination made for a lovely presentation. I cut down on the oil (3 tbs) as it didn't seem to need so much. I will definitely make this again.

We make this all summer long; grill till nice grill marks but still barely tender (we like a fimer texture; remove from grill, sprinkle with parmesan or asiago and a little balsamic while piping hot; THEN let cool. Later one can cut up and add the basil, or grab out of the fridge the "boats" as an on- the-run snack food.

This recipie is so easy and has great flavor. Even my husband who isn't a fan of zucchini loved it. The squash cooked perfectly on the grill as directed.

Yum! Even my picky eight year old nephew ate it! Very easy to throw together just before getting the main course on the grill. I'll try it again with other veggies perhaps.

This was a great summertime recipe - easy to prepare most of it in advance and great way to get yur veggies! Next time, I will go a little lighter on the olive oil....

An excellent summer side dish. Particularly good for entertaining because it can be made several hours ahead of time. I prefer the squash cooked a little less than the "tender" caaled for in the recipe, as the vinegar tends to draw out some moisture.

This had a great flavour. Was an instant hit with my entire family, who are usually quite particular about cooked vegetables. It was very easy to prepare, and did not take a lot of time, which is fantastic! Will have this again, definately!

This was a staple this summer. I used all kinds of grilled veges including asparagus, portabello mushrooms, red/orange/yellow peppers and sometimes would substitute feta cheese for the parmesan. Whatever way I did it was well received.

For a twist, add a dozen cherry tomatoes (halved) when tossing in preparation to serve. Quite delicious

This is a great, simple recipe. I found that I preferred the veggies cut into larger 1" slices than smaller ones. The dressing was a little too intense for the smaller pieces, but a larger piece balanced it out well. I made this with skewered lemon chicken for guests and found it to be a great match.

I'm not usually a huge fan of squash but loved it prepared this way - really easy and tons of flavor. I served it still warm and it was fantastic.

Perfect summer side dish. Make sure to char the squash to bring out the sugars and intensify the flavors.

I served this last night as an accompaniment to a chicken dish and didn't find it very interesting. Inspite of the flavorful dressing ingredients it was quite bland. It was easy and quick so I will probably make it again but with a stronger flavored entree.

Delicious, and easy to add to a dinner prepared on the grill. Prepare the dressing in advance, grill the squash before the rest of your dinner so it has time to cool, then chop and add the dressing.

This is a easy and yummy side dish. I served it at room temp. with BBQ rosemary flank steak.
