Don't let anyone tell you that this is anything less than DELISH! Use quality jarred roasted peppers if short on time. I used a cup of peppardews (sweet/hot cherry peppers in a vinegar brine) In place of the cherry peppers. Followed rest of recipe, but also added 2-3 tbs good-quality balsamic to broth/wine mixture and returned chops to pan during reduction period. We licked our plates clean. Sure this would also be successful with chicken.

It's really good....but it's forgetable....if you know what I mean. But I did gave it 3 forks.

I used carmen peppers instead of red bell and substituted red pepper flakes for the heat because I didn't have fresh jalapenos or cherry peppers. It was awesome. Definitely will make again.

Semi time intensive(For a weeknight) but ultimately worth the effort. When the fork went down the comment was "That was good babe". Keeper for me. Roasted red peppers are succulent. Definitely a unique twist on sometimes bland pork chops.

I'm not in a hurry to repeat and I wonder if I left something out, or a miss measure. I ended up having to finish the wine.:)

Definitely a good recipe but the flavors could have been stronger. Next time will add more rosemary.

Not worth the effort. Flavors didn't gel. Did roast the red peppers, but used some jalapeno instead of cherry peppers.

This was tasty. We did not have time to roast the peppers for a weekday dinner but it was still good. We added black beans just because we had it and it turned out to be a good combination.

Great recipe! I make it for kids, so I leave out the spicy peppers and it's still a big WOW for the taste buds. I also let the garlic, rosemary, salt and olive oil sit on the chops for an hour or so -- extra yummy!

Sauce was a big hit-I also used roasted peppers from a jar to save time-cooked pork a little more than recommended.

This was fantastic, so many layers of flavors going on here. I roasted two red bell peppers and one yellow. I also used fresh herbs (I added a little tyme along with the rosemary) I like spicy things so I used two Fresno peppers and one jalapeno. I also like sweet with my heat so I also added some honey. I have a lot left over and I can't wait to use it on other things.

I love love love this sauce- there are only 2 of us but I made the full sauce recipe, and served the rest over noodles. I made the recipe as written, and it came out great! Does't take too long to make for a weeknight meal, either.

Used boneless chops and roasted peppers from a jar; fresh red jalapenos gave it plenty of bit. Very nice as leftovers as well.

Sauce had a nice bite. Substituted 2 serrano chiles, and used roasted red peppers from a jar to save time.
