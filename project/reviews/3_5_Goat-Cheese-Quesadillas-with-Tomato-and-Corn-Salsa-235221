Goat cheese is fun in a quesadilla - the salsa was colorful and great tasting. I added green chiles and had to use jalapenos from a jar. I also grilled the corn and added steak for the guys quesadillas!

This recipe ressembles an In Style recipe (7/2000 - have been looking for it for years!), although lacks the mango. These quesadillas can become heavenly if you mix diced mango with the goat's cheese.

4 forks because it is delicious, easy, and a great starting point for many variations. Tonight I added sliced garden zucchini. Yum

I don't care for fresh tomatoes, but my veggie daughter thought it was okay. She said that people who really like salsa would probably like it. I'm always looking for non-dairy, no sugar veggie or fish recipes for her. My other tortilla-eating daughter hasn't been eating it much, so I'll give it two forks since the audience just wasn't there.
