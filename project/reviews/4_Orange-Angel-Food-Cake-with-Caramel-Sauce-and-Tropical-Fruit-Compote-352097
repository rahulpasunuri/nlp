I made this for a dinner club and it was delicious. Included everything in the recipe for the sauce (which had just the right bite) and the cake. Instead of the compote I served it with stawberries. Outstanding!

Please make this recipe exactly as you read it. It's NOT a pain to remove the membrane from the blood oranges and a blood orange is AMAZING. This dessert is light, fresh and wonderful as it is written. It's so special for people with cholesterol or heart issues and absolutely delicious. I'm a foodie at heart and am contemplating making this dessert or the Meyer Lemon Budino, which is also fabulous for a chef friend. I must end the meal with something fabulous. If that's my dilemma, you KNOW you're in for a treat. Do NOT skip the caramel sauce and don't let anyone else lick the spoon!

This was my first Angel Food cake. I followed the directions exactly and it turned out perfectly. I am very proud of myself!!!! My guests liked the orange in it. I didn't have time to prepare the caramel sauce, but I did make the fruit compote and it was delicious with the cake. The desert is light. There's nothing heavy about it. This recipe is excellent as it enabled me to make a perfect cake my first time.

I made this, minus the orange compote, for a party and it was a HUGE success. I am making it again today for my son's birthday. This recipe is a keeper. The caramel cardamom sauce is sublime. The cake is moist and light. The only angel food cake I'll ever make.

I love this cake and it has become one of my favorites . The cake itself is light, tender and infused with subtle orange flavor. Don't skip the caramel sauce - it is perfect with the cake. I substituted 5-spice powder for the cardamon once and now I always use it. As for the compote, I have never found fresh passion fruit, even in San Francisco. No matter, fresh pineapple, orange, mango, kiwis & mint make a great compote. If I could give it five forks, I would.

Make this cake for Mother's Day. Wonderful cake. Reduced cooking temp. to 40 mins. Did not measure the orange peel. Just grated the whole orange - it was delicious and a nice orange flavour. The cardamon in the carmel sauce was wonderful. Like a fine wine - you could taste the cardamon at the begining and the end was the buttery-carmel flavour. Yum! Made the fruit compote with Pineapple, two kwiw's, two mangos and 3 oranges. Very nice!

Seems like a great recipe although I don't know exactly what went wrong. I followed the recipe w/o the chocolate sauce.. I cooked it at 350 for 50 minutes and it seemed like it needed more time at least in my oven. The flavor is great, I'll have to give it another try.

I only made the cake but found it to be very tasty-followed the advice to have the egg whites at room temp which really helps. I served with traditional strawberries and cream

One thing to remember: the egg whites should be room temperature before you start. And you've got to be very careful about folding in the flour at the end, to keep that volume up. Otherwise, it turns into a lead zepplin.

I followed the suggestion of one of the other reviewers and added 1/2 tsp of orange extract. I didn't bother making the caramel sauce or fruit compote and the cake was a huge hit. I would make this again.

We made this yesterday and almost finished it between 6 people. I used pre-packaged egg whites, and added 1 tsp orange extract and 1/2 tsp extra grated orange peel to the batter. I used all leftover orange zest in the compote. Since neither kiwi or passion fruit are my favorite, we used a combo of mango, nectarine, peach, strawberry, orange, and red plum for the compote. We had LOTS of compote left, which tasted amazing on waffles this morning. ;) My caramel didn't thicken or turn very dark, but was delicious regardless. Altogether, the combination was a little rich, but went over very well. I think I'll hold off on some of the extra orange next time. All three components were tasty alone or in combo.

this was so perfect! The directions were right on. the texture was just divine! it was not spongy, but was so gentle, light, soft, not too sweet, like a taste of heaven. I followed the recipe exact and could not taste the orange peel much so I suggeest if you are wanting it try 1/2-1 tsp. of orange extract for a more orange flavor. Carmel sauce was a gereat touch too.

This was on a dessert buffet table and was the first to go. The cake was wonderful and not at all cottony like so many other angel food cakes. I loved the caramel sauce with the cardomen. I didn't have any passion fruits, so I macerated the fruit with some passion fruit concentrate.

This is the best angel food cake I have tried in quite a while. The key was not using a non-stick pan. I have never had an angel food cake have such a great texture on the outside. Plus, my husband loved the caramel sauce.

The texture of the cake was nice and the caramel sauce was outstanding. The cardamom is a nice touch. NOW THE RUB... What is up with the compote? Removing all that membrane from the blood orange is just a pain, crunchy passionfruit parts belong in the trash and the compote as a whole was too runny. Instead, keep it simple with a single fruit on the side and you will have a winner here.

Made this for Sunday dessert. It is the lightest fluffiest angel food cake I've made yet. I didn't put in the orange peel 'cuz I wasn't going to drive 3 miles just to get oranges. Used Naturegg egg whites(1 carton plus 1 extra egg white was the right proportion). Keep these in the freezer & you can make this cake anytime.We ate it with just some fresh-made mascarpone & strawberries, & loved it! I will keep this in the roster. Follow the recipe & it won't fail.
