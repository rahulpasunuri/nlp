I've made most of the holiday trifle recipes on this site and this was the most disappointing. Although some of the guests did really enjoy it, many people found it too sweet. For the amount of effort it takes to make, I'm not sure its worth it for the mixed reviews it gets.

Surprisingly light and delicious considering all the rich ingredients. Be sure to fully bake the cakes to a golden brown, as the more done they are, the better they will stand up to the cognac and custard. We did not put enough cognac on each piece and a stronger taste would have made the end result even better. I wish the cranberry flavor had been more distinct - I think it was somewhat lost in the other flavors. Do not fret the thinness of the custard - it is REALLY thin, but it therefore soaks into the cake much better. I'm on the fence about whether I'd do this again - it does take considerable effort, although the presentation is spectacular.

Beautiful dessert. The custard was not firm enough...too liquidy....that was my only complaint. Find another recipe for the custard. Served 18 people with this dish!!

This was absolutely delicious and impressive-looking. It wasn't hard to make, but just a little time consuming. If you're pressed for time, then I would just make the cranberry jam, the cake, and the syrup. I think that you could easily use cool whip and instant pudding for the rest without much sacrifice.

A triumph! I made this for a trunk show I hosted at my house and it was a huge hit. I did not attempt to arrange the cake in vertical layers, but simply layered the ingredients horizontally. I compensated for using a larger bowl (slightly over 4 quart capacity) by adding a layer of slightly sweetened whipped cream in the middle of the bowl and doubling the recipe for the cranberry jam. I did not make the garnish, but rather spooned some of the cranberry jam over the top layer of whipped cream in little dollops around the edge. The taste was exquisite, and I've already been told by friends that I will have to make this again for them.

I found this to be average as far as trifles go. I also found it to be too time consuming for what it produced in flavor though the presentation was outstanding.

My husband and his co-workers loved this. For some reason my cake took long time to bake and it was still unbaked in the middle.... but I still used the part that was baked fine and put them together. I coudln't make it look as nice and tasty as the one from the picture but I remember the saying of "guys don't care how it looks" and I guess that saying has been proved. I'll try to make it again and make it look nice, too

Without a doubt, the best trifle I have ever had. All of our guests rolled their eyes and smiled with delight when they tasted it. Perfect trifle.

this is very complicated to make and very difficult to end up with something that looks like the picture. But it is delicious and, if you use a more 'layered' approach rather than trying to get things perfectly aligned along the outside edge of the bowl, it tastes just a good but you won't have a nervous breakdown making it! The custard is a great recipe to use in other dishes, too.

I made this for an office party...it was excellent!!! It is not very hard...a little time consuming though!!!

Quite a bit of work, but worth the effort . . . I will confess, however, that I did make one substitution . . . JELLO VANILLA PUDDING FOR THE CUSTARD! BROO-HA-HA-HA! It was still wonderful.

OK, now I get it...those missing pieces are listed separately. (I'm new at using this great resource and perhaps a bit slow to find my way around!)

Err..am I totally blind or are the recipes for the cranberry jam, cognac syrup, and rich custard missing?

An amazing dish! I served this at a New Years eve party not only was it the centerpiece of the buffet it looked amazing abnd everyone loved it. I also agree with the other reviewer in not using a "guide" to pre cut the strips, I used a pair of kitchen shears and cut the strips directly in the bowl this kept all the strips even.....

This is one of the best festive dessert recipes I have ever made. The trifle was appreciated by all ages.

This dessert was a spectacular sight on the holiday buffet, and it was wonderful to eat, too. I suggest that you not "trim one piece and use it as a guide" as the recipe instructs. This results in an uneven top edge. Instead, arrange all of the "sandwiches" in the bowl, with the excess length of the sandwiches extending above the edge of the bowl. Now trim them carefully with a serrated knife using the bowl edge as a guide.

Made it for a party. Everyone loved it and said that it was very light. Because they thought it was a 'light' recipe, they were very surprised at the number of egg yolks in it.
