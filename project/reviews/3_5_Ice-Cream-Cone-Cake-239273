I made this cake for my son's 9th birthday this weekend. The cake itself was great, like a pound cake almost. I was very nervous about the frosting. I've never made custard before and I am sure that I overcooked it. I didn't understand what I was supposed to strain and retain based on the directions (not very clear for the less-experienced). I ended up chilling a glob of sweet scrambled eggs, but the buttercream base turned out nice and I followed someone's suggestion here to temper before combining. It seemed that instantly my "custard" came back to life and the frosting came together nicely. Initially it tasted like PURE butter so I added some confectioners sugar and a little more vanilla so the taste would be more familiar. It looked great and my son was soooo surprised by the cake. It was hands-down one of the best cakes I've ever made and it was fun to make! I should have let the cake warm up a little before cutting it because the icing cracked on the first few slices, but once it sat in the 80+ degree 4th of July sun it started to separate and I could see some of my scrambled egg in the icing. Not sure what I did wrong there, but I will definitely be trying the frosting again. I warned the party-goers that the cake and icing had 9 sticks of butter and 3 cups of whole milk, so it was NOT low calorie. Although it was super rich people came back for another slice. I think the cones were the biggest hit, next time I'll just make cones and pipe the icing on them.

I am a pastry chef. I made this cake for my son's 15th birthday. It was WONDERFUL. It is a very rich cake. I read all of the reviews & was prepared to do damamge control on the buttercream. You must use the whisk attachment. I beat COOL, not room temp butter & added 2 Tablespoons of sifted cornstarch as a binder to the butter, after creaming. Then, I added VERY COLD custard a Tablespoon at a time on a slower speed & gradually increaded the custard until a slow steady stream as I increased the speed. It was delicious. I did make an extra half batch of the buttercream. I made the frosting again w/o addiding the additional cornstarch & it turned out great but the butter must be cool & the custard VERY cold. If it is a hot or humid day, add the cornstarch to be safe. About the high butter content, that is what a true custard buttercream is supposed to be made with. A true buttercream, custard, cooked or regular is supposed to be rich w/ high amounts of butter. This is a cake for very experience bakers.

I made this cake for a 13 year old's birthday. The cake looked great and tasted pretty good, but read on before you try it. I think the design and look of the cake is brilliant, but the execution is fraught with potential problems (as you can see from the other reviews.) I also believe this cake was way too rich for a child or teenage birthday party. If I make it again, I will make a different type of cake but still use the butter cream frosting again. All my workarounds to avert disaster resulted in a very messy kitchen. The look is great, but in a Taste vs. Effort benefit analysis the recipe, as it is now, does not add up.

This cake was...interesting. I had great hopes for this based on previous reviews however I didn't fine the buttercream to be as great as it should have been. The cake totally fell apart after assembly, but it did taste ok.

I just finished making this cake for my 8 year old's birthday. The cake part seems kind of dense and the custard base was a disaster. I have a lot of experience making custard for pastry cream but two tries with this recipe and each time it curdled into scrambled eggs. I ended up making my standard custard recipe to mix into the butter and that worked okay. It is a fantastic presentation, but something seems wrong with the custard part.

I haven't made this cake yet, but read the recipe and the reviews. For those of you who had problems with the buttercream, this might help. Before you add the cold custard to the whipped butter, gently stir a little of the butter into the custard with a wisk to lighten the custard, then slowly add the custard mixture into the remaining butter mixture. That should prevent it from lumping up. There is too much contrast in the consistencies of the custard and the whipped butter especially since there is no sugar mixed in with the butter to give it structure. Also if your kitchen is very warm your butter may be too soft. It should be soft and light but still firm enough to hold it's shape like firm whipped cream. Hope this helps.

I think this recipe is cursed for me. Was planning just to make the cones as individual servings. Cake all fine. Attempted to make custard for frosting - got scrambled egg. Second attempt got as far as making the frosting - and it curdled. Managed to get it mostly to come together by adding icing sugar but eventually gave up. Third attempt at frosting, used regular buttercream recipe, worked great, piped perfectly, looked amazing... Then, all I had to do was transfer the tray of cakes to the fridge, at which point I lost my balance and dropped the whole lot on the floor. nnnnnnnnnngggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhh. I will eat the salvaged part of the wreckage myself, but I certainly can't serve it to anyone. Will stick to regular cupcakes in future.

My husband and I made this for our son's second birthday. It was fabulous. There were a few slight glitches, including having to concoct another full batch of the custard buttercream as the first time there wasn't enough. It was a slippery, slightly lopsided and decadent dessert that our son loved. Hope to make it again someday as the custard buttercream is so worth the taste experience.

I made this cake last year for my sons birthday. It was delicious. the skill level is definitely a person who is comfortable with baking and decorating. The butter cream is what rocks it. i have made many variations on it. i was always a fan of an italian meringue style butter cream but the custard butter cream is great for a special occasion item.

I made this cake last August for my childs 4th birthday and it was wonderful. The icing is extremely rich but very good. I did not have a problem with the icing's consistency. I agree with another reviewer and will increase the icing by 1/4 to get better coverage on the cake.

This review is for the buttercream only. I made 24 cupcakes in ice cream cones with a different cake recipe, but I used this buttercream to get the right "look" for my cones. I was really nervous after reading the reviews, but I have to say, the buttercream was fantastic! It was not too buttery in taste. In fact, I don't normally even like buttercream, but this was very, very good. The tablespoon of vanilla gave it the perfect taste, and the chocolate recipe was good too. It absolutely looked just like soft-serve ice cream when I piped it out with the large star shaped tip. And I needed just about the full recipe of frosting to decorate 24 cones, just FYI. I followed the recipe precisely, cooking to 175 degrees. I chilled the custard for about three hours before continuing. I had no problem mixing the custard with the butter. My only "problem" was figuring out how to transport these lovely cones to the preschool potluck! Next time, I'll make the cake since it would be easier to transport!

After reading the previous reviews, I was nervous to make the frosting as written but had mentally committed to making this cake for my oldest child's third birthday. I decided to make it with a traditional buttercream frosting and found a recipe in The Cake Bible. It still had a ton of butter, but I knew it would turn out and it did. I 1 and 1/2'ed the recipe and followed all the other instructions for this cake the same (mixed some of it with chocolate and some with the cookies). It turned out great and gots lots of ooohs and aaahs from all the parents. I will definitely make again.

I made this cake for my sixteenth birthday. As I am not particularly skillful at piping frosting, my swirls turned out more like blobs and everyone was repulsed when I told them there were six sticks of butter in the frosting. The cookie filling was the highlight.

My 8 year old Granddaughter saw the photo of this cake in my Gourmet magazine and asked me to bake one for her birthday party. I made one today to test the recipe prior to next weeks party and it tasted terrible. My husband told me he thought it tasted like a glob of lard and I agreed with him. We couldn't even finish our small slices. I threw the whole cake into the trash. I followed this recipe to the letter but the cake was oily and the frosting tasted like pure butter. I wonder if anyone at Gourmet magazine actually made this cake and tasted it prior to publishing in the August 07 issue. I found it to be a waste of expensive ingredients.

I made this using the do ahead tips and it was great. I should have let the icing come up closer to room temperature, so it would have been easier to spread, but it was fine if thick the way I did it. I think variations on the basic idea are in our future. For example, the middle cookies and cream layer I would replace with crushed wafer cones and buttercream. I also might try dark, light and white chocolate to make several flavors of frosting; I think the chocolate stiffens the frosting slightly and that is better for the design. Finally, I might make cupcakes in waffle bowls and frost them with the custard in vanilla and chocolate peaks. Perhaps because of my using chilled frosting, I had to ration it pretty closely to cover everything. If I were doing it again the make ahead way, I would increase the recipe by a fourth (that makes an even dozen eggs and two pounds of butter, but this is a special occasion dessert anyway.

We made this cake for our daughter's first birthday. It turned out perfectly and was a huge hit at the party. We actually served almost 30 people (it was quite rich but not too sweet). It is a very involved recipe and actually my husband, mother-in-law and myself all participated for a successful end result. It was very special!

I tried making this cake without the cones for an adult's birthday. The cake turned out great; I used the excess batter to make a few cupcakes. The icing started out great, too. The custard base looked great, just like the kind I use for rich ice creams. The butter looked perfect, light and fluffy, after some beating in my mixer. But when I added the cold custard, things started to go wrong. No matter how much I beat the mixture, it did not firm up very much. I tried spreading it on my cake layers, but it was so greasy it kept sliding around. It literally looked like pure butter. I had to toss the whole cake b/c it became so greasy, I couldn't even scrape the icing off to put my own icing on. It was just too greasy. What happened? This seemed like a great recipe, and I am assuming I did something wrong. Anyone have any hints? I have never had this happen before, and I've made all sorts of cooked frostings.

I tried making this recipe (with the cones) for an adult's b-day. Cake was great-- I used the extra batter to make a few cupcakes. But when I made the frosting, it turned into a greasy mess. Custard base looked great-- just like when I make a custard base for ice cream. Butter looked light and fluffy before I added the cold custard. But then, everything went wrong. When I tried to spread the icing on the cake, it seemed like pure butter and wouldn't adhere. I eventually had to toss the whole thing since the cake got so greasy I couldn't put any other icing on it either. Big waste of ingredients!! But this seemed like a great recipe-- can't figure out where I went wrong. Please advise. I'd love to try again, but it's a lot of ingredients to risk wasting.
