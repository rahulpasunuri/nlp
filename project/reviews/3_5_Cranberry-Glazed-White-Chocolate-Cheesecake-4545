Required holiday standard at our house. I reduce the oven temp to 325 to prevent overbrowning (adds a few minutes to the cooktime). I cut the sugar in the cranberries way back - 1/3 to 1/2 of what is called for in the recipes - it's the tart bite of the cranberry against the sweetness of the cheesecake that makes this a favorite.

A very good recipe. One thing to make it a Great recipe is to shave the white chocolate into the batter and fold in just prior to baking. Cheers

I've made this cheesecake twice, with rave reviews each time. The first time I made it, I wasn't able to find hazelnuts or cranberries at my local grocery store, so I put almonds and a little Frangelico in the crust. For the topping, I used strawberries - only 1/4 c of water and sugar. As for the cooking time of one hour - keep close watch on it! I've found that 45 minutes is almost too long, and the cheesecake comes out very dark on top.

The flavors of the crust and filling were overpowered by the cranberry topping. In addition, it didn't slice and serve very well.

Crust and filling were great but overpowered by cranberry glaze.

This cheesecake is fantastic! Hit of the holiday season. White chocolate and frangelico combination is to die for. I used extra white chocolate as suggested by other reviewers and agree with them. Can't wait to make it again!

Nothing remarkable to look at ~ I've seen nicer cheesecakes. Served this for a baby shower and everyone liked it but didn't rave about it. I added dollops of Frangelico Creme on the side ~ THAT was yummy! Will have to make this again before I am totally convinced that this cheesecake is a keeper though...

This was fine, but like other reviewers I didn't see the point of the white chocolate -- without the cranberry glaze, which was very festive, if not delicious on the cake -- it tasted liked a regular cheesecake.

This was good but I agree the taste of the white chocolate does not come through- perhaps increase? I divided into two cakes- otherwise too rich!

I made this cheesecake for a corporate wine & cheese party. My only problem was that it started to burn and it took a bit longer than the recipe stated. I think next time (which will be Christmas) I will lower the oven temperature to 325. It was a big hit and the tartness of the cranberries were the perfect contrast to the richness of the cheesecake. Definitely a keeper!!

Very festive looking - perfect for Christmastime. My only complaint is that I didn't taste the Chocolate in the chocolate cheescake - it taskted like an ordinary cheesecake to me

Just made this for Christmas and all I can say is WOW!!!!! Everyone here raved about it and it tasted great the next day, too. A few suggestions, though: the cheesecake took about 5 more minutes to bake than the recipe suggested, and I found it was much easier to just put a slotted spoon in the cranberry mixture to drain the cranberries rather than go through the hassle of pushing them through a strainer. Same result, but significantly faster.

I have made this recipe each Christmas since the December 1997 issue it came out in. I am not even a cheesecake enthusiast, but the rest of my family would be very upset if I didn't make it.

I made this for a Christmas luncheon and it was phenomenal! I agree with the last reviewer, the tartness along with the sweet cheesecake is wonderful. It's also a beautiful presentation, and easy! Will do it again next week for Christmas.

This recipe is easy to make and is cheesecake heaven. I've made it a tradition for X-mas dessert. The crust is excellent and the interplay between the tartness of the cranberries and the sweetness of the cheesecake make it a rich treat.

This cheesecake works wonderfully with a chocolate sauce, or use raspberries instead of the cranberries in the topping glaze. With a chocolate sauce, try using almonds instead of hazelnuts in the crust, and add a little almond liqueur in the sauce.
