I loved the original so then I adapted this recipe to a Orange Whole Wheat Muffin. It's nothing like the cake, but uses the same principles and techniques sucessfully. Very adaptable recipe. http://kaleeats.blogspot.ca/2013/03/orange-whole-wheat-muffin.html

this is the best cake. easy to make, very moist, not too sweet, perfect special cake or just everyday cake for family and friends. I love to bake during the holidays. This cake was so good and so easy to make, I made it 4 times. Try adding fresh berries and making a glaze with confectioners sugar and fresh lemon juice. They sell this same cake at $3.75 a slice at a local bakery. I think my cake is better!

This is my go-to recipe for a simple, elegant dessert. I love the texture that is somewhere between pound cake and angel food cake. It is absolutely delicious eaten plain, but I like to serve it with raspberry coulis and soft whipped cream. It is also wonderful served with fruit that has been poached in wine, or fresh berries in the summer time. Absolutely perfect in every way!

This is one of the best cakes ever! I needed to feed more people so I increased the recipe by 50%. I was in a hurry and so wasn't super careful about measuring and it still came out delicious. There was not a crumb left. I made a simple glaze of lemon juice and powdered sugar which gave it a sweet tartness.

Excellent and fool proof recipe. I used all purpose flour instad of cake flour and it came out light and delicious. Probably come out even better with cake flour!

This cake is delicious. It is dense and not so sweet, typical of European cakes. Oddly, the instructions call for salt, which is not listed in the ingredients. The instructions said to oil the springform pan and the parchment, which I did. The oil leaked out all over my oven floor! Next time, I'm greasing the pan with butter.

Well, I didn't beat the eggs longer than three minutes, I think I didn't do the folding thing right cause it's tough and dense. I did rap it three times and saw a big difference between three and two. The first time I confused the lemon juice and the extra white so it had the extra white and lemon juice in it. I rapt it on the counter twice and saw what looked like more bubbles about to pop. So the second time it seemed tougher than the first. Could I put more oil? I'm terrible at baking I shouldn't even try, but I would like to at least be able to follow the entire recipe correctly before I totally give up! If by accident I didn't measure the oil totally accurately and there is a tiny bit too much would that mess it up or is it the folding that I need to work on? I'm too pushy. About the extra white, if you have another use for it that's fine, but I think I liked the cake with the accidental white better, I also added a lot more sugar (1/4 C) totaling an entire cup and no sprinkles on top. I was afraid if it wasn't sweet enough it would be a total waste. Do you think if it is less sweet the texture stands out more? The sugar on top is being annoying cause it just makes a mess. Add butter to it when you take it out of the oven to avoid a mess.

Thought this cake was wonderful. It was just light enough to go with a dinner of lasagna. Served with fresh blueberries and a sweet Moscato wine. Easy to make and I put turbinado sugar on the top; added a little crunch that was just perfect!

i had to make something for me (gluten free) and a friend (no corn, dairy, soy)! hit on the idea of olive oil cake with gluten free flour (rice, potato and tapioca) - it turned out really well! i put lemon icing on top, which was just perfect.

This recipe is flawless. I did a few things wrong on purpose and it relentlessly came out perfect. I did not have a springform pan so i used a glass pie pan. I did not have cake flour so i used all purpose. And I did not have a mixer so i used a blender! Needless to say there was nothing even close to soft peaks, but a mere frothy bubbling egg mixture. However, my low expectations for my mal-prepared creation were shattered when it came out looking great and even more so when it tasted great! I drizzled lemon glaze on the top and added candied lemon rind for some extra zing and everyone loved it. It was also very easy to make. Cant wait to do it again!

I do not have a springform pan, so I made mine in a regular 9" cake pan. It deflated as it cooled... is this normal and attributed to the pan? Also, I used Light Olive Oil instead of EVOO... is this perhaps the reason it deflated? Perhaps I did not beat the egg whites to the perfect peak consistency? It still tastes good, light flavor and makes the house smell delicious as it bakes. Not sure if I'll make this again, if I can't figure out the deflation issue...

I've made more than five times now and finally perfected it. This recipe can be completed better if the baker has two mixing bowl so as not to have to wash the first bowl and clean it to mix the egg whites. Even when all the sugar is added to the yolks, it will still turn out perfect. Just mix the egg whites with a dash of coarse kosher salt and follow the instruction closely. I used demerara sugar or sugar in the raw for the topping after the cake bakes for 10 minutes.

Delicious and a nice light texture. Used a mild EVOO and added roughly two teaspoons of chopped rosemary to the flour/lemon zest mix.

Oh, wow! I love this cake! So does my 3 yr old. I made no changes except that I did not have a lemon on hand so I used reconstituted lemon zest and bottled lemon juice. I'm sure it would be even better with the real thing. This cake is so moist and fluffy and wonderful! We don't like super-sweet cakes. If that's what you're looking for, it might not appeal to you. But this is the new favorite in my house! Came out absolutely perfect in every way.

I have to agree with the previous "A Cook": I found the flavors in this cake to be too funky for proper enjoymenteggy, olive-y, not right for a cake. I served it at a tea party with other desserts, and some guests said they kind of liked it, but in the grand scheme of things it was unpopular. The cake did come out pretty, in a rustic way. And I don't think I would have minded the olive taste had it not been so eggy. So if you like the taste of eggs, maybe this cake will work for you.

Wow, I just ate this cake and it was awful. But I like cake so I kept trying it. So many wrong tastes. It would go from savory to sweet and mature in different ways in my mouth. Even minutes after eating, its complicated aftertaste remained in my mouth and confused my poor taste buds. It wouldn't give up! I will not make this cake again.

I made this about six months ago, so I don't remember if I made any changes other than using the zest of the entire lemon. It was a big hit though. Some guests commented that they really enjoy cakes without frosting, so this was a refreshing change. I had served it buffet style along with brownies, and fresh, local strawberries and cherries (it was late spring). It was a simple, satisfying dessert spread.

Rating: 4
I was impressed how rich this cake came out: a thin wedge was filling! I used the zest from an entire lemon and found the lemon flavor perfect. Even though I used a fruity oil, I couldn't really detected the flavor other than that the mouthfeel was not as greasy as a cake made with butter. In my opinion, the cake was made great by covering with about a cup of lemon glaze.

Rating: 4
Wow, this is a great cake!! It has a slightly unusual, moist texture because of all the eggs, but the flavor is fantastic. I used all the zest and juice from one large lemon and there was plenty of lemon flavor. I used a fairly mild evoo and it worked perfectly. I'm going to make this very soon and substitute half almond meal for the flour to see what that does.

Rating: 4
delicious! i used 1/2 evoo and 1/2 oo. i didn't find it too eggy at all, but i would definitely up the lemon zest next time.

This is no doubt my favorite cake. Easy to make and perfect flavor. I love that it's not too sweet, and its rustic appearance makes a real impact. I serve it with fresh mixed berries for a light and delightful treat. I have also infused the olive oil with some rosemary for a a delicious herbal twist. It was a hit at the office.. so fragrant! Lemon and rosemary are definitely a winning combo for this simple but impressive cake.

I used a Meyer Lemon and I think a regular lemon would have been better. It is a very nice cake that we enjoyed quite a bit, but it is a bit "eggy" as other reviewers state. Mine took 35 minutes and the texture was perfect. Better lemon flavor the 2nd day. I'm not sure I'd make it again - I've had better versions.

Light, not too sweet, and perfect for summer. I doubled the amount of lemon juice and used 1/2 c evoo and 1/4 c regular olive oil.

Light and airy cake that was perfect after a hefty meal in the summer. Used EVOO and added extra lemon zest to punch up the flavor. Served with whipped cream and the leftover fruit salad (grapes, blueberries, and nectarines in cardamom orange zest syrup). I have already purchased the lemon flavored olive oil for the next time I make it.

I used a fruity extra-virgin oil and upped the amount of lemon. I baked it at 170c for 30mins in a dark pan. I found it to taste a little eggy though, - not much oil flavour

An easy to make dessert, with a unique taste derived from the olive oil. My cake finished baking at the 30 minute mark. I will add additional lemon zest and juice in the future, and I will consider experimenting with the addition of rosemary or lavender.

made it, ate it and will do it again...a simple recipe that can be tweaked in so many ways. Next time I will add a little lemon extract and I am tempted to play with some rosemary. Used good dated olive oil and "rescued" it after 35 minutes. Next time will check after 30 min.

This is a great recipe. I bumped up the amount of zest I used and I used an unfiltered, cold pressed olive oil; expensive, yes, but it added an incredible depth to the cake. I also made a lemon simple syrup and thickened it a bit on the stovetop with lemon zest and a bit of lemon juice, sugar and water. This I poured over the top when serving and added a quenelle of lemon infused whipped cream. Another use for this sponge was in an entremez where I paired it with a chocolate olive oil mousse. Beautiful!

Fabulous recipe. Very unique. I added some lemon zest garnish to the top of the cake before baking and served with whipped cream and blueberries. I agree with the reviews that say a little less evoo and more lemon juice could be used.

Rating: 3
I really like the flavor of this cake. I also used apf & evoo. However, I should have turned the oven down a bit, or adjusted the baking time, because it did get a little over cooked around the edges & the bottom. To make it a little different, I added a meringue to the top of it, and I have to say it was a hit!

Rating: 3
Good recipe. I would slightly reduce the oil and slightly up the lemon juice/zest. The olive oil flavor was great, and I wouldn't shy away from using a very fruity oil. I baked at 325 (thermometer). The top crust is incredible. I think the batter would make an incredible "adult" twinkie.

I made this with all purpose flour and extra virgin olive oil and the taste was wonderful. However, I used a light colored spring form pan and baked it at 350°F as suggested and the crust was still a bit too brown and it make the cake a tad dry so next time I'll try it at 325°F. I drizzled melted Lemon Curd all over it and that was fabulous. All in all- this is a great cake!

I made the recipe according to the directions. It turned out great. As it cooled down, the center of the cake started to fall. By the time it cooled the centre was half as thick as the edges. It still tasted great. I liked that it was not made with butter or shortening

You never know what's going to happen with high-altitude baking here in Denver. This cake turned out great! I used all-purpose flour, a little extra lemon juice and turned down the temp to 325 since I had a dark pan, per the previous reviews. Served it with raspberries and it was a perfect light dessert after a rich meal.

I really liked this cake. Not overly heavy or sweet - a nice dessert. My pan is dark, so I should have turned the temp. down to 325 right away. It got pretty brown around the edges. Next time I would add more lemon peel and possibly serve with lemon curd. Will definitely make again.

This was certainly easy enough, but not particularly special. If I do it again, I would definitely increase the lemon zest and juice, and probably take another baker's suggestion of glazing it.

I made this into mini-cupcakes, rather than a cake (makes about 44 minis and bake for 20 minutes instead of 45). I also glazed the cupcakes with lemon glaze after baking and stuck the cupcakes back in the oven for 1 minute to set the glaze (glaze: 1/4 cup lemon juice, 2 cups confectioners sugar-cook over medium heat until sugar dissolves). I used Extra Virgin Olive Oil and thought the flavor was just right. Everyone loved them...a nice, springtime treat!

This cake is perfect for novice bakers. It takes 15 minutes to prepare, and it's very hard to mess it up. It's like a not terribly sweet pound cake. If you didn't tell people it was made with olive oil, they would never guess. I assume that you could make it with a neutral-tasting oil like canola, and it would come out fine.

I found this cake rather uninteresting; low average for both taste and texture. If you have an agressive tasting olive oil that you absolutely love, you might like the cake.

Wonderful, and straightforward to make. Used regular flour and extra virgin olive oil, plus added extra rind from a clementine (to build on the citrus flavor). Used a 10 inch springform, and increased the recipe to 1.5. Baked at 325 for 53 minutes. Came out perfectly, beautiful texture and flavor. Colleagues loved it plain with coffee and tea. Could certainly build on presentation for a more special occassion-- adding a citrus curd and whipped cream, perhaps. Will absolutely make this again-- so few ingredients, such good result.

I too used extra-virgin olive oil and all-purpose flour, and the cake came out very well! The entire process took under an hour: the batter took less than 20 minutes to assemble, and the cake baked (in a glass dish) in just over half an hour. The cake tastes a bit plain on its own--it's essentially a dense lemon sponge cake--but is absolutely stunning paired with a simple balsamic-strawberry sauce.

Yum! This cake was so easy to prepare and delicious. We ate it the first night on its own and the next night with fresh whipped cream and raspberries. All I had on hand was extra virgin olive oil, and it came out fine. Also had no cake flour so used all purpose. Fabulous cake!
