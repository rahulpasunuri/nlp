Nothing special. As written is very bland, I had to tweak it a little. I had to add more garlic, herbs de Provence and salt to make it more palatable.

Too watery. Better off as a pasta sauce than a dip. Kept the eggplant skins on for added texture/nutrition.

Just okay. I added a full head of Garlic that was pan-roasted in foil along with the egglplant, and it was not too much. Also added about 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper to boost the flavor.
