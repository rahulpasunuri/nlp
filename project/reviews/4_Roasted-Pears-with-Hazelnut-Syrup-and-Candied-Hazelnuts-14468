This was really good. Since it was for a weeknight dinner, I cheated a little bit and just used candied pecans from Trader Joe's. I didn't peel or pare the pears, but I would definitely pare them next time. I cooked them longer than the recipe called for, but I wouldn't have minded them even softer. I served with french vanilla ice cream on top -- very nice.

I didn't think anyone would have room for these after dinner at a party, but apparently they were worth it! Very easy, very delicious, and not heavy. I cored the pears, and I cooked them for a very long time (maybe around 45 minutes?). I was concerned about the other reviews, saying longer is better, turns out they were right!

I peeled the pears and I think I would leave at least a partial peel next time. It might hold the sugar and syrup and crust more when baked. I also cored them from underneath so they would be easier to eat. The nuts were divine. I served this with softly whipped (unsweetened) cream also.

This is a nice light dessert. It has good flavor and doesn't feel like too much. It is also a snap to put together.

This was a wonderful dessert. The syrup was sweet, but the tartness of the pear countered nicely. A tip: be sure to test the pears and keep them in long enough...the fist time I made this dish the pears turned out a little too hard. The next time I compensated and they turned out perfect. All told, a little extra work to prepare but well worth the effort.

A great alternative to Thanksgiving pies and a favorite for winter entertaining. Also, great because the syrup and nuts can be prepared ahead of time.

Very nice winter recipe-elegant and tasty. However, I found it too sweet and would omit the 1/4 cup sugar sprinkled on at the end. Will also reduce syrup a little to thicken, and serve with a collar of whipped cream for a better presentatiion. I found also that they tend to darken the 2nd day.

This light desert was a wonderful alternative to the standard pumkin pie I usually make. I made it last for Thanksgiving dinner and everyone except my father-in-law (who hates the texture of pears in general) loved it. This dish did take a little longer to prepare than I expected (specifically shelling and candying the nuts), however, it was well worth it and I will make it again this year. Note: I left the peel on the pears and they were both beautiful and delicious.

These pears were delicious. My family loved the combination. The recipe was easy enough, but I wasn't sure whether to pare them or leave the skins on. I pared them.
