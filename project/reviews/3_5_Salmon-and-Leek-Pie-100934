Just okay..disappointing after all the good reviews. It's very dry without the sauce...I made my own sauce with some garlic, capers, and red onion, but the salmon itself didn't have much flavor. I couldn't even taste the lime. I wouldn't repeat this one.

Used combination of salmon, prawns and scallops of equal size. Upped the quantity to serve 8 by using 3 pieces of puff pastry seamed into a long rectangle. Will certainly make again for parties - so simple and so elegant.

We have made this recipe as given, and it was definitely a 4-star! This 3-star rating is for the recipe without the sour-cream chile sauce and with dried dill, not fresh. It was still delicious, but it's a little dry without the sauce and it definitely suffered from dried dill (but perhaps ours is old!). The recipe is a keeper, though, and would be GREAT as an elegant brunch or lunch item, although we have had it only as dinner. Unexpected and delicious!

Made a few changes. Wanting this to be lighter I first baked the salmon fillet low and slow until just flaky. Cooled and scraped out of skin. Combined with rest of ingredients as instructed. Wrapped in filo dough into tiny packets. They were perfectly flaky and delicious but a bit bland. Definitely needed the sauce.

I have been using this recipe regularly since it was first printed. Its easy & simply delicious. I tend to like more complex flavours but there's something special about how well all these basic flavours meld. The only tweak I make to the recipe is to add some cayenne to the salmon mix ( I have used harissa before) for a little kick. I keep experimenting with the sauces & don't have a particular favourite, although I have definitely used some of the suggestions here.

My friend served this for New Year's Eve and passed the recipe to me so I could serve it to our book club. Everyone loved it. It easily serves 8 people. It was very easy to make, although next time I'm going to buy the salmon somewhere I can trust the guy behind the counter to skin it for me. Skinning the fish was the hardest part. Also, just a heads up - the 4 leeks seemed like too much while I was preparing it, but did not turn out to be so. I used Pepperidge Farm puff pastry and it was delicious.

Wow! This was super easy to make and INCREDIBLE to eat! And just to look at! It made me look like some kind of super chef to my wife. Served it with a simple mixed-greens salad and some roasted potatoes with rosemary and whole garlic cloves, and a passable Volk chardonnay, and it was awesome. Held together beautifully, the crust browned up nicely, the whole thing was wonderful. I did my own thang on the sauce, just whipped up some greek yogurt, lime juice, grated a garlic clove into it, sprinkled some ancho chile powder in there...damn good and took two seconds. Go make this. Seriously.

I love this recipe for entertaining. I add a little asian hot chili garlic sauce to the sour cream sauce - gives it a little more omph.

I have made this dish several times, always to rave reviews. One trick to avoid a soggy bottom is to use a "crisper" (a round pan with holes in the bottom). I like to serve this with roasted potatoes and a nice cherry tomato salad on the side. It's a beautiful dish and tastes delicious. It'll impress your guests without costing you a ton of time in the kitchen.

Very good and super easy. Used defrosted Coho from the last of the season, lemon instead of lime, and everyone loved it. Reading all the reviews I toned down the salt but might leave it at about 3/4 of a teaspoon.

I was lucky enough to be served this dish by a friend - she added extra dill and extra lime. I can't wait to make it myself!

I wrote a review back in '03, and I'm here to say again, this recipe is DELICIOUS!! I totally disagree with those that say it's "blah". I made it again tonight, and it was very satisfying winter fare. (We're having a blizzard here in Boston!) I added a little more lime zest. And I made the sauce with light sour cream. Yummmy!

Everytime I make this recipe I have to have copies to give out at the end of the meal as everyone wants a copy of the recipe. Its hard for me to understand that some call this delicious dish blah.

I, too, thought this was dull. It was beautiful and healthful, but it really lacked flavor. My mom suggested adding a cream sauce to the salmon mixture, but I don't think I'll make again.

I made this pie again after many years and it is still great tasting and not at all blah. I used ALaskan salmon and refrigerated it for 2 plus hours and the flavors of the dill and leeks were wonderful. It's even better the next day!

Looks great - tastes "blah". I used the changes suggested by the Go Buckeyes cook dated 1/3/04, which helped but didn't save the pie. Perhaps I didn't let it chill long enough (I refrigerated it for only 1 hour, the minimum suggested), but it just didn't have much taste. A suggestion for those who decide to make this: don't mound the salmon mixture too high in the center - I did and the salmon was undercooked. I think that making the mound of salmon-leek mixture of fairly equal height throughout would help this problem. Loved the crust, and will look for another filling to use. This was an expensive lesson! I figure it cost about $20 to make this dull "pie".

I can't figure out what I did wrong, but I thought this was very "blah". It looked great, though! I made the changes suggested by the "Go Buckeyes!" cook from 1/3/04. Without them, the dish would have been even MORE blah. One suggestion for those who decide to make this, don't mound too much of the salmon mixture in the middle--Although I baked my pie for the full 30 minutes and the outside was beautifully browned, the salmon in the middle was very undercooked. The sauce, even with the Ohio cook's great suggestions - and using 1/2 of a fresh jalapeno pepper instead of the canned chiles -- was fairly tasteless. What a disappointment-I thought this would be wonderful based on other reviews. Luckily, I made it just for my husband (who loves anything I make!), and didn't try it out on company as I often do!! The crust was heavenly, so maybe I can figure out a different filling. (I refrigerated only for the minimum 1 hour; maybe longer would have improved the flavor?)

Rating: 4
Thumbs-up! This was very impressive looking but easy enough for a weeknight, as long as you factor in the 1-hour chilling time. I thought the filling might be a bit dry, and didn't want to serve with a sauce, so I added little "blops" of smoked salmon cream cheese on top of the filling before covering with pastry - an excellent addition, I thought. Next time, I'll stir it into the filling rather than just adding it on top. Will use a little less salt next time, too. Definitely one to add to my "company" list.

This was extremely easy to make, quick and delicious. Bottom crust was soggy but this was expected and didn't affect the overall taste. It didn't need a sauce, but I made a yoghourt/dill/lime juice mixture. With Epicurious' Peach White Wine Sangria before the meal, Gazpacho to start, a mesclun mix green salad with the pie and Epicurious' Lemon Mousse with Fresh Berries as dessert, we had a fantastic summer lunch!

Really great dish, lovely presentation and wonderful flavour. One note, I halved the salt as it seemed excessive, wonderful!

Very very good and very impressive for so little effort. The sauce was a little bland, I added some roasted garlic, lemon juice and capers. The pie recipe is perfect as written.

This was easy to prepare and the payoff was fantastic. So flavorful and impressive. I didn't make the sauce that is recommended, but instead combined 1 C of greek (Total brand) yogurt with 1/4 C of dill and 2 T white vinegar. Delicious. I made this for my girlfriens' birthday - she loved it. I'm going to make it as an appetizer for Thanksgiving.

This is a great and easy recipe. I used the sauce recipe but added roasted red pepper and some jalapeno for kick along w/ some minced garlic and lots of salt & pepper. It was a nice compliment to the pie. My guests loved it!

There's a reason why this is a classic. Find an excuse, any excuse, to make this showstopping pie. It will only take about ten minutes of your attention but your guests will remember it for years to come. Make it for brunch, lunch or dinner. It comes out beautifully, no matter what. Don't EVEN bother yourself with the sauce -- it's so perfect and simple without it. Even non-fishianados will ask for the recipe.

My husband has made this several times before (after it appeared on the cover). It is as delicious as it is impressive (presentation-wise). We love the taste and the rustic appearance (you do not cook in a pie plate, rather on a baking sheet :). Do not omit the lime zest! We also make the sauce, which we also like but agree, it needs "something"...

This was a very tasty dish. Very easy to make. If you like leeks-salmon-dill this is a good combination. I did not cover the pie but put strips instead.

This is awesome. Presents beautifully, tastes great, and nearly everyone loves it. I have added sauteed green onions to the leeks, and it seems to add to the flavor. I also like to occasionally put a little pimento in just for more color.

Made the whole menu for a Spring lunch on the deck with some girlfriends I haven't seen for a while. They loved the whole thing. I agree with other reviewers that the sauce was a little bland. Next time I'll spice it up and use whole jalepenos. Also, the salmon came out a little dry. How did you keep it moist?

Dumb Question: Does it cook in a pie dish or on the baking sheet?

Rating: 3
An excellent, easy to prepare dish that we've made numerous times. One nice idea, especially if serving to guests, is to use some of the leftover pastry to create a 5-7 inch fish and place it on top of the pie along with a little of the egg wash. You can also decorate the seam of the pie. Together, they help to make a beautiful presentation. Another thing—we don't usually like fish dishes as leftovers, but this is an exception. It's very good the day after.

Tasty, tasty, tasty! This easy recipe is dee-lish and the sour cream chile sauce pairs well with it. I've made it in a square puff-pasty sheet shape as well, which was a little easier and equally as impressive. The lime taste makes the dish!

This has become one of my favourite recipes although I use perhaps no more than a pound and half of salmon. Wonderful for picnics and if you don't overcook it, so it doesn't become dry, it doesn't even need a sauce. However, if necessary, I do prefer a basic sauce - the kind one serves with gravlax.

Since I did not have leeks, I substituted scallions and celery, I also added chopped up capers. My guests gave it a four forks !

I've made this a couple of times. Each time it has been good. The 1st time I halved the recipe except for the pastry, since there were only two of us, but there was too much pastry. I made the full amount the next time and we enjoyed the left overs. Definately a do again recipe and fill up the pie.

Rating: 4
Maybe the best recipe I've come across in years! Just served it to a party of 24 with unanimous rave reviews, but it's also a great everyday meal. Leftovers keep well and can be reheated just being careful not to overbrown the pastry. Also, there is nothing magical about keeping it up to 3 hours in the fridge; I prepared it in the AM and left it in the fridge until cooking and serving it for dinner. I took the advice of "A Cook on 08/07/00" and accompanied it with a yogurt dill sauce -- a perfect complement.

Excellent party dish--can be made ahead, can pop in the oven and still be a part of the group. Decorate with extra puff pastry cut with cookie cutters (I like to use stars). I also prefer a yoghurt-dill sauce.

Deeeeeelicios pie. The whole dish was very pleasing to the palet and everyone enjoyed this dish. I was quite surpised at how the dish looked when finished. We are having the leftovers tonight for dinner. A very big hit for my Sunday brunch. The accompaning sauce was a little bland.

This dish is delicious--simple, clean, beautiful flavors. It looks lovely too, as if you'd spent hours, but it's a snap to put together--the total prep is maybe 20 minutes (as long as you remember to defrost your puff pastry ahead of time). I plan to make it often!

This is a delicious recipe. I made the recipe with the quantities given here for 6 people and then made it again for two people halving the amount of salmon only and leaving everything else the same. Worked brilliantly and we had some leftover!

I made these as small appetizers, about 50 with one box of fillo and served the dill sauce on the side. They were very popular especially with my French guests. I can count on them to tell me if they really like a recipe. All in all a very impressive presentation and delightful taste. It also helps the presentation to recite the story of this recipe. Serve champagne....good champagne with this for a splendid finish!
