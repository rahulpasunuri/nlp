Haven't made in awhile, but barbecued leg/thigh pieces after marinating for two days. Only used two habaneros. Good for folks who don't want too much heat, but enough to make folks happy who like some heat. The leg/thigh works so well as it doesn't dry out. This is one of the best of the best marinades. Of course you have to have a very, very good griller manning the coals!

This isa a PERFECT and forgiving recipe. I halved the recipe and accidentally added the full 3/4 tsp of nutmeg, and it didn't ruin the marinade at all. I used boneless skinless thighs and they came out beautifully on the grill. Used three habaneros, and it was perfection--my husband and I love super spicy food, though. Served with a watermelon and feta salad and baked yams. Apart from the habaneros, all the ingredients are always in the pantry, making it easy to throw together. I marinated it over the course of two days. It's my new go-to chicken dish!

Freaking awesome jerk chicken. I didn't bother with the papaya salsa. I've had some mind-blowing jerk in the Jamaican boonies (northeast side) and this recipe satisfies my craving. The only thing that could possibly make it more authentic would be to smoke-grill over pimenton wood. Not necessary, though; if you like spicy food, try this and you won't be disappointed. I'm a heat freak and I found 5 scotch bonnets to be perfect. Definitely marinate for at least one day; it is also fine for two days for deeper flavor (the spices act as a preservative so don't worry about the chicken "going bad"). I've made this with deboned thighs and that is now my favorite chicken part for this recipe.

Layered with jerk flavors. The only jerk chicken recipe you'll ever need. Perfect- with this warning - unless you're really, really asbestos mouthed, the magic number of habaneros is two. You will feel a pleasant burn on your lips with this number. One isn't enough, but more than the two large, seeded habaneros I used the second time I made this could be hazardous. Best when marinated for 24 hours.

I love jerk chicken and this recipe holds its own. I wouldn't mind a little more green onion for more of that fresh "green" flavor, but it was still really great. 4 scotch bonnets scared me a little so I went with 4 serranos instead, even though scotch bonnets are traditional. Actually I would have liked more heat, so I will use scotch bonnets next time as the recipe intends. Either way though, Yum!

I made this recipe with 4 habanero's because I don't mind the heat and I marinated the chicken overnight. The recipe was just ok. I had some mangos that I wanted to use so made it with a mango avocado salsa. I thought the flavors were necessary together. It was a nice balance of heat, textures, sweetness. The flavor of the chicken on its own was just a little off in my opinion. I will make the salsa again on its own, however I will not make the chicken on its own.

Unexpectedly delicious! I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs, and they grilled up perfectly. (Obviously, bone in would have more flavor, but there is so much flavor in the marinade that if I made these for guests, I would still use boneless and skinless thighs. )They had that perfect char outside and tender, flavorful inside that reminds me of Chinese bbq in a way. I served it with quinoa, half of a Hass avocado, and the papaya salsa (omg delicious! reduce the onion in the salsa recipe, though).

A little extra brown sugar gives it a good zing, and if you flash cook it at first you get a slightly caramelized effect. I'd recommend for a nice dinner outside. Next time I will use this base and add some extra cayenne for some spiciness.

This was really delicious! I substituted 3 teaspoons of ground thyme for the fresh thyme and used 4 1/2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts so I ended up with rather a lot of excess marinade...oops.

I made this for a large party, and it was such a hit, people were upset when it ran out. I ground the spices fresh, used a bit less habanero, and skipped the breasts in favor of legs and wings, and it was perfect. Didn't make the salsa, but the chicken doesn't need anything extra.

I followed the recipe except used only one large habanero chile. It was just right for those that do not like food spicy hot.

I loved this Jerk marinade, I doubled the sauce and froze some. Watch those peppers...wow, I added 3 seeded habaneros and 1 jalepeno and it was spicy but delicious. The burger and grilled chicken were yummy with the orange chipotle mayo from the Jamaican Jerk Burger Recipe on this site though I did not like that jerk marinade. Mixed a bit of the same mayo into the Cabbage and Cornslaw recipe and served with baked sweet potato fries.

This is an excellent marinade - something magical happens when it hits the grill. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts which I had brined for an hour or so before marinating, then I grilled them the next day. Served with grilled corn on the cob, they made a fantastic meal. I had lots of marinade left over, so I did it again this weekend, but used a grill pan since it's too cold to BBQ. This time, I chopped the grilled chicken and tossed it with butter lettuce, cucumber, artichoke hearts, walnuts, and goat cheese - truly fabulous salad. In the future, I'm going to make this marinade in batches and keep it in the fridge for easy access - it turns boring old chicken breasts into something amazing. BTW, somehow I had it in my mind that jerk sauce is dark brown (like teriyaki sauce), so it was surprising when this marinade came out a pale tan!

Fantastic! And completely self satisfying. My Jamaican neighbour uses bottled jerk sauce. This recipe is better than any bottled stuff I've tried. For some reason, the scotch bonnets I got didn't seem to have much heat, so I had better luck adding a generous dash of dried chilies. Also, this recipe is great for wings.

I have been using this marinade for years. It is always a hit. I do not use the amount of Scotch bonnets that it calls for. I usually use one jalapeno instead. It is way too hot with the amount of Scotch bonnets called for -- I learned that lesson the first time I made it. I love to use this marinade on salmon. I cut the salmon into chunks and skewer them for the grill. Delicious. This is a staple in my recipe box.

this is a nearly perfect jerk recipe; as close to jamaica as one can get without burning allspice (pimento) in the fire. the only possible alteration necessary is the heat level so use the peppers wisely and enjoy.

Very flavorful, but so hot that the wonderful fullness of flavor from all the great ingredients was eclipsed, somewhat, by the intensity of the pepper heat. If I make this again, I intend to only use 2 peppers. Otherwise, great alternative to the old Italian dressing based chicken marinade.

Love this recipe. I modified it a bit because my local supermarket did not have scotch bonnet peppers. I used Jalepenos instead. I split the marinade in half for basting. I also prepared my chicken a different way and it was still delicious. Instead of marinating the chicken before cooking it, I par-boiled it and while it was still hot I put it in the marinade. (I know some wont agree, but dont knock it till you try it) then I grilled it on my cast iron grill on the stove. I basted the chicken with the remaining sauce. I have made jerk chicken in the past and I really like this recipe. Jalepenos are a good alternative, especially if you want to tone down the heat.

I know there are a ton of reviews--but just in case if there are folks out there like me that don't prep grocery lists ahead of time to be sure I have all that i need--here are my modifications (and it was still awesome). Lemon juice instead of lime, all one type of (white) onion, no pepper at all (didn't have), and i only had about half the amt of allspice so i used a touch of cloves also. i only marinated for 5-6 hours, and it was still super flavorful. also, i made the salsa but used mango instead of papaya. it was still a super tasty meal, and i personally put mine over a salad w red pepper, tomatoes and feta with a lemon vinegarette.

I wanted a new chicken recipe for a dinner party; I made the marinade using jalapenos instead of the habaneros since I didn't want it too spicy. I used just chicken thighs which I marinated overnight. Instead of grilling I baked in roasting pans at 375 degrees for 1 hour and it was SO good! This is a keeper, everyone loved it.

I will never buy jerk rub again. This was easy and unbelievably delicious. I was nervous about serving the chicken without knowing how salty or spicy the rub would end up being. It was amazing, though not too hot. For the kids, I scraped off the extra rub and it was fine. I used mangoes instead of papaya for the salsa recipe, and added red bell peppers and cucumber, and it was divine. My husband adores jerk chicken but he said the salsa was the star of the show. I also served avocado wedges with sea salt sprinked on top. If I weren't on a low carb diet I would have made rice and beans. I butterflied a chicken, marinated it all day in the fridge, then we grilled it over charcoal. It was ridiculously good. I had to guard one serving for leftovers for my lunch tomorrow. This is a real keeper.

I made this last night after marinading for 24 hours. I followed the recipe exactly except for the fresh ground nutmeg, This recipe is FANTASTIC!! Next time I will do all drumstics, thighs and wings. Although the chicken breasts were great they were just not spicy enough! I used all 5 scotch bonnet and habanero chiles and the spices were perfect! The mango salsa helps balance the heat! Just one thing though, I didn't know to use gloves when seeding the chile's and burned my hands! I finally googled "burned chili fingers" and found some good remedies. They were burning for 8 hours!!Next time, GLOVES,GLOVES,GLOVES!

I've made this recipe at least 6 times and it is always fantastic. As mentioned by others, the added salt isn't necessary with the soya. The secret to great, intense flavor is to make it in large baggies and freeze. So plan ahead and do this. It really benefits from lengthy marinating. Also, do your best to find the scotch bonnet peppers. They have very intense heat and make a huge difference. I use 4 or 5 and usually make 1.5 times the recipe. it is ALWAYS a huge hit.

Great recipe! Only I used skinless chicken pieces and scored the meat in the thickest parts with a knife, to let the marinade penetrate deeper. I didn't have fresh thyme or nutmeg, so I substituted with the dried ones and it was still really yummy. I used 5 Indian chilies and we didn't taste the heat at all (we're a very hot and spicy family), so next time I'll either use a few more of those or try the scotch bonnet peppers (never tried those before).

Used Serrano instead of Habanero as I could not find that type of chile.

I served this dish for a small dinner party and like another reviewer, I turned down the spice.

I made the preparations in accordance with the recipe. I was studying other jerk chicken recipes and found that there were additional ingredients such as vinegar and orange juice that could be incorporated into marinated process. I believe this would improve the marinade. When cooking I found the color that was on the grill was magnificent. The jerk marinate burns very easy so I reserved a section of my grill to place the brown chicken into a metal pan in order to cook the poultry thoroughly (aluminum foiled would also suffice). As for the taste it was good and in the future I would add more habanero peppers.

Rating: 4
This is fantastic. I have made a couple of times...following exactly with exception of bottled nutmeg rather than fresh. I make the recipe, divide it and then freeze it. When you thaw and then grill, the flavour is that much more intense and the meat is incredibly juicy. I don't even eat the skin because all the flavour is absorbed into the meat. I highly recommend making it ahead and freezing. Makes life so easy to pull it out of the freezer already prepared. A real crowd pleaser.

Delicious! I made a ton of chicken breasts and stretched them into three nights of dinner, making a chicken/mixed green/raisin salad the 2nd night, and chicken tortilla wraps with greek yogurt the 3rd. Trader Joes makes a pretty decent pre-made mango papaya salsa, which was also excellent in the tortilla wraps. I cut back on the chili quite a bit, but otherwise made the marinade as written.

This recipe is truly great. I have made this many times for all age groups and it never fails to be enjoyed. The first time I made this for my children (8 - 15 y.o.), I substituted Thai sweet chili sauce for the habaneros. I boil the remaining marinade to cook any chicken juices that have appeared during the marinating process and add a little lime juice, sugar and coconut cream/milk/oil to make a very tasty sauce (when hot) or dip (when cold). While being absolutely delicious hot, this recipe is excellent cold on picnics.

This was good, but I didn't think it was very flavorful. I used habanero peppers instead b/c we don't like extremely spicy food. Also, we didn't like the thyme flavor--it didn't seem to mix well with the other flavors (I used dried thyme and cut it down to 1/2 Tbsp). I was expecting to taste more of the allspice and cinnamon, but I couldn't taste it at all. The chicken was very moist though!

This recipe is the best grilled chicken I've ever had. I've served this many times, for many occasions, always to rave reviews.

This is a definite wow! Relying on others' advice about the adaptability of this recipe, I made a few changes based on what I had around. I'm not a fan of black pepper, so I replaced that with about 1 1/4tsp cayenne pepper, no fresh thyme, so I used dried, used an additional 2 Tbsp of brown sugar (for a total of three), didn't have limes, so I used lemon juice, didn't have scallions, so I didn't use any, didn't have any fresh peppers/chiles, so I just addeed some crushed chile peppers (not sure how much--to taste). I just dumped everything in a food processor, and then marinaded overnight. The chickien I had on hand was thighs and wings, and only amounted to about 4.2 lbs. I don't own a grill, so I baked it in the middle of the oven at 400F for about 55 minutes and it was perfect. I'll hold onto this recipe forever. To help reduce the fat, I had pulled the skin off the thighs before baking. I can honestly say that I was surprised that something so delicious could come of something with most of the fat removed. I'll be making this over and over again--but only for those who like spicy foods. (Coincidentally, I came down with a cold the day after I made it; the spices did a masterful job of clearing out my sinuses!).

Okay -- not that another great review is necessary. And ok fine it's not Carribean enough for some, but damn it's a great basic melody! This might help some new cooks. I love this recipe because it's like a classic peice of music...and you don't need to play it the same way twice to produce something very enjoyable. So tonight I did this: no blending, used some left over chopped onions, didn't have fresh peppers so I used about 1/4 cup of Joe Perry's "Rock your World" boneyard brew (has red peppers, habeneros, lime, cane syrup & a titch of chipotle), didn't have limes so I used three cubes of me "meyer's lemon" ice cubes, and was in a sweet hot mood so added about 1/3 c of dark brown sugar. Oh, and I'm trying to watch the weight and I didn't think far enough ahead, so I used boneless skinless thighs, whisked up the marinade, left in the fridge for an hour, then on the counter at room temp for an hour. And even though it's in the low 30's, I fired up the Smokey Joe with some nat'l hardwood charcoal and MAN WAS THAT GOOOOOD.

The flavor was great both times, but the grill flared up less when I did not blend the ingredients. Almost lost an arm over the grill, but worth it! ;) Using a grill that can moderate heat well definitely helps.

Really tasty recipe. The longer the time to marinade the better. I used 4 jalapenos and 1 habanero for desired spice. Hot, but not killer. A grilling favorite!

I was excited to try this after all the rave reviews but was quite disappointed. I actually love salt but thought this was too salty. It was hard to taste any of the other flavors. If I made it again I definately would reduce the salt and add a few more peppers for added heat.

I'm afraid I'm going to have to be a dissenter on this one. I didn't like it much. Too salty, the flavors were indisinguishable, and it was hard not to burn the chicken. I'll be searching elsewhere for a better version.

I'm a personal chef always looking for new spicy recipes for my "chile head" clients. This one's a winner! I use bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts and cook them at 450 for about 20 minutes to crisp the skin, then turn the heat back to about 300 to finish. Comes out perfect every time.

OH BABY!!!! This was just delicious. The only changes I made were to use 1/2 tsp dried thyme and 6 red chilis instead of scotch bonnets because the market didn't have any. I know this recipe will only be made better with the proper pepper flavor, so I cannot wait to try it again! I used legs thighs and breasts (split twice so everything would be more or less the same size). I made this at home in a city kitchen and I am looking forward to next summer when I can grill this outdoors! Served with coconut rice & pigeon peas and a modified papaya salad (with mango, pineapple, red onion & cilantro). Fantastic.

Incredicble! The carmelized grill lines on the chicken thigh skins were delicious, and the meat was so moist. Only please add note to use gloves when handling habanero peppers becase the oil can burn your cuticles for hours.

I made this dish to "get in the mood" for the Lost season 3 premiere. The chicken was moist and very easy to make. We ran out of propane, so we had to roast it. It was delicious! The papaya salsa was a great compliment to the dish. Great weeknight meal.

Delicious, yet simple recipe and looking forward to making it again. I was afraid to make it with the habanero so I used jalapeno instead. NEXT time I'll make it with the habanero (well, ok maybe just one or two of them). Served it with the papaya salsa recipe included but made it with mango instead (minus the pineapple and added red onion & cilantro) and it was great!

Rating: 4
Great dish. Heeded the warnings about too much salt and was happy with 2 teaspoons. I can not tolerate really spicy hot food, so I used cayenne instead of habanero peppers. Second time I increased to 8 cayenne peppers and will go to 10 next time (might as well use habaneros, huh?). The salsa complements the dish more when there's a good amount of spice. Second time I also removed the skin so the marinade would have better contact with the meat. Tasted better and the meat was not a bit dryer.

Rating: 4
Outstanding marinade. Preparing the marinade takes some time, but there's a big payoff. You'll need 1.5-2 limes to get 1/4 cup of juice. The recipe is salty; suggest a low-sodium soy sauce or just back off on the salt. I used jalapenos because I couldn't get anything hotter... this was a mistake! This dish needs the fire. Nevertheless, delicious. Note when grilling that the marinade burns easily, so it requires a LOT of attention. Served with the Papaya Salsa and Haitian Coleslaw for a perfect caribbean-themed BBQ.

Extremely fond of this recipe. Other than the peppers, followed to the letter. First substituted 3 jalapenos for the 5 habaneros (evil litte creatures), then 3 jalapenos and 1 habanero. Latest was 4 jalapenos and 2 habaneros. Getting warmer and yes, better. Superb on grilled country style ribs.

What a wonderful recipe. Doubled the marinade & used 3 good sized jalapenos instead of habaneros as I've had a few painful experiences with them. It was not overpowering, but just enough heat to make us happy, otherwise by the book. Slow barbequed legs & skinless thighs over mesquite. Had alot of unused marinade left over so used with white rice & that was a big hit. Very much like a spicy pesto. Next time will make the papaya salsa. Chicken was deeeelicious hot or cold for lunch!

The chicken and salsa were both delicious. I made it as written with the following minor changes: 3 1/2 chilies, substituted 1/2 Tb. dried thyme for the fresh thyme, and 1 tsp black pepper instead of 2. It was plenty spicy. I also used only boneless and skinless chicken thighs.

Too much salt. I only added 1 TBSP in addition to the soy and i still had to add additional onion and brown sugar to keep it from overwhelming the lovely flavors

I didn't add any habaneros because we are just learning to eat spicy food (i know that I may have missed the whole point, but oh well), and this was still amazing. There are so many different flavors, we didn't miss the spiciness at all. Very good! I accidentally made too much marinade so we had it the next day as well! By the way, we didn't have a girl so I just popped it in the oven at about 400 (195C).

it tastes just like the jerk chicken i had when vacationing in negril! while making this marinade, i kept wondering, why would anyone chop up all those ingredients when it's just going to go into the blender? so i coarsely chopped everything, and then threw it into my cuisinart with the lime juice (i used 2 limes). the flavor is phenomenal, and although the marinade sounds like a lot of trouble to make, it's not. the results are worth it!

Rating: 4
Excellent flavor! I marinated boneless, skinless breasts and thighs for 2 days before grilling and served the chicken in wraps with papaya/mango salsa and a cilatro aioli for a party. Used jalapenos instead of scotch bonnets so it wasn't too hot. The wraps held up great and were absolutely delicious. Will definitely use this marinade again.

Quite delicious, but I agree that the work involved was very time consuming. When I couldn't find papaya at my local grocer, (apparently they aren't native to the upper midwest), I substituted mango and added cilantro for the salsa.

I think this is the first time I have ever rated anything 4 forks. But this was incredible. My husband was skeptical at first (based on the smell of the marinade), but then absolutely loved it. I used 1/2" pork cutlets and they turned out great. The only other change I made was to use 2 jalapenos and 2 serano peppers for the scotch bonnets. I will *defninitely* make this again. I had extra marinade, and thought it would be yummy tossed with pasta and grilled chicken breast.

This is one of the best grilled chicken dishes on this site and it truly merits all the rave reviews! After making several times, I have made a few modifications to this already stellar recipe: increased garlic to 6 cloves; used 3 large jalapenos with seeds plus 1/2 tsp. cayenne (plenty spicy without being fiery hot) in lieu of habaneros; juice and fine zest from 1 lime; decreased olive oil and added 1 tbsp. sesame oil; decreased salt to 2 tsp.; added 1 tbsp. molassas; added a 1-inch piece minced ginger; doubled the fresh thyme; and added 1/2 tsp. ground cloves, otherwise followed the recipe. Though these changes may not make this authentic Jamaican jerk, they certainly make for one over-the-top marinade! I always marinate over night so the chicken is infused with flavour. Seared first over med-high heat, then cooked on low indirect heat on a gas BBQ with the lid down and basted with the marinade (boiled for 5 minutes first), this chicken is delicious to the max, moist and tender with crisp caramelized skin. Have also used the marinade for pork tenderloin with excellent results. This is a must-make recipe for anyone who enjoys Jamaican-style food!

Loved this recipe, however had to do some tweeking in order to make it to my liking. I made this three times before I served it to a party of 60. Here are my alterations: used serrano peppers instead of Habanero peppers. It was way too spicy with the habanero peppers, even when I only added one Habanero pepper...still way too spicey, especially for a large group. Used jar thyme (I couldn't find fresh in any grocery stores)-- it was fine. Used boneless chicken breasts cut into small pieces for kabobs. Finally, for the papaya salsa-- I used mango's from a jar...and it was fine. I'm sure fresh would be better, but jarred was okay too. My guests raved about this recipe...it's definately a keeper!

Well, not that this recipe needs another review, but I just thought I would confirm that it was very good (and easy). Mine wasn't very spicy because all I had in the house was a couple of jalapenos. The skinless chicken thighs were very moist. And I've frozen half the marinade to use another time. I think this would make really great jerk chicken wings - served with lots of beer!

Soooo good! Made it with some substitutions (lemon juice instead of lime) and used some homegrown (dried) and also storebought chiles, because that's what I had on hand. Marinated skinless thighs for only 4 hours. REALLY great, with mango chutney to cool the mouth! Will make again for sure!

This recipe was incredible! I will definitely make it again. In the preparation, instead of using 2 resealable bags, I used one tall kitchen trash bag (clean!)and then just turned it over periodically. It was very easy to handle that way.

This dish was AWESOME! I followed the recipe almost completely. Only change I made was for 1 of the habanero peppers, instead of seeding it and steming it like the others, I added it with seeds and all for more spice (my guest and I enjoy spicy food). It was wonderful. The salsa complimented it VERY well and toned down the heat a bit. Served with a mixed green salad and a light pasta salad from the grocery store for a quick and wonderful dinner!

Yum! I was a little wary that the flavors in the marinade would be killed after cooking the chicken, but it definitely wasn't so. I used this recipe to make grilled chicken kebobs with sweet potato, summer squash, pineapple, and sweet onion. They took about 1/4 the time to cook, and damn...they were delicious. Well worth the mosquito bites!

Extremely flavorful. I tweaked the marinade because I needed to make about 1 1/2 X's the recipe- did so by adding, among other things, adding a wee bit of molasses and orange juice. I think the spice proportions were perfect, assuming you love flavor and good seasoning. I used chicken breasts, marinated only five hours (pressed for time), and served it as fajitas, complete with sauteed bell peppers & onions, tortillas, cheese, sour cream, salsa, etc. Served with black beans and rice.

Although this recipe is a one-day dish (due to the marination time), the actual active time is not bad at all. The marinade is easy to make. I served this with the papaya salsa, jicama slaw & curried rice for a nice summer meal. One caution: You have to watch the chicken very, very carefully on the grill. The marinade makes it much easier to burn the chicken.

I served this dish with papaya salsa over coconut rice and received rave reviews from my family. The mild rice and sweet salsa balanced out the heat in the jerk seasoning perfectly. I used boneless chicken breast and grilled over low heat for a much shorter time than the recipe called for. Other than that, I didn't change a thing. This was the first time I had used habanero peppers in a recipe. Word to the wise: wear gloves!

i've been making this recipe 3 or 4 times over the past few years and wouldn't use any other jerk recipe i've found. with all that's in it, the flavours are so complex. i'm thinking about adding ginger the next time around. also, use real charcoal, not those brickets, makes a difference.

Followed the recipe exactly except, when I found I'd forgotten to buy the Habaneros, I substituted 3 whole Ancho in Adobo Sauce chilis that I found in my larder.

This was excellent. I think the instructions for cooking are slightly overcomplicated - we just bbq'd them until cooked (about 15minutes). I made it with a mango/avocado salsa instead of the papaya salsa which was perfect. I am looking forward to making this again for a large crowd this weekend!

One more accolade for this recipe! We used boneless skinless breasts, used 4 jalapenos and marinated overnight. Total grilltime on high (with 90 degree turns for grillmarks) approximately 16 minutes. The flavors of this marinade were just right-I would have preferred using the habaneros, but the kids prefer a tame version and the jalapenos gave just a hint of heat. We served this with our own favorite version of black bean mango salsa and it is definitely a keeper!

I guess it's "piling on" at this point, but just wanted to add our praise for this recipe to the mix. Over the years, we've tried lots of jerk recipes, and this is my new favorite (my old favorite was from The Sugar Reef Caribbean Cookbook and is similar in many ways, but more involved.) I agree with some of the other reviewers that with chilies, the heat can vary widely, so that part is always a bit of a gamble.

Just had to add my voice to the chorus of accolades, after having some of the leftovers for lunch. I made this for a Cooking Light Supper Club meeting with a Jamaican theme.

I went to Jamaica this January and it's as good, if not better, than anything I had there. A keeper!

THIS RECIPE DESERVES FIVE FORKS!! It is simply PHENOMENAL!!! Since I served it at lunch, I made it into a wrap. So here is my version which my husband swears is one of the best things I have ever made! (Who doesn't like to hear that?) For the marinade, I used 4 habaneros seeded and deveined, and slightly more thyme. Don't worry about it being too spicy- it achieves absolutely just the right balance of spice and heat. Instead of grilling (since that's not an option in a Manhattan studio), I pan-seared the skinless chicken breast for a minute on each side in very hot olive oil with two extra garlic cloves, and finished it off in the oven at 425 deg for about 5 minutes. At the end, I slapped a very thin slice of monterey jack cheese on each chicken breast in the oven, waited a minute for it to melt, then took it out, cut the chicken up into thin slices, and rolled the pieces of chicken up with thin sliced tomatoes into tortilla wraps with a little mayo. This was an incredible dish, and I will be sure to try making it with the salsa next time!

I made this last night for my boyfriend and his parents (this was my first time meeting the parents so I wanted to make a good first impression) and it was a big hit. I was a little nervous about using four of the scotch bonnet chiles, and it was spicy but not overwhelmingly so. I grilled the chicken on a gas grill over low heat and they turned out very moist and juicy. By the way, I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I also served the accompanying salsa; however, I didn't have a papaya so I used a mango instead, and it was still delicious. The coconut rice from this site balanced out the meal nicely. Will definitely make it again!

Fantastic! My dinner gets picked their chicken pieces clean. I couldn't get either recommended chili so I used serrano chilis (4 w/~1/2 the sedds) and it was wonderful. It was still hot, but not so hot that anyone had trouble eating it. I'd skip the salsa next time, though.

To the cook from Houston: I have two suggestions that may help you. First, I sometimes make this with boneless (skin-on or off) chicken thighs. That way you can get away with cooking the meat for much less a time, thereby reducing the chance you'll burn it. Next, if you really do prefer bone-in chicken, you'll have no choice but to get your flame even less hot than before. If you like, line your grill with foil as a sort of heat diffuser. Cooking it indirect (as you did) on very low heat for a longer amount of time yields wonderful, moist, and succulent results for me. Happy cooking!

To the cook from St. Louis - I sometimes have trouble getting chicken crispy on the gas grill. It just doesn't seem to get as hot as the old charcoal grill. I will usually bake chicken in the oven at 425 degrees for about 30 minutes to crisp the skin and then move it to the grill for the rest of the cooking time. That way you still get the both the crisp skin and the grilled flavor. It also allows me to prep the side dishes in the kitchen without running in and out to check on the chicken. Hope this helps!

Guys...this is one of the most fragrant, tasty chicken dishes you can make on the BBQ. USE HALF CHICKENS...NOT PIECES!! Put a splash or two of Tortuga Rum in the mixture, and cook that chicken "slow and low" using a combo of hickory and cherry wood ( the real stuff in Jamiaca is smoked with pimento wood - this is close). Might want throw a little salt on the birds when you put them on the grill. Open a Red Stripe..you'll think you're on Negril Beach.

Good recipe, though it's a fairly standard jerk spice seasoning. For the question re: what are Habaneros/Scotch bonnets -- they are the hottest peppers known to mankind, rated at over 1,000,000 scoville units, I understand. You can substitute jalapenos instead, or really any kind of spicy pepper, though traditional jerk would entail the use of scotch bonnets only.

This dish was absolutley delicious and very festive. The chicken has a complex smokey sweet flavor, and just the right amount of heat. I made a jicama slaw to go with it, but would probably make a cabbage based slaw next time. A cooling, vegetable based side dish of some kind should definitely accompany. Red Stripe beer tops it off perfectly.

We used turkey tenderloins instead of chicken and had to sub jalapenos for habaneros as we couldn't find the habaneros. Otherwise, we followed the recipe exactly and were very pleased. Plan to try it on other types of meat soon....

Terrific recipe--and yes, the key is a moderately warm fire and let the chicken cook SLOW!! Wanna save some time? Purchase a jerk marinade and jazz it up with extra heat, spices, etc.

We served this at a dinner party and everybody loved it. I served this with the Spinach and Mango Salad with Candied Pecans as a first course, also delicious and found on this site. I used boneless chicken breasts, doubled the marinade recipe, but used only 6 habanero chilis and it was plenty spicy for us. The papaya salsa was beautiful and a nice addition.

Maybe because I roasted instead of grilling, it didn't taste like anything special to me. I hate to be the odd person out, since all of the previous reviewers loved it, so I'll give it another whirl, this time on the barby. (The salsa was great - I used mango instead of papaya, and added cilantro.

I am reviewing this recipe for the second time. I've made this chicken ~4 times now, and it is delicious. However...the last three times we have found it too hot with all four Habanero peppers. The first time, we must have had a milder variety of pepper? We served it for guests last night, and we all found it too overwhelmingly hot. Next time, I will make it with only 2 Habaneros. Also - reminder, use gloves when chopping peppers and wash all surfaces carefully afterwards. They are very hot and even if you touch your mouth or eyes several hours after you've touched a cut pepper..it will STING or put you into a coughing fit!

I really appreciate everyone's comments on this site...the rave reviews are why I made this and I am so glad. AMAZING! I didn't use a blender for marindade, just stirred it all up...it was great! I will definitely make this again and again.

What a fabulous marinade! I only used 1 haberano chili and the heat was just perfect for us. We made fajitas out of the chicken and what a treat it was. Has anyone ever used this marinade on any type of steak...for fajitas. I think I'll try that.

Fantastic marinade. I think this recipe would work well and any type of chicken or pork. Certainly a keeper.

I rated this recipe in 07/02 and loved it. I froze some chicken in the marinade that night. My husband & I just had the chicken that sat in the marinade in the freezer for months ..JUST AS GOOD. Next tiem I will mnake lots and freeze for quick week night dinners. MY first rating read..."After reading the other reviews, I added all 5 peppers. I was great for me, I love spicy hot foods. My husband said it was too hot for him and I would never serve it to company at this temperature. I recommend 3-4 peppers.

I cooked this exactly as the cook from Austin,TX recommended (see first rating on 5/21/02). I used 2 scotch bonnet and 2 habanero chiles. I wore gloves and removed stems, seeds and veins. It yielded a nice, subtle "heat." FABULOUS!

Rave reviews for this recipe at our recent Caribbean theme party. I followed the recipe exactly and there were no complaints about the chicken being too spicy. As a matter of fact, next time I make it I will probably add another habanero or two. This recipe took me back to Jamaica! Now if I could only get Red Stripe in Germany! :-)

I made this with serrano peppers, as I could not get habaneros. I made it to the letter. Two families of 8 people, including 2 four year olds all LOVED it. I am going to make it again, with habaneros, seeds and all, and more garlic. I have been ranting about this recipie since!

Yummy! This recipe is to die for! I made it for a cocktail party and did cubes of chicken on skewers (2 per) instead of whole pieces, and I also did fried tofu, which turned out so well that a few vegetarians wanted the recipe. Chicken was moist and delicious- can hardly wait to make this one on the BBQ in the summertime!

I came across this while looking for a recipe where I could use the habanero peppers that my husband and I grew this year. Am I ever glad I found it! This was some of the best chicken we have ever grilled - very moist and flavorful. We have baked the chicken in the oven and it was really great, too. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This dish was real good and I suggest making it. First, preparation was a breeze. Chop the ingredients and throw them into a blender; a real no brainer. I used chicken brest because I love eating brest meat. The only problem I had with this recipe is that the marinade seemed grity when I chewed it. Anyway, prep was easy and results were stinking good!

Rating: 4
Made this for my birthdayparty. It was a big hit. I used less hot peppers, but will definitely add some more the next time I make it. It was fairly easy and I made it one night before, so the taste would be more intense when reheated. Served it with blue sky imperial rice, a ricedish from cuban descent and a green salad..yum

I roasted this in the oven per the baking instructions and it was really great. It got nice and brown and gooey and was just as good as grilled. It's also incredible served cold.

Everyt'ing is Irie, mon! Loved this. The only thing I added was crystallized ginger. We served this with Puerto Rican style black beans and rice, an avocado/mango salsa, and of course Red Stripes! My one regret is that the market I visited was out of habaneros, and instead of going someplace else, I settled for serranos, which did NOT give this the heat it deserves. Next time I'll make the effort to get habaneros.

Rating: 4
Wow! We really loved this chicken. We used 4 habaneros, and it was REALLY HOT--I think I may have inadvertantly bought the extra hot Red Savina variety. But the flavors were still so interesting. My husband, who loves hot food, thought it was one of the best marinades ever.

Rating: 4
This was great, we really enjoyed it. The unique mix of savoury flavours with the spices was excellent. We only used 3 peppers and it was fine, no pain involved in eating it, just mild spice. However we were careful to seed and devein with gloves!

This recipe was great! I used boneless skinless chicken too. I do slow cook as recommended here, but used less time and basted the chicken with the marinade. I used fresh Thai finger peppers from my garden. Nice heat, but I would have used more. 5-6 is probably a good guess if you want some real kick! I made the salsa, but used mangos as recommended. Liked the salsa, but would use the Asian mangos next time (sweeter then the South American kind). I served the Jerk Chicken with Cumin Glazed Carrots (found here), Saffron Rice and a salad of mixed greens, red onion, avocado, feta cheese and a balsamic vineagrette. I had chocolate cake for dessert. Served spicy Chianti and beer. Everyone loved it!

Rating: 4
Made this using skinless boneless breasts and thought it was fabulous. Also used the marinade for wings on the grill and they were a hit! Five habaneros were perfect - enough heat to need a beer with the meal, but not so much heat that you needed a six pack! :)

Made this for a fourth of july party and it was a huge hit. Don't skimp on the habaneros, they definitely add a flavorful kick without being too spicy for most people. I will make again.

it was good but i forgot to make the salsa. i also forgot to add the salt, which actually came out good without it. I thought the marinade could have been a little sweeter and imagined the chicken caramelized. it was still good. next time i will definatly try it with the mango, not papaya, salsa.

I made this recipe for a Caribbean theme dinner party that my husband and I recently hosted. Five habaneros were used for the marinade and no one complained of too much heat. We grilled the chicken on very low heat for about 35 minutes after quickly searing. My guests absolutely raved over the flavor of the chicken. I prefer mango to papaya so mango salsa was used as an accompaniment to the chicken. The evening began with rum punch (complete with orange/cherry garnish and paper umbrella) and black bean salsa served with Terra chips. The rest of the menu included avocado and red onion salad with cilantro vinaigrette (Epicurious), saffron rice with carrots and celery, and roasted sweet potato chunks finished with fresh lime juice, cumin, and chili powder. Key lime pie with coconut macadamia nut crust and raspberry coulis completed the meal. The evening was a hit and I will definitely be making the jerk chicken again and again.

We've made this twice. The first time, roasted in the oven, it was not a hit. The second time, barbequed following the directions for charcoal grilling, it was wonderful.

Rating: 3
Spicy and good. I did think it was too salty (and I even had cut down the salt to less than a tablespoon). However, maybe it was the slight saltiness from using kosher chicken breasts (even after rinsing thoroughly)?! In any case, I will be trying this again. Loved the salsa - used all mangoes and also added cilantro. Try it - it's great with the chicken.

I used chicken wings and served this at a party, and it was a HUGE hit. I will make this again and again. I used four Habaneros and will use either five or six next time or throw a couple in with all the seeds and all.

I could only find jalapenos instead of habeneros. The chicken was not spicy at all but had an amazing taste. We cooked skinless legs and skinless thighs (marinated for a day and a half.) Both were awesome. Definately a keeper!!

This recipe was made for boneless, skinless chicken thighs! They worked much better for me than 'regular' chicken. Very moist, flavorful and fast to grill. I used one jalapeno pepper because that is what I had on hand. This is a keeper. My husband likes it with or without the salsa. I like it with the salsa.

As the others say, definitely go for at least 4 peppers! We marinated boneless chicken breasts overnight and cooked on the grill (didn't worry about the direct/indirect heat nonsense) and it was great! 3 and 1/2 forks!

I agree this is an awsome recipe and as much as I was worried about using 5 habaneros I did, because every said ( dont be afraid ) and they were right...........but make sure you use gloves, my fingers burned for two days. The flavors are SO good , definitly a keeper.

Made this last week and we Love this! Didn't have the brown sugar to my suprise, so added a little regular sugar and honey. Came out great! Making it again tonight (forgot I didn't rate it while I was looking up the recipe again so I didn't forget this time! 8-) Not a fan of the salsa though, would recommend some grilled pineapple or fresh mango and rice with this to keep the exotic flavors going.

I grilled this (too dry) and then roasted another batch (perfectly moist). After the previous comments about spiciness, I hesitantly used all of the called for habeneros -- and was surprised at how mild the finished meat was. As a California girl, I've made much better (and easier) spicy chicken. But, I might make it again- for Midwestern relatives.

Made this recipe, accompanied by the Papaya salsa and black bean & rice salad tonight. Husband said it is his favorite recipe of the past year!

I thought that this recipe was very authentic tasting. I could tell from past experience that 4-5 haberneros added could potentially melt steel! I used two and found it just able to serve, one pepper would be better next time. But the flavor in the marinade is wonderful...yea Mon!

yummmm...even my father-in-law, who won't eat anything "different" liked it! Used jalapenos instead - agree that Scotch Bonnets would be way too much for our palates. Loved the mix of traditionally sweet spices. May become a grill-time staple here!

Are you people nuts? 4-5 habanero chilies are deadly. Even without seeds and carefully prepared (I even reduced the amount to 2) this amount of habanero will make hair grow out of your ears. I am teasing, I made a horrific mistake with this recipe, I tried it with chicken breasts without skin or bone, marinated it as per instructions, I have never smelled anything as good! My husband grilled them to absolute perfection and just as I was taking the first bite, I realized, but it was too late, my child was chewing away; remarking (calmly at first): "It's a tad spicy don't you think?" Then the look of horror! I convinced her that therapy was a better alternative to litigation. Be careful with the habanero chili, it is the hottest chili on the scale.

My family loved this. I got only one piece out of all the chicken we prepared. I substituted 1 jalapeno pepper for the other peppers and mangos for the papaya. It takes awhile to prepare, but well worth it.

I made this marinade without the chilis because my young children don't eat food that's too "picy", but even without the chilis this was a great marinade, a really great blend of flavors and it deeply flavored the chicken.

Fantastic! Made this for Father's Day and everyone raved about it. Unable to find Scotch Bonnet or habanero chiles, so used 5 jalapenos instead, otherwise followed the recipe. Cooked on a gas barbeque and the chicken was very moist, flavorful and perfectly spiced/seasoned. Loved the cooling papaya salsa - added a large diced peach - excellent blend of flavors. Served with Grilled New Potatoes with Parmesan/Herbs, Baked Cherry Tomatoes with Parmesan Topping, and Orange, Tomato, Broccoli, Sweet Onion Salad with Orange Vinaigrette - all recipes from this site - a very colorful and tasty dinner. This chicken is outstanding - a real winner!!!

This was a hit! My dad had never had jerk chicken and was already asking when I would make it again. I would put in less salt next time - maybe half. I used an electric indoor grill and it worked great. It burned the marinade a little bit, but the chicken came out tender and perfect. I substituted 3 mangos for the papaya and it was a hit as well and accompanied the jerk perfectly.

This was fabulous. I only used 3 habanero chiles as I was afraid it would be too spicy using more, but the marinade had just the right amount of spice for me. The taste of the chicken when cooked was just delicious. Even my small children ate it! (I took off the skin for them as it would have been too spicy for them) I didn't grill the chicken as neither my husband nor I can ever get grilled chicken to cook correctly so I baked it just as the recipe suggests you can. The chicken was so tender! I will most definitely make this again.

I made this recipe for my brother who loves Jerk Chicken but is very particular about the sauce. He raved about it. In fact he had me make it for 2 weeks in a row. We cooked this in the oven as well as in a slow cooker. They both turned out great. I will make this over and over again.

Very tasty and easy to make for a crowd. Directions for gas grill, however, don't work well. Difficult to brown on medium without lid, as heat drops quickly. Better to do on medium with lid closed; then reduce to low after browned. Enjoy!

I used 2 serrano peppers for the heat, roasting 4 boneless/skinless chicken breasts in the oven, but otherwise followed this recipe to-the-letter - the results were TRULY extraordinary.

Fantastic! Be meticulous about seeding the scotch bonnets; I wasn't, and had to mix up an extra batch of marinade, sans the peppers, to combine with the original recipe, just so the chicken wouldn't incinerate my guests. All around, though, an easy, different way to prepare barbecued chicken. Serve with the papaya salsa, coconut shrimp, and rum punch for a meal that will wow your guests.

Four to five Scotch Bonnet chilis? Are they kidding???? Are they trying to kill us? I made another recipe from the May 2002 issue of Gourmet and used only one of these babies for a 4-serving dish.

Don't have a grill but used the marinade over night (minus a few tablespoons)- I added some honey and brown sugar and doubled the cayene. I then cooked the chicken in the oven on 250 until almost done (about hour and half) then basted in the marinade and turned on the broiler to brown the top and carmelize. It turned out AWESOME - falling off the bone. Delicious flavor - everyone raved!!! Highly recommend
