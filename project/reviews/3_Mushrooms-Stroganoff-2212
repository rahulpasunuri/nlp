I'm not a huge mushroom fan but this was delicious. I added celery, beef broth and thickened with a little milk & cornstarch. I didn't have sour cream so I used the creme fraiche that I had on hand. It was awesome comfort food served over egg noodles on a chilly autumn evening.

This recipe is good, but I think that it's a little bland. It tastes much better if you add Worcestershire and beef bouillon.

I was looking for something different to do with pasta. The ease of this recipe caught my eye. However, it was a little disappointing. I didn't have a problem with it getting gummy. It just lack taste. I will try it again with additional spices as suggested by other cooks, i.e. thyme, paprika. I think I'd use sherry rather than wine. And using cream cheese sounded interesting. The recipe as it is is rather tastless.

yummy. Started with more butter, added some celery and several types of onions to make it more fun. Simultaneously was boiling white beans which had already soaked overnight with dried mushroom mix. Had 1/2 pound fresh chantrelles--how could things go wrong? Then kept the dried mushroom/beans separate in another pot boiling while I played with the mail stroganoff. Added the garlic, then the chantrelles. More white wine, then mixed them all together using generous sour cream. Served it over white basmati rice.

Delicious and easy to make. I swapped the nutmeg for a teaspoon of paprika, which is more traditional for stroganoff.

Awful! Sticky, thick, bland, just plain boring.

I liked the idea, but here's what's wrong with this recipe: 1. Onions should be sautéed first, before adding the garlic. Brown onions on high heat for 2-3 minutes, then reduce heat to medium and sautée until translucent with a brownish color (approximately 7-10 minutes). Browning the onions releases the most powerful onion taste and leaves you with a sweeter, sauteed onion taste. Then add garlic and mushrooms and cook on medium heat until the mushroom is sautéed (adding tablespoon portions of water as needed to keep from sticking to the bottom of the pan). Add 1/8 - 1/4 cup water with the white wine, and reduce to low heat (this step helps to evenly distribute the flavor throughout the sauce). We live in France, so we use crême fraiche instead of sour cream. If that is an option for you, I highly recommend it. Season to taste and enjoy!

I read prior reviews before preparing this dish. The most common complaints were lack of flavor and a sticky consistency. With this in mind I took the advice of more than a few people an added worcestershire sauce along with the wine, as well as not allowing too much of the mushroom liquid to evaporate. You do need some liquid to dissolve the flour in, after all. I added thyme along with the mushrooms and fresh parsley at the end. Beyond that, and the omission of the nutmeg, the recipe was executed as is. The result was a wonderfully flavorful dish, smooth, which also reheated well for my lunch today. When I make this again, I think I'll use a combo of fresh and reconstituted mushrooms, to add some variety of flavor and texture.

It is missing something. I used vegetable stock in place of wine, creme freche in place of sour cream and added madera wine. I also used different types of mushrooms; button, shiitake, chantrelle and shimeji.

I thought this was a great recipe! However, I did not have wine on hand so I used chicken stock; I substituted low-fat sour cream for fat-free; I added dashes of dry mustard and worcestershire sauce; and served over brown rice. It was delicious and not dry by any means! My husband enjoyed it but suggested an addition of another veggie so I might add some asparagus next time.

I tried this with Brandy rather than the wine. It gives it a heartier richer flavor.

I love this recipe. I add a bit of chicken soup mix for a bit more flavor, along with some pepper and a little salt. It is very flavorful and doesn't taste like a low fat recipe at all!

I also omitted the flour and used 1/4 cup beef broth in place of 1/2 the wine amount My husband and I loved it! Easy and delicious and just as good the next day!

Very flavorful. Added a pinch of salt (of course), black pepper, a little each of dry mustard, thyme, and paprika, then fresh parsley at the end. Used a little bit more wine, a couple of tablespoons of milk, then subbed half of the sour cream with plain lowfat yogurt. Halved the recipe for lunch and it was a perfect, easy meal.

Used portobello mushrooms. Very good indeed.

Followed recipe for the most part, just substituted cream cheese for half of the sour cream (I used regular sour cream rather than low far), threw in some diced chicken that I sauteed in the onions and garlic before adding the mushrooms and added a few dashes of Worchestershire sauce toward the end. Serve over red Camargue rice. We all enjoyed it, found the sauce rich and tasty, definitely not too dry. Easy enough recipe with ingredients I tend to have on hand most of the time. Will make this again.

I was looking for a recipe for a tofu stroganoff I had at the Full Moon Resort in the catskills in New York this winter and used this recipe but added panko-crusted tofu which makes this into a hearty winter vegetarian meal. I also used wide egg noodles instead of linguine. It was great and even my husband loved it and he never liked tofu or mushrooms too much previously.

Rating: 3
This dish is a great vegetarian alternative to the beef stroganoff. I used flat, linguini-style rice noodles instead of regular linguini for a healthier, wheat-free alternative.

I made a half recipe, having 1lb of unused mushrooms, and was pleasantly surprised after reading some of the negative reviews. I followed this nearly exactly, and thought it was a really nice easy weeknight meal. My husband who doesn't like mushrooms thought it was great. We served it over fresh Italian bread, with a salad.

Since so many prior reviewers said that the dish didn't keep well, I modified it to make two entree-sized servings by using 1 1/2 lbs of crimini mushrooms and leaving the rest of the recipe pretty much as stated. However, I did eliminate the flour, used regular sour cream, and served over brown rice. I thought it was delicious and will definitely be making it again.

I prepared this dish as per the recipe and it was delicious! Those reviewers below with saucing problems may have evaporated too much water out of the mushrooms. My dish was neither sticky nor gloopy the next day. (How else could one tablespoon of flour make everything so lumpy?) I find mushrooms absorb salt during cooking--these mushrooms will taste saltier than the sauce. Careful salting of this dish is required. This was great as a side dish. As a main dish I may try some lemon juice, grated lemon rind, and thyme as an addition to the sauce next time.

Loved the idea of this recipe, however substituted a few things. Removed the flour all together after reading other reviews of the sauce being clumpy the next day. Replaced wine with chicken broth and used 2 shallots instead of onion and also substituted half cream cheese with the sour cream - did not boil down as recipe suggested, however brought broth to a boil once I fried the mushrooms with shallots and garlic, then added sour cream/cream cheese and simmered for 5-10mins. Topped this onto tortellini which was delicious - very rich sauce!

Bummer - my first full-fledged Epicurious "YUCK!" I used chicken broth (didn't have any wine, but I doubt it could have saved the dish) and added a little mustard and thyme. It was awful, bland and gloopy. Oh well, after 4 years of great food, I can't be too upset.

All I could taste was the sour cream, which really doesn't complement pasta. We had to pile on salt, which kind of defeats the purpose of light cooking. And after refridgeration, it turned into a big clump of paste.

I live in a co-operative college house and used this recipe as a guideline for dinner for 30 people. It was delicious and everyone liked it. Notes: we didn't have time to boil off the mushroom liquid, so didn't have a problem with it being dry. I also added salt, mustard, paprika and thyme. Oh my goodness! so delicious.

It appears that the consensus is that it is bland, probably because the salt is missing. Great only if you are on a salt free diet for medical reasons. A small amount of salt is necessary in the diet, as well as for flavor. I use a red colored SEASON SALT, which I sprinkle lightly across the top of food; that way I can see how much I am using. It greatly improves the taste, and it seems you need to use less of it, than with regular salt.

With the sourcream I also add cream cheese, to me it gives it a nice smooth sauce, and a lite new taste

Bland and uninspiring. It took so much work to make it taste good that there was not point in this recipe.

I have made this a couple of times, using modifications suggested by other reviewers (I use 1.5 pounds mushrooms, 3/4 cup wine, and half the pasta, for 2 large portions), and we really like it. Next time, I'll try it with a mixture of plain and wild mushrooms.

Good, though somewhat bland. I made the recipe as written except I used extra wide egg noodles. BTW, evaporating most of the mushroom liquid took forever. I love mushrooms and thought the amount was just right. I did not think the dish was dry, possibly because I don't like having noodles swimming in tons of sauce. After doing some research, I tried to improve the flavor of this recipe with the following variation. Though it certainly was better, it still wasn't quite 3 forks, so I'm giving up on tweaking this recipe! I added 2t paprika to the flour, doubled the white wine, added 2t Dijon mustard to the sour cream, halved the nutmeg, and used 1t salt. Before stirring in the sour cream, I added 2c low-sodium broth and cooked off most of the liquid. I admit I was disappointed that all those changes did not fix the recipe.

This is a great side dish! I have made it a couple of times for my family, and they really enjoy it! We get tired of the same old potato/rice scene and the flavors of this go well with anything!

I also found the recipe to be a bit dry. To perk it up I added 1/2 can mushroom soup, a bit of water and extra white cooking wine. Overall, a great recipe.

Found this dish to be delious and satisfying after a few alterations. I used beef bouillon to add extra flavor. I didn't evaporate the mushroom liquid which created more sauce. I also used egg noodles.

after tasting before serving, it seemed too bland so I added 1/4 tsp ground thyme and a little garlic powder. It perked the mushrooms up. I would serve it again with these additions.

I made this recipe substituting leeks for the onions and increasing the wine to 3/4 cup. I found it to be extremely bland - maybe it's due to the non-fat sour cream. The only way I would try making it again is with light or regular sour cream and maybe some fresh herbs to boost flavor.

Simple to make, very filling. My husband and I used 1.5 lbs of mushrooms instead of the suggested 2 lbs, and found it more than enough. More sauce would've been nice, as previously noted...maybe use the same recipe with half the amount of linguine?

I tried it without the nutmeg because it sounded better that way. It was really easy. The leftovers were a bit dry, but hey - they're leftovers! Next time, I'll probably make it a bit saucier.

I used no-yolks egg noodles and "light" sour cream instead of non-fat. It tasted great, and was very substantial for a vegetarian dish. My formerly skeptical husband went back for seconds. I rated it 2 forks, however, because it was a little dry - I like a "saucier" stroganoff. The wide egg noodles may be at fault - next time I will try it with skinny noodles and experiment with the sauce. I had no problem with the nutmeg.

I thought this was quite good. I only used 1 # mushrooms and that was plenty. Also, I added 1 cup peas to the last few minutes of cooking the pasta. This made it more of an all-in-one. When I make this again, however, I'll try it without the nutmeg.
