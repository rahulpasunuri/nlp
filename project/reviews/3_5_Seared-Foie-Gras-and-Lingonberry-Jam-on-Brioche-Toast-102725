such a simple preparation...and elegant as well. Be sure to pull the veins out of the foie gras after you slice it. No flour or oil needed, just a hot sear.

Christmas Eve 2006-When I went on line to D'Artgnan to order foie gras for this one I found that they were offering Foie Gras Medallions with truffle with orders, so used this to make this recipe. Combo of the foie gras, lingonberry jam and brioche was great and so fast - not sure foie gras from scratch would be better!

foie gras is torture... to find at a reasonable price. but with the lingonberry jam, it's worth it.

Aside from the fact that you can almost find something wrong with just about every food type (even vegetables are handpicked by migrant farm workers who are overworked and underpaid), I am truly a fan of foie gras. I modified this dish to serve as a first course, using Grade A Duck foie gras from the US. The dish was outstanding. The toast with lingonberry jam were just the right accompaniments to the rich, buttery liver. We almost didn't want to go on to the next course! Oh, and by the way, no flour on the foie gras, cooked 30 seconds on each side in a hot pan with a touch of Canola oil. Perfect!

I love foie gras so I am biased. This recipe is simple to prepare and makes a big impact. I could not find lingonberry jam so I used the red currant that I already had. I agree that the dish should be served immediatly so I cut down the recipe and served it as I made each batch. I also di dnot use the olive oil. Thanks for the tip about flouring the foie gras - it really hold the cubes together. For many people this was their first time trying fois gras and this was actually eaten ad appreciated more than I thought it would be. And to those who don't agree with how foie gras is produced: 1) I empathize with your passion but this is not the venue for your greivance, 2)I would hope that you also give up eating anything that was alive if you are going to judge others so harshly, 3) you'll also give up leather, leather products. I can't presume to judge anyone else for what they eat or anyone else as i am not perfect, either.

would not recomend at all. quallity foie gras should be surved imediatly. also chicken livers are not a good substitute whatsoever. foie gras is fattened goose or duck liver. a huge difference

The Lingonberry was a fantastic combination with the Foie Gras. I had a little trouble with the Brioche, because it was so buttery already - it really didn't need any additional fat added. Next time I would not cook it in butter.

I would not recomend this recipe. foie gras should seared and served as soon as possible. Also since foie is 100% fat you do not need to ues oil or butter. use a dry pan get it hot and sear and serve.
