I used 1 cup sugar. 1/2 cup applesauce instead of butter and 1/2 cup peanut butter instead of peanuts, a tablespoon of water. Heated applesauce in microwave for two minutes. Spooned some chocolate pudding in the middle. Very yummy

They are fantastic. Easy to make, moist, and the perfect combo of salt and sweet.

Ho hum. Nothing special at all - average at best. Agree with a previous reviewer that these were quite sweet and spongey. Not the texture I expected at all (I wanted soft and chewy, what we got was dry and spongey). They sat on the counter for a week or so, with no one eating them, before being thrown out. The only redeeming quality was that these were easy. Having said that, I would not make them again.

I agree with those who point out that the blondies are cakey, but we're snowed in, so this hit the spot! I didn't have peanuts and couldn't get out to get some, so we made do with chocolate chips.

If you love peanut and chocolate, this is the perfect recipe! I love the salted roasted peanuts this recipe called for. Couldn't be any easier and was a great ending to our picnic.

Nothing special..tasted way too peanuty and not enough like blondies with the chocolate chips added. Very easy though...perfect for a school or charity bakesale.

Cut sugar to 1 C . Use up pecans (4 oz, or 1/2 C +) chopped coarsely. Use up chips (5 oz). Use glass 8x8 coated with Baker's Joy. Spread batter & top generously. Yummy!!!! I would cut the butter by 2T next time. This is so easy & quick!

A good basic blondie recipe. Nothing extraordinary.

Don't know if I did something wrong but mine were bizarrely spongey and too sweet.

Very nice texture and overall quite tasty. I'd try to find unsalted peanuts though, as they were a bit too salty for me.

Love these! They couldn't be easier and people at my work gobbled them up. I prefer pecans instead of peanuts in this recipe.

I doubled the recipe into a large rectangular pan. I would recommend baking a a lower temperature and using parchment on bottom like with regular brownie baking. It was enjoyed by all and I would make them again with the above recommendations. Brenda in Vancouver, BC

People at my office loved these brownies. It almost tastes as if they are peanut butter though. We topped them as suggested and they were great.
