I followed one reviewer's advice and cooked it in a cast iron dutch oven on top of my stove. I only have one oven. Since I was cooking for just us two, I halved the recipe, and used 3/4 cup of pecans. The pecans are fabulous. I plan to cook them as directed, and use them for appetizers at a dinner party. I also used a package of gourmet organic brown rices instead of the wild rice. Also chopped the onions instead of slicing. Delicious!

Dinner guests loved this! I read some of the reviews below, and based on comments, I used 2 c wild rice and 1/2 c brown rice, chopped the onions and the pepper rather than into julienne strips, and it came out beautifully. The addition of more yellow pepper and/or more pecans wouldn't hurt a bit...

I made this for Christmas Eve. It is a good recipe but not worth 4 forks in my opinion. I thought it lacked flavor. The nuts were a nice addition but it needs additional spice or maybe a more flavorful chicken broth. I used low sodium.

I cut the recipe in half, but otherwise followed the directions. It took 2 hours and 45 minutes to cook! I needed nearly 6 cups of liquid by the time it finished cooking. We had to eat it the next day, not with the meal it was supposed to be eaten with which ruined that first meal. It did taste good, but it was not worth the hassle and upset it caused.

I made this with the wild and brown rice blend from the bin at Sprouts supermarket. I only had to cook it 40 minutes for the broth to absorb, which was good because it was done only a little while after the pork coronets with sour cherry sauce (on this website). Great accompaniment to the pork and the leftovers heated nicely.

The pecans do really make this dish. My only problem was that there was still liquid in the rice when the rice was at the right degree of doneness. I didn't like having to strain it although it did come out all right in the end. Next time I will use less liquid...I can always add more if it appears too dry during cooking. The other change I would make is to take other reviewers advice and use part brown rice along with the wild rice. I might also add some wild mushrooms. One of the nice things about this dish is that it lends itself to adding most anything you like. With some changes, I will definitely make this again.

Got lots of compliments. Used vegetable broth and caramelized the onion. Wild rice was perfect texture. Amount of broth was fine for me.

Made this with half wild rice and half brown rice. Used green pepper because it's all I had on hand. This is a nice, standard side starch. This dish also gets better the next day..and the next..and the next!!

I made this recipe the day before to make life easier for me the day of the dinner party. I just reheated in the microwave. I served it with crab stuffed salmon, filet mignon, green beans and a greek salad. Great combo. For added color contrast I used Uncle Ben's wild and long grain rice minus Uncle Ben's seasoning packet. I also used a third each of red, yellow and orange bell peppers. The color was wonderful. I will be making this recipe again. I had eight adults for dinner and I was happy I made the entire recipe. Better more than not enough. I felt the cooking time and broth measurements were perfect.

Delicious recipe but it makes a lot. I tripled the recipe for a wedding of 25 people and had loads left over (double recipe would have been more than enough). We served it with grilled salmon and roasted asparagus for an easy but tasty dinner.

I love this dish! Have made it multiple times. My family likes it best adding sliced mushrooms and a little garlic sauted with the onions. I've also made the rice in a rice cooker ahead of time, then pop it all in the oven for 30 minutes to heat up. Great dish for a large crowd.

Delicious! Served w/ a porterhouse steak and made a half recipe, using 1 cup brown rice, 1 cup wild rice and 3 1/2 cups chicken broth. Used the full cup of toasted pecans. When I added the onions/peppers, also added 1/4 cup dried cranberries. YUM!! can't wait to make for guests - the half recipe would have served six.

This was a great side and I will make it again. I had to add two extra cups of water in addition to the 4.5 cups of broth. The pecans make this dish.

I have made this recipe a few times now and it is wonderful!!!It makes alot so I do cut the recipe in half (except the toasted pecans yum...) It does need more broth too. Everyone that I have made this recipe for has wanted it! This is a KEEPER!!!

I too used the Lundberg wild rice mix with delicious results. I halved the recipe but used the full amount of pecans...yum! I had to add extra broth a couple of times as it cooked. No other reviewer mentioned this but I thought the thin onion slices had an unappetizing texture. Next time I will chop the onion and probably the pepper too into more rice-sized pieces. Otherwise fantastic! Served with the pecan crusted trout from this site.

I've made this dish three times now...love it! Great flavor and beautiful on the plate. I especially love the crunch of the pecans. Sometimes use red and orange peppers as well for an even more beautiful presentation. Otherwise, I follow the recipe exactly and have never had any problems.

Absolutely wonderful dish, even with the changes I made to accommodate my vegan sister's diet. I used olive oil instead of butter, and vegetable broth instead of chicken stock. I brought this to my family's Thanksgiving dinner, and it was a huge hit. Very yummy!

I really liked this recipe...easy to just put in the oven and let it do its thing. I did the pecan thing early in the day and let it just sit on the counter. I also did the onion and pepper in a frying pan and just let that sit as well. To bring the mixture to a boil, I just put it in the oven on convection and it only took a few minutes, and then cooked on convection for 35 minutes and it was almost done, so turned to regular 350 on the oven added more liquid, and stirred in the pepper/onion mixture and added pecans when the rice came out. This is a keeper

Due to limited resources in the local (country) market, I had to modify this recipe a bit. I used brown rice, instead of wild, and used a garlic/herb salt free seasoning in place of the thyme for the pecans. I used a red onion, yellow pepper, and added a grated carrot and mushrooms sauteed in an olive oil/butter blend. I did have to add a little more chicken stock toward the end of the baking time to keep it moist. This was the most colorful-flavorful rice dish I've ever had. Hope to try it next time with a little wild rice added and about 3/4 cup more stock than recipe called for.

I had leftover wild rice, so carmelized the onion, then tossed the other ingredients in the skillet to heat them up. I did add more fresh thyme. Delicious with the seasoned pecans.

I actually made this the day before I served it, to go with my standing rib roast for Christmas Eve dinner (too many things in the oven). Very delicious and the nuts just gave made it so special. My guests raved. Enough for a small army, though.

I have been making this recipe for a year now (since last Thanksgiving). Like many pressed for time, I have developed a stovetop version. Yes, it tastes about the same. Bring 4 cups of water to boil to which 1 Tbsp of Chicken flavored "Better than Boullion" has been added. Saute rice in 1 Tbsp of "Colvita Pepperolio" olive oil then add to flavored water. Cover and cook on low 30 min. Add onion/pepper mixture and cook another 30 min. After about an hour check the rice for tenderness and begin reducing the remaining liquid with lid off so the rice is not soupy. Stir in pecan mixture and serve. Oven or Stovetop, this recipe is worth making again and again.

Pretty, flavorful. Used 1/3 wild rice, 1/3 brown, 1/3 white chinese rice. I also halved the recipe and still had a lot left over. Superb side dish. The toasted pecans are a must. Even better the next day.

Very good recipe. Recipe similar to another that epicurious has but uses toasted sliced almonds. Will make again. To the reviewer that put a PYREX glass dish on the stovetop & heated it - this a definite No No. I'm glad that nobody was hurt in your feeble attempts to make this dish. But PYREX dishes are to heat food items in environments that aren't in constant flux. These types of environments do not include stovetop heating. Be a savy consumer and read the instructions that come with your cookware/equipment and your recipes will turn out each and every time.

Not sure how this recipe turns out. Used a Pyrex casserole dish on the stove with moderately low heat as directed. When I added the wild rice the casserole dish exploded - glass and wild rice all over the kitchen. Fortunately no one was hurt. Guess pyrex isn't flameproof. Disappointed to lose the wild rice as it was a gift from a friend on the Leech Lake reservation in Northern Minnesota. Also quite a mess to clean up with company on the way.

This was absolutely a lovely dish. Having lived in Minnesota I am very familiar with wild rice. This dish was so good paired with pecans. It was easy to make and very flavorful. I think next time It might be nice to try to cut the wild rice down my 1/2 cup and add 1/2 cup of white rice to the recipe for some color. I am excited to make this again as it is delish! Makes me even more homesick for Minnesota than I already am!

I felt like this recipe took a long time to make, but the results were delicious. I served this as a side to the Pecan-Crusted Trout with Orange Rosemary Butter recipe from this site. The pecans tied it all together! Yum!

This is such a fabulous side dish! I served with a roasted tenderloin with port gravy for Christmas and everyone raved. It looked a little humble, I have to admit but this dish just sings. I gave it three instead of four forks because "a dish beyond compare" is a very tall order. I will make this again & again.

Served this to 10 guests and have tons of leftovers. Added more pecans and also used 1 cup wild rice and 1 1/2 c brown Lundberg rices. Delish. Everyone wants the recipe. Served it with B.A.'s Coq Au Vin Classic recipe. Excellent together.

Having made this twice now (first time with questionable results), I'd highly recommend adding about 2 tsp of thyme to the rice as it cooks and double up on the nut mixture - gives it more flavor.

Rating: 3
I made a couple of changes--I used porcini mushrooms instead of the yellow pepper, and veal instead of chicken stock, as I was serving it with roasted veal. The pecans are a great addition, and fabulous on their own. However, I found the pilaf to be a bit dry. There were tons of leftovers from a dinner for 5, and I plan to add creamed morels to it tomorrow.

My first experiment with Lundberg Wild Blend gourmet wild & brown rices. So many flavors and textures in this dish but absolutely delicious. I didn't have enough chix stock so I substituted 1 1/2 cups of white wine. Next time I'll plan ahead! Will also probably use 2 yellow peppers, more FRESH thyme and double the amount sauteed shallots. Makes enough for a small army.

This recipe has a wonderful combination of color, texture and flavor. I made the wild rice in a rice cooker yesterday a little light on liquid and simply placed it in a casserole today, added sauteed onions and 1 can of low-salt chicken broth. Baked it at 375 F for 30 minutes covered, stirred it, returned to oven for another 15 minutes. I stirred in the pecans just before serving. If I wasn't feeding the macho men, it would have been sufficient on its own. Pecans make the dish!

This dish was fantastic! It had a wonderful earthy flavor and will be a staple from now on any time I make roasted turkey or chicken and I'll definately try it with a pork tenderloin in the near future. One note: it did take the entire alloted time to bake, but it was well worth it!

My husband thought he didn't like wild rice until he tried this, and now it's one of his favorite dishes. This is a very easy recipe to prepare and it has become a staple in our house. It's nice to imagine that it's quite healthy, too.

This dish was fantastic - I used a blend of many different rices and it turned out great. I needed to keep it warm due to a chicken dish that was not ready - and I don't think it hurt the dish at all.

Used combination of wild and brown rice (3 cups in total) and cooked it with the chicken broth in a rice cooker and then added the rice to the sauteed vegetables and nuts a few minuted before serving. Tasted great and using a rice cooker is a lot less hassle. Got rave reviews and will definitely make again.

This made an excellent side dish for maple glazed pork tenderloin. It benefits by about 10-15 minute extra baking time. It would easily feed 10 people and reheats very well.

I love this recipe! The first time I made it it seemed too oily to me so now I use my non-stick, oven proof skillet and use only a fraction of the oil. It is still delicious and always gets rave reviews. The toasted pecans are such a wonderful touch that I've found myself trying them in other dishes, too.

I made this on Easter Sunday - superb! I, too, used half wild rice & half brown rice. My children don't care for red pepper, so I grated some carrot in for color. This is truly delicious! I may add dried cranberries next time for more contrast.

The olive oil I had on hand was too fruity I think. The taste of the olive oil was too overpowering for the dish and didn't blend that well with the nuttiness of the rice. I will give this another try using butter. The pecans are a great addition. I used a wild and brown rice mixture.

This is fabulous. I was raised in Minnesota (Wild Rice Country) but had never had wild rice and pecans together. It's a very rich dish. I substituted brown rice for about a third of the rice to vary the consistency and it was delicious. I think it goes best with lighter fare (chicken or fish versus beef or lamb) since it's so rich.

This dish was excellent. Be warned that it takes a while to cook, but the results are well worth it. Especially the nuts. What a touch. And what a scent to have lingering in your kitchen. I've served the rice stuffed in trout, and I have been commanded to make the dish again soon.

This delicious side dish was the perfect addition to our Thanksgiving meal -- it was a substitute for our usual wild rice stuffing, and provided the perfect autumnal touch. It was a big hit with the guests and we'll definitely make it again before next Thanksgiving.
