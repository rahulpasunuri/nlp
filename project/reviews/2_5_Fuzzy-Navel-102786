Am sipping this while writing and I've realized I haven't had one of these since, like 1973. If you're in the mood for a retro SWEET cocktail, this should fit the bill.

You're supposed to make this drink in a highball glass? Nothing with the word "ball" should be associated with this drink if you know what I mean. You forgot to add "to be drank with pinky finger extended" to the recipe.
