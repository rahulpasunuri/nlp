Very delicious! I didn't think the asian vibe would pair with my entree so I used a white onion and omitted the ginger. Came out great!

Very good and beautiful too. I was able to use only one tablespoon olive oil with excellent results. I soak the rice overnight and use a traditional Thai steamer - the rice comes out exceptionally tender and delicious. Might consider a splash of lime next time.

This is simple and delicious. Made exactly as is and wouldn't change a thing. Very light and flavorful.

Made exactly as written (cooked rice 5 min longer) and it was yum! Loved the ginger, sweet potatoe, scallion combo. I will do it again with any rice i have on hand (i'm saving the black rice for black rice pudding!).

Wow. This dish was a revelation for me about sweet potatoes. I have been hunting for recipes to help me love them, and this is the best one yet. The black rice has amazing flavor and texture which is fabulous with the flavors of the green onions and ginger. Scrumptious, easy, and quick!

This was quite tasty...but I agree with the prior reviewer about steaming the rice, a whole grain, longer than 30 mins. I did not think about this when I made it and when I mixed the rice with the vegetables there was a lot of liquid left in the pot and the rice was still a little chewy! Fortunately my sweet potatoes were still a little firm, so I ended up putting a lid on the whole thing and steaming it on low for another 10 mins which did the trick, but unfortunately turned all the vegetables purple. Fortunately I add some other green and orange stuff on the plate, and I don't think the taste was hurt at all. Super healthy which is a bonus!

Very flavorfull. I too used the Forbidden Rice from Louts Foods.I used an All-Clad copper pot, lined with stainless steel and it really took some effort to get the black out! The taste was great. The combination of scallions, sweet potatoes and ginger really made the dish. I give it a 3+ forks!

In an attempt to come back down to earth after the holiday fat-fest, I've been cooking simpler foods, which can be pretty dull. This side dish provided an interesting and somewhat exotic companion for a skinless boneless chicken breast in teriyaki sauce. The contrast of the rice grains and sweet potato cubes and the spark added by the ginger and green onions made the meal a hit. My husband loved it. It was healthful, easy to put together, and attractive. We'll have it again and serve it to company.

Easy, satisfying as a main dish or could be a fancy side. Rinse the rice well, and cook it as long as it takes, which may be closer to 45 minutes. A bit of good soy sauce to finish really brought out the flavors.

We made this recipe on New Year's Eve for a group dinner. We quadrupled it and cooked the rice in a rice cooker, the veggies in an electric fry pan,so we could combine the rice and sweet potatoes and keep it warm easily. It was delicious and went well with the veal chops prepared by the host family. When you buy the black rice, look for "Forbidden Rice" by Lotus Foods. I bought it at Whole Foods. Don't get black sticky rice, which is used for sweet desserts. Happy New Year!
