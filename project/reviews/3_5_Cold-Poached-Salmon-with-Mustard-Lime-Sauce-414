I was serving a rather ambitious 4 course dinner, and I was looking for a good "make-ahead" dish. This was spectacular! Raves all around a table with some pretty sophisticated diners. I made exactly by the book, but added beet juice to the poaching liquid as one reviewer suggested to improve the color of the fish. I also substituted Peruvian steelhead trout, which is my goto fish whenever I make a salmon recipe. More fatty and flavorful than any salmon I have ever tasted.

Overall, very good. Made a couple of changes. Added 2 cloves minced garlic to the salmon. Changed the sauce as well. Like others, reduced the mustard 1-1/2 - 2 tbsp, changed the honey to a good quality maple syrup and used Dill instead of basil. Always a huge hit and we serve it with many other types of cold salmon.

Haven't made this recipe exactly, so won't rate it, but in answer to the question about presentation...cook a few beets in the poaching liquid. Doesn't change the flavour, but turns the salmon a fabulous colour. (Picked up that tip from one of Jamie Oliver's amazing cookbooks.)

The sauce was a huge hit. The lime made it very frush and the mustard gave it a nice kick. I chose to grill the salmon with a citrus rub, then refrigerated over night. Very good summer meal. I've been asked for the sauce recipe several times.

The sauce makes the dish - quite frankly the poaching liquid adds little to no flavor. The salmon, cooked as written, comes out pink. Not sexy but, well, salmon colored. Maybe a sprinkle of paprika on top or toss the fish under the broiler for 15 seconds to darken it a little (although that might dry it out). I think it is fine as written.

I did not rate this recipe because I misread the measurements and used two tablespoons (6 teaspoons) of lime juice. My suggestion is to be very careful about adding additional lime juice as suggested by some reviewers. I found 6 teaspoons way too much. It simply overpowered the other ingredients. I went back and checked the recipe and discovered my mistake so I added the full 6 tablespoons of Dijon and additional honey. I still couldn't dilute the strong lime taste. Guest didn't complain but I will try again with the correct amount of lime juice.

This sauce is absolutely amazing. I did follow other reviewers' suggestions of reducing the mustard (I used only 2 TB), and think that's a very smart move. I wanted to eat the sauce straight, without the salmon! Question: Does anybody know how to make poached salmon look more appetizing? It looks prettier once you put the sauce and basil on, of course, but the surface of the fish just looks so pasty and pale and fleshy and kind of blah and dry and unappetizing. I don't want to cover the entire surface of the fish with the sauce, since it really looks so much nicer with just a strip of sauce. Seems like one could cover the whole surface with a glaze instead of with this sauce to make it look better, but this lime sauce recipe is so good I don't want to substitute some other condiment. Bottom line, tastes great, but needs a cosmetic makeover somehow. I could be wrong, but I doubt the appearance would be dramatically improved simply by using a different variety or source of salmon, if available (wild vs. farmed, Atlantic vs. Pacific). Any ideas?

I have served this entre many times - the sauce makes the salmon and tastes best when made the day before and thoroughly chilled.

I used less mustard than the recipe calls for and substituted dill for basil. Delicious!

I really liked this - it was simple to prepare and very tasty, especially the sauce. Leftovers make a good salmon salad the next day.

This is one of my favorite recipes ever. Of course, you have to like salmon, since the cooking and the sauce appropriately enhance its flavor; they don't cover it. Cooking times vary according to thickness, but I find this recipe works well for 1 or 1 1/2 inch fish. One change: do not bring to a boil again at the end; just turn on the heat and cook for about a minute more. Also, feel free to substitute plain yogurt to make the sauce healthier.

The salmom needed just a little more time in the poaching liquid. I made a remoulade sauce the was a good accompanyment.

I poached the salmon in a fumet in order to give the flesh more flavorful. As for the sauce, I used plain yogurt, added just half the mustard, improvised on the honey, and basically tasted as I went along. I thought it was quite tasty but didn't like it as much as some of my guests did.

I would not make this dish again. No matter how I doctored it, it was barely edible. In order to get this recipe to a much better standard one would have to use/add different ingredients and then it really wouldn't be this recipe. Not a winner this one. Nope.

Very delicious and very easy - the whole thing can be made in about 20 minutes. Do be very careful adding the mustard. I used Trader Joe's brand dijon and ended up using slightly less than 1 tbsp. The best salmon recipe I have ever eaten.

The poaching method here was perfect. My salmon was incredibly tender. But I wasn't too thrilled with the sauce. I cut way back on the mustard thanks to previous reviews, and would advise others to do the same. But for me the lime/sour cream/honey thing just wasn't all that exciting. It was very easy though.

Rating: 2
Could not understand the great reviews for this recipe; I halved the amount of mustard, and still it was too much. (Maybe the brand of Dijon that I used? Trader Joes is very strong, but even then...) My roommate said that the sauce tasted like Wasabi, and she was right on the dot. This dish really cleared the nostrils, but was hardly edible.

This has become my standard Mother's Day brunch buffet recipe. Easy to do the day before, and everyone loves it.

I first tasted this dish when a friend brought it to a picnic. After getting the recipe off of her, I tried it myself but used more lime juice and honey for the sauce and it came out slightly stronger in flavor making it extra delicious. I also lessened the time of poaching the salmon as we like our salmon pink in the middle. Absolutely divine!

EXCELLENT salmon recipe. Great for a buffet. Can be prepared the night before and kept chilled. Everyone loved it.

My guests raved. I agreed with all the other reviews on reducing the mustard. I increased the lime too. Very, very easy. I would make this all the time. The left over sauce was great as a salad dressing the next day. I just added some good vinegar.

The sauce was wonderful and can be served with cut up vegetables and meat as well.

This is the all time easiest way to poach salmon! I've made this recipe several times (reducing the mustard by 1/2) and I've used this poaching technique for other salmon recipes.

I substituted orange juice for the poaching water for extra flavor. But I really think the most important thing is how much flavor your salmon starts out with - Pacific salmon can be so much better than Atlantic salmon. Also, one of my guests was lactose intolerant so I used yogurt instead of sour cream and that worked well, though I didn't even THINK about using that much mustard! And finally, if you want a truly delicious and beautiful sauce, add a whole load of chopped herbs (I used dill and parsley.) NOW you're talkin'.

A very nice way to poach salmon, and the sauce is lovely. However, sometimes I wonder if there aren't typos in some of the recipes. 6 TABLESPOONS of Dijon mustard? Only if you love it more than your kids. I halved the mustard,doubled the lime, and used just a tablespoon of honey. Also, salmon is so rich on its own, light sour cream seemed more than enough.

I made this for mother's day brunch. It was a hit!

I used plain salmon from a large national chain, didn't even get around to it for a couple of days, and it STILL turned out great, that night and the next day for lunch at work. It would be difficult to find much easier, and I will be playing around with different sauces throughout the summer. Can't recommend it enough!

Made this for a dinner club, it was excellent. The sauce was not too heavy. Of course, it will be as good as the freshness of the salmon, but we lucked out and the salmon was delicious.

Made this last night but served the salmon warm and heated up the sauce for 45 seconds in the microwave. Still delicious and remarkably quick and easy. Only 2 tablespoons of mustard was enough for me, however.

Incredible sauce. Used half the mustard. Very easy preparation.

Easy and tasty, but I would tone down the mustard. It tends to overpower the delicate flavor of the salmon.

This was easy and delicious, although I think I should have cooked mine a little longer, since my fillets were rather thick. This was perfect for a hot night, and the sauce was sublime.

This is a perfect summer dish. I used tofu sour cream and the sauce didn't seem to suffer at all - I'll definitely make it again.

I've never enjoyed salmon very much; I eat it because my cardiologist told me to. But with this recipe, I've made salmon that is for the gods. I think maybe salmon is too delicate to be spoiled by all the herbs I've been told to add. In this recipe, I have used French vermouth for the white wine and country-style dijon mustard (the golden flecks look appetizing in the sauce). I have served it with pencil-thin asparagus vinaigrette over watercress and rice pudding for dessert. I've made this for company several times and gotten accolades every time. I always make enough so that I can have some the next day to savor it alone. Thanks.

I made this for a concert picnic, and my date raved about it. I used light sour cream for the sauce, and it came out just fine. I think I might try cutting back a little on the mustard next time. Otherwise, wonderful!

Try this dish. The tangy sauce is so quick and simple, and it goes well with salmon. I've served it both for family and at dinner parties.
