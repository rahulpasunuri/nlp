This dish was fabulous. I made some small changes: celeriac mashed potatoes with mace instead of the flans (no oven), wine instead of stock in endive, salmon for the fish. Great combo of flavors. Don't skip any of the parts! This will be xmas eve dinner this year....

I needed a simple recipe for the family (including 7-yr-olds) so I just made the garlic nage and served it over the turbot. Relatively easy and tastes good.
