Very nice and the salsa could most certainly be used over other meats/fishes. Although I'd add another pepper since mine didn't come out terribly spicy.

I liked this a lot, more than I thought since i don't normally incorporate oranges into my main dishes or in my salsa. I agree that this would be a wonderful salsa over halibut, and i will definitely try that next time!

The salsa in this recipe is superb. It tastes very refreshing and flavorful. My gripe with this recipe is the fact that I don't think that the salsa compliments the chicken very well. I think that this salsa would be excellent with mahi mahi or another fish, but the the combination with chicken did not suit my palate.

LOVED this dish! Wouldn't change a thing! Will definitely keep this one in my recipe box.

This dish was a hit for a large dinner party I gave. I cut the chicken breasts in half before tenderizing them a night ahead, and kept them in a zip lock bag with some lime juice. I loved the clementines but found them too small to get enough juice for a big batch. I also used the juice of a bunch of blood oranges, since they're also sweet and in season at the time. The reduced sauce results in a beautiful red color that was delicious.

I made this with local California halibut which was the same thickness as the paillards. My husband went crazy on this recipe and he was ladling the salsa on everything on his plate. I couldn't use the clementine juice because mine didn't make enough so gasp! I used 3 Tablespoons of frozen orange juice concentrate that I've had in the freezer FOREVER so I can only imagine next time when I buy more clementines. Delicious

Easy, bright recipe. The basil was such a pleasant, unexpected addition to the salsa. I de-seeded red chili peppers which added a nice kick and generously peppered the salsa and chicken. The sauce should be doubled but solidifies the flavors. Boyfriend loved this dish!

A tad bit bland for my taste buds. The chicken is a bit bland prepared without much seasoning. I think it would taste better if the chicken stewed with the salsa maybe.

This is an unusual dish that is very fresh and tasty. The citrus and serrano chili really are tastebud delighters. Make sure to pound the chicken really thin. And, double the sauce...I didn't and I served this buffet style and the first person took half the sauce!

This was a very nice recipe. We couldn't find serrano chiles so we used one jalapano and it wasn't hot enough. We also didn't use basil (couldn't find it) and substituted extra cilantro. A nice and easy recipe that was very fresh tasting. The salsa would be a really good dip with diced avacados added.

This was a fun dish to make and a delightful presentation. It just seemed to lack something. I might try it again but add some fish sauce.

Interesting mix of flavors. Will definitely make again

Easy dish, but I am really not a fan of it. In general, I don't love fruit and meat, so it has to be exactly right for me to love it. My husband really liked it.

Delicious salsa. I love the herbs and sweet fruit. Once you make the salsa, it is the perfect and fast no-starch weeknight dinner for after the gym.

I found the salsa a bit labor intensive but well worth the effort. I will make again with less oil while I am Sauteing the chicken. Home run for my family! I will serve with some kind of black beans next time.

This is an absolute winner. My husband and kids loved the citrus flavor. I served with a flash sauteed spinach and it was delish! Be prepared, it does have a bit of a kick (but then again, who couldn't use one now and again?). This will go in my permanent file and is very doable on a weeknight.

I loved this recipe! It was fresh and a good change from the root vegetable rut that we get in in the winter months. I used navel oranges and juice out of the fridge, and my local grocery stores didn't have fresh basil so I just didn't add it. Still fantastic though. The best part however are the leftovers. I warmed one breast with the salsa on top in the micro and it is even better with warm salsa! I will surely make this again and will probably let the chicken and salsa stew together in a pan for a moment before serving to warm up the salsa.

It was a wonderful meal and it looked like the photo! I will make it again!

What a great looking and tasting dinner! Everyone enjoyed it, was asked to make it twice in one week.I am not a big cilantro fan so I used fresh basil and parsley. Refreshing in the winter but will be a great summer dish as well.

So easy, fresh and healthy! My husband and I just loved this dish. We have tons of clementines on our tree and this was a great way to make use of them. The leftovers the next day were just as good as the night before.

This is really an excellent dish. It is important to make sure that the chicken breasts are as thin as recommended. I added some zest from the clementines to the sauce and it worked out well. Yes, I will make this one again.

This was amazingly delicious and incredibly easy to make. I went to a party and made the salsa to put with chips and people went nuts.

Excellent - both of my teenagers loved this flavorful but light chicken dish. Just used orange juice from fridge instead of squeezing clementines with no impact on recipe

Very nice bright flavors with the chicken--especially for a winter dish.

Very colorful, and pleasing to the eye. Tastes delicious! Even the picky eaters loved it. Who knew something so healthy could taste so good!

I too made this without basil (I doubled the cilantro), celery and chile as I didn't have them in the house. The recipe was very nice and next time I will add the serrano chile for more of a kick.

Easy and surprisingly good. I followed the recipe exactly. Good use for extra clementines!

I tried this recipe with my boyfriend. As he is not a big fan of celery we omitted the celery. We also omitted the basil because it wasn't looking great in the stores so we doubled the cilantro. Other than that, followed the recipe and it was fantastic. We will definitely be making this again. Great use of clementines. Healthy too.

Delicious salsa - great make-ahead dish. The salsa would also be good with fish or pork.

This dish was excellent. Easy, fast but with a depth of flavor not often achieved in such a quick meal. I might even add another serrano chili to the salsa. Definitely will make again.

This had great flavor! I'm not a huge fruit w/savory type of person but the salsa was pretty impressive and it really made the dish. Plus it was an easy weeknight dinner that could easily be a dinner party main dish.
