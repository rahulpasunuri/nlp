I used a 2 lb boneless pork loin roast thinking it would cook faster - but it didn't (and that was even after having brought it to room temp an hour before searing). The pork still took over an hour to reach 145 degrees. I thought all the little steps (soaking the figs in wine, sauteeing the veggies, etc) would lead to a good meal. But, after having spent 2 1/2 hours of my time on this,the result was merely mediocre.

Delicious!!!! I was a little more generous in the sauce quantities and do not regret it. I served the roast with white rice and we doused the rice with sauce. We used a rustic baguette to mop up what was left on the plate.

this was fantastic.. I will definitely make this again. the balance of the sweet fig and the mustard = amazing.. it was easy to make and worth the wait!

This is the recipe that kicked off our supper club of 4 couples started in 2004. It is always requested as a repeat performance (even if the unspoken rule is no repeats) so I making it again after 7 years!

Delicious! I used a pork rib roast and substituted dried apricots in place of the dried figs (I had a bunch on hand) and dried rosemary for fresh. It was a big hit and I'll definitely make it again.

this recipe is crazy-good. the pork comes out so tender, it falls off the bone. and the sauce is heavenly. I'll make this time and time again.

I made this with a beef shoulder roast in my crackpot from the step where you combine the pork and saute ingredients. I used horseradish and cornmeal for the sauce instead of mustard and flour and butter because I can't do dairy or gluten. It turned out great! A really wonder, slightly different pot-roast for passover seder.

Have made this 3-4 times per year since the recipe was first published in 2004. It always get raves from my guests and often a 'it's the best pork roast I have ever had' from many. Be sure to brown well... while cooking in the broth keeps the meat tender, without adequate browning it will be bland. Otherwise, enjoy!

I really like this recipe - have made it several times with boneless pork roast to good success. This is a go-to fall recipe for me - and like someone below I serve it with mashed sweet potatoes. Great!

This dish was very bland and overly mustard-y. The pork (I used a 6 pound pork blade roast) was very tender but the sauce seemed "off". I followed the recipe to a T so I am not sure why this was....

Fantastic recipe. Looks beautiful on a platter. This has been our Christmas dinner for the past several years, and we recently served it to guests at a dinner party to rave reviews. We use a crown roast cut, but we ask the butcher not to tie it -- works perfectly. This is simple to prepare, and the leftovers are delicious.

I loved this - made it with a center cut loin to make it a little healthier - served with mashed sweet potatoes - everyone loved it!

Excellent Recipe, Had a regular pork roast, stayed very moist. Used dried rosemary. Oven at 450 for 15 minutes, 300 for rest, 80 minutes. Figs were a real treat, and the sauce was very tastey, drizzled all over the pan-seared green beans, roast pork, and mashed potatoes. Definitely good for entertaining, but also comes under the comfort food category!

After already starting recipe, I realized my pork shoulder was too ripe to serve to guests and substituted country style-cut ribs. It still earned rave reviews. Wine-soaked figs were beautiful.

Wow, this is really good. Here's what I did to make it even better: first of all, double the sauce recipe. You won't be sorry especially if serving with stuffing or rice. Second, use more carrots and can use even more figs. What a wonderful combination, figs and pork. Third, the "Joy of Cooking" instructions for this kind of roast say to preheat the oven to 450 and bake your roast at that temperature for the first 15 minutes, then decrease the temperature to 250 for 80 to 90 more minutes. So I did almost that - I put the roast in at 450 degrees and after 15 minutes I opened the oven door, vented the oven temperature down to 300 (not 250), then baked it for 80 more minutes and it turned out perfectly. The internal temp. was 165 which I felt more comfortable with - and the roast was tender as all get out. Oh yes, best to season the roast the night before with salt, pepper, rosemary, garlic - let it marinate overnight - enjoy!

Tasty and tender. Used a smaller piece of meat, but took longer to cook. Used less mustard too.

Best pork roast I have ever had. Very tender, melts in your mouth. Took longer than 1 1/2 hours at 300 degrees.
