We skipped the butter but added homemade mayo. We grated all the ingredients, plus a carrot, mixed with the curry mayo then grilled. quick and easy!

Easy and delicious. To cut down on fat and calories, I used half the amount of butter (but the full amount of curry powder) and half the amount of cheese (very thinly sliced so it covers the toasts).

It's definately interesting, and good, but the heavieness of the cheese in addition to the butter wasn't weighed out by the other ingredients for me. (as a note, i didnt have watercress, but added extra apple to make up for it). I could see cutting it into smaller pieces after cooking and serving at a party.

Unusual, easy, and delicious. The curry butter makes the sandwich. Give this a try some night when you're too tired to cook dinner but can't face another round of takeout.

Easy and beyond delicious! I could eat these everyday. It's a nice balance of sweet and savory. The madras curry is perfect and a definite must for this recipe! I too used orange cheddar and it was very good.

I thought this one was a little boring. It was definitely quick but I dont think I will make it again.

To me, this was just ordinary. It's just a slight variation of a toasted cheese sandwich. It just didn't do that much for me.

Didn't have white cheddar, so I used regular orange cheddar. Also didn't use watercress. Soooo good, super fast! It has such a nice flavor I really like the sweetness. Will definetely be making again

Couldn't find watercress so skipped it. This is GOOD but makes a very filling lunch.

I worked late and I was tired, but I didn't feel like eating out. So I checked your website before leaving work, stopped at the supermarket, and a half hour later we enjoyed these delicious sandwiches with a salad. The reward/effort ratio is outstanding.

Ahh, the art of simplicity. Scored a "When are you making that apple-cheese sandwich again?" comment from my discerning girlfriend - high praise indeed!
