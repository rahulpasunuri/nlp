Thanks to earlier reviews, we doubled the balsamic vinegar and fresh rosemary and increased the shallots to 1/2 a cup. We have used both rib eye steaks and strip steaks,both of which worked well. We cooked the steaks 3 minutes to a side for rare. So easy and so delicious!

pretty good. used red onion in place of shallots.

I made this recipe using the recommendations of earlier reviewers, adding a splash of red wine and a bit of sugar to the sauce and picked fresh arugula to go under the finished steak. Even without the rosemary, it was delicious! Definitely will make this again.

This was disappointing. I used a good balsamic, but the sauce was just too vinegary & harsh. I think sugar would help, along with a splash of red wine as others suggested - but why bother? There are too many other excellent recipes out there to waste time trying to fix one that missed the mark.

I'm with New Orleans... it was too sweet and masked the meat. If you are going to eat steak, it should be ribeye and you should mainline it.

Yum! This was spectacularly good, even with basic sirloin tip. I added a splash of red wine (but no sugar), and the flavor was just right. Thanks to the person who suggested adding arugula, which combined perfectly with the steak and sauce. I made this with sauteed broccolini, which was a little too much green alongside the arugula; next time I'll add some sauteed baby bella mushrooms. And if you're going to add some starch, make sure to increase the amount of sauce.

I have been making this for two years now, it's my husband favorite. I love it too and Im not much of a steak person. Great marinade.

Thanks to earlier reviews, we did double the balsamic vinegar and fresh rosemary and increased the shallot to 1/2 cup. We used skirt steaks which we cooked 3 minutes per side, but would try other cuts of beef as well. So easy and so delicious!

Unbelievable!!! I used an aged vinegar and added the previously suggested wine and sugar. Then, passed it through a strainer. Definite go to recipe. Finger licking good!!!

My husband thought this was outstanding but it was a bit sweet for me. I like balsamic vinegar and shallots, but I'm not sure I like them on my steak!

I would have to agree with some of the other reviewers about the quantity - doubling it, especially the vinegar, makes it a more realistic serving. But otherwise very good and very easy.

added a little sugar and red wine to enrich the flavor and bring the sourness or tartness of the balsalmic vinegar down a notch. It was fantastic. I also put the steaks on top of some fresh arugula...a tip I got from a local restaurant. The flavors go VERY well together. I also sauteed whole baby bella mushrooms and poured it all on top of the steak. It is delicious and adds lots of substance. My boyfriend loved it. Definitely a fine dish.

I was not crazy about this - my husband liked it quite a bit.

this was a huge success! didn't have them, so i skipped the shallots and rosemary, and ended up using a bit less oil than called for. after mixing in the balsamic i added back collected juices from the resting steak. over polenta with roasted tomatoes and spinach...yum!

This was a wonderfully easy dish. We deglazed the pan with red wine, used more balsamic, added more rosemary and used a cut of meat called 'chuck eye'...ask your butcher about it. It is inexpensive and wonderful. We had this with the blue cheese gratin potatoes from this site. Yum!

I added sauteed mushrooms and a bit of red wine to the glaze. I made the glaze ahead of time, as others suggested, then added it to the pan I sauteed the steak in, so the glaze would soak up that extra flavor. I had to use dried rosemary but I'll bet fresh would have been better. Husband raved. It's easy and it smells great.

The glaze detracted the flavor of the the beef. The balsamic vinegar in particular was too overwhelming.

I make this all the time. Its simple but elegant in taste. Occasionally I will also throw in some mushrooms and saute with the shallots.

This was quite good. The balsamic glaze was fab and Im a stickler for a good sauce. A great easy stand by sauce for those times when you just want a nice quick sauce for your RibEye

This was not a hit at our house so it won't be on the menu again.

This was a wonderful meal! Served them with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed asparagus. I agree, make the sauce first (or while the steaks are cooking if broiling, like I did)-- the drippings weren't even enough to make a difference had I waited.

I thought this was really good. My husband is the kind of guy who doesn't like to mess w/ his rib eyes too much, but he really enjoyed the pepper coating and in the end, poured some of the sauce on his plate and wound up dipping every bite in:) It was a success.

I agree that this was a very easy dish to make, although I found the vinegar to be a little overpowering. I added sliced shiitakes, 1 whole sliced onion & doubled the glaze. But, an important change here (for ME at least): I made the glaze 1st, then set it aside. I think it's a mistake to let steaks "sit", especially after they've been cooked to perfection.

My family and I made this last night and I have to say I think this is the best steak dinner I have ever had. I doubled the glaze, adding fresh mushrooms with the shallots, and the result could not have been better. We actually only used 1 tsp. of olive oil because the steaks were not particularly lean. We served with baked potato and salad for a wonderful meal. My only regret: I wish I had waited until Valentine's Day to prepare this elegant meal!

Easy and fabulous. I even substituted diced red onion for the shallots once in a pinch, and it still turned out great.

This was very tasty. My husband loved it. Really, this review was just for the balsamic glaze (which really should be doubled as advised by others). The recipe would probably be awesome with filet mignon, which is what I will use next time. But this is one is definitely a keeper. I even took another reader's suggestion and added a dollop of bleu-cheese butter (mixed the two together). Very tasty. Tastes like something from a gourmet restaurant! :)

So, so, easy & very tasty too. Can't beat it for how easy it is. I doubled the sauce and would strongly recommend others to do so. The only addition I may make next time is perhaps a dollop of blue cheese butter on top! I served them with Epicurious' roquefort twice baked potatoes.

This recipe was awesome. So easy to make, so quick and the smell of the rosemary really topped it off. I added more rosemary than required and it was great!

With the shallots I added thinly sliced mushrooms. Nothing could have made this dish any better. I served with mashed potatoes and not a drop of anything was left. Would definately be making again.

the key to this dish is a good quality balsamic vinegar. made it three times. first two with a good balsamic. third time could only get a cheaper vinegar, had to add a little sugar at the end. great dish! be sure to make extra sauce

This was an excellent way to serve steak other than the grill. It was a nice change and was soooo easy to make.

For the effort involved, this is an amazing recipe! My only change would be to at least 1 1/2 the sauce -- it's very tasty!

A dream recipe -- easy to make and delicious. We had some Shitake mushrooms on hand so sauteed them and added them to the glaze at the last minute. Very good. I love the rating system -- this is a recipe I would have passed up except for the enthusiastic reviews it received from others.

I made this for a special supper for my husband and I. It was very fragrant and the balsamic vinegar glaze set off the steak just right.

EXCELLENT STEAK RECIPE. THE SAUCE ENHANCES THE FLAVOR OF THE MEAT AND MAKES IT A 4 FORKER.

Much better than I expected it to be. It's quick and easy, but looks beautiful on the plate.
