These were good, and definitely a condiment (not meant to be eaten alone). I made to go with the black beans, as well as a spiced pork tenderloin.

The onions were much too sour. Lime just didn't work at all. But if using you need to add some sugar to balance the lime. Also, mine faded and lost the rosy color pictured in the magazine food styling shot. 10 minute soak is too long. We much prefer red wine vinegar. We did like the chiles though.

I made this as a side dish for Thanksgiving and it was absolutely delicious. One note of caution though, I forgot to wear gloves when prepping the habanero chili and my fingers were burning for days! I had to call poison control and they advised me put benadryl cream on my hands. This dish is worth it just be careful!

I made this as a condiment for a party, and got rave reviews! So easy. I used fresh lime juice, but OJ from Tropicana, since it's what I had on hand. I used a serrano pepper so there was flavor without the "heat" for the tenderfeet at my party. I'm in Texas, after all, but we had Yankees in attendance ;-)
