Made this for a dinner party last night and it was a hit! Couldn't get baby beets- used large golden beets and then cut into 1-2 inch pieces. We like beets and this is one of the best recipes we've found. Yum!

Colorful and delicious. I may make this for Christmas Day dinner. For those new to roasting their own beets you should use gloves when peeling and cutting the beets so your hands aren't red for a few days. Also you can do this with larger beets you just need to double the roasting time.

I would probably rate this 3 and a half stars if given the chance. I made these for a Xmas dinner and the colors were lovely. Green Beens can be boring, but the addition of the roasted beets to this dish really elevates it. I could not find baby beets, so I used small regular-sized beets and it came out really good.

My baby beets were bigger than a large marble; they were more like a fingerling potato. But oh my, this was a yummy dish! The beets soaked up the lemony butter and took on a glazed quality. They were delicious! Sweet and lemony-tart and a little salty all at once. I think I undercooked my beans a tad and they were tasty, but I might make the dish w/out them next time and double or triple the beets. The leftovers were really good right out of the fridge.

Very good recipe, with a nice combination of earthy and tangy flavors. I made it with fresh haricots verts and beets from our garden -- I was a proud papa!

This was QUITE good. I'd just gotten a bag of baby beets from the farmer's market and had some green beans left over, so I used about 2 to 1 beets to beans. I also halved the butter as I always do with Epicurious recipes, and roasted the green beans as well instead of blanching them. The tang of the lemon went so well with the sweet of the beets and I would have never thought to combine these two veggies. As another reviewer said, Yum.

the beans got a little droopy, which is why i only gave it 3 forks. other than that -- delicious and easy! i was surprised how many people at seder ended up loving the beets. i parboiled the beets in the microwave to decrease the roasting time, and it worked perfectly, since i couldn't find baby beets. it also looked beautiful on the platter.

Wonderful flavor. I didn't add the parsley and added a little more lemon juice. What a wonderful way to get your veggies.

Another unreviewed recipe & yet it is the top rated list. Just am not getting this rating thing.
