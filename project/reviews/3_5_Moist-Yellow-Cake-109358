We made this recipe as cupcakes. It was very dense and not the best tasting. The batter did not taste the best but we baked it anyway. They were too dense and hard. (However, we did over-bake it a couple of minutes.) there was very little vanilla taste. We baked another recipe.

This is truly the worst yellow cake I HAVE EVER MADE! It was bland, not particularly sweet and wholly unremarkable. I was extremely disappointed. I think it's safe to say I won't be making this cake again.

I'm not giving a starred review because I used 2 2/3 cup sifted all purpose flour instead of cake flour. Based on other reviews that used AP or whole wheat bread flour with a "perfect" result, I thought it had a pretty good chance of at least moderate success. With the exception of the flour and the baking time (mine was done at 25 minutes, oven temp is accurate) I followed the directions to the letter. The FLAVOR of the cake is absolutely lovely, especially when chilled overnight. I did not find it eggy or excessively rich. It is very moist with a good crumb. But the texture is much closer to pound cake than anything else. I used lemon curd as a filling and the mascarpone frosting from the lemon layer cake on this site and it was delicious in its way. But not a light and fluffy cake - I have no idea how another cook got that result with bread flour.

This will be my "go to" yellow cake from now on. It was as moist and delicious as I had hoped! I used regular flour instead of cake and added a bit of baking soda otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Yum yum!

Not a huge fan of this recipe, which I found somewhat bland and a too cakey for my taste. I followed the recipe to the letter but it came out more dry than I would have liked. Paired it with the chocolate buttercream recipe which was delicious, but in combination it was still only meh.

Wow - fluffy and moist. Even with some substitutions this recipe made 3 9-inch layers for me. I only had salted butter, so cut the salt to 1/2 teaspoon; no buttermilk, so used 3/4 cup of lactose-free 1% milk and 3/4 cup of greek yogurt (organic, no additives.) As per another reviewer I added about 3/4 teaspoon of soda and 3/4 teaspoon of vinegar to sour the milk. Everything else was as the recipe calls for. I beat the dickens out of the batter, as instructions said, and the foamy soft batter was a dream. (I could have just eaten that and been happy.) I over-filled two of the 9-inch pans - the foamy batter did rise but didn't overflow, but I had to bake them for about 35 minutes and the tops did get a bit too brown. The 3rd pan, less full, baked in 25 minutes and was luscious.

This was a really good cake recipe. I've tried many basic yellow cake recipes and there was always a problem, but with this one my cake came out wonderful. I made cupcakes, the batter made 24 cupcakes. The cooking time was about 30minutes. The cake was moist,light and fluffy; the key components of a good cake. But all in all this was a great recipe, will definately be making this my base cake recipe.

Just made some cupcakes to test out this recipe yesterday and WOW! This is the softest, most delicious, moist cake ever! I can't wait to make a full cake with it now. The only thing I changed was added almond and vanilla extract otherwise followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect! Halving the reicpe makes 18 wonderful cupcakes. Now if only I could find a great buttercream recipe to compliment that great cake!

After a miserable failure from another well known baking website, I was in a mad scramble to find another recipe and bake a cake in a matter of hours. I found this after searching, and I must say, this is absolutely the perfect cake! It just can't get any better! So simple but so tender and lovely, fantastic flavour and most importantly, moist. This is going in my permanent cookbook and will be used for birthdays time and time again!

This was my first attempt at a yellow cake and it was just OK. The most disappointing thing is that the sides of my cake are hard - could it be my nonstick 9" round pans? Perhaps, but I did bake them for just about 42 minutes and yes the edges pulled away from the sides, but we're overdone in my mind. The cake is rather crumbly, and although I followed the recipe to a tee, I still had air bubbles in mine...next time I'd drop it a few times on the counter and cook it for less time.

Rating: 4
Oh my goodness. This is fantastic. Mine ended up more white than yellow, but that might have to do with the colour of my yolks and butter than an error in the recipe. No matter; they are super moist, not too sweet. Perfect fodder for buttercream icing! Although the recipe did not call for it, I added in a teaspoon of baking SODA; with the use of buttermilk it just makes it even fluffier because it rises more. I used AP flour also as I was out of cake flour. I have the feeling this will be my go-to staple from now on! And YES!!! monitor your baking times; if it gets golden on top, you've baked it too long! (It should almost have no colour on top.)

I made this cake today as the recipe was written and ended up with lovely, buttery layers that were light and tender. The only minor change was that I baked these in 9" cake pans which were what I had handy. I need to try it again, but this may become my go-to recipe for yellow cake layers. The recipe was easy to follow and the results were exceptional.

Very moist cake. Worth the extra minutes to make. However i had to watch the time it was done well before recommended baking time

Spent lots of time searching for recipes and ultimately chose this one. I tend to stick to chocolate cake because I haven't had the best luck with white/yellow cake. This one worked well. I made it by hand as I do not have an electric mixer and it was a chore but worth the effort. It made about 30 cupcakes. They are on day 3 today and still taste moist and fresh so they keep well. My husband said they were almost too gummy and moist for him but I think that's better than too crumbly! And I think he had one from a corner of the pan that may have been 2 minutes underdone...

This is my favorite yellow cake recipe. I find that if I use 1 1/2 cups buttermilk and bake for 35min, the cake has a more moist texture. Banging the pan on the counter is important, as bubbles tend to form in the batter.

Rating: 4
I fall into the camp of best yellow cake ever. It has a lovely texture and a rich flavor. I have a few suggestions that I followed from other reviewers. First of all, I use organic ingredients. This is especially important for the buttermilk since most buttermilks have preservatives, stabilizers, and thickeners. I find those effect both the flavor and the performance of the buttermilk. Secondly, DON'T skimp on creaming the sugar and butter. I did all 12 tedious minutes of creaming, with a hand held mixer no less, but it gives the batter this amazing puffy texture. Lastly, IGNORE the cooking time. I baked cupcakes for 15 minutes and 9" cakes for 32 minutes.

Really, this recipe is darn near foolproof. I'm making it again for the second time, again with bread flour (reduced to 2.5C to compensate), had to use 0.5C canola oil and 0.5C butter and it still came out perfect! I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!! The only trick to the whole thing is to beat the flour/oil until it's a beautiful fluffy mass, then alternate adding the buttermilk and dry ingredients. It really is easy, and tastes delicious.

Rating: 4
Well, I do not know what the other cooks were doing when they decided to bake this cake. But I have just finished baking the cake and as one of the other cooks stated I followed the recipe to a T. The cake looks, smells and tastes just as good. The buttermilk was an awesome choice. I will truly make this cake again. Usually I will not subscribe to a website just to comment on the recipe but this one was worth it.

Rating: 4
Well, I'm not sure what all the fuss is about this cake being dry. Quite the opposite here for me. I do subscribe to the idea that you should beat/cream your butter and sugar for an absurd amount of time to get a fluffier end product. Something my baking instructor was adamant about in my classes. I (unfortunately due to pantry limitations) had to use bread flour. I reduced it by 0.5C, and the results are fabulous. I substituted 1 tsp each of almond and vanilla extract instead of just vanilla. Personal preference. The only thought I have is that, as usual, the people who make ninety-million changes to the recipe, don't read thoroughly and carefully are probably blame for poor results. I believe this recipe is solid, the rations are all reasonable. My recommendation: read the recipe, lay out everything, read the recipe again, do the first step, read the recipe, do the second step, reread the recipe, and so on. You'll be pleasantly surprised. This cake is delicious when made correctly.

This cake was not moist at all. It's a really simple recipe that's easy to make and that's why I chose this recipe. I only had 50 minutes to make a cake. But next time, I would rather buy a cake mix at the store. Don't waste your time. The cake was dry.

Rating: 4
This recipe is stupendous. Moist and wonderful! I followed ingredients exactly but added a small box of instant pudding to the dry ingredients, also I always use caster sugar. I didn't really follow the preparation guidelines at all because I have a particular way I put a yellow cake batter together. Cream room temp butter and caster sugar until white and fluffy (this takes TIME, leave the mixer for 5 min or so). Add room temp eggs 1 at a time and mix well. Sift dry ingredients together. Combine buttermilk and vanilla. With the mixer speed set to slowest setting, add 1/4 dry, then 1/3 wet, and so on starting and ending with dry ingredients. Bake at 170C. Once the cake has cooled some, I recommend leveling off the top browned crust because it will be extra sugary and the cake underneath is perfect. If your cake didn't turn out moist you did something wrong. Don't feel bad, though, baking takes a lot of practice (believe me I've made many an unfortunate cornbread).

Ok for all of you that said that you didn't like this recipe and you followed it very closely maybe you shouldn't have. I say follow everything to the T but when it comes time to put it in the oven you may not want to bake it for as long as it says. I baked it for 35 minutes in all and the cake was wounderful OMG I love this recipe. So I would suggest to all to set their timers for less time then it says. Happy baking.

I'm a little baffled: this cake was a bit dense and had a gritty texture, almost like cornbread, as a few reviewers have commented. (I was just hoping they were wrong!) I followed the recipe very closely, being sure to beat the butter and subsequent additions for the full times indicated. I guess I'm still in search of a sweet, moist, and light yellow cake recipe. Sigh.

I have been using this recipe for about 6 years; it is hands down the best cake recipe--ever. We use it for cakes and cupcakes with a basic cream frosting on top or none at all. As I live in France, I popped the recipe into Google Translate and came up with the proper metric measurements. Here they have no buttermilk, so I simply use real cream. Everyone raves about this cake!

Rating: 2
Since I'm living in Germany without American measuring tools, at first I was excited that there were metric measurements. But these measurements are greatly off. I wanted to make a double batch so 900 g of sugar is 2 pound of sugar or a full bag. This must have been wrong. My cake was extremely dense. The taste was good, but wasn't as expected to be light, moist, and fluffy. It tasted more like a pound cake.

Good yellow cake recipe ... it was moist. I made a two layer cake and used whipped cream between the layers with a chocolate frosting on top and sides. It is a sturdy cake that could be used to cut into different shapes. I will use recipe again.

Rating: 4
I will say this is the best tasting cake batter ever. The cake itself turned out lovely. If you whip the butter and sugar long enough, the cake shouldn't come out too dense. In my lust for vanilla, I added just a little extra. Yeah...don't do that.

Rating: 2
I followed the directions with 2 exceptions, regular flour instead of cake flour, and 1/2 cup yogurt and 3/4 cup milk in place of the buttermilk. The texture was like pound cake - very dense and buttery. I was looking for more of a "birthday cake" type of cake. Therefore the icing and filling that I had planned clashed with the cake. This recipe would be best as a coffee cake type cake or as a bundt cake with walnuts, etc. I don't recommend this recipe if you are looking for a substitute for a boxed yellow cake mix.

Rating: 2
I thought this was a good basic cake, but not exceptional. It was very buttery and tasted more like a pound cake than I expected. Also made far too much batter - I followed the recipe precisely and my 8" cake pans overflowed in the oven. Made a mess and I fear also made the cake heavier (maybe why it had the consistency of a pound cake) because it couldn't rise properly. I would suggest using a larger / deeper pan than the recipe calls for or trusting your instincts not to over-fill (I worried the pans looked awfully full when I popped them in the oven).

This cake wasn't moist - it had a coarse consistency like cornbread. Won't make this recipe again.

This cake was divine! I followed the recipe more closely than I usually do, and still made changes. I used regular all-purpose flour, separated the eggs and whipped the whites and yolks individually before adding to creamed butter/sugar mixture, and substituted vanilla yogurt/soymilk mixture for buttermilk. I also used lemon extract and some orange zest. Baked them in 2-8 inch pans. They were done at exactly 35 mins. I'm so glad I checked early. Layered with homemade strawberry jam, fresh strawberries and ricotta/buttercream filling, and frosted with whipped cream. I cut huge chunks of it and gave it out - even the ones who said it was too much cake polished it off in no time. They all said the same thing: this is the best cake I've ever eaten! I can see using this cake with many fillings, frostings, etc. A keeper!

This cake cooked up great for me. I made it into cupcakes and it made 36 with a little batter left over. The flavor is very good, if a tad sweet. Next time I will add some extra vanilla extract or add the insides of a vanilla bean. I should mention I replaced 1/2 cup of the cake flour with a box of vanilla instant pudding powder to make the cake very soft and moist. The consistency was perfect, the cake is light, tender and moist. The cupcakes fell a little bit when baking but I don't mind since I'll be filling them with vanilla custard and then frosting them with chocolate (Boston Cream Cupcakes); no one will be able to tell they fell. Definitely give this recipe a chance, it's very touchy as far as the cooking time goes. I set my oven timer for 17 minutes and then started checking every 2 minutes with a toothpick. With cake recipe's from scratch if they're overcooked even a couple of minutes they will come out dry.

Wow! This cake is amazing. I made it with regular flour (minus two tablespoons per cup). I wanted a banana cake, and I added two super, super ripe bananas with the last quarter cup of sugar. The cake is very light and tastes like caramelized bananas. Amazing. I made chocolate pudding to use as frosting. I might try cutting the butter next time.

I just made this as a birthday present for myself this weekend. Absolutely wonderful!! I was afraid that I wouldn't have enough cake (wanted a towering masterpiece), so I doubled the recipe and used almond extract instead (didn't have any good vanilla on hand). It was delicious, like other reviewers, I followed the directions exactly with regards to beating times and all. It's best served room temperature. I stored my cake in the fridge and found it had the best flavor and texture once it had been allowed to sit out for about 2 hours. Just an fyi for someone making it ahead of time. The flavor just got better and better the longer it sat. I'd recommend making it two days ahead of time, to really maximize the taste on the big serving day. Regardless, this is a wonderful recipe that I'll be using again and again!! Wahoo! :-) I love baking!

This was a great recipe. My boyfriend is extremely picky about his desserts, but absolutely loved this recipe.

My husband and myself really enjoyed this cake. It is as described, moist and light. After reading the reviews, these are the some changes i have made for the perfect outcome. Halfed the recipe because I didn't have two 8"x2" pans, only got one 8"x 1 and 1/2" pan and some review claim that it overflows. So I used an 8" springform pan. Didn't have cake flour so used all purpose flour and arrowroot. Sift the flour and others after measuring it while some reviewer claim to measure it after sifting. I also added a drop of Almond extract which kick it up a notch. I baked the cake for 40 mins. The cake was wonderfully moist, its like there was syrup, it is so light and fluffy. Wonderful, will definitely make it again.

Wonderful recipe! Delicious, moist yellow cake. I made it dairy free (not vegan, though) substituting Earth Balance Soy Garden spread for the butter and full fat soy milk and lemon juice for the buttermilk. Mixed the ingredients similar to Ina Garten's way with butter cakes and baked for 40 minutes (I had checked at 35 minutes, but cake wasn't done). I think the key to getting a good result is what has been said by others - do NOT over mix during the last step and know your oven. Pull cake out when there are a few moist crumbs attached to toothpick as opposed to clean. Cake will be moist, not dry. I've already made this recipe twice in just a few days. The taste and texture are excellent even after the first day. I also added mini chocolate chips and some almond extract to the batter and slathered my favorite chocolate frosting all over once cake cooled. Yum!!!!

If the sign of a great recipe is how much you can alter it and still get a fantastic result, than this is a winner. I made many substitutions -- 1 1/2 C spelt flour, 1 C white flour, 1/2 C finely ground flaxseed INSTEAD of 3 C cake flour; 3 whole eggs and two egg whites INSTEAD of 5 eggs; 1/3 C butter and 1/3 C oil INSTEAD of 1 C butter; 1 C sugar, 2/3 C agave syrup INSTEAD of 2 C sugar. Despite my mucking around, the resulting cupcakes were light, fluffy and had a marvelous crumb. Although they are significantly healthier, nothing about the final cupcakes scream "I'm good for you." They just taste fantastic.

Great flavor and texture but my cake did not really qualify as moist. Followed the recipe but baked as a sheet cake for a child's birthday cake (Star Wars scene/characters on top). Baked at 325 for 40 minutes. I think this cake would be delicious with a variety of frostings. I chose a vanilla cream cheese frosting per my son's request which adults and kids seemed to like. Will definitely make this one again and try tweaking to make more moist.

Excellent yellow cake recipe. I did follow the recipe exactly, but I used it for cupcakes and it made 3 dozen standard size (fill cups no more than 1/2 - 2/3rds full as this recipe does have more than usual baking powder and will rise more than most). I baked the cupcakes in a convection oven at 325 for 16 minutes, one pan at a time. They turned out great, nice flavor and light texture - not at all dense yet still substantial. I don't know if I would describe them as overly "moist" but I can say they were NOT dry - at all. I piped chocolate cream cheese and vanilla cream cheese frosting on top. Perfectly delicious!!!

HAVE MERCY, this cake is fantastic! I had to make some changes. Sorry for not following the ingredient directions for you guys out there that are sticklers; however, I used what I had on hand! I used half-n- half instead of buttermilk, I baked for only 30 minutes and used 9" pans. Just eating the toppings that I had to slice off to ice the cake evenly is shamefully delightful! This cake is sweet and as it says in the description it IS MOIST. I used my food processor and it rose BEAUTIFULLY! Some of you kitchen-aid snobs might believe this to be blasphemous! ;) I did follow the directions for adding everything very slowly, gradually and precisely to get the air in the batter that is desired. All I have to say is BEAUTIFUL and delicious! This is my go-to yellow cake recipe from now on! I wish I had some buttermilk on hand, but next time if I don't, I will make the buttermilk homemade in order to try it with that flavor. I am SURE it would have been divine and add would have added just the right sourness.

With the addition of 1/4tsp almond extract and 1 tsp princess cake and cookie emulsion this cake is incredible. I have tried three yellow layer recipes so far, and nothing compares to this one. Hands down, not even comparable. Soft, even rising. Easy to get out of the pan. Tender crumb, and most importantly MOIST. To those that thought it was dry, I have a few suggestions. -Make sure you use cake flour. Sift it before measuring. -Get an oven thermometer and USE IT. Once I got one, I realized why my cakes were not rising evenly, and getting dry! My oven runs about 15 degrees too hot, and we are at a high elevation. It is invaluable info to know. Now I follow the oven thermometer and not the displayed temp. -Follow all mixing instructions to the TEE. Time the minutes, actually do the small additions and scrape down after each one. One more thing I will mention. The grams in parenthesis by the US Measurement (cups etc) are, according to my digital scale, inaccurate. Every brand of flour, sugar etc weighs a little differently. I recommend weighing AND measuring in cups to determine if they are accurate for you before relying on the scale alone. I used explicitly cups etc for this recipe with great results. ENJOY! THis recipe is my new best friend. THANK YOU!

Pretty great cake recipe, would make again. I checked this cake at 25 minutes and it was done. If I pulled it out at 23 minutes it may have deserved a four fork rating! Pull it out at the right time and it will be moist, despite what the other reviews may say! I used 1 1/2 cups sugar and 1 cup whole milk french vanilla yogurt instead of buttermilk. Had to add 1/3 cup milk into the yogurt to get the right moisture/consistency. Also added 2 tsp. almond extract. Used orange buttercream and raspberry jam between the layers. DELICIOUS!

I followed this recipe barring 2 things; I added a slight almond flavor (via extract) and I took the advice of several reviewers and baked it for less time (35-40 minutes). Though the flavor of the cake was good and the "fullness" of the cake was beautiful, once frosted, I found that this cake was too dense for my taste. This denseness make it a bit more dry than I would have liked, although I can't really say that it was a "dry" cake. Everyone who had a piece loved it, so this is probably just a preference thing in terms of substance, not flavor.

I have used this recipe since February 2007 and have made wonderful moist yellow cakes! I follow the recipe but decrease the baking time.

Today I'm trying 2 nine inch pans -- I'm sure it'll be as good and moist as always.

I am very happy with this recipe. I used it to make cupcakes instead of a layer cake. I've had a very hard time finding a good yellow cupcake recipe, which seemed strange to me. I don't really like buying buttermilk because its never sold in quantities smaller than quarts, so instead I used half sour cream and half whole milk, which honestly worked very well. I set the oven temp to 350 and baked them for 20 minutes. I find it to be very helpful when baking to A: allow your oven to sit at its preheated temperature for about 15 - 20 minutes before actually baking anything and B: keep an oven thermometer in the oven so you can read what the actual temperature is, not just what your oven tells you it is. That way you know if its running cold or hot and you can have a much more precise and predictable baking experience. All in all, I am very satisfied.

Really liked it. I followed it almost exactly being an inexperienced baker, right down to timing how much I beat the batter at every stage. My only modification was to use nine inch pans and reduced baking times per the other reviews. I pulled it out at 35, it seemed done but then the middle looked not totally done after it had cooled for 10 minutes when I picked at teh center. Put it back in for 5-7 more minutes and wished I hadn't, it was the smallest bit dry. Everyone loved it though. I will make this again but go with my gut more on the baking time.

I made this cake last night and it is delicious! The only reason for the 3 forks (instead of 4) is that this recipe should really include instructions on using different pan sizes. I used a bundt pan, and reduced the heat to a little more than 325 and increased the baking time to about 60 minutes. For cupcakes, I would keep the temp at 350 and bake for about 20 min. Also, if you find that the cake is a little too dense (I like dense cake) check your oven temp and add 1/4 - 1/2 tsp baking SODA.

I made these into cupcakes, and the batter was gorgeous, so perhaps it was my oven or something to do with how I beat it, because the cupcakes came out rather flat and dense. The flavor was good, and they were moist enough, but just dense. Maybe it works better as a cake?

I am not an experienced baker so I took extra care in following the recipe to the letter, including timing how long I spent beating in between additions. I substituted the vanilla extract with coconut extract and half of the buttermilk with pineapple juice. Then I made a pineapple filling (jam) and added coconut extract to the buttercream icing. The result: a fantastic pina colada cake that was a hit with family and friends. It was moist and had a lovely fine texture. Everyone loved it!!

I made this recipe for a party on the spur of the moment based on the reviews and they didn't lie! This is the absolute best yellow cake I've ever made! I followed the reciped except I didn't have cake flour and it was still exceptional. For those who say it's dry, I can only suggest watching the cooking time. I set my timer for 5 minutes prior to the suggested cooking time and check the cake every minute or two. Guaranteed perfection!

I thought this recipe was delicious. I made it into cupcakes, though: 1 dozen regular size and 3 dozen minis. It was quite easy to overbake the minis, and one tray of them ended up a little over done. I think the complaints of toughness may be attributable to overbaking, particularly because of the high egg content of this recipe. The ones that were perfectly baked had a tight, moist crumb, and a rich vanilla flavor. I topped them with a smooth dark chocolate ganache, and they were a HUGE hit.

Versatile, moista lovely cake. Make sure all your ingredients are at room temperature. I don't think the sie of the pan effects the outcome. You need to adjust baking time to the size of your pan. I used two 9 X 2 pans sprayed with that baking Pam stuff. Flipped right out. Took about 30 minutes to bake and I switched the pans around in the oven so they would brown more evenly. I've made the cake a couple of times now. This time, I used lemon juice and finely grated lemon zest, omitting the vanilla, as I plan on cutting the cake in half (with dental floss) to make four layers), filling it with lemon butter cream enhanced with some lemon curd and finishing it with a meringue I'll brown with a baking torch. The cake has a wonderful crumb and indeed is moist without being sticky.

Excellent recipe. You must use professional size 8x2" cake pans, not 8x1 1/2" pans found at most markets and department stores or the cake will overflow. And using a wider pan (9") is not the same as using the correct 8x2" This may be why some folks are getting a dry result.

I thought this was a tasty cake, and was easy to mix up with my stand mixer. I liked the flavor that the buttermilk gives it. My cake was pale yellow with a very fine crumb, not too dense. Having said that, I used 8 x 1 1/2 inch pans and had a bit of overflow into my oven. Guess 8 x 2 is necessary! Also, my cakes took 43 minutes to bake. Used chocolate raspberry frosting, yum.

I agree with the positive reviews of this recipe. I made this cake for my sister's birthday and it has a very fine, soft, moist crumb. I did make a few minor adjustments to the recipe. 1) I put in an extra teaspoon of vanilla, and this gave it a really wonderful aroma; 2) I was in a bit of a rush, so I did NOT beat it for a full minute after each sugar addition; 3) I reserved about 1.5 cups of the final batter and added about 1/3 cup cocoa (I used Bellagio "Sipping Chocolate") and swirled in dollops of the batter to make a gorgeous marble cake. This yellow cake is quite pale, so the chocolate areas were striking. It does take an entire 45 minutes to bake, even if you used 9 inch cake pans instead of 8 inch pans, as I did. This is a really lovely cake. Fully cool it before icing, as it can be occasionally delicate.

This is the best yellow cake recipe ever. I recommend it constantly. I've made it MANY times and it's always completely delicious. Please disregard the review referring to it as a "flustercluck" as if you continue reading the person complains about their own decision to completely not follow the instructions. -moron- Follow the instructions explicitly and you will have fantastic results. I layer my cake with a quality raspberry preserve and a center layer of chocolate ganache which i then drench the entire cake in. Always a favorite!

Rating: 1
Man was this cake a flustercluck. I only have one 8x8 in pan, and was too impatient to bake twice, so I made it in one 9x13. At 40 mins, the outsides were nicely cooked and light brown, but the inside was soup. I tried turning it down (my mother later scolded me for my foolishness) and cooking it longer. Luckily, the cake finished baking and didn't flop. On to the result: moist, med-dense, and tounge-curling. Tastes like buttermilk (which is deceptively gross tasting despite its name) and was not sweet at all (I followed the recipe exactly, minus the baking problem). My husband had one slice and refused to have another; given his utter lack of standards for things he will eat, this is pretty good proof that the cake was blech. And to add insult to injury, I made the absolute wrong kind of frosting for this unsweet, buttermilk cake. I made a whipped cream icing (my first) which was better suited for a less dense, less flavorful, and more sweet cake (the Oct '91 recipe on here for choc whipped cream icing). This cake needs a nice dark ganache icing to distract you from its curdling taste. Maybe it was my baking malady that gave me the bad result, but I don't know if a correct baking job would erase that bitter buttermilk taste. Good luck with this one.

This cake is everything it promises like the other reviewers state: moist, tender, large crumb for a cake flour cake which I prefer. Its the recipe I was long searching for after many expensive baking books over the years. I froze the iced cake overnight and it became very dense :( so I wouldn't recommend freezing it for any length of time. Delicious out of the oven and even the scrapes on the counter the next day are tasty!

I followed the recipe exact except I made 2 dozen cupcakes instead of a cake. These resulted in a very fluffy cupcake almost comparable to angel cake. The recipe instructions suggest to mix the granulated sugar in with the butter by 1/4 cup; mixing the batter for an entire minute after each addition. This made the butter and sugar very fluffy. End results were a success. I baked the cupcakes at 350º for 15 minutes. These cupcakes are light, smooth, subtle sweetness, over all delicious!

Excellent cake for decorating. Other reviewers have expressed doubts about flour types. Be sure to use Cake Flour (Soft as Silk is a well-known brand)...grocery stores often stock it next to the cake mixes. Other flour types cannot be substituted when making cake! That said, a moist filling improves this cake. I made lemon curd and the end result was delicious.

I made this cake for my friends birthday and it was a complete success!!! The only thing that i changed was i used skim milk, instead of buttermilk, and did all the stirring by hand(i have no electric mixer available!)

I just made this recipe as cupcakes. I followed the recipe exactly. I don't think I ever mixed a batter quite so much. It was very fluffy. It also made a big difference where I placed the pans in the oven. Some were perfect, others a bit flat on top. However, on to the important part -- the taste -- neither my daughter or husband liked them. One complained they were too "eggy" in flavor. The other hated the texture. Too light. I thought they were "OK." I will have to redeem them with the frosting -- which I have not decided on as yet.

Moist does not belong in the title. I read the reviews and, sure enough, they were done 25 -27 minutes later. I was hoping this would prevent my cake from turning out dry like other reviews had commented, but it did not. The flavor is good, but I was glad I was serving it to friends and not someone I actually needed/wanted to impress. Will not use again.

This is a great cake. I am making several cakes for upcoming events and have made 10 batches of this in the last several days. It freezes well. One thing that works well is to butter the cake pan, then line with parchment, then butter the parchment. comes out of the pan without problem. The other "trick" that most experienced bakers know is that the CAKE FLOUR is critical. Anyone who ended up with a dry cake should be sure to use the correct flour.

I made this cake today, following the recipe EXACTLY and all I can say is that it was anything but moist. The flavor was good and benign enough to work with many different types of fillings/icings, but it was DRY. It crumbled quite a bit after taking out of the pan, with several chunks coming out around the sides of the cake. It was not overbaked as I took it out prior to the time given in the recipe. I suspect this cake works best when using a simple syrup on the layers to add moisture and flavor. I made two 8" round cakes but there's enough batter to make three cakes. It was quite a disappointment as so many of my fellow cake decorators really like Toba Garrett's cake recipes.

A really light and fluffy cake. Really tender with a fine crumb. A little too crumbly though. Made a 2 layer 8 inch cake (which by the way, had no problem with overflowing while baking) and when I cut through it a lot of crumbs were created. Not sure if I'll use this recipe again. Next time I'm going to try using all-purpose flour instead of cake flour.

I made this cake the other day, careful to follow the directions after reading all the reviews. The end result was a soft, moist yellow cake. It wasn't flat, it had volume, but I wouldn't exactly describe it as 'fluffy'. I made two 8-inch cakes, brushed each layer with sugar syrup (boil equal amounts of water and granulated sugar for 2-3 minutes, use once it's cooled off. this prevents thick creamy frostings like buttercream from making the cake soggy.) I used the cream cheese buttercream frosting recipe from the ORANGE LAYER CAKE WITH BUTTERCREAM FROSTING AND BERRIES recipe on epicurious, from Bon Appétit, June 2006, minus the orange flower water. I soaked banana slices in lime juice to keep them from turning brown, and put a layer of them in the buttercream between the two cake layers. On the top and sides I put fresh slices of strawberries and blueberries. The fruit and frosting combo tasted amazing, and the entire cake was decent, but next time I think I'll use a fluffier, lighter tasting cake. I did use softasilk cake flour. While the sugar syrup kept the icing from sogging up the cake, it unfortunately did seep into the cake somewhat, making it a bit less soft on the edges. Also, the icing I used was delicious, but it is a pain to navigate with for more than ten minutes at a time. All around, made a decent, pretty cake. But I probably will not make it again, just because it's not what I needed, not because it's not a good recipe!

The earlier reviewer who left the "food scientists" comment about bitterness in this cake was wrong: if you have baking soda in a cake but not enough acidic ingredients in the cake to counteract it, you will get a residual bitterness. But you can use buttermilk as this cake does without leaving any bitterness behind; extra acid might add a touch of tangy, sour flavor, but it won't be bitter. In this recipe, the buttermilk reacts with the baking soda contained in the baking powder to provide a leavening effect.

Rating: 3
This is a fabulous yellow cake. I used it to prepare Boston Cream Pie cupcakes. In the future I would only use this idea for a full size layer cake. The cupcakes were so tender that slicing them in half to fill with the cream filling resulted in lopsided cupcakes. I agree with another reviewer that the length of time that the cake should be baked needs to be shortened. Start checking for doneness after 30-35 minutes.

I was hesitant to make this because food scientists will tell you that a cake made with buttermilk or sour cream and no baking soda will have a bitter aftertaste, but I took up the dare. Although this cake baked up light, it did have the expected aftertaste. Higher ratings might come from hiding the bitterness with lots of frosting or strong flavors such as amaretto, chocolate or peanut butter. I might remake it substituting 1/2 tsp. baking soda for same amount of BP.

I made the cake exactly as described and it turned out too dry. Not moist as the title describes. It was probably from overmixing as you had to mix while slowly incorporating the ingredients. I would not make this cake again and search for a new recipe.

I think this is one of the best yellow cake recipes out there, however, I added applesauce which made the cake even more moist and please, please only bake it for 30-35 mins on 330-350 degrees. The time on the recipe is way too long for a good moist cake. Don't forget to add at least 1/2 cup of applesauce. Enjoy!!!

This cake was absolutely delicious tasting (not too sweet, and the butter flavor really shines) but the crumb was a bit too tender and loose. I made the recipe as cupcakes, so I was still able to frost with a pastry bag, but I don't think it would hold up well to a spatula as a cake. Next time, I will replace half the cake flour with unbleached, all purpose, and see if that gives it a bit more structure. I also think this would be fabulous as a lemon cake, using a tablespoon of lemon zest and replacing some of the buttermilk with lemon juice - yum!!

This is BY FAR the BEST yellow cake recipe you can ever use. Always impressive, I first came across this recipe at a cake decorating class and got my hands on the high-yield commercial kitchen version. Thank GOD I found a domestic version on here! In about 4 months I made this cake over a dozen times. It was in such high-demand and it's just the best! It's a little laborious but man is it WORTH the effort! If you're not a decorating pro... Just make the cakes, layer with ganache & DUMP the leftover ganache over the entire cake. Nobody (but probably those picky people who went to the CIA and other culinary schools) will NOT LOVE it. :)

I've been in search of a good tasting, from-scratch yellow cake with nice texture, and this one fits the bill. The flavor is buttery (reminds me of the taste of a butter cookie), and the texture is downy and soft with a fairly tight crumb. The only caveat to this recipe is that the top and sides of the cake turned out quite crusty; I needed to trim not only the top of the cake (which I always do anyway to level it), but also the sides. But it's worth it to get at what's inside: a delicious, high-quality yellow cake. I made mine into a "PB&J" cake by layering with peanut butter filling and raspberry jam. It was truly delicious and all those who tasted it agreed. So, this recipe is a keeper. : )

Very disappointing... I too have been baking for years.. tried and tested many recipes... was happy to find a "moist" yellow cake with so many good reviews. I followed the recipe to a "tee" and considered using 9" pans instead of 8" when I saw how much batter there was. It trusted the reviews and used 8" pans. I have a burnt mess in the oven to clean up.

This is a really excellent yellow cake recipe. It's not dry or too dense but it has enough moisture and weight to handle most frostings. I used the cake as a base for a toffee trifle cake (split into four layers, brushed w/ amaretto and topped each with spiked whipped cream frosting and toffee bits). Everyone raved and said that the cake layers were amazing. I think the sour cream really adds an important layer to the flavors involved. Also, instead of vanilla extract I used vanilla paste (from TJ's) and it gave the cake beautiful vanilla bean flecks throughout. Wonderful and I'll be using this as my standard yellow cake from now on!

Perhaps one of the best cakes I have ever made. And I cook every day at my Bed and Breakfast. Follow the recipe exactly - the flavor is excellent the crumb is perfect.

I baked this cake for my birthday, and it turned out well, although I found it to be a little heavy and slightly dry. It was better the next day, however.

I served it with a buttercream frosting, and my family loved it! I still prefer a cake mix, I have to admit.

The cake had quite a few air-bubbles eventhough I dropped it on the counter a few times, but it certainly didn't affect the taste. Will probably make it again!

This is a relatively easy, satisfying layer cake. I made it in 9-inch pans and baked them for 40 minutes - next time I'll do 37. They were still moist and firm, with a nice mild flavor. I found the layers to be moist, yet with the denseness that homemade (not from a mix) cakes often have, if they are not sponge. I filled the layers with strawberry jam, fresh strawberries, and buttercream, and iced buttercream (recipe from The Magnolia Bakery) all around for a lovely birthday cake.

I actually did a variation of this recipe because I read about the icecream cake that no one liked that used melted icecream and cake mix. I was intrigued w/the idea of using Ben & Jerry's Cherry Garcia icecream in a cake recipe. And I wanted to make a trifle for my housewarming -- or studio warming. So I chose this recipe, cut it in half and instead of using buttermilk, used about two thirds of a carton of B&J icecream, and a couple of tablespoons of buttermilk. And since I was making a trifle and since I was using icecream I cut the sugar to a little less than half (so used a little less than half a cup for a half recipe). The cake comes out very moist & buttery and for me was dense like a poundcake. It was very good!

It really was moist. Easy, but takes a while to prepare since you have to beat the butter/eggs/buttermilk/etc. for specific periods of time (which you can't skip 'cause that's what makes it moist!!). I baked in a 9 inch pan for about 35 minutes; it was definitely done on the outside (a few more minutes and it would have been burned) but still slightly undercooked inside. My boyfried really loved it, though, and it went great with light whipped ganache from The Cake Bible. I'll probably make it again, but put it in different pans.

I did a bit of a "mix and match" with recipes and found the end result fairly tasty. I made this yellow cake recipe the day before, as one of the reviewers suggested, and found that it was very moist the next day. I baked the cake in 9 inch pans for ~35 minutes, then split the layers and filled them with the orange curd from the "Triple Layer White Cake with Orange Curd Filling and Frosting" and iced the cake with the chocolate-orange buttercream from the devil's food cake recipe (with a hint of grand marnier!). Then I topped the whole thing with fresh berries. People seemed to really enjoy the chocolate-orange combo. This seems like a very flexible yellow cake recipe that I will be sure to use again soon.

This cake was very easy to make and it definitely delivers what it promises, a moist cake. It was prepared as a birthday cake and topped with homemade chocolate frosting.

This was a delicious example of a classic yellow birthday cake. I used a kitchen timer for the mixing, had all my ingredients at room temperature and used the lowest setting on my mixer when incorporating the flour mixture and buttermilk. I baked it in 2 9-inch pans for about 35 minutes. I let them cool in the pan about 10 minutes before inverting onto a rack, which nicely flattened the top so I didn't have to trim them down when stacking the layers (I actually made two batches for a towering 4-layer cake.)

This is an easy, moist cake recipe. Be sure to follow the recipe: really beat the butter/sugar and DON'T overmix the milk/dry ingredients - overmixing is what makes the cake too heavy. I do most of the mixing of dry ingredients by hand. This is a nice fluffy,light cake, so let it cool in the pan, or it will crack when you remove it. I made slight changes: an extra 1/8 c of sugar and 3-4 tbl of butter. Also, used whole milk instead of buttermilk. Delicious!

Perfection. Perfectly "moist" and nice and tall. Lots of raves on this cake. Made withe simple chocolate icing on the back of the Hershey's Cocoa package. It was a classic birthday cake.

This was an outstanding cake with a fine tender crumb, moist texture and wonderful flavor. I made it in 3 eight inch pans and shortened the cooking time, but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter. I split the layers into 2 for a filled, 6 layer cake. The layers split beautifully and were easy to handle without incident--fortunate, since it was for a special occasion. Nonetheless, I always take on a new recipe with trepidation, because none of the reviewers ever, all agree on the results--varying in satisfaction from 1 to 4 forks. It never ceases to amaze me!

I've finally mastered cake baking with this recipe! I've had problems in the past with my homemade cakes -- too dense, too grainy, or too greasy. I followed the recipe exactly, even used a thermometer to ensure the butter was room temperature (70 F). (I've been guilty in the past of microwaving my butter to speed the process, but now I'm convinced letting the butter sit is worth the wait.) I especially took note of the advice offered by the cook in Boise -- I actually timed the beating of my butter and butter/sugar/egg mixture. I took the mixer off the stand and beat the dry ingredients (alternating with the buttermilk) in by hand, so as to not overmix. The cake was perfectly even, light, moist, and tasted heavenly. I frosted it with a cream cheese frosting. Very good, but I'll try chocolate next time. My office co-workers are actually now eating it for breakfast as I type this.

In order to produce a light and fluffy texture, the butter and sugar must be beaten until light and fluffy. Also, once the flour mixture is added, you need to use a light hand - otherwise, you get heavy, dense cake! I am an experienced, self-taught baker and chef, and it took me years to figure these steps out. If you happen to have a stand mixer, there is an easier way. This method is called the "two stage" method, and is described in "The Cake Bible," by Rose Levy Berenbaum (who contributes articles to this site, by the way).

A very nice texture -- light and moist. I varied the recipe by replacing the buttermilk with pineapple juice, then split the layers (to make four) and put pineapple filling between them. With creamcheese frosting, it was a huge hit.

This is by far the worst cake recipe I have ever made. I followed the directions to the letter, and it turned out dry, heavy, and tasteless. Talk about an uninspired and disappointing use of good ingredients and time. The frosting recipe was just as bad. It was so sweet I had to fold in whipped cream just to make it edible.

I loved this recipe. Tastes great, stands up to being layered and decorated like a sponge cake, but is so much tastier. My cakes were done 10 minutes ahead of schedule, so check it early!
