I should mention that I sauteed diced sweet onion in butter instead of using the pearl onions as I didn't have any at hand.

Made this for our Canadian Thanksgiving dinner last night - very tasty. Will make again. Lovely nutty flavour and appealing-looking. Everyone loved it.

I have made this for three years now and I like it better every time. Not being a true stuffing lover, I was a little hesitant, however this is very fresh and has a wonderful texture. This is perfect for Thanksgiving dinner.
