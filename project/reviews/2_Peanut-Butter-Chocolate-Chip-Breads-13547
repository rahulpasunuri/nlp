I added some extra sugar following the advice of some of the other reviewers. The bread still wasn't that sweet. Some of our family liked the bread, but it's not one I'm going to make again. There are better recipes for this type of bread.

The recipe in Dec., 1990 and 1991 Gourmet are the same. These are moist, moderately chocolately, and not overly sweet. I have been using these (and the other small loaf recipes in the 1990 issue as "supplemental" small gifts. Always get great reviews.

In my opinion, the breads weren't sweet enough. They tasted fine, but not great.
