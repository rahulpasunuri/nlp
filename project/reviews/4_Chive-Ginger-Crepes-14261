Very good recipe. The ginger and chives had great balance.

I make the asian pork crepes to go with my Christmas dinner every year. This year for Thanksgiving I made the crepe batter and made 4 large crepes in a jelly roll pan and baked them in the oven (the smell is heavenly!). I used the large crepes to make a layered vegetable dish using a thin layer of sliced, grilled mushrooms, a layer of spinach with a little camembert and montery jack cheese and a 3rd layer of caramalized onions. I covered it with some Knor creamy garlic sauce. It was fantastic!!

Mmmm, the ginger and chives makes this so flavorful and delicious. Be aware, however, that the consistency is not quite as thin as that of traditional crepes. These are more like thin pancakes.
