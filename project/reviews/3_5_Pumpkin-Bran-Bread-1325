Yes, you can substitute "miller's bran" for the cereal - that's what I did, because I always have it on hand. It probably changed the texture (you can "feel" the bran in the chew, but to me that's not a negative). I used 1 cup white sugar, 1 cup brown, doubled the cinnamon, added a little molasses. Also added raisins - also plan to try with some chopped dates instead of raisins. Used a little of the "saved" sugar plus a little canola oil to make a streusel for top of the loaves (made mini loaves).

this recipe is great! admittedly I made a few changes-that's the fun of cooking isn't it? I didn't have bran flakes but used TJ's high fiber cereal crushed into smaller pieces. I doubled plus a little more in the spice department and cut the sugar to 1/2c white sugar and a 1/2c light brown (oh I made a half batch). instead of oil I just added more pumpkin with a little bit of maple syrup and a little bit of oil, and I didn't have buttermilk so I used greek yogurt with some almond milk. looks like a lot of changes but I tried to stay true to the recipe with what I had. I made muffins and these were so good.

I haven't made this recipe, but I'm considering it. Question: Has anyone tried substituting regular bran for bran flakes? Thanks!

I make these into muffins. Lowfat ones! I add raisins and walnuts and drizzle them with a powdered sugar and milk glaze. They are unbelievable. I do what others said and reduce sugar to 1 c white/ 1 c brown. I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 white. Subbed applesauce for 1/2 of the vegetable oil. Doubled the spices.

I would also sprinkle some turbinado sugar (sugar in the raw) on top of the batter next time, just to give a little crunch on top. I followed others' suggestion to reduce sugar to 2 cups (1 cup brown, 1 cup regular), so I wouldn't feel guilty adding a good sprinkle to the top!

I didn't have buttermilk on hand, so substituted greek yogurt mixed with a little skim milk, and it was super moist.

This recipe is wonderful! I soaked Wheatabix bran flakes in buttermilk just briefly prior to combining the ingredients, and the texture after baking was really satisfying--similar to whole grain bread. I used 1/2 applesauce, half butter in place of oil, and ginger, a bit of clove and cardamom rather than allspice. And, I used half whole wheat flour, half regular. Also, I made muffins, at 400 degrees for 18 minutes, as another reader suggested. This was one of the best balances of moistness and fluffiness that I've ever been able to get in a muffin!

Per other users' suggestions, I made the following changes: reduced the sugar to just under 2 cups, doubled the spices, used 1/2 all- purpose flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour, and used applesauce instead of oil. I also used lowfat buttermilk (by mistake) and it was exceptional. I will definitely make this bread many more times in the future, and perhaps even add pecans? Oh, and PS: I just used generic bran flakes instead of All Bran, and it didn't make the bread crunchy at all.

This is my pumpkin bread/muffin recipe. Forever. It is delicious, moist, flavorful. You will devour it straight out of the oven. I soaked the cereal for a couple of minutes before using. I also used half brown, half white sugar. Didn't find them too sweet..thought they were great! I cut the baking time since I was making muffins. The next day, they did become a bit soggy.

AWESOME! I actually made muffins instead of bread with this recipe (18 minutes at 400degrees) Along with others, I doubled the spices. Cut the sugar in half (and used half brown sugar/ half regular white sugar) And used applesauce instead of oil. Great!

I prepared this recipe as written and thought it turned out well. It is a sweet-tasting bread.

Second attempt: used bran cereal, only 1 cup of sugar, doubled spices, and used smaller loaf pans. Replaced 1/4 c flour with flaxseed, used 1/2 c oil. Added 1 C chopped walnuts and 1/2 c dried cranberries. Result this time was great. Lots of flavor and not too sweet or soggy. Will make great tea sandwiches and gifts. Definitely a good pumpkin flavor.

I couldn't get these loaves to cook fully; ended up with soggy, somewhat flat loaves. Flavor was great with the doubling of spices, and the texture has promise (used Kashi Good Friends cereal soaked in the buttermilk). Also used 1/2 white whole wheat flour, reduced sugar to 2 cups (still too sweet for me), and substituted 1/3 c applesauce for same amount of oil. Hard to tell which change made the difference. Will buy fresh baking powder/sugar and try again.

Like the previous reviewer, I tweaked this a little: Increased the spices, cut out a cup of sugar, subbed a cup of brown sugar and used some ww flour. The result? I absolutely LOVED it. My boyfriend, on the other hand, HATED it. However, I will be making this again for myself soon!

We love this pumpkin bread. I've been making it for years, with the following modifications: substitute whole wheat flour for half the flour (1 1/2 cups); double all spices; omit one cup sugar; substitute brown sugar for half the remaining sugar (1 cup); substitute applesauce for half the oil (1/3 cup). I also soak the bran in the milk (for five minutes) prior to adding it to the wet ingredients. If you like it crunchy, leave it! If not, soak it. This is great with cranberries and/or pecans added to the batter. Freezes very well. Next time I make it, I'll try another reviewer's suggestion and add orange zest!

It was good but too much sugar and oil for me to eat very often.

Other than being a bit generous in measuring the pumpkin puree, I made the recipe exaclty as it is, and it's fabulous. OK, maybe calling a simple quick bread fabulous is a bit much, but it's really good. It's moist, really pumpkiny, and filling, probably from all that bran. So far, this is the best pumpkin bread I've ever made and I will make it again for breakfast or afternoon coffee. Some pumpkin recipes feel too much like autumn to make throughout the year, but this one would be fine anytime.

I ran out of all-purpose flour so had to use whole-wheat instead. I also reversed the amounts of flour and bran and soaked the bran in buttermilk ad I've had problems with crunchiness before. I added some raisins as well. It was pretty good - had a great soft, but firm, texture and a nice taste. I think it would have been better with all-purpose flour, though, and it also wasn't quite as spicy as the pumpkin bread I've made in the past.

Adding to my last review; I froze one of those loaves, and just thawed it for breakfast. Wow! It got much moister, and the flavors have blended beautifully. It was good before, but it's great now.

This is quite good. I used wheat bran instead of All Bran (I refuse to buy Kelloggs, until they quit using GMO!), and added a bit of orange zest. I also used 1/3 cup butter and 1/3 cup chunky applesauce in place of the oil, with great results. Oh yes, I took the advice of others, and soaked the bran, as well as reducing the sugar to 2 cups (and it could probably go slightly lower yet). Very easy and healthy as well. I might replace the bran with oats next time (someone else mentioned this), and this could easily take the addition of dried cranberries or raisins. A great base recipe to play with. I made 2 8x4 loaves, and it was just the right amount of batter.

even though it's the middle of summer, i really felt like some pumpkin bread... and this is very good! i did not have any all-bran, so used a mixture of crushed bran flakes and oatmeal, cut the sugar down, as we don't like things too sweet (used both brown and granulated sugar), used some leftover melted butter (from buttering the pans) as part of the veg oil, added cranberries and baked them off! very good, especially warm out of the oven! i ate half a loaf before it was barely cool enough. yum. will make again, but maybe perk it up a bit with some sour cream or a little lemon. cranberries add a nice touch, especially with less sugar in the cake. i think i like pumpkin in the summer.

I used extra spice and cut the sugar down to 2 cups (1 white, 1 brown) and made muffins instead of bread. I filled the cups too full, unfortunately, and the ones in the center cups didn't cook in the middle before the tops were done. Good flavor, next time I might up the sugar by 1/3 cup (2 1/3 c total). I had no trouble with crunchy bran noted by another cook.

I have made this bread many times, and it has become a staple at our house, and serves well as holiday baking gifts for friends and family. Everyone loves it. The bread is sweet, not savory. I found the amount of sugar just right, and have had no problem with crunchy bran mentioned by someone else.

I wasn't very impressed with this recipe. I too doubled the spices and soaked the bran in buttermilk before making, but this just didn't have a pumpkin-y enough taste for me. I much prefer the pumpkin loaves with whipped cream recipe also found on this site.

Wonderfully tasty, moist loaf and so easy to prepare. I too increased the cinnamon to 1 1/2tsp and only used 1/2cup of each brown & white sugar. I didn't have any bran so I used 1/2 cup of wheat germ and 1 1/2cups of oatmeal. (I soaked the oats in the milk) I used soy milk with 1tbsp of vinagar instead of buttermilk and 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice instead of allspice. Instead of canned pumpkin I used fresh pumpkin I froze last fall and because of the extra moistness from the fresh pumpkin, I decreased the oil to 1/3cup. I know I will prepare this recipe over and over again, next time I think I'll add a half cup of raisons...yummmmm!

This is a great alternative to the bran muffin recipe on the 100% All Bran cereal box. As advised by the other reviewers, I also soaked the bran in buttermilk and cut back the sugar to 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1/2 c. granulated sugar. I think it needed more cinnamon so I increased that by 1/4 t. I made muffins, with the oven set at 400 degrees, and baked them for 18-20 min. It yielded 2 1/2 doz. I substituted applesauce for the oil to cut back on the fat but the cupcake liners didn't peel away easily. I don't know if that's a result of that particular substitution, but I'm going to try the oil next time.

I too cut back on the sugar and made muffins instead of bread. I also took someone's advice and soaked the bran cereal in the lowfat buttermilk first, which worked well.

Great pumpkin bread! I agree with everyone else that there is way too much sugar in this recipe. Also, I found that the bran cereal was too crunchy in the bread. I would recommend adding the cereal to the buttermilk for 5 minutes to soften instead of including it in the dry ingredients.

We have been making this bread, probably, since it was first published in Bon Appetit. We make loaves and loaves, and freeze them, then eat them one by one. It's sweet, filling and healthful. We, too, cut the sugar down to 1 cup, and use 1/3 c. vegetable oil and 1/3 c. olive oil.

Great recipe, not only delicious but healthy. I did substitute half the sugar for brown sugar. I cut the recipe in half and made six large muffins. I will definitely make the bread again soon, next time making the full amount.

An excellent way to get a little extra fiber! The loaf didn't last 24 hours at our house. I did not, however, use the 3 cups sugar the recipe suggests - too much. I cut it down to a scant one cup per loaf and used brown sugar. Also added chopped prunes.

I found this recipe four weeks ago and have made it three times now. Everyone who has eaten it has asked me to make it again.
