I didn't like not peeling it all and my end result was a touch burnt and really dried out.

This was fabulous, but I did change the cooking method a bit. The first 15 minutes of roasting was done with foil draped loosely over the squash. When I checked at 15 minutes, I thought the squash was still a little hard (I cut it into larger chunks than instructed), so I poured about a cup of water into the jelly roll pan, draped the foil over, and roasted 15 minutes more. I removed the foil and -- my addition -- drizzled 1/3 stick melted butter over the squash and cooked it uncovered for 15 minutes more. The result was moist, creamy, slightly caramelized on the edges, and delicious. I served it with an earthy dish of farro and mushrooms. I used Spanish smoked paprika (dulce), a fresh bay leaf from my tree, and more cumin seeds than we're called for. I didn't find it bland at all, but if you want it more piquant I would suggest sprinkling with Japanese red pepper after cooking. highly recommended!

Like the seasonings, like the smell, but the finished dish is just not doing it for me -- has a complex and umami-rich flavor, but there's something missing. Also, while I like the idea of being able to eat squash skin, the texture of it is not a plus, at least in the particular batch I made.

Quick, easy and addictive. I used half the sugar since squash is quite sweet on its own, and toasted a few coriander seeds with the cumin. Delish! Next time I'll try a pinch of cayenne.

I found this to be too dry. I even added more olive oil during the cooking. I've never made kabocha before but I've had it in restaurants and never noticed it being drier than any other squash. The spices were good so maybe I'll try it with another squash.

I used pumpkin instead of squash and it was delicious. Great as an accompaniment to the tomatillo chicken with pumpkin seeds shown in the picture.

We like squash, and cook it often... especially butternut squash. I was intrigued with the cumin and paprika. But this recipe was too sweet. Cut down the ratio of the brown sugar to the other spices. Which, I tried a bit initially when I made this... and it was still too sweet, and killed the flavor of the squash.

This is really, really, really good. Because it is roasted this way, it is dry enough to be a finger food (or toothpick food) for a party. Guests comment that it is such a tasty and novel way to eat squash. Have done this with both Kabocha and Danish/Acorn squash and the Kabocha is better because it's drier, holds its shape better and is meatier. The hardest part is peeling and cutting the squash. My trick is using a cheese plane rather than a peeler. The kind of cheese plane I am talking about is the kind the Dutch folk use for soft cheese. Instead of looking like a spatula, it looks more like a peeler. It is a T-shape. It just has a sharper blade for cutting tough squash skin and it has saved me much hassle.

Most of the reviews for this particular dish are so bizarre and seem to have not a lot to do with the actual recipe. I don't get it. That said, I think this recipe was okay. Nothing really special, but also not bad. I'd love to find a really good recipe for this squash as I think there's a lot of potential for making a really incredible Kabocha squash dish.

I was very surprised at how tasty this squash was. The ingredients are familiar to me so I thought it wasn't going to be anything new or great but I think this combination of spices and just the right amount of salt turned just squash into something I could eat all the time.

I found this recipe to be a bit dry and not very flavorful. It was not bad but not great either.

I enjoyed making this recipe. What I don't enjoy on this section of the site is the negative behavior of posters. This ranges from the snide sniping and sneering I saw a few weeks ago between two cooks who obviously had differing tastes and resources, to the trolling, as in today's comments. I have complained twice and will continue to complain to the "contact us" section of the site, and request that comments be moderated. If the same behaviors bother you, "contact us" is there. This used to be a useful site, until the trolls showed up. It doesn't help when serious cooks forget their manners.

The Recipe is very good. The moron that likes to use "poopy talk" needs a life.

Jabba, that was really, really stupid! How can a religion be against cumin - a seasoning? It was a delicious recipe. How can a recipe be an evil meal???

This recipe sounds delicious, and I look forward to trying it, in this wonderful fall season of so many squashes to choose from! This forum is intended to appreciate and share experiences with the recipes that are offered. To share one's ignorance of the English language, and take "part" of a word, and, out of context, turn it into something else is not only stupid but evil. Check with 'Webster's' on the proper pronunciation of the spice, then, respectfully, Do Not Waste Our Time.

Jabba, you must have just gotten off the school bus and were bored. I'm sorry, that's the only reason I can think of that someone would even write something so stupid. Oh, the recipe was delicious and I wouldn't change a thing!

Looks really interesting and I love squash! About the comment about the name 'cumin', that's really pathetic. Come on its a spice!!

Made this with acorn squash and carrots and enjoyed it very much. I used 1/2 olive oil, 1/2 butter. I was concerned that the spice would be too strong, but it mellowed nicely with the roasting and was flavourful without being overwhelming. Nice compliment to the sweetness of the squash/carrot.
