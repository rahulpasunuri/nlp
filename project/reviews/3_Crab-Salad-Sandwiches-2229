Great recipe - delicious on lo-fat Ritz crackers! I also added 2 tsps Dill, a dash of aged white wine vinegar and used low-fat Hellmans mayo.

Not bad but I think the problem is the seasoning. We used fish seasoning instead of seafood seasoning because we couldn't find it anywhere. It was way too salty. I think if the seasoning was made of individual ingredients instead of some premixed brand, it would turn out better.

We made sandwiches out of this but had extra and used it the next evening as a spread on crackers. Very good. Quick and easy.

Instead of seafood seasoning, Along with the celery, I added a bit of cumin, lemon pepper, curry powder, dill, red bell for color and sweetness and red onion minced. I also added lemon zest, thinly sliced cucumbers and sprouts instead of lettuce. And I served it on croissants. I served this at an event that I catered and it was a hit. I also had substituted the crab for roasted chicken for some of the sandwiches as there were guests that were allergic to seafood. The chicken mix was a hit as well.

simple and basic ... but instead of adding lemon juice, I add a little hit of lemon zest (use a microplane so it's very fine) ... better flavor than using juice!

Tonight I used low-fat mayo, 1/2 tsp. of each Old Bay and Tony Chacheres salt free Creole seasoning, imitation (gasp!!) crab meat, and added a few squirts of bottled (gasp!!) lemon juice. Sliced 12 inches of French baguette almost in half lengthwise, and then filled the pocket with the crab salad. Then added bagged shredded cabbage coleslaw mix (in lieu of romaine) on top. This made 2 MONSTER sandwiches, and they were DELICIOUS!!! Next time, however, I would not use any of that salt free seasoning, as I felt it added a strange flavor.

Very good. I subbed 4 oz. cooked chicken breast for the crab and doubled everything else in the recipe. Super simple and we will definitely have this again!! Next time I WILL use crab!!

I've made many many recipes from this site, but this is by far the worst. I just don't see what people like about it. Way too salty and uninteresting.

Thought everyone's suggestions were great! Increased the Old Bay, the onion and it was really good!

This was a pretty no-fuss recipe. I used a french baguette and I would definitely use a softer bread next time. Nothing beats crab in my book...

Yum, but I made a couple of changes. I added dill, a pinch of salt, used fat free mayo and increased the amount of onion. It turned out wonderful and fairly low calorie.

The outcome has a subtle flavor, so be prepared to add some extra seasonings, like extra Old Bay, lemon juice, capers, OR celery seeds. Also, it has a crumbly consistency, so pita pockets, gutted tomatoes, or tortillas would cinch the sandwich aspect.

A great sandwich for two with so little work! We loved it! Sure beats fast food!

This is a pretty generic recipe and the crab can easily be swapped for canned tuna, salmon or shrimp. A pinch or two of fresh dill is also a good addition.

Loved this crab salad. I omitted the onions and added some capers, lemon juice and celery seed.

I did not care for the blend of flavors in this dish at all. My husband did not like it either and he likes just about everything.

Instead of using Old Bay, I used some Tony Chachere's seasoning, which I hoard whenever I make a trip to New Orleans. I also added a little lemon juice. This recipe takes very little time and is very tasty.

This is simplicity itself and very good. Next summer I plan to serve the salad on a lettuce leaf with fruits and good crackers. The zing of the Old Bay is better without all the bread.

I used regular mayo and Old Bay seasoning. Quadrupled the recipe to fill mini cocktail puffs-- my guests gave rave reviews!
