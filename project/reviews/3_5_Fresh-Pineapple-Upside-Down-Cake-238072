well...I did do some substitutions.... but it is the best cake I have tasted of the upsidedown variety! I used half butter and half coconut oil. The other sub which I often use is, equal parts yogurt and milk instead of buttermilk. All the other ingredients were same. The texture is amazing...not at all tough or dry! Delicious!!!!!

I didn't like this recipe. The cake was dry and flavorless. Not at all what I remembered of other Pineapple Upside-Down Cakes that I used to love. Will find a different recipe.

I made this cake for a big family birthday dinner not knowing what to expect but odds were in my favor. The cake came out perfectly and it looked picture perfect.

My Aunt Ellen and I made a similar recipe but the difference was it called for 1/4 c. of honey in addition to the brown sugar in the pan........we used canned pineapple. I highly recommend adding the orange blossom honey to this recipe.

Made an edicble dessert, but won't be my "go to" pineapple upside-down cake. It was dry and dense and not very flavorful. I was disapointed, because of the good reviews.

Wonderful recipe - make it just as is - To the reviewer who called this cake bland ... you need to shake the buttermilk well before pouring. Yeah, I used to make that mistake too.

cake is very rich. I cut the sugar (half of one of the 1/3 cup) in the batter since the bottom have brown sugar and the cake is about an inch and half high. Still very sweet. I splashed rum to the pineapple layer and the cake turned out soggy. Tasted uncooked batter. I would make this again but only 1/3 c of sugar and less pineapple (not overlap as the recipe says) so the batter will not be soggy by the pineapple.

Not much different from an c.1970 BH&G Good Housekeeping recipe. It works. Mypineapple was in small wedges and so made an attractive tile pattern in the finished product. Used 8"x8" glass dish(same capacity as 9"round) but there is too much blah white 'cake'for my taste. Next time a larger pan, and maybe some added coconut & nutmeg in the batter.

Made this as written except replaced brown sugar with maple syrup and added a couple tsps. cinnamon to batter. Done in 40 min. Light cake with moist crumb, very tasty with vanilla icecream.

DOUBLE YUM! I had a very ripe pineapple that needed to be used, and this recipe sounded like it would fit the bill. Made it for my dinner at my In-Laws tonight - and it was a huge hit. Some of the people don't drink, so for those who wished, I just poured some Jamaican Rum on the plate before putting the cake piece on, and it soaked it up prior to making it to the table. Put a scoop of Vanilla Bean ice cream on the side, and Voila! I think it's key in a cake like this to have a VERY SWEET and RIPE pineapple - since it's the star flavor you will get. I found the cake moist, and yet held firm and was able to soak in some rum still. Perfectly balanced, upgraded comfort food.

This cake was excellent, easy to make and super moist. I will be definitely making this again.

Delicious! Made this for xmas this year and it was an absolute hit. Great with coffee. The brown sugar and pineapple seep into the cake while it cooks to give it the perfect, subtle, flavor.

I followed the recipe, adding 1 tbsp of good rum to the batter. It was ok, and all was eaten, but noone in my family was overly thrilled by it. It was a bit bland for our taste.

My sweetie requested this cake for his birthday. I'd never even seen pineapple upside down cake before but this recipe had rave reviews. They were right! Everyone loved this cake. Most people had two pieces! My changes: I doubled the recipe and baked in a 12" round cast iron skillet. Cut pineapple into lengthwise 1/4" slices, arranged like a "sun" around a 12" cast iron skillet. For double recipe: Added 1/2 cup rum, 1 tsp cinnamon, used all dark brown sugar (no white) and substituted yogurt for buttermilk. Had to cook about 1 hour (maybe due to high altitude, yogurt, and/or rum). Wait for cast-iron skillet to cool or the sugar will run out and not soak into the cake.

Delicious! Works great in a 12" cast iron pan - bake for 30-35 minutes. I drizzled 1/4 cup Mt. Gay rum all over right out of the oven and before inverting. I used Pam Baking Spray, NOT the 1/2 stick of butter to grease pan with excellent results. I

Absolutely delicious! I loved the leftovers the next day, too-we warmed it up, and it was perfectly moist! I might try soaking it in a little rum next time.

This was my first upside-down cake. My sister requested it for Easter. I used a little more than half of the pineapple. (used a 10in. round bunt cake pan)I forgot to purchase buttermilk so I used 1 tablespoon lemon juice mixed with a cup of milk (let sit 5min)and measures my 2/3 cup from that. I got rave review from family members. I will now be making this a staple to our Easter dinner.

This was absolutely the best pineapple upside down cake that I've ever had. It is a very simple reciepe and very easy to make. I added extra sugar to the batter and some rum for flavor but other then that this is an excellent recipe.

I've made this cake a dozen times at least. I double the recipe though and make it into a layer cake. I frost it between layers and around the side (not the top) with cream cheese frosting, and add cherry liqour into the batter, and that's it! It weights a ton, but it's a no fail amazing impressive desert that goes a long way, but very quickly.

This was the first time I've ever made pineapple upside down cake and I think this recipe turned out really well. My father-in-law said it was the best pineapple upside down cake he has ever eaten. I made it exactly as the recipe stated. Next time I'll try some variations.

This was a nice way to use up that big pineapple we had. I liked the flavor. It was very moist, especially in the middle where it was almost mushy the next day. Still, everyone liked it.

Delicious. Easy. Fast... and with that amount of butter, you can't go wrong.

I made the cake as directed and while thinking the amount of butter for the pan was off the chart, did it any way. The cake came out perfect, cooking time in my oven was 10 min. more to golden brown. Gooey near the center but not all the way through and very tasty! Next time will use less butter in the pan though.

I've made this many times and always love it. Tonight, I switched it up and used two Bosc pears in place of the pineapple. I melted ~ 2 tbs butter in the cake pan and then sprinkled over ~ 1/3 cup brown sugar and a couple of tbs. honey. I also added the zest of one lemon to the batter to give it some extra flavor - and would have added almond extract or rum if I had it. Delicious!

I made several substitutions to lighten this up and still got a very tasty result. I used 1 T butter and 1/4 c brown sugar in the topping. In the batter, I reduced the butter to 3 T and added 1/4 c sour cream, then replaced the 2/3 c white sugar in the batter with 1/3 c brown sugar and 8 packets of Splenda. Baking took less time than stated, maybe 30 min total.

It was very simple and turned out really very good. I used brown sugar as some reviews advised and the color was just nice and gold. However I was looking for a more gooey pineaple upside down. Still haven't found the right one but so far this one is the best.

This was a wonderful and delicious recipe. After reading the reviews I decided to make the recipe exactly as directed, but with one exception... I extended the baking time by 6 minutes so it wouldn't be to moist. A mistake on my part, it was a little dry, but real tasty. I would absolutely make this again be sure to bake it exactly as directed.

I've made this a few times with good results and get a lot of compliments. It's especially nice with fresh whipped cream. I also use a spring form and had the leaking mentioned in other reviews so I make a seal with parchment paper between the pan bottom and the siding then trim the paper. One of these days I'll break down and buy a one piece 9" pan.

I made two - one with overly ripe plums and another with cherries that were beyond saving. I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg to both. It was the most incredibly delicious cake, very light and soft. Perfect for after a summer dinner or for breakfast.

Pretty good. Made it twice, once with pineapple and once with nectarines. Both times I used dark brown sugar, which turned out fine. The first time didn't use all the butter to grease the pan, which was fine. Good, but not great. Would make again though.

Excellent - reminds me of the one I had as a child. Used dark brown sugar, and less than the 1/2 stick butter called for greasing the pan. Still moist and delicious.

had the same issue as the cook from Littleton, CO.. cooked for the recommended time and a tester came out clean, but once inverted, the top was pretty gooey. flavor was okay but I wasn't keen on the texture - will keep looking for another recipe.

This cake was amazing. I followed the advice of adding 1 teaspoon of cardamom and 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg; it was a little too much cardamom. I didn't have a proper pan but knew pineapple upside-down cakes can be baked in cast iron pans. I only have a small cast iron skillet, about 6 inches across. I divided the butter, sugar, and batter in half and baked the cake twice; it only took about 25 minutes at 350. I loved this recipe.

I made this for dinner guests and I also used a spring form pan with the butter and brown sugar leaking from the pan. The taste was excellent, however the center was pretty mushy and liquidy. I might make it again using a different pan.

Made this yesterday for a group of friends who enjoy cooking and eating!! Having never had a pineapple upside down cake I was not sure what to expect and it was far better that I ever expected. I might make another one with the rest of the pineapple! Only problem I had was from using a spring form pan--very bad idea as the butter and brown sugar melted and leaked out onto the bottom of the oven. Time to invest in a better cake pan. This morning I am cleaning the oven!!!Despite the mess I think it was a great cake. I made the spiced rum sauce from this site to serve with it and also sprinkled some toasted walnuts on it .Just fabulous

I had leftover pineapple & buttermilk in my fridge & needed a quick dessert for some guests for a last minute dinner at the end of a working day. Perfect! A sweet & simple end to the meal, and only 20 min to make. I added about 1 tsp cardamom to the batter & would maybe add more next time to jazz it up a bit. Could definitely use this recipe for all kinds of fruit; a good basic.

Very good and easy to make. I made a few modifications but think that the recipe would be great as written. I marinated the pineapple in a bit of rum for about 2 hours and added about 1 tbs of cardmom powder to the cake mix. I also did not use the full 1/2 stick of butter to butter the pan and still got a great result.

Actually, adding butter, dk brown and white sugar to a saute pan w/ the pineapple, and allowing it to lose some water will help with carmalization you are looking for. Plus with left over juice you can spoon over the cake after it has been inverted onto its platter. Also adding cinnamon and/or cardamom to the juice is good, too!

The best upside-down cake ever. I'm going to make it again and use dark brown sugar instead. I think it will give it a more golden appearance for even a more dramatic presentation.
