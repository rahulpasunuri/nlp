Why do recipe writers insist on adding water to caramel? It doesn't need it!! All you need is sugar and a heavy saute pan. Stir until the sugar melts over medium heat, then just swirl it in the pan until it's the color you want. That's all there is to it, no boiling, no washing the sides of the pan, easy!!
