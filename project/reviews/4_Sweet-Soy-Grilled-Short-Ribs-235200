Used pork spare ribs, otherwise followed recipe exactly - cooked for 1.5 hours on Big Green Egg with heat diffuser. Soooooo yummmmmy! Served with broccoli slaw. Definite repeat. A winner!

Great Asian tasting ribs. Used boneless beef ribs, about 2 lbs total, so cut marinade in half. Marinated ribs overnight; browned ribs and then return to marinade and cook in crock pot on low heat about 4 hours. Removed ribs and boiled marinade in sauce pan until slightly thicken - served with ribs. Ribs had nice sweet, salty, carmelized flavor. Served with white rice and baby bok choy. Great meal with little effort! Will make the ribs again.

This is a great recipe. Very tasty and very little hands-on time. I marinated them for three days and added a splash of chili oil and 1-2 tablespoons of Asian chili-garlic sauce as suggested by another reviewer. Braised them in the marinade for about 1.5 hours, then finished them off on the grill, turning often and basting with the marinade. Strained and cooked down the marinade a bit to use as sauce. Served with polenta (with mushrooms and onions) and steamed edamame. A terrific meal.

We took the advice of DivaT1980 and browned the meat before cooking it in our dutch oven in the marinade on low over the stove for about 1.5 - 2 hrs. The results were FANTASTIC.

I never had this cut of meat before and only bought it because it was on manager's special. I was glad I did. I followed the recipe exactly, and it was delicious. I marinated the meat for two days. The marinade formed a crispy crust to the meat during grilling. I served with grilled zucchini.

This marinade is awesome using chicken, too. I add sesame oil and cayenne pepper sometimes too if I want a bit extra spice. Yummy!

Tasty. I too used the thin cut of korean style ribs and I agree with previous posts - this cut of meat takes to the marinade quickly. I liked the ribs but felt the amount of sugar was a bit much. Next time, I will only use half the amount called for.

Really good! I also used the thin cut "korean style" ribs as per the previous user. They don't need quite as much time to marinate, and because they don't take much time on the grill, there is little risk of the sauce burning. I cut back on the sugar a little (because I ran out), but even with just over half of the recommended amount of sugar and they were still very sweet and nicely carmelized. Yum!

Sticky, savory, sweet and beefy. Yum. I used cross-cut 'flanken-style?' ribs - they look like a thick piece of bacon with 4 bone cross-sections along one side. They were really good, but too fatty for my taste. Next time I'll use a leaner non-rib cut. Just thinking about these ribs makes me hungry...mmm...

This is a hard one to review. I did not have the ribs cut into 1/2" pices - I can't imagine that they would even stay together - I used individual ribs and followed that preparation. The marinade is fabulous but I don't think grilling is the best method for short ribs. They were nicely crisp on the outside and the flavor was great but the rib meat was a little too dry for our liking. The grilling prep is a lot of work with the indirect method but the ribs would never survive direct heat. I wonder what other meat would be good with this marinade?

Fabulous... the sauce is the standout here. I did not have chinese rice wine, so I used 1/4 cup of mirin and 1/4 cup of sherry... no complaints! I found that short ribs, even when trimmed of fat, still hold a lot of it (too much for my palate, even after grilling). Short ribs are best when braised/slow cooked, in my opinion. While we enjoyed this recipe, I think it would be better with pork spare ribs, but it was wonderful nonetheless.

Very tasty indeed. I used 2 pounds of boneless short ribs with half the sauce and it was plenty. Marinated for 2 hours. Grilling worked really well - the caramelized glaze is delicious and it rends much of the fat from the meat.

Excellent! I marinated and then smoked the ribs in my stove-top smoker (a worth while purchase) using cherry wood. Reduced the marinade over a low heat until thick, sticky and sweet. Added chili oil for heat and tossed the smoked individual short ribs in the reduction. When guest arrived I brought the ribs up to temp on the grill (yum!). The crowd went wild - lol. Served with the California Roll Salad (this site) and grilled bok choy - it added an unexpected International flavor to our 4th of July.

Really, really good recipe although I modified it somewhat. I browned the ribs really well and then placed them in my slow cooker for 2 hours on high with the sauce. Then I fixed with some toasted sesame seeds. Really easy!

I made these and let them marinate for 4 days, and they were the best I have ever eaten. I grilled some of them, but the leftovers I used by thinly slicing the meat and stir-frying in chow mein. The marinade makes a fantastic sauce for chow mein, and its great for chicke too!

Good recipe for sauce. I marinated some beef short ribs and then used on a Foreman grill and pan-fried. Both fair, but I think that grilling ourdoors would've been best. I will keep for the yummy sauce, though.

I prepared this recipe exactly as shown for a very large summer bbq (40 people). The prep work is simple, they cook up in only a few minutes and best of all everyone raved. This is going to become a standard in my house. If I were to play with the recipe, perhaps some lemon grass and maybe some cayenne.
