This is one of our favorite winter foods. Prefer the lamb version -- have used both leg and shoulder cuts -- and have used both potatos and some kind of grain as the base. Easy, delicious and is great reheated

I did a few adjustment - used half chicken stock and half water (might use all stock next time), and upped the spices a little bit. I was also tired and lazy so I cubed the potatoes and just threw them in and let it simmer longer, making it nice and thick. I feel there's something missing, maybe more spices or something, but overall it's a nice alternative on a snowy day to either chili or beef stew (my usual suspects)

This dish was a bit watery, but isn't that the point of rice? We thought it was super yummy, I was worried about seasoning, so I actually think I was a bit heavy-handed with the salt. Also, I roasted the potatoes in the oven instead of frying, 'cause it seemed like a waste of oil.

I make this dish often because my family loves it. I cook the split peas separately for 20 minutes and then add them to the stew and continue cooking for another 30 minutes or so. Instead of frying my own potatoes I use Pik-Nik shoestring potatoes by S&W and sprinkle on top of the stew before serving. Saves times.

I found it a very tasteful dish, and I don't understand the complaints of the former reviewers. The spice mixture was perfectly balanced and the lime juice gave it a nice tang of citrus. I made mine with beef and yellow mung beans (which are almost similar to split-peas). I also added some fresh parsley to the rice. Very tasty with the melted butter on top. I also liked the baked potato on top. Definitely a keeper for me!

I too found it watery and tasteless. When I make bean soup I find the beans don't really fal apart for 3.5-4 hours, how 45 minutes of cooking was supposed to accomplish this I do not know. I looked the reciepe up on this site in the first place wondering if someone would have left a suggestion for how to make this come out tasting good -- I like the concept, but the reality is not impressive.

I made this dish exactly as described. It was really disappointing. It had very little flavor and was watery. This cannot possibly be the way it is served in the restaurant.
