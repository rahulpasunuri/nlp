Excellent ice cream. It's very rich so second time I made, I used more whole milk and less heavy cream.

This was a big hit at Christmas dinner! Great combo of flavors - so good!

yum - a really fun dessert. Sweet, salty, smooth and crunchy. I followed the recipe exactly and I won't change anything WHEN I make it again.
