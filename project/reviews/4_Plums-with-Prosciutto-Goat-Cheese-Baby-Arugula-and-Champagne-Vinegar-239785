I liked this dish, although I think there was a little too much goat cheese. The mint was a must and I was glad I had some on hand. I felt that there was a bit too much dressing for the arugula. Don't get me wrong - I did like it, but I think my guests enjoyed it more than I did.

We didn't have goat cheese, so left that out, and only had cubed pancetta which we crisped up and used like bacon bits, instead of prosciutto. Only red wine vinegar instead of champagne vinegar. And honey dijon mustard, so we left out the additional honey. This *still* turned out absolutely amazing! The honey mustard and the plums are a wonderful combo. Some credit goes to our good luck in obtaining fantastic farmer's market super sweet emerald plums (a green skinned and fleshed variety). But I think the marriage of flavors is inspired. Try this.

Very easy to throw together. I used a mixture of different colored plums. Nice blend of salty and sweet with the creamy goat's cheese and nutty arugula. A real keeper!

Amazing!! I did it just as written, except I did not put pepper on the goat cheese. My husband felt is was a bit too much goat cheese, but liked it overall. My guests also said it was amazing. It was so easy and with fresh ingredients it came together perfectly. The mint was a must, it would not have been nearly as good without it.

I made this as a main dish salad and increased the size of the goat cheese rounds and included two with each salad. I also heated them in a small skillet a couple of minutes on both sides, and I would do that again. I placed the goat cheese rounds and the sliced plums on top of the arugula mixture. Very yummy.

This is a fabulous salad! I made it *exactly* as described. I've dined at Stella! and loved the food so I decided to follow this recipe to the T. I brought it to a brunch party and it was devoured. I plan to make it again this week so I can enjoy it as a main course.
