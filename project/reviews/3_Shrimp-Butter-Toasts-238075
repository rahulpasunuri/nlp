I, too, thought the receipie was a little bland. The second time I made it I used a generous amount of "Old Bay" and it was much improved. Very easy to make!

I found this recipe to sound better than it tasted. wasn't terrible, but was bland.I don't think spicing it up a bit would make a huge difference, either. Just couldn't taste the shrimp - only the butter. Why even spend the money on the shrimp?

I used toasted Italian Bread w/ sesame seeds lightly brushed with a delicate garlic butter instead of the toast points ( I didn't have "normal" bread). I found it to be quite delicious. A few of my guests (not from the "Polite South") didn't care for the texture. I would highly recommend this recipe!!

Everyone loved this recipe - from the teens to the grandparents. Great shrimp flavor; great match with French white burgundy.

I made this because I had leftover shrimp to use up. It is good but doesn't have a huge amount of flavor. I would not serve this to company.

This turned out great and was a break from your typical apps. I used about 1/3 the amount of butter and added one egg white, 3 T. sesame seeds and 1/4 cup water chestnuts to the shrimp mixture. I also toasted the points with buttered sesame seeds.
