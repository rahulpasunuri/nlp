This was my go to dessert this holiday season. It is so simple and incredibly delicious. I have also made it with apples when pears are out of season. I bet it would be good with peaches in the summer as well! I can't recommend this recipe more highly..

I won't rate the recipe because I made several changes, but I do want to highly recommend the glaze! Everyone loved it, and I'll most likely use it again on other desserts as well. One of the changes I made was verysuccessful. I used vanilla sugar (bury a vanilla bean in a canister of sugar for several weeks), and just that little hint of vanilla gave the whole dessert much more depth. It's worth investing in a vanilla bean now and then.

I made this recipe all during x-mast.I took filo pastry when I could not find good puff pastry it makes a lighter desert. I also used strawberry vinegar I guess it could also be substituted with redwine vinegar and a bit of jam. Every body loved it. It was a success every time. Diane
