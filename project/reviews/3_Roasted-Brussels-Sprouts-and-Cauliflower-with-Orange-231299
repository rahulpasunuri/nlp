Healthy, easy, interesting flovors. . Served first time with health conscious guests; we all liked it.

Nothing to write home about, make again or even share with your friends. I thought that the orange flavor was going to brighten the dish and make it a unique style of brussel sprouts; instead, it was sweet. I also expected the vegetables to a little crispy and 'roasted', but they weren't. It wasn't a "bad" recipe, just not something I will make again. I find they come tastier and more crisp on the stovetop and a little butter!

I used just cauliflower. It was o.k. but not something I will make again. It needs some better flavoring.

A very forgiving recipe, and delicious. I had neither cauliflower, shallots nor parsley, but it still came out great. I used 2 pounds of brussels sprouts and had one very large juicy orange; I used all the juice from that orange, which was probably close to 1 cup, but the sprouts absorbed all the juice, and I'm sure they were better for it. I baked them maybe 15 minutes longer, as they were pretty big even when quartered.

Don't skimp on the zest and orange juice because that's what'll make it. I threw some fresh thyme on top at the end and was happy with the result, too. Brussels sprouts aren't everyone's cup of tea, but they make an interesting and healthy side dish for a holiday meal. And if you have the opportunity to buy them on the stem, I recommend it. I used that sucker as a centerpiece right up until I cut the sprouts off to roast. It was a great conversation piece! :)

Easy and tasty. I didn't have oranges so substituted clementines. Flavoring is subtle. I had to roast longer than suggested, even with baby brussel sprouts. They need to ccok long enough to lose some of their bitterness.

We had this for Christmas and eveyone loved it. A healthy easy side dish. IMHO the OJ made it.

Still looking for a way to make Brussel Sprouts taste great-personally I would give it one fork but it is likely just the flavor of sprouts dragging it down. I'll look for another veggie side to go with the duck next time around! Christmas 2006

Not a very strong orange flavour. Decent use of both ingredients, but there are probably better recipes out there. Better the next day, the orange flavour intensifies some.

Very good. Used shallots. Used less OJ because was uncertain of taste. Next time I'll use more.

Really nice change for brussel sprouts and cauliflower. Loved the subtle orange essence. Made this twice now with rave reviews from all at the dinner party.

just did not have the taste to warrent makeing it again. We ate it but kids thumbed down it and that is rare for the finest food web site: Epicurious.com

Simple to make, but I don't think it went well with the orange.
