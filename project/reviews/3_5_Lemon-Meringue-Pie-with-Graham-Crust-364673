Update of prior review: I've made it twice, both times the crust baked perfectly and the filling and meringue were just as described. I grew up on fabulous lemon pies and this one meets the standard. Only thing I will do differently next time is sift the graham flour. My flour source for the last pie was a little gritty.

Haven't eaten it yet, but the crust worked perfectly (maybe oven temp was off?) as did all of the other elements. I would change the number of egg whites for the meringue from 6 to 4.

The pie was very good but the butter in the crust could be cut to just 1/2 stick and I would add 2 tablespoons of sugar to the egg whites in the last minute of beating as they were not very shiney. Loved the berries.

Too much butter. Ten minutes in the oven, and the crust has sagged and melted into the middle of the pie pan. I pulled it out, added graham flour, reformed, used pie weights and hopefully it will work. (The pie is cooling as I type). I'm not convinced there is anything special about this recipe. There is no obvious attempt to recreate this classic pie. The flavor is good, but not modern enough for me.

I made the recipe as written except that I strained the filling mixture after cooking and then added the lemon zest. Fantastic, bright and tart lemon flavor in the filling. The crust is a little thick, so it's almost like a lemon bar with a meringue topping. If you want it to be more delicate maybe use 2T less of the crust mixture?
