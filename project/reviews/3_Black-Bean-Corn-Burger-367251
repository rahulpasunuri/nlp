After reading the reviews I made the following changes: Used 2 whole eggs and 1 egg white, added about 1/3 cup of flour and I mashed the black beans with a fork. I also skipped the spinach and made the burger with lettuce, tomato and topped with salsa. Will make next time but will mash more of the beans so they come together even better.

As written, this recipe is a disaster. I foolishly attempted to make these "burgers" without reading the reviews first. Basically, they were just big piles of black bean, corn, peppers, etc. Thought it might work if you bake them in a ramekin instead? I think I'll just move on to a better recipe though instead of trying that. Oh, and that pinch of nutmeg added to the spinach totally clashed with the rest of the ingredients. I'd recommend a little coriander and/or chili powder.

Reading the reviews I worked the mixture with the edge of a wooden spatula for a while. I had not problem keeping the patties together. After cooking them on one side for 5 minutes they held together just fine, with a nice brown crust. The flavors of the spinach, patties and avocado topping worked very well together - none overwhelmed the others.

Fantastic! Even the boyfriend who resists non-meat foods loved it. The extra patties kept in a ziplock for quick left overs later in the week. Changes made: used three whole eggs instead of just whites. Used Italian breadcrumbs I had on hand. Didn't do the spinach topping but rather some Greek yogurt and salsa...Absolutely a make again meal.

Great recipe - added extra panko in order to prevent crumbling. Also, baked them in the oven in a Pyrex dish so that I didn't have to flip them. The flavor was good. I'll probably omit the sour cream sauce, and just eat them with ketchup next time.

Fine, I suppose. They did not stick together; I tried adding a bit more panko, but that only made the mix seem messier. Tasted good, but I have definetely had better.

These were extremely easy to put together and had a really vibrant flavor. Since others seemed to have trouble keeping the patties from crumbling, I added about 2 tablespoons of flour to the recipe, which helped glue the ingredients together into burgers very nicely.

This recipe had good flavor but it does not make a burger. I ended up scooping the mixture into a small cup and putting it in the pan like a pancake. Served it like that too with the spinach as a side.

If you make these as written they will definitely not stick together. It helps to mash up the beans and corn before mixing. We also added a bit of flour and more breadcrumbs until we got a consistency that was a little more burger-like. Overall great recipe for an easy weeknight meal.

Like others have said, really great tasting burger...if you can shape it into a burger. I used one of those single egg pans to make each patty and they honestly stuck together (mostly) very well. I recommend this for any veggie burger sticking issue you may have.

This is the best black bean burger I've ever had. I used fresh corn cut off the cob and roasted a couple of jalapenos over a flame because I didnt have the chipotle in adobo and I used roasted red peppers in a jar along with some red onion. Just fantastic.

Tasty, but did not hold together. A better title would be "Crispy Black Beans and Corn". The egg whites DID help make the bread crumbs stick a little to the beans.
