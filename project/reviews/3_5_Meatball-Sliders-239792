I thought these meatballs and particularly the sauce were delicious, but they do not taste like the ones they actually serve at the Little Owl. They are close, but just not as good. For the gravy, I do not wipe out the pan after frying the meatballs - there's a lot of good flavor in what's left behind.

Our family loves this recipe! we make it every Super bowl sunday....it is my daughter's favorite. I don't change a thing! Love the mini meatball subs....a regular one is too much!

Great meatball recipe. Everyone I served these to loved them.

I only used pork, simply because I did not have any beef or veal on hand. I doubled the amount of spices in the sauce, and it turned out great.

I agree with the other reviews, the meatballs were a bit boring. Much better recipes for meatballs on this site. The sauce was good though.

This recipe has been a great success time after time. The sauce is great with many other dishes that call for a marinara. I always make two renditions of the meatballs. The first one I leave as the recipe follows. I enjoy being able to taste the meat. The other, I add some pepper flake and a splash or worcestershire to the meat mix. That usually brightens up the balls a bit (great for those who think the balls a bland).

Made this last night. Does not find meatball bland at all, making it the day before and let them chill and sit in the sauce might have help. Very tasty meal, will definitely make again.

I thought the meatballs were a little bland. Next time I will either use some italian sausage or add onions and crushed red peppers. The sauce was wonderful, very fresh and easy.

Made it for a bunch of "big guys"who just loved it. It was a perfect appetizer for the group and had great flavor. It was all the same - yet differently presented and that's what made it special

ONly made the meatballs to use in a soup. They are good and I imagine would be great in a good sauce. I threw them in a minestrone-type soup. Frying them was not nearly as messy as expected, they didn't splatter.

Asian food stores (like 99 Ranch Market in California) sell smaller buns. Look for bread like Pan de Sal.

I have tried every gourmet grocer in town.... Where do you find tiny burger buns?? I'm dying to make these.

The sauce was a very good light tomato sauce. The fennel gave it a nice flavor. The meatballs, however, were quite bland and a little too dense. Definately not a keeper.

This has become my "new" favorite meatball!! Easy, Flavor, Lots of ways to serve them. I have even baked them to get a "healthy" no oil result. Well worth sharing. This one is a definite keeper for years to come.

These meatballs are fantastic. I am going to make these simply with a nice pasta or as a dinner on their own. The flavours in the sauce and of the different meats are so good. This one is a definite keeper.

I too cannot believe that anyone found this recipe to be bland. Had this for a tailgate as well and they were a huge hit. The fennel makes the sauce, and it is imperative to use good, high quality pecorino, each of the three meats, and the panko breadcrumbs in order to get optimal results. Do that, and this will impress every time.

These were GREAT!

4 stars for the sauce. I've made this twice and the second time punched up the flavoring of the meatballs themselves. Let the size of the bun dictate the size of the meatball. I doubled the meatball recipe and did not double the sauce. There was plenty! Enjoy!

Can't belive that some people thought that those meatballs and sauce were "bland" in any way. I have eaten a lot of different meatballs in my life and these were certainly one of the best. I have to believe that our day to day consume of overspiced, over taste- enhanced meals have demolished the delicate tastebuds of many which makes experiencing a perfectly arranged dish like this seem "bland". I recommend this dish to everybody who wants to take the time to make it and has a sense for original taste.

These are fabulous. I used a different hard cheese and used spring greens vs. arugula. I also toasted the rolls with olive oil before assembling.

Very excited about this recipe. I made this once and will be them making again for sure. I love these meatballs and the trio of veal, pork, and beef is classic. Browning them is key, as most places won't take the time to do this.

This was a great recipe - I didn't have any ground veal so ended up using 2 parts beef to 1 part pork. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great. I would definitely make this again.

Thought these were awesome. A kid-friendly dish. Found small, soft dinner rolls and used shredded mozzarella on top. In terms of the blandness, I did add more garlic than was called forthis always helps when in doubt :)

This was very bland. It took a lot of time but nobody finished their meal. There are certainly better recipes than this.

Just ok. I am having trouble believing that this very average recipe made the cover. The meatballs were bland, not much flavor. Sauce was good. Not much better the next day. I will say it is a great alternative to spaghetti and meatballs. I will make this version again but with a my meatball recipe. Kids thought is was only ok and not a keeper.

This was a wonderful, simple recipe. It did take a lot of time, but the results were well worth it. I did not have ground veal on hand, so I substituted ground chuck. I also left out the fennel. My family loved it!! I will definitely add this to the rotation.

I made these for a football tailgate this weekend and they were a big hit. Small rolls were impossible to find, so I cut hot dog buns in thirds, and made 24 ample size meatballs. A keeper...now we just need to win the super bowl again!

Not a tricky recipe, but it is a lot of work (especially trying to locate all ingredients). My husband, myself and his family LOVED this recipe. No need to add anything - perfectly seasoned if you do it exactly as listed. Easily impress your guests. I doubled the recipe and got 28 meatballs.
