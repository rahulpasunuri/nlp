I'm just copying this recipe for a friend. I've been using it since my husband saw it in your magazine back in 1996! I use it for most Easter dinners with ham and many times when I'm having a special dinner.

I'm a huge Stilton lover and I really wanted to like this recipe. I've made it twice and I just don't enjoy it. It's very bland for the amount of Stilton you have to use. The top became dried out for me as well. I will try this recipe one more time with a less expensive blue, and save the Stilton for eating straight!

This recipe was okay. My guests really liked it, but I thought it was okay. The top became dried out. I added more broth, but never had enough to baste the top.

I just made this recipe for family at Thanksgiving. It had come recommended from another friend. I received rave reviews from several family members and they asked for the receipe!That is a true compliment to the chef in my opinion!

I have made this recipe, with no changes, on numerous occasions and always receive rave reviews. It is a great dish for the family (especially the crispy bits) and is also perfect for company.

Well, I reduced the cheese as mentioned below, but used too little! It didn't have enough flavor...I'd make it again, but would follow the recipe exactly.

Wow! This was sinfully good. I halved the recipe with no problems. Much as I love Stilton cheese, I might consider reducing the quantity slightly next time, as this was rich, rich, rich. Definitely recommend this for blue cheese lovers! And it's so much simpler than most gratin recipes.

This was just great! My husband doesn't care for bleu cheese, but loved these potatoes. Easy enough for family, fancy enough for company.

Loved this recipe!!! I found that cooking in the microwave (about 30 minutes) and browning in the oven (about 10 minutes) cut down the cooking time tremendously. It was perfect!!

This is an easy and incredibly flavorful potato dish -- the potatoes have an intense Stilton flavor and a tender texture. I made it for Easter dinner and my family loved it.

I made this in a much smaller quantity because we have only two for meals. I used just one large potato and adjusted the cheese and the chicken broth accordingly. It was wonderful and did not take more than 1 hour to bake. I served it with lamb chops and with beef tenderloin...excellent with both meats.

Absolutely wonderful. The stilton permiated the dish. I served this with beef, and the combination was perfect.

Wonderful flavor in this hearty gratin,perfect with beef tenderloin and though it bakes for quite a while, preperation time is minimal and quite easy!

The stilton cheese adds a nice bite to this potato dish. The recipe calls for a 1 hour, 40 minute cooking time, which seems long...but it does take every minute of it. I served this dish with filet minon.
