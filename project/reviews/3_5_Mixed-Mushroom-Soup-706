This turned out to be the BEST Mushroom Soup I have ever made! And it took me THIS LONG to finally make it? I even screwed up with the recipe by not following directions carefully, and it STILL turned out Amazing! I did use a wild mushroom mix and added rehydrated French Bolot Mushrooms with their soaking liquid, about 2 cups, to replace some of the beef broth. But other than that. Spot on Perfect! Served with crusty rolls and steamed artichokes for a superlight AND hearty meal! My entire family loved it, including my 8 year old son!

I am not a Shiitake mushroom fan, but I will usually give most any vegetable another chance to change my mind. I liked this! It was good, not too creamy, and the flavors and textures of the different mushrooms worked out really well. I will surely make this again.

I loved it. Used white wine and two different kinds of trader joes mushrooms. Easy and delicious. I used low fat milk instead of cream and it was very flavorful. I also used a hand mixer to blend the mushrooms.

As written, the recipe is really just a jumping off place- good enough, but this soup is a wowser if you get creative with it. I have made it many times and used combinations of wild dried mushrooms (do not use cloud ear, wood ear or oyster- too strongly flavoured/and/or chewy- this soup wants to be subtle), baby portobello, white or button mushrooms for the fresh. For the broth part, I have used combinations of part beef and chicken, all vegetable and the precious liquid from the soaked mushrooms (don't forget to strain it!), and it has been delicious- so I don't think it need be all beef. This can be a totally vegetarian soup. If you don't want the dairy, I tried pureeing about 1/4 of the soup and adding it back. This gave it a creamy texture along with the rough of the mushrooms. At times I have omitted the brandy, used sherry or not, and whatever I do, this soup has come out a winner and gets extremely high marks from everyone. My neighbors beg me to make it!

I've made this soup for many years now as it is a family favorite for the holidays. I end up using whatever wine I have on hand and I "simmer" the soup in the crockpot. Don't be afraid of using fresh button mushrooms only. I cannot give this soup enough stars and it ALWAYS makes me look good.

This is a family favorite. Easy to make, use whatever kind of mushrooms you have on hand. I use fat free half and half and an emersion blender .

Wow - An excuse to open a bottle of bubbly. Didn't have brandy so used some leftover champagne from New Year's celebration. This makes an awesome soup (also subbed fresh shitake for the dried). Today I just reduced the 2 cups leftover soup to 1 1/2 cup and melted in 1/3 cup freshly grated parmesan, and it made WONDERFUL pasta sauce!

I was hesitant to make this for dinner on a hot summer evening. Then again, why not, I've been wanting to try it and don't intend to wait till Christmas Eve. I used a shallot and a medium yellow onion, 12 oz. of thick-sliced white mushrooms and the 1 oz. of reconstituted shiitakes. Per other reviews, I used white wine in place of the brandy, 2 14.5 oz. cans of low-sodium beef broth (made up the remainder of beef broth with bouillon) and 1 cup of reserved soaking liquid from the shiitakes. At the end, I added a little parsley for color. Served with croutons and shredded Swiss for those who wanted it, and that was dinner (along with a fruit salad). I thought it was delicious, as did my husband and mother-in-law. This is going in my "keepers" file. I may thicken it just a tad more for the cooler months; this will be served either on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day, for sure! I couldn't give it four forks only because (although it is a really excellent soup) I wouldn't necessarily say that it was a dish beyond compare.

Wow! I will definitely make this soup again. I used a cast iron Dutch oven. I doubled the brandy and went wild with a variety of mushrooms from the coop. I took the advice from others: I used the soaking liquid from the mushrooms to create the fifth cup of broth. Because of unexpected events and a much later dinner hour than planned, this soup sat covered for a few hours barely steeping on the stove. Not only did it hold up, I think it tasted better. What a trooper of a soup! Wonderful, Wonderful!

I made this with fresh crimini's and dried mixed wild mushrooms. Also cut down on the onion a bit and added a large shallot. Very nice!

My boyfriend and I liked this soup quite a bit, but it wasn't as creamy as I hoped. I also used portobello mushrooms instead of the shiitake because I am a student on a budget! I used the soup the next night over linquine noodles, and that was really good, a bit more substance than just the soup alone. Great flavor though!

Wow! I thought this soup was fantastic. I made it for a dinner party and got rave reviews (even from people who don't like mushrooms!) It had a great flavor and I would definitely make it again with no changes!!

I hardly dare to rate this recipe as I made so many changes (used fresh shiitake, vegetable broth, shallot instead of garlic and white wine instead of brandy) but I must say even the altered version was great and very easy to make.

A fine soup, especially here in Northern California on a cold summer evening. BE AWARE this soup does not need any salt. I did make it without the cream as my husband is on a severely-fat-restricted diet. Even so, it was tasty. I did reduce it to make it a bit thicker. We had sprouted wheat bread and a bit of chicken liver pate on the side. Ah, a glass of wine = a lovely dinner.

This is a wonderful recipe for cold winter days - simple to make and a complex taste result! As a steady cook, I always read the reviews so as not to be carried away with mistaken changes to otherwise perfect recipes. I would suggest that Kimberly from Indianapolis do the same - wood ear mushrooms indeed!

This soup is easy and truly delicious. I think you could make a wonderful mushroom sauce for pasta using this as a base. I was concerned that it wouldn't be rich enough, but it definitely was. I plan to make it many times!

Delicious and easy. Added extra brandy and a touch more nutmeg. I used four cups of beef stock and one cup mushroom soaking liquid. (used porcini instead of shitaki) We like a thicker soup, so I thickened with a little more flour during second step. I like to reduce my soup for a richer flavor. This was great!

Delicious soup. Very rich and filling. I didn't have any brandy so I used sherry. It gave it an off taste. Next time I will definately use brandy. My husband is requesting that I make this for Thanksgiving...being the transplanted Americans we are.

This recipe is excellent...i made it exactly as the recipe states and melted swiss cheese on top. I served it with bread covered with cheese also and it was a big hit! Will definately make it again.

I was stunned when I tasted this soup. Wow! The best cream of mushroom soup I've ever had. No tweaking needed! I did stray from the recipe in one way, however. Because my mom taught me always to save the precious, flavorful liquid (minus the sediment) left over from soaking dried shiitake mushrooms, and because some reviewers complained about the beef broth salt content, I used 4 cups canned beef broth and 1 cup of the flavorful shiitake liquid to reduce salt content and increase flavor. I'm sure that helped the soup flavor. BTW, I don't have a heavy Dutch oven, so I had to use a regular pot. Ouch, now the burned pot is soaking in the sink.

This soup is exquisite! I used a mixture of button, cremini and fresh shiitake mushrooms. I sauteed the shiitakes and used the caps from the button and cremini mushrooms as the garnish. We didn't have any brandy so I used wine. Freshly grated nutmeg really compliments this soup!

Easy recipe and past the "husband" test. Might suggest using low-sodium beef broth, and whatever you do....don't use wood ear mushrooms...YUK!

this was an incredible soup. I made it for company a couple of weeks ago. My husband raves about this soup, and my husband does not rave about anything. One change I made was halved the amount of button mushrooms and used cremini for other half. I also roughly pureed the soup

This soup was great! I followed the recipe exactly, except I used fresh Shiitake mushrooms since they were available at the store. Next time I might try a larger variety of mushrooms; and perhaps croutons or toasted french baguette topped with melted Gruyère cheese.

With a soup and salad dinner party for 14, this soup was the first one to go. The recipe was easy, once I found the mushrooms in a local health food store. The flavor was delicate and delicious with all the hearty mushrooms. I think the brandy gives it that special touch of flavor. My guests and I were all equally delighted in this soup. Definitely a "keeper" for our long winter!!!!

Very good, even though my grocery store was out of Shiitake mushrooms (used some kind of variety pack). My husband though it would taste even better with cracked barley and wild rice in it, something simulair to what we've had in a restaurant.

WOW! What a wonderful flavor this soup has!!! My husband and I agree that this tastes like a soup would be served to you in your favorite restaurant (fine dining). Can't wait to make this again for friends.

This dish deserves all the excellent ratings it has received. I added a little grated parmesan cheese at serving. Fabulous.

One of the best soups I have made. It was even better the next day, for lunch. Will definately be making this again.

Definitely a keeper - and I'm not a big mushroom fan. I added a small pureed potato to thicken and tone down the saltiness of the canned broth. I used half and half rather than heavy cream. Before serving, I reserved some mushrooms for the top but ran the rest quickly through the food processor to just chop it a bit. Delicious!

served this soup for the first course at our Christmas dinner and we received rave reviews.

Made this soup on Thursday, making it again for a dinner party on Monday. This soup is wonderfu! The flavors meld together in a rich, yet simple soup. I used crimini mushrooms instead of button and added more of the brandy. The soup, what lasted, was even better the next day. I kept thinking it would be good with fresh garlic croutons on top...I guess I'll try that Monday!

Great main course soup. I added some oyster mushrooms and it worked well.

A completely delicious and very simple soup that is great as a first or second course. However, I didn't use all the button mushrooms the recipe called for, and it was still delicious!

My guests are requesting this delicious soup again. It has even more of a mushroom flavor if you puree it for a few seconds in batches then bring to temp.

This mushroom soup has fantastic flavor. Cutting the cream to one-third cup still produces a very satisfying result.

Every year we have a soup buffet party, serving 6-7 soups. This will be the first time we will repeat a soup--this one--because so many guests are requesting it. It is wonderful!
