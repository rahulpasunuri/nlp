This was really delicious and flavorful plus it's healthy, all ingredients are fresh--no canned or processed stuff. I used dried coconut and wrapped in parchment and cooked in over at 400 degrees. Used sole but would probably be better with a more firm fish. Delicious!

Yum! I didn't put the mint as advised by Sarah and used coconut milk from a can ('cos I didn't have a fresh coconut). Put Xeres vinegar instead of white vinegar. It was really good !

This was a great hit. I used mango instead of coconut, and fish sauce instead of salt as well, wasn't quite sure of the chile amount but it worked out well. A little heavy on the garlic. Most people ate it right up ;)

I changed the recipe by substituting fresh lime juice for vinegar and 1/4 cup fish sauce for the salt. I also doubled the coconut and reduced the cilantro to a cup but added the roots of the plants. I baked it in a 450 degree oven for 15 minutes and it was perfect. Everything else was as written and it got rave reviews from my dinner party. I also used 2 tablespoons of the chutney and mixed it with fresh mango and pineapple as a side relish. Served the leftover chutney on the side and they were eating it by the spoonful. The chutney was green and white rather than a dark green and let the taste of the fish shine through. Great idea and worked well

Sounded great, but was disappointing. Afterwards I even double checked to make sure I didn't leave something out or omit a step.

I loved this dish. I couldn't find banana leaves, so I used the outer husks from ears of corn - it worked fine. And I added some mango to the chutney - it was outstanding. I added quite a bit, but you can add to taste....

This preparation is a direct translation of a centuries-old recipe found in Parsi (Zorastrian)cuisine on India's West Coast, called Patra-ni-macchi (fish in leaves). A more modern twist found in India today, is to use a similar chutney, but use it to 'stuff' the fish and either bake it or even better, shallow-fry it.

try wrapping the fish & banana leaf parcels in aluminium foil prior to grilling as it will stop the leaves from burning and allow them to be used as an effective garnish

The chutney was interesting, although the coconut made it a bit dry. My main problem was that the banana leaves caught fire on the grill and smoked a lot! I think I would redo the recipe, but would steam the fish instead of grilling it.

I am lucky enough to have real banana trees growing in my backyard, so I used some of those leaves instead of the frozen ones (where does one get those, anyways?) and it made for a really beautiful presentation. I thought the chutney was delicious, but maybe next time I'll use only cilantro and no mint, making it more of a traditional Thai dish. I used tilapia, which worked well. For those with a more experienced palette -- a great dish.

Oh, yuck! The recipe sounded intriguing, so I tried it. Big mistake! The cilantro chutney was too, too weird (the combination of cilantro, coconut,ginger & garlic overpowered everything else!) & my guests all gave it a rousing thumbs down as well. We couldn't find banana leaves anywhere,so had to use parchment. Save your energy for something else.
