I made this cake for a couple of birthdays and everyone found it delicious. It's one of my favorite cakes so far. I did make some changes to the recipe: * Used only 2/3 of the sugar. * Added some coconut rum to the filling as someone suggested. * I don't have 9 by 2-inch pans, so I used 2 12-inch pans and made only 2 layers. * For the frosting, I couldn't find cream of tartar, so I used a few lemon drops and a pinch of baking powder instead. * I couldn't find light corn syrup, so I didn't use it. * Also, I beat the frosting in the simmering water for over 20 minutes.

My profile image is of this cake which I made for my wedding. It turned out amazingly. So javascript:void(0);worth all the effort!

I have made this cake several times, but decided this would be a perfect cake for my wedding. With much recalculating I eventually made 4 batches which were divided into 3x12", 3x9" & 3x 6" layers. I was very happy with the final result. Definitely a winner!

I adapted the recipe and made cupcakes! Added 1/4 C Coconut Rum to the syrup to drive home the coconut flavor...worked out perfectly! Got about 3 1/2 dozen cupcakes out of the recipe.

The recipe worked like a charm. I made a 4-layer cake instead of 3 and it turned out to be perfect amount of filling. Super moist and absolutely delicious.

This is an excellent recipe, and easy to follow. I even had to compromise with having only 2, 9-in. pans, and reserved the third layer until the first two were done - worked perfectly! I would also recommend the following for those pineapple coconut + rum lovers: For a more tropical flair, you can add a bit of pineapple and rum to the cake. Puree 1 cup fresh pineapple (or 8 oz. unsweetened canned chunks, drained). Add 1/8 c.+ white rum and 2 tsp. flour and puree together with pineapple until fluffy. Add pineapple mixture to cake batter just before egg white mixture is added. For more pineapple flair, try adding pineapple to the coconut frosting as well. After frosting is complete, puree 1/2 cup fresh pineapple (or 4 oz. unsweetened canned chunks, drained). Drain any excess juice and then add mixture to the portion of the frosting intended for the layers. Mix gently, but thoroughly and add coconut. Spread frosting on layers - whole cake should be frosted with the plain frosting and sprinkled with coconut.

Ok so I've had this recipe stored in my recipe box for months. Iv read all the reviews and yesterday I finally took the plunge and started the cake. AS previously mentioned this cake was a lot of work. In all it took a good five hours or so to complete it. Peeling and grating the coconut had to have been the worst part however it did allow for good conversation with brave family members who helped with that task. The cake itself turned out a little thin howver is was dense and absolutly delicious. I substituted the whole milk with cocunut milk and it was wonderful. The icing didnt turn out as well,it was thin and drippy. After about twetny minutes of whipping It thickened up however I let it sit and when I went to ice the cake it became thin. And yes my cakes were cool. I also toasted the cocunut that went onto the cake itself. Overall I rated this cake three forks. I was absolutley delicious however there definitly was no esthetic appeal to the cake. I might try to make it again in another couple months when I forget about the trouble I had with it lol.

The cake itself was delicious and moist, although it took considerably less time to bake in convection oven. My only problem was the icing. It was so stiff after beating that I thought I would have trouble spreading it, but ended up too loose after the addition of fresh coconut for the interior layers. The icing tasted absolutely yummy, was smooth, not grainy, and glossy, but after about 30 minutes started oozing out from between the layers to the sides, leaving no icing in between and making the cake look like a homemade grade school volcano project, albeit white. SOoo disappointing...Any suggestions? I would like to make it again, with icing improvements, but would use a smaller grater for the coconut as I found it too coarse.

Made this cake for Easter 2010. It was really wonderful. The frosting, in particular, was yummy. I did not do the coconut part...just used a bag of sweetened, shredded coconut. Tasted just fine.

I absolutely loved this cake! I didn't really think it was that much work at all... I found it fun to make! The cake itself was probably one of the best from-scratch vanilla cakes I've ever made. The fresh coconut was such a delicious idea... I really loved it! The frosting required a lot of elbow grease but came out so beautifully glossy and was incredibly easy to work with. The only thing I might change if I made it again is the filling. I've made a similar cake before where the filling was more like the inside of a Bounty bar... I think that would just send this cake over the top!

This cake is excellent. I made it exactly according to the recipe. It was a tremendous amount of work, but I'm ok with that if it's for a special occasion. I made it for Easter last year for my in-laws. It served about a dozen people, so I felt it was worth the effort. If you love to impress people with your baking skills, this is the cake to make. Contrary to other reviews, my cake was light, fluffy, and moist. The frosting recipe made too much and I had leftovers that I had to throw away. That's my only complaint, and it can be easily fixed. Next time, I'll halve the frosting.

I made this cake for mom's birthday. It was fabulous! I also, with the recommendation, made a lemon curd to stick between the cake layers, on top also. I toasted the coconut that went on top and around the cake. I regretfully coouldn't find any fresh coconuts and instead used boughten unsweetened coconut shreds, milk and juice. Still, it was a hit. Wondering how much better fresh would be? Very curious. A wonderful recipe. Thank you, Gourmet!

A rare disappointing cake from Gourmet. First, don't bother with the whole coconuts. A lot of bother for something you can get off the store shelves. I would use prepared unsweetened coconut and coconut milk or liquor rather than wrestling with the fresh. The cake was dry and the frosting was grainy. No one in my family liked it and I ended up throwing away 1/2 a cake. Don't know what went wrong since other bakers loved it, but I wouldn't bother again. A lot of work for a poor quality product.

First of all, it should be noted that when the recipe calls for "fresh coconut" it means the hard brown ones that are called "dry" here - not the green ones. I'm not really posting direct comments on this recipe because I didn't follow it faithfully enough - however, it's a lot of work for not a lot of payoff. I used the basic genoise recipe, but replaced some of the milk with canned coconut milk to good effect - the cake itself was very dense.

very rich...also I don't know if my oven messed it up or its supposed to be like this, but my layers came out about an 1" thick. its a good thing there was 3 layers or there would have been nothing to it.

Besides all the effort it takes to make this cake - it is fantastic. I did however battle with the frosting...but followed the instructions with beating longer (due to living in a coastal area) it turned out correctly.

Fantastic cake. I took a couple of shortcuts, not using fresh coconuts but using canned coconut water and milk instead. I also added home made lemon curd between the layers and vanilla bean past to the frosting. Beautiful. Will definitely make this one again.

Lovely in appearance, I found the cake a tad too sweet. The coconut meat we husked was too woody to use, but we were able to substitute unprocessed shredded coconut, which is preferable to the sweetened variety if you can get it. Keep an eye on the layers in the oven and remove the instant they are done to avoid dryness. If you overshoot, only if you over-shoot should you brush on the sweetened coconut milk, because the frosting and coconut-packed filling are quite sufficient. I toasted the coconut that is sprinkled on the top and sides, which looks and tastes great. I served with a raspberry sauce which pleasantly offset the sweet cake. Slice thin! Very rich. Or, consider making the 2-layer fresh coconut recipe also on this site.

This cake was one of the best I've made. The appearance is stunning. It is very labor intensive but well worth it. The frosting was perfect for this cake and the freash coconut juice on the layers makes the cake incredibly moist. A really great texture.

This cake recipe has the best crumb and texture of any I have tried. It is absolutely delicious. I used a scratch pineapple filling between the layers and will try a scratch lemon filling next time. Nothing compares to the taste of fresh unprocessed coconut. It is well worth the extra time baking, peeling, and shredding. The cake and all the "crumbs" disappeared recently during Thanksgiving dinner and I received many compliments and many requests to make the cake for Christmas gifts! Outstanding recipe! Thank you.

I just take every short cut possible with this cake & still get great flavor & texture. No fresh coconut ... no swishing with the milk. Still, a bit labor intensive but a spectacular treat in all its marshmallow frosting glory! My daughter is lactose intolerant and so I substitute Earth Balance for the butter and no one can tell the difference. This one has become our family's birthday cake!

This looked like the cake my daddy used to make every Christmas, but I was disappointed. Find another yellow layer cake recipe that isn't so dense, and put lemon curd (made with the yolks from the eggs that go in the icing) between the layers. I'll stick with the memories of my childhood.

Like the other reviewers said, this cake does take a lot of effort. I make coconut cake every Christmas and with this recipe, I almost got the recipe I want. I would keep the icing recipe ( I don't know why it was oozing from the middle for some, it didn't happen to me), and scrap the cake recipe. I picture the perfect coconut cake as having a light, fluffy icing and cake. The recipe for the cake turns out a tasty, but very heavy, dense cake. The icing however is unique an well worth it.

Making this cake took a year off my life. What a process! All the scraping, peeling and grating has given me arthritis in my hands. The result was good if not a bit sweet for my taste. To me not worth the time.

This recipe is not worth the effort. It is heavy, dense and tastes like flour. The frosting had a problem sticking to the cake, was far to sweet for a 7 minute type frosting and it weaped. YUCK. The only thing that sorta tasted like coconut was the coconut, which was very mild and not able to stand up flavor wise against the sugar frosting. There are many more wonderful coconut cake recipes (old school) that are far better. I'm not sure if the person who wrote the recipe failed to test it. This is not the flavor of the South, so please don't give up trying southern cooking.

Beware ...the cake in this recipe is very very desnse and therefore very heavy. Also 9"layers seemed too thin - I only had 2 9" pans and one 8" so I put the smaller layer in the middle - it actually was a better shape and size. Agree on shredding coconut with a food processor disk but two coconuts produced way too much - I only needed one even for milk. The sugar syrup didnt really taste like coconut at all and isnt really needed - just extra calories. Agree with other writers that middle filling leaks out making cake even more dense..I dont think i would make this again but it did taste pretty good.

Rating: 4
The cake tasted fantastic and it was definitely tedious to make with many steps. I would use a cuisinart to shred the coconut next time, also. I toasted the coconut for the top and it was delicious. I found that the filling became wet and leaked out--I don't know why;perhaps because of the moisture from the fresh coconut? But it still tasted great and nobody noticed it was "wet" except me.

It took all afternoon and got every container in the kitchen dirty - twice - but the result was a huge hit. A friend whose mother used to make her a fresh coconut cake every year for her birthday said it was the first coconut cake she'd had that was as good as her mother's. Suggestion: use a food processor with a shredding disk for the coconut.
