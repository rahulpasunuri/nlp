This is a good basic recipe for Tamale Soup. I used it and it was good . However since the recip didnot say what type of Tamale to use i used pork, then i used beef, and finally i made it with a spcy choizo sausage. The Chorizo won the taste contest. it was a great party recipe as well.

I would probably make this recipe again. It was okay, not outstanding. Followed previous reviewers advice and did not serve with the purchased tamales. I did serve it with tortilla chips and cheese.

Because of the way the family liked this I would make it again. I was not terrible impressed. However, I should have heeded the other readers who garnished with red onion and avocados. That might have enhanced it for me. (I did use canned pinto beans with jalapeno's and my own spicy chili powder but it still wasn't great

I made this last night for my finicy roommate and he loved it! I left out the tamales, added a fresh jalepeno pepper, and sprinkled in corn tortilla strips - made great hearty dish!

I agree with previous reviewers. This is a delicious recipe and doesn't need the addition of the tamales. It is a hearty meal all by itself.

A nice spicy thick style soup. Next time I will make the soup without the tamales...there are enough ingredients to keep the soup interesting. Also I garnished with chopped red onion and avocado as well as the cheese and had soft tortillas on the side
