LOVED IT! Made it for the Super Bowl. I don't make much without garlic so I added 3 large cloves of garlic to the chipoltle peppers when I pureed them. Could have used a bit more zing. I like the sauce more as a dipping sauce than a coat when they are done...

GREAT RECIPE, Sweet, smokey, rich heat, I added 1 tsp of apple cidar vinager and a pinch of cayenne to the glaze to add a little more pop. I roasted the wings on a broiling pan at 450, mid rack, 25 minutes per side, glazing in the last 15. They turned out great! The seeds are key, dont leave them out! I will make again!

Meh. Smoky heat, a little too strong for my taste, but very hard to judge the first time the recipe is made. I didn't think it was too sweet, but I made the following changes: I used smoked paprika, I added 1 oz of calamansi juice, (available in Filipino stores, frozen), and I used the dry rub, grilled the chicken, tossed it in a bowl with the glaze, broiled it 3" from the element until the wings were cooked, boiled the remaining glaze, tossed the cooked chicken and cooked glaze together, added seeds and onion, and served. It was good, but I wouldn't make it without the changes I made.

The sweetness is just delicious but before you know it the spicyness kicks in. Better have a cold drink on hand!

This is a great recipe. I put the dry rub on a couple of hours ahead. I could have used more of the chipotle in adobo sauce, they came out like candy with a spicy bite, but next time, more bite. When the wings were grilled on one side I turned them and basted the cooked side with the glaze. When they were done I transferred them to a cookie sheet and added the majority of the glaze, the sesame seeds and sliced green onions. Everyone enjoyed them and they were not just the same old thing.
