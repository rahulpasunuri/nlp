This recipe is a fantastic base. My friends like more citrus so we usually double if not triple the lime juice and add a little zest. The drink is very pleasant and the vodka is barely noticeable. Very much like a sweet iced tea, I have thoughts to spice it up with a bit of minced ginger.

This was delicious! I recently bought tamarind concentrate at the Asian market and wasn't sure how to use it but happened upon this recipe. The tamarind gives it a nice tang.
