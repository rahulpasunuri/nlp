I had high hopes for this recipe - I'd saved the 2003 issue of Gourmet just for the recipe with the beautiful photo. The recipe must be missing some liquid - the eggs alone weren't enough to bind the dough together so I added just enough ice water to make it all hang together. The dough was incredibly sticky and hard to work with, and the recipe didn't mention dusting the dough with flour before you roll it out, so I ended up with a sticky mess of dough and waxed paper before I sorted that out. I could have forgiven all of that if the end result was tasty, but I ended up with beautiful, flaky pastry that tasted strongly of egg, and overwhelmed the apples. I'd have been better off (and wasted less of my weekend) if I'd used store-bought phyllo and made strudel.

Just OK. I made this along with apple tartlets with caramel sauce. The tartlets were not only much faster to make, but they were way more popular. I don't see the recipe on this web site any longer, but you make an apple compote by cooking 5 lbs of Granny Smith apples with 1 c sugar and 1/4 c lemon juice. Cut circles out of puff pastry, top with the apples and cook at 375 for 25 min., or until the pastry is browned.

I haven't tried this recipe yet (it sounds like a lot of work), but I was confused by the directions. It says to put oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven, but then only directs the cook to use the upper rack (two different parts of the recipe). Could it be that one part is supposed to be cooked in the lower third? Thanks for any help.
