I like all the ingredients in this salad on their own, but the salad was very strange and not at all tasty. The grapefruit overpowered all of the other flavors except the avocado, and the whole taste combination was bizarre. I wouldn't recommend this salad. I'm not sure why this was listed as a "quick" recipe, as it required a good amount of prep work.
