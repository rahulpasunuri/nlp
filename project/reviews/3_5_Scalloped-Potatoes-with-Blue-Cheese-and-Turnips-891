I make this every year for Christmas dinner. We serve this, Beef Wellington and sauteed green beans. The blue cheese sauce with the beef is one of the year's best bites! Not understanding how any blue cheese lover could not rave about this dish.

I thought it tasted odd and put it directly to the freezer for when the day comes when I have no food in the house. As far as scalloped potatoes go, I'll stick to Mom's...made with 2% milk, flour, margarine and ham broth. Comfort food is best simply made.

Turnip was lost will use parsnip for more peppery bite.Nice additon is fresh chopped chives. Great for special occasion and Blue Cheese Lovers!! Will make again.

I have no idea what everyone is raving about. This was a boring dish with a lot of rich ingredients and not a lot of flavor. I won't waste my blue cheese again.

Huge, bold flavors at work here. Four teaspoons of garlic turned out to be 8 or 9 cloves in my case, and 1 1/2 teaspoons of sage is quite a lot. Add the blue cheese in here and this could have easily been flavor overload. I used parsnips instead, which provide a bit more peppery bite than turnips. For weeknight supper, I'll use half and half or straight milk next time to give my arteries a fighting chance. This is definitely a special occasion recipe, and could see it working well with beef roast or steaks. I served it alongside meat loaf and green peas.

I used table cream (18%) instead of heavy cream and added more garlic. A little does go a long way as I only made one serving to serve 16 at a buffet table. Just a little bit leftover and rave reviews by the guests.

This was surprisingly wonderful. We thought by adding turnips it would lessen the taste experience but we were pleasantly surprised with the results. We used a lighter cream instead of whipping cream and added a bit more garlic. Yummy!

To die for!! It is extremely rich and a little goes a long way.
