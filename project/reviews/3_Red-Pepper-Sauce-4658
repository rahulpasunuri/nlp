This recipe is similar to Pilaca, a traditional Italian recipe from Puglia (south of Italy), made with Fried chili pepper: http://www.academiabarilla.com/italian-recipes/puglia/pilacca-fried-chilli-sauce.aspx

I loved this sauce. Being on a low sodium diet, I find it one of the better sauces I have made. Add sun dried tomatoes for a low sodium spaghetti sauce, or add extra spices for something wilder. It's wonderful on meat loaf.
