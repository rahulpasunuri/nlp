Did 1 1/2 recipe for larger crowd today (Easter Sunday) - despite 3 heads of garlic, can't say anyone noticed the garlic! I used fat free half and half and you'd never notice.

Yummy! I was worried by some of the other reviews saying it was nothing to write home about, so I used 3 heads of garlic instead of 2. (My family is really into garlic.) Otherwise I followed the recipe to the letter, and we were all very pleased with the results. The serving bowl was licked clean!

Loved by all and easy to make.

I'm really puzzled by the rave reviews this recipe received, since my family and I were pretty underwhelmed. Ever in search of the best mashed potato recipe, I've tried dozens. Encouraged by the "four fork" rating this one got, I gave this one a try, only to be disappointed, as was my family. Not enough garlic flavor by a long shot--my family could barely taste it. These were just very average mashed spuds. Nothing to write home about.

This was the first mashed potato recipe I've ever tried - and it will be the last. It is fantastic! I tripled the recipe for Thanksgiving dinner and it turned out fine. Roasting the garlic a day ahead makes preparation easy, but I missed the roasted garlic smell the day of Thanksgiving. I've tried using different types of potatoes and although I've loved the dish every time, I think the Yukon Golds are the best.

We loved this recipe. There were eight of us for dinner with quite a few extra side dishes so there was a lot leftover. I'll definitely make this again and again with all varieties of potatoes.

I used good old Russets, not Yukon golds, which in spite of current Whoopla, I find too sweet for most recipes. Not over-powering garlic, nicely subtle. I have a heap of leftovers, since I followed quantities for recipe and had only 5 for dinner. I'm thinking shepherd's pie is coming up on the menu this week!

I searched two cooking websites to find a good roasted-garlic mashed potato recipe for my Christmas dinner: I had 12 people coming over and was confident that this recipe would be the perfect one to compliment my standing rib roast. How right I was! My guests raved about the potatoes and because I roasted the garlic the day before, preparation was a breeze! I was also delighted at how wonderful the kitchen smelled while the garlic roasted. Because of the outstanding flavor and the ease of preparation, I would make this dish again and again. My guests even asked for a copy of the recipe as they departed. Thank you for helping make my Christmas dinner successful and tasty.

I don't usually make mashed potatoes, but my daughter loves them -- this recipe was foolproof and the potatoes weren't lumpy. The flavor of the garlic was lovely, not too overpowering. This one goes in my recipe box for sure!

I doubled the amount of roasted garlic giving the potatoes just the right amount of garlick flavor. I also used a ricer to mash them, and as a result, I had the creamiest and tastiest potatoes ever.

This was very easy and not at all too strong. Another keeper!

Super easy, not over-the-top garlicky, and just really tasty. Will toss my other garlick mashed potato recipes and use only this in the future.

Liked this very much though I expected the garlic flavor to be much stronger.
