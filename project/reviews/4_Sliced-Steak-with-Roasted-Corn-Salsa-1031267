So nice to make something beyond boring old steak 'n' potatoes now and then. This makes a ton of food, so much that this could easily accommodate 6 people rather than 4, especially if you serve it with potatoes.

Fantastic recipe! I only used one jalapeno, seeds in, and it was quite spicy, but not overpowering. I've also made the salsa with chicken (same spice mix on the chicken) and it was also a hit!

YUM! Made this for my husband's birthday party. I did splurge and bought rib eye steaks and they were tender and delicious. The corn salsa really stole the show. I highly recommend this recipe.

This is a great recipe. I made this for my very picky family and it was a huge hit.

Corn Salsa is tasty & pretty. By habit, I scraped the cobs after cutting off the corn, which was a mistake as it kept the corn from roasting & browning. Also toned the heat down by seeding & deveining the jalapeno. Great late summer meal with fried okra & ribeyes. Good enough for company.

After reading the reviews, I made the corn salsa as specified but decreased the jalapeno to one half and eliminated the seeds, added one TB of red onion to the cooked green onions to add structure and flavor, and substituted parsley for cilantro because I had parsley on hand. I cooked the corn the full 8 minutes,stirring it every few minutes until it was lightly browned, cooked the green onion and garlic in the same pan after removing the corn (thus incorporating the carmelized flavor of the corn into the butter), put all the salsa ingredients into the pan after the green onion had cooked for 3 minutes, stirred it well off the heat and left it to sit until the sirloin was done. Unfortunately, the salsa is so delicious I'm not sure there will be any left by the time my husband gets home and grills the sirloin! This salsa is extremely flavorful, easy, inexpensive, different, and quick to make.

This salsa is so good! I added a can of black beans when it was time to put the corn back in the pan. At the end, I gently re-heat the mixture then take it off the heat and add the zest and juice of a lime, some chopped red onion and a chopped avacado. I always serve it with the Southwest Lime Chicken with Ancho Chili Sauce on this site. It is great cold the next day!

Fantastic, but will make with 1/2 jalapeno next time. We're not shy about hot food, but that was way too much heat.

This salsa is divine! It is so completely delicious and beautiful colors. Served for father's day with grilled flank steak, and "Grilled Potato and Summer Squash Salad with Marjoram-Lemon Vinaigrette" (from Epicurious) as the side - substituted parsley in that to go better with the flavors of the salsa, and it had to be one of the most colorful meals I've ever done! Highly recommend this salsa for multiple purposes.

The steak was OK, but the problem was I had a bigger steak and didn't increase the spices. I should have doubled it. Will do so next time, even with the recommended size of steak. The salsa, though, was great! I used a bag of frozen corn and added a can of black beans, chopped red onion instead of scallions. It was wonderful! I'll make it again as a general side with any main.

I had high hopes for this recipe, since the theme and ingredients are consistent with my family's eating preferences. My husband enjoyed it, but said it was too spicy to serve to guests. I was less of a fan (edible, but not worth the trouble).

This was DIVINE. I didn't expect a salsa to go well with steak, but believe me, it does! YUM!!!!!

Honestly, I just make the roasted-corn salsa as a side dish to many meals. It's the cumin that gets me.

This has become a staple in our household - everyone loves it. I'm even lazy and use canned corn and it get raves. I always use Sirloin and have never had it be tough. This really is a winner!

The roasted-corn salsa is awesome. If you like spicy... this is great.

Great for summer. While the steak is good, the salsa is really the star (especially when the corn is grilled rather than cooked in the skillet) and worth making solo.

I don't know what happened to me after all the wonderful reviews but my steak was tough. I would probably change to a more tender cut of meat if asked to do this again.

I had six ears of fresh sweet corn and made just the corn salsa to serve with chips at a party. I doubled the recipe, added some red onion for color and crunch, and cut down on the green part of the scallions so that onion would not overwhelm. Delicious and got rave reviews.

The salsa is fabulous! I made it with grilled chicken the second time and added black beans, some fresh diced red onion (for a nice crunchy bit of texture)and some diced avacado. The addition of some lime juice is wonderful!!

I put this salsa together this afternoon, using frozen corn and adding a can of black beans. Very good! I plan to serve it with tequila lime chicken from another recipe on this site.

This dish was wonderful. I used sirloin, frozen corn, and roma tomatoes, and everything turned out just delicious. Since we like things spicy over here, I used 4 fresh jalapenos, minced and sliced. Cut down on the scallions (only used 1 1/2), and next time will cut down on the cilantro also (but that's just to appease my guy :) Along with broiled asparagus and new red potatoes, this dish served two people, with lunch leftovers for both of us. Definately going to make this again -- can't wait to impress my steak-and-potatoes Dad with this recipe!!

Both steak and corn are Excellent. I have made the corn salsa for this many times-added only a little lime zest and juice from 1/2 lime. THe corn is great as a side dish for many southwest/mexican meals.

The corn salsa is absolutely delectable; it turns this dish into something really special. I added more seasoning to the steak. Served this with Grilled Potato and Onion Packages (this site) and it was fabulous and so easy!

Served this as my contribution to a Memorial Day pot-luck. It was AWESOME & very pretty! Followed the recipe to the letter & it was great! Folks at the barbeque hadn't had this combintion of flavors before & there was a resounding, "MMMM" when they tasted this dish. I used the left-over steak & salsa (there wasn't much, although I doubled the recipe) to make quesadillas for dinner tonight. I will definately make this again

We loved this fresh quick summer entree. I was a bit skeptical about putting salsa on steak, but it was so wonderful, I wanted a bit of salsa with every bite of steak.

I really just made the corn salsa and served it with cornmeal crusted chicken. The corn salsa is delicious. It looked and tasted so lively and fresh and the jalapeno gave it a great kick. I can't wait to try it with the steak.

Aww yeah! There is nothing wrong with this dish, that's for sure. I also used canned corn because fresh corn in Michigan at this time of year is not very good, and I also cooked the steak on the Foreman. My boyfriend/guinea pig loved it, and I caught my roommate eating the leftover salsa, cold, with tortilla chips the next day--it was that good. When fresh corn starts piling up in the grocery store, I'll definitely make it again.

This was excellent!! My boyfriend loved it, he asked if I would make the corn again. I used canned corn and it worked fine. I also cooked the steak in a George Foreman grill and it was great!

This is one of my "Restaurant Grade" recipes that I trot out to impress my impressionable friends. All of the ingredients are simple and fresh and go together very well, and you can taste everything in every bite. The presentation is great, and it never fails to please. Frozen corn? Why not!

I definitely recommend this dish! This was so delicious and so quick. The flavors were wonderful. I can't wait to make it again. Next time I think I'll make more of the corn salsa.

This is a great receipe. The combination of flavors is wonderful. I made this for dinner with friends and they loved it. I also didn't have a cast iron skillet and my non stick pan worked fine.

The corn salsa was delicious. I did not have a cast iron skillet (I do now) and it worked fine in my regular non-stick.

Highly recommended! The smoky, spicy salsa makes the dish. If using canned corn, note 1 can will yield 1-3/4 cup. Can use regular frying pan for corn - just let corn stick to pan to roast it. Use gloves when dealing with Jalapeno peppers! I bought 4 steaks instead of 1 piece.

A very nice quick and easy dish. We are making it again for guests next week. Canned corn worked fine - but stuck to the pan a little. Added a little roasted pepper and served with toasted corn tortillas. Perfect!

Excellent taste and the salsa complements the meat nicely. I used a grill pan and was very pleased with the results. The leftovers, including the salsa, make great sandwiches on crunchy french bread. Layer the steak with the salsa on the bread...no need for any condiments whatsoever!

My husband and I serve this dish when we entertain and it is always a hit! It is fairly inexpensive and makes a lot of food! We use canned corn in the winter and it tastes fine. Be sure not to omit the jalepeno, as it gives this dish the perfect spice!!

I have made this dish twice now (once for guests). It is very flavorful and makes a great late-summer dinner. I agree to reduce the salt a bit. By the way, drained canned corn works just fine.

This dish is fantastic! In addition it was very easy to prepare, with only minimal last minute preparation. This makes it excellent for entertaining. After roasting the corn, and sauteing the onions I had alot of the spices stuck to the botton of the skillet. I deglazed the skillet with a bit of tequila before adding the corn and tomatoes. I would use the tequila again when making this delicious recipe.

Great summer fare. Even my kids (9+14) liked it esp. the older one. Only change is to decrease the amount of salt in the salsa. We are not big salt eaters and this was quite salty to our tastes.

The salsa is fabulous! Probably the best I've ever had/made. For 2 people I used 2 ears of corn, 4 scallions, 2 garlic cloves, a very large jalapeno, 2 small plum tomatoes, & halved+ on the spices. We ate it all. In addition, the spices sprinkled on the steak really give it a great flavor. This is a relatively simple, very southwestern menu good enough for company. I served it with a Spicy Garlic Roasted Potato recipe from Cooking Light 8/2000.
