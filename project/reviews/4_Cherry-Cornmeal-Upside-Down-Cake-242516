This recipe made the blue ribbon top-ten list of best cakes on Epicurious (see the side bar on the homepage of this website for the list). Was I disappointed! The cake was not a disaster by any means - it was just mediocre. I made it exactly as written.

This was so different and wonderful! Took it to a picnic - big hit. Sweet but not too sweet - the cornmeal made it very picnicky. (Although not finger food - it's pretty crumbly.) So nice to have something different to do with all our local northwest cherries right now. The only change I made was to add a little almond extract to the batter. (And BTW, thank you to the reviewer who suggested beating the eggs whites first if you only have one mixer bowl - definitely cut some time off the recipe that way.)

Very good. I had a bucket of Rainier cherries that I needed to use up. Presentation was not as beautiful as the bings, but flavor was exceptional.

I loved this cake. It's rustic and simple but definitely not boring. Pitting fresh cherries is a labor of love, and this cake is worth the effort. Next time I might add a tiny bit of almond extract to the cake batter, but it's really good as is.

Really good! Reminded spouse of Arkansas grandma. Added a dash of cloves to batter. 400 gram package of frozen cherries worked fine and easy.

My March 2009 review spoke about using frozen cherries, which worked quite well. Recently I made the cherry 'topping' to use over ice cream with a different brand of frozen cherries. The sauce was good but the cherries themselves had no taste whatsoever, and I had to discard it. So, beware!--Use fresh cherries or taste the frozen ones before using!

Just made this cake tonight and it came out great. I used 3 cups of frozen pitted dark sweet cherries which I let thaw a little before adding to the butter/sugar mix. It made a lot of juice, but a lot of that thickened when cooked. This is a delicious, rustic looking cake. Would be great with a little vanilla ice cream too!

This cake is excellent. I make a lot of cakes and this is the best I've made all year. Several reviews have said that there aren't enough cherries. I think the confusion is because it recommends 3 cups. I measured out 21 ounces and I imagine it would actually be 5 or 6 cups by volume.

Made the cake as a 'coffee' or breakfast cake this weekend. Very Good. I doubled the cherries with only time-and-a-half the brown sugar and butter (in the fruit vinegar part.) This was a goodly amount of cherries, not overdone. I was alittle concerned as there was quite a bit of juice from the cherries but all was fine. Husband wants it with ice cream next time.

Delicious! I used a square cake pan which worked great. I also beat the egg whites first, then held them in a separate bowl while completing the rest of the mixing tasks (just lazy - I have only one bowl for my KitchenAid mixer, and this saves a step of transferring the batter and washing out the mixing bowl to be able to beat the egg whites).

This is an interesting dessert for foodies and their friends because of the unusual combination of ingredients. I was disappointed that the balsamic vinegar taste did not come through more strongly. The amount of cherries did not seem sufficient to make a nice layer in a frying pan, so I halved the cake portion of the recipe and baked it in a small sponge form cake pan, using parchment paper that stuck out beyond the pan to prevent drips.. I used frozen, pitted cherries even though I am anti- frozen-food, but the cooked cherry mixture tasted quite good. In fact I was very tempted to simply serve the cherry mixture over vanilla ice cream and not make the cake!

Unique and we enjoyed it. Took much longer to cook for us.

I have already made this cake twice and will definately make it again. I love to bake cakes in my cast iron skillet so this recipe was perfect for me!

This was really good, but I didn't think it was particularly moist as some of the previous reviews indicate. Maybe if it had some sour cream instead of the milk? I did really like it for cherries, though, and the cornmeal makes it taste almost like a really good, sweet cornbread.

I made this without the vinegar, and it was incredibly good. I'll definitely make it again and try it with some good quality balsamic, which I know is usually wonderful with fresh sweet fruit. Even without that, this recipe is perfectly delicious. Now I have a great recipe to use for the cherries I never know what to do with when I can't resist them at farmer's markets when they're in season. The cake really is very surprisingly moist. I made it in the cast-iron skillet, and it only needed to cook for about 30 minutes. I think cooking this in cast iron really added something to the texture of the cake -- it gave it a nice color and a very slightly chewy crust, and it came out easily when turing it over onto the cake plate. The cherries stayed beautiful burgandy red too! This was super simple to make and the result extremely rewarding. I can hardly wait to make it again!

This was so good, I am tempted to make again. However, what a mess in the oven. The batter spilled everywhere. And when that problem was contained the top (eventually the bottom) burned, and I had to scrape off the burnt part. I also would be curious about preserving the bright red color of cherries as shown in pic.

Great summer dessert! I halved the recipe (only had 1/2 the cherries called for and didn't want to buy more). Was dessert for a Sunday lunch and by Sunday night it was gone (between 4 people).

This cake got rave reviews at a recent birthday party. Besides pitting the cherries, it wasn't difficult and had a nice presentation.

I heated the cherry mix in a saucepan then poured into a 10-inch cake pan. Will try an add'l cup of cherries next. Freezes well.

I made this for my mother's birthday, and everyone loved it. It's an easy recipe, very moist cake, and a great twist on an old classic.

I loved this cake. Dole sells wonderful frozen, pitted cherries that are almost like fresh once defrosted. I added a layer of roughly chopped roasted almonds to the cake, and I mixed some orange zest into the batter. I also increased the balsamic. I was so, so good!!

This is a really, really good, moist cake! I was surprised how moist it turned out, actually. I used fine cornmeal, because that's all I had. In addition, I didn't use the skillet to bake the cake. Instead, I used a springform pan. The only thing I might recommend in doing that is to put parchment down first as the bottom stuck a little bit and sort of ruined an otherwise lovely presentation! Delicious, though, truly!

This cake was very good and a great way to use seasonal cherries. The only problem I had was that the cherries in my version did not have the deep glistening burgundy color that the photo shows. Mine was a more of a brown red. Any suggestions to keep the bright color?

This cake was amazing - easily one of the best cakes I've ever had. I will definitely make this again and again.

Very easy, not too sweet and if you can get past the cost of fresh cherries, an ideal recipe! I didn't have dark brown sugar and subbed light, but it was still very good. I will definitely make this again.

Excellent cake. I will definately make this again. I made a mistake and used 2 Tbsp's of balsamic vinegar instead of the 2 tsp's called for. The topping smelled very vinegary when the cake was turned out but evaproated enough on cooling that the flavor was still excellent. I wouldn't do it again intentionally, but it's still good enough that I would serve it to guests! The cake is moist, light and fluffy. The cornmeal really lends a nice flavor and a wonderful slight grit to the texture. It's perfect with the cherry topping. Just to note, I made this in a 10 inch cast iron skillet, used regular butter, frozen dark sweet cherries, half n'half and regular corn meal and it still turn out perfectly, error and all!
