we substituted with a small amount of bacon. lots of flavor but not all the fat. if you have left over batter they're GREAT with maple syrup for breakfast!

I made these for a potluck barbecue. In order to reduce the fat content as I knew most guests would prefer it, I used the oil and substituted Tofurkey sausage. No one guessed that they were vegetarian and were loved by all.

Fantastic. The flavor of these griddle cakes were great. A good old fashioned southern meal.

I used chives instead of scallions. Also, turkey breakfast sausage. These were really tasty. I made a half recipe for two people for breakfast and skipped the orange honey butter. We had maple syrup available but they were actually really good plain. I cooked the corn for only a minute or so, and that worked fine. I cooked these on an electric griddle and found I didn't need to use much clarified butter at all. As I made them, I think they were not too much of a splurge for a weekend breakfast.

I made this recipe twice. The second time I cooked the sausage with some red pepper flakes and added some cayenne pepper to the batter. We skipped the butter and spread a little sour cream on them.

Cynicalanddisgusted if there is a problem with the fat and cholesterol content there are always things you can substitute to decrease the overall fat content. Use turkey sausage instead andbuse grapeseed instead of butter. If you notice a deficiency somewhere just make a suggestion for those who are a little more consious of how much fat they consume. I tried it with the substitutions I suggested andbthey turned out quite excellent. Its good you pay attention to what is in a recipe and the need to share but maybe a change in presentation will get better results and spawn new ideas.

I made these substituting turkey Kielbasa to help reduce the fat content and it was great! Just a thought....

I think we're probably all old enough to read the ingredients and figure out whether or not we want it in our diet.

cynicalanddisgusted, you said you would hardly take a reviewer to task for pointing out the fat content in this recipe, but you aren't a reviewer. You came here specifically to post the fat content. When people see that there is sausage and butter in a recipe, they know it is not the most healthy dish but, as sfike said, there can be room for this kind of recipe in a mostly balanced and reasonably healthy diet.

Preparing these 1/3 of the recommended size to serve as an appetizer at my Derby Day Bash and frying on a non-stick pan with the option of the orange butter on the side - that should annoy the food police and take some wind out of their sails...

forgot to add the forks to my review

let's remember that this is a forum for evaluating the taste of a recipe.we can all read and add and therefore see the fat content of any given recipe, so all this righteous ranting over dietary values is misplaced. these little cakes are delicious and work as appetizers as well as a breakfast cake. yum. will definitely make these again.

Touche sfike... it really irks me when some of these self-rightous dietary freaks criticize without reading a recipe carefully or even trying it out.

Rating: 0
sfike = no one appointed me the food police. Still, if the recipes fail to disclose fat content (especially when it is very high) I would hardly take a reviewer to task for doing so. As long as it is served to 8 people, you're right it ain't that bad. But do you really thik these are being made for 8 people? Finally, I didn't tell anyone not to try them, not to eat them, or not to enjoy them. Just pay attention - the writers aren't freely disclosing so I am.

Rating: 0
Cynicalanddisgusted - first off the recipe is for 8-10. Picking 9 as a good median, the saturated fat per serving is about 23 grams - not great, but okay as a splurge with proper diet and exercise. And who appointed you to the food police anyway?

Pay attention to what you cook. These babies have 256 grams of fat - the whole daily fat allowance for four people.

These were delicious! The orange/honey/butter syrup is a must. Made lots and were great the next morning as a cold breakfast. My 15 month old granddaughter loved them as a snack.

LOVED these! Did not, however, love the whole clarified-butter-in-cast-iron- skillet thing. I burned the first four I made (well, scorched them, a little) and then decided to use my electric griddler. MUCH better; no burning, no additional butter needed, and no need to drain; they came out perfectly. Kept them warm in the oven, and they only got crispier and yummier. I also thought the orange honey butter would be a weird note, but it really works. Cakes are still wonderful by themselves, though.

Made these silver dollar size for Super Bowl. Wonderful! Crispy, light, flavorful...everyone loved them. Exceptionally good right off the griddle. Used grapeseed oil rather than butter which was nice. One friend put the butter mixture in hot water to soothe her sore throat. Great that this uses buttermilk, whole wheat flour and cornmeal.I'll make these as a regular!
