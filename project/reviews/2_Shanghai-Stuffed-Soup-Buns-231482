The flavors of this recipe are close to the Shanghai soup dumplings we can purchase here in San Francisco, but the proportions are off. There should be more aspic to less meat, and I would suggest using less dough for each of the buns. The bun wrapper should be very thin and delicate, these were just too thick. Next time I try these, I'm going to double the aspic and halve the meat mixture. Read more about our trial and error on my September 26-28 postings at www.cookingchronicles.com.
