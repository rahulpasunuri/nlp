I am from Santa Fe. I would be lost without posole. Its great when the chike is fresh.

This is a great launching pad for an amazing soup. If you haven't tried Posole, you're in for a treat. I customize with enchilada sauce and a chunk of good chocolate. I also start the pork 2 or 3 days in advance, boiling, cooling, then skimming fat each day. Use a frozen water bottle tucked in the center to help cool evenly. Lastly, I always make a vegetarian version of my main courses for friends, they loved it with spicy veggie sausage.

As a frequent visitor to Santa Fe, we have searched for a great pozole recipe. This had promise...but it has way too much liquid and not much flavor. It has been suggested to me to pan roast the dried chiles & sautee the onions and garlic for more flavor. Any comments?

P.S. I used bone-in pork shoulder/blade/butt and had the butcher cut up. I like cooking w/ bones. I then pulled it all out, pulled apart the meat, and discarded the bones.

This is a good, solid recipe, but to be more authentic, I cooked the pork initially how Mexicans do: in water, garlic (lots!) and some onions. Pork has alot of fat and cooking the pork in pork fat intensifies the flavor sufficiently. Near end I added Mexican oregano. Added the chicken stock when I put in the chiles. Homemade fried tortillas were a nice touch w/ avocaco.

Pozole is one of my favorite "one pot" comfort dishes. I have experimented with beef, pork and chicken (with green chiles)recipes and have perfected a simple, but traditional pork version (using pork shoulder or pork butt roast). Several recent recipes have used canned chipotle chiles in adobo sauce. Try this, pureed in your mini processor, in your pozole instead of going through the tedious soaking, chopping and straining exercise...the whole can makes it HOT!

This is a good recipe for pozole. A few things of note: Country Style pork ribs are really the pork shoulder, cut up. Save some money, and buy a whole pork shoulder. Also - some people find the skins of the dried pepper a little tough, and troubling in sauces. I typically either soak and then scrape the inside flesh off the skin (discarding skin), or blend normally, and put through a sieve. Other than that, this recipe is spot on. Serve it with sliced cabbage, white onion chopped with cilantro, radishes, more oregano, pickled jalepenos, and Los Pericos tostadas, broken in chunks. Makes my mouth water just thinking about it.
