This works well in a slow cooker for busy days. Saute vegetables first. I couldn't believe my picky 5 year-old asked for leftover cabbage the next day! This is really pretty mild for a sauerkraut dish and I skipped rinsing the kraut.

Fab ... had an Oktoberfest party and made this as my contribution ... very light, very subtle. Caraway is essential but aquavit is not (used vermouth instead). Great twist on boring old sauerkraut. (not sour at all!)

Flavors and textures play off each other well. Fresh cabbage and sauerkraut blend, dried pears do not taste too sweet, aquavit adds zip. I suggest adding more meat. We added thin-sliced pork chops and more kielbasa.
