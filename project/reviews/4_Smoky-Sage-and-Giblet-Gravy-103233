I have made this for several thanksgivings. It is requested by my family regularly!

Ok, lets understand that I'm a 50 year old male who didn't begin to cook seriously until 1994. I needed something simple. That said, Gravy Made Easy was a challenge the first time guys; but, the outcome was so, so good. I now make it every Thanksgiving and not just because my wife likes me monitoring the turkey and making the gravy. It gets raves every year.

I've made a simplified version of this recipe for the past two Thanksgivings and plan to make it again this year. Everyone seems to enjoy it. I skip the giblet broth step altogether and start where the instructions read "GRAVY", reserving the cooked bacon for my dressing. I keep some canned broth on hand for basting the turkey and in case the resulting juices aren't sufficient for the recipe.
