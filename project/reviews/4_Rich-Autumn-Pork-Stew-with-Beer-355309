This is absolutely delicious! I prepare this dish for guests a lot in the fall and winter and everyone loves it, including the kids. The brown sugar is unnecessary, as the onions, carrots and apples provide plenty of sweetness, and the beer provides an earthy richness. (not sure where the sour would be coming from in another review). No need for flour either, just reduce it down some. It just gets better! Perfect with either the noodles or good crusty bead

First attempt at a pork stew and very pleased with the end results. Made a few minor changes; added flour to seasoning prior to browning the pork. Added a healthy pinch of crushed red pepper flake. Cut the garlic in half as I questioned that I may have written the recipe down wrong. Used an apple caramel spice ale. Instead of simmering on the stove, I put it in the oven @ 350 for the same time frame. Did thicken it a bit with corn starch. Found it delicious and no need to serve it over egg noodles. Think it would be great with mashed potatoes!

I made almost exactly to the letter of the recipe except for cutting the pieces of pork smaller and dredging in flour before browning. The addition of the flour made the broth very rich and thick. For me, this was just too sweet tasting. When it was almost ready I tasted and because of the sweetness I added 1 tsp of salt, stirred and let it cook for a few more minutes - tasted again and it was still too sweet for me. I added another tsp of salt and I liked it better but still not enough for a 4-star rating. I also think it would be better with a little heat, maybe a 1/4 to 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper.

I had no apples, so I used pears instead. I also followed the advice of pumpkin beer that I had left over from the fall. It was AMAZING!!! My hubby didn't even realize he was eating pears-and didn't complain when I told him (after). The flavor is amazing and this recipe is now a staple meal in our house! YUM!!!

Made this last night for dinner. Delicious recipe. I doubled everything and added some red pepper flake for some heat. Let it simmer away for 2 1/2 hours. Pork was tender and delicious. I used 2 bottles of Sam Adams Octoberfest and it was perfect! Great stew for a cold day. Also took my hand blender and gave it a good wiz toward the end to get some good pork bits and thickness to the broth. YUM!

Made this for dinner tonight as I had a roast pork in the freezer I wanted to use. I mostly followed the recipe but I did dredge the pork in flour prior to browning as I had read that the stew was rather soupy otherwise. I am glad that I did it. My husband said it was a keeper and he wouldn't mind the leftovers for lunch. My teenage daughter didn't complain at all and ate most of her plate. In my books that is 4 forks as I have a very fussy eaters in my family.

I've just made this recipe and, though it requires a lot of time, I LOVE it. I'm also very happy with the quantity of food...maybe it's just me, but this seems to be much more than 4 servings. Can't wait to dig in on leftovers!

Really liked this recipe, as it is different from my other stews. You cannot skip the brown sugar...it adds so much to the flavor. I also used a pumpkin beer which added depth to the flavor. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Even my daughter, who doesn't like pork, loved it.

Tasty and hearty stew, but I doctored it a bit... I substituted the fresh/canned tomatoes with 1 6oz can of tomato paste. Also kicked it up with some cumin, oregano, a little chili powder and 2+ tablespoons of Vietnamese chili garlic paste. Threw in 2 small purple potatoes, chopped. Was out of brown sugar, so I subbed in white sugar and a little Gravenstein apple juice instead. Did have to use 1 TBSP of cornstarch to thicken it a bit. Served it on a bed of rice and topped it with some grated cotswold cheese (has green onions in it). A hearty, lazy meal for a Sunday evening with leftovers.

I shared this recipe with my cooking class students and everyone loved it!!! It was more like a soup than a stew, but we all enjoyed it in bowls that way. About 12 oz. egg noodles is just right for this. Enjoy!

Loved this dish. Got a tip that it comes out more soupy than stewlike so I dredged the pork tips in flour before browning. Added more carrots and onion and served w egg noodles. Delicious!! Next time I'll have the butcher trim the fat for me. A thankless job.

This is a very tasty dish, especially after it's had a day in the refrigerator. I found it tedious to trim the meat from all the fat, but really liked the flavors. I used twice the amount of carrots in the recipe, chicken stock instead of broth, and a dark local (Maine) beer. It made at least 6 generous servings. Good with a crusty, grainy, bread.

My husband and I loved this dish. It's perfect for an autumn evening dinner. The flavor of the apples with the pork went very well together. It was very easy to prepare too. My kids, however, did not care for it. It is sweet and a bit sour so I'm not sure if that's what they didn't like.
