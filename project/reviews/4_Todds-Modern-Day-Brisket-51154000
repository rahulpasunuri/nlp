Great recipe. Family loved it. Did not realize I had to weigh it down until I already bought ingredients, but will now do that to all my briskets

This looks delicious, but it's important to point out that Ashkenazi Jews do not eat mustard seed or use canola oil during Passover. Paprika is permitted, but I've yet to find smoked paprika for Pesach.

This is just about the best brisket recipe I have made - and I've made quite a few. Everyone at the sedar raved about it. Only problem - almost no left-overs, people kept coming back for more! We a little more than doubled the recipe, making a 7.5 lb. second cut of brisket and used a good quality inexpensive Portugese wine that our local wine store recommended. My butcher carries a good quality boxed veal stock, which also added to the ease of making this dish. We made the recipe as specified,the day before serving it, no need to fidget with it. This recipe is a keeper. I will be making this again and again.
