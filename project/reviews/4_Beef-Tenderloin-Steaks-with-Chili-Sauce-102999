I know it was completely cheating, but I used chili powder instead of the dried chilis and added an extra tomato, and it was delicious.

Not that great. I agree with the other cook that the flavors were off.

Excellent. Used only chicken stock in the sauce. Also delicious on grilled chicken breast. I served this with chili-lime sweet potatoes, and asparagus with wasabi mayonnaise. Very elegant dinner.

Don't know what made this "off", but it wasn't a winner. Maybe I didn't toast the chilies enough? My husband liked it a bit more than I did, but I don't think I'll make it again.

Scrumptious!!!!! Followed recipe exactly with the exception that the sauce took quite a bit longer to reduce.......Beautiful results!!!!

Very tasty! This recipe was a great success. For yucks (or because I took a temporary leave of my senses) I also made a Bernaise sauce, so my guests could choose. Most had both, and commented on the great contrast. I served this with the Whipped Chipotle Sweet Potatoes from this site, and it proved to be a great companion dish. For any leftovers of meat, whether filet mignon or top sirloin, slice it thinly and warm it with this sauce - Heaven all over again.

This sauce has a very unique flavor. I was unable to find either of the chiles. I substituted 6 oz. CHILI ANCHO MEXICAN COOKING SAUCE, stirred in after the reduction and eliminated the tomato. Guests raved. I also grilled the tenderloins outside because of a beautiful Indian Summer evening.

Wonderful recipe! I didn't have a blender so I had to filter the chili sauce in with the wine sauce but it was still very tasty.

I am not an experienced cook and my dinner guests were blown away by this dish. It was fabulous. Simple, yet gourmet. I served this with mashed potatoes and mexican corn, as someone suggested. It was the perfect meal.

This dish was wonderful! We had friends coming over and we wanted to make something big on flavor, but light on last minute fussing. We served it with a green salad and the Mexican corn recipe found on this sight and it was great.

This was an easy and delicious change to the usual steak, the sauce does take quite a while to reduce but its well worth it

I'd like to make this dish this weekend and am wondering of those of you who've made it, what side dishes did you serve?

These steaks are great. Just the style I wanted to capture and easy to make as well.

This was excellent. The only alteration I made was to rub the steaks with a little olive oil and fresh minced garlic(in addition to the salt and pepper). Also, it took a long time to reduce the sauce (closer to 30).

Always a crowd pleaser

Amazing sauce... Have made this many times and everyone raves. Definately a keeper!

Excellent. Try to find a very low sodium beef broth or make it yourself. Otherwise after reducing a while the salt gets pretty concentrated. I actually forgot to put the rosemary in, but it was still a fantastic sauce. I grilled the steaks instead of cooking them in the pan.
