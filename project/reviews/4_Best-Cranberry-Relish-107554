I loved this recipe after I added my own twists, including Bourbon. 1. In place of the granulated sugar I used 2 Teaspoons of Organic Stevia. 2. I didn't have Cranberry Juice, so I used 1 Cup of Orange Juice from a carton. 3. Since I didn't have oranges, I used grounded up Organic Orange Peel. I also added Bourbon to taste. I used a recipe a few years ago similar to this that I couldn't find that called for Bourbon that my Husband loved! He also puckered up and loved this one too!!! I used a medium-high or closer to a high heat, due to the reviewers stating they couldn't get their cranberries to "pop". My cranberries did pop!! My mixture never formed a foam. Before I added the Bourbon, I raised the heat to High, added the Bourbon stirring continually for 2-3 minuted or until the alcohol taste burned off. I had my Husband taste it before I put it in a bowl to refrigerate. He took a taste, said it was wonderful, puckered up and gave me a big kiss!!

The day before Th'giving while preparing ahead, my food processor broke so I quickly had to find a recipe that didn't require one and used ingredients I had on hand. If truth be told, I was reluctant to use a recipe from Parade but thanks to all of the suggestions here, I doctored it with less sugar, used all orange juice but added about a tablespoon of lemon juice and chopped up about a tablespoon of candied ginger. After removing the scum, I used a hand-held potato masher to get it to more or a relish consistency and strained thru a sieve to remove the excess liquid. It's perfect! Tomorrow, just before serving, I plan to supreme an orange and chop up some pieces to mix in. I'm sure it will be a hit -- thanks everyone!

I made it this Thanksgiving and it was delicious. I added about a teaspoon-ish of fresh grated ginger and it was lovely. I made it the day before and the flavors blended very well. This is a keeper!

My variation: use 1 cup sugar; instead of cranberry juice, use 1/4 cup port + 1/4 cup pom juice

I loved it! I made it twice. At Thanksgiving I used a 12 oz bag of cranberries and 3/4 cup sugar and replaced the cranberry juice w 1/2 c sweet red wine. Initially tasted sweet enough but seemed to lose some sweetness? Made at Christmas-used 16 oz cranberries, 1.5 c sugar, white sweet wine and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. Loved it. Not too sweet. Great mixed with greek yogurt days later.

Delicious! I would use a tad less sugar as well...and I like it sweet! The cranberries didn't pop for me either. I used a hand held strainer to aid in crushing them.

After reading the reviews, I did cut the sugar down to half; then added a bit of maple syrup to taste. Added ginger and cinnamon and it is the best. I'm making more today and am going to play with substituting red wine for the cranberry juice; recall doing that once and it was a hit.

Several family memebers who normally don't eat cranberries at Thanksgiving said it was the best they ever had and they took seconds! I did add some finely grated ginger.

I was never a huge cranberry relish fan, but this is good stuff. I did modify the sugar as others suggested in sweetening to taste. We stirred it continuously tho', so never had a foam on top. We had a 3 year old and 2 - 18 month olds who DEVOURED this at Thanksgiving, having multiple servings. Everyone loved it.

Tasty & easy! However, we had 8 people at dinner & only ate about 1/4 of what this made. I would cut the recipe in half or more.

Waaay too sweet. I may try it again, because I think it has potential, but I will use half the sugar.

This was such an easy recipe, why would anyone want to buy the canned stuff?? I made it with about one and a half cups of sugar (half granulated and half natural/demerrara), added about a quarter cup of extra orange juice, and a half teaspoon of freshly grated ginger just for an extra kick. It tastes great now, but I expect that it will taste even better on Thursday, once the flavors have had a chance to get to know each other better!

I H A T E cranberry relish, and I loved this, it was a huge hit! I followed all of the tips from the people who suggested to half the sugar. You all were right, it was still very sweet, but just perfectly so! I also doubled the zest and added a large dash of extra oj. WOW! Yummy! What a great new tradition. Thank you epicurious for this one.

A great twist on classic cranberry sauce! After reading reviews, I made it with about 1 1/4 cups sugar - it turned out great!!

Simple and delicious. didn't have cranberry juice so I used pomegranate and frozen orange juice. Upped the zest and it still came out phenomenal. And I don't even like cranberry sauce!

Yum! This is the classic cranberry sauce. Add the sugar bit by bit so that you can make it as sweet as you'd like, but no sweeter.

I liked the intense orange/cranberry flavor. A lot of Wow!s at my Thanksgiving table - I took it as a compliment. Was also asked for the recipe, which is always a good sign. I especially liked that it just took 15 minutes to make & could be made ahead of time.

I don't care for the orange-cranberry taste mixture in anything, so I used a whole cup of unsweetened cranberry juice and only half the sugar. It was very good!

This relish was delicious, but waaay too sweet, even with unsweetened cranberry juice. I'll definitely make it again, but with half the sugar.

How could someone not like this recipe with so much sugar? One completely looses the unique tartness of cranberry. I suggest cutting the amount of sugar by no less than 50%. Not only does it bring out the characteristics of this berry but it is also much more healthy.

The best cran relish ever. I used 3/4 the amount of sugar, though. The flavor is fresh and not too sweet but I think the fresh orange juice and the cranberry juice (I used 100% juice, sweetened)really make this outstanding. I will be serving it tomorrow!

Simple and delicious. Be sure to use 100% cranberry juice and NOT cranberry cocktail which has water and sugar in it. My 7 yr. old was so proud to contribute a dish to our Thanksgiving meal!

This was just great with slight changes: add more orange zest and juice than it calls for (amount up to you), and then put it through a fine mesh strainer to remove the cranberry skins and seeds. Then add some extra zest at the end. It just refines everything: the color is gorgeous and the flavor is spectacular.

I would definitely make this relish again. I changed it a tad and used Splenda instead of sugar and also made a "walnut butter" out of 1/2 lb of shelled walnuts, and 1/4 c of Orange Juice, the processed it with the "S" blade until it was the consistency of peanut butter. I cooked it in with everything else however, you could use it as topping if you wanted.

So very yummy! And super simple... after you've had this you'll never be satisfied with the congealed stuff in a can.

Very easy and yummy! The next day I warmed some of the relish up and served it over a baked brie cheese with crackers. It was a hit! :-)

I used unsweetened cranberry juice and found this relish to be the perfect combination of tart and sweet. I did have to cook mine significantly longer and the berries never "popped." Everyone enjoyed this dish.

this was good, but not outstanding. i think it needs more orange, so maybe next time i'll double the zest called for. i did add toasted pecans, which helped somewhat. it was a very pretty dish

This was very simple but elegant and delicious. I didn't have cranberry juice so I substituted Chambord (raspberry liquer) for half the amount of the cranberry juice that was called for. The flavor was so delicious, I will always do this.
