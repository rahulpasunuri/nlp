This is a family favorite. I make it about once a month. I roast a chicken (using the fail-proof beer can method) and cut back on the butter when I prepare the almonds. I have substituted olive oil for the butter and it works well. The key is good quality spanish paprika and manchego cheese. You won't be disappointed.

Wow! I didn't have the roasted red peppers, but I will definitely make this again. Easy, fast, and really unique - not to mention delicious. Do make an effort to find the Spanish paprika. There is "hot" and "sweet", I used the sweet. Regular/ Hungarian paprika, although wonderful in its own way, just isn't as flavorful.

I make this recipe at least once a month. It's delicious! I usually grill a couple of small chicken breast and cut the chicken into the salad. Frisee isn't necessary. Last night I used romaine, treviso and endive. I also add some smoked paprika to the dressing. Next time I am going to try some chorizo that another reviewer suggested. Yum!

I love this salad and have made it dozens of times, always to rave reviews. I don't buy cooked chicken, but instead just buy 2 breasts and bake them (with some olive oil, salt and pepper) in the oven (350 for about 30 minutes) and then shred off the bone. You can also use any salad greens you want -- it's always delicious.

Nuts Only: 1 T butter seemed more than enough for a full cup of nuts but then needed a generous tablespoon of pimenton (sweet) and lots of salt. Quite good, verging on very good.

delich! i used goya adobe seasoning because i didn't have the special spice. I used red vinegar. I added pieces of chorizo...mmm, yummy! Really easy and very yummy. Maybe next time I would crush the almonds to make it stick to the salad more. Almonds not easy to eat with a fork in salad.

A simple and fabulous twist on the standard chicken with greens combo. The smoked paprika, manchego and peppers give this a smoky, spicy, Spanish flair. I used mixed greens vs. frisee and the results were terrific.
