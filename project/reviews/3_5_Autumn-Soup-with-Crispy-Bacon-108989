This was delicious and very easy to make. I included a yukon gold potato and a parsnip in addition to the sweet potatos and rutabaga. I used others suggestions and used stock instead of water, and I added cream at the end. I will definitely make this again.

This was okay. I added chicken stock to make it "soup" but the bacon was overwhelming. I will not use this recipe again.

I can't believe how easy this was and how delicious it turned out! Few modifications - threw in one Idaho potato along with the rutabaga and sweet potatoes, and used 4 cups of chicken broth + 1 cup water as the base. Didn't need to add salt. Served with chewy whole wheat baguette - perfect!

Very good, and I am especially fond of rutabagas. I used the chicken broth, a couple of white potatoes and stirred cream in at the end. I also pureed only about half of the soup and added it right back to the lumpy stuff. Great texture and preserves some of the individual flavors. I recommend it.

This was easy to make, but the taste didn't suit me. The soup was a little too sweet for my liking.

Yummy and easy; have made three times. Since we don't eat red meat, we substituted turkey bacon. The soup had a very strong bacon flavor but was quite delicious. We didn't add cream (or any dairy) or use chicken broth instead of water. Our kids loved it too; will definitely make again and again.

This was very good. I wasn't so sure if I was going to like it once I started cooking. I used chicken broth and cream and believe they are necessary. I also feel that the bacon served on top really made it.

Delicious! I used the comments from other cooks and included both chicken broth and a little cream in my recipe. Also included the potato and turnip. Just before serving, I added a dollop of sour cream to each bowl and then sprinkled the bacon on. Loved it. My sister went back for seconds. Freezed the leftovers for later.

I couldn't find rutabaga in my market - I guess it's the wrong time of the year, so I used yellow turnip as this was suggested to be close by the Epicurious Dictionary. I used low-salt bacon wich left the soup needing salt. Overall, it was a nice soup that is just too easy and straight forward to not try to make again. I'll keep my eyes out for rutabaga but the turnip was pretty good.

It was delicious! I added cream just before serving and ommitted the bacon. It made the flavors a bit richer. I used chicken broth instead of water.

This is a great soup! I also added a small potato and turnip. Additionally, I used chicken broth instead of water,to just cover the vegetables. Lovely refreshing taste.
