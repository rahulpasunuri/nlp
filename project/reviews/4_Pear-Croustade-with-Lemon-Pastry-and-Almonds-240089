This is an easy but very, very impressive dessert-it looked wonderful and tasted even better. The lemon and almonds add a nice touch to the creamy pears. I used only conference pears but otherwise followed the directions exactly. I fdredged a bit of icing (confectioners) sugar around the edges before serving and served up some vanilla ice cream too. I think this crust would also work well with apples, appricots, plumbs, etc. Will definitely keep this one as a standard.

I made this recipe earlier this week with pears we had received as a gift. Although my finished product didn't look anything like the photo on the website, it was very, very tasty! I used whole wheat flour and raw sugar. Cut the sugar to 2 TB since the pears were so ripe. Still absolutely wonderful taste. So for a party tonight, I substituted the regular AP flour with gluten free flour due to diet restrictions of our friends. The pastry didn't perform as nicely as with regular AP flour or whole wheat flour. So I'll stick with standard flour when I make this again.

I have made this croustade 3 times. Every time the dish comes out beautiful and tasty and I get rave reviews. Generally, I make it according to the recipe, however, I have made a few changes. First, I always add 1-2 TBS of pear brandy to the fruit mixture. Really compliments the fruit. When I made the dish for Thanksgiving, I used half pears and half cranberries. The cranberries were sauteed in 2 TBS of butter until shiny, then I added 6 TBS of maple syrup and 1 tsp cinnamon. I cooked them until most of the liquid was absorbed but they still held their shape. I added these to the freshly cut pears. Wow, beautiful and tasty! You can not go wrong with this dish!

Love this recipe, not too much work but it comes out looking pretty fancy, I like adding something a bit more tart to the pears, either rasberries or cranberries.

One of my all-time favorites. The brightness of the lemon really elevates the flavor of the pear, and the nutmeg is just right (though I bet cardamom would also be excellent). The crust is easy, so flavorful, and pretty, especially with almonds.

Delicious. Definitely use the parchment paper or foil as some of the filing leaked through a crack and burned on my baking sheet.

Excellent recipe. The flavors in the dough and filling are perfect. I would like to experiment with other fruit like berries in the middle. I hate baking, but I make this recipe at least once per year. Looks impressive, too!

This was wonderful. I grated fresh nutmeg so this flavor came through more specifically with the pears. I made a vanilla cardamom ice cream to serve with it and the flavors together were perfect.

To the right of the recipe the listing of ingredients has egg. I can't find egg in the recipe. The reason I noticed is I have chickens and am always looking for ways to use more eggs!

One of my all time favorite recipes. I use much less sugar (two tablespoon of sugar for the filling at the most), but otherwise, it is a perfect recipe. Easy and quick to make, looks impressive and has a wonderfully rewarding flavor. I have made it with apples, with and without almonds, sometimes used a combination of sour cream and milk when I was out of whipping cream, but it always disappeared within minutes - and usually by much less than 8 people. After making this many times, I have to say, though, that sticking to the almonds is worth it, it gives an amazing flavor to it and a nice crunch.

This is the easiest and possibly most delicious pie I've ever baked! I had a roll-out pie crust in the freezer so I skipped the pastry. There were no almonds on hand, so I brushed the folded-over crust with egg wash (1 egg beaten with 1 tbsp water). It came out shiny and golden brown. Lovely! Everyone begged for the recipe.

Probably one of the best pies I've ever made! I love the crust--the cream and the lemon zest make it special. I will try the crust with other fillings. I doubled the recipe making the croustade and also a bunch of tarts in mini pie pans. Also, my mistake was that I froze the crust rolled out and didn't allow it to thaw when I folded the edges, causing them to crack rather than fold.

This a wonderful recipe. I love the subtle lemon and how it highlights the pears. The sliced almonds give it a wonderful presentation. I will definitely be making it again.

This recipe is such a gem. It's easy and quick to make, and the result is really impressive to serve and equally delicious to taste. I've made it numerous times and it always gets wolfed down moments after it's pulled from the oven. I've made it with apples, but I always come back to the pears.

I made it for company and everyone liked it. The crust was much easier to make than a pie shell. I will make it again!

Fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly, and also sprinkled some coarse sugar on top of the pears before baking. This was definitely a hit.

I've made this pie many times this fall and winter and it always turns out delicious. A favorite variation is with tart apples from the farmers market and a little cardamom.

This was a great dessert. I substituted non-fat half and half for whipping cream, which didn't seem to make a difference. I thought 5 tablespoons of sugar sounded a bit much so I reduced it down to 3 tablespoons and it still tasted great.

Love this recipe! So much better than making a pie from scratch because the crust was so simple (especially since I used a pie bag to roll it out). I took the suggestion too of using brown sugar instead of white in the filling. I also did not have any almonds handy, so I toasted a 1/2 cup of walnuts, chopped them up, and tossed them in the filling instead. And because of that I changed the lemon juice to dark rum (still kept the lemon peel though). It came out absolutely delicious. I will definitely be making this again.

This tart was enjoyed by all and the leftovers were eaten by lunch time the next day! If you have diners that think they do not like pears let them think it is made with apples. Two teens commented on how delicious the apple tart was, they were told it was pear, but I don't know if they would have helped themselves to it without asking if they had thought it was pear!

The dough for this was yummy! The lemon peel made a bright addition. It would work great with any fruit. I forgot to put the almonds on the crust-but it didn't seem to lack anything.

I made this tart (two of them) for a dinner party--in my usual "this sounds good--I'll pray it works" mode. They were beautiful and wonderful...everyone loved it!!! This recipe will be a definite "go to".

Delicious, light dessert with simple yet somehow complex flavors. The tart lemon in the flaky pastry crust was a nice compliment to the delicate pear filling. The almonds added another dimension to the flavor, which was really nice. The crust was the real stand out. I will use that again, and change up the filling.

This was delicious, with a nice pear and lemon flavor. I used whole milk instead of cream in the crust, and it came out fine. In the filling, I used brown sugar instead of white and upped the flour to 2.5 tbsp since my pears were a little riper than I would have liked. I also threw in about 1/3 cup of dried sour cherries, and they plumped up nicely from the pear juice. It was done in 50 minutes, and everyone liked it.

This is a HIT! I made it for my contribution to Thanksgiving dinner @ friends house. But - of course I had to make it my own. I didn't have 2 kinds of pears - I used 2/3 pears & 1/3 apples. I also added fresh cranberries - I par cooked them first but that my not be necessary. I cheated on the pie crust because I just don't have the touch - I used prepackaged - rolled it out & put the grated lemon rind ( from my own Meyer potted lemon tree - into the crust. The "tart" was beautiful to behold & delicious. This is a keeper. - oh yes, I added nutmeg, cinnamon & a touch of cardamon.

Sorry, this just doesn't have a wow factor. The flavors were too subtle for my taste. It did look good and smell good but there were no comments from dinner party of 8. Definitely would not make it again.

I've made this twice now and it's always lovely. I added a little bit of cinnamon this time and it was also very nice. If you're a cinnamon fan like I am I would say try it!

I loved this dessert! It was rather easy and had a wonderful lemony flavor with just the right amount of sweetness next to the pears. The crust was flaky and delicate. I also thought it was fairly easy. I added a few blueberries to pop an unexpected color and sweetness next to the pears. The presentation was wonderful! Will make for my next book club. Enjoy!

DIVINE is the only word to describe this dessert. Absolutely gourmet in flavor. Made the recipe exact but may try subbing some whole wheat flour next time to increase the nutritionals. Have made twice!

I'm still new to making pastry so I was a bit apprehensive about making this even though it sounded easy enough. I had a problem with my butter not being cold enough so when combined with the flour, it didn't really crumble. I could see pieces of butter when I rolled out my pastry. The pieces melted while in the oven and made a bit of a mess in the pan, but the croustade was not worse for the wear. I did have to add more cream to keep the pastry from being too crumbly. The taste was great and it looked nice and rustic. For some reason, my pears turned slightly brown after it came out of the oven even with the addition of the lemon juice, but it wasn't a big deal. Overall it was yummy and I'd make it again.

This was absolutely delicious! The pastry is very flaky with a wonderful lemon flavor. I also made with 'honey crisp' apples with a touch of cinnamon and it was equally good.

Really delicious and fairly easy to make. Looks impressive, too. I swapped out some whole wheat pastry flour for some of the AP, and it gave the crust a nice earthy flavor that went well with the pears. I think I sliced my pears too thinly, though, because my filling was almost a chunky pear sauce. Still, it was yummy. A lovely seasonal dessert.

BEST pear dessert I've ever made and I've made a lot of them since pears are a favorite. I used 1/2 cup whole wheat pastry flour in the curst and substituted Grand Marnier for the lemon juice - SUPERB

This was relatively fool-proof to make, although the almonds did burn easily. However, something is lacking in the flavor. Maybe next time I'll use brown sugar instead of white to add a little richness.

I have very little experience with pastry, but I couldn't resist this one. The beauty of this tart is that it was was sooo easy, but it looked as if I spent hours on it. The flavor of this tart is subtle. Since I'm a gal who would choose to eat shortbread over brownies, I loved it.
