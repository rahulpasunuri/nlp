Surprisingly, this lacked flavor. I love porcini and think it is usually an intense flavor, but it was lost in the potatoes. That said, it was a "light" dish, so it is a recipe that tries to shortcut the fat in mashed potatoes. Also, it was meant as originally written, to complement a spiced filet recipe. I made them both together. When I ate the spicy filet and flavorful sauce along with the potatoes, I thought the pairing was very good. So, as a foil it works; alone, it's rather bland!

I made this last night. The potatoes turn brown, not gray, and I think they looked fine. I used butter instead of olive oil, and the mix of butter and yogurt blended nicely with the earthiness of the porcini mushrooms. I suggest using Yukon Golds, as they are a little firmer and yellower than russets. The color and texture and flavor were perfect.

Disgusting. If I could give a negative fork rating, I would. The liquid from the mushrooms turned the potatoes GRAY. They looked awful, and didn't taste like much either. If you are looking for a special mashed potato recipe for the holidays - keep looking. This is definitely NOT it.
