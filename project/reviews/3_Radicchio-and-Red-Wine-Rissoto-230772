This was a really easy rissoto that tasted really sophisticated. I saved the water I used to cook the radicchio with and used that in place of the plain water. I think it made the taste stronger. But, it wasn't too strong of a flavor overall - even my 17 month-old daughter devoured it!! And I was thrilled to find something to do with the radicchio I got in my CSA!

I very much enjoyed the recipe. Because we had leg of lamb I think the red wine and radicchio risotto went very well with it. It took every minute of the 18 minutes to finally reduce to aldente but still creamy. I wouldn't change a thing if I made again.

This risotto was ok. A few points: don't overcook the radicchio, and be careful which wine you use -- something hearty but not tangy is advisable if you use this as a side dish to meet. That said, I wouldn't make this again; the radicchio alone isn't really enough to make a risotto.
