Oh, just to add to my review above...i didn't use sourdough. I used pre-seasoned stuffing bread from my local grocer. Worked much better than sourdough and very easy to find during the holidays.

Awesome recipe!! I made a few minor changes; I only used one fennel bulb (cored and white parts only) and added celery as no stuffing of this variety should go without celery. I also used medium Italian sausage as most of my guests prefer life on the spicier side ;-) My guy's brother comes to dinner every year just for this stuffing and asks for a doggie bag! You won't go wrong with this recipe. It has become a staple in my recipe book. Completely amaing with turkey or pork. Enjoy!

Delicious! I mostly only use Stuffing recipes as inspiration. Had never made one with pears instead of apples. I also used leeks. The sourdough bread gave it a nice taste too.

Love this recipe! Have made it several Thanksgivings now, and it is always a hit. I've made other stuffings as well, but this is the one I keep coming back to.

I did not really care for the pears. There is a dressing recipe that uses artichokes and parmesan that we like better.

This stuffing is outstanding...it's time consuming, but definitely worth the work.

Maybe I did something wrong but this was not great. It also made a ton of stuffing-most went into the trash!

I always thought my Mom's stuffing was the best, but since I tried this recipe three years ago, it's become the absolute favourite of friends and family.

Phenomenal! My company from last year called ahead to make sure that the same stuffing would be on the table this Thanksgiving. I used hot Italian sausage instead of sweet and there was not a bite left. I prefer it with the hot over the sweet, though both get highest reviews.

This dish became a staple for my household in 1999 when I first saw the recipe in Bon Appetit. And, not just a staple for my family, but for everyone who has ever been invited to our house for Thanksgiving. It is simply the best stuffing recipe I have ever encountered. A bit time consuming, but it is completely worth it. The only change I made is using hot Italian sausage vs. sweet. Everything else is absolutely PERFECT!!!

This dressing became a staple as of November 26 2002. I used sweet turkey sausage, and a 12 grain bread instead of sourdough. I chose red and yellow bell pepper. The outcome was a dressing so beautiful in color and texture that people actually stopped to admire it. Next year I'll serve it in a cut glass bowl.

This has become a family tradition. Using a food processor for everything but the bread and pears not only makes the recipe easier but it allows all the flavors to come through in every bite. It's really wonderful.

I used only one Fennel Bulb and substituted celery for the second Bulb. Increased Fennel seeds to about 3 Tablespoons. Used two whole loaves of sour dough and added portobello mushrooms, omitting the pears. A huge hit. This stuffing will now become our family staple. Be sure to add a substantial amount of chicken stock to stuffing that is being cooked in a separate pan. I did and it turned out beautifully!

I found the sausage in this stuffing to be overpowering. We did a test run of Thanksgiving, and prepared this stuffing with the turkey with pan shallot gravy recipe (also on Epicurious). The gravy from the turkey helped tone down the sausage flavor. If you want to try something new for Thanksgiving, this would be a good bet. If you prefer your Thanksgiving to be a little more traditional, I would not recommend this recipe.

Excellent. I skipped the pears, as I do not like fruit in my stuffing. The fennel added so much taste! Made day before and added some extra broth and butter right before baking.

Fabulous recipe! I made it for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit. Its supposed to serve twelve; but we only had one serving left over because everyone kept going back for more! This will definitely be part of our Thanksgiving menu from now on.

Outstanding recipe! We are not red pepper fans, instead of substituting something else we just left 'em out. Otherwise didn't change a thing, and have made this recipe several times (even made it once in the heat of summer to satisfy a craving!)

I made this recipe last year as a first-time Thanksgiving cook. It was a smashing success. The fennel adds a little, unexpected kick that everyone appreciated. I think we've discovered a new family menu tradition!

We made this as a side dressing for our Thanksgiving turkey last year, and it was a huge hit with the entire family. Everyone was asking to take home leftovers. From now on, it will be a traditional part of our Thanksgiving dinner.

I scaled down the recipe, substituted tart apple for the pear and used the stuffing for two game hens. Results were superb! I just harvested my fennel bulbs today from my herb garden. Wanted to make the recipe again, but too lazy to leaf through back issues of Bon Appetit, I searched through epicurious.com and found the recipe! Thanks.
