Mixed review on this one. I found the turmeric and cumin too strong, and not a complimentary flavour for the lamb. My fiance on the other hand quite liked. Unlikely to cook again.

Delish. Used more turmeric than in the recipe, and used pearl barley. Did not rinse, just let the barley absorb the water. Added extra cumin, mint, onion, some pepper.

Quite hearty and tangy. Very nice, but cumin seeds were a bit overpowering. I used only 1/8 cup of mint and mostly cilantro. I would use a little less cumin or more mint to balance the flavor.

Liked this very much - good alternative to all the potatoes and rice!

I make this and the lamb and cherry tomatoes quite often - it can be scaled up or down, and it makes as nice a simple dinner as it does a dinner party with Mediterranean accompaniments - I do homemade hummus and pita, and some olives with a nice, dry red wine. If you can, use Meyer lemons for the lemon juice in this dish - a real treat!

I made this EXACTLY as written to accompany the grilled lamb which recommends this as a side. It was very good on it's own merits, but was a superb partner for the lamb. Served it to a group of 14, all were pleased.

So good! I couldn't find the turmeric and I had to use powdered cumin, but this was so delicious. I will definitely make again.

This went great with the lamb. The lemon juice brought the flavours together nicely.I used a smaller amount of dried mint that I mixed with the other ingredients first. I think it turns out better than using fresh mint.

Ok, so I cheated and changed the recipe. I didn't have fresh mint, so I used cilantro - and only about 2 tablespoons. I used Ground cumin and added a little more than called for. It was very tasty and the perfect accompaniment for the lamb - I was nervous serving barley for the first time to my inlaws, but everyone seemed to enjoy.

I had high hopes for this one, but I was very disappointed. It was okay, but not enough to make it again. The blend of tastes was not smooth.

A quick side-dish, but rather ho hum.

We didn't care for this one. Couldn't get quick cooking barley. Don't know if that makes a difference. The lamb was great

Thanks so much for the responses to my question about the barley. I was going to give up on it and try the recipe with bulgur, which I'm sure would have worked as a substitute, but I'm glad I came back to check the 'reviews' - now I can try the recipe as is. Thanks again for taking the time to respond.

I live in Madison, WI. You can buy quick barley lots of places. I've gotten it at Whole Foods (on the shelf, not in the bulk bins) and at Woodman's.

To the cook from Madison, use the pearl barley (found in bags along with dried beans in any supermarket) and cook according to the package - I usually use more liquid than the package says and drain the barley like pasta. I use pearl barley for many barley salads and they work just fine.

Unlike the other review - I went heavy on the cumin and the tumeric when cooking the barley - this is definitely a "keeper". The lamb and tomato part, was just fine, no more special than any other marinade.

This dish went perfectly with the grilled lamb chops featured on the monthly Low Fat menu. I did leave out the cumin by accident. We all agreed it had a delicate flavor that complimented the lamb chops. Looks great too.
