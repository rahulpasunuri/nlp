Awesome dish! We used fresh french radish from our garden and found that we needed nearly all the radish greens that came on the 18 radish rather than just the 20 leaves they recommended. We used canned chipotles in adobo sauce and didn't need much. We used chicken breast instead of thighs and found this towork great too.

i can't believe this recipe only has 3 forks, but maybe our modifications made all the difference. we used flank steak and beef stock instead of chicken, flour tortillas instead of corn, and local bi-color sweet corn (cut from the cob) on the side. it was super easy to make and fast, too. a good one for after work - a quick trip to the market and a little chopping and your 90% there!

I could not believe I didn't like this recipe! I was pretty disappointed when I served this for dinner on a beautiful summer evening with ingredients right out of my garden. I thought, "well, maybe the leftovers will be better." They weren't: the meal went from nondescript to bad. If I was forced to make this again for some crazy reason, I would use chicken breast instead thighs. The dark meat is too heavy for these ingredients. Likewise, while I am a huge fan of corn tortillas, they too are too heavy -- their flavor is distracting.

I shredded the chicken after done and let it mix with the chipotle sauce over low heath. Then I made tacos using the shredded chicken, avocado, tomato slices and a little bit of iceberg letuce. Delicious!

I made this recipe using a chipotle pepper from a can of chipotles in adobo sauce and added a bit of the adobo sauce to the chicken mixture. We have rather an abundance of radishes at the moment so it was good to find an interesting way to use some of them. I liked the recipe because its unusal to find a recipe that uses cooked radishes.

This was a very fast very satisfying meal to make. I added avacados to the side and it was really delicious. I have made it several times since then.
