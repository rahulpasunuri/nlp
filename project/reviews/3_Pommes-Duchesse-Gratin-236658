Re: Davis and Danville, Glad you tried this classic. As a Chef I would like to take this a step further, Pommes Duchesse in the culinary field is often reffered to as Appareil Duchesse. It is often used in catering or applications where little prep time is needed in the end. You can prepare them the day befor, a starch... Appareil Means Prepared in Advance fr., the twice baked potato is a utilization item of the peel, and was invented form Pommes Duchesse. Adjust this recipe with anything that goes with potatoes. It also holds nicely in a rough cassirole style dish this recipe is a foundation, your the cook

Got to agree with Danville. Why do we bother with roasting russets? This was just another fluffy potato dish that was unnecessarily complicated. And the taste? Kind of dull. Guests used the sauce from the accompanying prime rib on the potatoes. They liked that. I suggest just making your own favorite plain old mashers instead of this.

This recipe was great! I doubled it and served it along side a beef dish to 18 people. I did not bake the potatoes but boiled white rose potatoes instead. I also did not have a ricer but simply mashed and then lightly beat the potatoes with my hand mixer. This is a great make ahead dish and it got rave reviews. I plan to make it again for Christmas.

These are light and fluffy, but not so different in taste from a regular potato that it was worth the extra effort. Also, you need to do something with the skins. I ended up putting the gratin back in the skins and baking them that way - rather like a twice baked potato, although the skins got a little tough with the long time of extra baking. Next time, I would add a few more ingredients to the gratin - maybe bacon, chives, parsley, mushrooms, whatever. If I added bacon, though, I'd skip the garlic.
