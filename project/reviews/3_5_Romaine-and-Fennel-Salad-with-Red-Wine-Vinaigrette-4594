Excellent salad! Added thinly sliced yellow pepper for colour. Will make this again.

makes too much dressing. reduce the amount. i added a bit of lemon juice to add a bit of a bite, as i prefer more tang in my salad dressings than what this recipe calls for. make certain to slice your fennel thin -- makes a big difference. overall, a good salad. fresh, crisp. nice in early summer.

Added sliced radishes which provided great color, flavor, and texture. A little too much dressing if you use all of it but otherwise, delicious (and we're not big fennel fans).

I've made this three times, exactly as written, and my family loves it. It is quick to make, too.

this was delicious! Light, tasty and easy to make. Definitely a keeper.

We had some fresh fennel and wanted to include it in our dinner salad. This recipe exceeded our expectations. We think that "thinly sliced fennel" and top quality Parmesan cheese made this one so delicious, so easy, and thus a "true keeper"
