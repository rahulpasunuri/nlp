Everyone is still talking about how delicious this is! I skipped the squash and roasted peppers and added steamed redskin potatoes and hard boiled eggs. A winner!

Here's the great thing about this recipe: Every bite is different. Lettuce, green bean, shrimp. Tomato, scallop, squash, tuna. I mean, do the math, as they say. There are so many different bites to put on the fork, and they are all good. The dressing is excellent. Chill the plates with the lettuce. Chill the beans and tomatoes. Serve with a nice cool rosé. Have some friends over. Kiss your wife. Be glad the sun came up today.

I thought the dressing was excellent. I did not have all the seafood mentioned I only had tuna. In any case the salad was excellent and I will definitely make it again.

I have never actually made this complete dish, but I use the dressing to make a similar salad with boston lettuce, avocado, green beans, red peppers and salmon fillet on top. I use some of the dressing as the marinade for the salmon as they do in this one and the rest on the salad. It's really great and my version is a heck of a lot quicker to make, although some day I'd like to try it word for word.

This is a great recipe. My husband and I both loved it. It wasn't hard to make, but very time consuming. It took me 2.5 hours. Everything has to be handled and prepared - roast red pepper, clean beans, etc. I also added oven roasted potatoes based on other's comments and would delete the yellow squash next time. Dressing recipe is enough for two people and needs to be doubled for each add'l two people. I would make the dressing again as a marinade or for salad. It was delicious. This recipe also presents beautifully. Its as good as any restaurant!

This was great- I doubled the recipe so that it would be a main dish for 5 hearty eaters on a hot day and it was enough- I am so glad I doubled the dressing because it turned out to be exactly enough. Two of my guests called it a mediterranean salad (I guess because of the peppers and the olives). Everyone loved it. The shrimp didn't need to be cooked so long- the timing for everything else was perfect. It took me 4 hours to make- my husband said "Why?", I couldn't think why- it didn't make sense to me either but it did take that long. However I will definitely make it again but prep a bit the day before or that morning.

We doubled the recipe and made it for a group of nine diverse tastes and it got rave reviews! The only change we made was to add steamed broccoli florets. Everyone asked for the recipe!

We loved this recipe. It's great in the summer. everything is grilled. I make twice as much dressing. If you don't you'll run out.

This was excellent! The combination of flavors produced from the variety of seafood and veggies makes every bite different. I'll definitely make this one again. Two suggestions: prepare as much beforehand as possible since this takes plenty of time, and make extra dressing since you use most for grilling.

I make this every summer. It's excellent on a hot day -- and very easy to vary the kinds of shellfish in the recipe.
