I made the mocha sauce according to the exact recipe, and I thought it was delicious. I will keep the recipe as a staple mocha sauce. I attempted to make smaller snowballs as suggested, but I made a mess of that. Toasting the coconut is a must. Overall, very tasty dessert.

These were amazing! A perfect weeknight dessert, because they were so incredibly easy to make. Definitely toast the coconut first. I made a basic chocolate sauce to go with the snowballs, and thought it complemented the coconut and the ice cream perfectly. I also used a mellon-baller to make several smaller snowballs instead of fewer large ones - they were so elegant that I would happily use this recipe for entertaining.

very easy and a great make ahead dessert. I added toasted pecans as well to the ice cream balls. Very rich , though!

I made this recipe for a dinner party about 7 years ago, and it was a big success. The sauce was very easy and quick to make and I had the frozen snowballs in the freezer beforehand. Everyone was very impressed! I served these in large bulbous wine glasses, and it was very pretty! I had something like these at the Polo Club in West Palm Beach, FL and they call them polo balls there, and I loved them.
