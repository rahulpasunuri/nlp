Really really (really, really, really) needed some butter -- if only a couple tablespoons. I also skipped pepper but added about 6 more cloves of garlic. Still could use some salt, too. But we had GREAT fresh mussels and they were super.

Of all the great recipes for mussels on Epicurious, this is by far the simplest. And there's no added fat. A fine first course, and with the "pommes frites," a main course reminiscent of those days in France.

The basic recipe is fine - as shown. Don't know about serving fries. However, married to a shellfisherman for many years I will pass on a tip from a man who should know. Immediately after picking or buying mussels add a handful of plain white flour toa bowl of salted water, tip in the mussels (don't beard or scrape yet) and leave for several hours or overnight. The mussels will imbibe the mixture and in doing so will rid themselves of any mud, sand or other detritus - and, would you believe it, plump themselves up ready for the pan. (Beard and scrape, of course first, but only then.) JJ

To the cook in Kalamazoo: this recipe is very close to the classic Moules Frites that you get in Paris. The only difference is that there is usually some pressed garlic and minced shallots in the sauce and often a half cup of crème fraîche swirled into the sauce. Moules Frites does indeed mean Mussels with Fries, but nevertheless this is the usual way to serve them. I'm with you - don't care if they are a working class dish as they are delicious!

I was born and raised in Paris and mussells were on our menu quite often and there were never enough of them. I never made this recipe but I will try it. My dear mother used to boil the mussells in salted water and once cooked would take these out of the shells. She would then put a little bit of olive oil in a skillet, add diced onions and garlic to taste to the mussells as well as parsley and small croutons made out of fresh bread and would cook these stirring until the bread became golden. This recipe was one of my favorite. I dare you to try it.

I haven't made this exact recipe, this is just a comment for the "moules frites" lover...agreed! They are wonderful but the name just means mussels and fries. You can (and most places do) use any sauce you want with it, so it's really all about personal preference. If it's a tomato based sauce you like, just add a couple of chopped tomatoes and thier juices to this recipe. Also, saute some garlic and shallots just before adding the mussels! But unfortunately, moules frites is not an exact science!

Doubled this for a fantastic supper dish with roasted red potatoes and lots of crusty bread for 8. It is on the "to do again" list.

I haven't made this recipe yet, but I intend to try. Please, anyone: what I am really looking for is something I ate in France called "moules frites." It's just mussels in this delicious sauce with fries on the side. What is in the sauce? My sister, who lives in France, poo-poohs moules frites as street food, but I loved them and I have thought about them like a lost lover, it's ridiculous. If someone has a recipe for them, I'd be so happy.

Personaly, I add a stick of celery, one onion and a carrot + wild thyme ... It is better to let the mussels in salted water (like seawater 1gr/litre) with a tablespoon of floor during 2 hours.

I have also eaten this in France(in Burgundy) with about a tablespoon of cream added to the sauce.
