No wow factor for me either. Everyone liked it but no one asked for seconds or even commented much on it. And I used Valrhona chocolate... And it was perfectly cooked etc.

I was able to make this cake using some all purpose gluten-free flour and still have it taste wonderful. I have made it several times.

I ran short of dried cherries and so mixed in chopped dried apricots (the tart slab-dried kind), and the combination of cherries and apricots was heavenly with the chocolate!

This was delicious! And the entire recipe is made in 1 bowl plus one saucepot! Made it exactly as stated, with Scharffen Berger chocolate. Next time, however, I would use slightly less sugar as I thought it was a bit too sweet.I will definitely make it again.

I have made this a few times now, and it has always turned out excellent! I believe a bittersweet chocolate of at about 60-65% works best with this recipe. I also think that a dark chocolate sauce with a hint of chili would be excellent served on the side.

This turned out really well. I used Lindt bittersweet chocolate and Chamborg instead of eau de vie. This will become a staple at my house.

I have made this cake three times for small dinnner parties and it always gets raves. Last night I used dried unsweetened Bing cherries, and Chambord for the liqueur, with bittersweet chocolate. I added an extra teaspoon of vanilla. It was the best ever. A great standby when you need an elegant dessert without spending hours on it.

This is a fine cake but not extraordinary. Much depends on the quality of the chocolate. I prefer Scharffen Berger 62% semisweet.

Excellent. I made this for friends several years ago and they still talk about it. Its elegant simplicity is a breath of fresh air these days. Agree with the poster that Trader Joe's dried Montmorency cherries are great in this one.

This was an excellent find for a dessert on a whim! I used a little more chocolate, an 8oz bag of Trader Joe's Dried Tart Montgomery Cherries, and plumped the cherries as recommended but with Kirsch. I baked it at slightly under 350 for 30 minutes - turned out great!

The combination of the tart cherries and the rich chocolate was great. However, the cake didn't wow me.

This was a simple and tasty recipe. It's not too sweet but very tasty. I wasn't able to find tart cherries so I just used dried bing cherries and it tasted fine. Also, I misread the instructions initially and put parchement paper all the way up the sides of the cake pan. Don't make the same mistake I did! Just cover the bottom with paper.

I made this for my boss' birthday, and it was a success! Elegant, simple, and (very important)highly portable via mass transit.

I made this with Chambord and served it with chambord whipped cream. I liked how easy it was to make, but did not think it was anything special.

I hope someone can tell me what I did wrong....the flavor was excellent but it looked like a brownie instead of a cake. It actually would have made good brownies maybe that's what I'll do with it next time.

Though it was slightly crumbly around the edges, the cake was moist and fudgy inside. The chocolate (I used Callebaut bittersweet) and plumped tart cherries were a delicious combination, and the cake was a snap to make and stayed moist for a few days. I agree that semisweet chocolate would make too sweet a cake. A springform pan worked fine.

Very rich and moist. The cherries must be tart to counter the sweetness/richness of the rest of the cake. We used bittersweet chocolate and feel very strongly that using semi-sweet would have been a big mistake. Usually we do not like cherries except for fresh fruit. This was a delightful surprise!

This cake is easy and quick to bake. Its size and ease of baking make it a good choice for a small dinner or birthday party. It has an excellent and sophisticated flavor and looks pretty on a cake stand with the powdered sugar, or not (I've made it both ways this month). Highly-recommended.
