Made it with olive oil, blood-orange- carrot juice and apple vinegar. Was very easy to make and came out very well - soft, not too dark or sweet, with an interesting flavour. It needed 25 min to bake because I used a tube pan.

I made this cake for the start of Yom Kippor fast. I did have the amount of powdered ginger as suggested. I did add diced crystallized ginger in the cake and that was a big hit. A new non-dairy favorite in my house!!

I found that the cake looked great, but the texture was very dry slightly better the following day. Very yummy with a Ginger Rum syrup socked through it.

I used OJ instead of apple juice, baked it only 25 minutes and it was extremely dry. Not sure if the apple juice makes a difference, but certainly won't try again.

This is a very moist and quick cake. I would use less ginger next time and more coco powder. My 10 month old ate an entire slice of this cake.

The ginger in this dish gives it a somewhat...Oriental taste, but still keeps the essence of the chocolate. Makes a very good dessert.

O.K., not great.

I made this in a heart-shaped pan and it made the perfect no-guilt dessert, along with some vanilla frozen yogurt of course.

The chocolate, ginger and apple flavoring were very interesting -- and no eggs! Next time I will cut back on the ginger -- it overpowered the chocolate.
