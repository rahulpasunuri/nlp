the salsa makes this dish! i used frozen mango sweetened with a teaspoon of sugar, and omitted the chili so my kids could eat it too. they gobbled it all up and asked for more. the salsa would be delicious with any kind of fish or chicken. this recipe is now a regular in our weeknight rotation.

brilliant dish. super easy. i added baby heirloom tomatoes and substituted 1/2 of a jalapeno instead of a serrano pepper. i made this indoors so i broiled the salmon instead of bbqing it. i would definitely make this again!

Very easy recipe, allow some time for chopping. I used less onion and less chili as we don't like spicy. Liked the serving idea so sauteed onion with leftover brown rice and added toasted cumin seeds, grilled zuke with the fish and cooked some black beans. Very nice meal.

Made this for a bbq and everyone loved the combination. I didn't add as much cilantro and serrano chili.

Wonderful recipe worth doing again. I used a skin on fillet and bbqed it so the presentation is nice for a dinner party. Double the salsa recipe it's great. Use very ripe mangoes only. I made it with Pilaf with pistachios and raisin recipe from this site and grilled asparagus.

Made this for Mother's Day and it was delicious. Didn't add so much serrano chili. This is a keeper.

This is a wonderful, delicious and fast recipe. Even great for week nights. What I found important to the success of this dish is that you purchase really fresh fish and a juicy mango. If the mango is not ripe and juicy, the salsa is not nearly as good. I've also used sea bass when I could not find salmon.

Rating: 3
Very nice salsa. I skipped the olive oil and did 3T lime juice. Could do without the garlic, and will use more chili next time (unless it is hotter pepper) otherwise it was really good. The salmon was rubbed with cajun seasoning and sauted in grapeseed oil instead of the plain version of recipe, this went well with the salsa. Will definitely make again, may try with halibut or pork next time.

I added chopped red bell pepper to the salsa. It was wonderful on grilled salmon and even better the next night with grilled sea bass. Grilling 5 minutes per side was perfect for both fish. This recipe just says SUMMER and is a keeper!!

Delish! The cook who thought it was dull must have used too little serrano! I've made this several times with mango and pineapple and both are great.

I've prepared this recipe many times, and it has always been a great hit. I serve it with lemon risotto (recipe on this site) and grilled vegetable. I prepare the salsa in the morning to let all the flavors develop. This is spectacular!

Okay but very boring, run of the mill....I bet it would be much zingier with pineapple!

Love this recipe and have served it several times with five - six fresh Atlantic salmon steaks using a Blackened Salmon recipe. Doubled the salsa recipe and have substituted jalepeno peppers for the serrano, which are hard to find here. The salsa helps to calm down the heat of the salmon and is a great complement. Very delicious and so healthy, too!

Amazing! Served with Zucchini and golden raisin pistachio pilaf. It was a big hit. I've never liked salmon so much.

Rating: 0
We would give this a 5 star if we could. Doubled the recipe except for the Serrano. We have some who can't handle the heat [they still get in the kitchen from time to time] so halving the chili made it tolerable and enjoyable for them. Will ABSOLUTELY keep this salsa in our repertoire.

Rating: 4
For my wife and I, Salmon has to be fresh and cooked just right for us to ea t it, and we do for our health. I gave this recipe 4 stars for 2 reasons. The salsa masks the salmon oily taste and also has wonderful color presentation when plated with the grillrd salmon. I only change one thing and that was to rub the salmon with ground dried California Chile (has no heat but adds a smokey flavor and rich dark red color) along with salt and ground pepper. Have to say this recipe is a keeper.

Rating: 4
This recipe was a huge hit -- so light and fresh. I made it for four people, and upped the serrano (no seeds) and red onion a tad, but still used only the proportions for 2 for the rest of the recipe. Completely omitted the additional olive oil that's added at the end as well. Will make this over and over again all summer long.

So easy and so fresh! This is the perfect dish to make on a hot summer night: full of flavor but doesn't leave you feeling heavy. I added avocado and fresh cilantro, as recommended by other reviewers. I love spicy food and added a few dashes of tabasco to increase the heat. Next time, I'll double the chilies.

Rating: 3
Delicious as is- althoughn a splash of balsamic vinegar on the salmon works beautifully. I also like to roast salmon at high 425 degree oven. BUT why I am writing- if there are no ripe mango, as often is the case- buy a jar of Delmonte( or similar) peeled and sliced (yes-peeled already) completely ripe mangoes. They are always perfect and the remainder will stay fresh for a while. They are found close to the slad bags/ herb packets in refrigerated section of produce and are often much cheaper than buying whole magoes!

Rating: 3
While I do think this dish is tasty, how do you go wrong with mango? You dont' really. So, I say, it's a good dish, but not GREAT. The salmon was pretty plain for me. But the mango salsa was good; the best part of the dish. Omit the garlic and you can use it for just about anything.

Rating: 3
Yummy! I served the salsa alongside salmon cooked with salt (my new favourite way to prepare salmon) - and did not use oil in the salsa or on the fish to make it lower in fat. I added an avocado and made do with dried cilantro - very easy and delicious. My mango-cutting words of wisdom are as follows: Place the mango on the cutting board with the stem pointing up. Make 2 cuts in the mango - one on each side of the pit (there will be about a one-inch "slice" in the middle, with the 2 sides cut off. Score each side with 3-5 lengthwise and 3-5 crosswise cuts to the skin, but not through it. (It will look like a tic-tac-toe board with extra squares.) Turn the mango inside out and you have 9-25 cubes of mango that will pop right off into your bowl. The center slice can be peeled and bits cut off the stone as available, but I prefer to save this bit for myself and eat it over the sink - very messy!

Rating: 3
I had planned on making this recipe exactly as written, however, there was not a ripe mango to be found anywhere. There was, though, an abundance of ripe pineapple. I must say, this was so good, that it will be hard for me to take the chance to make it with mango, fearing that it will not be as good. I am not a big fan of red bell pepper, but would add some for company because the aditional color would be so pretty. Next time I will try it on a different fish, maybe red snapper ....not that I didn't love the salmon, this salsa would be excellent on most any fish.

My boyfriend and I made this dish together and we both agree that it rocks!!! The flavors of the salsa blended well with the salmon. The colors were nice too. This is a five-star restaurant quality dish and a definite keeper.

I added avocado to the salsa, added a great contrast to the chili and mango. Make in the morning to let all the flavors come together.

This recipe is great. Used a blackening spice on the salmon, pan seared and finished in the oven. The mango salsa is amazing, nice and cool with the blackened fish. My take on mango prep (taken from avocado): cut off the bottom of the mango, halve the mango on the sides of the pit. now score each half in a grid pattern, making sure to score all the way to the skin. now scoup the mango meat out of the skin with a spoon. presto, diced mango.

Rating: 4
To cut mangos, slice a bit off the bottom and put a fork in the top. Slice the skin off, top to bottom. Then slice melon off. When you've trimmed up enough, take the remainder and squish through hand for juice and pulp. Loved this recipe as written, just giving tips on mango prep, which can be messy

Rating: 4
This is great. Made the salsa and at 1st taste thought, too much cilantro, too hot (burned my lips) and not enough sweetness. After it sat in the fridge for an hour while we prepared the rest of the menu it became perfection. Another reviewer mentioned they paired this with the Lemon Pilaf recipe from the Cre'me de Colorado cookbook; which turned out to be an awesome combination. Also made that with fat free half&half.

Wow! So very different. Exotic taste! Served it with grilled salmon (salt, pepper, cajun spice and olive oil to coat. Made it twice in 1 week! Only modification was to add diced red peppers which were great both for flavor and look. I find it helps to cut the mango as wedges, then to dice it.

Okay, I am a committed salmon-hater who lives with fish-hater. We now like salmon because this salsa. And the funny thing is that I used pieces of frozen mango, fresh but store bought salsa (just a tablespoon), habanero hot sauce, lime juice, diced onion, with some cayenne. Easy and made us think twice about salmon - definitely impressed all at the table with the presentation. Fabulous!

Rating: 3
Modifications 1. Cajun-seasoned salmon. If you don't have a grill try to sear the salmon in a pan and finish in the oven for a pleasant crust. 2. If you have them on hand, try to add red peppers to the salsa 3. Another option is to add avocado to the salsa When I haven't had lime on hand I have also used champagne vinegar or mango salad dressing for the acid in the salsa. A great summer recipe. Also great on a spinach salad.

WOW! The salsa is delicious! Great recipe, i made a few changes, taking suggestions of other reviewers. I used the spice rub from the spicy grilled salmon with black butter recipe. great flavor and kick. i also marinated the fillet in lime juice, garlic olive oil, and some chili powder. Served with the cumin scented herbed rice, which complemented amazingly well. Washed down with a cold corona and followed by key lime pie, this was an unbelievable meal!

Just right- I added some freshly roasted mild green chilis and jalapeno, and the combination was perfect with the grilled salmon- even the kids slurped down every last bit. This one goes in the file

Rating: 4
This was easy to prepare and wonderfully tasty. I substituted one jalapeno for the serranos, which are tricky to find here; the salsa was so good, my husband and I kept eating it before dinner. It would make a great accompaniment to blue tortilla chips. One tip: I seasoned the fish with a sprinkling of Cajun seasoning and chili powder to boost the flavor, and would prepare it the same way next time. Served with basmati rice and a tomato basil salad and it was filling and delicious.

Buenisimo! I made this and it was SO good. But I put some crushed garlic and adobo on the salmon. The way I served it was also very impressive with the visitors. First I put a bed of lettuce with lime juice, then the salmon and then the DELICIUOS SALSA! Could not beat that!

I've made this dish several times and the only time it failed to impress me was when the salmon I got was of poor quality. Other than that, top notch. A tip for those without a grill (or are too lazy to drag it out): Place salmon (seasoned with salt and pepper and a light coating of oil/butter) in an aluminum foil pouch on baking sheet, and bake at 425 for 20-25 minutes.

Simple and excellent. I used yellow chiles since it was all we had on hand and I imagine it would be even better with the spicier serranos. Definitely let the salsa stand at room temp. to let the various elements blend together, as suggested by another cook.

Hello Cathryn. Here is the recipe for Lemon Pilaf. It is from the cookbook (my favorite) Creme de Colorado by the Denver Junior League. 1 TBS freshly grated lemon peel 2 TBS freshly squeezed lemon juice 2 large egg yolks 1/4 heavy cream (although I use half & half) 2 TBS butter 1 1/2 cups jasmine or other white rice 3 cups chicken broth 6 TBS grated parmesan cheese 3 TBS fresh chopped parsley In small bowl combine lemon peel, juice, egg yolks and cream. Whicsk until well blended; set aside. In a medium saucepan, melt butter and add rice. Stir and cook briefly unil rice turns opaque over medium heat. Pour in chicken broth and stir. Bring to boil and reduce heat to simmer and cover with a lid. Cook at low heat for 20-25 minutes. Just before serving, fold lemon-creme mixture. Add parmesan and parsley and mix well. Enjoy! Yes, my email did change - I will also send the recipe to you directly. Cheers

i used alaskan cod rather than salmon (it just happened to be what i had), and it was fantastic. i also marinated the fish in a chili-lime mixture that i made by pounding a serrano chili in a mortar & pestle and then adding lime juice. i served it with sauteed sugar snap peas and roasted purple potatoes, lovely!

yum! i cooled down the salsa by adding a finely diced cucumber to it -- keeps all the tastes there but dilutes it just a little, while adding a nice crunchy texture. served with cumin rice, grilled zucchini, and the vanilla-lime flan recipe http://www.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=4963

I had such very high hopes for this, as I was preparing a special dinner for my salmon-loving boyfriend. However, we both agreed that there are many other salmon recipes that are much better on this site!

It was ok, but will definately not go through all of the prep time this recipe requires again!
