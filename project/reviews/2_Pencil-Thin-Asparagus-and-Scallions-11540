I made these as a holiday side and stuck to the times in the recipe. The asparagus were wonderfully crisp and the taste was a nice break from usual sides this season. The bowl of ice water is key. It was also convenient to start this a few hours before dinner and let the veggies air dry in a colander and then all I had to do is sautee right before serving.

Agree with previous reviews. I sauteed the asparagus and green onion in a fry pan with the butter. Added salt and pepper to season as well as 1 teaspoon of lemon juice for flavor. Would make again sauteed, not boiled.

I didn't like the consistency...too mushy. I did however like the taste of the scallions mixed with the asparagus. If I ever make this recipe again, I will boil the asparagus only for about 1 minute instead of 5.

The texture of this dish was disgusting. I would not recommend making it.

I definitely didn't like this. The scallions seemed waterlogged despite patting dry which gives them an unappetizing texture.

Fabulous-i made this for thanksgiving & everybody loved it! i chopped the onions, & added a few purple onions for color, & just used plain ground black pepper

I was intrigued with this simple recipe, but I didn't even cook the scallions as long as the recipe called for and they STILL completely fell apart. They just kept unraveling....
