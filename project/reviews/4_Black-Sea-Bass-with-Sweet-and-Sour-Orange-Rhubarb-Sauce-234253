OK, but after all that effort I felt like what I ended up with was a funky tomato sauce. I didn't get all these other notes, but for the chunks of orange.

This was excellent! I didn't add rhubarb, and just let the flavors (cinnamon, orange, mint, ginger, and honey) do all the heavy lifting. Would definitely make it again. Also, pan fried the fish instead of oven cooking, for time reasons. Still tasted wonderful.

I almost didn't make this recipe because of the fussing with the rhubarb. I had an old jelly colandar that made easy work of the task, but I think with good home picked fresh rhubarb just cooking until tender would work fine. I used skinned grouper which was wonderful. The sauce was so very tasty. It sounds improbable but the rhubarb, tomato orange mint combo with spices was delicious.

I made this tonight using some rhubarb frozen from the summer. I halved the recipe for two sort of. I carmelized some shallots with the onions. I used Tropicana Orange Juice, but still followed everything else. Added some Clementine Oranges at the end. The result was reallly good. I am suprised at the lack of reviews. Make this. You will like it.
