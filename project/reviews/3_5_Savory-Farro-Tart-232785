This dish has alot of potential, but indeed requires significant adjustments. Ricotta should definitely be halved. I added smoked paprika, and sundried tomatoes. Will also add spinach or some other herbs next time. It's almost fabulous, but not quite there with the original recipe.

My rating for this recipe is as modified. The other reviewers had some fantastic suggestions: I halved the ricotta (part skim) and used smoked mozzarella. I added fresh chopped basil and roasted cherry tomatoes and only used one of the two egg yolks. This was a unique and delicious dish using one of my favorite ingredients (farro). This vegetarian will make it again and again!

This would have been really good, but there was way too much ricotta for the amount of farro, as well as for the amount of flavorings like garlic and parsley. I feel as if there was an error in the recipe and it should be 15 oz. ricotta, not 30. (esp as it barely fit in a pie plate following the recipe--had to be mounded somewhat.) Next time I'll use half the ricotta, and I think it will be delicious.

I just made this and it is so tasty. I halved the recipe, cut the butter to about 1tsp. to sautee the garlic (I sprayed a 9" pie plate with cooking spray to get the breadcrumbs to stick), used skim ricotta and 1 whole egg. Cutting the fat still produced a delicious tart.

Subtle and tasty, and the farro adds something special. This would be terrific with summer tomatoes and balsamic vinegar, or a salad dressed with a citrus-based salad dressing. I made the recipe as is this time; next time I might use a mix of part-skim and whole milk ricotta.

This is one of those recipes that is highly underrated. It makes me sad that slightly more than half would make this again. For vegetarians, flexitarians, and even meat eaters, this is a nutritious dish that offers protein from a grain that keeps us fuller longer. In terms of flavor, I also added spinach and smoked mozzarella, and now that it's summer I will be adding in lots of fresh herbs next time - you could experiment with dill, basil, parsley, thyme or a combination of any of those. This has become a weekly staple, both as a main course for dinner, and a side to a salad at lunch. Enjoy!

I used only half of ricotta called for, using part skim and added one package frozen chopped spinach (defrosted and liquid thoroughly squeezed out) to give it some additional nutrients. Then I put it in two 8" tart tins instead of one pie dish and it was deliciously crispy on the edges. Froze one for weeknight dinners and ate the other in no time. Next time I will try the reviewer's suggestion about adding in mozzarella, and maybe some red pepper flakes. YUM

I made this tart exactly as directed and absolutely hated it! I wish I could have given it no forks.

I've made this dish several times, but I use a combination of good, organic fresh ricotta and smoked mozzarella. The smoky flavor of the cheese goes nicely with the nutty flavor of the farro. It's always a hit, and there are never leftovers.

I thought this was ok but nothing spectacular. Very plain -- a little too subtle for me. For this much fat, I want something with more robust flavor. On the plus side, really easy to make, great for a weekday dinner.

I don't know if it was because I used an unpolished farro, farro intero, but the tart was very nutty and delicious. This dish could be be paired with many things since it doesn't have an "in your face" flavor. It makes a great and healthful vegetarian meal when paired with a salad.

Great results for not a lot of effort; the farro gives it a nice texture; very wine friendly; next time I might add some chopped spinach to make it a little healthier.

Incredibly delicious and so easy to make. The spices were perfect and the texture of the farro made this cheese tart much lighter than it would appear. It's a good party dish because it tastes equally good warm or at room temperature. Wonderful!
