Addictive little potatoes...kept the skin on gold potatoes and used smoked sweet paprika, smoked chili powder and Finest Soul Seasoning...YUM.

These were pretty darned good, and a great alternative to our usual grilled potatoes. I think we'll play with the flavors on it, maybe changing it up with veggie seasoning and paprika to go with chicken, or salt, pepper, and mustard powder...there's lots of options on how you can season these up. Best part is, with my work schedule I can dice the potatoes in the morning, throw them in a bowl of water and then drain and roast when I get home. So this one has a lot of potential with the variety of seasonings as well as a relatively quick side dish. They get nice and crispy the last 10 minutes of baking!

Great, easy way to make hash browns for a crowd. My teenager loved them. I tripled the recipe and didn't have one scrap left over. Be sure not to crowd them in the pan or they won't crisp.

Very tasty recipe. Simple to make and rates high on the "bang for the buck" meter. Be sure not to parboil the potatoes longer than suggested otherwise they will turn out mushy.

Wonderful! Adjust the seasonings and the quantity to fit your mood. We had ours alongside sloppy joes for a quick and easy lunch.

Nothing really great about 'cajun' hash browns. Much easier to buy them from a fast food joint, and usually much better too.

I made these potatoes for a Christmas brunch today. They were fantastic. I doubled the recipe and thought that there would be enough for everyone. Not even close! My son implored me to make them again and they're in the oven right now. Yum.

These potatoes were wonderful. If you want to "kick it up a notch" go for the full strength in spices. These are not hot in taste but they are spicy. I did these on the barbecue with great success. I will definately do these again.

Try these with sweet potatoes! I don't parboil them and sometimes just use cayanne, salt and pepper for seasoning. They're great!

The potatoes turned out great,the only thing different was that I used only 1/4 teaspoon of all ingredients instead of 1/2 and the potatoes were pretty spicy. They were great. Definitely another winner!
