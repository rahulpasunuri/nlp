Makes amazing pancakes. I didn't even need to use Maple Syrup. You do need to add another 1/2 cup of milk or the batter is too thick.

This is an exeptional basic recipe. I followed the recipe closely but made my own buttermilk and added ground flax seed,cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla. The kids and I loved them!

I'm always looking for ways to make recipes healthier for my kids. I focus on high protein and fewer carbs/sugar/gluten. In that vain, I changed this recipe in the following ways: -4 eggs instead of 2 -1 cup of buttermilk instead of 2 -1.5 cups gluten free pancake mix -1/4 cup coconut sugar (lower GI) -1 tsp baking soda -added one cup of ricotta cheese -added vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg I put the buttermilk, vanilla and ricotta cheese in a food processor and blended. I added the eggs and pulsed just a few times more. I served with a strawberry sauce (strawberries, a little water and a little sugar and then pulsed in food processor). I've been experimenting with high protein, gluten free, low sugar pancakes for awhile and this was the best recipe yet. My kids scarfed the pancakes and my husband loved them, too.

Great pancakes! They have a really nice texture and are good enough to be eaten cold.

Really excellent base for a recipe. I substitued plain yogurt for the buttermilk, cut the recipe in half to serve two people, toasted the pecans, and added some nutmeg and cinnemon to the dry ingredients and vanilla to the wet ingredients. Deeeelicious :)

My husband & I made these for Easter breakfast - absolutely delicious! We followed the advice of other reviewers & added vanilla, cinnamon & nutmeg, & added a little additional flour. The banana made the pancakes creamy & the finely-chopped, toasted pecans added great texture. Perfect!

This is a great recipe, with or without the pecans and bananas. The texture of the pancakes is soft and pliable, even after freezing. If you have pancake fans in the house, then make a double batch, and save the rest for weekday mornings!

These are great. If you are concerned about "bad" fats,you can substitute six tablespoons of light olive oil for the butter, and they will still come out delicious and fluffy.

After reading lots of reviews I was curious how these would turn out. They were great! I followed the recipe exactly and they came fluffy and the perfect thickness. I did need to heat the burner bewteen low and medium so it took a bit longer to cook, but they were well worth the effort. My extremely picky two- year-old loves them!

Finally! A pancake recipe that the whole family likes. These are NOT the fluffy cake-like pancakes you get in some restaurants, they are a little thinner and more delicate, but oh my delicious! I haven't tried them with bananas, but have with strawberries, fresh peaches, or just plain with vermont maple syrup. Excellent.

Added vanilla, fresh grated nutmeg and cinnamon gave it a great flavor. My family LOVED IT

This recipe was great! Very easy to prepare, and I did not find the batter runny at all, contrary to other reviews. Will definitely keep this and make it again!

This was hard to make and in the end it tasted horrible it was looking lovely and tasty but really it tasted bad! My children spat it out and cried!

i'm not a pancake fan. period. these are DELICIOUS! i make a bunch and freeze them. when reheated it's like they were just made. still slightly crisp on the outside, moist inside. i add chocolate chips. not just my kid's favorite!

While the result was sweet, I found the batter to be thin, so we added 1/2 c flour. this seemed to help a bit, next time we'll hold off on some of the butter.

From reading the reviews I decided to replace one teaspoon of baking soda with baking powder to help it rise more. The batter is also a little runny as others have noted, I added more flour to thicken it a little and next time around will probably cut down on the amount of buttermilk. Overall pretty yummy, don't forget to add cinnamon and vanilla!

Fast enough to make, but they came out rather thin, just one step thicker than crepes.

Worked well for me, and this was my first time making pancakes. Ever :) The vanilla extract added some good flavor. I made about 14 pancakes using a frying pan.

Great taste! But truly blackened on both sides (same sugar probs as everyone before me). Also, found it difficult to get the pancakes onto the spatula for flipping -- it's as if they just weren't solid enough. Would make again with less/no sugar.

Be careful to have the grill not too hot. The sugars will blacken the pancakes quickly.

This was an exceptionally easy and exceptionally flavorful recipe for banana pancakes. My wife and I loved the result, and we're saving this recipe! Dicing the bananas instead of mashing or slicking made for the perfect mixture of texture and subtle flavor. There were no goopy bits of banana in these pancakes, and no uncooked bits either. We didn't have buttermilk, so I used regular milk and so added about half a cup more flour to thicken up the batter. Also, we left out the pecans.

Summary: Super easy to make. Tasted okay, was a little flat. Will try it again but probably make a few tweaks. Modifications & Observations: Used regular milk rather than buttermilk as we didn't have any on hand. Added vanilla extract, which was nice. Batter consistency was perfect and cooked up nice and fluffy. Due to all the sugar, cooked it on slightly lower heat than normal pancakes so it wouldn't go too dark before it was cooked through.

Seriously surprised at how bad these pancakes were after reading all the glowing reviews. They tasted too much like baking soda, stuck to the pan and were heavy and leaden. I tried using 2 different pans and the pancakes stuck both times. I think the problem is that the recipe called for 2 tsps of baking soda and this made them very airy and light in the pan and then they just collapsed. My daughter loved them but I think they were terrible. Next time I will make my standard pancake recipe and add bananas to it.

very good! light and fluffy--probably my favorite buttermilk pancake recipe. we skip the banana/pecan thing and just throw some blueberries in the batter. yummmm.

A great recipe, a little too sweet. If you add applesauce and cut the butter to 2 tablespoons, you can most definitely skip adding the sugar as the bananas and applesauce more than sweeten it enough. Otherwise, this recipe is one of those that you will make over and over again.

Surprising light and delicious! Added 1 tsp vanilla per reviewers recommendations, and sprinkled in semi-sweet chocolate chips, per kids' request!

I am almost back in Jamaica mon! I toasted the pecans prior to chopping and used 3 small bananas. Perfect.

WOW! One of the best pancake recipes! So easy too. Made a few changes. didn't have buttermilk, so just used regular milk. substituted 3 TB of butter with 1/4 applesauce. omitted the pecans too. will definitely make again.

It was OK. The banana chunks make for a texture I personally don't care for. I prefer good ol' fashioned homemade buttermilk pancakes.

These were good--not great. Although my teenagers were definitely making yummy sounds. Their texture was a bit more like a crepe than a fluffy pancake. I also found that the batter was easier to handle after allowing it to rest about 15 minutes.

We really enjoyed these pancakes.Before even trying them for the first time I reduced the butter to 4T and the sugar to 2T. The bananas make them more than sweet enough. Also left out the nuts(I don't understand why people enjoy nuts in pancakes). Served them with diced peaches and berries and maple syrup for a delicious light supper. Oh yeah, I also mashed the banana-one is enough- so as to enjoy the flavour without the mushy texture-obviously smooth pancakes are my thing.

These pancakes are too lame for serious banana pancake fans. I followed the recipe exactly, but the result was very bland. Perhaps doubling the quantity of banana would help. Does not inspire me to buy "The Summer House Cookbook."

These pancakes were very easy to prepare and quite delicious. Tender pancakes with soft bananas and crunchy nuts (we used walnuts)--yummy!We served the pancakes with fresh blueberries and maple syrup. *We cut down on the melted butter in the recipe because we used whole milk buttermilk. I would definitely make these again.
