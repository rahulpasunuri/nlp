This recipe has inspired one of my favorite recipes, as the way I make it is a loose interpretation! I sautee three big onions (red and white, sliced fairly thin) with leeks, shallots, a couple cloves of garlic, with butter and olive oil until they're translucent. I give the mix a few minutes to cool down, then add salt, pepper, over a tablespoon of fresh herbs (thyme, basil, sage, etc.) and about a cup cup of cheese (any combo of cheddar, goat, feta, or parmesean). I put the mix in a ceramic pie plate, cover it with a pie crust (homeade or storebought), tuck the sides under like I'm making a bed, and bake for 30 minutes at 400. Allow to cool for a few minutes, invert on a big plate, and YUM -- enjoy the tastiet, most special dish ever! A real showstopper, and a great use of all the savories at the farmer's market!!!

really great. Used 4 big onions, 1 cup of Gruyere, 2 tsp of thyme and a pre-made crust. Beautiful and delicious great for brunch or with a thin soup.

Agree that you need more onions--I used 3 large or 4 medium, but had no trouble with the "crust"--except that it is really a biscuit topping with cheese!!! My guests loved it and wanted the recipe so it was a success--try some of the ones with a puff paste crust if you want a real crust--

Excellent recipe. But I must thank the reviewer from Richmond who explained to me (I thought instructions a bit unclear) that when you invert this it actually is like an onion tart. When I read that you stick the onion filling on the pie bottom then the crust on top, then invert after baked, I had visions of the crust falling apart and onion topping oozing everywhere. Not at all; it comes out neat, beautiful, and impressive because the crust really holds it in. You just have to shape it so it looks like a big, shallow jar lid before it goes in the oven. That said, I definitely agree with two other reviewers to halve the crust, but following the recipe for the onion filling I didn't get nearly enough filling. It didn't even cover my pie plate and was barely an inch high. I hurriedly fried up more onions and mixed them in with great results but next time I will definitely at least double the onion filling. I can't imagine what would have happened without halving the crust and so few onions. Thanks fellow reviewers for your excellent advice! Mia from Brooklyn, NY

Made this to accompany prime rib for the holidays. There were no leftovers....it was terrific and very easy, I followed the suggestions of the other commentators and used a prepared crust, that greatly simplied things. I doubled the recipe and it worked like a dream!

I discovered quite by accident that I like this dish better cold! We had leftovers (hey, there were only two of us :), and after a day in the fridge, well wrapped, the remaining quarter pie was just scrumptious! Thanks to Loretta Dell for suggesting halving the amount of crust - definitely a good ratio. I also took up your suggestion to use half white, half yellow onions. Since discovering that this is a great cold dish, I've made it twice as an appetizer for guests, cutting the pie into 16 or 20 tiny wedges. You have to convince people to try it, as it is not obvious how good it will be, and you have to warn them it's not an apple dish - but once one person tastes a piece, everyone gets the message. A top-notch party food that you can make the night before is a must-have recipe! (PS: This site is imposing my husband's email on this review so I added mine to my name... 'quagganaut' is the right one.)

Used prepared pie crust (discarded about 1/3 of it trimming), ordinary swiss cheese, dried thyme, and it was still delicious. I added a little dry mustard to onion mixture as well. Served with grilled trout. Definitely plan to make this again!

As an onion lover, this recipe was superb. I also used only half the amount of crust for the recommended onion amount and it was great. I used half yellow onions and half white. This one is definitely a keeper.

I just had to write and say how entirely easy this recipe was to make. I'm a busy Mom, and cut corners by using a prepared pie crust. I had a ton of onions left over from a church picnic, and my husband was skeptical when I told him I wanted to make an onion pie, but EVERYONE ate it and enjoyed it! And, best of all, I used up all of my leftover onions!

Delicious - a lovely reminder of a dish I used to eat as a child. I took the advice of a previous reviewer and doubled the onion quantity. Wasn't sure exactly how the pastry worked in the dish - tucking the extra around? so I made the tart into a rough galette Julia Child/ Flo Baker style (from her baking book). Halve the pastry amount - or freeze half and it will work out perfectly.

Too much crust and not enough onions. The volume of crust is overwhelming and what's more it's not the least bit interesting in either taste or texture. Extremely disappointing!

I LOVE ONIONS, SO THIS WAS A NATURAL FOR ME. I DID, HOWEVER, SLICE MY ONION INTO SMALLER STRANDS. ADDED MORE GROUND PEPPER THAN CALLED FOR. THE CRUST WAS OUTSTANDING.
