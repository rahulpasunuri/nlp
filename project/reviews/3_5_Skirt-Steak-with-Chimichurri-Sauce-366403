I don't understand why this recipe says to salt and pepper the steak instead of marinating it in the chimichurri. Also, I love chimichurri, but I feel like this recipe is lacking. I've made it a couple times and can't figure out what to change though.

Wow - this was so good. I marinated this in the Chimichurri marinade for 24 hours instead of the salt described here and grilled as described. It was so delicious. I will make this again! Loved the Chimichurri sauce with it also.
