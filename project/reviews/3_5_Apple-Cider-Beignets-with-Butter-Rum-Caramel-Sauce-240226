the basic recipe is a case of less is more. If I were to modify it would only to add more apples. but it was a fast play and a home run .

These remind me of apple donuts more than beignets. I used gingerale instead of sparkling cider because I couldn't find the cider, and I thought the batter was way too thick. I thinned it with some extra gingerale. Flavor could use a little extra sweetness for me, I might try again with a different kind of apple, I think something crisp and sweet like Fuji or Honeycrisp would be better. Sauce was fantastic, however.

This is the most incredible dessert I've served in years. Also great to have friends standing around the kitchen while it's prepared. The self-rising flour makes it!

Nice treat, takes a little while for the caramel to dissolve so leave plenty of time.

Kids and adults loved these. I saved the left over batter and the next morning dipped cooked maple sausage in it. Great breakfast dipped in maple syrup!

This is my new favorite recipe. I did find the batter to be a bit on the thick side and simply remedied this by adding more sparkling apple cider. Both the batter and the caramel sauce keep well, which makes this an easy dessert to throw together last minute. And you do want to serve them as soon as possible after cooking since they can get soggy. Can't wait to make them again soon.

First time deep frying anything. Worked great, relatively easy. Tasted wonderful. My guests raved over the caramel.

Very good. I agree with reducing the temp a little to prevent over browning.

I made these for a small dinner party. I made the rum sauce ahead and sliced and prepped the apple slices. With a deep fryer it was surprisingly easy to throw together after dinner. Very popular with my guests.

Good recipe. For the reviewer who is asking about dark rum, the following is from this website's FOOD DICTIONNARY which has a whealth of information. Rum is "A LIQUOR distilled from fermented sugarcane juice or MOLASSES. Most of the world's rum comes from the Caribbean. Puerto Rico's white or silver rum is clear and light in body and flavor. The Puerto Rican golden and amber rums have a deeper color and a flavor to match. Dark, rich and full- bodied best describes Jamaican and Cuban rums. The sugarcane that grows along Guyana's Demerara River produces the darkest, strongest and richest of all, Demerara rum. This slightly sweet liquor is used in a variety of cocktails including the CUBA LIBRE, MAI TAI, DAIQUIRI and PIÑA COLADA. "

This was excellent! I made these recently for a dinner party, and served them with vanilla ice cream. They were a huge hit!
