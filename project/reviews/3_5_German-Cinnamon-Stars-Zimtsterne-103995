Four forks delicious! Forget cutting them out with the star cutter - I put mine in a pastry bag with a huge tip and made "drop" cookies, so to say. My whites didn't beat up quite as stiff as they should have, so this worked just fine. They were so good that I only put a few on the cookie trays to share and wound up eating the rest myself...yes, they are THAT good!

Zimtsterne? More like Zimtsupernovae! Whoever heard of cooking meringues at 350°F? They tend to explode and ooze all over the cookie sheet. They tasted fine, but after looking at two other recipes, they called for baking them at 300°F for 20 minutes and glazing them before baking. Easier and cuts out a step. If the glaze is too thick to brush easily just add a few drops of water. I did the last sheet that way and they turned out much better. Adding more sugar to the dough made them very sweet, so I would incorporate the extra 1/2 cup called for but no more than 1 cup. Also the dough is so tender it is better to pat it out than roll it. I'll make them again, but with a different recipe.

I live in Austria where these Cinnamon stars are tradtionally made every Christmas. I haven't tried this particular version, but I have a tip as to how to handle the dough. When all is mixed, place the dough between 2 layers of clingfilm and then roll it. Dip the star cutter into icing sugar before each cut. Don't have the oven too hot or the icing will brown. Good luck!

My son made this for a school project and found it to be one of the hardest things to make. They were good but horrible to cut and put on the baking sheet.

Delicious, yes, but easy to make? No! I am not a kitchen whiz, but none of the steps here seemed too difficult. The meringue was SO sticky, though, that after one attempt to roll it out (and a kitchen blanketed in powdered sugar, sticky waxed paper, and expletives) I put it back in the bowl, added about an additional 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar, and the next attempt went much better. I have no idea how much I may have altered the intended taste, though, with all that extra sugar -- they don't seem way too sweet, so maybe it was okay. I also don't recommend dipping the cutter in water -- it makes the dough very gooey. Finally, even though my cut-out dough stars looked impeccable, when they baked, because of the puffiness, they looked awfully sloppy, as did the meringue "icing". But they were a wonderful treat to eat!

Yummy and easy to make. And they look nice, too.

It's impossible to explain how good they were.
