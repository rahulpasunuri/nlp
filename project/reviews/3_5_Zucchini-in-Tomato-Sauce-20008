Not the greatest way to eat zucchini, too mushy for my taste.

This is a nice side or main dish. I used the canned organic fire roasted tomatoes which are excellent and replaced garlic with shallots. I served this as a main course, hot dish with pan seared tilapia and then had the leftover sauce cold the next night atop toasted bread as bruschetta-delicious!

I tossed the zucchini with olive oil, vinegar, and garlic powder, then roasted it before adding it to the tomato sauce - tasted GREAT. I plan to make it again tonight with zucchini and eggplant. Although it takes more time, I highly recommend roasting the veggies to bring out the flavor.

Yum!!! What a great way to serve zucchini. I added extra garlic to the sauce, and served it hot.

This is a wonderful recipe! Simple to make, yet simply wonderful to devour...and devour you will! This recipe is a must for those with zucchini in their garden. Waiting for more of my zucks to blossom so I can make this again...and again!

We liked it better un-peeled and served hot as a side dish or on pasta or rice. Try with a little shredded mozzerella. My kids LOVE it!

I sliced my medium unpeeled zucchini in 1 - 1 1/2 in think slices, and served this dish hot over rice. It was tasty, but not special.

THIS IS A GOOD SIMPLE RECIPE THAT MY FAMILY LOVED. I CHANGED TWO THINGS: I SUBED PLAIN WHOLE TOMATOES FOR THE PLUM ONES TO SAVE MONEY AND SERVED IT HOT.

This was a great recipe, but I thought the directions were a bit vague. I had to improvise a bit. Otherwise, it was delicious!
