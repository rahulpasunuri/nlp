These cookies were okay, not much flavor and I did follow other's suggestions to use butter. Easy, but that's about it.

Very good sugar cookies as written, but I agree that 14 minutes in the oven will create a burnt mess....7-8 minutes is enough. Don't roll them too thin unless you want them more crisp. Those reviewers who could not work with the dough unless chilled are probably not using shortening. I substitute half of the shortening for butter because I like the flavor of butter but also like the stability of shortening and I don't chill it at all - no problem rolling/cutting even tho it is soft. I add more zest than called for and like lemon better than orange.

The cookies were delicious. I used unsalted butter instead of shortening and lemon peel instead of orange. The dough was very soft so I had to chill it for an hour or so before I could work with it. I baked the cookies for 8 minutes and even that might have been a minute too long as they were a little more brown on the edges than I liked. Still, the end product was a delcious cookie, buttery and lightly sweet, crisp on the outside and sort of tender inside but without being chewy.

Really simple and quick (as far as cookies go from scratch)! I used butter, not lard and they are really good. I didn't chill the dough anymore than keeping it in the fridge as my 4 year old and myself rolled & cut them out. I will make them again.

Very easy recipe, minimal messes, start to finish it took me about 15 minutes. I used butter instead of vegetable oil, and cinnamon instead of orange peel. Very nice cookies, I would definately recommend if you dont have alot of time. Maybe next time I'll use lime zest...hhmmmm..

I made these with my son. I am not a skilled baker and at 3 neither is he! They were really easy, the batter was simple to do (the tutorials really helped with the process). Everyone really really loved them. My mom had to leave the kitchen or she was going to eat the whole batch. I used unsalted butter instead of shortening, no problem there. They are not too sweet so the sugar on top just makes it. I didn't use the citrus and they were fine that way. Don't cook them more than 7 minutes. I found that 6 min is a perfect lighter cookie and 7 was a bit more browned depending on how you like them. I did a couple of batches, 1/8 thick and 1/4 thick, either way great. The don't really expand, so you can get a lot on a sheet. I already had to give out the recipe.

I have been making these cookies every Christmas since published in 1991. This is the best sugar cookie recipe I've found. I use all butter instead of shortening, unless I am using an intricate cut out like a snow flake and need more stability.

this recipe was terrible. did not roll out easily as promised, made a gigantic mess of the kitchen, and no matter how cold it got after chilling, my countertop was a greasy floury disaster.

This recipe is simple and yummy. I don't know what the bad reviews are all about. It was plenty sweet and they were most certainly not nasty. I'm make it again for sure!

A wonderful sugar cookie recipe! Although I didn't add the orange peel, but only because I didn't have any. Also, because the reviews said the dough would be sticky, I only added 2 tablespoons of milk.

I liked this recipe. The dough was really easy to work with. I did need to chill for 15 minutes or so...and I only cooked them for 7 minutes. Does anyone have a good recipe for frosting these cookies?

Made these for a July 4th party, and they were a big hit! Doubled the recipe, and decorated them with the icing from the "Gingerbread Cookies and Citrus Sugar Cookies" recipe. I also substituted orange extract for the orange rind, and it worked well.

I substituted grated lemon peel for the orange peel and almond extract for the vanilla. They turned out nice. 14 minutes in the oven would result in near-burnt cookies.

Excellent cookies. Easy to work with and need no refrigeration between making the dough and rolling it out. The dough is easy to work with -- my seven year old son rolled and cut out cookies with no problem.

Good recipe for roll-out Christmas cookies. A few friends and I doubled this recipe last night and we had a blast decorating them. They did not take 14 min in the oven--more like 8-9. I was skeptical about the orange peel, but it did add good flavor to the dough.

I used dried grated orange peel, and the resulting cookies weren't anything special. They were gobbled up at work, but -- than again -- everything seems to get gobbled up at work. I baked them for 11-13 min (2 separate batches).

I loved these cookies. They were so easy to roll out. They did not stick at all to my rolling pin or my counter. I also substituted the orange extract for the orange peel. I think I might use lemon extract next time, just to see what it tastes like. I will definately make these for Christmas. Delicious!

This recipe was easy and fun to make....using a heart shaped cookie cutter, they make great bridal shower and valentine's Day treats...I would definitley make again....try using a silpat baking sheet instead of greasing the pan, they come out very nicely, and also, 14 minutes is WAY to long....mine took about 9 minutes.

Very successful...I don't have luck with rolling out cookie dough, but this one worked very well. For smaller cookies, watch the time very carefully...they brown fast at the end. Tasty and easy. A keeper!

I used this recipe with holiday cookie cutters. The recipe made 28 cookies and none of them took 14 minutes. The average time per batch was closer to 10 minutes. we decorated them with colored icing and mini-M&M's and they were a big hit! Delicious!

I thought this was a great recipe, the veg. shortning makes all the difference. One tsp. of orang extract can be subsituted for the peal, and then it is easier to control the flavor of the final product by adjusting the extract.

One of the easiest doughs I have ever worked with,WE loved the orange flavor.I will save this recipe and make again for Easter.

Talk about bland! I know sugar cookies aren't usually exciting, but these lack almost any flavor at all. If I were to make them again I'd try using lemon peel instead of orange and adding lemon extract. Also, the dough was EXTREMELY soft. I didn't even use all the milk called for when I saw how sticky the dough was, but I still had to chill the dough an hour before rolling. A big disappointment.

The orange was over whelming and the cookies are just Nasty!!! and there is not enough sugar in the cookies so if you want to make them add more sugar!!!

Disappointing. With such rave reviews I thought it must be a winner. The orange flavor was too strong and there was not enough of a butter flavor. I also had difficulty working with the dough.

WONDERFUL! This recipe is easy, and the texture is great. I added lemon extract, and almond flavoring to mine. This recipe puts the fun back into making sugar cookies

This is a great, easy-to-work-with sugar cookie recipe. The dough was perfect and I was able to rework and reuse it many many times. The baked cookies are quite durable. I actually iced the cookies too and this made the final cookie a bit too sweet for our taste. If you do decide to frost these cookies, adjust the sugar a bit.

The cookies are easy to make and the orange peel gives them a wonderful subtle flavor. These treats are great for making Christmas cookies, too! I recommend these cookies for their great taste and for their fun possibilities!
