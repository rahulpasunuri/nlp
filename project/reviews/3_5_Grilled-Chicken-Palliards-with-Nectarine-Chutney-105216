Great recipe. Pounding the chicken is the hardest part. I think it is essential, though. The chicken grills quickly, easily and evenly. I made this for a group with adults and kids. The adults loved it and the kids loved the chicken seasoned only with salt pepper and olive oil. A great dish all around.

I love this chutney recipe and look forward to making it when nectarines are in season each summer. A few changes - I use sun-dried apricot vinegar available from Gourmet Country, Roma tomatoes and sweet curry powder. It's also excellent with pork tenderloin and grilled shrimp. I wrote about it on my blog at http://sallycameron.com. Maybe I will get some canned this year for winter time.

I love this chutney recipe and look forward to making it every summer when nectarines are available. I prefer to use sun-dried apricot vinegar instead of the apple cider. It's available at Gourmet Country online. I also use sweet curry powder and Roma tomatoes. This year I may make extra and can it for the winter. Great with chicken and pork tenderloin.

This was very easy to make. I did pound the chicken, but I can see why it's not necessary. I broiled my chicken breasts for about 6-8 minutes. The chutney was delicious. My husband, who is not a fan of jarred chutney really enjoyed this. I served it over basmati rice and a green salad. Will make this again!

Easy and delish served over rice! I didn't pound the chicken but I did reduce the amt of curry to 1/2 t.

FANTASTIC!! I served it on a bed of spiral pasta, and gobbled it up. Really easy to make, and very delicious. One could use any curry powder. I don't stock curry powder, but had the individual spices to make my own. YUM!

EXCELLENT!! I had old nectarines that needed using. I didn't have curry powder, so I used garam masala (a different type of curry powder). And I added some fresh chillies. This dish was easy, delicious, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.

I made the recipe as specified except for the specific kind of curry. I tried it out on my two children. My 7 yr. old boy loved it, my 9 year old girl really did not love it ... at all. I myself love the smell of curry and the taste but can't eat it for very long ... the taste becomes repititious for me. I agree with the last comment and when I make it again will probably reduce the amount of curry. But I will be making it again. We served it on a bed of rice.

Loved it! My husband kept commenting that this is something he would get at a fine restaurant. Cut back a little on the curry since we have 2 small children. Sub'd 1/2 pint of grape tomatoes, cut in half. Very easy and delicious for a hot August evening after work.

I thought this was OK, and I plan to make it again because I think it should have been better. My husband really liked it. I also had it cold the following day, and preferred it hot.

Pounding the chicken will even out the thickness. When the thickness is the same thickness all of the chicken will cook evenly. The result.. a perfectly cooked piece of chicken!

Loved the ease of this dish. I used the recipe for the Chutney and canned my fresh nectarines for future use. Very good on fish and pork

Different and refreshing for warm summer nights. I would definitely serve this again.

This was fine for an easy weeknight dinner to do something different with chicken, but I doubt I'll make it again. Husband felt the same as me. I saw no reason to pound the chicken breasts either, keeps them juicier if you don't. Served with grilled corn and grilled red peppers. Very easy and I loved the smell of the cooking chutney.

The chutney was a little sharp, added a little more brown sugar. Grilled the chicken in a pan. Everyone liked it very much but I see no reason to pound the chicken first.

Great unique combination of flavors; so easy to make; I baked the chicken with a little white wine instead; served it over cous-cous with the strawberry & baby greens salad found in the July 02 Gourmet issue; you will need for it to render more liquid, though, if you serve it over cous-cous as the cous-cous soaks it up and the sauce kind of disappears--for this, I simmered with a lid on for a short time

This recipe is perfect for entertaining or for a normal Wednesday night meal. It is so easy - no sauteeing, minimal chopping and great in the summer when the grill is a staple. I am always looking for a new way to make chicken and this is delicious even for someone who is not a huge fan of curry.

Very enjoyable, and VERY easy. You can make it on a weeknight after a hard day's work, it takes no time at all. Plus, it has a "different" flavor, which is nice if you are tired of the same-old-midweek chicken dishes.

I loved this! Followed it exactally too. The nectarines were great, and I am glad this recipe reminded me of that really special fruit. The smell of that sauce cooking was one special show! My only complaint was the dullness of the chicken, it needed something? The sauce was overwhelming, so next time I will use a peanut oil, and some lime juice, maybe marinade that for an hour or 2 with some garlic. But overall, very good!

I was really impressed with this recipe because it was so easy and had such amazing flavor. I admit that I really didn't pay any attention to the actual proportions required, but it really didn't matter. For two people, I used one nectarine, a handful of grape tomatoes, half a shallot instead of a garlic clove (I hadn't realized I had run out of garlic the night before), shook in some brown sugar and poured in a dollop of white vinegar. The minute I turned the burner on the chutney started emitting a tantalizing smell. Served it with couscous w/ almonds and some peas, and my picky husband gobbled it down, saying that this really tasted like a restaurant meal!
