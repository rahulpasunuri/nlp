Added some celery salt and some onion salt to the flour. Others eating it said they'd prefer it a little saltier but I liked it the way it was. Better than a similar Gourmet Traveler recipe I've previously tried

I made this for my Book Club and it turned out great! I used large thigh pieces only. I think the trick is to bake after frying as this finishes the cooking process and renders the excess fat and vegetable oil off the chicken. I don't normally cook with frying oil, but I will make an exception for this fried chicken!

Ehh.. Kind of bland, and didn't get very crispy. The chicken was tender and well flavored though. Also, I agree, no need to strain gravy, just don't get lumps to begin with.

Fantastic. I added paprika and pepper to the marinade, and also to the dredging flour. This turned out beautifully. It's my first time making fried chicken, and frying might be a dangerous skill to add to my kitchen repertoire. This was perfect fried chicken, though, and I will make it again. Someday. When my arteries recover from the shock of too much delicious.

what kind of mustard? Dry? Regular yellow hot dog style?

to A Cook From Cleveland: She turned the chicken after just a minute and a half because the oil was too hot to start off with, and it would have burned the crust if she let them cook longer. The main point isn't neccesarily how long you should cook it per side, but rather watching for the golden brown color to develop. Whether it takes you 3 minutes or 7 minutes, you r going to b finishing it in the oven. Cook it the remaining 10 minutes in the oven, and then just poke the pieces with a knife at the bone to see if the juices run clear, and not bloody. If its still bloody, then just bake it a few minutes longer. Hope that helps!

The chicken was tender and delicious. True to my southern roots, I had to add paprika and black pepper to the breading, but followed everything else exactly.

Not bad on the fried chicken recipe. But this must be a yankee version of country gravy, "strain the gravy" are you serious??? It's a lot easier to make a gravy without lumps than it is to strain it.

I'm not sure I understand the video... she says fry the pieces 6-7 minutes on each side, but turns them after about a minute and a half. The video does lapse before she removes the pieces to finish them in an oven, has she turned them BACK for the remaining 5-6 minutes? Can someone help me with this before I attempt it?
