Buttery and custardy. Made with a loaf of challah that had been in freezer too long for any other use, and it worked great. Soaked/chilled 5 hours. Used coarse Kosher salt and did not find too salty at all. Be sure to cube bread in 1/2 inch cubes per recipe - that's small, but perfect. Every last bite was eaten!

I feel like I made a completely different recipe from the one every one else has reviewed. I made this for Thanksgiving, and it was not very good at all. I think, perhaps, it would have been better without the pecans (or at the very least, less pecans), but the whole thing was just underwhelming. I am stunned that such a well-reviewed recipe was so disappointing.

We made this for Thanksgiving and it is, by far, the very best bread pudding we've ever had! The combination of flavors simply erupts with yummy goodness! A definite make-again!

We made this last year for Thanksgiving and it was SUCH a hit. People who normally went straight for the Pumpkin Pie could not stop eating this bread pudding. I have to admit that I am not usually a huge butterscotch fan but this dessert was so good that I went for seconds over every other pie! Will be making again this year for sure. -Carlos and Jen

For those who are both gluten and dairy free, I successfully made over this recipe using a home baked loaf of gluten free apple bread, Earth Balance and So Delicious Unsweetenned Original Coconut Milk (no, this does not taste like coconut). I did not remove the crusts as I felt it was sitting overnight and they would get soft--and they were. This was delicious and thanks for a recipe that was easy to convert to fit my dietary needs!! =)

Wonderful special occasion dessert. Served at our culinary group's comfort foods dinner and it was a big hit. I used challah bread, half and half(instead of hvy cream), only soaked for 30 minutes, and served with creme anglaise in addition to the butterscotch, it was AMAZING! I could eat the butterscotch sauce by itself. And I'm not a big fan of sweets. Will make again. Thank you

De-lish. I wouldn't change a thing. Huge hit over the holidays and reheats very well.

This was a delicious dish but based on my other favorite bread pudding recipes, I didn't think it needed all that cream so I did 2 cups cream and 2 cups milk. It was still rich as can be and wonderful. Cutting the crusts off this enormous french loaf was time consuming so I only did half-- and found that the crusts soaked up the milk and were soft as can be so I might skip that step next time.

I made this for Christmas dinner, omitting the pecans because my daughter's allergic to nuts. It was fantastic! Everyone had at least seconds. I didn't think the sauce was too salty, nor did my husband or daughter.

Made for Christmas dinner. Very good! Agree with previous reviewers that sauce was too salty. Made another 1/2 batch without salt and added to original batch-helpful. Next time I will use more 1/2 and 1/2 and milk rather than ALL cream. Also, used more bourbon that called for buy 2 tbsp and used vanilla extract instead of bean. Worked well Enjoy!

I used 2 cups half and half and 2 cups 2% milk and only 1/2 stick of butter. I didn't have any poppy seeds, so I deleted them, I reduced the sugar in the pudding by 1/2 cup and used vanilla extract instead of the bean. The resulting pudding was AMAZING! I ate it for breakfast the next morning. The salt/sugary butterscotch sauce puts it over the top.

I concur with the Cook from Anchorage, AK that the sauce was way too salty. It overwhelmed the buttery bourbon taste of the sauce, and even came through as salty with the bread pudding. I thought I measured incorrectly or used salted butter by accident, but checked and it was no mistake. Tossed the sauce and remade it with only 1/2 tsp salt. Much better!

Huge it at a recent Christmas party. Made no substitutions or changes. The cream/egg/sugar mixture tastes like a high end melted vanilla ice cream! Rather than have the guests pour the sauce over individually, I slowly poured the sauce over the finished pudding when it came out of the oven. The poppy seeds are a must! Enjoy!!

Made exactly as described and can't say just how scrumptious this is! Gorgeous presentation, delightful texture, melt in your mouth kinda dessert. I am NOT a dessert girl and yet managed to outfight everyone for the coveted last piece, cooks perogative! The guests were equally, if not more so, gaga. It's even worth the obscene amount I was charged for the Vanilla Bean :).

I love bread pudding so I thought this sounded like it would be a nice addition to the dessert menu for Thanksgiving. It was fabulous! The rustic style bread made a nice little caramelized crust on top to go with the creamy, rich interior. And the nutty sweetness of the pecans, combined with the vanilla and bourbon was simply deeeelicious!! The butterscotch sauce was gooey and rich and complimented the pudding perfectly. Having said that, I am a person who likes to cut the sugar and fat in my recipes not only to make them healthier but also to make them taste better. I made some changes which improved it for me without totally taking away the decadence of the dessert. I cut the melted butter in the pudding in half as well as the sugar; the butterscotch sauce is plenty sweet to make up for the loss! I also used half evaporated milk and half whipping cream rather than heavy cream. You really could use whatever milk product you wanted. I didn't have a vanilla bean so I used 1t. of pure vanilla extract. I am a huge nut fan, but I reduced the pecans to 1 1/2c. because I wanted to taste a little more of the creaminess of the pudding rather than so much of a mouthful of nuts. Poppy seeds add crunch too! The butterscotch sauce was delicious but way too salty for my taste. I understand the concept of counterbalancing the sweet with salty, but this was over the top. I have to admit, it was not really so noticeable on the bread pudding, but when tasting it plain or on ice cream, it was too salty. Next time, I will try cutting the salt in half. Also, I used dark brown sugar and whipping cream because that is what I had. This sauce would be great on many things! Despite my adjustments (sorry!), this dessert was a delightful combination of rich, gooey, creamy, and crunchy. Definitely worthy of the 4 fork designation!

We love bread pudding. This one is my very, very favorite and everyone's favorite. Did not put as many poppy seeds as requested, used potato bread as it was the only bread I could find and pecan halves. My husband who is visiting relatives just called and asked me to send the recipe to him. He wants to show off his culinary expertise. Won't be hard with this recipe. This recipe is by far the easiest carmel sauce recipe ever.

I've never made bread pudding before but decided to give this recipe a try over Thanksgiving and am I ever glad I did. This is one of the better desserts I have had and everybody who tried it loved it. The butterscotch sauce it excellent and the poppy seeds are a nice little extra. I would definitely make this again and I don't think anybody would object.

So decadent, so delicious! I considered omitting poppy seeds - and even after adding them in, i couldn't really "see them" - but they did definitely add to the dessert....a little texture and visual appeal. A great centerpiece to the holiday table. Almost didn't have enough of the butterscotch sauce! Too many "testers" beforehand..... Oh - and ACrankyHen is right - add in 30-45 mins after taking out of fridge/before oven to get the chill off.

As long as you're not counting calories, this is an absolutely delicious, decadent dish! I often don't like to use the full amount of sugar a recipe calls for because I find many recipes too sweet for my taste but I prepared this one according to the directions. It was simply delicious! The pecans and poppy seeds give it great texture. Mine came out of the oven too soon after Thanksgiving dinner and everyone wanted to wait before having dessert. So I waited, checking my watch as minutes passed by, and the pudding soon cooled to room temperature. Then, my sister-in-law put the bread pudding into the microwave (without my knowledge...I'm generally anti-microwave)! Something I never would have done but to my amazement it was just as good as ever. It was a big hit all around. I think this will likely become my new holiday go-to dessert!

This was really delicious. Great As a leftover too. I think the poopyseeds weren't necessary. I left out the pecans for the kids and added chocolate chips right before cooking. Got rave reviews from everyone

Followed this recipe to the letter for a Thanksgiving event serving close to 20 people. It was a sublime hit, with people going back for seconds and ignoring the pumpkin pie. Keeping it in my repertoire for future entertaining-- it's a sophisticated take on bread pudding and not at all too sweet.

Fantastic dessert and a big hit at today's Thanksgiving dinner. I used brioche bread and did not trim the crusts. At first I thought the bread pudding would be soggy because the bread seemed to absorb too much custard, but overnight the bread plumped back up and baked up perfectly. This could have served at least 15

I made this without the poppy seeds. Also I did one half with pecans one wihtout. AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!

To be honest...I just prepped this to be served tomorrow, Thanksgiving. However, I am not a bourbon fan yet always make things as written the first time, unlike other tinkerers. The butterscotch sauce, with the optional bourbon? Incredible! As the rest of the recipe was going into the fridge to chill until tomorrow, I was desperately searching for some vanilla ice cream. Yum! Best ever!

I've cooked so much for so many years that I can read through a recipe and tell you in a heartbeat whether or not it's a keeper for me. This one definitely is. HOWEVER, a word of warning to those not as chronologically gifted. The instructions are to put the bread mixture into a glass or ceramic pan and chill thoroughly. That's fine up to that point. But then they tell you to preheat the oven to 375 and pop it in to bake. That's the best way I can think of (besides dropping it on a cement floor) to crack your glass or ceramic pan, even if it's Emile Henry. You need to take the pudding mixture out of the refrigerator long enough to bring it up to room temperature before you place it in that 375 degree oven.

I also don't like using corn syrup (re: feckert52) so I sub maple syrup and if you don't have that honey should work although honey seems sweeter than real maple syrup.

Not to mention the pecans and bourbon. Just look up the macros for those few ingredients and you'll have your answer.

@meastman2 - Are you looking for something healthy?? The recipe has 5 eggs and 4 cups of heavy cream - the calories are over the top - that's what this recipe is all about. Fat filled goodness!

This is a question - this recipe sounds amazing, and the reviews bear that out. But I just don't do corn syrup. And I think from a 'chemistry' perspective you couldn't just leave it out without subbing something that would provide a similar texture/chemical reaction. Any ideas?

Wow...This was served at my job's Thanksgiving luncheon. I didn't make it but it was a huge hit. Everyone was raving about it voting for it to replace the monthly Sam's club birthday cake. I thought the poppy seeds were an interesting addition and I loved the fact that there were so many pecans.

this is the BEST bread pudding I've ever eaten. My old standby was the Commander's Palace version, sans the meringue, and I never thought it could be surpassed. Made some changes: left out the bourbon, used fewer pecans because the little buggers are ridiculously expensive, browned the butter and used dark brown sugar. So indulgent!!

OMG! I love bread pudding, almost, any bread pudding. But, this is the best ever soooo far! Wouldn't change a thing in this recipe.
