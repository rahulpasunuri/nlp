I'm a huge eggplant fan so I usually love anything with eggplant in it. I added garlic and after reading some others reviews also added dill and agree it did improve the taste. I thought it was good not great and next time might cut back on the cinnamin and use more garlic.

this dish was extremely tasteless. it was almost reminiscent of oatmeal, the way it hearty & with nuts in it. i added garlic power to the dish to spruce it up a bit but it was just too bland for me. great concept though, i would make it again if i totally tweeked it

i have to admit, i did feel it was a disappointing dish at first, it was reminiscent of oatmeal. but then i added a couple tbs. of granulated garlic and it actually tasted pretty decent after that. i don't know if i would make it again

Sorry, it should have been 3-4 forks

After reading other reviews, I decided to try it making some changes. I used chicken broth instead of water, I lowered the amount of rice fo 3/4 cup and I doubled the amount of raisins and used a heaping tsp of cinnamon. However, in order that it not be mushy, I think it is important that, after draining the eggplant, it should be rolled up in a towel and the eggplant moisture should be pressed out as much as possible. So after all that, I loved it!! Three and a half forks for me!

Very mushy and not enough flavor to make it worth cooking again.

I thought this was OK, but not good enough to make again. There wasn't enough flavor in this dish for all the work that went into it. That said, the addition of the dill really made the dish--I couldn't believe how much it added to the flavor.

Did not like this dish. Too many competing flavors and too mushy texture. WIll NEVER make again. Cannot think of a way to make it better.....

I liked this, but would fiddle with it a bit. I would suggest adding more cinnamon and cutting back on the oil a bit. Definitely follow the time frame and let the flavors sit and meld. It truly makes all the difference. I used currants, but might even double the amount.

This is so delicious and healthy that it's become one of my staples. Be liberal with the cinnamon. I find it works to substitute almonds for pistachios if you prefer. Brown rice works well, too, if you are patient enough for it. For those looking for an easier version - I haven't yet tried this, but I bet you could saute the onions and then dump them into the rice cooker with everything, saving the eggplant and nuts for the end.

I love eggplant and my husband is a rice lover,and we both like pilafs, so this variation caught my eye.I used chicken broth instead of water, and Craisins AND currants, and we loved it. The eggplant added richness, and the flavors were not overpowering, making it a perfect side to the thick chops in mango reduction sauce we had with it. Yum.

Sooooo yummy! This was fantastic! I made this for a large dinner party, and it was a huge hit. I liked the fact that it was a great side dish, but was substantial enough to be more of a main dish for vegetarians. I'm going to try to whittle it down to make a faster recipe so I can make it all the time!

Not bad. I made this as a main dish. Used jasmine rice, came out great. Next time I would use a little more cinammon, and saute eggplant a bit longer. I also used dried cranberries.

Not my favorite dish. It tasted very thin, without alot of body, like it was missing something. Maybe using chicken broth instead of water would help, but I don't think I'll bother.

This recipe was delicious, however, I added more raisins and cinnamon. One note of caution: be very careful with the basmati rice, mine was completely done after 7 minutes and would've burned had I cooked it longer.

So good! I used jasmine rice instead of basmati and Craisins instead of raisins since that's all I had. It turned out wonderfully! I loved the flavor!

Excellent! I found I needed a bit more oil to fry the eggplant properly, also I did not soak the eggplant in salt water, but salted and let the eggplant sweat, then rinsed prior to frying. I had no raisins or currents so I used barberries, which were a bit tart, I think the sweetness of the raisins would have been much nicer.

I added chicken to make this a main dish. I sliced chicken breasts into 1-inch pieces and sauteed it with the onions, adding extra oil and salt along the way to accommodate. It came out really well. The chicken and the eggplant were very tender, and I loved the combination of flavors (cinnamon, raisins, eggplant). This dish is very easy to prepare and the results are fantastic.

Very tasty dish, however next time I make it I won't use so much oil or salt. Quick, easy and delicious.

We loved this recipe. My wife and I managed to put it away in two meals, dinner with lamb chops as the entree and lunch the following day. The cinnamon added a unique taste to the rice pilaf.
