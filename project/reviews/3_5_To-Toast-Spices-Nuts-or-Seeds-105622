Re toasting nuts: Beware, 350 degrees is too hot for most nuts, especially tender and less dense/hard nuts such as walnuts, pecans and cashews. To prevent burning of these nuts, bake them at 250-275 degrees and extend the oven time by 8-10 minutes - you have to know your oven. At a lower temp it is usually not necessary to turn/stir the nuts. Harder/denser nuts like whole almonds, brazils and hazelnuts can withstand a temp of 300-325 degrees but do require stirring/turning to toast evenly and prevent burning. Also, all nuts will dry and crisp up as they cool so it is much better to bake slowly and at a lower temp rather than rushing the process. All nuts are not created equally and patience pays!

Don't forget the microwave. It does a super job on all nuts, seeds and spices and even peppers. Nearly all American kitchens have microwaves and yet they recipes so often overlooks their many uses.

Indeed. Also nuts and seeds can be toasted in a toaster over, which saves you from heating an entire oven for just 10 minutes of baking! Just be sure to watch them closely, and when they start browning on top, turn them over so the other side can toast (turning over hot nuts can be hard-- either stir them gently with a spoon or put on an oven mitt and roll them over by hand, depending on how round they are-- don't worry if you can't get them all flipped-- 1/2-2/3 is enough)

Thank you for stating in such a straight-forward manor how to toast nuts. Most recipes that call for toasted nuts do not tell you how to get them that way.
