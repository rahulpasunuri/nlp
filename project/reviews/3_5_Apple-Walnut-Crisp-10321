Disappointing, but not terrible. I made the crisp as directed except for adding brown sugar to the apples instead of granulated plus the zest of a half a lemon in addition to the juice and a little bit of nutmeg. I used Fuji apples because that's what I had on hand. This simply did not come out of the oven as delicious expected. I didn't like the crust (dry, thick, crumbly) and the apples were soupy and bland. I poured a bit of non-fat half and half on it and it tasted better, but not really worth the calories. It had zero carmelization and none of that butter-apple flavor I adore in other crisps. If my step kids don't eat it, I'll throw it out.

My new go-to apple crisp recipe. I love the combo of oats and nuts. Macs are definitely best in this recipe.

I love this recipe! I cut down the sugar to 3 TBL brown sugar and added 1/4 cup yellow raisens, dash of Nutmeg, and 4 TBL soft fig spread. It is delicious.

Have been making this crisp for years and EVERYONE loves it! Couldn't find the recipe this am -- was in a panic but found it on line! The best crisp you will ever make...not too sweet just right.

I used Pippin apples which I prefer for baking. Granny Smith if I can't get Pippins. Another time, I'd use less sugar. I'd add a bit of cloves as well. My guests really enjoyed it and it is definately going into my personal favorites.

As another poster suggested I added 1/8 tsp nutmeg and substituted brown sugar for the white. I also followed teh suggestion and baked for almost an hour to get the top really crisp. Absolutely wonderful!

I made this for the guys at hunting camp in Colorado. Instead of walnuts, I used pecans and added dried cranberries, then served it with vanilla ice cream. They loved it so much, they wanted me to cook another one for breakfast!

This one put my sister's recipe to shame. I needed to bake it a bit longer though, to get the center just right.

I am an apple crisp freak! I have wonderful childhood memories of apple crisp at a restaurant on Nantucket. I have been searching for years for a comparable recipe. This is the first time any recipe came close to being as I remembered. The previous reviewer is correct. The topping comes out a bit like a granola bar. The texture is fabulous. I didn't have rolled oats so used Instant Quaker Cinnamon Roll flavored oatmeal and cut down the sugar and cinnamon. Results were surprisingly wonderful.

When trying this recipe I thought that the apples needed more flavor and therefore added 1 cup sugar, 1 teaspoon cinnamon and 1 teaspon nutmeg plus 1/3 cup of flour (the same mixture I use for my apple pies). This gave the apples a more apple pie like taste which was good. My mother and husband loved it!

The best apple crisp ever...filling not too sweet and crispy topping. added 1/8 tsp nutmeg and used brown sugar in apples instead of white. Cooked a little more than one hour to get the carmel syrup taste in apples and top really crispy with apples very soft.

Had some aging apples hanging around so I decided to make this. I was pleasantly surprised! Simple, tasty comfort food. Froze individual portions, then defrosted and heated them up when friends came over. Very good topped with high quality vanilla ice cream.

Didn't love this one, will keep looking for an apple crisp recipie. Topping was not the best and apples didn't have enough flavor. Salvaged it by putting caramel sauce on top, but was disappointed overall.

I had a bunch of red delicious apples that weren't crunchy anymore so I used them. SO simple and delicious with vanilla frozen yogurt! I even used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 all-purpose to make it more wholesome. Although next time I will use 1/2 the walnuts called for.

I have made this a few times and am always VERY happy with the results. I use McIntosh apples, omit the nuts and serve with french vanilla ice cream. As my husband and I say, this one's a keeper!

This was an excellent recipe! I would definitely make this again. The topping is very similar to a granola bar, which makes a nice crunchy cover to the warm, gooey apples.

Added grated lemon peel to the apples and it made it quite zesty. Substituted brown sugar instead of granulated sugar. Have prepared it 3 times and my family keeps requesting it.

This is a great crisp recipe, quick and easy to prepare and very kid friendly as well as appealing to adults, which is not always easy!

A nice easy recipe. I used red delicious apples which aren't the best for baking but I still liked it. The nuts in the topping gave it a nice crunch and flavor.

I thought this was a great recipe - I tried it for the first time when a friend made it. I am not that big of a fan of apple crisp, but I really enjoyed this one! My husband really liked it too.

This was very tasty, but not quite what I expected. The topping sort of resembled a granola bar. Still, it was delicious warmed up with vanilla ice cream. I agree that raisins might also be good on top.

I added a half cup of raisins that I had soaked in Cointreau for an hour, and substituted walnuts with macadamia nuts. Very tastey!

The recipe was really easy and tasted great, even after a couple of days. Best when warm with vanilla bean ice cream - yum.

My family loved this. There is plenty of topping and it stayed crisp even after two days. I put a little cinnamon in with the apples, but the recipe is perfect as is. So easy!
