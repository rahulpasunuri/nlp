Following and mixing some suggestions from other reviewers, as well as making my own changes, became hard to rate this recipe as it is. But, it end up pretty good for an Indian style no-special occasion dish. As others, I really reduced the butter (used only 1 tbsp), added 1 tsp toasted cumin seeds, used vegetable broth instead of water, brown rice and used curry paste. Here is the deal: I used a yellow sour curry paste (Maesri brand found in Asian markets). I used only 2/3 of a 4oz can and added to 2 cups of broth* and it was a 4-5 spicy. The taste was great, but if you are sensitive to hot dishes, use less of curry paste or stick with the curry powder as in the ingredients list. I was out of fresh ginger, so I used 1tsp dry ginger. Also, added 1 shallot to green onions. Used snow peas instead of frozen peas. * I use a no-salt added broth and it is super rich in taste, so I usually mix with water. the 2 cups I referred is exactly 1 c of veg. broth + 1 c of water.

This is an easy and tasty weeknight dinner. I also enjoyed the leftovers for lunch. I did make a few tweeks, however. I used grapeseed oil instead of butter to cut down on saturated fat and increased the spices (1/4 c. diced ginger, 1 T. garam masala, 1 t. toasted cumin seed). I also added a can of drained chickpeas with the veggies, rice and broth to make it more of a satisfying meal. With these adjustments, the recipe is a keeper!

Doing the tips mentioned here came naturally (stock instead of water, *tripling* the curry). What I substituted was brown rice and green pepper. Also, less butter. Came. Out. Great. Topped with a variation of Epicurious' Red Curry Peanut Sauce but great on its own.

Very easy and quite tasty. I made it in one 5 qt pot, as I doubled it. Also used 2 can chicken broth. Didn't have ginger or lemon peel, but used curry, tumeric, cumin, red pepper and garam masala. Reduced butter to about 1.5 tablespoons. Served with lentil shelf-stable indian packages from Trader Joe's. Added pinenuts for extra crunch - no cashews on hand.

I thought this was really good. I think it would be even better with chicken broth instead of water. It reminded me of a dish at I like at a local Indian restaurant. Next time I might add some currants or cashews. Definately a keeper.

Not a one-dish dinner. I used chicken stock instead of water and curry paste instead of curry powder. The result was an Indian flavoured rice pilaf that would make a nice bed for Tandoori chicken along with a something a little sweet like fresh mango salsa.

This was just a ordinary pilaf- no really great taste. I would increase the curry powder if I ever make it again- I wont though.
