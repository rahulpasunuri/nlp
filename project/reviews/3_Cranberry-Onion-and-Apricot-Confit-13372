Try 1/4 red-wine vinegar, and substitute red wine for water. Increase sugar to 1 cup.

A savory alternative to conventional sweet cranberry sauces. Next time, might cut back vinegar with balsamic/lemon to curb strong vinegary flavor.

a little too vinegary, even though I used slightly less than the recipe called for (after reading a review!) oh well-- the very best cranberry recipe of all is cranberry chutney november 1987 gourmet p. 312.

My husband, who doesn't usually eat cranberrry sauces, raved about this recipe so I'll definitely be making this agian. I did, however, find the vinegar a bit strong, but that may be a personal preference.
