I make this a couple of times per summer and it is truly a crowd pleaser of a salad. The ranch dressing recipe is outstanding.

I made this for dinner last night for my husband and I. I made 1/4 the recipe and there was still enough for 4 people. The dressing is a little on the bland side but could easily be spiced up with some red pepper flakes or ? There's a LOT of dicing/slicing!!
