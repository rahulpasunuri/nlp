Straightforward and deceptively delicious. My go-to salad for any occasion.

Not much flavor to this salad. Maybe it would have been better with some chicken added to it?

I've made this salad several times now, it is straight forward and fabulous. I added 4 cloves of roasted garlic to the vinaigrette, and added fruit to the salad. The first time I used blood oranges, LOVED IT! Next time I didn't have the blood oranges available so I used fresh pomegranate seeds, which was almost as good. I recommend this salad anytime! I do agree with a previous review to toss the salad right before serving as the lettuce does tend to wilt quickly. Enjoy!

A refreshing. delicious green salad! Simple but memorable with the palate cleansing fresh mint. I had served this salad alongside Barbequed ribs, and a side of Tagliatelle with Sun Dried Tomatoes in a fresh basil cream sauce. Many compliments from the guests. This one is a keeper. NOTE: the salad wilts quickly once the dressing is added, so be sure to add it last minute.

Made for Easter lunch. This salad got rave reviews from other foodie friends and kids. I wouldn't change one thing about it. So refreshing.

Yummy! I made it with hydroponic lettuce, which was delicious. I've used the dressing on lots of salads. Easy to make and very light.

best salad ever. Great clean salad, but you can add things to do it too. I've made it with grilled chicken breast, dried cherries, pine nuts & shaved Parmesan.

I added a little honey to the dressing to cut the vinegar a bit...a really tasty unique salad to be served with everything from flank steak to roasted salmon.

I'm lucky to have fresh garden mint sprouting now. I made the salad as directed and it was wonderful. It will be a great salad on a hot summer day. Very refreshing.
