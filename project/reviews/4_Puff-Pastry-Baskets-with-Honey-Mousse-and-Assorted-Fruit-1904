I have made this a few times with rave reviews each time. I have served it using pre-made puff pastry shells sprinkled with sugar and allspice before baking and it turned out great. Not to mention what a time saver. I have also served the mousse and fruit in layers using a crystal glass instead of the puff pastry. I topped it with the sauce and it was a light and beautiful finish to our meal. No matter how you make this, it will be a hit with your guests. Enjoy

This was delicious and received great compliments at a Spanish themed dinner party. I did not make the puff pastry baskets, but instead made cup-shaped tuile cookies, edges painted with chocolate. The buttery and delicate cookie was a devine combination with the mousse, sauce and fruit. The presentation was a class act (if I may say). Used strawberries, kiwi and blackberries.

Everytime I make this I get raves! It is a bit involved, but it can all be prepared in advance and then assembled right before serviing. Also, depending on the season, you can use whatever fruit is available (try peaches & berries in summer)
