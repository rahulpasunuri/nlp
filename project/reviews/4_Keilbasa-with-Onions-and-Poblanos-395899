This is very tasty. I added a serrano pepper to the mix for a little extra kick.

It will be hard to do sausage and peppers after making this recipe! It was so easy and the taste of the poblanos that much subteley better! I just love Kielbasa and have another way to prepare it. Served with a TJ's salad and sauerkraut with brown sugar and crusty bread. The simplicity was great but the flavors complex! Loved this!
