This works well as a gluten free cake. Really delicious using packaged gluten free flour. I took another reviewers advise and gave it a try. Followed the rest of the recipe exactly and everyone loved it!. Did make my standard cream cheese frosting which is half the cream cheese and butter and an additional cup of powdered sugar-but I like it more like frosting and less like cream cheese.

I made this for Thanksgiving, and it got more attention and rave reviews than anything else. It was really good the next two days, too. It will be in regular rotation from now on. As another reviewer said, it's a lot like carrot cake, but it is just different enough to make it special for the holidays. And the simplicity of it is another bonus. Highly recommended.

Best cake I've ever made! Moist, flavorful...excellent!

Got lots of "wows" at the Thanksgiving table this year. In the end this is really a version of a carrot cake, without the carrots. The coconut fools you into the bit and chew of a carrot and the spices are mimicking the classic flavors of a carrot cake. I was looking for something more pumpkin tasting. This wasn't it. However, it was very delicious.

This unique spin on pumpkin cake was a hit at Thanksgiving this year. I cut the sugar by 1/2 cup since the coconut adds sweetness, and subbed dried cranberries for the currants. I followed the frosting recipe as written and found that it made just enough to frost both layers with only a cup or so left over. It is a very thick frosting since no milk is called for, and it was a perfect match for the light, spongy layers. My family agreed that this recipe is a keeper.

This is a light, delicious cake! I followed the recipe for the cake as written except for the sugar - I put in only one cup, and for me, that was just right. For the frosting, I followed the advice of others and cut both the cream cheese and the butter to half, but kept the full 1.5 cups of powdered sugar. I sprinkled a little coconut on top for presentation, which looked nice next to the slightly orange color of the frosting. It was a hit, even competing on Thanksgiving with pumpkin and pecan pie.

I love this cake! I have celiac and it's good even with gluten free flour because it stays so moist. I always have more frosting than I need, but it is definitely delicious. My boyfriend's birthday is coming up and I was considering making these as cupcakes. Has anyone tried this?

I didn't give a rating, as I made a lot of changes to this recipe. I was looking for a cake the would taste as close as possible to my Mom's pumpkin pie. With the changes I made to the recipe, my family agrees that I met my goal!. The changes I made were to double all the spices (except nutmeg), and added 2 teaspoons of ginger and a 1/2 teaspoon of allspice. I used a full two cups of pumpkin. I omitted the coconut, pineapple and currents. I didn't use the frosting (I'm not a big fan of cream cheese), but went with a maple Swiss buttercream. The cake was wonderful and moist; it was a big hit.

I did not want to make a huge cake, so I halved the entire recipe. I used a muffin tin and I lined each cup with paper (12 cups total), I did not have coconut, currants, or pineapple, so I just used hald f can of pumpkin puree instead (I eyeballed half a can). I like clove, so I did up the clove to 1/4 teaspoon. I baked the cupcakes at 350 for about 25-30 minutes. They came out moist and delicious, albeit a bit more pumpkin-y than I would have liked. But they were still very very good. I haved the frosting recipe, too (and added a touch of pumpkin to it, as well-- about 1 Tablespoon). Then I put the frosting in a ziplock sandwhich baggie and cut a tiny corner off so that I could pipe the frosting onto the cupcakes. WARNING-- the frosting is extremely delicious. You may end up licking the bowl! Overall, a very good recipe for fall. Fast, easy, and delicious.

This was a big hit at Thanksgiving! Delicious and not overly sweet. My only changes were skipping the currants and the pumpkin from the frosting (I forgot to set some aside and didn't want to open a whole new can for just 2 tablespoons). The recipe made way too much frosting, though; next time I'll halve it (although it was delicious, and I'm not a huge frosting person).

I make this every thanksgiving and it is soooo good. The only thing I change is I use unsweetened coconut flakes. One year I made it with a maple buttercream instead of cream cheese frosting, and that was also fantastic. Heck, this cake, just by itself, would be fantastic.

A lovely recipe. I threw in some chopped pecans. There was a little extra pineapple,coconut, frosting, and pumpkin puree; so I mixed a tablespoon of each with some frosting and decorated the cake. Licked the bowls clean! Yum. I'll serve the cake on Thanksgiving.

This cake was delish. I did not use pineapple or currants and instead used chopped up candied pecans that I had and garnished the top of the cake with candied pecan halves. It turned out incredible and everyone raved about it.

Great pumpkin cake! I also made some changes and did not add the pineapple, coconut or currants and it's still delicious. I used 1 cup granulated sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. Baked in a bundt pan. Just made half of the pumpkin frosting which is fabulous. I've made this cake three times in the past couple weeks and have gotten requests for it.

This was delicious! I made a few changes: used fresh pinepple that I finely chopped, did not use currants, and baked it in a bundt cake pan. I used a different vanilla glaze, but next time, I won't use any frosting/glaze, as it was a little rich with it. The cake stayed fresh and tasty for a week.

I modified the recipe pretty heavily, so perhaps shouldn't review it, but I wanted to let others know who might be in the same boat. I made this at the last minute with what I had in the house, so I did not use pineapple or dried fruit because I didn't have any. Instead, I put in an entire 15 oz can of pumpkin. I also used unsweetened coconut instead of sweetened. Forgot to save pumpkin for the icing. I didn't have layer cake pans so I just made one large cake, which took longer to cook, and I used a half-batch of icing. It came out fantastic!

Wow, we love this cake at our house! I made it for a dear friend's early December birthday and loved it enough to make it for our Christmas dessert. I will make it again this fall for sure. Moist, flavorful, terrific.

This cake is delicious. I modified it some, maybe it's not the same cake but this modification was successful. I'm making it again twice this weekend for other gatherings. I used half butter, half oil. I used about 1/4 cup less sugar. I also used organic ingredients where possible. Also was generous with the spices. Really generous- fresh ground. Used 1/4 cup less pumpkin as I feared it too moist otherwise. Then used half the butter and cream cheese in the frosting, and a little more pumpkin.- I took it to Girls' Night Out, and they asked if they could take home leftovers!

Wow! This is a delightfully moist and light cake. I used raisins instead of currants since that what was in the pantry. The recipe provides ample frosting to cover the tops and sides of the cake. Wonderful flavor!

very good...moist cake, which is very important to me. I substituted the canned pumpkin with baked kobacha squash which I added just a touch of brown sugar. When I added the pumpkin to both the cake and the frosting, I was a bit more generous. Delicious. Definitely a keeper. mmmm.

Very good cake. Used with fresh pumpkin puree (halved sugar pumpkin baked in oven with some water in the pan) rather than canned. My puree may have been more moist than canned, as the cake was quite moist and a bit dense, and had an almost bread puddingy quality. Very well liked by a discriminating group, ages 2 on up. I also substituted dried cranberries as I couldn't find currants on short notice - I thought they might be out of place, but they were good. SImilarly, my suspicions that the coconut and pineapple would be weird in the cake were unfounded - it melded nicely. I definitely do not agree with the reviews that say to add more powdered sugar to the frosting, unless you want it sickly sweet. As is, it balanced the cake nicely.

The cake was good, not great. Moist to the point of being fragile. The spices were not quite evident; the same for the pumpkin. There was way too much frosting. The frosting recipe should be cut in half. It was very similar to a carrot cake. With all that being said, my husband loved it. Next time I will substitute roasted pecans for the cocoanut and perhaps increase the spices a bit.

This cake has just enough spice. The pineapple is a nice compliment to the flavor and adds good texture. Instead of currants I used cranberries because I couldn't find currants at my grocery store. Also, for high altitude bakers, I added one extra egg, a tsp more oil, 2 tbsps more flour, and about 1/2 cup less sugar. The cake turned out moist and fluffy (it gets too dense otherwise).

I'm about to make this recipe for the second time. It is a wonderful cake. The frosting is amazing. So fluffy and not too sweet. The cake is subtly flavored with pumpkin. The addition of coconut, pineapple and dried currants is wonderful. Definitely give this a try!

Loved this. Made this for Christmas dinner. Tastes a little like a carrot cake but the frosting is not as cloying. Will defiantly make this again and pass it on. Omitted the currants as I already passed that aisle in the grocery before I remembered them. Tasted great w/o them! Used waxed paper instead of parchment. Worked great. I also frosted the sides for a more elegant look.

This was very tasty, but I'd make some adjustments if I made it again. 1) I'd leave out the coconut, which I think added a bit of a weird flavor to the cake. The pineapple blended well, but the coconut adde some tropical notes that just didn't make any sense in a winter cake. 2) I'd add more pumpkin. It was a very good cake, but it didn't taste pumpkin-y enough. It could have easily been mistaken for a carrot or spice cake. 3) Frosting needs way more confectioner's sugar than the recipe here indicates. I added about an extra cup to the batch - otherwise it's too buttery and not sweet enough.

This cake was fantastic. Perfect sweetness and very moist. I would recommend making it a day before to give the flavor time to develop a bit. But unfortunately we only had two pieces left to test that theory out. I almost had a disaster without using the parchment paper, but managed to keep the cake from pulling apart with some careful handling. This one is going in my permanent repertoire.

I made the cake layers but a different frosting. The cake layers were soooo moist and delicious. I froze them and then defrosted a few days later and nobody had any idea. They tasted totally fresh. The cake sat out on the counter for 3 days and was still super moist. Definitely a keeper. I didn't have sweetened flaked coconut so used unsweetened. I think it would be better with the sweetened like the recipe calls for. Just a tip for those of you trying to get all your ingredients at someplace like whole foods... you'll need to stop at a regular grocery store for the coconut.

I tried this cake for the Friday after Thanksgiving when all our guests had had their fill of pie. You could have heard a pin drop as our friends dug into the first bite, and then licked their forks of the rich creamy frosting. The second bite elicited a complete round of compliments and sounds of "Mmmmm" filled the room. Definitely a keeper - and the baking itself fills the house with the wonderful spices of the end of year seasons.

At first taste, my guests assumed they were tasting carrot cake. They were pleasantly surprised to learn that the flavor was pumpkin. The cake is a classic that I will make again and again. The frosting is fabulous. Yes, it makes a large quantity, but it's wonderful on cupcakes. It's been a long time since so many guests asked for the recipe!

Very yummy, the icing bowl never made it into the dish washer as it was licked clean. I have to say, I liked the fact that the icing was not too sweet. I did cut the quantity by 1/4 and it was a huge hit.

This is a good cake and the addition of pumpkin to the frosting is a nice variation. However, this recipe makes far too much frosting for the cake. I iced the entire cake very generously and still had leftover frosting. I didn't think the frosting was sweet enough as written so I added an additional cup of powdered sugar.

I absolutely LOVED this cake! I just made it last weekend and I will be making it again tomorrow. It is very moist and flavorful. I used fresh steamed pumpkin instead of canned.

This cake was very good. It was moist and had so much flavor. My family loved it. The only thing I did wrong was not wait for the cakes to completely cool, and the frosting melted a little. I will definitely make this one again.

Moist, delicious and a huge hit at a dessert party. I used pureed roasted sugar pumpkin rather than canned. Agree that frosting recipe makes too much. Given prior review, I cut the recipe by a fourth and still had enough left over to frost another 1/2 recipe of pumpkin cake. Could probably cut frosting recipe in half.

Rating: 2
The cake was fantastic--after a serious revision. I halved the sugar and used brown instead of white. This gave the cake just the right sweetness. I added an extra 1/4 c. flour to fix the consistency with the omitted sugar. The frosting is fantastic; not too sweet, but there is also waaaaaaaaay too much of it! I threw about a cup and a half away, and there was still too much on the cake. I would half the frosting recipe and save the money on the extra stick of butter and pacakage of cream cheese. But, overall, a tasty cake with those revisions. I will make this again.

Made this cake instead of the traditional pumpkin pie and it was a huge hit all around. Super moist with a nice spice plus the currants were a great treat. Probably don't need quiet so much icing.
