I intended to only make the cakes, not the sauce. But so many people raved over the sauce I went ahead and made it too. It was delicious, but I thought it overpowered the delicate flavor of the crab cakes and scraped it off. (Have to admit I ate it separately with a spoon.) As for the cakes, the touch of cilantro in them was excellent.

This is the best crab cake recipe. Rave reviews from 6 people last night. Used fresh Dungeness crab. Used Panko bread crumbs. Doing again, would reduce amount and add more egg/water mix. Sauce is outstanding and perfect complement

Awesome sauce. I use this sauce for another crab cake recipe on epicurious. Used sherry instead of sake.

very good sauce - will use with other fish as well. if no sake on hand, dry vermouth works well. i always keep some on the shelf; it's a good substitute for wine, sake, etc.

I admit that I made the "Ruby Tuesday" crab cake recipe, more crab, less filler than this one, but was looking for a sauce to go with them, and this fit the bill. Great heat, good flavor.

Oh my... these were fantastic, and so easy! My family loved every bite!

My goodness....this sauce is exceptional. I did use Sherry instead of sake as I did not have, however this is the second time I did it this way, absolutely awesome. Did not change anything else. What else can I put this sauce on? I used frozen crab cakes this time, but made another from a diffferent recipe. This sauce will always be in the back of my mind to put on something that warrants it.

love the sauce, so simple, so perfect with the crab cakes

I served these as appetizers and did not accompany with the sauce because they were moist and flavorful enough without the it. My guests loved them. Use Panko; reduce the amount of cilantro and use lemon juice instead of water to wisk the egg into. Season with Old Bay seasoning and squeeze a bit of lime juice over each cake.

I made the sauce to go with some frozen crab cakes from Costco and I was extremely pleased. Highly recommended. I used a chardonnay as it was the only white wine on hand. I served the crab cakes on top of some butter lettuce and sprinkled some cilantro over the sauce. One of the most delicious sauces I've ever made.

My husband requests this quite a bit. I agree that the ratio of crab to crumbs needs to be adjusted. I made a double batch last weekend but used just 1 1/2 c. breadcrumbs, and left out the cilantro. The sauce is the yummiest part. I know friends who order crabcakes from Maryland and make the sauce to go along with. Can definitely make ahead without frying for an easy appetizer with guests.

The crab cakes might be fine, However I would add some green pepper, and consider cilantro optional. Omit this most disgusting sauce. I am a very adventuresome cook and I love sour, and or hot but this was too sour. I can't think of anything I would serve with this sauce...yetch, just bad.

I added all the egg mixture and it was still not moist enough to stick together. The darn things fell apart in the pan even though I was really careful and packed them tightly.

Yes, use dry sake - whatever inexpensive sake is available at your wine/liquor store. I made the sauce to serve as a dipping sauce with mini crabcakes (crabcakes with herb salad on this site) - the sauce was awesome, all my guests raved!

My fish monger did not have any fresh crab, so I substituted 2 cans of albacore tuna. Omit the breadcrumbs and substitute the cilantro with chopped celery. Fold in 1/4 cup mayonaise being carefull not to break up the lumps of tuna. Do not fry the mixture. Serve between two pieces of wheat bread and wait for the compliments to roll in. The best crab cake recipe ever.

Great Recipe! I used fresh bread crumbs and had to be very careful cooking them because the cakes had a tendency not to hold their shape. I will try panko next time - the flavor of the sauce was fabulous but a bit on the thin side. I will reduce it a little longer next time.

This recipe is awesome! I followed it to a T. The crabcakes are very moist and full of crab in every bite. Don't change the sauce in any way, it's the ulitimate kicker! My guests raved! A must try dish!

Delicious crabcakes-so nice to eat crab and not a lot of filler. Found 2 tbs egg mixture to be perfect-kept the cakes light. Sauce was awesome.

I made the crabcakes with a few substitutions. I used 1/2 green onion, and 1/2 diced celery. I also used all the egg. I used a different sauce with chipotles and roasted red pepper.

I found the recipe to be perfect. The cakes were moist and I too followed the other suggestions and used the panko breadcrumbs. I made my crabcakes smaller and had eight instead of four. The sauce was heaven and mine reduced right and it was thick. You just have to keep letting it reduce.

Excellent recipe. Added a touch of mayo. For a quick and tasty sauce, add some of the hot chili garlic sauce to sour cream and thin with a touch of milk or white wine.

great recipe... I modified it a bit and didn't put the celery in and used panko instead of the regular bread crumbs. I served it at a dinner party and everyone loved it.... I took the advice of one reviewer and served it with mango salsa which was delicious!

Like other reviewers, I used Panko, Japanese Bread crumbs. I also found I needed about twice the specified egg/water mix to get the mixture to bind -- although I used probably more than 8 oz of crab, coming from a large crab in the shell. Also, I served on steamed spinach--my wife's recommendation--which was great with the sauce. Anyhow, it was outstanding. I didn't have any problem reducing the sauce -- it wasn't thick, per se, but it was just right. I let the cakes sit, formed, for about 1/2 hour, which I think was a good idea. I cooked the cakes in fairly hot oil, which gave a good browned surface. I hope you like them as much as I did! Cheers, David

The crab cake was delicious-i too cut back on the amount of bread crumbs,and just wet my hands to hold them together a little better. the sauce however never thickened for me, so that was disappointing, the taste was good but too liquidy, i wasn't quite sure what ingredient was suppose to thicken the sauce, oh well will try it again, my guests loved it!

I was disappointed with this recipe - the crabcakes were so dry, they had the consistency of styrofoam! However, the sauce is unbelievable - guests were eating it with a spoon. I will definitely make the sauce again, but my search continues for the perfectly moist crabcake...

This recipe is a real hit. Its true, everyone loves it, the sauce is divine!

I have made this dish several times. Each time for guests it gets a big WOW. I plate in on white large salad bowls. This dish is gourmet restaurant quality. If fresh crab is not available, Costco has a canned crab, slightly pasturized - it is like fresh and works well. I use a small bit of cold crab on top as garnish...the hot and cold crab is a nice contrast together. WOW - WOW.

I made some alterations to this recipe and it came out to-die-for! I cut the bread crumbs down to half and when I rolled the crab cake, I coated the outside in bread crumbs. Also, I used panko (Japanese) bread crumbs, which are a little courser. I also added minced jalopeno pepper for a little kick and sprinkled some Old Bay seasoning into the mixture. Got rave reviews! I repeated this recipe, the second time substituted chopped shrimp and my guests could not stop mmmmmmming. Also, give it a little extra cilantro.

Great recipe. The sauce is delicious!

To save money, I used canned crabmeat. It's still not cheap, but the results are the same. I was a little nervous when I started making them, because they seemed to fall apart a little bit while frying. Despite their not so perfect appearance, I brought these as an appetizer to a dinner and received rave reviews. I would definitely make these again.

I added more crabmeat because there seemed to be too little of it in comparision to the large amount of breadcrumbs called for. All in all ~ FANTASTIC. Will make again!

Excellent crab cake full of crab. Use fresh dungeness crab for the sweetest flavor. My husband doesn't even mind cracking all the crab to get to the results. Use the dipping sauce sparingly, can overwhelm the delicate crab flavor. A new favorite.

I don't know what the big deal is on this recipe. I found them to be rather bland. At the last minute after having made half the cakes and tasted them, I scrambled to throw in ingredients from another recipe so as not to waste the crab. Perhaps I did something wrong because too many people concur that this was a great recipe.

Rating: 3
These were a huge hit at Christmas, probably because the crab was so good. I needed a little more egg to hold them together, which didn't seem to impact the taste. The sake is amazingly strong in the sauce, which wasn't my favorite, but again, my guests adored it.

I too made this recipe years ago. I got it out of a magazine, and I'm thrilled to see it here, because I lost it. It was fantastic! Of course, this coming from a huge cilantro fan. But you really didn't taste the cilantro too much, it was a perfect blend.

I made this years ago and we loved it - so happy to find it at Epicurious! We find this to be the best crab cake, and love the sauce (we are spicy fans). Really great.

My Baltimore-born husband grew up on crab cakes, and he claims this version is the best he's ever had. I have made this recipe several times at his request. By the way, fresh crab meat is the only way to go.

The crab cakes were very popular, but I had to add more egg for them to hold together. The sauce, on the other hand, was not so popular. The general concensus was that it's too strong for the crab.

The crab cakes were delicious by themselves -- you can do better with just plain lime juice than with the chili sauce. Nobody at Christmas dinner liked the sauce. Use fresh crab meat -- the canned ones do not work. Use one extra table spoon of egg in order to hold the crab cakes together better. This is a flavorful recipe. Really enjoyed it.

"The most flavorful crab cake I ever had". A quote from a guest at my Christmas party. Took a while to prepare, but well worth the effort. The sauce was a perfect completment.

Out of this world!!! My personal preference, however, would be to omit the sauce, as I felt it masked the wonderful flavor of the crabmeat. These were some of the easiest crab cakes I've ever made, and won't hesitate to wow future company with it.

I first made this as an appetizer for a dinner party months ago and our guests still rave about them! Make sure to use either fresh or Japanese bread crumbs -- otherwise they are just not the same.
