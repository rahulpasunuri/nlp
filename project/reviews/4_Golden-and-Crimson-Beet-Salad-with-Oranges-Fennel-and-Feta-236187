YUM! YUM! Agree with the comments about the vinegar. Used sherry vinegar as it has more bravo to it and used more than suggested. Roasting beets is easy. Just need to do it well in advance of needing them and wear gloves when you slip the skins off. It is well worth it for the flavour boost over boiled. Can I say yum! again?

Very nice recipe, made it for Thanksgiving, and it was the surprise hit of the evening. Everyone, including beet haters loved it. One of those recipes with way too many ingredients and way too many steps, but it comes together nicely. I'll make it again, but frankly the yellow beets ended up turning red when mixed with the red beets. Next time I'll use one or the other. And like some others in here, I agree it needs just a bit more acidity. Could not taste the balsamic at all, and I even added all of the orange juice from trimming the fruit. Still no acid. I used French feta which is creamier and milder. Added a nice richness without too much salt.

Quite a bit of prep work required and I don't think the roasted beets added much over the basic orange, fennel, feta salad. Subbed toasted pine nuts for hazelnuts and served along side arugula. Needed a bit more acidity.

I made this for a party and doubled the recipe. I didn't realize how time consuming all the steps in the prep were, especially with the oranges. The hazelnuts also took a long time to toast on a skillet so that the husks would come off. Overall, the dish turned out delicious. It was a big hit even with those who didn't previously like beets. People were begging for leftovers. If I make this again, I won't double the recipe, will probably use fewer oranges and hazelnuts.

This was a huge hit at a Thanksgiving dinner - everyone from ages 19-72 loved it! The modifications I made were: red to golden beet ratio of about 4:1, white instead of the standard balsamic vinegar, a blood-orange flavored EVOO, and half the amount of feta. All other ingredients were the same as in the recipe. This is definitely a keeper recipe, although next time I'd probably boil the beets rather than roast them -- I find it easier & quicker to peel boiled ones than roasted ones.

This was fantastic! Made it for a family gathering and everyone loved it. I added walnuts instead of hazelnuts, which were on hand, but that was the only change made. Perfect as is!

Great beet salad especially for non beet lovers. The hazelnuts add a nice texture and the cheese dresses it up.

I'm not a fan of beets. Never was. But this recipe has changed me! I changed the recipe quite a bit since I didn't feel like going to the grocery store, but it came out very well! I liked the mix of textures in this salad along with the sweet from the orange and the sour from the balsamic. I ended up just using golden beets, the mint, the Italian parsley, didn't have hazelnuts so I toasted up some almonds, didn't have fennel so I used some celery (and grated some dried anise seed into it), didn't have a shallot so I used a little bit of yellow onion, didn't have feta so I just sprinkled with a good helping of cotija cheese. Maybe next time I will stick to the recipe better for better results, but all in all this was a beautiful, tasty, and healthy salad!

Fairly easy recipe with good results. I think the dressing needs more orange flavor and I will add some zest next time I try it. The feta cheese and nuts are a must-they add a wonderful dimension.

I generally do not consider salad a meal but this one is filling, gorgeous, delicious and very original. I made it with goat cheese once instead of feta. It is very different but good both ways. I think blood oranges would be excellent in this salad too.

This is a fantastic recipe, despite the fact that the feta seemed to subdue all the great, fresh flavors. Will serve it without feta next time and will try walnuts instead of hazelnuts. This is one of my all time favorites.

This was tasty and probably quite healthy, especially since I added the blanched beet greens, but the taste didn't knock my socks off. If I roast beets, I'm more likely to make Roasted Beetroot (Beet), Blood Orange, Red Witlof (Belgian Endive) and Asparagus with Orange Oil from this site. Still, I might make this for variety.

One other tip; age of balsamic vinegar makes a big difference. First made the dressing with 18 yr old vinegar and thought the dressing was too sweet. Made another batch using younger balsamic vinegar which was much more tart. Combined the two and it was just right. A really nice salad!

Delicious salad. Didn't have hazelnuts on hand so I substituted pecans. Also boiled the beets to save time. Mint and saltiness of feta are a must (just like the popular watermelon salad); basil gives it a completely different flavor. I doubled the dressing to have enough for a bed of mesclun. Similar to a local restaurant's salad except they serve over arugula and use blue cheese and walnuts. This recipe is a keeper!

A fantastic dish. Made it for a large buffet brunch, julienned the beets instead of chunks. Did not find golden beets so used only red but the oranges were a nice contrast for color anyway. Lots of prep but most can be done in advance (beets, hazelnuts, chop herbs & shallots, and section oranges) then just put the whole thing together about an hour before serving to let flavors blend. A keeper!

Fantastic salad! I didn't like beets until this recipe came along. It's perfect as is. For people who don't like feta, I think goat cheese would be a good substitute. But the feta gets kind of absorbed into everything so you're not really eating chunks of it. We've now made this salad about 6 or 7 times. We made it for Thanksgiving too and it was a huge hit.

I love beets and had such high hopes for this recipe. All the produce was local and organic from the farmers market. This was good, but quite boring and average. Nothing was wrong with it, but it was nothing special.

I really want to like beets. They are so healthy and make for a beautiful presentation, so when I found this recipe that included golden beets, I was looking foward to trying it. This was honestly one of the best things I've ever made. There are only two of us, so I used two goldens and one red. I love the crunchy surprise of the hazelnuts, so next time I may use more of those. Otherwise, this is fabulous exactly as stated.

I made this salad again following the instructions more carefully. This time I cut the beets in cubes and topped off with the feta cheese. In my opinion, it was a waste of feta cheese as I felt it detracted from the flavors rather than adding to them. I also didn't like the beets cut in cubes. I much preferred it the way I made it the first time (see review) where I sliced the cooked beets, topped with the shaved fennel and the dressing poured over, and did not use any cheese. It was a much better presentation and blend of flavors.

This was SOOOO GOOD!! For the two of us, I just used one large golden beet. For the fennel I used a vegetable peeler as other reviewers suggested. I didn't use the oranges, hazelnuts or any cheese and still this was so very good!!

Made a couple of adjustments for my feta-phobic family... used manchego instead of feta, it was hard to find fennel bulbs and hazelnuts so used fennel greens and cashews instead. Cut down on balsamic and added a little shallot red wine vinegar so as to not make the dressing too dark and cut down on sweetness. The perfect salad.

Tons of prep, but definitely great results. I also used the blanched beet greens in the salad, which added great color and texture. I thoroughly enjoyed all the flavors in this salad and wouldn't leave anything out!

refreshing! i made it with basil and used a small amount of shredded fontina & asiago instead of feta and it was delicious; will try it with mint next time, and with the hazelnuts. it's very italian and a wonderful way to eat beets!!

The ingredients work well in every way. I prefered to slice the beets for plate-up, shingle the slices against a little watercrest. This arrangement give organization and makes it more appealing. I served this salad at a party I was hired to cook for, the guest left the plates clean and a smile on their faces.

Wow! Fabulous color and taste. I didn't have fennel, so substituted radicchio. Also used soft goat cheese instead of feta. Will make again!!!

A lot of work but SO worth it! I can't believe how beautifully all these strong flavors - herbs, shallot, beets, hazelnuts, feta - worked together. I did make a couple of changes: substituted basil for mint. I also kept the beet greens based on a tip from another recipe on this site. Just coarsely chop the greens, then blanch in boiling water for about 2 minutes, then drain and cool completely before tossing in greens along with the other ingredients.

Delicious! I used a vegetable peeler to get fennel very thin. Will make this over and over.

Very pretty and easy to make. The mint, in the quantity stated, is a must. I used about half the feta called for in the recipe. I thought that was enough because the feta was very salty.

I absolutely loved this. I used grapefruit, because I didn't have oranges and lime juice, which gave it a tangy flavor. Very nice salad! Thanks.

Great flavors and very refreshing dish! I serve it with a piece of grilled chicken for a nice light summer meal. I used pear infused white balsamic vinegar and fresh basil (instead of mint). Substituted pinenuts for the hazelnuts. Fresh juicy oranges are a must for this to be right. Beautiful presentation.

Superb! I couldn't stop eating it! But that's Ok, because this is a very healthy low calorie recipe. I had to substitute almonds for hazelnuts, and canned mandarin oranges for fresh orages, because that's what I had on hand. neverthe less, it was great, and I will make this frequently!

I agree that this was fantastic. I used all red beets that I peeled and cut into bite size wedges prior to roasting them in olive oil. When they cooled to almost room temp, I combined with the other ingredients. I omitted the parsley and subbed cipollini onion for the shallot. I let the salad sit for about 1/2 hr for the flavors to meld. The flavor combination of the beets, fennel, mint, orange, feta and hazelnuts was great. We don't generally like fennel at our house, but it really worked in this salad. I might serve over mesclun next time.

Used all red beets, used dried mint, skipped parsley. Boy, was this good!

Definitely a "WOW" dish. I used pre-cooked refrigerated beets (red only) and just roasted them in foil with salt and pepper for 30 minutes to perk up the flavor (dry with paper towels to reduce slippery-ness and definitely wear gloves...). I also almost forgot to add the hazelnuts, and they really round out the flavor of the dish. I used a veg peeler to get the fennel really thin and tossed the whole thing with a bag of butter leaf salad mix (make a little extra dressing). I only used about 3/4 cup feta. Every single scrap of salad was eaten by 5 people as a 1st course.

Well, almost beyond compare. Of special importance here are the oranges: they must be juicy, very flavorful and a bright orange in color. (A colorful presentation is important here.) A trick I learned in the (somewhat lengthy) preparation of this dish is to quarter the oranges first, then peel them; this is a better way to remove the pith (or whatever the white inner skin is called). Use seedless oranges if possible. Other ingredients may be adjusted to taste, although I liked (as did guests) the subtleties of all the flavors: fennel, mint, parsley, shallot, beet and the taste of orange against basalmic vinegar. Very nice. A crowd pleaser for those with sophisticated or adventurous taste buds.

Excellent! A lot of flavor and texture going on which meld beautifully with the citrus vinagrette. Didn't find gold beets but the orange provided the contrast. Great for a holiday table!
