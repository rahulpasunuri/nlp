I made these with plums instead of pineapple - the spices were great, but the plums had to be peeled after cooking (skins burst). I sliced each half without slicing through the top, and fanned two halves out on the plate (as for the Poached Pears with Mascarpone on this site). Dollop of sweetened mascarpone in the middle (don't sweeten with this syrup - it caused the mascarpone to curdle!), some green garnish and a drizzle of syrup around the slices. Beautiful!

Cinnamon overpowered the taste of the super sweet pineapple. No one liked it.

Oh my, words cannot describe how delicious this is! Every pineapple should be treated this way. My 12-year- old son, who only eats about 9 foods, said this was good enough to bottle and sell. And the syrup is so outstanding it really should be eaten by itself with a spoon, or perhaps a straw.

I made this for a night watching Shakespeare in the Park. Amazing! I cut down the sugar to 1/2 cup and will use even less next time. I saved the cooking liquid and blended it for cocktails.

I have served this several times and always have rave reviews, sometimes I will serve it with a dollop of coconut sorbet which marries nicely with the flavours of the pineapple. Very easy to make.

This is a good way to enhance a not-so-great pineapple. I didn't have fresh ginger, so I used some crystallized ginger and it worked well. Good over oatmeal, ice cream, etc.

Sooooo good! The pineapple was already awesome to begin with (lucky pick from the store), but infusing it with cinnamon, lemon, and ginger made it all the more heavenly. It was the perfect complement to tonight's Christmas ham. The best part, however, was the leftover syrup. Do NOT discard this stuff. After everyone left and the kids were put to bed, we mixed it with some sparkling water, squeezed some lime in it, and YUM! On some other night, we plan to try it with rum and/or vodka. Also, for the person who had difficulty peeling the pineapple, here's what I do - 1. Slice off the top and bottom. 2. Stand the pineapple up on end, and quarter the pineapple lengthwise. 3. With each quartered section still on its end, slice off the core. 4. Lay a section peel side down and with the knife blade parallel with the cutting board, use a back and forth sawing motion to slice off the peel. As you're sawing, press the peel down against the cutting board to help separate the peel from the fruit. 5. Then with the fruit still sitting on the peel, slice the fruit crosswise into chunks, without cutting through the peel. This helps the fruit stay cleaner (less contact with the cutting board and the little bits 'n' pieces that tend to come off the peel). I hope that makes sense.

This was delicious and very easy to make. Not to mention it made my entire house smell heavenly. I also used coconut extract in the whipped cream. I then put toasted coconut sprinkles for a prettier presentation. My husband and I are going to use the leftover pineapple in a pork stir fry dish tomorrow for dinner. Brilliant!

Ooooohhhh the cinnamon ginger syrup. You could put it on newspaper or shoe leather and eat it.

As a topping, I spun up some fresh whipped cream (1 pint carton) and at the end of whipping, incorporated 1/2 tsp coconut extract. Toasted some standard bag coconut flakes and at serving time, sprinked some over the top of whip cream dollop. Amazing! I've made this twice this summer for parties, and have given the recipe away to at least 25 people!

I made this because I had a pineapple that had to be used, it looked simple, and I had all the ingredients. It was wonderful. The hardest part was peeling the pineapple, so now I'll be getting a pineapple peeler/corer. Delicious alone, and fabulous with a small dollop or more of vanilla or coconut ice cream! I completely agree with the previous reviewer that says you have got to try this.

quick, easy, sweet but light hot-weather dessert. Guests loved it. I added some orange juice to the liquid to take a bit of the edge off the cinnamon.
