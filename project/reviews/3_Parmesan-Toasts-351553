I've made this recipe since the March 2009 issue was first released. My family loves these. The fleur de sel makes a huge difference from a texture perspective. The are particularly good with the Chicken and White Bean Soup with Herb Swirl from the same issue

I don't think these stand on their own as great Parmesan Toasts, but as an accompaniment to the Chicken Soup in the same issue they are great. We even had some the next day with the herb swirl on them and poached eggs. Nice!

I have tried this and was not satisfied. Too crunchy! I have a similar recipe that my family adores. One loaf Italian bread sliced. 1/4 Cup melted butter; 1/4 Cup Italian salad dressing; 1/2 Cup grated Parmesan cheese. Melt butter in microwave in measuring cup, add Italian salad dressing, then mix in parmesan cheese. Spread mixture by spoonfuls over 1 side of each slice of bread. Cover entire loaf with foil and bake 350 degrees for 20 minutes. Simple but WOW!

This was fair. I prefer to used melted butter mixed with garlic, salt and pepper,spread on thick bread, sprinkle parmesan over the top and grill in a cast-iron pan cheese side down until browned. Sprinkle with paprika and enjoy!

This was just ok. Not bad, not necessarily a "must make again" recipe. It turned out a tad too crispy - perhaps I needed more than a drizzle of olive oil. There's a restaurant in Northfield near me, called Capriccio's, they make the BEST parmesan toast. These don't come near.

Haven't made these but your comments about salt on top of the parmesan cheese. I think the difference is the use of fleur de sel which would not give it a complete covering of salt but a nice texture.

Salt brings out/enhances the flavor of foods, including cheese and fruit.

I won't rate this since I haven't made it and don't want to skew the ratings. However, I cannot imagine putting salt on Parmesan cheese!
