This recipe is harmless, but not particularly flavorful, as written. If you like mild pasta dishes and have some squash to use up, go for it. If you want something with a strong flavor or texture, you'll have to make some major adjustments.

I made this dish tonight and it turned out wonderfully. Changes I made: -Salted the squash -Less orzo (1 1/2 c.) -More garlic -More olive oil, no butter -Soymilk (about 2/3 c.) instead of cream -Dried parsley -Around 1 tbsp sweet paprika, added toward the end. Next time I will add more pine nuts and perhaps a little more parmesan.

I didn't rate the recipe because I have a strict policy of only doing so if I follow it exactly(ish). I happened to have yellow squash, cremini mushrooms and orzo on hand. Didn't make the sauce but did add pine nuts and crumbled feta as well as some garbanzo beans I cooked the day before. So GOOD!!! My husband is usually a whiny baby about most of the ingredients but ate it for dinner and then lunch the next day. Good warm or cold. Excellent recipe to riff on. Cheers!

Easy and great on a cold night. Next time I'll cut back on the orzo (maybe 1.5 c) to get a better proportion of pasta to veggies. I added dried thyme to give more flavor.

I have made this dish several times and enjoy it every time. I use butternut squash instead of yellow squash and shitake mushrooms. It's a favorite!

This is too greasy for me. It is shiny because there is so much butter and oil in it. Also,the flavor is nothing special.

I realized at the last minute that I didn't have the cream, so I had to use soymilk. It just never got very creamy. I would try it again with more veggies and less orzo, I think. I loved the pine nuts, but otherwise, it was a bit bland.

This was great, I'll definitly make it again. I made it based on what was in the house so here are my modifications. We didn't have any mushrooms, and it was fine without, though it would also be great with. Also, I replaced the heavy cream with plain soy milk. I ended up using about 1 1/2 c. soy milk, I liked the consistency a bit saucy. I also added a medium spicy red pepper from the garden with the onion. Next time I'll use mushrooms, and probably more onions.
