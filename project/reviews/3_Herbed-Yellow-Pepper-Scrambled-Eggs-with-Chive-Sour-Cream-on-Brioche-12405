I made this w/o the brioche for my husband for a Father's Day breakfast-in-bed. I used the chive sour cream for b'fast potatoes rather than the brioche. I am not a big fan of eggs, but even I was salivating while he ate them. I made them for myself this morning and subbed dried tarragon and they were just as yummy as they smelled a few weeks ago.

Very nice. I made with the apple w/bacon that this recipe ran with originally in Gourmet, and the whole breakfast was lovely. The eggs cooked up quickly and ended up a bit drier than I wanted, so I'd recommend watching them.

Married to a Frenchman, we often eat egg-dishes or omlettes for dinner (with une petite salade, and wine, of course). I made this dish for dinner, thinking the yellow pepper and terragon would have a nice flavor, and it was too light. Although I may make it for more of a brunch-like meal, this recipe is definately not flavorful enough for dinner.

Wow! I can't believe no one has rated this dish. -- I know it is quiet, in an understated kind of way, but make no mistake it is wonderfully good. The combination is masterful. I think this recipe is very well conceived and very easy to execute perfectly every time. This is the way I have always wished a scrambled egg would taste, so I sincerely thank the chef who created and shared this recipe.
