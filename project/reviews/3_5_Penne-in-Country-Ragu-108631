I made this for some friends who had visited Tuscany last year, and they could not get enough of it. It was so good, I wanted to make it the next weekend! Some notes- I also bumped up the sausage to 1 pound. As far as pasta goes, I used a paparadelle noodle, that I think went much better with the sauce. Next time, I am going to try homemade noodles. My husband also remarked that he would like to try it with spicy Italian sausage, so I will try that next time.

Best pasta sauce ever. We love it here - and so do all the friends & family we've made it for. I switch the wine to chicken broth ratios and just use 3buck chuck. I also bump the sausage up to a pound. Other than that, no changes (though in winter I'll use pesto rather than fresh basil). Recipe doubles really well and freezes perfectly.

This has become a staple dish in our household .. it is quick, easy and everybody enjoys it. As with a lot of others, I have added more wine. I usually use more sausage and perhaps a bit more garlic.

I did as many others have done--added more sausage. The flavors were wonderful! I've made many variations of pasta sauces and this is one of my favorites!

This was great. Added a little bit more sausage and used the Cotes de Rhone as others suggested. Totally satisfying. My kids wiped it out! We had it for a main meal but it would be perfect for a first course "teaser". Cheers.

This recipe was excellent--you could tell that a lot of time went in to making it. It may not be a great dish for company, but I would make it for friends on a casual night. I wouldn't suggest any changes.

I tweeked this abit to accomodate what I had on hand and it came out great. My husband and our friend gobbled this down on a chilly Connecticut night and the friend made off with the left overs!

Substituted pork sausages (butcher didn't have Italian sweet). As others suggested, added red wine (~1.5 to 2 cups). Used beef stock 'cause I already had some open and leftover. Fast, easy, delicious.

Yum!!! Everyone in dinner club loved this! The wine pairing was perfect! You must drink the red wine to complete this course. This is a keeper!

Company worthy!! Followed recipes with noted changes from previous reviews- more sweet sausage about 12 oz, lots more garlic, 1/4 t dried crushed red peppers, and 20 oz can petite cut tomatoes drained.

I made this last night, used mild itilian sausage, added a little more parm cheese, itilian spices it was really good. I will make this again, using mild itilian sausage, adding another can of tomatoes, black olives and would like to use a smaller type of pasta. This is a keeper !!!

I've made this 4-5 times and it's absolutely incredible. The only thing I change is that I use a lot more garlic (no such thing as too much!) The last couple of times that I made it, I double the recipe so that I could freeze the leftovers - and it freezes beautifully. This is probably my family's favorite recipe from epicurious so far.

Delicious exactly as written. Everyone really liked this dish. I would definately use sweet sausage in the future--I used all spicy sausage and it overpowered the dish.

This was a nice suprise. My family isn't big on pasta. At first, they didn't look very enthusiastic. But mid-meal, most said they thought it was great and said they would surely eat this again. Bravo! As suggested by others: I used 2.5 times the sausage, half the olive oil, reduced the chicken broth, doubled the red pepper flakes (my sausage was not spiceincreased the garlic and increased the red wine. I also used 28 oz of tomatoes, but forgot to drain them. I later had to drain off some of the excess liquid. Some suggested a little italian seasoning as well.

From man who struggles during his infrequent attempts at playing chef, consider this an enthusiastic recommendation. I made this recipe for a date and she loved it. I cut down on the carrots as someone suggested. Be advised, it is not a quick dish, but it is worth the effort. It was even better the next day as leftovers in front of a rented movie.

Wow this is so good! I was looking for a good ragu recipe and truly found it. I doubled the garlic and sausage using 1/2 spicy 1/2 mild. Also we don't really like romano cheese so substituted with parmigiano reggiano This will be a once a week dinner from now on!

I made this sauce for some very picky aunts and uncles. They loved it and went back for seconds! Even my kids loved it.

I've made this recipe over and over and it is one of our favorite uses of my mom's homemade canned tomatoes. I make it just as the recipe calls for only I use whatever wine I have on hand as well as Bob Evans Italian Sausage. I've printed this recipe out so many times and given it to people after serving it that finally I just made several copies of it.

I made a double batch and tripled the amount of sausage (half sweet, half hot). Added quite a bit of garlic and it was very good. Freezes well.

An absolutely delicious recipe! The only thing I did different was use spicy Italian sausage. Next time I will double it and freeze half in individual portions. It's easy but takes times. Highly recommended, especially if you love pasta.

Very good and easy. Used more garlic, and only put cheese in serving dishes.

WOW! So delicious! And, like the other reviewers, I doubled the sausage and used a 28 oz. can of Italian plum tomatoes, which is just a bit over 2 cups. This is a keeper....added to my favorites for sure. I processed the vegetables and the tomatoes, and followed the directions for cooking time. I purposely made it ahead so that it would be re-heated and it was outstanding! Needless to say, we loved it.

Wow - my sister recommended this recipe to me and I'm glad she did! It was wonderful, and my family loved it. I doubled the sauce, used a LOT of garlic and also used 1/2 spicy and 1/2 mild sausage. Was just as good (maybe even better) the next day. Definitely a keeper.

YUM YUM this is SO Good I increased the sausage and the tomatoes. I have made this 3 times now and its a keeper. My husband just loves it. I will be making this for my next dinner party.

I doubled the sausage and used more Chianti instead of broth. My family loved it, served with garlic bread with romano cheese and wine. MMmmm - delicious!

Delicious! Big hit in our family. Not that hard to make either.

Delicious! It definately does not need 4T of olive oil though! I fought greasiness the whole way through cooking. Nice change from a regular Bolognese sauce. Make sure you use the whole amount of veggies (esp. the carrots). Used the juice from the tomatoes as the additional liquid rather than broth... was excellent.

I used more chianti, garlic and sausage than required, and the result was spectacular.

WAY too much time and effort for just okay results.

Loved this recipe. Made according to recipe with a bit additional sausage. The secret to success is reducing the sauce to the right consistency and adding really good quality 2T EVO and romano cheese to the cooked pasta as per the recipe. I use Lucini EVO. Wonderfully rich and flavorful recipe. I paired it with a salad and the wonderful garlic bread recipe from the June Bon Appetit issue. Will definitely add this to my recipe file.

We really enjoyed this dish. Easy to prepare and we had most of the ingredients on hand. My son, who is 7, said, "this one's a keeper, Mom."

Delicious! Great blending of flavor! I made it a main dish & lightened it a bit by only using 1 tbsp olive oil to fry sausage, turkey sweet Ital sausage(1lbs, coin sliced), fat-free/low-salt chicken broth and serving the cheese completely separate for sprinkling only. I was also less fussy: only the carrots got "finely" chopped & I just used 2 14.5oz cans of regular DICED tomatoes (one drained,one not) & 1 14.5oz can of broth. I used 4 garlic cloves chopped, 1/4tsp red pepper flakes, about 4 packed tbsps fresh basil (20leaves)torn, and 1/4tsp ground pepper. No need to add broth 1/4 cup at a time or reduce for 40mins... after adding basil, Add grd pepper, cover simmer low for 10 mins, add the rest of the broth can (about another cup) then low simmer covered another 10 mins, remove cover & simmer med/low to desired consistancy. I went about another 10-15mins. Mix in with warm, cooked pasta. This is a recipe to enjoy, there's no rushing through it. It was a long process - about 1.5 to 1.75 hrs prep/cook time - but worth it and it can easily be made ahead & rewarmed!! It's probably even better the next day... tho' had no leftovers this time ;-) ohhh so yummy!!!

I am usually pleased with recipes from this site, esp. those that are well reviewed. However, I thought this was very, very average. Definitely not worth the time. Came out OK, but would rather make a good bolognese sauce vs. use the sausage. Unimpressed and would not make again.

This is terrific. I made it with Sweet Italian Chicken sausage which made it pretty low fat and it was excellent.

I made this with spicy Italian turkey sausage. Since I did not have any fresh basil, I put in a heaping spoonful of pesto (that I had made from fresh basil) and it was very good. I am going to make it again for company this weekend.

My whole family loved this. I used extra sausage (probably more like 8 - 10 oz.) and a little less carrots than the recipe called for. Will definitely make it again!

This is a great dish. I will make it again. Also the reviews are very helpful. I increased the amount of sausage and did not wait the whole 40 minutes. I served with a tossed salad, crusty bread and sorbet for dessert.

This was first rate. Followed some of the previous recommendations - used beef broth instead of chicken and increased amount of red pepper a bit. I also added more carrots and celery. Really good.

This dish is wonderful and easy to prepare, it just takes a while longer than expected- I ended up serving it without the entire 40 minute simmer because no one could wait. I will definitely prepare it again and again.

We loved this recipe. The sausage was incredibly subtle, might even increase it next time. But, in all, a great dish.

oooohhhhhhh so good. This dish is just like the fine foods I remember as a kid living in Syracuse, New York. One of the most Italian towns in the U.S. Do not change a thing, but do use the best sausage you can possably find and only fine imported Romano to top the dish at serving time.

This dish was easy to make and filled the house with wonderful smells. Next time I will add 1/4 to 1/2 tsp. pepper flakes and use beef stock rather than chicken. I served it with whole wheat spagetti which seem to mask some of the flavor. I should have used semolina based pasta.
