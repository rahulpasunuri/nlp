Have made these many times. Not sure I should rate this, b/c I changed it so much; but that's testament to this recipe's versatility. I used storebought basil pesto and subdried tomato pesto, gruyere cheese and left out the prosciutto b/c I had vegetarian guest. Spread half the puff pastry w/ red and half w/ green so after I rolled and sliced, they were very festive! DELICIOUS. I made another batch with green pesto and sliced pepperoni. Awesome little pizza puffs. The options are endless. I have even made these with dijon mustard, prosciutto and cheese. All so yummy.

This is a simple recipe to make and it really relies on the quality of ingredients you put into it. I made this yesterday with La Quercia prosciutto, a very nice Gruyere, and chopped fresh sage. They disappeared, best served warm!

Have tried these twice now - the first time with prosciutto and a mix of mozzarella and parmesan which were delicious and the second time with oven roasted tomatoes, feta and basil. Great recipe to alter however I found they took much more like 20 minutes to cook

So good and easy!!! Just can't eat one, more like 4 or 5. I used really good imported Prosciutto de Parma (which is not salty at all). Will defintely make again. May try some other versions (sundried tomato, pesto, & feta).

Used puff pastry and chilled 24 hours. I'm giving it three forks as most of the cheese fell out during slicing. I will make again but may mix the cheese with whole grain mustard to create a paste that will stick better.

I've made this countless times. You can use other meat/cheese/herb combinations, but the recipe as written is really the best. I always double the recipe to use both sheets of puff pastry, and freeze the extra 2.

Love them. My cousin turned me on and to her version as well. So now make half with the prosciutto and the other half with sundried tomato, pesto and feta cheese. Great combo--and actually like the new version even better.

The absolute best appetizer recipe. Made it at least 50 times over the years. Great do ahead. Make and refrigerate and then slice and bake at last minute. Make sure and use parchment or silpat---I learned the hard way. Best with a glass of champagne.

I have made this several times. even left out the prosciutto once for guests that were veggie. it can sometimes be a bit salty, I think it depends on the type of prosciutto and gruyere you end up with. but just makes you want more riesling to go with it! there are never any left over! definately use parchment paper

always a go-to appetizer.

I spread a little dijon mustard on the pastry, then the prosciutto, and then only used a sprinkling of good parmesan. They were fantastic! I put them on paper towels to take off the grease and my guests loved them. Not salty at all...don't use too much cheese. You can slice them thinner and turn over after halfway through the baking time.

Very easy and good! How could they not be good with this list of ingredients? They were very salty, though.

This was very good and have already given out the recipe. It was greasy, but worth the calories. I added some nice goat cheese in addition to the Gruyere and topped with a dab of bruschetta (Trader Joes), which helped with the saltiness

This was so easy to prepare. This would be nice to make for a dinner party for an appetizer because you could make it before company arrives and just put in the oven when you want to serve. It is very tasty and light. This is a lot nicer than buying an appetizer that is in the freezer section of your grocery store.

I've made these little buggers several times now, and they are a BIG hit. I usually sprinkle a little parmesan on top of the rounds just before popping them in the oven. I'm making them as appetizers for Thanksgiving this year!

I made these little pinwheels for a cocktail party, and they turned out great! They were a bit salty, but complimented the wine and cocktails nicely. I also made some with fresh Mozarella, diced sun dried tomatoes(in olive oil), and Italian seasoning. These had a wonderful flavor and were not as salty as the prosciutto and gruyere. Thanks to the tomatoes and italian seasoning, they had beautiful red and green coloring...perfect for holiday hors'd oeuvres! Overall, they were both wonderful and I will serve them both again in the future!

Perfect appetizer for entertaining. I've used various variations; added pesto or fresh sage and they were all delicious! I am constantly being asked for the recipe whenever I sere them to guests. Great make ahead item - just bake prior to the guests arriving. Super!

This is fun and easy to make and love the WOW factor I got when I served it, but beware - this is really salty. I love salt in my food but found myself reaching for something to drink pretty quickly. I felt I had to apologize to the guests. :( I would make again but not until I came up with a less saltier version.

Being short of time, I made 4 of these rolls a day ahead to take to an evening bbq thinking I'd have plenty. We baked the lot and not one was left. Very easy, tasty little bites, and great with a drink! Thanks to other reviewers for the sealing and cutting tips - I'll defintely make these again.

I made this for Easter dinner and it was a big hit - every last one was taken off the plate. They were easy to make up and stash in the freezer on Friday night, ready to bring over to my mom's house for dinner. Unfortunately, she needed the oven at 350 for her lamb so they weeped quite a bit (I used pre-prepared pesto instead of basil) and took longer to cook, but everyone loved them. I served a bruschetta topping along because I was afraid they would be dry, but there was no problem. I highly recommend for an easy, stress fre hor d'

Easy and as everyone says - great for a party as you can make ahead of time, keep chilled, and pop them in the oven right before guests arrive. I use a teaspoon of finely chopped rosemary instead which complements the gruyere quite nicely.

I agree with the other posts that this tends to be a bit dry. My solution was to add a dab of bruscetta to each pinwheel. I have also used a red pepper and eggplant paste from Trader Joes.

Rating: 3
I've found these to be a real crowd pleaser. Some tips that may help: Paint the outside of the seal with some egg wash before wrapping. Use your sharpest serrated knife to cut, but first use a flat edge of the knife to press on the seal- more effective than fingers. Use the flat side of the knife to pack the open end before each cut. If you've never used parchment paper, try it now! It's like waxed paper for the oven: your pinwheels will slide right off.

Very easy and very tasty. I always impress guests with these pinwheels. I've substituted ham and other types of cheese, and it's always good. Perfect for entertaining cuz you can prep ahead, bake and serve.

This was a big hit as an appetizer for our gourmet club. It has the potential for experimenting with other herbs besides basil. Make sure you seal the ENTIRE seam very well...to prevent the "wheels" from opening during baking. I had about 3 or 4 open where I got sloppy sealing the seam.

These were tremendous. Best served warm as they will soften if left to sit for too long.

Very easy to make. I used pesto innstead of basil as one reviewer recommended and I also used a mixture of mozzarella/parmesan instead of the gruyere cheese. Didn't need to chill for 3 hours, just froze for about an hour, which also made them easier to slice (use a very sharp knife). Big hit at the Christmas party!

Made this several times, always gets good reviews. I use pesto instead of basil, kicks up the taste a bit. Good and easy. I put the rolls in the freezer for 10 or 15 minutes before slicing.

These are high in fat and sodium but very good with drinks. Bland? No way, just be sure to use fresh sage instead of basil. You have to roll them tightly and chill thoroughly or they will fall apart. I recently cooked some I'd made ten motnhs ago, wrapped, and frozen, and when thawed they cut fine and turned out as well as freshly made.

Rating: 3
Definitely an easy recipe that delivers a tasty addition to a party table. The only change I made to the recipe was to add a layer of green olive pesto before layering the prosciutto and cheese. Guests really loved them!

Too bland for my taste! I went to my local Italian store & purchased great proscuitto so I know it wasn't the meat. I also found it hard to cut even though I used a serrated knife and refrigerated the logs for 8 hours.

I found this to be too salty. I think you could get away with about half the prosciutto. I have my own variation of this that I've made for years that uses sausage and is always a hit. I expected this to be too, but I had many left on the plate. I will try again though as it is nice to have a make-ahead hors d'oeuvres.

These disappeared off the platter faster than anything else on the Christmas Day hors d'oeuvres table! To my taste, they were a little bland, though. Next time, I'll use a stronger prosciutto, a stronger cheese, and much more basil.

The first time I tried this it was OK but a bit dry. The next time I put a small dollop of bruschetta on each pinwheel and the difference was dramatic. The juicy sweetness of the tomato contrasts perfectly with the flaky pastry and the spicyness of the bruschetta brings out the flavor of the gruyere and prosciutto.

served this as our only warm/hot passed hors d'oeuvre at an admittedly casual kentucky derby party---I'm awfully glad I made a double recipe at the suggestion of earlier reviewers because these things disappeared immediately! My 12 year old who was put in charge of baking and circulating them was actually upset and wanted me to run out for more ingredients so we could circulate another recipe's worth. Cut down on greasiness by not too much cheese (but freshly grated immediately before preparing), not too much proscuitto, but the highest quality of each--makes a big difference---plus, our horse won the race!

To Ana on 4/2/03 A suggestion for the saltiness you mentioned: 1. could be the prosciutto sat in pkg too long, but is still very good, but salty. You can by feeling the meat and you will feel the salt crystals. Simply rinse under water faucet and pat dry. Also, the Gruyere has 160 mg of sodium per 1 oz (1" cube). Emmentaler has 50 mg sodium for same size. You might want to try using half and half.

You might as well make about 6 logs of this, because people will descend on a platter of it and eat it in about 5 minutes. It's scary! And then they won't want dinner because they'll be too full. It's a great recipe an so easy, a dummy could do it.

I have been making these pinwheels for ~7yrs. The original version of this recipe first appeared in Gourmet, on the back page in the mid '90s. Anyway this has become a BIG favorite in our house and among our friends. The original recipe called for fresh sage instead of basil. Sage is more pungent than basil and in combination with the other ingrediants, makes a nice combination. Also, you can tell the difference in quality between American and authentic Prosciutto Di Parma. If you can find it, buy the imported. It is sweeter and more assertive.

Rating: 4
Fabulous hors d'oeuvre! I make this using the sage not the basil. You can also bake off a whole batch of these and freeze them in small freezer bags, say a dozen in each, and pull them out when you need them. Just heat in a toaster oven and serve. They keep in the freezer for about three months.

A note to Skyye. There are two different kinds of puff pastry available - pastry [thick dough] and sheets. Sounds like you used the sheets - next time try the pastry and you'll be able to make a fabulous dish. Dani :)

I made a "Skyye" version of this recipe and it was fabulous. I am rather clumsy with delicate dishes, so I spread out the puff pastry, but layered about 7 of them on top of each other to make a thick crust. I placed the basil out first on the crust, put a light layer of hunts tomato sauce over the basil, added the prosciutto, and then added the gruyere/mozzarella mix I made and baked with out rolling, as I said before, I am not graceful with delicate dishes. This modified version was great. My companion demands I make pinwheels once a week for dinner (too filling for us as an appetizer). Sometimes I add pineapple for a little flair. We love this innovative culinary delight! Cheers
