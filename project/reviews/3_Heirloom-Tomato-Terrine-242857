Am I missing something in the recipe? As far as I can tell, it doesn't explain exactly how to make the vegetable broth? Do you blanch the tomatoes separately or in the 8 cups of water for the broth. How long do you cook the broth? Do you remove all of the vegetables and just use the broth? I haven't made this yet, but I have alot of heirloom tomatoes this year and would like to try it. I am hesitant to spend the time on this without more specific instructions.

I used extra gelatin as others suggested. It's lots of work but made for a beautiful presentation. Guests were wowed.

Based on other reviews, we added an extra package of gelatin and cut the tomato in 1/2 inch slices. The broth was excellent and full of flavor. It looked beautiful when cut by 1/2 inch slices. We used fresh, organic, and local ingredients from the farmer's market, which makes a huge difference in the quality of the product. It was a hit!

I thought the broth to make this terrine was the best vegetarian broth I have ever tasted. It was a bit difficult to serve, but I thought the terrine tasted very good. I would chop up the tomatoes more than the recipe suggests and maybe add an extra package of gelatin to make it firmer. I also added some raw corn and cucumbers and that was very pretty.

A mess. With the tomato slices in the terrine, it falls apart when you try to slice it. To get any red color whatsoever, you have to use food dye. Otherwise the aspic is an unappealing brown. And to top it all...not much flavor in a very labor intensive broth. Unimpressed.
