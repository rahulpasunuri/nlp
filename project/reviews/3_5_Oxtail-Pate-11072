I braised some oxtails for Thanksgiving, and decided to try this recipe with some of the leftovers. Unfortunately, I didn't have quite enough oxtail, so I supplemented with some braised pork shoulder. I used the pork and oxtail fat instead of the butter, and used crushed white peppercorns instead of green. Otherwise, followed the recipe, pureeing some of the meat finely, and chopping some roughly. The result was full-flavored and extremely good. Highly recommended.

Great dish-- made it for a cocktail party and will definitely make it again.

Love it. I just simply love it. Some people are leery of 'oxtails,' so I just call it pate de campagne and tell them later what is in it when they have fallen in love with this rich meaty pate. Perfect in the winter for holiday parties. Cheers.

This is great. I made it as part of the 1993 Gourmet Christmas dinner, my personal favorite of the many Christmas dinners I have cooked.
