I simplified this, based on reviewers' suggestions. Started with S. Wallace Edwards' Surryano ham, then sauteed (skinless) chicken and two kinds of chorizo in the rendered fat. Cooked the vegetables with the meats and added canned tomatoes and chickpeas with the stock. Saffron gave it depth, and we topped the thighs with Nancy's Hudon Valley Camembert. If I make it again, I'll use boneless thighs. Served this with cheese polenta.

Bit confused here as the receipe requests Mexican chorizo which is REALLY different to the Spanish type used in soup in Spain and which this recipe is based. I added spinach as well at the end to bring it closer to the original.

This is a potentially excellent recipe, but much too complicated and with unnecessary prep steps. You can achieve the same flavors and results by simplifying. I used canned chickpeas, canned fire-roasted diced tomatoes, and smoked bacon ends. I cooked the veges together but did not brown as that would have reduced them to mush. Added chickpeas, tomatoes, and seasonings, while the bird cooked. Since the skin and bones are not used, I boiled a whole chicken in broth for 25 min. with a sprig of rosemary and achieved a tasty broth and easy to bone and skin chicken. Baked the chorizo in a toaster oven. Combined everything and let it simmer for 10 minutes. Mt.Tam is a great cheese and I used it, though any triple cream soft cheese would work. Wonderful results!

We cheated a bit, but this was one of the best stews I have ever made. We used ground chorizo (mild) with boneless skinless thighs and instead of the chickpeas we used cannellini in cans. We also substituted two poblanos for the one poblano and bell pepper (we're not big fans of the latter) and used shallots instead of red onion. One last cheat: we just used brie, and everything was fantastic. The house was one huge olfactory paradise! We cut a lot of time off because the cannellini were canned (we didn't add them until the end) and we used canned tomatoes. But it was still great. The touch of Amontillado sherry right before serving was really good as well. If you can, try this on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon and you won't regret it.

I have to admit I did not follow the recipe exactly but I was close. I loved cooking the chicken and sausage in the oven so it did not make the stew greasy. However, there was too much broth, definitely did not need 10 cups. I also forgot the cheese (even though I had bought it) but did not miss it!

OMG the closest thing to being back home in Spain. The only thing I added was Spinach to be more like mom used to make.

Amazing stew. Followed the recipe with loving care. We served six, and everyone raved! The next day we ate the leftovers, and we raved!

Made this with canned chickpeas and skipped toasting the peppercorns & cumin seeds, and it was still delicious -- nourishing & hearty. Also used reg brie & it worked fine.

Even though this recipe is delicious, for the amount of work and ingredients, it's not outstanding. Like other reviewers, I used shortcuts, such as canned chickpeas and tomatoes. The cheese was a nice addition, but not completely necessary.

This is a WOW recipe. I did make some adjustments for the sake of time and calories. Like others used canned chickpeas and high quality canned diced tomatoes. Also used chicken breast instead of thighs and Trader Joes roasted garlic chicken sausage and their bratwurst. Ok, those of you with your eyebrows up, if you can get your taste buds on it, do so. I'm not a bratwurst connoisseur but this tastes exotic in an curious South American way. You definitely wouldn't think "made in Germany". I started with Chorizo but threw it out after cooking it. Didn't think the quality was great. Uninspired. All other elements of the recipe I followed exactly. Heavenly. Even my picky teenage son "pounded" it.

This was a great recipe. I served it to non adventurous family members so I left out the jalapenos all together and it was just spicy enough. I also used canned garbanzos and they seemed fine. This recipe had more steps than the usual stew but you could taste the difference the extra time and effort brought so it was well worth the effort. I was looking forward to leftovers, but alas there were none as everyone went back for seconds!

Excellent recipe....a keeper! Prep. time is long...but definitely worth it. Like others I used canned chickpeas. I also simplified the prep. somewhat by just tossing some rosemary sprigs into the 'stewing' vegetables. I like my food spicy but I think I'd cut back by one jalapeno, also.

Fabulous. Omitted the jalapenos and it was still plenty spicy. Cheated and used canned chickpeas and it still turned out great.

This recipe is terrific. However, beware of the jalapenos. I love hot, spicy food but the two jalapenos I used must have been super hot because I had to fix the intense heat of this soup using raw potato before I served to guests. I'm not sure they added much to the recipe anyway. The pablano would probably be sufficient as there are so many other wonderful, subtle flavors in this dish.

We loved this recipe. I didn't use the chickpeas and it did need something else. The next night I did the toast with warm goat cheese and it was wonderful.

This was delicious. I made it for an informal dinner party and it was a favorite. I have to disagree with one of other reviewers I think the Mt Tam in stew was amazing and made this delicious (St Andre cheese is more easily available). A bit of steps but none hard and it does reheat well

This is really great. It does take a while to make, but it was worth the effort! I can't wait to have the leftovers tomorrow! Yum!!!

Save the Mt. Tam cheese for a nice slice of rustic bread. Yummy cheese, but it adds little more to this delicious stew than cost. Used fresh chorizo and extra pepper and the stew held up nicely for multiple lunches for a week!

A friend made this stew for a whole group of us. It was perhaps the best "stew" I've ever had. Complex flavors wrapped up into comfort food at its finest. It seems complex, as there is a lot of prep and many steps, but it's definitely worth it. Next, I'm going to try to make it myself.
