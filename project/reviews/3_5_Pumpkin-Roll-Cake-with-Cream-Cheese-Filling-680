I tried this recipe and i was vey disappointed. The cake broke into 3 pieces when i rolled it, but I ignored it. When I tried to put the filling on (which tastes amazing), there was way too much for that cake. The cake broke into pieces of cake and goop and was very chewy. I was very disappointed. I'm looking for better recipes.

This is a family favorite and I've been using this recipe for years now...LOVE it! I make the cake part in a stoneware jelly roll pan and it's always fluffy and moist. The only change I make is excluding the nuts since I'm the only one who likes them with desserts.

I had one of these the other night at a party and decided to try one for myself. It was good, but not great. When I was getting ready to make my second one, our son said, "hey, whats this recipe on the can?" On the Libbys Pumpkin can it gives a recipe for a pumpkin roll that is similiar to this, but much better. After making that one, I wont be making this one anymore. It really was heads and shoulders better than this recipe.

I have made this twice and I have to say that I love love love anything pumpkin: and pumpkin schmeared with sweet cream cheese and (I toasted my) walnuts, what could be better? But my cake on both occasions turned out rubbery and hardly risen. Don't get me wrong, I ate it. I was just hoping for a lighter, less eggy vehicle on which to deliver the yummy filling.

It doesn't mention in the recipe, but you can sprinkle the chopped walnuts on the cake before baking. I use a jelly roll pan, not a 9x13 pan. Try to make every Thanksgiving.

I have been making this recipe for 10 years. it is fantastic. I make many for gifts and they FREEZE beautifully. Here are some options. After pouring batter into pan sprinkle with very fine choppped nuts. Also, add a little white chocolate to the filling, a little less butter. Delicious

The frosting was fine, but the roll itself was bland & stiff. No flavor & not nearly moist enough.

Second time to make it, and I love this recipe! The second time I only had 2 eggs, so I threw in a bit of oil, and a teeny bit more pumpkin, and can't tell that I'm missing an egg, so that's a relief. The cake has cracked for me both times, even though I definitely let it cool completely. But the cake is so moist, I just sort of pinch the cake together to hide the crack, then sprinkle some powdered sugar all over it, and it still looks purty. This time I left the butter out of the icing to cut down somewhat on calories, and couldn't tell a difference. I've also been using pecans instead of walnuts, because I'm down here in the south. About to move to a place where it's nearly impossible to get canned pumpkin, so I can't wait to try it with my own roasted pumpkin.

This is such a simple dessert, very quick to make and serve. I've had this recipe in my archives for a while and decided to make it for our Halloween Party and it was a HUGE hit! Although my family and I love nuts, this is not a recipe we add it too. The cream cheese filling is so nice and smooth without it...the pumpkin roll simply melts in your mouth! It's not necessary to add more spice to this delicate dessert.

i tried this recipe, using a little less sugar, omitting the nuts and a whisked egg method, whisking over a pan of simmering water, (i think swiss rolls or roulades need this to maintain lightness), over simmering water makes the egg more stable, the sugar was also with the egg. the result was a light spong and well tasty.. a good one this and i will definitely be making again, made a change from the usual pie..

I've been making this now for about two years. All the relatives beg for it. I always omit the nuts and sometimes the cake part breaks when its rolling, but it still is always delicious. One thing that I do to prevent breaking, is completely cool the cake before rolling, even refrigerate it.

This was quite good, very moist and tasty, but definitely needs extra spices to perk it up. I added ginger, nutmeg and cloves as well as the cinnamon, and it gave the batter a lot more flavor. I also used pecans instead of walnuts. Overall, though, after those few adjustments it was very yummy and my family loved it.

This was ver bland, and I added extra spices. I gave it one extra fork than it probably deserved because it is fairlyy healthy (contains no oil in the batter) and is still moist. It is also very simple to make.

Whaaaaaaa! Pumpkin bread is hard to master - you have to get the spices correct. This recipe DOES NOT. Bland, bland, bland and I even added more -- an extra tsp on cinnamon plus tsp of nutmeg. I suppose I may try one more time with even more. It's moist but this recipe is BLAND!

Yum but looked a little funny...I think I rolled it the wrong way. Recipe says roll the long way when rolling in towel to cool. Didn't say otherwise so I did the same thing before I spread frosting...Oh well, it was long and skinny but still tasted great.

this is one of the best pumpkin desserts ever! before unrolling the cake from the towel, make sure that the cake is 100% cool, otherwise it'll fall apart when you unroll it to add the filling.

Everyone had seconds on this one! and it was even better the second day I thought. Had no problem with the roll splitting, although I did take the paper off immediately and didn't wait for the cake to cool. This is a great quick desert I think.

Rating: 3
I had the opposite problem with splitting apart. The 1st one was still warm when I rolled it and the 2nd one had cooled for several hours and that was the one that split. Nothing that you can't hide with powdered sugar and it was delicious! I used a bit more vanilla and substituted walnuts for pecans. This got rave reviews, even from my sister-in-law who isn't a 'cake person'. I also made a 3rd one with 3/4 sugar & 1/4 splenda (ran out of sugar) and it was good. I'll try that next time 1/2 & 1/2 to cut a little of the sweetness.

The pumpkin cake was nearly perfect (not too sweet) although the next time I make it I will add more spices...just the cin was not enough for me. I doubled the recipe and had a much easier time with my first roll as I let it cool quite a bit longer. The second roll was too warm and sort of split apart. I left out the nuts in the roll and added pecans on top then drizzled with thinned out cream cheese filling. Beautiful presentation sliced with a dusting of powdered sugar.

Rating: 4
This is excellent! I did brush the cake with a Glaze (3 T Grand Marnier, 1/3 cup sugar, 3 T OJ, reduce by 50% over med-low heat for about 3 min.) This added a brightness and moistness to the cake. I also added a few drops of orange oil to the cream cheese filling--fab! As recommended by others, I increased the amount of cinnamon, and used pecans instead of walnuts. Also, I rolled the cake from the SHORT end to have more sprirals and be "fatter" (there was only 1 spriral rolling it from the long end, and the cake looked skinny!).

Rating: 4
This is delicious and very easy. I make a couple of changes. I use 2 Tablespoons of cinnamon and 1 teaspoon of ginger. Instead of adding the nuts to the filling I sprinkle them on the batter before it is baked. That makes the outside prettier. I also beat the eggs for 5 minutes before I add the sugar and rest of the ingredients. I think this makes it lighter. It really is a crowd pleaser!

Rating: 2
This was a very tasty recipe, but the cake part was a bit thinner then I had thought it would be. I think next time I will bake in a smaller sheet pan. It also looks prettier if you pour a thinner cream cheese frosting on top then sprinkle with chopped nuts.

This is an awesome recipe that I make by request for every Thanksgiving and Christmas get-together. Because it is always the first to go, I sometimes have to make 2 for each gathering. This year, by DEMAND, much less a REQUEST, I have to make one for a Work gathering, my family, and for my in-laws. To give it an extra kick, sometimes I add a little bit of orange or coconut rum to the cream cheese. It comes out delicious!!!

I first made this pumpkin roll several years ago, and, by request, I now make it every Thanksgiving and Christmas. Served amidst the traditional pumpkin, pecan, and apple pies, it's always the first to go.

I love this dessert. It is best made at least a day ahead so the cake can soften and the cream cheese can harden. I omitted the nuts and decreased the sugar slightly. I doubled the recipe, threw it in a larger jelly roll pan and cut it in half. The longer it sits, the better it tastes.

This cake was such a hit at my dinner party! It's very moist and the pumpkin/cream cheese combination is unexpected. It's elegant-looking and has a great presentation both when presented whole at the table and when sliced onto dessert plates (I garnished it with mint leaves on either side which adds a nice touch). It looks like it is much more difficult to make than it actually is, which always impresses your guests and makes them feel special! I highly recommend it.

I've made this tried-and-true dessert every fall since 1996, but wanted to jazz it up for a dinner party. I heated some commercial caramel sauce and drizzed a puddle of it onto the plate first. It made the dessert look a bit more elegant. Another hint is to make this cake a day ahead, place the cooled roll in Saran Wrap and freeze it. Then 2 hrs. before serving, remove from freezer and slice into perfect sharp slices, which you can re-roll in Saran Wrap while they thaw. Saves time and the cuts are nice and clean!

I've made this cake before but had lost the recipe. I'm glad I found it again. Instead of putting vanilla extract in the filing, I use a butter-vanilla-almond combination, which is a lot better. I also put some very finely chopped pecans on the filling as well as on the powdered sugared towel. Honey roasted pecans or cahews are also good to finely chop and use.

This is a wonderful "kid friendly" recipe, (not too spicy), and just as popular with adults. The only thing I changed was cutting the powdered sugar in the frosting by about 1/4 cup. Otherwise, it was really a lovely cake.

I was leary of making a cake roll, because my mother has never been able to do it without it cracking. SHE WAS SO JEALOUS!!! I did it my first try. This cake is a good choice for pleasing people with different tastes. It has some pumpkin flavor, but to enhance it I chose pumpkin spice instead of cinnamon. I thought the filling was mild the cake was very fun and surprisingly easy to make. I had 23 guests for Thanksgiving and everyone liked it very much. There were no leftovers!

I'd never made a jelly-roll before, so I was a little apprehensive -- especially when I realized that my pan was 2" too big on both sides. I just added a little more pumpkin and a little more flour and crossed my fingers. It turned our great! Brought it to a christening and it was the only dessert that was devoured (unfortunately I had also made the other desserts, but....). Definately give this one a try. It's a lot easier than you might think!

I likewise reduced the sugar in the frosting and found the amount appropriate for thr cake. I also added 1/2 teaspoon pure maple extract and everyone loved it. The cake was gone literally in ten minutes. I also agree with the other reviewer and in the future will make 2 it was nearly enough with all of my guests prefering seconds. The log shape was also fun to decorate and I plan on making this again and again. Another thought,try adding a small amount of either lemon or orange rind to the frosting to make it a bit more tangy.

This dessert was such a hit! I was a bit skeptical, it didn't sound like anything special but the reviews were so great I had to give it a try. I made one for a Bunco game and didn't even get a chance to taste it myself, just heard how good it was...A week later, I made another one for a dinner party and finally tasted it and agreed with the critics! It's so simple to make...suggest 2 at at time though because there's more than enough pumpkin in one can of filling. Also, I went with the suggestion of cutting the amount of sugar in the filling in half, perfect!

Rating: 3
Delightful! After reading the other reviews, I also reduced the sugar by half. However, by the amount of filling it made, I think next time I will use 2 pkg. cream cheese and then the 1 cup of powdered sugar should be perfect. It's so easy to make, you should definitely try it.
