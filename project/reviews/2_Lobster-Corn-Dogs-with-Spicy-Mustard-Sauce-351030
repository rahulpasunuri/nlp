This recipe was such a disappointment. The taste was fine but there was no way I could get the shrimp lobster mix to stay adhered to the ice pop stick. I ended up scooping up the mixture tossing as much batter as i could onto them and tried turning into fritters. Kind of worked. Did the restaurant this recipe came from forget to include something?? I have no idea how you could ever get the mixture to stay on the ice pop stick. Too bad Bon Appetit doesn't test these recipes before they print them. It would save us time and money and we could concentrate on recipes that actually worked.

If you want to have a Lucy and Ethel moment in the kitchen... this is the recipe for you. Otherwise this recipe was a complete disaster. The lobster/ shrimp mixture was extremely runny- it had the consistency of a soup. After managing to form the goo into some sort of clumps, I placed them in the freezer for days, hoping they would firm up. After thawing out, they were much firmer, however not firm enough. When trying to dip them in the batter they completely fell apart, as the batter is thick and does not make dipping easy. Frying them was a nightmare... the oil became too hot and burned the outside, while the middle was still cold. This recipe left me with a complete mess of a kitchen and wasted lobster. Will not make again or recommend to anyone.

Corn dogs tasted great, the corn dog mixture got a little runny so ended making the 'dogs' we stuck them in the freezer. We started frying them and the first one was perfect, but we didn't have a meat thermometer so the oil got too hot so the second batch was a little cold in the middle, the third group was great though. will definitely make again. Never got around to making the mustard, but they honestly didn't need the sauce (though I bet it would be good).
