This is one of my favorite super easy weekenight recipes. The whole thing can be done in less than 45 minutes (note to reviewer from Malibu - the recipe "as published" only has you marinating the chicken for about 1/2 hour while you cook the pasta, at which point it is lightly flavored and not discolored). I agree that leaving the mangoes sliced looks/tastes better, the puree looks like baby food and masks the other colors.

i have not made the salad or mango puree, but i have made the chicken part of this recipe. i think it's quite tasty, and a good and flavorful way to eat chicken. healthy, too. i put all of the marinade in with the chicken to cook, and it makes a nice sauce (needs to cook, of course, for safety). wouldnt serve company, but it's a great middle of the week meal.

This recipe is a keeper. I served it the other night to guests from 4 continents (Asia not being one of them...too bad, could've gotten some good pointers!)and all loved it! The only changes I made were to roast the red pepper, add julienned cucumber, fresh basil and cilatro and served warm. Delicious.

i actually loved this dish, despite the fact that it required quite a bit of prep. good to make for a large group. i think pureeing the mangoes was perfect, and made it more of a sauce than if they were left in pieces.

This recipe, prepared as published, leaves me wishing I ordered take-out, instead. However, I think it has great potential with some minor adjustments that maintain the integrity of the recipe. I don't recommend marinating the chicken longer than 4 hours (I left it in overnight and it was overpowering). Since the marinade turns the meat an unpalatable color, I suggest grilling rather than broiling. This cooking method will impart added flavor and texture along with some camouflage. Don't waste your time pureeing the mangoes. They are so much more interesting visually if cut into 1/2 slices and the sweetness is a nice contrast to the bitterness of the watercress (by the way, I'd use only 1-2 bunches next time). Finally, reduce the amount of Dijon mustard to 1 TBSP and this salad is sure to become a warm weather favorite.

What a great meal. Easy to make, too; even my boyfriend who I'm in the process of teaching to cook pulled it off flawlessly!

This was delicious, and so healthy.Instead of chicken i used salmon, and i added some feta cheese at the end. My family loved it!

Wow! Delicious! I'll definitely make this again. A few things: 1) It makes twice as much mango puree as needed to completely drench the chicken. 2) I would break the pasta before cooking next time to make it possible to blend it with the greens. 3) Consider the leftovers - this truly makes enough for four hungry people. Leftovers will have to be cold or at room temperature or the greens will be wilted in reheating. 4) Since the recipe only called for 2 teaspoons of fresh lime juice I had half a lime left over. We squeezed it over the whole meal on our plates and it added a very nice touch.
