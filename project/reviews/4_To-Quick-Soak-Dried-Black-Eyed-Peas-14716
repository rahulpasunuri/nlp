I do this with all dried beans, It is a fast and wonderful way to get your beans ready for whatever recipe you are using them in. I first got this recipe fron one of Graham Kerr's cookbooks(Minimax Cookbook) and have been using ever since.

Years ago we soaked almost every type of bean. I just read that now it is better nutritionally not to do the long soaks. Gee I must say I feel kind of silly rating soaking beans!
