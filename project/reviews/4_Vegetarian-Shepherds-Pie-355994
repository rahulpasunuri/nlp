Fantastic! Made this for St. Patrick's Day for those of us who don't like corned beef and cabbage. Even the meat eaters raved about this. Only minor changes. Used 1 bag frozen pearl onions for ease. Skipped the seitan - don't like it - used 2 cups cooked lentils instead. Just made mashed potatoes using my handmixer and adding the 1/2 cup cooking water, about 3/4 cup milk and about 3 TBSP butter AND my "secret ingredient" - 1 1/2 TBSP dijon mustard in the mashers. Yum! The prep is really not that bad. Chop all the veggies in advance. Reduce the wine while you chop veggies. Then the cooking comes together in less than 1 hour. I will definitely make again!

Hands down the best vegetarian entree I've ever made for a party. It was a huge hit with vegetarians and meat eaters alike. It was definitely labor intensive, but very much worth it. The only deviation from the recipe as written was that I couldn't find seitan, so I used a soy based meat substitute. Truly delicious.

This recipe could have been good if I had not used the seitan. The flavor of the seitan overpowered the flavors of the rest of the dish. If I make this again I would use a different protein.

Vegetarian Sunday dinner. Followed pretty much exactly, including the stock. It's a joy to make, though I do not think the seitan adds. I would try tvp or maybe even a bean next time. The flavours are very reminiscent of a pot roast with thyme + wine. It's def a gourmet vegetarian meal. It is very much a stew. You could easily make it vegan too.

Excellent! I substituted some ingredients as well plus had a request from a Jamaican friend to make the topping with taro root mash instead of potatoes, which turned out nicely. I also added some roasted butternut squash and cooked yucca to the mix. Very nice recipe and very satisfying!

Although I did end up making some changes to the recipe according to what I had on hand, I liked the framework it provided me! I subbed the seitan for 2/3 cup cooked lentils, doubled the garlic, leeks and pearl onions with one onion, added some leftover butternut squash, and used buttermilk in place of the cream and milk. I know it's a lot of changes but I feel like the beurre manie and bottle of wine are the key to this!

Delicious! I didnt have seitan so I left that out. I also did not have carrots on hand, but used celery, sweet potato, cauliflower, zucchini, yellow squash, mushrooms and onion. I added some Parmesan cheese to the potatoes and added a parsley garnish on top. YUM!! This was the first time Ive ever had Shepherds Pie.. Since Im a vegetarian I could never find one without meat. This is a new favorite. Thank you!

Delicious! I signed up with Epicurious to say how much I enjoyed this dish. You can almost believe it's a "meat" dish, and the vegetables blend perfectly.

Outstanding! This is the second year I've made this dish for Christmas for the vegetarians in the family, and even the non-vegetarians can't get enough. It does take a little extra work, but the results are well worth the effort.

Great! Next time I'll cut the amount of potatoes in half. I used better than beef bullion instead of the vegie stock and reduced it with tomato paste and some of the wine. I also used the garden fresh fake beef tips. It turned out really well, I was nervous because of the couple reviews that were negative (I made this for Christmas dinner!) but they must have screwed it up somehow- I followed the recipie pretty much exactly and it came out flavorful and delicious. Left out the celery root.

I can't eat gluten so I used tofu instead of seitan, but I think next time I'll just use portobello, and I added grated cheddar on top before broiling. It was absolutely delish though. Start to finish it took about 3 hrs.

This is a keeper!! Instead of the pearl onions, I added lots more mushrooms. Start the potatoes right away so you don't have to wait for them. I don't have a ricer, so I just put mashed potatoes on top - just as yummy.

Yum! Made it today because I happen to have opened Cotes du Rhone wine last night just before I found this. As noted in comments by others, takes a long time (in my case, 1.75 hours without making my own stock), but it's mostly because of the timing as presented in the recipe. Surely, if you started reducing wine around time of starting mushrooms and started prepping potatoes as soon as possible after that, this could be reduced to closer to an hour.

I made this when my vegetarian daughter, who has celiac disease, was home on vacation. I used tofu instead of seitan. Several non-vegetarian guests were RAVING about how delicious it is. A winner with the carnivores, celiacs and vegetarians. Yes, it is very time consuming, but worth the time to develop all the flavors. Will become a staple in our house.

This is the best vegetarian shepherd's pie ever! I've tried countless recipes over the last 3 years and finally found one I will make again. My foodie husband went back for thirds!! It took me just over 2 hours to make, but was worth the effort. I used frozen pearl onions, Trader Joe's low sodium veg broth, and a whole bottle of cotes de rhone. It seemed really runny and thin so I added about a tablespoon of cornstarch and in the last 10 minutes of simmering it thickened right up into a lovely gravy. I was concerned how the seitan would taste since it came out of the package smelling like dog food. But the wine gave it a rich hearty flavor that was amazing. Warning - the seitan does not microwave well for leftovers. I might try to make it next time with tofu or tempeh. All in all a fantastic recipe that I'm sure will become a household favorite for years to come!

Delicious, rich, time-consuming. Made it in two days (stew one day, mashed potatoes the next), which made it a lot easier.

Rating: 4
This is very time consuming, but well worth the work; it is insanely good. This recipe is also good if you have vegetarians and meatetarians in your household. I made the stew without adding the seitan, browned the seitan separately and put it into one casserole dish, and then browned ground lamb and put it into a different casserole dish, and then just split the stew and potato topping between the two dishes. Both the vegetarians and the meatetarians in my house thought this was delicious.

This was fantastic! I used Morningstar Farms vege crumbles in place of the seitan because it's easier to find and I find the texture to be similar to ground meat. Otherwise I followed the recipe as stated. The flavors were so warm and comforting. If it didn't require as much work I'd make it every other week, but it's quite time consuming and uses a number of pots and pans. Definitely worth it if you have the time though!

I made this dish for a vegetarian guests and it was scrumptious! I used a full bottle of good red wine and boiled it down to the required amount. It has as incredible rich taste and gorgeous color following the recipe exactly. It freezes well for leftovers.

This is REALLY bland. A big disappointment, especially because it took so long to make! There are plenty of better vegetarian shepherd's pie recipes out there - skip this one!!

We made this (ok I did!) for Christmas dinner last December. And the children are asking for it again now that its getting near. So we will make it again! I am getting ravenous just thinking about it. The left overs were amazing. I am going all out on this one. Will make the stock this weekend - rather than the night before christmas. lots of work but worth it. Loved the seitan which was a first time for us. Gnna put a little extra cos its gets even tastier the next day! stellar! I am vegetarian and this is now a classic.

I adapted the recipe because I wanted to use what I had or what was in the garden and followed the basic recipe: butternut squash, pearl onions, 1/2 red onion, 1/2 sweet onion, carrots, fresh thyme (less than recipe), fresh rosemary (less than recipe), 5 peeled lady crabapples, 1/3 lb white birch mushrooms, 3 cups of vegetable and mushroom Better Than Bullion, 3/4 c frozen petite peas, 1/2 bottle burgundy (took someone's hint about less red wine), sea salt and pepper. Topped with mashed potatoes with milk and butter sprinkled with parmesan cheese. I made two pies -- for book club and the other for home. Rave reviews from both sectors.

This was so delicious, very rich and flavorful, even without the celery root (couldn't find it) and the seitan (not a fan). I used boxed vegetable stock, but next time I'll make the stock recommended in the recipe since everyone seems to love it!

this was wonderful and i'm not a vegetarian. my husband is so we tackled this yesterday. having done no preppoing in advance, it took us a very long time with lots of cleaning along the way. worth it, though. the celery root in the mashed topping is a must. used frozen pearl onions which had plenty of time to thaw on the counter while we were cooking - added them at the end when everything simmers together. ours came out as a thinner stew - would thicken a bit more next time.

Also wanted to add, it took me about 1.15 hours to make, start to finish. (Used pre-made veggie stock which saved time). As long as you read/plan ahead it shouldn't take super long.

This was great. As I'm not the biggest fan of Seitan, I used green lentils instead (cooked 3/4 of the way first before adding to the veggie/stock mix). Was quite tasty. Both myself and my carnivorous partner loved it.

Great recipe. Didn't have parsnips so just added a few extra carrots. Didn't have celery root either, so just didn't use it. Suggestions: for the onions, cook them in the wine while it's reducing. (haven't tried this one yet, but will) For the potato topping: infuse the butter with 2 cloves of garlic. Also, I did light sour cream instead of milk and heavy cream (I like the flavor better and the less fat). Just a great tasting recipe. Loved it.

This dish was super delicious. I served it to guests who were unfamiliar with seitan and everybody went for second servings. I agree with other reviewers about the recipe calling for too much wine, I used half of that and more vegetable broth (commercial version). Would also use a tad of dark miso if the broth needed a stronger flavour next time. It goes well with seitan. Will certainly make this again! A great autumn dish.

This was my first experience cooking with seitan. I purchased it already grilled with garlic and seasonings from my local health food store. It was remarkably tasty and combined with other ingredients tasted like portabello mushrooms. Noting one of the other reviews, I added only the butter to the potatoes/celery root and found the consistency to be perfect. The recipe was not too liquidy. I only rated this with 3-forks because I was uncomfortable with how greasy the stew was. If I made it again I would reduce the oil and butter.

We all loved this recipe (including our 2.5 year old). I didn't have any seitan, but it was a wonderful vegetarian stew (and we are normally fairly carnivorous). I agree that the winner is the stock, which I will use for other dishes in future, too. This took me less than an hour to make, aside from the browning on the top at the end, and is a delicious, cheap, and filling meal. Loved the mash with potato and celeriac, which will appear from now on as an accompaniment to other meals.

I gave this recipe an 8 on a scale of 1 to 10 where 10 is best. I felt that 1 whole bottle of burgandy was too strong. It was very hearty, and quite good. The sleaper in all of this is the vegetable stock which was absolutely wonderful. If I were to make this again, I would maybe use 1 cup of wine with the vegetable stock. The wine completely overwhelmed the flavor of the stock. I did use the celeriac, but the potatoes really masked its flavor - so I think I would omit the next time. No need to use a ricer - mashing is fine. I used about 1/2 cup grated cheddar & jack blend in the potatoes, and sprinkled picorino romano cheese on top before using the broiler to brown the top. Potatoes & cheese completely complemented the veggie stew. Also added 1/2 rutabaga, 1/2 turnip and 1/2 fennel to the stew. Very time consuming - but worth the effort.

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious and a real crowd pleaser. I was skeptical about the full bottle of wine and the beurre manie but they worked beautifully. We substituted corn (traditional in my mom's shepherd pie)for the parsnips, which added a nice textural note. I will definitely make this again, maybe with more 'shrooms and a little less seitan and omitting the celeriac in the mashed potatoes. Wonderful dish with a big "wow" factor!

I made this recipe for a friend's birthday. I modified it for one friend who is a vegan. The six others all eat meat and everyone really enjoyed this dish! It is really more a bouguignon than a shepherd's pie, but whatever the name, it is a delicious recipe! It is time consuming, but definitely worth the effort!

I followed the recipe to the letter and the result was gross! Unfortunately, I made this for Christmas dinner -- what a mistake! I'm a vegetarian and have made plenty of veggie recipes. This one ranks as one of the worst. I never should have made an untried recipe for a special occasion like Christmas. We ended up throwing the whole thing in the garbage.

I would definitely use this recipe again. It was a perfect addition to our traditional Thanksgiving meal. Now our mother doesn't have to fret over the vegetarians "starving". I made the stew part of the recipe the day before and the potatoes the day it was served and just heated up the stew before assembling. It was beautiful with fresh rosemary on top.

Just want to thank whoever suggested using SOYMILK instead of milk and cream making my potato topping so watery, it ruined the entire dish and I have to say it looked amazing until that. !!!!!!!!!!!!!! So disappointed...

I made this for a post Thanksgiving meal where one of the guests was vegan, and it was loved by all, vegans and meat eaters alike. To make it vegan, I used Earth Balance in place of butter and Tofutti cream cheese in place of the milk and cream, and they were the perfect substitutes. Didn't have time to make the vegetable stock, so I used boxed, but it was still great; next time I'll try it with the homemade stock.

Wow - I was a bit skeptical at first, but this was a rich, hearty and delicious shepherd's pie! While the recipe was time consuming, we split up the tasks and it was definitely worth the time and effort. The sauce had a vibrant flavor with the wine reduction. We used Quorn meatless grounds (in the freezer section) instead of seitan and it added great texture and absorbed the flavor well. Also used baby red potatoes (skins still on) for the topping and mashed them with a handmixer and that worked just fine. We're so glad we made it and are excited for leftovers!

Though it is time consuming it well worth the effort. I made this for my children who are vegan. Just substituted Earth Balance for the butter and soy milk. The dish is hearty and even the none vegan's at Thanksgiving enjoyed it.

This was very good, but needed a little salt and pepper in the topping. Or at least salt. Other than that it was rich and flavorful. Perfect for my vegetarian family's Thansgiving. BTW, made both filling and topping the day before, and everything came together quickly the day of.

Pretty good, but not traditional shepherd's pie flavors. And that's not a comment on the fake meat. Actually the seitan turned out meatier than I've ever had and the broth is deliciously rich and hearty. [The seitan and the broth would be great for a veggie "Meat Stew." I did use the leftover broth for a veggie French Onion Soup that was deelish.] I think this recipe just lacked carrots. Oh and you don't need to pass the potatoes through a grinder, just mashing them up any which way worked fine.

This is extremely time-consuming, but worth it. I substituted an equal amount of ground beef for the seitan, since I'm not a vegetarian -- delicious!

I loved this dish. I was looking for a something very special to serve my vegan guests at Thanksgiving and I think this recipe will do it. I Think maybe next time I might try it with polenta on top instead of mash potatoes. Overall, great recipe!

Sorry, I had to come back, as I recommended the shortcut of a Cuisinart for the mashed potato topping. This was fine for the first evening, but made the leftovers kind of gummy. Next time I'll use a potato masher.

I loved this! It was VEERY tasty, and good. Agree with the other reviewers that it was a lot of work--well worth the effort though. Made it for meat eaters, and they said they didn't miss the meat! I took a few shortcuts, and it still took me about 2 hours: I used store-bought veggie broth, just reduced it with a little wine and tomato paste to make it richer. I used frozen pearled onions. I used a cuisinart instead of a ricer for the topping. I used Morningstar Meal Starter crumbles instead of seitan. I think you could also replace this with rice or barley for the same "filling" effect. Will DEFINITELY make again!

This was a lot of work, but worth it. The stock is so good that I will make more and freeze it. I had trouble finding seitan and ended up using one 6 oz. package. That was all the dish needed. Also, next time I would make sure I used a really good quality wine, not too much tannin. This was also better the second day -- perfect for holiday cooking, to have the main course made the day before.

Although making the stock was time consuming it was well worth the results!I skipped the seitan and added extra mushrooms. Serving this to my "foodie" friends was a little nerve racking but it got rave reviews.
