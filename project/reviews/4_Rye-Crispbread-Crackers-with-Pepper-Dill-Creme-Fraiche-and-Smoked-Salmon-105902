Great crackers! I have made a lot of crackers and these were easy and delicious. Lots of fork prick marks, followed by scoring the dough before baking, made them easy to break into cracker-size bits.

Excellent appetizer. They were gone before I knew it.

I've made three batches of these crackers. Two weren't acceptable, but the third is getting closer to what I think it should be. Here are some pointers: increase the water quantity just a bit; add flour just until you can handle the dough (it shouldn't be too sticky nor too dry); after rising, divide dough into thirds, not halves. Roll out VERY thin (as thin as you can get it but still be able to transfer it to a baking sheet without tearing it). The flavor combinations of the smoked salmon, creme fraiche, dill, pepper and orange are inspired. These make a wonderful hors d'oeuvre. The crackers were a bit frustrating to make at first, but now that I think I've got a workable method, they're a snap.

I served this at a wine tasting to rave reviews. I used 2T full fat buttermilk to 1 cup cream for the creme fraiche, let it sit overnight and had no trouble with the consistency. Enjoy!

The crackers were great. I used the rye flour to roll out the dough so I could maximize the rye flavour.Next time I might sprinkle on some course salt and toasted caraway seeds before it goes into the oven. I also added a pinch of sugar to the yeast while proofing to get things going. I made the dough at night and put it in the refridgerator to cold rise overnight. Perforating the dough with the fork did nothing to help in breaking the crackers apart. I would sugest docking all of the dough with a fork and not wory about the two inch grid. As for the creme fraiche mixture-it tastes great but it runs so be careful how much you put on. I served them on a bed of dill fronds. It was beautiful. Whatever you do, don't leave out the grated orange zest. It was a perfect addition and made the flavours amazing. Try drinking aquavit with it.
