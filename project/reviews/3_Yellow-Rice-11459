I forgot to say: Cover the Dutch oven when you put it in the oven.

I stumbled upon this recipe trying to recreate a chicken dish that was one of my mother's party staples in the '60's. It worked! Delicious and easy. Here's what you do. Buy 3-4-5 lbs of chicken. I used legs and thighs, but I'm sure anything would work. Get out a big dutch oven, maybe 6 quarts. Brown the chicken in 1-2 tbsp of butter in two batches, 5 minutes a side. Remove the chicken to a platter, bowl, etc. Heat oven to 350. Spoon all but about 2 tbsp fat out of the pan. Gently sauté the shallot and garlic in the drippings until soft and fragrant, 3-5 minutes. Stir in the rice, turmeric, and salt. Get that rice coated in fat and spices. Stir in the chicken stock. Bring to a boil. Turn down, and layer in the chicken so it's relatively evenly submerged. Bring to a gentle boil and put in the oven. After half on hour, turn the oven down to 300 or 325. Cook another half an hour. Your dish will be done when the rice has absorbed all the liquid and the chicken is tender.

I have been making a version of this for years. I use chicken broth or stock instead of water. I also saute a little chopped onion in butter and add a small amount of red pepper flakes. At the end, I add chopped parsley. The color is beautiful with poached salmon and sauteed sugar peas.

If you want to make it a little more interesting, try adding 1/2 a teaspoon or so of freshly ground cumin along with the turmeric - don't add too much or there'll be no subtlety and be careful what you serve it with, but used carefully can be surprisingly good.

Did you try this by itself? It's a side dish you know. It's suppose to go with something. tsk tsk tsk

This was so boring and bland. It lacks a certain zest found in other store-bought yellow rice mixes. Very disappointing.

I was very disappointed in this bland, flavorless dish. I've tried it a few times with the same result: boring!

surprisingly good, with so few ingredients. probably doesn't need that much salt. :)

This is one of my favorite rice side dish recipes. It is low fat, easy to make, and goes with lots of things. I found the recipe a little salty for my taste, so I usually cut the salt by half.
