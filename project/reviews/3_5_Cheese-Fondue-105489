Made it the first time following the recipe and method/prep. Made it subsequently with a few alterations (improvements): adding several finely-chopped garlic cloves to the wine; dividing the cornstarch between the cheese and Kirsch; and adding a little freshly grated nutmeg. Very satisfying on a cold winter night.

This is the perfect, authentic cheese fondue recipe. I've tried others and always come back to this. I serve with french bread, crisp green apples, broccoli and mushrooms.

This is great. If you replace the wine with apple cider, it tastes great.

Fantastically easy and tasty. We added some Appenzeller cheese to this at the recommendation of the folks at our local cheese shop, and served with cubed crusty bread and sliced apples that we picked earlier in the day. Substituted brandy with a splash of maraschino juice for the kirsch. After we got to the 8 minute mark of simmering the consistency was a little loose so we added another handful of cheese... that did the trick. Will definitely make again. Will find a way to use more garlic next time, either by rubbing it on the bread or throwing a few cloves in the pot with the wine. Or both....

Ah. Sorry to all you folks who had trouble with this one, but it is absolutely authentic in every detail (even down to the garlic rub and Fendant). I've had hundreds of these from my Swiss relatives and this it the Real McCoy! Make sure the wine it very hot before you add the cheese, and allow all the cheese to melt (it will get stringy at first) before adding the cornstarch mixture. Substitute emmenthaler cheese with raclette cheese for a real treat!

Rating: 2
Eh, dissapointed. The cheese came out stringy and never fully dissolved in the wine mixture - like glue. Not that much fun. The taste could have also been MUCH richer for me, maybe we would like the garlic clove simmer method suggested by another reviewer. I made it exactly as written, to a tee, and was just a little dissapointed. For all that fat and calories, it better be darn near orgasmic for pete's sake!

Our combined family gathered today to watch the Redskins game, so I thought it would be nice to enjoy this great sounding fondue while we cheered on our team. I added caramelized shallots (from "Gruyere Fondue With Caramelized Shallots" on this site) to this recipe. It was outstanding! Wow! I'm always a little nervous cooking for my husband's kids. They repeatedly exclaimed that this was even better than their mother's cheese fondue. High praise indeed for a "step" mom!

I let the garlic clove in the mixture while cooking. It tastes great. I didn't have any swiss cheese, so I used old white cheddar, and it was simply delicious.

This is my second time making this fondue - great flavour but my cornstarch/kirsch just wouldn't dissolve into the cheese. The cheese was sort of stringy too, but we didn't mind that so much as it really tastes fantastic.

To temper the strong wine flavor, try letting it simmer longer. This will cook off the alcohol. Although, don't go too long. It will reduce the liquid and actually intensify it. Also, a milder wine like a Sauvignon Blanc would be great. The slight flavor of garlic around the pot's never quite enough for my family. I always throw in 8 or 10 whole cloves of garlic and simmer it in the wine before adding the cheeses. Even the kids fish for the soft delicious garlic cloves with their bread cubes at the table.

I followed this recipe to the t except coating the cheese with cornstarch before melting it like one of the previous reviewers suggested. It was amazing!!! Turned out exactly how my favorite fondue restaurant in the city makes it. Too bad for them because the will be losing my business. My boyfriend said I would make it again in a second if it weren't so fattening.it was the best dish I've ever made. It was so easy to boot.

I make fondue about 2 to 3 times a month, especially in winter. I definately would stick with kirsch versus cherry brandy (too much sugar)and if you can't find a Swiss Wine, Peter Lehman Riesling from Australia is the best match I've found. To add a little zing, I always add a bit of fresh ground pepper and a dash of Hot Hungarian Paprika. I also use a mix of Appenzeller and Gruyere. My husband loves this verson the best. As we say in Swiss, en guete.

If you're looking for an easy recipe that replicates the swiss fondue packets commonly found in gourmet sections then this is it. We thoroughly enjoyed the end result and have made it a number of times. Ignore the negative comments from those who didn't know what they were making; you need to consider the tastes of the ingredients if you haven't tried it. You can substitute brandy for the kirsch since it's very similar but once you start adding other kinds of cheeses and beer (???), as some have suggested, then you're making something entirely different.

Rating: 4
I was a little nervous making this after some of the comments below, but it did come together very nicely. Did use 2 tbls of cornstarch mixed with the cheese and 4 tsp kirsch. I would add cheese by the handful when the previous cheese had been mostly melted. It came together in about 15 minutes. Definitely do again.

I am definitely not a good cook, but I wanted to surprise my husband last night with this recipe. He was quite impressed. The cheese was a little bit stringy, but that didn't bother us much. I didn't use any nutmeg either, which could've helped add another layer of flavor. Other than that, it turned out perfect! I wasn't able to get any white wine at the store, so I used mainly a light beer in place of the wine (though I did use a small splash of red wine). Maybe this explains the stringy consistency, but the taste was great.

Rating: 4
Since my mother and I are not crazy about wine in food, I substituted 1/4 cup lemon juice plus 1 1/4 cups water for the wine. (I also omitted the kirsch, but would have included it had I had some on hand.) The result was very delicious; I served it with bread, carrots, celery, and yellow peppers. Tossing the cheese with 2 T cornstarch was the way to go (as other reviewers suggest).

I made this for New Years Eve for my family of four. The children, ages 8 and 10, didn't care for it at all (first time for fondue). I did use half emmentaler (sp?) and half gruyere as others recommended. It came out nice and smooth using the "cornstarch mixed with the grated cheese" method but I think it was the wine taste that turned them off. I wasn't that crazy about it either. I have about two cups of leftovers I don't know what to do with!

Fantastic! I made it for New Year's Eve and used the suggestion of another reviewer and mixed the cheese with 2 tablespoons of cornstarch. I also used brandy rather than kirsch. It was a HUGE hit and luckily I had more cheese because I had to quickly make a third pot. We dipped steamed broccoli, green beans, bread, apples and asian pears. All were delicious.

Made this tonight for New Year's Eve. The recipe served two people easily, although we were very full. We were out of kirsch, so I mixed the cornstarch in a little of the white wine, which worked well. Although it seemed creamy prior to adding the cornstarch/wine mixture, it really smoothed out even more with the addition. Our cheeses of choice were: Ementaler, Vacherin Friboureois, and Gruyere. We served the fondue with cubed bread and wedges of Granny Smith apples. It got rave reviews from my husband, not a bad way to start the new year!

I have made this often in the past. I finally started to microwave small portions of the cheese and liquid and then add it to the pot to speed things up and this seemed to work fine.

I have made this recipe several times and it always turns out excellent. Smooth and velvety. I took a previous reviewers advice to put the grated cheese in a ziplock, adding an extra tablespoon of cornstarch, and shaking the bag to coat the cheese with the starch. Adding the cheese very slowly, not too high of a flame, and using the zig zag motion to stir is the trick to getting it smooth. Aside from bread for dipping we had green apples, boiled fingerling potatoes, cubes of ham, steamed broccoli florets, and cornichons gherkins.

my mothers family is swiss, and we grew up with fondue as kids. (this recipe is about right) as garlic lovers, we sliced a bulb (yes a bulb) real thin and threw it in the simmering wine, then added the cheese. traveling across the country with my family (4 kids - and new fondue fans) last summer, we were pleased to see new fondue restaurants popping up (the melting pot). a celebration in a pot!

This is incredibly easy to make. I grated the cheese earlier in the day, which made the dinner-time prep seem all the easier. We also added some Appenzeller cheese to the mix. As suggested by other reviewers, shaking the grated cheese with cornstarch really seemed to help make a smooth fondue. Also, as noted by previous reviewers, a shake of nutmeg at the end of cooking added a depth that was missing otherwise. We also added a few shakes of cayenne...not enough to provide any discernable heat, but there was another layer of flavor that really was nice. We served the fondue with lovely crusty bread and crisp tart apple wedges. It served two people (we did eat a lot) but I wouldn't count on it to serve more than two without other items on the menu.

This is a great and easy fondue recipe. The trick of letting some remaining cheese get brown and crusty on the bottom is fantastic. But I don't know how this recipe can serve four people-- I doubled it and it served four people, and I could have even had a bit more. The one thing missing from it was grated nutmeg, which you should add in at the end.

This was awesome and so easy! At first I was apprehensive, since I've never made it before, but it turned out wonderful and tasted just the way I hoped it would. The stirring technique is definitally key, as is paticence. It was also super easy, so now I can eat it when ever I crave it!

This fondue recipe was absolutely delicious...and I had a potentially tough critic in my french boyfriend. He and everyone at the party demolished it and were fighting over the last bit of cheese at the bottom! I wouldn't change a thing...as far as the consistency, patience is a virtue. Give it a little time after stirring and it thickens up perfectly.

Just GREAT! I followed the advise from below on tossing the grated cheese with 2 TBSP of cornstarch before adding it to the hot wine and stirring in a zigzag motion to avoid balling up the cheese. It worked perfectly :-) Of course I doubled the amount of kirsh called for. I served this at New Years celebration and it was a BIG hit. This is definitely a keeper!

I made two fondues for a dinner party recently, both from this website. This classic version from 1966 and the Three-Cheese Fondue with Champagne. I've made the 1966 version twice now and both times it was excellent. It turned out much better than the updated version with Champagne, although it could have been because we used American Brie.

Made this dish last night for a fondue party and it was a big hit! I doubled the recipie as there were 8 eating. We had this as a main course with beef/chicken with brooth and oil. I also made some small red potatoes with olive oil s+p and rosemary. I was a bit worried about the cheese coming together, but patience is a key with this recipie, and also having the heat up high enough when you put the cornstarch in as I dscovered the cornstarch thickens better with the heat a bit higher then when you are initially melting the cheese. I also dusted the cheese with cornstarch before melting and added extra kirsch! I was a bit intimidated by cheese fondue, but not anymore!

This is a great basic recipe and easy to adapt to other types of cheeses. We make it a lot during the fall and winter.

This was a lot easier to make than I thought it would be. Definitely shake the grated cheese in a plastic bag with the cornstarch to coat it thoroughly before trying to melt it (thanks to Santa Cruz for the tip!) - comes out smooth and thickens up nicely. I added nutmeg and black pepper and used a good Italian Pinot Grigio which also served as a nice accompaniment.

This is by far the easiest and yet most delectable recipe for cheese fondue. I served it to four people (who have very different tastes) and it was demolished.... Any more than four I would recommend doubling the recipe. I used a dry Chardonnay so I think any good dry white works well. I served it with French bread that I had cubed and cubed red potatoes with olive oil and chopped parsley. I definitely recommend this recipe and will make it again (I have done so already!).

This was a classic and delicious fondue. I've made other fondue recipes and have always struggled to get a smooth, creamy texture, however this one turned out perfect. I also doubled the cornstarch and tossed most of it with the grated cheese before cooking (a trick I read in a Food & Wine article).

Rating: 3
This was great! I left out the Kirsch also and actually used only about 1/2 to 3/4 quarters of the suggested amount of wine which worked out perfectly. I also didn't rub the inside of the fondue pot with the garlic, but I threw the garlic right in with the wine. My husband is a very picky eater and was worried that the cheese looked "weird" - but he raved about it all night. Delicious!

I am an avid "fonduer" and use this recipe over and over again. A true Classic in my book! This recipe does however only call for a T of cornstarch unlike other recipes. If cooks perfer a smooth like cheese texture I would suggest using more cornstarch and coating the shredded cheese before melting it in the simmered wine.

I don't know why so many people had a problem with this recipe. I did leave out the kirsch, and I added carmalized shallots and it was wonderful, a big hit at my party. I asked the store to weigh then grate the cheese, so I had exactly 1/2 a pound. It melted just fine. I also melted it in a non-stick sauce pan and I have a non-stick fondue pot, and clean up wasn't a problem.

Rating: 1
What a waste of time. The cheese never melted into the wine. Though I added the finely grated cheese into the wine slowly, stirring with the figure 8 motion recommended, the cheese never combined to form a smooth sauce. I continued stirring for 30 minutes, hoping that it would slowly combine, but instead I ended up with melted cheese stirring around in creamy wine. I ended up having to scrap the whole thing and go out and buy ready-made fondue. Waste of $20.

Rating: 3
The recipe states that the grated cheese yielda 4 cups total, but I wouldn't use the cup measurement as a guide when grating. I did a fine grate of 12 oz. of cheese, which yielded 4 cups, however by the time I added the cornstarch/kirsch mix, my fondue was too thin. I coarsely grated another 4 oz. of cheese, and the texture and aesthetics were comparable to the pots of fondue I ate in Switzerland this summer. My hint: coarsely grate 1 pound of cheese for your fondue. My next hint is to let it roll, not a full boil after it has thickened, for just a few minutes. I think it really finishes the dish, as I remember it from this past summer. I used a cast iron fondue pot and didn't have any problems with the cheese sticking to the pot and was able to cook it in and serve it from the same pot. Clean up was easy. This recipe states that it makes 6 servings, but these are appetizer servings. This recipe yields enough for 2 hungry, cheese lovers as a main entree. Enjoy it!

I have made this three times, and have learned a thing or two. First, the taste is just wonderful and I don't think you will be disappointed in it. But, please take my advise and line your cooking pot with foil. The cheese will stick like mad no matter how much you baby it along. I alsto suggest that you freeze the cheese before you grate it into the wine, it works much better this way. Last, I lined my fondu pot with foil just below the rim. It was not noticeable and it made the clean up just great. Again, the cheese stuck to my pot and I actually ended up throwing out my fondu pot the first time I made this. This is a rather expensive little dish to make, so take care that you don't waste your time and money by not following the directions. I hope you enjoy the recipe because it is a good one.

A Swiss friend made this dish for us yesterday. He made it from a recipe he knew by heart, and it was exactly like this with the addition, as suggested below, of a little less Appenzeller cheese that the amount of the two others. The fondue was more liquid than the ones I remember from the 60s, but he assured us that it was just the way it should be and it was really delicious. Also, in spite of the mass quantities we ate, it didn't keep us from sleeping as we feared it might.

For a more authentic taste you need to add black pepper and nutmeg to the fondue. It is also a good idea to add a 3rd, somewhat stronger cheese, e.g. Appenzeller or very old Gruyere.

To the cook from Atlanta 10.27.01--"rather boring but gets the job done"--this is what they say of the Swiss, LOL! A very nice classic fondue and be sure to serve with boiled potatoes in their jackets and cornichon--along with the French bread. Save the cheese crust for me!

With regards to using a stainless steel fondue pot, my father made cheese fondue for 25 years in his 1970s paisley-design stainless steel fondue pot, until I finally bought him a new ceramic set last year! You do have to be more careful with the heat, however, as the cheese has a tendency to scorch if you don't keep it moving inside.

This was great. I made the carmelized shallots from the other fondue recipe in here... i liked that recipe, but it didn't call for Kirsch, and to me, that is an essential part of fondue. In fact, in this one I would add a bit more. I couldn't find the Swiss fendant wine though, so maybe that would've given it the twang I need. The caremelized shallots were fantastic so I'd recommending "borrowing" them as well. I was worried that they would overpower everthing and they didn't. I made this for four hungry people and there really wasn't enough. Its perfect as a dinner for four with other sides-- I just served it with Strawberries and wine. For three or two people it would be fantastic.
