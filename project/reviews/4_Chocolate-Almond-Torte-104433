Excellent! Used a springform pan instead, and it came out just great. A contribution to a pot-luck, it definitely got oohs and aahs.

Dear Sedona: It makes sense that you found this recipe not Italian enough. After all it is a recipe for a Viennese cake, i.e., from the Austro-Hungarian pastry tradition, and thus NOT meant to be Italian at all.

I am the big nay-sayer today and hate to be that way. Did not care for this at all but it is not beyond the bounds of reality that it was my cooking. Although I do think I did it correctly. I prefer an almond torte from an old Gourmet better. More traditional and more Italian than this.

I made the cake for a friend's Birthday party and everybody loved it. I used a round cake pan and decorated the top with roses and chocolate leaves.

Delicious! I simplified things by using a standard 9" cake pan and it turned out great, and quite elegant.

This cake was wonderful. I do not have the pan required, so I used an ordinary cheese cake pan with a removable bottom. I covered the bottom with foil. Nothing leaked out. We had it for Christmas dinner and everyone loved it. I used Valrone Chocolate with chopped Hazelnuts since that is all I had. It was great! This will be made for all my special dinner parties!
