This is my favorite summer recipe, but I use heirloom tomatoes vs. plums which adds so much more flavor. I also usually omit the olives. With homegrown basil and homemade pasta? Ridiculous!

This is a wonderful recipe! It is so nice and fresh. I make it regularly in the summer when there are nice, beautiful tomatoes, and I always receive great comments about it.

my husband likes thick spaghetti sauce, so he didnl't enjoy this dish, but i thought it was beautiful and very tasty.

I made this recipe, and my husband and I thought it was very good. It was a perfect light dish for supper on a hot, humid night. I used tomatoes from our local farmers' market, fresh basil from our "patio garden", fresh mozzarella and nice Kalamata olives. A Brunello Montalcino wine was enjoyed with it.

Bland and boring recipe. So many other better recipes out there.
