Another quick hint: Use the smaller grain baker's sugar, it caremlizes easier and reduces the dry grainy feel. YUM!

They should rename this Addictive spiced pecans. I can't understand the negative comments. This is so easy and so good. It has become a party staple. A few hints: use a high quality skillet, organic butter, measure ingredients exactly, I coated the pecans in the skillet and folded the remaining ingredients. This helped coat the nuts well before spreading out on the silpat lined cookie sheet. I slow roasted and every 8 minutes folded and tossed the nuts. They are sooo good. Great with cheeses and meats with wine at any party. Guests loved them. They make a lovely hostess gift as well in a jar.

This was tasty but it never quite came together as I hoped or expected. The nuts certainly got coated, but the coating never hardened, so it made your fingers greasy. It was tasty and we ate it, but I'll try something different next time.

These are great! So easy to make and the perfect little salty snack for a cocktail party. I've made these several times for parties and they're always well received.

I couldn't agree more with the previous reviewer...they are so tasty. Yummy with my wine but i will save them for tomorrows Thanksgiving cocktails and the salad. Made the recipe as written and they are great every time.

the only problem with these (and i followed the recipe to the letter) was that they were too good!

Tasted fabulous - I had expected the sugar to melt and caramelize, but it stayed pretty granular. Tasted great that way, though. I mad this as written, except I mixed the nuts in the saucepan with the butter, then the sugar/salt (didn't want to wash the extra bowl). I used the recipe's directions for cumin, and all my friends loved it. After baking at 350 for 20 mins, tried it at 400 for 4 or 5 more to melt the sugar, but gave up before I burnt the nuts. I like this better than another recipe with Worcestershire I tried.

This recipe is good, but not great. The addition of a touch of orange and cinnamon would balance these nuts nicely. Alton Brown has the best recipe online right now.

Rating: 2
Eh. I found these underspiced, and also couldn't get the sugar to carmelize on top without the pecans burning. Not what I'd hoped ...

Rating: 3
It's alright for a jumping off point. I found the nuts not quite flavorful enough, so I added a bit of paprika, some chili powder, a bit of ground mustard seed, and some powdered white pepper and then put the nuts back in the oven. They are very rich and flavorful

Rating: 1
What did I do wrong? To my knowledge I followed this recipe exactly. First, they're burnt and I took them out after 10 minutes because I could smell them burning. Oven was on 300. Second, they're tasteless, I can't taste anything but buttery burnt pecans, no "kick", no sweet, no salt. This is my third homemade Christmas gift failure this year - don't bother trying to smoke sea salt in your BBQ and my amarylis all bloomed prematurely. Next it's cheddar cheese shortbread. If this fails it's gift cards - how pathetic!

I just made a batch of these nuts for a small dinner party this evening - I'm planning to put some out with cheese and crackers, and some in a salad with dried cranberries and goat cheese. In both cases I'm interested to see how the flavors combine. My first impression after tasting them right out of the oven is that next time I would use a little more sugar and also some cinnamon - but I suspect that in combination with other strong flavors they're going to be just right as is. I didn't find the cumin or the salt to be overpowering as others did, but as I just eyeballed the amounts I used, perhaps I used less than the recipe called for. I used about 1/2 t. cayenne and it's just right - not too spicy, but gives a little kick in the mouth. I will definitely be making these again - it's such a quick simple way to dress up nuts.

This pecans are fabulous and easy to make! I've made about 5 batches, and they are a hit anywhere we go!

Great recipe, very easy to make. I didn't have cumin on hand, and it was fine without it. My only addition was to whisk the butter/cayenne mixture into one egg white before pouring over the pecans. Next time I'll use a pinch less salt and maybe a little more sugar. I made this at the holidays, and I think next year I'll make large batches to give as gifts.

We had last minute friends come over for cocktails, and I had everything on hand. Even tho we had all just eaten, we devoured these addictive little morsels! Fabulous.

These are perfect for a cocktail party, hostess gift, or between meal snack. As recommended by other reviewers, I decreased the cumin to 1/2 tsp. I also used half walnuts and half pecans and half the sugar. I'll up the sugar next time as well as the cayenne for more crunch and kick, but these were perfect as made.

I'm not sure but I think I have died and gone to heaven! These are incredible!! I'm not a pecan fan usually but I will be forevermore if this is how they are served. I'm making a second batch immediately.

Give me these pecans or give me death. How can I give something a 10 fork rating? Honestly, I don't think I've ever found any food harder to stop eating in my life  especially when still warm from the oven. A bucket of these will be my last meal request. One interesting thing is that when you make them, it seems like so much sugar and so much salt, but then the result is neither too sweet or too salty. The two spices are also not overwhelming, just perfect, as is the butter, oh wow. I'm eager to also experiment using other spices and/or different nuts or nut combinations. These are one of the best things I have ever tasted, and so freaking easy to make. Stupendous.

These are aces in my book. Easy and delicious, they have a sweet start with a spicey finish. I made them for my Christmas party - enormous hit! I made them as written and found that the ingredients were a perfect balance for those who like the sweet and spicey combination.

These are simple and easy. I like them because they are not covered with seasonings, just enough but you still can taste the pecans. WONDERFUL

It had a strange flavor with the cumin. I cut back as many of the reviewers suggested and it was still heavy on the cumin. I didn't hate it but I wouldn't make it again. They still got eaten but everyone who tasted them said the same thing. Liked them but didn't love them.

Rating: 4
This recipe was so easy, it was unbelievable. I separated my mix into 2 batches & I used 2 cups each pecans, walnut and cashews. I tripled all other ingredients, except for the cumin and cayenne I doubled. I didn't want it to be too spicy for the grandparents at Thanksgiving. The only problem I had was that the butter causes the spice and sugar mix to slide off easily. Maybe next time I will add a tbsp of the sugar to the butter to make it a bit stickier. In my 1st batch, the sugar didn't seem to carmelize like I thought it would. So in the 2nd batch I baked them on the top rack for the 1st half & the middle rack for the second. It gave me the carmelization I was looking for. They are addicting!

a terrific recipe. in addition to the spices listed, i add hot chili powder in the same quantity as the cumin. it ups the heat and smooths out some of the sugar. tasty to eat as a snack. also delicious added to a green salad.

We LOVE this recipe!!! It is perfect for those dinner parties where everyone comes into the kitchen for cocktails while I finish up the first course. These are something perfectly spicy and sweet!! A perfect starter! I always add a bit more butter, though; the recipe doesn't have quite enough to coat the pecans. Easy, easy, and delish!!!

I make these every Thanksgiving and just keep them in a bowl to snack on anytime. I cook them 30 minutes and I don't add the cumin. They don't seem to need it to me.

Rating: 3
I put all of the ingredients, except for the nuts, into a cast-iron skillet on medium heat and added in some buffalo wing sauce and extra butter. I added lots more salt, as I didn't like the sweetness of the original recipe but the sugar really did help the coating stick. I mixed the nuts into the mixture and stirred until they looked evenly coated. I put them on a cookie sheet lined with non-stick foil and after they were toasted and cooled on the pan for a while, I put them on a cooling rack covered in paper towels, which absorbed the last of the butter.

These are pretty good, but it was difficult to distribute the spices evenly, even while shaking the heck out of those pecans in a bowl with a lid.

I prepared for thanksgiving salad and people were actually sneaking these before they were placed on the salad (I prepared MIXED GREENS WITH PECANS, GOAT CHEESE, AND DRIED CRANBERRIES) and it is delectable. Enjoy. Double the recipe to use again in future on another salad.

Over the Holiday's I received some spiced pecans from a good friend and loved them so much. I found this recipe on Epicurious (which I frequent quite often!) and found this recipe to be very close to her's. The spices were perfect but some of the nuts seem to be not as coated as others. But still a wonderful recipe and will make often, not just on Holiday's!

I made this with walnuts only because I already had a big bag but pecans would be better. I used the full amount of cumin and added a little hot sauce to the butter mixture, then sprinkled on a bit more sugar after I tossed it with the nuts to offset the heat. They didn't seem quite roasted at 20 min. so I left in another 10 min or so. They were served as an appetizer and were a hit.

Yummy! They are definately best when warm from the oven, but still not bad a couple of days later. I used a mix of pecans, almonds, cashews, and macadamia nuts. My family loved them!

The cumin I got from the Indian grocer was sooo pungent - I was compelled to use less in the recipe. Mistake! These were delicious, and gone in about 10 minutes. Next time, I'll increase the butter, since I lost a lot of the sugar-spice in the bottom of the bowl.

Yumm!! Never would have figured cumin to taste this good. I've made this twice. I tripled the reciped the second time and will add more butter next time to ensure the nuts are fully coated - the spices didn't stick as well in the big batch.

Like another cook, I did not use the full 1.5 tsp of cumin. I also added dried cranberries in the jar to add texture and flavor to the mix. The Spiced Pecans were so gooooood, that I nearly polished off the jar...

So easy and so tasty. I like to add 1/2 cup raisins to mine. It adds a slightly sticky, slightly sweek counterpoint to the subtle spicy flavor of the recipe.

Rating: 3
The perfect combination of taste and ease. I've made nut recipes that were tastier, but they were all a huge pain and involved prying sticky nuts off a cookie sheet or trying to remove tiny bits of stuck-on aluminum foil. This recipe is super easy but the result is impressive. Great subtle flavor that will be fabulous with a nice cheese and some wine.

Rating: 4
I made these to go along with the Cornbread Stuffing recipe that they were linked to. Incredible!! I'm not big on nuts and I loved them. Everyone that tried them raved about them so much that I made two extra batches to serve before dinner. I will be making these forever. I added a pinch of chinese five spice powder and used ground chile de arbol cause I didn't have cayenne, since it approaches the same heat level.

These are so good! I used mixed nuts, but did notice that the pecans work best. I will make these for every holiday. They're quick and delicious.

Well this recipe is an A+. I made it for a "munchie" at a brunch a few months ago for some coworkers. All the wives and girlfriends have called to ask me for the recipe! It is quick and easy. My family is from the south and every year relatives send us a batch of pecans and we run out of ideas to serve them. This one passes the test. By the way, if you buy whole pecans "blanche" them in boiling water for a couple of minutes and let them cool, then they are much easier to crack and open.

We started using this recipe when it first came out. I never realized you could transform pecans into the likes of these in your own kitchen. Since then, I have begun crumling the nuts and adding to fresh green salads. The taste is awesome!

Very tasty! I used equal amounts of raw cashews and almonds which added variety but the pecans were the best (the spice mixture sticks best to them). Add sugar/spice mixture while stirring to more evenly coat. Make sure to at least double the recipe!! :)) They go fast

Rating: 3
The absolute easiest spiced/iced nut recipe around. Mine were too salty, but I don't know if I measured carelessly or if I need to cut down on the salt. Next time, I will mix together the sugar and salt before adding them to the pecans because I'm not sure all pecans got the same proportion of each ingredient.

These are good, and easier to make than some other spiced nuts recipes. Watch the cooking time, nothing seems to burn easier than nuts and seeds. I added a pinch of Gebhardt's Chili Powder to the mix, and a trifle more salt.
