This was not stellar, although the chicken was moist there was not a lot of flavor (perhaps should have toasted the pecans as suggested by others), however, the sauce saved the meal.

I wasn't impressed by this dish.

Low Carb Version: No panko, twice the pecans or more, in food processor. Half-freeze breasts, cut a deep pocket stuff w/cooked ham and feta. Fold ham over feta and compress. Insert w/closed end ham out. Food thermometer suggests it takes longer than 18 minutes to reach 160 degrees. Spoon excess pecan crumbs in pan on entree.

This is excellent. Toasting the pecans first makes the chicken much more flavorful. The sauce is okay but I have started making it with the sauce from Rachael Ray's Cider House Chicken (with cider, Calvados, cream, sauteed Honeycrisp apples,etc.) The combination of this chicken and that sauce makes this the ultimate fall/winter dish. Everyone has loved this and my husband says it is his favorite chicken dish ever.

Was looking for a pecan crusted chicken and this was the only one so I tried it. I was not disapponted at all. I did some with pecan and some with pistacios. My husband raved about this dish and told me it's a must keep.

I didn't want to run to the store for panko, so I just tossed the pecans in the food processor with regular bread crumbs, garlic, parsley and salt/pepper. The pecans are really what makes the breading so nice. The chicken was moist and tender.

Don't even need to put the shallots and parsley in. I didn't have parsley and Jenny (daughter) doesn't like onions or shallots. So I just sprinkled the chicken with chopped rosemary leaves. It was just right!

We enjoyed this - very moist and flavorful with a good pan sauce.

Followed the recipe closely- pulsed the pecans in my little food processor until fine, let the pan heat before adding the chicken, doubled the sauce. The chicken wasn't bad, but I felt it did need something extra to keep it from being too bland- perhaps a sauce, although the one the recipe outlines was missed the mark too -producing a salty (and I love salt) mess that neither looked nor tasted appetizing. Not a completely ruined dinner, but I'm really glad I didn't serve this to company. Too many tweaks needed to bring this up to tasty. I won't be making it again.

Excellent weeknight chicken dish. Fast, easy, and tasty. 1/2 c of panko and 1/2 c of pecans is more than sufficient though.

Very good recipe. Big hit w/the family even with out the sauce. Will definitely make it again and with the sauce.

This is one of my favorite recipes of all time! We had it last night and both of us would like to make it again tonight. Following the advice of some other reviews, I added some minced garlic and a little heavy whipping cream into the sauce and then reduced it. Fabulous!

Easy to make & a little more special than plain breaded chicken. Kids loved it. I also added lemon to the sauce, and garlic too: I felt it needed a little something.

So good and so easy! I don't make the shallot sauce - just the chicken. My kids love it and they are at the highly picky ages of 4 and 6. 4 stars for this one - quick, easy and yummy!

Really good! I scalloped the chicken breasts, used the pre-finely chopped pecans from the grocer (almost like pecan dust) and could not really notice the pecans in flavor. But the crust was crunchy and flavorful, and it kept the chicken moist. The sauce was really good, but obviously very oniony, even with the mild flavor of the shallots. I would double the sauce next time.

I make this recipe quite often and the family loves it. I cut down on the butter by 1/3rd. I also use half of the panko and pecans. I hate having to throw away the breading once the chicken has been in it. Easy preparation for during the week. Can get the vegtable going while chicken is in the oven.

I replaced the chicken with pheasant breast and leg meat. Therefore, I cut down on the baking time to 14 minutes and poured a little olive oil over the chicken before I put it in the oven to help retain moisture. (pheasant can easily dry out). I served over mashed potatoes and my 7 year old twins said it was "awesome" and both asked for seconds! My husband loved it too! I will make this again FOR SURE!

Made this last night after searching for easy chicken recipe with ingredients I already had. My family and in-laws loved it. Made a few changes as mentioned by others. 1) Did not have panko breadcrumbs so crushed seasoned salad crutons I had on hand. 2) added 1 cup heavy cream and 1 fresh squeezed lemon juice and 1/2 onion (did not have enough shallots) to the sauce. Let it simmer until thickened. Next time will increase the sauce (my son loved it and used on his mashed potatoes) we ran out for the chicken. Some reviewers mentioned lack of flavor. I think the seasoned crutons and along with lemon and cream helped put this dish over the top.

My family loves this dish. I serve it as a main meal or I like to omit the sauce and slice the chicken with a czar salad then wrap it in a tortilla. I also like to add a little parm cheese in the breading. Simple, easy and veratile, overall a great recipe

EZ to make, had all the ingredients on hand, and the chicken breast came out tender and juicy. I meant to add the sour cream an another reviewer suggested, but forgot. I think it might be the missing ingredient. The quantity of pecans & panko is too much; I cut in half and did only 2 breasts, but still had lots left over.

If you prepare all of the ingredients in a processor, this recipe is quick. Boy, I can't believe I said that. I used to think a recipe like this used to be a breeze. Anyway, it's much like breaded chicken breast, but with a twist.I needed the addition of lemon or another flavor to enhance the chicken and parsley/shallot flavors. Seemed to need the addition of a 3rd flavor.

Yum. This was great. And fast, too.

DELICIOUS, all I did was change to walnuts and add a tablespoon of minced garlic and a half of a teaspoon of horse radish. This meal has become a family favorite.

This recipe is delicious as written, but it's really a fantastic method for cooking beautiful, juicy, flavorful boneless, skinless chicken breasts. My only change: I always sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper first. It's very friendly to substitutions: do an egg wash with a tablespoon of dijon and substitute a bit of shredded gruyere or sharp cheddar for the nuts; do pine nuts, oregano, and parm etc... STICKING PROBLEMS: the pan isn't hot enough when you add the chicken. Add a bit of olive oil to raise th smoking point (butter will be almost burning--- kind of scary) and crank it. Wait until the butter stops sputtering and foaming before you add the chicken. Hope that helps.

Yum....I didn't have Pecans so I used Pine nuts and toasted them first. Don't remove the nuts from the pan when creating the sauce.....and add a tiny bit of sour cream to thicken the sauce. I served this with Orzo and a creamed onion sauce.

Very, very delicious. I have made this as written but also once with almonds and once with cashews, both of which were outstanding. I did add one garlic clove to the sauce just to give it a little extra zing. A huge repeat favorite in my house, and so very easy to make.

This was a really good recipe and easy to make. Next time I will grind the pecans more finely and pound the chicken. We served it with vegitable stir-fry with tofu from Bon Apetit 9/00.

I agree with chopping the pecans finer....I used a coffee grinder and it worked great!! Also, I puonded the chicken so it was considerably thinner and then pressed the mixture into the chiken as previously reccommended. It turned out great and my boyfriend really liked it!!

I've made this dish 2 times, once without the sauce. It is very yummy! The trick to keeping the panko-nut mixture on the chicken is to get the nuts crushed finely, and press into the chicken breast. This dish works without the sauce, but make sure you have something else to accompany it, like cheese or a white wine broth.

this was so bad, I am just glad I didnt have anyone over for dinner but my immediate family. My ONLY changes to the original posted recipe was bone in skinless breasts, and I used my cast iron pan as it browns so well and can move to the oven for baking. The main problem was the nut/panko topping totally fell off the chicken when I rotate it. I had a nice brown crust in the pan and not my chicken. Later when I made the sauce it turned out to be a glop of super nice nuts and panko mush mixed with broth. I am a excellent cook and everyone raves about my dishes, this one just tanked. it was a waste of my coveted trader joe's panko and $6 of pecans. (i live in colorado and we have no trader joes, this was from a road trip this summer)My husband actually asked if i forgot a ingredient, thinking something went really wrong, good luck!

Good for a quick weeknight dinner. Two ways to improve the flavor: add grated parmesan to the bread mix, or pound the chicken flat and roll a slice of aged goat cheese inside.

I thought this was just o.k. The chicken was tender, but overall I thought pretty bland. I don't think I liked it enought to make again.

As with the last reviewer, this was a quick and delicious dish -- perfect for those mid-week dinners with family. I liked putting the chicken in the oven after browning. The result was a very moist chicken.

This is a simple and delicious chicken recipe for a busy evening or for entertaining. You can spruce up the sauce by adding some heavy cream and let it reduce. Serve with black Thai rice and your favourite vegetables.
