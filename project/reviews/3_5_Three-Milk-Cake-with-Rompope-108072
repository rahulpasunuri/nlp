I have never made this cake, but after reading the reviews, was wondering if you could put the cake into a Tupperware cake container to soak, then you could just flip the container. Just a thought, I will save this recipe to try someday.

I have made this several times, and even though it's a little tempermental, it is well worth the effort. I have discovered that you MUST use either a manual or electric hand mixer; I tried using a stick blender with whisk attachment, and I deflated the batter. Once this happens, your cake is doomed. In fact, this recipe has caused me to run to the store for more eggs at midnight more than once! I'm about to make it again, so I'm steeling myself to not make ths same mistake again! Just be careful not to overbeat, and be VERY careful when folding in the egg whites. Good luck!

I make tres leches every week, this recipe is a good one but seeing i make them so often i dont make the cake by scratch anymore i just use a betty crocker cake mix and DONT use the one with pudding in the mix it will just not turn out right. For the best result use 1 cake mix 7 eggs 1/2 cup of water and 3/4 cup unsalted real butter softened. the cake does rise and its suposed to, it will still be dense and it soaks up the milks you dont have to keep turning the cake. Best to bake cake in a spring form pan that way you dont break the cake when taking it out. after cake has cooled and please make sure you dont over bake,(get something to hold the cake not to deep i use a cast iron skillet it holds the cake and is not to deep, that way when you go to flip the cake over after soaking it does not have that far to drop and will not crack.line it with plastic wrap making sure you have enough to cover the cake while it soaks) slice in 1/2 to make 2 layers the top layer sliced side up and poke holes place fruit or jams and pour 1/2 milk mixture over the fruit/jam place the other 1/2 of the cake with bottom side up and poke with holes i use a chop stick and pour remaining milks. you may not use all milk mixture save and use when serving. it is best to leave soak over night or atleast 12 hrs. and then cover cake with topping, and fruit. The best Rompope i have found is Santa Clara its in most mexican stores although it is about $14 to $18 its well worth it.

I love this recipe! I lived in Mexico for a year teaching school and for every holiday and birthday, parents sent a 3 milk cake to school. This recipe is very close to what my tastebuds remember and I've adapted it to make it easier and, in my opinion, better! Like other users, I use a cake mix to simplify the recipe and for the rompope I use Bailey's or Eggnog. This is a moist, messy cake so get over any ideas of perfection you may have - the perfection is all in the taste. This cake is light and delicious and it is a favorite among my friends.

I have made this cake several times since May 2003, initially following the directions explicitly. I have finally decided the best course of action is to use Betty Crocker's French Vanilla cake mix. Follow the recipe that uses butter rather than oil. For the Rompope syrup, substitute 1/2 & 1/2 for the condensed milk, add extra Rompope and 1/2 & 1/2, use a full can of sweetened condensed milk and most importantly, DO NOT COOK the syrup! Soak the cake and keep any left over syrup to pour over cake as it is served. This is an amazing cake when prepared with care! My 76 year old father requests this cake for his birthday every year! This cake is not only my father's favorite, but his entire neighborhood loves it!

You'll absolutely want to use a tried and true genoise recipe for this, rather than the one as given. The Cake Bible has a good one and it's online, just search for "French Génoise pdf". Definitely poke holes all the way through or use a syringe. I split my genoise into two layers to facilitate applying the syrup, and then filled the layers with a blend of strawberry preserves and stabilized whipped cream and some fresh sliced strawberries. I made rompope almendrado from scratch but ended up using it for drinks, so I went with Horizon eggnog plus Cruzan rum and it was great. The first time I made the cake I followed the given recipe and got an inedible result. OTOH the syrup was excellent paired with the Cake Bible's genoise, so I'll skip the fork rating.

Three milk cake does not rise because it's not meant to. It's not a sponge cake, but a dense, fine-crumbed cake that wills tand up to soaking without turning to mush. If you're having trouble soaking it, poke holes all the way through the cake with a skewer or a chopstick, and just keep adding more liquid.

Very Very Messy!!! But, delicious. Cake didn't rise much - not sure what went wrong. Will definately try it again.

This cake tasted great but was way too much effort. to turn the cake over several times in order to soak it adequately made such a mess and absolutely was not worth it. I might try pouring a creme anglaise flavored with rompope (or use this recipe's rompope syrup) into a ramekin dish, add the dry cake and pouring more of the sauce on top. I think that if we let it sit overnight it should soak up the sauce from both sides and alleviate most of the trouble.

The hot sponge cake did not rise properly. I had to make it twice but would use a simpler Jelly Roll cake recipe instead. Be wary!

What a great recipe! A great change from a lot of dry american cakes.

What a disappointment. I seem to be on the sticky, gooey mess side of the argument. The taste of the syrup was good, except a little too condensed milk for me. The cake was so mushy. Did NOT like the texture at all. It was so much effort and babysitting for a really underwhelming presentation and texture. I don't know what I did wrong, or if I did something wrong? I have never had this cake before-was eager to make it for my Mexican husband's birthday. We ended up eating popsicles instead!

My husband requested this cake for his birthday party and it was a hit! It was a lot of work, but well worth it in the end. I used Bailey's, but otherwise stuck to the recipe and it turned out great!

This is very authentic tasting. A little goes a long way. I agree with the other reviewer that you can make a regular cake in a 9x13 pan for the syrup, but I think everyone should genoise cake in this recipe.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. The syrup didn't completely soak into the cake leaving me with a gooey, heavy, extremely sweet mush. I think I'll stick with flan for Cinco de Maio.

for those of you who are cooking impaired (such as myself) I recommend using store bought cake mix. The first time I made this dish, my batter was a disaster! So I did everything else except for the cake part and it turned out heavenly, store bought cake mix is great for cutting time too!

Wow! I read the reviews and were hoping they were true...I'm pleased to say they were! Can't imagine anyone not loving this dessert, and as the last reviewer mentioned: the flavor is very authentic. I was afraid the cake would turn to a mushy mess by day 2, but I was wrong. This dessert is at it's prime if left to soak in the syrup a little longer. (decorate with whipped cream and berries after the fact) Couldn't find real rompope, settled for an eggnog liquer and Bailey's. Yum Yum!

This is a great dessert for a Cinco de Mayo party. EVERYONE loved it. I didn't reduce the syrup too much and of course added more rompope. The whipped cream topping cut down on its sweetness. Great cake. Its worth the time to make it.

Hmmm... not what I'd hoped. I made the mistake of reducing the syrup too much, and it didn't soak into the cake much. Also, I reduced almost the whole portion of the syrup, instead of half the batch, and then it lacked the spunk it should have gotten from the reserved half. My mistake, but I'm not so sure it would have been great even still. Only make this recipe if you love sweetened condensed milk-- my end product was just thick, gooey, heavy and super sweet in the canned-milk-product sort of way. Not for me.

Incredibly delcious! I made it for a friend's Birthday and it has now become the official Birthday cake of our household. I cannot get the Rompmpoe liquer in Utah so I have been using Bailey's. Any other suggestions. This recipie takes time but is well worth it for special occasions.

This recipe for tres leches is the best I have tasted yet! You must save this to your box. This is better that any restaurant slice. My sister-in-law made it as our dessert, and we were in heaven. Such an awesome-homey taste! Thank You for having this version here, be prepared with an extra pan.

This recipe is absolutely PERFECT! I rarely rate recipes 4 forks, but this one just blew me away. The flavor is so authentic! this cake just came out PERFECT! Don't change a thing! The rompope I used was from St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands....mmm... wonderful!

This is a very good cake--moist and not cloyingly sweet. However, I must have let the batter quadruple in size because it was too much for my 8" pans. I also had extra syrup (yes, I did reduce half as the directions read). All in all, very good cake.

This recipe has been in my kitchen for a long time. It was a Pillsbury Bake-Off Recipe so I guess the author of this recipe just added the booze. It is great without the booze. I make a cake mix, when it is hot out of the oven poke holes with a meat fork, mix my ingredients together and pour over the top and refrigerate. I put whipcream on the top before serving with toasted coconut. Love it.

I served this cake for a small dinner party and everyone loved it. My husband has requested for his birthday cake this year. It is a "knock your socks off" cake.

This is a very good recipe. Served it for my friends on the patio after Mexican snacks and we almost ate it all that evening! Wonderful.

four forks!!! this cake looks good and tastes great...it was a lot of work the first time i made it, but i just made it for the second time and it went much better! (i didn't find it too eggy...)

Wow! This cake was delicious and lovely! A gooey mess, but worth every bit of the trouble. It received rave reviews from family and friends. I did not find it too "eggy" as the previous reviewer suggests. Once the cake is saturated with the syrup, all "egginess" goes away. It's fantastic. Very rich -- a little goes a long way. Definitely a "special occasion" cake. I will be making it again.

I was disappointed in this. I love tres leche cake and have been looking for a good recipe. I thought this cake tasted very "eggy". This was a lot of work as well for poor results.
