So easy and so good! I added about 1/2 cup extra garbanzo beans to make the hummus a bit thicker (just a personal preference). I garnished the bowl of hummus with thin slivers of roasted red pepper curls, a sprinkle of chopped parsley and a swirl of olive oil. It looked beautiful in the center of a veggie platter!

I added a little parsley since I happened to have some. It was definitely the best i've ever made. A friend who doesn't like hummus loved this.

I made a few small adjustments, I added both 2 cloves of roasted garlic and added a raw clove to the mixture. I also added some oil. I served it with toasted pita and pretzels. It was a huge hit and it definitely helped the Steelers clinch the AFC Championship :)

Excellent! I normally don't like the taste of hummus, but this was spectacular! I used 4-5 cloves of pickled garlic, from pickling from summertime (if you haven't tried pickling garlic, its a great way to ease oneself into canning). I also used a bit of the pickling juice, probably 1.5tbsp. Then processed ingredients 1-4 together, then added the roasted red peppers that I roasted myself. YUM! Will make again, and again! Especially can't wait to make for parties.

I agree that fresh lemon juice is the key ingredient! I also added some paprika and a touch of cumin, and some extra garlic. Then it was perfect!

I love red pepper hummus, and based my dish off Sabra's red pepper hummus. That was the taste I was attempting with this recipe. I used two cans of garbanzo beans, drained, rinsed. I roasted my own peppers over my gas stove burner. I added about a quarter cup of Tahini. And I used about 3 tablespoons of jarred minced garlic. Salt and pepper to taste. Blend about 5 minutes in a food processor. It was perfect!

Add a bit extra garlic and more red peppers to make sure their flavor comes through. Fresh lemon juice is a must! Super easy, great for dipping just about anything and makes great canapes and sandwiches too!

I neglected to mention that I sprinkled a handful of toasted pine nuts over the top. Mmmm.

I obviously liked this recipe. I've made it twice this week. I made a few changes. I think 1/3 cup lemon juice is too much. I used at least a Tablespoon less and still had a good lemon kick. Be careful of the size of your garlic cloves. My second attempt was too garlicy - and I adore garlic. The first time, I roasted my red pepper and used it all. The second time I used bottled according to the recipe. I preferred my own for two reasons - the hummus was less red, and the flavor was fresher. Both times I added several pinches of cayenne and cumin and a bit less coriander - to taste. Also about 1/4 tsp salt. BTW - if you have an Indian market nearby, the sesame seeds can be purchased in larger quantities at a fraction of the cost of bottles in your supermarket.

I have been using the recipe for years and I have finally gotten around to reviewing. It is good, you just have to make it your own... More garlic, more red pepper and sometimes some feta cheese...

Hummus was good. I also added olive oil to keep smooth, one more clove of garlic, and some paprika, to liven up the flavor.

This was delicious, I made it with red peppers from my garden I roasted myself on the grill. It was nice - had a tasty kick to it all on its own. We'll be having this again.

I made this with some left over Garbanzo beans from the Ginger-Garlic Hummus recipe on this site. I halved the Roasted Red Peppers and substituted some pureed red pepper spread which included hot peppers. This added a nice spicy kick to the Hummus. Definitelly better than the Ginger-Garlic Hummus I made previously.

I read the comments and decided to both add some olive oil (wasn't a hard decision when I saw how "grainy" it was) and substituted a half cup of sun dried tomatoes in olive oil. It is a definite "will make again" for me!

I like this ok, but prefer original hummus over it. I like the use of black soy beans, though, for lower carb option. Also, black soy beans (according to the label on my can) only have 1.5 grams of fat per serving with 2.5 servings per can. Thats about 4 grams in the whole can . If your can says 15 0r 19 or whatever maybe it is packed in oil or something. Soybeans are only high in fat if it is added to it.

I was dissapointed with the flavor of this. It is easy to prepare, but, there are better hummus recipes out there.

This is a great hummus and incredibly easy! i cant wait to try some other creative additions. I used a mix of fresh and roasted red peppers.

After reading the reviews, I increased the garlic cloves to 4 - BAD MISTAKE. It's a delicious recipe but I will scale back next time.

I increased the lemon, tahini, and garlic, and added olive oil. Before putting the red peppers in, it is exactly like hummus you get in the Middle East.

Every time I make this hummus I try a few of the changes suggested (like reducing the lemon and adding more roasted red peppers) and it always comes out great! The past time I made the hummus I used cayenne pepper instead of black pepper and it really helped to spice it up and take away from the bland flavor. I will definitely be using the cayenne pepper when making this hummus from now on.

This was a great combo. I will definitely make it again.

I substituted the red peppers with fresh cilantro and jalapeno peppers. Use about 1/2 cup of cilantro (packed) and jalapeno peppers to taste (pickled from the jar). Gives it a kick!

I found this recipe disappointingly bland. With some additions of my own, it turned out great, if not much like what was intended by the author. I used 5 cloves of garlic instead of 2, an entire 12-oz jar of roasted red peppers (drained) instead of 1/2 cup, plus 4 oz of feta cheese and 1/3 cup fresh basil. Delicious!

a little too much lemon for me. only added 1/4 cup and will add less next time..But over all pretty good.

Pretty good. I used reduced-fat peanut butter instead of the tahini. Nice nut-like flavor. It all fit nicely in my small food processor. I added some of the liquid from the chickpeas for smoothness and it came together quickly. Great with raw veggies. Will make again.

Great recipe! A note to those who are appliance-challenged (like myself): a blender and a mixer don't really substitute for a food processor! You can do it, but mix first, blend second.

This is the best! I buy the roasted red peppers in a jar and add to this recipe but in the summer I roast my own, remove the skins. I think this is the best hummus recipe I have ever made and I have made alot of different recipes. The roasted peppers adds so much to this recipe. Great for a party...was a hit at mine judging from the empty bowl.

I can't believe 100% would make this again. It's possible that I did something wrong, but my batch came out just so bland and tasteless. I was embarrassed to set it out for my guests. Adding more garlic helped a little. I just had to write in because this was so far off the mark. I'm suspicious of all the 100%-would-make-again recipes now! - Just Learning

A simple, elegant and very delicious version of hummus - I served with toasted baguette slices one night and with wheat pita and crudite for dinner with my parents. Gave it a light sprinkled of paprika around edges for a nice look, would normally drizzle with good E.V.O.O., but didn't want to tack on extra fat. It was the perfect appetizer to make in advance for a dinner party.

YUM! I 'tweaked' it slightly and added a splash of the garbanzo juice, a little extra virgin olive oil, and some fresh cilantro...try it, you won't be sorry :)

Delicious!! The second time I made it with fresh roasted red bell pepper and it is absolutely wonderful! It adds a whole other dimension to hummus!

Good, but something not quite right. I made it accordingly, but it came out somewhat bitter. Might use the suggestion of adding tahini a little at a time, not sure if it might also be the lemon juice. Olive oil I think is a must to smooth it out, will experiment a little more with this recipe to get it just right. Really easy though.

I made this recipe exactly as it is written! It was delicious and the hit at a recent football party attended by some of my most health conscious friends! I toasted split pita wedges in a 350 oven until they were crisp (about 10 minutes). Yum!

It can be very hard to make basic items really well. This is very easy and good. I added a little olive oil to smooth it out (also a touch of extra lemon juice, definitely use fresh) and then swirled the top of the serving bowl, drizzled with olive oil, and sprinkled with a little paprika and chopped parsley. It looked very pretty and my guests thought it was some sort of complex hard to make special dish. A definite four fork make again because it is so welcome when entertaining, can be made ahead, and looks and tastes great.

I tasted a roasted red pepper hummus at a food festival and looked for this recipe. I had a hard time locating tahini, but found it. Then the only jar of roasted red peppers I found was roasted in garlic. The only ingredient lacking then was fresh lemons, for which I substituted Realemon. My hummus came out kind of bitter, so it could either be too much garlic, or the Realemon. I put in a dash of sugar, but still was slightly bitter and grainy. I'll give it another try and use the suggestions of some olive oil and less tahini. Also fresh lemon juice!

Fabulous recipe and easy to make. Was the hit of my party. Before I made it everyone said "Just buy hummus" but once they tasted it they could see why it's worth making.

I have made this several times, and it always receives rave reviews. I actually prefer the slightly grainy texture, but the addition of a bit of olive oil would smooth it out. Excellent with raw veggies as well as pita triangles.

Good. I added some things to it. Added 4 red jalapeno peppers (seeded and deveined)and cilantro to taste. First time I substituted the tahini with olive oil and peanut butter. Tahini can be too high in fat. Great snack and/or appetizer.

Very good, but not quite there. The texture was grainy, adding 1 tab. x-virgin olive oil smoothed it out. It didn't have enough bite or savory quality, so add 1-2 tea. wine vinegar (to taste). There was still something missing; add 1/8 tea. Cumin. Voila! With a loaf of fresh French Bread, I dare you to tell me it is not addictive!

To my dismay I discovered I was out of lemon juice after I opened the beans. I substituted one tablespoon of cider vinegar and added approx. 1/4 cup of olive oil and it was very good.

The red pepper added some fabulous colour to the hummus but I found the taste to be slightly off. I think that the recipe called for too much tahini. My suggestion is to add the tahini a little at a time, until the desired taste is achieved.

I also added 1 1/2 oz chopped green olives and a splash of garlic chili pepper sauce at the end. Delicious!!!
