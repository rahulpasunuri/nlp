Simple and delicious! I followed one reviewer's advice to hold aside some of the butter from the browning step and add it when reducing the sauce. I reduced the overall amounts slightly to cook about 1.5 lb drumsticks plus about 1/2 lb of boneless thighs; also added 10 oz. of mushrooms. No white pepper on hand, but will be sure to try it next time. I was surprised that a recipe without garlic or onions could be so tasty!

Very good...my chicken didn't "brown" much though...more like poached in the butter, sherry mixture...Next time I would start out with 3 T butter, brown the chicken, THEN add the remaining 3 T at the end to thicken the sauce... This go around, I thinkened my sauce w/a touch of corn starch and added mushrooms to the dish...served over roasted sliced potatoes and along side roasted baby carrots with rosemary, kosher salt and pepper. A wonderful, comforting dinner!

I usually make this with boneless chicken thighs and mashed potatoes. A great recipe that is super easy! I too have added mushrooms on occasion with great success.

Wow, this was fantastic! I used 1lb organic free- range chicken thighs (boneless, skinless). Otherwise followed the recipe exactly (just reduced the cooking time a bit). Simple enough for a weeknight but still company worthy. I served it with an arugula salad.

I will definitely make this again - wonderful, subtle, flavor. I would have no problem serving this to company, but it's easy enough to make in the middle of the week. This is the kind of recipe I look for.

So easy and the sauce was wonderful! My kids loved this. I served it with the yellow pepper risotto from this site (highly recommended).

i actually tried this recipe because it was close to something i was trying to replicate that i had in spain. i made some alterations though, which turned out fantastic. first, i used no ginger, but did use plenty of garlic and about 5 shallots. i also used drumsticks (they come out very tender and almost fall off the bone). i used about 1/3 butter and 2/3 olive oil. also, i used more than 1 cup of sherry (maybe 2.5) and let it reduce for quite a while over low heat while basting the drumsticks. the sherry and the shallots carmelize and create a very pungent sauce. and i used all the sauce ingredients after the chicken was browned to let it all baste together. it turned out fabulous. very rich flavor. served with green bean almondine.

i used boneless breasts which came out pale and sickly looking. The sauce is definitely tasty but the meal itself is missing something. i served it over egg noodles which combined nicely with the sauce but the whole presentation and flavor seemed bland and uninspired. I am always looking for new chicken recipes and even though this one is quick, in my opinion, it just lacked any punch.

Delicious! I'm a big fan of Ginger and Sherry! Served with Risotto Milanese also on this website. I added Sherry to the Risotto also. Will make this for company, it looks and tastes like I worked a lot harder than I did!

A GOOD QUICK RECIPE - I ADDED SAUTED MUSHROOMS & USED BONELESS/SKINLESS BREASTS -- SURE BEATS SHAKE&BAKE WHEN YOU NEED A DINNER WITH SMALL PREP TIME.

This was easy and tasty. I would increase the ginger next time for a little more flavor, but my family loved it as the recipe reads. I served it with buttered noodles and steamed artichokes.

Very pleasant and as easy as rolling off a log to make. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs and added toasted sliced almonds at the end to add an interesting texture. Will definitely make again.

This is just like the ginger chicken recipe that my Mom used to make, she used only thighs. I love it, try it with noodles

Excellent, fast and easy. Next time I'll cut down on the butter. I thought it went well over rice.

I wasn't too crazy about this dish. It was easy to make and tasted o.k., but just wasn't worth more than two forks to us.

like all J. Beard's recipe, this is a keeper! Try your next search under his name and get all of his keepers!

This recipe was great. I'm not the most experienced of chefs and this turned out great on the first try! I made it with whole cornish game hens and instead of just sauteing them I popped them in the oven and they were great!

My fiance flips out every time I make this for him - and I love it too. I used a sweeter sherry one time and it was not nearly as good. The real beauty of the dish comes from the sweetness & the saltiness together. I make this with a potato gratin with Swiss or Guyere - really great winter eating.

This dish is so easy and tastes great. I make it often. It's even better with Port instead of Sherry.

the dish is a light meal that is good for a date, women should love this twist on chicken, and it is simple. served with mixed green salad, sauted red potato, and a chardonay, this is a good meal. the reason i gave it a three, its not a great leftover item, eat hot.

This is just simply one of the yummiest chicken dishes I've come across. The combination of butter and sherry on the chicken makes it slightly sweet, but with a depth not usually found in sweet-sauced dishes. I've made it with both unsalted and salted butter, and it doesn't seem to make much of a difference. Magnifique!
