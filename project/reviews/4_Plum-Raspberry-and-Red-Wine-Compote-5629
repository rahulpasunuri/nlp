Beautiful use of plums! I had a case of Elephant Heart Plums, and made a half recipe including (if you can believe it), only 1 tbsp sugar and no extra water. The wine was a light Zin. For an encore performance I substituted blueberries for the raspberries and liked it even more. I will be repeating this recipe!

I prepared it the night ahead, and it was just delicious the next day for dessert. It was fantastic over ice cream as well! Visit http://joleneeatshere.blogspot.com for pics and details

This makes such a pretty, classy desert! I served the compote over vanilla bean ice cream and it looks and tastes wonderful! I used half raspberries and half blackberries to give it more a little more color.

This is great, by itself or served over ice cream, shortbread or angel food cake. It is very easy. The last time I made it, I used a cabernet. Delicious and so so easy.

I used fresh plums and raspberries from our garden for this recipe and it was delicious. It's a great light dessert, perfect after a big meal. It is important to allow the compote to chill overnight. I tried it the night I made it and it tasted too "winey". However, the night I served it, the juices had blended and it tasted great. All the guests raved.
