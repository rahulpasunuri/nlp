Perfect. Easy. Refreshing. Great Flavor.

This was a nice healthy side dish that I think will blend with a lot of different main courses. The mint have it a bit more interest than plain peas would but I'm just not sure that the lettuce added as much to it as I'd hoped.

I was quite surprised with how good this combination turned out. The fresh mint and lettuce gave the peas a nice added texture and taste. I agreed with the suggestion of adding some color so I roasted my red bell pepper and chopped it then added this to the dish. Very fresh tasting and simple to prepare.

it's not unusual for me to want to try out something that is rather out of the ordinary and very often i enjoy the results. for me, this is not one of those recipes--it just didn't fit together at all. it wasn't bad to eat but it didn't hold any appeal for me. on the other hand, my husband liked it pretty well and would have given it 2 forks...

Surprisingly delicious. The recipe looked a little unconventional (peas, broth, lettuce and mint???) at first, but it was well worth making. Very nice balance of flavors.

The FRESH mint is the key in this recipe. I used a little less broth and a little more lettuce. A surprisingly nice taste. Had the leftover in the fridge ad tasted it cold the next morning and was pleasantly rewarded with a ncie minty taste. One downside is that it doesn't look good (all green) so i added some finely chopped red pepper (tbs).

I have made this for years and it's really a very good way to dress-up (disguise) frozen peas. Instead of mint, I usually use fresh nutmeg and add salt and pepper, of course.
