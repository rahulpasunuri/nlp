Very tasty. My family is real picky about fried eggs -- the white can't be runny, but the yolk must not be firm. So I made a scrambled egg, 3 eggs, 3 TB milk, salt and pepper, microwaved it at 15-sec bursts, stirring between each, until it was just firming up. The time under the grill finished the cooking.
