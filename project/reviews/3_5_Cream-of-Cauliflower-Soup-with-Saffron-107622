Made this for friends and we all loved it. I doubled the saffron and the flavor was very subtle and doubling was plenty. I thought the soup needed a little more flavor and that may have been with the chives which I didn't add.

I took one reviewer's advice about thickening and used a pale yellow sweet potato instead of cream, as well as extra onions and extra saffron. Scrumptious! Will definitely make this again and again.

I combined this recipe with the one for roasted cauliflower soup; the roasting with shallots and garlic added depth to the soup. It wasn't quite thick enough, so I added some fresh breadcrumbs, then served with a squeeze of lime juice and some sour cream,

I was looking for an entry level cream of cauliflower soup and picked this one. I opted out on the saffron, added carrots and used turmeric, hot paprika and pepper to finish it off. I have tried this recipe with unhomogenized milk and half & half, and with farmer's market regular and purple cauliflower. I also tend to leave my soup chunky instead of pureeing it. I found this soup to be easy to prepare and a good comfort soup. The purple cauliflower lent the soup a lovely shade of lavender, which was fun.

The word for this soup is subtle. If you are looking for a wild and crazy cauliflower soup with curry, etc., this is not it. I happen to find it very elegant and pretty much delightful, but I serve it as more of an amuse bouche than as the focus of an entire meal. I make very few changes. I add a few grains of garlic powder with the onions as they sautee, and I also will sautee a rib of celery, then toss it out before pureeing (don't want the strings in the soup). I also use less butter and substitute a little olive oil and whole milk instead of half and half, and I add salt and white pepper at the end to taste. I also sometimes will swirl a little olive or hazelnut oil on top to serve. The rest is just fine as is!

I found this soup to be pretty bland even though I doubled the saffron and added three cloves of garlic. With a lot of salt, toasted cumin seeds and paprika, it was a big improvement. The recipe is a good starting off point but definitely needs some additions. On the plus side, it has a great, velvety texture and with some garnishes, it looks really nice.

This soup is, quite possibly, the best thing since sliced bread. Use more saffron and make sure it's good quality. YUM.

Made recipe as written with home made chicken stock & farmer's market cauliflower. It needs something. Added a bit of lime juice and cumin.

Bland and boring. I was hoping that after a few days the flavors would improve, but it didn't happen! There are better recipes...

Good and easy, tasted like a potato soup. Though, the amount of saffron called for did not color my soup at all.

This recipe will make you a cauliflower fan even if you're not. I did use 4c. of mushroom broth for liquid & reduced to 1/2, then double the saffron, 1 T. butter, 1 med to lg onion, used half & half to consistency I wanted (about 1/2 cup), omitted the chives. If poss. use farmers market cauliflower. I've made this twice in a week. My Dad loved it. Fabulous!

Delicious, enough to satisfy my cauliflower soup craving! Soo creamy, and the taste was subtle, my husband and I loved it. I will have to try again, though, because I was missing many ingredients... Shame, shame... This is how I made it: 2 beef broth cubes diluted in 3 cups water; onions and 500g cauliflower sauted in olive oil AND 1 Tbsp butter; whipping cream, and a bit of celery seeds and nutmeg. It seems that you can't get wrong with this recipe! An absolute keeper!

By looking at the ingredients, my impression was that this would be tastelss. However, after reading the reviews, I had to try it. I'm so glad that I did. Well worth trying.

In this recipe I used a whole head of cauliflower, two small potatoes, onion and three cloves of garlic and doubled the saffron. I used an immersion blender so I really only had one pot to clean up. After blending, I ommited the half and half and stirred in 1/3 cup sour cream and grated whole nutmeg, salt and pepper to taste. I used my most objective critic to taste if it was ok, my 2 year old. After a taste, her first words were "More!?" I knew then that it was a winner. My husband loved it too. To serve, I garnished it with a dollop of sour cream, more nutmeg and chives.

Excellent and easy..use garlic, celery as suggested by others. No need for milk or half and half, cook a potato along with the cauliflower for thickening purposes. A keeper...

This soup was disappointing the first evening we tried it, but after sitting in the refrig for 2 days, the flavors developed and it was truly delicious!

Very good, amazing on a cold night. Didn't use any saffron, wonder if I can substitute more caulliflower for the 2 cups of onions without losing too much of the flavor's complexity (my husband is allergic to onions). I'll try next time I make this.

it's so good -- couldn't stop myself from going back for more (and more). i changed it up a bit: sauteed chopped celery, onion and garlic in a mix of butter and bacon fat. used all homemade chicken stock, and didn't use saffron b/c had none. added half-and-half til a good color and consistency and added 2 pats of butter for that velvety texture. and some freshly ground black pepper, kosher salt AND a few grates of nutmeg. perfect. my picky boyfriend loved it.

I loved this soup. I took all of the tips suggested. I used a touch of garlic, ginger, sour cream and half and half. I also doubled the cauliflower. This made a wonderfully rich, tasteful, filling soup.

Only alright as given, though the texture is terrific and it is easy to make. I agree with the other reviewers who said it needed more flavor. Next time I'll increase the saffron a bit and add some fresh garlic and ginger. Also, I like the idea of using sour cream instead of half-and-half.

Awesome. I had made a cream of cauliflower soup once before and was extremely disappointed. This soup will be the ONLY cream of cauliflower I ever make again. The only change I made was a touch of garlic.

This soup was splendid the second day, and even the third. The flavors needed a little time to develop - wonderful.

.. a splash of white worcester sauce (regrettably seemingly unavailable in Toronto),a little crushed garlic, a tiny grating of fresh ginger, plenty of salt and pepper - and voila! a very yummy, fast and easy soup.

The flavor of this dish is surprising and complex, and the saffron does add a dimension to it. I used a little bit of sour cream instead of half and half: whereas a little bit of creaminess and fat adds to the flavor, I think the dish would be perfectly yummy without anything but veggies. I have already made it again, the second time adding some garlic to the onions, and it was a good addition.

Easy delicious and healthy. top off with chopped scallions for color. For the midwesterner, pezey spices in Milwaukee Wi have a choice of saffron. they do mail order.

THis is OK, but I thought nothing special. I increased the saffron and I am still not sure what it adds. Nice soup for cool autumn evening. No one asked for seconds.

This is fantastic. In this as in other recipes on this website, I used regular salted chicken broth. Salt-free may be healthier but not if your guests start in with the salt shaker!!

where on earth do you get saffron threads if you live in the midwest? Please give a substitute to use.

This is a good soup. After finding the saffron threads, the rest was a breeze. My youngest who hates all kinds of vegetables gave this a thumbs up and licked the bowel clean. The bonuse was that I got to use the fat free half and half and it still keeps the creamy taste! A keeper, will make it again!

This is exactly what I was looking for, a cauliflower soup that tasted like cauliflower and not curry. I wanted a thick soup that could be poured in a bowl with another thick soup so they could look divided but the guest could blend if they wanted to. I left out the saffron to have that pure white color next to the other soup, such as a thick carrot soup. Topped with rye bread croutons. Delicious!

The recipe is simple to make, and the result is exactly that promised - an elegant soup with a velvety texture. As saffron is one of my pantry favourites, I always have it to hand. I was also able to find very fresh cauliflower, but I substituted the vegetable broth with homemade chicken broth.

I've made this recipe twice now. A tip I learned from watching a few t.v. chefs, they cooked (simmered) the cauliflower in the cream until tender (about 20 minutes). The first time I used 2% milk, the 2nd time half&half. I liked the 2% better. I love saffron and agree this recipe doesn't call for enough.

I substituted veggie broth for chicken broth, and I used evaporated milk instead of cream to cut down on the fat and it turned out fine. I agree that the saffron taste is subtle, but I was able to get very fresh cauliflower so the overall result was nice and tasty.

Rating: 3
This was wonderful. I agree the saffron was very mild. I did not add the cream to cut down on the fat. Once I tasted the soup I added quite a bit of pepper which gave it a much better flavor. I'm not sure if adding more saffron would give it the punch it lacked at the beginning. I have not cooked much with saffron.

This soup was alright, but not too memorable. Pretty easy, though. Didn't taste like much -- it definitely needs something else, I just don't know what!

The flavor is subtle and I didn't really taste the saffron, but it's easy and it's good on a cold winter night.
