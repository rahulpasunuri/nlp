Excellent. No Mahi Mahi available so used swordfish. It was a hit!

We used frozen mahi mahi from Costco. Followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious. The crema makes the meal - don't skip it!

I used the rub from this recipe to season some mahi mahi my boyfriend caught, and it was delicious. Rather than make the pico, though, I served it with a spicy pineapple salsa. Next time I'll try the crema; it sounds great.

Great recipe! I used fresh caught mahi, wahoo and tuna and I made a few minor changes.... smoked paprika, chipotle instead of cayenne, no jalapeno in the pico and I added lime to the crema. My family loved them!

Best meal of my life!!! I used sword fish instead of Mahi-Mahi. I can't stop thinking about this meal. Luckily I have leftovers for lunch! I have never written a review, but I just had to with this dish! Enjoy!

Wonderful dish. Made the rub into a brush on marinade just prior to grilling by combining the dry ingredients with the veg oil. Made it into a paste and brushed both sides. easier and sticks to the fish better. We used frozen Mahi-Mahi fillets from sams club. So easy and a huge hit.

Absolutely lucious flavor combination. Everything is delicious by itself and the flavor only intesifies when eaten together. Would definitely recommend this dish to anyone.

We love fish tacos in all forms and this grilled version is excellent. Lucky to find some fresh Mahi-Mahi in my landlocked market today, but sure it would be great with any mild/meaty fish. Not so sure about something as thin as talipia for the grill, but maybe in a grill pan!! The amount of dry rub could be cut back (used about 1/2 for a 12 oz.fillet) but the amount of crema was right on.

Super easy. The spice rub was good. Kept the hot pepper sauce separate from the crema so that people could adjust the heat to their liking.

Best fish tacos I've ever made. I'd recommend, though, using whatever firm white fish is local to your area. Mahi is not a cold-water fish so I don't buy it here in Northern California, where halibut is a fabulous substitute.

Have made this twice now using halibut. I forgot the hot pepper sauce for the crema both times and can see how these would be that much better having a little heat in the crema. Very easy, very fast, very good.

What a great, flavorful, healthy dish. Everyone in the family loved it. I followed the recipe almost to the letter.... minor adjustments. I served with corn and flour tortillas (which I threw on the grill), and I had more add in's like avocado. Definately making this againn!!!

Delicious and quick to prepare. I followed the recipe except that I used tilapia as mahi mahi wasn't available at my local market.

This was easy to put together and, overall, pretty good. The Mahi Mahi seemed strong. I haven't cooked with it before so am not sure if it was the quality of the fish that I purchased or an inherent quality of Mahi Mahi. I will try this again with an established milder fish.

If you take out the seeds from the jalapeno, it isn't hot. Just a thought........

Made this last night- it was easy, and delicious. The only thing I changed was I only used half of a jalapeno so the kids would eat it.
