I Love asparagus, anyway you want to fix it, but my favorite way is with Hollandaise sauce, and I came across a really easy recipe for Hollandaise sauce. Just look in the Betty Crocker cookbook from the 50's. I have been using that recipe THAT LONG.

Really? Snap off the tough part of the stalks. Toss the asparagus in a glass microwave dish. Squeeze a lemon over it, toss in some butter pats, grind some fresh pepper over it all. Cover and put in the microwave for 6-7 minutes. Lovely tender crisp veggies in half the time and none of the fuss. Better for you too.

The seasoning on this is good, but peeling asparagus and then boiling it for 6 minutes makes mush. Better to not peel it, and steam it for a few minutes.

Asparagus is best when fiddled with the least, and this recipe is just simple enough. Don't take lightly the step of peeling the asparagus -- The outer skin can be very fibrous and impossible to chew in the last several inches of a good stalk. Also, take care in the cooking stage as there's not much forgiving time between tender asparagus and a bundle of (tasty) mush. ;)

For a simple improvement on asparagus this is great. Who doesn't have all the ingredients on hand? Added a little parmesan cheese at the end. yum..

Perfect as is. Don't need to add anything to this one! Coming from someone who used to HATE asparagus, that should say something. Even the kids like it! Simple, not over seasoned/sauced, quick and easy.

I recently bought these bags that are meant for steaming in the microwave and they are awesome! I had this recipe made in less than 5 minutes. And I also sprinkled a little parmesan cheese on top... a perfect snack!

I didn't have sour cream so I added a splash of heavy cream and it definately improved the flavor and consistency.

I made this recipe as written and it was fresh and delicious. Tonight I am making it again with wild rice and the broiled salmon with lemon, onion and tomato recipe from this site. This time I will add some minced garlic, as I am a garlic addict!

This recipe was great! Even though I added a little too much garlic at the end. Definitely add the 1 tablespoon sour cream.

I liked the butter, lemon combo but be careful of how much lemon you use. I squeezed in some extra thinking more is better but ild make wasn't. More is BITTER! Would make again but without over lemonizing.

I don't like aspargus, but they looked so fresh at the market that I bought some and followed this recipe (and added the sour cream and garlic that a previous reviewer suggested) and it was delicious. Will definitely make this again.

This is how I've always prepared and eaten asparagus and it's SO good. However, recently I've taken to roasting the asparagus instead of boiling. I drizzle olive oil and put in 400 oven and roast for 5 or 6 minutes, then toss with lemon juice, butter, and sprinkle with coarse salt. YUM

If you have a Trader Joe's in your area, they have a frozen package of Cuts and tips which beats cleaning and cutting. They are smaller so you have to judge the butter and lemon juice accordingly. For a change, you can add a drop of Djon mustard to the butter and lemon.

Wonderful spring dish. It's simple enough for a weeknight supper, yet delicious enough for company. Unlike the chef in Marblehead I didn't saute in the last step - just dumped the asparagus back in the (still warm) pot, lobbed in the butter, squeezed the lemon, spiced, and tossed. Also, because my asparagus was young and tender, I only needed to cook it for 4 minutes, so adjust your times accordingly!

Meets my requirements for a good dish - easy, can be made ahead, and tasty! Make sure you don't saute the asparagus too long, or it will brown slightly.

My daughter is a very picky eater, but this simple recipe had her going back for more. The lemon really helps with the flavor.

I added a clove of garlic and a tablespoon of sour cream and it was super!

Peeling the ends of the asparagus makes a big difference - no bitterness.

simple & good -- in addition, I shredded some gruyere cheese atop the asparagus and placed the serving plate under the broiler for a few seconds, just enough to release the tangy flavor of the cheese.

Good and easy. Good for those that don't like it when asparagus is tough and chewy.

This is a great spring/summer dish and so easy to whip up. It's been a winner with salmon filets.

One of my favourtie ways to eat this veggie. Instead of boiling, I steamed the asparagus instead. Very simple, quick and easy.

I added some sugar to the sauce since it tasted bitter. Served with rosemary-roasted salmon and wild rice with carrots. All in all satisfied with the meal. It was easy and fast to prepare on a weeknight.

I found paring the thin stems fussy - though still necessary with short cooking time w steaming. Next time I'll just cut ends further up, be done with it. Quite delicious - and ever so simple.

A classic recipe. Easy, quick, and sublime. Steam the asparagus rather than boil it for best texture and highest nutritional content.

This is a favorite-it's elegant and easy. You can also steam the asparagus for the same amount of time and season the same and it turns out relly well too.
