This has become my go to for homemade thousand island. I have a hard time giving something the full rating if I have to alter it a little, but I do think it would be unfair to give it only 3 forks. I don't have low fat mayo around, so I use regular. And, I agree about the water being too much. This last time I followed a reviewers recommendation and added vinegar instead of water, and I love it. I still didn't add the full amount.

This is great, as long as you do NOT add the water until you see what it looks like without it. Then add to the consistency you like. Mine was pretty much undiluted and worked great.

I clicked 4 forks and maybe I shouldn't have. I was looking for any thousand island dressing recipe, this looked to be the best. I used Canola Mayonaise, not lowfat. Left out the bell and water that others suggested. It took like 2 minutes to make this. It was Fantastic! the secret sauce for for burgers too!

I try never to tweak on the first try of any new recipe, but out of a hunch, I used only a couple tablespoons of water to start and STILL had to reconstitute with mayo. I'll leave out all water next time around and go from there. 4 Forks because flavor is exceptional.

Very tasty, and my picky daughter liked it a lot. Didn't read the other reviews as closely as I normally do. Was far too watery, so next time I make this I'll try it first without any water.

Haven't tried it yet, I came looking for the recipe my mother got from Gourmet that she used in her restaurant. She used beets, I am going to substitute beets for the ketchup and see how it works. The recipe I was looking for is over 30 years old and I can't find the one I had put away.

Sure is better than store bought. Used bottled pimento instead of the red bell pepper and reduced the water by at least half.

This dressing was good... after a lot of tweaking. I left out the water, added more mayo and relish. I did not have any lemon juice so I used white vinegar instead, it worked fine. My husband loved it, I thought it was so-so.

My husband loved this dressing. The only change I would suggest is using less water.

I will sacrifice calories for taste on this one. I used reg. mayo instead of low-fat, chile sauce instead of ketchup, green onion instead of reg. onion & leave out the water. Otherwise basic recipe & ingredients make an excellent 1000 island dressing.
