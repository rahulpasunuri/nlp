This sounds wonderful, but I am confused by the amounts. How do you measure "1/8 pound" of eggplant? And 4 cups of 1/2" chopped cabbage is about 1/2 pound, so I don't understand why the amount shows as "1/8 pound." I would love to make this recipe for 3 people, so I need to halve it. But with these mysterious quantities, it's kind of difficult. Can you help? Thanks.

I have friends in Senegal. They came to San Antonio, TX and cooked this dish for me - MAGNIFICANT It takes a great amount of time to prepare, but the end result is more than magnificant. I wish someone in San Antonio, TX would make this dish for me. Loved it!

I made this recipe without the fish (or okra or cabbage, didn't have any), and it was wonderful. Halved the amounts and it was still enough for dinner and lunch for 2 people. I added a bit of fresh parsley to the veggies and rice at the end, but otherwise stuck to the recipe. Definitely going in regular rotation.

I almost want to say that I am from everywhere too and I love that! Senegal is... let's say, where I first saw the day... This is a great approach to a very complex dish. Thumbs-up to Alexis Touchet and good points Jharris2. Thiof, the fish used for this dish is in fact called Merou in French, and is very close to Seabass but has a much firmer meat. Some people use Tilapia (whole), but the best substitution would be either Grouper or Snapper(big fish for less bones). This is a long process but very succulent dish, and it's even better served with some tamarin pate mixed with a little bit of the both from the fish and vegetables: Just add the tamarin in a small bowl with some broth, mix well. Drizzle on the rice with fresh lime juice when eating. Thiebou'dien (rice and fish) is the Senegalese National dish, and some families prepare it everyday. Just like pasta for some!

This is a respectable adaptation, but I lived in Senegal for 3 years and ate a lot of "cheb." My maid there, Marie, wins the prize for the sublime, 4-fork version. I watched her prepare it many times for our dinner parties and here's what Alexis Touchet didn't do: 1)Pulse a small, fresh hot pepper, and a vegetable bouillon cube with the garlic and parsley rather than cayenne. Reduce the salt in the recipe to compensate for this addition. 2) Whack the whole fish in 3 pieces after it has marinated with the fish paste (called "rof" in Wolof, Senegal's most popular language other than French). They'll be much thicker than steaks. The slits should be in the center of the pieces. Cook them flat side down. This leads to more even cooking and greater ease when serving. 3)Cook the fish BEFORE the vegetables and set aside. That way, there's more flavor in the whole dish. 4)Use chunks of fresh, peeled pumpkin instead of cassava. 5)Cook 2 or 3 whole (with stems attached; you don't want them to break) scotch bonnet peppers with the vegetables. Remove them from the pan and serve in a separate dish so those who want extra spice have that option. 6)Scrape the crusted rice from the bottom of the pan into bowl and serve separately. It's an art to achieve this result and a delicacy to eat, preferably with vegetables and broth over it. Tieboudienne is traditionally eaten while seated on the floor from a communal dish without utensils-- only with the right hand. Marie used "thiof," a firm, white-fleshed, delicately-flavored fish native to Senegal;I've never seen it anywhere else in the world. She would bring it home from the market about an hour after it had been caught. That degree of freshness is hard to find in the US, and you can taste the difference. Finally, the dried fish version is made without tomato paste. It doesn't look as appealing or taste as good. Stick with the fresh; it's much better.

I have International Students in Senegal. When they came to San Antonio, TX, to visit, they made this dish for me and it was out of TEXAS! More than wonderful!
