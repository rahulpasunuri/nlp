This was very good but definitely use unsweetened coconut not sweetened! As mentioned by other reviewers, I cut the cilantro in half.

Rating: 1
Meh. I followed the recipe with the exception of using half coconut milk for the liquid. Not much flavor and just odd with all the cilantro - and I'm a cilantro lover and a rice lover. Come to think of it I like coconut and fresh ginger a lot too. However together, much ado about nothing...totally underwhelming. Waste of good ingredients.

Excellent recipe. I'd like to find a way to make the rice with a little more texture. Otherwise, yummy.

Excellent! Use unsweetened coconutand don't shy away from jalapeno; it adds depth of flavour to this dish rather than heat. Alos, while coconut milk may add further flavour, it also adds many calories! Recipe was immediately requested by those who tasted this dish.

I followed others' advice and used coconut milk to replace half of the water and it was delicious! Even the avowed cilantro haters at my table loved it. It makes a TON though the leftovers are delicious too.

Excellent recipe -- I halved it and didn't include the jalapeno, since the sauce I was serving with the accompanying scallops was already spicy. Instead of baking the rice, I simmered it on low on the stovetop. I also skipped chopping the coconut, scallions, and cilantro and instead stirred them into the rice during the last 5 minutes of steaming. The rice looks beautiful molded in a ring.

Wonderful flavors! I absolutely do not feel the amount of cilantro was overpowering - make as it is written! Will make again! And again!

Well, I rarely go wrong by searching recipes with4 forks, but I did this time. Sorry to be the odd gal out, but this was a waste of rice. We all like cilantro and ginger and coconut, but this was so overpowering with cilantro, and I only used 1 cup unpacked! It also makes WAY TOO MUCH, even considering leftovers (there were 4 of us). If there aren't better rice dishes out there, I'll throw away my chopsticks!

This is PERFECT! I did use a can of light coconut milk to replace the water (I halved the recipe so used only the coconut milk)and both the ginger and jalapeño were also from a jar. The night I made it I fell asleep thinking about how good this was...

Excellent rice dish. My entire family commented on how the rice tasted very fresh. It wouldn't be great on its own, but it is great with chana masala served over it. It is a good substitute for white rice.

Excellent recipe. Made to accompany the South Indian Vegetable Curry from this site, my guests loved the combo. I toasted the coconut in a pan and did the rest as directed, including the soaking of the rice. Not usually much of a rice fan, I will definitely make this again.

Rating: 4
great recipe! I doubled the jalapeno, went half water and half coconut milk, and tossed in some diced pineapple and cashews just before serving. Do rinse and soak the rice before cooking, it makes the dish less starchy. I'll definitely make this again. And again. And...

Rating: 4
I've made this many, many times and the recipe is fantastic as is. I have also made the following successful modifications: sometimes I omit the ginger and scallions, up the coconut to one cup and sub half coconut milk for water, this makes for a less complex but more intensely coconut flavored rice. I serve this with pecan crusted fish with fresh mango salsa and black beans.

Rating: 4
Did the saute method versus oven. Toasted coconut and set aside then sauted ginger, jalapeno, and rice then cooked rice with everything together. Now that I reread the recipe the cilantro, coconut, and scallions should go in after the rice is cooked, this makes sense. It was great for stirfry 2 days later too.

i added minced crystalized ginger chopped mango, pineapple and red pepper.....no blender step as that purees everything like a pesto......just tossed and served at room temp...note the coconut toasts quickly Great side dish for crowd in summer!

I made this recipe the lazy way. I sauteed the jalepeno, ginger, green onions and basmati rice for a couple of minutes ( I did not soak/rince rice). Then I added the coconut. I then added all to a rice cooker with the water and salt. I then added cilantro and cooked as normally I would rice in a rice cooker. It was awesome! Don't be intimidated by the recipe, just saute before adding to rice cooker if you have one.

I cooked this rice as a side dish for the Grilled Pork Tenderloin à la Rodriguez. I loved it and the whole dinner got rave review from my family. No need to alter anything, the flavors in this recipe are well balanced and delicious.

Great recipe! I did not have enough rice so I kind of winged it, but even though I used less rice I used the same amount of ginger, jalepeno and cilanto mixture - and I think it could have used more of all of it! Very mild in flavor the way it was, so next time I will probably do 1.5 - 2x of everything for a more intensely flavored rice, and I think I will cook the rice with coconut milk instead of water to up the coconut flavor. I know I made a lot of comments but really this is an amazing rice - try it! I served it with Bobby Flay's recipe for Ginger-Soy-Lime marinated shrimp and it was fantastic.

Rating: 4
I was serving this with a hot chettinad curry so I left out the jalapeno, and I cooked the rice in the rice cooker with 1/2 coconut milk and half chicken stock. I left out the flaked coconut because I burned it, but I think it was absolutely perfect without it. I would definately make it again to go with any spicy curry.

Rating: 4
This was great. I didn't want to bother with the jalapeno, so I used hot red pepper flakes, and I also did not soak the rice and it turned out fine. I added a little coconut milk b/c I had some on hand, but I don't think it's essential. I will definitely make this again.

Got rave reviews from guests. Served with pecan encrusted chicken and mango salsa. Used brown rice with liquid as directed on package, which takes longer to cook. Didn't soak rice first. Used a little Better than Bullion and 1 can lite coconut milk. Take care with browning coconut. Next time I'll lower temp and check often. (I had to throw out a batch.)This came out a bit like a risotto. Serve warm...probably can be made ahead and reheated in oven to desired temp.

This recipe was amazing! I made it last night for a dinner party for 4 and served it with sugar snap peas and the pan-seared tilapia with chile lime butter also from this site. Everyone loved it! I only made a 1/3 of the recipe and still have tons leftover but it will be great as a base for a yummy chicken rice salad. I also used equal parts chicken broth and coconut milk instead of water.

Made as directed and it was fabulous. Served for a dinner party and everyone loved it! It makes a LOT of rice!

Heavenly! Definitely recommend using coconut milk in place of some of the water. I used sweetened flake coconut and my rice did not turn out too sweet, but perfect. I also used shallots instead of scallions. To those who ended up with green rice, next time just leave the cilantro mix more coarse instead of pureed and you'll get the great flavor without the green color.

I made the rice with half basmati and half long grain to equal the 3c. Added coconut milk to the rice as it cooked. Served with Jamaican Jerk Chicken and grilled vegetables. Spectacular!

Excellent thai side dish. the cilantro is a must. I didn't have a jalepeno so i skipped it. the only reason i didn't give it 4 forks is that it needed to be a bit sweeter or have more ginger. I used coconut milk instead of water and it was so delicious and had great flavor.

Rating: 3
I had all of the ingredients except the jalapeno and didn't feel like running to the store just for that, so made it without the jalapeno. Probably a mistake. The rice was very good, but could have used a bit more kick. Won't leave it out next time. Served the rice with the South Indian Vegetable Curry (also on Epicurious) and it was a great combination.

This recipe is fantastic! I substituted sushi rice out of necessity, and it came out a little mushy, but still good. I also used the sweetend coconut, which really did add something. I served it with some stir-fried green beans and tofu seasoned with sesame oil and soy sauce for a vegetarian meal. It went together very well, and I have lots and lots of leftover rice.

This is a fabulous way to prepare rice. I made it for a potluck and the dish was one of the first finished! I like spicy though, so next time I would add more jalapeno.

Made 1/2 this recipe for 4 people and when I set it on the table I thought we'd have a ton of leftovers. Boy, was I wrong! Everyone loved it! I didn't have scallions, so I sauteed some onion with the ginger and jalapeno. I also used a little extra jalapeno as we like our food with a kick. I was cooking at a relatives and couldn't find a food processor, so I simply chopped the toasted coconut and cilantro and added them to the rice with the salt. I ended up using less oil this way too. Will definitely make it again.

I make this dish regularly, but with some changes. I skip the ginger-jalapenos, and I use UNSWEETENED coconut. The taste is subtle but excellent, the dish is pretty, a bit easier to make, and has fewer calories. My family loves it, and friends rave.

So delicious! After cooking the dish seemed to be missing something so I did add some chicken broth and coconut milk (very little of the latter). From now on I will cook the rice in half water, half chicken broth just to kick up the flavor a bit. I did use unsweetened coconut and that seemed to work quite well.

I used some form of process low fat coconut from Whole Foods that worked really well here. Coconut flavor was just right without any toasting even. Worked well with asian inspired shish kabobs (also with cilantro) on this web site. Yummy!

I was amazed at how well this dish turned out - definitely don't skimp on the cilantro & green onion. I was initially tempted to use a veg broth to cook the rice, but for visual appeal, you want the white grains to stand out cleanly against the green of the cilantro mixture, so I'd recommend plain water (or water mixed with coconut milk). I also increased the toasted coconut to 1c, and added a squeeze of lime. Outstanding!

I served this as a side dish to an indian summer BBQ buffet. Everyone loved it! Especially my husband who kept eating it as we were cleaning up! Definitely soak the rice, it truly does seem to make the rice stronger and takes away the "starchy" flavor you can sometimes get with rice. Instead of a jalapeno pepper I used one finely chopped serrano pepper...great flavor and not too hot.

Rating: 3
This is delightful--very mild, slightly sweet, and a perfect complement to seafood or tofu. Don't make my mistake and think the flavors will be too pungent: I reduced the cilantro & scallions by half, then missed the extra flavor. Also, be warned: this recipe makes about 15 side servings (though we'll have no problem eating it left over!). The toasted coconut is a real plus. Yum!

Made this rice last night, served with a butterflied leg of lamb marinated with Indian spices and grilled. It was great. I sauteed 2 finely chopped shallots with the jalapeno and ginger, then only added 2 scallions to the cilantro mixture. (One guest doesn't really like raw onions.) Also added 1/2 tsp garam masala to saute mix. Cooked rice with half water, half chicken broth and 1/2 cup of coconut milk. Made rice in the late morning and then reheated. Made cilantro mixture ahead also and stirred it in right before serving. As other cooks, I also used unsweetened coconut which was so finely grated that I didn't pulse it with the cilantro, just stirred it in at the end also. This is truly a "fragrant" dish.

The whole family enjoyed this dish. I used lite coconut milk and chicken broth for the liquid and omited the jalapeno as the kids can't handle the heat. I used my rice cooker and the rice came out fantastic. In addition to the cilantro mixture, I added a good squeeze of lime. I sprinkled some chili flakes on my rice and it gave it the perfect blend of sweet, salty and spicy. I will try it with the jalepeno on a night when the kids are away.

This is a new favorite - we LOVE it! Served it for a dinner party on Saturday night and it was DELISH! We actually made the rice in a rice cooker - I sauteed the ginger and jalepeno, and added it to the rice and water in the cooker, then stirred in the cilantro mixture when we were ready to eat. This way the rice stayed warm in the cooker, but didn't get mushy. Guests all raved. We served skewered chicken laid across the rice, next to a mango salad (Epicurious recipe - also excellent!).

This rice has the right amount of zip. The combination of toasted coconut, ginger cilantro, and hot peppers is enticing. I served it with a Mexican meal but agree with the reviewer who said it'd make an awesome side dish for Middle Eastern meals. Putting it together is so speedy too. It's a make-again recipe for me.

Following the directions exactly, the rice came out very green, yes, and it essentially tasted green, as well. No flavor except that of the cilantro came through, not even a hint of nut or sweetness. I will not be repeating this experiment!

Terrific. I used regular white short-grain rice, and it was fine. Also, if you have a rice cooker, you can just cook the rice the way you normally wood with the ginger, etc. When it is cooked, you can stir in the puree.

This was a nice variation on the usual basmati rice preparation and it went beautifully with the chicken tikka menu. We too used unsweeted coconut and it was fine. I do agree that it toasts surprisingly fast so keep an eye on it.

This was an interesting combination of flavors. I added some soybeans and it was a wonderful vegetarian main dish. I couldn't taste the jalapeno, so next time I would probably double it. Also, I didn't care for the sweetness, so I would probably use unsweetened coconut, although my roommates really loved it, so it's totally a matter of personal preference.
