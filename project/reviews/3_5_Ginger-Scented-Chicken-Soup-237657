A very easy soup to make and clean in its flavors. The ginger flavor did not come through foir me as much as I expected so addded some ginger paste to taste at the end. The additions of mushrooms and cabbage, as others suggested are good, and I also finished ti off with fresk cilantro for color and taste at the end.

I added a stalk of lemon grass and this really brought the flavors together. Try serving over white rice instead of noodles. A family favorite.

I, too, skipped the carrots, although they might have paired well with the ginger flavor. I added all the cilantro at the beginning and simmered until the chicken was done. Removed the meat and put carcass back into pot; simmered for a couple of hours, then discarded solids and refrigerated broth. The fat all lifted off nicely the next day. As someone else suggested, I added sliced shitake mushrooms and Napa cabbage. Wonderful flavor and easy to do.

At first it tasted bland until I added "Dynasty" Chinese 5 Spices - it kicked it up a few notches. I also added Napa cabbage and sliced mushrooms - Yummo! I will make this soup again.

Soup was really good! Added cayenne pepper, lemon juice and pepper at the end. Wanted to add a lemon rind while simmering the chicken instead of the juice at the end, but I forgot! Didn't use all the cilantro it asked for though and I was little short on the ginger sticks.

I loved this soup. It is simple, comforting, and satisfying. I thought the ginger would be too much, but I was wrong. I like the suggestions by others and may try adding a few things, but the simplicity of the soup is what makes it so good. So easy to make and that makes it four forks.

Delicious soup - we made it without cilantro! Loved it!

A tasty, comforting soup; love the ginger/cilantro/chicken combo. I agree with the cook from Spain that it could use a little something extra--I'm leaning towards chili, myself. That may be because I made this as a cold remedy and my taste buds are not at their best.

Made this twice. Added more ginger and cilantro the second time and skimmed the fat. Lite and fulfilling. People added sesame oil and chili paste to their liking. Good for lunch.

I thought this was a very good soup. On a cold day when you want some Asian flavored soup, or when you have a cold. I thought it could use some greens like baby bok choy thrown in at the end and a drizzle of sesame seed oil

this is like a dish i was addicted to from a vietnamese cafe in melbourne, no carrots, the final serving had rice plus chicken mince balls flavoured with fish sauce, cilantro, green onion and it was soothing, comforting and very like this one....try sprinkling in those deep fried crispy shallots you get from the asian shops for more flavour

I made this as a convalescing soup, I liked it, my husband did not. I used rice noodles to eliminate offending foods (wheat) and thought it was fine, better than standard chicken soup. I guess if I were the patient, I'd make it for me, not so much for others in my family.

Used sherry and was great. Don't award 4 forks because it still needs something, like some thai chile or maybe some onion for the 1st step of the stock, or maybe both. We'll try and maybe post again later.
