beautiful presentation and equally tasty! I highly recommend it. Was quite filling when paired with a pasta.

This salad is very nice warm or cold, whatever time of the year it's prepared. To call it a 'Winter' salad is a little misleading, at least in my part of the world. It is impossible to find fresh basil in the winter here.

this salad was the hit of my last dinner party! The only variation I made was in presentation - I cut the fresh mozzarella into slices and stacked the ingredients - mozza/tomato/pesto - repeat to make 3 layers of each, topping with the the pesto and toasted pinenuts. I also served the tomatoes still warm from the oven. By the time they arrived at the table, the olive oil, tomato juice and pesto had dribbled to the bottom and made a gorgeous pattern around the base of the tower. I really think having the tomatoes still warm was what made this dish incredible. I'll definitely serve it again (and again, and again).

This was a good alternative to your traditional caprese salad especially when good tomatoes are hard to find. I used a good quality jarred pesto to save myself some time in the kitchen and it was still quite good.

I enjoyed this recipe because it was such a nice change from an ordinary salad. Its easy, just make sure you get great,soft mozzarella!

Our dinner club made this menu. The flavors were wonderful together. Next time I would cook the tomatoes at a higher temperature. I had followed the recipe and only cooked them until soft after two hours. When we ate them they were rather mushy. But the flavors were great. We added some good bread. Yum!

Very good. I also drizzled the juice from the roasted tomatoes over the salad as it was so flavourful. Excellent when raw tomatoes are not at their best.
