I made this for an anniversary party and it was greatly enjoyed. Since most of the guests prefer tartness in lemon desserts, I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup. The desert was made in a 1 1/2 quart casserole dish for 40 minutes.

This was simple, delicious, and elegant. Will definitely make again!

I made this with splenda, and used 1/2 cup. It worked perfectly. So delicious! I have also made it with 1/2 cup sugar with excellent results. It is one of my kid's favorite desserts.

I made this because I wanted to use up some buttermilk. The results were acceptable but not great. The pudding was too sweet (and I almost never think things are too sweet!). I prefer the Cook's Illustrated version of the recipe.

This is the perfect summertime dessert for three reasons: #1- It's SUPER quick and doesn't require hours in the kitchen (but has the opposite appearance). #2- It can be garnished with fresh summer berries and mint to keep it seasonal. #3- It's the ideal portion size, is relatively light, and is wows everyone each time I make it! I'll make this dessert again and again. Still need to experiment using dried buttermilk, and if that works, I usually have all ingredients on hand!

Really easy and delicious!

I have a key lime tree in my back yard so I used the grated peel and juice from my key limes. Served cold with a little dab of sweetened whipped cream. Superb!

My family loved this! I had some buttermilk I needed to use, and I always have Meyer lemons from the backyard, so this was perfect. Didn't separate into two layers, though-- more like individual souffles, light and delicious!

Light and delicious, although when held in the fridge for the next day, the cake on top got a bit mushy. I didn't have any buttermilk, and substituted 1.5 T vinegar + soymilk to fill a one-cup measuring cup, which worked well. It was done after 30 minutes.

easy, delicious, perfect. I baked them for 35 min - a little too long ( a little too brown on the top), so watch after 25-30 min. I served them room temperature.

I was looking for a light dessert to follow a birthday dinner of boeuf bourguignon, and this was perfect. It took no time at all, it was simple to prepare (I followed the directions to the letter, except for adding just a touch more lemon juice), and it made a nice presentation served with a dollop of whipped cream and a few raspberries. The texture was ethereally light, with a tender crust on top. Don't hesitate to try it.

Scrumptious & excellent! Add a few berries and a sprig of mint to top it off. I used Meyer lemons as I usually do for baking - not as tart.

Really really good. Next time just a bit less sugar and just a bit more lemon. Margaret is one of my favorite authors and now one of my favorite dessert makers. Thank you MA

Super easy, quick recipe that impresses with its fluffy souffle over velvety custard textures. Hot it tastes like a lemon hug. :)

Good taste but custard was totally watery.

Easy, make ahead recipe that wowed my guests. I frequently fault lemon recipes for their lack of tartness. Not this baby. A definite keeper.

Easy. Nicely tart. I baked it in a rectangular dish because i have no ramekins and 35 minutes was about right.

Surprisingly easy for looking like they were difficult to make! I think I need to work on the sugar/lemon balance (or measure better). These are boldly flavored.

I love this recipe! It is light and airy and wonderfully lemony! I have been making this for years, as a recipe handed down from my grandmother. I bake mine in a 1 1/2 quart baking dish in a roasting pan with hot water. It is delicious either warm or chilled.

Oh.....forgot to mention that I finished them off with just 30 secs. under the broiler, as they seemed done but weren't browned enough.

Wow! I feel like a five year old because I just couldn't believe how the cake formed on the top of the custard! Just terrific and makes you seem really impressive to your friends. I put a dollop of fresh vanilla whipped cream with some fresh blueberries as a garnish.....but you really don't have to do anything to these.....great just how they are!

Just made it tonight for dessert for my family. Followed recipe exactly. After baking, the drained the hot water and filled baking pan with cold water and ice cube to let it cool a little for about 10 minutes. It was delicious. Cool cake on top with a warm custard on the bottom. I served it with whipped cream and fresh blueberries on top.

Easy as pie... well, this is easier. Everyone loves it. Great if you have too many lemons.

Forgot to mention - if using Meyer lemons, you must reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup. Then it's perfect.

Lovely! Didn't have buttermilk so used 1/2 cup plain yogurt and 1/2 cup milk and it still came out sublime. Wanted an easy, low carb, lemony treat and this is it. How neat that Ms Atwood creates good food as well as good literature too!

I used Splenda instead of sugar and it was delicious and low carb. I will definitely make this again as it was so easy. The tart taste satisfied.

The egg whites make a nice contrast in texture and color to the rich lemon custard. Next time I'll try a little less sugar--1/2 cup rather than 3/4. A quick and easy dessert. I used a single 8"x8" cake pan. A deep pie pan would work too.
