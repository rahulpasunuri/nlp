I was looking for something new to do with salmon, and this recipe worked perfectly! The sauce alone is fantastic! I am gong to keep the sauce recipe handy as a standby for any time I want my Thai Curry fix! I am sure it will go good with chicken over rice as well.

Rating: 4
This dish was excellent. I followed the recipe exactly. To prepare, I placed the rice on the plate first, then the Salmon, then the vegetables. I spooned the sauce all the way around the plate and over the top of the salmon and vegetables - topped it with chopped peanuts - delish!

Very tasty and mild. We doubled the curry paste and added some crushed chilis to add zip to the sauce.

In the last paragraph "put each in center of plate..." It should read "put RICE in the center of each plate". It's a typo. And it's a wonderful dish.

My family loved this! I substituted light coconut milk and it worked very well. The recipe isn't very clear regarding the vegetables - it is basically like a slaw-style salad and you serve the salmon on top. I used Napa cabbage and also added shredded carrots for color, served the salmon on top and put the sauce directly on the salmon and slaw. I also cooked the rice on the stove top without butter.

Rating: 4
Very good and quick to prepare. Made a few preference changes - Grilled the salmon on a cedar plank (salmon, curry and cedar go well together), used 1 C shredded bok choy with 2 c shredded cabbage, used fire roasted diced tomatoes and a bit of tomato sauce.

Just don't use old curry powder. If you do, make sure your husband is on hand to fix it with vanilla and more brown sugar.

Delicious! I added a few sliced mushrooms to the sauce, and cooked the salmon in the oven with some extra garlic and ginger. I didn't prepare the vegetables, but think they would have been a wonderful addition to the meal, and probably would have given it the 4-fork review. I didn't find the heat too overwhelming, but I did add a splash of water to the sauce as it was a bit thick for my taste. Also cooked the rice on the stovetop like others. Will make again.

Very delicious sauce. It needed that lime flavor so I added a tablespoon of fresh juice. I could taste the soy sauce flavor, thought it was a little strong. Next time I will try subbing fish sauce and see what happens...

This is a delicious dish! There is quite a bit of prep work, but once that is done, the rest is easy. It started raining right before we began cooking, so we sauteed the salmon rather than grilling it outside. You have to try it!

It got raves, but the recipe lacks an explanation of how to combine the elements. "Put each in center of four plates"? But the flavors are great.

The sauce was delicious although if I hadn't had extra hands in the kitchen, the garlic and ginger would have suffered tremendously. Also I used smoked paprika and it was so delicious. Yum. I also boiled the basamati, my normal preparation. I had planned to make cilantro rice, but the sauce for the dish was so overwhelming.

Rating: 4
Definitely a keeper. I didn't have the vegetables so I tossed asparagus with the rice wine vinegar and soy sauce then grilled. I also didn't have red curry powder or red curry paste. Substituted Hot Curry Powder and Chinese Chili Sauce. It wasn't too hot for us but if I was serving it to others I would probably use the Mild Curry Powder that I have. Served it with a Chandon Sparkling Pinot Noir.

Rating: 3
The sauce is very tasty. I made the rice in the rice cooker and grilled the salmon in a grill pan on the stove (liberally coated with fresh ground pepper and kosher salt). I only had on hand some cucumber and cilantro so I soaked the cucumber in rice wine vinegar then topped it with some chopped cilantro. A very tasty and easy dinner.

Rating: 4
I have made this several times for guests and just my husband, always great. I use the broc. slaw in the produce section and add the cucumber, makes the salad simple and since we are not huge fans of cilantro, cut it a bit w/ basil and parsley this time, really good.

Rating: 4
The friends I served it to liked every part of the meal, from the salmon, to the salad, to the sauce. There are some problems with the way the recipe is set up, though: the salmon is listed in the "For Vegetables" section. There is no explanation of what to do with the soy sauce and rice vinegar in the "For Vegetables" section. And the last part of the instructions say, "Place each in center," without saying what "each" references. I figured it all out, but it could use some editing.

Rating: 4
This is weeknight-easy but company worthy, got rave reviews both times I've made it, and I set a pretty high standard for what I consider company worthy (it usually takes at least 5 hours of cooking with 4 courses). However, having made the recipe both ways, I greatly prefer a sauce without the paprika, cumin, coriander, tomato, and brown sugar, and will make it without from now on. Also, I made my basmati rice on the stovetop, no reason to turn on the oven for 4 servings of rice! Use wild King Salmon for an over-the-top meal.

Rating: 4
Great recipe! I agree with everyone on the weird rice preparation method; did it on stovetop without any international incidents breaking out. Also I put the salmon in for 20 minutes at 400 rather than putting them on the grill, as there is still snow on the grill. Now. Let's discuss the sauce. This sauce is incredibly great. It's true that there are Indian tendencies with the curry and cumin, but there is no mistaking this for a Thai curry, and it's "hey can you pass me more of that awesome sauce" awesome. The vegetables make a nice complement for the dish and really shouldn't be omitted. Wouldn't change a thing on this dish, other than the cooking methods mentioned above.

This recipe is soo soo yummy! This was the fist homecooked meal I made for my boyfriend's family and it was a huge hit! I made it with chicken instead of salmon, doubled the sauce recipe and cooked the rice on the stovetop only...other than that I followed the recipe to a t. They said that they don't have to go out for Thai food anymore...just request this recipe!

We thought this was amazing with the mix of flavours, crunchy bites, and the fact that afterwards we weren't feeling "stuffed" was a bonus. I experimented on my husband tonight but look forward to serving it to my friends. Awesome. I want more already!

This was over the top delicious. My husband said it was the best salmon recipe he has ever tasted. I made the rice on top of the stove. I used the entire can of coconut milk and increased all the spices. I baked the salmon in the oven for 20 minutes at 400. I chopped the peanuts. This does taste like a Thai dish if you make it the way the recipe says. You put the salmon on the plate first, rice, sauce on top of rice and cabbage salad on top and peanuts last. I would definitly make this again and have already recommended it to some friends.

It was good but sauce was too sweet and the combination of Thai and Indian tasted strange... too strong. Not the clean Thai flavour I was looking for. Will not make again.

OMG...this was the best curry sauce I have ever had. Don't skip any of the spices as it gives this sauce depth. I used green thai curry paste since I didn't have red and it was just as good. I didn't use it with salmon, I used it with beef that I marinated in a korean marinade. It was fantastic. My boyfriend couldn't get enough of this sauce.

Oh My Gosh! This is the best curry sauce I have ever had. All of spices create a depth to the sauce. I didn't have red curry paste so I used green curry paste and it turned out fine. We didn't eat it with salmon, we used it on grilled flank steak and wok'd veggies. It is awesome. I could have licked the plate.

This was a super tasty dish. The only differences were that we used more veggies cut like matchsticks- carrots, pea pods, red pepper and then sauteed them so they were served hot with the rest of the dish. I didn't realize I only had roasted red curry paste, but the sauce was still very delicious. My husband says this is a restaurant quality dish. I will definitely use this sauce and substitute different meat, fish, chicken and veggies.

Loved the curry, it is so so good. Made exactly as written. Except for the rice part, which is insanely the wrong time for cooking - after 12 minutes, I had a nice pool of water, melted butter, and uncooked rice! Put it on the stove for another 5 minutes on full blast and it worked out more or less. In any event, this is all about the curry, and it's awesome!

This was a wonderfully simple and delicious recipe. I did not change a thing and was delighted with the result. I did make full portions of rice and vegetables and served them with two salmon fillets, so if you are making for four I might suggest upping the rice or veggie content. The sauce is marvelous and I think you could easily use it on other dishes.

Made this last night and really like it. The sauce is great - very easy and super tasty. It would go well with satay skewers, chiken or shrimp. Put the whole can of coconut milk in because it seemed silly to leave such a small amount & as far as I could tell it made no difference. Didn't bother with the verggies, did steamed broccoli instead - maybe next time. Would actually give this 3 1/2 forks if I could figure out how!

I felt a little guilty accepting praise for this meal, secretly knowing how easy it was to make. The only modifications I made were: I grated extra ginger on a very fine rasp, added fresh pressed garlic & sea salt to coat the salmon . I also used more lite coconut milk to ensure the Thai sauce was not too hot for my guests. I served this dish alongside my version of a Thai appetizer - butter leaf lettuce wraps with choices of finely chopped cilantro, mint, peanuts, fresh bay shrimp, onions & sweet chili sauce. Fresh, flavorful & FAST.

Just made this last night after extensively reading all of the reviews, and I am sorry to say I'm disappointed with the result. I agree with other reviewers that the sauce is really good and a breeze to prepare, but I didn't like it at all with the salmon. The flavors of the salmon and sauce did not meld well at all -- would have been much better with a milder white fish or chicken. I decreased the red curry paste to only 1/2 tsp. based on other comments, and am glad I did -- it was the perfect heat for us. Thought the sauce was a little sweet, so will cut back on the brown sugar next time as well. Served with jasmine rice but think the basmati would have been better. Will make again, but will save the salmon for a more complimentary sauce.

Rating: 4
Wow -- very easy, and very classy. great combination of textures and complex, yet subtle, flavors. Not spicy, but very flavorful. I added some lightly steamed julienned carrots and pea pods to the vegtables. Otherwise, followed the recipe pretty much as written. Will definitely make this again, and will add it to our "impress the company" list.

I can't believe how something so simple can be so good! This sauce was fabulous - tasted exactly like what we would eat in a Thai restaurant, although I agree with other reviewers that it wasn't at all spicy. Next time I'll cut down the amount of rice vinegar to add to the veggies (too much in the bottom of the bowl) and toss at the last minute so they don't wilt. The peanuts and rice vinegar really gave it an authentic Thai taste. The sauce was so good that hubby and I both served ourselves more with some rice!

I just made this for a dinner party last evening and it was a huge hit! My guests included a gentleman who regularly eats out at 5-star restaurants, and he was very impressed with it. My husband usually doesn't like his food "mixed together" so I considered serving each component separately on the plate, but in the end I served it as suggested and am so glad I did! It was beautiful to behold and delicious and enjoy! It was also a fairly easy dish to prepare for company. I got everything done ahead of time, and at the end, only had to barbecue the salmon, cook the rice (very easy) and toss the veggies with the dressing. It left me plenty of time to socialize with my guests, and isn't that the point? Don't hesitate to try this!

Rating: 4
My teenage girls made the salmon and rice, along with some steamed green beans for my 42nd birthday dinner party! It was outstanding. We used curry paste instead of powder and didn't have any coriander, and the sauce was delicious. Red thai paste adds a great spice to the dish. We cooked the salmon on an indoor grill and it was cooked to perfection with the 5 minutes per side instruction. I am not good a cooking rice - the idea to rinse the rice after cooking with hot water made the rice nice and fluffy!

Rating: 4
I make this dish whenever I want to impress guests but I don't have much time. The last time I made it, I subbed rice noodles for the rice (soaked noodles in cold water for an hour, then folded them into the curry sauce, which I always double) and served it family style: curry noodles, salmon, relish, on separate serving plates. The family liked it better that way, and we all loved the curry noodles better than the rice, especially my 16-month-old son.

Rating: 4
YUM!! This, like all good recipies, is a great base to work with. For the veggies (and I don't like alot of mint though I keep it in the garden, so I halved it.)I didn't have enough cabbage so I subbed some shredded brocolli stems (peeled and grated, about 1/2 and 1/2 with the cabbage). For garnish I tossed on some chopped fresh basil and served with lime wedges. So Thai it was!!!

This was very tasty, but I don't know why previous reviewers were saying that it was too spicy with the full amount of curry paste. I made the recipe as written and even my children didn't think it was too hot. They were ladling the sauce on their rice. Go for it!

This is a wonderful recipe. If you order 3+ stars at Thai restaurants then definately do not half the amount of curry paste. I thought the spice of the curry was perfectly balanced with the coolness of the slaw. This dish is also delightful with a bottle of beaujolais nouveau.

Originally loved this dish at Terra Restaurant in Napa Valley and served it many times to rave reviews from guests at dinner parties. Sauce can be made the prior day (helps control strong curry fragrance in your home).

Quite delish! I left out the cucumbers and used the cabbage/carrot mix that you buy in a bag.

Next time I'd like to try it with the real thing. The recipe is really very easy if you have all ingredients organized.

I really liked the sauce, and would definately make again - might try on shrimp as others have suggested. Heat was just about where I like it but I would use less paste if making for guests.

I've tried similar fusions before but again, with only so-so results. Maybe I'm using the wrong Indian curry powder (any recommendations out there?) On the plus side (and the reason for the three fork rating) the veggie toping was great!! Simple, crisp and fresh... a perfect accompanyment to a spicy dish.

I made this recipe tonight with a few minor modifications and it turned out delicious! First of all I doubled the sauce recipe and I used chicken breast cut into bite-sized cubes sauteed with a little oil, soy sauce and lemongrass. I added the chicken directly to the sauce and let it simmer on low heat while the rice was cooking. I also added a few torn leaves of fresh basil and juice from half a lime to the chicken and sauce while it was simmering. I served it over jasmine rice instead of basmati. I used Mae Ploy brand red curry paste, which is in my opinion, well worth tracking down. But beware it is pretty fiery. The Asian supermarkets around here all carry it. Next time I will probably do chicken on lemongrass skewers with the sauce poured over. I made a green salad with ginger dressing instead of the slaw.

Rating: 2
Agree with another reviewer that it wasn't very "Thai tasting". Our initial reaction was "Wow, this is good." After a few bites, we were backing off a bit. I think the spices were a little too overpowering for us. I'm willing to give it another shot, though.

To the "Chef from Alexandria", this is not a soy-based glaze. I made the salmon curry sans veggies. I used a sweet curry powder which made it flavorful but not spicy. I served it over coconut basmati rice. The veggies were an Indian cauliflower potato dish ala Maddhur Jaffrey. I note that the same recipe on the Terra website includes much more finicky instructions which were the ones that I followed. I think of this as Thai-inspired. I wanted to taste my salmon, too :)

This was fantastic and really simple. We will try it with over chicken next time. I did lessen the amount of curry paste and it was a perfect amount of heat. WE also didn't have basmati rice - we used regular rice and cooked the rice as per the package. We will be making this one again!

I've only put a 3 fork rating because I didn't have all the ingredients to follow the recipe to a T. This was a last minute thing. I didn't have coconut milk so used water and dessicated coconut and I didn't have the vegetables so used what I had. Although I thought the sauce wasn't very 'Thai' tasting, it was still very good. I will make it again.

This recipe is great! I made it a few times before making it for company. They all devoured it, even the non-fish lovers. I love hot food but halved the Thai curry paste. It might just be that the brand I used (Thai Kitchen) was hot, test your own. It was such a nice mix of flavors. I usually like salmon with red wine but enjoyed this thoroughly with savignon blanc. It seemed to enhance the cucumber, cilantro and mint. SO good! I want to make this again and experiment with kaffir lime leaf or lemon grass or nuc mom. If you like Thai flavors you will love this.

I am only rating this with 3 forks because I could not find curry paste anywhere (last minute) and though that was very discouraging, everyone really loved this.

My favorite dish was created at Terra restaurant in the Napa Valley, CA and after 4 years attempting to replicate it, I was delighted to learn all it's secret ingredients in Gourmet-July '97. This is a fabulous entertaining dish that I've served many times with rave reviews and it's so easy to make. The 'slaw' can be made hours in advance, then add dressing before serving. I don't change recipe - the mix of flavors is so wonderful, but I follow the rice instructions on package instead of using oven. Beautiful stacked presentation adds to enjoyment.

My husband made this for Valentine's Day, and it was fabulous! I would have been happy with it if I'd ordered it in a restaurant. Our tip: you can buy bags of shredded veggies- I think he used a cabbage, broccoli, and carrot mix, and it made the salad prep time trivial. :^)

this was sooo good have to make it again with shrimp this time and will add carrots, oyster mushrooms, onion, beansprouts and broccoli can hardly wait to try! The salmon was very good and will double the curry sauce as I felt like it would be wonderful with anything!

I made this (kind of) for christmas eve dinner and everyone loved it. I used a whole side of salmon and roasted it in the oven instead of grilling, and I made sauted baby bok choy intead of the vegetables. The sauce is SOOO good with the salmon. Add more curry paste if you like things a little spicy. I will definetly make this again and double the sauce so I can freeze some in small servings. for 2.

I made this recipe as is and was happy with the outcome and overall quality of the dish (3 forks). I had some sauce left over and decided to be creative with the following recipe: Grilled Shrimp, Thai Curry Sauce and Thai Cucumber Salad with Roasted Peanuts (also on this site). I have always laughed at reviews when they totally change the recipes and then rate them. I changed the recipe to what I can now rate with 4 forks and would strongly recommend that you give it a try. The sauce is fabulous and when coupled with the new ingredients makes a terrific meal.

I agree that this is a tasty sauce, and good over chicken too. I will make it again and again, as it's easy and fun. But, I don't think it was too authentic, if that's what you happen to be looking for. Otherwise, it's great, and good with spinach thrown in too (instead of the veggies).

Honestly, CA cook, the curry brand doesn't really matter for this recipe. Maybe others know something I don't, but I think it would taste good with any curry powder from the grocery store. Make it--you won't be disappointed! :) (Here's my old review: I absolutely loved this recipe. The flavors complement eachother so well and the curry sauce is totally yummy...doesn't take a lot of time either. I can't wait to make it again.)

This sauce was great. I didn't have the tomato when I made the sauce, but it turned out great without it. Also good on rice, chicken and even lentils. Will definitely make this on a regular basis.

To the Santa Monica cook: No, tomato paste is not the same as puree. Paste is a thick, concentrated form of tomato whereas puree is just whipped up tomatoes, much runnier. Best to buy tomato paste in tubes (which only the Europeans make, so far as I know) rather than in the cans, because it keeps neatly in your fridge for a long time. You can buy it at Bay Cities on Lincoln Blvd. in Santa Monica.

We make this dish at least once a week using different meats (chicken is our favorite)and only making the sauce and rice. My husband uses a little less chili paste to make it less hot and we use the reduced fat coconut milk to cut some of the calories and fat.

The recipe kind of keep you hanging about what to do with all the rice you've cooked. Also, I would leave out the mint leaves althogether. With the modifications I've mentioned above I would definitely make this recipe again. It is easy to prepare and makes for a nice summer brunch or patio dinner meal.

We have prepared barbecued salmon many different ways over the years, but no recipe we have tried has been better than this. The Thai sauce is lovely (the small amount left over was finished with a spoon!), and could work with other dishes - nobody found it too hot at all. The vegetable accompaniment is just right, and the whole thing (salmon, rice, vegetables, and sauce) not only tastes good, but looks good.

The dish was absolutely fabulous. It was a wonderful surprise dinner for me from my boyfriend for our anniversary. The fish was perfectly spiced and so tender, and the basmati rice was a perfect companion. I continue to eat the cabbage and rice wine vinegar concoction on a regular basis. MUST TRY THIS RECIPE......

Terrific, easy recipe. We like spice, so I added extra curry paste and curry powder. The sauce is incredibly flavorful for the minimal prep time. (I also served it over cous cous instead of rice for a weeknight dinner to shorten the cooking time.)

Steamed rice on stovetop (without butter), used extra Thai red curry sauce, used lite coconut milk, added extra rice vinegar and soy sauce to veggies and broiled the salmon -- it was really great. Also put edible flowers on each plate to brighten up the presentation.

Nice, but I think this would be better with some modifications. I would tone down the heat in the sauce, and jazz up the vegetables. Cabbage is a little boring; julienned carrots, jicama, and radishes would might be better.

Amazing describes this dish perfectly! It's so good we had to have it again the next night. (The sauce reheats beautifully in the microwave). Can't wait to share it with guests!!

I make this salmon often--it's our favorite cooked salmon. Definitely add more curry paste to the sauce for people that like it spicy. I usually make the rice on the stovetop or in the rice cooker instead of baking it. The salmon and rice is also great with a crisp veggie stir-fry.

I did the chopping and preparation of the marinade the night before. I did not have fresh mint so used mint chutney...very good. I marinated the salmon in the sauce overnight, before grilling. Everyone loved it and I am going to use it again soon. A WOWing presentation!

I have never written a review of a recipe before, but this one is worth writing about. It was great. I did add a tsp of fish sauce because it was with thai curry paste and my Thai sister-in-law would have insisted. I will definitely serve it at my next dinner party. To make it even more eye catching, form the rice in a cup (I used a 1 cup measuring cup) and turn it out on the plate.

Absolutely amazing!!! I made this with a couple of minor changes .....substituted basil for the cilantro in the slaw, baked the salmon, used coconut ginger rice and added some julienned red pepper to the slaw for colour. It was fabulous. The finished dish is very impressive looking and the overall taste does not disappoint. It's an incredible blend of flavours .... every forkful offers a new taste experience. Big hit! The best part??? It was very easy to make yet looked as though I had slaved over it. Will be making this again ... and soon!

I made this for nine people this past weekend. I started with a Thai pumpkin and coconut milk soup and a dessert of mango yogurt mousse finished the meal, both from this site. I broiled the fish instead of grilling it, I put a little lime juice on it in addition to the salt, pepper and olive oil. It turned out very nicely. The sauce is absolutely delicious, I backed off the curry paste a tiny bit, but pretty much followed the recipe otherwise. People who don't like hot things were asking for thirds. The vegatables make a nice presentation and help cut the heat.

This recipe was wonderful. I was unable to grill the salmon due to the rainy whether but simply pan-searing still turned out a terrific dish that I would be more than eager to make again. The cabbage provides a pleasant crunch to complement the salmon and rice and the curry was delicious.

A very nice recipe. I made it as a part of a Thai style dinner and my guests loved it. I used Chinese cabbage in the vegetable mixture and I searched out a good brand (Namjai) of red curry paste. For dessert I made Tropical Bananas Foster, an incredible finish to a wonderful meal.

A lovely dish to serve to friends who like salmon. I prefer salmon just grilled or poached and usually forget the sauces. This recipe is the exception! This sentence from the recipe is a little confusing: "Put each in center of 4 plates and arrange salmon on top." Will Epicurious fix it?

I first made this receipe in 1998. I have made in numerous times since. It is a great receipe to make and freeze for when you want something delicious without having to do a lot of work.

It was just too spicy for me but my husband loved it. We both agreed that maybe salmon isn't the best choice for this sauce. Salmon is great on its own and this sauce was too much for it. It just didn't need the salmon. Maybe shrimp or chicken would be better?

This recipe is great as is. The Thai Red Curry Sauce can easily be made into a Thai Peanut Sauce by just adding 1/4 cup of natural creamy peanut butter and some sprigs of Thai Basil. Salmon can be poached on top of stove if you don't want to heat oven. The combination of rice, salmon, vegetables and red curry sauce is a marriage made in culinary heaven.

Rating: 4
Fabulous sauce! I didn't feel like grilling, so I added a cup of non-fat yogurt and baked the salmon in the sauce for about 20 minutes at 400F. (My salmon fillets were really thick, so the sauce did NOT overpower the fish). I also used reduced fat coconut milk. Didn't have tomato puree' on hand so I used ketchup (don't cringe -- it's just tomato puree', vinegar and sugar) and reduced the brown sugar. Definitely a keeper.

This is the best and most versatile Thai curry sauce I have ever had. I invariably have it available when I entertain whether as a main Thai course (with chicken, shrimp, veggies or a combination thereof as I am not a salmon fan) or as a dipping sauce for spring rolls or cold veggies. Guests always ask for the recipe.

This was delicious. A big hit at my dinner party. the presentation was beautiful, however, I would like to see a little more color next time. Perhaps I will add some julienned red bell peppers to the vegetable mix. Also, I added some tumeric to the rice to give it a nice golden color.

This was fantastic. Made it for a dinner party, and was able to do all of the chopping ahead of time so I didn't need to spend the entire time in the kitchen. I did substitute chicken for one of the guests who doesn't eat fish, and he seemed to like it as much as the salmon-eaters. It was delicious, and really pretty. I had serious difficulty trying not to rave about my own cooking! (Trust me, it was the recipe, not me.)

I agree with the previous reviewers -- this dish is really, really good. The flavors and textures are sublime. For the record, we made it just about exactly as written, except for 1 Tb tomato paste instead of 3 Tb tomato puree; and also we doubled the slaw. Truly a wonderful recipe.

Fantastic dish - give it five forks - however we made a few changes: cooked the rice the regular way on the stove top; neither of us likes cabbage so we subsituted fresh baby spinach; and fresh corriander was no where to be found so fresh basil was a great substitute and probably more preferable. The next day we used the left over sauce with chicken. Definately a make again - in fact we've made it for friends and they think we are gourmet chefs.

I loved this sauce. I didn't have the red Thai curry paste, so I took curry powder and added enough water to make the paste. It worked just fine. I used the leftover sauce as salad dressing and also mixed in rice. I really liked it.

This is tasty and easy to prepare. I omitted the rice because I wasn't in the mood, but the vegetables were plenty. I used white shredded cabbage but next time I think I would use red -nice colors. I cut way down on the brown sugar - used about a teaspoon - but I used the whole can of lite coconut milk so that rounded out the flavor. And of course, because I have a steel palate, I upped the red curry paste.

My husband, who is very picky when it comes to fish, loved this. The sauce is excellent, just the right amount of spices, and is wonderful left over. If you have left-over salmon, however, don't microwave it to reheat it. Steam it. It's as good as the first night.

I consider this one of the best dishes I've ever made. My guests raved and thought not only did it taste divine, but the color and texture combinations (pink fish, white rice, red sauce, cool green crispy salad on top) made it look like restaurant fare. Have also made it with Taste of Thai coconut ginger rice quite successfully. A sweet gewurtztraminer compliments the spice wonderfully.

A great recipe. The heat was just right. The prep was easy. I made up the sauce first, chopped the veggies, fired up the grill, made the rice, put the salmon on and did a quick reheat on thw sauce over high heat, whisking constantly. The rice and salmon finished up at the same time and YEE HAW! Had it with a bottle of Martin-Ray Chard. Next time I'll have nan(?) bread and chutney on the side. Make sure you use Taste Of India coconut milk. I made this a second time with Thai Kitchen coconut milk and it WAS NOT the same!

My husband and I are big fans of both salmon and Thai cuisine, so this was a favorite. The spiciness is determined by the amount of curry--I added extra and it was a little too hot. We served it over orzo rice. I recommend grilling extra salmon, because this tastes great for lunch the next day.

Ok, I really thought this was not going to be any good despite previous reviews. I bunged up the recipe by using tomato paste instead of puree (what is tomato puree anyway?)

We're on our second go 'round for this one. Used carrots, red and yellow peppers and zucchini - all julienned - for the vegetables the first time and loved it. My husband thought it was worthy of a meal in a restaurant. Definitely a keeper! Be sure to use the freshest salmon you can find and the fact that it is unseasoned will only enhance the dish!

Rating: 2
I'm clearly in the minority, but for someone who loves Thai food, I was seriously underwhelmed by this recipe. The sauce is pretty good, but it loses its punch by the unseasoned salmon and the strong taste of cabbage. I'd marinate the salmon in lime juice with onions, include other veggies and add cilantro.

Rating: 2
I thought the sauce was good but not outstanding. My problem is that I have a Thai restaurant 5 minutes from my house that is beyond compare! Any other Thai recipes seem mediocre in comparison. Next time, I would cut down on the regular curry powder, I found it overpowering. I also used LITE coconut milk and it seemed to do the trick just fine. I will probably try this recipe again at some point but there are other Thai recipes on this site that I'll experiment with first. Sorry everyone - you all seemed to love this dish!!!!

Great dish, wonderful, but do be careful about spicing it up too much. I doubled the red curry paste and it was a bit too hot for my wife. I also added other vegetables for the stir-frying, large diced red bell pepper and sliced carrots. They added a lot of color and helped reduce the temperature of the dish. The colors were great and the dish was most beautiful to look at.

Wonderful! I have made this with salmon and halibut and look forward to making it with shrimp.

Delicious and beautiful presentation. For the vegetables, I used the prepackaged "slaw" and lots of cilantro. Couldn't find mint and don't like cucumbers. Used a high-quality balsamic in lieu of rice vinegar. Fantastic. Also, made the Coconut Rice recipe found on Epicurious instead of the plain basmati. All that to say, this recipe is quite versatile.

Rating: 2
Our guests loved it, but I was underwhelmed. Each component could be a bit sharper. The sauce needed reducing, and the vegetables could be a bit more complex. I'd find an Asian slaw with a little more oomph, and substitute that for the cabbage/cucumber combination.

Rating: 4
This recipe gracefully blends the clean fresh flavor of salmon with the asian accent of curry and coconut milk. At first glance, this recipe appears to consist of too many ingredients that would potentially compete for taste; however, the addition of herbs such as mint and coriander really make it complete. The savory sauce is excellent alone with the rice.
