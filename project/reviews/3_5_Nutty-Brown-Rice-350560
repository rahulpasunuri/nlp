I've made this numerous times, and always to rave reviews. Never the same twice, as I use different nuts (one or more varieties) depending on what I have. The only change I absolutely and always have to make is to double the salt when cooking the rice.

Lightened up on the nutmeg a bit, but otherwise made as written. Delicious. My family, including kiddos, loved it -- especially liked mixing in some raisins.

Delicious! Added walnuts, pignolias, peas and raisins. Great texture and yummy.

I baked the rice per the directions of another rater and was very pleased with results. Rice was perfect consistency. My 10 year old who HATES any kind of rice devoured this. We had peas as part of the meal and he mixed them into his rice stating that the recipe should have peas in it! My husband says he's adding some brown sugar and cream to the leftovers for breakfast, so I guess this is a keeper!

I used only walnuts. This was delicious, but heavily dependent on making good rice, so if it's starchy or gloppy, prepare a new batch.

Very good. I used a bit less nutmeg, and it turned out very well. The mixed nuts were great with the rice. A keeper!

This recipe is okay. The nutmeg was a little too strong for my taste and really made this dish incompatible with my other dishes of the night. My boyfriend liked it though, so maybe you will.

I just made this recipe for our annual desert Thanksgiving camp-out. I did alter it though as follows. I always bake my brown rice because it consistently comes out perfectly: 2.25c brown rice in a glass casserole dish. Add 1 TBSP oil and 3/4 tsp salt to 3.5 c boiling water and pour immediately over rice and cover tightly with foil. Bake at 375 for 1 hour and fluff. I precooked rice at home and then warmed it in the sauteed pan after I toasted the almonds, pistashio and pecans. Delicious! Several requests for the recipe.

I would not usually rate a rice recipe like this with a four fork, but I have never been able to produce a brown rice recipe that I considered worth eating. I have tried everything for soaking the rice, covering the rice and on and on and on. This recipe nailed it. Not covering the simmering rice was the answer and the taste of this recipe with crunchy browned nuts in butter and the nutmeg was excellant. I used almonds and walnuts. My wife did state she thought she would prefer potatoes. Oh well, at least one of us was pretty geeked over the rice. I strongly suggest others try this and don't invite my wife.

White rice snobs might want to give this a try. I know brown rice is healthier, but I just don't like it! I followed it exactly and it was finished in about 30 mins. I mixed walnuts, almonds, macadamia, pecans. It's not white jasmine but its good.

I don't know if I did something wrong but, we did not like this at all. I'm going to try to add some herbs and more broth to the leftovers and see if it gives it a better taste.

I liked the rice, although I put less nuts in the next time, and took considerable care not to overcook them. Goes great with the Gorgonzola Chicken

Very good. Of course I changed the recipe a bit but will make it again.

Incredibly easy and phenomenally good at the same time. My whole family including my two five year olds loved this dish.

Incredible, I could eat this stuff for breakfast it that good! So good I am making it for Thanksgiving. I did substitute chicken broth for water but followed the rest of the recipe exactly. For products I used Planters Pecan Lovers Mix (pecans, cashews and pistachios) and Lundberg Wild Blend.

Certainly not low-call, but absolutely delicious. I had a mix of nuts, so for a change was able to follow recipe exactly.

This was really delicious. Made it with slivered almonds; the brown butter really makes the dish. It makes four very big servings - could easily serve six.
