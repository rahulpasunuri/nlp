There are so many wonderful chocolate cake recipes; unfortunately, this is not one of them. I anticipated the problem of leakage when the recipe called for flipping the bottom of the pan. I had placed a cookie sheet on the rack below to catch the leakage. Worse than that, the cake was seriously over cooked and very dry and crumbly, certainly not dense as I expected. My guess is that an hour of baking time would be more than enough. Overall, this was a waste of time and fine ingredients. Move on to something better.

I think this cake would be yummy but somebody needs to figure out how long to cook it. I cooked it for 55 minutes and it was overcooked and not edible unless you like eating chocolate crumbs. Flavor good...baking time needs to be corrected. Don't think I'll chance making it again. Hate to waste the ingredients.

I love this cake, I make it for birthdays all the time, but I only bake it for 55min. It turns out super moist and fudgy. Sometimes I pour the ganache on right when the cake comes out of the oven, so it seeps through and makes it even fudgier.

Best fudge cake we and our guests ever tasted! Forgot to include the butter, pulled cake from oven 15 minutes in, remixed with melted butter, et voila, an incredibly moist and delectable cake.

I liked the recipe took it out 15 minutes early as it was done. I also cut down on the amount of sugar then after baking added a simple syrup made the cake german torte dense and and nice and moist albeit a bit sweet for some.

I baked the cake for only 70 minutes, and yet it's texture was dry and crumbly and its taste lackluster. It was a waste of time and ingredients.

I overcooked the cake- and took it out after 1 hour 10 minutes- so earlier than directed. The cake was dry and not very flavorful. I had made it according to the original recipe.

This is a very easy recipe. I've made it twice. I melt the chocolate and butter in the microwave to save time, and the second time around I used all unsweetened chocolate instead of bittersweet, as the cake seemed a little too sweet to me. Also, I think a tart fruit sauce (I made a sauce from raspberries, brandy, and a little sugar) is better than the chocolate sauce. I calculated 16 servings at 285 calories per serving.

I didn't have unsweetened chocolate so I used semi-sweet chips and it was the perfect mixture of flavors. It was just, as the recipe states, dense. Seeing the previous review I used a chocolate cream cheese frosting instead. Delicious! Enjoy!

This was good. I've had better chocolate cakes, but really, who am I to argue with chocolate cake? It does take quite a while to make. The glaze ended up being sort of a magic shell on the cake and was nearly impenetrable. But again, it's chocolate cake, so who cares. I don't recommend storing in the fridge (we have to, as we have a cat who can open cupboards and will eat anything he finds, including whole cakes), as it makes it sort of hard. But, the chocolate flavor is really quite good, and the overall effect is that it is delicious. I recommend eating it for breakfast while saying, "I shouldn't really be eating this for breakfast."
