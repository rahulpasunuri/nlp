this recipe makes lovely biscuits, golden and fluffy and moist. my only problem is the flavor. it's lacking and most certainly due to the use of shortening instead of butter. i will have to try again replacing some or all of the shortening with butter and see if that does the trick. will definitely make again.

I have never been so infatuated with a baking podwer biscuit in my life. Used soy milk instead of real milk and baked them for 13 mins, ridiculously easy to make I was done in under 20 minutes. Even more delicious with butter.

Delicious & simple -- although the first time I tried it, I copied the recipe wrong and used baking SODA! Had to throw out the whole bunch. Is this why someone said they "puked" from the recipe -- did you use soda instead of powder?? Second time around they were perfect, flaky & tender. You can't mess this up unless... well... unless you mess it up.

What I think is hilarious is that people blame the recipe if they cannot cook! I especially like the one saying they threw up from the biscuits... and if your buscuits are like stones, try baking them for a shorter time or getting some fresh baking power!

I made the buttermilk version last night and they turned out perfectly! Fluffy and buttery, with a nicely browned crust. Probably the best biscuits recipe I've made from this website.

I have to laugh at some of these reviews; I am about to make these biscuits, despite all of the reviews posted. Most of the people changed the original recipe. Why do people review a recipe that they have changed completely. I think that they should just post their own recipe on kitchenlink and only review the recipe as made:)

I had a last minute craving for biscuits for dinner with a chicken/veggie type stew. These were easy and quite good. I used butter and halved the recipe. Just as the recipe says, they are lightly crusty outside and fine textured inside ---mmmmm. I'd rate them between 3 and 4 forks easily.

I used butter instead of shortening and this worked great. Biscuits were golden brown and tasty. But I found that about 12 minutes was plenty of baking time.

I thought these biscuits were easy to make and they tasted very good. My family really enjoyed them.

Great Recipe to cut in half. Much more fun than making biscuits from a package.

Not big and fluffy. If I wanted a scone I would have made a scone. Disappointed to say the least.

Very tasty biscuit. Light and delicate on the inside with a hint of sweetness. Not like my Granny makes, but very easy and simple to prepare. Will make again many times.

I made the buttermilk version. Though they were tasty and my family basically enjoyed them, I was a bit disappointed. Instead of being big and fluffy they were pretty thin. I was expecting the ones my grandmother used to make : ).

I substituted soy milk for the milk, and 1/2 cup of the flour with corn meal and a little corn flour. They were so light and crispy! I cut mine into squares, it's easier that way. Also, a tip: spray a little cooking oil on your hands before kneading the dough--it won't stick.

I enjoyed these biscuits, and so did my very Californian partner. I used just a pinch of sugar, and half the salt. I heated up a cast iron skillet with shortening in it while making biscuit dough, then when biscuits were cut out, I dipped both sides in melted shortening then cooked the biscuits in the warmed cast iron skillet. Very close in taste to my grandmother's old fashioned Texas-style biscuits. Can't wait to try these with fried chicken, greens, and gravy!

The buscuits were great and the recipe very easy.

Maybe my opinion's been tainted with my mother's homestyle baking, but these biscuits were just "alright" ~ the rest of my family did not care for it. I wouldn't mind having it again, although, I'd rather go through the effort in making our traditional home recipe.

I wanted to make biscuits but didn't have buttermilk or cream in the house. These were perfect. They were crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. I would definitely make these again and might even prefer these to angel-type biscuits, just because they are less fattening and so easy to make (with all the ingredients usually on hand).

At the last minute tonight, I realized I had forgotten to purchase French bread. We live out in the country--a fair shagg into town. These biscuits bailed me out. They are easy and fast. I had to use half and half which didn't seem to impair the flavor.

Made these for brunch on Sunday with sausage & gravy. Doubled recipe and didn't have shortening, so I improvised and used all butter. Not quite as light as when I use shortening but very yummy! One of my guests commented "I think these are the best bicuits I've ever eaten!" Even doubling the recipe, they completely disappeared.

Substitute buttermilk in this recipe and you have wonderful southern style biscuits. And if you are lucky enough to have access to southern wheat flour like White Lily, that's even better.

I have had no luck making biscuits, but I keep trying, and this one worked! I did exactly as instructed, but having no cookie cutter, I used a jar top and got smaller biscuits -- the recipe made about 20 little, tender, delicious biscuits. I'd like them bigger next time, but I loved this recipe. Very crispy crust and soft middles, and a flavor!!

I tried the drop biscuit version and used butter flavored shortening and 1.5% milk. They were great! My husband and kids have very little experience with biscuits and they loved them. I would like to try them with butter instead of shortening. This was my first try at making biscuits.

These are by far the BEST biscuits I've ever made. I made the drop biscuit recipe but dropped them into a muffin tin. I used 1% milk and butter flavor Crisco only because this is what I had. The biscuits are MOIST and SO TENDER. I'll definitely make these again.

I used the drop biscuit recipe, substituting butter for shortening, and dropped them into mini-muffin tins. They were so cute-- perfect for parties-- and not to mention delicious.

These Biscuits RULE!!

Nice height, light, and does make 16 biscuits if 2 inch cutter is used. But, taste was a bit grainy. Measure 2 cups of flour exactly, I measured 2 cups but biscuits still tasted like they hard too much flour in it. I little salty, too. I used 1% milk during this attempt. I might try to use the buttermilk version of this recipe next time.

Very simple to make. I use margarine instead of shortening and the result is wonderful.
