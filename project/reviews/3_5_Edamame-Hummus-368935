WOW this recipe makes WAYYY more than 6 cups! You are grinding up 4 bags of frozen veggies! I did not like this recipe. Besides having to add more spices b/c it was very bland... the amount it makes was just way to much for my liking! I also had a tough time getting the hummus totally blended, so it was more like edamame mince than hummus.

I'm not giving this a fork rating because I really changed it up. I had the ingredients so I was committed but after reading the reviews and in the process of making this recipe I decided it needed help. I made the basic recipe w/o oil, garlic and mint + I doubled the coriander, cumin and added more lemon juice. I divided the results and added nonfat sour cream, salsa and red pepper flakes to half and it was a big hit on Easter. To the other half I added 4 small minced garlic cloves, 1 1/2 ounces EVOO. The garlic really helped but this version was less of a hit. No mint, that sounded disgusting.

So so recipe - makes a tremendous amount and is a bit bland. I added more oil, lemon, cilantro and cumin but still was disappointed. My guests seemed to like it but I would rather use edamame in other recipes...Maybe cut out the peas?

This version of hummus is to die for. I was making it for a dinner and had to try really hard to not eat half of it. I ate enough for it to be my dinner :) I highly recommend it.

It was zoo good! Even my football obsessed boyfriend ate some while some nice blue corn chips.

As I was making this one I was sure it was going to fall into the 2 fork range, but it was a big hit at our Christmas Eve appetizer buffet. I did bump up the level of coriander and cumin and gently heated the garlic in the olive oil (a technique I use for traditional hummus to take the sharp edge off the garlic). Started with a reduced amount of oil but probably got back to the full amount when tasting during prep. Definitely chill for at least several hours to allow the flavors to blend. Will be making this one again-perhaps with some of the suggestions from NorthwestApicius!

A good chef always tastes and celebrates flavor by adding a personal touch. I made this and added more lemon, less oil and a scant of red pepper flakes as well as more cilantro. I turned it into a tapenade, adding some Sicilian olives. The recipe is a great foundation to start new taste.

I would try this again, with some modifications. I would cut the oil down to 1/2 cup at most, and add the zest of at least a half lemon. I brought it to a party and people were intrigued. Nobody loved or hated it. It just needed a little more pizzazz, which maybe the lemon would give.

Tasteless mush. Like babyhood. So so so sorry we wasted time and money making this. It's by far the worst recipe we've ever made from Bon Appetit :(
