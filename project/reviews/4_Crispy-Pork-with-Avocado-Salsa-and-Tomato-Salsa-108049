This is my go to recipe for carnitas ever since I received this issue of Bon App back in 2003. (This whole issue is my fave for Mexican dishes). My hispanic mother-in-law asked me for the recipe and it became her go-to version! This works as well with pork butt or shoulder, cut into large chunks. I don't use the orange peel as it was a little too much orange for my taste, but the juice is a requirement as it adds not only flavor plus helps to tenderize the meat. Don't be afraid (as I was initially) to boil the heck out of it when time to reduce the liquid; the meat gets a little crust on it and the 'bits' at the bottom are delicious.

This recipe is so seriously delicious that it just can't be believed. Way better than any carnitas we ever have out. Don't worry if the smells from the pot aren't alluring in the first hour - it just gets better and better with time. We generally use pork shoulder instead of the country ribs, and they just end up super succulent. This is a dish I'll make again and again. Virtual perfection.

This is one of the best dishes I have ever cooked, granted I'm a novice chef but it was delicious none-the-less. The orange flavor comes through like a sublte sweet odorless parfum. It is fantastic and I even had to forgo the brandy as it had gone missing...oh husband...

I only made the pork, which was very good. Too much orange juice. If I made it again, I would make it with less OJ and might rate it a 4.

Such a simple thing, you could keep the recipe in your head. This dish can be made quicker too. Just cut the meat smaller to reduce the time, still turns out great! I use the huge pork loins from Sam's Club. haven't tried the ribs but there's an inexpensive meat for ya.

Wonderful!! It's very easy to make, and the taste is delicious. I wanted to make it a little more low calorie, so I used a pork tip roast instead of country style pork ribs. It reduced the calories tremendously and it was still delicious.

I don't know what I did wrong, but the pork never got crispy. The flavor was good, though and my family liked it. I'll try it again and see if it comes out the way it's supposed to.

This has become a favorite. I've improvised slightly using boneless pork butt instead of the ribs and I always broil the shredded meat which gives it the real crispy/soft texture that I love about carnitas. I don't bother with the salsas. I serve it very simply with chopped fresh cilantro, sliced lime and avocado with corn tortillas on the side.

Have made this so many times now - very good! We also mix the leftovers with bbq sauce the next day.

Great recipe and although time consuming with the salsas, Classic Red Rice, and refried beans - it IS worth it! I made the recommended Tomato, Onion and Serrano Chile Salsa as well as the Avocado Salsa. I bought a can of fat free refried beans and made the rice - Wonderful dinner! I combined the 2 salsas to have as a dip the next night with tortilla chips and the combo was really really good.

My wife and I love this dish. I use Cognac instead of brandy and usually add fresh onion at the beginning and then I grill some jalepeno or serano peppers and add them when there is about 30 minutes to go. I serve with chopped cilantro and onion.

I have been making this dish since the May 2003 edition it came out in. I love it. I do alter it of course and add some onions to the potand maybe a dried chile or a bay leaf. I have never had success in the tearing of the strips and then returning it to the skillet with water to reheat - they are not crispy then. I take the batch of carnitas and spread them on a cookie sheet and broil them to crisp them up and reheat - works perfectly. I have even made these with grapefruit juice when I was out of oranges. When the meat is crispy and moist, these tacos are the best thing around!

This is really good, I used bone in ribs as that was what my store had, however I must have simmered mine too long as the meat literally fell apart during the "boil until liquid evaporates and meat browns and begins to get crisp, stirring often". I did have to stir often, and ended up with shredded meat in the skillet. Some of which was crispy. Still worked out, but kind of messy. Did taste great however and yielded tons of meat. Will definitely make this again and watch the amount of time I simmer more closely.

Rating: 4
This is wonderful! I've made it with boneless and bone- in ribs with same results. Just remove bone when you shred the meat - cheaper cut with lower cost but just as good. Orange makes a sweeter meat but carmelizes nicely and tastes great! We eat the avocado-tomatillo salsa by itself too. This is a terrific recipe that's easy, inexpensive and memorable. I made it for visiting relatives and they were so impressed. We love it!

Rating: 4
My family and I loved this recipe. I agree with all of the people who said that it takes a while, but the effort involved is minimal. I shredded the pork and served it with tortillas and various toppings, but I actually liked the pork better before it was shredded. Net time, I may leave it whole and serve it with tortilas and stuff, but I may just serve it with rice. I might also cut down on the amount of orange zest, because I thought that it was very orange-y, although nobody complained. Also, if you make the avocado salsa, keep in mind that 3 avocados makes A LOT of salsa/guacamole. Salsa fresca is also delicious with this pork. I will definitely make this again.

Two words...De Licous! Have been looking for carnitas recipe forever and now my search is over! Followed recipe exactly except used stock instead of water and pork shoulder (all my store had on hand). I didn't do the salsa's as I prefer my own but the carnitas was wonderful...and coming from someone that lives in SoCal that should say something!

Rating: 4
This recipe doesn't look like much, but we were totally surprised at the great results. We used chicken stock instead of water, and at the end, you do have to do a bit of work to shred the meat. It is also quite difficult to actually get the meat with any caramelization the first day without leaving your pots a sticky mess. I imagine it is better if you refry the meat the second day, but with no leftovers, we couldn't find out! Will make again and again.

I loved the texture of the meat, but it was bland - no flavor at all. After it was cooked I tried adding ground cumin and Mexican seasoning, which helped a bit, but not enough. Next time I will add more garlic, more citrus, and test the additions other reviewers have used and shared.

Winner! This was perfect--exactly the flavors and textures i was looking for. I used pork shoulder instead of the ribs, but otherwise followed along. I can imagine how some might not achieve the crispy texture, because its one of those things where you have to ride the line--seems like it might burn, but it probably won't. You might need some brillo afterwards, but its totally worth it.

I've made this according to recipe which worked great and also mixing cooking instructions from others. I slow cooked 9 lbs. bone-in pork blade sliced in large pieces with 1 1/2 cups oj and 1/2 cup water, the garlic, oj peel, salt, a little cumin, oregano and a few bay leaves on high for 5 hours. Then, I removed the pork pieces from the liquid and put it in a roasting pan and covered it with the 1/3 cup brandy and roasted it at 375 for around 40 minutes. This was an easy delicious method. Thank you other reviewers.

This is so good, I just finished cooking it, I haven't even served it yet, and I felt the need to review it. It is SO GOOD! I cooked it exactly as stated, no variations. It's like magic, all this stuff goes into a pot and comes out as something so much more than the sum of it's parts! Make it, you will love it, especially if you love carnitas. I made the tomato salsa and it's very good but very spicy w/2 serrano chiles.

For crock pot cooking, use 1/2 c water instead of 2 c. Cook on high for 4 hours for 5 lbs of bone-in country ribs. I strain the resulting broth and cook down on the stove top. Remove bones and fat from meat. To crisp up if desired, put in the broiler. One can just serve in the crock pot and forget the straining, deboning, cooking down the sauce and crisping if you use cut up pork shoulder or picnic cuts. Good when you want to have food available with little additional intervention after cooking.

I replaced some water with chicken stock, used 1/2 the recipe and still had tons of left overs, added a touch of cumin to the broth when cooking. After shredding, I popped the meat (single layer, bar stone) into the oven 425, 20 minutes and it was perfect! I had a hard time finding boneless ribs (for some reason) so I used the bone-in which didn't seem to impact the flavor, but a little more work since I had to pull bones out and still managed to miss one or two. Tip: Freeze any left overs and add to your baked beans!

I used regular free range chicken broth instead of water, and it made the carnitas a tiny bit salty for my taste, but they were still delicious! Next time I'll use water or salt- free broth. I served them with a homemade salsa, homemade pinto beans cooked in my pressure cooker, fresh avocado and corn tortillas. Yum!

After 5 years in ND, my husband & I were really yearning for the little carnitas tacos we used to buy in Long Beach,CA at a Mexican bakery/taqueria. I've tried other carnitas recipes, but had less than rewarding results until I tried this one. The meat was tender and oh so flavorful. I very lightly browned the corn tortillas on an well oiled griddle and I mixed the carnitas with minced onion and cilantro, with a splash of lime juice on top. Whew! Great flavor and texture ...

YUMO! I have tried making carnitas the traditional way and they always came out dry despite everything I tried. Not only are these much less messy, but oh so tender and flavorful. I also used chicken broth, but instead of finishing on the stovetop, put them in a 350 degree oven until they crisped up, about 15-20 min. Can't wait to make this for company!

Loved it! This was a much healthier version of the traditional carnitas cooked with lard...and tasty, too! i used chicken broth instead of water to heighten flavor a little, and easily made this for two using only 1.5 lbs of country-style ribs, 1/2 cup of orange juice, 3 garlic cloves, salt and pepper to taste, and enough broth to reach a little below half-way up the pork chunks. Because of these modifications, it took less time to cook and brown, of course. YUM!

Great recipe! The key to this recipe is the pan. Since I do not have a 12-inch pan, the second time I made it I split the meat between two pans (I had extra meat) then added the orange juice before adding the water to the 'partially submerge' level. (Reading on into the recipe, it speaks of having the meat 'partially submerged'.) Whatever size pan or quantity of pork, follow this guideline. Also the reviewer who spoke of 'sea' salt vs. regular salt is correct. I used only 1/2 t. of regular salt.

I have made this twice and it is always a hit. The meat has such a nice flavor. Both times it has taken longer than 10 minutes for liquid to reduce and longer than 15 minutes for the meat to crisp.

Proof that simple food is good food. I added the cumin as previously suggested but forgot the orange peel. I left a few teaspoons of the reduced sauce in the pot (the brandy is a must), shredded the pork, mushed up the softened garlic and mixed it all together in the pot. Delish! I did squirt a little lime juice over as well. Next time will add a little heat but then we like it hot.

Rating: 4
Awesome and easy pork carnitas! I used the full amount of fine sea salt that the recipe calls for. I am guessing that other reviewers that commented on the salt used regular table salt which would make this dish too salty. I served with purchased fresh salsa, S&W Santa Fe Beans and made the red rice too.

Rating: 3
Great recipe, even with the revisions I had to make, substituting grapefruit juice for orange and whisky for the brandy and it still came out great! Followed other suggestions and halved the salt - still plenty salty. Will add a teaspoon of cumin next time. Made this in my cast-iron skillet and finished the dish in a hot oven - nothing stuck and the top pieces were crispy.

Rating: 3
The only thing wrong with this authentically flavored and delicious dish is that it calls for way too much salt. After making it once, I reduced the amount by more than half in subsequent attempts and find it much improved. The reduction intensifies the flavor, especially the saltiness. I've never had a problem with the meat crisping although I've made it both in regular and non-stick pans. I think the brandy is essential in achieving this result.

Rating: 4
This always gets rave reviews when I make it for family and friends. I use pork shoulder because it's easier to find. I've left it to simmer while I played 9 holes of golf and it was so tender that I didn't have to shred it at all. I usually serve with soft tortillas, sauteed onions & peppers, guacamole, salsa, sour cream and shredded cheese. Pour left overs over corn chips for great nachos!

This was SOOO good! I am in Italy right now and I love Italian food, but I miss mexican food. That aside, this recipe was excellent, with a few small changes. First, I used a pork shank split in half and meaty pork ribs with the bones, which really enhanced the flavor, especially with the marrow. Do NOT use lean meat for this dish and be sure to add the reserved fat, otherwise it won't become crispy! Secondly, i added a bay leaf and peppercorns to the broth, as per the suggestions of other contributers. Lastly, i made it the day before, deboned the meat, and then the next day, fried the shredded chunks in a nonstick skillet with some of the left-over pork fat and no water, which also made the meat nicely crispy.

Tasty & easy; worth 2.5 forks. Used bone-in country ribs & worked fine. But the boil down time took much longer, and crispyness happened, but it was glued to the bottom of my Le Crueset pan. Will try w/non-stick next time, or broil or convect-roast for a short time to achieve crispyness without the terrible mess (or maybe try braising as another has done). Yummy w/lo-carb tortillas & spicy guac.

I combined this recipe with my usual method of making carnitas and it turned out great. Started with a 4# bone-in boston butt roast. Sub'd a chicken/beef broth in place of water. Added 1 quartered onion, 3 bay leaves, 2t. each of crushed oregano, cumin, and whole peppercorns. Simmered until tender then transferred to roasting pan and roasted for 30 minutes @ 350 until browned. Let rest, then shredded. Muy delicioso!

We LOVE this recipe. I have made it a number of times, twice for my bunco group and each time it is a hit! I do notice that it takes more then 15 minutes to evaporate the liquid, but either I just cook longer or remove some of the liquid. This recipe is easy to double, and it is the best left over. We serve it with Mexican Black Beans and Red Rice.

I used a pork butt and cut it into 1-2in cubes, trimming off the big chunks of fat and keeping them as large as possible. I wanted a chunkier sort of structure instead of completely pulled. It took two skillets, not one, and when it was almost done I put them under broiler and got a good crispy browning on the top - so I ended up with larger chunks of browned area, too. I added a little extra brandy at the end and flamed it off, but I wouldn't do that again - the amount in the recipe would have been enough. And I added more salt. We had this, chicken Chile Verde, and bbq london broil sliced very thin as taco fillers. The pork was a huge hit.

This was a fabulous recipe. Like nothing I've ever made before. Everyone loved it. Can't wait to make it for company. I made it in a stainless steel pan and deglazed the pan with a little more brandy. Just to get all the bits that stuck to the pan. The meat was so tasty we ate it plain on the first night. Second night we followed the rest of the recipe. Excellent as an advance prep or to take to a pot luck.

This was wonderful! We made it the day before serving and then reheated it as the recipe instructed, although we needed a little more water during the reheat process than suggested. We used Kjalii Foods Inc's Native Fire Roasted Green salsa which has the same ingredients as the avocado salsa recommended here. We also used tomato salsa, but the avocado salsa was the definite winner for flavor with the pork. (If you're on the west coat and can get Kjali salsa, at specialty markets, it saves the work of making your own.) The four of us who enjoyed this all agree that this recipe is a definite keeper!

The flavors in this receipe combine delightfully. Aside from the fact that "fried in pork lard" doesn't make me drool, my already lean pork ribs had been sitting in Southwestern seasonings overnight when I found this receipe. So I decided to prepare it backwards - as a braise, and it was fabulous!! I browned the ribs in olive oil, used the brandy to de-glaze the pan and soften the garlic, returned the ribs to the pan with the oj and water and finished them in the oven. I did save back a couple of ribs and crisped the strips in bacon fat, but the braised version was better, in my opinion, and a bigger hit. The braised meat is even better the next day, but don't count on many leftovers. This has earned a permanent spot in my make ahead for guests file. Round out the menu with pinto or black beans - and what ever you do, don't leave out the avacado salsa - it's a must with the pork!

This has become a regular for us because we love it so much. More flavorful than anything else we get at restaurants. I think one key to getting the meat crispy is to have pork with enough fat on it. You really need it at the end when the liquid has boiled away to get a good fry in the regular metal pan that we use. We've also tried it with pineapple juice and lime rind with great results. We also use crushed garlic which really adds to the flavorfulness.

We really liked these. I have to say, I was not overly optomistic about these while they were in the simmering phase; boiled pork looks pretty revolting. And mine never got what I would call "crispy" but they did end up browning at the end of the cook time. I didn't have to tear it into strips because it was pretty much just falling apart when I stirred it around. The avocado salsa is excellent, even though I couldn't find fresh tomatillos and had to use canned. Also I made it in my mini-prep which completely pulverized it, but it still tasted awesome! Would definitely make these again. Served them with black beans and red rice. Good enough for company.
