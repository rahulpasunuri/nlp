Wow! In the words of one of our dinner guests: "scrumptious"! I will definitely be adding this to our dinner rotation. I used spinach in place of the pea tendrils but did everything else as noted. The mint is key. Even if you're not a mint fan, trust me, the mint is delicious in this recipe. The next time I make this recipe I may use only half of the bacon grease and incorporate some olive oil instead. As is, the recipe is delicious though (although not as healthy as you may want on aregular basis).

Great spring dinner. Trader Joes is now carrying pea tendrils (at least on the East Coast) which made putting this together a lot easier than the last time I tried. I agree that it doesn't need as much cheese as the recipe states - I just sprinkle it on to taste.

I also had all the ingredients on hand (what are the chances!?) including fresh peas, but had already used the pea tendrils before I found the recipe, so I made it without them. It was still delicious. I can see how pancetta would be a good sub for the bacon and rotini might hold the ingredients better than orecchiette, but it's a great use of fresh spring vegetables.

We made this because we happened to have all of the ingredients on hand (?!) and it seemed like a perfect late spring spring sort of meal. I'm a mint-hater, so we used basil instead, and it was lovely!

Easy to put together, the pea tendrils, sugar snap peas and bacon really make this dish - I love the flavor from the slight hint of mint.

This is an easy and delicious weeknight meal and perfect for spring. My husband loved it. I will keep this one on file.

Very good. Light. Made with turkey bacon. Great for a light summer dinner.

I see I am alone in my opinion, but I thought this was only okay. I followed the recipe exactly, save for pouring out some of the bacon fat (there was way too much!) The flavors were nice, but anything tastes good with that much bacon and cheese. The mint added a nice touch. My main issue was with the sugar snap peas-- definitely chop them, at least in half. As is, they are way too big for the dish. I found myself eating around them. All in all, a passable pasta dish--but certainly nothing amazing.

Next time I'd drain off some of the fat from the pancetta. Other than that I'd follow the recipe again, other than the cheese. I didn't need all that cheese, particularly as cheese & grater were passed, so I just tossed in about 1/2 c finely grated parm rather than the cup of shaved called for. If I didn't have pea shoots perhaps I'd use watercress, but I'd prefer to wait until pea shoots are in season. If you live in NYC and can't find pea shoots at your greenmarket, try Chinatown, even out of season. I love all three incarnations of pea, so to have them all in one dish--with pasta and bacon and mint--is delightful. What a great recipe.

Yum. Used spinach instead of pea tendrils, and rotini instead of the orecchiette, and discovered when it was time to add the frozen peas that I was out - so it was pasta with one pea! But delicious.

A rare 4 forks!! Fabulous! It was much more delicious than I'd anticipated - I can't wait to make it again! We used pancetta (Italian bacon), and spinach in place of the pea tendrils. I'm so glad I made enough for leftovers.

delicious even without the bacon, perfect springtime flavor

This was great - my market was out of watercress and I couldn't find pea tendrils; Italian parsley was a fine substitute. A very surprising - and yummy - dish!

The mint makes this dish, although my husband didn't care for the flavor. I used baby spinach. My only comment was that it seemed there was too much bacon fat left in the pan. I think I should have dumped some of it.

Don't fear the mint! This dish is so incredibly delicious. At first I skimped on the mint, fearing it would give it an odd flavor, but then I ended up adding the rest because it added so much depth to the dish. Very tasty, very different; I highly recommend it.

No pea tendrils here, either, but the watercress works fine. I hesitate to speak for others, but seeing "12 ounces of [insert name of pasta]" makes me peevish, and I suspect I am not alone. What do I need with 4 oz. of little ears and their relatives cluttering up the cupboard? So, used the whole pound and adjusted other ingredients (some according to their packaging), also. Bitching over, I loved it! The mint doesn't make a minty dish, but sort of "brightens" the other flavors.

Delicious! And I used watercress in place of pea tendrils. Even Fresh Direct doesn't sell the stuff.
