hmmm, a lovely change of pace from plain old watermelon - definitely makes it much more sophisticated. Am planning to serve it at our next family reunion.

I made this only because I was looking for something different to do with watermelon. I found it surprisingly nice; an earthy, sophisticated yet subtle twist. However, I probably wouldn't make it again, but my husband liked it enough that he said HE would.

We almost skipped this dessert (I don't like fennel much) but I'm glad we did it. Very simple, very fresh, and it will leave you wanting to eat the whole watermelon.
