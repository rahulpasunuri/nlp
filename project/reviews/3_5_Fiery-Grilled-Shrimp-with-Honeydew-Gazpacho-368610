I halved the salt and the sugar, but the peppers were too much. In the end, didn't care for the gazpacho but it made a great margarita ingredient!

This was very good, but much too sweet with the addition of sugar. Next time I will skip the sugar. The amount of salt could also be lessened this way as well.

Fresh tasting, great complement to spicy shrimp, but it calls for way too much salt, I think it should have read 1 tsp not tablespoon? Enjoy!
