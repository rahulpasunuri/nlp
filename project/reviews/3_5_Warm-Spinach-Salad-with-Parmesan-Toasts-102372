I made this exactly as written for a dinner party last night. Everyone thought the salad and toasts were wonderful. Loved the dressing (good balsamic is a must!) I loved the fact that it is simple and easy to make and a nice change from a standard salad.

Delish!!! Such a nice and simply salad. I made the parm toasts and they were a lovely addition. I gave everyone 3 on their salads. The radicchio was such a pretty addition and not bitter at all.

My husband and I and our company loved this spinach salad! It is delicious as is but sometimes to make it extra special I toss in fresh sliced stawberries at the very end and add crumbled bacon and crumbled goat cheese. Also, you're not getting all the fat as in recipes where you cook everything in the bacon fat. I cook my bacon in the microwave and drain on paper towels before crumbling and adding to the salad

as salads go, this was a super-winner! I usually hate making salad, but this was so easy and so delicious, it may be what I make on a very regular basis. I cut the Radicchio b/c I didn't have any on hand, and my husband finds it too bitter in any case. Oh, and I was in the midst of making a zillion other things, so I didn't make the Parmesan toasts, either, but I will next time.

Every time I have a dinner party, I think I should try something new, but I always end up making this salad again. It is so good and so easy, and always earns raves. No one has ever mentioned the radicchio, much less picked it out, and I've never noticed any bitterness.

Great salad. When I served, I strained off the excess dressing. If you let the salad sit for 3 minutes only, leaves stay a little more crisp. Also, I made 12 toasts instead of the suggested 6 to 7. Didn't need all of the butter/oil mix or the parmesan. Still turned out wonderful.

Very good. I added sauted chicken and olives to make it a quick one-dish weeknight meal.

This salad is so good - very easy and quick. If I don't have time for the toasts, I shave parmesan on top with a vegie peeler and it turns out very good. Definitely use the radicchio - those who don't like it can pick it out.

Delicious, simple, elegant salad - I omitted the radicchio because I, too, am not a fan but can't imagine it lost much without it. The parmesan toasts were a HUGE hit!

Wonderful. I omitted the radiccio as I thought it would add to the bitterness of the dressing and added grilled red onion and red peppers instead - wonderful. I think it was a perfect contrast to the dressing - a little sweet.

Overall, I found the dressing was mediocre but the wilting effect it produced on the spinach made all the difference. My two nieces enjoyed helping me make the parmesan toasts but wouldn't touch the salad -- probably a little too bitter for their taste!

Delicious! Quick, easy, nice to have spinach instead of lettuce for a change. We loved it!!

I couldn't add pine nuts -- since my 2 baking sheets were occupied by rewarming the Parmesan Toasts -- but it was OK anyway. Maybe more importantly, my culinarily sophisticated grandfather actually took home the leftover salad -- probably a first!

I made this for some friends and their kids are still raving about it. I skipped the radicchio (I'm not a fan). I think it's important to use a good balsamic or else the dressing could be too bitter.

A nice, easy to make salad, although a little bitter (what else can one expect from radicchio and vinegar?). Pine nuts are a must and I added a little crumbled bleu cheese. Also, I made this without the toasts and with half the spinach (only one bag, one small head of radicchio and the called for dressing). It would have been much too dry had I used two bags of spinach.

my roommates call this "your spinach salad" when they mention it to me. i make it often because it's so fantastic. the warm dressing wilts the spinach a bit, bringing out the best of its flavor. plus, toasted pine nuts are so yummy! (unless they're burnt, which sadly has been the case a few times!)

I made this salad for my family before I served it at my gourmet club. My 10 year old daughter ate spinach for the first time! She really liked it although she hated to admit it. I thought it tasted very good and it looks good too. I will definately make it again with the parmesan toasts.

I made this recipe without the radicchio (didn't have it on hand) and it was wonderful. I let it stand for about 7 - 10 minutes before serving and the spinach was perfectly wilted. Next time I may try adding some bacon bits. P.S. my first attempt at a spinach salad!

Did I miss something? Yuck!! The salad looked beautiful, but the dressing was too vinegary and bitter. I took 10 platefuls back to the kitchen.My guests were too polite to say anything but the plates told the story. I should have tried this out first before I served it.That was a good lesson to learn.

Way delicious. Two notes: make sure you have enough dressing to coat the salad, and the toasts don't brown, so careful not to overcook.

This was a nice addition to Christmas Dinner, especially since the colors were basically "Red and Green". The toasts were excellent and should not be omitted. Even the 5 year old loved them!

so simple...and tasty. Serving it warm adds a nice and different touch.

A definite keeper! This would be a great started salad to any meal. The parmesan toasts were delicious and complemented the salad wonderfully. I would let the salad sit a little longer before serving as well. Yum!

This was delicious, but next time, I'll let it stand longer than the five minutes. My guests were hungry so I didn't wait.

Excellent and easy salad that would go with most everything especially pasta. A definite repeat recipe good enough for company. The Parmesan Toasts = 4 forks!!

Excellent recipe--made this for New Year's Eve--the pamesan toast were realllllly good--I had fresh radicchio in my herb garden so it was quite nice just to go out and pick what I needed

This is a great recipe. Leave the dressing on a bit longer to ensure the spinach wilts. The parmesan toasts were a hit with my husband and are a great accompaniment to any dish.

A festive looking salad especially for the holidays. Kept the dressing on a little bit longer than 5 minutes so that the greens wilted a bit more.

This is a delightful salad. I made it again for a party I went to, I added mandarin oranges and it was even better!

Since I was making this for 10 guests, I made 1 1/2 times the recipe which would not have been necessary. The problem was that the spinach did not wilt and there did not seem to be sufficient dressing.Next time I'll use less greens and more dressing and maybe steam it a little as well. The parmesan toasts are great.
