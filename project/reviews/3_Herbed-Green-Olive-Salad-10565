Excellent recipe for olive salad for my New Orleans style Muffalata sandwich. Made cocktail sized sandwichs with this olive salad and turkey, salami, and provolone cheese for a holiday party!

This is a very savory mixture. I doubled the celery and carrots to reduce the saltiness. When all the ingredients are chopped very well, it is nice on a huge sandwich with a variety of salami and cheeses. If you add a little more olive oil it becomes a wonderful salad dressing over greens with blue cheese and walnuts.
