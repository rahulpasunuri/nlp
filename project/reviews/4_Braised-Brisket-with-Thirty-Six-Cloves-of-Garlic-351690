This is now our base recipe for brisket. Reduce cooking temp to 300 or lower. Use red wine for part of the liquid. Cover dutch oven tightly with foil before putting on lid to reduce evaporation.

Oh, I also wanted to say: totally agree if you use a kosher brisket not to add any additional salt. I didn't add any to the brisket, and my stock was unsalted, and the dish, including the gravy, was perfectly seasoned with just a dash of pepper.

Absolutely fantastic. I throw dinner parties frequently and I think this may have gotten the best reaction of anything I've ever made - guests stopped mid-chew to turn to me and say "what IS this and why is it SO DELICIOUS?!" I upped the liquid to 4 cups of homemade stock and 1 cup red wine for a 3.5 pound brisket - took 3 or 3.5 hours and I would have liked a little more liquid in the end even so. By the time I was ready to make the sauce there was only about a cup of braising liquid left - I added some chicken stock before reducing it. So add more liquid than you think you need! I also found the lemon zest flavor fairly pronounced in the sauce - I might leave it out next time but guests liked it, so I think that's just a matter of taste to keep in mind. Overall though fantastic recipe.

This recipe really highlights the flavor of the beef, as opposed to many brisket recipes which really end up being about the sauce. And it was spectacular. The garlic and herbs complement the beef without overwhelming it, and the gravy is more like a delightful jus. My modifications: as many reviewers suggested, I used more liquid. But instead of red wine, I used a sauvignon blanc (about half a bottle) so as not to turn this into a burgundy beef. I also cooked it at a much lower temperature with great results... A 6 lb brisket with lots of fat was falling apart and delicious after 5 hours at 250. 10 people ate every last bit of it. A huge success.

Used a smaller brisket 2-1/2# and converted all other ingredients to the smaller size, next time would make all the gravy as this cooked down too much - loved it anyway even though we wanted more liquid - did chill overnight after the initial cooking so much of left over liquid was gone by morning. That's what I get for not reading the reviews before making :). First rate dish!

I was going to make this for dinner, but due to last minute emergency I didn't have a chance to stay home to cook. I already had the garlic peeled so inspired by this recipe I made the brisket in the slow-cooker. I just cleaned the meat (3 lbs), placed into the greased crock-pot. Garlic on top, poured 1 pkg of french onion soup mix to cover and slow cooked it on high for 7 hours. Didn't add any liquid. The dish came out amazingly tasty. I just let it cool for an hour. Took the meat out of the juices, sliced it. Placed the juices and garlic into the blender and made a smooth gravy. With mashed potato it was a hit. Tender, juicy and had a very strong flavor. I'll make it again, probably the same way. It was so easy too.

I decided to try this for our Seder based on the reviews posted here. As most others have said, this is a great find!! I, too, added wine. I also made in advance, chilled, sliced and then made the gravy and let the sliced meat soak up the flavors. The meat gets more flavorful by the day!!!

I made this for the annual brisket- off at my friends' seder. We were working with a smaller brisket (about 3.3 lbs), but I followed other reviewers' advice and upped the liquid (4 cups chicken stock and half a bottle of red wine). I also added a sliced onion when I added the garlic. Did the refridgerate overnight option and then made the gravy the next day. The flavor was PHENOMENAL. We ran into some over- reduction issues with the gravy between the reheating at our place and transportation to/reheating at our friends' place, so it ended up LOOKING dry, but the meat had soaked up all the gravy, and was fall-apart tender and oh so delicious!

We served this for our seder tonight. It was INCREDIBLY GOOD! The sauce was amazing. It was perfect to prepare in advance, and keep warm during the seder service. I would definitely make this again.

Extremely tender brisket. As other cooks suggested, this needs more liquid. I added a bottle of red wine minus a glass (cook's tax). I also blended all of the gravy -- it had a lovely consistency after only about 10 minutes of reducing it. Went great with mashed potatoes and some sauteed kale. Leftovers make a great sandwich!

Awesome recipe! I normally braise brisket in a "darker" broth, ie beef stock, red wine, tomato paste, so I didn't think this would be memorable. Boy was I wrong! This simple preparation is now my favorite. I cooked my meat an extra hour, as it was grassfed, and I added a sprinkling of chili flakes for zing. Following other reviewers' suggestions, I scaled up the amount of liquid, which was indeed needed.

Made this for our seder this year with a 1st cut 5lb brisket, cooked in a Le Creuset dutch oven. Did anyone else find the liquid level to be too low? I added 2-3 cups of stock, but it still didn't cover the top of the brisket. How do you know when the brisket is fork tender enough? At 3 hours it was fork tender but I didn't know what would happen if I kept cooking...when is it overcooked? As it so happened, 3 hours was good-- brisket was tender but not as juicy as other recipes I've made when it's submerged in liquid for the duration of cook time.

I made this for Passover and everyone loved it, there were no leftovers and I only got one bite. But the one bite was enough to make it again. Of course I did alter it, I added scallions and about 3 tablespoons of red wine with the red wine vinegar. It was tender and soft. I also cooked it in a cooking bag which made it very tender indeed, just fell apart.

As if you need another review to tell you to MAKE THIS NOW! It's delicious. And it makes way more than 8 servings, esp if you use a larger piece of brisket. I made a 4.5lb 2nd cut piece, and we're still eating leftovers. Word of caution, though, if you're using Kosher meat. Don't add any extra salt! The gravy will be salty enough from the kashered meat. I ended up adding 1.5 cups of broth to my gravy to cut the salt.

I agree this recipe is exceptional and easy. The gravy is yummy beyond words. But I did make a few changes: added 1 large sliced onion along with the garlic. Subsituted the red wine vinegar with white wine. Used 2 cups stock and 1 cup white wine plus a dollop of dijon mustard. Gravy turns out rich and smooth.

We love garlic, and this recipe was not a disappointment. I made it without any changes and guests raved. I did try to do it all in a fairly short time frame. Next time I'll braise it the day before, and then reheat.

I made this for my brother's birthday, and it was a huge hit. Like others, I added a bit of red wine to the braising liquid. The meat came out moist, tender, and flavourful, with relatively little effort. I served it with mashed potatoes with goat cheese and basil, and sauteed swiss chard. Mmmmmm.

Tender and delicious! Hubby loved it too.

This recipe was an absolute disappointment. I followed it exactly,except that I had to use dried rosemary. When the brisket had been cooking for 3 hours, it was dry and tasteless. I added 2.5 cups of Zinfandel, and some carrots and onions. The sauce that resulted - pureed braising liquid and most of the garlic cloves + lime zest (no lemons) and more rosemary was thankfully pretty good. I'm definitely going back to recipes that include wine and/or tomatoes. Next time I would also not cut off so much fat.

I made this for a dinner party..(I'm a personal chef in L.A) and I was very happy with this recipe, although I added a cup and a half of Malbec, and pearl onions and carrots to the braising liquid..and ultimately pureed it all together so it was an entirely smooth but thicker style gravy. Served along with Creme Fraiche mashed potatoes, and Roasted Autumn Vegetables.. Everyone raved..

I've made this twice, and loved it both times. The brisket was very tender, and the garlic becomes very mild when braised. I found it very very salty both times, perhaps because I used kosher meat. But I also didn't have much liquid left by the end. Has anyone else had this experience? I added white wine, OJ, and water to the gravy at the end to reduce the saltiness and get a bit more gravy. I would definitely make this again.

I'm not Jewish, but I love to braise, so I decided to go for it. I don't understand why some people are advising others to stay away from this. I don't know what tam is and I'm curious as to what made this recipe sound deplorable. Anyway, I made some small changes (of course, who doesn't): I added about 1 cup of red wine to the braise, I used about 25 cloves instead of 36, and I also chopped up an onion to go in it. I thought it turned out wonderfully! The brisket was so flavorful and just fell apart. I loved pureeing the garlic and onions with some of the liquid and making a gravy. I don't know if 25 cloves made a difference, but the garlic wasn't overpowering at all. It was a big hit at dinner. I'll definitely be making this again in the future.

This was a hit at our seder last night, and we had the leftovers for dinner again this evening. My only changes were that I put it in the oven at 275 for a little longer than the recipe called for, and I may have been a few cloves short of the 36 (really, after the first two dozen it's not going to make a difference one way or the other!), but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great. My four-year-old daughter even enjoyed helping me with the garlic peeling and the basting.

I have to agree with all, unless you have tried to cook a recipe from here, you should not comment on how it is! Another trick to garlic is use the flat (not sharp) side of your knife to lightly "smash" the clove and it cracks the skin and will peel right off. Also, some dish soap in your hands with a liberal sprinkling of salt, then wash will completely get rid of the garlic smell! I will be making this for dinner tonight as it sounds great!

...That's o.k., I'm sure she also loiters at restaurants telling patrons what they shouldn't order hahaha. I made this brisket, it was simple, delicious and uncomplicated. I had a tip about the garlic: you can buy a jar of peeled cloves, OR wear latex gloves and give each clove a firm twist, with right and left hands moving in opposite directions. ( Think NORTH and SOUTH. )The gloves pull the skin right off, AND you won't have to sleep outside for the next couple of days...

I tried this tonight in preperation for second seder since I didn't want a disaster. I was worried about that much garlic and the posted revies but needn't have worried. Wonderfully aromatic and very tasty. I let it cool and refrigerated overnight then warmed up tonight. And I used second cut brisket.

Manhattanm - I couldn't agree with you more! My pet peeve on Epicurious.com is people who complain about recipes they have altered significantly (like "I didn't have any heavy cream, so I used water instead - and the scones were like hockey pucks!") but this is the first time I've actually come across someone posting without having even *attempted* to make the dish in question. Me? I may do this for Passover next week - if I do, I'll be sure to report back how it went. :-)

I cannot understand the previous two reviewers making comments on something neither has attempted to cook. I have made this brisket twice, it got raving reviews from all guests. I have tried numerous recipes from each of Jayne Cohen's books, all with marvelous results. It's my understanding that simpleminded cooks who are stuck with "salt & peppering" as their routine, would find her scrumptious brisket "overfussy"!
