1/4 cup tamarind concentrate I meant to write. Maybe the other users aren't using the right type of tamarind??

I used 1/4 cup (actually a little more) and it was fantastic. It gave it a nice tang. I think it's a perfect amount.

Delicious! I used 1/4 cup of tamarind pulp as reconstituted from a wet tamarind block. I also added chopped bell peppers and fresno peppers, which made it more of a stew. The flavors are fantastic. I will definitely make this again, probably often.

I have always made this with tamarind block and then diluted with 6 tsp hot water as directed in the cooks notes. Have just changed brand of concentrate so will see if it matches up otherwise will revert... I absolutely adore this recipe and have made it time and time again.

yes, sadly the tamarind amount is way off. A teaspoon probably would have been a good amount. Not even sure if the vinegar is necessary. And I'd add *more* shredded coconut (and perhaps *not* grind it up with the other spices). The results looked absolutely nothing like the picture.

After reading other reviews, I added tamarind to taste. The dish was delicious! Very complex flavors - spicy and tangy but didn't cover up the taste of the shrimp. I couldn't find unsweetened coconut so I bought one and grated it. Now I have a mountain of coconut. Next time I make this it will be sooooo much easier.

There must have been a typo. I agree with a previous poster, 1/4 c could be the amount needed if you reconstituted a tamarind "block", but like the poster before me...1 teaspoon is an adequate amount of tamarind concentrate for 6 according to the bottle/package directions. Very disappointed.

I also tried this one - and thought that 1/4 cup of tamarind concentrate is WAY too much - it turned the marinade black (not at all like the pinky red in the picture) and completely overpowered all the other flavours. I ended up using a third of the yield, adding a whole extra tomato, a little more coconut - then coating the shrimp as a marinade for half and hour and finally grilling them on the bbq. They were saved! I would make this again - but I will try only a teaspoon of tamarind MAX next time. I also wonder if this recipe needs a correction published - ???

I don't review recipes I've altered, but I thought this might help the previous poster. I don't like tamarind concentrate and the amount called for sounded like way too much. I replaced the concentrate with 2T dried tamarind reconstituted 1/3 warm water. Strain, and add to pan with 1T brown sugar. With those adjustments, the dish was absolutely delicious.

I think that the amount of tamarind concentrate is wrong. The paste had way too much tamarind concentrate. Can you ask Ms. Sahni if there is a mistake?
