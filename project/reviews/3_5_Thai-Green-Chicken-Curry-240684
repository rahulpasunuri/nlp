Not sure why people think this is bland - its a basic Tai green curry recipe! Can't get much more simple than this. Like others have commented, I'd add more curry paste, but it's certainly not required. The brand of curry paste you use is going to dictate the taste of the dish (I prefer Mae Ploy), and I also use Thai basil, and ginger root shavings. Vegetables can be anything (I used cabbage the other day, but don't cook it through - should be almost crispy). I do light on the fish sauce (trying to keep sodium down), and heavy on the lime juice.

Anemic on flavor. Added more green curry paste, lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, thai green chilies, and red pepper paste and this dish was still lacking...

This recipe was very good. I always add more vegetables like broccoli and carrots. I often have a problem though that the coconut milk gets broken. Can someone comment on how to prevent that?

As everyone else has said, you have to increase the curry!! I buy my thai green curry at my local asian grocery, which comes in a large 500 gram bin and I used 3 heaping tsps. As long as you do this, the recipe is no fail . . . and highly adaptable. Use shrimp or tofu instead of chicken; add already cooked green beans, potatoes, eggplant; or bamboo shoots or mushrooms. It is very very easy and tastes like good thai restaurant food.

So delicious! This was the first curry I ever made at home and it turned out very well. I followed the advice of many of the other reviewers and added almost the whole jar of curry paste and doubled the fish sauce and it was very good. I also added some onion chunks and small potato pieces and was as good as many curries I have had at restaurants. Will be making this again for sure.

I made this once as written, and found it lacking something. Made it again tonight with the following modifications, and my husband and I both thought it was restaurant quality 4 star. I added 2 tbsp each of ginger and garlic to the shallots, and I increased the amount of curry paste to 1/4 cup (the brand I used was World Foods, and it was very mild). I also increase the fish sauce to 2 tbsp. I added 1 tbsp of brown sugar, 1 tbsp of Sriracha, and I put some small broccoli florets in with the red pepper. Served it over jasmine rice. Excellent!

just had this at my daughter's and she added double the amount of thai green curry paste, water chestnuts,bamboo shoots,habanero peppers, sliced, and the seeds to the sauce, cilantro and more basil which brings this up to a definite four forks

Really bland. Came out like a bowl of chicken soup - chicken should be pre-cooked and drained.

As written, this is a two star recipe. I followed the excellent advice of other reviewers and added more generous portions of fish sauce and curry. I used over a tablespoon of curry paste and 4 teaspoons of fish sauce. The result was yummy, comforting and mild.

Ok. As-is, this is REALLY bland, but it has a lot of potential to be great. I definitely should have read the reviews beforehand. It needs chilli peppers for heat, you'll need to double (maybe even triple) the amount of curry paste and fish sauce, add some bamboo shoots ('cause it 'ain't Chicken Curry without bamboo shoots), and add cilantro.

I made this with onions instead of shallots, added bamboo shoots and cilantro, and served it with lime basil rice. It was pretty tasty and quick to make. In the future, I would add some fresh chilies to give heat.

This recipe came out disappointingly bland. I followed everything. I think it had too much coconut milk and not enough of the green curry paste and fish sauce. Half way though eating the dish, I ended up adding another 2 tsp of fish sauce and 2 tsp of green curry paste.

This recipe is great. Ends up tasty after just a little preparation. Along with the other reviews' suggestions, I add water chestnuts with the red pepper, and hot peppers with the shallots. I made a video of the dish for my blog: http://makeityourdamnself.wordpress.com (Thai Green Curry Chicken)

I added some more flavor early on to increase the heat. First, I sauted garlic, chopped ginger, and dried chopped chili peppers. Then I added the coconut milk and green curry paste (1 Tbsp!). I let it simmer for 10 min, then added the fish sauce, curry powder (for more flavor), chicken, and frozen stir fry veggies. I also added some crushed red pepper for heat and 1/3 cup chicken stock. While it simmered I added some fresh squeezed lime juice. The flavor was delicious and tasted very authentic!

Good! I suggest increasing the coconut milk and the curry paste. Although this will make it "spicier" the paste draws out the flavors of the coconut milk. Add small carrot pieces to add a "sweeter" touch.

Good, but didn't taste like a curry. I might make it again and increase the curry paste, but I'm more likely to try a different recipe.

I made this twice, and it was delicious both times. Added 2 tbsps of brown sugar and 3 tsps of curry powder as other people suggested. I also added chopped hot peppers in the beginning to add some kick. And bamboo shoots as the chicken cooked since it's just not green curry without them. Yum

I would also recommend doubling (or tripling?) the curry paste. I added a LOT more veggies (new potatoes, tomatoes, snap peas, mushrooms, and pineapple). In order to compensate for the extra "stuff", I doubled the broth.

Did recipe with some suggested changes. Increased curry paste to 3 heaping teaspoons (used Thai Kitchen brand) and added two tablespoons of brown sugar. I also added a handful of chopped cilantro and a handful of frozen peas. It didn't have the "pow" in both flavor and intensity I'm used to from the more authentic Thai food places I've been to. We don't eat a lot of rice, so we served it over diced roasted sweet potatoes and it tasted pretty good. It was also easy and quick to make. I'd make it again.

In addition to the red bell pepper, I added sugar snap peas and literally threw both in for a couple minutes at the end so they stayed really crispy. Doubled the amount of green curry used, and put Sriracha out on the table for my guests, mmm! Also, I quickly sauteed the chicken prior to putting it with the green curry mixture but I don't think it was necessary. Next time will probably do without that extra step (not part of the recipe but was recommended in some reviews).

Rating: 3
Good as a basic recipe to improvise on. I made the following changes: Waaaaay more curry paste (as suggested by many others posting here) About 1/4 - 1/2 cup brown sugar to add the sweetness the basic recipe lacks. Sriracha made all the difference in the world. I added some to the pan and set it out as a condiment.

Needed far more curry. Pretty bland. Better off using the Thai Shrimp Curry recipe and substitute chicken. It works out great.

Bleh. Very bland. Tasted it while I was making it and asked my husband to order Thai food instead. Heading straight from pan to trash. Recipe's success probably depends on the green curry paste you use--I found the only one my favorite store had (and they usually have great spices).

This was a recipe that made a bland, flavorless curry...I actually tried it twice and still could not get it to have any real flavor. It's basically the same recipe as what is contained in Mridula Baljekar's "Best Curry Cook Book Ever" which is a completely inaccurate title. I cook lots of Indian food and have been trying to learn Thai but it isn;t easy.

Rating: 3
This is a good, basic recipe (I used red curry because that's what I had at home), but it's missing a complexity of flavor for me. I think I will research Thai spices so I can add them to the dish and give it an extra boost of flavor.

I love that the lot of us aren't even following the recipe... I also used light coconut milk, 1 small onion instead of shallots, and 2 1/2 tsp red curry paste. I could have gone for even more, but the flavor was good and won my boyfriend's approval. Additionally, I added 1 1/2 cups peas and a dash of hot oil while he wasn't looking. First, I cooked the chicken in a wok until lightly browned and cooked through. I set it aside, added a bit more oil to the wok, and then added the onion and bell pepper. After these both showed slight browning, I added the curry paste and stirred well. This was followed by 1 1/2 cup peas, the coconut milk, and the fish sauce. I stirred it well, brought it to a boil, and then I let it simmer for a bit to thicken up. While it still had a little more to go, I added the chicken and let it thicken up a bit more. I'd already prepared Jasmine rice while I was doing the prep, so I was ready to roll. I threw on a little chopped basil and served with the lime slice on the side - yummy. I've had a few bland, soupy curries at Thai restaurants, so this was nice. Like I said though, I could've gone a little hotter.

My boyfriend and I loved this and will make it again. No adjustments made to the recipe and it came out great.

As usual, glad I read other reviews before making this meal; browned the chicken with the peppers after the shallots were about ready, then added the (lite) coconut milk et al. I think my green curry paste must have aquired more heat from ageing..1 tsp was plenty hot enough for us and we like spicy! Served over combination of leftover brown and white rice. Not sure I'll repeat this one, but it was a nice change of pace for us.

With only a little over a teaspoon for the curry paste, why bother?! At least 2 ounces of curry paste should be used (and up to 4 oz). No wonder everyone said it was so bland. Also consider that commercial curry pastes vary greatly in degree of spiciness and depth of taste. Mae Ploy from Thailand is a good ready made paste and also Nittaya brand.

I made only a few small modifications and this was very good, a milder version of what we would expect from Thai Green Curry here in the UK. I used One onion instead of shallots and added bamboo shoots as others have. I did also brown the chicken a little before adding the coconut milk. Using Thai Taste Green Curry Paste at about 2 Tablespoons and maybe 1 Teaspoon of nam plaa yielded a nicely mild curry. My wife and I agreed that next time we would up the Curry Paste, and/or add a chili to increase the spice.

I agree with the other reviewers: strangely fatty and bland. It's a very Americanized version of this dish, one I really love at Thai restaurants. I'll keep looking.

Quick & easy weeknight meal, however thought it lacked flavor and didn't look anything like the picture, much creamier. I too used light coconut milk. Think recipe would benefit from addition of some chicken broth and cilantro in place of basil, also used about 3 teaspoons of green curry paste for more flavor.

My fiancé and I both loved this recipe. I, too, used lite coconut milk and thought it turned out well, although we both added Srirachi to give it more kick.

I have to think the green curry paste and fish sauce have something to do with the mixed results everyone got from this recipe. I added 2 heaping teaspoons of green curry paste and some Habanero Tabasco at the end because the sauce was so bland when I made it according to the recipe.For the paste and fish sauce, I used Thai Kitchen brand.

Excellent Excellent! But I increased the fish sauce and thai curry to 1 tbsp (3 tsp) each, and added the salt and pepper right after adding the coconut and fish sauce. Also, I recommend that you do not serve immediately but wait 1 hour or so to let the flavors intensify. I will make this again and again

Wow, this was fantastic. I made it exactly as written using a good green curry paste. It had the perfect heat level and the sauce was wonderfully flavorful. I'd say this was even better than my favorite Thai restaurant, and so easy to make. It will become a regular on my rotation.

This was really good! Just as the recipe says it was 25 min!. I started the rice before I got into the curry. Used Thai Red Curry instead because it is what I had. I sauted mushrooms on a separate pan. Added cauliflower at the same time than the red peppers and unfortunately forgot the lime juice! :( But it was still excellent. All my family enjoyed the dish even though I have a couple picky eaters.
