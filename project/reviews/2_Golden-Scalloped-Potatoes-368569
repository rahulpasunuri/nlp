Okay, if you are looking for an easy and somewhat less fattening scalloped potato, then sure. Despite the flour, the sauce still separated after being put in the oven and the flavor was lack luster to me. Wouldn't make it again.

Tasty. I wanted scalloped potatoes. Cut the recipe down to suit my 1-1/2 new potatoes in the frig and cooked it in the toaster oven. Easy and good!
