I did not like this recipe. The dough didn't come together in the food processor. It just solidified into a hard unworkable lump. Had to add water to loosen it up but went too far and had to knead with plenty of flour to get it back. More detail about how thin to roll the sheets would have been helpful as well as tips on avoiding allowing cheese to gush out which prevents the top and bottom from sticking completely. I've made pasta from several other recipes successfully. Not sure what it is about this one. Also used 11 eggs but had the whites of 8 eggs left over. What a waste.

I did spice up the cheese. I put some mozzarella and a mix of other italian cheese blend, some dried parsely, garlic and onion powder. I don't normally like cheese filled stuff but I made these for husband and kids and they loved them...to my surprise I enjoyed them a lot too! This is the best dough recipe I've tried yet. (I didn't make the tomato sauce.)

I add a grating of fresh nutmeg and finely minced parsley or fresh spinach

The pasta was easy to make and easy to work with. I didn't have any parm. so I used a more flavorful hard Italian cheese, added onion salt and oregano.

Though I didn't make the fresh tomato sauce, I thought that the pasta dough was wonderful - not too dry and very easy to work with. I agree with the previous reviewer - the filling is bland as is. I spiced it up with 1/4 C chopped fresh thyme, a bit of chopped lemon zest and a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice. Very tasty!

Very tasty, although I think it was a little bland. To spice it up, I advice you to add thyme-yum!
