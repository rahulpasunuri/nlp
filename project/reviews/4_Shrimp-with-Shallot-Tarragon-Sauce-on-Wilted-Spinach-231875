My heavens, but this is tasty! And incredibly speedy and fairly healthy! Yes, there's cream in the sauce (and butter, OK, OK) but if you're someone, like me, who is trying to avoid starch, you will not even MISS those carbs. Highly recommended.

Not only was this very tasty, it was also a very fast prep-and-cook meal. The flavours, with the tarrgaon and ginger, were excellent - both sweet and spicey. Like others, I used less butter and half and half in place of cream, and the flavors and consistency were good. I also made twice the spinach to provide more vegetables. So easy, yet it would be an impressive meal for guests, too. This is a keeper recipe!

Delicious and different. We will double the spinach next time. I increased the amount of shrimp to about 14 pieces of 21/25, and butterflied them to get the herb mixture on as much of the surface of the shrimp as possible. I will try omitting the addition of the second teaspoon of ginger the next time I make this--plenty of gingery flavor with just the first teaspoon, and it overwhelmed the tarragon a bit. I used half and half. This recipe could easily double or triple for more servings. Watch that the sauce at the end doesn't get too hot after you add in the dairy, or it will separate.

Absolutely delicious! I used dried tarragon and frozen spinach (what I had on hand). Served with amaranth. I think it would also be great with quinoa.

This was such a simple preparation and the flavors were amazing. You didn't taste each specific flavor just a wonderful combination flavor. I would do more spinach to make a fuller meal. Will definitely be making this again!

I love to make this recipe. I do the spinach first so the shrimp don't continue cooking as the spinach. I also use only 1/2 tbs lemon juice on the spinach as I thought it too lemon-y. I serve it often as a really great dinner.

I do the spinach first so the shrimp do not cook as they are waiting. Also, I use less lemon juice on the spinach, it seemed too lemony the first time. I love this recipe.

Very tasty and quickly made. Cooked everything in the same skillet in the order specified in the recipe, though omitted the butter and substituted creme fraiche for the whipping cream. This worked very well.

This was amazing...got rave reviews at a holiday dinner party - I can't recommend it highly enough!

Pretty delicious! Made with 9 oz of spinach and that was a really good amount for two of us. Also used 3/4 lb of shrimp. As others said, the same amount of sauce was fine - not need to make extra if you increase shrimp amount. Added a touch of lemon zest with the lemon juice. Served with quinoa - great meal!

I won't repeat the raves- it's a great dish- my only comment and note for next time is that I'll double the spinach, which is delicious but wilts to nothing. Also subbed half and half for cream which was excellent.

Wonderful recipe. Used a lb. of shrimp and dried tarragon. Subbed half n half for the cream. Added a clove of minced garlic to the oil before wilting the spinach. Try it over spinach; you won't be disappointed

This recipe is wonderful! I have made it twice. Once as a recipe test and the second time for a small dinner party. For the reviewers who didn't rate it 4 forks: it IS important to use fresh tarragon and ginger. Watch the time so you don't overcook the shrimp. The only changes I made was adding 5 tablespoons of cream instead of 3. I also served it over fetticini instead of spinach. Excellent dish, everyone loved it!

I have made this recipe 4 times in 5 weeks! We absolutely LOVE it and it is so simple to prepare. I serve it with angle hair pasta-and I add extra tarragon, ginger and spinach. It is fabulous!

I made this last night for dinner. It was perfect for a novice cook like myself, and the flavors were wonderful. I doubled the recipe so I would have leftovers and used skim milk instead of cream. I also added some baby portobella mushrooms and served it all over angel hair pasta. Definitely a keeper!

The combination of ginger and fresh tarragon was unusual and very flavorful. I, too, served this with some spinach pasta instead of wilted fresh spinach. A big hit.

Rating: 4
Really wonderful recipe, as I was skeptical. We are foodies and immediately agreed that this was a keeper. Dryed tarragon worked great (you use 1/3 of what was called for) Used a full pound of shrimp with the alloted sauce. Have some leftovers, yippeee

The shrimp with sauce recipe was delicious. We cooked it as written (substituted milk with and a bit more butter for cream) and served over fresh saffron pasta. Absolutely delicious. Glad we ate it with pasta instead of just over spinach. I made cooked spinach to go with the pasta which made a nice complimentary side dish.

Rating: 4
A lovely dish. I was lazy and chose, instead of dirtying a second pan, to wilt the spinach in the same pan with the shrimp. Also didn't have any cream on hand so just left it out (as well as the extra calories). It was still delicious!

Rating: 3
I made this the other night for a quick week night meal at it was terrific. Very quick, especially since I bought already peeled and deveined shrimp. They did not have fresh tarragon at the store, so I used dried. Next time will try for fresh tarragon and bet it will be even better. I did cut back a bit on the butter (1 T) and probably a bit over on the cream (I overflowed when I measured). Definitely will make again.

Rating: 2
Eh. This underwhelmed me. The flavors were pleasant enough, but none shone through distinctly enough to lift it above blandness. I thought it needed something more, so I tossed it with spaghetti. Still - not enough payoff for the relative expense of ingredients and the effort involved.

Rating: 4
Easy and delicious. I used about double the amount of large, rather than jumbo shrimp, and we still didn't feel that the recipe as written was substantial enough for two people for dinner. We'll probably add some angel hair pasta next time...and there will most definitely be a next time!

Rating: 3
Very Good, even better 2nd day! There was a slightly bitter flavor, but overall it was delish. My kids who usually love shrimp didn't really appreciate them with wilted spinach, though! Would make it again for myself (hubby doesn't appreciate anything other than meat and potatoes).

When I started making this recipe, I thought I had all the ingredients on hand. Unfortunately, I had to substitute dried tarragon for fresh, and ground ginger for the fresh. So maybe it would've been phenomenal if I had those fresh ingredients, instead of the dried. But as it was, it was just good. Not bad, but not great. It was good.No complaints, but not a WOW recipe either. I'll make it again with the fresh tarragon and ginger, and see if that makes it a "Wow" recipe.

This dish was absolutely delicious. I read some of the reviews before attempting and, like many others, used a whole pound of shrimp and doubled the sauce, which was every bit as good as most reviews said it was. It was a little embarrasing, but I licked the plate clean!

One of the best recipes we've ever made!!! Make sure to have some good crusty bread on hand to lop up the delicious sauce!

This was fast, easy, and delicious! The sauce was neither bland nor too runny, and it was full of flavor. I didn't make any substitutions and it turned out great. I served it with orzo, as suggested elsewhere on this website, and it was a great combo. The only change I would make next time has already been mentioned by others -- more spinach! Oh also, using already shelled and cleaned shrimp is a great timesaver.

Rating: 4
this was reallly good and easy to do. However, next time i do this I will cook the shrimp before, and let the sauce thicken a bit more. Our sauce was a bit too runny for us so next time we will make the sauce thicker. The flavors were wonderful!!!!! jane, chicago, ill

This was sooo good! Dicing the shallots took a while, but it was totally worth it. I doubled the recipe to serve three, and made it a complete meal by layering over round polenta cakes. My friend just asked me for the recipe!

I made this recipe last night with frozen pre-cooked small shrimp (I just rinsed, thawed and squeezed dry), dried tarragon, light cream instead of heavy, half the butter, and garlic instead of ginger. I know, a LOT of substitutions -- but it still turned out fantastic! I did use beautifully fresh parsley, which added a nice zing. I also just steamed the baby spinach -- the sauce seemed rich enough and it was. Served spinach and shrimp over Hang's noodles, which are these mild broad oriental noodles. Anyway, everybody loved this wonderfully simple and easy (well, the way I made it!) recipe -- a real keeper!

Fantastic! Lot's of raves from 2 very critical guests. Easy and gourmet - what more could you want?! It was NOT bland at all, perfect. I doubled it and it was only enough for 3 people. If I had 4, I guess I'd have to triple. I asked for constructive criticism -what to add, remove, make again? They all said it was perfect, don't change a thing, and definitely make it again as soon as possible. BIG HIT. I gave one guest the left over sauce (which was hardly anything, but she loved it so much she wanted every drop available). I think, though, that you really have to watch the butter quantity. Don't put in more than what's called for. I might even try adding wine to it. Maybe. Do not serve with any other buttery thing, like garlic bread -which was just too much. Rice would be perfect. Or plain italian bread, everyone sopped up every bit of sauce. The cook that said this was bland definitely did something wrong. Follow the ingredients, use fresh products -you can't go wrong. Serve w/ a young sweet chardonay, like yellow tail wine (with pic of kangeroo). Too dry takes away from the flavors.

This is by far one of my favorite dishes I have found! The sauce is absolutely amazing, although I add more cream than it asks for. The chopping takes some time, but it is well worth it! I double the spinach and serve it with brown rice -- healthy and delicious!!

This recipe is full of flavors and simply delicious. It's currently one of my favorites. I'm surprised at the reviewer who said it was bland - maybe they didn't use fresh herbs and ginger? Like others, I increase the amount of spinach and serve it alongside rice pilaf, which I mix with the sauce. YUM!

I'm giving this recipe 2 forks because I thought it was delicious - rich but delicate flavor, and super easy to make - but my husband thought it was completely bland. In fact, he stated he would rather not eat it again, which means quite a lot coming from him. So I would say if you need a bold flavor to enjoy a meal, this may not be the ideal choice. If subtlety works for you then by all means, make this recipe. Be sure to have crusty bread handy as this has a wonderful sauce (assuming you like the flavor!).

I am not a great cook and I threw caution to the wind in preparing it for 5 friends. It was quick, delicious and impressive. I did serve it over jasmine rice which rounded out the dish. I making it again for my boyfriend!

Meets the criteria of "fast, fresh, and easy." A delightful summertime dish for that tarragon growing in your herb garden. I agree with the other reviewers who recommend increasing the amount of spinach. The flavor is distinctive enough for a company dish but easy enough for an everynight meal.

after reading the reviews, i used 18 shrimp and added at least a teaspoon of jarred chopped garlic. i did not actually measure the ingredients, but eyeballed them, probably to the more side than less. served it over rice-delicious and no leftovers!!!! was not sure how husband would like the tarragon, but the flavors were lip-smacking good :)

I agree with the other writers; it is delicious, light and refreshing it also needs to be doubled to be more filling for a main course. I added some garlic and next time I will not wilt the spinach fully if at all.

This was the first time I ever cooked with shrimp (peeling, deveining, etc.) so I wasn't sure how it was going to turn out. It was SO DELICIOUS. I will make this recipe time and time again. It is also a light enough dish that you still feel good after eating a lot of it.

We really liked this recipe! The only thing I would do differently is double the recipe as it wasn't enough for my husband and I (even though the recipe says it serves 2) I will keep the recipe for a time like lent when I struggle for new "meatless" ideas.

This was really delish. Followed as is except used a few more shrimp and had fresh spinach from the garden instead of baby spinach. Served it with Orzo Pilaf with Mushrooms also from this site.

I made this the other night for mother's day based on the rave reviews. I used white wine (J. Lohr Chard) instead of cream and olive oil instead of butter. It was lighter and AMAZING in flavor. I also added garlic because, well, everyone loves garlic! This was a huge hit and so delicious!
