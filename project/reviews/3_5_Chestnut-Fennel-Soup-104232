The soup is simple and delicious. I wouldn't change a thing. (I did omit the garnish, however.) I did serve it the day after making it, which I'd recommend, but unlike other soups I've made, it was interesting enough to serve right away. Peeling chestnuts is a modest pain in the arse, but not as laborious as some reviewers suggest. I was somewhat amused by the directions to wear "protective eyewear" for peeling chestnuts. I didn't know it was such dangerous work.

This will be my fourth or fifth Thanksgiving in a row making this soup. I don't really make any modifications, except that I skip the garnish steps after the soup itself has been made. I also freeze this soup ahead and then add the half and half after it has been defrosted and heated up, just before serving. Saves time on a busy day!

Forgot to get it my star rating! 4 stars for flavor and ease of preparation. Probably 3 stars for visual appeal.

This has become a staple for our Thanksgiving meal. We love it. For my husband, it's a taste of home since he's from Europe. I buy jarred chestnuts for the soup and it's simple which is great so I then can spend more time and energy on the rest of the meal. I too skip on the garnish and agree it's not a pretty soup, but it's something different, nearly everyone loves the flavor and yes, it is very filling, so only serve a little bit if pairing it with a big meal (like Thanksgiving)

Fantastic soup. Always raves. I like a little more of the fennel flavor and modify it by adding half again as much fennel as recipe calls for. I also sometimes add about 1/4 cup of dry sherry just before serving. I also soak the chestnuts in hot water before roasting and then pour boiling water over them after the roasting and keep them in the hot water while I peel them, it makes them a little easier to peel. PS I grow my own chestnuts.

I have been making this soup for years- always use the jarred chestnuts to save time. Always gets rave reviews. I find the additional garnish of chestnuts and butter to be overkill.

Last year Trader Joe's carried frozen roasted PEELED chestnuts during the holidays. (This certainly improved my enjoyment of the season, chestnut dressing is a requirement at my house.)

Wonderful right from the smell of roasted chestnuts in my kitchen during the prep to the final spoonfuls in the bowl. Like the tip for soaking the chestnuts prior to roasting, made them slightly easier to peel than just roasting dry.

Delicious and easy if you use the peeled chestnuts in a jar. Very filling!

A rich and wonderful fall soup.

This was good but peeling the roasted chestnuts was way too much trouble! The bits of skin left on made the soup very tannic.

An absolutely spendid holiday soup

Not so visually appealing, but tastes very good. I was ambivalent about serving this but my guests seemed to like it. The flavours do seem to meld surprisingly well. Since 14 oz bottled chestnuts cost $15 in my grocery store, this is a soup for special occasions!

I have made this soup twice and gotten raves both times. I make it the day before my dinner and it tastes even better. Perfect Thanksgiving Dinner first course. The key is to substitute a can of Chestnut puree, instead of peeling chestnuts or using the ones in the jar (I use those only for the garnish). Chestnut puree is imported from France and is available at specialty food shops. It seems to make a creamier, richer soup. I have made different chestnut soups and I like this recipe best, made with the puree. The only Chestnut soup that it better is one made by Jean Louis Palladin.

This soup was okay. Roasting & shelling the chestnuts were alot of work and not worth the effort. I didn't care for the pithy texture of the chestnuts in this soup. I used 3 small fresh fennel bulbs but could barely taste the fennel. There are so many other delicious soups out there, I wouldn't bother with this one again.

This was an awful lot of work for not-a-large-pot of soup...but once I sat down with my guests that didn't bother me so much. It has a wonderful earthy flavor. I'll make this again, but I won't be roasting chestnuts again anytime soon - too labor-intensive! Don't skip the garnish, by the way - it would be nice atop almost any winter soup.

I made this for my family on Thanksgiving weekend and they all loved it. It's very easy if you have a hand-held blender.

Very tasty and rich. I didn't use fennel and next time I'll use chestnuts from a jar - it takes to much time and effort to roast and peel them at home.

This soup was great! The texture was very nice as well. The shallots and leek really make the dish. I made this for a small dinner party recently and had rave reviews from all. People liked it so much, it ended up only serving us 4 (not 6-8 as the recipe suggested). So easy and quick to make. I actually made it the night before and just heated it up right before my guests arrived. I used roasted chesnuts from a jar (from Williams-Sonoma), available this time of year.
