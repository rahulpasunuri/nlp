This was the perfect side dish for a sirloin roast. I wanted a potato dish I could cook on the stove top and this was a huge hit. Every onion and potato was consumed. I used pearl onions since I couldn't find cipolline and they were great. Used dill and it was very nice.

Very yummy! I did not use dill opting instead to use a generous handful of fresh chopped rosemary and sage. I think it brings out the flavors more. I also used baby white fingerling potatoes. Went great with a grilled steak!

Loved it. I can't spring for the cipolline's often, but this dish brings out their flavor well.

This potatoes where really good, everyone enjoyed it!!! I added up a little bit of olive oil to the butter and substituted half of the dill for parsley. The presentation was also good. Esta receta queda muy buena. Yo sustitui la mitad del dill con perejil y a~adi un poco de aceite de oliva junto con la mantequilla al hornear.

This recipe was wonderful! The potatoes were lightly crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The onions add a great contrast.
