I agree: too much vinegar. Start with 2 Tablespoons, then add more if you want.

Way too tangy (vinegar) . . tried adding more mayo and sugar but ended up throwing most of it out.

Delish! I skipped the bell pepper as I just didn't think it would be to my liking...it certianly wasn't missing it. It was perfect with out it.

A very fresh-tasting coleslaw. I used half of an onion and skipped the bell pepper. I also used only about 1/2 cup of mayonnaise, which was great for my tastes, as I love vinegar. Plus a little salt and pepper. Received good reviews!

ps --- just realized my review didn't make any sense unless I mention adding about 1/4-1/2 tsp salt to the recipe.

The best coleslaw I've ever tasted! Next time I'll salt it first and let it sit a little then drain before adding the mayo and vinegar, but otherwise wonderful! Oh, and I used a red pepper instead of green, just for color, and added cayenne as others suggested. (I don't think the vidalia onion hurt, either)

Kind of plain but it works...I added a teaspoon of mustard.

A bit of cayene made a big difference. I use this recipe all the time when we are having barbecue sandwiches. Goes great with the pulled pork in Gourmet (rip) magazine.

Good solid coleslaw recipe, but you have to make it the day before, or at least a few hours ahead.

This was quick and easy coleslaw. I added half a head of red cabbage along with the green, and used just a pinch of sugar (as I hate adding sugar to anything). Overall a good recipe for creamy coleslaw.

This was a good, basic recipe for coleslaw. It was a bit bland so I added some more vinegar/sugar/salt and it livened it up. Not a fancy coleslaw but nice for everyone.

Very good basic coleslaw. i omitted the green pepper.

This is my favorite colslaw recipe of all the recipes on this site and I've made many. It was perfect. I made as per the recipe. The only thing I did a little different is I added about 1/2 of a very small head of red cabbage to add color. The red bled a little so the resulting slaw was a little pinkish tinged. I imagine this is perfect without the red cabbage too.

I prepared this recipe as written, and followed the suggestion to make it a day ahead. BBBoring. I added more salt. I added celery seed. Finally, I added a bit of bottled Italian dressing. Maybe, I am just not a fan of creamy coleslaw. It's back to oil and vinegar based coleslaw for me.

Simple 'Go-To' recipe for basic mayo/cabbage cole slaw. Easy to adjust to flavors and tastes too. Add some grated purple cabbage, add shredded radishes, jicama, or whatever you have, even broccoli stalks added to this recipe are great. We like a touch of horseradish when we have it with pork dishes like grilled tenderloins, or loins, and we like it with cilantro and jicama added for mexican influences. Add some shredded granny smith apples for a wonderful touch! A few times, I have omitted the sugar, added sugar syrup crushed pineapple to the recipe, and oh boy was that good! Great foundational recipe! Great on it's own, or doctored up for your flavor interests!

Omitted the green pepper bc I didn't have it. Came out great. Will be making this again.

I was looking for a mayo based cole slaw that did not load up on calories. This is it. I used half the mayo recommended and it was plenty.

This is my new go to slaw for BBQ's. The vinegar and mayo balance nicely, so its not to sweet, but the vinegar isnt overpowering. I will say on the first day its just good-ok, this really needs to be prepared the night before to get the full effect.

Fantastic. Made this for Father's Day. Everyone loved it! This will be my go to recipe for coleslaw. I did not use any bell pepper and added a bit more sugar. Great with ribs. I plan to make this many more times this summer.

This is really easy to put together, and it tastes great. I added jicama since I had one available. Prep time drops down to 5 to 10 minutes if you use a food processor to shred the veggies.

Excellent ! Everyone loves this coleslaw...Just the right seasonings !

This coleslaw is great. It gets better when chilled overnight and continues to improve with age up to 3 or so days. The green bell pepper is what really made it. I ate more of the cole slaw than the pulled pork it went with!

Nice blend of flavors, I used Napa cabbage and regular green cabbage and chilled overnight but would use a sweeter onion next time. Only had red onion and that flavor has overpowered everything else...

Excellent but I think it needs to chill overnight for best results. This tasted heaps better the next day. Did not add the green pepper.

I made this recipe with all fresh ingredients from our local farmers' market- It went faster than the entree! It was the hit of the evening!

This is the real thing; and easy as can be. I put everything through the shredding disc of my food processor, so it is finished in mere seconds. Excellent as a side dish, and terrific on any sandwich to add flavor, texture, and crunch.

Loved this coleslaw recipe. I bought a package of preshredded cabbage and it was a snap to put togther. The dressing is perfect.

Looking for a slaw recipe that my 12 year old daughter would eat - she loves broccoli and Brussels sprouts so I thought that she should love cabbage - finally found this one. Simple to prepare and the whole family loved it.

Great coleslaw recipe! Usually there is plenty of colelsaw left at the end of parties, but when I made this, it was all gone. The balance of mayo to vinegar is perfect. I was worried it would be too mayonnaisey, but it wasn't at all. I did deviate a bit from the recipe and used shredded carrots, and no bell pepper.

Excellent! I finally got my fiance to eat coleslaw. He said it was the best he had ever had. We just ate it as a side dish, not as part of the pulled pork recipe. I will definitely make this again, especially if I have cabbage that needs to be used up.

Easy, quick, the perfect amount of mayo. This is fun because you can add more carrots if you like them, different colored bell peppers--whatever you want to do. This went quick at a dinner party I had. I used vegan mayo to cut calories and to make a bit healthier and no one could tell the difference.

I enjoyed this recipe, easy to make with really simple ingredients. I used only 3/4 of the dressing, and added more carrot and cabbage. I also added 2 granny smith apples which added a nice tartness. It keeps well in the fridge, I've been eating it for days now.

Delicious and easy to make. Like the addition of green pepper and there's a perfect tang. We thought this slaw was terrific with the N. Carolina Pulled Pork recipe and complimented that particular vinegary pork really well.

Rating: 3
This slaw does have a good sweet/tart balance and great color. I made this and 2 other coleslaws to try with the North Carolina Pulled Pork (also on this site). This slaw seemed to overwhelm the flavor of the pork unfortunately - I preferred the North Carolina slaw listed on the pork recipe with the pork. I would definitely make it again to serve at a BBQ just do not recommend serving it over pulled pok.

Good! I used a bigger cabbage than this called for (about 3 lb) and a red bell pepper because it's what I had on hand. I think it was good that there was more cabbage, because the dressing ended up not being too much. I actually made this as a side dish (rather than making it with the pork and serving it on the sandwich) and it's one of the better coleslaw recipes I've tried. Good stuff.
