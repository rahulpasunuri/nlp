These cookies are OK. They are crunchy, but hot particularly tasty. A better Passover cookie is Chocolate-Filled Almond Macaroons from this Web site. They are easier, less sensitive, and much tastier. I beat the egg whites for the pecan cookies til they were frothy, and the cookies spread out a bit, but not excessively. I used some of the chocolate filling leftover from the macaroons to make them into sandwich cookies to improve them. Will not make the pecan cookies again.

OK, so these aren't the prettiest cookies I've ever made. They do, however, taste good. I followed the recipe as written and only lightly beat the egg whites and they seem to have turned out the same way that those who beat the egg whites to soft peaks. Will see how quickly they are devoured by our guests.

How much you beat the egg whites is definitely crucial to this recipe, but it is not impossible to make. Beat them to peaks. I did not process the ingredients and simply mixed them all together, then put the egg whites into them and it worked out fine. I baked them on a silicon cookie sheet--maybe that helped. Will make this again for those who need yummy gluten-free desserts!

These are very good cookies, have been making them for a few years - I always beat them till a little past foamy and they come out tasting really good. Granted, they don't look so great, but my family just cares about how they taste

Delicious and addictive! I've had problems with these cookies running together and haven't figured out whether it's better to beat the egg whites a lot or a little. But as flat and ugly as these cookies are, they are the most delicious Passover dessert I've ever made.

I agree... there's something wrong with this recipe. I beat my egg whites pretty stiff, the cookies baked fine, but they have a strange consistancy. I'm not sure I will even serve them.

Pesach is the Hebrew word for Passover.

Dear GA, what is a Pesach dessert?

After making this and having it spread into one giant mess, I realized the eggwhites need to be beatedn to soft peaks. What a waste of expensive pecans.

I followed other's comments and only whipped the egg whites a little bit, no peaks or anything. While the cookies did spread some, I was pleased with the way they came out. My husband and 5 year old both loved the cookies and said they did not taste like a Pesach dessert at all

Great cookies! I beat the egg whites until they held a peak but were not stiff or dry. The batter spread but puffed up during baking. My husband always prefers something with chocolate, so I melted chocolate chips and made sandwich cookies with the melted chocolate in the middle. They were enjoyed by all.

There is something wrong with this recipe. I tried it twice and wasted all my ingredients. The batter spread into one big mess. After reading other reviews perhaps the egg whites need to be beaten until stiff. I hope you can advise.

These cookies are very good. I didn't have a problem with the consistency of the batter. I used the egg whites that come in a carton. I just whipped them with a wisk until they were frothy. Do not bake them for the time recommended, as you will end up with burnt cookies (which I did). For the second batch, I turned the oven down to 350 and baked them only 10 mins. You really have to watch them.

The first batch was so good that I immediately made a second batch. Whipping the egg whites to a greater or lesser degree made very little difference, but chopping the first cup of pecans coarsely keeps the texture interesting. Next time I'll chop them by hand.

Hi, I agree that these cookies taste great no matter how they look. originally thought that I hadn't beaten the egg whites enough but I had a little batter left over after the first batch and I made much smaller cookies i.e. a very level tablespoon. For some reason these cookies did not flatten out the way the larger ones did. I will definitely make them again.

An excellent choice for a passover cookie. I agree with the others that the consistency of the batter is runny and will whip the egg whites more next time. These will become a pesach regular

Ok, so I have now made these cookies 3 times. I have whipped the egg whites and only lightly beaten them. Either way had no impact. The trick to these cookies is the parchment paper. They are delicious no matter how they come out but the parchment paper causes the cookies to resist flattening. Also, watch your time, in my oven they only take 10 minutes and they are perfect.

Here it is, 24 hours before Passover, and, with high hopes, I gave this great-sounding recipe a whirl. All I can say is ditto to the previous 2 reviewers. The "batter" was thin and runny and so the cookies spread out into thin disks. Something's gotta be wrong. They do taste OK but - and here's where I differ with my predecessors - I won't make them again (unless Epicurious tells me what to do differently). It was just too big a waste of good pecans. Shame.

Same problem here. Egg whites should probably be beaten to soft peaks in order to make this come out right. The flavor was there but the consistence was disappointing. Will try again and work with the egg whites. Recipe should be more specific about what to do with the whites.

I clearly didn't understand the definition of "lightly beaten" egg whites and my cookies turned out to be flat discs. But my husband devoured them anyway because the flavor is so good. I will definitely try again to see if I can get the texture right.
