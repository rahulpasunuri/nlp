I had fresh green beans and fresh corn on the cob to use so tried this as a hot dish. It was awesome! Cooked the beans for four and a half minutes then added the corn for one more minute. Drained them together. Mixed the dressing as described and threw some fresh cherub tomatoes and red onion in with that and served it all together . . . warm! Similar to the corn and tomato scramble from this site. DELICIOUS!

Like others had suggested, I used frozen corn and added roasted tomatoes for color. I also used Grey Poupon coarse mustard and it turned out great! Add minced garlic for an extra layer of great flavor. Huge hit at my LOST finale party.

After reading the other reviews, I used this recipe as inspiration only. To the pototoes, green beans (regular size, not haricots verts) and a handful of blanched frozen corn kernels, I added thin slices of red onion, a few black olives and some drained capers. Then I added lots of freshly chopped mint and parsley. I tossed it with a viniagrette of 3 parts olive oil to one part red wine vinegar, no mustard (which didn't seem to go with the other things). The result was four+ forks, but I'm only giving three to the recipe because it would be bland and too oily without the changes. My husband absolutely adored my version and he's not normally a potato salad fan. I served it with grilled veal patties. Delish. Perfect for summer BBQ's with no mayo to spoil. Don't leave out the mint, it really made the whole dish.

I omit the potatoes and roast the corn rather than blanch it, but otherwise stick to the recipe. It's always a hit and makes a nice change from the usual salads served at cookouts.

Nice, although I have to admit I am not a huge potato salad fan, but this was a hit with my guests. I a mixture of the baby reds and the little white potatoes, added a little mayo to the dessing just for a touch of creaminess and added crumbled bacon, green onions and shallots to my dessing. Really check the seasoning on this one- make sure you use black pepper and adjust the salt. everyone loved it, and I have to say, I loved the corn- it added a nice sweetness to the mustardy potatoes!

I agree with the other reviewers-too much oil and it lacks that shot of color, so I took everyone's advice. I played with the dressing, added seeded, silvered tomatoes and finely chopped shallots, and served it on a bed of baby greens. Thanks to all!

I served this recipe at a luncheon yesterday and got rave reviews. I also added some cherry tomatoes, halved, and cut the oil in half. I used a coarse mustard that was much spicier than I thought, so had to add a bit of mayo to cut the spice a bit. It turned out great!

Very good salad. I served it on top of a bed of arugula which was great. Next time, I'll throw in some halved cherry tomatoes -- should be good. Definitely reduce the oil!

It does work better to slice the potatoes before boiling. They'll need less than 10 minutes to cook and will hold their shape better. I too used a combination of red and purple-skinned potatoes and it was lovely. I added a bit of rice wine vinegar to the oil and mustard dressing as my mustard was exceptionally strong. Frozen corn works fine and doesn't even need to be cooked. Just toss it right in. This is an altogether lovely salad and the perfect accompaniment to barbequed chicken or salmon. (And yes, the recipe calls for WAY too much olive oil. Cut by half.)

It was delicious. I used yukon gold potato, fresh green beans and frozen corn. The salad came out great and it became the main course! My husband and I loved it. We will certainly make it again and again.

With fresh beans, corn, potatoes this is a great summer dish. Only issue I have is the olive oil is way excessive, next thim I'll cut it to 1/3 cup and cut the vinegar to 4 tablespoons. But, the potential is there for a great repeat salad.

I am going to try this for company this weekend. Is the olive oil portion correct?

This delicious dish is a wonderful addition to any spring menu. Be sure to put the vinegar on the potaies right away, or they will dry out! YUM!!!
