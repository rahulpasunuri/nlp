LOVED this recipe. Had much more complex flavor than I expected from simple ingredients. I used less onion, more pepper flakes and 1/2 cup dry vermouth for the wine. Tasted great the first night and exceptional the next day.

I have to admit that I wasn't expecting much from this dish, but it looked quick, easy, and I had some bell peppers to use up so I gave it a try. I was very pleasantly suprised! The flavors are wonderful, and the sauce it makes is delicious! I added some poblano pepper for extra kick. I'm making it again tonight!

I thought this recipe was delicious and worth making again, but I was outvoted by my family. I really liked the sweet/spicy/garlic combo. My son and husband felt that the dish was okay, but not good enough to repeat. I had tried the Southwestern Lime Chicken with Ancho Chili Sauce (recipe from this website) earlier this week, and they felt that the Southwestern chicken dish was far, far superior.

Like others, I used thighs without the skin and excess fat. This is a tasty weeknight meal. I served it with some tiny new potatoes. A sprinkling of parsley over all adds color and flavor.

This recipe is great because it's so quick to prepare! I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and threw in some extra vegetables.

This was great. The peppers were sweet and tasty; the chrushed pepper was a great way to make it spicy and just enough. i would used minced garlic. The angel hair pasta was a great idea too.

Also added a little sun-dried tomatoes (in oil) 'cause I had to get rid of it. Didn't leave the skin on the chicken so I added a little butter when I added the red peppers and onions. Using 1/2 teaspoon of red chili flakes added enough heat without it being overwhelming. Also made the Angel Hair Pasta w/ Broccoli & Herb Butter. Boyfriend prefers the Chicken & Mushroom Marsala, but really like the pasta.

I used boneless/skinless chicken thighs, I pounded them between wax paper and then dredged them in flour. I used 3/4 cup of wine which, due to the flour, thickened nicely. Delightful results.

This is an easy family dinner which was quite good, but not spectacular. I added an extra clove of garlic and the half teaspoon of pepper flakes--but the spicy taste was only noticeable in the aftertaste. Next time I put in a little more. Also a little cornstarch helped thicken the sauce in the end.The wine nicely deglazed the carmelized chicken bits into the sauce. With red peppers on sale this is a nice dish. My wife loved it.
