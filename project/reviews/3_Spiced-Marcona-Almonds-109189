I love this, my new favorite snack. I used slivered almonds and it was amazing. Been putting them on salads as well.

Yum. Nice and crunchy but could use a tad more flavour/spice. Also used a silpat mat - they slid right off that but stuck together like crazy (although it wasn't a big deal to separate them).

I have been making this recipe time and time again for parties, holiday gifts, etc. Everyone who gets them raves about them. The only modifications I've made are to do a blend of almonds (not necessarily Marcona), cashews, pecans, and macadamia nuts. I usually roast each nut separately because they roast at different times (pecans, mac nuts and cashews roast faster than almonds). I also add a dash or two of cayenne pepper to give them a little more spice. You can modify the spices to match your tastes, using the egg whites and salt as your base recipe. Give it a try!!!!!

Besides being bland, 75% of the nuts stuck to the parchment. Nothing like peeling paper from two cups of nuts, one at a time. If you make this recipe, be sure to spray or oil the parchment first.

FYI: Trader Joe's carries these almonds--they are addicting!
