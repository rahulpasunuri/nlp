I think the problem people are having with this recipe is the fennel. If you don't like fennel, you probably will not like this. I liked it. The house smelled amazing during the cooking process. You might try crushing the fennel so you don't bite into whole fennel seeds.

This recipe was just so/so...perhaps it was because I'm not a big fan of fennel.

I made this for my family and they loved it.

I made it, we ate it, and it was just o.k. At least it was something different, but I wasn't impressed with the flavors...and won't be making it again. Oh well.

Not enough flavor.. and the chops weren't tender

Very good sauce. I used a 14 ounce can of broth, and 2 cups of pinot grigio, to make extra sauce. You will want more sauce. Next time, I will cut the onion in half, keep the fennel at the same amount. Would be delicious on chicken breast as well.

As it turns out, my husband and I are not fans of fennel seeds. However, the pan sauce was very tasty and I would make it again without the fennel seeds.

This is HOW I make pork chops. I usually add aorboro rice and carrots. It is trully a one of my favs!

I used whipping cream instead of the lemon juice (as suggested by another "reviewer") and also added a half teaspoon of fresh ground rosemary which mellowed out the fennell.

these pork chops turned out so juicy. The flavor was amazing. My boyfriend said the taste reminded him of "beer soup." I would use less fennel seeds next time.

Piquant is the right word to describe the outcome, and very good. I used lime juice in lieu of lemon juice. Be sure to use thin pork chops...thick ones seemed too much for the lightness of the sauce. Suggestions on what to serve with it?

Extremly dissapointed! First recipe I have not enjoyed on this web-site. Must be the Fennel!

Easy enough for quick weekday supper preparation! I added about 1/2 cup of whipping cream in place of the lemon juice and it was delicious.

MY BOYFRIEND AND I THOUGHT THAT THIS DISH WAS YUMMY. I AM NOT VERY SKILLED IN THE KITCHEN, AND I FOUND THE RECIPE EASY TO FOLLOW, AND I WAS HAPPY THAT IT TASTED GOOD WHEN I SERVED IT.

Fairly simple to make and very tasty. I think I substituted red wine or beer for white wine and it came out great. Piquant with the lemon and fennel, but not bitter at all. I reserved the sauce (since my wife is picky). She liked it even without.

I would highly recommend this dish to anyone who wants an easy recipe for pork chops with a zing. The kids even enjoyed it! I added a shot of pilsner and man did it accent the sauce! Enjoy

The only item I changed in this recipe was using a chopped red onion for the onion called for in the recipe. The chops were delicious and I would definitely make this again. I am surprised at those that tried this and did not like it. Perhaps they did not reduce the liquid at the end of the recipe enough.

I've made several recipes from this website and all have been wonderful except for this one. I followed the recipe exactly and it was extremely bitter. I will not make it again.

Sorry I'm the minority folks, but I just couldn't get this to taste good. I, too, used shallots instead of onions...maybe the fennel I used was too old or maybe we just don't like the flavor of fennel that much. Anyway, out of the last seven recipes I've pulled from Epicurious this is the only one that I've been disappointed with. Oh well!

I replaced the lemon juice for some wipping cream and it came out delicious. Thank you!

Substituted Old Bay Seasoning for the paprika, for a little extra zing. Worked well.

Great as well as quick and easy to make. I substituted shallots for the onions, omitted the lemon juice and added a bit of cream--it was a hit too!
