This is very tasty. I added more sherry vinegar and olive oil at the end to make it a bit "saucier" and served it over arugula and watercress. My garlic cloves were pretty brown and crispy after the roasting, but I chopped/mashed them up and mixed them into the dressing and they tasted great.

This is a great salad. I could eat it as a meal!

This salad is delicious and simple. The layers of flavours are wonderful and more pronounced than I expected. I used arugula instead of frisee and topped with cambozola. The cheese (obviously) added a creaminess that was a very nice compliment to the other flavours and textures, it also added some brightness to the plate. I can see this going into regular rotation because it is delicious and easy. I did expect more liquid after the roasting but in the end, it was enough and it wasn't overdressed.
