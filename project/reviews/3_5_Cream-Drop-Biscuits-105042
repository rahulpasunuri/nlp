Having no bread in the house, and no way to get to the supermarket (this marvelous DC snowstorm has us all hunkered down) and with heavy cream in the fridge I found this recipe. It couldn't be easier and the biscuits were delicious with a little butter and strawberry jam. I'm going to try this with the lower fat variations of sour cream and whipping cream (considering that I'm sure I ate more than one serving today). Addictive and so much easier than roll-out biscuits--although they're not as attractive and harder to split.

I would say that these are something of a cross between biscuits and scones. Quick and easy to make, so rich and yummy, I can skip the butter and enjoy just with jam.

I made these for the first time this week. I like them much better cold. They have a richer flavor that way. These biscuits aren't for filling with sausage or ham, but they are good.

Very rich-tasting, even cold--the flavor reminds me of Ritz Crackers. Tender and moist. I like biscuits that you don't have to roll out. I only used 1 tsp. of sugar but may make them sweet next time. They'd make great strawberry shortcake because the crumb is very tender.

This recipe worked well. I used an ice cream scoop to drop the biscuits, and sprinkled sesame seeds on top. It was easier than having to cut the shortening into the dry ingredients. They also reheated well in a 200 f oven.

Really Easy and they tasted great straight out the oven, tasted like a scone- however I will probably add more sugar next time as I would have liked them to be sweeter

I agree I like traditional biscuits with butter much better but these are faster to make. They are delicious with strawberry jam. I will continue to make them for ease and leave the normal biscuits for when I have more time.

Best biscuit recipe I've come across. It's perfect as is, if the dough is too runny/dry just add the heavy cream slowly until its right. The biscuits are soft and have a buttery yet light flavor.

Rating: 3
This is definitely quick and so easy to make but compared to cream scones which contain butter and less cream than this recipe, I think cream scones have a far superior taste. Nevertheless, this is a great instant, no mess recipe.

Yummy! I used half and half and the dough was too runny, so next time I will use less liquid. Turned out much more successfully than standard biscuits which are difficult here at 8300 ft.

Made these last minute for Easter Brunch and everyone wanted more to take home. Just as moist the second day. They're great with butter and topped with either jam or leftover Easter ham! They'd also be awesome with strawberries and whipped cream.

In a word, these were dumb. First time I've ever made biscuits and I guess I'm just not a biscuit kind of girl (and it wasn't a biscuit kind of crowd). They were tasty enough but what's the point? They're not quite a roll, not quite a pastry, just sort of unnecessary and they didn't get eaten. They were easy enough to make so it was no big waste of time, just a waste of ingredients.

Rating: 2
These were pretty easy/fast to make, however, it made me realize it is worth the effort to cut in the butter as with other recipes. I made one batch as directed, and another with green onion, shredded chedder, and cracked black pepper w/ a pinch of cayenne. My additions spiced it up, but then again they are not really breakfast "biscuits" at that point. So, it was quick, but don't expect the texture or taste of traditional butter biscuits.

Perfect for brunch or Sunday morning. My fiancee loves these just out of the oven with strawberry jam.

Excellent recipe! Easy and delicious...just like one review said, they are moist days later. I substituted sour cream for 1 of the cups of cream and it was great! Delicious with marmalade for high tea, too.

SO EASY. Served these with butter and poppyseed filling in place of jam. Delicious.

I made these a couple of times without changing/adding a thing. But, I thought they needed something extra so I threw in some fresh blueberries and sprinkled some cinnamon/nutmeg/cloves sugar prior to baking them. I serve them with cinnamon honey butter and get rave reviews. If by chance there some leftover, they taste great the next day and retain the same moist texture, unlike traditional baking powder biscuits.

What a great alternative to cutting in butter. These were very good and so easy to make I will surely make them again- maybe even tommorow.

These were very easy..very good. I replaced half the cream with buttermilk.

easy easy easy and deeeelicious! to make a LITTLE healthier, I substitued 1 cup whole wheat flour and used half & half, instead of cream. no hockey pucks!

These are great and much faster without having to deal with chopping butter. A note to the cook spending extra time on the stair master: if you use light whipping cream, these biscuits have a good bit less fat/calories than regular biscuits. I did, and they turned out great.

I love these biscuits!!!!!!! It takes all of my restraint not to make them every morning for breakfast. Give me a jar of really good jam and I could eat them every day for the rest of my life. They are simple and quick to prepare and are always a huge hit.

I make these biscuits all the time. They have a perfect texture and crumb. The only change I have ever made is that I usually pat the dough into a circle or square and cut them instead of dropping them.

I did not find this greasy at all. I used half and half instead of heavy cream. Yes they are heavy biscuits, but they went perfect with the creamed chicken and vegetables also on this site. The best part is that it is simple so you can throw it together in no time.

I took this recipe to South Africa to visit my in-laws -- they loved them and my sister-in-law is VERY fussy! Delicious!

I love this recipe..... I even bake the biscuits when we go camping! I mix them in a zippy bag, and just cut off a corner and squirt the dough onto the cookie sheet. Yummy!

I substituted the heavy cream with light cream so that may have been the difference since I found them very tasty and not greasy. I served them with fresh strawberries and jam for breakfast. You can also add diced ham & cheddar cheese for a brunch fare.

I used this recipe to make strawberry shortcake. Instead of dropping it into biscuit form, I greased a 8 inch round cake pan, patted in the dough, baked it until done. Then I slit the cake sideways, covered the bottom half with strawberries, put on the top half, covered that with whipped cream and decorated the top with some reserved whole berries. The juice from the berrries were absorbed by the biscuit and it was great.

The cook from the Northeast is right...they were too rich. However, just use half/half or cut the cream with milk. Perhaps cut the cream with fat free cream. If one TBSP of heavy cream as 5 grams of fat, how much fat is in 1 cup? ACK! 5/23/01 In defense of my post: a, I am not overweight nor do I watch what I eat. b, I make biscuits a lot, and these were greasy tasting. Great for a special occasion, not something I'd make regularly. Besides, butter and shortening, cut into self rising flour, sifted four times, handle dough gently and sparingly, make sure the dough is a little moist and flour your hands, place biscuits upside down in cake pan...all these are good tips for good biscuits. The butter and buttermilk flavor beats the blandness of the cream.

The biscuits were delicious paired with some fresh strawberries and hot herb tea. An indulgent treat. For those of you who thought these a little too decadent, here are some reference points for you. A KFC biscuit has 10 g. fat. A chocolate covered cake donut has 16 g. fat. These biscuits contain 14 g. fat each, so you see, they're no more indulgent than a couple of donuts. It would be interesting to see what you could get away with to lighten them up a bit. I'm sure both recipes would be remarkable! :-)

these are really good as for the people that think there too rich well they are not claiming to be fat free biscuts! if you lookin for healthy go some where else!! these are sinful and good!!

Even without any butter in the recipe, these biscuits seemed very greasy. And not in a "these are so rich but worth it" kind of way...just sort of gross. Maybe substituting regular milk for the cream might help...but I probably won't make these again. There are better epicurious recipes out there.

They were quick and easy for Sunday Breakfast. It was always "just one more" for everyone in the family.

I've used a similar recipe for 15 years. I always double the recipe because they get gobbled up so fast! You can decrease the cream to approximately 1 & 1/4 cups to make a firmer dough for cut biscuts. As for fat-free cream, what's the point?!

Rating: 0
I haven't tried it but I've become a great bisquit maker since I've moved south several years ago. I noticed that there is no shortening in the recipe probably because the fat needed is in the heavy cream. So for the "Cook from Orange County" I would say yes, you need the real thing.

Can you sub fat free cream? It's new at our grocery and I was wondering is anyone has tried it.

Awesome. Full of calories, but for a lazy Sunday morning, they were great dripping with butter and blackberry jam. Similar to the Bisquick buiscuits my mother used to make, but richer.
