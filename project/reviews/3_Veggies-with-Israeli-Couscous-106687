I used brussel sprouts and carrots for a great winter veggie meal (w/ a side of mashed sweet potatoes and crusty herb bread).

I used normal couscous and brocoli instead of zucchini! turned out pretty good!!

This was an excellent accompaniment to Spiced Matzo Stuffed Chicken Breasts. I think it would have been bland by itself. But the spices in the chicken blended well. Plus it was attractive on the plate. I also served grilled asparagus. Make sure you use the Israeli type of couscous.

To turn this into a main dish, I just added shrimp for a few minutes before I mixed in the couscous and it was delish! This will certainly go onto my summer menu.

I and my family really enjoyed this recipe. I like traditional couscous, but the family prefers the Israeli - so I'm always looking for tasty recipes. I *did* cook the couscous longer, though, than the recipe indicated - I'm all for al dente, but crunchy--not so much! Next time I make this, I'll make it with a roast chicken and roast the veggies.

Pretty bland. I'm also reminded that chicken broth is superior to veggie broth in almost all recipes.

To the cook from Toronto, the couscous is cooked before adding to the broth mixture. That's when it gets rinsed off. See ingredient list ("cooked Israeli couscous").

The key to this recipe is the garlic. You must use the amount specified -

why would one saute the couscous, add broth and then rinse under water? what an idea1!!! especially from a cookbook author.

I've made this a number of times for company...each time to rave reviews. The key is to use enough garlic !! Sounds like a lot in the recipe, but that's what makes the dish so tasty. A great side dish year round.

Blech! This might have worked better with regular couscous but there was no way the Isareli couscous was going to cook in that short amount of time. The vegetables were a good idea but overall it lacked flavour. I ended up using an emergency box of Near East couscous at the last minute!

Yum! This is very easy to throw together, very colorful and tasty. I did not rinse the couscous and the end product did not seem too starchy to me. I also subbed white wine for the broth, used one yellow squash and an orange bell pepper for the two zucchini and used less oil.
