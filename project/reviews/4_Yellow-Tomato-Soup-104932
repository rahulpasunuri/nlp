Delicious! I used a little more than 1/2 teaspoon chipotle powder, since I had it on hand, instead of the canned version. I also wanted it to be mild enough for the children. And I substituted Madeira for the Sherry, since I prefer the flavor. The flavors all came together wonderfully. The soup turned out flavorful, mild (not spicy), smoky, hearty, yet smooth and creamy. Beautiful color too! No leftovers!

Yummy soup. The bacon and spice really shown through. Of course you must only make this when tomatoes are at their peak so it's a summertime dish. I also think it would be good served cold.

This soup was delicious, different and addictive. The heat is so subtle and smoky that it sneaks up on you, but I couldn't stop wanting more.

WoW! what a great tasting tomato soup! I did follow the recommendations of other reviewers esp. artsyfartsy... I added more than the recommended chipoltle and tons of black pepper. I plan on making this again before my tomatoes give up for the season. I'm sure this will freeze well and be a wonderful winter time treat!

I agree with previous reviewers- more tomato & less broth. If you have the time, and want a creamier texture, concasse the tomatoes. For a dazzling presentation, top with fresh cilantro and some halved red grape tomatoes.

I read all the other reviews especially from artsyfartsy and incorporated more tomatoes, the garlic, less broth and added lots of Black pepper. I made it for a dinner party and everyone was licking the bowl and wanted the recipe! Pity the tomatoes are only available for a short time.

Best soup ever--made it exactly as is and is perfect. Also have frozen it and had it at Christmas as an extra special treat!

I rarely give 4 forks but this is a great recipe. I started growing yellow tomatoes so I could make this all summer. I substitute low fat sour cream for the cream in the recipe for a lower fat version.

Just wanted to update you all that this soup froze very well. I heated it up and added the cream. It tasted like summer even thought the yellow tomatoes in my garden are still green!

Okay, I should say how I changed things around a bit. I had more like 7-8 cups of tomatoes chopped up fresh from my garden, mostly yellow, a few red, that I drained overnight. I had no more cooking sherry or white wine so I used cooking burgundy wine, 3/4 cups, (we don't stock alcohol because we might just be tempted to drink it-- we don't drink-- and cooking wine isn't so tempting. I know, you shouldn't cook with wine you wouldn't drink. Whatever. Tasted great.) I used only 2 cups of chicken stock because 4 seemed like a huge amount once I was adding it. Good decision on my part as the tart/sweet taste of the yellow tomatoes really shined through. I also added a full cup of cream. MMMM!! SO good. I was out of fresh oregano and the grocery store had no fresh herbs (crazy). Oregano, basil, cilantro, all would have been great substitutions. I put in about a teaspoon of powdered chipotle. I could have standed it a little spicier but for most meek folks that I know this probably would have been perfect. Result: I am so sad that I'm out of fresh tomatoes. This was a stunning soup, so rustic and flavourful. Also, I like my soups a bit chunky so I just hand-pureed most of it, leaving some chunks. If you like watery soup, then by all means, add all the stock that it calls for. I really wouldn't recommend it.

Tomato soup perfection! I make this all summer while tomatos are in season. Now I'm going to try freezing it w/out the cream for winter. Hope it works!

This is the best tomato soup recipe I have ever made - I make it at least 2-3 times each "tomato season". The yellow tomatoes give it a tartness that is nicely balanced by the sweetness and smokiness of the other ingredients. I also substitute vegetarian ingredients without any negative impact on flavor.

This is the best tomato soup recipe I've found. I have made it several times exactly as written, and it has always been delicious - I wouldn't change a thing. The chipotles add such an interesting layer of flavor. The yellow tomatoes finally arrived at my farmer's market, so I'm making it this week!

Since the mid-'80s, my husband and I have been looking for a recipe that would replicate the best tomato soup we've ever eaten --- in an Italian restaurant in, of all places, West Berlin. Well, a modification of this soup comes close. I followed Kellydog's suggestion (21SEP02), omitting the bacon, chilpolte chilis, and oregano, but adding fresh basil. Additionally, I used ripe tomatos, since my garden is chock-full of them. I peeled and seeded the tomatos, then allowed them to drain for about an hour. (I began with four pounds of ripe tomatos, ended up with just over two pounds.) I'd suggest adding the sherry (I used cream sherry for its sweetness) at the end of the simmering period. Otherwise, its flavor seems to get lost.

My husband made me this soup for Valentines Day, and it was the best soup I've ever had! Go make this soup!

I have made this recipe twice now. Once as written which was excellent and once modified. I left out the bacon, used half and half instead of whipping cream and left out the chipoltes and topped it with fresh basil. Yum. It is a great way to use up the yellow tomatoes your friends are dumping off from their out of control gardens.

Makes a good pasta sauce if thick, topped with some dill and with grilled shrimp.

Very delicious soup! I made this as a starter before the broiled salmon, creamed spinach and spiced rice. The chilies certainly spiced it up, a note though, I did read all of the reviews and didn't watch the intake of the chipolte chilies, and I should have. I had many compliments though, spicy or not, we definately will make this again.

This is delicious and easy. Absolutely wonderful with a grilled cheese sandwich. The amount of chipotles is perfect in my opinion.

I give it an "A." I added cilantro on the top.

If you're looking for a flavorful tomato soup, this is a very good recipe. For those who prefer not to be overwhelmed by chilies, I recommend using half the chipotle that is recommended.

Easy to make and very tasty. I've made this several times for guests and always receive raves. Especially good with yellow tomatoes, although I have mixed some red tomatoes in when short on yellow with success.

This was a charming soup. Be careful with the Chipotle peppers. I made a half recipe but mistakenly added the whole amount of peppers. I usually like dishes spicier than the recipe calls for, but trust me, stick closely to the recipe on this one.
