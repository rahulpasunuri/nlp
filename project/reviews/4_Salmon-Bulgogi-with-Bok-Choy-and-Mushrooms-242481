I rarely make the same recipe twice, but I've made this several times. My recent twist is to put baby bok choy and some fresh shitakes directly in the baking dish with the salmon and sauce. Better flavor for the veggies and I don't have to clean the wok!

Absolutely delicious. Usually on the first try of a new recipe I prepare per the recipe but this time...I added more garlic to the marinade and let the salmon marinade for an hour. I used baby bok choy and once the stem is removed, they are the perfect size and no additional chopping is required..... Also added about a tablespoon of lemon juice to the bok choy and mushroom mix. Dinner guest for my New Years Eve party all wanted the recipe. The best ... Food was delicious, the presentation very attractive and this recipe is no fuss, tastes wonderful and the clean up is a breeze. A keeper. Next time, shall try with tenderloin steak and BBQ. This will be for a summer time dinner party and I will cook the bok choy on the BBQ as well.

This is my "go to" salmon recipe. My children love it for a quick weeknight dinner (minus the bok choy) and it is an easy company meal.

I maybe used a bit too much hot sauce (replaced chili-garlic sauce for sriacha, which I always have on hand), but this was quite good. My husband, who loves salmon, felt it overpowered the fish but he loves hot, so he was happy. I dislike salmon, so it worked very well for me. I'd make it again, maybe with less heat. I'll also think this might work well on wings.

I enjoyed this dish and the marinate/glaze. Trying to be a little healthier, I didn't saute the bok choy and shiitake in the oil. I put them in my bamboo steamer and after lightly sauteed with some o the leftover glaze. I didn't have chili-garlic sauce handy so used a little hoisin and sambal. I served with my quinoa fried "rice" and some kimchi. Delicious and somewhat easy dinner.

Rating: 4
Excellent combination of flavors. The only adjustment I made was to use peanut oil instead of olive oil to stir fry the bok choy and mushrooms. I also added some more "rice wine" (sake) to the remaining marinade before heating it to make the glaze.

Rating: 4
I love this marinade and the whole dish. I didn't have rice wine so I used rice vinegar with a dash of water. I also sauteed the veggies in sesame oil rather than extra virgin olive oil. It added enough flavor that the bok choy wasn't bland. I also "glazed" the bok choy before serving so that helped too.

My boyfriend made this with all the tweaks: more spice, sesame oil bok choy and salmon skin on--and I was blown away with the taste and accompaniments. You won't regret it.

I made this meal this evening and it is absolutely delicious. I followed the ingredient directions to the tee. Several reviews said the bok choy and mushrooms were bland.Vegetables should not over power the main ingredient;salmon.I must confees I did add a little sesime oil to the olive oil; perfect. The sauce was superb which we served over the brown rice which I had as a side and the salmon as a glaze. Will definitely make this again. So good and healthy.

An excellent way to make salmon or steelhead. I only gave it 3 stars as it seemed it needed some small tweeks, such as leaving the skin ON! Why would you roast fish in a sweet sauce with the potential for great caramelized salmon skin, and then take it off? Also, I added a little soy and oil to the greens and mushrooms for flavor.

Easy, fast, delicious. Made this as per the recipe many times and with other types of fish too. I've entertained with this recipe and used it as an easy week night dinner. Highly recommended.

This was fab! Substituted Rice vinegar (plus water and sugar) because I couldn't find rice wine. I also used sriracha in the place of the garlic chill sauce so I added one extra garlic clove . Otherwise, made as written. Loved this! YUM!

Very quick, easy, and delicious. I have made this a few times and agree with some other reviewers that the bok choi and mushrooms can turn out a little bland; I like to add a few dashes of soy and worcestershire sauce to them. Also, I add the white stems of the bok choi a few minutes before the green leaves. Otherwise, quick and delicious as called for.

My 11 year old daughter had a fear of me making salmon for dinner, but the way this salmon turned out was two thumbs up! I following the receipe exactly, with the exception that I added extra ginger to the marinade and extra garlic and soy sauce to the veggies. It came out perfect and I will definitely make this again! Enjoy!!

Rating: 4
Definitely a keeper. Super simple. A great dinner for working people that can be done in no time. I made the recipe as directed, except I added some extra garlic to both the marinade and the veggies. I just like extra garlic. I seasoned the veggies with a splash of soy sauce, as that seemed to make more sense to me in this dish versus salt and pepper. Yummy!

this was fantastic for a dinner party- made the marinade in advance and put it on a big filet of wild salmon for 30 minutes before guests arrived. put it in the oven for 10-12 minutes during appetizers. big winner! everyone loved it.

Wonderful!! I tweaked the marinade since I was missing some ingredients - used apple cider vinegar and splash of water and a bit more sugar for the rice wine; scallion ginger sauce instead of chili garlic. 8 minutes was perfect, the salmon was still a bit red in the thickest part. I thought the veggies were missing a kick. I'm excited to try this with the chili garlic sauce, it's so fast and easy! The marinade was strong but balances out perfectly with jasmine rice.

Overall quite good, but a bit salty. Will try using low-sodium soy sauce, or less soy sauce, next time. Vegetables don't have a ton of flavor but the fish was excellent.

I made this as a weeknight meal and not only was it easy, it was really good. I served it with brown rice and added a little heat and rice wine vinegar to the shitakes and bok choy. I will make this again and again. If the glaze gets a little thick when you are cooking it down, just add a little more sake. A new favorite for sure!!

This was a wonderful dish. Flavors are superb. I love bok choy and salmon so this was a great addition to my family of recipes. I have had the beef version but in my mind this beats it. Plus, it was simple to make.

Rating: 4
This is a huge favorite! Last time I made it I used a blend of dried shiitake mushroom (re-hydrated with boiling water) and sliced cremeni mushrooms, with spinach instead of bok choy, for the vegetable saute. In the past, I've also added a tablespoon or so of mirin to the marinade for extra flavor. I recommend doubling the marinade, as there isn't much to begin with and after you reduce what remains, there is hardly enough to glaze the fish. Great with green basmati rice (after cooking the rice, stir in enough chopped cilantro so the rice turns green and add a splash of rice vinegar) A nice side dish is "Beet and Carrot Salad with Coriander and Sesame Salt" from October 2010 Bon Appetit, served on a bed of mixed greens.

This meal would have been better with some rice to even out the strong flavors from the sauce. I think that next time, I will use less soy sauce and more Chili Garlic sauce because it was too salty and didn't really have much of a bite.

This was pretty good, but I felt the vegetables needed more seasoning. I liked the marinade quite a bit, and it's easy to make. Need to serve it with rice, or it's not enough food on its own to satisfy a hungry crowd.

Awesome recipe. Broiled the salmon on a broiler pan, just poured the sauce on top. Saved the rest of the sauce and stirred it into the veggies. Couldn't get any bok choy, so used asparagus instead. Fantastic flavor with wild salmon.

Rating: 3
This dish was great--my boyfriend even said it tasted like it could have come from a restaurant. I doubled the marinade and used part of it to saute with the veggies. I couldn't find chili- garlic sauce so I added fresh garlic and red pepper flakes to boost the flavor. I also had some clam juice and fish sauce in the fridge and added a little of both to mellow out the soy a little. We wound up making this 2 nights in a row because we liked it so much!

Rating: 4
YUM! This was soooo good. Really quick, really easy and even my extremely picky 9-year old gave it a 7 (and only cupcakes get 10s). The only modification I made was to pour the leftover marinade over the mushrooms and bok choy and let the whole mix braise while the salmon roasted.

Rating: 4
Very nice flavors are packed into this healthy dish. The mushrooms and bok choy are nice complements to the salmon. We also made basmati rice as a side which worked nicely. If you like to have extra sauce (for rice, other veggies, etc), I would recommend nearly doubling the sauce recipe.

This a delicious quick dinner. I marinated it about 20 minutes and cooked about 13 minutes. Yummy with a kick!

Rating: 4
Based on other reviewers' advice, I increased the amount of mushrooms and added sliced ginger to the oil before sauteeing the vegetables. I also put the garlic in before the vegetables and added a splash of low-sodium soy at the end. Since the recipe seems to dirty more dishes than necessary, I cooked the salmon in the baking dish it marinated in - is there a good reason to transfer it to a baking sheet? It met my "craveability test" and I'm already planning to make it again. This recipe is a definite keeper.

So I butchered the recipe to fit what I had on hand and overall I thought it was delicious. I used Chilean Sea Bass instead of Salmon. Used mirin instead of Chinese rice wine. I didn't have scallions or white onions so I used a mixture of onion powder and dried chives (they came in the new spice rack I got last week). Used lite soy instead of regular and I didn't have the saltiness issue at all. I marinated the large fillets for an hour and they were very flavorful. As for the veggies, I made spaghetti squash sauteed with the mushrooms and red onion to simulate sweet potato noodles and I sauteed the bok choy seperately with a splash of soy, sesame oil and garlic. I served with white rice on the side. My husband thought it was fantastic.

Rating: 2
For my tastes the sauce was too overpowering and too salty for the nice piece of salmon I used. It sounded interesting and cooked it per directions. Maybe using low sodium soy sauce would be better. I'll stick with Bulgogi short ribs instead. Veggies were good.

Rating: 4
I cook salmon a lot and I think this is the best I have ever made. I often make salmon and beef tenderloin when I am cooking for a crowd and this recipe is perfect because I can use the same hot oven for both. It was so easy while entertaining to just walk over and pop it in the oven. I made it with wasabi mashed potatoes and I had to use napa cabbage because my grocery store (which always has bok choy) was for some reason out of bok choy, but it was tasty and a good substitute. I will definitely make this again.

Rating: 3
Quite a nice quick dish! I used reduced sodium tamari and doubled the sauce. Had kale and portabellos on hand, so used those for the veggies (with extra garlic) - worked well, but will also make again with bok or yu choy and shiitakes or oyster mushrooms. Served with brown and white sticky rice. Baked the salmon in a cast iron pan and finished it in the broiler. Even my non-fish-fan husband finished his plate and said, "yummy".

I made extra of the marinade to use as a sauce, based on the raving reviews. It was so salty that I actually washed the cooked fish off and fed the family chicken nuggets instead.

Thought this was good. Cooked it in our toaster oven (convection) and it came out a bit dry. Should probably have stuck with the regular oven. Found the marinade a little saltier than I would have liked so will cut back on the soy sauce next time. I also tripled the amount of garlic in the veggies and used regular cremini mushrooms - veggies were yummy!

This is an delicious dish!! Very easy to make and rich in flavor. My family likes bold tastes so I added more garlic than for which the recipe called (4 cloves). The rest of the ingredients were bumped up in quantity, too, particularly the onions, ginger, and sugar. The cooking time is perfect. The bok shoy and shitake make a great subtle compliment to the spicy fish. I also made jasmin rice with rice seasoning added. Great recipe to prepare a nice meal for a large group with minimum effort.

I like it. Added some wine and sugar to the left over marinade to make a sweeter glaze.

Rating: 2
Although the salmon was tender and not dry, the recipe isn't a very exciting one. My marinade and glaze came out a little too thick and heavy for the fish. Preparation is quick and easy, but clean up is more difficult because the marinade tends to burn onto your cookware when baked at a high temperature. I'll probably make the bok choy with shitake mushrooms again since it's simple and tasty, but I'll probably use a different recipe for the salmon.

Me and the boyfriend love salmon and eat it at least twice every week. Before we found this recipe, it was just soy sauce, garlic, and green onions. I tried this tonight and the result was fantastic. My boyfriend wasn't very impressed but I'll be subbing this in for our usual recipe.

Not bad, but I didn't find it swoon-worthy. I wanted to give this recipe a chance as written, and at first didn't follow everyone's advice to amp up the veggies. Mistake! They were completely bland and tasteless, so I too ended up trying to salvage them by adding green onions, soy sauce and sesame oil. The fish was fine, but I think it would've been better cooked atop the stove than in the oven. I did like the sauce, and will use it on grilled salmon in the future.

This substitution for the real Bulgogi does not compare. The flavors are surprisingly bland. -Even after following the advice to pep-up the veggies with soy sauce and more garlic. Plus I added lime juice (it is what I had in my fridge), which didn't help very much. It was easy to make, but it was very boring in taste and texture. This is not a keeper.

Made this for company with wild caught salmon and baby bok choy cut in half lengthwise rather than cut crosswise as per the recipe. Cooked the salmon exactly as the recipe suggested and it came out just done with a rare center. Served it with sticky white rice. I seasoned the vegetables with a little sesame oil, soy sauce, and ginger as well as the garlic and pepper. This is an excellent meal, and simple to make.

Thought the salmon was very good. Cooked perfectly in just over 8 minutes in our oven. The flavor was awesome (my husband loved the level of spice). Not sure if I loved the bok choy/mushrooms. I agree they need a bit more flavor (I already added some soy sauce).

This gets four forks for being tasty, quick and healthy. I let the salmon marinate for at least an hour and thought the cooking time was perfect. Next time I make this, I will be sure to use reduced sodium soy sauce. It was a little salty for me but my husband had nothing but good things to say. I think keeping the veggies simple is key to enjoying the flavors of the sauce/salmon. An excellent way to enjoy bok choy fresh from the farmer's market!

Nice and easy, healthy and simple. It was pretty spicy so I was glad to have the bok choy and mushrooms to cool my mouth down. I would serve it with cold unfiltered sake. Doesn't keep well the next day but great straight out of the oven. I did make the marinade the night before and that did keep well.

This was delicious. I don't eat beef and so substituting salmon for the meat made it healthier as well. The sauce was excellent and I love bok choy. Added a little extra chili garlic sauce. Also, serve with a cooked egg as bulgogi is often served, but it wasn't necessary

I agree with the "four fork" ratings given by the 3 other reviewers. The dish was very simple to prepare, but full of flavor. I agree with "Portland" -- I used the caps from 2 3.5-oz cartons of shiitake mushrooms and thought the balance between the bok choy (18 oz. worth) and shiitake was perfect. I also agree with "Rocky River" that the vegetables were bland, but I thought it was a perfect foil for the flavorful salmon. As long as you like Asian flavors, you'll like this dish.

Excellent. Very tasty. My salmon fillets were 1.5 inch thick and grilled through in 8 min at 500'. I did let them set and sizzle on the stove top for an additional 2-3 minutes. For the marinade, I used Ketjap Mais (malaysian sweet soy sauce) and used half the sugar. I also used Sambal Oeleng which is the malay equivalaent of Garlic-Chili-Paste. Resulting mix was nice and spicy. Served with rice. Would double the amount of shiitake.

Made this dish last night - my husband loved it! I used a bit smaller salmon piece to balance the dish - 4-4.5 oz is more than enough. I would add a bit of soy to the bok choy mixture next time, as it needed a bit more flavor, especially for the shitakes, which were bland (I had the leftover bok choy the next day with soy and it was excellent).
