I have prepared this dish in one of the classes I took at the Art Institutes, it was amazing and has an incredibly addicting aroma. Charlie Trotter is one of my favorite Chefs. He is so talented.

I make this regularly because I am insane.

Anyone who has read other Trotter recipes knows they are in for a well earned treat. His meals are beautiful yet complicated.

My co worker and I were so completely exhausted after reading the entire recipe, we have decided to order pizza for lunch. Seriously, as a part time caterer, the recipe is not conducive to the untimely manner of preparation.

Isn't maple syrup boiled maple sap, and contrary to the raw food principle?

I would love to try this at a restaurant but the process involved in making this is over the top. Maybe in the future we might be able to buy the special cheeses that take so long to make.

This is a great recipe if you are really into the raw food movement and have alot of time to devote to this concept. The idea of eating "raw" food, for whatever reasons, seems to imply to many that the preparation of the recipe is quick and easy. It's quite the contrary. Just to prepare some of the ingrediants in this recipe takes days. The same is true of many other "raw" recipes I've tried. And while they are interesting and delicious and allegedly healthier for us, the idea of taking days to prepare rawmesan and the other ingreidants and then having them spoil in the fridge, unlike parmesan which can be kept for months, is not appealing to me. I love to cook and and am very open to new ideas and while I will likely make "raw" food recipes in the future the reality is that most of us just don't have the kind of time to devote to all the preparation. I don't have a personal chef , like many of the celebrity devotees; after a stressful day at the office I am the personal chef.

I am really into healthy foods. I tried to do the best I could with this recipe. Its just so involved and if I were to buy all the equiptment I'd be broke. The sauce came out Ok. I would like to see easier raw recipes that are simple, other than salad!!
