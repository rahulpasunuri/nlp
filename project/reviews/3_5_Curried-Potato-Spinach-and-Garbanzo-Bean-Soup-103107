This recipe is awesome! I sauteed 2 cups of onions, added a ton of curry, then stirred in caulifour to coat. I then added beer, 2 large Sawnson vegetable stock containers and 1 can of chicken stock. I added some lemongrass, coriader and ginger to the broth and kep tasting for flavor throughout the cooking process. I did not mash the chickpeas as the cauliflour cooked down into very small pieces. I served Mung bean sprous and fresh basil for garnish. My 8 year old daughter even likes it. That's the true test...when children like a gourmet dish you have prepared you know everyone will love it!

I made this twice. The first time, I thought it was okay, and agreed with other reviewers that it needed more spice. The second time - wow, it was delicious. I used a different type of curry - Muchi Curry from Whole Foods. It makes a lot of sense that the curry makes the dish, as the other ingredients have very mild flavor.

I read the reviews and added a few things. 1 Tbsp of chopped fresh ginger, dash of red pepper flakes, 1 tsp garam masala, dash of cayenne, and minced clove of garlic. It was a big hit.

This recipe is great, but I made a 2 modifications and double the recipe. I added a cup of water, the soup is pretty thick otherwise. I also used unsweetened almond milk, my wife and I use almond milk for other things. Coconut milk has a tendency to run right through you.

Really tasty! I made it with sweet potatoes, since that is what I had on hand. And I did add some Garam Masala and used some hot madras curry powder in place of some of the curry powder. These may have upped the flavor. I served it over brown rice for a great vegetarian dinner. Pretty easy and quick, too!

This is a great, super easy and very tasteful soup! I substituted the spinach with kale because that's what I had and it went well. I love a soup like this because it's easy, healthy, and makes the whole house smell amazing.

i try to stick to the original recipe, first time out, and found this to be too safe (read "boring"), although it grew on us as we ate it. more that we could see its potential as a quick, moderately healthy, vegetarian dish. the only change i made off the bat was adding white and red peppers for a little heat. looking forward to trying your suggestions of cumin and garam masala, plus i'm definitely going to add some roasted tomatoes for a savory edge this soap lacked.

Really enjoyed this recipe as is! Next time I will try adding some garam masala and cumin as recommended by other reviews. Great vegetarian option!

DELICIOUS! After reading the reviews I modified this only slightly. I doubled the recipe but left out one can of garbanzo beans so that it would be more soup and less stew. Also sauteed the onions and then put everything into the slow cooker. The coconut milk and curry were added later, more near the time I was planning on serving the soup. It turned out beautifully. I would add more spinach next time. Only because we love it.

Really good, really easy. I doubled the curry powder and added just a tiny bit of cayenne pepper. I also used light coconut milk and it was totally fine. Also, try the chickpea and cauliflower soup that's on here - it's pretty similar.

We were not impressed with this soup/curry. As written we found it bland and uninteresting - we would not make it again.

This is more a stew than a soup and as a vegetarian entree very good and filling! Not particularly unusual or impressive per say but very easy to make and adaptable.

Rating: 3
The soup was very thick- it was more like a stew or a topping for rice because it ate like a (heavy) meal. It was very salty too-- I'm not sure if that was because I overmeasured or what, but it was almost painfully so. The spinach worked great and mashing the chickpeas certainly contributed to the thicknes..

Rating: 3
I loved this recipe -- as other reviewers said, it is very forgiving and rewards creativity. Used lite coconut milk, new curry powder, added cumin and a pinch of cayenne. Was low on spinach and desired a very chunky stew so added about a cup of grape tomatoes, a cup of frozen peas, and extra potatoes. Came out thicker than a stew but delicious; serving over brown basmati rice yielded almost 4 servings. Easy, healthy, and yum!

Rating: 3
We used a mixture of our own chicken stock plus vegetable broth, which tasted great. I've noticed that chickpeas in the UK tend to have a thin skin on them. I will have the patience to remove these next time (it's easy to just squeeze them off, but time-consuming), as they don't mash and were not great floating around the soup.

This was delicious (and healthy)! I used a Madras Curry powder and like other reviewers suggested, I added a big dash of Garam Marsala and a tomato b/c i did not have any spinach in the house. My husband who is not a big fan of yellow curries, really enjoyed this, and I will be making this again.

This dish was VERY good. I didn't put in enough garbanzo beans since after I had already shopped for the food, I decided I was going to double it, but it was still really delicious with just adding two more potatoes! Also, it was very easy!

Rating: 3
Satisfying & fast weeknight fare - and it tastes much better than it looks! I used Madras curry powder and red creamer potatoes. I also doubled the recipe which made quite a bit, pleasing my vegetarian husband to no end. I agree with the previous reviewer: don't skimp on the onions if you double it. Also, a dash of garam masala at the end asserts itself nicely, and light coconut milk worked just fine. Served over basmati rice - this will go into my regular rotation.

I was expecting a soup, but what I got was a stew. That's ok because it tasted very good. Sprinkled some Indian snack (Doll Moth) on top for a little more flavor and some crunch.

Easy, tasty and versatile. I thought I had spinach but didn't so I threw tomatoes in instead. They provided a nice fruitiness which played well with the potatoes and garbanzo beans, so I think I might put them and spinach in next time.

Loved this soup! As I prepared to make it last night I found I had run out of curry powder, so I used garam masala, cumin, coriander, ground mustard, pepper and some hot chili flakes. The flavor was deep and rich, even with lite coconut milk. I like the mashed garbanzos, they added body (easy to mash in a shallow bowl). Also added some sliced mushrooms at the end. A quick and satisfying vegetarian meal, I will definitely try again with curry powder!

Rating: 2
This soup makes a good quick meal. We agree with other reviewers that you need to use a good quality curry powder and about twice as much as the recipe calls for. Sweet curry tastes better than hot curry, and if you like a little heat, you can add some cayenne. The soup also benefits from the addition of some extra cumin, garam masala and a dash of fish sauce. Light coconut milk works fine. Serving it over basmati rice improves the flavor and makes it very filling. If you double the recipe, don't skimp on the onion--use the full two cups.

Rating: 3
It's not a pretty soup, but it's very good and very quick. I also added a bit of garam masala at the end, as well as a squeeze of lime juice. I like the idea of not mashing the garbanzos, as that got a bit messy...

Rating: 3
The first time I made this is was very bland. Since then I have made it again and doubled the amt. of curry powder and added cumin and garam masala (1/2--1 T of each). I don't think it is necessary to mash the garbanzos. Add cumin and garam and this dish is delicious!

There are keepers and there are outstanding don't lose recipies. Don't lose this one. I used sweet potatoes and doubled the recipe using ; 1/2 lb of spinach (you could add more it melts down), chicken broth instead of vegetable (only 1 can for the doubled recipe)I prefer it to be thicker. I used pinto beans instead of garbanzo. Add the curry towards the last 10 minutes to your personal taste. I used 6 teaspoons for the doubled recipe. I can imagine that someone might not like curry, so don't use it. I think the recipe would still be good without it! Or try another spice-you got to get creative. Next time I will try cutting the coconut milk in 1/2 to cut the fat.

My boyfriend and I LOVE this recipe; it's a staple in the winter when we're in the mood for a hearty stew. It's so easy to make, and we were amazed at how good it tasted. Note: I add way more curry, a bit more spinach, and quite a bit of chicken bouillon paste ("Better Than Bouillon" brand - it rocks, a must have for any kitchen. Saves any recipe from bland-itude, avail on amazon).

I loved this! It could be spicier, so I'll experiment with curry paste in the future. I doubled the recipe, and it fed me for a week. What a great week it was!

This recipe is quite easy to get right (for people like me who need our recipes simple). I added a bay leaf and a bit more curry than the recipe called for. Found it a little bland to start off, but as somebody else mentioned, a little salt really helped to bring out the yummy vegetable flavors.

Used red curry paste instead of powder. Added some fish sauce. Served it w/naam. Too thick to be called soup. Was ok, but not that great.

Nice and healthy. Missing something as is...added raisins for another layer of flavor. Will try next time with fish sauce.

I modified this recipe by swapping leeks for onions and added mustard seeds. For those of you who thought this was blah, try again but increase your salt to bring out the veggie and curry flavors. Also wanted to point out that this is an EXCELLENT dish nutrition-wise, and a must-try for those preggers. Great folic acid sources!!!

this dish has become a staple in my household! with only minor adjustments to taste, i.e. adding twice as much curry (yummm!) and supplementing chicken stock make it very, very tasty indeed! turns out as a very thick stew by mashing 75% of garbanzo beans. in addition, adding pre-baked/seasoned tofu (found at many organic food stores, in many varieties) helps for a thicker consistency (if that is what you prefer). serving atop high quality basmati rice is, also, key. in my opinion this recipe is even better reheated the next day! and keeps well!

Rating: 3
I always serve this over brown basmati rice so it ends up more like a sauce than a soup. I use chicken rather than vegie stock since that's what I typically have in my cupboard and I mash all of the chickpeas, not just some of them. I've made it several times and like to take it to work for lunch. I'm not vegan but I like to collect recipes in case I have a vegan friend over and this one would work great.

Zesty and yummy, but then I love curries and soups in general. I would recommend it; indeed it is a great way to hide vegetables (although more for the kids than for the husband!).

I don't know. I didn't leave any in my plate, and it wasn't bad, but it wasn't as great as I had expected based on the reviews here. I opened a new container of curry, one that I'd never used before, so maybe that's it -- it might not be to my liking or something. I'll try it again with some other curry, but not really soon.

This is a great way to use up small bits of unused vegetables - I had Chinese pea pods, half a red pepper, and a small head of broccoli. I trimmed them all small and added to the soup, leaving out the spinach. I had to laugh at the comment of the woman who found it a good way to fool her husband into eating vegetables - so true! no matter how old they get, you still have to trick them into eating their veggies. This is a wonderful, quick, basic recipe that is easily altered, just keep the stock, the coconut milk (I doubled it), the garbanzo beans, and the curry, and it's a winner. I also added a dash of fish sauce and red curry paste - when husband tastes spicy, he forgets all about the absence of meat.

So simple and so good. I'm going to make it again this weekend!

This was fast and great. I would suspect failures are related to poor curry powder. Best of all there are a lot of ways to adopt this to whatever you have on hand...chicken, califlower, leftover rice instead of potatoes, mixed veggies tossed in...

This is a great soup, and I felt that the dish might easily be modified to make a tasty curry with rice instead of hearty soup. So, I left out the broth, added 1/2 tablespoon of soft granulated chicken soup base (Orrington Farms) to the mixture, used a whole can of light coconut milk instead of 1/2 cup, and a second can of garbanzo beans, mashed. I let it simmer for a bit longer and stirred frequently. It was soooo good with rice, a cucumber-yougurt salad, garlic nan and fresh juice. Very good. And a breeze to make.

This is an excellent recipe. Very tasty and very easy to make. I mashed more of the chick-peas for a thicker, heartier consistancy. This receipe is a must!

One of your best recipes ever, and almost as easy as opening a can of soup. As great as it is the first day, it's even better reheated. If I were entertaining, I'd make it a day in advance for that reason. I recently made it for my 86-year-old aunt who tries hard not to overenthuse. She couldn't control herself with this one.

Out of this world. My 2-year old daughter (with very developed tastebuds) said, Mommy you made delicious soup. Guests went wild and immediately logged on to this site. One tip: Taste as you season with curry because if you have a good curry you may use too much. I had a rather poor curry and used an entire spice bottle for 6 servings. And it was still not spicy enough. This recipe will become a winter favorite at our Sabbath table.

A delicious 30 minute meal. I'd recommend very good curry powder and to serve as suggested with pita, yogurt and chutney. I prefer thick soups so I took 1/3 of the mixture,pureed it, then added it back to the soup. Yummy. Even better the 2nd day too.

We loved this soup! I made a double batch, but didn't double the amount of garbanzo beans becuase I thought that would be alot of garbanzo beans. Next time, if I double it I will also reduce the curry somewhat as it seemed a little overpowering. The garbanzo beans got a little overcooked, so I suggest not adding them until the potatoes are at least half way done. Next time I will add the spinach leaves into the hot soup right before serving so they don't get too wilted. Great with rice or chunk chicken added to it.
