This was wonderful. Simple ingredients. Great flavors. Made as is, but instead of doing rounds, I only used one wrapper, put the same tsp of filling on one side, and folded over. The filling/making of the ravioli takes the most time, but set up an assembly line with the family and make it a family event. Tastes even better after that!

I made it by making fresh semolina pasta. I don't eat eggs, skipped it in the recipe and it turned out great. I also soaked the sage in really fine olive oil overnight, then filtered it. I think it was better than the butter. I highly recommend this recipe.

Make fresh pasta instead of the gyoza wrappers. I like this recipe because it easily freezes. I freeze on a cookie sheet first and transfer to zip lock. It makes for an easy and fast meal during the winter. We like it with a red sauce instead of butter.

This is great because the cheese does not overpower the chard. I used a mix of chard and spinach because I didn't have enough chard, maybe a total of 1 1/2 pounds. I did use the chard stems and added a rib of celery, slicing them finely and sauting them in olive oil. For seasoning I used basil, parsley, and 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg and cloves. That was my grandmother's secret. I also made my own pasta and tried to imitate her tomato sauce which cooks over 3 days. Everyone loved it and I think it is the best ravioli I have ever made.

I made this with fresh homemade pasta and it was fantastic. You could really taste the swiss chard -- it wasn't overwhelmed by cheese. I didn't make the sage butter but served it with tomato sauce.

I used zucchini from my garden instead of the Swiss chard. Shred it, squeeze out excess water, and saute it for a few minutes, mostly to let more water evaporate. I added some sauteed shallots to give it a bit more flavor. I also substituted feta cheese for the parmesian. The wonton wrappers worked out fine-- they didn't leak, but I followed all the other reviewers' advice about chilling in the refridgerator for at least one hour, and sealing tight. I served them with a small amount of tomato sauce, as my dinner companions were on a diet and the butter sauce would be too rich. Everyone loved them.

AMAZING!!! some of the best ravioli I have ever tasted. I made a few adjustments, as follows, and they turned out beautifully: 1) I doubled the amount of BOTH the cheeses. I felt the chard would be too overpowering without some more cheese to compliment, and I thought it had the perfect balance of cheese and chard. 2) I added more of both herbs, (1-1/2 t. thyme total and 1 t. rosemary)which was nice because the herbs really stood out without being overpowering. 3)I skipped the sage butter. While I thought it would be good, I didn't like the idea of dousing my ravioli in butter. SO, I made my own pasta sauce which complemented the ravioli marvelously: *2 lbs. (4 cups) roma tomatoes, quartered (I used skinned, canned whole tomatoes) *1 cup tomato sauce *1/2 cup chopped onion *2 cloves garlic, chopped *1 t. salt *1/2 t. red pepper flakes *1/2 t. sugar *1/4 cup olive oil combine above ingredients. Bake at 450* for 35-40 minutes, or until tomatoes have softened. Remove from oven, mash with potato masher.Stir in *1/4 cup fresh basil, chopped. 4) I used a 1/2 T. measuring spoon to fill the ravioli. I thought 1 t. of filling just wasn't enough... you could use a leveled tablespoon or two teaspoons of filling. I found that it is crucial to refrigerate the ravioli, as it hardens up slightly, and dries. I kept it in the fridge for about 1 hour, but it could easily go for longer. Also, it is important to make sure the ravioli are sealed tightly. I pushed out the air from the middle outwards, and sealed it with my fingers, then with the edge of a fork. I was pleased to find that none of them busted open durring cooking :) LOVELY RECIPE. WOULD MAKE IT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN!!

This is an excellent ravioli filling, although I found the sage butter to be a bit overpowering. I made my own pasta; heaping cup of flour plus two eggs into food processor, knead by hand for one minute wrap in plastic and let rest for 15-60 minutes. Delicious!

These are great. Every year my friends and I have a homemade pasta dinner on New Year's Eve. Each course is a different pasta. In 2008, this was the big winner of all the courses. Even the kids loved it. I accidentally discovered that cooking the butter sauce over low heat for a long time makes it much richer and more flavorful. The solids of the butter settle to the bottom of the pan and only the rich, herbed sauce is left. I also agree that homemade pasta is much better than a wonton wrapper.

I added some blue cheese and crushed wallnuts to this dish, and the result was delicious.

This was wonderful, but I made some changes, I added some thick-sliced bacon, and some beet greens to the recipe to give it some diversity of flavors. I think the bacon overpowered things slightly and would recommend Procutto instead. All in all I really do like the delicatness of this dish. I would recommend using Potsticker wrappers and making sure they seal tightly and then let them sit at least an hour before boiling so that they don't fall apart in the water. I also tried fat-free Ricotta, it had a pretty gritty consistacy...I would use a higher fat ricotta if I were to make these again.

I recently tried this recipe and my guests loved it. I used the goyza wrappers and it worked out very well. I did refrigerate the raviolis for two hours before I cooked them and not one of them fell apart!!

I have been making wonton-wrapped spinach feta ravioli for years, and thought I would try this very similar recipe... if you ask me, spinach (frozen chopped) and feta works far better. I didn't think the ricotta worked very well in a boiled ravioli.

Agree with the previous posters - I did a small batch test with the pot stickers and they weren't very good. So I buy sheets of fresh pasta, cut them in circles (approx 3"); put the filling in the centre and fold them over (with a bit of water to stick). Also, I add cream to the sauce for more body. I've also added little pieces of cooked shrimp into the mixture and garnished the dish with a few steamed shrimp people have raved.

The filling is good, but I did not care for the gyoza wrappers. I would not recommend cooking them for 4 minutes as the first batch I cooked simply fell apart in the boiling water. They only need about 30 seconds. Fresh pasta would be much better. Just okay.

'Found this recipe in order to use the chard in our garden; am lucky it was also so well-conceived. The filling is delicious. 'Didn't use the gyoza wrappers but got out the pasta machine and worked from scratch. Served this to friends for company and all were delighted.
