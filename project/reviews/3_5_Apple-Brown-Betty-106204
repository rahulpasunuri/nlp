I substituted apple cider for the water and doubled the amount, otherwise made this exactly as written. Excellent recipe, definitely would make again. I'd probably seal with aluminum foil before putting the lid on my casserole because I think the apples would have baked down better -- the ones on the top layer weren't baked as well as I'd like. Will probably add a little cinnamon next time, too, as my family really like cinnamon on apples.

I have been searching for this recipe for years. My grandmother made this when we were kids. Thanks for the memories

This was moist and not too sweet nor too tart: delicious! The lemon rind and nutmeg add a lot. It worked out perfectly, although I made the changes a previous reviewer suggested: that is, brown sugar instead of white, and twice as much water as the recipe called for (I used 8 Tbsp).

It was tasty but a little dry...next time I would use brown sugar and and a touch more water, perhaps...it's worth tweaking !!
