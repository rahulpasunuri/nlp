This was good. I served on warm tortilla but topped with sour cream & Monterey Jack.

One of my favorite summer recipes. I use less onion,,just because I don´t like onions very much.

This is a very good combination of flavors. I also enjoyed the fact that it is a healthy chicken salad alternative!

Tasty! And, very flexible. I added fresh peas and cucumber, and served it on a bed of spinach. You could throw practically any veggie in there and it would taste great. Definitely reduce the oil as suggested by other reviewers.

This has great flavors, but way too much oil. Next time I'll reduce the oil and increase the lime and cilantro.

I thought this was very good. The dressing is the key so don't be afraid to experiment with the ratios to get the taste you like best. I didn't seed the jalapeno. After all it is a spicy chicken salad and leaving the seeds in didn't seem to overly accent the spicy part.

Amazing! I was looking for something to do different with leftover grilled chicken breasts instead of so-so chix salad. Also added drained black beans & fresh avocado with a squeeze of lime juice. No more leftovers!

This was wonderful! I used a pound of (smoked) pulled chicken. I used half a red bell pepper and half a yellow bell pepper. Besides that, I followed the recipe exactly. I served the salad with (red) sun dried tomato flat bread tortilla. For what it's worth, I will probably use slightly less cilantro next time. My guest and I really enjoyed the meal. And I really enjoyed the leftovers in a "wrap" sandwich made with one of the flat bread tortillas the next day. Thank you once again, epicurious!

definitely use less oil. i am not such a huge fan of garlic so i thought it was a little overpowering--i will use less next time.

Wonderful stuff, I can't keep it around it gets eaten so fast - I had to limit servings to 1/2 cup to make sure there was some left for me. I second (third?) the recommendation to use 1/3 cup of oil (or less). This ain't your grandma's chicken salad. It's light, spicy, colorful, flavorful. Easy to make, too.

The dish was delicious with tortillas, although I cut the olive oil down to 1/3 cup.

the best chicken salad I've ever had. Loved it in a tortilla. Nice change for lunches.

Excellent! Not much to change but I am a bit confused about the nutrional analysis. According to a nutrion calculator I used, this dish weighs in at a hefty 430 calories and 37 grams of fat per serving. This has to be wrong, right???? Is it the olive oil? Any ideas would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

Wow! We loved this recipe. I didn't have a fresh jalapeno so I used a large chipolte pepper. I used yellow, green, and red bell peppers, so it was incredibly colorful. Oh, and I used super hot east Indian chili powder. I added shredded lettuce, and served it on warm tortillas. This will be a frequent lunch at our house. Didn't use the tomato wedges.

A great dish to make on a hot day--fast and easy, with lots of flavor. The leftovers really do make a wonderful sandwich filling.

I strongly disliked this, but it's just my personal taste.

This is very easy and very delicious!!! Perfect for summer lunches. I've made this several times and everyone has just raved about it. I usually serve this with warm tortillas and skip the lettuce, but my neighbor has rolled it up with lettuce in a tortilla and said it was delicious

This is a great dish for when you are short on time. Very easy to prepare, and very tasty!

The bright green and red vegetables in this recipe make a lovely presentation. It has proven to be a popular dish for casual entertaining or a work function. Quick, easy to make and very tasty. Can be made with or without the jalapenos. Rather than mixing the lettuce in, I like to serve it on a bed of romaine or red leaf lettuce.
