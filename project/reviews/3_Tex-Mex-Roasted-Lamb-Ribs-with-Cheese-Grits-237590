Amazing recipe. Although I agree, the grits are just an afterthought. Prepared my ribs with a mixture of tabasco and cherry pepper chile powders (home grown, dried, and ground), and otherwise as described in the recipe. Just amazing!

This is our first time with a Denver rack, and we loved it. I think the grits side dish is a complete afterthought. It really doesn't add anything and seems poorly matched to the lamb. Next time we make them, I wouldn't change a thing on the ribs, but I'll be hunting down a more interesting side to go with them.

I was looking for something to make with grits we got in South Caroliina and this was a hit! Used lamb chops (grilled) for a little more elegant presentation. For the marinade I put everything together - marmalade and a little less vinegar - did not bother making a separate glaze - just brushed with the marinade during grilling. Served with sauteed broccoli rabe - delicious - and the grits were fantastic!

Great smoky and slightly sweet flavor but not overly so like many BBQ recipes. Reheats well and the grits are good too. Add some sauteed greens and this is a great meal.

Made this recipe with a rack of lamb on a grill (total cooking time 50 min) and loved it! Easy to prepare ahead of time and cook on a work night

I was unable to find lamb ribs, but the recipe intrigued me so I tried it with a rack, adjusting cooking times, etc. The grits are fabulous and a new favorite. The preparation overwhelmed the lamb, and, while very tasty, it was not a great marriage. I think I will try this with a pork tenderloin next time, cutting way back on the oil and using the Island Pork Tenderloin method on this website, but with the spice mixture and glaze in this recipe. That may elevate the pork to the 4-fork rating...just seemed a waste of the lamb and the great marinade when put together. I sense there is a better way to do this.

This is a very interesting cut and you can get it from your local farmer. I have made it several time with great results.

This was not worth the time and effort. Very gamey.

I had never had lamb ribs before and when I saw them at the store I didn't know what I was going to do with them. They are very cheap. These are tasty, easy to prepare, and have a wonderful crust. I am making it again tonight
