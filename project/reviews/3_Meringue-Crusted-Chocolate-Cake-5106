I agree with some of the other posts in that the cake is too dry. Next time I will cook the cake batter solo for about 30 mins then take it out of the oven and add the meringue to the top of the cake and cook for an additional 30-40 mins. The problem when you put the meringue in with the cake in the beginning and cook for over an hr is that the meringue shrivels up and the cake ends up being too dry. PS: I substituted soymilk for buttermilk and used soy-butter to make this lactose-free. I do this with all my recipes and they all turn out great. If you want to try non-lactose just ensure you use a good soy butter not a yucky margerine (Willow run or Earth Balance are both good for baking).

I did have to bake it an extra twelve minutes for the center to set. Could have been due to our altitude. I always bake a chocolate cake for a friend when he returns. He loved it as did my family - It is a keeper!

I'm writing this review long after I made the cake, but it was a real show-stopper. Yes, it took some work, and I was scared it would fall apart; but, it presently beautifully. As always, I used "fake eggs", light margarine, and non-fat buttermilk, and it came out great and somewhat heart-healthier.

I made this cake twice this week.The first time I followed the recipe and the cake looked beautiful but was a little dry. The second time I made the meringue and then filled it with my favorite cake mix chocolate cake doctored up with mayonaise. It was incredibly dark, moist and rich and drew raves. By the way both cakes cut perfectly with a sharp knife. If you use the cake mix, it bakes in 85 mins so doesn't dry out

This is a beautiful cake. It is very moist, and if you warm the knife before cutting, the meringue cuts smoothly. I have also used raspberry flavored chocolate chips for even better flavor.

I have made this dessert several times for dinner parties because it looks so dramatic. My only complaint is the cake itself is too dry. The choc chips save it from being completly dry. I usually serve this w/a raspberry sauce or ice cream to combat the dryness. Thats why I give it 2 forks. In appearance it gets 4 forks...but lets face it...taste is what counts!!!

This is my favorite. I've made a few times for guests and it was always well received. Looks great with little effort, just be sure to use good cocoa.

Took almost 2 hours - not 1 1/4 (and I have an excellent oven). Extremely SWEET. Heavy - meringue cracked. Picture (I have it from the magazine) looks beautiful, but merinque cracked from cooking too long - So disappointing!!!!!!

I've made this cake many times with great success. It not only looks fabulous, but tastes great and is super easy to make. (Only Elodie's Chocolate Cake is easier.) I like to increase the cocoa to 3/4 c. for a richer chocolate taste. And if you slice slowly with a really sharp knife, the crumbling of the meringue is minimal.

I read the reviews of others so I tried a different meringue recipe. I used the lemon meringue recipe and I baked the cake about halfway and then topped it with meringue,and then baked it all the way. It came out great!

Although it looks nice, it was a disappointment when the meringue crumbled when cut...very messy. Also, it took almost two hours to cook... at 1 hr. 15 min. the batter was not even firming up. The tast was plain, not very spectacular.

This is the easiest idiot proof cake ever and great for a chocolate fix, it is both delicious and decadent. I would not serve it at a dinner party because it does crumble when you cut into it.

Not a very impressive turnout from this recipe. I thought it would be a great tasting dessert, but I was wrong! It was average.

very elegant-looking cake, really made up in a jiffy

Added chocolate chips push the richness content of this cake way past the emergency mark. And that says a lot coming from me. Also, while the meringue looks nice fresh out of the oven, it crumbles into a mess with the slice of a knife.
