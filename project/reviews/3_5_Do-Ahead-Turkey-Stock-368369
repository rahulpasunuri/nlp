I have a culinary background and think this is a great way to create a roasted stock. I however place turkey wings directly on roasting pan and roast at 425F, roast convection setting on the oven. I then used water after roasting to deglaze the pan for a rich roasted stock. I do not roast veggies with wings, but add them to the stock pot when making the stock. I do the same with chicken wings for chicken stock. Enjoy!

I love this recipe for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that it allows me to get a jump on the gravy. Agree with the other review that a lower, slower roasting of the wings can deepen their color.

I was disappointed with this recipe. The roasting temp as stated was too high and the drippings burned. If you want to save the drippings (and who doesn't?) roast at 375. Roast the turkey parts longer than stated until they reach a mahogany color or the gravy not be rich and dark. Same with the roux. The "cafe au lait" color indicated in the recipe isn't dark enough, in my opinion. I've puzzled this out now and with the above changes I'd make it again. Getting the gravy done in advance is worth it. This recipe, however doesn't hit the mark.
