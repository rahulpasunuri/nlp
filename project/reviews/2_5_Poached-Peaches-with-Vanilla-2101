I like this recipe a lot. It's simple and it gently enhances the flavour of good peaches without overpowering them. I just serve it with thick cream. I used dry white wine (a good Aussie chardonnay)instead of semi sweet, which I think might have made the flavour less bland.

This recipe was o.k., but nothing fab as I was expecting. Kind of bland; but would be good with cinnamon ice cream! I would spice up the poaching liquid to add a little excitement...
