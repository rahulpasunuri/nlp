Unlike a lot of the reviewers, I made this exactly as written. It was very good! Why do people review recipes that they don't follow? Try it first as written,review it, THEN change it to your liking.

This was really good! For the liquid I used 2 cups of whole milk and 2 cups of shrimp stock. I omitted the bacon and doubled the red pepper flakes & potatoes. I might try it again just using a fish stock & maybe canned tomatoes to make it lighter.

Made this for a weeknight meal. Stuck pretty much to the recipe, except used 1% milk, 10% cream, and more corn and salmon. It was outstanding. My husband is not a big fish lover, and he was over the moon.

Rating: 4
I forgot to add - I actually used 4 cups 2% milk and 1 cup heavy cream. I may have used more potatoes than it called for - I didn't measure. I used probably 3 medium Yukon Gold potatoes. Next time I'll add more corn too.

This was really good. I made it exactly as written, although I cooked up more bacon (12 oz.), and I forgot the lemon juice and salt and pepper, so we just added salt and pepper at the table. After reading other reviews, I'm kindof glad I didn't add the lemon juice, because it was still great without it. I used frozen corn and wild Alaskan salmon. Next time I might take the salmon out after it is cooked through, and let it sit on the side so that it does not continue to cook in the pot. I couldn't find chives, but there were plenty of scallions and good flavor from the red pepper. Might also top with chopped parsley next time.

I made this (finally) last night. It is fantastic. We loved the bit of heat from the peppers, although I may have added slightly more than called for as I do not measure. We especially enjoyed the crisp pop and touch of sweetness the corn added. This dish is comforting and flavorful. I would not hesitate to serve it to company.

I made this recipe with canned AK salmon, and got rave reviews from my boyfriend. Didn't have enough scallions but the garlic and red pepper flakes made it plenty tasty. I used dried thyme; next time I will try fresh. Delicious!

This is very good. I used fish stock instead of the milk. Don't care for clam juice...probably because I am allergic to mollusks. I have found Kitchen Magic brand to be very satisfactory,

This was fantastic! I accidentally added too much red pepper flakes but to our delight the spice was just right! I added celery & used wild caught red salmon. Make sure to use that fresh thyme - makes a difference!

So tasty! I used freshly caught salmon (of the Puget Sound variety) that had been grilled the previous night (i.e. pre-cooked) (I wonder if the flavor from the grill helped add flavor to the final product. Food for thought). I followed the recipe verbatim with two exceptions: 1) I only had about a cup of chopped scallions, so I made do, and 2) because the creamy "broth" was still relatively thin after the recommended cooking time, I let the chowder simmer for an additional 15 minutes or so. I loved it, but also like one reviewers idea of adding a smoked salt to the recipe, and I might double the amount of red chile flakes. Other than that, fabulous!

This was very nice & light but when I tasted it before serving, I found it a little bland. I added a small bottle of clam juice and some smoked salt and that helped considerably. I used half-and-half instead of milk and cream (as I had a quart of half & half in the fridge), maybe that made it blander. Will definitely make again!

It's hard to review this, because I made so many changes. It was tasty, though a little thin. I dropped the scallions to 1 cup. I added shallots, leeks, 1 carrot, and 1 rib of celery with the corn & scallions. Cooked perfectly. I didn't add any lemon juice, but meant to add lemon zest since others complained of curdling. Also dropped fat by using 2/3 cup cream, 1 3/4 cup lowfat, 1 1/4 cup whole milk. Still creamy, but not over-rich. Even with bacon, it needed extra salt. Partially blended to thicken. If I had more time, I would have let it reduce a bit. Even my two year old loved it!

A great go-to recipe and easy to make. I've made it following the recipe and made it with more milk, cream, potatoes and corn. This would be great also if you quartered a habanero pepper to steep in the soup and pulled it out before serving. Nice heat without the burn.

I love how simple this recipe is. For those who are worried about the fat - I make mine with fat free half and half and it tastes delicious.

I was having a themed party to watch the Opening Ceremonies of the Olympics, and this recipe seemed like a perfect choice for Pacific Northwest cuisine. I wanted a smoked salmon flavor so I bought a 4 oz. chunk of smoked salmon, chopped it in a blender, and added it to the chowder along with the salmon fillet. It was wonderful; I will make this again often!

Blah. This chowder tasted more like vegetable soup with chunks of salmon. I tried another salmon chowder recipe from the Epicurious website that was much better - salmon with leeks and clam juice.

Rating: 3
This was a delicious chowder. I made several changes. 1. I used 1 bunch of scallions, and 1 onion 2. My husband doesn't eat bacon, so I used smoked salmon instead of fresh for the smoky flavor 3. Instead of the bacon fat, I used butter to saute the scallions etc 4. I wanted it to be a one-pot dish, so I put the raw chopped potatoes, along with two small chopped carrots in after sauteing the scallions, and then added a cup of stock, and then simmered for 10 minutes, before adding the milk. I think it might be even better the next day, but we are freezing the leftovers.

Great recipe! I grilled the salmon first. It is so easy to remove the meat from the bones and skin. It is easy to expand this recipe by adding a bit more of each ingredient. Everyone liked it, even the fussy eater.

ohmygosh. I followed this recipe exactly, substituting smoked salmon. It's very easy to make and is elegant and delicious. I served it in my cafe and had people coming back days in a row to eat it before I moved on to a new menu. I will always pull this recipe out when I want to serve something special.

Really yummy and comes together quickly! Based on other reviews, I added some frozen corn, a dash of cayenne, and pureed the soup somewhat (leaving it still a bit chunky) before adding the salmon. I also used canned salmon - I'm sure smoked would be even better, but this was what I had on hand. Would love to try this with lobster!

It was easy, simple, and delicious. I liked that it was light. I think that if you boil milk vigorously it will separate. The recipe says to bring it just to a boil. Hope that helps.

I had bought the spine of a salmon at a Chinatown market and was wondering what to do with it and this was the perfect fit. I don't eat red pepper so omitted it and the bay leaf as I find bay leaves make soup bitter more often then they make them good. We had some friends over and I had also made string beans and my much loved chicken but all anyone could talk about was this soup. It was light despite the cream and milk

Can you make any of the chowder recipes with canned salmon?

My husband and I loved this recipe! All of the fat negates the health benefits of fish somewhat, but it was too good to care. I chopped the off and discarded the fat on a whole pound of bacon, then used the meaty remainder for the soup. I also added some diced red bell pepper ( about half of a large one), and skipped the lemon juice. One of the best soups we have ever had (along with the chilled asparagus soup with timbale of crab, avacado, and caviar, also on this site).

Rating: 3
Great dish. I did not add all the scallions. I just used 1 cup instead of 2. I had to adjust the amount of liquid and add more than the recommended. One dish was plenty. I used white pepper instead of black pepper.

This was amazing! I don't eat land animals, so I left out the bacon, and it was delicious without it! I used a little black smoked sea salt to replace the smoky salty bacon flavor.

Did anyone else have a problem with curdling when adding the lemon juice? For a moment I thought I was making salmon chowder paneer! Otherwise, a good solid recipe. Next time I'll leave out the lemon juice.

I make this recipe all the time and it's a huge hit with anyone who I serve it to. Sometimes I use smoked salmon (my smoked salmon is very salty and works well with this soup) and I always add lots of red pepper flakes, way more than the recipe calls for.

This soup was very tasty & easy to make. I made a few changes; 1 cup of the scallions and 1 cup leeks and 2% instead of whole milk. I used 1 pound of wild salmon since it was all I had & it turned out fine. A keeper recipe for company!

easy and fantastic, huge hit with guests. i skipped the bacon and didn't miss a thing. i also substituted yams for the potatoes and it was amazing! incredible flavor here, and a fun recipe to play around with.

Used light cream and skim milk, and added a half a jar of capers. Reduced salt because of the capers. Added king crab leg meat that I had to take with an order of meat. Made a not-worth-eating hunk of over-rated crustacean, very useful. Added nice rich notes to the soup. All together decadent.

Rating: 4
This was a delicious soup! My whole family said it was one of the best soups I have ever made. My only change was to use golden potatoes vs new potatoes. These potatoes gave it an extra creaminess that I think it could have used since there are no thickeners in this recipe at all. Despite the whole milk and cream,the soup was not heavy and the fresh thyme and red pepper gave it a extra burst of flavor.

Rating: 1
This was bland. That's about all there is to say. I followed the recipe except that I used all whole milk and I used shallots instead of scallions, neither of which should have led to a bland soup. There was nothing to give it flavor except the bacon and salmon, and the bacon got soft again instead of staying crispy and the salmon just tasted milky and dull.

Relatively easy to make and didn't take all day. Made the house smell great and was a nice change from the regular clam chowder I'm used to. Paired well with a nice crusty sourdough baguette.

Used fresh caught Lake Michigan Salmon and applewood smoked bacon. The cream and whole milk give the soup a richness but it was not heavy. Served with a crusty roll and a nice white wine.

Very good summer dinner with a salad and bread. Used less bacon, no cream, all whole milk and it was delicious.

My rating is 3 1/2 forks, for an easy, delicious and deeply satisfying meal. I used thawed frozen wild salmon and dried thyme (about 1/4 the called for amount fresh). I also used 2% milk, as it was what I had on-hand, but as the volume was short of 3 cups, I added the full cup of heavy cream. This was my first chowder, and based on the results, it will definitely not be my last. A definite make-again...

Rating: 4
Mmm. I substituted chopped Canadian bacon for regular bacon, and skim and half and half instead of whole milk and cream, for lack of the ingredients true to the recipe. I also added a big splash of sherry while cooking the vegetables and a cube of fish bullion. I will make this recipe a thousand more times.

Rating: 4
Easy and delicious. I used 1 can of corn (drained) and increased the bay leaves to 2. Also used less bacon. I used 2 salmon steaks (frozen); removing skins and cut into large chunks. Skipped the lemon juice. Will definitely keep this receipe as a fam favorite.

I love this recipe! I've made it three times: the first time I followed the recipe exactly. The second time I used one instead of one and a half pounds of salmon and thought it was better. The third time I substituted a pound of lump crab meat for the salmon and it was fabulous. Guests loved it, even a nine year old boy! This is a fairly simple recipe that it is easy to modify.

Great chowder! I was really impressed with how well it turned out. Changes I made - I sauteed a large shallot along with the scallions and garlic and added a little fresh dill at the end. Reserved a little bacon for a garnish. I thought it was very restauranty. Served it with crusty garlic bread for dipping.

What was truly exceptional about this recipe was its adaptability. I did not have all of the ingredients to hand - the amount of salmon was insufficient (uncooked trimmings from a Saturday extravaganza), no whole milk - only skimmed, only canned corn, creme fraiche instead of cream, and leaks were available but not scallions. The chowder adapted beautifully to these substitutions. This is a keeper as a "rule of thumb" chowder now that I know I can have my way with it. I also had dill on hand and no chives. It was still an exceptional dish - worth memorizing and then playing with. I partially carmelized the leaks in the bacon fat while the potatoes were cooking which also added a great depth of flavor. The family loved the dish.

I put prosciutto to use in this recipe in place of bacon (gently sauted) and it was great. Recipe cut in half is perfect for two w/o leftovers. With a sandwich makes a super light meal.

This was a very good chowder. I did not use the cream, just whole milk and I added some chopped carrots, leeks and a can of minced clams for extra flavor. Tasted like an excellent salmon chowder I once had in Alaska.
