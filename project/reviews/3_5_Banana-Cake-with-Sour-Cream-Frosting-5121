I made a 9" two-layer cake using the same amount of batter split between the pans. I doubled the icing amount and spread only on top and between layers. Next time I would use 1 1/2 times the amount of icing instead of double. The icing is not for everyone if you don't like a sour taste. The cake was lighter than banana bread.

Oh my...this is so easy to make and so delicious! My modifications are based on a previous review - I split this in to two 9" cake pans and frosted with chocolate butter cream icing (recipe from a Ghiradelli natural unsweetened cocoa can). And the idea started with a bunch of overly ripe bananas sitting on my counter - yum!

I made a few modifications and used a different frosting recipe, but this has got to be the best banana cake I've ever eaten. My husband said it was restaurant quality! I actually messed up on the sour cream amount, not realizing that half of it was supposed to go in the frosting! Plus, I was out of sour cream, so I used about half cup sour cream and half cup and a dollop of really thin plain yogurt. (I thought 1.5c was a bit much.) Also, we really can't stand overly sweet cake (can't eat the ones in the grocery store bakery - YUCK!), so I only used a cup of sugar (unbleached). Also, I used about 3/4 t. walnut oil. (Kellington, you aren't SUPPOSED TO melt the butter, but, instead, cream it with your sugar, then your eggs.) After the time called in the recipe, the cake was ready to take out. (I attempted to make a sweetened condensed milk nut frosting - but didn't thicken it by heating before I stuck it on the cake and baked(!) it for a few minutes. However, it made a delightful glaze with nut topping that seemed to really complement the cake.) The cake itself was light, buttery, moist, and very banana-y. I thought I would miss vanilla, but did not - even though I couldn't detect even a hint of lemon. This was a cake's cake - an excellent and light alternative to heavy banana bread or banana muffins. Now just to get that frosting perfect (and will most likely try the sour cream frosting at least once since we're diehard cream cheese frosting fans - and use a sour cream / sugar with pie filling topping for the in-the-box cherry chip cake mix)!

mmmm,yum! I don't generally give four forks, but based on the ease:outcome ration, I think it merits it. I'm in France, so I had to make a ton of exceptions and it still came out delicious. No baking soda or powder. Cassonade instead of sugar, greek yogurt instead of sour cream. I'm more of a cook than a baker, and I didn't pay enough attention to the recipe nor remembered to separate the dry ingredients or not melt the butter. STILL it came out great. It was a way to use up old bananas, and quite a success. I am going to try the frozen idea next time I need to make something with bananas, but don't have an immediate use for a cake.

It's raity for me to make something sweet but I thought this would make good use of some black bananas and sour cream. The recipe was easy and I will definitely make the frosting again -- loved dthe tart flavor. The cake came out very heavy and thin. It took twice as long to bake as the recipe called for. Probably won't make this again.

I made this cake for a birthday for someone who loves banana bread. She loved it and so did the other people who had some. I, on the other hand, thought it was just o.k. - not wonderful. I wasn't a fan of the icing and thought that it could use some chocolate.

I made this cake and it was very good. It was very nice and moist with good banana flavor. I made substitutions to lower calories and make it more healthy. Worked fine. I substituted 1/2 cup Splenda for one half cup of the sugar. I also substituted 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour for 1/2 cup of the regular flour. I used light sour cream and substituted Smart Balance omega 3 spread for 1/2 of the butter. I used a bundt pan and cooked for about 45/50 minutes. I used my favorite chocolate glaze instead of the frosting: mix 1/4 cup cocoa powder with 1 cup confectioners sugar. Melt 1/2 stick of margarine with 2 Tabs. water. Pour into the cocoa mix. Pour over cake. It was a great combo.

I have made this recipe exactly as is before, and it is wonderful. However, I have developed/discovered an allergy to dairy from cow's milk, so baking has become a little more challenging. I just made this cake with coconut oil instead of butter and goat's milk yoghurt instead of the sour cream. It is absolutely delicious. Apart from it's tremendous health benefits, the coconut oil even adds a little something extra. Use it cool so that it has more of a soft butter texture. Thought this might be of use to others encountering the same problems.

I'm giving this four forks because I've discovered the recipe's truly decadent potential. Divide the batter (to which I added a dash of vanilla) between two nine inch round cake pans and bake five to ten minutes less. Just check it with a toothpick. Then build yourself a layer cake with your favorite chocolate frosting. I use the "fool-proof" recipe from Cook's Illustrated. The result is out of this world. You might then call it... Banana Split Layer Cake?

This was excellent. I made it for a pot luck luncheon but I would have loved to have kept it all for myself! It needed to cook a little longer than recipe stated. I added a bit of vanilla and some lemon zest to the frosting and thought it was just perfect with the cake.

I've made it twice, and was delighted both times. My only modification was to replace the cream cheese in the frosting with marscapone cheese, because that's what I had on hand.

Today I made cupcakes using this recipe for my son's birthday (monkey theme). The cake was truly delicious, and very easy to make. It baked perfectly in about 25 minutes - fluffy and moist. I really made sure I whipped the eggs, butter and sugar as much as possible, which may make a difference in the density. I only had to fill the cupcake tins halfway with the batter, and in doing so, there were thirty. I also really liked that the frosting was not overly sweet, but I will try the suggestion of substituting vanilla yogurt for sour cream, as it was a bit too tart for my taste. But for the future, this recipe is definitely a keeper!

This cake is awesome! It was easy, moist and delicious. I made it for my 4th of July picnic because I had some ripe bananas and now I had to come print the recipe for all of the neighbors. Instead of banana bread, I will use this recipe now. I will do it in a bundt pan next time and see how that goes.

This cake was fansatic. One of the best recipes I've ever had, actually. I omittied the frosting entirely because I'm a firm believer that banana bread/cake goes with delicious chocolate. I used melted chocolate chunks (ie broken up chocolate bar), melted it in the microwave, and then spread it over the top of the cake. It was fantastic. I brought it to a birthday party and everyone loved it. I'll be making this again, for sure. It didn't even last 20 minutes!

Delicious and easy! This is a wonderfully moist and tasty cake. I used low fat sour cream, added 3/4 tsp. vanilla and 1 tsp. cinnamon. It took a little longer to cook than stated. It's just right with powdered sugar sprinkled on top instead of the frosting. My family loved this and it's a keeper!

Nice & simple moist cake. The only thing I do different is to toast the flour and sometimes add walnuts. Frosting is tasty, but not necessary. A lemon glaze is very good, makes an excellent tart contrast, and is much lighter (for those who prefer light.) This also works really well with pumpkin or applesauce in place of bananas.

Made this cake today as I had a pile of black bananas and a dinner invitation out tonight at our daughter's! The cake turned out fabulous--I made in a 9 " square glass pan and 4 large cupcakes--and the icing was a perfect fit.The cake is one of those old-fashioned, moist--slightly dense textured cakes with a good golden top. The icing was the right blend of tart to off-set the sweet of the cake.This is a definite keeper, along with the Bon Apetit Red Velvet Cake(with the blueberries and raspberry topped cream cheese frosting) from a couple of years ago!

To the reviewer who wrote, ". . . hard and dry . . . bland at best": Are you serious?! San Francisco, you desperately need to take a cooking class at your local community college, because you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. This was one of the best banana cakes I've ever eaten. It was EXTREMELY moist and flavorful, and I followed the recipe EXACTLY with one exception: I gently folded the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients, being careful not to over mix. That's it. Make it and enjoy it. You'll be glad you did.

I was looking for a recipe to use up some ripe bananas I had (muffins don't cut it sometimes), and found this...The cake got so many raves from friends, it is definitely going into the repertoire. I didn't change a thing to the recipe, and it was delicious!

I made this as a layer cake for my son's 2nd birhday. I cut the sugar, but I think I cut it too much, so beware of that. He loved it, though. I didn't make the frosting, though I want to try it! I'll make that on next time around...

For those of you that think you are clever reducing your sugar amount, I hope you realize that sugar has an equally important job of tenderizing the cake. The recipe is great just the way it's presented.

This cake is WONDERFUL when you are in need of comfort food. The texture was fluffy and moist, good banana flavor, not overwhelmingly sweet (but you could probably still reduce the sugar and not miss it) and I don't usually make frosting or particularly even like it, but this is delicious, the sour cream gives it some tang and I thought it was a nice pairing with the cake. I happened to have low-fat sour cream on hand and neufchatel (1/3 less fat) and the results were super, it's smooth and glossy and doesn't harden up in the fridge. I like to eat it cold. I deviated only slightly from the recipe in that I wanted to find a use for four ripe bananas and I threw the extra one in. I love this frosting so much I am going to try it on some other cakes too.

Out of sheer boredom from making banana bread (too many ripe bananas), I tried this recipe. I thought the cake flavor was very good. Good texture, moist, predominate banana flavor. However, the frosting was overwhelming. It was just too sour for the sweetness of the banana flavor. I would make the recipe again but try a different frosting.

I make this cake all the time -- probably every three weeks or so. My kids ADORE it! I always cut the sugar to only (ONLY, haha) one cup. Also, one time I was out of sour cream so I used fat free vanilla yogurt, and it turned out so well, that's how I always make it now. I usually add either one cup of chocolate chunks, or mini chips, so I never frost it. I've made it in a bundt pan (which takes a good 45 minutes to bake), in two 8" rounds (freeze one for another day), and into cupcakes. I probably wouldn't serve it to company, but for an afterschool snack, this recipe is perfect.

I made this for friends last night and recieved rave reviews from everyone. The cake was very moist and had a comfort food type appeal. I did use plain yogurt in place of the sour cream and it was great. I am confident I will make this recipe again.

May or may not make again, but it was a perfectly decent cake. Used same method as previous reviewer (Paris)and cake was suitably moist and soft - a denser type of cake but not at all heavy. Taste of cake was pleasant but nothing to write home about. Icing was great! I was just looking for something other than my usual banana bread to use old bananas; generally I don't make cakes of this type often. For a more exciting option, try the Banana Coffee Cake with Chocolate Chip Streusel (on this site).

I made this with the same ingredients but following my normal cake-making method and it was light, moist and delicious. I beat the butter and sugar until fluffy, adding a couple of spoonfuls of the cream to help me out. I then beat in the eggs one by one (I used 3 medium eggs), beating well after each, and beat the mixture for another five minutes. I then gently folded in a quarter of the dry ingredients, then a quarter of the combined the wet ingredients (banana, lemon, cream), repeating until all was mixed. Fold, don't beat, and don't overmix, just enough so each addition is incorporated. Next time I think I'd reduce the sugar a little, and perhaps use strong coffee instead of the lemon juice, but it was excellent as is.

To answer New Mexico's question, the frosting calls for both sour cream and cream cheese as the sour cream measurement is divided between it and the cake. I added semi-sweet chocolate chips, but will only add 1/2 cup instead of one cup next time. The cake and frosting are yummy together with the chocolate chips. However, the chips weren't well spread out and some spots are overwhelmingly chocolate chip. Otherwise, I agree that plain yogurt works as well as sour cream. I had yogurt in the cake and sour cream in the frosting and have kept the cake in the refridgerator.

if you don't try chocolate frosting (a simple ganache works very well- one cup heavy cream brought to a boil, remove from stove and add 8 oz. semi sweet or bitter sweet chocolate- let cool a little and pour on cooled cake) with banana cake- you are truly missing out on one of the all time greatest taste combos- chocolate and bananas....

I MADE THIS CAKE FOR MY GREAT AUNT'S BIRTHDAY. I BAKED IT AT 350 DEGREES JUST LIKE THE RECIPE SAYS TO DO FOR 30 MINUTES AND I WAS VERY DISSAPPOINTED. WHEN I TOOK IT OUT OF THE OVEN IT WAS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL. I MADE A CHOCOLATE FROSTING BECAUSE MY AUNT HATES CREAM CHEESE. I LET IT COOL PUT THE FROSTING ON AND DECORATED IT WITH YELLOW ROSES FOR MY AUNT'S 80th. BIRTHDAY. WHEN WE GOT TO THE PARTY AND CUT THE CAKE IT WAS NOT COOKED FULLY AND I WAS SO TOTALY EMBARASSED I TOOK THE CAKE AND DUMPED IT IN THE TRASH IMMEDIATELY! I WILL PROBABLY NEVER MAKE THIS CAKE AGAIN. I WOULD BE MUCH TO SELF CONCIOUS ABOUT MY BAKING ABILITY.

The cake is too light and almost greasy with moistness from the sour cream and butter in it. The frosting is sickeningly whipped and frothy. My idea of this classic cake has it with a butter cream frosting that is somewhat hardened. This is a very rich cake that doesn't seem worth the calories.
