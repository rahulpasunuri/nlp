I have made this recipe over and over again and it is always a huge hit. I use double the amount of assorted nuts (pecans/walnuts/almonds/cashews) and sometimes substitute harissa for the sambal oelek.

OK. Used 1/2 chili powder, otherwise would have been too hot. Wouln't make it again, however, I served it at as appetizer, and some guests really liked them.

I cut the recipe in half and used mixed nuts. The almonds were soft and next time I will lightly toasted first, but the pecans and walnuts were perfect. Cahews would work as well. I agree with a previous reviewer that the sauce would cover way more than the stated quantity of nuts. This is quite spicy and quite good. I used Indian chile rather than Mexican, to work with the sambal olek. Leftovers are going into a salad of lettuces, Maytag blue cheese, and pear slices.

Very simple and easy to make. You can easily coat four to five cups of nuts with this mixture. I made this for a get together with friends. The nuts disappeared within the first 20 minutes of my guests arriving. This will be a staple at all my future parties.

Make 'em spicier. I used 3-4 tablespoons chile sauce and skipped the chile powder. Also, you can halve the sugar and water. I cooked them for about 15 minutes. Definitely good with pecans, I'll try again with some other nuts.

Good taste, but far too much sugar which creates a gooey ball. Cut the sugar & water substantially, roast the nuts before you mix them, and you might get something you can serve to your guests.

YUM!!! Used with cashews, almonds and brazil nuts. Prepared using all other ingredients as directed, including sriracha hot sauce (already one of my favorites - find it if you've never tried it!) 3 cups of nuts will be very well coated with these proportions. I went with about 4.5 cups and found it to my liking... nice smattering of flavor. Fabulous!

used tabasco instead of crazy spicy hot sauce and was still delicious... saw it in the RSVP section of my Bon Appetit and couldn't wait to try it out

This makes a lot of delicious munchies - the first time I made it, the bowl lasted about 20 minutes and there were only 6 people there. I did find that the spice mix makes enough for at least 4 cups of nuts, and could probably be used with 6 cups if well tossed. Next time, I'm going to use almonds and peanuts in addition to the pecans...cashews sound good too. Absolutely addictive!
