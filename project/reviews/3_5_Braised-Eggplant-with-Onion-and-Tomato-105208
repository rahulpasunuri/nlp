Substituted a sprig of fresh rosemary for the chopped basil and beef broth for the water. Very flavorful. Still excellent heated a day later.

This is by far my favorite eggplant recipe. However, I make it without so much fuss. I simply chop the vegetables up in 1 inch pieces and mix with the sauce/marinade then pop into the oven. Be sure to stir the mixture every 15 min. or so to "baste" the vegetables. Great over rice with some toasted pine nuts for a vegetarian meal.

Tasty, but not great. Good flavor, very oily. I'd definitely cut down on the oil next time. Wasn't such a different dish - kind of ordinary. Wouldn't _not_ make again, but it wouldn't be my first choice.

Time consuming, but deeee-licious! Wonderful different way to use eggplant.

This was quite good, although it did take an extra 20 minutes for my eggplants to cook. I served this w/ braised lamb shanks, so I topped the eggplant off w/ a generous dollop of tzatziki made w/ real Greek yogurt (recipe from the Joy of Cooking). I think the tzatziki is what made this recipe great. On its own, it's also still good enough to make again -- just not THAT good (and I love eggplant, onion and tomato).

This recipe always turns out fantastic and has become a staple at our house. Good warm the first day and either chilled or room temp...if there is any left over that is. People who are not fond of eggplant will even devour this one. Its Mediterranian taste is a keeper.

This was AWFUL! It was so bland, ended up throwing it all away. I took the suggestions of some of the reviewers and cooked all veggies at once. Maybe I should have made the boats according to recipe. Don't waste your time.

This was simply delicious. I made it just as the recipe indicated and received rave reviews from everyone at dinner. The presentation was beautiful. I don't think this could have been better. I served it with the suggested Tomatoes Stuffed with Bulghur and a green salad. A delicious meal for a summer night.

This ws easy to make, and it was OK, but it didn't meet my expectations based on all the rave reviews. I used one large eggplant rather than the baby eggplants, so I may try it again to see if the smaller eggplant makes a difference.

This was wonderful. Not a good season for fresh tomatoes, so I used 2 cups of chopped canned Italian tomatoes with excellent results. Had just used my last drop of lemon juice in a marinade, so substituted the same amount of rice wine vinegar. Still delicious. If you can get the baby eggplants, I urge you to try it.

This dish is wonderful. I used all ingredients exactly,except replaced equal amounts of Splenda to sugar because I am trying to eat as low carbohydrate as possible. I sweated the onions for a few minutes, cubed the eggplant and tossed everything together instead of halving the eggplant and going through the extra steps . This dish is easy very flavorful and delicious! I f you like eggplant you'll love this! Definately a keeper as I have made it a few times already!

I'm on Weight Watchers and adapted this to be low cal and it was still fabulous! I cut the oil to 1 tablespoon and instead of sugar I used Splenda; I sauted the onions in V8 juice and since the presentation did not matter I cubed the eggplant and tossed it all together. It was still wonderfun.

Wonderful recipe!!! Have made it several times and it has always been a hit. When not going for the presentation, just dice the eggplant and bake everything together. I have also tried adding chicken to the mix. It doesn't hurt the flavor, but would rather cook it separately and serve on the side.

Wow...I loved this recipe. Thanks for the tip on using the tomato juice vs. H2O. It added flavor. This is what I love about this site. All the reviews saves me from making a mediocre dish. I didn't find the basting cumbersome, but then again I was putzing (sp?) in the kitchen anyway.

Because this recipe had such high ratings, I decided to try it. I admit it was very tasty; but, it seemed a bit labor intensive with the basting every 15 minutes. I think the next time I make it I will dice the eggplant and just bake it along with the tomatoes, etc. I'll just add a bit of sugar to the tomatoes and omit the water. I think the results will be equally good and much less trouble, plus the cooking will be reduced as well.

If this isn't the single best thing I've ever eaten, I wish I could remember what the other thing was so that I could eat it again!! I NEVER expected this to be SO succulent, flavorful and delicious--thank goodness the other reviews made me try it anyway because my reputation has been enhanced about 300% as a result of producing this masterpiece--TRY THIS YOU WON'T BELIEVE IT!!!PS. I did make some substitutes--instead of water I used the juice from the tomatoes and I forgot to remove the pan from the oven when I added the other ingredients to the onions, so I kept cooking them all for a while--doesn't seem to have hurt a THING!! The tomatoey flavor of the eggplant at the end is STUPENDOUS!!!!

"Imam Bayaldi" is a Middle Eastern dish: one theory about its name is that the Imam (ruler) fainted when he saw how much precious olive oil was in the dish...another is that he fainted when he tasted how good it was!

This is an outstanding dish. I made a few changes. I used 8 plum tomatoes instead of the tomatoes from the stuffed tomato recipe. I eliminated the water - just used the olive oil with the lemon juice and sugar. I poured the oil over the eggplant in the oven and cooked them for only 45 minutes. That was enough for them to be cooked. Perhaps my eggplant were very small. Everyone raved about them. Reminds me of a dish I used to make called "The Imam Fainted". Anyone ever hear of it?
