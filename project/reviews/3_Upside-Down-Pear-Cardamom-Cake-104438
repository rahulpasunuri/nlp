I like the combination of the pear and cardamon.They mesh well together adding to the subtleties of the ingredients.

Lovely upside-down cake, and it's a good use of some of the pears from our tree. Indeed the cake ends up a little dry and over-sweet, but less sugar, more milk and a healthy scoop of ice cream should soon sort that out. I did add cinnamon and just a little nutmeg. I followed advice to cook the pears and sugar slowly for nearly 20 minutes before 'battering' and baking.

Easy and bland. Cake is too dense, flavor is dull, the texture unappealing. Two forks for ease.

I love this cake, so easy and fast! I would definitely use freshly ground green cardamom though and add extra. I once made this with white nectarines instead of pears and they didn't have as much juice which made the whole thing come out like scones. It tasted fantastic though and the fruit caramelized nicely.

Quick, easy, and every loooved it. I didn't have plain sugar so used a raw sugar instead and used freshly ground cardamom. Cardamom is one of my favorite spices so I added a pinch to my whipped cream, which people raved about.

This was great! Don't be afraid when the butter and sugar foam up. The caramel was delicious. Use fresh cardamom - I added extra and put it in the whipped cream for serving.

I cut the butter by two tablespoons in the cake and I also reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup rather than 3/4 cup and I felt that the cake turned out really well. It is nice to eat a slice of cake and appreciate the other flavors besides sugar. The cardamom gives the cake a nice warmth and subtle spice without overpowering the pear or the cake.

I made this with pears from my tree in County Waterford, Ireland. The cake was not quite as moist as I'd like it, but it was still delicious and everyone, family & guests, loved it.

I made this cake as written with one exception - I ground my cardamon fresh, and the taste was superb! And for those who said there is too much butter in the recipe, note that the recipe states 1/2 stick = 1/4 cup so, the cake asks for less than 1/2 cup of butter.

So yummy! It comes out different every time, but always delicious. If using a larger cast iron pan, I tend to use more butter and sugar.

This cake is easy to make and very satisfying. I felt that it could use a bit more flavor and I'm not sure just what...perhaps some cinnamon or some nutmeg. The Cardomom is wonderful and tastes "rich"...but it needs some zing. Great with vanilla ice cream on a snowy last-day-of-February night.

One additional note for all: When carmelizing the pears, it's extremely important to cook on low heat for a longer time, about 15-17 mins. Even if they don't appear fully done, they're done. Just take your time.

Great recipe. Not overly sweet and very easy to make. My only suggestion is adding 1/8 tsp. of nutmeg in with the dry ingredients to round out the flavor of the cake batter. Serving with whipped cream instead of ice cream makes the dessert much lighter.

I used red barletts, that were very ripe. I was worried that they were putting out too much juice and that they wouldn't caramelize properly so I sprinkled a little brown sugar over them before spooning over the batter. I needent have worried though, they were perfect. The cake has a lovely texture, but I wish there was a slightly more pronounced cardamom flavor. Maybe mine is old. But will definately make again. Have more pears getting too ripe as we speak!

This is a great cake! I did have trouble getting the pears to caramelize, so after it was baking, I sprinkled a little brown sugar on top and put it under the broiler for about 1 minute. This seemed to do the trick. I also cut back on the sugar and it tastes light to me. Not too sweet. Would be great with ice cream.

Just made this for the first time last night, and it was a big hit! Still great this morning with coffee! Next time I think I'd use less butter w/ the pears and add a bit of nutmeg in the cake batter. Lovely cake any way you make it.

i just made this for a birthday dinner and it got Rave reviews. however, i added some persimmons and carmelized them with the pears, and i added allspice, cinammon, and a bit of 1/2n1/2 (keeping the overall milk volume the same). i transferred to a pyrex and baked closer to 400 -it got a little crunchy on top, moist inside, with the fabulousness that is caramelized pears/persimmons on the bottom. topped with sprinklings of powdered sugar. my only change would be to serve with coconut ice cream (macapuno)

After reading all the reviews, I decided to make the cake myself, with some modifications. I cut down on the sugar and the butter, as suggested by other cooks. It turned out pretty good, although I added some more spices (nutmeg, ginger, cinnamon) to my taste. The batter wasn´t enough to cover the pears but it was okay after it had baked. My pears didn´t carmalize very well with the addition of so much butter, so what I would do next time is carmelize the sugar alone and cook the pears in only 1 tablespoon of butter and a bit of vanilla bean until tender, then when the caramel is ready I would mix it with the pears and then the cake batter. Also, anyone living in Spain should know that all-purpose flour does not work - you must use yeast, because if not, even with baking powder the cake will not rise.

This one was not a good effort: too sweet, for one. Second, because we are told not to disturb the pears, they did not brown and caramelize very well. When I turned the cake, there were puddles of buttery sugar in each hollow. Yuk. Also Very dense. Won't do this again. In case someone is interested, I found a much better recipe for upside down cake w/cardamom: David Lebovitz's CakeUse the amount of cardamom in the recipe, not the ingredient list...it's a boo boo.

I loved it - it was sweet but still great. Once I didn't have cardamon so used nutmeg instead and it was still good.

Very yummy but way too sweet. After some experimenting, i think it would be much better with only 1/3 cup sugar in the pears, and only 1/2 cup sugar in the cake. Also, i used only HALF the amount of butter in the cake. More than that is absolutely unneccessary. And skim milk works just as good as whole milk. Also, since i don't have a cast-iron skillet, i used a glass baking dish and did the whole thing in the oven, never using the stove top. It turned out just great that way. I like the idea of the almond paste that a cook below added! Sounds good!

Wonderful recipe winning rave reviews. I added about 1 T of chopped crystallized ginger to the cake batter and the topping. The cake was too sweet, next time I'll cut the amount of sugar.

This was a great cake. I did not use the cardamom, but it was delicious just the same. ANd it looks very impressive, great to bring to a party. I left it out in covered pedestal and it was a little mushy the next day, so I'll probably put it in the fridge to keep next time. My friends went crazy of the cake!!

Great! I made this with some bits of unsweetened almond paste in the cake batter, which cut down on the overall sweetness. It ended up adding a greater depth of flavor and brought out the cardamom taste better.

I normally love cardamom, but this recipe was really disappointing. I wasn't impressed with the texture of the cake -- too dense. And the the cake was too sweet.

This cake was very light and a perfect dessert after a heavy meal. I used a brasier pan instead of a skillet to fit in my oven (small handles). It worked very well. I will definitely make it again. It was so easy.

I made this recipe for a birthday brunch and everyone loved it. Try if you can to get very fresh cardamom, because it really makes a difference. I wish the recipe had been be very specific about the fact that you need to turn the cake out right after it is done. Those carmelized pears really stick if you don't.
