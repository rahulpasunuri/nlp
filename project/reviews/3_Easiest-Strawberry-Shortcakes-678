Reading the other reviews, I used Kroger store-brand biscuits. They were smaller, so I used 2 per person, but they are low fat, not salty and not heavy, which is what I was looking for. I made sure they browned nicely, so they were crunchy outside and fluffy (not flaky) inside. This was a light and fast alternative to typical shortcakes.

Those refrighrator biscuits simply are not the right thing for shortcake. Much too greasy and salty. If you MUST have a shortcut try reduced fat bisquick- at least it has the right texture and is not greasy.

I like this recipe's simplicity. It's easy to prepare, it has a nice appearance when served, and best of all it appeals to certain difficult to please people who dislike rich (their word: "fancy") desserts. I personally have had better luck with the flaky variety of biscuits as the buttermilk variety seems to be too heavy for us, but I think that's just our palate talking. Some reviewers shouldn't be such Epicurian snobs, if you ask me. There's a place for simpler recipes, too, and this is a nice one.

Is cooking with a log of processed dough from a tube worthy of an epicurean? Come on- making biscuits from scratch is just as easy and better... search for your own biscuit recipe! Tube shortcake... yesh!

I have made this recipe several times and do not believe the negative review about it. My entire family loved them and devoured them and always asks when we are having them again.

i used phillsbury grand buttermilk biscuits and unfortunately found them to be a poor substitute. the biscuits were far too heavy and salty for my taste. they weren't complementary to strawberries at all. although i did enjoy the leftover biscuits for the breakfast next morning, no amount of sugar nor cream could possibly turn them into shortcakes worthy of season's best berries in this person's humble opinion.

These were wonderful - so much better than those packaged sponge cakes. I made all the biscuits at once, but only 2 had the cream and sugar on them. The other biscuits were done in 12 minutes, but the 2 remaining ones were still "doughy." I took out the 8, and turned the broiler on the shortcakes for just a minute to brown the tops... SO GOOD! What a great idea!

This recipe was great! I suggest using Hungry Jack's Honey Butter Biscuits, or working a bit of honey into other biscuits. It's divine. I had a little problem with my cream when I made it, but I think that's a personal problem and not because of the recipe. :)
