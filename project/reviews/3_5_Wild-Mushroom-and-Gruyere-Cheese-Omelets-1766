Excellent recipe. My only variation was to substitute marjoram for the parsley. It's early spring and the marjoram in our garden looked too fresh and inviting to pass up. I can't speak to the parsley, but the marjoram added a nice, but subtle flavor that complemented the dish. By the way, omlettes are very easy if you pre- heat your pan.

Great, light dinner (served w/ mixed baby greens salad). Too lazy to do omelets, so I just made it fritatta style -- mixed all ingredients together, cooked stovetop until bottom is lightly browned, transfered to oven under broiler until top is set. Cut into wedges and sprinkled w/ a little cheese and parsley that I'd reserved. Yummy.
