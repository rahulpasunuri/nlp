Quick question: for prunes, are they dried, or not?

I made this exactly as written (actually I doubled it) and it came out amazingly good. It's not grey, it's just the right amount of heat, the flavors unfold at different times with each mouthful. I cooked each ingredient in a large wok.

This was fantastic. I am still new to making mole (this was my second time) and I am always unsure if it will taste good because for the first 2-4 hours, it does not taste good and I think that all my time is wasted. I made it one day and then used it the day after. It was great today, so tasty. I did add 2-3 tsp of cocoa powder to add that traditional flare to it. I also added a couple extra red chiles (dried) to add a bit of kick and I think I would do that again. All in all, super yummy and very complex. It is a long process, but I don't think there is any way around that if you're hoping for authentic flavors.

I made this the night before and in the morning when I tasted it, the mole was still pretty tame. I simmered a little stock with red pepper flakes (for heat) and annatto (for the red) and then added that to the master mix and re-reduced it. When I make this again, I'll include annatto and about half the chile pepper seeds in the initial frying.

Excellent Dish, definitely worth the wait! Mole is one of my favorite dishes and I've tried a few different versions (since every family in Mexico has their own family recipe). I love the use of hazelnuts in this one. It's best to make this at least a day before, the sauce gets better with age and make sure you make the whole batch, it freezes very well and helps for a quick dinner- we especially love to make chicken enchiladas with it. And don't substitute bananas for plantains, they are not the same (as previous person asked). Yummy!!!

I found that this dish is worth all the time put into it: it is unusual and tasty. The only problem for me was the greyish colour, next time i will not peel apples to make thte mole more colourful. Also, i would put a bit more spices than recommended.

This is wonderful. The turkey came out juicy. My bf is Mexican and loves dishes that remind him of his grandma. To the lady the wants to sub plantians DON'T. Bananas are not the same. Most larger store carry them. If you don't see them ask. Most stores will get them. Or try the local market.

I haven't made this yet, but plan to over the holidays. As far as a substitution for the plantains you can use bananas (the greener the better). Happy to help a fellow Springfieldian! :-)Merry Christmas Everybody!

Does anyone know of any substitution for plantains (in case I can't find any)?

Definetly time consuming but well worth the effort. I served it with the turkey breast in the recipe for Thankgiving dinner and it was a showstopper!

I have to admit I had SERIOUS doubts about this one as I was putting it together. How could this combination possibly taste good? I am so thankful I carried it through. this stuff is amazing. Do not try to reduce the amount. 8 cups is a lot yes, but you can freeze it and you will want to have some on hand. It's worth every bit of effort.
