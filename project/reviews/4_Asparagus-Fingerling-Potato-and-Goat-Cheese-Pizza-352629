The potatoes and goat cheese combo make this recipe for me. The generous sprinkle of pepper at the end is key. Absolutely delicious. We will definitely be making this again.

This was great!! Made for two different dinner parties and everyone raved! I did cheat and use pizza dough from Trader Joes. Easy and delicious!

I used a pizza dough I bought from a local pizza place. Also used red potatoes sliced thin instead of fingerlings. Pizza was delicious and pretty to look at. I loved it!

I used a different crust but I thought that the combination of toppings was delicious..I did cut back just a bit on the goat cheese though. It was perfect as is but I like the suggestion other reviewers have made of adding sausage or bacon. I served it with the Green Pea Soup with Tarragon and Pea Sprouts recipe from this site, a mixed greens salad, and lemon frozen yogurt with blackberry sauce. Made for a yummy spring dinner!

This was a delicious and well-balanced pizza! The combinations are a little unexpected, but they worked so well together. I confess that I also added Italian sausage to the combination to add a little spice (and protein)... A reviewer said they had problems with the pizza sticking, but that wasn't a problem for me. I even cooked it initially on a cooking sheet (with corn meal), then slid the pizza over to bake directly on a baking stone (with no corn meal)! Anyway, I was very happy with the pizza, and here's my take on it, accompanied by photos... http://tracywongphoto.com/blog/?p=491

This pizza was so well-balanced! I confess that I also added Italian sausage to it, but still... One reviewer said they had trouble with the pizza sticking, but I didn't have that problem. I used a little bit of corn meal... I even baked it initially on a cookie sheet (with corn meal), then transferred to bake directly on a baking stone (with no corn meal) and didn't have any issues... Here's my take on the recipe, accompanied by my own photos: http://tracywongphoto.com/blog/? p=491

This was a quick & easy recipe...and good, not WOW. It was a bit bland for our liking. I really liked the flavor combinations of the potatoes and the asparagus and garlic/oil...I will keep this recipe and make small appetizer pizzas with it, use a dollop of pesto and maybe add some bacon or something.

This pizza was deeelish! I really enjoyed it. Question - how do I make it so that it won't stick to the baking sheet? i've tried oil and another time, cornmeal but it's still sticking!

I used my own crust and added a bit of fresh rosemary before baking because I had some and it sounded good. I love potatoes on pizza, and the flavors in this one are complex without being heavy. I almost hate to say it because it's such a good veggie recipe, but some really good bacon could make this exceptional.

Good, but I wasn't overwhelmed by any means. Like others have mentioned, the potatoes just aren't doing it for me as a pizza topping. Next time I may try adding bacon or something to liven it up...

delicious! The combination of flavors on top of the pizza is terrific. I'm trying to think of other uses for the goat cheese/asparagus/potato/onion etc mix. I used crust from Trader Joe's, which stuck to my pan despite the cornmeal. Any suggestions? I will definitely be making this again!

wow. so--i mad this one night half-way expecting a veg only friend to show--well they didn't. THEIR LOSS! This was excellent! I used purple and yukon gold potatoes instead of the fingerling. The purple color made it look fantastic! I was also suspicious about the addition of salt at the end--added it to half the pizza to see what it would do--totally need it. it brings out the flavors. i used a store bought ready to roll dough from trader joes. it worked great. ALSO i paired it with a cheap prosecco. it was like alcoholic soda pop with this pizza. perfect!

So delish! Creamy and tangy and smooth and crispy! What a treat for the palate. I used a medley of potatoes, including purple. Visually, the pizza was stunning; I love green and purple together!!

i made this for a party and barely got a piece for myself! it was such a hit i had 4 people ask me for the recipe. easy and really tasty. i look forward to making this again soon so i can take more than one piece! i don't really bake so i bought pilsbury thin pizza dough in the tube. i even got a compliment on the crust!

My husband says it's the best pizza I have made yet, and my 9 month old finally ate asparagus. This is a winner.

I just made this tonight for dinner for 4 people. It fed everyone exactly and everyone loved it! The three cheeses with the asparagus and potato are a surprising but delicious match. I would definitely make this again. What a hit!

I used feta instead of goat and sauteed shallots instead of green onions. It was deeelicious!

Loved this!! I made some minor changes--used baby red potatoes as the store didn't have fingerlings and used a premade crust to save time. It was delicious. On the leftover slices, used some slices of prosciutto and this was a great addition.

This pizza was delicious, although I did make a few alterations to the original recipe. Instead of using grated mozzarella I used fresh mozzarella cut into slices and added carmelized onions and chopped fresh rosemary. The end result was absolutely fantastic and I will definitely make this again.

WOW! I followed the recipe as written. However couldn't find fingerling potatoes so used baby klondike combination. We all loved it! My 11 year old daughter commented that it was fabulous! Definitely a keeper and will make again. This was light dinner with fruit. But next time will serve with salad and try it on the grill.

This was easy and delicious, but I used a whole wheat pizza dough, pesto instead of just garlic oil, added a handful of roasted red and yellow peppers, and tossed a bit of crumbled cooked apple- wood smoked bacon. This will be in my recipe file for a long time!

it's a small potato, looks like a (chubby) finger

Sorry to be so stupid, but what are fingerling potatoes? I am an Italian cook, and do not understand... Thanks for help!

This pizza was SO good. Even better the next day. I seasoned my fingerlings with salt and pepper before I put them on the pizza. I also used a tri-colored mix of fingerlings. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. We will be making this again and again.

I loved the fingerlings! Are you guys using real tasty fingerlings? I did a mix of purple red and yellow and it was so pretty. And I have made this crust a bunch and frozen it, makes easy quick apps just throw whatever you have in the fridge on top and bake for a bit-

Rating: 3
I wasn't sure about the fingerlings, so instead I added some shiitake mushrooms, which I sauteed beforehand. It was so delicious and I'll definitely make it again!

Made exactly as writtten, including the homemade whole wheat crust, which I thought was the best part. Overall very tasty combo of cheese/veg/starchy topping, and very appealing to look at coming out of the oven. The potato isn't bland, it's subtle :) and is definitely stomach filling if you are serving as a main course.

We made this pizza without the potatoes the first time we did it, but added thinly sliced sweet red peppers, black olives and artichoke hearts. The potatoes on a pizza sounded awful and I see from most of the reviews that it was. We used a crust mix which made it quick and easy. The three cheeses and garlic on the crust make it fabulous.

My husband and I were not crazy about the potatoes. Loved the asparagus and cheeses. Will make it again without the fingerlings.

This is the best pizza I've ever eaten. This combination of flavors just works. No changes required. I'll bet I've made it once a week since I received my May issue.

I gave this 4 forks, but I have to say, the potatoes don't really do it for me. LOVED the cheeses, garlic/oil, and asparagus, but the the potatoes made me say "wha'?" and not in a good way. I don't feel they added much to the party. I've made this with other ingredients and still love it. Some things I've tried or plan on trying are combinations of: potatoes with fresh rosemary, prosciutto, mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes, red peppers (roasted if you're an overachiever), red pepper flakes, pine nuts. Can't wait to mix these up again and again! Love this pizza!

After reading all the reviews, I was expecting much more... It was good, not great. The fingerling potatoes added nothing for me personally and I won't use them on pizza again. (They weren't overwhelming -- they were underwhelming.) Somehow, the variety of flavors just didn't come together. Maybe I will try adding asparagus to a more traditional pizza, or just a more traditional white pizza. This version just didn't live up to my expectations.

I made this pizza last night as the recipe stated and very much enjoyed it. I think next time I will take the advice of adding pesto but I will definitely make this again!

ok all...i read all of the reviews and here is the final plan for my pizza this weekend...i will use trader joes pizza dough, the pesto, and red potatoes. Thanks all. I will review it again after I make it. (for the first time)

Rating: 0
sherman oaks ca...that sounds fantastic about the pesto. i make my own pesto and i think a smear of that on the crust would really fuse the flavors together. Great idea...I am going to make it this weekend.

Hi all, I made this pizza for a part of our mother's day appetizer parade....I cut it into 12 small wedges, and it was gone in a flash. I guess that means I need to make it again...everyone raved. I'm toying with the idea of painting the dough with some pesto before assembling the pie...thoughts? Cheers all, Jeff

I thought the flavors were great. Make sure you don't have your pizza too thin in the middle because it is heavy in toppings, and it will not hold. I bet a pre-made (eek!) crust would even work for this because it is so hefty. I added sundried tomatoes to the top, too.

Not impressed. Expected more based on the reviews. I used Trader Joe's dough. Followed the recipe but it definately needed something more. The potatoes did not add anything.

Used a kitchen aid to make the dough and it turned out great! Love the garlic flavor and the addition of the potatoes. I didn't have fingerling potatoes, so subbed it with red potatoes instead.

Rating: 3
Very nice. We added some prosciutto. I could never understand why anyone would put potatoes on pizza, but it was OK. Seemed to want an herb... tarragon? Dill? Someone mentioned rosemary... That might knock it up to 4 forks. I'm also thinking shrimp might be interesting.

I made this pizza with leftover roasted potatoes and it was great. The goat cheese made the pizza.

This was amazing. I used store bought dough and Yukon golds rather than fingerlings. When the pizza was all loaded up, I opted to leave out the goat cheese. I can't wait to make it again.

Yum! I made this exactly as directed and it was super-flavorful. Perfect for spring!

This is delicious and my husband is making it for the third time. We're out of asparagus and are using yellow squash and shitake mushrooms tonight. My husband always makes the dough, makes one pizza and freezes the dough for another time. On the suggestion of another reviewer, rosemary has been added. YUM!

Delicious! I made this on the grill and it was wonderful (for the dough and melting the cheese). This recipe involves some prep time but it is definitely worth the effort.

yum. The goat cheese was great. I doubled the garlic and used premade dough from trader joes. Delicious! Cornmeal is unnecessary if you are using premade dough.

My friend made this for our gourmet club. It was delicious. I will make it again.

This was great. I followed the advice of using the pizza dough in a tube (which was fine). In haste, I misread the recipe and sliced the potatoes in my food processor before boiling them up. This simplified the prep and didn't detract from the dish. I also sprinkled garlic salt on the asparagus. I received lots of compliments.

Rating: 4
Deeelicious! Definitely a crowd favorite, and it doesn't require much prep at all. We did add some red pepper flakes to give it a kick and I think that rounded it out perfectly. Next time I might even drizzle with Siracha (sic?)

Definitely a keeper. Exactly as written.

Could not find fingerling potatoes so we omitted them also used feta instead of goat cheese. It was still a delicious recipe and next time we will find the potatoes because we could see what a great addition they would make. We doubled the garlic and used the pizza crust pillsbury makes in the tube which is actually very good! Will definitely make again, its a good 'white' pizza. Maybe next time we will try a little fresh rosemary on it as well.

Rating: 4
This was a superb recipe. I served it for a casual cocktail party along with several other appetizers. I received so many praises on the pizza and it looks great and is super easy. I would definitely make this one again. I used pillsbury refrigerated pizza dough found where the refrigerated biscuits are. I also used feta instead of goat cheese which worked just great.

Prepared the recipe w/no changes. We loved it! I prepared two pizzas. We ate one and the other I put into the freezer. We'll see how it turns out.
