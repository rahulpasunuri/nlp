What a unique and tasty potato salad. The dressing is fabo! I used less celery and endive and omitted the zucchini and it couldn't have been better.

This was definitely more like a vegetable salad with some potato in it. In my opinion it would be greatly improved by perhaps omitting the zucchini and half the celery. However, the dressing was really lovely and I will definitely hold on to that recipe.
