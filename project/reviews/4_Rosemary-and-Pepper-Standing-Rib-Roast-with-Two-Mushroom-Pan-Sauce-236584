Made this for Christmas and it was excellent. My only changes were to start roasting at 425 degrees for 15 min before lowering to 350, and I skimmed off most of the rosemary bits from the gravy just before serving as I didn't want the gravy full of rosemary pieces.

I have been making this meal for Christmas ever since it appeared in Gourmet magazine in 2006 (All the Trimmings). It's an absolute feast. The rib roast is superb. And since I have only one oven, I roast it on my backyard grill, and free up the stove for the rest of the dishes.

This recipe was perfect. I followed the directions precisely (except that ours was a five rib, 9 pound roast) and the meat was delicious and the sauce incredible. I loved the woodsy flavor of the porcini and button mushrooms. We served this beef with yukon gold mashed potatoes and green beans. Just lovely.

Very easy and a beautiful presentation. I did most of it ahead of time. The two mushroom pan sauce was out of this world and can be made for other cuts of meat.

Made this roast along with the other dishes (except soup) in the All the Trimings Christmas Dinner last year and will be doing the same tonight...it is an absolute winner. My family says it's one of the best meals they've ever had - restaurant or otherwise. The dishes blend together perfectly and the tart is absolutely delicious and stunning. The only thing I would be careful of, as mentioned previously, is the amount of fat in the roast since it affects the sauce. If you have a larger roast than called for in the recipe, be sure to skim a lot of fat off otherwise you'll end up with mushrooms in dark grey fat. Good luck! :)

Roast was a disaster and the mushroom sauce too thick. The roast was perfectly medium rare but too fatty. I did not use a rack which might have added to the fat problem. I bought the 13.5 lb. roast at Costco and didn't remove fat. Next time I'll get it from a butcher. The worst was the mushroom sauce. The roux made it too thick despite adding water to thin it. Sauce was brown, not attractive on the plate. Overall, the meal was overly rich.

This was a good recipe and worked well. I did use my skimmer to defat the drippings and it worked out well. I will definitely make this again, as it is quite an impressive presentation.

This recipe was absolutely perfect. The gravy was outstanding. I impressed my entire family. I also have to thank my butcher, who sent the most perfect meat. Will use this again.

I made this for Christmas of 2006! Everyone loved it! There were no left overs to give away or to eat the next day! It took quite a while to make, but if you do all the ahead stuff you have time to talk and entertain your guests. Overall it was pretty easy for how wonderful it was!

This receipe was great everyone loved it. the best part was that you could prepare most of the ingredients the day before, which left me a lot more time for other things on Christmas morning.

Amazing, amazing!! My first roast WITH ribs. The timing was perfect but more important - the taste of the meat and the mushroom sauce was the best! My family couldn't compliment me enough. It really is quite simple when prepped ahead of time. MAKE IT!!!!

We had this for Christmas dinner and it was wonderful. My only thought for next time would be to figure out a way to get more of the drippings out of the pan. I skimmed and skimmed, but still thought the sauce had a little more grease than I would have liked. Maybe next time I will chill the drippings for a bit to see if I can get more of the fat out of the pan.

Drum Roll Please.... This was a show stopper! My mother-in-law and father-in-law, 11-year old son and husband all LOVED this! It was great to be able to prepare some parts ahead of time. I did end up using shitake mushrooms as well as button mushrooms, and loved the use of fresh rosemary!

The mushroom sauce was outstanding. I make standing rib roast every Christmas & I will make this again next year, if not sooner!

The mushroom gravy was good but the rib roast was thoroughly underwhelming. I expected something much more dazzling for a $100 piece of meat

The two-mushroom pan sauce is wonderful - lighter than a traditional gravy and very simple to make.

This was fantastic! The rib roast just melt in your mouth and the mushroom sauce that goes with it is chocked full of flavor. Delicious!

Used a different recipe to season the roast (in addition to rosemary, used ground bay leaves, garlic, and thyme). But used this recipe for the pan sauce. Simply incredible! Made one change which was to use fresh rosemary instead of dried. Drained off all the fat in the pan and only used the fond stuck to the bottom to start the sauce. This will definitely become an annual holiday dish in our household.

Made for Christmas dinner and it was outstanding! My husband has high cholesterol so making the roast was bad enough for him and I couldn't bring myself to use the pan drippings for the sauce. I am SO glad I didn't. I made the sauce in a separate pan starting with the broth, porcini liquid and wine and the flavor was really outstanding and there was only 2 T of butter in all the sauce! Will definitely make again.

Wonderful dish. The do-ahead tips made this extremely simple to deliver the table. The mushroom sauce was great.

The sauce on this was decadent and delicious. It would be over the top with just a hint of cream.

What a fantastic recipe!! The roast was perfect and the two-mushroom pan sauce couldn't have turned out better. The flavor and consistency were perfect! I didn't change a thing and will make this for other special occasions. There wasn't a bite of anything left after Christmas dinner!

Excellent recipe, rave reviews. Simple, tasty and savory. My entire family loved it...and a few of them don't particularly like mushrooms. Definitely make this one again!!
