This has got to be the oddest combination of ingredients that actually works. The tomatoes really jazz it up too. I use a can of the stewed tomatoes with a bit of sugar and a whole lot of Cajun Spice seasoning, cook it down well, blend till almost smooth and add a ¼ cup heavy cream. It is very good with the soufflé.

To my previous review I forgot to add that I added 2 healthy squirts of Oriental hot chili sauce to the egg mixture to solve the blandness problem. Very delicious.

I made 1/2 of this recipe and used a mixture of green and yellow peppers and onion. To delete the Cajun sauce, I put about 2/3 of a large plum tomato (chopped) on top of the casserole after it had baked for about 20 minutes, and that really seemed to slow down the cooking time. Bet I baked that sucker about 1 hr., part of the time covered. Next time I would add the tomatoes before it goes into the oven the 1st time. Also, it could have used about 2Xs the amount of veggies. Next time I would use about 1 cup of veggies for my 1/2 recipe. It was very delicious anyway!!!

Sooooo good! I substituted a red pepper for the green (not a fan of green peppers) and used homemade chicken apple sausage and it was fantastic. The sweet sausage and the spicy sauce was a great combination. My husband and I both ate a second serving, enjoyed it so much that we skipped dessert and had a 3rd serving!

Wow This was really good. I'll be making it again for brunch sometime. I did make a few small changes though, suck as I substituted 1/2 cup of milk with heavy cream used 5 eggs instead of 4, used a whole pound of sausage, added onion and diced plum tomatoes. Cooked it on an 2Qt 8in casserole for about an hour 15, at 375.

This recipe is great for those grunge family throw it together last minute dinners! LOL Not something you would make for a church pot luck but definatly good. The great thing about this is you can add whatever you want to it: mushrooms, spices, hot peppers.. I mean it anything you can find in the fridge!!! It makes a great weekend breakfast. The only problem I had with the recipe is the wording about where to pour the egg mixture . After making it though, I realized you pour the egg mixture over the top of the whole thing and it sinks in to fill all the nooks and crannies.
