Very easy, but needed a lttle extra oomph in my opinion. After following the recipe, I added honey, ground cloves and cardamom (yummy addition), a little sea salt, with more port and orange juice at the finish. I subbed OJ for water as well and didn't use the dried cranbarries as I didn't have any on hand. Speaking of cranberries, wear an apron or be very careful,the juice stains fabric and wood surfaces.

The first time I made this, I used apple cider and made it the day before thanksgiving. I had to run back to the store to buy more cranberries because we "nibbled" so much of it that night we wouldn't have enough for the next day! I'm giving it 4 forks for taste and for ease of preparation. I've now tried both the apple cider instead of the water or the orange juice instead, and honestly, each a different, subtle treat. At Christmas, I plan on trying the dried cherries instead of the dried cranberries.

I make this sauce every year and it's consistantly delicious. This year I substitued Ruby Port for an Elderbery Cordial made by Caledonia Spirits located in Vermont. The cordial is sweet like a ruby port but with better flavor. The rest of the recipe I follow as stated. I don't add the dried cherries because I think the sauce gets too sweet (I tried that a couple of times). I only add 1/2 the amount of sugar and add as I go along.

Really enjoyed this recipe. It was easy, basic and delicious. For thanksgiving leftovers, I actually ended up adding blueberries and using it as a spread for rolls and toast. So good!

Absolutely delicious. I've never like cranberry dishes, but this made me a convert. It disappeared at Thanksgiving and I have a repeat request to make it for Christmas. I did add more sugar and used orange juice as suggested in previous reviews.

This is the best cranberry sauce I have ever had. Even people at Thanksgiving who said they normally don't like cranberry sauce loved it. I followed the advice of others and used dried bing cherries and tangerine juice (fresh squeezed) instead of water and it was absolutely delicious.

This was the best cranberry recipe EVER!. I followed some of the other tips and substituted apple cider for water and substituted some dried cherries for some of the cranberries. Did not add any more sugar as the major complaint I and my family has of cranberry sauces is that they are too sweet. This was a hit - for the first time ever we ate all the cranberries on the table. A new family tradition.

Great recipe! A real keeper, great deep rich color and not too sweet although you do have to adjust the sugar to your taste. Definitely use a Ruby Port. I used Tangerine juice for a wonderful citrus accent. I chopped the dried cranberries very fine so they boiled down completely and I completely cooked down the fresh cranberries. This gives you a more traditional creamier appearance then the photo. I think the next time I may try using dried cherries.

Delectable! I used apple cider instead of water, doubled the sugar and simmered whole cloves in the port along with the cinnamon sticks. I removed the cloves before adding the dried cranberries, though. (Only because I didn't have cheesecloth to make a bouquet garni and didn't want a stray clove to end up in someone's mouth... no fun.)

I used dried cherries and orange juice as some of the reviews suggested. Phenomenal flavor! It didn't thicken up like I thought it would, but that didn't matter one bit. I will definitely do this again.

This was an epic recipe and a total highlight of the dinner for me. I've never made Thanksgiving dinner before, so I did a trial run for my mom and some friends. I also made a raw cranberry and orange relish (which everyone loved), but this sauce was in my dreams that night. I did make some changes to the recipe based on other reviews: 1. Doubled the sugar 2. Used Tangerine Juice instead of water 3. Cooked for about 30 minutes to make it even more thick. I cooked it longer because I totally forgot about it on the stove (and was a blessing in disguise). I ate a pot brownie my bro in-law gave me and almost lost my head during dinner and then had to clean up after. Next year I'll buy a big package of tupperware containers and hire help for a couple of hours...

Fantastic! This is a yearly Thanksgiving staple! Easy to make and best of all, it only gets better with age, so make it a day or two ahead of time!

Beautiful . . . did the same as previous reviewer except didn't have cherries. Very nice and was able to leave my chunk of cinnamon in thru the whole process. Might try a little triple sec next time with the OJ.

If you're looking for a sauce to hold it own on a plate with holiday duck or prime rib, this is it. With a few modifications, this has become my family's favorite cranberry sauce--and it is exceptional! Not only in flavor but fragrance; it's heavenly. There are three changes that I made: (1) I doubled the sugar. Cranberry sauce recipes almost always have too little sugar, and, IMHO, this sauce is way too tart without more. if you're hesitant about adding more sugar, however, follow the recipe then, while the sauce is still pipping hot, taste it and stir in more sugar till it's right for you. Cranberry sauces, while still hot, can incorporate more sugar to taste. (2) As mentioned in other comments, I'd suggest orange juice or, better yet, tangerine juice in place of water. It adds that extra, subtle citrus layer. (3) I recommend substituting dried tart cherries for the dried cranberries. Port wine and cherries are a perfect pairing, and the flavor they impart to each other is rich and elegant.

I loved this and so did my guests. I used freshly squeezed orange juice instead of water-it really deepened the flavor and just gave it a slight hint of citrus.

Great recipe, will definitely make again. After reading reviews, decided to remove most of the cinnamon before adding fresh cranberries, sprinkled a tsp or so of ground cloves and, as I do with other cranberry sauce preps, replaced water, with fruit juice, this time apple cider from a local orchard. The sugars from the dried cranberries and cider add enough sweetness to just overcome tartness, worked perfectly in my book. A keeper.

As tasty as it sounds... Used frozen (mildly sweetened) cranberries instead of dried, and sucanat. I had a bit of an issue with the cinnamon crumbling apart & being almost impossible to remove, but that was probably the cinnamon's fault.

Absolutely fantastic! This is the most incredible cranberry sauce you'll ever taste! Do NOT leave out the dried cranberries! They add the sweet to the otherwise tart of the fresh berries. The port and cinnamon tantalize as the cranberries delight. It really is amazing! We served it last year and there was not a drop left after dessert was served... the little that was left was poured over ice cream and savored by all that had their spoons at the ready! Don't miss out on this one!

Yum! The cinnamon and port add depth to the bright cran flavor. I used dried diced apricots and raisins instead of dried crans, to give a touch of something different, and lovely colors. It's great. My only warning is it could be slightly too alcoholic for some; in which case add more sugar or less port...

This is my favourite cranberry sauce. The cinnamon gives it a depth of flavour that 'regular' cranberry sauce doesn't have. As a few people have noted it is on the tart side, but a little more sugar does the trick for anyone who likes it sweeter. I haven't bothered using the dried cranberries and it turns out just fine.

I have been making a classic cranberry sauce for years and decided to change it up this year--this was excellent. Rich and robust, and you can add sugar to taste. My Thanksgiving guests really enjoyed it.

This is the perfect cranberry sauce! The wonderful cinnamon aroma and the luxurious undertones of the ruby port perfectly complement each other. I have never tasted such remarkable cranberry sauce! I can say with much enthusiasm that this will be at my Thanksgiving meal for many, many years to come!

It's too bad some people here had a bad experience with this recipe- we loved it! I made it today with no mods for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a big hit with dinner and also with dessert (w/ vanilla ice cream- yum!) Delicious, simple and sophisticated, plus the color is GORGEOUS. Can't wait to make this again for Xmas. Love it!

Just made this recipe early for Thanksgiving. As many have said, it's a bit sour (which will vary depending on your fresh berries), so I simply added sugar to taste. I also thought it needed something more, so I added the zest of one orange. This added another dimension. Bottom line is it's good but not great.

Way too much cinnamon . . . my cinnamon sticks were about 6" long and I used two of them . . . would only use one next time. Nice and tart, but not too tart, however.

I made this in a Thanksgiving test-run to serve with pork tenderloin and it was quite good, with a strong cinnamon flavor. I substituted Splenda for all of the sugar (adding a bit extra since other reviewers found it too sour) and it was just right. The consistency seemed more runny and less gelled than it would have been with sugar, but I doubt most people would know the difference. Very easy recipe!

Consider yourself warned! Even one fork was too much. This was a shocking disappointment, had to toss it out and make another sauce using my old basic recipe. Luckily I had time to redo it. I used a very good bottle of port and followed the recipe precisely. The flavor was very sour with a rather odd undertone--not pleasant! I have made and tasted cranberry relishs and sauces for many years, and this was the worst.

Best cranberry sauce recipe and it was so easy. I added some ground cloves along with the cinnamon, and a little more port. I also added more sugar to taste to reduce the tartness of the sauce. As for the time it took to cook, 20 minutes was perfect. If you stir frequently as the recipe requests, you shouldn't worry about burning.

Ive made this recipe twice, both with and without the addition of cloves, and it was a huge success. Diners asked for the recipe and finished off the bowl with a spoon. I would definitely recommend cooking at low heat for the full 20 minutes, since this will give the natural high pectin content of the cranberries time to work. If I try another variation it will be lemon zest rather than the more standard orange, since I find orange to be a little to sweet when Im looking for a tangy sauce.

Rating: 4
It was yummy! The port infused a nice flavor. I always add fresh orange zest, and this was no exception. Also added a bit more sugar. I think the cook who said it would burn probably didn't cover it, as I had no such experience. It also was very gelatinous, which was great, as it had a great texture! :)

This came out nicely. I too added orange zest. And also added ground cloves as another reviewer recommended. At the end, I felt the port taste wasn't coming through much, so added a splash more of port and heated briefly. This made a big difference, and finished the sauce nicely.

Very good. I added a half of an orange to give it some complexity. I might add a bit of honey too to bring our some more sweetness.

I have made this cranberry sauce a couple times. The Port really gives it a nice depth. I also add a little orange zest to give it a little extra freshness.

This is a delicious recipe, but isnt perfect yet. A few suggestions. #1, while the port flavor mixes wonderfully with the cinammon and cranberries, it needs something more to make it as complex as I think it should be. I will add a pinch of ground clove next time I make it. hopefully that will do the trick. #2, once all the ingredients are in the pot, just take a masher to it and it is done in 3-4 minutes. If you let it cook 20 more minutes it will surely burn; port is too expensive to waste like that!
