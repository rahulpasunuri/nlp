### Instructions for running the feature selection code
### L645, Fall 2014, Indiana University

### Environment Requirement: Python2.6 or Python2.7 
### Have numpy installed. The IU servers usually have numpy installed
    1. Make a folder called "corpus", at the same level of this.
       Make a folder called "svmdata" at the same level of this.
    2. Go to L645Code/
    3. TO DO FEATURE SELECTION run: (You will need B.1 and B.2 mentioned below)
       python binary_feature_slc.py -nl neg_list.pickle -pl pos_list.pickle -p ../L645ExampleData -n 3 -f 1 -m 1000 -e tagged -r y


    4. TO EXTRACT DATA VECTORS GIVEN THE FEATURES run: (You will need B.1 and B.3 mentioned below)
       python build_data_vector.py -s ../corpus/1_IG.features -p ../L645ExampleData/ -n 3 -e tagged -rl pos_list.pickle -o somename

        python binary_feature_slc.py --help 
        python build_data_vector.py --help

### Description of the data one needs to provide:
   B.1. A folder contains the review data. Requirement:
      1) One recipe per file
      2) Each recipe is represented as a list of comments, each comment is a list of sentences, each sentence is a list of words. 
      [
        [ ["I","like","this"], ["Very", "easy","to","make"] ],  ##comment1 - having two sentences
        [["Dissapointed","tasted","blank"] ],  ##comment2 - having one sentence
      ]

      3)This big list is stored as a Python pickle.

   B.2. Two files specifying your data partition
      One contains the recipe names of those from your NEGATIVE partition
      One contains the recipe names of those from your POSITIVE partition
      **Each file is a Python list of recipe names,stored as a Python pickle. 

   B.3. One file specifying the recipe names you want to extract the vectors from.
      The file contains a Python list of recipe names, and is stored as a Python pickle
