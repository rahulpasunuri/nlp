Divine! Definitely perfect for a weeknight meal, but fancy enough for guests. Didn't have cilantro on hand and used fresh thyme. Also accidentally was a little heavy-handed with the fish sauce, but it didn't seem to hurt it. Served with whole wheat israeli couscous and sauteed brussels sprouts. Will definitely make again!

Not so great. Didn't have any fish sauce so I skipped it. Perhaps that accounts for the bland flavor. I put some red pepper flakes in the sauce (which tasted spicy) but once divided onto the fish was undetectable.

Excellent dish. I cut down on Cilantro, replaced with some parsley. No chili either, my family does not like hot spicy food. Made this also with trout, Salmon and any fish, it was a success. Instead of parchment, I used glass dish to contain the fish, covered w aluminum foil and baked. It ALWAYS came out delicious.

For the ease this is a knock-out. Did as a weeknight dinner but would do this for guests. Can anyone tell me why 'unbleached parchment paper' is called for? My box of parchment didn't say either way, so used what was on hand. Did seem hard to keep folded closed, wonder if that has something to do with?? Advice please...

This was delicious! I thought I had all the ingredients on hand... but I didn't have any fresh cilantro, so I subbed 1-2 TB of dried cilantro and it still tasted amazing. Can't wait to try it with fresh cilantro!

Fantastic recipe! I cook Tilapia all the time & this is by far the best recipe I've tried. I didn't have grapeseed oil so I used olive oil. I didn't have fresh leaf cilantro so I used approx 1/3 cup of 'fresh tubed' cilantro. I also used approx 1/2 tsp red chili pepper flakes. The entire family gave it "4 forks". Yummy !!

The best part for me is that I'm not a fan of tilapia but this makes such a delicious dish, I can get over myself. I had everything on hand except for the fresh chili so I hit it with chili powder instead and that seemed to meet the need.

This was delicious. I used everything except the chili pepper (my kids don't eat spicy), it was good. Baked it in parchment paper. I would recommend not skipping the chili pepper because I would imagine a little spicy with the touch of sweet would make it even more incredible. I served it with cous cous and asparagus. Delicious and so easy.

This is so delicious and it was much more filling than I thought something so light in calories could have. I used parchment paper and I had to use dry red pepper instead of fresh but it was perfect. I served the fish over brown rice with a salad. So good. I love Tori Amos so that was a plus also!

Nice nice flavoring. I used cjorda suggested measurements -- little too mild for my taste, but gives me a starting point for when I make this again. I'll keep the maple syrup at 2 TB, which was sweet enough for me. I blended all the ingredients for a smoother topping. Wrapped completely in foil & baked 400 degrees for 20 minutes -- perfect. Will definitely make again and not limit it to just tilapia.

Rating: 4
I really really enjoyed this. I made a half recipe, since it was only for me. For this reason, rather than use a small bit of fresh or canned chile or jalapeno, I simply used about 1/2 tsp dried chili pepper. The topping is a fabulously smooth and flavourful concoction. It is subtle but in my opinion the various ingredients really meld well. I will absolutely make this again. Incidentally, this is easily adapted to the 17 day diet - even Cycle 1.

Absolutely delicious!!! I made this recipe with several adjustments: I omitted the chile, fish sauce and maple syrup because I did not have any, and also omitted the soy sauce because of a soy allergy. I blended the ginger, garlic, green onions and cilantro in a food processor with light sesame oil (also didn't have grapeseed or safflower oils) to form a paste that easily spread on top of the fillets. I also did not have banana leaves so put the fish in a glass pyrex dish and followed a reviewers suggestion of covering with aluminum foil and baking for 20 minutes at 375 degrees. The meal came out perfect!! My family and I liked it so much, that I'll definitely make the same adjustments the next time I make it! Served this with bok choy and and the arame-flecked couscous recipe from this website!

Chef Duncan is a genius. Yum!!!! Okay, I've been making this for over a year, and I have some tips and quantities for folks who don't quite know how to interpret "dash" or "inch." Use: 1 heaping T grated fresh gingeroot; 2 t minced jalapeno (reserve separately); 1 t toasted sesame oil; 2 t soy sauce; 1 t fish sauce. Tips: 1) There is a new product called "Martha Wrap". It's Martha Stewart brand. It's foil on one side, parchment on the other. OMG - it is the PERFECT paper for fish-en-pappillotte because the foil side gives you structure and the ability to self-seal. I used to use parchment and use a stapler to seal the packets. 2) RESERVE the jalapeno chile pepper from the sauce. Add it by 1/4 teaspoon increments to individual packets according to the heat preferences of your individual family members. My son can't tolerate ANY chile, but my daughter likes it.

I've made this twice now and my husband and I love it! It is such a unique recipe and there are many strong-flavored ingredients (cilantro, garlic, ginger root, etc.) but all of them seem to compliment each other and no flavor sticks out above the others. Truly a masterpiece recipe. The only change I make is I simply use tinfoil to wrap the fish in. I tried parchment paper and doesn't stay closed as well as plain-ol'-tinfoil.

This is my second rave review of this. I just had to write again after watching my 9-yr-old (fish hater) inhale this dish last night. She loved it; I love it so much I had to add my side dish (quinoa) into the sauce to get the last of it. Skip the banana leaves, foil works fine. Substituted cod for tilapia (because husband bought the wrong thing); worked just as well with a little extra cooking time.

I am always looking for dishes that use tilapia, and I am a fan of pretty much ANYTHING with cilantro in it- so I had to try this recipie. It is very good, and I did everything as stated, except I did not use the fish sauce- and it turned out very good. However, next time I make this, I will be a little more heavy handed with ALL the ingredients.

Gotta agree, this is a keeper. The sweetness from the maple syrup made it kid-friendly too. Didn't have green onions so used leeks which were delicious. Served it with what was on hand: garlic nan and a green salad with fresh figs and bleu cheese. Wonderful, light summer meal.

Rating: 4
This is great, but I added a coating of crushed pistachios and it made the texture amazing. Just dip the fish in egg whites and then roll it in ½ cup crushed pistachios and then add the sauce on top, AMAZING! I also made a puréed plantain side with just a bit of salt, pepper, and chili heated on the stove. Any easy side dish but goes amazing!

Rating: 4
Excellent! Made the recipe just as it stated. The "dash"es part was a little hard to figure, but this is a dish that can stand dashing either a bit too much or a bit too little. I'd be a little braver with my dashes next time. Don't worry about the maple flavor - it's wonderful with the fish. If you need the sauce a little saltier, add salt, not soy or fish sauce.

Rating: 4
I didn't have fish sauce but otherwise made it as the recipe called for. I didn't bother with the leaves or parchment paper and just cooked in aluminum foil. Can't imagine using a syrup other than pure maple syrup-that flavor came through nicely. My filets only needed about 18-20 minutes to cook. My entire family loved it.

Rating: 3
Fast and easy to make. I would recommend upping your usual salt quotient on this one - needs that little kick. I used fresh jalapeños (1/2 for the entire batch) and would double that if no kids were involved. We served it over brown rice cooked in chicken stock with a cucumber and tomato salad for a great, healthy meal. Overall, nice presentation and a fast and easy weeknight meal.

Rating: 4
This was SO easy to make and really good! I didn't have banana leaves or parchment paper, so I folded a piece of aluminum foil over each fish piece and folded the edges over. I used a finely chopped serano chile as suggested by another reviewer (seeds removed), didn't use the sesame oil, and totally FORGOT about the maple syrup! I baked the fish for only 15 minutes, as I has seen some other reviewers comment, and it was great! So easy and tasted really nice! I served it with the "Quinoa with Moroccan Winter Squash" recipe which can be found on this site. It was a healthy, flavorful, spicy combo I would recommend!

My husband, picky 11 year-old daughter & I all loved this. I used a generous splash of soy and fish sauces and added to about 1 1/2 T miso paste. I also reduced the grapeseed oil to about 1 1/2 tsp. I didn't have 1 C of cilantro so used what I had -- about 1/2 C. - didn't have any hot chili peppers, so I just added a few shakes of chili flakes. All liquids (including miso paste) were whisked together before adding to ginger/garlic/cilantro/scallion mix. Served w/brown rice and snow peas. YUM YUM!!

Excellent recipe. I substituted dover sole for the tilapia and it still came out very nice, although a thicker whitefish would have balanced the flavors a little better. Also used one finely diced serano chile (with seeds removed) and it created a perfect sweet-hot balance. Agree with other reviewers - natural maple syrup is a must! Would definitely make again!

This recipe is really easy and delicious. I only used 2 Tilapia fillets but I still used 2 cloves of garlic, 1 1/2 green onions, 1/2 cup cilantro and about 4 tsp maple syrup. I didn't have banana leaf so I just made a tin foil pouch. It came out extremely flavorful and yummy!!

I decided to make this since I had all the ingredients (except the grapeseed oil), even though I don't like maple syrup. I used parchment paper and baked for 20 min, which was great plenty - would probably go for 15 next time. Husband & I liked it, as did 1 of our 2 cats. Didn't think it was any better than several other Tilapia recipes I have. Might try with pineapple juice next time instead of syrup.

Delicious! We really enjoyed this, as did my 4 children. Doubled the recipe, and probably added more soy and fish sauce than 2 "dashes". Also, instead of mixing in the green onions and cilantro, we simply topped each piece of fish with both ingredients after spreading the rest of the mixture on top. That way, we were able to make sure each piece had plenty of cilantro and onions. So flavorful! Did not have banana leaves, nor unbleached parchment. Used regular parchment instead. Also, didn't have dark maple syrup. Just used pancake syrup (nothing special, not "real" maple syrup), and it was great! Easy, and will make for company.

I love Tori Amos and I love this dish! Unbelievable! You do have to be careful with the salt. I got a little carried away with the soy sauce, salt, and added some oyster sauce too. You do have to be careful with the cilantro too. I only used 1/2 cup or so because it can be a very strong herb. Took the advice of another reviewer and had this with coconut rice and broccoli (with the sauce from this recipe).

recipe worked out really well. not sure how people could think this recipe was awful unless they weren't used to asian inspired food. i just used olive oil instead of grapeseed. did not toast the sesame oil, just mixed it all in. added a bigger dash of sesame oil, a little soy and tiny bit of fish sauce..though, the fish sauce may not be necessary at all. make sure the fish sauce is the kind that is almost a clear-golden liquid and not a thick pastey sauce. i found the fish sauce could be a bit overwhelming, so i only added a little. i also substitued brown sugar for maple syrup. taste the sauce before putting it on the fish. if you dont like the way it tastes before you put it on the fish, it probably wont be good even after it's cooked.

We are trying to work more fish into my family's diet, and so I'm working my way thru LOTS of this great site's offerings. This one met with happy faces around the table. A couple of suggestions: be picky about your cilantro; if its wilted, it will be a little bitter. Also, I did the parchment paper version since I didn't have any banana leaves handy (go figure!), and found that spearing that little packet shut with a toothpick was just perfect. Don't forget lemon wedges!

There's always someone in the group who has a different opinion. I have to disagree with the majority of the reviewers. Even though I love cilantro, there was way too much of it. My husband ended up scraping it off of his fish. Also it was way too sweet. I loved the smell of the cilantro mixture before putting in on the fish, but the taste was not what we expected. Poor hubby just came back home from being away for five days, and this is what I made for dinner. Hopefully, the pot roast for tonight will make up for this dish.

This is one of my current favorites; we have it at least once a week, over rice. I just throw all the ingredients in the mini-processor and make that part early (we have two young kids, helps to do it in steps!) and then just coat the fillets and wrap them each up in tin foil. I also don't use maple syrup--sometimes a dash of brown sugar if I remember--and they are still PERFECT! It's hard to beat ginger, garlic, and cilantro together. YUM, YUM, YUM.

Really good. I normally find the recipes on this site ok, a bit extravagant. This one is so easy and unbelievably tasty. The first time I made it, I didn't have maple syrup, so I substituted with brown sugar, yummy. I also ran out of parchment paper, so I put all the fish in one baking dish, poured the marinade over it and rubbed it in, covered it with foil and baked it for 20 min at 400F. Excellent! I also tried it the way they mention, turns out the same my easy way! Happy cooking!

I thought this was a great way to prepare fish for the family, but for me it isn't special enough for a company dish. The flavour was very good and it's really moist. I only baked it for 20 minutes. We don't care for cilantro so I used parsley. I had about twice as much fresh ginger than the recipe called for, and would use that much again. Like some of the other reviewers, I wrapped the fish in parchment paper and sealed the ends with foil. I used the full amount of maple syrup and didn't find it too sweet.

This is a very tasty, easy dinner that's worthy of company. It was too hot a day to turn on the oven, so we wrapped the fish in tin foil pockets and cooked it on the outdoor grill.

This dish is AMAZING. I used a little less maple syrup, parsley (didn't have any cilantro on hand) and forgot the soy sauce - and it still had exquisite flavour. It was a cinch to cook and didn't take much time. I didn't have banana leaves (not sure who keeps these handy in their kitchen) and used parchment paper, wrapping all four filets together in one baking dish (save paper and time). I highly recommend this recipe for fast (hurray!) and healthy cooking (double hurray!!). The added bonus was that I also scored points with my boyfriend who thought the fish was restaurant quality.

Easy to make and delicious. I used only 2 tsp of maple syrup based on some of the reviews but found that all 4 tsp would have been better for a more balanced flavor, and would not have been too sweet. I had to use regular parchment paper instead of non-bleached plus alum. foil and baked for 25 min but 20 would probably be ideal.

This is definitely a great recipe. I've experimented with a number of different ways of making it, and here's what I've found to work best: 1. I use 2 tsp of Sriracha sauce for the chili (having also tried jalapeno and red pepper flakes). 2. I use grapeseed oil (I tried olive, but felt it clashed with the sesame), and reduce the quantity to 4 tsp. 3. I saute the garlic and ginger (in the 4 tsp of oil) before adding the other toppings. 4. I use one whole green onion, sauteing the white part with the ginger and garlic above, and adding the green part afterwards.

Great stuff -- my girlfriend said this was "restaurant quality." Terrific melding of sweet and savory; the maple syrup really adds a lot. I didn't use the chilis, but it was still really good. Used the parchment, which although isn't the same as banana leaves, still gets the fish super tender. Highly recommended!

I have made this dish for a couple of times and they turned out grrreat!! I pretty much follow the recipe as it is; but I skip the chili and I use olive oil and fish soy sauce (from asian store) instead of regular soy sauce and fish sauce. The fish (tilapia) came out moist and delicious. It just melts in the mouth. It is that good.

Simple and delicious! I've been trying to get more fish into my diet and this was the perfect way to do it. I substituted some brown sugar for the maple syrup and it was great. It's become a staple in my house.

I was a little disappointed in this based on the reviews...I found it to be awfully mushy (the texture of the fish) and too sweet. My husband loved it though...I'm not a huge fan of tilapia anyway but thought I would try it again--maybe it is a mushy fish to begin with? I used parchment instead of banana leaves but otherwise, followed directions. I will try again but reduce the syrup...and maybe increase the chili.

This is really nice! I have made this twice now and we used parchment paper and foil and it worked perfectly. The second time I made it, I just threw all the sauce ingredients into the Cuisinart and this helped to meld the flavors together even better -- try it! Also, there is no substitute for the maple syrup in this recipe. We were forced to use Hungry Jack since our maple syrup seems to have disappeared and I missed that flavor. For the chili, we used an entire seeded jalapeno and it gave it a nice heat. Adding this one to the "company good" file!

Its very good - I wrapped it in parchment paper and tinfoil. I would reduce the maple sugar - I think I might try it with some lime juice next time.

I just wanted to expand on my previous review. If you have big banana leaves, cut the banana leaf into a circle the size of the plate you will be serving on and then fold. When you go to serve, the guest can unwrap the leaf and it fits the plate without any excess.

Great recipe! I took the other reviewers advice and cut the maple syrup in half and doubled the recipe for four filets. Use the banana leaves if you are entertaining. A lot of people have never been served an entree with these. Otherwise, parachment paper works just fine. Baked 25 minutes. A definite four forks!

This is a great recipe for a week day meal or for having company over. Extremely tasty! I sometime replace the maple syrup for honey and double the topping recipe at all times (recipe indicates topping for 4 but it's actually just enough for 2). I also skip the chile since there is none in my near-by markets. To speed things up I mix all ingredients together in the cuisinart before adding the cilantro chopped by hand. I highly recommend this recipe to all who are fish lovers or are trying to add some to their diets.

Yum. I will definitly make this again. A little less maple needed I think.

So tasty! I halved the recipe for 2 servings. I might have added a bit more ginger because we love it so much. I also only used olive oil cause it's the only oil I had on hand. I used parchment paper and crimped it with aluminium. The favors blend together beautifully to deliver a delicate and refreshing taste. This will become a regular at my house!

This recipe was delicious and healthy. I have never cooked with some of the ingredients, but I know that there are much added health benefits to all. I did cook a couple of the pieces longer the twenty minutes, my husband and I like it a little crusty on the edges. However, you do need to keep an eye on it. Perhaps some instruction by the website on how to wrap the paper for the new cooks out there.....

Absolutely excellent weeknight meal. It was surprisingly easy to prepare & very flavorful. I had everything on hand & I was able to get banana leaves from the Latino market on the corner. The only modification I made to the recipe was to increase the amount of garlic & ginger & I used habaneros for an added kick. I served this with a recipe for Coconut Gingerroot Rice I found here, which complemented nicely. We will definitely be making this again.

I did not make this receipe tonight but did bake tilapia as recommended by the local fist market. I went in and told them I had never cooked fish, wanted something mild and white. He recommended the tilapia in foil with a little white wine, butter, tarragon. The flavors were good but the fish did not come out nice and white like I expected. There were very dark lines where the spine was and around the edges of the fish. I don't think I over cooked it because I had checked it and the middle was not done and the dark areas were already appearing. Does anyone know what I did wrong? The flavor of the dish was good but the appearance was not appetizing. I wanted a really white fish look.

This is one of my weeknight staples. Quick, easy, and relatively cheap - I use frozen tilapia. I try to give it a bit of a kick with hot chili oil, otherwise it's a little bland.

Made this last night - it was easy and great. I didn't have chiles or scallions, but added a bit of chopped parsley and some crushed, dried red pepper. I folded the parchment over (across the middle and on the top and bottom of the package) so nothing leaked through and the pan was easy to clean. Delightful with jasmine rice and an asian-style salad.

This dish is so flavorful, delicious, if you love asian flavors! Tori Amos has good taste. I did not add cilantro but followed everything else exactly as the recipe requires, and it is now one of my favorite dishes. I would not add cilantro next time because I like it so much just the way it was, and do not want to alter anything (although I like cilantro).

I looked this up quickly before making supper to see if I could do something different with the tilapia we bought. This was so amazingly good and quick that it will become a regular in our weeknight menu. The first recipe I've ever given 4 forks...!

Excellent dish! This one's going in my recipe box! I did not have fresh ginger on hand so I substituted with ginger powder. Also substituted grapseed oil with regular vegetable oil. Did not add cilantro and chile but it still came out delicious! I used parchment paper.

This was very good and easy to prepare. I used chives instead of the green part of green onion, but I really don't think that made much of a difference. I, too, used parchment paper.

This recipe is amazing! I will never make boring tilapia again. I used the parchment paper option, and it worked great. I love the essence of Asian flavor the marinade creates. I am not an experienced cook, so I would recommend this recipe to anyone who wants to impress their friends and family with great flavor and little effort.

Excellent dish, easy and delicious. I omitted the fish sauce and used olive oil instead of grapeseed; parchment worked fine. I cooked it for 25 minutes, and it was perfect, not over or undercooked.
