EXCELLENT!! so moist and tender. I had a real hard time keeping the slow simmer and when all was done it was about 4 hours. I bought a 3# corned brisket and added celery to the veggies. The cabbage was surprising great!!

Rating: 4
I also add whole small or 'B' red potatoes with the carrots. One dish, one pot. The potatoes and carrots are delicious from the juice of the corned beef. I also omitted the thyme and parsley. My irish mother in law always cooked it with just an onion sliced in half and threw away the spice packet. Always delicious and gets rave reviews from everyone.

I have been eating corned beef and cabbage since I was small. My grandmother put the meat in the pot, covered with cold water and simmered with a bay leaf and onions. Later she added a quartered cabbage, carrots, turnip and potatoes. Once the meat is softer, you start adding the veggies. Adding what takes the longest to least in that order for cooking timne. The vegetables add to the flavor I think. I don't like to use the spice packets that come with the beef. When I serve, I strain and separate everything. We then put some of the broth over what we take, add a pat of butter and for me, cider vinegar! That does it. Oh, we don't trim the fat off either as it tastes the best! Not for the diet conscious, but just darned good and simple. The hard part is taking the hours to simmer it!!! Usually mine is done minus several carved off corners.... 8 ^) Also, my grandmother was English. No Irish here, I also make this several times a year. The meat will also shrink by about half size, so be sure to have plenty on hand. It's as simple as boiling water!

I SERVED THIS TO 6 PEOPLE, 5 OF WHOM HAD NEVER HAD CORNED BEEF AND CABBAGE; IT WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL AND ONLY SCRAPS WERE LEFT. I USED THE RECIPE BUT ALSO THAT OF SEVERAL REVIEWERS WHO ADVISED THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONS AND VARIOUS TECHNIQUES TO IMPROVE THE PRODUCT: COOK 4# CORNED BEEF IN BARELY MOVING BROTH FOR 2-3 HOURS DEPENDING ON SIZE OF THE PIECE (I HAD DIVIDED IT EARLIER THINKING TO SERVE IT TO 2, 3 AND 4 PEOPLE AT DIFFERENT TIMES; THEN AN OPPORTUNITY AROSE IN A BLIZZARD TO SERVE 8 SO I TOOK THE EXTRA PIECES OUT OF THE FREEZER). I ADDED A SPLASH OF VINEGAR, 1 TBSP BROWN SUGAR, 2 BAY LEAVE AND 1/2 TSP. BLACK PEPPER CORNS ALONG WITH SPICES PROVIDED IN CORNED BEEF PACKAGE, WHICH WERE PRIMARILY MUSTARD AND PEPPER. I PUT THE 3 ONIONS IN AFTER THE FIRST HOUR, 1 PINT OF CARROTS AFTER AN HOUR AND A HALF, AND ADDED THE SLICED CABBAGE FOR THE LAST 20 MINUTES. I TOOK EACH PIECE OF MEAT OUT ONCE IT WAS TENDER AND I COULD STICK A SKEWER IN EASILY, REFRIGERATED IT AND THEN CUT THE FAT OFF BEFORE SLICING AND ADDING IT TO REHEAT IN THE LAST 5 MINUTES. I SERVED THE RESULTS WITH DIJON MUSTARD AND SIRACHA SAUCE (WHICH EVERYONE WHO LIKED SPICY ENJOYED). I MADE BISCUITS,MULTIGRAIN BREAD AND BLACK RUSSIAN RYE. I PUT THE BROTH IN A PITCHER SO THEY COULD DECIDE WHICH ITEMS THEY WOULD MOISTEN. FABULOUS! Read More http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/notes/Corned-Beef-with-Cabbage-241775#ixzz2KXNtQnGv

This was the second time I have made corned beef and cabbage for St Patty's Day. The first time was so average that I almost didn't try it again. This recipe was a huge hit. I used beef stock rather than water and simmered for 4.5 hours, but otherwise followed the recipe. I have saved this to use for years to come.

My own corned beef is on the stove cooking away. I follow what she does except my pot isn't big enough to add the veggies. Because my pot is small, I turn it about every 30 mins for even cooking. Since the recipe isn't clear as to the intent of the veggies I rated it 3 forks. On another note, I have read several reviews that said it is impossible to screw up corned beef. I disagree. My church hosts an outreach lunch each week. The discussion this past week was among the ladies (age say 70+) who had never cooked corned beef in their lives. They didn't have a clue as to how long to cook it. All day was the frequent answer. This may be a very basic recipe for many of us, but it is a whole new world for those who have rarely been exposed to cooking corned beef.

If you need a recipe for corning beef then go to foodnetwork.com. Alton Brown has a wonderful recipe for producing your own corned beef at home. It takes 10 days to make it so plan ahead. Cook's Illustrated (online) also has a simpler and slightly less time-consuming recipe, but it still takes 5 - 7 days to make.

This is answering the review - "What does the recipe mean by "freshly made mustard"? by graceross from Ottawa on 03/16/11" In the UK and Ireland, we often 'make up' English mustard from Colman's Mustard Powder and water. Just place a bit of the powder from that ubiquitous yellow tin in a small dish, stir in enough water so it becomes a creamy consistency and allow to sit for a bit (allows the mustard to absorb the water and 'firm up'.) English mustard is HOT and has a wonderful bite. Freshly made is nothing like the stuff from a jar. Try it. It's a world away from yellow French's or Gulden's spicy brown.

This was delicious. I added extra cabbage and it worked just fine, I didn't however add enough onions which next time I will for sure. I tend to like things a bit less salty and this was in my area of tastes but I did get one comment that it should be saltier. Keep it in mind if your friends like that sort of thing. I'll probably use this again next year.

Cooked over 80 lbs of corned beef using this recipe for catering St. Patrick's Day at a tavern. The recipe was delicious, simple and comforting - a hit! Served it with mashed yukon gold potatoes in their jackets and quickly braised cabbage (to keep the cabbage on the crisper side). I melted 1/2 c butter on the griddle, added 2 heads thinly sliced cabbage and cooked a bit, adding about 2 cups corned beef stock and seasoned w/ salt & pepper. I'm already hired for next year's festivities based on these recipes.

These comments are insane. Take the corned beef out of the plastic wrap. Drain the juices. Throw the corned beef into a pot of cold water. Bring to a boil. Lower to a simmer. Skim off the grey muck. Take out of the pot when fork tender (a few hours depending on size of corned beef). Rest under tin foil for 15 -20 minutes. Slice against the grain. Serve. I mean brown sugar, Guiness, garlic, slathering in mustard? What king of cooking freaks post here.

To the cook from the Philippines: The ingredient list calls for "Corned Beef Brisket." The "corned" part indicates that it already has been brined or pickled. If it called for just "Beef Brisket" then you would have to brine it yourself.

Love this recipe. I made Corned Beef and Cabbage for the first time this year for St. Patty's day. It was delicious. I liked it better than some of the restaurant corned beef and cabbage that I had. I'm keeping this recipe in my tool chest as my go-to recipe for corned beef and cabbage. Yumm....!

Thanks to other reviewers for the great tips! I pretty much followed the recipe, but instead of just using water, I used two bottles of guiness in addition to water. I also added 3-4 cloves of garlic. I also slathered the meat in a paste of spicy mustard and brown sugar, which I really loved! Rather than boiling the potatoes I roasted them with whole cloves of garlic, onions, and carrots and parsnips. My cabbage got too mushy--next time I'll only steam it for 15 min or so. Really easy recipe and relatively low-mess. Winner!!

Wanted to thank the Epicurious community for some fantastic recommendations. This was absolutely the best I've ever had and will be repeated next year if not before. Here's the variation on the theme I used: 2.75 lb. brisket placed in cast-iron enameled pot with 4-5 small onions halved/skins on; 2 celery stalks with leaves, 3-4 fresh thyme sprigs. I filled the pot with water up to about 1/2 the height of the brisket. I let it go in a 285 degree oven for about 3 hours. Added potatoes and carrots to the pot and cooked for 1 hour longer. Removed potatoes and carrots and brisket from pot. Quartered cabbage and added to pot and brought to a boil on stove top/covered so I could use broiler. Cabbage took about 15 minutes to cook. Fantastic flavor since is was cooking with all the juices from the brisket/potatoes/carrots. Added spicy mustard and brown sugar to the top of brisket and broiled to form a nice crust. It took about 3-4 minutes once the broiler was hot. WOW! Fantastic!!

What does the recipe mean by "freshly made mustard"?

Rating: 3
I used this method in the past and decided that cooking the veggies with the beef may have added flavour but ended up becoming sodden and shapeless. I now braise the corned beef with beer and pickling spice alone. I boil the veggies(carrots, small white onions, baby red potatoes) in separate batches in water on top of the stove until al dente while the meat is cooking. I strain the veggies with a slotted spoon and add coarsely chopped cabbage to the boiling water just long enough to have it wilt. I melt 1/2 stick of butter and add lots of dill weed, then pour it over the cooked veggies. The taste is fresher and the dill is a wonderful contrast. I think I will try broiling the corned beef technique at the end with the sugar and mustard as a change..

After reading many reviews of the recipe, I decided to try it for Saint Pattie's day (SPD we will be busy, so I made it today) with a few modifications compiled from the suggestions in the prior reviews. (listed at the end) The results were wonderful. A tender, delicious, nearly falling apart corned beef with a cabbage that was flavorful and still firm. As for the complaints that the veggies in the original recipe were too over cooked -- I do not believe that the original 4 hours of cooking of the carrots and onions with the meat were meant for "eating". They were there to impart flavor. ------------------- Use one bottle of hard cider (woodchuck/strongbow) with the water to cover the meat while simmering. Add mustard seeds & coriander seeds. In the last 15 minutes, remove the meat, turn up the heat under the pan, and add quartered cabbage. put meat in roasting dish fat up, smear with mustard, and roast under broiler for 8-10 minutes excellent with roasted potatoes

2 forks as written but can be a 4 fork meal. I agree with all the others who say that is too much time to cook the veggies. I have experimented and found the best way to cook a brisket is in a pressure cooker, with about 6 oz of good beer and your choice of spices. I use about 15 minutes per pound of beef. Cook the vegetables separate, root veggies first in and last out maybe 45 minutes for potatoes and 25 min for the quartered cabbage, carrots and onions somewhere between per your preference.

My Irish-American mother,who learned it from her Immigrant-American mother taught me, or rather I watched and was allowed to peel the vegetables. When I was younger I learned how to corn beef as a butchers apprentice too. In those earlier/bygone days it was necessary to bath the pieces overnight in water in the fridge to desalinate it (cold water draws the salt out). Not generally necessary today I think. But always simmer the beef alone for three hours (very low simmer) with herbs and spices. And actually remove the brisket to cook the vegetables: potatoes and carrots for around 40 minutes, cabbage for about the last twenty. The broth is served on the meat and vegetables, and if your like me some more later in a cup. Don't leave every thing in the broth. It makes a mush and ruins tomorrows lunch. Don't cook it with mustard! Serve it,and ketchup on the side with Caraway seeded rye bread.

Corned beef and cabbage is still very widely eaten in Newfoundland. There it's more commonly known as Jiggs Dinner. Soak the beef in water over night and cook for 2-3 hours. Then add vegetables to cook until tender.

Rating: 0
So maybe it's just me but I assume the carrots and onions are for flavor, not expecting to eat the carrots after 2 hours cooking. This is what I've always done except I add some pickling spices, not the packet that comes with the corned beef. If you want carrots/potatoes with the cabbage throw them in a bit sooner than the cabbage. I prefer to cook the potatoes separately for a better flavor contrast.

I tried the method from this recipe last year and it ruined my corned beef! It was tough and inedible even though I simmered it at a moderately low temp on the stove top. Veg turns to mush as people say I won't make it on the stove top again. But........Here's what I did the second time around: This year I used a DIFFERENT METHOD suggested by some other reviewers and the results were much better! I braised the corned beef brisket in my Le Creuset cast iron pot with the lid on at a very low temp. {285} for 5 hours and it came out tender and eatable. I also used another tip from a reviewer, after the corned beef was done braising I put it on a cookie sheet fat side up and sliced part of the layer of fat off across the top leaving a thin layer of fat across the top. Then I spread spicy brown mustard over the fat, then sprinkled generously with brown sugar and put under the broiler for a minute or two. {you have to watch it or sugar will burn fast}. The results were delicious! I will braise it then broil it with mustard and brown sugar every year from now on. I also used some one's suggestion of adding beer so I used Yuengling Black and Tan,to braise it in. Bad idea because it made the juices and vegetables bitter.

I honestly can't give this recipe forks because I made some significant changes... that said, it really was absolutely delicious. Per other reviews... added peppercorns, bay leaf, coriander seeds, and beer to the boiling liquid. Simmered 2.15 lbs for 2 hours, added onions and carrots and simmered another 15 minutes, removed the meat and added cabbage and simmered final 15 minutes. Served with Darina's champ + soda bread and it was heavenly. So much better than I ever thought a boiled dinner could be... will definitely make next March 17!

Sorry, but corned beef and cabbage are too easy to mess up, and this one makes complete mush out of the vegies. No way should the carrots need that much time, nor the cabbage. And come on, a recipe needs to be a little more specific than "1 to 2 hours." Approximately 50 minutes per pound, folks. That's the formula.

This is a great basic recipe. However, I use a bottle of beer (Harp is my choice, and produces a milder flavor than stout), a bay leaf, and then add water to cover. I also add the veggies later and simmer for about 45 minutes, otherwise they are a bit too soft.

I actually do not like my corned beef boiled. Around my house, I cook the corned beef just like I would an oven roast. I put the corned beef in my covered roaster, add water until it comes half-way up the roast, and cook at 300* for 2 hours. Then I add the carrot chunks, waxy potatoes, and of course, 2 quartered cabbages (my son complains if I only cook 1- he loves it this way) I then bake it for about another hour and a half or so- until the potatoes are done. It is great this way- the meat has tons of flavor, and is not mushy or tough at all. The vegis have lots of flavor as well, since they were not boiled to death.

I absolutely cannot imagine recommending that anyone simmer a corned beef at all, much less for more than a minute or two until you catch it and turn the heat down. Keep it UNDER anything resembling a boil or it will be dry, tough, and flavorless.

OK-as Emeril would say, let's take it up another notch! This recipe is how I always cook it, with three slight modifications. First, I add small new (waxy variety) potatoes 45 min. before meat is done & I don't add the cabbage but wait till the brisket is completely cooked. Remove it & place it in shallow ovenproof dish. Place carrots & potatoes in ovenproof covered casserole & keep warm on back of stove. Cook cabbage (it only takes 15-20 minutes to cook-nothing worse than overcooked cabbage...ask Julia Child). Now back to the meat. Spread top (fatty side) with spicy mustard & sprinkle with brown sugar. Run under broiler for 5-10 minutes to crisp up the fat. Slice & arrange on platter surrounded by all those lovely veggies. I also agree with those who suggest including the spice packet & using beer/stout to replace some of the water.

Good basic recipe. If you really want a fantastic addition to this dish, try this parsley gravy: Parsley Gravy " 1 stick of butter (4 oz / 110 g) " 4 tablespoons flour " 6 cups strained corned beef broth " ½ cup chopped parsley " Dollop horseradish " salt, to taste " pepper, to taste In a heavy bottomed pot or skillet, melt the margarine or butter. Sprinkle over with flour and stir to combine well with the fat. It will form a paste. Cook this over medium-low heat till it starts to brown slightly and smells nutty. Using a whisk, beat in a cup of strained broth at a time. Let the sauce come to a boil, whisking all the while. If the sauce seems too thick, add more strained broth. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and horseradish. Serve hot. I'm told it is also delicious with half buttermilk and half corned beef broth

I make this recipe on St Patricks day and Easter. I make my own corned beef by the instuctions on the menu. (I don't use pickling spice, only salt.) I break the carrots by hand into large pieces so that they are not mushy. I deviate from the recipe only in that I add 8-9 peeled Yukon Gold potatoes with the carrots and onions. This recipe is awesome, my whole family loves it. By far the best corned beef recipe I have ever tasted.

I had to corn my own beef as it only comes in cans here. I followed the instructions in the menu (just lots of salt and pickling spice in water for 24-36 hours). I too kept the carrots and cabbage out of the pressure cooker until the end to keep them from going mushy. Nice to have fresh corned beef, served with three kinds of mustard, and some Guinness.

I agree about adding peppercorns or the packet ingredients sometimes found in the package. Also, another reason for using the pressure cooker is, it does not shrink as much as slowcooking. I use a 6 qt. size. but I buy the biggest piece I can. I cook the veggies in the same liquid after removing the meat for more flavor.

Corned beef & cabbage is essentially the same as what is called a New England Boiled Dinner. It is similar to the ordinary, every day Irish dish of bacon & cabbage ("bacon" means a cut of preserved pork; here we might use shoulder or "picnic ham."). All these dishes involve boiled meats. I am puzzled as to why respondents here seem to be fixated on using a pressure cooker. Time aside, there is no need to use a pressure cooker. In fact, there is reason to not use one: Corned beef can be very, very salty. If you are not sure of how salty your beef is, because you have never had the corned beef of a particular processor/brand before, then you might need to bring the beef to a boil from cold, drain & rinse, and repeat. Alternatively, you would soak the beef in cold water for some hours to leech out some of the salt. Oh, to follow up from "nabarda from Austin": in the British Isles, Patty is female, Paddy is male. Both the spelling and the pronunciation are different. So, if you must shorten Patrick/Padraig, it is not Patty's Day, but Paddy's, as in "paddy wagon."

for Solea, in the Philippines: If you google "corning beef, Julia Child", you'll get to a Julia recipe for corning beef, which I believe is the same as the recipe in her "Julia Child & Company" (1978). The JC recipe produces New England style corned beef, which is gray, not red. (The red corned beef has been cured with salt petre, not table salt.) It is very good, and it is not hard to do, but the meat has to sit in the brine for about 2 weeks. The most popular cut seems to be brisket, but round is also common. Corned brisket is often sold as "flat cut"--that is, only a couple of inches high and quite long. If you cook brisket, try to cut across the grain to get smooth slices: it may take a bit of cutting tiny slices to be sure you're choosing the right direction to cut in.

I have never made a corned beef before, but would like to try it this year. I plan to use others advice about using a slow cooker/crockpot (no pressure cooker).

For those who are interested in a great simple recipe for St. Patty's day, I recommend the 1965 one by James Beard.

This is a good recipe. I am from Ireland and the Irish corned beef called "silverside" is definitely superior to what we get here. I used the online retailer Darina recommended last year and received a big glob of fatty meat which I threw in the bin. Unless I am gravely mistaken, it is the same as the one she recommends this year. I did e-mail them on receipt and expressed my disappointment and heard nothing further. I replaced it with corned beef from Costco.

I only had mini carrots, and they were very nice. I used one regular and one large, sweet onion. I always add 3 cloves of garlic, and a bay leaf. I also added about 8 Yukon Gold potaotes, unpeeled and cut into edible chunks. After I added the cabbage and cooked as said, I tasted, and then added 2T. wine vinegar - had no cider, and one finely sliced and peeled apple. Had no parsley, so added fresh dill that comes up even in winter here in PA! After a while, I tasted, and added salt, cracked pepper and hot pepper flakes. Finally, I added plain yogurt, about 4 T. It gets better everyday!!

I don't have a pressure cooker, so I tried it as per the recipe. The beef turned out super tasty, but I'd suggest not putting the cabbage in for as long as the recipe says you should. My cabbage had no bite left to it and was essentially mush. I didn't add potatoes to this recipe (as I also made Champ), but my mother used to add the potatoes when she made it for us years ago and they were always fantastic that way. I think some peppercorns in the broth as the cook from Camarillo, CA suggested, would be a good idea too. Slainte!

We had this dish for our St. Patrick's Day dinner party this Sunday. I had bought a 2.50 lb.corned beef.(for 4 people) Using the pressure cooker method,(recommended by chefs who reviewed this recipe) I cooked the onions, mustard, beef and carrots for 45 min then turned off flame, let the pot sit until steam reduced after about 15 min then added a head and a half of organic cabbage cut in wedges and half a large bag of whole fingerling potatoes. Many more veggies than suggested. I recommend that carrots should be added in at the same time as potatoes (not earlier). I almost covered the beef with water but not quite . Lastly, I cooked the final ingredients for over an hour or more and let it sit, flame off, in the pot until guests arrived. Results were fantastic! The beef came out beyond delicious with perfect consistency and flavor. The potatoes were dreamy, smooth and whole, little wonders and just the right texture...cabbage turned to mush but was tasty like a creamy spread. Next time I would put the cabbage in quite a bit later which would mean a third opening and de-steaming of the pot. We served the beef with mustards of all types and Irish soda bread, baguettes, and even moist sweet ,cornberead made with creamed corn, etc.Also served a large broccoli, french green bean, romaine & hearts of palm salad. Broth from cooking was savory and salty and I stored it to use to heat up leftovers in. Dessert was a double lemon meringue pie. A very easy and rewarding dinner I will definitely cook more than once a year!

I agree about the pressure cooker. That's the way my mother and grandmother always made it, and it was fabulous. Unfortunately I lost custody of mine when I got a divorce! This recipe is identical to my family recipe with two exceptions: we always add our potatoes into the pot to cook during the last part of cooking,and believe me, nobody in Texas, Irish or not, used fresh thyme in the '50s. I don't know where you could get the lovely floury boiling potatoes they have in Ireland here in the U.S., but trust me, they're wonderful. Note to person in Italy: It's a beef brisket that you rub and marinate with pickling spices, coarse salt,peppercorns and other spices until it's "corned".

"Floury" potatoes are mealy ones like american russett or other baking potatoes (from a cookbook I bought in Ireland). As opposed to "waxy" or new potatoes like red potatoes. Yukon golds are in the middle, more all purpose. On the pressure cooker issue, my mom always used one and the corned beef was great, but I've made it simmering in water since I don't have a pressure cooker and it took much longer but still tasted good. Had to add extra pickling spice and salt to compensate for all the water, though.

Now, now, "cook from Vineland, N.J.", you're getting a little chippy are you not?! No need for that...this is just good conversation between cooks, besides, the fork rating tells me whether it's liked or not. Have a nice glass of wine and chill already :0)

In absence of pressure cooker, which would be best (excluding veggies)? covered crock pot on slow or uncovered big pot on low (w/liquid covering meat)?

Good recipe, but have to agree with others, the pressure cooker is definitely the way to go with corned beef. Shorter cooking time, much better flavor. Any size pressure cooker that will hold all the ingredients should be fine. I use a huge old canning pressure cooker that belonged to my grandmother. Note: If you decide to try pressure cooking a corned beef, I suggest you use the phased method. Cook the roast alone with liquid (I like to add a teaspoon of cumin, yum!) for about 40 minutes, then add the veggies, get back up to pressure and cook for 10 more minutes. Your veggies otherwise will be mush. Make plenty, the leftovers are heavenly, too!

A "floury potato" would be a King Edward or a Maris Piper.

This is the same recipe I've used for years. Love it! I serve it with mashed potatoes-- not sure what "floury" potatoes are?

recipe says to serve with "floury potatoes", what are those? Also, the recipe for Corned Beef & Fontina Sandwiches sounds great!

To shandragalloway - I don't know if you'll be able to find it in Italy, but you want to use gray, flat cut corned beef brisket. Also check out the 1965 (!) recipe on this site

I used a slow cooker/crockpot. Cooked on low for 6 hrs and added the cabbage halfway through it was great!

I haven't made this yet but would like to for St.Pats day. I live in Italy and have to describe what kind of meat I want from the butcher. Is it salted? Anyone helpful tips of the cut of meat would be much appreciated.

Did you people like the recipe or not? No one asked about your pressure cooker.

I have been cooking corned beef in my pressure cooker for years now and agree with the previous reviewers regarding the better taste and texture. Now corned beef that is boiled tastes "washed out" to me. Pressure cookers work great for a lot of long- cooking dishes such as pot roast and spaghetti sauce, so no need to purchase one just for the corned beef!

Every St Patricks Day I conjure up visions of eating corned beef and cabbage for dinner. Then I wonder What wine goes with corned beef and cabbage? The corned beef is too salty and doesnt work with any wine very well. Someone yells to me that beer is more in order.

Delicious as written but can be improved upon. A group of friends enjoy corned beef & cabbage about 4-5 times a year and we decided to conduct an experiment. A blind taste test. We baked, boiled (as with this recipe) and pressure cooked (steamed) 3 identical briskets. The unanimous (8/8) winner was the pressure cooked version with vegetables cooked separately. Better texture and better flavor in the meat and the veggies weren't "greasy". The big plus was the pressure cooker reduced the cooking time to roughly 2 hrs. total.

If you own a pressure cooker - use it. If not, go and buy one. It makes a huge difference when making corned beef. Cook it 2 hours or so, with carrots, onions, (turnips, parsnips if you like) then add cabbage for last 15 minutes.

This is a fabulous recipe, far better, more flavorful and easier than the "modern" method of cooking the veggies at the last minute to keep "crisp." Here the flavors blend beautifully and the dish sings out with flavor. Don't forget the dry mustard, or to have some reconstituted along with the beef itself.
