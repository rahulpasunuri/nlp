I don't know if I got my polenta crutons crunchy enough...this recipe is okay, but not sure I'd make it again.

Delicious salad. I substituted feta for the mozzarella and topped the salad with grilled chicken marinated in balsamic vinaigrette. I cooked the tomatoes for about 8 minutes total, and would actually have preferred them raw. The polenta croutons really made the dish.
