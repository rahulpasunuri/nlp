Great base recipe. I didn't have any fresh carrots or celery, but I did have fresh sage and tomatoes from the garden. Doubled the pancetta, added a generous squeeze of a tomato/celery/carrot puree paste from a tube and threw in a piece of parmigiano reggiano rind that I had in the freezer in the last 10 minutes or so. DELICIOUS!

I don't see how you can cook the vegetables for ten minutes using only two ounces of pancetta and no oil without burning. I'm not going to try this one.

Great flavor. I used fresh chopped roma tomatoes (seeded) and a little extra broth. Served it with grilled veal chops and penne pasta. Buon appetito!

this worked great. also used fresh sage instead of dry. there is a much more workintensive dish like this on epicurious (cooking the white beans in sage water first etc.) and it's really not worth all that effort if you can have almost the same taste in less than an hour.

Delicious, and even better on day two! Almost like a thick thick soup. My husband who is a huge pasta fagiole fan absolutely loved these. I had some fresh sage so I used it, about eight leaves sliced super thin. Worked nicely. Served with Beer Brined Grilled Pork Chops: http://www.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=105298 Good dinner.

A very good bean dish. I made it to accompany a garlic and rosemary-studded pork roast, and the sage flavor paired nicely with these sage-y beans. They get even better as leftovers, when the flavors have melded even further. Pure Tuscany!
