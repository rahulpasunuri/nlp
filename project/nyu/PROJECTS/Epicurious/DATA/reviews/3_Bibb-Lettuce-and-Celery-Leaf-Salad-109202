This is an easy and interesting twist on the leafy greens salad. I make this salad with a lemon-shallot vinagrette, using the juice of 1/2 lemon and olive oil instead of the red wine vinegar / hazelnut oil indicated, as I find the lemon nicely complements and enhances the fresh taste of the celery leaf.
