I used instead steelhead filets from Costco. This is a simple recipe to follow and the pecan topping is quite tasty. Doesn't involve too many ingredients to make. A winner !

While very easy to prepare, this dish didn't have a "wow" factor. We served it with a corn bread salad with buttermilk lime dressing, which was a nice combination. I cut the butter in half and still found it a bit overwhelming, although the texture of the fish was perfect.

Yummy, I was going to make some simple baked fish dish with tom. & olives and asked Ma the shopper to get cod, scrod or trout thinking she would come home with some inexpensive simple white fish. Instead she got a whole pound of rainbow trout fillets-pressure, never made trout before. Because they were fillets I changed the amount of butter and oil, you can really use a lot less.I also used unsalted butter and had no fresh parsley, how sad. Cooked the fillets 3 minutes each side (maybe a little less) but it was delish and Ma said if she ever needed to order a last meal this would be it, served with rice and sauted fresh string beans.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and used Panko bread crumbs and flour. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. I also served a dish of wild rice with pecans, dried cranberries and apricots, along with a pear and roquefort salad. I received a beautiful bouquet of roses the next day. Need I say more? I think not.

This recipe is wonderful. The pecan butter sauce gives a fantastic aroma of cooked pecans. My wife who is not a seafood fan loved it. Definitely a do again.

It was only OK. Lots of fat and the point of eating fish is health reasons. Although it was very moist, there was just not much flavor other than the sauce.

This is such a great recipe. Fresh trout is so wonderful simply grilled on its own with olive oil and s/p, and to find a recipe like this which only makes it better.... well... how lucky we are! You must use unsalted butter, otherwise, as below reviews will confirm, it ends up too salty. I liked the suggestion of using cornmeal and flour combined to form the crust, but I didn't have cornmeal so I used Panko instead. YUM. Crispy, tasty, and the pecan butter is to die for -- not so much a sauce as a topping. It went on the steamed rice, too, so I wish I'd doubled the amounts. Basically, there is absolutely no need to change a thing if you don't want to -- just watch the salt issue. Enjoy -- it's fabulous.

This was easy and delicious. I bought the whole trout, but decided to slice off the head and tail, and debone the fish before cooking. The fish presented beautifully, tasted wonderful, and the pecan butter sauce was heavenly. I will definitely make this again.

I made this with trout filet. Used a flour and corn meal mix with a touch of thyme. Made a note of other reviews regarding salt and only add a pinch here and there. It was tasty and easy.

Oh my how delicious. Never made a whole fish before - turned out great. Didn't have pecans so used pine nuts. Would agree with the other reviewer below that it would probably be a touch too salty with pecans cause it was pretty salty with the pine nuts and pine nuts were not salted. Will definitely make again, but not too often - can't have that much butter - it'll kill you!

My wife thought that the pecan sauce was too salty. I liked it, but I'll probably reduce the salt next time.

I loved this - worth the work of dealing with fish bones! The trout had a great flavor, not greasy at all. I may have used cilantro instead of flat-leafed parsley, it was delicious anyway!

This is a simple way to make a whole trout, tastes good, not too much work, and gives you the feeling that you just caught the fish out of the river. It's not the kind of fish you invite a whole bunch of people over to eat though- a good every day meal type of recipe. I'll definitely make it again.
