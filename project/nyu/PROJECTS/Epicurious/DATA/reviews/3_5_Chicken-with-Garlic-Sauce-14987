I love this chicken, but it is VERY garlicky...and that is why I love it! I can only cook this when I find myself dining alone because no one else in the house likes garlic as much as I do. To the cook in Apple Valley, WOW you doubled the garlic? That would be intense.

This recipe is greatly improved by adding judicious amounts of saffron, flour and salt, and decreasing stock to no more than two cups. Think Spanish. Indeed, instead of flour or perhaps in addition to it, one might add pulverized almonds for a slightly different texture and taste.

This was very tasty. The chicken was moist and flavorful. The sauce was very good over the garlic rice I had with it. I made it for guests and they said it was definitely a keeper recipe!

I happened to have minced garlic in a jar, regular white wine instead of cognac, dried rosemary, and bottled lemon, but this still came out very nicely. Reducing the sauce is the key, and don't overcook the chicken. A definite keeper.

I gave this two forks because my kids and hubby liked it but I wasn't overly impressed. It tasted o.k. but I found it a lot of work for o.k. plus with brandy and whipping cream this was pretty expensive for just a mid week dinner. So..... not special enough for company but not worth the work and money for just everyday. I don't think I will make this again.

This is absolutely delicious! And it has a wonderful aroma. I agree the sauce is a bit thin, but it is ok. I don't think I would like it thickened. Served the chicken with rice - the sauce was good on that too!

This was a very tasty recipe. My 2 yr old, loved it. The sauce could be put on veggies as well. We doubled the garlic and my husband thought the sauce could be a little thicker, but I wouldn't change a thing. YUMMY!!!

Excellent flavor. Sauce was a bit thin. If I make it again I will thicken slightly with arrowroot.
