A pretty and refreshing dessert to follow a spicy entree. I served it after the delicious cioppino also on this site. Since I was cooking alone, I appreciated the ease of being able to prepare it in advance. I served it with almond cookies. Glad I wasn't deterred by the other reviewer's low rating.

This recipe just didn't come together for me. I got a "this is interesting" response from my husband. I won't make it again.
