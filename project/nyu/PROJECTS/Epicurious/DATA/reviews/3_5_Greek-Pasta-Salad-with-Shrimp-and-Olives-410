Very delicious salad! I decided not to go with fresh garlic,because some people in my family do not eat it. Instead, I sauteed shrimp with garlic in 2 tablespoons on olive oil. Dried thyme is too fragrant for this type of salad - I substituted with a dash of fresh oregano and little bit of fresh basil. And I used fusilli instead of linguine. For better taste, let it chill for at least 2 hours.

Followed the recipe for the most part and I used wine and lemon juice and grilled the shrimp. Everyone (all 10 of us) thought it was delicious.

A good one dish meal. Recommend doubling the shrimp and adding kalamata olives and artichoke hearts. I thought the garlic would fight with the feta so I skipped the garlic entirely.

I first sent a review to to another shrimp pasta recipe instead of this one!! I used De Bols gluten free penne paste, I used an entire package of Athens basil and tomato feta,(8 oz) added 1/2 tsp oregano and used 1/2 cup of fresh basil, also sauteed the shrimp in Emerils essence, added lemon zest from the lemons, balsamic vinegar instead of wine,orange pepper instead of red,and felt it needed some black pepper and salt at the end. Very colorful and tasty.Next time I will try fresh mozzerella and parmesan instead of the feta. I think parmesan makes pasta salads come alive. Very good. I am bringing it to a friend for dinenr (I have to bring my own food since I can't have wheat)

I made this exactly according to the recipe - the first time. The second, I substituted oregano for the thyme, and chicken for the shrimp. Simply wonderful!

I have made this recipe a number of times, and it is always great, and greatly enjoyed. Some additions I've made from time to time, asperagus, capers, fresh basil, green and black olives, fresh peas, and artichoke hearts. It adds variety if you make it often, and it uses the kitchen. As is, the recipe is teriffic. A standard summer meal.

I really love that the dressing has no vinegar; much easier to match with wine (preferably the same as in the dressing). Top-quality tomatoes and olives seem to be the key here. Didn't add the shrimp as I was serving it with grilled seafood (excellent). I like the linguini, but other pasta such as fusilli would probably work well. Garnish with some whole romaine leaves for those folks who don't understand salad without lettuce.

I have been making this recipe since 2000. I also have substituted : cherry tomatoes, added capers which adds to the sour taste with the feta. I always use rigatoni or penne pasta. It is a fantastic recipe

I adapted this recipe for a quick dinner, using what was in my pantry and fridg. Vegies included white onion, cukes, sun dried tomatoes, celery, garlic and kalamata olives (pitted). I also added peels of parmaggiano type cheese (label was long gone, and i dont remember the exact type). Used macaroni for the pasta. Combined all the vegies, tossed in the pasta, dressed with a red wine, oregano and olive oil vinaigrette. Sauted the shrimp (diced while raw to reduce cooking time) in olive oil, lemon juice and garlic. It came out so wonderfully, I couldnt wait to eat until hubby came home! And I'm grateful that he's Italian because he wont be tharted by the garlic breath resulting from this recipe ;)

I made a couple changes to this recipe because I was lacking in some ingredients, and it was amazing. I used penne pasta, substituted red onions for the green, and I omitted the shrimp and garlic (I acutally just forgot to add the garlic, but it was great even without it.) The result was a light, delicious Greek salad that my guests raved about. I will definitely make this again.

This one of my summer recipe staples. However, I've made changes that I think improve the recipe. I use grape or cocktail tomatoes, pitted kalamatas, increased amount of shrimp, tri-color rotini pasta and most importantly, I make the dressing separately and add at the end.

I make a similar one, however, I use couscous, made with of 1 cup of chicken broth instead of linguini, Berstine's olive and oil vinegarette instead of the wine and olive oil, and also add chopped cucumber. The more it marinates the better it gets.

My friends and family love this cold salad. I also added the kalamata olives, fresh basil, sweet onion and red, green, yellow and orange peppers. Yummy. I't great as a leftover the next day (when there are any!!) I also used roasted garlic instead of fresh. It gives it a wonderful flavor.

Not the best I've had recently. The marinade was lacking in flavour. If I make this again I'll try sundried tomatoes as suggested, maybe throw in some artichoke hearts and use tri-coloured bow-tie pasta instead.

this is a yummy recipe but definitely needed help. I marinated the shrimp with all of the ingredients (except the feta) for about 2 hours. tossed the hot linguine (next time, i'll use celletani or orechiette) with the feta so it coated the pasta. I think next time I would use a yellow pepper too, for the visual.

Wonderful!! Just plain wonderful!!

Wonderful warm-weather fare! Didn't have enough kalamata olives to make 1/2 a cup, so I made up the difference with sun-dried tomatoes. Mmmmmmm. Recommend letting recipe sit for the prescribed 30 minutes if dried herbs are used so they are less "crunchy," but feel free to eat right away (warm) if fresh herbs are substituted.

My girlfriend's pure Greek grandparents loved it. It went over real well with them. I will be making this every month. I added more wine to give it more of a punch. And along with the olives just because I like them. Make sure you have breath mints afterwards, you'll need them.

My family and I love this recipe. We have never made this recipe cold as well prefer it warm and think it is super and very easy to prepare.

Excellent one dish meal. I've made it twice and used pitted kalamata olives, oregano instead of thyme, balsamic vinegar instead of wine.

I was pleasantly suprised by this recipe and will definitely make it again. An excellent change of pace, very easy, and a perfect cold dish for summer. Great as a main course and even better the next day for lunch.

Last minute company enjoyed this easy salad. It was great the next day for a quick lunch. I didn't have peppers, so substituted roasted red peppers from a jar - less crunchy but still favourful. Will do again for a outdoor party this weekend.

Excellent pasta salad and easy to make. I did make a few changes...I used tri-color spirals instead of linguine, added a bit of chopped english cucumber and a small red onion. I also bought feta soaked in olive oil so I just dumped in the whole lot of feta and oil rather than adding feta and then olive oil and that worked our perfectly! Yum-Yum!

Wonderful and flavorful salad. Perfect for dinner after a hectic work day. So simple to make yet so delicious.

About one tablespoon of chopped fresh basel, and a tablespoon of red wine vinager seemed to help give a little more zip to the taste. Very good and I'm looking forward to making it again

I used calamato olives, larger shrimp than bay shrimp, sauteed them in olive oil and garlic and we all loved the result. I also used only half of the olive oil in the recipe.

This dish had a nice presentation but lacked in so many other ways. 1. I didn't like the dressing (quite boring) so instead I ended up using a bottled Greek salad dressing. 2. The shrimp were kind of tasteless and in need of being marinated and then seared or grilled. 3. Linguini didn't sound like the appropriate pasta to me, so I used orchiette which was nice. It wouldn't be worth it to me or my guests to make this dish again.

This is one of the best pasta salads I've ever tasted. All of my guests enjoyed the taste. I will be making this recipe again and again.. Thank you.

I took this pasta salad camping and it lasted all weekend in the ice chest. It was easy and delicious.I knew I would want it in the morning so I omitted the garlic and added blanched asparagus spears for richer flavor.This salad was a major hit.

This was a hit with everyone. I used 1/2 of the oil to tass with the ingredients as directed. The other 1/2 of the olive oil was used to saute fresh medium shrimp which was tossed warm into the salad. Also added a tablespoon of chopped fresh mint and 2 tablespoons toasted pinenuts.

This is a great summer dish because it can be eaten warm or cold. I have served this dish at least 10 times and it is a hit every time. It is great to serve for company, because you can prepare it earlier in the day. Just add some bread and wine and you have a lovely meal, that is a breeze to prepare.
