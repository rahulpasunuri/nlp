Delicious. Tastes like summer. I halved the olive oil, but otherwise exactly as written.

A fast, easy, good recipe. As others have stated, cut back on the pasta. I made this 2x...once as is, which was good, and then again with modifications to our liking. I cut the pasta by 1/4, and increased the feta, and added a little onion, pepper and pepperoni. Do not omit the cilantro. The taste is clear and wonderful. Iadded a bit more spice the second time around and it was great. I do not know how you could reduce the olive oil with the entire amount of pasta. I needed it plus a little more with only 12 oz. pasta. The pasta will absorb the oil, leaving it too dry.

A great recipe! I used about half of the amount of pasta, but I left everything else the same. The cilantro flavor isn't obvious, but there is definitely something other than mint in the taste. I'm keeping it in.

So good, fast and easy. I left out the green onions and added chicken stock and it was perfect. The tomatoes, feta and mint really make this recipe. Will probably leave out the cilantro next time since I couldn't taste it so would rather not buy it.

Delicious and easy to make! Very savory and satisfying. Make sure you toast the chickpeas well - so that they aren't soggy.

I'm only reviewing this (not rating) it because, for my taste, it needs revision to be a good recipe. I had horrible results with the Trader Joe's orecchiette I used. Despite my using a 6-qt stockpot and stirring throughout cooking, the little ears stuck together in these long "cones" where the outer "ears" were cooked but the inside ones were not (I have never had this problem with DeCecco brand). And I think the recipe would be best with 8 oz pasta, 1 pint of cherry tomatoes, only 4 Tbsp. oil total, and a 4-oz package of crumbled feta - keeping all other quantities the same, although I'm not sure the cilantro is necessary. The mint is great. I will try again with my suggested modifications...

Really delicious. Husband and I loved this for a light summer dinner. However, I would go lighter on the olive oil for the dressing, the 6 Tbsp is really rich. I'll use only 3 next time. Substituted some left over farfalle (halved) for the orecchiette and flat-leaf parsley for the fresh cilantro because I couldn't get it (added 1 Tbsp dry). The blend of flavors was wonderful both freshly made and next day.

I loved the mix of mint and cilantro, and the whole salad had a lovely, fresh zip. I used half the pasta called for and I liked the proportions (wagon wheels, because that's what I had on hand). Skipped the garlic and no feta but was still delicious. Even the kids liked the herb mix.

This was fast, fresh and tasted great. I added some grilled zucchini and chicken to make it a meal. My kids loved it and can't wait to have leftovers in their lunch. I'll be making it a lot this summer.

Delicious. Added cucumber - gave it a nice, fresh crunch. The salad needed a little salt, but not too much. Sauteeing the garbanzo beans is the key. I've started doing this in other salads now, too. It was a huge hit at our pot luck BBQ and the little that was left over was really great the next day. Just needed to add a little more oil to freshen it up. Will add this to my regular summer rotation.

I was looking for a quick recipe when I had pasta, cilantro, mint and feta and I didn't even get to the chickpeas or garlic. The tastes were fabulous and my husband couldn't stop eating it and raving about it. He's a bit of a carnivore, too. I'm going to make it next time with the chickpeas but I think the combination of cilantro and mint are a must for the flavors. I think it would be great for a crowd, especially here in Jordan where we live.

I am not very natural in the kitchen, but I made this no problem AND got compliments. Used fresh (refrigerated) fettuccini as the pasta. Didn't have cilantro so used a lot of high quality dried parsley instead. The mint is such a great touch. I would serve this at a summer dinner party. As a vegetarian main dish, I would also consider adding some Quorn chicken pieces to the saute to add a little more protein.

This is a great quick and easy pasta recipe. I usually reduce the amount of cilantro and since I really like artichokes, I have tossed in a jar every now and then.

Fabulous! The combination of ingredients all come together well to create a great tasting dish. Wonderful presentation for parties too! The only change I would make next time is to use slightly less pasta - perhaps just 12 ounces.

Quick, easy, delicious and reasonably healthy Will definitely make again!

Easy easy, tasty tasty. Great hot or cold! Colorful and pretty on the plate. The sauteed chickpeas were so good, I threw in another can. Would be great to bring to a picnic or bbq! I served with grilled marinated leg of lamb (also from this site)

This is another one of my favorite week night meals... easy, healthy, and quick to make! I usually use rotini in place of orecchiette and it works just fine.

This makes a great one-dish vegetarian meal. If you can't find orecchiette, as I couldn't, medium shells of about the same size will do. I used parsley for the cilantro, and it was great!

I made this with a few changes...I used whole wheat rotini instead of orrechiette. I added a little bit of chicken since we ate it as a main course. I also added a little sweet onion instead of the green onion. The mint and the best quality tomatoes you can find are a must. We really enjoyed it and will definitely make it again.

Great for packed lunch at work! I made these changes. Half the pasta. Double the feta. Half again the cilantro. Add lemon juice. Marinate the chickpeas in minced garlic and salt before sauteing. Go heavy on the pepper.

I made this recipe as written and it was great! Super Wonder Husband thought it was delicious. It is easy, and tasty. Don't be afraid of using orecchiette.

I was looking for a side dish to go with a leg of lamb I was grilling and this sounded interesting. I made some changes, like using couscous instead of the orechiette and parsley instead of cilantro, and it was really good. A nice, light accompaniment to lamb.
