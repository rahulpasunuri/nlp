I gladly give this 4 forks because it is truly a fabulous recipe. I made it for Thanksgiving this year and people absolutely could not stop talking about it. The secret really is to make it at least one week in advance to let the flavors marry. I also added cinnamon to give it some more depth and omitted the walnuts. I used it in a gingersnap crust with thinly sliced pears on top, baked for about 40 minutes at 325 in a spring form pan and it was perfect! Will make every year!

I bake all the time. Cooking is my passion and never - never - have I prepared anything that comes close to this. I have made hundreds over the years and this is beyond exceptional and beyond 4 forks. I go out of my way to select the best ingredients for this and put it up several weeks or a month in advance of Thanksgiving or Christmas to develop the flavors. I do this by canning. The only thing I have ever found worth canning, to be honest. I had to review because I could not believe noone has been reviewing this recipe. For over 10 years now this recipe has made my holidays happier.. enjoy!

I don't think this is really any better than purchased mincemeat for the purpose. It is a little different, and maybe those who really don't like mincemeat may find this more tolerable, but I was not that impressed. Also, I made it 3 days in advance and refrigerated it in a glass container with a tight lid, but I thought it tasted better right after I made it than it did 3 days later.

I have made this recipe every Thanksgiving for the past two years...and was requested to make it again this year! So popular with my friends and family, there is never any left at the end of the day.
