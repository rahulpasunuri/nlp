Love this recipe! I added small cubes of aged manchego cheese and served with crusty bread. It was a huge hit...

Very tasty on the day but am not sure what happened as the marinade turned to sludge (fat like) when stored over night in the fridge. Unappealing the next day, however a little heating did remedy this.

made enough for at least 8; only 3 showed but ALL the olives were gone. someone was even using bread to sop up the leftover oil. yummy!

So easy and good. The green olives are the best. I doubled the garlic, thyme, and orange peel. I actually got this recipe confused with the one from the A16 cookbook and added red pepper flakes and they were delicious. This is a keeper.

These are really good and very quick to make. I made them with the Yogurt and lemon hummus, and the cheese straws from this site. They all went together very well.

This salt/citrus combination is magic, but I agree - the greens should prevail. Kalamata are worthy of their own environment

I don't know if I picked a bad lemon, but this recipe was way too acidic for me. If I did it again, I think I'd skip the lemon juice and peel all together

Easy and Good - so good that they were gone by the end of dinner and there were only 4 of us! The green olives really shined with the citrus flavor. The Kalamatas didn't tase much like anything other than Kalamatas. We would have loved to have only the green olives but we agreed that Kalamatas did add to the color and overall flavor of the dish.

I made this as a starter for Mother's Day. It was a HUGE hit. This recipe does make a lot, but it stays good if you keep it marinating in the fridge. I'm going to make another batch for picnicing this summer at the outdoor movies. Total keeper!

Delicious! I made these a few days before my party and served them warm. Don't change a thing.

I took these to a gathering that was serving snacks. Great Success. Several people asked me for the recipe. Do Not short the lemon and orage peel.

Brought this to work and got rave reviews. Three people asked for the recipe. It is very easy to make and everyone who likes olives will enjoy this dish. Though I didn't find it converted any non-olive enthusiasts.

This was very good and actually keeps much longer than 3 days. I used the leftover marinade to make salad dressing one night, and added tamari to make a great dip for artichokes another.

The first time I made this was for a July 4th gathering, I made it the same day, instead of at least the day before as directed in the recipe. Everyone still loved it. Because of the Cilantro, I didn't think it went with an Italian theme dinner, but with Ciabatta (Italian Slipper Bread) for dipping in the flavorful oil - it is wonderful!

This dish was fantastic. I served it with bread as the first course in a tapas dinner, and my guests asked for bread to sop up the delicious marinade.

Took these to a potluck picnic--everyone who loves olives will love them! Not difficult and definitely worth the time.

Superb! Don't skimp on the lemon or orange peel. Preferred pitted olives.
