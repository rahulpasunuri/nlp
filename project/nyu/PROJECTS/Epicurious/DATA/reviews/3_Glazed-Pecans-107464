Made these nuts to top a salad for Thanksgiving. I agree with the other reviewers who said that the nuts should be catagorized as "sugared" rather than glazed. Despite this, they are a delicious topping not only for salad, but also for mashed sweet potatoes. Just the right amout sugar and spice in the recipe. All of my guests loved them and were eating them by the handful.

These are amazing and so easy. Nice and spicy. An excellent addition to salads or on their own. Make sure that your oven is no hotter than 325 though! They burn easily.

I agree. These are definitely "sugared pecans" and not "glazed" but still a tasty snack.

BEWARE!!! I use the spice/oil recipe on walnuts. My husband told me to NEVER MAKE THIS RECIPE again. When it is in the house, he hears voices to go eat the walnuts. They call to him, they possess him. Don't make them unless you plan on eating them all and DON'T double the recipe. They are totally addictive and consuming! Gotta go! My batch is just about done and I have to get to them before HE does! Yum Yum eat um UP!!

I used to have a recipe for spicy glazed pecans that was from Bon Apetit, but I lost it. The glaze used sugar,water,salt and cayenne. You had to boil the glazed, then pour it on the pecans. You then baked it for 10-15 minutes and the pecans came out crunchy. I did not like this recipe at all.

I served these in an arugula, pear and Maytag bleu cheese salad. They were perfect. I did not find that they shed grains of sugar as others have complained. I pushed the temperature up a bit higher though.

These are great and couldn't be easier. My husband asks that I hide them so others can't eat "his supply".

I was disapointed. It did not standup to my expectations. I should have read the other reviews first, Next time, I'll know better.

Wow, so incredibly good and incredibly easy! But, I would call these "Sugared Pecans" rather than "Glazed Pecans" because of the final result. I made the recipe exactly as written, however I doubled it so I can give the pecans as a holiday gift. Of course I don't know if that will happen because my husband keeps picking at the finished pecans and murmuring "these are great". I am generally not a fan of nuts, but must admit these are wonderful. Absolutely worth making, you'll be happy with the results. Word of warning: even with the recipe doubled, it only made one a "nice" size gift, you may want to increase the recipe accordingly.

"Glazed" is not the word that should be used to describe these nuts. They end up having a crystally sugar coating, which sticks to your fingers and sprinkles on you when you eat them. I have other recipes that I have made in the past, and there are never any leftovers, but I'm always looking for new, so I gave these a try. But with this batch, which I doubled to make as much as I usually have on hand with the other recipes, I had plenty of leftovers. I did not like them very much, and clearly, neither did my guests! I'm deleting this recipe from my Recipe Box!

Extremely easy to make - and doubling the recipe still fit easily on 1 baking sheet. Don't leave them in over 15 mins - I had difficulty telling if they were "crisp", and my first batch was over cooked. Also, as one reviewer pointed out, the pecans don't became very glazed; it remains more of a sugary coating but not overly sugary.

good, not great in my opinion. I was expecting the sugar to carmalize and form a glaze, but it never did.. just left the sugar granules. Don't get me wrong, it was still good, just not what I expected... maybe I did something wrong???

These were great,I just made them and my husband has already eaten them all. My only complaint is that it needs to be doubled or tripled,recipe does not make enough for gifts. Simple perfection.
