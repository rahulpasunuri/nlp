Very yummy but the liquid was pretty thin -- wish it had thickened up a bit more. Followed recipe pretty closely, though subbed some other veggies in. The flavor was great and the biscuit was very good.

made this last night. Loved it. I used a rutabaga instead of turnip, roasted the root veggies and added to the mushrooms/ onion and cream sauce, and added a splash of sherry to the cream sauce. Loved it.

We made this for dinner last night. We try to eat vegetarian at least 3 or 4 nights per week and I sometimes have trouble coming up with cold- weather main dishes. This one is going into regular rotation! My 3- and 5-year-old kids liked it, too. The only substitution I made was to use all veggie stock instead of veggie stock and water, and I think next time I'll use some water as the broth was very intense (I think this maybe depends on how flavourful your dried porcini are?). In the furure, we'll also experiment with other root and winter vegetables as they come into season. Butternut squash? Parsnips? Maybe some kale and fennel bulb? Our only complaint was a human-error one. I asked my husband to make the biscuit mix while I got the veggies going and he accidentally added WAY too much salt (tbsp instead of tsp), but otherwise we loved it. Wonder if we could have made two and frozen one....we have tons of leftovers. To the cook who wondered about spreading the topping: I just plopped it on there and spread it as best as I could, and it expanded to fill the whole top as it cooked, and cooked evenly.

The cobbler was beautiful to look at (I will be using the biscuit recipe on its own), however, overall, too much work for very little taste. The filling was bland even after I tripled the amount of thyme, cumin and black pepper. Thank you to a previous reviewer for recommending celery root instead of turnip, that added a bit of flavor to the dish.

I have made this dish three times recently for different clients. I added diced beef or chicken to it to make it a complete meal, but I am sure it would be good as a vegetarian dish also. I also used beef or chicken stock with the corresponding meat to give it an extra boost of flavor. I used 1 Idaho potato, 4 carrots, and a one pound bag of parsnips (3-4 parsnips) to fill a large casserole dish. I used all fresh mushrooms and added them in the beginning of the recipe. (Saute onion, meat, mushrooms, then the root veggies.) I would like advice on how to get the biscuit topping onto the top of the casserole neatly. The best way I found was to place a sheet of plastic wrap on my cutting board and cover it with olive oil so it doesn't stick to the biscuit (which also gives the biscuit a nice golden glow when it is baked). But I have had trouble getting the very delicate dough flipped over onto the casserole without making a mess. I thought about spooning the dough into the cobbler to make the "cobble stones" but it would require doubling the biscuit recipe and the casserole would be a very heavy dish.

This casserole was a huge hit with my entire family, including a very picky youngster. I didn't have any cumin so I substituted dry sherry and rice wine when with the vegetables- very different from cumin but excellent with the meal. It added a sharpsweetness to the dish

This was delicious. Didn't have enough chives so I used parsley and scallions in the biscuit. The leftovers kept amazingly well, too. We ate off of it for a week, and the topping never got soggy. Definitely a keeper.

This was pretty tasty; we really liked the crust. But WAY TOO MUCH. For a family of 4, we'll be eating this for days. I will make it again, but will halve the recipe and still have leftovers.

Rating: 4
What a great recipe. Very tasty. However I did make a few changes. Used a mix of fresh herbs rather than just thyme. Also added a grated apple that was about to go to the compost bin. I am not sorry I did, it added a bit of sweetness to the dish.

Well, I picked this recipe to make tonight because I had most of the ingredients on hand and it seemed from the reviews to be good winter fare. Our CSA box has showered us with turnips, and all colors of carrots, so I was good to go. I used chopped cremini for porcini (sauteed first in the butter/evoo to firm them up.) I cut back on the cumin, then added it back in again! No whipping cream, so subbed fat free half and half, and garlic chives from our garden for regular chives ($2.00 @ the store!) Plus I added a handful of minced garden herbs. I think the topping was very generous--I split the veggies between two casseroles, and patted the topping into a top for each. I served this with a huge green salad full of crunchy, yummy lettuces, frisee, arugula, pecans and persimmons. My husband and I both had seconds...delicious. Plus...one for the freezer, and leftovers in the fridge!

This was very good, a nice winter vegetarian weekend meal. The biscuit topping was good but messy. It did stay good till the next day though.

This is the perfect dish for throwing in all the root vegetables we get from our farm share. Wonderful mix of flavors, great texture and the biscuit topping is yummy. A very substantial meal despite the lack of meat.

This was delicious. I added some cubed tofu to the filling, subbed olive oil for butter, and used half & half instead of heavy cream- still tasted rich. I also added some minced garlic and a dash of cayenne and paprika. Didn't change the biscuit topping, which was awesome. However, I did just bake in one dish, rather than individuals for a Monday night meal. Very filling and a nice change.

Rating: 4
Among several dishes I served (including a souffle) this one was the standout. Some of the guests routinely eat at Per Se, etc., so I was really flattered. Eleventh hour I realized I had no baking powder and I skipped the crust (and still wowed them). Highly recommended.

Rating: 1
The amount of cumin called for in this dish completely overwhelms everything else in it instead of enhancing the flavors. I discovered this dish doesn't keep well because the biscuit gets soggy from the sauce, so if you aren't eating it all in one go, don't bother.

Rating: 4
It was a lot easier than I thought it would be and now that I know the basics, I can experiment with any seasonable vegetable. The whole family loved it.

Unexpectedly delicious. When served as main, don't even miss the meat. Easy to change up vegetables with seasonality and availability. Just enough sauce/biscuit ratio. A new standard.

This was really good. The only thing I changed was to not peel the potatoes. I think it would be great with sweet potatoes as well.

this dish was wonderful - comforting and hearty and delicious. however, i had trouble getting it thick enough.. it was still kind of liquidy after i had baked it.

I was poking around looking for a recipe that would a) use root vegetables, b) would be vegetarian, and c) make my husband want to eat it. This dish is awesome. Really. Ok, first, I did change a few things but that's only so I could use what I had on hand. I used garlic instead of onion, no chives, and tarragon instead of thyme. And I made it made it in one dish instead of the recommended 6. My husband - a true carnivore - had eaten half before he realized it was meatless. I astounded myself, even. I thought this would be an ok recipe, but it was really really four-forks yummy. Easy to make, nice presentation. We both had seconds!

Rating: 4
Seemingly simple and even "plain", this was a huge huge hit, even before it was out of the oven. Thought I had cumen on hand but started cooking & couldn't find it. Used chili powder instead. Then found the cumin, added a bit of that too. EVERYONE had seconds.

Rating: 4
I can't tell you what a hit this was at my house last night. I always hate it when people review a recipe and then proceed to tell you that they changed half of it, but I did leave out the mushrooms and the cumin. Mushrooms just seemed out of place in a root vegetable dish. I was pleasantly surprised at how (relatively) quick this was. I started it at 5:00 and it was ready to eat at 6:15. I made it in one big dish and that worked well too. Perfect fall/winter comfort food!

We've already made this recipe twice in the past month: it's a simply fantastic winter dish!!! I am a vegetarian and my boyfriend isn't but we both love it. Definitely agree with the suggestion of substituting celery root for turnips, however. Also, when we make it we usually just make one big pie instead of little individual ones. Since it is slightly time-consuming, the second time we made a little bit more and froze half the dough and half the filling so that we can make it again easily--just assemble and put in the oven.

Rating: 2
This was good but a little bland for my tastes, even though I added extra spice to it. I made it with one-half whole wheat flour and in one pan, which worked well. If I were to make it again, I would add green beans and try to think of another spice to brighten it up.

Rating: 4
Fabulous! And versatile -- I had no parsnips, so added loads of beets instead. I didn't have enough mushrooms, and next time I'll intentionally add none at all (I found the occasional chewy shiitake rather annoying!). We licked our bowls clean.

Rating: 4
Heaven in a dish! Use any combination of root veggies that suits you -- I used potatoes, carrots, and turnip. Also, I substituted dried shiitakes for fresh (about half of a 1-oz package) since that's what I had.

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe, one of the best of its kind, great balance between fancy and homey. From my trials: For those concerned with fat, made it with country-style 15% fat cream (instead of 35% whipping cream), works as well. No shitake, used regular mushroom, not as good but OK. No chives, big mistake, chives really brighten up the dough and veggies. No turnip, used celery root, very nice, milder dish. Made it in two casseroles, worked well. Might double up filling for same dough next time, just thought dough-to-filling ratio was a bit high.

This has become a staple fall and winter dish in my household. Meat eaters love it as a side dish, and it is great enough to be a wonderful main course for vegetarians. I love this recipe!

Rating: 4
This is an excellent vegetarian main course. I cook regularly for a group including 3-4 vegetarians and am always looking for recipes that are delicious and satisfying that don't include meat. I made the recipe almost exactly as printed -- the only change being the inclusion of snap peas instead of the frozen peas. The flavors, including the cumin, blend together nicely. I really liked the inclusion of chives in both the topping and the stew. A real keeper!

Excellent dish. Added a little savoury to the biscuit topping. Big hit at a recent pot-luck. Will definitely make again.

Fabulous. Agree with earlier reviews - total vegetarian comfort food; easy to substitute ingredients and still have a wonderful dish. I used parsnips and rutabagas instead of the porcini mushrooms and turnips.

Tasty, yes, but with 1 cup cream how could it not be? Feel the richness masked the natural flavours of the vegetables.

This was an excellent vegetarian dish! The mushrooms gave it a nice earthy taste and the biscuit helped sop up all the juices. I made it in the individual dishes but next time I'll make it in one big pan.

This recipe is a delightful new addition to my menu selection. It will become my traditional Christmas Eve supper since it is well received by a variety of eating tastes.

A wonderful recipe. We skipped the mushrooms and added a few extra carrots. We've made it twice now and will definitely make it again.

True vegetarian comfort food. I've substituted and substituted, and it's still fantastic. Beets, purple potatoes, regular mushrooms instead of porcinis, differrent herbs in the biscuit, whatever... the core of the recipe is strong enough to be versatile. Filling freezes well, but dough does not.

Rating: 4
I made this in one big cobbler dish rather than individual servings, kept the cooking time and all that the same, and it came out great! However, I did try to get fancy and use purple potatoes instead of white and my cobbler came out a funky color. Plus, the potatoes turned deep blue when I served the leftovers the next day. Just a word of warning. Also, I don't like mushrooms and deleted every thing mushroomy from the ingredients. I added some frozen corn to make up for the missing mushrooms.

It's true enough thatI have no recipe quite like this combination of root veggies & herbs. Have baked & served it twice in a Pyrex casserole dish (8 1/2x13 1/2"x1 3/4".) Since this was a vegetable side dish, potatoes were included in another part of the meal so I substituted daikon & parsnips. All other ingrediants including procedures, baking time & temperature remained the same. The second time I made the dish I forgot to heat the filling just before baking. As a reult the lovely biscuits were a tad soggy on the bottom. Won't forget that again! Everyone (except my 4 yr old grandson) enjoyed the unusual combination of ingrediants & asked for the recipe.

Rating: 2
My DH loved this but I think it was too earthy for my tastebuds (I usually love mushrooms). I may have messed up and added too many porcini mushrooms. It was also a bit on the "dry" side if that's possible. I skipped the butter at the end and used milk instead of cream. There is a chicken pot pie with dilled biscuit topping in this database which is much better (IMO). I'll give this another shot since everyone here liked it but I won't add as many mushrooms.

Rating: 4
I was vascillating on making this when I remembered REVIEWS!! Thanks to everyone and their fork awards I made it and it's so yummy. I almost missed out. The mushrooms make it meaty tasting in a good way and the picture doesn't do it justice. Don't worry the biscuit won't go to the edges of the bowl...it's a lot better that way and it puffs and expands during baking. Will try freezing it as other reviewer suggested (if there is any left!!)

Rating: 4
This was a fabulous dish, even my young niece loved it. I made it exactly as directed. I froze the leftovers and heated them directly from the freezer in the regular oven wrapped in foil for 45 min or so then uncovered for 15 min. It was still great and not soggy.

Would anyone have any suggestions for side dishes?

As a vegetarian, I am always looking for flavorful and filling entrees that are sophisticated enough to serve to guests, and this recipe really came through for me. These cobblers turned out beautifully, and they had such rich, wonderful flavor that the carnivores I served them to never missed the meat! The only adjustment I made was to reduce the amount of cumin that the recipe called for. I cut it down to 1/2 tsp, and think I may reduce it down even a bit further next time as the flavor was still just a little too dominant. Absolutely incredible dish that I'm sure to make again soon.

Rating: 4
This was surprisingly easy to make and it turned out great. It's substantial without being heavy. A perfect dinner for a cold night at home. (Works without the porcini mushrooms if you don't have any on hand.)
