It was good but not very. I halved and modified the recipe based on reviews. I used preshredded coleslaw mix. For the halved dressing recipe I used 1/2 cup lowfat mayo with 1/4 cup of the BBQ sauce and it was the perfect amount of dressing for 1 16-ounce package of coleslaw. It definitely needs to be made ahead of time.

Made this recipe for a office luncheon today. I am not a Carolina girl, so it was very vinergery. I added more of the brown suger and a touch more ketcup to the Red BBQ sauce to toen it down. It was still tangy enough for us California Girls. The BBQ sauce made such a great coleslaw.

I had my doubts when I read the recipe, however, after reading all of the good reviews decided to try. It is a must with the pulled pork sandwich. Excellent!

Just delish! A wonderful variation. For the red sauce I use just a cup of vinegar, otherwise it's way too tangy for me! restlesschef.blogspot.com

This slaw was a nice change from the typical sweet dressing. It is nice and tangy, thanks to the red sauce. I served it as a side in a vegetarian meal; everyone was pleased.

Used a spicy tequila BBQ sauce I had in the fridge - yum - it went perfectly with the sandwiches - just load it on top of the bun and enjoy!

Really good; this slaw makes the pulled pork recipe work. The sandwiches are dull without it!

This recipe is great, a hit with everyone including my son who doesn't like veggies. It doesn't need the mayo which I sometimes substitute with olive oil.

This is now my favorite coleslaw recipe. I keep a bottle of Carolina Red Sauce in my refrigerator, to make the coleslaw & add a tang to other dishes.

The secret of the recipe is actually the Carolina BBQ sauce. I found that the BBQ sauce was too tangy and just added more mayonnaise to counter the tangy taste. I took the suggestion by adding red cabbage and some carrots for colour. Very tasty and easy recipe that seems like more work than it actually is - I will definitely make this again!

With this you must use all three Recipes the Pork and the rub on the meat to get the full flavor of the coleslaw the slaw alone is ok but with the Pork as a sandwiches its Great!!

I've always just bought the pre-shred cabbage and bottled coleslaw sauce. Thought I'd give it a whirl with making it... will never go back to store bought. This was a 'simple' great recipe. Kids loved it so did the adults, I mixed in some purple cabbage and carrots. Served it with beer can chicken and garlic bread, can't wait to make it again!! Look forward to using the remaining BBQ sauce for other things!!!!

OK... I grew up in western North Carolina, where no self-respecting barbecue restaurant would dare put mayonaisse in their slaw. Nevertheless, if you make a full recipe of the Carolina Red Barbecue Sauce and add it straight and uncut to a half-head of shredded cabbage, then you will have a wonderful example of authentic North Carolina barbecue slaw.

I've made this on several occasions, I added a tad of horseradish as suggested. I also add carrot or peppers, etc to change it when I i'm in the mood. very good

FYI...mayonnaise might be a legitimate ingredient in coleslaw recipes but it has no place in slaw used with Carolina barbeque whether it is eastern, western or Lexington style (all three refer only to North Carolina). I know, I was born and raised there...can't address the variations in South Carolina. The cabbage should be minced and tossed only with the sauce or a mixture of cider vinegar, ketchup and black pepper. It cuts the richness of the meat and adds a terrific zing as well.

I have made this several times with pulled pork sandwiches. Absolutely nothing better or easier. Summer keeper.

I did this recipe for my Texas guests and they loved it. I have also done it since and it is a crowd pleaser. I have added this to my own list of favorites.

The barbeque sauce gave the coleslaw a nice tang. Must be served with the pulled pork sandwiches.
