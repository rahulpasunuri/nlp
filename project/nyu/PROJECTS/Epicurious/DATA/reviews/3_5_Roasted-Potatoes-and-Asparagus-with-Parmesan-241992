This was really tasty and a great side dish for a vegetarian menu so that people got full from the potatoes! The only thing I'd do differently next time is put the potatoes in the oven about ten minutes before the asparagus. By the time the potatoes were cooked through, the asparagus was pretty soft.

I'm giving this two forks because it is GOOD, not DELICIOUS. Not sure what would make it delicious...we did add shallots and that added some flavor. But at the core it's just not a terribly exciting dish. From a cooking time standpoint, I decided to do the potatoes on one cookie sheet and the asparagus on another (yay for double oven) cooking the latter for 1/2 the time of the potatoes. I then merged them onto one sheet for the cheese melting step. Definitely needs substantial salt and pepper, good olive oil, more herb or flavoring of some kind.

Really liked it - simple but surprisingly falvourful - will make again. Next time I will put asparagus in half- way through so they don't shrivel and over cook.

Overall good, but I think my asparagus was too thin for this recipe -- it was shriveled and overcooked (but the potatoes were perfect). I would make this again, but I would substitute a different vegetable, or use very thick asparagus instead.

I really liked this recipe and so did my family. I added fresh garlic cloves and wedges of sweet yellow onion to the mixture, it was very aromatic and tasted great!

Other reviewer comments on the need for more herbs and garlic are spot on. I would add only two things: a) rosemary into the mix of herbs and b)cut the potatoes into wedges and first parboil them for 5 minutes - then roast them. That way you get a nice fluffy interior and nice crunchy roasted exterior. Also they don't need to be in the oven so long. I also liked the Romano cheese suggestion.

This was a total disaster--black, chewy, and dry. Perhaps it would work if you had 1/2 or 3/4 inch thick asparagus, but my stalks were relatively slender. I will delete this and choose to forget it!

Overall a good and simple recipe -- but nothing out of the ordinary. I added garlic in the mixture. Some herbs and spices would make it better.

This is incredibly good for the amount of time and effort involved in making it. I added two cloves of sliced garlic to the mixture of asparagus and potatoes, and substituted Romano cheese for the Parmigiano-Reggiano.

I also used baby red potatoes cut in half and roasted them a little longer - about 30 minutes - I can see why people say to put the asparagus in a little later because it ended up a bit crunchy, but tasted delicious that way! I served these with grilled lamb chops with rosemary and balsamic vinegar - also from epicurious - terrific.

This was a big hit. I added a couple of cloves of minced garlic, some fresh thyme I had on hand and a generous amount of sea salt and fresh ground pepper, fresh asparagus and a mix of yukon gold and red potatoes from the farmer's market. It is definitely something I will do again. Plus it was so quick and easy. I didn't have any problem with the veggies cooking unevenly. I made sure to cut the potatoes as per the recipe and the asparagus stalks I used were thick.

I roasted the potatoes until they had about 15 minutes left, and then I threw in the asparagus. I think it would have been overcooked otherwise. I also added finely diced shallots, which were delicious.

Amazingly easy and delicious. I mixed some garlic, basil, and rosemary in with the olive oil and used freshly grated romano cheese -- a great snack or side dish

I made this recipe as a side dish for our uber-healthy workout friends and they loved it. It is really easy and the aparagus comes out perfect! I added a mixture of yukon gold and red bliss potatoes for some added color.

I used red potatoes and several smashed cloves of garlic. It was wonderfully delicious!

This was an easy, hands-off way to make a side dish. Both the potatoes and asparagus were roasted perfectly. The Parm on the top wasn't necessary but a delicious addition. The three make a new combination for us, we enjoyed it.

This recipe was pretty good but nothing special...kind of boring and lackluster. I would make it again with more seasonings or garlic.
