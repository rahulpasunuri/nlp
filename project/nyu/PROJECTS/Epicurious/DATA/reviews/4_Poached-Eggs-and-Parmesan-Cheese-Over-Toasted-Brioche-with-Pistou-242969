I did a very bad thing...Because my husband was working extra hard yesterday, I decided to saute a couple pieces of prosciutto to put on these toasts. Then I got the idea to saute the toasts in the prosciutto fat! OH BOY! These were really good. I don't love basil, so I mixed half basil and half parsley. We loved this whole dish.

This recipe was delicious! I served it over some frisee, and made it a little healthier by lowering oil and cheese as well as using a multigrain bread. I disagree that it's not worth making your own pistou. It took just a few minutes with my hand held food processor, and the taste of freshly blended basil, garlic and oil was much more powerful and delicious than the store bought variety. Will definitely make again... maybe the egg and pistou over a risotto for dinner??

I like this recipe, easy, simple, lots of flavor. I prepare breakfast for my family, and my "clients" keep coming every morning!!!

I always like to put a healthy spin on things so I used toasted Arnold Healthnut bread instead of the brioche and went just a little lighter on the pistou and parmesan.

Also, simply used a mortar and pestle to mash up the basil with olive oil and garlic. Added salt and fresh cracked black pepper.

Made this last night-added a slice of pancetta lightly fried, slice of tomato, and placed on a lightly toasted ciabatta roll. PERFECT, easy dinner!

Excellent! I used Challah bread and a Whole Foods Basil Pesto making this already easy recipe that much more so. Considering the results, I'm not sure it's worth the trouble of making your own pistou if you can find a suitable one in the market.

this was delicious! i used thick-cut toasted sourdough bread since that's what i had on hand. personally i thought that the amount of olive oil called for was a bit too much, next time i'll make it with a bit less. i used cracked pink peppercorns to season this which added a subtle flavor and looked nice contrasted against the bright green of the basil. i could see this being made again using toasted english muffins (as has already been suggested) or maybe egg bagels.

So simple, qyick and delicious. I used lightly toasted challah bread and it worked great (one slice for 2 eggs). A winner.

I used genovese basil pesto to make this even easer - really yum, except my eggs were overdone by 3mins, will make it again and cook for less.

I LOVED this recipe! It was crazy for me to have even tried it: I have never had a poached egg before, let alone tried to make one. But my patient boyfriend let me try this out for breakfast. It turned out amazing! I used english muffins to keep it breakfasty. Will definitely make again.

This was GREAT! Super flavors and very nice presentation. Made it with Zucchini cucumber soup which was a super combo and both very easy.

I'm going to give this four stars because it was so easy! I served this to my boyfriend and his friend of whom had NEVER had a POACHED EGG! (gasp!) They both raved!! Made NO changes. Had to use egg bread as the bread in my area SUCKS but it came out great. Used fresh basil from my garden. Served with a spring mix salad on the side as a dinner. Very beautiful, gourmet seeming recipe but so simple and healthy and easy and FRESH. Mmmm!! I see this at a brunch with the side baby greens salad and some mimosas.

This was delicious. Couldn't find brioche bread, but challah worked great.

This takes poached eggs to a new height. Used toasted challah, big shavings of imported parmesano regiano, seasoned with frsh ground pepper and sea salt and served with thick sliced tomato and avocado...a glass of white wine made this a perfect summer dinner. As Julia would say, "Bon Appetit!"
