This was just okay. I didn't think it really did justice to either the chard (which I love), or the celery root (which I'm not experienced with). Wouldn't bother making again.

I eat chard because it is so healthful and because it likes my garden. So this is really not a bad way of serving it. I found the oil a bit cloying in the final dish, but I sure would make it again.

A very good way to cook chard. Be carefull not to overcook the celeriac as when the bite is gone it is very uninteresting. I finished half with lemon juice as suggested, and half with cider vinegar and much prefered the second. Also, use plenty of salt and pepper

I served this alongside duck for Xmas dinner, and it was wonderful. It has a nice salty/savory kick, and the celery root lends it a very pleasant, toothsome texture. Leftovers would probably go very well in an omelette.
