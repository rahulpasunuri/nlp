What an easy tasty treat! The combination of flavors is great. The touch of green adds to the beauty of the melon.----and its low fat!

Really good. My children all loved it and my husband couldn't believe how I used our fresh herbs. I never would have thought to use basil with honeydew. It was strangely delicious! I'll be making this often.

Refreshing, simple, quick and delicious. A lot depends on the quality of the melon. Its sweetness will determine the amount of lime juice and sugar, so be sure to taste it before adding. Lime zest is a good addition, and you already have it if you're adding fresh lime juice.

I didn't make this exact recipe but have been making this for years: melon (honeydew, cantaloupe, both...) tossed with a light dressing of honey with a touch of lime juice and chopped fresh mint. Never used basil or a large quantity of lime juice and it is always a hit. Better if you make a little in advance (up to a few hours) so the flavors can "meld".

This was an amazing blend of flavors, especially when I pureed everything in a blender and served as a cold soup. For the person who described it as too tart, try playing with the sugar and lime balance based on the ripeness of your melon. Next time I'm going to puree all the ingredients and freeze them into sorbet and serve for a light, refreshing summer desert.

After reading the rave reviews, I was disappointed with the result. I didn't care for the flavor -- too sour.

I haven't made this salad yet, but I recently had a similar salad at a restaurant in NYC. The variation from this recipe is that the salad also had halved grape tomatoes mixed in. It was absolutely delicious, colorful, and can't be much more involved than making this salad! Just an idea to pass along to others!

Hard to believe that no one has rated this recipe since 1994...having a big juicy organic honeydew I thought I'd give it a whirl. THIS IS THE WAY TO EAT HONEYDEW. No question about it. Simple, perfect, almost like being on vacation or in a yummy brunch place. Make and enjoy.
