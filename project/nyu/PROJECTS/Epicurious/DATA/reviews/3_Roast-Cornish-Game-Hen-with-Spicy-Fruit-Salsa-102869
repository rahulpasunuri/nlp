thanks to jeff this was a wonderful recipe. I followed his suggestions and have made this several times. My husband raved about it so much my mother asked for the recipe and now it is one of my father's favorites too

I also made my own salsa with mango, red onion, lime juice and seasonings. I rubbed the hen with jerk seasonings. It was lovely.

This recipe was easy to follow, and taste great.I made my own fruit salsa with fresh strawberries, kiwi, mango, jalapeno peppers, fresh mint and added sugar and balsamic vinegar. I also pan seared the game hens and finished them in the oven. I deglazed the pan with balsamic vinegar and Port, and spooned it over the game hens...a very complimentary sauce with hen and fruit salsa.

I tried this recipe last night, (unlike your last reviewer) and my family really enjoyed it! It was simple and a unique taste treat. I used Peach Salsa. We try game hens frequently & use different recipes. I also made Baked Sweet Potatoes and Steamed Broccoli. Yum-Yum!

I just don't like this recipie. To me, cornish hens taste best stuffed with rice and veggies, then roasted to perfection with or without your favorite sauce. However, I did not try the recipie and that may be my downfall.
