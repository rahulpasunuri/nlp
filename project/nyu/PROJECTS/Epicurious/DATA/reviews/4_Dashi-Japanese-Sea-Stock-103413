Excellent recipe to use in a large variety of Japanese dishes. We used to make Japanese egg custard (chawan mushi) and it was terrific.

Excellent base for miso soup. The kombu can be re-used for a number of other recipes.

Very simple and basic but such an integral part of many Japanese dishes. I also add shitake mushrooms (heads only quartered), some bok choy and carrots for flavor and then strain the veggies out along with the bonito flakes after they have simmered for 10 - 15 minutes. Not certain if there is a reason they recommend removing from the heat and just soaking the bonito. One trick I found is the bonito gets very, very bland once the flavor has transferred to the water.

I used this recipe as stock for miso soup. The soup turned out wonderful. I strongly recommend making the rice with soy-glazed bonito flakes and sesame seeds.
