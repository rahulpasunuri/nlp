I made this for a traditional Danish Christmas Dinner last year. It was delicious, beautiful and all the guests raved about it. The recipe is excellent. I have been asked by the host to make this tart again for Christmas this year. I highly recommend this tart.

One work may be too low, but I was just very disappointed! First of all, TOO MUCH BUTTER! way to much! Secondly, way to bland. I was so excited when I read this recipe, but once I followed word to word instructions and made the tart, I was very disappointed. Two forks max!

This was a HUGE hit among many other pies/tarts at a party full of foodies. I did the cookies in acorn shape, which is a little easier for slicing. I loved the balance of flavors between the crust and filling.

This is my first review. What an amazing dessert. Made this blindly for a bunch with taste and I was able to hold my head high-quite high. Everyone loved it! Did not change a thing. Will make again and again and again...

This tart came out very well for me. It looked just like the picture in the magazine. It was very tasty, not too sweet and a little bit different than other tarts. It was easy to make for a party because you can make the crust and filling in advance and put together on the day of the dinner. The crust is so good, it would be good made into plain cookies. (I did have a little extra dough from the crust that I made into extra cookies).

This is fantastic. I did have a problem transferring the dough to the pan. Tried to pick it up once it was rolled out and it fell apart. However, I muddled through and impressed the entire family.

I made this tart for a New Years Eve party we hosted and it was a huge success!

I've made this Speculass tart every Christmas since it appeared in the magazine in 2001 - at the requests of family and friends! It will become a holiday tradition!

Excellent! I was born in Holland and made this for my Dutch parents - to rave reviews. Authentic and delicious.

This tart is attractive and easy to make. My own preference would be for a little less lemon peel in the filling. Otherwise, I would change nothing. It would make a great brunch item with it's subtle flavor.

I made this for my book club meeting because we were discussing a book about the Dutch painter Vermeer. I made hearts instead of gingerbread men because it was the week of Valentines Day. Everyone raved about this treat. I will definitely make it again.

This is a great recipe. I made it for my Christmas cookie swap and it was a big hit.

This tart is positively delicious. I made one for last night (Christmas Eve) and another to take to my grandmother's today. It's a cross between gingerbread and shortbread--a dense, spicy, crisp cookie--with a marzipan filling. My husband loves marzipan and ate three wedges of this tart, a first for him.
