This is my absolute favorite cookie recipe. No peanut butter chips for me, though. Instead I use Guittard butterscotch chips (and I can't emphasize this enough: DON'T skimp on quality here. The cheap butterscotch chips taste absolutely awful). I have found that the batter as is tends to come out too thin, so I've upped the flour to 3/4 cup. You can also let the dough stand 5-15 minutes, and it will thicken up. Other than that, the only downside to these cookies is that you won't be able to stop eating them!

Made these and they were a hit at the office. I added about 1 cup of peanut butter chips (and I probably would add another 1/3 cup and reduce the chocolate chips the equivalent). Put dough in freezer for about 1.5-2 hours. Baked 12 mins only.

I made these yesterday, EVERYONE LOVED them. I used Powdered Espresso (since that is what I had), 1 cup Peanut Butter chips (had to go to 3 stores to get them) and Dark chocolate chips. For some reason, I didn't read the instructions correctly and put the chips in with the flour/nut mixture. I froze the batter for 1.5 hours and used a small (1 TBS.) scoop. Cooked them 13 minutes. I also didn't have time to cook all of them at once, so I left the batter in the freezer for several more hours. Left it on the counter about 10 - 15 minutes and made the rest. I'll make these MANY more times

I wasn't too impressed with the flavor of these cookies. However, when I brought them to the office they were a hit! Everyone loved the chewy texture.

I love this site!! I made these cookies after perusing through a back of BonAppetit on my bookshelf. I made the dough as instructed (except no nuts) and thought something was wrong--more of a batter than a cookie dough. I immediately came to the site and found the suggestions to freeze/refigerate the dough before baking (and adding more peanut butter chips). They came out beautifully!! The are the best cookies I have ever put in my mouth!! Thanks all for adding your suggestions to the site

I was looking for a cookie different from my usual chocolate chip standby. This is a very rich cookie. It's almost more like a brownie. One suggestion: Do not overbake these cookies. I baked my first batch for 15 minutes and they were somewhat dry and "grainy" as another reviewer put it. However, on the remainder of the batches I baked for only 12-13 minutes, didn't even let them become totally set in the center and they came out gooey and fudgy. Very good! I froze my batter for several hours before I baked them and that worked out well also. Definitely need a glass of milk with these!

yum yum, i also had to freeze the dough/batter first (first batch without freezing was really flat looking) and i baked for about 12 mins. everyone in the office loved them!

Delicious cookies! I was skeptical at first after reading how little flour was in the recipe but they turned out great. I agree with the other users that there needs to be more than 1/2 cup peanut butter chips. Also, because I used unsweetened shredded coconut, I added 1/4 cup dark brown sugar to add a little more sweetness and caramel flavor. They were so good that next time I'll be doubling the recipe!!!

These are WONDERFUL cookies. I do alot of cookies for the holidays and these are the best. I have made FOUR Batches for gifts, If my husband will leave them alone...lol..

The only problem with these cookies is that they are soooooo good, I can't stop eating them!!! Minor alterations: I used 3/4 cup of flour, the whole bag of peanut butter chips and 2 cups of walnuts. Also, I put the first tray of cookies into the oven without refrigeration, and the second tray came out much better (because I put the dough--actually more of a batter, into the freezer while the first batch baked).

This is amazing! I used the whole 10 oz. bag of peanut butter chips. A good mistake!

These are great! Because I don't like walnuts, I used peanuts instead. To me, there's no better combination than peanut and chocolate!

This cookie recipe is delicious! Made it for a cookie contest and got first place. For a true chocolate lover. I kept the recipe the same, but increased the peanut butter chips to 1 cup. I didn't need to refrigerate the batter, but I used the mixer for a full three minutes, which may have helped. Baked the cookies for 13 minutes. They were extremely moist and almost brownie like on the inside, even after sitting for two days. Great recipe!!!

This is a great cookie recipe. I've found it to be much better with butterscotch chips. I add 1 C butterscotch chips and 1/2 C chocolate chips at the end (vs 1 C choclate and 1/2 C butterscotch). Super yummy.

Fabulous! Rich, intense chocolate flavor and aroma. I agree with previous reviewers - increase the peanut butter chips from 1/2 Cup to 1 Cup; I found that 3/4 Cup wasn't enough. I reduced the amount of chocolate chips stirred into the batter from 1 Cup to 3/4 Cup; perhaps 1/2 Cup would have sufficed. Definitely chill the dough for 1 - 2 hours prior to shaping and baking the cookies; the batter will be too runny if you don't. A 2 Tablespoon capacity cookie scoop makes shaping the cookies easy. Cookies made from 2 level tablespoons of dough required 12 minutes baking time and produced approximately 48 cookies. I used Kaiser's "Tinned Steel Cookie Sheets", which were recommended by the magazine "Cook's Illustrated".

This was a great recipe. I used a lot of the suggestions of other reviewers- chilled the cookie dough, shortened the cooking time- they were fantastic! They were definitely a bit time consuming- but worth it. The only other change I made to the recipe was the peanut butter chips. We don't eat partially-hydrogenated oil, and it was impossible to find peanut butter chips without it- so I bought some organic chunky peanut butter and froze tiny chip-size scoops in the freezer for an hour before adding them to the batter. They were delicious!! I have been receiving rave reviews on these cookies all day and will definitely make them in the future!

Very good chocolate taste. However, it isn't very peanut buttery - next time I would add 1 c. of peanut butter chips (instead of 1/2 c.) and 1/2 c. (instead of 1 c.) semisweet chocolate chips to the batter. Otherwise it is a very tasty cookie.

By the time you toast the coconut, melt the chocolate, chill the dough and bake these cookies you've spent half of your afternoon in the kitchen and the end result is just not worth it. Your time would be better spent adding coffee, nuts and peanut butter chips to a box mix of brownies.

Call me crazy but these cookies taste grainy. Also, fifteen minutes is much too long and use way more chocolate chips.

Thanks to the Personal Chef who suggested chilling the dough before baking - the cookies turned out plump and delicious. I chilled for 2 hours and then baked for 15-16 minutes. I had a little trouble telling when they were done and overcooked the first sheet. I decided that once the center-top was set, they didn't need to crack. I too increased the peanut butter chips to 1 cup, and the balance was perfect. The cookies also freeze well.

We baked our cookies in two batches, removing the first batch from the oven after ten minutes (the recipe says to bake for fifteen minutes) and the bottoms were burnt. Shortening the baking time even further for the second batch yielded delicious cookies. We agree with the previous reviewers who suggest increasing the peanut butter chips; we think that chocolate and peanut butter is one of the best combos going.

These were good and looked very professional thanks to the recipe and the suggestions by the professional cook on the comments page.

These were just OK. Too many different flavors. The first thing I would leave out would be the coconut - even though I really like coconut. The fudgy part of the cookie is just what I expected - perfect.

One of the best cookies I've ever had. I added a lot more peanut butter chips, about a whole cup, and they were perfect.

My chef boyfried said these were the best cookies he ever had. I used toffe chips instead of peanut butter chips. I would have liked more nuts in them. The first batch stuck to the parchment paper. I buttered the paper for the next batch and they worked better. I'll be making these again for sure!

As a personal chef, I made this recipe for a fund raising event in NYC where a group of personal chefs donated their time and food for a "tasting menu"....these cookies were the sweet I made and they were a HUGE success. Everyone at the event raved about them, and people were stuffing them into their purses/briefcases so they could take home a few "for later"....I did find that the dough benefits from chilling in the fridge for an hour or so, they hold their shape better and are more "rounded" than flat once baked. I also did increase the peanut butter chips to 3/4 of a cup...makes the flavor more pronounced and I've found people love a cookie just "stuffed with chips"...everyone loved the combination of "fudgy cookie" with the decadance of all the chips.

Very different, but very good. Has a little something for everyone. I would however, up the peanut butter chips, decrease the choc. chips-maybe even swap the measurents. It's already very chocolatly and the peanut butter wasn't in every cookie.

excellent, very rich. Must eat with milk and or ice cream! chocolate lovers will rave.

I couldn't find any peanut butter chips so I substituted them for chunky peanut butter (less sugar that way). The result was fantastic. Something of a cross between a chocolate brownie, peanut butter cookie and macaroon.
