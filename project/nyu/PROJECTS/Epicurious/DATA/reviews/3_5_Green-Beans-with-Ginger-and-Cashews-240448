Made this as a side for Thanksgiving dinner. I was really easy to make- I blanched the green beans early in the day and stored them in the fridge as suggested and the beans turned out tender and crisp. My cranberry sauce had ginger in it, which I think complimented the green beans. It was nice to have something lighter tasting to break up all the starchy, rich (but delicious) sides. Would also make a great side dish for most dinners.

This recipe was a winner, even with my husband who does not like anything veggie-related. It was easy to prepare and turned out great!

I would probably give this 2.5 forks if it would let me. These green beans were good, different from what I'm used to, but they had good flavor. I would probably use less ginger next time (I didn't really measure to the specifications of the recipe) The crunchiness of the cashews is a nice change to regular green beans. I'll make this one again with less ginger and cashews so the taste of the green beans comes out a little more.

I'm not a huge fan of green bean casserole, but I definitely think that green beans should be a part of Thanksgiving, so I made this as directed. It was nice to have it on the plate with all the other heavy starches, helped to cut the heaviness a bit. Next time I make it I might try olive oil instead of butter just to make it a bit healthier, the flavors were a good combination.

I made this last night for a dinner party and it was a smash hit. I will definitely make this again and again....

I made this for Thanksgiving. It was delicious, got rave reviews and guests requested the recipe. Only change was substituting vegetable broth for chicken broth so that vegetarians could enjoy it also.

This dish was amazing. I didn't tweak a thing and even after making it, I would keep the recipe as is!

Love this dish, very easy to make and delicious!! I think the buttery ginger indeed adds a festive holiday flavour, more reminiscent of German/Dutch Christmas spiced cookies than Asian food. A real treat.

I made this for Thanksgiving as is and received rave reviews. I also made it for a weekday dinner with carrots. I added a handful of raisins to the carrots while steaming and a sprinkle of cinnamon to the ginger butter before adding in the carrots. Delicious!!

This was an outstanding recipe. The cashews were a great touch. I did not chop them. I left them whole and that was just as nice. I used the turkey stock right from the cooked turkey drippings and it was great. Not need to use canned turkey stock unless you are not making this recipe with a turkey.

I thought these were good but my husband raved about them - even re-heated the leftovers the next day! I think these would be really good served over brown rice with tofu. Quick and easy!

I liked this dish, however; I didn't think it should be served for Thanksgiving. The ginger threw me off... reminded me of Asian- fare that I eat at other times of the year. I blanched the green beans ahead of time, which proved to be a great time saver on the holiday. I'll make it again... just not for Thanksgiving.

The flavor was good, but the beans did not cook according to the recipe. I'm not sure I would do this again.

I prepared and served this for Thanksgiving yesterday and it was a big hit! Super low stress as I am just learning how to really cook (no out of box stuff anymore). Great flavor and the kids even tried it because of the nuts.

Made this with broccoli and slivered almonds, and it was good. Toasted almonds and stirred them in just prior to serving. Yummy in my tummy.
