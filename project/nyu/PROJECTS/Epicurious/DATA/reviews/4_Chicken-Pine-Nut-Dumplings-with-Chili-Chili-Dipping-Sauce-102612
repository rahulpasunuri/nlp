I use this recipe as inspiration for turkey burgers and serve them over rice with the dipping sauce and Asian flavored cabbage slaw. The burgers are good sautéed or cooked on the grill. Quick, easy and delicious. I am sure the dumplings are fantastic too.

This is a great recipe for cooking with kids. While it can be time consuming if you are doing it solo, there are plenty of tasks that kids can help with. Older ones can chop and measure. Younger ones can prep the wrappers and "paint" the water on the edges for sealing.

I thought this was an excellent recipe. I added three cloves of garlic to the mixture and used round dumpling skins, which I used to form pleated dumplings as well as the ones that look like crowns. I browned some of them, but do not know if this added anything other than oil. Definitely make this!

I really enjoyed the dumplings, but thought the paired sauce was way too heavy on the vinegar. I added sugar and mirin to make it palatable. I toasted the pine nuts before chopping and adding them. I may try pistachios instead next time.

a little time consuming to make but well worth the effort!

These are absolutely the best - I hate water chestnuts so I omit those. I fry mine first and then add broth to steam. These really are spectacular.

i'd like to make this recipe. can one brown in oil then add broth to the saute pan cover and cook that way?

As with any dumpling, these can take a little while. The ingredients are easily put together, but the filling and shaping can take a bit of time. It is worth it, however. My roommate still talks about them! Also, I kept some in the freezer to be able to steam little batches at a time. They were still delicious.

Delicious!I made these using turkey instead of chicken, and left out the pine nuts because I didn't have any, and they were gobbled up by adults as well as kids. Yummy! I found that quickly dipping the wrappers in warm water helped them to seal better -- I wet them, then pinched and pleated the ends to seal them shut and steamed them 10 minutes.

I've made these dumplings numerous times and they're always a huge hit. Rather than expensive pine nuts, I actually prefer cheap chopped nut topping (the kind you put on sundaes), which is mostly peanuts and gives the dumplings a more interesting nutty texture. I also use jarred hot chili oil rather than making the sauce. Makes a great appetizer!!

These were delicious! A bit labor-intensive, but worth it. We took the other cooks' advice of browning lightly before steaming, and it really added a nice chewy texture. I also added a small amount of garlic to the dipping sauce, which to me made it more Asian-takeout-authentic. These were a big hit at the party to which we brought them. The few leftovers the next day were great too...

I have done this a couple of times, and it has been great. After a couple of times it actually became much easier and faster to prepare. Great for snacks at aprties..!!

Made this dish for a girls night out and was wonderful! Instead of just steaming them I, too, browned them first in a little bit of vegetable and sesame oil and then steamed them with 1/2 cup of chicken stock and 1/2 cup of water. Very tasty.

These dumplings are by far one of the most popular dishes I've ever made. Easy to make and can be frozen then steamed without defrosting. I also bought a dumpling mold which keeps them uniform and attractive. Fabulous!

This was an excellent recipe! I left out the sherry and used ground turkey (couldn't find chicken) and it still turned out great.

These are the best chicken dumplings I've ever had. I wasn't quite hungry at dinner due to the testing I had to do on each batch;) My friends raved over these and have all asked for the recipe. I only wish I could give it "ten forks!"

In case you have not steamed meat before, you don't have to cook the ground chicken first. I made this for a dinner party - I thought I had over-brought the appropriate number for guests, and started to worry that I would look like I was grandstanding (there were 30 guests and I brought about 120). They were gone in less than an hour, despite the fact that we were late to the party. I would make them spicier and add cilantro next time, but they were a BIG hit.

I make this alot to bring to cocktail parties. I skip the dipping sauce recipe that goes with it, and I use a store bought product called Soy-Vay that is much tastier. I get asked for this recipe all the time!

Delicious! I've made them with chicken and with smoked pork loin and they've been wonderful every time! Do take the advice of the reviewer below and DON'T let them touch if you freeze them ahead of time and when you steam them. I wouldn't change a thing!

I'm probably among the minority here, but I did not like these very much. IF I made them again, I would make some modifications. First I used ground turkey, which may have been part of the problem. The filling just seemed very dry. Also, my sauce turned out very vinegar-y, I think they'd be better with a sweet and sour dipping sauce. I didn't HATE this recipe, but these didn't seem worth the effort.

I made these wonderful dumplings (with the chili dipping sauce) as appetizers for Thanksgiving. I have since made then two or three times for guests, and everyone has raved about them. They are excellent! I misread the recipe the first time and instead of using ground chicken, I filled them with the chicken that comes canned like tuna fish... it was great that way! And easier! They are quite labor intensive to put together so make sure you have enough time (or an assistant. Also, make sure that if you freeze them that they don't touch at all until they are fully frozen, or else the wrappers will fall apart. Ditto for when you steam them. You won't want even one to be ruined since they are addictive!

While a little high maintenence, this turned out to be a delicious addition to our holiday party, and the most popular as well. I suggest taking advantage that you can prepare these up to two weeks in advance. Also, once completely frozen, these can be removed from the cookie sheets and put in Ziploc bags. This frees up space in you freezer, and allows you to use the cookie sheet for other purposes

This is wonderful tasting- restaraunt quality, though it does take a bit of practice to assemble and some time to steam. I couldn't find chili oil for the sauce so I used chili sauce and combined it with sesame oil. It was delicious. This is so easy, I'd definately make it again.

I used this filling and made deep fried wontons. The cilantro and pine nuts are a nice change from the typical wonton filling. Served with sweet and sour chili sauce. Next time will try in steamed dumplings. Used my food processor to grind my chicken and chop the other ingredients as well. Tasty and super easy to prepare.

These were delicious. I used dark chicken meat,and made some changes -- I cooked them like pot stickers - browned first, then covered and steamed with plum sauce and water.

This recipe was a hit with the adults and children at our party. I substituted ground turkey for the chicken and it worked beautifully (they also froze great). I would suggest making the chili dipping sauce at least 24 hours ahead of time. It really improves the flavor. This recipe is a keeper!

Richmond, VA. I made this for a New Year's Eve party and it was a hit! Everybody loved it. The hostess got the recipe and is making it for another dinner party. It takes some practice to put it together, but it is well worth it! I would definitely make this again.

These were so good! I made them for a New Year's Eve party I went to and all 50 of them went. It's nice that you can make these a few days ahead and freeze them. Such an impressive dish!!

Wonderful!! A huge hit at holiday party. I made this a week in advance, very easy. It was a bit time-consuming to put them together, but very well worth it. Every one was so impressed that I made these.
