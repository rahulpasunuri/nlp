This is a favorite on those lazy Sundays. Easy to make and cheap too! My only complaint was the yolks would get very hard, but with less cooking time, the bread was soggy. To compensate, I used less half and half and cooked for 15-18 min. Seemed to do the trick!

I made these in individual gratin dishes. I thought 20 minutes was too long to cook the eggs and I like mine quite firm. I wasn't sure I liked the breadcrumb mush part, but the flavor of it was great and it was beautiful. I can't imagine whapping it onto serving plates from the pie plate and wrecking the beautiful golden top.

Great recipe - a keeper!! It was easy to make and taste is wonderful. I used the Cheshire cheese which gave the eggs a nice "sharp" flavor. Enjoy!!
