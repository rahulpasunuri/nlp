i've done it! i'm so thankful i didn't actually make kemp minifie's rhubarb fool until summer was nearly over. had i discovered it early on in the season, i would have certainly been forced to sew elastic into the waistbands of all my pants. i haven't done the research, but i'm going to go with my hunch and say that the humble fool is the precursor to and inspiration for all of those crazy jello, mayonnaise, cool whip and fruit cocktail concoctions that became so popular in the 50's in that it's fluffy and fruity and creamy in the same way, except that it's made with wonderful ingredients that a common homemaker was likely to have had on hand: heavy cream, sugar, vanilla and in its season, rhubarb. the fool itself is difficult to describe...somewhere between a pudding and a mousse, but with tiny tart threads of fruit to counterbalance the richness of the whipped cream. as is often the case with desserts featuring rhubarb, it's not much of a looker. that said, i did add about 10 sliced strawberries to the rhubarb as it was cooking down, just to give it a bit of a rosy hue. as one would imagine, it's quite rich, and just the smallest bit is completely satisfying. heck, yes i'm going to make it again, experimenting with different fruits and possibly adding liqueurs to the whipped cream. i may use a bit of it between layers of a lemon pound cake. i don't know, but i'm quite pleased to have it in my arsenal..thank you, kemp, for sharing this!

Why have I not made this yet? Let's see...fresh whipped cream, rhubarb, sugar and vanilla folded gently into a charming, old-timey dessert. What is there not to like? Let's couple this with the fact that I have a freezer and garden that are both brimming with rhubarb, it is too hot to turn the oven on. If I wanted to really pour it on, I could remind everyone that this recipe comes to us from a true cooking world legend, and a much-missed publication. It represents a delicious little piece of our culinary history, truth be told. I'm making it! Stay tuned, fellow epicurious readers!
