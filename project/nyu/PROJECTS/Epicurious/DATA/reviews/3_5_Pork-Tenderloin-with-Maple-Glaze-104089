I really love this recipe. It's so simple and the ingredients are usually on hand. I have made it once as directed and once with shallots, fuji apples, and dried cherries. Adding the unsweetened dried cherries makes the recipe. I will be making this regularly since it's so simple & delicious.

First time I have ever had smoked pork chops and stumbled upon this recipe and improvised. Cooked the chops on the BBQ until just done then finished them in the frying pan with the sauce. Added more maple syrup as previously noted and let the sauce reduce until thick. Big hit!

Absolutely delicious. Unfortunately, I halved the recipe. Won't make that mistake again, because everyone in my household, from the eleven-month-old on up wolfed it down.

Double sauce. Reduce vinegar by 1/3rd. Additional ingredients for a double batch of sauce: 3/4 c shallots sliced into rings or slivers 1 c apple, quartered and sliced. Honey crisp worked well. 3/4 cranberries Modify recipe as follows: Remove pork after browning and cover with aluminum foil. Add additional butter to skillet and sauté shallots, apples, and cranberries until shallots are tender. Deglaze with 4 T of vinegar (assuming the sauce has been doubled). Add maple syrup/vinegar/dijon mustard mixture, bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Slice pork into 1/2 inch thick medallions and add to skillet, cover and simmer, checking until medallions are barely pink in the center.

Thanks to earlier reviewers whose suggestions definitely made a good sauce an excellent one: adding fresh cranberries, apples and shallots allowed the sauce to thicken with more complex flavours and textures. I served with a dry riesling from Tawse Winery. Fantastic...

The maple glaze from this recipe is one of the most delicious sauces I've ever made. Fantastic flavor, and so simple. This one is going into heavy rotation, for sure. My only complaint: I cooked the pork to 150 degrees exactly as the recipe states, and found it a bit overcooked for my liking.

Rating: 4
Two more thoughts on my review below, I used a 1.25 lb tenderloin but the same amount for the glaze/sauce. I also pulled off heat at 125 degrees, it was still a little over done for my liking. I also let letting the sauce thicken up a bit.

Needed a maple recipe after visiting a sugar shack and buying a quart of still-warm Grade B syrup. Loved this! Pulled recipe up on my iphone so only had a few reviews to read, and glad saw I the suggestion of adding shallots, apples, 1/2c cranberries (i soaked dried in courvoisier for 1/2 hour). It was fantastic - served with simple sauteed greens and whole roasted yams. I used coconut oil and grapeseed to fry due to dairy allergies at table and didn't miss it. Will be making again soon.

If you like maple syrup on pancakes or waffles, but think dinner entrees don't need to be quite that sweet, then I bet you will like this recipe as much as I do! I didn't have apple cider vinegar in the house, but used white wine vinegar and it not only worked fine, but I will purposely use it the next time I make this dish! My suggestion for anyone who is worried the finished pork and sauce may taste too sweet or too sour, is to go ahead and taste the sauce before you add it to the cooking pan and before it touches raw or undercooked meat. Be sure no utensils that have touched raw or undercooked meat are used for the tasting, either. Then you can add more syrup or more vinegar according to your taste.

Although I did not read all the reviews here...just too many, so I made it as written. I found the sauce runny and WAY to much vinegar flavor. Might try again with more syrup.

This recipe was absolutely delicious! I added an extra 2 tablespoons of maple syrup at the end (pure maple syrup from Montreal is too delicious NOT to add more!) and it tasted like heaven! I definitely suggest taking the tenderloin out of the pan at 135º because it continues cooking while it's on the platter. Simple, easy recipe and absolutely delicious!

Fabulous fall dish. I usually do exactly as a recipe suggests but took one reviewers suggestion and coated with a little flour. Seared it in a cast iron pan in melted butter on our grill burner outside to alleviate potential smoking and finished in a second pan indoors. Served with mashed garden butternut squash and fresh green beans. A keeper.

Rating: 4
I have made this several times. I have found that the difference between 3 forks and 4 forks with this recipe is the degree to which you brown the butter and meat. I accidentally came close to burning the butter one time, adding the pork at the last possible minute, and then browned the pork well, too, with lots of brown bits in the pan. It was fantastic - like a completely different recipe. Since that time I always brown the butter instead of just melting it, and get the meat very brown too, and it is delicious.

My husband said this was the best pork tenderloin he has ever had and I agree. It turned out perfect! Moist and tender and full of flavor. I did not have sage, so I crumbled some fresh rosemary and mixed it with marjoram... it was so delicious that I will just use that next time as well. If I was served this dish in a restaurant I would be impressed, but it wasn't... it was served in my dining room:) Great recipe to go to for a large dinner party, since its easy to make and cheap! I recommend to serve it with a slightly bitter side, like escarole or a warm endive salad, went perfect!

Simple and absolutely delicious!! I didn't have any cider vinegar on hand so I combined seasoned rice vinegar and malt vinegar, which was lovely and followed other reviewers' advice by adding apples (gala, with skins intact) and onions which I sliced thinly and arranged around the tenderloin. I think kale would be a pretty and tasty addition as well. It was moist and tender, and a huge hit with everyone! This is a splendid dish for company as it's so easy and presents beautifully cut into medallions. I served alongside broiled brussels sprouts with toasted walnuts and mashed yukon gold potatoes. Will definitely be making again and again! The apples and onions were key.

I reviewed this on 3/20/2009 but I made an adjustment last night that was fantastic.

Holy cow it was GOOD! Most definitely doing that again!

The meat had too much of a sage flavor which gave it a gamey taste. No one like it so I will have to keep looking for that easy and tasty recipe for Pork tenderloin.

Really tasty and I followed a bunch of advice from other reviewers. I cut down the vinegar by 1 Tbsp, and I could have cut by even more. I did two Tbsp of mustard instead of 2 tspn. Also chopped the fresh sage and fried it in oil till crispy, then rolled the loin in that. Added chopped onion and chunks of apple to the simmering glaze, then finished it by adding a bit of butter. Had to cook the one loin twice as long. Reduced the glaze a bit. Will definitely make again, maybe with more mustard and less vinegar.

We all loved it. The recipe is very easy. I only had one pork tenderloin. I made the full amount of glaze. It was so good, I will definitely make 2 tenderloins next time. I will double the glaze. We had it with rice and mixing the rice with pork and glaze was delicious. I only had fresh sage. I chopped it up and it worked fine.

We've had this recipe in our collection for a while, but somehow slipped to the back of the stack. Found last night while looking for something quick to do with a pork tenderloin.

Before cooking the pork tenderloins, I salt them and let them rest for an hour. I agree with the other reviews about reducing to a thicker sauce and adding more mustard. Very delicous, and the flavors are a little unique yet still lends itself to being a comfort food. I make it with the deviled roasted potatoes.

I also LOVED this recipe. I like to use fresh herbs when I can so I chopped fresh sage and fried it in a little olive oil until crispy then rubbed it on the tenderloin, the taste of the sage really came out.I like many others ommitted the last T. of maple syrup. I recommend making more sauce it is delicious!

This was really tastey. I modified the recipe so that it could be used with the ingredients I had - olive oil, 4 porc chops, a chopped onion in the pan until the pork chop was cooked and then I added the maple syrup, cider vinegar, a crushed garlic clove, and old style mustard. I let it simmer for a little while and then removed the chops to reduce the sauce. It turned out really well and I will look forward to making these again!

Like almost everyone, I love this dish: it's simple, satisfying, and very tasty. If you cut back on the butter and take it easy on the sauce, it's also a low calorie entree. Speaking of sauce, I like to reduce the sauce on high heat for about 10 minutes while the pork is resting.

Wonderful. I expected this to be a bit on the burnt side as my tenderloins took more like 20 minutes to cook and I did not use a non stick pan. I used a vanilla maple syrup that was fantastic. Too bad that I used the last bit of that syrup! I may add a little vanilla extract to it next time to try and duplicate it. The vanilla addition gave it a bit of a homey yet sophisticated taste. I was very much surprised. Used ground sage as I did not have dried leaves...it was still great.

If you're from the South (like me), you'll absolutely LOVE this dish -- the perfect combination of savory and sweet that Southerners love. We've made this for years now, following the recipe exactly (no doubling of sauce or eliminating sage). Be sure to buy crushed sage rather than rubbed sage for the pork. Surprisingly, it makes a big difference. Perfect for company because it's so wonderful or a weeknight because it's so simple.

This recipe is a keeper! It really is a 3 1/2 fork recipe!

Very good. I seared it on the stove and finished it in the oven. Everyone enjoyed the sauce. I thought the sage was an essential flavor in the dish. It would have been mediocre without it.

This sauce was so delicious. I had a 3lb. pork tenderloin, which worked just fine, but I definetely had to cook it longer than the recipe called for. My only regret is that I didn't make extra sauce.

This is always a winner. I usually use whatever herb(s) I have on hand, fresh or dried, and it always turns out beautifully - even Mrs Dash works. The only thing I do differently is to reduce the glaze a bit longer than the recipe calls for as I like a thicker glaze rather than a runny sauce. If you don't like things too sweet then it's easy enough to reduce the maple syrup and cut back on the apple cider vinegar accordingly. This is definitely worth trying. One of my friends was so impressed with this recipe that she submitted it to a magazine's recipe contest and won!

Rating: 2
Just a little too sweet for me. i changed 2 things: used dried herbes de provence since i'm not crazy about dried rubbed sage; and i reduced the glaze to make it...a glaze, not a sauce. i'd be inclined to fiddle with this a bit since i believe it has a lot of potential for a "come on over" weekday dinner. long grain/wild rice pilaf (maybe next time throw in some dried cranberries?) is good with this: put it under meat and pour glaze over all.

Tasted good but nothing terrific. I doubled the glaze and really didn't need it. The pork itself was cooked perfectly...I took it off the heat at about 145 degrees. Juicy without being pink. I think I'll look for a different recipe next time.

Based on other people's reviews, here were the changes I made for a single, fabulous, easy weekday, make-it-again honey, pork tenderloin that I would also serve to non-fancy guests: --Used 4 tsp vinegar instead of 6 (and used balsamic since I didn't have cider) --Used 1 and 1/2 times as much maple syrup (and I admit I used the fake stuff--was still awesome) --10 min into the pork cooking I threw one uncooked sliced apple and a sliced onion UNDER the pork and kept it covered (that way not mushy and all the flavor) --Accidentally rubbed whole pork w/ mustard (direction from a different recipe) and then added salt/pepper/sage instead of putting mustard in the syrup mix --Takes 20 to 25 min stove top on med-low (after the med-high part for crispness), but make sure to take it off while inside still reasonably pink. It really does keep cooking on counter while it sits for 10 min.

I took everyone's advice and used balsamic vinegar. By mistake, I skipped the step of deglazing with vinegar (or vinegar/water), but the syrup/vinegar/mustard glaze did a fine job of deglazing on its own. This was incredibly easy, and truly delicious. Several guests asked for the recipe.

After reading other reviews, I decided to make a few minor adjustments. I rubbed the tenderloins with thyme leaves and ground sage, S&P. Browned/seared, then put into the oven at 350 with internal thermometer set to go off at 150F. I did use Balsamic vinegar and went with four tablespoons. I deglazed with one tablespoon balsamic and one tablespoon water. I then mixed up the glaze, I wish I had some real maple syrup hanging around (the shame, I'm in Canada!) but I had to use lite Aunt Jemima's...still, it turned out quite tasty....next time, I'll use the real deal. When the tenderloin was ready, I let it sit ten minutes, then put it in the pan with juices, then added glaze and heated two min. Took out tenderloins and sliced. Cooked down glaze a bit, added the other Tablespoon of syrup and a bit more pepper. Served as a regular everyday dinner with rice and peaches and cream corn. The tenderloins were perfect, moist and tender. Everyone loved it, very tasty, even my five and ten year olds. It was quick, easy and tasty, it's a keeper.

Great tasting and so easy. I actually browned the pork on the stovetop and then roasted in the oven @375C for 20 min. I finished it by following the rest of the directions.

Rating: 3
This was very easy and the sweet and sour flavors are delicious and complex. I either use just one pork loin or double the glaze recipe because I like to have glaze to send around at the table. Also, even when my thermometer reads 150, it's pretty red inside, so you might want to allow a little extra time. My dinner guests really liked this one and had no idea how easy it was!

Rating: 3
The flavor is relatively complex when you consider how few ingredients there are and how easy it is. I substituted 1/2 lb. of boneless pork chops for the loin, made 1/2 the sauce, and reduced the cooking time. However, while it's good enough for me, I would not serve it to company.

Rating: 4
Excellent dish! I followed the other reviewers' recommendations and made extra glaze. Also, cooking time is WAY more than the 10 minutes recommended here. All in all, great, easy recipe.

This was a wonderful fall weekday meal -- not too difficult, but delicious. Thanks for the suggestions, since I think the balsamic vinegar was a perfect substitution and the glaze makes a wonderful addition to steamed baby-cut carrots. I was lazy and served wild rice, but the sauce that seeped into the rice was sooo good -- a bit of bread to mop up the leftovers and now I'm waddling to bed!

Rating: 3
This is a really good recipe. I doubled the glaze recipe and used a bit less of the cider vinegar. The meat did take about 20 minutes to cook, too, so plan for that. It turned out really well (although I had some extra glaze) and everyone loved it. I served it with a bacon, butternut squash, and pecan risotto (from the Williams Sonoma "Seasons" cookbook) and fresh green beans. It was a delicious fall meal and got great reviews from our guests.

Rating: 3
I loved the maple taste, and found this pretty painless to make, except that it took quite a bit longer than 10 minutes for the pork to cook. Next time I'll raise the heat a little and allow for it to take more like 20 minutes to reach 150--you definitely need an instant read thermometer for this. I do intend to make it again, it was very tasty.

Rating: 3
This was delicious, but I had some trouble getting the pork loin done. Maybe that's because the one I bought was really thick on one end. I used balsamic vinegar instead of cider vinegar and reduced the amount to four tablespoons. I also added some apples to the glaze and made double the amount.

Made as written. This is a very easy recipe but I made it for a small dinner party and was a bit bored with it. (My gracious guests were complimentary however.) I probably would not make this again, only because there are millions of other recipes out there that I haven't made yet.

I added apples and sauteed them as the pan was deglazing. I also added rosemary sprigs and water and boiled for a little longer to extract those flavors and soften the apples. Finally I added pork drippings that came from the meat as it rested and finished it off with a little cold butter. Yummy.

I've made this a few times now, tinkering with it a little each time based on suggestions by other raters. Good ideas were: doubling the amount of sauce, adding a shallot, adding diced apple, slightly reducing the amount of vinegar, finishing the sauce with a little butter. While not a great dish, this is pretty good, and quite easy. I can't help but wonder whether a few previous raters who complained about unpleasant tastes and/or smells were using real maple syrup. The horrible fake stuff would, I'm sure, ruin this meal.

Rating: 3
Served this at a small dinner party and it was a big hit. I used fresh sage and decreased the vinegar as suggested; doubled the sauce recipe overall. I might be in the minority, but for my tastes, garlic has no place in this recipe. I also added the apples to the sauce, as suggested, but found that they picked up a lot of the acidic flavor of the vinegar. (Not sure I'd add them next time around) Served it with shredded brussels sprouts and roasted sweet potatoes. Overall a real winner.

Simply excellent! Following other reveiwers advice, I rubbed the pork with garlic and a few fresh tarragon leaves (was out of sage), and added cubed apples and diced shallots before deglazing the pan. I also cut back the vinegar by 1 1/2 TBS. Also served the Apple, Dried Cherry and Walnut salad w/ Maple dressing. Definitely a meal suitable for entertaining.

We really liked this pork tenderloin recipe. It was easy to make and very good. I browned on top of stove and finished in oven. Maple Glaze was wonderful. I agree with all other raters..make a bit more of the glaze for extra goodness. Added a bit of fresh sage at the end.

Rating: 2
I followed the directions to a "t," and this didn't live up to the hype. The maple glaze didn't have much oomph and was not worth the effort.

Rating: 4
Excellent with a few little changes. Rubbed garlic on the pork along with the sage. Doubled the sauce per previous recommendation, and decreased the vinegar in the vinegar/maple/dijon mix by 1 tablespoon. When you turn down the heat to finish the pork, I added 1 more tablespoon butter and 1/4 cup finely diced shallot. By the time the pork was done, the shallot had caramelized and was a very nice addition. I added 1 tablespoon water to the vinegar used for deglazing. I think next time I make it I will make even more sauce so I can spoon it over white rice. YUM!!

Rating: 4
This had to be the best way to do a pork tenderloin I've ever tried. It was cooked to perfection following the directions exactly. I did double the amount of sauce and am glad I did! Because he's on a low-carb diet I did substitute sugar-free pancake/waffle syrup for the maple syrup. I boiled it down for a few minutes before I added the meat back to the skillet and it was a perfect glaze consistency. We'll do this one many times in the future!

The best part about this recipe is that the pork was very succulent -- a nice surprise for a stove top preparation. I too added some diced apple and shallots and reduced the vinegar amount. This was good, but there are better recipes for pork tenderloin. Served with the sage, onion, and wild rice risotto also found on Epicurious.

Simple, delicious, and eye pleasing, this maple-flavored sweet and sour concoction became an instant favorite at our house. The sauce lifts the tenderloin flavor from mundane to sublime. The aroma from the sage simmering in butter is intoxicating. Trust me on this one; make it tonight.

Easy, elegant, and oh so tasty. Made twice, first time exactly as per recipe, second time using fresh sage, and rubbing tenderloins with cut garlic cloves first. Husband loved it, and i even liked it ( i don't eat pork!) Served with sesame asparagus and baby carrots with balsamic vinagar and butter glaze (both from this site). Got the tenderloins on sale at $1.19 a lb, so had several in the freezer.

Rating: 4
My family loved this recipe. I have made it twice in two weeks since they wanted it again. I skipped the sage and I added more maple syrup and less vinegar to keep it sweet. I have young children who loved it. I soaked the meat in a brine solution for 6 hours then patted it dry before cooking and it cut like butter and melted in your mouth. Brine: 2 quarts water, 1/3 cup kosher salt and 1/4 cup sugar.Rinse the meat off and pat dry before cooking. It was awesome!

Rating: 3
Added shallot and apple as suggested by another rater. This was really good! Agree the vinegar is a tad too dominant. Next time, will probably use 1/2 cider vinegar, and 1/2 apple juice or cider. I expect this will raise my rating to 4 forks.

Wow! This was incredible! I was leary of cooking tenderloin on the stovetop, fearing it would be too dry. My tenderloin was almost 1.5 lbs and therefore took longer to cook than the recipe indicated (about 20 min). I added an extra tablespoon or two of maple syrup because the vinegar seemed to overpower the sauce. The end result was probably the best recipe I have found on the internet. I would feel very comfortable serving this meal to guests. And it was so easy!

Making this dish for the second time in as many weeks - it is fantastic! Before adding the vinegar to deglaze, I added fugi apples cut to 1/2 in dice and 2 tablespoons minced shallots for about 2 minutes until tender. Then the vinegar, the glaze, the pork, etc. It really added some substance to the glaze - and who doesn't like maple syrup, apples and pork?!?!

Two words: De licious! Very simple to prepare and what an outstanding flavour combination, the sage and maple are amazing together.

Fabulous taste & very simple to prepare.

Rating: 4
This was much better than I expected. The sweet/sour combo in the sauce is fantastic. I doubled the sauce and I am glad that I did because it is what makes the dish. Make sure that you use a good quality Vermont maple syrup...grade "B" if you can find it. It has a deeper, richer flavor than grade A. With this few ingredients, the outcome of the dish is strongly dependent on the quality of it's parts. I didn't use a nonstick pan, as the recipe instructed, because I was looking for more bits to deglaze on the bottom of the pan (a nonstick pan interfers with this process). Everything turned out great!

Rating: 4
Double the glaze.....everyone wanted more of it! Had a very picky friend for dinner the night I made it. She sat there looking at the glaze....even suggested I leave a small piece of pork for her without glaze on it, until she tasted it. Everyone loved it and the picky one had seconds!!!

Rating: 3
This is a keeper! Instead of sage, I substituted Italian seasoning (which I believe has some sage in it). The results were great - the meat was moist and flavorful, and the glaze was such a perfect finish. I served it with rice pilaf, oven-roasted sweet potato slices, and spinach salad. After being sliced and topped with the glaze, this dish actually had to sit in a warm oven for 30 to 45 minutes while waiting for my husband who was stuck in traffic. It held beautifully. This would make it a good company dish, since you could prepare it ahead before your guests arrive.

I hope the individual with the negative experience will reconsider - I can't see how you can go wrong with this one. It's definitely worth trying again.

Awful is a polite word to use for this receipe. The maple glaze was bad, really bad. Cooking the tenderloins in a pan wasn't awful but no tenderloins are equal so you had to watch them. I would not waste my money buying pork tenderloins and use this receipe. Even the most modest cook cook do better on their own! I rarely are negative on a receipe but this one was not for company, not for a husband, etc.!!

An absolute must-try dish. I had only cooked tenderloin in the oven before but I loved the stovetop method. The pork was juicy and tender and the sauce was amazing.

Oooh! Fantastic! This recipe was recommended by another poster in the Cooking thread of my message board, and I heartily second her recommendation. The grocery store didn't have whole pork tenderloins, only packages of tenderloin slices, so I had to adjust the cooking times accordingly, but other than that I followed the recipe to the letter. I served this with roasted red potatoes in a parsley/shallot/butter sauce, and green peas. Definitely a keeper.

I've made this twice now. Very very good - but it takes more sage than this to rub a tenderloin. Luckily I grow and dry my own. Good company dinner, especially because it's so simple and requires only six ingredients. Please use REAL maple syrup. Takes about 25 minutes to get the tenderloin to 150 - but that's OK, you can put it on when guests arrive and it leaves you time for cocktails and conversation while the house fills up with the wonderful aroma. I served it with Buttermilk Mashed Potatoes with Caramelized shallots.

Way too sweet! This isn't a meat entree--it's candy, even with the right kind of maple syrup! I _might_ make this again--being sure to rub garlic on the pork along with the sage and to salt and pepper _well_--but would definitely omit the final addition of maple syrup. Without that last addition, it might be okay. I should've trusted my instincts and not added it, but I wanted to give this recipe a chance as written. I do like the combination of the vinegar, syrup, and mustard, but I shuddered at the final product.

I used pork sirloins since I could not find small pieces of tenderloin. I also used a nonstick pan and while pieces did not stick, the juices did flow and the glaze came out well. While the deglazing part probably is not truly deglazing, it was a reasonable facsimile and the end result was good.

This recipe was great and pretty easy to prepare. I substituted equal parts dry mustard, tyme and marjoram for the sage and it was excellent. The only criticism was the time it took to pan roast the tenderloins - more like 20 to 25 minutes. This has become one of our staples.

A question: why does this recipe call for a non-stick pan, then ask you to deglaze? The point of non-stick is so that drippings WON'T stick to the pan, no? Anyway, wouldn't degalzing ruin the pan's finish? What did everyone else use? Please clarify this for me, as I'd like to try making this soon.

The only thing I did different when making this dish was to omit the sage. I didn't think my Husband would like it. I don't know if this is the key to this recipe (I wouldn't think it was). I will stick to the other favorite recipe on here: "PORK TENDERLOIN WITH BALSAMIC-CRANBERRY SAUCE." We all love that recipe around here!!

Great, recipe and very easy! I served over garlic mash...the sauce also tastes great over vegi's! I might use slightly less vinegar next time though....

Awesome!! I made it for my sister's birthday, and everyone wanted the recipe. It was SOOOO good. I made extra glaze, and there was none leftover.

Pretty good. I substituted regular mustard for the dijon mustard, apple juice and white vinegar for cider vinegar. My dad, who doesn't like pork chops, enjoyed it..."It kinda tastes like ham." My glaze never congealed, so I ended up with extra.

Rating: 3
Very tasty. I was out of cider vinegar but substituted rice vinegar and it came out great. The sweet and sour thing works well with the pork. I served it with a lightly au-gratined potato dish and some oven roasted asparagus, and got rave reviews!

Very good recipe as written. Next time I will add my own touches and grill the pork tenderloin with some hickory chips sprinkled over the coals, thicken the glaze more and pour over the slices before serving. As a previous reviewer stated, sweet potatoes with a little butter and cinnamon, and sugar snappers sound like the perfect sides!

Yummy. Nice combination of flavors.

I have now made this recipe several times - once for weekend guests, and it was a real hit! I served it with baked sweet potatoes and frozen sugar snap peas. I let the potatoes bake slowly while visiting with my guests, and this dish cooked so quickly that I spent very little time in the kitchen. Great! Will definitely do again.

Very good and very easy. I used apple juice in place of the cider and brown sugar in place of the maple syrup. For a thicker sauce, I add less juice and a little flour at the end. Very good with a pork stuffing as a side dish. I make this one at least every other week in the winter!

Great recipe, but the pork turns out better if you follow the instructions for Varkenshaas (on this website also). It calls for browning pork in butter on high heat, reducing to med-high and covered for 10 min., and then putting in oven at 350 for 10 min until meat registers 155 degrees. Your pork will be moist and tender this way.

I was sitting at the computer, reading over recipes, waiting for my boneless,skinless, chicken breasts to thaw for supper, when I came across this recipe. Thought I'd give it a try,just for the heck of it, with the chicken. I sauteed the chicken breasts in 1 Tbsp. butter and sprinkled them with some thyme because I can't eat sage. Then, I mixed 6 Tbsp. maple syrup and 3 Tbsp. apple cider vinegar and 2 tsp. dijon mustard, and poured that over the breasts and let it simmer till the sauce thickened and chicken was cooked through. It turned out quite nice although, I'll definitely try the pork, next time. Some garlic might have been nice with the chicken,too.

This dish was absolutely fantastic! I have very discerning friends to try to impress with my cooking.... the only mistake I made with choosing this dish for my dinner party, was to not have enough for seconds! Absolutely wonderful with a potato gratin, a little dallop of apple compote and a wonderful Alsacian gewurtz!

Rating: 3
Great easy recipe! Even better than the cranberry sauce pork tenderloin on 'constant comment'. I followed the recipe exactly using pure maple syrup. Also cooked the meat twice as long than the recipe stated and it really turned beautifully brown on the outside from the glaze. Next time I will make more sauce, because the glaze was truly delicious, and I would have loved to have more. My whole family enjoyed this dinner, even picky 6 yr. old! He said he loved it! That alone makes it a keeper! Served with egg noodles and green beans.

I made this for my inlaws and it was a huge hit. It was easy, and delish - and not dry like other pork recipies I have tried. The only two things i would adjust would be the cooking time - it took a little longer to get it to the proper temp - and the amount of meat. I doubled the amount for five people and there was 2 pieces left. These are not big eaters either. If I had stuck to the amount called for in the recipie there certainly would not have been enough.

Great and really simple! The only problem I had was that I made one tenderloin for my husband an me and it wasn't enough. Enjoy!

This was very easy to make and went over well with both of my very picky eaters. Meat was tender and flavorful. I served it with roasted butternut squash and brussels sprouts...very good.

For two sugar-starved people who have been strenuously dieting for weeks, this dish was a real pleasure. Under normal circumstances, however, I would, like some other reviewers, omit the final tablespoon of maple syrup. Do take the time to boil the juices down into a real glaze, rather than a thin sauce. I used half the amount of pork, but made the full amount of sauce. It went. A very easy dish to put together. I felt no need to use a meat thermometer; I think a test cut to desired degree of doneness is sufficient.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. The pork was jucy, tender and delicious. One of the best things is that it was really quick. I served it with yukon gold potatoes and fresh broccoli. This is definately a tenderloin for entertaining.

Rating: 4
This recipe is excellent!! I made half again as much meat hoping for leftovers and doubled the sauce based on others comments. When the six of us finished dinner, there were two small slices of pork left - no leftovers for lunch. I filled out the menu with a potato gratin, green beans and a pinot noir for a wonderful and satisfying winter dinner.

Use real maple syrup, preferably dark amber (a.k.a. grade B) so it is not too sweet.

This is a nice Autumn dish, and it's a good taste change for the pork. I've made it several times, always good!

My husband was very skeptical. He's not a pork fan and he doesn't like maple syrup. But he said this was a keeper. As long as he's not eating it again next week, it'll be fine. (Though I caught him sopping up the glaze with his rolls - couldn't have tasted too maple syrupy even to him!) It was definately easy to prepare though it took alot more than 10 minutes to get to 150 degrees!

this was delicious and very easy to make. the sauce was very good. i agree with a previous user who said those who thought the sauce was too sweet probably did not use pure maple syrup. the only thing i will do different next time is make more sauce. there wasn't quite enough to go around.

This recipe is definitely going on my 4-Star list. It is quick and easy to prepare. I omitted the sage and did not miss it at all. The tenderloin was very tender and would be great served with a baked sweet potato. This is also a good recipe to half.

Have made this several times because my family loves it, and we are not big fans of sweet meat dishes. If you use real maple syrup in this dish, the effect is very delicate and not too sweet. Try it!

Terrific fast recipe. This quickly replaced our standard Garlic-Lime Tenderloin recipe.

This has to be one of the easiest and best-tasting pork tenderloin recipes I've tried. I didn't add last tablespoon of syrup to avoid too much sweetness. Also used flour/butter roux (just a little) to thicken the sauce some. Delicious.

Quick, delicious and tender. I was looking for a way to use up some "real" maple syrup my boss brought back from a trip to Vermont. We used the leftovers, soaked in sauce, for sandwiches.

We thought this was an excellent dish as well as quick and uncomplicated. I am not a fan of sweet meat dishes, so I was a little hesitant after some of the other reviews. The recipe was not too sweet at all, it had a much stronger vinegar flavor. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I made this last night for a dinner party and all agreed it was delicious. Served it with wild rice with pecans and brussel sprouts. As a major fan of pork tenderloin, I thought the recipe was quick and easy and would definitely give it another whirl. My glaze was a little on the watery side. Maybe more syrup next time?

Rating: 4
I have made this simple tasty recipe at least 5 times since the article came out. For every occasion from sophisticated supper to a last minute quick dinner. I usually make it with pork loins and be sure to use the "real" maple syrup. My sister made it with one of the pancake syrups and it was inedible.

I'm no master chef, so I was a skeptical when I saw that the sauce called for maple syrup, vinegar and dijon mustard. Interesting. But they all came together to make this the tastiest pork dish I've made. Added a little more syrup to the sauce at the end, just to crank it up. Served it with fresh beets (not canned! Don't do canned!) to take advantage of the vinegar. Crazy? Maybe. But yum!

I've tried lots of different ways to prepare pork tenderloin and this is definitely one of my favorites. All my kids loved it - they even ate the green beans dipped in the sauce. It was very easy to make, I will definitely make this again.

Easy and delicious! Made this for my in-laws last night and we all loved it. Even my three children (not great meat eaters) did justice to the meal. I have to wonder if those complaining that the sauce was too sweet were using pure maple syrup. We loved the sauce and used bread to soak up the last of it! No left-overs here! I will definitely make this again!

I thought this recipe was delicious. The only thing I did different was I grilled the pork tenderloins and sliced them and served the sauce over them. They were great and everyone raved about them. They were even better the next night especially after they had been sitting in the sauce all night.

This is a great dish because it is very easy to make but is sophisticated enough for a dinner party. We have also made a pork chops version.

We felt that the sauce was horrible. Yuk. Must say that the pork preparation was easy enough. We threw away the sauce and have been using the pork for sandwiches.

My husband is VERY picky, and even he loved this recipe. I only prepared one loin, but kept everything else the same. I also made Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes (found on this sight), and roasted some asparagus in olive oil and garlic. My picky husband stated, "You've outdone youself.."

A very nice way to flavor a tenderloing. I've made this dish twice now. I treat it like a barbecue (the sauce is basically a sweet barbecue sauce) and don't serve any fancy side dishes with it. Just green beans and some white bread. Yummy.

My boyfriend and roommate were blown away by the distinct flavors of this dish. Both have asked me to make it again. I used fresh sage and really noticed the difference in preparation this time. This is a permanent member of my recipe file.

This was delicious! The pork was juicy and perfectly cooked, and the glaze added great flavor without being too heavy. One note: I used bigger tenderloins (the amount of glaze was still fine). If you have big appetites, I would suggest doing the same...you'll want leftovers.

Very easy to make and very good. My family loved this, and I thought the sweet syrup with the vinegar was a great combination of not too sweet, not too tangy. I served it with mashed yams and broccoli - an easy and elegant dinner! I will definitely make it again - and next time for guests!

My guests raved about this and asked for recipe. Served it with sweet potato fritter. I'm making it again this week. Felt the Gewürztraminer was too sweet with this dish. I'll try a Reisling next time.

My store was out of loin, so I used chops. The meat itself, while juicy, didn't have a lot of flavor. The sauce is what made the dish. I'll try it again only if I can find a loin.

Excellent!!! Served it with the mashed winter root vegetables...perfect!

This was a really nice alternative to an otherwise ordinary dish. We used thick cut boneless loin chops instead of the tenderloin only because we had them on hand. The sage and maple flavors were outstanding, (and made the whole house smell wonderful for the next day or so!) It was easy to prepare, yet very impressive in presentation and flavor -- which makes it ideal for company. This is a keeper.

Very Easy and moist. We usually do Pork tenderloin on the grill with garlic/rosemary, this was a nice change of flavors. I found it enjoyable and not too sweet. My 3yr old loved it along with my 30 something husband. I will file this recipe for a dinner party or supper club.

As a big fan of pork tenderloin, I am always looking for new recipes. This stovetop recipe was fantastic. Not only was it easy, but also delicious. I used fresh sage and it was very good. I should add that not a morsel was left and only 4 adults were dining.
