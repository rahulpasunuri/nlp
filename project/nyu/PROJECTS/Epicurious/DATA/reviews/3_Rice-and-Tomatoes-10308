Definitely skip steaming the rice... if you want a mushier rice, just add more water and cook it for less time. This is an ok dish. Could be jazzed up quite a bit. I added ground chicken and fresh oregano.

This is an old Family recipe right down to the steamed rice. My Great Grandfather would make this for me when I was a little girl. We also added spicy link sausage (cut in chunks) to the tomatoes to give it a zingy bite. YUM!
