Overall I thought this salad was delicious, bright and refreshing. However I and my husband both found it rather overpowering, and MUCH preferred it after we put the mixed herbs and tomatoes over mixed spring greens. It helped, I think, to actually accentuate the herb flavors and helped us to appreciate them more than just having a strong mouthful of them. I would make this again, just with mixed greens as well.

I was definitely underwhelmed by this, felt like it was missing something, despite all the fresh herbs. Makes a beautiful presentation, though.

This salad was a fantastic addition to a fresh, summer & Mexican-themed dinner! Served it alongside quesadillas & it was a hit. Wanted some presentation, so served the tomatoes over mixed organic greens. Even people who didn't like cilantro were impressed.

This is a wonderful, light, refreshing recipe. I wasn't convinced how I would like the combination of parsley, mint, and cilantro. I love them all on their own, just didn't know about the mixture. It's like I've discovered an entirely new herb. The taste is just magic. Good tomatoes are a must. Enjoy.

I'm a personal chef and have made this recipe several times, and each time it is a hit! Fresh garden-ripe tomatoes are essential. It's also wonderful with light seafood in a wine sauce or as a side with grilled chicken or fish. A perfect summer salad.

This salad makes an AMAZING accompaniment to any type of Mexican food. It really brings out the flavors of different fresh herbs. I used fresh cilantro instead of coriander and the salad began to dance in my mouth!
