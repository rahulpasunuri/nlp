I can't tolerate a lot of heat. I kept the red pepper the same, substituting soy sauce for the tabasco. I also used rice vinegar. They make a great topping for salad as well as a snack.

I make this with 4C almonds keeping seasonings the same with a little tweak to increase the smoke. I have copious amounts of Thai red pepper (ground) to substitute at half ratio--it's way hotter than cayenne. UK--do you have access to smoked paprika and hickory salt? You may be able to doctor the recipe that way.

I made these loads of times while I was living in San Francisco...I even gave them as a gift to someone one Christmas. Now that I am in the UK I've found this type of peanut, but I can't find liquid smoke anywhere! If anyone has any suggestions for substitutions or where I could find this...do tell!

Very easy to make, but not real flavorful. Tasted a lot like plain old roasted peanuts.

Angostura - the bitters people - make a veggie Worcestershire sauce. And this recipe sounds wonderful!

Worcestershire Sauce is not vegetarian. It contains anchovies.

These were a cinch to make, and I thought they had a great flavor.
