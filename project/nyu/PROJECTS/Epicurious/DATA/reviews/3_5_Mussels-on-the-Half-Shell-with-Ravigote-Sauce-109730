This was really easy and delicious. It was a huge hit at my party. I ran out of space on the serving dish and only served about 3/4 of the mussels. When one of my guests found out there were more in the fridge she went and got them and everyone finished them off. The only change i made was to replace the onion with 2 chopped shallots.

To the cook from Dallas, TX: You shouldn't use French expressions if you don't know how to spell them.
