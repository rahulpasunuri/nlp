If you love coconut you will like these! I don't recommend baking them all at once. Slice off what you want for that night, they are best warm and kind of ho hum when they have cooled.

Made these as part of a cookie platter for work, they tasted alright (not great) and were pretty boring looking. I wouldn't bother with these again.

Yum!! I made these with a drop more almond than recommended, and I added dark chocolate chips to these. Also, because of time constraints, I didn't freeze them - I made balls of them instead. They're delish!!

This was a super cookie recipe! I would definitely garnish with extra coconut. They tasted good served with Mango sherbet. YUMMY!

This was really great! I stuck them in the freezer because I didn't have enough time to chill them in the fridge and they still turned out delicious!

Excellent cookie - moist and chewy. I did not put the coconut in the food processor - I left it medium flake size for texture. To bring to a Christmas cookie exchange party, I made them more festive with the addition of 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spices and garnished, once cooled, with melted white chocolate. That made them over the top! This recipe is now a 'must have' during our family holiday season.

The recipe was good! I use my family as judges, especially my son. I asked if I should make another batch and we agreed no. However, to make this batch better, I think I will drizzle chocolate over them or coat the bottom with chocolate, semisweet or bittersweet!

I tried this recipe and it was a hit! I did change it a bit by adding add 3 oz. of cream cheese to the batter, 1 tsp. of O.J, some almond extract, and equal parts of sugar and condensed milk. Poured some bitter-sweet chocolate over them. All these ingredients seem to work well. Doing it again this weekend. =)
