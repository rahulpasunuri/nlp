I made this for my best friends birthday. The directions were easy enough to follow, really baby your chocolate. The result was a fudgy yummy smooth terrine. I used plain Brandy, I think if I had used the raspberry it would have been too sweet for us. The contrast of the raspberries and white chocolate was really nice anyway. I didn't make the sauce. I tempered chocolate and served it with a small assortment of chocolate covered nuts and some dark chocolate covered raspberries. Have fun, this is a good one :)

I make this dish every Christmas Eve. It's easy, elegant, and wickedly luscious. I make it in an ordinary loaf pan and always use Lindt or Tobler white chocolate. I have served it to many people over the years and, heaven forbid if one year I decided not serve it, people would have my head instead on the serving plate!

The correct loaf pan was hard to find. Tried a regular one, but it was to wide and didn't allow for enough layers. I tried a couple of mini-loaf pans and got better results. Also, didn't have much luck with Ghiradelli white chocolate.
