Making this for the 10th easily, its a great fast, satisfying easy soup to make and very easy on the pocketbook. For sure a keeper.

Interesting and tasty enough at first blush, but I was quickly bored and even put off by its borderline slimy texture and semi-sour tang. I've never been a fan of tortilla soup, and this is really close in flavor, just thicker in substance.

I made this for some clients and they went nuts. On my Menu and all my party tables from now on.

REALLY good soup...and twice as good the next day! Used corn chips...and added more. I like the texture. This deserves 4 forks...not because it totally rocked my world...but because I know I will make this again and again!

I added some sliced cabbage and frozen corn. Very filling and tasty soup. We garnished the bowls with grated cheddar and crumbled corn chips.

I added a jalepeno and at the very end added a bunch of cilantro. This recipe is really good!!! can also be easily converted to weight watcher points!!

Everyone loves this soup! I left out the chips, added extra hominy, and served it with cilantro and avocado.

I make soups at least twice a week in the cooler months because I love them, and this is a great one to break the monotony. I have made this one a million times, and I've taken a lot of the previous reviews into account and tried the suggested changes. I like it best with an extra dried chili or two, a jalapeno, and ranch flavored doritos instead of corn chips. I know it sounds hokey but trust me. I appreciate all of the other reviews because many of them were great (especially the addition of pulled pork- yum)!!

I used fresh tomatoes from the garden and added some shredded pork that I was "crock potting" to make pulled pork for sandwiches the next day.... GREAT! A real winner..

Great soup for winter, kinda like a Mexican, no-meat alternative to chili. I used red kidney beans instead of hominy. It adds some nice color to the soup.

This was SO good, and I believe it was mainly due to the New Mexico chili. As the recipe stands, it was very good and easily 3 forks. Because I wanted something extra spicy to sweat out my cold, I added more sliced jalapeno right before I simmered it, and it was scorching hot but good! It was a tad thick, so I think one more small can of chicken stock would thin it out a bit more.

This soup is the bomb! I should have added a little more cumin, other than it was great. I did put some fresh corn in the pot too. I garnished it with the lime, avocado, and cilantro. It's very heary and can make for a meal.

Yum! My Mexican friend approved too. I added some chopped fresh skinless chicken thighs before the tomatoes and used some jalapenos at the end for some extra zest. You can also top with shredded cabbage, cilantro or radishes to make a real posole. It is great the next day or so. A keeper.

This was great! It had a nice bite from the peppers. I hadn't tried hominy before and found it to have a great texture. I didn't have whole cumin to toast, so just used ground and it was super. Will become a regular in my kitchen.

This is a wonderful soup. I used yellow hominy. You could add shrimp or grilled steak to make it heartier.

Amazing soup! We loved the flavor. I also could not find the golden hominy but white was ok. I also had to substitute the peppers but it turned out great!

This soup is absolutely delicious. So full of flavors. I find that the soup tastes better every day. My wife and I usually eat it over 3-4 days. We add grated extra sharp cheddar to the soup just before eating.

Very good recipe- I also could not find golden hominy but the white seemed just fine. I served it with a bit of Jack cheese and a tiny scoop of sour cream. Yum.

This is easy and extremely flavorful. I couldn't find the two different types of chilis, so I just used jalapenos and added some red pepper flakes, which made it fairly spicy. Also was unable to find golden hominy- only white, which seemed to work fine. I added more lime juice than the recipe called for, and it was really good.
