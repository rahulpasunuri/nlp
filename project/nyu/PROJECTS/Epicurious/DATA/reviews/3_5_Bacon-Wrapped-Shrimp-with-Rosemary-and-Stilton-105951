amazing! My man loved this, and I made it for his parents and they also thought it was great! A true hit if you are looking for an appetizer to impress.

Made this tonight - dellicious! Partially cooked bacon first and the finished dish was nice and crispy. I used a very good balsamic vinegar and blue cheese. Will definitely do these again!

Pretty good and simple recipe, but I would highly recommend pre-sauteeing the bacon until almost crispy, otherwise you will have soft bacon surrounding your shrimp which has the flavor of ham. Odd and unenjoyable in my opinion. We added fontina at the end because we had it on hand and my family doesn't like Stilton, but I think the cheese is unnecessary anyway. Pretty good, simple recipe which would be easy to tweak to your liking.

This was totally yummy! I used very large shrimp we got at the Farmer's Market, and made it as a main course, with 3 or 4 shrimp each. I didn't use Stilton because I always have either Maytag Blue or Point Reyes Blue on hand - I can't remember which one I used, but they're both excellent. To get around the shrimp being done before the bacon was fully cooked I substituted prosciutto, so I could broil just long enough for the shrimp to be perfect. A wonderful quick summer meal!

I brought these to my parents' house for Christmas a few years ago, and my father liked them so much he didn't eat any of the main course because he'd filled up on shrimp. They're now required at family gatherings. Usually people are snapping them up as soon as they come out of the oven; before I have a chance to sprinkle the rosemary on them. They're still delicious!

This was ok, but not great. I precooked the bacon and used the largest shrimp I could find, but the bacon still was rubbery in areas. I just don't feel it was the best use of shrimp. The bacon totally overwhelmed the rest of the flavors. I think I can find a better way to prepare shrimp.

Fast, easy and always requested. I use the largest shrimp I can find. I also use blue cheese in lieu of Stilton.

Easy to make and impressive looking. Everyone raved about these and asked for the recipe.

I used the large shrimp from Costco (12 shrimp per pound), and from Trader Joe's I used bacon, balsamic glaze, and Castello blue cheese. This cheese is very malleable and melted nicely - I tucked it into the curve of the raw shrimp. I pre-cooked the bacon and wrapped it around the shrimp and cheese. Broiled everything for 3 minutes on the first side and about 2 minutes on the second side. Delicious, but...these are huge shrimp and for my taste, a whole big shrimp is too much, given the richness of the ingredients. I liked this better (especially since I'm looking ahead to doing appetizers for 100 people later this year): I cut each cooked shrimp in half and placed it on a piece of cooked bacon cut to size. I didn't wrap the bacon around it - the shrimp just sat on top. Then I tied it with a long, skinny chive so it would stay together. I not only got twice as many appetizers, each bite is more attractive . There was enough of the melted cheese/rosemary/balsamic flavor still on the bacon and shrimp to suit my taste. Yes, I could use smaller shrimp, but that's just more shrimp to peel. And these were beautiful shrimp - already deveined. I don't think these need to be served piping hot - warm is fine. And you could probably just spear the shrimp/bacon with a toothpick to keep it together, but the chive is really pretty. I still have a little more fiddling to do with this recipe but agree that the flavors are great, especially the rosemary.

I am always asked to bring these to parties.Use large or jumbo shrimp and no longer than 3 or 4 in. of thin sliced bacon. Don't use anything but stilton-it's not supposed to melt like -say- chedder. Soooo goooood AND EASY(and impressive)

Rating: 4
okay, I tried broiling the shrimp with the rosemary already skewered(as one reviewer had suggested) and the rosemary looked like it had been through a forest fire. (I soaked them beforehand for 30 min.) So that doesn't work.. However, the pesto sauce is awesome. My suggestion: use toasted baguette bread, spread on the pesto on the toasted bread and then top with the grilled shrimp. Perhaps sprinkle with some fresh parsley or rosemary. Forget skewering them.

I made these hors d'ouvres for a cocktail party with friends. They were really, really good. I didn't vary the recipe at all. I did use a little pipette to drizzle the balsamic vinegar on the shrimp so as not to get too much on each individual shrimp. Worked out just great. Very rich!

These are really good. My guests loved them and snapped them up quickly. I thought the Stilton would be too strong for my kids but they loved it. I'll definitely make these again.

Ick. Thought this was awful. Perhaps a different kind of cheese - or prosciutto. The bacon and the cheese completely overwhelmed the delicate shrimp.

Rating: 2
Yeesh--I made a mess of this one. Used pre-cooked shrimp (bad idea) and partially cooked the bacon in advance and bacon was still undercooked in the end. I found them very difficult to assemble with the partially cooked bacon since it had shrunk. I used balsamic vinaigrette and sprinkled with cheese before wrapping and flavors were quite good. They weren't pretty but they still disappeared quickly so I'll probably try again.

Such a simple dish to make and the results are excellent! I was initially apprehensive about the cheese (I used Danish Blue Cheese), but I am now convinced that it's the cheese that brings out the sophistication of the simple ingredients. Great for parties and as a starter.

Simple and elegant. Will make this again and again. I microwaved the bacon partially before broiling. They were gone in seconds.

I make a variation which is also great. Strip rosemary from the bottom 2 1/2 inches of twig. Soak twigs for at LEAST 20 mins. Coarsely chop 1-2T of rosemary leaves and prepare per above recipe. Sprinkle cheese over shrimp. Wrap two shrimp in Prosciutto, sprinkle with Balsamic and fresh lemon juice. Can be refrigerated up to 8 hours at this point. Then grill or broil 4-5 inches from heat for 3 mins per side. Sometimes stick 3 skewers in half lemon for presentation. I don't have to precook prosciutto and the rosemary twigs are lovely and add flavor.

Made this with scallops instead of shrimp and it was wonderful. Definitely cook the bacon until almost crisp before wrapping around the seafood. The combination of flavors was perfect.

Very popular--the dish is gone almost within minutes! I would definitely recommend precooking the bacon a bit 1st so you don't have to overcook the shrimp under the broiler to crisp the bacon. As it was, we turned them for even cooking. Delicious, simple prep!

I don't give many "4's" but this one qualifies. It's easy and delicious with nice textures and a great combination of flavors. I'd suggest using big shrimp so that the bacon crisps without over cooking the shrimp, and you might need to adjust the broiler to shrimp distance for the same reason. The rosemary/stilton/balsamic thing works. Yum.

This will takes days off of your life, but it's worth it! I tripled the amounts and put everything togeather ahead of time. These flew off the buffet table. Very good.

Made these as an appetizer for a dinner party, they were delicious. I did substitute Parma Proscuitto for the bacon, and did a quick broil to melt the Stilton. Wonderful!

You think people just love bacon-wrapped scallops? Well, let me tell you, it's got nothing on bacon-wrapped shrimp! This is a delightful and very easy recipe- takes no time and completely impresses... I usually lay the appetizers out on a big platter garnished with big rosemary sprigs and hunks of blue cheese.

I made these for a cocktail party and they were fabulous; they went in minutes. Easy to make...I also used frozen shrimp and pre-cooked the bacon for a few minutes...I had two people ask for the recipe; this is a keeper for the simplicity factor and the taste.

This is the one to make when you want them eating out of your hand. Made this last night for the 3rd time for a crowd of 50 (150 shrimp). I used the frozen Costco Shelled and Deveined Jumbo Shrimp as someone previously recommended (this is a fabulous product). To save time I precooked the bacon the day before, almost but not quite to where it would start to brown, and refrigerated it. After two previous unsatisfying attempts at getting the Stilton to melt on the broiled shrimp, I decided this time to put the cheese (about 1/3 tsp.) on top of each shrimp BEFORE rolling it up in bacon. Viola! Perfectly melted and much neater to eat, too. I saw a man practically in tears when the last one was gone!

The flavors of rosemary, bacon and shrimp...WOW!! I found it difficult to serve with the stilton, because the cheese didn't melt that well on the shrimp. But it is good without the cheese. I also used pre-cooked frozen shrimp (16 count), but just cooked the bacon a little longer before wrapping.

A friend made this as an appetizer for a dinner party. I thought it sounded familiar and sure enough, it was in my recipe box! Oh MY!!! This was delicious. We gobbled these up as fast as we could. Definitely the hit of the evening! Will definitely be making these myself soon.

One of the best appetizers I've ever made and SO EASY!. Precooking the bacon is a must; and I think the Stilton is a requirement as well. I can't imagine it would be as good with just any old blue cheese as a lot of them don't have a comparably good flavor.

Very simple and incredible flavor. I made this as a Thanksgiving appetizer and everyone loved it. It is one of the best shrimp appetizers I have ever had. Make sure to use thick cut bacon from a butcher or meat market. Definately pre-cook the bacon for a couple minutes. I used grated parmesan cheese and it was excellent.

I prepared these with asiago cheese because that is what I had on hand. Lovely, quick and easy! Partially precooking the bacon is a must.

This recipe was lovely! I took many of the thoughtful suggestions offered ... partially cooked the bacon, was generous with the rosemary and the balsamic vinegar (Note: Williams-Sonoma sells a lovely balsamic flavored with figs that is truly sensational). I also sauteed the shrimp in olive oil, and they cooked very evenly. I did add one thing to an already stellar dish. After I cooked the shrimp, I poured the leftover marinade in a saucepan and reduced it on high flame for a few minutes. After adding the Stilton cheese and microwaving the shrimp briefly to melt the cheese, I added the reduced vinegar glaze over the shrimp. Truly a lovely recipe I will make again!

Very easy, very delicious! Like previous reviewers, I pre-cooked the bacon until almost translucent, but before shrinking. I found wooden skewers (remember to soak first) easier to use than toothpicks. Since I didn't have either Stilton or Blue Cheese on hand, served with Blue Cheese Dressing as a dip.

Made this recipe when my Mother and Aunt visited, they were amazed! I partly cooked the bacon before using it on the shrimp, and then put the shrimp back in the oven after putting the cheese on top. The cheese got even more melty and it was great!

Loved that I could make this ahead of time for a party. It was delicious and people were commenting on how great they were and asking for the recipe. It was embarrassing how easy it was. It was also esthetically pleasing.

The stilton and fresh rosemary are a refreshing delight. However, my decadent way of cooking the bacon-wrap is fried in extra-virgin olive oil so the bacon is very crisp and evenly cooked. This is the process I have used for years with scallops and shrimp. I have had no complaints. yet.

I have made this recipe twice. The 2nd time with more success. Precooking the bacon is key and be generous with the vinegar. I grilled them like shiskabob and they turned out fabulously! I guess practice makes perfect!

After reading all the reviews, we thought this recipe was one of those where we couldn't loose. However, it fell very hort of the mark. A friend made this for a group of us. Since this was his first attempt, he followed the recipe to a tee except cutting short the cooking time. The collective review of the recipe was that the bacon was undercooked and the was shrimp overcooked. Based on the feedback we received - not sure what we could have done to make it better.

Next time I would cook the bacon slightly before starting this recipe. It was a little too soft and undercooked for us. Otherwise it was very good!

Grilled on BBQ instead of broiler. As always don't overcook the shrimp. Precooked bacon makes the dish much easier and doesn't wind up burning on the grill as long as you watch out for flame ups.

Everyone loved this dish. Because one of my guests is allergic to seafood, I also used this same receipe for water chestnuts. I took the advice of someone earlier and prepared them a couuple hours ahead and then simply reheated in the mirco.

I made this appetizer for both Christmas and New Years Eve dinners. It got raves from everyone. Don't be afraid to do this ahead of time. I made them (without the blue cheese) the day of the dinner, covered and refrigerated them, then reheated them in the microwave for a couple minutes before sprinkling on the blue cheese and serving them.
