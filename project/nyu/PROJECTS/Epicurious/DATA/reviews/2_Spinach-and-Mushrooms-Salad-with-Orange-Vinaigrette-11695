I found this recipe a little dull... so I made some modifications: I cut the amount of oil... don't know the quantity but just use your common sense. When it starts to look emulsified, stop adding oil. I didn't have orange so I used tangerines... amazing! Not to acid!! I also added yellow raisins and sunflower seeds to the mixture. The raisins gave a sweet touch to all the salty/acid mixture and the sunflower seeds were something crispy to bite. Sounds like a different recipe, but still I liked it.

In a word, awful. Better to eat the spinach and mushroom on their own than to cover them with this bizarre liquid. On paper, the ingredients look appetizing, reality is quite different.

You want the truth? Well, you can't handle the truth! The truth is that this is not a recipe for someone with stomach problems. There's enough oil to fry a whole chicken.

I disagree with the above reviews completely!!! I made this salad for a group of friends (all big foodies!) and they loved it.....it was simple, yet very tasty ...i am making it again for a family get together

This is a terrible recipe. There is far too much oil compared to the other ingredients. Once you put it all together you can only taste the oil and the salt. I believe there is something wrong with the amounts called for in this recipe.

This recipe was pretty good. The orange zest gave it lots of flavor. However, comments are right - it can be bland. To give it flavor it up, I added a tsp. of honey (or honey-mustard). It came out great.

A vinaigrette can be made with any acidic liquid. This includes vinegar, lemon juice, lime juice, and orange juice. So yes, this is a viniagrette.

This recipe was NOT a vinagrette, since there was no vinager. It was too oily, I added cider vinegar and diced fresh oranges to make it better AND cut the salt to 1/2 tsp.

The vinaigrette is way too salty and also quite bland.

The dressing has potential, but it's way too salty. I would cut down the salt to 1/4 - 1/2 tsp. Also, some fresh orange segments would be nice in this.
