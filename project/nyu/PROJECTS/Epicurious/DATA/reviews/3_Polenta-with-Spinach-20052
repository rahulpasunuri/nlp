I used the pre-made polenta because I was running late, and layered with marinara sauce. I also mixed in a little grated cheese to the spinach. It turned into a fantastic "lasagna". The whole prep was 10 minutes if you use frozen spinach.

I hate to say it since James Beard is such a culinary giant, but this dish didn't cut it for me. The parmesan didn't melt nicely, the polenta seemed too crunchy, and the spinach mixture was bland. I think the basic idea is interesting, but it needs a lot of work--maybe making a creamy parmesan polenta with spinach stirred in would be a better idea.

Made into a light meal by adding a layer of pancetta between the spinach and polenta.

I prefer polenta with very flavorful sauces, so I doubled the garlic and increased the lemon juice. The lemon juice is really essential here; it gives the spinach a nice tangy flavor that contrasts with the blandness of the polenta, and it makes the dish smell nice, too. Maybe next time I'd decrease the oil and add some crushed red pepper.

This has lots of flavor. I used flavored polenta (sundried tomato) from a box, and added extra garlic (3 cloves) to the spinach. I also cooked fresh baby spinach instead of frozen. I will definitely make it again!

Delicious - my family loved it - even my 10 year old. I added only 2 tblsp. of olive oil instead of 4. I also added about 1/2 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese to the spinach. Turned out very yummy. I used premade polenta - just sliced it and laid it on top of the spinach - made for a very quick and easy to prepare dish. out very good.

This is a great dish, but to the spinach mixture I added a carton of ricotta cheese, some grated mozzarella (1/2 cup) and parmesan cheese (1/2 cup) and some fresh ground black pepper. It was wonderful! Got lots of raves and easy, too.
