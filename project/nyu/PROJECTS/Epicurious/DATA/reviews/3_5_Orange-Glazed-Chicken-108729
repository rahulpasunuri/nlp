Surprisingly good. Maybe not the most flavorful orange flavor but incredibly moist chicken and delicious sauce for your rice (I made extra). I heated the sauce first and it was a bit thin. Next time I will try not heating it before coating the chicken. I also added extra mustard but was perhaps a little heavy handed. Definitely taste before you increase hotness.

I scalloped the chicken breasts, dredged them in a combination of flour, onion powder, paprika, sea salt and pepper, and cooked them in olive oil until done. Set aside. For the sauce, I omitted soy sauce, and added the remaining ingredients to 2 tbsp butter in a saucepan. Then returned the chicken back to the saucepan, stirring to make sure all of the chicken was covered with the sauce. It was a hit.

Used spicy brown mustard and added red pepper flakes for some heat. Delicious!

Very good. Quick, easy. I did add a couple of drops of toasted sesame oil just because I like it in anything with soy sauce. Next time I will add a bit more lemon juice It most definitly is a winner.

I made this for my kids because they love the orange chicken from the chinese take-out place. I substituted the hot mustard with Asian Garlic Chile sauce. The kids LOVED it. Made it really spicy but it was really good. Thumbs up!!!

This was great! Since some other folks thought it bland, I stuck my finger in the sauce a couple times and added more Chinese mustard. Also, I used it to glaze boneless chicken thighs that I then broiled for 10 minutes (ala Peking Style Chicken Wraps, another winner with Asian Slaw) and served with fried rice. Yum!

Horrible! Tasted like you were eating chicken dunked in orange marmalade jam--not an exquisite asian recipe. And very sticky. Don't waste your energy on this one. I never write reviews,but this one was so awful I had to.

I thought that this was awesome. I made twice as much sauce and had it with saffron rice. My guests said it was a bit strong, but thats what I thought made it so good, a lot of flavor.

Yesterday two friends showed up for dinner uninvited and starving, so I did a quick search on here for "chicken" and "quick" and decided to try this recipe. Everyone LOVED it. I couldn't believe when I cut my knife into the chicken how juicy it was. The sauce is out of this world! Make extra sauce (we ran out, after everyone decided to drench their rice in it). Even my friend who is picky and normally won't eat the skin on the chicken ate it last night!

This was delicious, moist, easy, and quick. Don't forget the initial salt and pepper; and use only fresh chicken (frozen and thawed will turn out dry.) My husband expecially liked this, although he's also a big fan of spicy food.

Yummy! This is simple and tastes wonderful. I followed the recipe exactly. I also tried a three fruit marmalade (lemon, lime and orange) as well as a tangerine-orange marmalade and both came out very well. This was great cold the next day. Also, if you make more sauce, it tastes great over hot rice.

This recipe was absolutely delicious! I doubled up the marmalade mixture though, one batch just wasn't enough. I'll definately make it again, my husband just loved it.
