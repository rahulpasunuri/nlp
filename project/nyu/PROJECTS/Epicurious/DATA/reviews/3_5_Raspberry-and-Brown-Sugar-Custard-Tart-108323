I made this exactly as written and it was delicious, different than anything I'd tasted before and hard to stop at one serving!

PLEASE don't ever make this tart! I know it looks tempting and I made it but I had doubts about the melted butter stick added to the filling. RESULT: It never set until it was nearly burnt. I couldn't finish one bite, it was so OILY and greasy and YUCKY, ended up throwing it all away after all the effort!

This was delicious. I used puff pastry instead of the crust. It's an easy and attractive dessert. I did need to bake a bit longer than suggested time.
