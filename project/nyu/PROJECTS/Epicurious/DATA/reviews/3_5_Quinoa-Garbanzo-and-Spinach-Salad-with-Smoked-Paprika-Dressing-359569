Outstanding. Follow this recipe to the letter, and use the BEST oil, paprika, vinegar, etc. that you can get your hands on. Every time I make this, my guests are licking their bowls and asking for seconds.

Made this for the first time last night. Had to sub kale for spinach, adding to the warm quinoa to wilt. The resulting salad was delish. This is a keeper and with plenty of mint and kale, I will be making this again!

I love this salad. It was a hit at a potluck. I was never a fan of quinoa until I made this salad. Like some of the reviewers I also used less oil. It was very good the next day too!

We love this salad, especially for pot-luck style dinner/lunch, and have made it many times. I use half the oil and add garlic and just a pinch or two of cayenne pepper to the dressing. We also add halved artichokes (not the marinated kind), which go well with the spinach. As one other reviewer recommends, I also put spinach in when the quinoa is hot, so it wilts. Can be served slightly warm, rather than chilled.

I used 2 tins of mixed beans instead of the garbanzos because we're not so fond of that many garbanzos. I also doubled the dressing and let it sit with the less tender ingredients overnight to let everything soak up the flavours. I don't know how the number of servings was determined though. This amount of salad would feed at least 12 hungry people in my family!

made this with regular paprika - just fine (though I'm sure the smoked would be better) instead of 1 cup of mint, I chopped up about 2 TBSP of fresh mint finely and mixed it into the dressing Added bean sprouts for more crunch will become a regular part of my rotation!

Loved this! A thanks to the reviewer who emphasized the difference between using smoked paprika vs regular, this persuaded me to buy the smoked kind and wow, so glad I did. I subbed fresh parsley (sliced thin) for the mint, and used red wine vinegar. Was really healthy, filling and delicious.

Would probably not make this again. I did not like the smoked paprika taste. It would be fine with a different dressing, though. Also, due to all the chopped spinach, this salad did not hold up well in the fridge, by the 2nd or 3rd day, it was a bit soggy.

Rating: 3
This was pretty good the first night. I made it without the cucumber (I'm allergic) but otherwise made half the recipe as directed. I'm not sure the mint added anything, and it made the leftovers taste slightly medicinal. Next time I will probably leave out the mint and might add chopped red bell peppers as another reviewer suggested.

This is an AMAZING salad. I love making it and watching the guests just devour it every time. Even my 3yr old eats it! I've made it at least 4 times and there are a couple of things I do that make it even more outstanding without changing any of the ingredients: -I roughly chop the spinach -I add the ingredients to the quinoa without letting the quinoa cool down. This lets the spinach wilt just perfectly into the salad (but not too much) -I double the amount of dressing Since the salad is warm by the time I'm finished, I cool it in the fridge until it's ready to be served. Perfect!

Excellent salad! I cut the oil in half based on previous reviews, and may increase the sherry vinegar a little next time, but it was a delicious and hearty salad. The smoked paprika added a nice flavor. I will definitely make this again.

Love this salad and make it often for pot luck lunch at my yoga studio. Everyone loves it and asks for recipe. You have to like quinoa...

We really loved this (having it again tonight). I cut back on the oil (used equal parts oil and sherry vinegar instead) and sliced the mint into very thin ribbons. Delicious!

Delicious and filling! Only change I made was to fry a little minced garlic in oil, toast the quinoa in the oil for about 5 minutes, then cooked it in chicken stock.

Update to my previous review - The salad loses its appeal on day 2. The recipe will feed 8 as a main course, so perhaps cutting it in half would work better. Received feedback that it's missing something - would be tasty with chicken or sliced raw peppers (red, yellow, orange would be appealing.) It was fun to try, but this isn't my favorite.

Rating: 3
I followed the recipe except for the vinegar - I used a Pinot Grigio which worked well and I chopped the mint leaves. The salad is chilling, and I will go pick up a little more feta since I only had a couple oz on hand. This will be nice to have on hand - I hope it stays nice for a couple days.

Rating: 4
Easy and delicious! I followed the advice to cut back on the paprika and the olive oil. I also used grape tomatoes and did not include cucumber so it also kept really well, which was useful because it made a large amount of salad. Made it as a side dish for guests and got rave reviews!

Rating: 3
Great salad. Feta seemed to bring it all together (I didn't have quite enough so felt the salad was lacking in that respect). Also, added 3 small cloves fresh garlic to the dressing which improved it. Did not find the smk. paprika to be overpowering. Found it to be slightly on the oily side so would revise the oil/vinegar ratio next time. Maybe 1/4c oil to 1/4c. vinegar. Oh yes, I also used red wine vinegar instead of the unavailable sherry wine vinegar. Seemed fine. All in all a great salad...not excellent.

I made this recipe yesterday and entered it in a contest at local community event. I won first prize for best vegetarian dish. Everyone loved it! It was delicious and unique.

Rating: 3
I made this as a gluten-free, vegetarian option for a luncheon buffet to rave receiption! A few adaptations: I cut the smoked paprika back to 1 1/2 tsp after reading other reviews, I used 1/2 cup CHOPPED mint leaves, and I used asiago cheese (because I forgot to buy the Feta!). The asiago turned out to pair quite nicely with the smoked paprika, and I will continue to use it when I make the recipe again! It does make a lot, but it was just as good the next evening when paired with some grilled fish for dinner. Going into the summer menu rotation!

Carynbo asked about substitute for smoked paprika - I bet not. The smoked paprika is VERY unique and not at all like regular paprika. It's truly the ingredient in this recipe that makes it special. I hope you were able to find it.

Rating: 3
Easy and great tasting. I love smoked paprika and never thought of using it in a dressing. Changes: I do not enjoy biting into a whole leaf of mint so I used 1/2 the amount and gave it a good chop instead of whole leaves. Used champagne vinegar and slightly less oil. The feta in the salad was plenty so I didn't add more on top. Lovely colors, textures, and light yet hearty. Great next day leftovers too.

Question: I want to try this recipe this weekend, but cannot find Smoked Paprika anywhere. Can anyone suggest a suitable substitution -- would regular paprika do? Thanks for any ideas!

This is a really nice fresh-tasting combination of quinoa and veggies, but it is just missing a little bit of pizzazz. I followed the recipe pretty closely though I didn't add the garbanzo beans (but don't imagine that they would do it). I haven't read other reviews yet but would recommend doing something to give it more bite.

My quinoa never cooked! Or, half of it did but it didn't even all sprout so I could never even make the salad. What happened?

Rating: 0
Great! I served the greens separately with some of the dressing (so leftovers didn't have soggy greens in them). The smoked paprika & min are a great combo and I served with fresh lemon wedges Next time I would bump up the amount of vinegar a bit because that is how I like dressing. Felt like Mediterranean supper in January - served as main dish with rustic crackers boiled eggs and pepper cheese.

This is a fresh, healthy, nourishing, and delicious meal that is hearty enough to satisfy a non-vegetarian. I replaced the mint with parsley and cut the smoked paprika in half to prevent it from being overpowering. I also threw in a few handfuls of kalamata olives and used red quinoa for added color.

This is SO easy to make and really delicious. I only had one can of chick peas so I used a can of cannelloni beans as well and I was very pleased with it. I also subbed balsamic for the Sherry Wine vinegar since I'm poor. But the mint and paprika really makes this dish pop!

This recipe was just average. I found the 1 cup of fresh mint and the smoked paprika overpowering in the dish. I ended up trying to pick out most of the mint. I would probably not make it again.

I hate smoked paprika so also made a basic red wine vinaigrette with oregano and let people choose their dressing.

This is one of the best salad recipes I've tried. I made it when we had friends over for dinner, and it was a great success. The combination of mint and smoked paprika is wonderful- -substituting with regular paprika would be a total shame. The dressing is a beautiful color. I added acidulated red onion (just because I love it). Delicious!

I found this surprisingly delicious and my dining companion also liked it. I used a little less olive oil than was called for and added a splash of honey and lime juice to the dressing based on earlier suggestions.

I really enjoyed this. We made half the recipe and it was a filling, yet light meal for two people. I did not have spinach in the house and used arugula instead which I thought was a nice contrast to the smoky paprika and salty feta. Very good.

This salad is fantastic if you expect the spinach to wilt. (which I loved) I let it sit for a bit before serving and the Quinoa really soaked up the flavor. I used half of the garbanzos and a little less oil. Perfection!

Just had this for lunch. My wife is picky and usually the cook, but she loved it. Made a half-batch, which was perfect for two people. A generous application of salt (w/ a little pepper) made the dressing nice and zingy. I would definitely make this again. Smoked paprika is one of my new favorite spices.

This was a nice, refreshing salad on a hot summer day. I did modify the dressing -- the amount of smoked paprika seemed excessive to me, so added only 1 tsp. In the future, I think I would just make another dressing altogether -- I didn't find the dressing to add anything special. Also, I did not add the dressing to the tossed salad -- allowed individuals to spoon dressing over their individual servings to keep the salad from being overdressed. Did add a garnish of fresh microgreens which added a nice, spicy crunch.

Rating: 3
I had no mint or feta in the house, so I wasn't sure if this would be good -- but it was wonderful. (I gave only three forks because the dressing did need tweaking.) I agree that the dressing needed more "brightness," so I cut down the oil a bit, and added a dash of lime juice and a tablespoon of brown sugar, and I used less paprika. I also cooked the quinoa in chicken broth for more depth. With the added sweet and lime, it's a great dressing. My family gobbled the salad up with crusty bread and good cheese on our picnic.

Rating: 3
I agree with majority of the reviews that this is a great tasting salad, dressing included. It's tasty and hearty with lots of ingredients. The mint, feta cheese and smoked paprika dressing is what makes the salad especially good. A tip for the dressing is to whisk the paprika and sherry together and then to slowly add the olive oil. Keep whisking until all the ingredients are well blended and emulsified. I added just a drop of honey to help thicken it.

Rating: 3
I give the salad portion 4 forks...the dressing 1 fork. Skip the dressing, but make the salad. The salad is now one of my new favorites! Great with red or white quinoa and fresh veggies from the garden! Do add some purple onion...really adds a kick and a nice flavor to the overall dish.

I really enjoyed this recipe - it was super fast and simple to make and I was able to pull it together after working all day - a big plus. I will say that I felt it needed a bit of a "brighter" flavor, and something with a little bite and/or crunch, so will likely add the red onion that others have written about. Otherwise, we really liked this.

This is somewhere between a "meh" and a "so- so." I thought I was going to love it but all I tasted was smoked paprika. There were nice textures, I suppose, but the OVERWHELMING flavor was smoked paprika (and I actually like smoked paprika -- just not as an entire entree). It makes a TON, which would be lovely if I actually WANTED to have leftovers. Unfortunately, I can't sell these leftovers to anyone in the household. Try it if you must (really? You don't wanna just TRY and find a better quinoa recipe???), but halve the recipe so you only have to throw out a bit of leftovers. Me? I've got a whooooole tupperware full to get rid of...

We are big quinoa fans and this is a new favorite. I made it as directed except I chopped the mint finely after measuring, so as to distribute the flavor throughout the dish. Use a good quality Sherry vinegar and smoked paprika and you won't be sorry.

I made it for lunch the next day, keeping the dressing apart from the salad until before eating. I was a little skeptical, but it turned out really tasty! I did add some red onion, and a little basil - as I needed to use it up. Use good smoked paprika for the dressing.

This was very disappointing. It *sounds* delicious on paper, and after reading the rave reviews here I had very high hopes. But something just doesn't work. The smoked paprika flavor completely overwhelms everything, and it almost seems over-dressed (even though it isn't overly oily or liquidly). When you get a bite with all the ingredients, its reasonably tasty. Otherwise, it's basically just eating a big bowl of smoked paprika. The texture also leaves something to be desired (and I normally love quinoa!). It might be worth trying again with some tweaks, but the huge bowl of leftovers no one wants makes me hesitant to try again.

A very tasty salad which is perfect for potlucks and vegetarians. I omitted one of the cans of garbanzo beans and substituted red quinoa for the usual. Also, I added a minced shallot. Don't stint on a high quality feta or the smoked paprika. Keeps well, too.
