LOVED the ideas within. I changed up the cooking method though. I coated them in oil, and then broiled them for round 5 min / side, with door open slightly!

These were a huge hit at our Jamaican Me Crazy party. Served it with the warm cilantro dip.

If you have a soggy plantain is because you haven't fried it long enough, try frying it a bit longer but keep an eye on it is just a matter of seconds for it to become brown and if plantains are green they should be yellow after frying it. To make sure you have a green enough plantain smell it first, if it has any sweet smell to it, its starting to ripe and your frying results are going to be different, but remember you can always crisp them by just letting it fry a little longer.

These were delicious though I found slicing them with a vegetable peeler made them too thin for dipping. I just used my chef's knife to cut them on the bias. The were wonderfully crisp. I didn't have any trouble with sogginess.

I think a simple vegetable/potato peeler works a lot better for these than my fancy slicer. It's actually really easy. Try pulling the peeler toward you and follow the curve of the plantain. You'll have some waste slicing them lengthwise but I think it's worth it because the presentation is so much better than coins!

yum! i skipped the spices, they tasted wierd to me. note: the thinner you slice the plantains, the crisper they'll be. i had no trouble getting them very thin (into coins) with my chef's knife.

These are great but a little soft. They are crispier if you cut them into thin chips instead. The chips also work very well with the dip. I used less oil to fry and simply salted them as soon as they came out.

I made it for a friend and he LOVED it. I used a potato peeler, so the chips were much skinnier. The lime zest was a nice touch.I served it with a seafood dip.

This recipe is din-O-mite!!! But, getting the skins off was much more difficult than they made it sound...we wound up carving them off with a knife (maybe it's b/c they were quite green plantains?). We did not have a mandolin and cutting them to a 1/16 of an inch by hand is a joke- but it didn't seem to matter in the end, they were still great.

Very much like my grandfather (who was from Central America) used to make for me. The other cook was correct, though. These are best served hot and fresh minutes after you make them. Do not believe the recipe. We usually do not have to worry about having leftovers. :)

Very good If made right before serving. Do not keep in a tupperware container
