I loved this dish. I used a Cabernet Sauvignon and drank that with the burgers. I did not use potatoes, but enjoyed some creamed spinach with the dish. The color of my sauce was perfect, but I think it's because I like my burgers close to well done and the extra cooking time browned the pan. Deglazing the pan properly is important. Scrape all those bits! Make sure the wine reduces enough. This sauce should be thicker, not runny. Great recipe for onion lovers! I used a lot. Next time, I might cook the onions longer first. Make sure you get top-quality beef and wine, since those are the main source of flavor.

Started making the recipe before reading the reviews -- was concerned about the wacky color of the sauce during cooking, but I didn't have a problem. Thought this was a great and easy weeknight recipe for 2. I used a cast iron skillet and a pinot noir. I think the iron skillet and the bits scraped off the bottom kept the sauce flavorful and brown. Served the burgers with a frozen roasted potato mix and spinach. Will definitely make again.

For a better version of this, try Julia Child's Bifteck Hache in "Mastering the Art of French Cooking", vol.1. As she says, "Be fussy in choosing your meat." The quality of meat, and of wine, makes all the difference.

This is excelent! I would recomend a pinot noir, both for the sauce, and to drink with it. I will try adding a finely sliced scallion with the cream next time, a little fresh texture and taste.

I thought this dish was tasty and a nice change from the ketchup and pickle variety hamburger. My family likes our burgers medium rare, so we didn't mind the short cooking time. This isn't a dish I would serve to company but good for a weeknight.

Maybe I did something wrong, but the sauce was flavorless and there was nothing good about it.

Nothing special. The brugers are better with ketchup than the red wine sauce.

The dish was okay, but the color of the sauce was very bad.

We found this a delicious and simple entree. A cautionary note: the color of the sauce,as prepared here, was a bit surprising and somewhat unappetizing in appearance (a mauve/puce color), but the flavor was quite good. I wonder if others are having the same result or if it was maybe the wine I used. Perhaps something could be added to give a browner/beefier color?

This was delicious ... I served it with a rice pilaf and peas. I think you need to enjoy the flavor of wine and of thyme in order to find this a tasty dish.

Caution: remember, this is ground sirlion, not sirloin steak. 3 minutes per side isn't good enough becuase ground meat has to be cooked medium-well (155-160F). You may not always get sick when eating undercooked ground meat, but why risk it?

I thought this recipe to be very tasty. Was easy to prepare and also quick to do. Will certainly do it again.
