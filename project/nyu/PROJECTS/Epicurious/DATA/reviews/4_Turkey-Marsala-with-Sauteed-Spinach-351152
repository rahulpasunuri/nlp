Skipped the proscuitto, subbed Havarti (need lower sodium options). Super quick and elegant. While we partnered this with a salad, we actually felt a cheesy polenta would be a better side, as our version came out quite light (but delicious). This is a go-to for us for sure - kids love it too (we just skip the sauce for their cutlets).

Wonderful! Made as directed and it was delicious. Used leeks instead of onion, and Madiera instead of Marsala wine. Chicken breast cutlets instead of turkey. Didn't have enough spinach, so used half brocolli and half spinach. Served on a bed of rice.

Great recipe if you need something fast yet makes a great presentation. I left off the prosciutto and did not have fontane so used mozzarella instead. The Marsala sauce was the perfect finishing touch. Certainly will make this again.

Delicious...served over rice instead of the polenta side dish. My family prefers the spinach finished with a bit of cream which marries well with the marsala sauce. Have on occassion added sauted mushrooms to the spinach/onion mixture with success. This is a simple recipe with great flavour. Watch the salt - fontina and proscuitto are quite salty to begin with...

Excellent. I used flattened chicken breasts, but otherwise followed the recipe. It was fast and easy and absolutely delicious. I wish I had made more. The weekly dinner planner had this paired with a cheesy polenta. I think that would have added too much richness to this dish. It really does not need a starch or more cheese, imo. I nice crispy salad is all it seems to need.

This came together quickly and was so tasty. This recipe inspired my boyfriend to try to learn how to cook after seeing how quickly it came together with such fantastic results.

Really fantastic. I added a splash of cream and nutmeg to the spinach, just for a slightly creamier result. I highly recommend this recipe.

My fave kind of recipe. Easy, simple, fast AND a crowd pleaser! My hubby said the sauce was "out of this world!" Didn't have any spinach, so I made a different veggie on the side. I also subbed provolone for the fontina. The prosciutto is really salty, so if sodium is an issue, know that this is still really tasty even without the prosciutto & cheese.

Easy and tasty. A snap to prepare, and it comes out looking like restaurant fare. This is one we will repeat. I may try it with a more flavorful meat, like chicken.

We really liked this! I couldn't find turkey cutlets so I used chicken breasts, flattened them, and cooked them for about 12 minutes total. Added mushrooms & a little cayenne (personal preference) to the spinach. Served everything layed on a bottom layer of rice. I'll certainly make this again! (FYI - I got Marsala for $7 (Paul Masson) at my grocery store).

I found the recipe very bland. Best part was the spinach and onions.

Made this with skinless, boneless chicken breasts and it was fabulous. An elegant week-night supper.

Quick and good. I sauteed sliced mushrooms after the onions and before the spinach. I also used 3/4 cup Marsala. If you're salt sensitive like we are, beware of putting too much salt on the turkey cutlets before you sear them.

Very easy and tasty I will cut down the prosciuto - had too thick of slices
