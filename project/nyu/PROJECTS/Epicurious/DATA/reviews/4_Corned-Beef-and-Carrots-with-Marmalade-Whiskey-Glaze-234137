I've made this several times. It is the BEST corned beef recipe. Followed previous reviewers suggestions, i.e. baked 3 1/2 # corned beef at 250 degrees for four hours on rack w/a bit of water covered with foil. Removed all fat from beef and refrigerated beef and pan juices separately. Next day, glazed beef and baked following recipe. Substitutions: Jack Daniels and sugar-free orange marmalade. (Actually baked 2 pieces corned beef and froze one unglazed.) What to do with the pan juices? Refrigerate, skim off fat and use for base for lentil, bean, or pea soup .... delicious!

This glaze was amazing on the carrots in this recipe. The corned beef was delicious also. Definately making this again. I doubled the glaze as I like to keep basting with it. It would also be delicious on salmon or chicken over the barbeque. Yum!!

Delicious. Used store bought corned beef and boiled it for 3 hours with the enclosed seasoning packet and added a bottle of Guiness to the water. I made everything early for a party, so when the corned beef was done I glazed it and the carrots and let them sit in the fridge until I was ready to bake and then followed the instructions from there. Made it easy to have everything ready to go in advance. The sauce really is very tasty and it also was super on the carrots. Made with Colcannon potatoes (from another site). Was a great dinner.

This is the best corned beef that I have ever had. I started with a Vienna brand corned beef. I placed it into a pan with its' seasonings. I added 1-1/2 TBS of pickling spice, 2 bay leaves and 6 cloves of garlic. I simmered this for about 3 hours until tender. Then I put it in a pan and proceeded with the recipe. I subbed apricot jam for the marmalade because that is what I had on hand. I cooked cabbage and potatoes in the water from the corned beef. It was a delicious meal and I will definitely repeat.

Truly exceptional. Have to cook it more often than just St Pat's. Used apricot preserves and Irish Mist liqueur. A 1" slab of deli meat (~1 lb), full recipe sauce & carrots, line sheet with foil, cook carrots 15-20 mins then add corned beef 10 mins.Serve with Champ mashed potatoes & Irish Soda Bread with Raisins (both this site). A fabulous ez meal.

I substituted Jack Daniels and apricot marmalade. Bake your own corned beef, flat cut, glaze, 2-1/2 hours at 350, in about 1/2 inch of Guinness, seal tight with foil. Pour off all but 1/2 inch of cooking liquid and add 1 lb. of peeled large (not "baby") carrots. Cut off fat from brisket and re-glaze. Bake for 45 mins more. Steam a head of cabbage until barely done. Reduce reserved liquid by half and serve on the side. The best!

I've been glazing my corned beef and carrots with this recipe since 2006. I cook the corned beef and cabbage as normal and then remove the corned beef, add some baby carrots, cover with the glaze and put it in the oven until browned and delicious! My hubby does not want corned beef anymore unless it's finished with this FABULOUS glaze :)

This recipe was just delicious! We purchased a smaller (2 lb) corned beef from Whole Foods. They had already seasoned the corned beef. I took other reviewers' advice and placed in the oven at 250 degrees with half water/beer mixture for two hours. Reduced the sauce (only had peach preserves and cognac), and then used baby carrots and cooked as directed. It was so tender! Served with Weight Watchers' Colcannon recipe. MMMmmm, good!

This has become our standard St Patrick's Day meal since I first cooked it. The glaze is so simple, and it makes the carrots and what can be a boring cut of meat just outstanding. I usually cook a corned beef myself instead of buying one precooked since it is far cheaper and so easy to do. If there is time I cook it the day before and just put the glaze on it for dinner.

wonderful wonderful! we cooked the corned beef first, as it wasn't precooked, and then used cognac in the glaze, and it was absolutely delicious!!! glaze would probably be wonderful on salmon too!

Made this recipe for St Paddy's last year. It was so delicious and tasty,I make it every time I cook corned beef. I would recommend this recipe to everyone who wants to jazz up their old tired corned beef recipe.

This is the best recipe for corned beef that I've ever made and am looking forward to making it again tonight. Instead of pre-cooked meat I use fresh, and add cabbage to the carrots.

I made this but didn't have the orange marmalade on hand or the Irish whiskey, being from the south I instead used Kentucky bourbon and seedless blackberry preserves. The whole family loved it. It did take longer than 7 minutes to reduce so I boiled it about 10 minutes and as it cooled, it got really thick and the flavor seemed to develop as it sat. I will make this again--maybe make a St.Pat's tradition!

I don't have a lot of time during tax season to make St. Patty's day's meal, so this is a nice compromise. I want to try the glaze on ham too.

I used a home-cooked corned beef (boiled). Thought the glaze was very good with it! It took a lot longer than 7 minutes to reduce the glaze to 3/4 cup, though.

Tasty, but not worth the effort. I used a corned beef brisket that I boiled "in the bag" and then cooked according to the recipe. The three men I served it to agreed that just the plain brisket would have been good engough.

I purchased a corned beef from the butcher and boiled it for 2 hours changing the water twice. I did this the day before which made dinner easy the night of St Patrick's Day and also easier to cut the meet. Then I poured the glaze over the meat and added the carrots (and parsnips) and it was exceptional. Definitely on the menu each year going forward

Rather than purchase deli corned beef, I purchased a 3.75lb packaged corned beef that I cooked at 250 degree for four hours (on a rack with a bit of water in the bottom and covered with alum foil)--very tender when done. Then I sliced the beef against the grain (electric carving knife is best) and poured the lovely sauce (used apricot jam and used a 1/4 cup more than suggested) over it and wrapped it tightly for the next evening. I added the carrots as indicated and finished the beef while my guests had drinks. Rave reviews. An easy do ahead main course.

I used a home- cooked corned beef, presliced it, then added the marinade and covered the dish in foil, so the slices wouldn't get too dry. It was thoroughly wondrous! I've done the same treatment using apricot preserves mixed with grainy mustard. My non corned beef-loving husband loves these dishes! YUMMY!

This was good, and the glaze looked and smelled fabulous when making it, but even after slathering it on the corned beef, I could hardly detect it when eating it. (Except for the part that hardened on the bottom of the meat.) It was good on the carrots, but I made the HUGE mistake of using a bag of mini-carrots (my own fault -- not the fault of the recipe), which cooked away to nothing under the high heat. I probably wouldn't make it again because the (minimal) extra work just wasn't worth the (minimal) extra flavor. The simple cabbage I served with it using the Fannie Farmer recipe was sure good, though!

An excellent glaze, I keep fantisizing about what other things I can put it on. Heck, maybe I'll just eat it plain next time! I did use it on corned beef and it really spruced up a traditional dish nicely.

Excellent simple glaze...nice alternative to what can be a bland piece of meat. The recommended recipe for the carrots was a delicious side....

There are no words to describe how good this is!! We're going to replace traditional turkey on Thanksgiving for Corned Beef.

I'd give this 2 and a half stars...somewhere between good anddelicious. The carrots were great (I used packaged mini carrots), but the meat was just O.K. and a little dry and rubbery, even when sliced against the grain. I wouldn't make this again using deli corned beef, but I might consider glazing a home-cooked corned beef with the delicious sauce. The whiskey flavor was quite subtle; my picky three year old couldn't get enough of the carrots, and he even liked the meat, which he called "ham." Be careful not to over-reduce the sauce, or it will be too hard to spread when it cools and can turn to hard candy when baked. Served with green cabbage cut into about 2" squares and sauteed in butter until lightly browned, with a little salt and pepper. This recipe is too easy not to try at least once...at least try the sauce on carrots or on chicken, if corned beef isn't your thing.

Starting with fully cooked corned beef feels like cheating. (Would an apple pie ala mode recipe start with a fully cooked apple pie, or a recipe for mashed potatoes with savory gravy start with fully cooked mashed potatoes?!) And it begs the question: what cut of corned beef? Round roast? Brisket? Round roast and James Beard's 1965 corned beef recipe (also on this website) proved to be a winning precursor for this dish. Looking forward to it next year.

Corned beef and cabbage has become a tradition for friends and family on St. Patty's Day in a very non-Irish home! This recipe has become the staple. Roasting the meat with the glaze gives the meat a better texture. Used apricot preserves this time with great results! Roast potatoes alongside for an even easier meal! Saute cabbage with bacon and garlic and this meal wins even young kids vote!

Exceptional corned beef. When I told my friends I was giving a Saint Patrick's day dinner and was cooking corned beef and cabbage everyone suggested that perhaps I might consider serving something else. Apparently until this evening CB and cabbage was not a favorite for many of my friends. Well now I have them all coming back for more. Tender, flavorful and delicious. I now have 15 new corned beef lovers as friends.

Being a newlywed one of the things that is a challenge is meals. My husband is Hispanic and he does love his Mexican dishes as do I. But I am Irish and I also lived in Italy and France for quite some time so our culinary backgrounds are quite broad. This dish has become his favorite. He even requested it on his birthday.

So everybody who says they don't like corned beef, now say it's their favorite dish of all times! Definitely the best version I've ever had. Made some homemade soda bread to go with. A perfect meal...

Delicious and easy. Prepared it for St. Paddy's Day, 2006. Everyone raved, and I've shared the recipe with many. I'm goin to use it on the Easter Ham today. My suggestion? Make double and be sure an sample the Irish Whisky to make sure it's good.

Absolutely the best corned beef I've ever had, and my guests all said the same thing. The glaze is awesome. Make a double batch (or more) and use it for everything. I put some white pepper in the glaze which gave it a nice kick. It's also really good on the carrots.

I don't know what this "86%" approval rating is all about. This is an amazing recipe, incredibly delicious, and very simple. I give it 100% and so do my houseguests who were moaning, "Hmmmm corned beef...". I wasn't about to spend for deli corned beef at $8.49 per pound and so I went and bought an incredibly cheap, flat-cut and cooked it with no frills for about 4 1/2 hours. Then...this phenomenal glaze. (Maybe I'll put it in my coffee tomorrow. :) )

Excellent recipe! A small number of ingredients, easy to make and full of rich flavors. Never had corned beef with an orange accent before, but this combination worked extremely well. A definite keeper, I'l be making this again, and won't be waiting for St. Patrick's Day to do it.

Very easy and delicious! The carrots really pick up the flavors of the glaze and are a good contrast with the corned beef. My corned beef (purchased from a local Albertson's store) had one of those flavor packets, which included mustard seed. I stirred the contents of the packet into the glaze, and it turned out well.

Very yummy, very easy. I used this on left over corned beef. I used 1/2 orange marmalade, 1/2 apricot preserves, and jack daniels, because that is what we had around. Had leftover sauce and will try it carrots later in the week!

I purchased the beef and cooked it according to directions and then followed the recipe, only I used homemade peach jam instead of marmalade. I served with stir-fried buttered cabbage. My boyfriend loved this and he isn't a fan of corned beef.

My husband kept saying yum, yum, throughout the entire dinner. The carmelized carrots, and the meat really went well together. I changed the receipe slightly, because I only had 1/4 cup of marmelade, so I added 1/4 cup of Mango sauce that I purchased at Trader Joes. I also decided to make a brown sugar glaze with Dijon mustard. I used 1/8 cup of brown sugar, with a half a tablespoon of dijon mustard, and I spread this over the top of the cooked corn beef. I reduced the whiskey/mango/marmelade sauce, and tossed the carrots, and spread the sauce on top of my brown sugar paste that I had spread on top of the corn beef. The carrots were glazed, and the corn beef had a golden finish. This is one receipe that will go into my favorites, and one that my husband will ask for again. Jan Place Tacoma, Washington
