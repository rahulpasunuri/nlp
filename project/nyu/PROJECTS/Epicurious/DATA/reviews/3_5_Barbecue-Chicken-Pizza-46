This is a wonderful pizza recipe that boasts great flavor and originality. The smoked Gouda adds a great dimension to the finished product. I recommend adding bacon and some blue cheese to the toppings. Those two ingredients create such a robust flavor explosion, it will leave you wanting more. All in all a great foundation recipe to endless possibilities!

We made our topping following this BBQ Chicken Pizza recipe and subbing seitan for the chicken. Used KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce. So yummy. Flavors of smoked gouda and BBQ sauce work well together. Used the Woodfire Grill pizza dough recipe with 2 cups of whole wheat flour subbed for the unbleached all purpose flour (from Bon Appetit September 2004). Greg is making this again tonight at my request. This is not at all on our pH diet ... but it's Mother's Day. We'll have small portions with a LARGE salad with lots of raw veggies. Did I say SO yummy?

lost my post! I am starting over... I used flour tortilla as crust, pre-cooked breaded chicken tenders, sliced rings of red onion, sliced peaches in heavy syrup, drained. BBQ sauce. Colby/jack/cheddar blend, shredded. Add some greens for color - some ripped arugula greens or cilantro, or scallion greens - it will look as good as it tastes.

Will definitely make again. My 2-yr-old loved it & so easy to do after work. I didn't use Gouda cheese though, just plain old-fashioned mozzarella did the trick.

Delicious! I used whole wheat pizza dough from Trader Joes and added cilantro - I think those two things made the difference. Will definitely make it again!

Made this without the Gouda (mozzarella instead) and included potatoes and leeks. Very very tasty and easy!

This was very good and very simple to make, especially when using left-over cooked chicken. I like to sprinkle fresh cilantro over the top.

Not a huge fan of BBQ pizza but I really enjoyed this recipe. I made mini pizzas for a party using dough from the pizza shop around the corner.

I also added a yellow pepper, but omitted the green onion. It had lots of flavor and was gone fast!

This was very good, but next time I will use smoked gruyere cheese as the Gouda just sort of sat there, and did not melt. As a result, little bits of cheese kept flying off. I also put cilantro on when it came out of the oven. Very fast and easy to make and, even better, tasty to eat.

Fast, easy and delicious, what more could you ask for? I used a mix of cheddar and mozzerella because that is what I had on hand. It would be even better with smoked gouda. I also sauteed and carmalized the red onion with a yellow pepper that I had on hand. Amazing.

This was a great, fast weeknight dinner. I thought the smoked gouda was a nice touch, but my finicky husband wasn't a big fan. I threw in a little Monterey Jack too. I cooked the red onion a little to soften it and substituted cilantro for the green onion, as suggested by other reviewers--excellent.

Audience: VERY finicky nieces who weren't thrilled to be hanging with me during an overnight babysitting gig. We made these pizzas, along with 2 other "custom" pizzas designed by them. Much to my surprise - they asked me to make another one later!

I made this using what I had on hand on a busy weeknight--no red or green onion in the house but the pizza was delicious anyway! I will definately make this again and add the onion next time (probably will carmalize the onion first). Great recipe!

Yummy! I took the time to search for the smoked Gouda and am glad I did. I think it made the pizza very different from the ones we usually make. Marinated the chicken for a while in the barbecue sauce, and sprinkled (liberally) with garlic powder while it cooked. My husband made the dough fresh, but other than that we pretty much followed the recipe. Next time I'll take the suggestions below and add cilantro at the end... this pizza was awesome!

mmm...smoked gouda makes everything better! This is a great pizza!

This was a very easy and tasty weekday meal. To speed things along, I also used the prepared Tyson grilled chicken strips, and added a little mozzarella on the crust before the rest of the toppings. Loved the tang of the barbeque sauce and the smoothness of the gouda. Great with a salad and purple grapes on the side. Yum! My boys even liked it! Will be doing again.

This was so easy and great for a busy school night. I used rotisserie chicken from the deli. Great flavor and so simple.

Great and EASY party appetizer or main dish. I used chicken tenders in place of the full breast. Quicker to cook and tastes great! I may add more cheese next time.

This is particularly good if you have leftover barbecued chicken. I like the double whammy of the sauce already cooked onto the chicken plus some slicked on the crust. I top it with Jack cheese, sauteed red onion, another drizzle of sauce if I feel like it, and a little chopped fresh cilantro. Yum!

The only change I made was adding a whole red pepper, fairly large, chopped up, and substituting mozzarella for smoked gouda. Was a good dinner, ate over half of it myself. Planning to eat the rest later.

This pizza was so quick and tasted great. I sauteed the red onion for about 5 minutes. I also used the frozen tyson fajita grilled chicken strips and just tossed them in Sticky Fingers Barbecue sauce. I added a touch of mozzarella and cheddar.

The pizza was great. I used Famous Dave Original BBQ Sauce, caramelized the onions, and added cilantro at the end (as suggested previously.) The smoked gouda gave it a really nice flavor. This recipe was a big hit with my family, and it was so easy to make that I'm definitely doing it again.

I think this is a good easy weeknight dinner recipe. Hubby got regular gouda instead of smoked, don't know if that made a diff or not. I made two pizzas. One with gouda and mozzarella and one with cheddar and mozz. Both were good, but we liked the cheddar better. We used Sweet Baby Ray's sauce and it was a bit sweet. Next time I'll carmelize the onions and add mushrooms.

I thought this was pretty good. My daughter and my fiance LOVED it. I used my homemade barbecue sauce, which is sweet and spicy.

I've made this dish twice, with rave reviews both times. I added mozzarella and cut down on the Gouda a little bit. Delicious!

I make an easier version of this recipe by using the Lloyds or KC Shredded BBQ Chicken which you can find in the supermarket. I also make my own pizza dough and add cilantro. My children love it and so do I.

I love BBQ pizza, and I've managed to convert my husband as well by doing the following: I use homemade crust, leftover BBQ chicken, and his sauce (slightly adapted from a Steven Raichlen recipe). I also like to add some sliced jalepeno before baking and some cilantro after. My son likes a little pineapple on his.

I thought this pizza was just OK, but my boyfriend loved it and ate like 6 pieces--good thing I made 2 pizzas. He asked for BBQ pizza due to fond memories of living in LA and eating the California Pizza Kitchen BBQ chicken pizza (who also do an AWESOME Thai peanut chicken pizza)but he thought this BBQ recipe was better. I used Sweet Baby Rays Hickory sauce and was much more liberal with the sauce, smoked Gouda (mmmm) and onion. Also, I didn't use a Boboli crust but I probably will next time.

Rating: 3
I used a thin crust boboli and added the cilantro before serving as suggested. I also was conservative with the BBQ sauce (used Jack Daniel's Tennesse Hickory - mmmm) as was recommended by a reviewer. Turned out great. Not out of this world, but infinitely better than any of the processed-cheese-laden pizzas that seem to be the love of St. Louisans. I also used a pizza stone and next time, I will cut back cooking time to 10 - 12 minutes.

This is a great, basic BBQ Chicken pizza recipe. A local bistro here does a similiar pizza, however they saute their red onions first and they add black beans and top it off with fresh cilantro. i like to add a sprinkling of crumbled blue cheese. The tanginess of the cheese is a nice contrast to the sweetness of the BBQ sauce.

My husband and I had a "pizza party" with friends recently. We gave each person a small crust (bought at an Italian deli) and we laid out different prep stations with the ingredients for several kinds pizzas (including instructions) for each to make their own. This was one of the options available and it received some of the best reviews overall! I made it again, and we liked it even more than the first time! This is not a difficult recipe and can be made in a reasonably short amount of time. We used KC Masterpiece Hickory Flavor BBQ sauce, which I don't think I would ever use otherwise, but the sweetness was perfect and not overpowering. However, I did use the BBQ sauce sparingly on the crust.

As is, I thought that this was terrible. However, I will try it again substituting mozzerella and cilantro.

This was a wonderful pizza! I made my own crust - half whole wheat and half white flour - it was great! I stayed pretty true to the recipe other than that. The smoked Gouda was great on the pizza and I used Bull's Eye BBQ sauce. I had to cook my pizza an extra 3 or 4 minutes as well to fully heat the toppings.

I make a bbq chicken pizza similar to this and add cilantro and also half n half bbq sauce and teriyaki sauce,also shitake mushrooms. It's delicous!!

Rating: 3
My husband thinks this is delicious! Made better with minor adjustments. Used sweet onions and sauteed down before adding to pizza. Shredding the chicken is better. Did a blend of mozzarella and smoked gouda. Use the thin-crust Boboli instead of regular, it gives this recipe more of a California-pizza texture.

Rating: 1
I wasn't impressed with the BBQ sauce idea as we found it over-powering. Next time I'd just use some crushed garlic, olive oil, black pepper, parsley, basil, and a little oregano instead of the sauce. I would also try throwing on more onion and some artichokes to add a little zip.

I just made these in a winery deli that I work at and they really went over big. However, I used our pita bread base, spread with plain old Wish Bone Italian salad dressing, and a mixture of smoked gouda and mozzarella. I skipped the green onion. After baking, I too sprinkled fresh cilantro on them. Really nice and really filling.

Very tasty. Made it for a dinner party and it was a success! My husband doesn't usually care for BBQ ck pizza, but enjoyed this. I used preroasted chicken from grocery with a premade crust - couldn't be easier!

I will make it again, but with a few changes. Didn't like the big slices of chicken, so will shred it or dice it next time. Think I'll also try the garlic seasoning on the chicken, as mentioned in earlier reviews. I did omit the green onion, and substitued with chopped fresh cilantro after the pizza came out of the oven. Maybe more BBQ sauce too! KIMBER

This is a quick, easy, and inexpensive dinner that tasted great. While we don't think it's 4-forks material, we will definitely make it again (and it was even better the 2nd day as leftovers!) Don't skip the smoked gouda! It makes the dish.

I didn't have red onion, so I used yellow, which I carmelized first. And I didn't have barbecue sauce so I made my own with soy sauce, A-1, tomato paste, white wine, oregano, tabasco and black pepper. It was delicious! I used mozzarella and monterey jack cheese and choped the chicken and green onions well. Because there are no mushrooms in this recipe, my five year old ate it down quick. My three and one year olds both picked at the topping, becuase it was a bit spicy. Next time, I'll make it with the smoked gouda.

We make a lot of homemade pizza. (My brother just happens to be in the business also). We thought that this recipe was tasty. I usually make my own crust, but was in a hurry this time and thought that the Boboli was a decent substitute. The smoked Gouda does not melt well, so we combined mozzarella with it. I would use about 1/3 pound smoked Gouda to about a scant 1/2 lb. mozzarella. I think a cheesy pizza is best and according to my brother, all pizzas should have a mixture of 2 cheeses or more. He has a recipe similar to this one and for those willing to experiment, try BBQing both the chicken and onions together, tossing the chicken with the BBQ sauce as suggested, and adding fresh chopped cilantro. Use an olive oil and garlic base and try adding jack cheese as well. There are endless additions you can make to this tasty recipe. It is very enjoyable!

Grill a couple of extra boneless chicken breasts next time you have a barbeque, freeze and then thaw them before making this...super easy! One of my husband's favorites.

I, too, made my own crust...there's nothing better when you use a pizza stone. I also grilled the chicken breast and basted it with a very easy homemade bbq sauce. I still included a little bit of pizza sause and reduced the amount of bbq sauce. The results were fabulous. The pizza was loved by all...especially my two year old.

This pizza was definately different. Next time I will grill the chicken (found that there was too much oil, plus I like the bbq flavour) and second, I will probably change the cheese. I found that it did not melt properly. I placed the pizza on a pizza stone and the crust came out really crispy.

Rating: 3
Everybody liked it. I didn't have the smoked gouda but used smoked cheddar with pizza cheese (mozzarella, provolone, romano, & parmesan). Used K.C hickory BBQ sauce and kids thought I should use less sauce next time. Other wise, it's a great recipe for people on the run, quick and easy.

Delicious pizza. Based on previous reviews, I made my own pizza dough to a thin crust(not so hard when you use quick rising yeast) and added cilantro (a must). Came out delicious, will definitly be making over and over again. Big hit at superbowl party.

Definitely a great pizza when you're tired of the more traditional pizza with red sauce. I've been making this for years - with the substitution of cilantro in place of green onion and a mix of Italian cheeses including mozarella, asiago, parmesan and romano. Cilantro really adds great flavor. Additionally, try shredding your chicken instead of slicing it - makes it easier when you're ready to eat!

A real pizza lover, this recipe went over very well. Easy to make, but serves only a few with hearty appetites. Use a lot of sauce over the Boboli as it tends to dry out during baking (unless you prefer your pizza a little crispier).

If you really want to set off the barbecue use a whole wheat crust--just make sure to use a thin crust as previously mentioned

Add a bit of cilantro, it really makes this pizza

this is probably based on the chicken pizza at the california pizza kitchen restaurant. it's very similar. only problem is that the barbecue flavors work well on a thinner crust, while the one you suggested has much thicker crust, one that would probably work better with heartier pepperoni or other similar topping.
