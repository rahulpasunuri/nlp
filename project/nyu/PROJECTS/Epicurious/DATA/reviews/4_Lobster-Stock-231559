Needed to make this in a lickety split hurry as an anticipated Christmas guest who only eats fish was staying home with the flu. Didn't want to send him a care package that included any cream based sauces that were already on the menu. This was the ticket and took hardly any time out of my already hectic day. Like others, I had no fennel bulb on hand, so substituted fennel seeds and celery. Pulled some poached shells out of the freezer and in less than 2 hours the stock was done. I did not take the time (It WAS Christmas morn)to coarsely chop the shells yet certainly realise how much more flavourful it would have been had I not neglected this step. Still since I used the carcasses of 4 lobsters, it was rich enough. Wound up with a quart of stock turned into soup (leeks, ginger, carrots and lobster meat added) for the sickie and 2 pints for my freezer. They won't stay there long though as I'm considering making a lobster pot pie for NYEve.

Another trick I've found for replacing fennel (the taste) is with a splash (or two) of Greek Ouzo . I find it is a better substitute flavor wise than fennel seed. But if all you have is fennel seed, I think it's better than nothing. You do need that fennel in there one way or another.

Makes a great base for lobster risotto. Do try to find a fennel bulb - it really complements the lobster flavor in this recipe.

We made this with cooked lobster shells and 1 teaspoon fennel seed (didn't have any fresh bulbs available). It was great as a bouillabasse stock the following weekend.

This is by far the best lobster stock. I didn't have fennel on hand and used celery instead. Fantastic and very easy!
