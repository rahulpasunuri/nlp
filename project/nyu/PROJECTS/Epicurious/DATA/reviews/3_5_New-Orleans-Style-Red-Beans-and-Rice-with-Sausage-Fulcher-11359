Great recipe! My family loved it, but asked to tone-down the cloves a little. Using another reviewer's example, I added an orange pepper. the level of hotness surprised us. I was ready to include a wee bit of African bird pepper...glad I didn't! Definitely a keeper

Surprisingly delicious - a true home run recipe for this dish. I made a few small changes that resulted in a meal that had my husband and toddlers licking their plates, so I'm sticking with them. First, I sautéed the onion, celery and a clove of minced garlic in some olive oil for about 8 minutes. I added all the spices during the final minute (except the bay leaf, obviously). Then I added the remaining ingredients but subbed chicken broth for the water. Next time, I'm making baguettes for this!

The ONLY change I made to this recipe was adding a diced green pepper - other than that, I followed the recipe as written and in my opinion, there was WAY too much clove and allspice. Although it smelled great, I couldn't eat more than a few bites because the clove and allspice were too overpowering in the dish. Cut the cloves and allspice at least by half and maybe this would be a keeper.

Yum! This is a new family favorite. It can be difficult to find recipies that are easy, delicious, nutritious, and inexpensive, all at the same time. I used mild italian chicken sausage, 2 shallots and 1 garlic clove, and chicken broth. My grinder was out of commission so I used allspice berries and picked them out at the end. I also subbed quinoa for the rice. I soaked the beans overnight, then threw everything in the crock pot the next morning. The house smelled amazing when we came home, and aside from setting the table and cooking the quinoa dinner was ready.

This was a wonderful dish! I cut back on the salt the second time. Just the right amount of heat. The allspice and cloves blended well with the other flavors. This one is a keeper.

I have explored and eaten my way through New Orleans. This red beans and rice recipe is a close as I've ever found to Nawlins. Give it a try!!! Remember always taste for flavor. No excuses for bland food, if you are tasting for flavor.

EMERIL LAGASSE has a very similar recipe in his LOUISIANA REAL & RUSTIC Cookbook which I made last night. It is nearly identicle but doesn't have the Tobasco,cloves, allspice, white pepper or oregano that this recipe has. Emerils version also calls for a 'bell pepper' as well. I made Emerils version of this using smoked Kielbassa. The dish was very good I added a little extra cayenne I like it hot! Next time I will add the spices from this 'epicurious version' to see how it is. I didn't 'rate' this recipe because I didn't use the spices this 'Epicurious version' called for & I didn't want to affect the ratings.

One fork is pushing it. With all the rave reviews, I didn't expect these beans to be so flavorless. They aren't a complete failure. They are edible, however, I won't be having a 2nd serving. Straight to the compost- good thing beans are cheap. They were simple + boring beans, but spicy, I'll give them that.

The 1st time I made this it was pretty good but the 2nd time, I made it the night before and let all those flavors come together and WOW! That's the secret. I also used chicken broth, ham hocks and summer sausage.

This was incredibly easy and delicious! I followed the recipe almost exactly, except added extra garlic and caramelized the mire poire a bit. I used vegi stock instead of water (found had to use a lot toward the end for a sauce), and sauteed spicy chicken sausage with some onion and garlic before adding it to the beans. Served over rice with creamed cornbread muffins - came out amazing and will definitely be in my usual rotation of recipes! Tasted even better the next day :o)

If I had my grandmother's N'awlins recipe, this would've been it! Fantastic. Delicious...multi- layered and comforting. It's a great, great dish. You won't believe how fantastic it is and you won't believe how good your kitchen smells when you're done. I didn't use garlic powder, just one more clove of garlic...that was the only substitution I made.

THis was so easy to make and so good. I read what other people had done. I sauteed the onion, celery and garlic first. I used chicken broth instead of water. I added worcestershire sauce. I used Hot Smoked Sausage and I used Zatarain's New Orleans Style Dirty Rice. THis came out spicy and good! Warmed us up on a cold winters night.

This is delicious! I made mine into more of a soup, by pureeing several cups of beans after tasting and liking the puree. I didn't use Tabasco, used a little more cayenne and crushed red pepper instead. Added a dash of balsamic vinegar for a hint of sweetness and acidity. Also added a sweet orange pepper at the beginning and sauteed the pepper, onion and celery after browning the sausage. Didn't have allspice or cloves, so used a pinch of cinnamon which brings out the flavors of the other spices, probably about an eight of a teaspoon, same amount of ancho chili pepper too. Definitely want to make this again with the allspice and cloves to compare. Used three links of hot Turkey Italian sausage. Will definitely make this again. Am serving over brown rice and will be eating this all week. It makes tons!

I have been using this recipe and ONLY this recipe for years for my beans. I'm a native New Orleanean and so I'm picky about my beans. This recipe is great. I don't know how others made theirs too spicy and I definitely don't understand the bland comments. The thing I love about this recipe is all the different spices. They give it so much depth.

Rating: 3
After seeing all the ingredients in the pot, I figured it needed more beans to balance it out. So I added another can of red kidney and one can of pinto beans and it turned out great. Like others before me, I used one can of low sodium chix broth for more depth of flavor that took the place of an equal amount of water. I didn't have white pepper or clov,es, so I omitted them and I like how it turned out. Serve this over the rice and you got a really good dish.

Rating: 2
I have NO idea what I did wrong. I subbed 4 cups chicken broth and 2 cups ham broth (water and ham base) for the water. Dried red beans, not kidney beans. No added salt, because even though I used low sodium chicken broth, I added 2 tsp of salty ham base in the mix. 1 tsp of Tobasco and 1/4 tsp of cayenne. I can't taste onion, celery, garlic, clove or allspice. All I can taste is FIRE. I simmered my beans for two hours after the initial 1-1/2 just so I could keep adding water to help thin out the spice. I even added a can of tomato paste to help flavor it up more and cut some of the spice, but all that did was make it a bit prettier, and more to our taste. I think I could love this recipe with some tweaks, but I'll be lucky if I can eat this without stirring in a blop of sour cream. And we're spicy food eaters! Sheesh!

I made this dish with good andouille sausage, as recommeded by several reviewers, and followed all other instructions to the letter. However, the final result was very disappointing. While it was easy, filling, and smelled good while cooking, the dish was very unappealling to look at, and was remarkably boring to eat. I will not bother to make it again.

This is a huge hit with my family. The last time I made it, my 18 year old son asked if I would make a double batch so he could eat it all week. I used andouille sausage this time but it is equally good with kielbasa or plain smoked sausage.

I love it!! However, I do the sausage differently, and pan fry thin, quarter sized slices until they're pretty dark, deglaze the pan and add the slices at the end. Other than that, word for word followed the written instructions. AWESOME recipe! I may panfry more sausage to add, per someone else's comment

OMIT salt if using canned beans! I used 3 cans kidney beans + 1 can black mashed for thickness - I don't know if the canned beans had salt already. But other than that, very good and extremely simple - just throw everything in the pot at once and stir occasionaly - no muss, no fuss.

Yes! Forget the garlic powder and add an extra minced clove. I used kielbase and sauteed the slices to remove a lot of fat, which gave me a fond that added to the flavor. Served with a very tart salad, this was a really great family dinner.

I saw the allspice, and cloves and I had to try this. I was skeptical once it started to simmer, the smell was intense, but pleasantly surprised when it was done. The taste is very good, almost sweet, like sugar was added. I lived in South Lousiana for 2 years, and saw many recipes. I personally prefer a little ham hock or ham bone with the sausage, and less black pepper, and some red pepper, delete the allspice and cloves. Besides that, not much different, and my kid said it was just as good. But, to each his own.

This was very very good. This recipe however made enough to feed an army, so my husband and I were left a little overwhelmed. It made a lot more than 6-8 servings. I think if I had halved the recipe we would have had had plenty for now and some to freeze for later. Also, for this amount of beans, i would double the amount of meat.

My Louisiana-born husband loved this! He suggested leaving out a little bit of the clove, but otherwise said this is as authentic and good as any he has ever had. I used illshire Farms Spicy Smoked Sausage, which gave the finished product a right smart bite.

Excellent and easy. I actually had all the ingredients on hand except for the sausage! I used red beans rather than kidney beans, and used andouille (that might not be spelled right). We took it to a Mardi Gras pot luck and it was the hit of the party. Highly recommend this recipe!

I am so glad that my recipe matches Epicurious. I actually got my original recipe from a cookbook (The Little New Orleans Cook Book) I purchased at Sample House-Dallas nearly 25 years ago. I changed it to suit my tastes based on what I had eaten at a long-defunct New Orleans-style restaurant here in Dallas. The only items I had not added were the cloves and the allspice. I will give this a try. One thing I do that is not mentioned in your recipe is I pass some file' powder [ground sassafrass] which adds a bit of earthy flavor for those who enjoy it. Of course, it is best to use freshly ground file', but that is not always possible. I also use beef broth or beef stock to give it a richer flavor. I have made this dish every year to take to work and for a Mardi Gras celebration at home. My coworkers from my former job miss my bringing this for lunch. My new coworkers look forward to lunch this one day every year. My entire family looks forward to this dish all year long. It does taste better as it sits. Happy Mardi Gras ya'll!

I had made this recipe several times before, and really liked it. However, the other day I was not in the mood to go to the store (that's unusual in itself) so ended up making it with kielbasa and smoked sausage, and with BLACK BEANS! Yep...frijoles negras. They changed the recipe greatly. It isn't really any better than with red beans, but it is just as good in a different way. The family loved it, and we reheated it for several days (just keeps getting better). OK...so what is it? Not red beans and rice, but something worth repeating. :P Yum...

Okay, so every time we eat out at Pappadeaux I can't seem to get enough of their Red Beans and Rice. So I was skeptical, to say the least, that this recipe would stand up to restaurant quality. Was I ever wrong! Hubby couldn't stop commenting on its lovely flavor, and we both hovered over the pot long after dinner was over to sneak one more bean (even the 11 month old baby seemed to like it). I followed this recipe pretty closely, omitted the allspice and white pepper (we were out of both), and added a bit of chicken boullion for flavor, and it turned out fantastic - the level of spice and heat was perfect. Next time I will try it in the crockpot according to the other's suggestions. You won't be disappointed with this one!

Rating: 4
delish! Tasting as it cooked I was afraid the allspice and cloves were overpoering and out of place, but they mellowed and created wonderful warm flavor by the end of cooking. I use a pressure cooker instead of soaking beans - pressure cook beans in water only for about 30 min - then finish recipe per instructions.

Rating: 3
The flavors were delicious but I used canned red beans, and they never "broke down" (becoming mushy) the way they are supposed to. A New Orleans native told me to use pink and not red beans...the pink break down better, evidently. This native also told me another way to make this dish. Use dried pink beans, don't soak overnight. Put everything in the pot at one time, bring everything to a boil, then reduce the flame to a bare simmer, and cook until everything is absorbed, about three hours. Now, I haven't tried this, so if you do, realize this method has not been tested by me, but he said people in New Orleans used to make this on laundry day because it took a long time to make, but needed no attention once it got going. I might try to make it again using this method, and if you do, good luck and post the results, OK?

This recipe is very good as written, not outstanding. We wanted more heat, so I would add cayenne to taste. I threw everything into a crock pot on low for 4 hours, then high for 2 hours, and my only issue with that was that I had to leave the top off for a bit to evaporate some water. Good, easy recipe I would try again.

I love this recipe, it was so easy and my family loved it. I did make the following changes: I added the whole pound of sausage at the beginning to cook with the bean mixture, and at the end I added to the mashed bean paste 1/2 pound of hot chorizo (Mexican sausage) instead. I would definitely make it again!

Wonderful recipe for authentic red beans and rice. Used smoked cajun sausage from local meat shop, turned out great! Cut half of the cayenne, because the sausage was already seasoned and was still plenty spicy. Used three cans of kidney beans and added 1 1/2 Cups of chicken broth and 5 cups of water. Turned out great. All the flavors mingled well over the 2hr cook time. I will use half the amount of cloves next time, as I thought the flavor was a little dominating over the others.

Okay...I know it drives people crazy when someone rates a recipe they haven't made according to original directions, but I had to share my experience. I am a cook who will slave for anything, but I will not soak beans, so I used two cans of red kidney beans. Sauteed some chicken andouille sausage, added a handful of shrimp, and then threw everything else in according to directions. In lieu of all that water, I added about a cup of chicken stock. Simmered it, then added a couple of dashes of red wine vinegar, because in my experience, Red Beans and Rice has a vinegary under-profile. It was fabulous, my husband raved, and it was done in about thirty minutes. Even better the next day, so you could make it the night before having company over.

A hearty dish for the winter. I used chipotle sausage for an extra kick. Very easy to make.

I've made this recipe many times and my mouth waters everytime I think of making it again! If you love New Orleans style spicy food, this is it. I often lessen the amount of white pepper and Tabasco for my young daughter's sake, but that does make a noticeable difference in the final flavor. One addition I make to this recipe: When I was a child, my mom used to make RB&R often. She would add a few ham hocks for added flavor. The fat and rich meats inherent to the hock adds an indescribably delicious essence to the blend. However, finding bizarre pork products in my meal was always a turn-off to me. So here's what I do: Pick up some culinary grade cheesecloth (found at most grocery stores, not at the local auto-parts store). Place two or three Smoked Ham Hocks in a square of cheesecloth, and tie off with twine or wire. Add this to your RB&R as it simmers. Before serving, remove the hocks, and either discard, or for added flavor, pick through them and pull off all the meat from them and return the meat to the RB&R. Then discard the remainder of the hocks. You won't be disappointed!

This dish is de-lish! Just a note about cooking time on the beans . . . try using a pressure cooker. My husband is from india, where every home cook has at least one pressure cooker, and they are indispensible for cooking beans, curries etc. For awhile, I was awfully afraid of it, but now that I've learned, it's a dream. And I was able to prepare this dish in ONE HOUR - and without the overnight soaking of the beans!

Rating: 4
Delicious! I'm from New Orleans and this really took me back there -- much better than Zatarains. I omitted the Tabasco on accident but it tasted fine. If u use canned beans, buy about 2.5lbs of canned beans and it still needs to simmer just as long. Don't overboil and Italian sausage makes a good substitute. I used previously cooked Chicken Italian sausage and it was good although a bit rubbery but I blame that on overboiling. I served it with Basmati rice as well (but do not choose Basmati that is very aromatic!-only mild).

I thought the spices were too over powering in this recipe especially the allspice. These didn't taste at all like traditional red beans & rice. There wasn't enough cooking time to soften the beans either. Any time I've tried 3-4 fork winners in the past I've been equally satisfied with the recipe. But not this time. I won't be keeping or making this recipe again.

We loved this recipe! It was easy to make, had a nice level of spice (not too spicy but definitely not blan) and was very satisfying. I used andouille sausage and cooked the entire amount with the bean mixture right from the beginning. I cooked the links whole then removed them at the end and cut them into bite size pieces. It was very tender and I believe cooking the sausage with the bean mixture added flavor. Yum!

I didn't make this recipe, but it is very similar to the way I make red beans (I don't use allspice or cloves) but I had a tip about the sausage - I put half of it in at the beginning of cooking, but do not slice it -- leave it in 5 or 6 inch lengths to cook with the beans. Then remove and slice it, and return to the pot. The sausage's texture changes somewhat from the long cooking, but it is still quite tasty. It flavors the beans, and also absorbs flavor from the beans and cooking liquid. In fact, every time I do it (I don't make red beans that often) I wish I'd put more of the sausage in at the beginning!

I made this before but forgot where I got the recipe. This is excellent! Today, I had some smoked ham hocks and I simmered those for several hours then cooled the stock from them and used the cooled stock to cook the beans.

This dish was called Spicy Red Beans and Rice in the magazine with exactly same ingredients but it had a slightly different method. I combined the two methods by sauteing the onion, celery and garlic in a little olive oil until soft, but divided the sausage (Bruce Aidell's Andouille) as in this version. I also used small red beans and didn't mash any, as it was creamy enough. It was just as good as everyone said. Will definitely make it again.

I liked this recipe a lot, and I have made New Orleans style red beans using different recipes many other times. However, I had trouble buying smoked sausage and ended up using a pork sausage that didn't work perfectly... I'll try harder next time to get the right kind. And I had to cook the beans much longer than the recipe called for. It ended up taking about 45 minutes longer for the beans to get soft, even with the overnight soak. What did I do wrong?

This was very good. I was a little skeptical about putting half the sausage in the beginning and half in the end thinking that it would not make a difference, but it really does. The sausage that you put in last is so much tastier. The first sausage is almost flavorless from being cooked for so long. Also I pureed 1 cup of the beans like it said and that seemed to be a good thing. Follow the recipe ITS GOOD!
