Just in time! Something to do with hundreds of apples falling from my tree. I made multiple batches of the apple filling and put it in the freezer in serving sized, air tight bags. It thawed beautifully and I served it warm with home made vanilla bean ice cream.

followed the recipe word for word except for grilling our grannys on my good 'ol smokey joe (soaked Jack Daniel's used barrel wood chips added another demension). BigHa Yum had by all. Next week: mango maddness (called mango shrimp wraps on epicurious)
