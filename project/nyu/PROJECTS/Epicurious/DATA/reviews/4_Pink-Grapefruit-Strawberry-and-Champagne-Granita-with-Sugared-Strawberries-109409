A huge hit...so easy to make! I made it with a rose brut Champagne, and served the rest of the bottle with dessert in glasses with the same sugar rim as the bowls with the granita. It was perfect for summer!

I have made this granita several times with rave reviews. The fresh grapefruit juice and good quality champagne is a must!

I was just thinking about this recipe as Thanksgiving approaches. It is superb. The granita itself will have you popping into the freezer witha fork every few hours, but the sugared strawberries will melt your resolve completely. This is a wonderful dessert and so easy to make!

Made this recipe for a dinner party and it was a hit. Did not have marscapone - thought dish was fine without.

Yummy! I increased the strawberry content a bit and thought the flavor combination was excellent. The sugared strawberries are a great idea but you could flavor the sugar any way you want I imagine -- the lemon flavor didn't come out and I'm sure most people didn't even notice it. The mascarpone was a must -- perfect combination with strawberries!

Rather nice: sweet, refreshing, lots of flavor. I didn't have any open champagne on hand so I substituted 1 cup vodka. The microplane was a bit odd for the sugar-lemon peel combo. Long strands made it more difficult to dip the strawberries. I wouldn't bother about the cookies, however. A nice summer dessert I'd say--very fruity. I think any berry or fruit would do: watermelon, yum!
