A beautiful souffle--I loved the color as well as the taste. It is a little tart on its own, but I took the suggestions already made in other reviews and served w/ a creme anglaise, which complemented it very well. (there's a good recipe here on Epicurious from Bon Appetit, 2/98).

Very nice souffle. It rises incredibly high and takes quite a while to fall. It is quite tart and I like that, but I did serve it with creme anglaise which toned it down alot.

This was quite good and fully doubled in heighth. I have never had a recipe that rose quite this tall. It is a little tart so I served it with creme anglaise and it was a perfect balance.

I'm constantly on the prowl for great non-fat desserts, and this one was wonderful. It's sweet and delicious, and doesn't feel light at all. I did prepare the ramekins with butter and sugar, to ensure that the souffles would fully rise.

The only way someone could possibly think this was good is if they had been on a starvation diet with nothing sweet for weeks upon end. Frankly, I would prefer to forego dessert than to have this.
