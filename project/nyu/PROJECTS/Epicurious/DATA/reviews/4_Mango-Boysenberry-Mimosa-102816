There are at least two ways to "squeeze" boysenberries. One, the way it tells you in the recipe - process the berries, pour into a fine sieve and press on solids. Two, if you don't have a processor, put the thawed berries in a large zip-lock bag, close the bag (remove most of air first) and massage with your hands until "juiced". Then proceed with the fine sieve.

Wonderful recipe! The presentation was beautiful in a champagne flute and they tasted great! Served this to guests as they arrived at my first attempt at entertaining -- a brunch for 15 - and they went over splendidly. One drawback was that it was kind of tedious to squeeze the juice out of the boysenberries. We didn't know of any special tool to do this, but I'm sure there was an easier way. Well worth it though -- will definitely make these again.
