Excellent! Tasted great and presented beautifully. A new favorite dessert. My two tips - I grated the pistachios using my rotary parmesan cheese / nut grater. Worked great. Definitely need to let the cake chill before trimming the edges in order to get the nice neat lines.

I LOVE this cake. I make it every year and like many other reviewers use fresh picked strawberries. And I don't bother with the food colouring. The combination of flavours is perfect. In fact, I prefer this cake over many of the cakes listed under "Best of Epicurious". I guess it's a matter of preference.

Wonderful! I am astounded at the negative reviews, however, the "American" palate is very different from a "European" palate. This is not the typical overly sweet, sugary dessert your average Joe goes for.

I make this cake every summer with fresh-picked strawberries. It's refreshing and decadent, with the strawberries and buttercream and marzipan. It's a bit time consuming though, and I don't bother with the food coloring.

I made this recipe a couple of times as written, each with great success. To those who panned the flavor. This is a European style cake. No over-the-top sugary recipe. If your expecting super sweet look elsewhere. The light flavor is fabulous, and the presentation stunning. I used ripe fresh from the field strawberries.

This was terrible. And I'm even good at cakes! The cake itself was tasteless. The pastry cream was delicious until I added the butter (per the recipe), and then it just tasted like butter. During assembly, the pastry cream kept oozing out, despite chilling it thoroughly. Even if it had stayed together perfectly (and I profoundly respect anyone who can do it, with the way the recipe is written), it just didn't taste good. Also very time-consuming. Don't waste your time.

This cake had some of the most dramatic presentation I've achieved in a cake and plated beautifully. The marzipan was especially wonderful to work with and made for a gorgeous professional finish.

If only this recipe had a picture! I made this first from the original magazine recipe in 1990 and have made it many times. It is one of the most beautiful desserts you can make, and absolutely delicious. The cake always provokes gasps of amazement, and people break out their cameras. I lost the original recipe and am so happy to find it again here! Thanks, Epicurious!

I agree with the cook from NY-- a disappointing recipe. The cake was bland and didn't rise well, so it was hard to slice in half. The cream was great, but the rest of the cake was unmemorable.

This cake is not worth making. All of the previous reviewers gave it four forks and I was excited to try this for Easter dinner. What a disappointment. The marzipan was difficult to color and never rolled out right. The cake was sticky and not particularly flavorful. The cream was good; you may as well just make the cream and serve it with fresh strawberries.

I made this recipe earlier this year, I found it in an old copy of Bon Appetit. It is a work of art. It does take some time to prepare, but is well worth the effort. I plan to make this again for a Christmas Luncheon I will be hostessing. I never make a recipe for company without making and getting approval of my family, they were all in agreement this one's a"KEEPER"! Delicious and Beautiful to look at.

Marvelous flavors and beautiful presentation. Everyone fought over the last piece; although it took time to make, it was SOOOO worth it. I'll add this to my favorites!

I am a novice baker so this was a challage for me. I found that working with marzapan was not as difficult as I expected. I was very pleased with the results, the taste as well as the presentation! I served it at a birthday party and got 4forks up all around!
