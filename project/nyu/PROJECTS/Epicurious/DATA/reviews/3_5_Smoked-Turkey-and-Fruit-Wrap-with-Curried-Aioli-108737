I've made this wrap for numerous events. They are very well received and people always ask for the recipe. The flavors are outstanding!

I thought this had way too much raw garlic. I'd halve it next time.

I made this for an outdoor party last weekend, and it was a big hit! My friends wanted to bring the leftover sandwiches home. I added swiss cheese, and thought that was a good addition to the recipe.

Delicious! I prepared these in advance for a picnic and wrapped tightly in wax paper. They held up beautifully! I used whole wheat tortillas, light mayonnaise, and I added chopped cilantro. These wraps are sooo good!

Wow, what interesting flavors, easy to prepare. Next time, I'm slicing the fruit slightly thinner, and using jumbo tortillias.

I am a student at a university studying restaurant management and I made this wrap for a class in which we run a restaurant and serve the public. EVERY guest raved at how good the wrap was and when my classmates got to eat the leftover wraps they all gushed at how good it was and they all wanted the recipe so they could make it themselfs. This is a DEFINATE make!

A winner . . . in the kitchen and on the table. Have made it several times just for two.

The only mistake was to fail to double the recipe. Receieved unsolicited oohs and ahs from all my guests, each craning his/her head into the kitchen hoping for more. Absolutely Delicious!
