Loved it, but hubs didn't like the "green stuff". I'll just make it without next time. Used chicken stock, chicken broth, and turkey stock. Used orechiette. Added parsley,red pepper flakes, and minced garlic to meatballs but didn't like the raw garlic flavor; will use powdered next time. Used 1/2 teaspoon measure to form meatballs & refrigerated before cooking.

A hit! Delicious! I followed the recipe to the l-e-t-t-e-r, and it was perfect. Served four for lunch with some good bread & butter & pickles and we were all perfectly satisfied. One minor complaint - what does "4 ounces" of pasta mean? Quarter of a pound? Half a cup? I guessed "one cup" for the pasta and it seemed OK. But the soup overall is lovely. Light and substantial all at the same time. I used extra lean good quality ground beef, best available quality parmesan, and (sadly) store-bought chicken stock. I can only image how much more lovely this would have been with home made stock.

For a simplified quick version I used HALF the broth ( 6 C ) 1 head escarole, 2 carrots ( will add another next time ) and 8 Trader Joes party size meatballs cut into 4s. Next time I will maybe add 3 or 4 more. Made 3 generous servings & was excellent. Also cooked escarole much less time than stated. Carrots in broth a few minutes then escarole for maybe 10 & then pasta ( 4 ozs ditalini ) & lastly the fully cooked meatballs - all together a quick & easy but yummy meal that my Italian husband loved & wants again.

I have been searching for years for the recipe for Italian Wedding Soup, and always wondered why Epicurious didn't have a version. Well, this is it! I stumbled upon it by accident. It's just as delicious as I always hoped. I used orzo for the pasta and made a double batch. Thank goodness, because we ate almost half of it in one sitting.

Just wanted to add that I also only used 9 cups of broth or so plus 1 cup water. I think the amount of liquid is definitely flexible.

Delicious. I had celery on hand and added it to the soup. Added 3 crushed garlic cloves to the meatballs, though I think 2 would suffice. The grated parm in the meatballs lends it a fantastic cheesiness that is so satisfying. I didn't have regular breadcrumbs (nor bread) so I used panko -- it works, but is aesthetically pretty ugly. Definitely recommend regular breadcrumbs if you can. If you have a partner to cook with, one person can roll the meatballs while the other gets the soup rolling. Pretty quick that way.

Very very good. My husband loved it, and he's Italian. I added garlic to the meatballs, panko instead of breadcrumbs, more pasta than indicated, and only 10 c broth. We both like our soup thick. Would definitely make again!

What a simple soup that packs a ton of flavor! I highly recommend not only because it is delicious but because it requires simple whole ingredients. I followed the recipe to the letter; however, it seemed like the soup cooked in less time then what was instructed. Fantastic!

I made my own stock so it was a great base. I used ground turkey to make the meatballs and they were a bit dry -- but pre-frying them in the pan lent a great carmelized flavor to the whole thing. Awesome.

The smell of this cooking was amazing and when we finally sat down to eat, its taste did not disappoint. We make something similar (giouvarlakia) in Greece but we add rice to the meatball mixture and finish the dish off with an egg-lemon sauce. Most families don't add greens to their Greek version although I usually do. This soup proved to be so much lighter than our Greek version and I will now be adopting this dish too!

This was delicious! I was looking for something to make with the ground veal I found at the store, had everything in the pantry except the escarole so I put some frozen spinach in toward the end of cooking time and it was still great - hubby loved it!

I usually do not like meatballs in soup because they are too greasy, but with the following changes, I found this delicious. I substituted lean ground turkey for beef (patted dry with paper towels because it can be very moist), reduced cheese to 1/4 cup, omitted egg, added enough bread crumbs to easily make small balls. Then I sprayed a pan w/Pam and browned the meatballs on all sides before adding them to the soup. Browning adds a lot of flavor. My husband could not tell they were turkey meatballs. Very delicious soup.

I have made this recipe for years since the Sopranos served it on the show. (Sopranos Family Cookbook p. 63). Always a huge hit; serve with hard bread for dipping. This time I used home made turkey broth from Thanksgiving and it was the best yet! Teenager loves it and it is even better the second day. 4 forks and 5 stars.

just made this, it was so satisfying on a cold November afternoon. I used all beef, used a combo of my frozen turkey stock and organic fat free chicken broth from the market. Loosely followed quantities because I had over 2lbs of beef to use up,2/3rd of the meatballs ended up in the freezer, uncooked, in 3 containers of about 30 each for perhaps smaller quantities of soup. Used herb de provence in the meatballs and lots of pepper, plus a parm. rind in the soup. For 12 cups of stock I used a whole head of sliced escarole and broke up whole wheat angel hair pasta into tiny bits. It was delicious.

This soup was light, tasty, and not too difficult to make. I used lean grass-fed beef and I also added some garlic to the meatballs. Next time, I think I'll do a beef/veal mix because in soup, you really want the meatballs to be tender for biting into without a fork/knife. Overall, I thought it could use a bit more flavor, maybe some shallots? more garlic? sauteing the carrots/veggies instead of just adding them to the broth? I might change the recipe a bit next time, but I would still make it again.

Used homemade chicken stock, fresh bread crumbs, grass fed lean beef (9% fat), and microplaned one garlic clove into the meatball mix. Used romano instead of parmesan. Used a 1/2 tsp measure, pretty much level, to help keep the size of the meatballs about 1/2 inch in diameter before cooking. It was a little too salty, even though my chicken stock was pretty much salt free, though I added about a tsp. at the start to compensate for that. So next time, I would not add any salt until the very end of the recipe, if needed at that point. I think the beef and cheese impart a lot of salt that I had not accounted for, and I would probably not make this with storebought chicken stock for that reason. A little lemon juice, extra pasta, or some cannelini beans could help with the salt level if I make this again with storebought chicken stock. But basically, this is a fantastic, filling, not very unhealthy (if you use lean beef) one pot recipe, with a decent amount of texture and interest. One could go for more escarole here to increase the veggies.

Very easy and very good. Was an instant favorite with my three teens. I used onions and napa cabbage (i didnt have escarole or swiss chard), more ground beef and shirataki noodles. I will be making this again.

I used turkey instead of beef. I added a can of cannellini beans. I did not use any pasta this time but I have in the past. I also used white rice bread for bread crumbs because I am gluten sensitive. I also substituted escarole this time for broccoli rabe..YUM! Perfect for a cold fall night in October.

This recipe is sensational. I opted for my rich full bodied chicken stock but next time, I'll use my turkey stock. A rich stock is crucial to the overall success and taste of this recipe. I'll be making this time and time again.

Just made this great soup with just one slight modification: I baked the meatballs in the oven for 20 mins at 400 degrees (I'm particular about making sure my meats get very well cooked). It turned out really well and my boyfriend loved it too. Best part about it..its not much work at all.

This is one of my go-to recipes for quick weeknight dinners. It's a cinch to put together, delicious and filling, whether you make it as written or sub out various veggies, pastas, etc. I usually make the meatballs with ground turkey, or with half turkey and half beef to lighten it up a bit, and I add garlic to both the meatballs and the broth. The only tedious part is rolling the meatballs, so I'll usually make a double or triple batch to freeze, rolling the meatballs not for that evening's dinner while the meatballs and pasta cook in the broth. The frozen meatballs can be tossed frozen right into the broth without thawing the next time you make the dish. Easy!

Rating: 4
Fantastic!! Added parmesan rinds to stock and garlic and cayenne to meatballs. Have made this with both escarole and swiss chard and they are equally good. If your meatballs are falling apart, try adding an extra egg and/or using less breadcrumbs. And please, do not broil them first! The juices and fat that come out when they cook are what gives the broth flavor.

Pleased a group of 15 picky eaters over two days! Made two versions with the same pot of soup. Doubled the recipe and used home made stock....as we were having it as a first course first time around, left out the pasta for a lighter version. That was incarnation one. Made small meat balls as called for and 12 large ones for the later main course version. Also used panko instead of bread crumbs and added 6 cloves of garlic to the meatballs. After serving all the small meatballs and escarole day one, I reserved the stock and added cabbage, the large veal meatballs, 3 tblspns chili paste and soba noodles and it transformed into a great asian main course. Will make this one again and again!

This was great! I used a combination of turnip greens and baby spinach instead of escarole, added bay leaves, parsley and oregano while simmering the broth. Make sure you make the meatballs TINY! I made mine about half an inch in diameter on average and they swelled up at least 50% of their size. Also since I didn't dice the onions that small some of them busted out into the broth during the cooking process - but this added even more flavor. Overall, this recipe is great and makes a huge amount - I used 10 cups of broth.

Rating: 3
Very good! I added a little cayenne and garlic to the meatballs to give them some kick. Some other reviewers mentioned browning meatballs before putting them into the soup -- I think this is not a good idea; the meatballs cooking in the broth give it more flavor as the juices and fats are released.

Rating: 1
I wanted to like this soup. It wasn't bad, but delicate must mean flavorless. I made my own broth, and homemade bread crumbs. I used Parmigiano- Reggiano. In the end it was a lot of work for little flavor. The meatballs "has no taste, and I feel like I am eating nothing" summed up my 9 year old. I won't make this dish again, but I wish I stuck the meatballs under the broiler and browned them a bit for some flavor. Also cannellinni beans would probably have been a good addition.

Make sure to get low sodium chicken stock or sub some of the stock with water otherwise it is too salty! Otherwise - YUMM!

This is an excellent and hearty dinner soup. I am a garlic nut so I added a very large minced clove to the meatballs. If you're not a huge garlic fan I'm sure this is excellent without it. I also ran out of chicken broth and ended up using 4c chicken broth, 8c beef. I'm positive it would have been better with pure chicken broth but if you only have beef broth at your house, don't be afraid to try it out. You might want to dilute it with a little water so it isn't too strong.

my husband and i LOVED this recipe!! i had a lot of fun making it. it is a little time consuming with rolling the meatballs and rinsing each leaf of escarole but it was relaxing on a sunday afternoon when nothing pressing needed to be done. i would only change it in 2 ways - try to make even tinier meatballs (with minced garlic!) and add more pasta. i will definitely make this again. DELICIOUS!

I used a 1/2 tsp. measure to get consistently 1" meatballs. My meatballs spread a little as they cooked (sort of meat- globbish, rather than meatballs...) but the taste was very good. I used ground beef and swiss chard as that was what was available, and the fresh parmesan added the perfect finishing touch. Made 8 two-cup servings for us.

Delicious! I made the recipe using ground turkey (made the remainder into meatballs which I will freeze and use in the braised meatball dish on this site) but otherwise followed the recipe.

Love this soup and have made it several times. Meatloaf mix (veal, pork, beef combined) makes great meatballs. I love swiss chard, so instead of the escarole, I add the chard in the last 10 or 15 minutes of cooking. My old Italian grandmother loves it!

This is a great soup. I make it all the time. Sometimes I add a little Tabasco, oregano, and/or minced garlic to the meatballs to give a little kick. I also use 1 lb of turkey since that's how my store sells it; I also add more carrots and escarole than called for. I think it beefs it up a little. I usually serve it w/warm cornbread. Delicious!

I agree, this is a wonderful soup and surprisingly simple to prepare. I substituted lean (not extra lean) turkey for the other meat in the meatballs and it was delicious! Taste did not suffer at all and I didn't have any fat floating on the surface the next day as described by other reviewers.

This is a terrific soup and well worth the effort. I have made it as specified but I typically make the following changes. While you're making the meatballs, bring the stock up to heat with an onion, a couple carrots, a few ribs of celery and your fennel tops. Discard them once they've given their flavor to the broth. Most recently I made my meatballs with ground buffalo and turkey. It works quite well and reduces the fat a bit. And I usually add 'rags' to the recips. Just combine beaten eggs (4-6) with a cup of grated cheese (romano, parmigano, asiago) and season with black pepper and freshly grated nutmeg. Add this to the soup once the pasta has cooked and stir gently. You can reduce the pasta amount or eliminate it entirely if you're going to add the rags. I also used escarole plus swiss chard in my recent batch. The ruby swiss chard adds a very appealing note of color. I also add one fennel bulb chopped small. And don't substitute spinach for the escarole - my Italian grandmother may pay you an unfriendly visit!

Rating: 4
Very good soup! I have made it several times. The only changes I have made are I bake the meatballs for 20 mins first before I put into the soup and 2 I use double the escarole to give the soup more greens. Baking the meatballs takes some of the fat out and you don't even miss it! This one is a keeper!

This was a VERY satisfying delicious soup, with a complexity -- and soul-satisfying base note -- not evident from reading the simple ingredients.

A great, hearty soup on a cold night. I used mustard greens (no escarole to be found), and they turned out fine. I didn't let them cook for 30 min, only about 15. I also used acini de pepe, per the suggestion of other users. For the meatballs, I used a mix of ground veal, pork & chuck. The next morning, I expected to find a large layer of fat to take off. There was barely any (and I had doubled the meatballs) - it seems to have been very lean.

It could be because I'm really hungry, but I think this soup is great. I couldn't find escarole, so I used mustard greens and cabbage instead. I also used ground beef, store bought chicken broth, and small shells. It's very satisfying, probably even without the meatballs.

It was good but not the old Italian dish called Italian Wedding Soup that the Sopranos would have recognized.

Rating: 3
This soup was easy to put together (after making the broth a day ahead) and very tasty. Escarole holds its texture and so is a better choice than spinach. I cooked it two ways, cooking the meatballs in the broth and frying them separately (as some reviewers suggested). I thought the boiled version was better - and one less pan to clean up! I increased the amount of meatballs and enjoyed them, but was shocked the next day when I saw how much fat was on the surface. I might make this ahead and skim the fat off the surface. Also, acini di pepe is a more authentic pasta in this soup.

Rating: 4
This is really called Italian Wedding Soup. I replaced escarole, which has a sharp taste with spinach which is a softer taste. Also the soup that I have had, had Acini Di Pepe pasta which I used to replace ditalini. I chopped carrots small. This is a delicate soup but robust in flavor. Asiago cheese works well with the Parm.

I was looking for a good meatball recipe and although I didn't make the soup, my husband loved them (as did our four year old, but I made his without the onions). I browned them in olive oil and then added enough water to deglaze the pan and braise them until they were done. My husband said that they were "probably the best meatballs I've ever tasted." He didn't dig the soup idea, but I thought at least I'd pass along the praise for the meatball part of this dish.

Very tasty soup. Used a mix of veal, pork and beef for the meatballs. Based on the other "Escarole and Orzo Soup" recipe, I added chopped parsley to the mixture and pan fried the small meatballs. Used both escarole and spinach but either/or would be fine. Also used acini de pepe instead of orzo.The broth is lovely. Have some fresh bread on hand and enjoy.
