I only made the burgers and I thought they had great flavor. I definitely increased the cumin, paprika, and garlic. I thought the burgers were a little too salty so I would consider decreasing that next time. The kids loved them...ate them plain, no bun even. Maybe good with standard tzatziki sauce?

One of the best burgers I have had in a long time. Made as written except that I doubled the cumin and paprika as I always like more spices than written. Added cheddar to the buns as well. A huge hit!

I made this recipe the other night for dinner and my family flipped for the salsa and burger combo. We made it with turkey and on ciabatta rolls and it was still really delicious. The strong onion flavor in the salsa is really well offset by the sweetness of the honey and oranges that go in the salsa as well.

I made exactly as described but cooked the burgers on a stovetop cast iron grill pan. Loved the way the spices, jalapeno and cilantro enhanced the flavor of the meat, and the salsa was unusual and delicious.

A winner! I used basil in lieu of cilantro and added a bit of cinnamon per another reviewer's suggestion. Doubled the olives for the salsa and added some radish for more crunch. Served over quinoa with some feta & basil raita on top. Will try it as a kebab next time.

This is fantastic. I think it makes a big difference to be using lamb instead of beef, since it has more flavor and stands up better to the salsa, which was strange but delicious. I chopped the olives into fairly small pieces, since it was the only salty component in the salsa, and I was happy with the result. I added half a tsp of cinnamon to the burger meat as well as a bit of basil and mint (our garden herbs needed using), and will do the same the next time I make this.

This recipe combo was excellent! The jalapeno and cilantro really stepped things up for the lamb, and the salsa was outstanding, though we ate it more as a salad, since the burgers were on the larger side. My wife made some sweet potato wedges to go with this, that was the *perfect* compliment to the salsa. Definitely will make this again, since we get ground lamb a couple of times a month. Only thing I might change would be to add a little less red onion. Cheers!

The salsa tasted strange and was not worth the effort but the meat was very good.

WOW. Crazy good. My company loved it and wanted the recipe. The beets made the salsa!

Just not enough taste for us. followed the recipe exactly. The salsa was nice but the burgers were ordinary.

Very easy to make and perfect for a lunch with guests over. Couldn't find ground lamb in the supermarket so made some burgers with beef and others with ground chicken. The seasoning and salsa worked wonderfully with both. Also tried it with multigrain flat bread in addition to burger buns with great results. Will definitely make it again.

A lamb fan by no means, the flavor in this burger is out of this world. I thoroughly enjoyed the salsa even though I don't eat beets. Having said all that, I will definitely make this again, and be certain to have company involved. They will think I'm magic! In other words - if you want to eat things you normally wouldn't, go with this recipe. It's outstanding.

I come back to this great recipe again and again, it's so delicious and always gets rave notices from the lucky people invited to enjoy it. Don't skip the salsa, the flavors work so well with this terrific burger.

I substituted mint for cilantro, left out the jalapeno, then grilled ahaheim chilli peppers on top of the burger, with garlic yogurt on top of that. Serve on a really great bun. Doesn't get any better! May decide to try the salsa another time.

Absolutely wonderful. I was looking for new uses for our garden beets, and this exceeded expectations. I roasted the beets, and added bleu cheese to top of the burgers. Making it a second week in a row.

Ummm...Not sure what everyone else is so excited about. The actual lamb portion is great. The "salsa" is rather bland and the beets make the whole mixture an unappetizing red color. The olives turn purple and everything else is red. I will make the burgers all the time but not the salsa, I will dress with other ingredients.

Wow -- What a great tasting burger!! I made this last summer using beef instead of lamb and it was OK but not great. I made it again a few days ago using lamb (followed recipe exactly) and it was delicious. My guests, my husband and I had a great, if messy, meal but everyone agreed that it was worth the mess. Served it on Kaiser buns with root chips on the side. Perfect. Had some of the beet relish left over so I made them again the next night. Recommend it to everyone who enjoys a nice balance of flavors (strong flavors). Keeper.

Hands down...best burger I've ever had. The salsa & mayo make it!

This is so good, and has really unusual, refreshing and interesting combinations of flavors-- I would love to make it for company. But I can't; it's too messy. My son looked like an axe murderer, with beet juice running down his arms to his elbows. I have to go put my pants in the washing machine quick and hope the stains come out. I think my problem was i got tired/lazy and didn't chop the beet salsa finely enough to stay on the hamburger. But I don't know if anything would have kept pieces from falling into my lap. It was fabulous, though. Maybe I'll serve it to company if they come in their bathing suits and I hose them off afterwards. It would be worth it.

On eo f the best burgers I have ever had that wasn't beef. I highly recommend this burger.

The burger and salsa are so flavorful and delicious. The recipe requires a fair amount of chopping, but it was pretty easy to execute and well worth the effort. I added a bit of feta cheese on top and I used pickled beets instead of fresh, and it all worked well. I'll definitely make this again!

I made these for Easter and for my final project in a cooking class and oh my gosh! One of the most flavorful burgers I've ever eaten. If you don't think you like lamb, make these burgers and prove yourself wrong. My cooking teacher asked for the recipe.

I made these burgers for some friends and they were absolutely fantastic. Everyone loved them. How can you not? The salsa is great too. Just follow the recipe exactly, even use the mayonnaise, and you will be so happy tonight.

We are big fans of Lamb so this was right up our alley. The salsa was wonderful I sprinkled some Feta cheese over the salsa and burgers and it really added a little zip. I will be making this again soon.

Outstanding, but a lot going on. Will skip the salsa next time. Both the burgers and slasa are great on their own. Try the salsa over lettuce and make a salad.

Makes my head spin! I love this burger. Try serving with a chilled sparkling red shiraz. Fantastic.

This was just fabulous! I used chopmeat instead of lamb and omitted the beets and mayo. The flavors go so well together. I have cooked this twice in 1 week, and the family is ready for more!!

This was a great recipe! I ground some leg of lamb meat, and left a little of the fat in to keep it moist, and I used jalepaneo stuffed olives instead of green olives and fresh jalepaneo. Delicious! The salsa was wonderful with it, and I went without the mayo. Yummy! We had freinds over for dinner and they enjoyed it also.
