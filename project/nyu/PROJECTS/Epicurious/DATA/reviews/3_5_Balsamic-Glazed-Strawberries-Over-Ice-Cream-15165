This is a fun recipe which I have made many times...it is originally given to me but after the strawberry mix is poured over the ice cream a twist of a black pepper mill adds a nice surprise. Try it! Helen

Fabulous - was loved by picky eaters which was a total surprise to me.

this was delicious and my family (who is always skeptical about vinegar, especially given my love affair with it) agreed, surprisingly! the vinegar glaze loses the vinegar-y quality, so even if you as well are skeptical, you should give it a try.

This was great. I simmered longer than 1 minute after the suace came to a biol. The thicker sauce I believe is better then the thin suace. This was a great with a Malvasia Bianca from Sterling vineyards. It made the strawbwrrys and vinger sweater.

This was delicious. But can you maket this for someone who won't eat white sugar (assuming you substitute sugar-free ice cream? What kind of sugar content is in balsamic vinegar anyway?

Incredibly complex pairing of flavors...absolutely sublime. Do not change a thing!

I have been making a variation of this for years, very easy but needs more time simmering to mellow the flavors. Try adding the fresh strawberries earlier to combine flavors. Serve w/ biscotti or almond cake and a grind of black pepper on top. Yummm.

I followed the advice of simmering the sugar and vinegar longer but it still was too strong. I did not find it to be a good combination.

I agree with the cook from Cape Cod - this is perfect, don't change anything. Thinking about mixing balsamic and vinegar with ice cream sounded rather unappetizing, but once you taste it - yummy! Use good quality ingredients for everything you cook, and the results will always be better.

Yummy. The first time i made this I didn't let the vinegar and sugar simmer long enough so it tasted too strong. The second time around I let it simmer a little longer and then it was perfect. Everyone raved about. Really easy dessert and makes for interesting conversation.

I really wanted to like this recipe. I made it the other night to take to my parent's house to have after Sunday dinner. Luckily, I took along some plain strawberries because this just did not go over well. I found the flavour okay, but there was just too much bite with the vinegar. I have to wonder if a better quality vinegar would make the difference. Also, I think if I ever did try making this again, I would add some honey to try and mellow out the vinegar.

Interesting. I love different combinations. I also make a salad with strawberries and balsamic. It is delicious. The vinegar seems a little strange with the ice cream. I like the one cook's idea letting the berries soak in the sauce for awhile. I will try that. I think the vinegar would then taste more strawberry-like.

Don't change a thing. This is the perfect summer dessert.

At the end of a meal, nothing can beat a dish that is both super simple and utterly edible. This is such a dish. Anyone who doesn't appreciate this has no business trying to cook or serve a meal to anyone.

I love this. The vinegar enhances the strawberries. I have tried lately with raspberry balsamic vinegar and it is better than plain.

I've made this many times fo diner parties and it's always been a big hit. And it's easy to make, which is nice if you're tired after cooking an elaborate meal.

Try it! I was a little skeptical to try balsamic and berries, but after reading the reviews of recipes in epicurious I just had to. They were awesome! They didn't smell great when I first mixed it up (the vinegar was overpowering) but I let them 'marinate' for about half an hour, and WOW. Served them over custard filled meringues as I don't like ice cream. Big hit~and a neat conservation topic.

I have been making this terrific summer dessert since it appeared two years ago. People rave about it but don't tell them that it is made with vinegar!
