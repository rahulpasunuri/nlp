I made this with egg whites only and revised the stuffing (just goat cheese, lemon zest, a touch of cinnamon and agave). This was delicious, and a huge hit with my boyfriend and his friends! Epicurious never steers me wrong ;-)

To A Cook from Santa Monica the recipe actually says to use eggs or egg substitute (you can find vegan egg substitute) and to use butter or butter substitute i.e. margarine. You shouldn't give a recipe negative folks because someone at epicurious put it in a category you don't agree with. The fork rating is used for how good a recipe is. And you can write note without leaving forks and affecting a recipe. I'm hoping to try this recipe this weekend.

not a vegan dish. (calls for eggs and butter) Please revise.
