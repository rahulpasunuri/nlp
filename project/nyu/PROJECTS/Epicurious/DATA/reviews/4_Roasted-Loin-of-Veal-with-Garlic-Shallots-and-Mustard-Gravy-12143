Excellent recipe. Do not roast to 150. Try 145 to ensure tender result (meat will come up to temperature while resting). Substituting rosemary for tarragon is a good alternative for those who don't appreciate the flavor. I added reconsittuted wild mushrooms to the gravy for excellent backdrop.

I try never to buy cruelty food, and I consider veal to be at the top of the no-no list. However, the farm that I get my meat from only had veal last week, and since the calves are raised with their mothers and never put through the torture that auction-house veal is, I decided to give it a try. Since I'd never had veal before I had no idea what to do with it, and I found this recipe. I'm glad I did - it was delicious. The only modifications I made were that I used bacon instead of fatback, and I added about a half cup of raw heavy cream at the end. It was tender and exceedingly flavorful. If I ever have to buy veal again, I would definitely make it like this. Restaurant-quality recipe, imho.

So delicious! My local butchery does not carry veal loin so I used a veal chuck roast(and apple juice in place of the wine). My whole family loved this recipe.

This turned out better than expected. No fresh tarragon available this time of year here so I used Tarragon Dijon mustard on the veal, covered it with bacon and used dried tarragon in the sauce. Also added fingerling potatoes to pan roasting pan with the veal, shallots and garlic. Yummy! A definate keeper.

"You buy the meat and I'll figure out what do do with it." When he brought home a veal roast, I was stumped! This recipe is succulent and layered with flavor. I couldn't find "fatback", so the butcher thinly sliced salt pork for me. This is a very special dish and exceeded holiday standards.

This dish was fabulous. It really does take 1 1/2 hours to cook but well worth the wait. I also substituted rosemary and bacon. Would definitely make again.

Have made this several times with great results. I also substituted bacon for fatback. Didn't have tarragon the first time so I substituted fresh rosemary, which was so good, I've used it every time since. Used a coarse grain dijon. Since I wanted to incorporate the bacon, after it was removed from the roast, I trimmed the fat, crisped it in a skillet and crumbled it. Added the pan juices (unfiltered) and a little white wine, mustard, salt & pepper to taste. Gave a more rustic, country presentation and was terrific.

This was excellent. I added sauteed mushrooms to the sauce and thickened the sauce. Used bacon instead of fatback. Cut the shallots in half.
