This is just what a palette refresher should be -- bright and vibrantly flavorful. I doubled the recipe and added 1/2 cup of orange flavored vodka, hoping to keep it from getting too hard. Next time I might up the vodka a bit more. Serve in chilled glasses with a sprig of mint. Excellent!

A friend swore last night this is the best thing she has tasted, ever. I use about a half cup less grapefruit juice, but add a dash of pernod before freezing, which really does wonders to the flavor if you're an anise fan.

LOVED IT!!! This cold, tart, dessert is amazingly refreshing! We ate it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. It goes with everything; and its guilt-free! Its easy to make, and the pink color gives it an elegant, exotic look. I will definitly make this for my next dinner guests.
