I'm not sure what the deal was with my result. I used "Maseca instant corn masa flour" and my dough was pretty wet. I added another 1/4 cup to make it more manageable but it was still pretty sticky. Tried making one in a skillet with butter to see if it was worth attempting on the grill. Brown on the outside, but doughy on the inside - or cheesy? I don't know... Not sure if this is how they are supposed to be or not. I saw them being sold at a street market in NYC. Wish I'd tried them there so I'd have a reference point.

This was so easy and delicious! I'll try it with water instead of the broth next time - I think I might like it even better with a purer corn taste.

The corn used in traditional Latin American dishes is not the very sweet corn hybrids typically eaten in the USA and Canada. It is a tough and starchy corn with little sugar content. That makes it ideal for use as a flour like product, such as for making tortillas, arepas etc. Some of you may know it as feed corn or cow corn as it is more commonly used as such anywhere north of Mexico. In my opinion, that is a tremendous loss for the north as the starchy corns offer all kinds of creativity in cooking, not the least of which is as a replacement for wheat flour. As the writer says, this is a very basic recipe. You can be as creative with this recipe as you are with crepes, latkas, pirogies, fritters or any starch based dished (muffins even?). Just be wary of the calories.

FYI, there's a special kind of cornmeal called masarepa. I found Goya brand in my supermarket, but I've heard that some have a hard time finding it. THAT'S the traditional arepa cornmeal (probably pre-cooked/akin to instant).

@ A Cook: One of two things happened; either your stock was not hot enough or you did not use INSTANT cornmeal. I look forward to trying this recipe. After reading the comments, I will cutdown on the sugar and add a pinch of salt.

I have travel to the areas of the world that Arepas. A lack of salt is prevalent. I find that the North American palette prefers some salt and the better Arepa recipes also include a little baking powder for a less dense. It works as I have made them many times with mt friend from Bolivia. The addition of corn kernels and chicken stock are a nice touch in this recipe, but the salt and baking powder do also help and make this recipe a KEEPER.

What did I do wrong? I made these and they ended up soupy and awful! I tried baking them and they turned into hard corn discs? How did I fail this?

These were excellent for how easy they are to make... I'd agree that they are a bit sweet, but I liked them that way. Also could be because I used sweet corn. I don't have a grill, so I just made them in a pan with a little butter. They turned out great. I'm making them again tonight... the only thing I may change is to up the amount of manchego I use...

I made this recipe last night. It was very easy and quick. The only thing I could have done without was the sugar. The arepas turned out very sweet. Next time I ame this, I'll skip the sugar. I top them with lettuce, a bit of cream and the farmer's cheese.
