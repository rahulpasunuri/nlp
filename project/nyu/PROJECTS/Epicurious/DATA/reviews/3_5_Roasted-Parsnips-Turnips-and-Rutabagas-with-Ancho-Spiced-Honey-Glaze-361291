I loved this. Easy healthy. Used half the honey and olive oil instead of butter.

A nice spicy/sweet touch for fall vegetables. I threw in various other late Fall vegetables, including baby brussel sprouts, and it was good with them all. I had rutabaga, parsnips, carrots and celeriac from the farmers market and put them in 20 mins before I added the halved baby brussel sprouts, which caramelized nicely. Not that sweet. Used chipotle instead of ancho as I couldn't find my ancho. Must organize spice cupboard one day....

The glaze was very unremarkable. I would not even bother unless you are one of those people who absolutely cannot choke down a few vegetables without some sticky sweet syrup to make you forget what you are actually eating. Skip it and enjoy the tastes of all those interesting vegetables. Skip the glaze and save yourself the time, calories, and hassle. I didn't use parchment paper (didn't have any around) and just cooked them on the cookie sheet. This reduced cooking time (keep your eye on the veggies as I don't think they need 50 minutes) and was one less element in the mix. The butter and oil mostly burned off or was absorbed - but the veggies were not greasy.

Made without rutabaga, but otherwise as written. Was delicious! Will cut out some more butter next time, it's not necessary at all.

Very good - a nice blend of spice and sweet. Am going to try them again this Christmas with the addition of acorn squash.

I love this recipe and have already made it several times. I look forward to root veggies all year and I've found a way to get my boyfriend to eat them too! To cut out some butter, I just mixed the veggies with some olive oil and then roasted until almost done. I would also recommend cutting the parsnips just a little bigger than instructed here; they tend to dry up easily. Overall, this is a great, easy and delicious side dish!

As I look to incorporate more seasonal vegetables into my fall and winter meals, I tried this one. The boys all turned up their noses at the rutabaga, but my DH and I enjoyed it. I will continue to work with these veggies to make them more palatable to the boys.
