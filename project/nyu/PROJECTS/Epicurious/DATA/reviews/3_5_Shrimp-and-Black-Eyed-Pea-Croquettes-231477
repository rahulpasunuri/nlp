To the cook from Phily: I think they want you to keep them warm in the 250 degree oven. Read the last paragraph of the recipe.

I am certain this is going to be wonderful, but am I missing something? The oven is set to 250 but nowhere does it say to place the tray in the oven and for how long? Assuming this is prior to the frying section. Please help!

If you come to Brazil, you won't find this croquette (although there are plenty of variations). Though, it is an accurate and interesting interpretation of Brazilian cookery, making use of acaraje - the black eyed pea fritters of African heritage, typical spices and a breadcrumb coating - very brazilian and perfect to accompany your caipirinha.
