This is my ABSOLUTE favorite! What a find! I must admit that I use heat smoked salmon for the recipe and it is still wonderful! My husband lights up like Christmas when he comes into breakfast to find this waiting! Delicious and easy to make. Most things I have on hand at one time or another but when they are all in the fridge together this is the recipe to make! I don't use frozen hash browns anymore, but whatever potatoes I have on hand. I usually cut them up and give them a turn in the microwave. You should really use cooked potatoes for this.

Oh, this is now a family standard with many variations; fresh potatoes and left over salmon; dill added sometimes if in the garden..but always lots of capers!

Have made several times as written and everyone LOVES it. Originally a way to use up ingredients on hand, now we buy the ingredients specifically to make this dish. Big hit with adults and kids alike.

I thought that this was so salty that it was almost inedible

This was a very nice dish. My husband and I enjoyed it very much. I did add a clove of garlic and 1/4 cup chop green pepper. I sauteed those with the onion for about 2 minutes, then added the potatoes to the skillet. Then I followed the rest of the recipe as is. It was nice and I served it with scrambled eggs on the side. Very easy and tasty.

Very tasty; this will become a standard item in my breakfast/brunch repertoire. I was cooking for 8 and varied the recipe somewhat - cubed (1/2") and roasted small red potatoes tossed with olive oil and S&P, then added the sour cream mixture to my roasting pan at the end. I used 1# salmon, about 3# of potatoes and doubled the other ingredient amounts. I also caramelized one diced red onion and added this to the sour cream mixture. Served with scrambled eggs.

I was in Portland last weekend and had this at the Heathman with poached eggs. It was good but I found the taste overpowering as it was not served with anything else. As part of a buffet or meal this would be good, but not as a stand alone dish.

Oh my gosh! I made this for Sunday brunch on Father's day, and what a hit it turned out to be. It was delicious. It pairs well with Mimosa's too!!

I was looking for a use for leftover salmon from our barbecue yesterday, and this was exceptional. Something else to use leftovers on besides a salad! A hit at our house.

Made this dish (modified) for Mother's Day brunch and it was a big hit in our family. I did make it with the following modifications and it was still very good: 2 T. oil instead of 2 T. butter + 1 T. oil; 1/2 package frozen Ore-Ida shredded hash browns (approx 3/4 lb total I would estimate); 3 Tbsp plain fat-free yogurt instead of sour cream; wasabi instead of horseradish; 2 T. capers instead of 3 T.; 4 oz Scottish smoked salmon (because I couldn't find a bigger package!). Also, did not serve with poached eggs on top, but instead served it alongside omelettes and waffles. Using shredded hash browns brought down the cooking time significantly (looking at other cooks' notes) and we liked that texture. Despite these changes, the dish was still delicious! I would definitely make this again.

Delicious, but with some minor changes. Used 1 pound Russets, cubed, parboiled 6 minutes, then well-browned in cast-iron skillet with the fat. Used 2 TBS capers. Used 2 TBS sour cream. (Was afraid to drown out the smoked salmon taste). Topped w/ chopped parsley. Well received by the family. Thanks!

I have served this recipe for brunch to company many times, and it always gets rave reviews. I usually serve it with scrambled eggs and a watercress salad with a dijon vinaigrette. It looks quite elegant. I think the amount of capers works just fine....nice and tangy.

my friends and family always ask me to make this dish. it's perfect for a winter sunday brunch. i use smoked salmon from the pacific northwest instead of lox and i use fresh potatoes instead of frozen. i have also served this with a salad for an informal dinner and received rave reviews.

This is a great weeknight meal and a great way to use smoked salmon.

I have made this dish many times over--usually as a quick hearty supper for two. I cut the potatoes down by one third and always serve it with eggs.

I love this dish and have made it several times. It certainly won't serve four on its own. I would recommend increasing the recipe by 1/2 or planning other dishes to go with it. It has become my standby for a brunch centerpiece and is always enjoyed by all.

I made this dish for my morning bridge group. All eight of us were NEUTRAL about the recipe. I wouldn't rush to make it again. I felt it needed more salmon for all those potatoes.

I make this hash on a regular basis -- usually without the eggs. It's wonderful! But it definitely takes longer than 12 minutes to finish browning the potatoes.

This is a great recipe! We had it at a friends brunch and decided to make it for the family Christmas. It was certainly a hit. A great treat for a romantic weekend breakfast too.

This recipe is wonderful with or without the eggs. I like to use hot-smoked salmon from my favorite vendor, Charlie's Smokehouse in Gill's Rock, Door County, Wisconsin; it gives an intense flavor that reminds me of sitting around the campfire. Cold-smoked salmon is great too, with a more subtle flavor.

My husband is a huge smoked salmon fan and I made this for his birthday along with fried eggs and toast. Two thumbs up! The horseradish gives it just enough zing and the overall flavor is wonderful. The potatoes did take a little longer than 12 minutes to brown, so you may need to adjust the timing.

Made this for Christmas Day brunch and it was a hit...even with those that are pickier eaters! So you may want to double the recipe!

Delicious, and easy. But make sure to use a non-stick pan, and maybe cook the potatoes for longer than they say. I had a problem with the potatoes not really seeming completely cooked, and not browning.

This is easy to make and delicious. I would, however, question the "Serves 4" since its a bit light to serve four - it served two hungry adults well but definately would not have served 4.

excellent and easy, explodes with flavors, when I make it again I will use 1/2 as many capers
