Always fantastic! I highly recommend it! It has become a family classic, everyone enjoys them throughly, they are always surprised at the moistness and lightness of the cupcake itself.

These cupcakes are amazing! They are very moist and flavorful....I love the rosewater in the frosting.....but I also added a pinch in the batter! The frosting isn't too sweet and it isn't heavy. The frosting makes the cupcake....a recipe that I will make over and over again. Big hit for a picnic =)

I'm a bit aprehensive about my baking abilities so I had one of these as soon as they came out of the oven. Even without frosting they are spectacular. I made them with 2% milk and found them to be lovely and moist.

I am very excited to make them for my grandmother's 65th BD.But, alot of the reviewers said that they didn't like the frosting so I will add some lemon juice and zest for some added flavour.

i agree with comments from earlier reviewers - probably too much sugar (a carmalized-like top resulted) and a bit on the heavy side. i like moist as many reviewers noted these are (which is why i decided to go ahead and try them), but the heaviness detracted. will try other recipies before i do this again...

Loved these CUPCAKES--Made a batch of these moist delicious cupcakes yesterday...just the cupcakes not the frosting, since I had some left over cream cheese frosting from the awesome Butterfinger Peanut Butter Cake I made from here! The actual cupcake is great...very fluffy but rich without being heavy. It is excellent with the cream cheese frosting! The recipe claims to only make 16 cupcakes I made about 20 overflowing ones...Any tips on the best cupcake/muffin tins out there?

These were OK, not great. The batter tasted amazing, but the cupcakes themselves were very heavy. I used regular buttercream icing as was making for a child's birthday party. Just so-so.

I have made these cupcakes several times. I am not a frosting fan so I have cut it down by a lot. I have increased the amount of rosewater and decreased the the cream cheese by half. Just to be creative I have also mixed some of the frusting with food coloring and piped some small flowers on top of thin white layer of frosting. I do agree that the cupcakes tend to be a bit too sweet. I solved that problem by adding less sugar and they are really great! I love this recipe. I had never made cupcakes before this one and they are a winner. Everyone who has had them loves them!

I made them twice in the past. For St. Patrick's Day, I added some green food color to the frosting, and they were big hit. Then, I made 96 of them for my son's pre-school. Some kids did not like the heavy frosting, but most of them ate their's up, and all teachers liked them. I do like the cupcake part, but I will search for a lighter frosting. The fosting is a bit too heavy and cheesy.

I made these for my son's preschool class (minus the flowers or berries) and am seriously wondering why anyone liked this recipe. The tops are crunchy, as though the recipe calls for too much sugar, and they are dense without being very moist, yet they are greasy. The flavor is rather eggy and the frosting thick and mucousy. That said, my three year old loves them, but he also loves Honeycombs. I doubt I'll make these again; if I do, I'll reduce the sugar, increase the milk, and choose another frosting.

Surprisingly good, considering how easy these were. I'm very happy to find a good yellow cupcake recipe that doesn't call for buttermilk. I knew these were going to be good when I tasted the batter - my husband wouldn't get away from the bowl! I made these cupcakes with the chocolate cream cheese and lemon cream cheese frostings recipe (this site) and they were all turned out very well.

Light and fluffy moist crumb, and a yummy delicate taste to these cupcakes. This is now my favourite recipe! The frosting is kind of heavy, though, I won't make that again.

i found these cupcakes to be a great basic receipe - the one thing i did different was that i had skim milk and half and half so i mixed the 2 to make the 1/4 cup of "whole milk" - i think this made them moister. i didn't use the icing cause i had some deep chocolate icing left in the freezer and it was enough for all the cupcakes. i will use this as my new basic receipe for cupcakes...and will probably keep the 1/8 half and half and 1/8 skim milk. i have added to 4 forks because i made these for a gathering with kids - they just LOVED these cupcakes! and i added some festive jimmies and sugar sparkles for memorial day - WHAT A HIT! they passed up homemade ice cream for these - so...the new 4 forks rating!

Oh, and I knocked down the temp to 325 by accident...seemed to work perfectly

These were delicious and absolutely beautiful. I made them for an afternoon tea party and got rave reviews. Taking past reviewers' comments seriously on the tendency towards dryness for these cakes, I added 1/2 cup buttermilk to the batter. Because I was baking in a convection oven, I checked the cakes every 7 minutes; they were done perfectly in 15 minutes. They were dense but had a nice moist crumb. The frosting was delicious; I deleted the lemon juice since I found the light cream cheese I used had a nice tang to it already but did add just a few drops of vanilla. Again, the presentation with the fresh flowers and blackberries was just spectacular. I will makes these again and again.

These are great! I decreased the sugar to just a smidgen more than 1C and made a frosting with more (much more) fresh squeezed lemon juice and about 2 1/2C confect. sugar...the frosting is then sweet enough that you can afford to lessen the sweetness of the cake portion.

This recipe tastes like a combination of pound cake and airy cheesecake. The cake is dense and rich and prone to dryness. I'd recommend a light touch on the lemon juice in the frosting, tasting as you go - a few drops add a lot of extra flavor and tartness - something to consider if you are making these for little kids. Have some extra powdered sugar and milk on hand to adjust the flavor and texture to your liking. Remember to refrigerate the frosted supcakes if you won't be eating them right away.

Recipe is good for a quick dessert(without the flowers). Be careful not to overcook, even the slightest bit, or the cupcakes are on the dry side.
