Why do people pan recipes just for being "too long?" Some of us DO take the time to look for special recipes to cook for our loved ones--and yes, I'm a full time professional, mom, wife and STILL like to cook scrumptious dishes for friends and family! This is really terrific, not that expensive and good enough to serve to "fancy" company. I also garnished the platter with nasturtiums(edible) --beautiful presentation. If I wanted "quick" recipes I'd go to one of those sites where a recipe for spaghetti includes a jar of ready made pasta sauce and hamburger.

This was time consuming, but well worth the effort. I feel that it is was unfair for Wild Oats to give this recipe such a low rating, when that person did not bother to actually prepare the dish!

I made the stuffed onions from this recipe as a side-dish at a dinner party last week and they are incredible. I left out the pork fat (ew!) and increased the number of pine nuts. But be careful to cook them on a very low heat or they will dry out.

This was delicious! I made it for some friends, and we devoured it. I only made the chicken and the tomatoes, as my hubby doesn't like onions. It was time consuming, but we used tomatoes fresh from our garden, and they were so good, it was worth it. (I had previously made the tomato confit with homegrown tomatoes, so that shortened it a little.) I also cut the amount of butter for the chicken herb mixture in half, and even that much fat was plenty enough to make the grill smoky while spit roasting. The result was great. As far as not being quick and easy enough for todays busy couples, I'm a mother of two young children, a full time graduate student, and I work part time. (I made this on the weekend, obviously!) That's the trouble with "today's busy couples," they don't ever slow down enough to enjoy the simple pleasures of life. Food like this is meant to be savored, not inhaled while driving to soccer and talking on the cell phone...

This recipe was time consuming but excellent. I shortened it considerably by buying whole canned tomatoes. I also saved a bit of the jus and made a delicious gravy for the potatoes. Aside from placing the herbs UNDER the skin, by far the best idea in this recipe is deglazing the pan when the bird is 3/4 cooked. (How many of us rush the sauce for fear the bird will cool?) That said, I think these celebrity chefs deliberately change their recipes or print ones so time-consuming that people decide to go to their restaurants instead.

While I agree that this recipe would be time consuming, this website is intended to accommodate all kinds of recipes and all types of cooks. With the variety of cuisines and techniques available to us, it would be a pity if Epicurious confined itself to offering 20-minute entrees for today's busy couples. And, someday I hope to have the opportunity to prepare this dish.

This recipe is too long and complicated for today's fast paced couples.
