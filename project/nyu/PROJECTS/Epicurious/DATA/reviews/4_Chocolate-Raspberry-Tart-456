I have also been making this since the recipe came out in 1995. always gets rave reviews. I lost my copy and was glad to find it still here! To the reviewers who thought it bitter- perhaps you used unsweetened chocolate instead of bittersweet? The chocolate crust and filling together are indeed decadent, but I like the combo better than using a plain or graham crust. Today I made as mini-tartlets. I pressed dough in greased mini muffin tin, froze 10 mins., baked 6 minutes, using foil and pie weights. Not sure if that is really necessary but I own pie weights, so what the heck. Took off the foil and weights, poked with a toothpick a few times and baked for another 5-6 minutes. Then brushed with jam and baked for 2-3 minutes. Filled as directed. Nice part was not having to worry about it sticking in the fluted tart pan I usually use. So easy to make ahead, too.

I have been making this tart since the recipe was published. It is always a hit. After spreading the ganache over the jam I press the raspberries into the soft ganache so they stay put. Also, for ease of removing the tart from the pan I make foil strips that I place under the pan bottom (press the foil into the sides of the pan)in about 3 places. This makes it easy to remove the tart. Don't bother dusting with the cocoa powder and powdered sugar - it doesn't add tot he tart at all.

This recipe was very good and even people who dont even like sweets in my family said it was very good. I actually used straawberries on top because they were much cheaper right now but kept the raspberry jam and it was still very good. The recipe for the gauche is wonderful!

This is the best recipe I've ever tried on the website. The combination of fresh raspberries with the raspberry jam was amazing. We also left out the dusting of sugar and cocoa powder and served with lightly sweetened whipped cream on the side.

Hola. I am just a teenager who has no cooking skills whatsoever, but I managed to make this tart all by myself without any troubles. Also, it was even more difficult because I was making this for my french class. This meant I had to make a video in French while cooking. Despite all that, the finished result was an amazing dish that all my class mates enjoyed, along with my parents. Since it had so much success, I am making one for our Thanksgiving Dinner tonight.

Great - loved it! Definitely worth the effort when you want a fancy dessert. I doubled the recipe and used a round tart pan.

This is an absolute favorite at our house. The crust is always a little tricky for me and tends to break apart and burn at the edges. Despite that though, it's always a hit.

I just made this last night for a dinner party, using some of the last raspberries of the season. We were all very disappointed. It was not really very flavorful; really kind of boring. We had both chocolate-lovers and berry people there, but none were satisfied. Would not make it again.

The ganache was too bitter.

Used raspberries from the garden and didn't top with sugar. It was still slightly too sweet. Served this at a large gathering and it was gone in 5 minutes. It's a definite repeater.

This is a great recipe! It is just the right sweetness, not too sweet and very rich. I suggest not using the powdered sugar and cocoa at the end though, they make the tart just look like a mud pie! Rather, just leave the berries alone, or glaze with a clear jam.

I made this as individual tarts, and cannot report on the crust since I just made a basic tart crust. But the filling was incredible, the ganache very smooth and not too sweet, wonderful with the raspberries. Very easy as well. Guests actually moaned while eating these.

The chocolate tart filling was truly superb, but the crust leaves much to be desired - rather hard and tasteless. I suggest substituting a none egg based, sweet crust recipe. There are plenty of them on this site to choose from.

My guests and I adored this simple to make tart. Having right-off-the-vine berries, I skipped the dusting and never missed it. This tart is scheduled to reappear at two future dinner parties. 01/25/02 - Two and a half years later, people still remember this tart. Ease of prep, flavor and presentation are all excellent.

This was so easy - I thought it would take forever, but it didn't. And the ganache is so creamy and rich, perfect with fresh raspberries - don't leave out the final touch of the cocoa and powdered sugar. It is also fantastic because you can make it ahead, and add the raspberries just before - great if you don't want to have last-minute fussing about.

made this in a regulaar 10" tart pan,used the food processor for the crust because i was short of timeand I had to add 2 T water which probably made it less rich.It was cookie-like and fine.It received raves and I will certainly make it again

Fabulous and Easy! I was testing this recipe for mass producing for a church social, so I cut the raspberries back to 1/2 pint. I added some piped whipped cream garnish. It was a major success and provided plenty of raspberry flavor at a fraction of the cost. I'm making it again this weekend for a shower.
