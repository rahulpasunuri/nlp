Intense and lovely flavors, a family favorite. I've used canned, diced tomatoes (drained) in a pinch in mid-winter and had good results, too. It takes time to get the tomatoes roasted right, so don't rush it. Mixing in some fresh basil won't hurt a bit, if you like.

My spouse really liked this. I thought it was pretty good. I substituted Tabasco for pepper flakes because of the vinegar. I think I will add a little vinegar next time to brighten it up. It definitely makes enough sauce for a full pound of pasta.

The sweet, caramelized flavor of the roasted tomatoes was delicious. I used pine nuts in lieu of almonds and 1/2 lb. fettucine instead of 1 lb. perciatelli. It was just enough for my husband and I, so if I were making it for four people, I'd probably double the sauce.

Heed the warning about burning the almonds, below! This was so good, I made it again within the month. A really nice change from the usual pesto. I used linguine. Well received by the entire household.

I made the recipe 'as is' and it was very good. My tough customers (kids) really liked it. I think its easy to do on a week night provided there is enough time to roast the tomatoes... I substituted Perciatelli for spagetti.

I used a variety of tomatoes from my garden and did not bother to seed them. The larger size tomatoes did take longer to roast than indicated in the recipe. I also doubled the garlic and added basil before roasting and right before pureeing. Yummy... it even got excellent reviews from dbf who is not usually very thrilled by pasta dishes. I used angel hair pasta. I wonder if anyone else has used the periatelli..if you have please indicate where you found it. It sounds interesting.

We made this last night and I thought it was delicious just as is. We used whatever tomoatoes we got from the farmer's market-they were not plum. The almonds did not overpower the dish.

I liked this recipe, but I will change a few things when I make it again. First, using only crushed red pepper didn't create the right spice profile. I like spicy food, but the dry, sharp heat wasn't quite right for a pesto on pasta. Next time, I would use only 1/4 teaspoon red pepper, and I would add 1/4 teaspoon paprika. Second, a word of warning: be very careful not to overcook the almonds! I didn't burn them, but even just 10 minutes in the oven nearly singed them, and a "burned" taste dominated the dish. I suggest cooking them for less time, or without their skins, or grating away the outer layer on each nut before processing them (if they smell even a little burned) may help with that.

Well, I have to admit I was too lazy to make the pesto on a late Friday night and I normally dislike reviews that dont review the original recipe, but I feel like my revisions are worth listing.... I roasted tomatoes and garlic in a 400 degree oven, tossed toasted chopped pine nuts with chopped oregano and garlic and a tiny bit of lemon zest, chopped the roasted tomatoes and garlic, tossed that with linguine and some more olive oil, salt and pepper and served the pasta topped with the pine nut mixture and grated parmesean. No...I didnt follow the recipe exactly, but my variation was yummy and built upon the original idea. By all means, use oregano in pesto now and then.

Very tasty. Used more roasted garlic, like 3 times as much and added fresh basil because I love it. I didn't seed the tomatoes, and it was just great. A very interesting pesto that got good reviews from my guests, who are both trained chefs.
