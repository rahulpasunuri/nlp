Looks promising. I love turkish delight. i buy it from Istanbul duty free or dubai duty free whenever i fly thru any of these airports. But would love to try on my own and then change the nuts to almonds or walnuts later. Question: Do you need 2 candy thermometers concurrently for this? Do you recommend the bulb kind or the needle kind?

I have been searching for years to replicate the Turkish Delight that I had from Harrods while vacationing in London. THIS IS IT!!!!! So soft and fragrant and bizarre - there's really nothing to compare it to. I did not use the pistachio's and I cut the rose water down to only 1 tsp. It's pretty potent and a little goes a long way. I also placed it in the fridge after 3 hours at room temperature. You really need to coat the finished product generously with the sugar/corn starch combo. Get all your ingredients and tools ready before you start, and don't get distracted! I had to start over because of a phone call from Mom... I'm so glad I didn't throw in the towel and I gave it a second try!
