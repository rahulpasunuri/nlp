I use black olive bread and add garlic and rosemary (half a teaspoon) and all my guests love it. I use the same mixture to garnish a pizza or with some pasta. Always popular.

Great recipe! Don't make it with feta - been there done that -- flavor was too strong.

Really good bruschetta. Went to the specialty cheese store to find ricotta salata - zzzzz. Boring cheese. Next time I will use feta - more flavorful.

this would have received four forks if the original was made with garlic and red onion, along with basil, as several others had suggested. with those additions - PHENOMENAL!! thank you all who offered those recommendations!! will absolutely make again. for the toasts, we basted them with olive oil before broiling - with the garlic in the bruschetta, we felt there was no need to spend the extra time rubbing with garlic.

This was simple and delicious. Lots of different flavors that melded well. The feta cheese was a great addition.

Recently made and everyone loved. It was delicious! I used fresh torn basil leaves instead of the chives, but did everything else exact. Will definitely make again soon.

Great recipe but i did some shortcuts to save on time. I just threw all of the ingredients together (except the bread) and added extra olive oil. Spoon about a tablespoon of the mixture onto plain slices of french bread and broil in the oven. YUMMY!!

I absolutly LOVE this recipe. I am thirteen years old and whenever we have a family gathering they beg me to make my bruschetta. This bruschetta has the tangy taste of the shallots mixed with the sweet taste of tomatoes and and feta cheese. It is such a wonderful contrast. I would always make this recipe again.

I'm a bit of a bruschetta freak-- really into finding the best restaurant version and perfecting a home made version (Trader Joe's actually has a great bruschetta in a jar, when it's in stock.) I make this one again and again--garlic and a bit of red onion works better than the shallots. Cooking the tomatoes is also crucial-- it releases the flavor in a way that leaving it uncooked never can. I skipped the vinegar one time and used chopped greek olives instead. Worked well. Love the ricotta salata touch.

This was yummy but not as pretty as I expected. The tomatoes ended up a little mushy. I think next time I won't bother to cook them. I also used Basil instead of chives and red onion and garlic instead of shallots. That turned out just fine.

Great taste! I didn't heat the tomatoes because I prepared it ahead of serving time and it was great. I also used fresh basil instead of chives. Delicious.

This took longer than I expected to prepare (even using some time-cutting measures like canned, diced tomatoes and pre-sliced bread) but the crowd loved it.

I made this with my mom. It turned out very well. It's very good for a sunny summer day.

A greta summery tasting recipe...I agree that half of the balsamic was enough. i also substituted freash basil for the chives and once I substituted half the shallots for garlic. This is delicious with flatbread, crackers, and can keep well and warm to room temperature. I've taken it to 3 events and am getting requests for it. A relative just returned from Italy and said it reminded him of there!

I just got back from italy and was craving bruschetta - this was quick and excellent! The ricotta salata was a great addition and everyone loved it. I would add about half the balsamic vinegar, which made it a little too sweet. Otherwise yummy!

I thought this recipe was fantastic! Very delicious, although I think next time I will cut the amount of shallots in half(mostly because I really love ricotta salata!). I also thought the tomato mixture kept fairly well overnite, so if you don't want to make 16 at once, they make a great snack the next day.
