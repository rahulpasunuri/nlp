Have made this many times since the recipe was published and it's a family favorite. Used Thai Kitchens Peanut Sauce - you can buy it online. We don't eat lamb that often, but we use the sauce on chicken tenders for a great chicken sate - good with beef sate also.

Served this for Easter dinner. It won raves all around. With some slightly Asian side dishes it is a winner. A bonus is the ease of preparation.

Made this as written. No need for changes. Will do it again soon.

My husband doesn't like lamb so I substituted pork chops - wonderful!

Wow! What a great result for so little effort. I used President's Choice peanut sauce (a Canadian product)- fabulous. My daughter doesn't eat meat so I grilled some extra firm tofu with the sauce on it and she declared it excellent as well. Served with brown rice and assorted steamed vegetables. A great week night dinner, but I could have easily served this to company.

My husband raved about this dish, calling his lamb chops little pieces of gold. Would definitely make this for company. So easy to prepare!

Wonderful! I made this recipe as written and served with grilled corn on the cob and "Golden Couscous", also from this site. This will be a regular summer grilling recipe for our family.

This was delicious and quick to prepare. I used a purchased gourmet peanut sauce as the base, and it was so good I practically licked my plate.

I served this dish to my family for the first time tonight, and we all loved it. I'll definitely make this again. I also made the peanut sauce, instead of perchasing a bottle from an Asian market. The sauce recipe I got from this site as well.

I left out the ginger b/c I don't care for it and I broiled the chops, it was too cold outside for the grill! I really liked the flavor. The sauce would be great on chicken as well.
