I tried all the additions recommended. Adding wine, chicken broth, extra balsamic and mustard. Maybe I should have done it as written but I love sauce. The flavors just didn't come together. It just seemed to be missing something. Not bad, just not great. I sauteed some baby Kale with olive oil, garlic and a bit of butter to go with it which was FANTASTIC. You can get a great big bag of organice kale at costco for about $5.... yummy. Eat more greens!

Excellent. I followed other reviewers and left the chicken breasts whole and added about 1/2 cup of chicken broth. I beat an egg yolk into the broth, first though, and added about a tablespoon of honey with the vinegar and mustard.

this was tasty but nothing special. i made the recipe as is (without the basil). i would make it again for a quick tasty meal but probably would not include the basil. i feel like that would be an awkward taste mixture.

I agree with other reviewers that it's not the prettiest dish. My husband liked it a lot and would make it again. He thought it was quite flavorful. However, there are a lot of other chicken dishes that I like more (plus tons of other recipes to try), so I am not so sure that it will become a regular in our household. That said, it's pretty easy to make for a decent weekday dinner.

I modified the recipe a bit. I used shallots, not onions, more garlic, more balsamic, more mustard, added about 1/3 cup of white wine (near the end), a splash of chicken broth, portabello mushrooms, a tbsp of butter, and shredded parmesan at the end with the basil. I tasted it right after and was a bit disappointed after all the modifications I made. However, once it sat a bit (I made it late at night for the next day) I think it tasted better. It needs more umph. more flavor. the sauce needs to be reduced. I think the sauce tastes great, but I really wish it was thicker. I guess it could be thickened up pretty easily with some cornstarch or something. Thanks to all the previous reviewers - I think your input made the outcome better!! I agree that adding cream to the sauce would be awesome.

Very tasty chicken recipe. I altered it slightly, using shallots instead of onions, adding 1/2 c. white wine, and I cooked the chicken breasts whole instead of cutting them up. They were juicy and tasty (and pretty!), took a bit longer to cook, but it was worth it. I served this alongside linguine with avocado pesto and the two dishes went great together. Highly recommended.

My husband and I love balsamic vinegar, so we thought this was very good. I doubled the vinegar and mustard but it still wasn't saucy enough - next time I'll try adding broth and/or more vinegar.

I loved this- 9.5- my husband gave it an 8- I added the chckn broth and extra garlic as some of the reviewers mentioned- also doubled the mustard and added mushrooms. Would make it again- for me!

This dish is a great simple recipe! It is one of my husband's favorites because we both love balsamic so much. It is not the most attractive looking dish, but it improves if you add chicken broth like others recommended. Overall very flavorful! It has become a regular in our house.

I am a begginer cook and loved this recipe. It is very simple and produced quality results. I added dash of ck broth to get more sauce and loved it. It does need a little extra of something but the next time I prepare it I will try something new. Very nice :)

Very delicious and very easy. Make sure you double the sauce. I also use a little less onion and more garlic. Also, be sure to top with fresh basil, that makes the whole dish.

I wasn't too impressed, so right before I served it, I sauteeed a few mushrooms and threw that in with some artichoke hearts...much better, but not very special!

I have to agree with those of you who were not impressed with this dish. It was unimpressive in taste and was unappetizing to look at. I've given it a two instead of a one simply because I didn't make a sandwich and call it a loss. It was certainly edible, but nothing to write home about. I won't be making this again, and my fiance was pleased to hear me say it.

Added a splash of red wine & a splash of chicken broth to expand the sauce as others recommended, plus I added dried basil and thyme when vinegar & mustard were added. Served with red potatoes & asparagus and thought this was a very nice dinner with great flavor. I'm not sure how it could be described as bland. Next time I'm going to make more sauce & serve it with rice to enjoy the sauce even more. I definitely would not skip out on the onions.

Super. Easy, tasty, and most of the ingredients are ones I have in my pantry anyway. I added sliced portobellos and a bit of butter at the end.

I also would double the sauce, and, at the end add some real butter or cream to round out the sauce. I also agree with adding mushrooms to the sauce.This rule of thumb of 2 tbs of balsamic Vinegar and one teas of creole or whole grain mustard works well in other recipes. If you make a roast , on the side saute some onions and garlic, and then a bunch of chopped mushrooms with the pan drippings and low salt broth added to cover the mushrooms about half way. After the mushrooms are softened add the balsamic vinegar/mustard combination mentioned above one at a time until the sauce is sufficiently thick. Then add two or three ounces of real butter of cream, bring to a slight boil for just a second or two, stir and use as sauce over the roast.

Mmm good. Super easy and darned tasty.

I've made this with onions and without, with basil and without. We didn't really like it with onions too much, so the best way to make it is without onions and basil. We love the flavorful sauce that results from making it this way! This way also speeds up the preparation time, making the longest thing to do cutting up the chicken.

What a good quick. low-fat recipe. I did add a small amount of chicken broth to provide a little extra liquid. Served it with brown rice and roasted vegetables. Very Good.

I thought this was just ok. I've had much better chicken recipes. It seemed like something was missing and it didn't make enough sauce. Next time I'll try adding mushrooms and doubling the sauce. I left out the basil as the recipe said it was optional, but I have a feeling it's a must.

Rather than adding basil at the end, serve the chicken over pasta that has been tossed in pesto sauce. Delicious

Great weeknight recipe -- quick, easy, and very good. It even passed the ultimate test of being well-received by my three-year-old. Didn't have fresh basil, so used a little dried. Will definitely make again -- can't remember the last time I made anything so easy and quick.

This is a tasty, easy to make dish that I love to whip up after school or work. I prefer to use bermuda onions, which give the dish a sweeter flavor.

Very good and easy. I fleshed out the sauce by adding a little red wine. Definately use some fresh basil - it adds a nice twinge to the taste!

My wife has made this recipe three times now. Each time was a bit different but very good. The best variation of this recipe was her first which the main difference was she used chicken legs and thighs with the skin on. It really made a much better sauce, and gave it a better flavor. Also she used less onion and 2 tablespoons of minced garlic from a jar, instead of fresh garlic it comes out much better this way. I don't usually like chicken but I love balsamic vinegar so this is a grat way to compromise for us. I don't eat rice but my wife made the dish with white rice and put the sauce over it and she said that was very good too. We like this combination of ingredients and will continue to make it regularly.

I used a bit of red onion and button mushrooms, also increased the balsamic vinegar and Dijon a bit. My wife and I loved it. Very refreshing chicken dish. We also had steamed broccoli on the side that went very well.

This was a pretty good dish. It has a very strong flavor so if you are not crazy about this kind of vinegar then it's not for you. Next time I think I will add a little more mustard and try it with mushrooms as well.

Quick and easy. I like the idea of using mushrooms and will try that next time. I used Country Dijon because we like the flavor better. I also used turkey breast because that's what I had on hand. This one's a keeper.

I made this last night and it was pretty darn good. I used mushrooms instead of onion and I used a little more mustard and vinegar. I thought I used to much mustard but I couldn't pry it away from my fiance. I will defianately make this again.

Dijon and balsamic vinegar: two of my favorite ingredients! A few tips that might help others: Add the garlic towards the end of sauteeing the onions so it won't brown and become bitter. It took more like 5 mins. to sufficiently cook the chicken (no big deal). I also doubled the sauce, and added fresh cracked pepper but no salt! I think next time I might try the Honey Dijon Mustard like one other cook did. Really enjoyed this quick and spicy chicken. "Tweak" the amounts if you like one more than the other - EXPERIMENT and enjoy! KIMBER

Needed some slight modification. I added a splash of white wine to the balsamic and mustard mixture. It really made the sauce stand out. I also used mushrooms to absorb the sauce which complemented the chicken quite well.

I agree with the previous review, stating less onion and more garlic, which is what I did. I also added the couple of "glugs" of wine. Wasn't sure if it was supposed to be meant for the chicken or the cook, so I did both. It was perfect!

Very tasty - kind of like a picata, but with balsamic vinegar as the acid. I used a grainy mustard instead of dijon, and a little tarragon instead of basil. Next time: less onion, more garlic; add a few glugs of white wine to make it 'saucier'; add more salt and pepper during cooking. I served this with a wild rice pilaf and steamed broccoli spears.
