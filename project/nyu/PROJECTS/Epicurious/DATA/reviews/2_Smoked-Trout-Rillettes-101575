Hi this was good with some doctoring, (not outstanding perhaps, but tasty) and incredibly easy. Since there had been a previous mention of 'dry', I added two Tbsp of sour cream, and about a tsp of dried dill. In addition to serving it with crackers, I cut up some colorful peppers as a low carb alternative, because the spread itself is quite low carb.

This recipe was very good, although the dish could have been creamier; it was a little dry. However, the taste was excellent and it could be prepared in less than five minutes.
