This was so easy and so yummy. My husband has asked me to make it again. I am going to try what some other people have said and try the shallots, shrimp, etc. It will be fun to try some new things with it. It is a keeper.

Just reading, but I might just get a can of artichoke hearts, slice in halves or quarters, and make a mixed salad of this.

Easy and tasty. Next time I will cut down on the mayo or use a lite one. Used red and yellow bell pepper for more color and minced shallot for the onion juice.

King crab is a must on this recipe! It was in season so I splurged. The extra meat made it an entree. we served it with spicy orange chili shrimp as a side and it was great.

Easy and very good. I too added minced onion and red pepper. Thanks! But some tabasco and a little extra crab sent it over the top.

This recipe was so delicious, fresh, and fun! It's the perfect time of year for artichokes and dungeness crab. I used red bell pepper and finely minced onion in place of the green pepper and onion juice. There's a good reason this recipe dated 1956 is still around!
