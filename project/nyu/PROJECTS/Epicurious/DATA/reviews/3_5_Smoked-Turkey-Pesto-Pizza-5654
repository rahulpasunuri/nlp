I've been making this for a couple of years now and it's easy and exceptional! My family loves it

We love this pizza. I've made it several times and it is always very good. I have made it as the recipe stated and I have substituted feta for the provalone, added chicken, shrimp or other meat.

It's the crust that made the pizza. Subbed out 3/4 cup whole wheat flour for 3/4 cup of bread flour). My oven heats to 550, and I pre-warmed a pizza stone in the oven for 30 minutes before making the pizza. Made the pizza on a piece of parchment paper that I then transferred to the stone. Added roasted red peppers and omitted the artichokes (only had plain in the pantry - no marinated.) A little extra salt helped the crust also. End result was crispy crust and yummy toppings!

We really enjoyed this pizza - very tasty. I made some minor changes like forgetting to oil the dough. I doubt it was necessary with the oiliness of my pesto. I also forgot to roast the garlic so I just tossed chopped fresh garlic on top. I also had leftover canned diced tomato which I added before baking. I suppose the artichoke hearts are expendable, but they did add a nice touch of flavor.

Agreed with previous reviewer - nothing special. Plus the ingredients are expensive and not exactly staples. I'll stick with the classic, easier pizzas.

I think this is delicious. I had been making the crust recipe already, so I tried this as well, and I'm glad I did. I was fortunate to find smoked chicken as the original recipe used, so I used that. Also didn't roast the garlic ahead of time; I used bottled minced. I also put the tomatoes on right before baking, and only used mozzerella cheese. This is a great twist on pizza. I think this recipe would be great with smoked ham, too.

i admit i opted for ready made pizza crusts for this--just didnt have time to do the scratch dough. i used mamamary's pizza crusts and found them to be first rate. The rest of the recipe i followed to the "t" and my entire family enjoyed it. We dont eat pizza often so when we do we usually enjoy it. I found this recipe easy with a capital "E" and can be quickly assembled and cooked with minimal effort.

Super easy but nothing special. May not roast garlic prior to adding to pizza next time to give it some jazz.
