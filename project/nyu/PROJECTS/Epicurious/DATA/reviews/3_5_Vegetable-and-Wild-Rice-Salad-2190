I omitted the bleu cheese and cut back on the olive oil, it really doesn't need that much. Instead of bleu I added shaved parmesan on top, worked just fine. however, my rice got burned, and i still had 15 min left. fortunately, i was able to scrape by with just a little. good recipe all in all, esp. when you've got lots of xtra veggies on hand.

I added a little red onion for flavor. The wild rice took much longer than an hour to cook.

I love the colorful ingredients of this recipe and the fact that you can make a one-dish meal out of it. Leftovers hold well and can be packed as lunch. This will definitely become a staple. However, I think this recipe could be improved: 1) 6 minutes is much too long to cook the veggies. I suggest 2 minutes. 2) The rice and vegetables all had the same texture. Next time I might add walnuts, garbanzos, pine nuts, or chopped onions for a little crunch. 3) I love blue cheese, but it's the only flavor in the salad and overpowers everything. Next time I will try Parmesean or goat cheese. 4) Finally, this salad could really use some aromatics to add another layer of flavor. I suggest parsley and a little green onion or chives. WIth these changes, I think this salad could be great.

I have made this recipe since it first appeared in the magazine. It is one of my summer staples and one I bring to many summer parties. Always get rave reviews and requests for the recipe. I have varied the vegetables from time to time but the basic mix works great. I do double the amount of dressing as it gets absorbed quickly.

Excellent recipe as is-I love the blue cheese-or with the addition of garbanzo beans to make a complete vegetarian meal. I also tried using rice wine vinegar, which was good

I made this on Christmas Eve as an accompaniment to beef fondue. It is easy, has an interesting flavor and served as both the vegetable and starch. I used all wild rice, balsamic vinegar, and additional vegetables.

Made this dish for company. Served it with grilled chicken w/a mango-avocado salsa. Used half wild rice & half brown rice and added 1/2 can corn for more color and flavor. Would definitely make it again. Had the leftovers as a main course the next night w/a green salad and french bread. Nice light summer dinner.

This salad is wonderful, however I have modified it some. Use half wild rice and half brown rice. Instead of white wine vinegar use balsamic vinegar. This is great if you have vegetarian guests.
