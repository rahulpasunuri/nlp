This was delightful. I used short grain brown rice instead of the white rice, and just cooked it longer. It worked out just fine. The persimmons were a great sweet note, and the cinnamon gave the dish an exotic flavour.

Just when I was sooo tired of rice, I was served this wonderful pilaf at a dinner party with lamb chops. It was delightfully different and I can't wait to make it myself.

Truly the best dish I have ever made with persimmons. The spicy cinnamon/ginger complement the persimmon well. I substituted brown rice. Like a previous reviewer said, do not be tempted to add more cinnamon--a quarter teaspoon is enough.

An instant classic. This excellent side dish is easy, flavorful yet subtle, and an eye pleaser. So far, I've served it with roasted chicken, steamed shrimp, and pork -- and it was a terrific companion each time.

This was really good. I made chicken simmered in tomato/ginger sauce to accompany it. I have a tray of persimmons, and not much experience with them, which is how I found this recipe. I made a number of modifications based on what I had in the kitchen, of course. Onion in place of shallot, basmati rice, flat leaf parsley in place of cilantro, and no lemon juice. I also added roasted slivered almonds at the same time as the parsley and the chopped persimmon. Everyone at our table (including 7 year old) liked it--it's easy, different, colorful.

I've made this twice and have loved it both times. The cinnamon adds so much flavor to this delicious recipe.

Great side dish! The persimmon and cilantro combination was a nice surprise. My husband hadn't even finished dinner before asking me to make this agian. Don't be tempted to use more cinnamon as the flavor intensifies during cooking. Lemon to taste for me was 1/2 a lemon.

This is a GREAT rice dish, really tasty and refreshing. I served it with panroasted monkfish rubbed with columbo (a spice mixure from Reunion Island - similar to a curry)and sauteed spinach. It would be great with pork, too.
