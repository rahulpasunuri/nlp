To the last reviewer: You say you sauteed the broccoli rabe. That is quite different than boiling, which is in the recipe. Try again and boil it in water or chicken stock. I think you'll find it much less bitter.

I must be missing something here...My family likes almost everything, especially flavorful interesting dishes. Having just watched Jaques Pepin prepare broccoli rabe on TV this morning, I decided to try it. This broccoli rabe was sooo bitter, my son was asking if they could have made a mistake and sold some poisonous plant in the vegetable department. I gave it 2 forks instead of 1 because the recipe was so simple, I couldn't blame it for the bitterness. Anyway, I'm willing to give it another try, thinking maybe it's what you serve it with, or that it's one of those flavors that grows on you. Please advise me here (I washed it, sauteed it in olive oil, garlic, salt & pepper).

Is this supposed to be a recipe? Hello, get this old stuff off of the website!

Barbara's recipe is delicious, but even more delicious when you mix in grated parmigiano reggiano before serving.

I too am rating Barbara of Langhorne's recipe. I actually have made this many times since discovering it. I found it because I made a decision that I was going to like broccoli rabe, despite the fact that it was bitter and I really didn't like it. Well, Barbara changed that in a hurry. There's no effort to liking broccoli rabe the way she suggests it - THIS IS DELICIOUS. I do add a sprinkle of parmesean cheese, though not always. I'm trying to find a way to e-mail the epicurious folks to let them know that they should publish Barbara's recipe with due credit to her. Enjoy. Note: I found the link to Gourmet's editors through the site index here on Epicurious. I let them know that they should absolutely publish Barbara's recipe!

I made the Barbara version, too. However, dipped some salmon fillets in garlic bread crumbs, sauteed, served on top of rabe, and added squeezes of fresh lemon juice to all. Yum!

I'm rating Barbara of Langhorne, Pa.'s version. It was outstanding; the best way of preparing this vegetable I've found. You get the best of both sauteeing and steaming. By making it in a deep pot, I also avoided the splattered cooktop that is the bane of other sauteeing. Thank you, Barbara. (I threw some sun-dried tomatoes on top of the dish; good addition.)

Since when is boiling a vegetable a "recipe"? Especially a leafy green. This is the least nutritious way to prepare broccoli rabe--and surely the least delicious.

I'm also rating Barbara from Langhorne, PA. Her version was simply delicious! I served this with roasted red baby potatoes w/ rosemary and garlic, and turkey chops. A fabulous and hearty meal!

This receipe reminded me of how much I like the broccoli rabe recipe I picked up in Rome: 1. saute rabe in olive oil until wilted along with several cloves of chopped garlic. 2. Toss with freshly grated parmagiano reggiano and serve warm. Only way to go.

I'm rating Barbara from Langhorne's recipe. This is the ONLY way to make rabe. It is truly authentic Italian her way. Make it this way, you will never eat it any other way. It is delicious.

To give this an authentic Italian Touch, 1. Clean rabe by rinsing in large pot. 2. Slice in 2 in. pieces, by placing the bunch together and slicing accross in 2 " sections. 3. In large pot, place olive oil, chopped garlic (2 cloves or more depending on taste), pepper and red pepper. 4. Saute for 30 seconds. Add Broccoli (be careful oil does not pop up. 5. Cover, and steam, until tender.(About 5 to 10 min) By not tossing the juice, you retain all the vitamins and minerals. Serve with crusty (Italian )Bread Go ahead, dip the bread in the juice. It is Heaven. All by children, including my husband of 42 years, loves it.

Thank you Brian Gabel! I tried it your way and loved it. Three forks (at least) for the sauteed with garlic and topped with sundried tomatoes version.

I love these complex recipes...here's a great way of making broccoli rabe: saute some minced garlic in olive oil for about 2 minutes, add coarsely chopped broccoli rabe and continue sauting until rabe is wilted, but still tender crisp. Transfer to bowl and add a little more oil and some finely chopped sun-dried tomatoes. Play with the ratios to taste. Best served lukewarm or chilled. Yum!
