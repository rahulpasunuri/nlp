I followed the recipe as written except that I used 3/4 c vermouth and pounded boneless pork chops. It turned out terrific. My husband and I both give it rave reviews and will make it again. Once the pork was pounded, the recipe was simple, and I'm cooking with a 5- month old!!

I substituted deboned pork chops & dried tarragon. This was a really easy dish with lots of unique flavor. The chops were very tender. Might sub parsley for the chives & tarragon next time.

I thought this was great! We used Spanish capers and fresh herbs from the garden. I think that made it even better!

I actually printed this because I thought it would be good made with turkey cutlets. Instead, I pulled it out because I got veal scaloppine on sale and needed a recipe. I used thyme instead of tarragon, but only because I couldn't fine fresh tarragon, and squeezed half a lemon into the sauce at the end. I slipped the scaloppine into the sauce to warm it and served it over the noodles. It was a hit!

i loved this recipe. i agreed with another reviewer that it needed more liquid. i didnt have dry vermouth, so i used sweet. it turned out great. next time i will pound the meat a little thinner

To me 4 minutes is way too long to cook this thin scaloppine as carry-over cooking will continue the cooking. I only cook pork for about 60-90 seconds. Combo of chives and tarragon is great.

Delicious! Used a cast iron skillet as well, and substituted parsley for chives. Will also use more vermouth next time and more capers - loved the sauce, and want more. Only problem was the pork came out a little tough - tasty, but tough. Will also try adding onions. Overall a tasty meal.

What a great meal. Followed the recipe exactly as written. Next time I will have more liquid in the deglazing.

We really enjoyed it. I made it exactly as written, with herbs straight from the garden. The browned butter made the pork brown beautifully - I used a cast iron skillet. Next time I will probably cut back a just a little on the butter in the noodles. I might increase the capers a little too. YUM!

This recipe was simple and quick. The second time I made it I added 1/2 cup chopped onion and 1 cup sliced mushrooms, sauteing them with the pork and leaving them in the pan when the vermouth was added.

I agree, sweet and bitter do mix, which was one reason I tried it. Pretty good, have had better, but it was different, interesting and quite tasty. It's a little better than 2 and a teeny less than 3; (2 1/2 forks).

Sweet and bitter don't mix? Sure they do: lemon sorbet, dark chocolate, grapefruit juice

The fresh herbs make this dish very pleasant.
