Ehhh...made it exactly as stated. Used fresh herbs from the garden; seemed bland and a bit dry. Added more dressing. Was OK.

What a wonderful recipe!! Made it exactly as written and would not change a thing. Have made this several times, most recently served it at a dinner party with grilled double thick lamb chops to rave reviews. Jalapenos were not too spicy at all. This is a keeper.

I made this as written, but omitted the jalapenos because wasn't sure my guests would tolerate them. It was so good my DH asked me to make more today.

I just ate the freshly made version (I have some extras for tomorrow)and it was amazing! The flavors were incredible and fresh--the jalapeno carries throughout the dish really well. I couldn't find mint, skipped the capers and added some roasted bell peppers and it had amazing flavor. Think I just found my summer salad recipe!

Loved this salad. I used arugula, quartered grape tomatoes, one jalapeno and I even had sumac. Beautiful to look at too...I can't wait to make it again.

I made this salad at work and all my coworkers loved it. Even though I did not add any jalapenos the salad had an incredible flavor and aroma. I used a balsamic vinegar which was flvaored with fig and that added a sweetness to the salad as well.
