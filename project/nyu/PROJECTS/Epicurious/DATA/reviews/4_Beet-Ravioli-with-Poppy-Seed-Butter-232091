This was yummy! This was my first time making ravioli and they turned out very well. The Fresh Egg Pasta recipe is perfect. The filling is delicious. Yes, they were fiddly to make but next time will be a snap. Thanks Epicurious!

I cannot say enough about this recipe. The end result might be one of the most elegant presentations I have ever made, and it was entirely worth the effort. I had never roasted beets before, and had always been intimidated by the idea. It turns out there was nothing to be afraid of, and the flavor far exceeded any other beets I have ever consumed. I look forward to making these again and again.

I'm in with Yellowkitchen. Just mash the beets and throw in the cheese (goat + parmesan). Someday if I'm feeling profligate with my calories, I'll make some spelt macaroni and dress it with brown butter and poppy seeds. And then pile the on beets-and-cheese. Oh, and why peel the beets, anyway? Do you peel potatoes? If you do, you're throwing away the best part. Same goes for beets.

Next time I won't bother making ravioli, I will just mash the beets, add the cheeses, poppy seeds, a little butter and some of the beet greens--perhaps shredded on top of freshly made pasta and wa la! Flavors are great. I used a locally made goat cheese instead of ricotta.

So gorgeous and delicious! Even my anti-beet husband loved this. Wish I'd read the reviews first, though - some blue cheese in the filling and some sage in the butter would have made them even better. I used wonton wrappers sealed with just water, and they were perfectly cooked and still intact after 2 minutes of boiling. Served with "Quick Sauteed Kale with Toasted Pine Nuts" after a starter of the "Mango Caprese Salad", both from Epicurious, for a delicious and colorful early summer supper.

A great recipe (especially for those who don't like the taste of beets). I followed the recipe for the filling and thought it was great. But for the butter, I added some fresh sage which I think went very nicely.

Labor intensive, but absolutely worth it! I agree with the addition of goat cheese (though I used a little ricotta as well, for body), and I also tossed in some toasted, chopped walnuts, which added texture. Browned the butter sauce, which lent a nice nuttiness. I'm not sure that the poppy seeds added much, except for visual contrast, so I'll probably leave them out next time. Also, the sauce would be exceptional with a splash of balsamic vinegar, to add some acidity. Overall, a delicious, crowd-pleasing dish!

The idea for the dish is great, and I will make it again with some changes. I followed the recipe exactly, but would have been better off taking other reviewers' suggestions into consideration. The filling begs for a good salty cheese, and I couldn't taste any flavor from the poppy seeds, though I used them generously. I will skip the poppy seeds and add fresh herbs to the butter the next time I try this.

Delicious and easy to make. Took suggestions from other reviews and added gorgonzola cheese, lemon zest, and sage leaves for flavor. The uncooked ravioli seems to freeze well.

This is our favorite Christmas Eve dinner, but with some changes. Because the beets are mild and sweet, we like to use chevre goat cheese instead of the ricotta to add richness. we also add some lemon zest and a bit of salt to the beets to add a bit more fuller flavor. As for the browned butter sauce, it is FABulous, but we add sage and pine nuts instead of poppy seeds. We finish the dish off with deep-fried shallots. Add a side of roasted brussel sprouts and a green salad and you've gone to heaven.

Fabulous recipe, impressed my guests. I followed the advice of others and added a segment of blue cheese & walnuts and used an egg wash to seal. Because of this the quantity doubled and I was able to freeze the extras, in the manner described, for a girls lunch another day.

This is such a favorite of the family that it's requested this year as part of our Thanksgiving feast. I use homemade ravioli pasta (the best way to start) and then fill them with the beet filling. The only change I use in the filling is to add also a good blue cheese and walnut crumbles. This is not only a great tasting dish but a beautiful one to plate.

a must for any beet lover! the fresh pasta is delicious and just adds to the appeal. made this twice now - would sub goat cheese going fwd to add some tang.

Wish I'd seen this one in the original magazine - definitely a keeper! I made half the pasta recipe (using half soft whole-wheat flour and half soft regular flour - and as a precaution I bought some back-up wonton wrappers too (I don't have a pasta machine & was worried I wouldn't be able to hand-roll the pasta thin enough). The home-made pasta turned out perfectly flavour-wise, though it was a bit on the thick side. You have to be careful when cooking the wonton-made ravioli; they cook very quickly and tend to get mushy easily. The only change I made to the filling was to add a very little bit of gorgonzola (had some in the fridge) - and the ravioli were sublime! I didn't find the beets overly sweet at all; season properly with salt and pepper, and it's perfect! Don't skimp on the butter & poppyseed sauce, nor the grated parmigiano - it, too, balances out the sweetness in the roasted beets! I served the ravioli as a side with grilled beef tenderloins and baby bok choy sautéed with sliced garlic and crisp bacon (rapini would also have been nice too!). Simply-grilled beef, sweet & soft ravioli, and crunchy-salty-bitter bok choy - an excellent meal. Hubby 'licked his plate clean'!

I altered this recipe to begin with since I knew it would not have enough punch. I used blue cheese and cream cheese for the filling with a dash of balsamic. Laid cooked ravioli over cream cheese smear on plate. Could use mascarpone. Next time will use egg wash to seal wonton ravioli as I have a better seal when I use egg.

This recipe is unbelievably good. It truly embodies the phrase "greater than the sum of its parts". I've made it more than a few times now; I always use the wonton wrappers and they work beautifully. I have never strayed from the filling recipe and I think it's perfect. If you're making it for the first time, do try to follow the recipe without changing it-- just once. It's well worth all the effort involved.

Oh, this is really good! It took forever but it was my first time making ravioli and I was making for 10. I used fresh pasta from the local Italian shop. Make sure you use a really good quality parmesan cheese (I liked a generous amount)

Well, the filling was good. I like the idea of using beets as a ravioli filling, and so I mixed beets, feta, mint, salt, pepper, and a bit of lime juice together to make what was a wonderful filling. I can't say the same about the pasta recipe. Next time, I would certainly use a different recipe for the pasta. And the poppy seed butter wasn't very exciting. In my opinion, it needs more of a sauce.

My husband's response sums up these ravioli well, "Best use of beets EVER". I had a small bunch of small beets from our farm share that I wanted to use so I roasted them in the same manner and then added some roast carrots that I tossed in a little bit of olive oil to add some volume. I also took the suggestion of adding lemon zest but stuck with ricotta because despite current trends I really don't care for chevre. Even using wonton skins instead of the homemade pasta dough these were amazing.

I made these the other night and they were amazing. I tripled the recipe... whoa that's a lot of ravioli! I served them with melted butter and finely chopped fresh sage and they were fabulous. Making your own pasta dough is so worth it 3

Excellent. I've made this several times and it is always a huge hit. Has become a Thanksgiving standard. I've used feta, sheepmilk ricotta, chevre, with and without walnuts, it's always great. And beautiful.

This will be a standard "when the beets come in" recipe for us. We ate some and froze the rest to have later when the memory of the work to make them has faded.

Fairly time consuming but well worth the effort! Would definitely suggest making your own pasta if you have the time, otherwise wonton wrappers work "ok". I added toasted walnuts, a splash of lemon juice, S&P and half goat cheese to the filling. Also sauteed the beet greens in a little garlic and olive oil and tossed those in at the end. I'm not traditionally a fan of beets but these were VERY tasty!

My whole family loved this recipe. It was a decent amount of work, especially the final steps. I used part-skim ricotta, and substitued goat cheese for half of the ricotta. Also, I used wonton wrappers, which work great for pasta. I will make this again!

This is so delicate and delicious. I used golden beets rather than red, half goat cheese, half ricotta, added lemon zest and a few finely chopped fresh sage leaves in the filling (which I also used to scent the sauce). Yummy! My only trouble was too-thin pasta sheets. Next time I won't roll to the thinnest setting for filled pastas.

This was phenomenal! I can't believe I've lived this long in life and never tasted brown butter and poppy seeds...The ravioli was also good, but I use just the butter/seed mixture for quick weeknight meals all of the time now! Make this!

I've made them several times. Works much better with home made pasta then with wonton wrappers. Freezing helps - otherwise the pasta (or especially wontons) can get mushy and break easily. I definitely prefer mild goat cheese instead of ricotta. Don't skip on poppy seed butter, and roasted beets are the must (cooked ones are too watery for this).

Rating: 4
I loved this recipe, but decided to tweak it by using goat cheese instead of ricotta. The goat cheese complimented the earthy flavors of the beets nicely. I also tweaked the poppy seed butter by frying sage leaves in the butter first, and then removed them and fried the ravioli's in small batches with the poppy seed-sage butter. I garnished the ravioli's with the fried sage leaves, and voila! The presentation and flavors are amazing.

Rating: 3
These are so pretty and tasty and a nice, new way to use beets. I used wonton wrappers and they worked great. I like the idea of mixing a little goat cheese into the filling to counter the sweetness of the beets - next time! I served the ravioli over some tuscan kale that I sauteed in olive oil and a little garlic and it all was so pretty on the plate.

Rating: 4
The visual presentation and flavors are really wonderful. The dish is elegant and creative. I believe a previous viewer was correct - some toasted walnuts or pecans to the filling would be nice. I folowed the preparation steps as written but then tossed in some cubed roasted butternut squash. The addition of the squash was a nice contrast visually and added another layer of flavor and richness. Really a wonderful dish.

Rating: 3
Unique ravioli recipe, although the filling was a bit watery tasting or flat. Perhaps because the filling was watery, these ravioli were more fragile and prone to tearing and becoming waterlogged when we cooked them (we were making them side by side with a sweet potato ravioli that had a sturdier filling and held together much better). Rather than the butter and poppyseeds, I sauteed the beet greens in some olive oil, seasoned with salt and pepper, and added a splash of red wine vinegar at the end. I think the greens really added good flavor, color, and texture to round out the meal. With the changes I think the dish was pretty tasty/elegant, but if I made them again I would try to add something else to boost the flavor of the filling.

Rating: 3
The taste was delicious! Unfortunately, the wonton wrappers I used caused a travesty. They broke apart when trying to get them out of the boiling water. In the future, I think I would simply sautee these in butter straight from the freezer -- otherwise, the wrappers will turn to mush again. The flavor was delicious though. For those wanting a stronger, less sweet taste, I recommend boiling the beets instead of roasting.

Rating: 4
I used won ton wrapper to prepare this. It was wonderful. The only tip I would add is to be careful not to overfill the ravioli if you are planning to freeze the extra. A few of mine broke apart during boiling after having been frozen and I think it was because of the filling expansion during freezing.

Here's the thing: Visually this dish is a 10. But I found the beets' sweetness to be overpowering. I did use people's suggestion regarding the goat cheese and agree the tangy element helped - and don't overlook the importance of the poppy seeds, hard to explain but they add something. To me this dish is just short of a homerun. My wife and I both thought the filling could use an additional ingredient that serves to both cut the sweetness, and add a textural layer. Perhaps chopped walnuts, or small slices of blanched asparagus? Or maybe a Parmesan based sauce... anyone feel the same way? Will make this again, but experiment with the fillings. Definitely try it though - a great showpiece. And making the pasta is a snap if you have the rolling machine.

We made this last night, and it was fabulous. Used 1/2 and 1/2 ricotta and goat cheese as per earlier suggestions, and it worked well. We mixed lemon zest in with parmesan and used it as a self-serve condiment. We did make fresh ravioli from scratch--it was time-consuming, but we set up a four-person assembly line, and cranked out about 100+ ravioli from a big double batch. Totally worth it!

This was the first time I tried making ravioli. I used fresh beets from my garden and made fresh pasta. They really were beautiful, but tasteless. I love roasted beets but their flavor didn't come through. I added a bit of garlic and lime juice to the filling to perk it up but they still tasted like noodles in poppy seed butter. I'll try fresh ravioli again, but not with this filling.

Following previous suggestions, I used a mix of ricotta and goat cheese, with lemon zest. The result was delicious - a great summer dish.

I only give three forks because I took advise from previous people but that many because I think people should make it with some modification. First, use goat cheese & lemon zest. Also, I pureed the beets, which was really nice. Finally, either cook right away or freeze or douse with semolina flour because a day in the frig, makes these jewels beautiful but hard to handle. Lovely, though, really . . . a great crowd pleaser. . . .micro greens if you can find them are a perfect match.

I've been meaning to try this recipe for 2 years, and I'm glad I did. It's very simple, I made it with wonton wrappers. I added a little bit of lemon zest to my second batch, and I think that it perked up the dish. It's impressive, delicious, light and beautiful!

Made these for our Halloween party, and they were awesome. They looked beautiful (and in the right light- a little creepy, which was the idea) and they tasted delicious. Like other reviewers, I subbed the goat cheese for ricotta and also used wonton wrappers for ease, and thought they were perfect. I also had so-called beet-haters at the party, and there was a 3 way fight over the last ravioli!

This recipe is very similar to a dish served at Al Di La Trattoria, a popular restaurant in Park Slope, Brooklyn. I found their recipe online and have made it many times. The combination of flavors is unique and unbelievably delicious, and I would imagine this version is also very good. The only thing different about the Al Di La recipe is the addition of some melted butter and an egg to the filling. I have found many uses for this filling, I toss it with pasta, add it to mashed potatoes, eat it on its own, and I've even thinned it with some cream to make a salad dressing that's especially good over spinach.

Loved this dish! I gave this recipe to a friend to make as the first course for our gourmet club dinner and she made with wonton wrappers. Everyone went bonkers and wished we had more so we could just eat it as the main dish. Even two of the husbands that HATE beets ate and loved them. a definite keeper.

I made this recipe exactly as written.(Which is a first for me.) And it turned out terrific. The flavor combination of the ricotta and beets was subtle and sweet, with a nice salty tone from the butter poppy seed sauce. I did premake the raviolis and freeze them. They only took a few minutes 3-5, once dropped into boiling water, to cook. I made my own pasta, and found that it was nice to be able to control the thickness of the pasta dough. 5 on the pasta maker gave a thicker heartier ravioli, and 6 a more delicate pasta with a redder color. It was important to flour the surface that you put the raviolis on as you are working, because they tended to stick to everything. The flavor and look of these are fantastic for a special occasion.

I made this dish, substituting goat cheese, as other reviewers suggested. Delicious, and so pretty! I love the combination of the beets and goat cheese. And, using wonton wrappers made it really easy. Having given it a successful "test drive," I'm planning to serve these as an appetizer at a dinner party next week. QUESTION: Once frozen, how long do these take to cook when dropped directly into boiling water?

Very easy to prepare. I roasted the beets the night before to make it even easier and used wonton skins in place of fresh pasta. Very different and delicious combination, mildly sweet. Although the butter and poppy seed combo was good, i think i will try it with a flavourful olive oil drizzled over top next time and then sprinkle with poppy seeds.

We used won ton wrappers and also substitued goat cheese, per another poster's comment. Since we ate this as a starter to our main course we ended up only consume 8 out of the 55 or so we made. Since we still have most of the batch in the freezer, we can enjoy them without hardly any labor laster in the season. I can't wait to share this recipe with my friends.

This dish is wonderful! It is time consuming but worth it for a special meal. I did not make any changes to the recipe. The poppyseeds are necessary, don't skip them. I served them alone (I served the salad first) so the flavour of the beets would not have to compete, and so my guests could truly appreciate them given the work in them! They have a light and fresh flavour, and are beautiful. Highly recommended.

Used wonton wrappers - very easy and just as effective. Terrific flavor and the butter "sauce" makes the dish very rich. Take it easy on the parmesan, though, so that it doesn't overpower the flavors in the dish.
