I just reread the ingredients to make sure I didn't miss anything. I LOVE mushrooms and this was mediocre at best. No real distinguishing flavour and the cream blunted the flavour of the chanterelles -- and I'd dialed back the cream to half-and-half. No way I'd make again.

Fabulous recipe! While expensive, the chanterelles are well worth it. Will try the suggestion of truffle oil. Using pappardelle is important to catch the wonderful sauce.

Adding black truffle oil at the table turned this one from a great dish to an OMG! We needed a simple vegetarian Thanksgiving center of plate for celebration in a tiny NYC apt. No one missed the turkey!! Chanterelles were $20.00 per lb. so used about 4 oz. of them, some shiitake and cremini (total a tad over a pound). Served it over coarsely mashed potatoes, with green beans, roasted yellow beets and boiled beat greens. A Thanksgiving to remember

Great! The sauce is simple and really lets the mushrooms be the star of the show. I hand-made a batch of pappardelle and it was definitely worth it. A very rich recipe but you will walk away satisfied every time.

Fantastic. I followed the recipe except for the heavy cream (had none at home) for which I substituted about 3 T of cream cheese and a generous splash of half & half. Served it over baby yellow potatoes and it was a hit. Will definitely make this again!

I didn't find chanterelles either. Thought I did but didn't have my glasses. Got the chef's blend that had 4 different mushrooms and thought the chanterelles were in it. But none. So used that package of mushrooms. Did the heavy cream and all. With German egg noodles. Absolutely yummy!!!!!

What a satisfying vegetarian main dish! This is definitely one that will help fill in for those sorely missed fall dishes of my carnivorous youth (like Stufato Di Manzo). I used half-and-half, oyster, shiitake, and crimini mushrooms, all the butter :) and oregano (which worked surprisingly well with this). I served it over slightly boiled and smashed bintje and huckleberry potatoes. YUM!

Very yummy recipe! I used oyster mushrooms instead since the market didn't have chanterelles and it was very tasty. I would caution the use of the entire amount of butter, though. I used only 3T in all, along with half and half instead of heavy cream and it was still very rich. I also substituted thyme for oregano to better pair with the rest of the meal.
