This is good with the fennel-onion mixture on the side as a relish. Turned it into a tapas-style main course with 4 sardines per person + side salad (*which needs a vinaigrette to offset or rather balance the lemon-y flavors of the fish - maybe sherry vinaigrette or balsamic) + bread.

This was awesome -- perfect flavor combinations. The fennel and preserved lemon both work to cut the sardinicity/anchovihood of the dish (we used anchovies, as sardines are no longer in season). We left some crispness in the vegs -- next time I'll work em down further, really caramelize em -- but they were pretty good in the crispier format. Drank with a white Burgundy (a Mercurey) and a Sancerre -- would definitely recommend the latter as a pairing.

This was awesome -- perfect flavor combination. Preserved lemon and fennel both work to cut right into the sardininess/anchoviness (we used whole & fresh anchovies, because sardines weren't in season). (And if you wanna convince a non-lil-fishie eater to eat the little guys, this is a great one to start with.)

I am fortunate to live in CA where we can get pretty much everything fresh. So I used fresh sardines and preserved lemons that I had made from my Meyer Lemon tree. This recipe was not only delicious but healthy and easy. I grilled the fish on my gas grill. Aside from having to pick the bones out, my husband and I enjoyed it immensely and it's very healthy.

Out of necessity I made substantial changes to the recipe. The result was a blend of flavors and textures that transported me seemingly half-way around the world. First, I used large 1/2 pound frozen sardines. I fried them using the spices listed. However, not having fresh dill, I just sprinkled a little dried over the fish. For the fennel, I didn't have fennel and just used onion and celery. Even so, the preserved lemons and all the flavors created a very exotic dish that was quick to prepare and eat for lunch.

We had the sardines (frozen, Portuguese) and preserved lemons have become a stock pantry item, but no fennel; how about leeks? This was a fabulous dish using leeks, and dried dill worked just fine in the dressing. Served with plain Jasmine rice and a combination of sauteed red Swiss Chard and fresh spinach, the lemon dressing, in my opinion, brought all the various textures together beautifully.
