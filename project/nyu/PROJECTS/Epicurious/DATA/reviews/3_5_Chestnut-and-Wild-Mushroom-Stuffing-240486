Turned out great, however, as written, it does not state when to add the chestnuts to the actual stuffing. I assumed it was before baking, but perhaps the editors want to take a look at it.

Yes, this recipe forgets to point out when to add the prepared chestnuts. (Just toss them in at the end as you are mixing in the mushrooms to the bread.) And I used a smaller pan. Also, the broth was too much- maybe by 1/4 of a cup. Also, I'd suggest being super gentle and use minimal stokes when mixing in the mushroom sautée to the prepped bread/broth because the mushrooms create a dark grey-brown juice that will turn everything grey-brown... which is not that pretty. I used a marbled rye/pumpernickle bread and it wasn't overpowering at all- it was delicious! Even with the faults in transcribing the recipe, it's delicious and it's a keeper.

Made with 1/2 porcinis and 1/2 chantrelles, this recipe turned out the best out-of-the- bird stuffing I have EVER had. Like the other recipes in this Traci Des Jardins menu, however, the instructions were badly written and edited. I also doubt anyone ever tried to make this recipe as written before it was published. First, a 9x13 dish is too big unless maybe you cut everything very chunky. Second, add the liquid a little at a time. It probably won't take 2 cups and maybe less than 1- 1/2. Third, hey Traci! When do the chestnuts go in? DUH. Oh, and make it with sourdough. The subtle mushroom flavors would be lost with rye or pumpernickel. Lastly, watch the salt. The full tablespoon was just shy of too salty for my taste. If you don't like salt, use less. Still, a great recipe. Oh, and with all the other problems with the isntructions, oddly enough 3 tbs. and 1 tsp. IS the right amoutn of thyme.
