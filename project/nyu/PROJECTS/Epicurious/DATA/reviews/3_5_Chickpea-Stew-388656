This was good. I didn't add the bread as we are trying to eliminate carbs at dinner time. I used 6 thighs instead and also added sliced zucchini (2 small) towards the end of the chicken simmering. I didn't add red wine but i did add more red pepper flakes and some garlic salt. I also used chicken broth in place of water. Next time i wont use as much broth especially if i'm not adding the bread or a carb replacement to absorb it. Overall, it was good and light.

One of my all time favorites! I add asparagus, chicken bouillon and instead of the bread I use pasta, specifically campenelle. Its absolutely delicious for a cold winter night!

Added more garlic, red wine for the sauce, extra lemon and more chicken. Used cayenne as not of red pepper flakes. It was ok but too soupy. Ended up reducing the sauce down quite a bit. Think would be good with more veggies - maybe some courgettes added right at the end.

Delicious and easy! I almost always use chicken broth when water is called for and did so here as well. Also used 4 thighs (Costco package) and a bit more spice (including the curry suggested). Was surprised that recipe did not call for toasting the bread, but figured it only made sense to do so. Great one pot meal and made lovely lunch leftovers!

This is my new go to recipe. I used chicken broth and extra chili peppers. Delicious!

I have made this recipe a couple times now. I tweaked it a little by using both cumin and curry and for the bread, I used a stale sourdough loaf that I cut into cubes and toasted in the oven while the stew was cooking. I used chicken breast one time, but I like it better with the chicken thighs. This is a big hit with the roommates, too.

This was great, but only because I made a LOT of changes. I think the base was just too thin. As other suggested, I used stock instead of water, and pureed half the chickpeas. I also added some red wine to the stock, extra chicken thighs, fresh tomatoes, and some kale at the end, which was really nice. Also added extra chillis!

I wanted to try this recipe because it lends itself to food storage pantry items. Like other reviewers I found chicken broth better than water, 3-4 chicken thighs a tad more substantial. Instead of using plain bread cubes I made oven toasted croutons tossed with olive oil, granulated garlic, sweet smoked paprkia, crushed oregano and S&P. The crunchy pieces absorbed the sauce and definitely gave an extra spicy definition. Don't add the croutons until ready to serve..and add some chopped flat leaf parsley to finish. It even tastes better the next day.

Substituted stock for water, added a bit more tomato paste and a few more chicken thighs - easy and tasty.

Rating: 4
So quick and easy with very good flavor. I will definitely make it again. I used left over meat from the chicken I had roast the night before. I also added cabbage at the beginning and substituted chicken broth for the water. To make it a little healthier I served the soup over a bed of quinoa instead of bread. I would maybe add a little more red peper flakes next time because i love things spicy but other than that it was superb!

Whoops, forgot to add that I used three chicken thighs instead of two. While I don't think it needed the extra chicken, it made the dish an easier sell to Boyfriend, who is a big meat eater.

Good, solid recipe. The bread I used wasn't "crusty" enough, but it was still good. I think if I had used a heartier bread it would have been even better. This recipe had a lot of flavor for not too much effort. Easy, weeknight choice.

Based on previous reviews, I used 4 chicken thighs and was generous with the garlic, spices, and red peppers (I always am) and I really enjoyed the stew. It is hearty, with a nice kick. Great for a weeknight meal. I will make this again

I made this for my husband and myself a very cold February night for a bit of comfort food. I followed the recipe exactly, but I found the broth a little thin-tasting (as mentioned in previous reviews). To compensate for this - and it worked very well - I stirred in two heaping tablespoons of Tahini. Really delicious.

Rating: 3
Nice comfort food for everyday family menu. Used previously roasted dark turkey meat and the chicken broth suggested by others. My rendition had a darker brown tone instead of the reddish/brown color in the BA pic and was a little less presentable. Would not serve this to entertain but works well in the family menu rotation. Simple. Healthy. Enjoyable. Easily paired with salad for a good meal.

I have to admit I didn't really follow this recipe but more used it as inspiration for my own version. I pureed half a can of chick peas and half a can of cannelini beans and added it at the tomato paste stage. I also added a handful of golden raisins and some mango chutney to make it more interesting. And it was great!

I substituted chicken broth for the water and reduced the cumin to 1-1/2 tablespoons. It was fabulous! My 6 friends who tried it all liked it, but those who don't care for hot/spicy foods felt it was borderline for them. I agree. It had a bit of a "bite" to it. A fun food!

We did not love this. It was good, not great, needed something more to give it some oomph.

It was good for a week night. I don't like canned beans so I used dry beans cooked in advance on the weekend and used my own homemade veg stock instead of water. Other than that I followed the recipe. It was very much like what I would just do on my own with no recipe.

Rating: 3
Truly Delish! I too used four thighs and chicken broth in place of the water. I also added sliced mushrooms and onions with the garlic, used the whole can of tomato paste, and used one can chickpeas, one can black beans, for a bit of variation. Hearty, healthy, and flavorful. Would give it four forks but for some reason it just seems inappropriate for a stew. A new staple in my repertoire.

Really simple recipe that tastes great. I think it tastes better with a little additional fat so don't cut it all off when you clean your chicken. Put some meat on your bones! Also, don't forget your hearty bread and you'll be set. Happy Cooking.

I made this last night using chicken thighs I had on hand, which were not boneless or skinless. I used 4 instead of two thighs and drained virtually all of the fat from the pan after cooking them. I thought this was an exceptional recipe in terms of ease of making and taste. To add more flavor, consider using dried garbanzo beans and reconstituting them with water (or chicken broth) with a lot of garlic added.

I felt like I was eating a batch of chickpeas. Way too much for my taste. And, speaking of taste, way too bland. I would suggest substituting something else for half the chickpeas and then supercharging the spices. There are better ways to deal with chicken thighs.

So interesting that the ONLY rather negative review was from someone who didn't follow the recipe. Plus not very helpful. Having used the thighs, I found this an easy and delicious stew.

Super easy and tasty recipe! My favorite part was that there was very little prep time involved (since most ingredients were canned). The only thing missing from the instructions is how to shred the chicken - I found that using two forks and pulling apart sections works best - very easy!

How can you say "it lacked flavor" if you switch out flavorful thighs for bland breasts, and omit the parsley? I really don't understand how anyone can "review" a recipe if they don't follow the recipe!

We LOVED this recipe. First time I made it I ran out of cumin and substituted in 1 tbsp curry powder instead of 1 tbsp of the cumin. It was great. Second time we made it with all the requested cumin and it wasn't as good. Adding it over the bread cubes was fun and tasty.

Correction to previous review: We used chicken BROTH, not chicken breast, in place of water.

We really didn't love this recipe. We followed it except we used chicken breast instead of thighs, omitted the parsley, and used chicken breast instead of water for added flavor. We just thought it lacked flavor overall.

i made this for my husband and brother-in-law, both of whom are kinda particular when it comes to food. i left out the parsley (on accident) and didn't add the extra oil towards the end of the recipe and it still came out great. it's a stew and not a soup so if you like more liquid you have to adjust the recipe which i may do next time but it was very good. i cut up whole wheat french bread and it seemed to go ok though next time i'll look for a crustier bread. quick and i'll be making again for sure.

Very Good- Would certainly make it again- Very Easy- 3 forks because it just didn't have a "Wow!" Factor. Good comfort food though- very good over the bread cubes!

Surprisingly good exactly as written--or almost exactly. I used three thighs because they were quite small. The bread cubes were a nice addition--glad I tried them. I used Trader Joe's mini pain Pascal, which had the perfect rustic chewiness to hold up in the stew. The broth wasn't excessive; it really is a stew, not a soup. The fresh lemon juice really pulled the tastes together in the broth. Simple to make, hearty and delicious, and everyone loved it.

Rating: 4
I was skeptical of the 2 tbs of cumin but... it worked. I added onion (and 4 thighs), and had no bay leaves or parsley. I did not want a soup so used only 2 cups of water and served it over Trader Joe's Barley mix. And added the juice from one lemon (what do you do with the other half?) It was great. Easy, and for sure a keeper.

This was a huge hit with my kids. I amended it to add the chicken at a later stage to one pan, after dividing the sauce into two pans. My daughter is a vegetarian. Very tasty! I served it over quinoa instead of bread. Couscous would also work well.

Fabulous. Hubby and teenage daughter devoured it. (Granted, the daughter who's finicky would have found it too spicy, but she wasn't home.) Only change I made was to serve over quinoa instead of the bread cubes. Yummy, and even better for you.
