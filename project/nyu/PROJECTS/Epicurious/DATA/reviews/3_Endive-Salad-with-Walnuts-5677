Hate to spoil the perfect record but this recipe did NOTHING for us. We do enjoy Slivered Endive Salad on this site, and would recommend that one instead.

I recently misplaced my recipe for this salad and was dismayed. It is a family favorite. I'm glad I was able to relocate it on the net.

This was an elegant salad, yet it was extremely simple to prepare- I toasted some walnut halves on a griddle while I washed and cut the endive, and the dressing was a snap! Will make this one again and again. The dressing would be delicious on any slightly bitter or pungent greens.

My husband and I enjoyed this, I'll be making it again soon.
