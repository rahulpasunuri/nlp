the dumplings were easy to make. it was a fun project, too, with my 4 year old since she can certainly toss water and was good at shaking the dumplings using a slotted spoon. i followed most all the directions. right at the end, i opted to put the dumplings directly in the pan with melted butter, then covered them with most all my mustard greens. the next two batches of dumplings just went on top, alternating with the last handful of greens. i folded gently and it mostly worked. the only thing i'd change is to saute the greens gently in a separate pan so they could be seasoned and wilted perfectly. also, i might also try kale or swiss chard, although the bitter & salty combo really did work pretty well here.

Just tried this as described except using half the butter. OMG!!!! Making the dumplings definitely takes practice - mine ranged in size from Israeli couscous to large shells but all cooked evenly and taste good. I had my best results when I made several dents in the surface of the semolina so that I could concentrate the water in these - but don't make them too deep or the dumplings will be thick. Used Pecorino Romano - the salt offset the mustard greens nicely.
