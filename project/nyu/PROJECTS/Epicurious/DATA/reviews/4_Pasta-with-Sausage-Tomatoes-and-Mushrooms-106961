I made half this recipe last night for 2 of us and it was fantastic. All the ingredients just came together for a special meat sauce. I did make a couple of additions - Italian style diced tomatoes, drained and some cream. I used 3 sweet sausage links and 2 hot to equal 1 1/2#. I also used parmesan instead of pecorino which I don't like. This says it serves 8 but making half would have served 8!! So beware.

We halved the recipe and it would serve six (6) healthy eaters. It really was delicious. I used refrigerated, tubed basil, because it seemed less expensive ($4 for half a cup) and I'm too lazy to chop up that much basil (1 1/2 cups is ALOT of basil). Half the recipe needs more than one entire tube. I also accidentally didn't get crushed tomatoes, but we just added some tomato paste to the canned tomatoes to make it thicker. I bet it would have been better if I hadn't messed up.

Like many before me, I substituted red wine instead of white. Also, being on a diet, I used half-spicy, half-sweet turkey sausage and it turned out great! Added additional garlic and also threw in some crushed red pepper. Easy and delicious!

Cut in half and used red wine instead of white. Awesome! It's that dish you always crave when you want a hearty red sauce.

Excellent... I felt I was in Italy. Accompany this with a Barolo or other Nebbiolo based red wine and off you go into heaven.

We loved this recipe. I used red wine as many others did. We used ziti one night. Try it, like we did, with Farro or Barley- yum! Freezes beautifully

Everyone (family of six) really enjoyed this dish. The conclusions was that Penne Pasta would be the best choice. In addition to the fresh tomatoes, I used 1 can of diced tomatoes, 1 can of tomato sauce and about 2 or 3 ounces of tomato paste. Different from the recipe but it worked OK. No doubt it will be made again.

EColadarci10 on 02/26/11 I loved this recipe! I bought spicy Italain sausage from Whole Foods, which I believe was why it turned out so well. I also used red wine in the sauce - I don't think white would be as good with it. Additionally, I halved the recipe because I was only cooking for two, but it made enough sauce for at least four people. I also did not add butter or romano to the sauce and didn't miss them or think the recipe needed anything extra. And, it can be frozen. I made a batch for my dad and he kept it in the freezer for a week and said it tasted as good as it did when I made it fresh. Overall a fantastic recipe. I can't wait to make it again.

This is very very good; we served it over gnocchi. The only changes I made were to use a mix of sweet and spicy sausage, which I think was critical, and to use a few more chunky tomatos than crushed tomatos. Next time, I think I will try red wine; I'm not sure the white added much.

Good recipe! I halved the recipe but otherwise made the recipe as written. The fresh tomatoes are a welcome addition to a pasta sauce that usually has canned. Butter? Weird, but I did it - not sure if I tasted it. Solid dish.

OMG, this is sooo good! I used the red wine like I usually in my tomatoe sauces and used hot and mild sausages. The consistency was great! Also cut down on the romano slightly and passed. Halved the recipe..can't wait to make for company!

Solid recipe, very rich tasting sauce. We cut the recipe in half and it turned out awesome.

This was delicious. I made a few changes to suit my family's taste. We are not big on fresh basil and oregano so I used the dried herbs and sauteed them in when it called to add the fresh ones. I left out the butter at the end and used fresh linguini that I picked up at the grocery. The sauce takes a bit of time but is relatively easy to make. Well worth the effort. This will be a family favorite from now on.

P.S. I used a can of whole tomatoes (plum) and mashed them up a bit as they cooked. I like the varied lumps.

This recipe is absolutely delicious. I only had dried herbs, left out the butter and the cheese, and it was still terrific. The sausage alone makes it rich. It would be really good for a group or a pot luck. Will try it again using the full recipe. I was tempted to throw in some sliced peppers and spinach, but refrained. Thick mushroom slices hold up well.

This was quite tasty. My only issue was the sausage, which was dry. I used a turkey sausage, however, and I think it was the fault of the sausage rather than the pasta. Because of kosher laws I didn't add any cheese, and it was still very tasty.

I am so confused. At least 2 reviews mentioned roasted red peppers or at least peppers.What peppers people?

Very good! Had to make some changes due to what was available in the cupboard. Used 4 cans of diced tomatoes instead of stewed...added first 3 cans in beginning, and last one when you are suppose to add the diced. Also only had 1/2 lb of sausage, so used 3/4 lb of ground beef to supplement. Was easy and delicious for a girls night I hosted.

overall very tasty, but better the next day as most tomato sauces are. i adjusted quantities on everything: i used 1 lb of turkey sausage, 1/3 cup onion, half of each herb, 3/4c white wine & 28oz can crushed toms. but no diced & no butter. next time i will use diced toms instead of crushed for a different consistency.

Pretty good. We like the recipe on this site for sausage cream sauce with pasta, this is a more healthy alternative with just as much flavor. This only thing we may try next time is to roast the peppers before hand, peel & seed, then add in towards the very end.

First thing I did was pull out the calculator to cut this down for the two of us. It still made too much. Hate to be a downer, but this recipe did nothing for us in spite of all the chopping of fresh ingredients. Will try something else next time.

This was extraordinarily good. I used turkey sausage (wish I'd had hot instead of sweet, but added hot sauce), red bell peppers, and a bit of sour cream instead of the butter. Also used much less oil than recommended. And it was fabulous, despite the fact that I cooked it for only an hour. It would be fantastic as a pizza topping, too. Next time I'd use more mushrooms and more peppers. Can't wait for leftovers tomorrow and to freeze some for the future.

I followed this recipe through the wine reduction but instead of adding the crushed and diced tomatoes, I used 1-1/2, 25 ounce jars of Trader Joe's Organic Marinara Sauce. Saved 40 minutes of simmering time and eliminated the butter! In addtion to the crumbled sausage, I included meatballs and served it over red pepper and spinach spaghetti (beautiful colors). Garlic bread and a crunchy greeen salad turned this dish into "gourmet" spaghetti and meatballs!

This pasta was wonderful! I used both spicy and sweet Italian suasage and it was a perfect combonation. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. It did take me about 2 1/2 hours from start to finish but it was worth the time.

Came out well when first did it and used a bit of spicy sausage, which added a kick as another reviewer suggested. Does anybody have a suggestion for a mushroom substitute - i want to make this for a group but one person's allergic to mushrooms...

It was a bit more time-consuming than I intially thought, but I guess any red sauce made from scratch needs time to simmer. I left the mushrooms in very thick slices, which helped them stand up against the other bold flavors.

The crushed tomatoes seemed to overwhelm the more delicate flavors of the mushrooms and wine and turned this into a standard red sauce. Not bad, certainly, but not tremendously exciting either.

I found myself in a time crunch and without the crushed tomatoes so used a large jar of prepared sauce instead. Quicker and (likely) just as delicious.

Made this recipe with Turkey Sausage (am not a red-meat eater). I added a little bit of sugar to cut back on the acidity of the tomatoes and some chili pepper flakes for heat. My boyfriend and I thought this was deeelicious. Sauce was hearty and despite what some of the reviews say, this was a very simple and easy dish to make. Looking forward to my leftovers tomorrow!

We loved this sauce. Oddly, I had no pasta in the house, so I put this on fresh pizza dough, and topped it with roasted red peppers and fresh mozzerella. Mmmmmmm! One of the tastiest pizzas I've ever made. I'm going to make the sauce again and try it the traditional way this time.

In an effort to lighten this up a bit, I used Hillshire Farm "Lite" smoked sausage (11g fat per link vs. 25g for regular Italians--I cut it into small pcs) and half and half, and it was delicious! Next time I'll try it with a different light sausage and Land o' Lakes fat free half and half--I went to a different grocery store this time and it didn't offer many choices.

This recipe is just ok. I made it because of the high rating. I followed it to the latter, and I thought that it lacked some zest, it needs a kick. Maybe spicey sausage rather than sweet? Red pepper? I might make it again, but would have to play with the ingredients. This is the first time I have been a little disappointed with a 4-fork rated recipe....

I'd give it 3.5 forks if I could, but this dish is really quite good. Only change I made was using chicken broth because I didn't have white wine, and added a little swirl of half and half at the end to change the colour and texture a bit. I used trumpet shaped pasta and it worked fabulously with the meaty sauce. Good hearty dish.

Very easy and very good. I used four links of sweet sausage and one of hot for half a recipe (conveniently, our local sausage makers like the four links to a pound size!). I also added extra mushrooms, as they're a family favorite. As suggested by a prior reviewer, I swirled in some fresh mozzarella at the end, but I don't think it made enough difference to repeat this part. (I'll save the mozzarella to pair with fresh tomatoes and basil--much more yummy) I'll try this with varieties of sausage, for different flavors.

I used a pound of bulk italian sausage for this recipe, so I scaled down the other ingredients but didn't measure things exactly, and I used rainbow gemelli pasta. The dish was easy to prepare, the flavor was good, and it wasn't too spicy for my children. I found the sauce to be on the watery side, though (maybe because I left out the cheese). I plan to add some tomato paste to the leftovers to thicken it up.

This recipe was very, very good. I basically halved it. I didn't have all the fresh herbs on hand, so I used the standard 1-2 teaspoons of dried. I also used Garlic Cheese Italian Sausage. I only used one can of "recipe ready" tomatoes. My family thought the flavor was very good, and everyone cleaned their plates. It's a good way to use sausage. I will make this again.

Great recipe. My family loved it. I used sweet chicken sausage and the only thing I would change is to mix in some spicy sausage next time (it could have used a little kick). With a food processor it was fairly easy to prepare. The sauce was extremely tasty and had a nice light feel to it. Used Rigatoni which seemed a perfect choice for the sauce.

Have made this recipe twice now, once with a combo of regular & spicy sausage and once with pancetta instead of the sausage.

I used the sweet sausage and it was very good, but I like things to be on the spicy side and I agree with other reviewers who liked it better with hot Italian sausage (or a combination). I'll make it that way next time. Nevertheless, because this recipe yields so much sauce it would be terrific for feeding a crowd after a hard day of skiing or some other winter activity. A great comfort food, as another reviewer noted!

This is a very nice version of the standard "sausage, onions, and peppers" dish - if you use some of the more earthly mushrooms, it really enhances the dish. I used the hot italian sausages. They really aren't hot as the name implies and I think add more flavor. Definitely will make again -

Yummy, not unusual but a good basic homestyle sauce. I have four children ages 15-22, and I made this sauce a second time, simmered it until thick, and froze it in servings suitable for topping a pizza. Kids defrost sauce in microwave then top a pizza shell with sauce (which already contains the sausage & mushrooms)add grated mozzarella and they have a dinner in minutes.
