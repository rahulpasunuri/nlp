Made these for the second time tonight- the first time I thought they were great and repeated them for my boyfriend and his brother who were just drooling over them. Used poblanos I was growing in my back garden and pretty much followed this recipe to the letter. Only 3 tiny differences: first, I roasted the peppers over my gas range (instead of the oven) until lightly blackened all over, then after steaming in a paper bag I peeled them easily under running water. Much faster than trying to roast in the oven (and based on earlier reviews, much less likelihood of them falling apart, as mine never did). Also, I cored the peppers from the top instead of doing the slit down the side per other reviewers suggestions, and I added the grated cheese to the bean mixture instead of putting it on top so when you cut into it you get a delicious, gooey slice. This time around I tried adding minced garlic to the onion mixture but it didn't do much... if I were to try the garlic again I'd just put it inside the pepper with everything else. Served with brown rice. So easy to do and well worth repeating. A winner!

Umm, make sure you actually use poblanos. my mom gave me mystery peppers and I totally burned my face off. Plus with the cayenne. Yowza. Everything else was good!

I made the recipe exactly as printed and it was very good. My poblanos were very big, so I used only three of them. The chilis fell apart a little after grilling and removing the seeds, but that wasn't a problem. I prefer to grill chilis on the barbecue than under a broiler for a smokier taste. All in all, a very good recipe.

super easy and really good! didn't think there would be enough to them as written but there was. Roasted the peppers ahead of time and had in frig which makes it easier. Would consider adding veggies or meat to the stuffing next time

Re: peeling poblanos, Charing on burners of gas stove works really well. I use tongs to hold and move around until all indentions are black. This time, I wrapped in foil, then was interrupted and had to leave them til the nest day. They still peeled easily and did not fall apart. I find it very hard to do under the broiler in the oven without overcooking the peppers. Pepin peels raw peppers with a vegetable peeler. Some of you might try that but you would not have the lovely steamed flavor.

I made these last nite, and as I was making them I thought "I don't care how great these are, they are too much work!" But I have to say they were so delish I will def make them again. I followed the suggestion to cut the stems off and seed the peppers before roasting. I was very careful to just thoroughly blister the skin so the peppers wouldn't cook too much. They held up very well and were easy to stuff. Lots of people said the filling was dull, so instead of mashing black beans I mixed one can black beans with one can vegetarian black refried beans - nicely seasoned. I put a chunk of mexican quesadilla cheese inside each pepper instead of grating it on top (more like a real chile relleno!). I thought the onions would be a waste of time, but they were a lovely compliment. I served these with fresh salsa, homemade corn tortillas and tropical fruit margaritas. We both thought this meal was awesome!

I selected this recipe because I love Chiles rellenos but wanted a healthier, baked version. This seemed to fit the bill, and I did as one reader suggested, and cut out the stem and stuffed through the hole (would never work for a traditional deep- fried relleno! Two modifications: The beauty of rellenos to me is that when you cut into them, the hot cheese oozes out onto your plate. Yum! So, I stuffed in little cubes of Monterey Jack along with the beans intead of sprinkling on top, and it was perfect. I also did something that upped the calorie count a little, but is the way my favorite rellenos are served at a local restaurant: mix low-fat sour cream with a little low-sodium chicken broth. When the rellenos are done, top with the sauce and scatter a few chopped pecans around, and return to the oven just until the sauce is warm. Serve with brown rice and sliced avocados. Yum!

I thought this turned out great - one of those recipes that is even better as a leftover than it is the first day. I added brown rice and pico and cilantro. I won't add the cilantro next time though.

i added cubed chicken and a little lime juice to the beans and increased onions. made sure to add plenty of pepper. it was great. i will definitely experiment with more stuffed chiles in the future. i love chiles rellenos, but only at a local restaurant that gets the breading reallly thin and uses vegetable oil to fry. also i found it extremely easy to peel the chiles... as long as they are broiled correctly...

My husband, who I can never get to eat healthy, loves it. Just don;t tell him it's good for him. OK?

I thought it was too much trouble than it was worth. Peeling the peppers took me forever and it was very boring. Not enough spice for my taste.

Yuck. I followed the instructions to the letter and could barely eat this. I found it too spicy and not tasty at all. My husband liked it but he'll eat pretty much anything.

Didn't bother making this lower fat version, but used regular cheese and sour cream. Otherwise, followed it exactly. I liked it, my husband loved it. Was skeptical about the minimal seasoning in the beans, but it worked after baking and the flavors blended. Be aware that poblanos range from mild to very spicy, and the ones we used included the whole range.

My husband and I love mexican food and this was excellent. I made a few adjustments - I roasted some garlic and added a few cloves and some cilantro to 1/2 the beans and then processed in the food processor. I would definitely make it again. We loved the carmalized onions (I doubled the amount).

Not being a fan of Monterrey Jack cheese, I used peppered havarti. Asiago would also be a good choice. Made a hit as a side dish at my house on taco night. . .

i've made this several times and it keeps getting better. i add a bit more to the stuffing than the recipe calls for...diced jalapenos or serranos, cilantro, maybe some brown rice. highly recommended. great for left-overs.

I served this with spanish rice and did not make the onions, also could not find reduced-fat monterey jack so I used the real deal. It added back a little fat but what an easy and delicious meal! Will make again.

I have made this dish a number of times because I love it for leftovers for lunch. If I am not serving it to company, I don't bother with stuffing the peppers. I just cut the peppers in half and layer the dish with onions, peppers, beans, and cheese and cook it like a layered casserole. It is much easier and tastes the same.

My husband and I really liked this. We got a hold of some extra spicy poblanos from the farmer's market, so the amount of heat was quite a surprise. We served this with chipotle rice and refried beans, and it was a great meal. And those onions...yum!

Had a great taste - would spice it up a little more next time. Added mexican flavored shredded soy cheese in place of the monterey jack. Would definitely make again! My husband loved it.

After having made this a few times, here's my way of dealing with the peppers: First, seed them by cutting around the stem and pulling it out (along with most of the seeds). Second, char the peppers under the broiler (or over your gas stove), but make sure they char just until the skin blisters otherwise the skins will burn into the pepper flesh. Third, stick them in a large bowl covered with a dish towel for a few minutes to cool. Finally, peel the skins off gently and stuff the filling into the open end. I find this easier than the suggested way. Also, I just tried adding some broiled plantain to the beans - awesome!

I really liked the flavors in this recipe but I did not use low-fat cheese. To the disappointed cook from NJ - My pablonos feel apart too - I just simply made layers like a casserole instead of stuffing the chilies indiviudally and it came out great. I added a little extra Cayenne too.

This is a great recipe, I thought the filling was perfect. I mixed the black beans with a little spicy encilada sauce, and I poured some of the enchilada sauce over the whole thing before I baked it. I served it with mexican rice and corn, a great meal!

Delicious. Added chopped garlic cloves, cumin, chili powder, cumin to the beans, plus some canned corn. Might try meat addition next time. Poblanos are a pain to peel/seed. They were very delicate, but not impossible. End result...worth it. Delicious. Carmelized onions are awesome.

I was very excited to try this recipe after reading all of the good reviews of it. However, after making it, I was quite disappointed in the final result. The roasted poblanos did fall apart and thus were difficult to work with. The beans were so-so, and I never thought I would say it, but the onions were "too much" (and I adore onions!). This is one less recipe for my file. And all that coming from a Texas native who loves spicy food.

I loved this recipe. I will definately be making it again! I like to make extra and take it in my lunch the next day. It reheats very well.

I also ended up changing quite a few things, although this recipe was definately the inspiration (I had never made chiles rellenos before). I layered and baked the chilis as in the recipe, only I stuffed them with a mixture of cream cheese and monterey jack cheese, placed the peppers seal side up on the onions, and covered them with a black bean/chicken/onion/ mushroom/taco seasoning mixture. Topped off the whole thing with a good layer of m. jack cheese and baked for about 20 minutes. Wonderful! I think we'll keep it as our "standard" chile relleno recipe!

Excellent! The sweetness of the onions played off the heat of the chili. A great combo and being able to prep it ahead of time is a bonus!

Really good! I love the reviews, because they offer so many helpful alternatives. Added oregano, cumin, garlic and chili powder to the beans before mashing them (as suggested by one cook). I omitted the carmelized onions because the boyfriend doesn't like onions (what a wierd-o, ha!). Followed the comment of another cook and smeared enchilada sauce in the pan instead, and then set the chilis - with the addition of chicken - on top.

I changed this recipe a lot but I still must credit the original for its success. I bought some peppers at a farm stand; I have no idea what type they were but the farmer said they weren't hot. I steamed them as suggested by one reviewer (don't trust myself around an open flame). I stuffed them with a mixture of diced cooked chicken thighs (skinless, boneless, 'poached' in the asian manner), black beans (1/2 tin), cubed queso fresca, garlic, and a hint of ground cumin. No salt; the cheese is salty enough. I smeared some tinned enchilada sauce in the baking pan instead of onions, set the stuffed onions on top, and then drizzled a few more tablespoons of enchilada sauce on top. Then, sprinkled about a scant cup of grated Monterey Jack cheese on top and baked for 25-30 minutes at 375. Served with rice cooked in the chicken poaching water and seasoned with chili powder (1 tsp) and ground cumin (1/4 tsp). I am inspired to try other stuffings (and isn't that what cooking's all about? trying new things?)

This was really tasty (I too added to the beans - cumin, garlic, chili powder). Great meatless dish, though I could see adding chicken in the future to "beef" it up a little. The only drawback was peeling the peppers and keeping them from tearing, but I'll be working on perfecting some sort of technique as I will be making this often!

This just has great flavor! I add oregano, cumin, garlic and chili powder to the beans before mashing them. These are a mainstay at my house!

I developed a recipe similar to this a few years ago for a husband who loves pablanos but not the traditional rellenos that are fried. I make a small cut across the top of the pepper and then length wise to make seeding easier. I then steam the peppers for 7 to 10 minutes instead of roasting. You can then get creative with your ingrediants. I stuffed with everything from chicken, to shrimp and crab. Be sure to wear gloves when seeding peppers.

Definetly add chicken to this dish. It adds just the needed flavor.

I thought these were really delicious. I ended up using anaheim chilies since my local grocery didn't have poblanos. the only problem I found was that the chilies got too mushy from the broiling, maybe that won't be the case if I use poblano chilies which I like more anyways.

I would make this again with some modifications. I couldn't find poblanos (used anaheims), but I think the problem was the overwhelming flavor of all those onions. I added cumin in addition to the cayenne in the filling, but still tasted too much onion.

Though the poblano peppers were hot, the dish was pretty good. Added fresh corn kernels to the stuffing and it turned out quite well.

Recipe was pretty good. I felt it needed texture in filling so I added chopped tomamtoes and steamed rice. Peppers have a hot but mild flavor. Good as a side dish, but not intersting enough for a main entree.

We have been making this dish for years. We love it. Try adding crushed garlic to the beans. For a presentation for those that must have something resembling meat use Textured Vegetable Protein in the beans as well.

This is really quite good. I substituted chilies similar to poblano (don't remember the name) that were milder according to the produce person since the store didn't have poblanos.

I have been making this with fresh Anaheim chiles from my garden with great results. Adding steamed leftover rice to the bean mixture adds another layer of texture. A favorite in my house!

This recipe is delicious and much easier and more nutrious than the original Chili Rellenos. As a vegetarian, it's great to find recipes that we can serve to our non-veggie friends without them turning up their noses.
