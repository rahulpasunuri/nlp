The only thing I had to omit was the fresh basil because I didn't have any on hand. This dish was delicious without it. Would definitely make again.

Made this again tonight for a quick and easy summer dinner. I grated the zucchinis based on others' suggestions. Since this is such a versatile recipe, I omitted anchovies (we're vegetarian) and the mint (not a fan with pasta). I sort of consider this a rustic pesto.

I made this last night and it was delicious! I did not have any walnuts, zucchini flowers or anchoies so they were omitted. Will definitely make again when I have all the ingrediants on hand; although I may omit the mint (tasted odd to me). This was terrific the next day - cold (the minus anchovy & walnut version).

Very, very good even without zucchini flowers. I cut the zukes in 1/2 lengthwise to make 2.5" - 3" lengths, then sliced on mandoline. Actually followed the recipe close to the letter except using 1/2 the amount of pasta called for and less EVOO. Perfect, easy, and very FRESH tasting.

I forgot to add that I did try pine nuts instead of walnuts once (based on a suggestion of a friend when I served it). It works, especially if it's the only thing you have on hand (be sure to toast them, too), but the walnut texture is really more interesting. Also, for the garlic I've started using a zester instead of a garlic press. It almost purees the garlic which allows it to distribute more evenly than pressed or chopped garlic (stole this idea from the silly Rachael Ray show).

I love this dish! I always forget to get anchovies, so I substitute fish sauce instead which works well. I like to add extra garlic, too, since I'm a big garlic fan. The way I peel the zucchini it ends up being about the same width and close to the same length as the fettuccine so it almost seems like a green noodle (do make sure you squeeze the water out - I skipped that step once, and it all globbed together into a big ball that wouldn't separate).

These flavors worked nicely together, but I wasn't the biggest fan of the large zucchini ribbons. Maybe I just needed to pick smaller zucchinis, but I'll probably just cut them up next time. The only substitution I made was using toasted pine nuts in lieu of walnuts. The recipe is nice in that the ingredients don't need to be meticulously measured, its an easy one to just throw together.

Very good. This will be an excellent way to use up zucchini at the end of the summer. Will definitely be making this one again.

Delicious and great if you're short on time. We use pecorino rather than parmesan and pile it on. Great way to use the tons zucchini my friends give me. My family is tired of all the variations on zucchini bread.

Excellent and easy recipe! I was short on time and did not have the freshest zucchini, so I thinly sliced it into rounds and sauteed it in some olive oil. Did not use mint either. Came out great and very flavorful.

One small change: prior to tossing in with the pasta, we quartered the zucchini slices--cut lengthwise, then in half--to make better bite sizes. I would not have liked it with the whole slices. I also went light on the mint. We really enjoyed it! The anchovy and nuts are a great combination.

I've planted way to many zucchini this year so have been experimenting with "Z" recipes. This is the best to far. Expanded it by adding chicken slices flavored with garam masala, a few artichoke hearts, and bell pepper medley.

I used way too much garlic and I also used parmesan instead of pecorino, plus I didn't have any walnuts so I used a bunch of other nuts. I think if you follow this recipe exactly it would be super kick-ass, but it's pretty good with parmesan as well.

I liked the recipe but did not use the mint. I would agree with other critics on the grating zucchini. I did cook the zucchini a bit before adding to pasta. My husband hated the pecorino romano. It is sheep cheese and if you get the real italian stuff it is very pungent. My husband said it smelled like a goat farm. He would not eat it.

Rating: 2
This is a simple, no-fuss recipe that can be great if you're using high-quality ingredients. It's a bit oily for my liking (walnuts, olive oil, AND romano in the same recipe is a bit much), but it's easy to throw together and very satisfying.

My favorite zucchini pasta recipe: Cut two zucchini in half lenghtwise, in half again, and then cut into slices about 1/4 inch wide. Preheat a large nonstick skillet with a couple tablespoons olive oil over medium heat. Add a few peeled, whole garlic cloves and brown but be careful not to burn. Then add the zucchini and sautee until nicely browned, stirring frequently. This takes about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, cook whatever kind of pasta you like. Put the pasta in a bowl and drizzle with a good bit of high quality olive oil and sprinkle with Italian seasoning and a little bit of red peper flakes. Toss and then top with the zucchini. It's good wih some parmesan cheese on top and a glass of Chardonnay.

So I wrote that I would not make this recipe again, and I should say that its because I like my zucchini recipe that I learned from my Italian exchange student a long time ago much much better. See my other review for the recipe (it wouldn't fit here). It's simpler, cheaper, and probably healthier. So I bought the ingredients for this receipe before reading the prep directions. It's really not a god idea to do that, just like it's really not a good idea to cook with zucchini and basil in February. But oh, well. When I got home, I was so sceptical about the whole not cooking the zucchini thing that I almost didn't make the recipe. It actually works, though, to not cook the zucchini. I agree with other people that it would be much easier to make this recipe with a mandoline rather than with a vegetable peeler. I do have to say, however, that zucchini usually needs a little help in the flavor department, and it doesn't get any here. The zucchini adds a freshness to the pasta, but the pasta doesn't taste very zucchini-ish. So overall, I think that this pasta is tasty, and it would be a nice dish to make in the summer because it doesn't require standing over the stove for a long time, and the ingredients are very seasonal. However, I also think that it's a little bit heavy for a summer pasta dish. I may borrow the ceasar salad kind of prep idea for another pasta application. I also agee that the recipe is good the next day, which is unusual for a pasta dish.

I made this recipe so I could use my new mandolin to make the zucchini ribbons. My sister and I loved the recipe! I left out the mint because neither of us likes it. I set the mandolin at one- sixteenth of an inch and I think that made all the difference. The nearly translucent slices of zucchini "cooked" when added to the hot fettucine and additional pasta water. Yum!

We've tried the recipe multiple times and found it much easier to grate the zucchini (with a cuisinart). We also left out the mint and substituted parmesan for the pecornino romano. We found the romano to be too salty. The recipe is a hit with the entire family.

My husband commented "one of the best new dishes we've tried lately" - i have to agree. I did not put the mint in it, and used toasted pignoli instead. Used less oil and a little more cheese. there were no leftovers!

My family really liked this dish. It wasn't easy to slice the zucchini thinly (I have a cheap mandolin), which was the only thing that created any difficulty. It was a very pretty dish, great for a summer evening.

This sounded interesting, but the mint was overwhelming. I cut down on the amount of zucchini, but there was still too much of it. I eventually ended up throwing out a big bowl of the leftovers.

This was tasty and I liked the flavors and textures together. Very summery and fun. I struggled with the zucchini and would recommend a Mandolin slicer to get it really thin. It's not nearly as good if they come out bulky.

I made the recipe exactly as written, omitting the optional zucchini flowers. My husband and I really enjoyed it. It's a fast weekday meal. If you have one, use a mandoline for the zucchini ribbons to make preparation quicker.

No relation to the other posted from Boston, but I'd have to agree. Thought it might be an interesting combo, but it didn't work for us. The mint seemed too strong and it didn't taste that good as leftovers either. The zucchini shavings is an interesting technique that I might reuse though.

I agree with the cook from Boston, strange, bland and uninteresting. My husband didn't like it either. He thought the basil overwhelmed the dish. I won't be making this again.

I really didn't like the flavor of the mint the night I made this recipe. It mellowed when I heated the leftovers, so I liked it better, but all in all it was a strange combo of bland and unpleasant. Won't make it again.

I made this dish with great trepidation as the thought of uncooked zucchini,mint, basil and garlic together did not appeal to me. However, it was very tasty!I used alittle more cheese than was called for and alittle less oil

This was excellent. I don't often make meatless dishes but I have a vegetarian sister-in-law so was trying to find something yummy to prepare without meat. A wonderful combination of flavors! I'll definitely make it again.

I thought this was just OK. Instead of using a vegetable peeler to make ribbons out of the zucchini, I used my food processor to shred the zucchini (much easier). I don't think doing this compromised the taste of the dish, but it did probably change the texture. This isn't why I rated the dish only two forks, however; I just thought the taste of the dish wasn't that special.

Love the flavors -- agree that anchovy paste is an easier option - I did that too. The only thing that I'd change would be the zucchini prep -- I might chop. While I like the noodle-like method as a look -- I think more "bite" on them would be nice. Also -- just a little less work. Might cut it in half as well -- LOTS of pasta here!

I thought this was an odd combination of ingredients, but since I had them all, I gave it a try. I omitted the mint, didn't include extra olive oil at the end (didn't think it needed) and added chunks of cooked sweet italian turkey sausage to make it a bit heartier...it complimented it deliciously! The basil and walnuts were fabulous in this dish....and as they do with caesar dressing, the few anchovies added that "special" depth and flavor. I will definitely be making this again soon and would recommend!

All five of us loved this pasta. The only change I made was to use 1 tablespoon of anchovy paste instead of the anchovy fillets, and omit the final dollop of olive oil. The flavors were well balanced and the pasta was immensely satisfying. My guest took home the recipe.

I must admit that I used parmesan cheese for this recipe, and I also eyed the olive oil, cutting way back on the instructed amount. This was very tasty and satisfying. I have never had zucchini salted and prepared like this. Outstanding! I will definitely make this again.

A different and refreshing way to utilize the abundancy of summer zucchini. There's a lot of different flavors working at the same time. I would recommend adding only the olive oil to taste as well as the water. I found that I needed very little of each to make it to the consistency that I desired. I would definitely pay attention to making the zucchini ribbons correctly as it helps with the overall texture of the dish. I did add some tomato to add some color.

I too used less zuccchini than was called for--one pound seemed like plenty. My only complaint was that this was a little oily for me. I used all the olive oil called for and was sorry--will use less next time.

This is an excellent recipe; what a great combination of flavors! I used anchovy paste in place of the whole fillets, since I always keep a tube on hand so I don't have to open a whole can of anchovies. To the cook who asked if it came out too dry: I didn't think so; it seemed just right to me. I guess it's a personal taste thing, though. You can always add a bit more of the pasta water and/or olive oil if you think it needs it.
