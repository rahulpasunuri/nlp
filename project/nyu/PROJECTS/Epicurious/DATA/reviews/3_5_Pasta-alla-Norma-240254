1 pound of pasta is waaay too much for four servings, and for the amount of veg. Use a fraction of that and it'll be delicious.

Very disappointed in this recipe considering the many good reviews...flavor was just okay...really needed more spice-wise...would not make again. Did add some sauteed red onion in it, but that couldn't save it.

Such an easy peasy delicious dish! I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned, and white wine instead of white wine vinegar. Also, as others have suggested, crushed red pepper worked perfectly for the dried red chili. I will be making this as long as eggplant is in season. Yum!

This dish was very bland. I was short on basil, but I don't believe that would have saved it entirely. There's definitely a need for tomato paste for a flavor and texture boost.

Thank you Jamie for an easy & delicious eggplant dish. I replaced the linguine with orecchiette or you could try farfalle. I liked adding the chopped basil stems, really tasty. I'll look forward to making it again soon.

Loved it. I sprayed a cookie sheet and put the eggplants on that and sprayed them with olive oil and broiled them till they were looking done. Got fresh Basil from my neighbor and some local fresh eggplant. I used white wine vinegar. Quick and easy! Gotta like that.

Not being a huge eggplant fan, I was skeptical, but it turned out really great. We only used one eggplant, and used fresh oregano as well as dried, and used white wine vinegar instead of herb. Beware of how much oil the eggplant will soak up at first!! Don't feel like you need to add moreit will eventually come out of the eggplant as you cook.

Very good! We used one whole Jamaican hot pepper and boy did that spice it up. Lots of fresh basil AND parsley to overcome eggplant's natural tendency towards blandness. Even better after it sat overnight. Also, we used goat feta cheese and sprinkled some romano in place of the ricotta/parmesan.

OK. Kind of bland, maybe because I used dried basil as fresh is not in season. Maybe a splash of red wine or some chopped anchovies would give it more of a kick.

This recipe was unclear, having you divide the ingredients and not specifying when to put the second half in the pot. Also, it says it makes 4 servings when it is more like 10. And finally, this dish was very uninteresting considering the time it took to make it. I had to cook the eggplant in four batches, and the complete cook time was an hour.

Really good! I didn't think I liked eggplant, but I really enjoyed this recipe. The vinegar does give it a bit of a interesting kick... I'm going to have to try that in other pasta dishes. I forgot to add the basil and I didn't add cheese, but it was still delicious. The only negative was that it's a bit on the greasy side... probably because of all the oil needed to sautee the eggplant. Maybe I'll grill it or broil the eggplant (before adding it to the sauce) next time to cut down on the oil

I made this last night. As my husband ate this these were his comments..."This is very nice" then "This is very good" then "This is top rate" "Definately have this again' I guess its a keeper!

Fantastic dish. I used crushed red pepper instead of a chili pepper and used red wine vinegar instead of white. You need to add salt to this dish to pump up the flavor a bit. Also, the second time I made it - I used pressed/crushed tomatoes instead of diced so that the sauce would be a thicker sauce. Great both times.

I needed a simple recipe to use up the surplus tomatoes and eggplant from my garden. This did the trick and will be added to my box of "keeper" recipes. The herb vinegar was a nice touch.

Ah, lovely..! This is so simple, so easy (you can't fail), perfect as it is or great as a base for a lot of other things. I added some chicken and had it with spaghetti and fresh white bread - that's perfection, actually.

Very tasty! Good balance of eggplant to tomato. I was worried it would be too "tomato-y" as I'm not always a fan, but the basil made it work. I couldn't taste the oregano, maybe I didn't use enough (eyeballed it). I used queso fresco for the cheese because it was all I had, I'd probably use fresh parm next time. All in all, fairly simple and super tasty! Oh, and filling!

A keeper. We love eggplant in this house, and this is our favorite recipe for it lately. The dish is down-home enough for everyday but exquisite enough for company. We've made it several times and it's always a hit. If salted ricotta isn't available, I've found that dribbling a few chunks of fresh/traditional ricotta works splendidly.

I liked this... I used too much oil and too much basil though, I think, because it ended up being too sweet for my taste and a bit too oily. Just soaked up that extra oil with cheese though, yum yum!

Very tasty, the vinegar adds a nice kick. Great and different way to use eggplant.

I used only one eggplant and some whole canned tomatoes that I pureed. I threw in a little sauteed green onion, yellow onion, fennel, oregano, extra basil and garlic, and put out the pasta and sauce in separate dishes. The kids loved it just as much as the adults. This was good for lunch the next day without any pasta as well. Yum!

For the record, though I didn't have any eggplant, and went ahead and tried the frying of basil stems, oregano, and wine vinegar, then simmering with garlic and basil leaves - goodness, was this delicious.

One of the most excellent recipes while at the same time totally simple and not time consuming at all. Made it several times now. Easily varied, too. In my experience, basil stems can get woody after a while if you grow it yourself and keep pinching the top leaves off. They're never tough when using freshly bought.

This was fabulous- took me straight back to my days in Sicily. I prepared the recipe as written, and it came out wonderfully.

really easy and fast to make. its a good base for any pasta recipe, and can be easily modified if you are missing, or want to add more ingredients

Hadn't read the reviews before I cooked this. Don't know what all the fuss is about the basil stems, since mincing them finely like the recipe instructs, took care of any problems with thick stems. I also liked the "finger" shape of the eggplant, and would vote against cutting into cubes. Didn't have a dried chili so threw in a good dash of red pepper flakes that gave it a little bite. Make this is you love Italy and eggplant!

Very good. I skipped the stems and cut the eggplant into chunks.

My family really liked this. I did use the basil stems, and thought they added a nice punch to the sauce. Not sure how basil stems would be "woody", mine were quite soft. I really like the way Oliver writes his recipes. He writes very much how I cook. Simple, delicious weeknight meal. I also added a splash of red wine to the sauce.

For such a quick recipe, this was outstanding... I didn't bother with the basil stems after reading the other reviews and I don't think they were missed at all. It had tons of flavor... I did add a pretty hearty pinch of red pepper flakes though. If you love good simple italian cooking this recipe is for you... just remember that good quality ingredients make all the difference. Enjoy!

I thought this was delicious and simple. Next time I would cut the eggplant into cubes instead of "fingers" and would mince instead of slice the garlic. I added a pinch of cayenne pepper instead of the chili which gave just a little kick. The basil stems were omitted since it seemed a little odd. I did add the basil leaves. It's a great vegetarian meal.

I thought this was disappointing, not up to the usual Gourmet scratch. While I enjoy Jamie Oliver's charisma and fun style, the recipe is terribly slapdash, and lacked Gourmet's usual precision. For one example, the basil stems never really cooked down enough, so there were unpleasantly woody bits in the sauce. It just felt not quite right to me, and there are a million better pasta recipes out there (try anything from Marcella Hazan, for example).

Fab and fast. I did not have oregano, but it still came out lovely. I used Glen Muir organic fire roasted diced tomatoes, which added a smoky complexity. I liked the touch of the herbed vinegar, I happened to have Tarragon and it went well.The basil stems and eggplant gave this recipe distinction, but it's a great base for a range of modifications.
