I'm glad I tried this recipe for dinner. I cooked it as in the recipe, but added onions with the apples. It was delicious. A quick and easy weeknight dinner.

Very good and pretty quick. I considered leaving out the vinegar but thought the sauce was a little bland and we preferred it with the little bit of sourness. I had apple juice, not cider, in the house and I ended up adding extra apple juice (and boiling it down) to get enough apple flavor. Next time I make it, if I use apple juice again I'll do all apple juice and no broth.

unbelievably good. Per other reviewers, I left out the vinegar.

This was great and fairly easy to fix. I mixed a little corn starch with cool water into the sauce to get it to thicken. I would leave out the vinegar at the end and maybe even add a little sugar if I cook this again.

I prepared the tenderloin the same way as in the "pork tenderloin with pears/mustard/port sauce" recipe from this site, then cooked the apples in the same pan while the medallions rested. I find that the pork is more tender when prepared this way and it gives the sauce a little more flavor too. Yum! Served with rice pilaf

I actually enjoyed this recipe very much. I left out the vinegar per a lot of people's comments, and it worked well. I also made this with the sweet potato puree with smoked paprika (another Epi recipe) and they paired wonderfully. I noticed a lot of people complained that the pork recipe didn't have enough flavor, but the smoked paprika sweet potatoes definitely offset that risk.

Recipe was easy to make, used Fuji apples that I had on hand and used one tenderloin. Good taste and would make this again. My favorite tenderloin recipe is still the salt and pepper crusted on this site.

Rating: 3
Good recipe. Used a single pork tenderloin, about 1.2 lb., instead of the two smaller ones called for in the recipe, and used a single, large Stayman apple in place of the two Grannies. Left out the vinegar on the advice of other reviewers, but next time may try this with one tablespoon of vinegar. I advise removing the meat from the oven when the internal temperature hits 150F.

This was actually a good, quick recipe. I didn't have arrowroot, so I used flour to thicken. This probaby did not cause the sauce to thicken as well, but it was still good. This was quite a quick recipe and I don't quite understand how it would take more than 45 minutes to cook. If you're looking for something quick, be sure to use pork tenderloin and not a regular pork loin roast.

This was terrible, took way longer than the 45 minutes, and it the sauce would not thicken...

It is not often that you find a recipe as light and flavorful as this  not to mention quick to throw together. Used cornstarch in place of arrowroot; used only 1 tsp. of vinegar, not 2; and used apple juice instead of cider. Cooked some Russian banana fingerling potatoes with the roast. Simply fantastic - entire family raved about it.

I've made a lot of similar recipes with pork tenderloin so I figured I would like this. I was right. I also didn't use flower and just reduced the sauce. And, because of a lot of the other feedback (and the fact that my boyfriend hates vinegar), I left out the vinegar. I wouldn't say that this is a company-worthy dish, but I liked it for an easy weeknight dinner.

This recipe was excellent! I reduced the amount of vineger by half, and added some caramelized yellow onions to the apples and sauce - wow! I served it with grilled polenta and wilted garlic spinach (with some of the sauce/apples/onions spooned over the polenta. Simple, terrific fall weather comfort food. Definately a keeper.

Rating: 3
This was a great simple recipe. Maybe I would cook the apples longer. I made the recipe with a boneless poirk loin roast rather than a tenderlolin and adjusted the roasting time accordingly but otherwise made the recipe verbatim. No, I don't think 2 tsp of quality cider vinegar overpowers the dish.

Rating: 1
I made this recipe as directed and the vinegar made the sauce sour and decidedly NOT tasty. I notice people who have rated this recipe highly omitted the vinegar, which must be the thing to do if you want a delicious dish. Or, if I do try this again, I will mix the vinegar with honey and add gradually, to taste.

We made this last night, and it was simply PHENOMENAL. I personally think it may be one of the best meals I've ever cooked. However, I did make a few changes, following some of the earlier suggestions in reviews. First, I left the pork in the oven for about twenty minutes, which I definitely advise! Second, I used a little extra butter for sauteeing the apples, and added in about a quarter cup of brandy after they had begun to brown. I also sprinkled them with a bit of allspice, cinnamon and brown sugar. Finally, when the sauce had almost finished bubbling down, I tasted it and was so amazed by the flavor that I omitted the cider vinegar entirely. This recipe was delicious!

While the apples didn't really get brown (like in the picture), they tasted pretty good on the pork that tasted amazing. Oddly enough, the store had just run out of pork tenderloin so I bought boneless pork chops. From now on I think I will always finish a pork chop in the oven. Skipped the vinegar as previous reviewers suggested. This dish was loved by my husband and my 11 month-old.

My husband and I finished a large tenderloin ourselves! My husband told me at least three times that the recipe was "super good"! I used regular apple cider (couldn't find unfiltered) and cornstarch (couldn't find arrowroot) for thickening the sauce. I also added about half a teaspoon brown sugar when cooking the apples. Served with polenta, which was a wonderful compliment to the recipe.

Easy, good, tender. Cooked to 155 degrees, still quite pink after slicing. Needed at least another 10 minutes.

While dish was "ok", it was nothing to rave about. Easy preparation though required more cooking time then recipe suggests. No dancing tastebuds here!

It was wonderful!! I did reduce the cider vinegar as suggested by others. It also works well served with sauerkraut. Terrific paired with the dry riesling we had.

I'd like to give this 2-1/2 forks. The pork was excellent (esp. with the addition of rosemary, garlic and mustard, as suggested by a reviewer), moist and flavorful, and the sauteed apples were quite good. The sauce, however, was completely forgettable--just tasted hot cider, nothing else. Next time, I'll skip the sauce.

A superb pork tenderloin recipe, will definetly make this again. My husband loved it. I took previous reviewers' suggestions and skipped the vinegar, but I did add brandy to the broth and cider step. I, too, don't have arrowroot around, so I mixed a little flour and water to add body to the reduction. This turned out to be a keeper and didn't take me more than 35-40 minutes from start to finish.

I've made this twice - without salt and without onion (for special diets). I give it extra pepper, and we don't miss the salt. It's fast, tasty and makes a beautiful presentation. The second time I cut the apples thicker than called for. They brown beautifully in the pan (I use a cast iron skillet). I arrange them in a herringbone pattern on the serving platter and put the sliced tenderloin on top of it, then pour the sauce over it. Very showy. The meat is moist and flavorful. I think giving it a good browning in the pan before it goes in the oven adds flavor. Agree about reducing the vinegar, and I think I'll skip it next time.

This is a keeper. Easy to make and tasty as well. I followed the advise of the other reviewers by adding some shallots and rosemary. Also doubled the amount of apples(be sure to slice thin, the apples take longer to cook than specifed, about 15 min.) and subsituted arrowood with corn starch. I only used 1 tbp of vinegar, next time will cut it down to 1 tsp(it goes a long way) and a touch of marsala wine. I served the dish with baked sweet potaoes and a nice Cabernet.My boyfriend LOVED it!!

Really liked this alot! Cut some slits in the pork and filled with a mixture of garlic, rosemary and honey dijon mustard. Then proceeded as directed, adding rosemary and onions as others have done. Served with steamed baby red potatoes and sauteed spinach with garlic and lemon. Definitely will make again!

I substituted corn starch for arrowroot, and apple juice for apple cider. I loved this recipe, and I thought the apples went wonderfully with the pork tenderloin. I will be making this again soon!

Good family dinner. I sauteed some shallots after removing the apples, then deglazed the pan with a generous tablespoon of Calvados. I finished the dish with some fresh thyme as well.

Excellent. Made a few changes based on reviews and my taste. Used Macintosh apples and unfiltered apple juice instead of recommended. Added 1/2 teaspoon of crushed rosemary. Reduced sauce without arrowroot. Will be making again soon. Who knew lo cal could be so good.

This was a very good dish...I used thick boneless pork chops instead of a tenderloin because there are only 2 of us. Next time I'll use a sweeter apple, I found the granny smith a bit tart for the sauce. But all in all it was yummy and I'll make it again.

Good family dinner as it is easy to serve the kids their portions without the sauce. The sauce is a little bland, but still tasty. Bottom line -good for everyday, not special enough for company.

Substituted corn starch for arrowroot and regular vinegar for apple cider vinegar. I found the sauce to be extremely sweet, so I added some sauteed red onions, which were a good addition. This dish is fairly mild, but my guests and I still liked it.

I love this recipe and make it all the time although I do substitute pork chops most of the time. There is alot of flavor here with a lot of fat. Great receipe.

The recipe was okay. The dish itself needed a little bit more flavor, but if you enjoy a mild-tasting sauce with your pork tenderloin it is great. I didn't find that it was very messy, and I actually cooked the pork in a cast iron skillet on the grill and it came out delicious.

Rating: 3
I added the apple and shallot as suggested by someone else. It was really good! The vinegar is slightly too dominant. I'm going to try 1/2 cider vinegar and 1/2 apple juice or cider next time. I expect this will bring my rating to 4 forks.

I thought that this was an excellent fall/winter dish. I added some interest by carmelizing the apples with shallots and adding sage. Instead of using the arrowroot, I reduced the sauce which made it a bit more elegant. This recipe is defintely a keeper!

This was way too much trouble much for something that was merely okay. Not only did it take forever, but it made my house smell like a fast-food place for two days. The end result was nothing special, the apples were tasty but the pork just didn't do it for me. Also, the pork takes way longer to reach 155 degrees than 15 minutes. It took me almost half an hour. It was knida bland. I won't be making this again. There are other healthy recipes with a lot more taste.

This is a nice fall dish to make with pork tenderloin. The pork turns out nice and juicy and the recipe is easy. It is nice for a weeknight meal but I don't think that it is special enough for company.

Really quite good, and so easy! I think it lacked a little punch, some spice was missing, don't know what. But really yummy. A great comfort food, after a brisk walk in the chill.

Wonderful! I added 2/3 cup of dried cherries to the sauce and sliced apples very thin. I was concerned in taking tenderloin out of oven at 155 degrees - but in the 15 minute setting time, it came up to the right "pork" tempature. I'm going to prepare it again, for a Christmas dinner party in Dec.

This was the first pork tenderloin I've ever made and the results were better than I imagined. The pork was slightly rosy in the center and very juicy, the sauce was rich with a nice tang from the cider, and the apples were a perfect mellow- sweet match. Delicious! My boyfriend loved it.

This is great. Can use boneless chops also. My husband has lost over 175 pounds in 11 months and the monthly light complete meal in Gourmet is something we both look forward to as a way to increase our repetoire of light but delicious foods. This one is definitely in the top 5 recipes for this past year. Thanks!!!

This set off two smoke detectors and made a mess of the range top and oven. The clean-up took longer than the preparation, and the result was just okay. There are other pork tenderloin recipes that I prefer.

What a great fall recipe! Save a step by leaving the apples unpeeled-I used a firm red apple and sliced very thin. Delicious.

You could make the sauce in advance, I didn't realize that at the time. I had 9 guests - and they all thought it was delicious. A great simple recipe and I highly recommend it.

I rated this a four forker because it was so simple to make, delicious, and my entire family ate it (even my three children who are VERY picky eaters ate it). The pork came out just right (I cooked it just until it was 155 degrees). The sauce was outstanding and although I would probably cut the apple slices even thinner next time, I thought the apples were great too. Considering this is a low fat/low cal dinner I will most definitely make this again!

Simple, fast, low cal. I added dried cherries for color and served with roasted sweet potatoes and onion. Perfect for weeknight dinner.
