This is one of my go-to summer salads. I make it over and over because it holds well in the fridge and I often add a protein for lunch the next day. However, I use couscous rather than bulgur. I think that is the key to keeping it light. Other vegetables can be added like cukes and red bell pepper, although it is fine as written.

I made this a bunch the last two summers...I use quinoa instead of bulgur, which is delicious! Usually skip the parsley b/c we are not fans, but I love the flavor of the mint and definitely keep that in. Often add more zest and lemon juice than called for, and play with the salt, but my better half and I really love this one!

Either cut the bulgur in half or double the parsley and lemon juice. As written, the salad lacks acidity and brightness.

A perfect light and fresh meal for summer. I didn't use much of the salt. Also, save the lemon rinds and put them in a glass of ice water to help complete the meal.

Simple, quick, and made with ingredients that I always have on hand--this one is a keeper! Next time I might add some garlic or swap the mint for basil, but the basic recipe is fine.

This is one of my favourites. It's so easy, so tasty and so completely guilt-free! I don't bother with salt, but add chopped garlic, red peppers and increase the parsley & mint.

I liked everything but the bulgar -- way, way too much salt in the recipe. I tried to balance it out with more parsley and lemon juice, but it still flopped. It got tried at dinner, but no one went for a full serving.

I've made this dish three times, and it's been a hit with guests and family. I omit the mint, and I have substituted green peas for the garbanzo beans. Using frozen peas, I just toss them in while the bulgur is soaking; they add great color.

Very good! Didn't have garbanzo bean so I used a mixed bean can. I used no.1 bulgur and was a little soggy, next time will use less water. A keeper...

The second time I made this it was not good. Somehow the herb combination gave it a solvent flavor. We won't try it again.

A wonderful change from the usual tabbouleh. Perfect for a hot summer night. For those demanding meat, it compliments grilled lamb perfectly.

Try this with couscous made according to package directions. I make this salad several times a month and it lends itself to whatever extra ingredients are on hand.

Haven't made this recipe yet but the ingredients go together well and it is in my Recipe Box waiting to be used. To answer the issue of the proportion of water to bulgar - the correct proportion is always 1-1/2 times liquid to bulgar so one should use only 1-1/2 cups, not 2. Every grain is different and while raw rice uses a proportion of 2:1 bulgar absorbs liquid differently. Hope this is helpful.

Nice, simple recipe. For people having problems with the bulghur being watery, I think the recipe calls for too much water. According to Moosewood cookbooks, place 1 cup bulghur in heatproof bowl, pour 1 1/4 cups boiling water over, cover, and let soak for 15-20 min. When softened, fluff wtih fork and refrigerate, uncovered, until cooled to room temp. This works for me for all bulghur salads.

These are great flavors that blend beautifully. It also lasts for days and still tastes fresh. Wonderful presentation. Who knew I could love healthy food.

Great! Easy, refreshing, nutritious. You might want to try it with balsamic vinegar instead of lemon juice, I loved it both ways. Also, I almost doubled the cheese. It's also great the next day, flavors blend beautifully.

Wonderful. Fresh, tasty, healthy,and EASY. I could eat this stuff every day! Used the feta with herbs and garlic already added for a little extra flavor. Next time will toss in some kalamata olives too. Delicious, a definite keeper.

Loved this recipe: perfect in its simplicity. You rarely find stuff that is so healthy and so good. make sure to use good olive oil. I personally prefer it with lime juice and a bit of grated peel, though it's not strictly speaking a mediterranean flavor.

This has become a regular part of my vegetarian repertoire. My family is trying to eat healthier and this recipe is very nutritious. I usually serve this as a side dish with Falafel & Pita sandwiches.

Rating: 3
Great flavor- you have to appreciate this dish for what it is - easy & healthy. I added extra tomatoes (halved grape tomatoes) and used fresh basil instead of mint & Ital. parlsey... the grocery store was out of Ital. parsley... you would think grocery stores in a major city like Atlanta could keep parlsey & basil in stock, but it is an on-going issue.I omitted the lemon zest, & it was perfect that night,but the next day I was wishing I had included it. If you like this you should also check out the couscous and shrimp salad with tangerines and almonds.

Great recipe. I discovered that I didn't have any bulgur left, so I used orzo (rice-shaped pasta). It worked great. I also upped the amounts of mint, parsley and lemon because I thought it needed a bit more zip. I'm making it again today the same way!

I'd add the classic cucumbers and black olives and maybe omit the cheese since the bulgut and chickpeas are solid enough.Divine.

Very yummy. Made with kashi the second time and was just wonderful. Certainly a keeper!

Rating: 3
A keeper. We've made it twice in the past week. It's yummy as written, but second time around I did a bit more onion and mint. No, the garbanzos are not necessary, but they add a lot to the recipe (as my husband said, it keeps the salad from becoming "too grain-y").

Rating: 3
Great side dish or light lunch. Just be sure to COOL the bulgur before adding the feta - if not it will melt slightly and you will need to add more if you want identifiable crumbles (adding more is not a bad thing as I discovered. Fast to make and would make a great pot luck or picnic dish as it is as good if not better the second day

I don't like salads too sour so I took the hint from A Cook from Seattle and omitted the lemon rind. In addition, I used a Meyer lemon. I also pressed water out of the bulgur, as suggested. This salad is wonderful! I will pass it on to my family and friends.

OOPS! Forgot the garbanzos, then decided to keep them out because, well, lets just say they have certain effects. Anyway, this was so delicious, and a fun starting base for fooling around with the recipe. Used basil-sun dried tomato feta. Yum.

Excellent starting place. I used the Nile Spice tabbouli -- that was what was in my cupboard -- augmented with fresh mint and parsley, and garnished it with nicoise olives (the store was out of Kalamata.

To the cook from Bethesda: just wring the heck out of the bulgar; you won't damage it. If it still seems wet, wring it again. I raided my herb garden and added basil and cilantro. Also added more tomatoes and olive oil. This is a fun recipe to play with, and a nice whole-meal departure from the traditional tabbouleh.

I guess I didn't press enough water out of the bulgur wheat after cooking. My dish came out looking like wet slop. Although the taste was okay (would have been awful without the feta), the texture was too unappetizing. Can you just wring the heck our of the wheat without damaging it? Would it be better to steam it, like couscous, to keep it fluffy? Could you lay it out on a paper towel to air-dry before incorporating? Any hints would be beneficial to future recipe tryers.

This is great! I did use garlic/herb feta, to give it an extra kick, but otherwise followed the recipe as written. It makes a nice lunch just by itself, and is also wonderful with grilled meats. It'll remain a regular with our family.

Great salad. I liked it after chilling better and my personal taste was to add more feta and tomatoes. But was super the way written!

This is excellent hot-weather fare! The salad has both texture and flavour; it lends itself to variations (I added some smoked chicken I had on hand), will keep overnight and can be prepared in very little time. We liked the flavours so much that I've added it to my file of summer dishes.

Very multi-layered flavors. Nice tart undertones. Would be great with Lamb barbecue. Better if left to age overnight.

Absolutely delicious summer salad. Perfect to take along to a picnic. The flavors are bright and I love the addition of the chick peas. Not for a "meat & potatoes" crowd, but everyone else will rave. I've already passed on the recipe to several friends

After reading the rave reviews, shopping at two stores to find all the ingredients, and spending more than an hour washing, chopping, and preparing ingredients, I hoped the outcome would be great. It was not. All the wonderful ingredients were overwhelmed by the lemon zest and juice. I will probably try making it again, next time with much less lemon and would suggest to anyone else making it that you add the lemon bit by bit until it tastes right to you.

I was surprised at how tasty this is considering how simple it is to make. It would be an ideal dish to bring to a picnic or to have on a hot summer night when you don't want the kitchen to heat up. It's also a great way to get protein into my kids.
