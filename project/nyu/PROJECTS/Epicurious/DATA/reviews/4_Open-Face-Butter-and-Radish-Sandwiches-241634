I was looking for something to do with all those garden radishes and these were fabulous. Even my husband liked them and asked me to make them again. Served with a green salad it's a great summer lunch.

I have been eating these for years. Served them this year as part of a New Year's Day brunch. Everyone loved them! I use unsalted WHIPPED butter and grey sea salt. Superb!

I love these simple little sandwiches! They are pretty and light on the appetite.I find myself making them over and over. I think I will drizzle some truffle oil over this next time, which will be very soon :)

Better than I expected! I love munching on radishes as snacks, so I figured out try out this recipe for a change. I used Kerrygold butter and fresh-baked baguettes. Even though I accidentally bought salted Kerrygold butter, the sandwiches were still superb. The salt mellows out the radishes and they become almost creamy as a result. Simple, easy and delicious!

When I was a child(back in the '50s) my mother and I devoured these sandwiches with fresh radishes from out neighbors organic garden. Brings back old memories of good times and great taste. I highly recommend it.

Delicious, light, refreshing. Definitely worth using the Maldon on these. The crunchiness of the salt adds something special. Leave it to the French to come up with something so simple and yet so sublime!

Such an unexpected flavor. My guests, all of which are intially reluctant, rave about them and ask for more. As we know, in France radishes have been served with butter forever. This appetizer is so easy to do. I recommend you ALWAYS use unsalted butter and use very coarse sea salt for an added crunch.

I grew up eating these sandwiches during the summer months. I had forgotten how good they are and, yes, you do need to use good unsalted butter to make them sing. It also helps to have freshly harvested radishes too

It's amazing how such simple ingredients can create a symphony of flavor. In my opinion, it is essential that you use a good quality European butter for this dish. I tried it once with regular butter, and it didn't have the flavor and richness that the European butters have. Visit http://joleneeatshere.blogspot.com for pics and details.

This is SO good...this is a staple in France and now I know why. I will incorporate some fresh herbs into the butter next time, but overall yummmmmm. I think for some the idea may take some getting used to, but for anyone that's already tried it, it is fantastic! Bon Appetit!

I'm generally not a big radish fan, but these were exceptional. I found that I preferred thicker radish slices to counteract the intensity of the butter and salt. I doubt I'll ever serve this as an hors d'oeuvre but it's perfect tea party material.

Big hit at our annual St. Patrick's Day feast. The unsalted butter/kosher salt is perfect with the peppery radish and soft bread. Even my sister-in-law, who doesn't care for radishes, thought these were awesome. So easy to make, will definitely keep this recipe handy.

Something about these sandwiches caught my eye a while ago and I have been meaning to try them ever since. They taste terrific! While it seems incongruous, unsalted butter with the addition of salt is key, as I think others have said as well.

This was an amazingly tasty treat for such simple ingredients. On a day where I was under the weather and only craved toast, this was a perfect afternoon snack. (As an aside, it is quite inexplicabe how I happened to have radishes handy.... ) I plan on using this an appetizer before Thanksgiving dinner. However, I'll probably deck it up a bit with some fresh herbs in the butter.

Yum! Who knew?? I've never enjoyed radishes before. So simple and good.

I served these at a cocktail party, and wasn't sure if the guests would appreciate this unusual appetizer. They gobbled them up, many people telling me how much they love radishes. The butter and salt seems to mellow out the radishes, and these are a wonderful, addictive little bite.

Delicious and simple little snack. I served these up on pan au lait (soft, sweet baguette from a local bakery) and opted for regular salt as coarse salt proved a rather challenging texture. I made fans out of myself and several guests and now have this as a regular, quick snack. Also tastes quite good with light mayo instead of unsalted butter.

Have tried it on a several things--best is on bagette or even on its own. It is addictive! Have tried it with salted butter--not the same. The kosher salt adds crunch as well as flavor.

Made these for a backyard party and thought they would be refreshing on a hot summer night. I am amazed at how a simple little nosh made such a huge impact on people. I made double the amount of sandwiches and by the time I had a chance to sample one, they were gone! Everyone asked for the recipe. Will definitely make this again.

Very good sandwich, the slight bite from the radish was delicious. I used salted butter, skipping the salting step.

Wow. Yum. I used Kerrygold unsalted butter as suggested by another reviewer. I had never had radishes before. They don't have tons of flavor so I'm going to slice them thicker next time. The recipe suggests using a mandoline. Radishes are really simple to slice. Glad I didn't pull out the extra equipment.

This has been a favorite tea sandwich of mine for all my life! First gobbiled one down when I was 3 and have enjoyed fresh radishes on buttery bread for 60 more years!

These are SO simple, but amazingly delicious. Even for a seemingly non- lover of radishes, this has me converted. I slightly toasted the baguette slices, and absolutely agree with the previous reviewer about the Plugra butter! Any Euro-style will do. (Kerrygold is another winner, if you're lucky enough to have access) Enjoy...a great canape for parties, too! Just beware of salting too soon, as your baguette can get soggy.

Yum!! Growing up, I never experienced the joys of the radish. But after trying this recipe, I plan to make up for lost time. It's the perfect spring treat: crisp, earthy and comforting. I recommend using Plugra European-style butter if you can, and go easy on the sea salt.

My husband thought I was crazy, but I grew up eating these and when I purchase radishes for him (he likes to snack on them) I have to have at least one "radish sandwich" - like other review - we ate ours on white bread! (now I would have wheat bread and may skip the salt & use fresh ground black pepper)

Im definitely going to try this recipe. My grandmother and I use to eat white bread open sandwiches with salt and I loved them. I haven't had this for atleast 20 years. I will write again once I revisit a blast from the past.

I grew up eating radish and cream cheese sandwiches on thin rye bread, this recipe almost the same except for the butter.
