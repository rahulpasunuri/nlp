Loved the strawberry rhubarb combination. We have been eating it with ice cream (fabulous) and like jam on toast in the morning. I didn't make the lemon cream, so maybe that was the problem, It just seemed a bit dry on the puff pastry, since they were cooked separately.

This was a great summer dessert. Made these for a fancy dinner party. They made for a beautiful and impressive presentation. The leftover strawberry-rhubarb mixture was excellent on vanilla icecream. I would even make just the filling to use that way. If you want something that looks very fancy, is delicious and VERY easy, make these!
