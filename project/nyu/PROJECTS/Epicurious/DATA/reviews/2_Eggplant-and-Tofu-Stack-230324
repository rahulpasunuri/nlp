DON'T DO IT! I should have looked at these reviews before attempting this catastrophe! It took FOREVER to make, nearly 2 hrs in a hot kitchen and when i finally sat down to eat it, it just did not taste right. I regret the time, energy and money I spent on this

DON'T DO IT! I should have read these reviews before I attempted this catastrophe! This recipe took me FOREVER to do in a hot kitchen and I am a multitasker! I thought I liked Tofu and eggplant, but attempting this made me queesy! It took me near 2 hours and then when I finally sat down to eat it, I couldn't. It just did not taste right. Really disappointed at the time, money and energy I spent on it.

I have never had such a disaster in my kitchen! After all the ingredients, time, and effort.. it tasted horrible (I even marinated the tofu as the other reviewer suggested). There are too many things wrong with this recipe to name here... just let me say to you.. DON'T DO IT!! However, as I was trying to figure out what to do with the left over eggplant mixture (sans the tofu).. I had a great idea. I sautéed the filling with a little oil, mushrooms, celery and bread crumbs.. and it turned into a great veggie stuffing! It's certainly low fat and tastes terrific. It might be a nice twist on a traditional stuffing. That being said, it still takes a while to make and not sure if it's worth it. Oh well.. onward and upward, right? :)

This recipe needs a lot of love. I followed the instructions to the letter and the tofu comes out raw except for the little that gets browned. The tofu is very bland as well because you do not marinade or spice it up. The eggplant filling is very delicious and I can see where this dish could be very tasty. I recommend either baking or frying the tofu before adding it to the stack. Also you might want to marinade the tofu as well. A marinara sauce would be good to top it all off.
