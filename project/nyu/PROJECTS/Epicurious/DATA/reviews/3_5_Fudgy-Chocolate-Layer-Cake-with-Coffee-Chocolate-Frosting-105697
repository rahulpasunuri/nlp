What is wrong with that person from NY other than not knowing how to bake.? This cake is very chocolatey and moist and the frosting is beyond rich and wonderful. Don't let that review keep you from trying this. It is special occasion worthy, and I'm a food snob.

I found nothing good about this cake. I halved it, found the batter to be quite thick (which is an indicator for a dense cake), the cake wasnt moist, kine of dry and the coffee flavor really came out. The icing was kind of runny and there was too much liquid for the chocolate to melt. I'll be only cooking cakes that have pics from now on.

After two hours the ganach frosting was beautiful with a satin finish and was delicious. The cupcakes, once completely cooled did not crumble and was easy to peel from the cupcake wrapper.

Thank you one and all for writing such great reviews. I made the cake into cupcakes with a 25 minute bake time and they are perfect. Yes they do stick to the paper somewhat and can crumble. Thank you for including your comments about the frosting. Mine seems a little thin for spreading but I will patiently wait the three hours for it to gel. Otherwise I can dip the cupcakes. I added bacon to 1/2 of the recipe. We were making chocolate bacon cupcakes with another recipe that didn't work so I made this one instead and added some bacon. I've made candied bacon with which to garnish. I'll let you all know how it works out.

I initially made this many years ago for a friend's birthday and had a series of baking disasters resulting from a crappy too-small apartment oven with uneven heating. Even so, it was the most spectacular chocolate cake I had ever tasted. So in 2003, we served this cake (well several of these cakes) at our wedding (~150 guests) and were told repeatedly that it was the most delicious and decadent cake ever, let alone wedding cake. I have made this recipe a dozen or more times since, and it always comes out moist and perfect. Notes: I've found that spring form pans work best for ease of removal; this cake can stick to cake pans even with parchment paper on the bottom. I have tried this recipe for cupcakes. The resultant cupcakes are moist and delicious, but stick pretty badly to the cupcake wrappers.

Great, unfussy cake to make, very moist, dense and flavorful, yet with a delicate crumb. I used hazelnut flavored coffee one time, and another day used 1 tsp vanilla plus 1/2 tsp almond essence instead of water and espresso powder for the cake, with nice results. I always use parchment paper for my pans. Cake was ready a little before the recommended time. I use a quick chocolate frosting and filling and also a cannolli filling along with a dark chocolate glaze for this cake -- never tried the coffee/choc frosting from the recipe.

its delicious but very crumbly.and i should have placed a parchment paper on th bottom because it got stuck and had a difficult time getting it out.when it finally came out,it fell into pieces!!!disaster.and frosting should be made ahead of time because it took a long time for it to thicken.

Just made this for a summer cottage gathering. The cake was a hit. They made these comments: "Oh my God, your cake is so wonderfully decadent." "This is the perfect afternoon dessert." "You know, this is the perfect balance of fudge and cake. Most of the time it's too much." "I like this fudge cake so much better than Whole Foods bakery's fudge cake - theirs is like pure frosting and you don't even want to finish a slice." "I'm so glad we have this for dessert tomorrow." Notes: I put the frosting in the refrigerater - took about 90 minutes to thicken up enough to frost with. I couldn't find pure espresso powder so I bought Nescafe Taster's choice decaf instant coffee packets - used two in place of two tablespoons - worked great. My Kitchenaid oven using convection bake at 325 almost over cooked the layers in 25 minutes. Otherwise made the cake exactly as written. I'd say you can go decently thick in the center layer of frosting and still have enough for the rest of your cake. HAPPINESS!!

This is a great recipe. I lined my pans with buttered parchment, and that worked great for getting the cakes out. I omitted the instant espresso from the frosting and it was still delicious. The cake is delicate and moist, and the frosting is rich and decadent. Some would scoff at me, but I used Nestle's chocolate chips for the chocolate in the frosting and it turned out just lovely. Yum.

This cake is really rich and yummy and friends ask me to make it again and again. The only tricky part is getting the frosting to the right consistency for spreading.

I went on this recipe to print out a new one since mine is all full of cake batter (from 2004),and I realized that in my review of 2004 I said I used 2 11x7 pans instead of 4 when quadrupling the recipe! I see also the review is posted twice-I guess one that I didn't think went thru did! I hope no one tried only 2 pans for the recipe! This cake it still a winner! We usually are sugar free in this house, but my kids always ask for this cake for birthdays-they are now teens- I doubled the recipe and used 2 pans and will put one layer on top the other. With the extra frosting I will use a store bought yellow cake mix and make cupcakes. There is usually enough left over for this, and it makes the cupcakes taste homemade.This is by far the best chocolate cake recipe. Don't skimp on the frosting because most of the flavor is in the frosting. I use almost 1/2 inch of frosting in between layers. It is really like fudge and is amazing. Good idea to make the frosting before the cake, especially if you are doubling the recipe. I foudn that it takes at least 3 hours to harden. You want a very dense, peanutbutter like consistency. The cake cooks in the 11x7 pans in about 35 minutes.

really yummy cake and icing (replaced the coffee with coconut rum - still delicious) I baked the cake all in one pan for 1hr. Still works this way. Take all the advice about it sticking to the tin..better prep would result in a smoother finish

I used this recipe to make cupcakes and they turned out delicious! Based on previous comments that said to not over bake it I watched the first batch pretty closely and it took approx. 20 minutes. Next time I would cut the frosting in half since I wasn't frosting an entire cake. I just dont need that much yummy frosting left over in the fridge! Also I made the recipe mostly dairy and lactose free by substituting Silk coffee creamer for the whipping cream, and Tofutti Sour Supreme for the sour cream. No one noticed the difference.

This cake is truly delicious. And very rich, but that didn't stop me from eating 8 pieces in one weekend. I brought it to a dinner party, and everyone ignored the fancy $40 chocolate cake from a well- known bakery in town to eat this one. make sure to grease the pans very well, or else it is a mess to get out.

We love this chocolate cake. It's just as the title suggests...fudgy chocolate cake. But, oh so good. All other reviewers have it right on money. Don't bake as long as recipe states. I made cake in smaller round pans and cooked only about 23 minutes. I did have some difficulties taking out of pan, so I'd suggest lining with parchment. I didn't make frosting, but I bet it's great.

I did not make the cake - I prefer the Rosie's sour cream chocolate layer cake recipe. I did however make the frosting, which was easy to make and to work with, as well as delicious. I omitted the coffee since the cake layers have a lot of coffee flavour in them.

i carefully read almost every review of this recipe and found there to be a difinitive contrast in opinions, and I must say I am glad I went with my gut and tried it despite contradiction. This cake is beautiful. I'm not sure how you could mess it up or feel that it was bland and lacking depth. I cooked it only 32 min. taking the advice of other reviewers and the only diffenece in my prep. was that I used smart balance omega oil, and not veg. oil. My cake was moist, fell right out of the pan, and had xtra frosting to spare. I recommend on all occasions!

Rating: 4
This is by far the best chocolate cake recipe ever!!!!! Please only cook this cake until done (~30minutes). Do not over bake! Most reviews about this recipe suggests to me that they over cooked their cake. Make the ganache before you cook the cake and you will be fine. Put it in the fridge to cool faster if you like. Then make the cake. You will love it.

The taste of this cake was good however it was a huge disappointment to spend all the time I did making this cake (and the frosting) only to have the cake stick to the pans after I buttered and floured them as the recipe calls for. If a recipe doesn't call for parchment paper I don't use it. This recipe defintely requires parchement paper lining the pans!! Atleast I saved one layer which I served in the pan with the frosting on top. Not very visually stunning. Oh well.

Under no conditions make this cake. It "boiled out of the pans" onto the oven. It did not form a cake at all. I know that I used the correct amount of cake flour, and all other ingredients. This could have been a disaster except for the use of a Duncan Hines mix. (I did use the wonderful frosting on it.) Such a disappointment and what a mess!!! My husband would not let me repeat the cake just to see what I might possibly have done wrong...since it was his birthday I was both sad and disappointed. ...and I am not an inexperienced cook!

Made this cake 5 times. The cooking time is only about 31-32 minutes, not the 40 minutes suggested. I think that may be why some think it is dry and too large a crumb. I also substituted 2 TB instant coffe and water for the espresso, and used 1/2 semi and 1/2 milk chocoate mosrels for the chocoate in the frosting. I have quadruples the recipe and used 2 11/8 inch baking pans to make a large birthday cake (made a large 2 layer cake). Fed 75 people

Rating: 4
I have read over the reviews, after making this cake successfully over 5 times. I think that when people are complainign about the dry crumb, they are overcooking the cake. Every time I make this cake it takes between 30 and 32 minutes, not the 40 minutes on the recipe. I hope that others will test the cake with a toothpick after 30 minutes and not overbake it., I think that has been the problem for others. I also substituted 2 heaping TB's of instant coffee for the espresso, and used chocolate chip morsels (1/2 semi-sweet, 1/2 milk chocoate) for the chocoate in the frosting. This cake comes out perfect every time. I have quadrupled the recipe and used 2 11x8 inch baking pans (made a 2 layer sheet cake)for a birthday party for my husbnad. It fed almost 100 people!

I made this cake for a friend's birthday. I substituted a cup of strong, cold coffee for the water, as I did not want to use instant espresso powder. The coffee taste was subtle and we all loved it. I sprinkled slivered almonds over the sides to add some texture and variety in the appearance. A wonderfully moist and deliciously rich cake! I am making it again for a celebration this weekend.

WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT! I have never, ever been so dissapointed by a chocolate cake. I am a professional baker and this recipe LOOKED okay but boy was I wrong. Boring at best, dry and tasteless at worst. I had planned this for a grooms cake and thank goodness I tasted the cake (made a 6" round to sample) before the date. I will never make this again and for the first time, epicurious has let me down.

I made this cake yesterday for my son's second birthday. It was incredibly yummy and exactly what a chocolate cake should be - very moist and chocolaty. I didn't have instant expresso powder so, like some of the other posters, I used unsweeted (non-Dutch process) cocoa powder instead. I found the frosting incredibly easy to work with, maybe because it was more like a ganache than the typical butter/sugar frosting. This is as good a layer cake as any I've had in a restaurant. Everyone loved it. A definite keeper.

Rating: 4
This is a GREAT chocolate cake, and the frosting is fantastic. To those who are worried about the cake tasting too much like coffee - the espresso is not perceptible as a coffee flavor. Rather, it seems to impart a smoothness, or a very subtle contrast, to the magnificent chocolate flavor of this cake. I think it may have kept the sweetness of the chocolate from being too cloying. I made this for a family party of eight people and asked if any of them could guess the "secret" ingredient - none of them could! I used parchment for the cakes and had no problems w/sticking. I also followed the advice of previous reviewers and made the frosting the night before. I added more milk to the frosting before spreading it on the cake to make it a little smoother. I think the warm frosting would be just as good poured over the cake as it is very similar to a ganache.

I make this cake all the time. It's delicious and incredibly easy (and rich!). Last time I made it, I was doing too many things in the kitchen and not paying attention. I used bittersweet chocolate instead of unsweetened. When I realized my mistake, I only used 1 1/2 cups of sugar, instead of 2 cups. It turned out amazing. The cake was incredibly moist and chocolatey. I liked it even better this way than they way the recipe's written. This makes a terrific birthday cake.

Moist, light in texture, chocolatey cake!. I substituted the sour cream with plain yogurt, omitted the expresso and forgot the vanilla...still turned out great. I used a bundt mold, baked it for 30 min. It did not last long between the kids and my husband, even without the frosting!

I made this cake EXACTLY as the recipe stated, and for some reason it never rose in the middle and came out concave. I've made lots of chocolate cakes (I consider chocolate a perfectly reasonable breakfast food), but can't figure out what I did wrong. Anyway, when i went to turn them out, they stuck to the bottom. I tapped the pans and the cakes fell out in chunks! I had to scrape the rest out of the bottom of the pan (I normally use wax papar as well as butter/flouring the pans, but ran out!). I tasted a piece of cake and it was absolutely fabulous. I couldn't throw the cake out, or continue to eat it off the counter with my bare hands, so I put it in a glass casserole and layered it with the icing like a parfait. It was perfect! Plus, I didn't have to wait for the icing to cool completely or frost the cake, I just poured the icing in layers. So much simpler. I will make this recipe again, maybe next time layer my parfait with fresh raspberries and raspberry preserves if I'm lucky enough to mess it up again :)

This was a wonderfully easy and flavorful chocolate cake. I made it for a group of friends and everyone wanted the recipe. It was great to have a rich, easy-to-make frosting that didn't require a pound of butter. The cake was moist and not too heavy. I lined the pans with wax paper, in addition to greasing and flouring them.

For two years, I have been looking forward to making a cake with this kind of reputation. I've always dreamed of finding the perfect chocolate layer cake and the perfect frosting--and New Year's Eve offered me the opportunity to make this cake. I bought Scharffen-Berger chocolate, a highly rated American chocolatier, and the finest ingredients, including double strength Penzey's vanilla. In toto, the ingredients to this cake cost me $27. I read the recipe, read the reviews carefully, picking up hints as I went along (such as using parchment paper, testing at the shortest time in baking for done-ness, stirring the frosting until it was chilled and properly thickened, etc.), followed everything to the "T." And, still, it is just another boring chocolate cake. The cake wasn't dense and fudge-y, but, to my taste, just rather bland and somewhat dry and too fine a crumb. The frosting, however, was superb...terrific like a really well-made, rich fudge. So, when you add the so-so cake to the terrific fudgy-icing with the outrageous cost of the cake, I came up with a whole One Fork for my overall rating. Won't spend the money again.

If you like fudge, this is the cake you've been looking for! I tasted a bit of the cake before assembly and wondered how good it would be. The cake hesitated a bit coming out of the pan, but came out with a little coaxing. The frosting spreads beautifully and tastes great when chilled. The finished product is a rich, dense cake loaded with a chocolate explosion. It's a great cake that I would definitely make again. Easy and tastes great. What else could you ask for?

Stop your searching!!! This is it!! I had been making a Gale Gand cake which was very rich and this is the easiest and best recipe I have found! What I like is that I don't have to take out the mixer and do the creaming of the butter routine..I can use the whisk. I would make a recommendation. Having made other chocolate cakes with coffee..there is no need to buy espresso powder. Most of us have coffee makers..take 3 cups of water in your coffee maker and brew with 6 tablespoons of coffee (I use decaf). You will then use the one cup of coffee instead of the 1 cup of water with the espresso powder. Then for the icing use 1/4 cup of the coffee instead of once again the water plus powder. (You'll have a little coffee left over in your coffeemaker) This may solve this dilemma some have expressed. Anyway, why go out and buy another product you won't use!!? The frosting does take about 2 1/2 hrs to thicken in the fridge. Just put it in a big shallow bowl and stir every 20 minutes. It spreads so wonderfully. Oh, about the cake sticking..after you butter and flour the cake pans(I use the alluminum ones cause I can bend them to get the cake out), put a circle of waxed paper inside the pan to keep the cake from sticking to it. Take a square of waxed paper, fold in half, then half the other way, and keep folding from the middle(now on the diagonal-where the point is) till you have a narrow triangle. Then put your pan upside down and take the point of the triangle in the middle of the pan and then rip off (or cut) the opposite end at the end of the pan. When you open it it will be a perfect circle! .Hope this instruction is clear!!I saw it on T.V. and it really helps get the paper the exact size!) The paper will peel off easily from the cake when you take it out of the pan! Mine took only 36 minutes to bake, so be careful to stick the toothpick in after about 35 minutes!

I have made this cake twice. The cake was perfectly moist and delicious both times. The frosting is very rich and not for those who do not love thick, rich, fudgy deserts. It does require a long time in the fridge - I did it overnight. My husband thinks the frosting is perfect, but I prefer this cake with a mocha whipped cream.

Oh my god! This was definately fudgy! It is the best chocolate cake I ever had! I didn't put both layers together rather, kept them as two cakes. I easily halved the frosting recipe and there was still plenty to frost both cakes. I only did this because I didn't bake it for a special occasion so I thought it was a bit extravagant for us everyday. I froze one of the frosted cakes and it froze very well. This was a very easy recipe for an incredible result!

Absolutely wonderful...best chocolate cake ever. Dense and soft, melts in your mouth, but firm enough to be frosted attractively. I used only 1 T. expresso powder due to kids, though it might not have made any difference, and a different frosting (from the Bon Appetit Old-Fashioned Chocolate Layer Cake) which used unsweeetened chocolate and 1/2 cup whipping cream.

After all my disasters(spilled water/chocolate & 2 lb. of sugar in floor...), I thought this cake would be inedible, but it was great.

I made this cake for my husband's birthday and it was a disaster. I read the reviews and knew other people had trouble getting the cake out of the pans, so I made sure to generously grease them. This did not help at all. One of the layers would not come out of the pan and I had to throw it away. The other layer I was able to salvage, but I had to make a box cake to make up for the lost layer. The frosting was delicious, but way too runny. It was more like a fudge topping for ice cream than frosting. Not sure what went wrong there. The flavor was good but it was the most pitiful looking cake you've ever seen. Major disappoinment.

This cake was not overly difficult, and was delicious. I decided to try this new recipe for a birthday cake for myself and my father, and I wasn't disappointed. The cake was light and moist, and sliced well, with a perfect crumb. The frosting was good too, although it did get a bit stiff for my taste. No one else complained though, and most everyone had 2 pieces. I did use parchment on my pans, and baked 5 min. less than recommended. The cake portion of this recipe would be hard to beat; maybe bested only by Gourmet's Double Chocolate Layer Cake from the restaurant Engine Co. #9

This cake is sinful, that's how good it is. I made it for my friend's birthday and everyone loved it. Make sure you cut small pieces because it is extremely rich and tasty. The only recommendation I would have is, don't put the frosting in the refrigerator when you let it sit. Make sure you constantly watch it and keep it at room temperature. If you don't watch it closely and it becomes hard, just whip it in the mixer and it will be as good as new.

Yes, this cake requires more effort than your typical version but it is absolutely worth it! I found the recipe in a chocolate cookbook before I'd ever had a chance to sample the creator's own version at Watershed...the home version can only dream of being THAT good, but it comes surprisingly close. If you love chocolate, this is the cake for you. And if the cake alone doesn't send your guests into orbit, serve it with a nice spicy zinfandel and watch as they build a shrine in your honor. Hands down the best dessert I've ever made!

I'm not a huge chocolate cake fan, but I made this for my hb's thirtieth birthday and we thought it was delicious. The cakes did stick badly, so next time I'll line the pans - in any case, I did manage to salvage them and once the icing was in place you couldn't tell they had been mangled. I garnished it with a big pile of white chocolate curls, which tasted great with the cake and looked beautiful. My hb said it was the best birthday cake I've ever made him.
