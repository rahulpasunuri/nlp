Great recipe! I had a lot of remaining herb-salt mixture so I made mashed potatoes instead of just the 1 pressed potato, and added a very small amount of the herb mixture to it when mashing. So good! I also sprinkled more on the dish after plating, but do use too much, it's pure salt.

I have made this a couple of times and it is great. I have made it for a dinner party and got raves. What is nice about it is you can make it the day before and heat it up and cook the potatoes right before the party. I get my ribs from Costco also, and have never had a problem with fattyness.

Delicious. My mother-in-law calls this beef burgundy. What is the difference between this and that? Because of this recipe I have also discovered that I like Italian food and have been scouring the food blogs for tasty recipes.

The recipe says that it will take about 15 minutes to reduce the sauce to 4 cups. It took over an hour.It was very tasty though!I agree that it could use more herbs/salt

Everyone in the house loved this. I used boneless short ribs from Costco. They were to die for. Hardly any fat. I cooked them for 2 1/4 hours and they were plenty tender. I used a hand blender in the liquid so I avoided dirtying another dish. Also used a good Syrah (probably $10). I would change the following: 1) Use more/most of the herbs since 3 1/2 tsp was not enough. In particular the lack of salt in the meat was noticeable. I added salt to the reduced broth but the meat didn't absorb enough. 2) Decrease chicken stock to what is required to cover shortribs (probably 3 cups).

I was so disappointed! I had been looking forward to making this recipe since I saw it come out in the Sept issue. I have had short ribs in restaurants and enjoyed them, however I don't think me nor my husband will eat them again as we didn't feel well afterwards. I bought my short ribs from Whole Foods, and their meat department has never let me down before, but these were extremely fatty, I took the more fatty ribs and left the meatier looking ribs for my husband. I did like the sauce, but it too had so much fat in it. I had made it the night before, and skimmed off the fat that had risen to the top and I was very glad that I had used the full amount of liquid in the recipe. I can not imagine how rich this dish would be if not skimming off all of the fat!

Very good pureed vegetables. The meat was not as good. I'm not sure if it was the store's quality or if its just an extremely fatty cut. Also needed quite a bit of salt (and I'm not a salt user)

The sauce is amazing and delectable. Neither my family nor I is so crazy for short ribs though. Even though I trimmed them well, still tasted a little fatty/tough. Next time I will use a pot roast instead (much prefer the texture) with some beef bones thrown in to simmer and up the flavor quotient of the sauce.

A lovely variation on the pot roast idea. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out wonderfully. The meat had great flavor, was tender, and like another reviewer said, fell off the bones. I did puree the vegetables and the sauce turned out like a gravy. The beef flavor permeated them so they tasted like one too.

A delicious and easy recipe. I used short ribs with the bone, and I knew the meat was tender when the bones fell off. I also cut down the chicken stock to 2 cups like another reviewer suggested, and there was more than enough sauce. The only thing I will do differently next time is that I will serve over mashed potatoes.

Very, very good. Definitely does not need all the liquid called for. Two cups of broth and 1/2 a bottle o wine is plenty. I didn't puree the vegetables, probably will next time.

I made this dish but because of time constraints did not puree the veg at the end. It turned out delicious. I, too, used a bargain bin Syrah and was told "you could bottle the sauce." Many rave reviews.

To the reviewer with an aversion to potatoes. I've made this dish and many braised italian type meat dishes then served it with polenta crostini. Add a little fresh grated parmasean to the polenta while it's still hot. Spread the hot polenta thinly in an oiled baking sheet. After it cools, cut it into any shape you wish, then saute these crostini in a little olive oil and butter. I usually top them with a little more cheese, for show mostly.

We enjoyed this dish- very tasty. I ended up cooking it for three hours because we were out- the beef fell off the bones. I ended up using a domestic Petit Sirah from the bargain bin of the local liquor store- the sauce was excellent and I served it on a bed of egg noodles. Nice comfort food for the cold weather arriving now.

Not a review - a question... Would someone please recommend a menu around this dish? Would polenta or risotto work here, like osso buco? I'm not real excited about the potatoes, and would like to try this dish with a group of foodie friends.

P.S. When I have made beef short ribs in the past and they turned out dry, I have always used the boneless kind. Thanks again for any help.

Thank all of you for your input about the broth. I still have some questions. I have never had much luck cooking beef short ribs (they always turn out dry). Are you supposed to cut the slab of ribs (about 5) into individual ribs before starting the recipe?? I usually don't, and I wonder if I then overcook the meat?? Also, I am not familiar with the types of wine required--can someone tell me if they are sweet or dry wines?? Thank all of you.

Just like another reviewer, I too prepare a version of this recipe and have for years. I love the short ribs. Here are a few cooking notes I've accumlated over time. (1) Be aware that "real" short ribs--as from a rib roast--may not be easy to find. Instead, I find many markets substitute the "short" rib-like bones from various chuck or pot roast cuts. This cut may take a little longer to achieve the fall-off-the-bone state that you desire. (The bones do add fantastic flavor to the recipe.) Additionally, this cheaper cut will have loads of fat that will be difficult to trim off. What I suggest is that you plan to make this dish a day ahead so you can easily remove the layer of fat from the meat before you reheat it--the flavor is also improved with an overnight stay in the refrigerator. (2) Short ribs, with the bone, weigh quite a bit. If I were preparing this recipe for 6 hearty eaters I would increase the quantity of ribs to 5 1/2 to 6 lbs. (3) Along with most of the cooks here, I avoid using canned beef broth for anything. I would not even use my homemade broth because I think chicken broth in long-cooking beef dishes makes a richer tasting product. (4) I agree that 4 cups of anything--plus the wine--makes too much liquid. I also would reduce the broth to 2 to 2 1/2 cups for 5 to 6 lbs. of ribs. (5) I'm sure any full-bodied red wine that is acceptable to drink would work just fine in this recipe. FINALLY!!(6) I prefer to complete the cooking of the ribs in my oven, at 300 degrees for 3 hours. The meat will fall off the bone and will have an even deeper flavor. This is a wonderful cooler weather dish; enjoy!

I personally actively dislike canned beef broth, whereas chicken broth is more neutral. If you have homemade beef stock I'd use that, but I'd use supermarket chicken broth before beef broth.

To Cook from Alamogordo, NM: It can be hard to find low sodium beef stock, and regular canned beef broth is very salty & sometimes tastes "off". I usually use canned chicken broth for long cooking beef recipes especially if i am going to reduce/concentrate the flavors. Of course, if you make your own and can control the salt, by all means go for the beef.

Do they REALLY mean CHICKEN broth???

I have made this dish for many years with variations on the same theme. However, as I've gotten older I make things easier on myself and with this recipe I use my slow cooker. On low for 5-6 hours it comes out perfectly done and delicious. As has already been said, like many dishs, it is better to make it a day ahead and reheat it the next day. I would also agree that there is too much liquid in the recipe. Cut it in half and add a couple of bay leaves to the sauce.

I've been making a variation of this dish for years...it's one of our favorite meals. I don't bother with sauteeing the veggies though. After browning the meat I add one chopped carrot, 1/2lb sliced mushrooms and 1 chopped onion. I then pour the wine and beef broth over all and simmer for the 1-1/2 to 2 hrs. YUM!

This was "to die for". But there appears to be a mistake in the recipe. It calls for over 3 tablespoons of the beef coating but then in the directions it says to use 3 1/2 teaspoons. Why make so much and use so little? I used all the coating and it was delicious. Also, the meat I used was boneless ribs from my local Tops. Boneless makes eating really easy.

This dish has great potential, but I would do things a little differently next time. 1.)Brown the meat longer than 8 minutes otherwise two hours of simmering isn't going to be enough to make the meat "fall off the bone" tender. 2.) Cut down the chicken broth from 4 cups to 2 cups. Even after boiling for 30 minutes at the end, I still had too much liquid. It was more of a soup then a thick gravy. 3.)Increase the amount of fresh herbs. 3 1/2 teaspoons wasn't enough to give this dish a robust flavor.
