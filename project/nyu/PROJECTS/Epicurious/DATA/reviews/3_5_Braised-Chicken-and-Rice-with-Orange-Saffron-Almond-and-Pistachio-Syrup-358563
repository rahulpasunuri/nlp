I meant "4" not "5".

Yum! The flavours here are really sublime. Kind of whacked out ingredients -- rose water in particular -- but the blending of all of the tastes really works. I'd give this 3.5 forks. Not 5 because, well, it's chicken thighs for god's sake.

This was great. Couldn't find brown basmati, so used white. If you do I would try not topping up the broth to 3 cups as the rice was a little mushy. Used the tweaks as well and will definitely add this to the rotation.

I had some of the rice mixture left over. The flavor is even better after two days in the fridge. Next time I am going to try it with shrimp.

I completely agree with treynolds. I didn't use rosewater and the fava beans are a must. I keep cardamom seeds in a pepper grinder, I used this spice fairly frequently as I just adore the flavor. The orange juice is a great idea and I will add that next time. I used boneless/skinnless chicken thighs. Its just makes it easier to eat and the flavor was still wonderful. This a very flavorful and delicious dish and will certainly be made again at my house.

We liked it very much including our 4 years old daughter. Unfortuntaley we have allergy problem, so all nuts were ommitted. And we didn't have rose water. Otherwise I was follwing recipe quite precisely and it wasn't time consuming at all - took about 25 minutes preparation time. Definitely will make it again, next time instead of sugar will use orange juice as advised treyholds from Cleveland. Cardamon wan't overpowering at all, but I've used whole pods instead of seeds. So it was nice blend of cardamon and saffron smells. And beans were definitely must, even though I've used regular string beans cut to smaller pieces.

This is a poorly written recipe and perhaps not well tested. But with a few tweaks the dish is delicious! extract the cardamon seeds and grind them in a mortar/ pestle. if you use pre-ground cardamon, use about 1/3 teaspoon. Use chicken stock, not water. for the syrup, use 1/4 cup water and 1/4 cup orange juice (why waste that lovely organic orange?). don't blanch the peas, they'll cook enough in the final stage. Use the fava beans for sure! it's a great addition. Rose water is great, but if you can't find it, don't sweat it. it's not that big a contributor to the flavors. The dish is time consuming, but well worth the effort, in my opinion. I think it would be good with shrimp or lamb instead of chicken too!

Extract the seeds from the cardamom pods and grind them in a morter/pestle. If you use pre ground cardamon, use about 1/3 teaspoon. for the syrup, use 1/4 cup water, 1/4 cup orange juice (why waste that organic orange?). Use chicken stock instead of water (maybe with a little white wine). Rose water is great, but if you can't find it, don't sweat it..not that big a factor. Served with spinach it is a wonderful and a colorful plate. Time consuming, but i thought it was worth the effort.

Very involved recipe for a rather disappointing dish. Tastes mostly of cardamom, and all other flavours are overpowered by same. (I was hoping for some of the subtlety of the saffron.) I had to omit the rosewater as I could not buy any in my city, but I cannot believe that that alone would have made this dish so disappointing.

in afganistan they use opium poppies instead of saffron
