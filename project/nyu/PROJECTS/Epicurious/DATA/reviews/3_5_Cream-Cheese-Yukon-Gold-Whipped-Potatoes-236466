Surprisingly good! I cut the lemon jc way back on other reviewers suggestions. I also cut the butter in half and used fat free milk vs. cream. I loved it - served w/shrimp.

Wonderful comfort food on a below zero winter's day. Great flavor and texture.

My mom and I have been searching for the ultimate mashed potato recipe for years. THIS IS IT!!! WOW!!! I can't wait to make (and eat) this dish again!

The lemon is a superb addition. Good recipe with the salt figured out. Would not normally have used that much, but the taste is just right.

I left out the lemon portion of the recipe after I tasted it right before I was going to add it. No need to add the lemon. Why mess up a decadent mashed potato creation?

I have brought these to Thanksgiving dinner the last 3 years. I make them the day before, put them in the crock pot, and put the crock in the fridge over night. Bring them to dinner, plug them in, and they are hot and ready by dinner. I used 1 TBS lemon instead of 3, low-fat cream cheese & non-fat sour cream (so they are not quite so evil) & added 1 head of diced roasted garlic.

Loved these -- I didn't add the lemon juice, as I tasted them before I added them and they were perfect. I also did not add as much salt as the recipe called for, as I put a healthy dose of salt in the water when I boiled the potatoes. Everyone had seconds of these.

If I didn't make this myself, I would say it tasted off. I love potatoes and usually like anything with lemon in it, but although this whipped up well as a side for roast lamb, it was a tangy tasting mash and a face twisting turn-off for me. A polite amount was eaten, so sorry to say... Yuck. Made bubble and squeak with the rest and that was delicious!

Awesome potatoes! Next time I make it though, I'll cut down the salt a bit - were very tasty though.
