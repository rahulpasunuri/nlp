I've been making this stuffing for years -- it's lower in fat than others I've found and very tasty. It seems to be better the second day after all the juices have had time to absorb. To cook outside of the bird, I put it in the oven at 350 for at least one hour. Everyone loves it and I get asked for the recipe each year.

Great recipe as I love the combination of tart, sweet and savory. The only thing was I halved this recipe and even though I did, I still had to use two cups of broth (maybe I like my stuffing a lot more moist versus dry?). I also can't find regular sausage in Singapore so I used spicy Italian and it still came out beautifully and with a slight bit of a kick!

Outstaning recipe. I've prepared this for several years for many different people, and it always gets rave reviews!

This was a great stuffing recipe according to my 20 guests. I've been searching for years for a recipe I'd make again. I would make this again.

This has become the traditional Holiday Stuffing. And yes; it does make a large amount; but it freezes beautifully! And it is very easy to cut into half! Add some pistachios or almonds for a little bit of a crunch!!

Excellent taste, and as another reviewer said, it's reasonably healthy to boot. We omitted 1 cup of apricots/prunes (too much fruit!) and used soy "sausage" crumbles which we prefer in stuffing. We needed more broth, but used store-bought cornbread stuffing mix (yeah, I know, cheaters) which is bone-dry to begin with. It's a good recipe for tweaking as you like it.

I have made this 2 Christmas' in a row and it is superb. I wasn't able to find spiced turkey sausage so used plain pork sausagemeat which went really well with the fruits. It makes a large amount but is lovely to have with the cold meats post Christmas.

I have made this for Thanksgiving two years in a row. I always make it ahead and refrigerate till Thanksgiving morning (never stuff the bird).The first year I sprinkled the turkey juices over top and the next year I used chicken broth, both were raved about. Where the turkey juices really added a delicious flavor, the chicken broth is lighter and probably a good route for those wanting to cut the fat.

This was a nice change from the regular family tradition stuffing I've always made. With only 2 T vegetable oil and all of the fruits, it's a lot more healthy also. Loved the spicy turkey sausage with the sweetness of the fruit.

This recipe is excellent. Next time, though, I am cutting it in half! The full recipe made an incredible amount of dressing ... enough to stuff an 18-pound bird and fill a 9x13 casserole to heaping. Even with a family full of dressing lovers, there was way too much left over.

I made this last year for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. We had a couple of non-meat eaters at dinner, so I reserved a portion of the dressing ex-sausage for them -- it was very good without it. I also used store-bought dressing cubes (Pepperidge Farm). Making it again this year by request.

I made this stuffing for Tanksgiving last year and EVERYONE loved it. It was such a hit that I am the official stuffing maker for the Holidays.

This was a wonderful, fresh and not-heavy tasting stuffing. I made it the day before TG and then baked it in a casserole uncovered the day of - did not stuff in turkey. Turned out fantastic, and I did use store bought "herbed stuffing" instead of bread cubes. My mother (71 y.o.) is still bugging me for the recipe- which I just printed out for her; she has finally been converted from the overly rich type of stuffing we've eaten for 45 years!

This is my first recipe I've made from epicurious, it is my 2nd thanksgiving, and first time making stuffing. Aside from burning the stuffing, undercooking the turkey, (I now believe it is time for a new oven), it had a really nice flavor, and was great for left overs. My in-laws were not huge fans, they are midwesterners and love stove-top stuffing (ugh), but they ate it. The stuffing had a nice flavor, and I'm definitely willing to try it again - there were no overpowering spices, nor was it too sweet - I really enjoyed it. Will try again!

LOVED this dish, much better when stuffed in the turkey vs. baked in a pan(did both) but it was so very good....One would think it might be too sweet but NOT!!!Excellent dish...Another favorite from this site that will be used for years to come.....

This turned out pretty tasty, even though I had doubts at first. I did add about 1 1/2 sticks of melted butter to add some flavor as well as an extra cup or so of broth as it was very dry. I used 1# of turkey sausage and 1# of sage pork sausage and the flavor was just right. This recipe certainly needs its share of salt so don't forget to season as you go. Since we fry turkeys for thanksgiving I baked the stuffing instead. Had several complements.

This is a very delicious stuffing- I made it about 10 minutes ago and like other reviewers I thought it would be too sweet- but it's not at all- all the flavors blend to make it really awesome! I also substitued half corn bread (actually cubed corn muffins) and it gave it a great flavor and texture- a keeper!

This is the best stuffing ever. Thought there would be too much fruit or be too sweet, but not. I don't like mushy stuffing so I did replace 1/4 of the bread with corn bread. Gave it good texture. I'm sure it would be great even without it though. This is my new classic turkey stuffing.

Made it for christmas eve, RAVE reviews! Makes tons of stuffing/dressing. Next time will cut down on the prunes by half.

Love this stuffing - the flavour is amazing. I used fresh herbs instead of dried, as well as fresh cranberries, for a little more intense flavour. Will definitely become a tradition at our house for Christmas!

I made this recipe for T-dinner and stuffed it in the bird. it was great. The best my husband ever tasted. I couldn't find turkey sausge so used pork. I substituted dried figs for the prunes. I also cut the recipe in half and it made plenty. I used more than 2 cups of broth, it was more like 3-4 for half the recipe.

instead of sausage, i used bacon and substituted the vegetable oil for 2 tbsp bacon drippings. i also added extra sage. i chose to use italian country bread and broiled it to crispy. all of my guests thought it was great.

I used this as a "dressing" since I consider stuffing a bird a no-no. I made it the day before and heated it in the oven before serving (I drizzled 1/2 can of chicken broth over it before baking). I used 2 loaves of French bread (minus the ends). My family loved it but I would make the following changes next time : 1) Make 1/2 the recipe. I had 10 people but with all the other items on the menu we only could eat 1/2 of what I made. 2) Make the cubes smaller as 1 inch is too big

This is a wonderful, rich tasting, old fashioned stuffing.....your guests would never guess that prunes could taste so good. In my experience, Sheila Lukins has never written a bad recipe - I still use my 20-year-old, food-stained copy of "The Silver Palate Cookbook."

This was a great recipe - funny thing is, we didn't bother to stuff the turkey with it. Instead, we used some of the drippings from the turkey and added it to the stuffing, then baked the stuffing at low heat for about 20 minutes before serving. It was excellent.

A great recipe. I used olive oil in place of the vegetable oil, and threw in a teeny bit of butter when sauteeing the onions and celery. I also added a lot more broth since I like my stuffing very moist, and baked most of it.
