We followed several of the pieces of user advice and had a total success: we added a half teaspoon of baking powder to the batter, used Guinness instead of water, and fried the potatoes twice, draining them in between fryings. We kept them warm in the oven while we fried the fish. Simple and perfect!

I substituted the water and flour for light beer and self- rising flour. The self-rising flour has salt and baking powder (which made the coating puffy & crispy). I still lightly salted, peppered and added garlic powder to the fish before frying. YUM!

To all those who rate recipies without trying them -- STOP!!! - It is unfair to do so and defeats the purpose of the rating system !!!!!

Actually, I haven't tried this particular recipe, just wanted to make a suggestion. Along with adding the beer, I add an egg yolk and let it sit for up to a half hour. Then I fold in two egg whites that have been beaten to form peaks. This gives the batter a very delicate puffy quality.

Last month a new fish and chips recipe appeared, which I believe is superior to this one. The problem with this recipe is the chips: if you only fry them once, they will taste quite raw and they'll be soggy as well. So you have to fry them again to make them crisp and puffy. And I also think that using half an inch of oil is too little, especially for frying the fish.

I didn't so much as make the recipe printed here but followed the advice of several of the reviewersof this recipe and the one from january 2004. I made a batter with 3/4 cup (half bottle) of ale with 1/4 cup each of cornstarch, cake flour, and rice flour. And I salt and peppered the fish and dredged them in all purpose flour before dipping in the batter. Wonderful. Light, crispy, and tasty.

Took everyone's advice, made it with ale, added rice flour as well. Tasted good, but it seemed the batter just fell right off the fish when removed from the oil (and some fell off while it was still IN the oil). What did I do wrong? Otherwise, like I said, tasted good....

I took the advice of the other cooks and substituted stout (Guinness) for the water and I also added some baking powder to the batter. The fish was great. . .crispy on the outside, moist and flaky on the inside. However, my chips came out soggy! If I were to make it again, I think I'd use one of those fry daddy things. Clean-up was a royal pain!

Having worked with batter coats quite a bit--baking soda will make the crust rise (puff) so that you get crispy bits, rather than a "flat" mushy coating on fish. Also, for a really crisp crust, use half cornstarch and half flour (or better yet, 1/3 cornstarch, 1/3 rice flour and 1/3 cake flour). Flour makes the crust much heavier and doughy.

If you have a non-stick electric wok, this works great - pre-set a constant temperature and use much less oil. For batter I used Bisquick and beer - will try this for chicken & chips next time.

Made this last night and it was REALLY good! I would give it 4 forks, but, I felt too many adjustments had to be made to gain more flavor and texture (used beer instead with a small amount of H2O, added the baking powder, and some Old Bay Seasoning to the batter along with some cayenne per some previous reviewers suggestions...thanks by the way!) The fish was crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside. I also took a previous reviewers advice on the potatoes , and cut them a little larger and fried them twice. Once until translucent, then drained, cooled, and fried again until golden, puffy...delicious! I would not attempt to make this dish without a covered electric deep fat fryer, though, to maintain a true constant temperature and to make that hot oil "more manageable"! I used the basket for the fries and removed it for frying the fish portions, worked very well. Served with tartar sauce for me and malt vinegar for me honey. If you like incredible tasting fried chicken once in a while try the Bon Ton-Style Fried Chicken...it it truly AMAZING!

For the batter, I used Newcastle Brown ale in place of the water and seasoned it well with kosher salt and cayenne pepper. Also, I used halibut rather than cod, and made sure the oil was heated at a steady 360 degrees. My husband said this was the best fish fry he'd ever tasted! Try it with Spicy Slaw and Cilantro-Lime Tartar Sauce, you won't be disappointed.

found the recipe to work well and as previous suggestions mention i would season the flour that you dredge the fish in prior to battering. why not try instead of just water using 750ml of room temp beer and 750ml water for the batter then mix 1/2 self raising flour and 1/2 plain flour to the liquid untill the desired consistancey is reached.I have a fish & chip shop and use a similar recipe happy battering!!!!

Made it and it tasted great. Of course, I have a deep fry thermometer, and I SEASONED THE FISH. Whenever someone says that something tastes "bland" I know they didn't put salt on the food. Pay no attention to crummy cooks. Thanks for the beer suggestion, it's a good one.

It was pretty good. Definitely bland though. Next time I would add some cayenne pepper and salt to the batter. You have to make sure the oil is at least 360F. For home made fish and chips, it was better than some take out I've had before.

True, this isn't terribly exotic or spicy. But for a good lunch or casual dinner, give it a try. I added a teaspoon of baking powder to the batter, as suggested in another recipe, and the batter seemed adequately crispy to me. Flounder also works well (a pound is about four large filets, by the way).

I substituted water with dark beer. I also used less oil. Instead of potatoes, I steamed rice. Now, I've souped up a classic recipe! Definitely making it again, especially during Halibut season.

Bland. There was nothing in the finished dish to comment on. The fish was mushy, even at different cooking times and there was no flavor- the batter made a only a thin coating. The only thing that was finished at the end of the meal was the fries. I hear the Brits have a bland diet so maybe it is a winner in their court but not mine. Best of luck.

AWSOME!!! I followed the recipe, but took the advice of the "Brits" by using 1/4 beer and a 1/4 water. Couldn't find cod or orange roughy, so used flounder instead. The fish was excellent!! I cooked the fries on a medium temperature for longer than the recipe said and they came out great too. Even my 5 year old loved it!!! Will definitely make this one again!!!!

Wow! My British husband says this is the real thing! I made a few changes to the recipe when I made it: I replaced 1/2 of the water with "good" beer (Newcastle Brown Ale, specifically) and added 1/2 tsp. salt to the fish batter. I also cut the chips a little larger than recommended, rinsed and dried them, and fried them at about 300-325 until they were golden brown (this took quite a while -- I wasn't watching how long). We'll definitely have this again!

As a Brit myself i have a few refinements to this recipe first try using a light beer instead of water (something akin to Budweiser) Secondly the chips should be fried twice, once on a low heat until they are just turning translucent, then they should then be removed from the oil and drained while the oil is heated to a high temperature when the chips should be returned to the oil and fried until golden brown and extremely crispy Thirdly both fish and chips should be cooked in a deep pan with sufficient oil to completely submerse the fish or chips.

I had not cooked Potatoes or Fish in a pan with that much grease in years. We just found that the strongest taste was the grease in both the Potatoes and the Fish. It may just be that we are not in the habit of cooking with that much oil.

If "classic" = British, you may want to try thicker chips, at least 2/3" width; soak them in water for a few minutes and dry them before frying. Even more classic, although less healthy, is to use beef dripping for frying!

This Classic Fish And Chips recipe meets the basic rules of a simple recipe except for one condition. That one condition is the fewer the numbers, the better the recipe. Skip the fractions and keep it simple with 1 pound orange roughy or cod fillets cut crosswide into 1 1/2 inch-wide strips. The recipe thus looks neater and is easier to recall plus the servings are more correct.
