I followed my fellow Torontonian's suggestions (doubling the recipe, adding extra egg and sugar) but also added a good squirt of maple syrup to the bottom of the pan before pouring in the egg mixture. Adds that extra bit of sweetness - simple and delicious!

Like many other reviewers (thanks for the heads up!) I add egg yolks and sugar to the original recipe. Sometimes I used evaporated milk when I have it on hand. This is my boyfriend's favorite dessert - his mom made it for him, and I use her custard cups. Yum! Wholesome and good! I do use some whole eggs, rather than all yolks, to keep it a little healthy.

Nice classic egg custard. I only had skim milk but added a little heavy cream and it turned out just fine. I used a clay pot to make the custard mixture on the stove and it worked very well.

I made and doubled the recipe, and it was just as I remember my mothers. I added an extra egg and yolk, increased the sugar to 3/4 c and used 1% milk and it turned out perfect. So silky and smooth and baked in 40 minutes in my white pyrex dish in the water bath. I'll be making this again for sure... definite keeper!

Made this tonight for dessert. While it is a wonderful custard, I made several revisions to it. Being the son of a retired chef & restaurant owner, I new there was not enough egg in the dish. I kicked in 2 extra yokes. Per several other reviews, I also increased the sugar to 1/2 cup. This made it a little on the sweet side, maybe slightly less than 1/2c next time. The cooking time however was totally incorrect. 35 minutes at 300 degrees did not set the custard. I wound up cooking an additional 15 minutes to set correctly. I will make this again as when eated, it was so silky in the mouth and wonderful. It is also a very easy but elegant dessert to serve anytime. Bon Apetite!

This had great flavor, but I had to cook it for 10 minuites longer to set properly. Even with this modification, it was on the soft side for an egg custard (which I liked but may not be for everyone).

This recipe will yield vanilla flavored milk. Not bad - but not a custard. It is great for a sauce to pour over ice cream but not to serve as a dessert. See other recipes that use more egg and condensed milk

I halfed the recipe and used 2 egg yolks, instead of 1 egg and 1 egg yolk (to be exact or not be). I thought is was delicious even though the custard did not set completely. I am not sure if this was becuase I had altered the recipe. Despite the hiccup, I would make it again!

Very creamy but not at all sweet enough. Followed the recipe exactly. Will try 1/2 cup of sugar next time.

I used 2% instead of the whole milk suggested and these cups still came out rich and creamy. Next time I would boil a vanilla bean in the milk to add a richer vanilla base.

Use small canning jars with lids to make individual servings. Easy to stack in fridge.

I did not have whole milk (or any milk for that matter!) so I used condensed milk diluted. The custard still turned out perfectly!

This is a beautifully simple and comforting dessert. It's easy to make, and much, much nicer than using custard powder. I'll be making this time and time again.

Simple, elegant, classic. It's exactly like the egg custards my mom made when I was growing up. Today we made this recipe together and were delighted. Now I can introduce my own daughters to a perfect little indulgence.
