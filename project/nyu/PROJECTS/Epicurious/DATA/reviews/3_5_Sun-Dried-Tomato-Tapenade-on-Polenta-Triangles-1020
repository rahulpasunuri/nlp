I have made this recipe many times. Sometimes I lower the fat by omitting the cream and the triangles can be baked in the oven. Either way it always wows my guests!

Left out the olives and added mozerella on the top. Was a huge hit at my party.

The polenta was okay and the tapenade was quite tasty. If you're having trouble with the tomato paste overpowering the olives, try using better olives. I did not have this problem and this was the most popular dish I served at my party.

I have made this recipe to rave reviews 3 times. The last time i used the ready made polenta that comes in a log ready to slice and bake/fry. I also substituted basil for parsley since that was what I had handy. I have passed this recipe on to several people. A great easy and inexpensive appetizer!

There is another recipe on this site for Sun-Dried Tomato Tapenade that is similar but easier and better (uses caramelized onions); The polenta triangles tasted delicious, but were a real nightmare to fry (they disintegrate!) -- perhaps you need to make the polenta a lot harder than I did. So I served the tapenade on french baguette slices brushed with a little olive oil and lightly toasted. Guests loved it, but the point is, while I started with this recipe, I ended up with something completely different!

This is great! I was able to make it with things I already had in the house (always a plus) and it was easy to make. I forgot to put the Tabasco in the polenta before I spread it out, so I added it while I fried the triangles. Overall, a very impressive but easy hors d'oeurve.

Made just the tapanade. Used only 1 tablespoon tomato paste (as per other raters). Very tasty. Very easy. Used on cookie cutter shaped jicama (tapenade on Jicama Stars - located on this site) and had a lovely, fun and tasty appetizer for a hot afternoon.

I just made the tapenade, using dried tomatoes without oil, and also left out the tomato paste. Added a little olive oil to compensate for the lost moisture. I'm no tapenade expert, but I thought it was mighty tasty with the focaccia. Next time I'll double the batch.

The taste of the olives was definitely overpowered by the tomato paste. Two tablespoons goes a long ways with tomato paste and I am not sure that this isn't a mistake in the recipe. I might try it again and omit the tomato paste all together, or substitute some roasted bell peppers for it. I didn't make the polenta, I used the tapenade spread on onion focacia.

Since I am not a polenta fan, I skip that part completely and serve the tapenade with french bread slices. It is a big hit!

I love this recipe. I've used it for several get togethers and potlucks. I do usually make a little more of the tapanade and make it a little spicier.

This was disappointing. I decided to try it due to other readers' comments and was looking forward to it. If I make it again, will use bigger pan for polenta - 8" square makes triangles that are way too thick for me - you get a mouthful of polenta and very little tapenade. Obviously my guests shared my opinion as nobody touched this!

This was fabulous! I made it for my mother on Mother's Day, and she just loved it! It has terrific presentation, and the polenta triangles can be served alone as well. They're very tasty! Next time I think I will double the recipe, because they were so good, I didn't have ANY leftovers!!!

This recipe is super easy and very tasty. Add lots of tobasco for extra oomph. Also, to save time and fat content, don't bother frying the polenta before topping with the tapenade. With frying, the polenta tends to crumble. My guests always rave when I serve this dish.
