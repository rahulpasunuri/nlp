This is a very flavorful stuffing. It's no wonder it has stood the test of time, considering the recipe is from the 1970s! I made cornbread, but not buttermilk cornbread, and I thought it was great. Keep stock on the side in case you find you want your stuffing more wet than dry (my husband thought this was a tad dry). Very easy to make, and I do not recommend the use of store-bought bread/stuffing cubes. The way the cornbread crumbles adds a really nice texture overall. It seems many opted against the liver, but I did not. I've cooked with livers before and like what they bring to the table. Would I notice a difference in this stuffing if I didn't use it? Perhaps. I will say the sage is so fragrant and tasty along with the onion and cornbread that there is a chance I might not notice it's missing.

I love this stuffing. The corn bread, sage, and butter give such delightful flavours. This year I made it without the liver, what a mistake! Do not leave it out. Follow the recipe as written. Looking forward to making it again~

Discovered this recipe about 4 years ago and make it every year now. It is the best stuffing I've ever made, or eaten. Looking forward to making it this year.

This was absolutely wonderful! It's a bit of work - as you have to make the cornbread as well, but definitely worth it! I followed the recipe exactly though I added a bit more chicken stock as was recommended by other reviewers. I used turkey liver and really enjoyed the flavor, but would try mushrooms next time for a different effect. An American serving Thanksgiving to the brits - and it was a big hit! Yummy!!

I made this for "Re-Thanksgiving Dinner". We went to lunch at a very high dollar fancy-schmancy restaurant for the big day & it was dreadful! All was good after making this stuffing accompanied by a 12 pound turkey cooked with the Tom Colichio recipe. The only deviation I made was to add a tablespoon of finely chopped fresh thyme and rosemary and skipped the liver (yuck!). Awesome awesome stuffing!!!

Delicious! Made my own buttermilk cornbread using another recipe from the site and substituted chopped mushroom and carrot for the turkey livers to make the recipe vegetarian. Added 2 cups of broth, and the dish came out perfectly. Crisp on top, moist in the middle with a wonderful flavor and texture.

Made this for Turkey Day and it is AMAZING! My first time making stuffing fresh! I didn't have time to make corn bread from scratch so I used Boston Market's [I had to get 8 or 9 small cornbread rolls]. I also didn't use liver [ew]. If you're not stuffing this, you'll need 3 cups of chicken broth. I'll make this every Thanksgiving now!

With less butter (I used 1 3/4 sticks for a 1.5 multiplied recipe, because it's still a ton of butter) and a lot more stock, this is perfect stuffing. Rich and buttery and very flavorful while still being traditional. I have been making it with those small changes for about 8 years now with consistently rave reviews.

This is without a doubt, my favorite stuffing. I don't ususally use the cornbread because it is not usually on hand, and I omit the chicken livers.Regardless, it is perfect with the sage and onion flavors I associate with a stuffed turkey.

The flavoring for the stuffing is spot on. The white bread helps keep the stuffing from turning into a pile of crumbs the way it would if it were all cornbread - but it had enough cornbread to flavor it nicely. My sister, who is very finicky about her stuffing, ate a plate of just stuffing. My only criticism is that it was by far too dry. I am not an experienced stuffing maker, but I agree with the chef from Minnesota that the stock needed to be upped by 1 or 2 cups if you are not planning to cook it inside a bird. I think probably closer to two.

I can't rate this recipe as I made a few minor changes. I didn't have time to make the cornbread so just used a whole wheat country loaf from a really good bakery. I added some fresh thyme and mushrooms and apple sauce. It needed a lot more chicken broth too, but the end result was fantastic, especially when I made Ina Garten's roast turkey with truffle butter. The gravy that I made from it on top of the stuffing was amazing! This recipe along with the truffle butter turkey are now my traditional holiday meal! Next time I will try the recipe as written so I can give it a fair rating. T

adding to my previous review - this did not fit into a 2 1/2 quart casserole dish. It barely fit into my 5 quart dutch oven! I'm pretty sure I measured everything right, but the bread crumbs alone overflow in the 2 1/2 quart dish called for in the recipe.

This stuffing is fantastic and easy. I made stuffing from scratch for the first time this year. I also added extra stock - about 1.2 -2 cups extra, until it "looked right." I think I could have cut back on the butter, it was delicious fresh out of the oven, but the re-heated leftovers were a little greasy (still delicious however). Instead of the the livers I added a heaping spoonful of miso to get that savory flavor- that worked great. The cornbread chunks were delightful - I baked up a batch of boxed cornbread mix the night before. They weren't buttermilk but tasted great in the stuffing none-the-less.

This is still my go to recipe for sage stuffing with a few changes. My husband has gone vegetarian and so omitted the chicken livers. I lowered the butter to 1 stick and upped the stock to 2 cups and the celery to 1 1/2-2 cups. I also added a cup of walnuts. Like an early reviewer, I found mine got too dark on the bottom, perhaps because I made it in the morning to bring someplace else and reheated it for 30 min at 350. Everyone still loved it.

best stuffing ever. Used 4 cups broth for it, perfect amount of moisture. Great that you can make it a day ahead. Everyone raved.

This is a great recipe and works well with adaptations. I make mine vegetarian using cremini and of course up the broth, cut down a little on the butter, and jack up the sage and seasoning. YUM! I've made this before but am bringing it to family 2 hours away. Won't be able to fully cook it there, just under the broiler for a minute. Would love recommendations on how long I should pre-cook or transport suggestions- thanks!

I grew up on old fashioned cornbread dressing that was NEVER served dry. Our family finds this dressing just about perfect with the following mods. Instead of 8 cups bread and 4 cornbread, we use 6/6. I dry the crumbs over night, and then toast them lightly in the oven. The dryer they are, the better they absorb the rest of the flavors. Double the amount of sage, and use six cups of stock. Yes, I said six, and no, it does not come out soupy. This is usually the favorite dish at the table, and makes great leftover turkey sandwiches. How anybody can eat this stuff with only one cup of stock is beyond me.

I haven't made this yet but it is very similar to my grandmother's which I am trying to recreate. Her trick to add moisture without fat was an 8 oz. jar of applesauce. It also gave it a slight sweetness that went well with the sage and the salitness of the gravy

This was really good, and the only changes I made were minor: I left out the chicken livers and the egg to make it vegan-friendly, and per other reviews, I added 1/2 cup more veg. broth and also added a few pats of margarine before baking. My bread crumbs came from a loaf I had baked the day before, and I left the crust on the bread before coarsely crumbling it. This was so so so good! Everyone loved it and had seconds, even the people who swore they only ate stuffing that came from a box!

Was looking for a no-nonsense "traditional" style stuffing that would go with a simple but elegant Thanksgiving spread (turkey, potatoes, veg, stuffing, etc.). We didn't need quite so much stuffing, so decreased the amount of butter by 1/3 and the amount of white bread by 1/2 (to equal parts cornbread and white bread, 4 cups each). Chopped the white bread in the food processor, to get coarse pieces (not crumbs), so it would still have some texture. I did also add a package of crimini mushrooms, and a bit of fresh thyme. I think a lot of the success came from using a rich but non-sweet cornbread (a buttermilk cornbread, not the one linked here, but similar), and making sure that the veggies were chopped finely. Be sure to taste for salt, too, since sufficient seasoning can make the difference between bland and wonderful stuffing. This will be our new default go-to stuffing recipe from now on!

I picked this recipe because it was meatless and for some reason because it was from Gourmet 1975. I was hoping for a nostalgic comfort food from my childhood. I got it! This is a very simple, basic recipe that you can go a hundred different ways with. I used veggie broth, and added almost a cup extra per other reviews. I also tossed in some chopped carrot for color and because that's the way mom always made it! I loved it, but next time I won't bake for 60 mins total, probably only 40 or so. It did get a little too dark on the bottom. I love that it relies on sage for seasoning. Gives that Thanksgiving aroma!!

Rating: 4
I made a few changes: I made boxed cornbread with a tbs of fresh sage added to the batter. I added only one stick of butter to cook the onions, and substituted 8oz of sliced cremini mushrooms and one portobello cap cut into 1/2 inch chunks instead of the liver. I added the second stick of butter after the celery. I used a vegetarian "chicken" stock, and added a little more cream and an additional egg to make up for the moisture and binding properties lost by not using liver. Making this a veggie friendly recipe, and the best stuffing I've ever had -- veggie or not.

Loved it! I took prunes and apricots and pureed them with dry bread. I was afraid family wouldn't like chunks. Cooked it all in the pumkins and loved the taste and the look! Boil pumkins only for a short time or they will begin to loose shape. I added more sage because I love it. All family 21 for Thanksgiving thought it was great!

My family and I FLIPPED OUT!! over how GOOD!! this stuffing is!! thanksgiving '08 !! I think it was my favorite part of thanksiving dinner!! I think part of the secret of what makes this so good are theese things: Make the buttermilk corn bread from scratch, make sure you use FRESH HERBS ! Use real homade chicken stock if you can and use very good quality white bread. I used Mathews organic. I picked it because it is heavy,dense and has a really good almost sourdough flavor. I would not omit or change anything in this recipie. I suggest making it as directed to get the same amazing results I did. My family will attest to that!! This recipe is now a permanant part of my regular thanksgiving menue. Remember don't change a thing!!

I fell in love with this and was the star of my family's Thanksgiving! I recommend really drying out the bread crumbs, personally I used more cornbread than whitebread, and the sweetness was wonderful with the sage and onion. I'm vegetarian so just added some sliced baby bella's at the end of sauteing the onion- not to many, just for flavor. YUM. Also poured a bit extra veg broth over the stuffing just before I started baking.

Flavor was wonderfully traditional but I agree that it was much too dry. Next time I will increase the amount of stock by half. As written, it's probably perfect for stuffing a turkey, since it will soak up additional juices as stuffing.

I made this stuffing with modifications for a crowd of 13 who adored it on Thanksgiving and the day after. Like others suggested, I decreased the butter to a single stick. I also added chanterelles and roasted chestnuts and replaced some of the celery with carrots, not being a big celery fan myself. I also used the full loaf of cornbread instead of the original 4 cups, so had to increase the liquid--I used around 2 cups of stock, 1 cup of whole milk, and 3 eggs. Perhaps my considerable alterations diminish the credibility of this review--although I have to say I adored the addition of the mushrooms and chestnuts--but I followed the cornbread and giblet stock recipe exactly and kept to the basic procedure and I really adored the results. I loved the harmony of the sweeter cornbread with the other wheaty bread I used, and I think the liver added a delectable savor. I will definitely be making this stuffing for many Thanksgivings to come.

I found this recipe to be very oily, perhaps cut the amount of butter in half or maybe use about 10 or 11 Tbs rather than two entire sticks. My fiance liked that it was crispy but I like there to be a little more varied of a texture. Good luck, it does smell nice.

Was not special and was dry even with a little extra stock. Don't know if preparing the day before and cooking on Thanksgiving affected it. Used prepared dressing mixes - both regular and cornbread - in same amounts in recipe. Did not use the liver. Added extra poultry seasoning in addition to fresh sage and parsley. Still didn't have much taste. Was very dry. Should have added more broth and butter before serving. Added them the next day when reheated the leftovers and it was more moist. I will also leave the cover on longer; didn't need 30 minutes to brown.

This was a nice twist on classic stuffing. Also a good example of the value in simply serving and smiling when people start asking about the recipe before they actually taste it. People went back for seconds and only after the meal did they find out about the chicken liver contained therein :D

I was hesitant to change up the traditional stuffing for my first time hosting Thanksgiving but after testing this recipe 5 days before the big day, I am sold. It was very very good and only a minor change from the traditional. I followed other reviewers suggestions - halved the butter, doubled the celery and nearly doubled the chicken stock. Delicious!

Wonderful recipe. Makes a great light stuffing. My new favorite !

This is my new favorite. Not trendy and full of unusual ingredients -- maybe that's why I like it; seems a little old- fashioned. For those who fear the taste of turkey liver: Relax. One small liver chopped into tiny parts is minimal but adds a very nice underlying flavor. I heeded other cooks' advice and roughly doubled the celery -- a good idea. Also, because I was a little short on white bread, I had to top off the final cup with extra cornbread instead, but that wasn't a problem. And although I am the world's biggest butter fan, I did cut back on the butter a little. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. I can see adding mushrooms in the future and maybe some toasted pecans, but this is a simple dish and I wouldn't want to tart it up too much!

This is not difficult to make, and it delicious. I did not have the corn bread, so I just used all white bread, and it was fine.

This dressing is not as heavy as others I've had in the past, and I loved it. I didn't have a turkey liver to add (Husband much pleased with this) but the taste was wonderful. I used fresh buttermilk corn bread and fresh turkey stock I'd made the day before. Although I guess store bought would be fine, I'm very aware of any increased salt in purchased products. I loved this stuffing.

This stuffing was great. I made this recipe in a vegetarian style by using portabello mushrooms instead of the meat and good vegetable stock. I also took the suggestion of using more sage than called for. Next time I make it, I'll probably use a bit more stock to make it just a little moister. Other than that, it was really delicious. My husband raved!

Awesome, awesome. This was my first time ever making stuffing and it was time consuming but easy to do. I had to double this for our family Thanksgiving and the only thing I would change the next time is amount of butter I used. I think it is a little two much and could almost be cut in half. The chicken broth helps add a good flavor. Definitely a keeper recipe though.

This was a good basic stuffing - what you'd expect for Thanksgiving. I took others suggestions and added 3 cups of celery for more crunch and 1 cup carrots for color. I also used dried Sage instead of fresh for a stronger flavor. I didn't have to add additional chicken broth. This reminded me of my Grandma's stuffing - yummy!
