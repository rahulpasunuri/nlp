This was one of several dishes I made for a big Christmas party. The chicken was very juicy and good but not exceptional. Those who ate it said it was wonderful but I had a lot left over.

A huge hit at a recent party. Usually I modify recipes after the first use, but not this one. It is full of flavor without being overwhelming. Agree that you do not want to cut this in strips before marinating and there are more sesame seeds than you can use. You do have to PRESS the seeds into the chicken, otherwise they easily fall off.

I have been making this for 12 years - one of my most popular dishes. Def do not slice chicken before marinating/cooking as one reviewer suggested - you will add alot of prep time. If you cool the chicken sufficiently and slice it against the grain with a sharp knife, it comes out beautifully.

do not cut chicken into strips before cooking as previous chef suggests, this would add huge labor time. 3/4 cup sesame seeds was a bit much. Lightly sprinkle curry onto chicken so that the chicken is still moist enough for seeds to adhere. Cut cooked chicken with scissors, it's so much easier. I'd also double the yogurt sauce if you are making for a large group.

I have made this several times as finger food for company. It's easy to make though it's not something to rave about until Kingdom Come though. It is still a nice thing to make.

I have changed smth in this recipee that made a big difference - cut the chicken breasts into stripes before marinating them in the lemon juice. Later, you'll need to cover all the stripes in sesame seeds, curry, etc.Remember, you'll need to increase the amount of lemon juice, sesame seeds and curry, to your taste. Makes a great finger-licking appetizer, my friends loved it!

I was so-so on this dish...it needs a bit more ZIP. However, I served this to about a dozen guests and just about everyone, who ate meat, thought it was great. I would suggest using regular yogurt instead of the low-fat; the sauce seemed to need more body/fat. Gee..it's only half of a cup..go for it! I also found that most of the sesame seeds stayed on the cooking sheet, but this might of been because I deserve a slap-on-the-wrist for not letting the chicken cool for the alloted time. I also would try adding more curry; maybe mix the curry, salt and pepper together and rub it into the chicken would assit bringing out the flavor.

I made this as a main course as suggested, and it was delicious. I cooked broccoli and cauliflower and we also dipped that in the sauce. We really enjoyed this one.

The chicken was a little disappointing...okay, but not great, and even though I cut the recipe in half, there were so many sesame seeds it made the texture a little unpleasant. As for the sauce... Well, I love yogurt, mango chutney and cilantro, but was underwhelmed by the combination of all three. Like the chicken, it was okay, but not great. I would've preferred a savory dip, maybe with yogurt, cilantro and some ground roasted cumin or curry powder instead. Overall, I don't think I'd make this again, because the results didn't appeal to us much.

The mango chutney/yogurt sauce was awful.

I am not a mango chutney fan, but the sauce was delicious. It absolutely makes the dish. The chicken was easy to prepare. I loved the ease of preparation and the attractive presentation. My guests loved the flavor. I will definitely serve this one again.

I made this as an appetizer for a small dinner party. We all loved it. It could make a nice main course for an informal dinner.

This recipe was a hit for my Girl's Night Out event. We went on a 2 hour bay cruise and out of the 5 appetizers that I brought onboard this was everyone's favorite! The lemon juice kept the chicken nice and moist. Definite do-over!
