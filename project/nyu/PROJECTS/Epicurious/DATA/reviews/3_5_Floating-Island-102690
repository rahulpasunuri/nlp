This was a relatively easy recipe and the results were delicious! I live a block away from Mimosa and always enjoyed this dessert there so I was thrilled to have found the recipe online. Everyone raved about it so I'll definitely make it again.

I wish there were a "maybe" button as far as whether I'd make this again. It was delicious (I love Floating Island!) and fairly easy. The only thing I didn't like was making the caramel. Boy, that sure seemed dangerous when I added the 2 cups of water! Other than that, the eating was good!

Not difficult to make but a bit tedious. Everyone was impressed when I brought it out and said it tasted good. (And there weren't any leftovers.) But I thought it was a lot of effort for something that essentially tasted like flan (because of the caramel sauce). It would have been so much simpler to make that.

Problem is: I can't find the custard recipe. Recipe begins with caramel sauce (entitled custard sauce). I know I must be having a senior moment here. Can you help? I love Floating Island.
