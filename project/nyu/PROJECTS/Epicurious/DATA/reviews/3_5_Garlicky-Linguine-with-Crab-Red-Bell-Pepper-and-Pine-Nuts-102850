This is a very good "base" to expand upon. Like most other reviewers, I did not follow the recipe to the letter. I used pan seared sea scallops instead of crab meat. I don't care for crab mixed in anything. I didn't have clam juice, so I used a blend of vegetable and chicken broths. I was a bit shy with the red bell pepper. Don't be. The flavor is so fresh. Increased the amount of the crushed red pepper. Seasoned the finished product with salt and pepper. Hubby and I enjoyed this very much.

I followed the recipe (except cutting in half for 2 people, and substituting orechiette for the linguine as I feel seafood gets lost in long noodles). I found the crabmeat to be overwhelmed by the crushed red pepper and the cheese. Next time I would omit the above and the cooking water. I might add some lemon juice. It was an attractive dish.

This was a delicious weeknight dinner. Easy to make and not a lot of clean up. The only change I made was to use the liquid from the crab instead of clam juice. I hate clam juice.

This was wonderful. I made it for Christmas eve dinner and it was a hit! I followed some advice of previous reviews and added just a touch of cream, more garlic, a can of clams and more red pepper. It was pretty and oh-so- good!

Very easy and quick. Followed the recipe pretty closely, just added a little more garlic. Fresh tasting, good!

This was delicious. I made it according to the recipe but used clams in clam sauce for the clam juice, an extra 2 cloves of garlic, shrimp, and a lb. of fresh crabmeat. Next time I will add mushrooms. I appreciated that it did not overpower the taste of the fresh crab, but complemented it.

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe. Found the recipe by paring down the search based on what I had on hand: crab, parm, parsley, pine nuts. That said, I didn't have clam juice and substituted fresh chicken stock (actually ladled it out of the pot while making stock!) It was far tastier than I had anticipated it would be.

This was a good dish, but based on other reviews here I did modify the recipe. I let the red pepper cook down more like 5 minutes rather than 2, and added shitake mushrooms along with the garlic and red pepper. I doubled the red pepper and added 1/2 cup of heavy cream, mixed and left on low while the pasta was cooking. I added minced clams along with the crab and used romano cheese instead of parmesan. It was delicious. Flavorful, robust. I used a pinot grigio for the sauce and served the same bottle with the meal. Excellent!

Excellent pasta dish. The flavors were nicely balanced. I added two more cloves of garlic and subbed 1/2 of the clam juice with chicken stock.

Maybe a little bland but good. Oh, I did substitute canned salmon for the crab cuz I had it on hand. Obviously, a bit of a different taste than crab. I also always use more crushed red pepper than called for; like double.

I thought this recipe was bland. It needs something more, maybe sundried tomatoes. I think I'll make a bisque next time I have lump crab meat on hand.

I loved this! I used lump crab & didn't have any pine nuts, so left them out. I sauteed some sliced mushrooms with the red pepper & it all came out VERY flavorful.....

I used chicken broth instead of clam juice. It just wasn't that exciting.

Oh, My, God! If you are looking for something different to do with crab, this is it. Absolutly delicious!!! The red bell pepper, (use a whole one) really cuts the heaviness of the crab, all of it combines into a delicious, comforting and very satisfying meal. Trust us. My husband and I would not lie about something like this. He had seconds! We will do this one again! We used fresh Dungeness Crab, absolutely acceptable. I used the juice off one can of minced clams, about 4 oz., was just fine. BON APPETTIT!

Maybe it was the clam juice, but the dish was far too "fishy" for my taste (and I'm a fan of seafood!). Served it over rice, and my finicky companion liked it.

I really liked this recipe. I made it when some friends came over and they loved it! Next time I'll add some more salt and even more crab (the more the merrier!)

I made this recipe as called for but used ground red pepper because I didn't have crushed. I halved the recipe and thought this was delicious. I used lump crab not jumbo which I prefer to use for crab cakes. Didn't have any problem with the pasta not absorbing the extra clam juice and pasta water. This was quick and easy, definitely a keeper!

The only change I made is substituting cashews for pine nuts (thanks to living out in the sticks). I found this recipe to be pretty good, although I suspected it would be far to liquidy if I followed it directly. Thus, I ommitted the held back pasta water and I reduced the peppers misture far longer than the recommended 2 minutes. It was good, although surprisingly mild. Next time I make it I will up the crushed red pepper. In its current configuration, we couldn't taste the heat.

I've made this dish countless times with canned lobster meat instead of crabmeat and it is wonderful. I also cut back on the garlic since I'm not a huge fan - it doesn't need more than one or two cloves. I definitely recommend serving it with parmesan cheese and it makes a very pretty dish for company.

I made this one night when my fridge was pretty close to empty. I used canned lump meat crab, added some saffron and went very light on the red peppers. It turned out great.

I went searching for a crab and pasta combination, this one is a keeper!!!! I used chicken stock and added a splash of lemon juice, jumbo lump crab is a must.

This reminded me of a pasta I had in San Francisco--delicious, but it's a party dish and you've got to spring for fresh crab. (It worked great once with shrimp, too, but we've got shrimp coming out our ears.) I never know what to say when some say a dish is bland and others say the crab is overwhelmed by the spicy sauce. Maybe to each his own?

We made this dish as a last minute company dinner using shrimp instead of the clam juice and spicy chicken bouillon instead of the clam juice. I thought it was absolutely delicious as did my opinionated husband and our guest. We are having it again tomorrow for more guests. I highly recommend this easy and flavorful dish.

Boring. I couldn't even taste the crab ... it was just too bland. The pasta, garlic, red pepper are great but not with this mix ...I'd try it with spiced shrimp to give it the kick it needs instead of crab.

The crab was too diffused in this recipe. A waste of really good blue crab, in my opinion. Too improve it, I think I would make the sauce ingredients separately, and toss with the pasta at the last minute, rather than stirring the clam juice, etc., into the pasta.

This was so good! What an easy and quick beautiful pasta dish. I didn't measure out the crushed red pepper and it had a little kick! We loved it!

I have made this recipe at least 12 times. It's easy to vary. I've also made it with shrimp, scallops and tuna. My family loves it.

This is a great pantry recipe. All the ingredients can be stored easily and it is great for a quick, but impressive meal. If the price of the crab meat is daunting, you can substitute canned crab claws which just pick up the color of the red peppers.

I really missed something here - this was a waste of some great crab. To make it somewhat good I doubled the amount of garlic and added some tomatoes and basil. otherwise, yuck!

This is an excellent recipe, just enough spice not to overpower the crab. I served this to friends and they just loved it.

Even though I agree with the Cook from Boston below that the sauce is too wet and the crab does tend to get lost, I still like this dish. It's beautiful for one thing and the pine nuts add a lot. Fairly low fat too. I've started adding 2-3 tablespoons of Ricard (or Pernod--french anise liqueur) and that seems to supply the kick it lacks. A few shrimps or scallops would help too. Hold back on adding the extra pasta cooking water unless it really is dry.

i made a few substitutions on this recipe, first i used fake crab meat & real canned crab together & only used the liquor from the crab instead of the clam juice, and & i added freshly toasted bread crumbs to this recipe in addition to the pine nuts & parmesan. this is a great impress the boss recipe. it's elegant, oh so easy to make & present!

We loved this dish. It had a simple taste but quite yummy. Normally I wouldn't have added pine nuts or red pepper but these ingredients were essential in this dish. I bought 2lbs of crab legs and cooked and shelled myself since my store doesn't carry fresh lump crabmeat. Whew! It was labor intensive but worth it.

A mildly pleasant sweet pepper sauce, but without enough body or flavor to it. The crab absolutely gets lost in this dish. If I even tried this inoffensive but unimpressive dish again, I would add tomato paste and thick Korean chilli paste to the sauce to make it coat the pasta better. The nuts and cheese were the only things that gave this flavor--and some fresh cilantro and the green parts of scallions I desperately added at the end. There are better pastas around, for sure.

This recipe was very good. I cut back on the butter (1 tbl) and used 2 tbls of olive oil. I had clam sauce instead of juice and added some mushrooms that I needed to use up. I don't know how to toast parmesian cheese so I just sprinkled some on. Definately a dish to make again.

Outstanding flavor and very quick & simple!! Due to availability, I used approx 1/2 lb fresh crab (2 King crab legs). I will definitely use 1 lb of crab next time, or possibly shrimp and scallops instead. Thanx! sm

This dish was very easy to make and is a nice alternative to the more typical heavy seafood pasta cream sauces. Although I only used 1/2 lb of fresh crab meat, there was plenty incorporated w/the pasta to fill up my guests.

I work as a chef on a yacht for a family and they all loved this dish. I did however use shrimp and scallops instead of crab, and the flavors were wonderful.

Fantastic dish and easy to prepare. Living in Seattle makes it possible to find the freshest crab meat, which is essential to this recipe. I've made it twice already.
