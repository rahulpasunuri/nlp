This is a weak imitation of actual Pho. I've never found a recipe that works as a short-cut to anything resembling Pho, and this is no exception.

Ugh, I was so disappointed by this recipe. I'm not sure if it's the cinnamon stick or the beef broth, but my version came out incredibly bitter. I ended up dumping the broth and just eating the noodles and veggies by themselves.

I thought this was a great quick weeknight soup. I love traditional pho and this was an easy to make home version.

I used thin rice noodles as well, and simply added them to the simmering broth about three minutes before I added the beef. Pretty good for a weeknight meal with little prep.

Certainly not quite as complex as a traditional pho but quick, easy and pretty good. Hubs ate it for dinner AND lunch the next day... AND liked it. I added extra broth and used rice noodles which should be as easily attainable as ramen (yuck).

Many anti-cancer foods in this one! Gluten-free eaters can use rice noodles instead of ramen. However the garlic will drown out the ginger. Not that it's a bad thing--ginger could be in there just for the good it does you. With ginger, your body uses its own oxygen 21% more efficiently.

Ramen noodles is an absurd idea. Rice noodles only. Canned broth, better yet, canned consomme, will work, jazzed up with all these spices. I hate beef leather, and always put the slices raw on the noodles and the boiling broth cooks the meat all that is required.

Please! Here is a better Faux Pho (sorry about the format--this site doesn't allow any other): Makes about 5 cups 5 cups canned low-sodium chicken broth 4 medium garlic cloves, smashed and peeled 1 2-inch ginger, peeled, cut into 1/8-inch rounds, and smashed 2 3-inch cinnamon sticks 2 pods star anise 2 tablespoons Asian fish sauce 1 tablespoon soy sauce 1 tablespoon sugar Bring all ingredients to boil in medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to low; simmer partially covered to blend flavors, about 20 minutes. Remove solids with slotted spoon and discard. Cover and keep hot over low heat until ready to serve. 8 ounces thick rice noodles 1 recipe Quick Vietnamese-Style Broth Salt 12 ounces sirloin steak, sliced crosswise into 1/4-inch strips Ground black pepper 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 2 cups bean sprouts (about 5 ounces) 1 jalapeño chile, sliced thin 2 scallions, white and green parts, sliced thin on an angle 1/3 cup loose-packed basil leaves, torn in half if large 1/2 cup loose-packed fresh mint leaves, torn in half if large 1/2 cup loose-packed fresh cilantro leaves 2 tablespoons chopped roasted unsalted peanuts Lime wedges 1. Bring 4 quarts water to boil in large pot. Off heat, add rice sticks, and let sit until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and distribute among four bowls. 2. Meanwhile, make Quick Vietnamese-Style broth, seasoning with additional salt if necessary. 3. Season steak with salt and pepper. Heat oil in medium skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add half of steak slices in single layer and sear until well-browned, 1 to 2 minutes on each side; set aside. Repeat with remaining slices. 4. Assemble soup and serve immediately, passing lime wedges separately. Yields 4 servings.

My husband and i though this was great (even if not-so traditional). We used Udon noodles, though. The Ramen did not really appeal to me. Our pepper was really potent, so i fished the slices out after soaking in my bowl for about 2 min. Super good the day after too!

I've made this twice and realizing that it's just a quick pho, I thought it tasted very good for the amount of time that it takes to make it.

@ E.D. Did you miss the title? It's easy Pho. Anyway, did anyone else try this recipe? I'm skeptical that broth from the store will do the trick.

I have been making a variation of this soup for years, and I realize it is a Faux Pho, but I agree with Dragon that you can not use instant Ramen Noodles....they tend to be mushy and tasteless.......that is just wrong!!

The ramen noodles upset me. Pho should ONLY have rice noodles.
