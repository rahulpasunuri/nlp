This went over very well at my dinner party. Especially good during warm weather! I added the juice of 1 lemon to to give it a little zing. I served it in martini glasses with coconut meringues and a dessert wine from the Okanagan alongside.

Not bad, since this was my first day in making granita's it turned out o.k. (pretty simple to make actually), my only suggestion is to add a bit more sugar (this was too icy for me) but not too much otherwise it will stay a liquid.
