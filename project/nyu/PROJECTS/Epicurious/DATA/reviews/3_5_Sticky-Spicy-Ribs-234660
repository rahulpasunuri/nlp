These ribs turned out super tasty but I was disappointed that they were not very spicy, next time I will add some fresh chipotle to the sauce and a little more chilly powder to the rub. However, these ribs were still really tasty and I would definitely make them again!

I understand both the detractors and the apologists of this recipe. I had one bite that was divine but overall felt it missed the mark a bit. I agree that there's too much cumin in the rub, but that's easy to adjust. The rub is excellent and is the best part of the recipe. The sauce can't be judged until it's cooked fully on to the ribs. Having said that, I'll probably try a different sauce next time. If the rub is a 10, the sauce is an 8. I'll be looking for that perfect 10 sauce next time!

Amazingly the best ribs I've ever had.

The best oven ribs I've ever had. Made these with a spicy ketchup (Melinda's habanero) because it was what I had on hand. I worried the sauce was too spicy but it turned out to be perfect on the ribs. Will add chilis to regular ketchup next time!

Excellent recipe. Our guests, not typical rib eaters, thoroughly enjoyed them. Both kids and adults asked for seconds.

Holy smokes, these ribs are to die for! I did them in the oven, as per the directions, as our BBQ is out of commission. My husband stopped talking during the meal - he just ate. And ate, and ate, and ate. Will make again - likely many, many times!

I cooked ribs for the first time on New Year's Eve using this recipe. They turned out great and were very moist and delicious. The sauce is exceptionally flavorful. I used 2 racks of spare ribs instead of baby backs with no problem. I would recommend making the extra effort and grilling the ribs at the end. It makes them crispy and lends some smoke flavor. Goes great with the black eye pea corn muffin recipe on epicurious.

Made this for a birthday party. Everyone commented that they liked them. Made six racks and only had a few ribs left. I had lots of sauce left ...

I used the rub for this recipe and cooked them for 4 hours then I added a bottle of Roscoe's barbecue sauce because its my absolute favorite. Talk about Easy and flavorful! Wow that rub is a winner. Kids who don't usually like ribs, loved it and my brother in law who is extremely picky loved it and asked me to make them again. So easy its not a problem!

these were AMAZING. I tweaked the recipe a bit in order to use up a half of a green bell pepper and the juice of an orange. that might have helped balance the tanginess of the sauce that other reviewers mentioned. I also made the sauce earlier in the day and reheated it when I needed it so that the flavors would meld. The chipotle powder made it. I know that we will make these again.

Delicious and easy...and baking in the oven makes for clean up a breeze.

Makes excellent ribs and is a very forgiving recipe. I have let the ribs dry rub over night and kept them in the oven for 4 hours without apparent ill effects. The amount of sauce is excessive -- you can half the sauce amount still and have plenty.

We LOVED this recipe. The ribs have a little heat to them so be careful with children. They are very flavourful and tender.

These ribs were delicious. Everyone liked them. You know something is good when nobody says a word and are all eating the same part of the meal. I read previous reviews about people not liking the sauce. It was a bit sweet but I did reduce both the salt and the soy sauce because people said it was too salty. Next time I will leave the salt as the recipe calls for. I prefer the ribs with the sauce cooked onto the meat. It took a little extra work to get these done but I think next time I'll leave them in the oven since it will be snowing here within the next month.

I've tried a lot of rib recipes and this is one of the best. A little on the salty side. Next time I'll skip adding extra salt to the sauce and use a low-sodium soy sauce, but there will definitely be a next time.

this was sooo good. did not put in as much chile powder as called for bc 4 yr old. Would be even better I think if added full amount. Meat was literally falling off the bone. YUM!

Rating: 3
I didnt make the sauce (ran out of time), but the rub was very nice. I liked the oven to grill method, but do feel that the meat got a bit dry (the larger chunks). Overall, very easy, nice flavor, and I'll definitely try it again with the sauce - the added basting may decrease the dryness factor.

Rating: 3
The consistency and texture of the ribs turned out great. I liked the rub much more than the sauce. Once the sauce is baked into the ribs, it tastes great. However, the sauce on its own, is too tangy for our taste. I think I'll keep the rub recipe but keep looking for the right sauce.

Rating: 4
I've made this recipe several times for my family and it has always turned out great (and we aren't usually rib lovers). I usually cook it for a little longer than directed and add extra brown sugar to the sauce, but other than that the recipe is perfect. I also baste the ribs with a lot of sauce, so it isn't needed on the side. The leftover sauce is a great complement to other dishes.

Delicious! My first time using a rub. I used ancho chili powder instead of chipotle, as I had it in my pantry. When it came time to grill the ribs, I put them on the top rack of my gas grill and "sauced" them toward the end, intentionally leaving a few "rub only" areas. My three guys thought they were great (sauced or dry) and ate every single rib -- even with sides of corn on cob, baked sweet potatoes, green beans with bacon and onions, and cornbread.

This was my first attempt at ribs, and since we live in an apartment, I had to make sure the recipe allowed for oven baking/broiling. I was worried they wouldn't be quite as good as grilled ribs, but I really shouldn't have worried. They were marvelous! The dry rub was smoky and gave off just a bit of heat, and the sauce, once cooked, was aromatic and delicious. To those who said the sauce was too vinegary, salty, sweet, etc.- did you wait until it was done cooking on? Because once it has cooked onto the ribs in the final forty minute stage, you cannot taste any of the individual components of the sauce. We only did 3 lbs of baby backs- there is only two of us- and didn't reduce the sauce at all (I made the rest exactly as is) There was a lot of sauce left over, but we managed to rub most of the dry mix into the ribs. I wouldn't alter the recipe at all until you know exactly what the finished product tastes like.

I like the cooking process. I made them in the oven and broiled them at the end. They look just like the picture. I will do it again with a different sauce but, use the same rub . I thought the soy sauce was too much.

This was my first time cooking ribs, and I followed the recipe exactly, except I doubled everything to make a lot (for the leftovers). Everyone loved it - including me and I don't usually eat pork!! I reheated the small amount of leftovers the next day with the leftover bbq sauce poured over the top in the oven for 25 minutes at 350 and people were fighting over them...I served boiled mini potatoes, rainbow slaw and corn, blackbean & tomato salad with them.

This weekend I will be making this GREAT dish again. To each their own for taste, but to those who thought this took 40 mins & under rated it due to your misunderstanding, re-read the instructions. Thank you Epicurious! I can always count on your site to have GREAT recipes! A 'great' food lover only!

This is the worst sauce recipe I have ever eaten. I tasted it,threw it out and started again. I had used a lite salt version of the soy sauce;yet it still tasted like brine. Yack.

Excellant!! Only modification is less salt but otherwise finger licking good ribs. I have made this twice and passed it on to family members.

It takes some time to make these, but they are soooo good. Definitely worth the time put in. You will have leftover sauce and rub to use in the future too.

Will make again, but with a little more sugar and a lot less vinegar in the sauce. Precooked at 275F for 2-1/2 hours.

These ribs were terrific. I left the rub on overnight, and left them warming in my oven (heat off)for at least another 2 hours after the initial baking. The grilling added the final touch. A family favorite.

Rating: 4
My family of rib fanatics thought these ribs were the best they had ever tasted (quite a compliment from this crew). The only criticism was that the sauce overwhelmed the ribs and was not needed on the side (but definitely do baste them with the sauce while grilling). I will definitely make these again very soon.

Took this recipe to a neighborhood party and it got rave reviews. The ribs are spicy, as the Chipoltle adds warm heat but the vinegary/sweet sauce helps to balance. ENJOY!

Good, but we didn't think they were as great as others seem to ... we though the sauce was so-so and needed some doctoring as it was too tart originally. The rub did work pretty well on the ribs, though. I think we'll keep searching for our perfect babyback rib recipe. This wasn't it for us.

I didn't think it was possible to grill great ribs in 40 minutes and I was right. We may try this again, but this time cook them much, much slower.

The search is over - this is THE rib recipe that we will use from now on. My family loves it. In fact, last time I made it my six- year-old said "Mommy, you make the best ribs in the universe!" And six-year-olds don't lie. It's absolutely perfect.

We have used this recipe many times, however we grill our ribs over a charcoal/wood fire. It is fabulous as written and we have had a lot of fun bending the recipe. WE love the taste of the smoked chipotle chili powder.

Making this excellent dish again tonight reminded me to send in a review.The marinade and sauce are really good.I do the whole thing in my oven,making it ahead of time up to the basting-with sauce-part. It's delicious, easy and convenient to make.

We were quite disappointed with this recipe. The Alton Brown recipe for Baby Back Ribs is much better.

This rib recipe was a hugh hit with my family, as well as, the neighbor that happened into our yard while the ribs were on the grill. The meat literally fell off the bone. The rub and sauce flavors worked wonderfully together. I've used the recipe twice already, with a promise to make it again this summer for the neighbors! BTW- The leftover sauce froze well and works great for BBQ chicken.

I would have to think long and hard about this recipe if I were to make it again. I used boneless ribs so I tried to adjust down the baking and grilling times, and I guess I didn't do a very good job. The meat was overcooked and dry. IF I make this again. I would delete the oven step entirely and sear the meat on the grill to seal in the juices, and then grill the ribs very slowly over indirect heat until they are done. Then it would be a different recipe. "Orange Soy Baby Back Ribs" from this site (5 ingredients) is equally good, and so is "Prize Winning Baby Back Ribs" from "allrecipes.com". Both of these are MUCH simpler!!!

I'd really like to give this recipe two and one-half stars, because as another reviewer said, it's too much effort for a good but not great dish. My very favorite rib sauce is from the original Silver Palate Cookbook, page 14. It is incredibly simple and delicious. Over med heat in a small saucepan, whisk together 1/2 C. dijon mustard with 1 tsp. dry mustard, then add 1/2 C. honey, 1/3 C. apple cider vinegar, 1/3 C. packed light brown sugar, and 1T. soy sauce and 1T. sesame oil. Simmer over low heat about 10 min. Season ribs w/salt & pepper (I use pork babyback ribs), and then baste them a few times near the end of the cooking time. Serve extra sauce on the side. I guarantee you will lick your plate clean!

My family is partial to a Jimmy Schmidt rib recipe and loathe to try any other version, but the picture convinced them to give it a shot. All agreed these were quite good if not the best they've ever had. I usually parboil them in a solution of tasty things but baking is easier. I didn't use pan drippings, since it's only grease . . . All in all, worth trying.

Way to much time and effort involved for the outcome, I would omit the ginger for sure if I were to make it agin althought I doubt that I would!

My family really enjoyed these ribs. They're tangy, not too sweet -- a good basic recipe. The sauce smells strongly of vinegar on the stove but combines well with the dry rub when grilled. This dish can be made gluten-free by using gluten-free ketchup and soy sauce. I might try adding a little dry mustard to the sauce next time.
