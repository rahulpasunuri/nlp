Excellent!!! I am not a huge dessert fan and I went for seconds on this one. Wonderful blend of flavors. I did only use half the amount of honey called for. I think using the full amount would have been a tad too sweet for my taste. I would not make this without the orange flower water, the taste really came through. Also, I pan fried the polenta. It was too cold to fire up the grill. I will definitely make this again.
