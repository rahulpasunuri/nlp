Delicious combination of flavors. One of the things I like best about it is keeping the kumquats and the cranberries separate until serving. The contrast between the red cranberries and the golden kumquats is beautiful. Although it tastes as good the next day, after the cranberries have colored everything red, why not have the short-term visual pleasure first.

Excellent! The family is spoiled forever...no more cran-in-a-can for Thanksgiving. I personally found it a bit too sweet, but by cutting down on the sugar and adding a tiny bit of key lime juice, I found it alot more pleasing.

Excellent recipe, a new thanksgiving tradition for my family! However, I did find it just a bit too sweet, so I cut down the sugar to 3/4 cup and added 1 tsp key lime juice. But I guess it all depends on your sweetness preference. It was VERY tasty though, we'll never go back to that icky-in-a-can stuff ever again!

This was one of the most delightfully different cranberry sauces I've ever tasted. I'm making it again this year and intend to make it part of my family's Thanksgiving tradition
