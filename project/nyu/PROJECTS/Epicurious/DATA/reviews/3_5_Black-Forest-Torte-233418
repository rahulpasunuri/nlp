I am a classic trained pastry chef and instructor, and don't recommend this recipe. The elements are delicious on their own, but together they just don't work. The brownie is too heavy and difficult to cut with the wonderful cream on top. (The fact it must be chilled does not help.) The cherry preserves on top bleed into the cream, bad presentation. I really wanted this to work, loved the idea, and normally trust Dorie's recipes. But its just not worth the cost of these ingredients and time of many steps. What happened Dorie? Wish she or epicurious would respond and also address the possible mistake in ingredients mentioned by so many other reviews.

Really wonderful presentation. I did not switch the preserves, but added a T or two to the 3 T amount. Chopping the dried cherries is a must, I think. I'd also chop the chocolate chips, as it wasn't a welcome addition for the texture, (but added to the chocolate decadence). I also whipped the cream to soft peaks before adding to the mousse, so thanks to the other reviewers. I added a top layer of sweetened, chantilly cream, which was a nice addition. I would have liked a half recipe more of the mousse, but the cream made up for it. Would be nice with a layer of cherry preserves along the top as well. Served it at a Memorial Day Picnic, and went over very well. I'd suggest pre-slicing the cake when serving buffet style; no one realized how dense the chocolate brownie was, and people were cutting massive slices for themselves, then apologizing for not finishing them. All reviews were positive, most ravingly so. Big hit, good impression.

Made this for a Valentine's Day Party and it was the hit of the evening! I only used bittersweet chocolate, not semi-sweet and was glad I made that change. Super moist & super rich! Oh...and did I say easy? It was a snap to make.

This is truly an amazing recipe that I will make again.. but I will make it in a larger spring form pan.. maybe 10", or in a sheet pan like brownies.. Very difficult to get even baking here. inside too wet.. outside starting to burn. It was incredibly difficult to cut.. Flavor-wise outstanding.. I did substitute milk Chocolate chips for semi- sweet.

It was very good, the mousse was outstanding. I followed the advice below of switching the quantity of preserves. I'll use the mousse again, not as sure on the "brownie".

I've made this cake twice - for Christmas dinner dessert for the family, and a New Year's Eve party for teenagers, and both times it was very well-received. I definitely benefitted from reading all of the reviews. I pureed the dried cherries to be added to the brownie so there wouldn't be big chunks. It's rich and delicious, and tastes better after a day in the refrigerator.

Not the greatest, despite sounding quite attractive. The brownie, as mentioned in previous reviews, was difficult to cook evenly; the edges were too well done when the center was good. The mousse was good, but not terrific; wasn't particularly interesting in my opinion. The brownie part was definitely the better of the two; and the sum in this case did not seem to be greater than the parts. Would not make again. There are better recipes with chocolate, cherries, and kirsch.

I loved this. I read all the previous reviews and decided to make it as it is written. The brownie layer was thick and fudgy. If I had switched the amount of cherry preserves, I think it would not have turned out. The cooking time was fine also. And if you use heavy cream, then you do not need to whip the cream before you add it to the cream cheese mixture. I also strained the pureed cherry preserves before I piped them onto the top of the mousse. I ended up having a little left after, so I used it as a sauce on the plate. I did make two minor substitutions to the ingredients, but will make sure not to the next time. I used all cream cheese because I had a hard time finding mascarpone. And instead of kirsch, I used extra water and added pure almond extract. I thought it was fine, but the kirsch would have been even better. I'm a huge fan of black forest cake, and this did not disappoint. I will definitely be making this again. I cater weddings and would even consider using this as part of a dessert buffet. It's elegant and beautiful, and very rich.

Funny, I too had to convince guests that this wasn't bought. Very rich and dense, so slice thin when serving, and read the earlier reviews for corrections, the cherry quantities are nearly reversed, and the baking time may be off. After reversing the quantities, I would reduce the cherry conserve in the cake, and I'm not normally one to shy from rich desserts. Very impressive.

Thanks to all the reviews the dish turned out good. Looked great and everyone thought it was store bought. For me the brownie was too dense and didn't quite like the dried cherries but loved the mousse. Probably won't make it again, everyone liked it but there are plenty more desserts out there worth the effort.

This was a giant hit at our Christmas Eve party. I always make a fairly elaborate dessert, but our guests couldn't believe that this was homemade. It is very rich,so I happily had leftovers.

Thanks to all of the reviewers for leaving comments--they all worked and saved the recipe. I did have some brown edges so I used an extra long serrated knife and just took off 1/8" top layer. Another tip: because this is so rich/sweet, it feeds a lot of people. I made an 11" cake (for a crowd of 15 with 2 other desserts) and I could have made a 9" cake and been fine.

WAY to sweet and rich. Will try without the dried cherries and use only the 12 oz. of cherry preserves. The Mascarpone mousse is FANTASTIC though. Will use that again. Will try to find a lighter/less dense cake version of this recipe.

Major rave reviews. I did the switch with the Cherry preserves. I had only one problem and that was with the cherry mixture. When I added the preserves it was perfect, then when I heated it, it turned to total liquid so next time I'm not cooking the mixture after I add the preserves. I used some corn stqrch and thickended it so no problem in the long run but had to add extrta step. This one is worth all the pots and pans. It is also a beautiful presentation.

I was VERY happy with the way this turned out!! It was EXCELLENT! I switched the preserve amounts and the brownie cooked perfectly at about 60 minutes although the edges were a little too brown. I whipped the cream for about 3 minutes before adding it to the mascarpone. I could NOT find mascarpone anywhere in our small town so substituted neufchatel which tasted wonderful. I think next time I would also chop the cherries up smaller before adding them to the mix just for aesthetic purposes. I added chocolate chips, but not the full amount - maybe a few tablespoons. The pepper wasn't really all THAT noticeable EXCEPT for the pieces that I neglected to grind up as fine as I should have, and got stuck in the teeth!! Make sure you grind them up really well! The mousse was the perfect texture and I didn't have too much trouble with the cherry topping. All in all a GREAT dessert and one that will definitely see a second round!

I've made this recipe twice. First time I followed the recipe to the letter and received raves. The second time, I switched the preserve amounts, only had a quarter of required mascarpone (substituted cream cheese with no noticeable difference)and thickend the preserves by boiling with a little cornstarch. The brownie was very good both times and the second cake looked a lot better because of the thicker preserves. Both times everybody loved it. Definitely a keeper. Lookout when boiling the kirsch, mine ignited before I lit the match!

I made this cake exactly as written, only I used an 8 1/2" pan which resulted in a "taller" brownie base. I thought that this was fantastic. Next time that I make it, I will switch the cherry preserves..you really only need two ounces for the decoration ontop. I had it as part of an appitizer/dessert New Year's Party and it was the hit of all the desserts. Give it a try, and be sure to swith the amounts of preserves, and you won't be sorry.

After reading all the reviews I was a little reluctant to make this, but the combination of cherries, chocolate and the cream mouse sounded to good to pass up. I was glad I made it! It was excellent, I followed the recipe exactly. The preserve amount is switched, less for the topping more for the cake. It was even better the next day, nice and moist. Do not overbake and it will be a HIT!!!

Overall the cake was delicious but I was not happy with the "done-ness" of the brownie, it was hard on the outside edges but not really done on the inside. Even though I cooked it far longer than the recipe's suggested time, the chocolate chips were still hard and the consistency of the brownie not very cake-like. I did whip the cream before making the mousse topping and was very pleased with how it turned out, I also followed others' advice about using the bigger proportion of preserves for the cake and not the topping. Also I had to laugh at the part of the recipe that called for flaming the kirsch -- the stuff I bought at my local liquor store must have been mostly water since putting a lit match to it only resulted in extinguishing the match! All in all, the entire cake was eaten so I guess it was a success!

"The best cake ever!" said my sister on her Christmas birthday. I make her birthday cake every year and this was the best yet! The brownie is not overly sweet, I used 60% bittersweet chocolate chips for the melted chocolate and the chips. I made this exactly as written except my baking time was about 65-70 minutes total. Great Cake!

Wow! Everyone loved it. Do not have any preconceptions about how this should turn out. Maybe the brownie is supposed to be really rich and the topping is supposed to be runny initialy. It firms up as it chills. Follow the recipe (watch that cooking time, my oven runs hot and it only took 45 minutes). Cannot wait to make it again.

I followed the recipe exactly. Had to bake it 20 min longer to firm up the center. I wondered why the cream wasn't whipped (like most mousse). Twelve oz of preserves would have been way too much for the topping. All in all it came out really good but next time I'll whip the cream and leave the choc chips out of the brownie ( I thought they were just too much). I made it Christmas Eve dinner.

I put the 12oz of preserves in the brownie, used bittersweet chips instead of semisweet, and added 3/4 c of slivered almonds. The brownie was dense, with a texture similar to a flourless chocolate cake. The next time I make this, I'll pick the cherries out of the 3 tbl of topping. The amount was so little, the food processor didn't do a good job of chopping the cherries, and they kept plugging the hole in the bag. I baked it almost 70 minutes, because I didn't think it was done. It was too long, because the sides were a little crusty. Stick to the recipe on baking time, and know that it will have a flourless cake texture. I served this for Christmas and very one raved about it! I will definitely make it again!

I read all the reviews before I decided to make this. I took into account where some believed there was a typo 12 oz. vs 3 Tbl. I added the 12 oz to the brownie mix and it was very dense almost to the point of not being able to cut it. I don't believe that the 12 oz. belongs in the brownie mix. It was good despite being so dense. Maybe Bon Appetit will let us really know if there is a mistake.

I followed the recipe as printed and it was rich, elegant and delicious. I am curious about the mystery surrounding the amount of cherry preserves in the brownie vs. the mousse (as discussed by many reviewers). When I pureed the 12 oz. of preserves I realized it would be too thin to pipe on the mousse. So I simply added some kirsch and used it as a SAUCE, dribbling it on each cut, plated slice. Oh-I took another reviewer's hint and did whip cream slightly before addding to mascarpone. The torte is rich and decadent...one of my guests claimed he was getting a chocolate "buzz!"

A lot of work for little return. The ckae didn't cook in the time the recipe called for and so it was a little crusty on the outside and far too dense on the inside and I didn't care for the topping and I normally love mascarpone. This was a big disappointment.

Rating: 2
Well, if the typo wasn't there, this might have come out better. I should have realized that the 3 oz. of preserves was for the top and the 12 oz. for the brownie. It definitely does not need the entire cooking time as shown. Everyone liked it, but I am not sure if that was because they were being polite, I thought it was okay.

I made this for a special dinner with friends. I followed the recipe exactly although, because I have a convection oven, I lowered the temp to 325 and baked it for 54 min. I thought the torte itself was divine. The mousse was a bit odd. I would reduce the cherry preserves for piping next time because it was much too thin. Overall my friends thought it was great and it was evident that a lot if effort went into the dessert.

This is quite wonderful especially for the holidays. I agree with most cooks about their additions and corrections: Check cooking time to prevent dryness of brownie. The typo: 12oz cherry preserves should be in dried cherry mix and 3oz. for decoration; and boil down to thicken. Whip cream slightly before adding to cream cheese and mascapone frosting. Also, I would give the cooked dried cherries a quick rough chop before adding to brownie mix.

Stunning dessert. Rich and complex without being overbearingly heavy, which was impressive to me considering all the ingredients involved. Great texture between the brownie and the mousse. The cherry brownie cake by itself would be delicious in bar form... the mousse topping makes it more elegant and special. I used pureed cherry preserves with no difficulty in piping. And be sure to include the pepper but don't tell your guests... only if you pay close attention, you can tell the pepper flavor is there, and it's a nice surprise that I suspect helps in cutting down the richness of the cake. Overall, it does take some effort and cleanup to make this cake (multiple steps) but it's absolutely worth it for any chocolate lover!

I haven't yet tried this recipe but intend to. When I do, I'll use the 3 tbl of preserves as the topping and the 12oz, in the brownie. I suspect the recipe contains a typo.

I had the same problem with the preserves running on the topping. I just noticed next to the picture in the magazine, it says "whipped" cream (unlike the recipe itself), so I'll try whipping it first next time. The preserves were also not thick enough to hold, so I'll try reducing that as well

I made this for a Christmas dinner with friends. I also found the sides to be pulling away from the edges and cracking, but the middle was still not fully cooked. I could only find cherry jam, and it was not easy to pipe at all because it was so runny. It kind of spread out on the top and didn't look nearly as nice as the picture. If I can't find cherry preserves next time, I will puree the jam, put it through a strainer to get rid of chunks, then either add gelatin or cook it down until it's thick. All in all, it was a huge hit. The brownie was decadent!

Rating: 2
Had the exact same problems as the first reviewer. At the recommended cooking time, the edges of the cake were overdone, the middle didn't look quite set so I hadn't pulled it out of the oven earlier. Also, the mousse needs either less cream, or the cream needs to be whipped before mixing with the cheeses. Very impressive looking and overall terrific flavour so I'd make it again with a bit of tweaking. The pepper doesn't really add anything to the flavour of the cake, just a bit odd, wouldn't add it next time.

i made this recently for a dessert party. the flavors are great, but i had trouble getting the mousse to set up properly. if i make this again (a good chance) i'll whip the cream and fold it into the cream cheese mixture. regarding the brownie, i underbaked it 10 mins, but still thought it was too dry - start checking it around 35 mins.
