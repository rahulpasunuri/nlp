This is a keeper. It is perfection nearing nirvana. I doubled the recipe. Substituted Rosemary. instead used Thai Basil leaves only finely minced. Garlic finely minced. Used equal parts Chardonnay and white vinegar in order to up the acid level. Before reaching first boil I added 1/4 tsp. butter to keep foam down and increase clarity. I made this for Christmas present baskets. But in all honesty, its going to hard to share. I used 4 oz jelly jars. Even a novice will be able to have success with this wonderful recipe.

I was terribly disappointed with this recipe. For me,the flavors really didn't combine well, and I so wanted them to. I love garlic, I love rosemary, and I love lamb, so it really should have worked. But it didn't. I tasted the jelly after making it, and was disappointed, but thought maybe when combined with food it would be better. Unfortunately, this was not the case. I was planning on using this as gifts, but instead it will be going down the drain. Save yourself a lot of trouble, ans simply rub your lamb roast with garlic and rosemary before you roast it.

I was looking for a garlic jelly recipe and found this one. Made a double batch just to see how it comes out. Used a little less garlic than called for and about the same amount of rosemary. However, I blunder and added the pectin BEFORE adding the sugar (as most jelly recipes do) so it will be interesting on how it works out. As from other reviewers I put the rosemary in a cheese clothe bag but still put a bit of the cooked rosemary in the jars. Also, at higher elevations one may want to cook it a bit longer, say 15 minutes rather than 5 for proper jar sealing. Will let y'all know if it worked. Based on the spoon lickin' it could be rather nice!

This recipe is sheer elegance; however other readers noted a problem about the floating rosemary and sinking garlic. To avoid this problem, I finely minced my rosemary, tied it into two coffee filters and soaked it overnight in the wine to extract as much flavor from it as possible. During the cooking process, the package of rosemary was in the jelly, but the pieces were not actually put into the jelly per se. I think the next time I will double the rosemary though, since the garlic is a much more powerful flavor. As for the sinking garlic, I sliced mine paper thin with a truffle slicer, which made each piece lighter in weight, therefore less likely to sink. I did use a pretty sprig of rosemary in each jar, and speeded up the jelling process by cooling the jars in an ice water bath, rotating them frequently to evenly distribute the garlic slices. The end result is absolutely gorgeous to look at and the taste is sensational.

OK, having tasted this I would make these changes: tie the rosemary in a cheesecloth bag and remove after simmering, squeezing as much jelly out of it as possible. The texture of the rosemary in the finished product is not appealing. Place a rosemary sprig in each jar before pouring the hot jelly in. The garlic takes on an almost ginger flavor and is terrific!

I've made this twice but not used it yet. Both times the garlic sank to the bottom of the canning jars, and the rosemary floated to the top. It looks a bit odd but judging from what I licked off the spoon, it will taste great.

This is absolutely delicious! Inexpensive, easy to make and so good. I've made a lot of this to give in Christmas gift baskets. I also enjoy this jelly with cream cheese and crackers, with poached chicken and with lamb.

This was really tasty, and I imagine you could substitute almost any herb to get different flavors for different dishes. I served it with lamb, and my entire family liked it.

I made this jelly years ago, loved it, and then couldn't find the recipe again. I was thrilled to locate it here on the epicurious webpage. The jelly is delicious with lamb or just on wheat crackers (with or without a little cream cheese). Enjoy.
