This is a great simple, quick recipe. I used more herbs than it called for and used basil, parsley and oregano. I also used sweet onions and carmelized them which added a great flavor. I loved the ricotta and will try it next time with feta to add a little saltyness.

I reduced the eggs to 6 and used dried basil and sage because that's all I had on hand, but fresh rosemary. The frittata came out easily in my 12" iron frying pan. Very tasty, though I might use feta another time.

I used Foreverago15's advice and added red bell peppers and asparagus to this recipe. Carmelized onions and peppers and at least doubled the herbs. I used goat cheese the first time I made it and feta the next. We liked it with the feta best. Our 16-month-old daughter also loved it. It is good cold, as well. I was surprised at how good this was for being so simple. Also, liked Foreverago15's advice about wraping the handle of the pan in aluminum foil for baking. Why didn't I know that?! Thanks, girl!

This is a delicious breakfast/brunch recipe. Following the advice of others, I carmelized the onions. I also added a couple ounces of procuitto. The frittata was flavorful and delicious and not as many calories as a quiche. Quick and easy too. I will definitely repeat this one.

This turned out well, but I made some modifications that turned it into an almost-different recipe. I took the advice of several commenters here and doubled the herbs; also carmelized the onions and added a few cloves of minced garlic. Instead of ricotta, I just used a lot of cojita cheese and baked until the top was nice and pretty-golden (ended up being more like 15 minutes -- but I have a pretty temperamental oven). Served with some very ripe avocado and fresh tomato slices -- was excellent.

This was delicious and easy to make! I added some cherry tomatoes to the onions when they were about half way done and it added a really nice burst of juice throughout the dish. The only slightly negative aspect of the actual recipe is that the cooking time was much longer than written. I think in part it was my pan, but I left it on the stove top for about 6 minutes and then it was in the oven for closer to 20 minutes. However, this did result in a nice sort of crust on the bottom and sides which was very tasty! I will make this again.

Solidly just okay. Pretty bland--and I did not double the herbs as EVERYONE suggests. I didn't really read the reviews before I made this--I know...I know. I'll def be on the lookout for a different [onion] frittata recipe.

This recipe is great! I have already made it twice. Although I made a few changes: I left out the ricotta, went easy one the parmesan, used less oil, carmelized the onions before adding them instead of just heating them for a few minutes. (I'm trying to lower the fat due to a Galbladder issue).Even with all of these changes it was still great!

We made this on a Green Egg since we are renovating our kitchen and don't have a stove/oven. Grilled the onion instead of saute. It was EXCELLENT.

Great recipe! I only made 2 changes... Used 1/3 cup sour cream instead of ricotta. Made sure to blend the sour cream into the beaten egg mixture so that it was even. Also added sautéed cremini mushrooms. Was awesome!

Great way to use up the eggs from our chickens. Didn't have fresh basil but I had pesto, so I put in about 2 tsp of it. Used goat cheese. Turned out delicious. Agree more herbs would be better. It's not the most attractive dish but certainly tasty. Good vegetarian dish.

I thought this was absolutely delicious. I did follow the advice of previous reviewers and doubled the herbs. I also added a couple cloves of crushed fresh garlic and 1/3 gorgonzola since I had it lying around. The result was incredible.

This was my first time making a frittata and I was very pleased with how it turned out. My roommates also enjoyed it; one is a vegetarian and the other is my very picky boyfriend. As previously mentioned, this frittata definitely needs to bake in the oven for longer than the recipe calls for. Mine spent about an extra 7 minutes baking. I also cooked the onions for much longer than 6 minutes because I increased the amount of onion (I used 2 medium- sized onions). I also placed a few pieces of steamed asparagus on the top when I added the goat cheese (another great tip, use goat cheese instead of ricotta). I also added garlic powder and a touch of red pepper flakes. Next time, I will try adding red or yellow peppers to the onions and I think it will be delicious. I served it with a side of sour cream - amazing. One last useful tip that I learned from Rachael Ray: I was worried about the handle of my nonstick pan getting too hot because it is a rubbery material, so I wrapped it in aluminium foil to protect it. This worked like a charm.

I added butternut squash (sauteed it with the onion) and substituted thyme for the sage. Delicious!

Delicious! We added mushrooms and a little more parmesian than it called for. We also used cottage cheese for lack of ricotta, and it was really good. It had to cook in our oven a little longer than 9 minutes, but this was delicious. We will definitely make this again.

This was terrific. Easy weeknight dinner with the family. I followed the recipe to a T, except I used chevre instead of ricotta, as previous reviewers had suggested. Nice to have an easy egg meal that is a little dressier.

I found this frittata just ok. It was too bland for me. There was nothing memorable about it.

I had never made a frittata before, but this was easy to make and really delicious, plus a big hit with our guests. I did end up needing to cook it a bit longer in the oven - more like 13 minutes than the 7-9 minutes on the recipe.

Wow. who knew? I enjoyed this better as left overs the next day. The onion & herbs really developed overnight. So glad I didn't toss it! (I would never eat a day old omlette!) Now, I'll up my rating to 3 1/2!

I agree with every review here. Tasty but didn't knock my socks off. I doubled the herbs as suggested but it needed something more & was slightly dry. I think (as suggested separately below) adding shredded zucchini would moisten & goat cheese may add the zing that ricotta lacks. Worth trying again.

I doubled the herbs and added a bit of garlic to the ricotta -- easy and delicious!

Very easy and great for a quick supper. I read the previous reviews and doubled the herbs and it was very tasty (make sure you use fresh herbs).

This was an easy egg dish to prepare, however I think it was bland. I added artichoke hearts to it and that helped but next time I would substitute herbed goat cheese or even blue cheese for the ricotta. I often use chopped spearmint in omelets - I think that would work here very well.

simple and very tasty. I added shredded zucchini to it. I first let the onions cook for several minutes and then added the zucchini. Once could also consider added very thinly sliced potatoes to create more of a Spanish tortilla.

I'm a Chinese man almost without any cooking experience. I have no idea how basil and sage look like. I also had some trouble in finding ricotta because Walmart placed it near yogurt instead of cheese.Anyway, I made it myself and it taste good. I like the basil leaves but I don't find sage leaves and rosemary. thanks very much!

Recipe is easy and very good but I would love the nutritional information.

This was a delicious dish and easy to make. I increased the onion to almost 2 cups, because after they carmelized, I was down to only about a 1/4 of onion.

This recipe is absolutely delicious! I used skim-milk ricotta for a lighter flavor. The fresh herbs add a great savory flavor and balance the sweetness of the white onion. We have eaten this in our house for the last two days for breakfast, lunch, snack both hot, cold, and room temperature. They are all equally delicious ways to eat this frittata.

This was my first frittata and turned out really well! The recipe was quick, easy and turned into a nice, light dinner. I didn't have any parmesan cheese and nothing seemed to be missing. Thanks!

Really easy.. and really tasty! Served with a simple green salad and crusty bread. Perfect vegetarian weeknight dinner.
