Don't worry about them looking round versus boat-like. In Mexico, this is the difference between a huarache and a sope- same recipe, different shape. One is round (sope) and one is distincltly sandal, or boat, shaped. Hence the name huarache, which means sandal in spanish.

I made this recipe for a Mexican theme dinner my husband and I went to. Everybody loved it. It was a bit too spicy for me but I am a wimp when it comes to that. I did have a problem forming the masa boats. They ended up looking like discs instead of boats. I think next time I make this, after I have browned them in a pan and sliced them in half, I will try to form them around something round to see if I can get a better shape.

I made the picadillo, but not the masa boats. The picadillo was really good and not too difficult -- I used just one chile, though, which was plenty spicy for us.
