I have been making this recipe for twelve years now. Don't bother with the marinade for the scallops, it adds nothing to the dish. For the sauce, omit the pine nuts, increase the cheese to 1 cup, substitute 1/2 cup chicken broth and 1/2 cup 1/2&1/2 for the heavy cream. Comes out perfect every time. My husband's favorite dish!

I love this recipe and have made it 8-10 times. So decadent and beautiful on the plate. The sauce does need to be salted and that's best done in the blender/processors. Also, unless you're using 'dry' scallops, I recommend a prolonged period at room temperature and/or wrapping in towels to extract the excess moisture. Otherwise, they won't sear very well. Enjoy.

I'm a rotten cook - allow me to preamble with that - but when it was all said and done I needed to add chilies and lemon juice just to eat it. Please also note that I didn't have white wine; that might be the key. I'm sure it has better potential in others' hands but I won't be making it again.

I have mixed reviews on this one. It is about 2 3/4 forks. It has GREAT flavor. I made the recipe mostly as written with the addition of peas and subbing half and half for the cream (about 3/4 the amount). The pine nuts really add to the sauce. As you're eating this great flavored pasta you begin to recognize how RICH it is. Scallops are rich, the cream/half and half, parmesan, pine nuts - WOW! A little goes a long way.

This recipe is excellent! The marinade is super fast and would have been delicious with oil and pasta on it's own. But, after tasting the Red Bell Pepper Cream Sauce I would not have skipped it -- the sauce is delicious! I will definitely make this again and I would recommend it to anyone.

I loved this recipe and didn't find it bland at all. A great meal to prepare ahead for company -- our guests have loved it and always ask for the sauce recipe.

I would use the base of the sauce again, but not add the pine nuts. It was too grainy for me and very bland. I may use some kind of citrus, hot sauce or chicen stock. Maybe even some curry. You need to play with this recipe.

really was too too busy for the final taste. the scallops were not the primary dish . it felt that the fettucine part was.

Fantastic and so easy! Used 1.5 lbs. of scallops, which was perfect, and half and half instead of the cream. Great for a dinner party because you can make the sauce in advance and just throw the scallops on right before you eat. Served with olive bread, spinach salad and chardonnay.

Always a huge hit at my dinner parties. I use shrimp instead of scallops & tri-colored pasta. Extremely easy to make ahead of time.

I thought this dish was delicious! I roasted the red bell pepppers (I used 2 red and one yellow) in the BBQ and they came out very good. When making the sauce I added one chicken bullion to the cream in the pan and it gave it some extra flavor. I also used whole wheat spaguetti instead of the spinach fetuccine and it was great! I highly reccomend this dish...One last thing - I would use closer to 2 pds of scallops!

this dish is definitely a favorite. really easy to make. i made the entire red bell pepper sauce in a mini-chopper, included the pine nuts and added some cayenne and crushed red pepper to taste. instead of heavy cream i used about half the suggested amount of half and half just enough to slightly thin the mixture. the sauce stuck to the pasta beautifully, DELICIOUS and EASY!

My guests absolutely loved this dish. I added a pound of large shrimp to the scallops and the marinade was great. I thought the sauce was a little bland, but everyone else loved it and most asked for the recipe. Great crowd pleaser.

This is a great recipe, full of complex flavors. We added peas, which was a nice addition. We even made a special separate version for a lactose-intolerant friend with soy milk instead of the cream and sheep romano instead of the cow's milk parmesan.

I still wish they had a 5 fork system to give this 4 forks, just not "Beyond Compare" Thought it was very good, step daughter dove into it and "forgot" that she didn't like red peppers. am going to try with dolphin next. should work well if the fish is grilled

This may have been the best dish that I have ever made! Everyone loved it. I added a little crushed red pepper too. This would be great to serve for a dinner party. Not too expensive but dazzling.

This recipe is a favorite of ours and all of our friends. A perfect dish for a dinner party or a week night dinner. The flavors are complex and compliment eachother perfectly.

Definitely a keeper. Both delicious and simple. We like spicy, so we used Hungarian (hot) paprika and plenty of crushed red pepper. Also used spinach linguini vs. fettucine since it's a bit more delicate with scallops. A great recipe to skip the measuring and tweak to your taste.

This was very good..everyone loved it! I added crushed red pepper and 1 large garlic clove to the marinade and the scallops were some of the best I've had. The marinade is a keeper for sure! I'd agree with some other reviewers that the sauce does not need the pine nuts. They provide a not so smooth texture. I added fresh basil, hot sauce and 3 extra cloves of garlic to the sauce and next time I will add crushed red pepper also. It was overall very good! A keeper for sure!

Enjoyed it. Used plain pasta with great results. Will take advice and use fresh basil next time in sauce and may even use the sauce with cream next time, it seemed to present well and great ingredients for pasta sauce without the addition of cream. Used red bell peppers from garden, fantastic, and a great way to use up excess garden-bounty. Add this to your recipe box and feel free to experiment with reader's ratings. This sauce and pasta recipe are wide open to interpretation.

This was just terrific -- hearty, yet light. I used jarred roasted peppers for the accompanying sauce, which made the recipe more manageable than fooling with fresh, and tasted and looked just fine. I didn't add cream or any dairy enrichment of any kind, and it was just fine without.

Very yummy! The local supermarket did not have spinach fettucine so I used plain, but it was still good. The sauce is great - but could use a little zip. Will add some fresh basil next time.

I found this dish easy to make, but I added one cayenne pepper chopped fine to the mixture. It added a little kick to the dish. Made it very pleasent and was served with a Chateau St Michelle Chardonay,2000.

All 8 who ate it loved this recipe. If trying for the first time, be sure to roast the peppers (try not to let them burst; if liquid seeps out, they cook and lose the sweetness imparted by truly roasting). When roasted, the peppers transform into incredibly sweet delicacies and the sausce is wonderful. I agree; don't need as much cream as called for... but yummy.

Delicious!My husband and 12 year old son loved it. I used finely ground pecans for the nuts.I loved how the peppers cooked so easily...what a method! My only question was cooking the scallops. They did not get seared looking like the picture from Bon Appetit for this recipe. Can others email me and let me know what happened for them? I timed one minute per side and scallops were wonderful! A must for every recipe book. This is a keeper!

The scallops were delicious from this recipe, however, I thought the cream sauce lacked flavor. It could have used something else.

My boyfriend and I made this dish and we fell in love with it, we especially liked the sauce. We did not use the pine nuts though. It turned out very tasty, and we plan on making it soon. We also plan to use the sauce for differnt cooking ideas. Definitely one of our favorites!!!!

This is a keeper in my book!! A very easy sauce to make, I didn't use pine nuts ($$$$), add extra parmesian and it came out great! Because the cream sauce can be made ahead of time, scallops don't take long to cook, this is a great tasting, not time consuming dinner to make for 4-6 people.

Big hit with the Red Pepper Sauce. Had exceptioanlly fesh scallops. Used canned/jarred roasted red pepper and walnuts.

I have made this recipe twice. The first time I added some hot pepper sauce and quite liked it. The second time I followed the recipe exactly and found it too bland. If I do make it again, I will definately add hot sauce or a hot pepper to the red bell pepper cream sauce to spice it up a bit.

I was particularly crazy about the Red Bell Pepper Cream Sauce. I did not use pine nuts in the sauce, as I did not have any on hand. It was still wonderful. I also cut down on the whipping cream. Visually, I thought the dish was very appetizing - the white scallops, green fettucine and the red sauce. Nice combo.

Rating: 2
The pine nuts did not do anything for the sauce. They added a chunky texture that made an unpleasant contrast to the smoothness of the scallops. If I did this again, I would use more cream and reduce it to thicken instead of using the pinenuts, and I's add some Marsala to set off the red pepper. I used shrimp and scallops and the red pepper flavor went better with the shrimp.

This dish was wonderful. I added 12 ounces of pasta instead of 8 and there was still plenty of sauce to go around. Also, there is enough marinade for 1.5 pounds of scallops. The dish was a bit bland, but I like spicy foods. Next time I'm going to add a roasted hot pepper or two to the sauce to give it a little kick. If you want to impress your friends with an easy dish, this is it!

I couldn't get scallops so I used shrimp instead. Excellent recipe that won raves.

Everyone loved it and had 2-3 servings. I'll eat seafood, but it's not my first choice -- even I had 2nd helpings, and took all of the left-overs to work for my lunches! In addition, since our 10 yr old wanted to try the sauce but does not like seafood, I served her some prior to topping it with the marinated scallops. She absolutely loved it, and had seconds. I will definitely be making again, and have given the recipe to my co-workers.

I made this recipe the other day in spite of what the other cook said, and my husband and I both loved it. I added a jalapeno pepper for good measure to be sure it wouldn't be bland and found the combination of flavours very tasty. I also substituted cream for evaporated skim milk to make it low in fat.

The green pasta with bright orange red pepper cream sauce does not present well. And it tastes about as bad as it looks.
