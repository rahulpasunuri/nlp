In 1975 my husband and I used to go to a mob bar on the NYC waterfront and get sparkling fresh deep fried softshell sandwiches on Wonderbread with excellent tartar sauce plus a short beer. The whole thing cost $1. (And we had to scramble to find the money!) This recipe is real good. As the chef from Chicago said, it's always a good sandwich if you don't mess up the softshells. Will try his recipe next,.

We made these about a year ago. We used french bread instead of English muffins. It was soooo good! I'm making again this week for company.
