Great recipe, I was a little surprised at the time it took to strain the soup at the end. I wish there was another way to add the herbs and strain them easier. I may just keep them in large pieces next time. This soup was so tangy from the galangal though, it was begging for some coconut milk which I may add next time. Made this with my homegrown organic hubbard squash. Initially I missed the note about this going with a shrimp toast recipe, it really would be perfect with it. It's definitely not filling enough by itself. Beautiful soup.

Made this yesterday on Halloween with a sweet pumpkin and it was amazing! Great way to get some veggies and use up a pumpkin. Made according to recipe and used homemade chicken stock. Will definitely make again and again.

Absolutely fantastic. When put through my strainer (necessary to strain out the lemongrass fibers, unless you mince very finely as a previous reviewer suggested) the soup became very thin, like a broth. It was delicious, but I ended up adding more pumpkin chunks because I wanted a heartier texture. It was great both ways.

Interesting soup. It's a cross between tom yum soup and pumpkin soup. I find it weird for my taste, but my husband liked it, though he found it a little too spicy.

this soup is marvelous. here are the changes i made: used roasted flesh of 2 lbs butternut squash and 1 lb sweet potato; replaced galangal with more ginger; used dried lime leaves; and 6 cups veg stock. the soup has a lovely tangy golden flavor and beautiful velvety texture once sieved. i garnished it with some chopped coriander leaves and a few toasted and salted butternut squash seeds. DIVINE. i plan to make this again and again, hopefully with the galangal next time.

I made this as quick and dirty as I possibly could, sort of Apocalypse Chow style. I used jarred garlic, canned pumpkin, canned broth, packets of lime juice power, Asian-style chili sauce - the only fresh ingredients I used were the lemongrass and the ginger. It was STILL awesome. I bet it's even better when you make it with all fresh ingredients, but if you feel like making it with mostly pantry items it's still going to be good!

Absolutely bland and horrible. Followed the recipe exactly. My family absolutely loves every single one of the ingredients. But I will not make again - threw it out and did not serve to my guests. Absolutely horrible.

Incredible flavor! I used about 3 cups of fresh Hubbard squash and one large can of pumpkin. Use only the tender inner part of the lemon grass. If the lemon grass and galangal are minced, there is no need to strain the soup. Use brown sugar, not granulated! Use an immersion blender to puree.

Made this twice and 2nd time it was better. I pushed more of the pumpkin through the sieve. Outstanding (but shrimp toast too greasy; will find another way to make that).

Made this for a dinner party. Everyone loved it. Did not have the galangal so I increased the ginger - was wonderful anyway. One of the people at the part dislikes Pumpkin, he thought the soup was great!

Wonderful! I made as directed with the expections of I had to use Butternut Squash, because I couldn't find pumpkin..and I added twice as many Thai peppers, for more heat. Will be making this often.

This soup is stunning. I used dried galangal as well as dried kaffir lime leaves (I used 6 leaves instead of 4). I also was short on time so I used two 20oz cans of "pure pumpkin" puree. I can't imagine going through the trouble of peeling and chopping up a sugar pumpkin, as the canned pumpkin was already wonderful.

I slow roasted the pumpkin and pureed before I began this recipe. I simmered the soup for considerably longer than the recipe calls for and allowed the soup to sit overnight before straining to intensify the flavor. Everyone loved it and is surprised there is no cream. I will certainly make again.

The soup is devine; we loved the tangyness that was mellowed with the sweetness of the pumpkins. I used butternut pumpkins (one and a half - a bit over what the recipe calls) and dried galangal (two pieces). Also had to replace the ginger with powdered version... but the result was nevertheless outstanding. One more thing : right before serving it I stirred some enoki mushrooms with the soup... went really well and added a nice texture to it.

Disappointing. I would cut the stock by about half, and use only half of the lime juice. (Otherwise it was watery and too sour for my taste.) It was made somewhat better by the addition of a dollop of sour cream.

It is delicious - light and tasty. Left out the white wine and oil and used 1 tspn galangal powder, butternut pumpkin and increased ginger and lemon grass. Will definitely make it again.

I used acorn squash and roasted them with some maple syrup and a bit of brown sugar. Very tasty! I only changed a few things in this recipe--a sign of a great recipe.

Upon tasting this soup my boyfriend said "Wow. wow. You have outdone yourself. This is delicious." I cut corners with 2 cans of pumpkin puree but otherwise followed the recipe. I followed this starter with chicken in banana curry sauce from Food&Wine and hot white rice.

I've made this soul-satisfying soup twice now, first cheating with canned pumpkin puree to prepare a half-recipe experimental batch. I had to sweeten it with a bit more sugar, even a touch of maple syrup, probably because of cutting corners with the pre-fab pumpkin. I left the solids in and pureed it all. My husband and I found this very satisfying and complex. My second full-scale batch was made with 2 20-ounce packages of peeled butternut squash. It was just as delicious. A new favorite, indeed.

For those weary of messing with a raw pumpkin, I always bake it first and scoop out the pulp. Large stringy pumpkins don't seem to be a problem as the blender takes care of them. Also Belgian pumpkins are wonderful don't worry about the size.

Very good! To the cook from Belgium, Jack-O-Lantern sized pumpkins will not work for the most part, use Sugar Pumpkins they are much smaller...the large one will be too stringy...

Great flavors, very much like Thai Tom Yum soup, but with a hint of pumpkin. Actually, I thought it would have much more of a powerful pumpkin flavor, but it's actually quite light. Loads of lemongrass infused in the scent and taste of the soup, which is well balanced with with lime and chili. It took me a very long time to peel, de-seed/de-goo and chop up the pumpkin (about 50 minutes). Does anyone have any good tips for how to do it more quickly?

I imagine this soup tastes even better on the second day, but as my guests enjoyed seconds, I'll have to test this theory next time 'round. I used dried galangal and keffir leaves, found at a local Asian market. Awesome balance of spice, sour/sweet and heat.

I made this yesterday for my in-laws who are originally from Laos. They loved it! They eat mainly traditional Lao cuisine so I was really happy. I added more garlic and ginger like other reviewers and added ground red peper at the end instead of the black pepper the recipe called for. Excellent!

Help! I don't know one pumpkin from another. Here in Belgium we just get the typical sort of orange pumpkin that one would carve for Halloween into a jack-o-lantern. Will that work for this soup? It sounds yummy and I'm scared of ruining it with the wrong main ingredient. Thanks!

I am an American living in Bangkok, Thailand and had to do a Halloween lunch for some Thai and American ladies. If I never cooked anything else for lunch this would have been enough. One Thai guest ate four bowls of this soup and asked to take some home. I did a trial run using different pumpkins and ended up using small oblong green Japanese pumpkins. I used only canned chicken broth for the stock (no water) and increased the lemon grass, kaffir, galangael,ginger and chillies. Thais like things spicy. This was not too spicy even for my american guests. I sieved it twice to strain the garlic. This is the best soup I have had in a long time. It made a hit!

I like this recipe alot, but found it a bit on the thin side. I might recommend using somewhat less stock or more pumpkin. We added a few extra lime leaves and it was fantastic. We also left the solids in the soup so they could continue to flavor the broth - I would certainly recommend removing them before serving, but I believe they add to the dish if left in the leftovers.

Great Soup! It's a hit everytime I make it. I fry pumpkin seeds until they puff and are crunchy, toss them with sea salt and garnish the soup. Yummy My e-mail address below is incorrect. I am galagals@aol.com

I made this soup based on the rave reviews it received and I was not dissappointed. It was really tasty. I didn't have white wine on hand so I used some leftover Sake and it was every bit as good (maybe even better).

Fabulous soup. I couldn't find fresh galangal so I used extra ginger and dried galangal. I found the lime leaves frozen in an Asian grocery - definitely a key part of the soup. It's a great recipe for a dinner party - try to get them to guess all the ingrediants!

Fantastic flavour - instead of the saute method with Lemongrass, Galangal & Chillies etc. I used Thai traditional way of pounding ingredients in mortar - then saute which brings out the flavour better, then I left the pieces in the finished soup - no need to pass through a sieve. I also left out the sugar as the pumpkin I used was sweet enough.

Very good soup, we kept tasting it and almost didn't have enough left to serve. Flavor sparkles from the lime juice and lemon grass. Great color contrast with cilantro and small red peppers for garnish. I used cooked pumpkin flesh from a pumpkin that I already had roasted in the oven. The Shrimp Toasts are easy and go very well with the soup. Will absolutely make again.
