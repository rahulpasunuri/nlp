Using this recipe was the first year my family actually had a moist turkey! It is extremely simple, quick and easy. Love it. After doing it this way, we will never go back to any of the crazy lengths we went to in the past. Roasting with the breast down as a previous reviewer suggested sounds like a fab idea. I might have to give that a try!

This turkey turned out beautifully! It was moist and flavourful and a hit with my guests. I used a 14lb turkey, cooked it for the suggested time at 350 and it was cooked to perfection. I will definately use this recipe again!

For 40 years, or so, I have used this same method and loved it. This year however, through circumstances, I had dinner in a friend's home and tasted her recipe. It was a better, moister turkey than my own recipe, because of one difference. She roasts her turkey with the breast down; until the last 20 or 30 minutes. Then she turns it over and uncovers it to brown the breast. All the juices, from the darker meat at the bottom, flow downward to the breast; making it much moister and more tasty. I will never cook my turkey any other way again.

This was very easy to cook and great for first time turkey cookers. It was incredibly moist and received rave reviews from all the tasters!

Although I haven't made this recipe, this is the method that I use to roast my turkeys and turkey breasts. Always comes out perfect, very juicy. Just mix dried thyme, rosemary, sage, salt, and freshly ground pepper and place under the skin and in the cavity.
