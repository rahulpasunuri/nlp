It was called Greek-style fortunately - no Greek salad is complete without feta - I made it as is and it was quite sweet and lemony....very Mediterranean but not Greek. If everyone adds/changes the ingredients first before tasting the recipe, is this a review....

Fixed as recipe directed, except I had to let the dressing stand with tomato and onion overnight. Also added feta sprinkled on top at time of serving. The flavors came together nicely. Went great with grilled salmon and wild rice.

I have made almost this same salad for years including the radicchio. I use a second green usually Boston Bibb and feta. One nice touch is to add toasted pita wedges instead of a crusty bread. An alternative to the dressing would be some olive oil balsamic salt pepper and oregano mixed before serving. I also use pitted kalamata olives for ease.

We had this for dinner last night, I added oregano and feta before tossing then topped with chilled poached shrimp. Perfect on a hot summer night.

Defntly. gotta have some Feta in this, you can omit the sugar although it does make a sweet Meditrn.Isle taste with it. For us it needed some Lamb Kabobs and Oregano/Pepper Sour Cream served as well to complete the meal. Otherwise it just doesnt fill the hunger thing going on. Good dish just wont last long on the hungry chart.

Add some feta and oregano to make it Greek! Definitely omit the sugar. Not necessary at all.

You forgot the Feta cheese. In Israel we do it with Feta cheese or what we call Bulgarian, or Zfatian Cheese you can have it with all range of fats. We don't put the Radichio. and I belive the sugar is quiet redandent.

I served with Cumin-Scented Beef Kabobs and Grilled Herbed Potatoes all from the same August 2009 issue. The flavors of the salad complemented the others. Be prepared for slightly sweet, lemony dressing that is so reminiscient of the Meditteranean. Next time, I might add a touch of ground cumin.
