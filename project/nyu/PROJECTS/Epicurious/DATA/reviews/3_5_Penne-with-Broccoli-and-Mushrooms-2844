Excellent! Error, however. In the directions it mentions shitaki mushroons as well as regular mushrooms. In the ingredient list, there is no mention of shitakis. One can work around it, however, and it turned out fabulous.

I used less olive oil, 2% milk instead of cream, and didn't have any parm on hand, and it turned out great! I did use fresh trumpet mushrooms from my CSA box though, so this may have accounted for the excellent flavor. This dish really lets the mushrooms shine.

I added more broccoli and garlic as well as some red onion; used 1/2&1/2 instead of whole cream, and, taking Ashland's lead, I added bacon as well, and broiled it all after adding the cheese at the end. I was pretty sure husband would be underwhelmed, but he really raved about it. It was really easy, and good, too!

This was a tasty mid-week dish and earned great reviews from my family. I made it a bit healthier than the original recipe. I used a few tablespoons of olive oil, an entire garlic head, no whipping cream and whole wheat penne pasta.

i like this as a healthy meal: organic ingredients and organic chicken broth instead of cream. whole wheat pasta (i like ronzoni's new egg noodle shape)

Despite the reviews of blandness etc. we enjoyed this very very much. I did not include mushrooms (we don't like them), but added extra garlic and slightly extra red pepper. This worked quite well with a generous amount of parmesan. Everyone loved it and we will make again. Very easy.

The secret to this dish is adding plenty of sherry when cooking mushrooms and using fresh thyme instead of dried. It makes for a deliciously flavorful, creamy, and filling pasta. It's a staple in my book for a quick and easy dinner that everyone always loves.

This would be a good base for experiments, but, despite the 6 cloves of garlic, it was as bland as others said. It might be better with the addition of sun-dried tomatoes or a spoonful of tomato sauce, or some lemon zest, or some slices of spiced grilled chicken, or perhaps sausage. It is easy to make, especially if you already have leftover pasta and broccoli handy. If you are starting from scratch, you could omit the step of steaming the broccoli separately -- just add it to the pot when cooking the pasta and drain it all together.

Whereas I like the idea of steamed broccoli with pasta, this dish is bland-o-roonie. I used more garlic than called for...even more red pepper...still bland. Though I must admit, it did it the spot with my family. I can see experimenting with this dish the next time I'm left with a head of broccoli and some mushrooms in the fridge.

I took out the oil (yuck) and cream and sauteed in water. I sprinkled vegan parmesean cheese on top and this was divine. Naturally I used whole grain pasta. You could add black beans to this to give it a chewy twist and it would be great. I liked it a great deal.

Very easy to prepare. Made it because I had leftover (raw) broccoli, however, it might have warranted three forks if the broccoli were fresher(?) Save some of the pasta water in the event more moisture is needed!

This was a great recipe to tweek. Instead of the olive oil, I cooked 5-6 slices bacon in skillet and used about 1/4 c. of bacon fat to saute the mushrooms & garlic; the added bacon fat flavor plus the added crumbled bacon really added the umpf that others found lacking. Also, after mixing all together, I put in nice casserole, sprinkled the cheese on top and put under broiler for a few. Definitely will make again.

I made this recipe according to amounts and ingredients except used roasted asparagus instead of broccoli. Very good. I didn't put the cheese on top on one serving, but it does need it to finish the taste. I will make again.

I am not the cook that most on this site are so I was afraid to change anything from the basic receipe given. I used exact amounts and even my husband liked it and he complains about everything. I found it to be very filling, so I wont make in all the time but I defintiely will make it again.

I made this recipe for family and added some grilled chicken. I saute them with the other ingredients.

Instead of using cream in this recipe, I substituted a little bit of chicken broth, and I added more garlic. The pasta came out light and very tasty! I served it to friends and they loved it.

We really liked this recipe. It came together quickly and easily. I roughly doubled the amount of thyme and red pepper and used crimini mushrooms (mini portobellos) and HUGE cloves of garlic, so didn't run into the blandness problem that others have noted.

I made this recipe for vegetarian friends of mine with a lovely herbed garlic bread. Delicious! Next time I will add more broccoli, mushrooms and garlic! Excellent dish!

I agree that this dish was bland, but not too bad. I added extra red pepper and some black pepper, and used less penne, but even with the adaptations and whole 6 cloves of garlic it was lacking. My husband suggested adding sage next time and that might do it ... it does need something!

I was very disappointed in this recipe. It required a lot of modification to help it along. The sauce needed more of everything--more garlic and definitely more spices. This recipe is honestly not worth the work it takes.

Very easy and pretty good. Perfect recipe for my leftover broccoli and mushrooms in the fridge. My boyfriend loved this dish and wants it again. He loved it, I just liked it. No effort dish. Add more garlic!

The dish had lovely colors and textures. I substituted light cream for the heavy cream, and the dish still had good body. I used six large garlic cloves; but felt that this overpowered the dish. Next time, I'll try the dish with four cloves.

Bland, bland and more bland. Unless you really love thyme, I suppose.
