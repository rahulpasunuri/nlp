I've made this dish before with a different recipe requesting you make your own dashi with bonito....THIS recipe is way easier and the chicken broth is still super tasty! I didn't have mirin so I subbed a splash of white wine mixed with a bit of sugar. What made this recipe work for me was using fresh shitake mushrooms and SUPER fresh eggs. I also happened to have the special ceramic cups with lids to steam these in which helps I think. Straining out the eggs also helped give the custards a smooth velvety texture. I was a bit disappointed that this recipe didn't give more guidelines on how big/small to cut things but I think in the end, it doesn't really matter. I will definitely make this again!

I love this! I prefer to reduce the broth to 1 c + 5 T and increase the mirin to 3 t. If eating it chilled (which is excellent), I leave it at that. If eating it warm, I also increase to 1.5 t soy sauce and add 1/16 t salt. I have never eaten chawan mushi before, so I don't know how this version compares to the standard. I steamed this in my rice cooker, which worked quite well. Also, I hear that you should not beat the eggs too much, or you will incorporate air bubbles into the custard.
