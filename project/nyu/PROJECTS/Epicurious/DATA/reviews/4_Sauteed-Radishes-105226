I was so excited to try something so new and different! I was trying to explain what this tasted like and I couldn't. You just have to try it. I made this for a dinner party and most everyone liked it. At least everyone who TRIED it liked it. There was one radish hater in the group who wouldn't even smell it. Such a loss!! Because this is really, really good! We were worried that radish greens were bitter, but wilting them in the garlic and butter took care of that. MMMMMMMMMMMM. We decided there would be one way to make this even better--BACON. My only other suggestion would be to try to get bunches of radishes with the best looking greens you can find. Mine had kind of measly greens and I wasn't 100% satisfied with them. But now I know and I'll be more particular about them next time.

This is a great way to use radishes. I bought a bunch and didn't know what to do with them, since my husband and I don't like them raw. I added the garlic with the radishes and did not use the greens. I added everything to a green salad and my husband and I loved them. I will definitely make them again.

At the time of this post, there are 53 reviews of this recipe and approximately 35 are identical reviews from the same person. I check buzz box frequently and I am tired of finding that a recipe has appeared on buzz box because of this type of artificial inflation of reviews. Surely epicurious's computer system can identify duplicate reviews and delete all but one. I would have liked to have seen the recipes people are legitimately reviewing that didn't make it onto buzz box because this one bumped them out of contention for most commented upon.

What a fantastic recipe! Who knew that sauteed radishes tasted so good!!! More radishes in my veggie patch than I could use in salad were ready for harvest, so I came to Epicurious to find a recipe for them. I found this one and followed the recipe exactly, (except lacking fresh chives, I instead used a couple of finely chopped young scallions from my garden). It was even a success with my 11 year-old stepdaughter! I agree with a previous reviewer that it's great to be able to use the greens (now I know and will never again toss them into the compost pile). I loved it so much that I made it a second time a few days later (more radishes ready for harvest), but changed it up a little. Instead of chives or scallions, I sauteed a bit of leftover red onion with the garlic before throwing in the radishes. Then instead of removing the radishes from the pan, I simply added in the greens at the end, until they wilted. Just as yummy and even easier!

Delicious! I'm not a radish fan, but this was wonderful! I had no idea what to do with a couple bunches of radishes I received, and this recipe seemed easy and a great way to use up the whole vegie. I substituted green onion for the chives and ate every bit of it up! Double yummers!!!

What a great seasonal recipe. I love that there is no waste, the entire plant is cooked and eaten. I used an extra clove of garlic. It did not over power the flavor of the radish or greens. Will it make again soon.

Love this! The radishes come out very savory and the greens do taste similar to broccoli rabe but without all the bite. Great way to use seasonal garden veges. Very easy, very quick.

I have never liked radishes, and have been looking for a way to make them more palatable. This really did the trick. I love that you're using both the root and the greens in the same dish.

This is delicious. The greens taste a lot like escarole and the we enjoyed the sauteed radishes much more than raw radishes. Give it a try.

Great way to use up a bunch of radishes that would go to waste. Sauteed radishes taste a lot like turnips. Be sure to reduce the cooking time in the recipe if you make a smaller batch. I only used 1 bunch of radishes and they were done in about 4-6 minutes.

This one didn't work for us. We found the radish greens to be unpleasantly bitter, and that threw off the whole dish. If I made this again, I would substitute a Japanese daikon radish. Daikons have a milder flavor in the root, the leaves are not bitter at all and widely used in Japanese cooking.

These were the best radishes ever! I loved it with the greens mixed in. This is definatly going to be a permanent addition to my list of side dishes.

If you've just pulled a hundred radishes up from your garden, and you don't know what to do with all of them, try this recipe. It is not a crowd-pleaser, but only because in crowds people would not choose a radish dish in the first place. If forced to try this, they would change their minds. I myself do not love radishes, but this was very pleasing and my roommate, who is a picky eater, is satisfied. The greens remind me of spinach, which is good, but the radishes even by themselves were tasty. And for a low-calorie veggie, you can't go wrong here.

This was as other reviewers promised. So delicious and easy. A perfect side dish that adds color as well. The final taste has little, if anything, to do with raw radishes, so radish haters should definitely try this. The radish greens are a must -- a lot like sauteed broccoli rabe.

I was also skeptical about this recipe because my husband and I hate raw radishes...but we loved it! I served it as a side with chuck roast.

I did this without the greens as an hor d'ouvre and we loved it. I also used roasted garlic as that is what I had on hand.

Never had cooked radishes before. They taste sort of like squash. Not bad.

Served these with juicy burgers and home made french fries. Great side dish. Definitely a keeper and very easy to make.
