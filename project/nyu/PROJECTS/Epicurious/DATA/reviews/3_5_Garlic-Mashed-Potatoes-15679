I'm not sure if I should rate this 3 or 4 forks but, Lordy, it was good! I was a little timid, so I only used half the amount of onion and only one-third the amount of garlic. In the future I think I might go up to 2 Tbsp. of garlic. I'm not sure about the whole stick of butter. Yes, it was good but, wow, what a lot of butter!

This has become a tried and true favorite of mine. It's a perfect side for almost any meal as it can be dressed up or dressed down. The cream definitely makes for a smoother texture than milk does. No more lumpy, bland mashed potatoes!

Easy and tasty. I liked not peeling the potatoes. I made with Mocha Mix, non-dairy creamer, for a pareve result.

I made this with unpeeled russet potatoes and 1% milk, and it came out fine. Added quite a bit of salt. Will definitely make it again, next time with the whipping cream.

This is a fabulous, easy recipe. My whole family, even kids, raved.

I've been making these since they first appeared in 1998 Thanksgiving issue. They are GREAT!!! And the bonus is that they're so easy to make, since you don't even have to peel the potatoes! Absolutely delicious.And the whipping cream makes them so creamy and luscious! My guests have raved about these. (do add plenty of salt and pepper at the end) and I do add a few extra pats of butter, just before serving. Try them, I promise you won't be sorry!

This recipe is VERY easy to make and pairs nicely with spinach stuffed chicken. Be sure to follow directions on onion and garlic prep so that they don't completely overwhlem you (or your house).

Man oh man, this is garlicky, and I LIKE garlic! My apartment reeked for two days. I won't be making this again, especially since there are many lighter recipes that taste better than this.

I tried the potatos yesterday. Followed the recipe to the T. It is very east to make. But the over all tast I felt was not as good as I would have liked. I will be doing it again but I think that I will add a bit more of something or another.

I made this dish and it was great. However the 2nd time I made it I increased the garlic and the butter and it was to die for. My husband wants them with every meal!!!!!

This is a great twist to ho-hum ordinary mashed potatoes I grew up with.It's full of flavor and a great siding to any steak or fried dish.My family and friends love it!

Fabulous. This recipe makes a lot of mashed potatoes. It tastes very much like the expensive steakhouse mashed potatoes (ex. Morton's). It's easy and very adaptable to halving the recipe.

Now THESE are mashed potatoes. Plenty of flavor, plenty of artery-hardening fat--just what you want in a mashed potato recipe. Hey, if you're going to eat mashed potatoes, you may as well do it up right.

This was the hit of my Easter dinner, regretably, none left! Also used elephant garlic, but roasted it. Skins on the potatoes made it faster and actually more visually appealing as well!

These potatoes were great. I really love red potatoes, and to peel them is such a waste, so that makes this recipe a real keeper! There is only my husband and myself, so I cut the recipe in half. Well, that made about 6-8 servings. I will mix in some raw egg with the leftovers, make patties and fry them in some butter. The next time I make these, I will make them ahead and put them in a buttered dish, put a little butter on top and brown them in the oven. I served them with honey and soy glazed salmon (and dill sauce), both recipes from this site. Salad on the side.

Delicious. About the only person who wouldn't like this recipie would be someoune who does not like garlic. Peeling the potatoes and adding a bit of parsley for color does well too. As for someone keeling over and not waking fo two days, I would suggest less fortified wine served at dinner.

Wonderful flavor. Will definitely use this recipe again!

I've made this several times, and I've had it at Cafe Nanina...it's fantastic either way!!! One of the best things I've eaten in my life!!! In fact, everything I've eaten at this restaurant should be on this site...how about the Chicken Bracciolotini? Or the California Lemon Pudding with Raspberry Sauce???? FABULOUS!!!!!

This is a delicious potato recipe which I've made twice. I preferred it with Yukon Gold potatoes. I plan to make it often, notwithstanding the rude comments from the esteemed "Pops Wally" from the illustrious state of Arkansas which, we all know is renowned for its fine cuisine. Maybe you ate a bad squirrel with your potatoes, Pops?

This stuff sucked! This was the worst crap I ever ate in my life. When I find the chef who wrote this recipe, I just don't know what I might do. If you love life, then please, please do not eat this dish.

Served this recipe to a friend who keeled over and didn't wake up for two days...

Great recipe! I personally found the garlic to be a little overpowering, but my mother said the potatoes would be bland if I used a lesser amount. Served this to a friend who raved and practically ate all 6 servings herself! The upside to this recipe is that it is so easy to make, and I liked the fact that I didn't have to peel any potatoes.

My husband told me to throw away all the other recipes I have for garlic potatoes because this one is so good. My in-laws just had to have the recipe!

I had been looking for a garlic mashed potato reciepe after having it as a side dish at a local restaurant in Rumson, NJ called the Salt Creek Grille. After making this, it was almost identical. I have made it several times and plan to continue. It's a simple and impressive side dish.

Excellent! Very easy..I added a bit more salt and an extra clove of garlic. Wonderful addition to roasted chicken.

These were much better than your everyday mashed potatoes. They looked lovely and I appreciated not having to peel the potatoes. I used shallots instead of onions - the flavor was great.

This was wonderful "comfort" food. I took the reviews to heart and went with 2 tbls of garlic. It was enough. I think I would use a little more butter in the mix next time though.

Wow! These were wonderful and so easy to prepare! Wasn't sure about leaving the skins on the potatoes, but it actually added to the presentation! Served with filet mignon and merlot sauce, fresh green beans, parmesan cheese bread, and caesar salad. It was a hit! Everyone went back for 'seconds" and even "thirds"!!

These were delicious. The garlic and onion taste were mild, yet present. If you are looking for a strong taste, add more garlic and onion, perhaps more salt. It was easy to make, and very tasty.

My mother and I made this recipe for New Year's Eve. Although my mother peeled all the potatoes before I could intervene, it was still good.

No peeling of potatoes makes this easy and delicious. I served with the garlic and horseradish crusted prime rib recipe I also found on Epicurious. Two winners!

These potatoes are so yummy, my husband wants them everyday. I put in how much garlic my family likes I dont measure-I buy the kind in the jar. I have even made them with out the onions and garlic just with salt and pepper. It is still good.

Perfect! I decreased the garlic a little, however. Otherwise, outstanding. I was a little afraid the unpeeled potatoes wouldn't appeal to my kids, but no problem!
