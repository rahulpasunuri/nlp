This recipe was delicious and flexible. We used far more canned chipotles to add heat and slathered grilled chicken breasts with the sauce. Then, we sprinkled a saute of onions, green pepper, and sweet corn kernels on top. So yummy!!

Fantastic! I increased the amount of chipotle and didn't bother straining it. I also used fresh red peppers instead of roasted (forgot to buy them). I plan to make and freeze a ton of this to have with barbecued meats this summer. Update: I used the sauce to make seafood (shrimp & scallops) cannelloni last night and it tasted amazing! I used fresh lasagna sheets, filled them with cooked seafood and some steamed leek, a couple spoons of the sauce and rolled them up. I ladled the remaining sauce over the entire dish (I didn't need all of it), grated some parmesan on top and baked (covered with foil) at 200 C for 20 minutes, uncovered and baked 10 minutes more. Try it!

Very spicy and flavorful! We love spice. A little goes a long way so no need to double the recipe even for 8 people.

This is one of those delicious, versatile sauces that would jazz up everything from a rack of lamb, to grilled asparagus. It's guaranteed to turn any dish into a hit. (Different kinds of dried peppers, like ancho's, provide equally tasty results.)
