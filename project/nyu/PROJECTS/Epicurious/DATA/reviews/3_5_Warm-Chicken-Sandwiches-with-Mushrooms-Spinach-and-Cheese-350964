Wow. Some of the previous reviewers have lots of rules. I did not make this recipe exactly as written, and I will still review it. Take that rule makers! I used whole wheat rolls - because that was what I had. I skipped the olive oil drizzle on the bread. I used Jack Danial's Dijon (a healthy portion). I used pepperjack cheese - also what I had. I also added a little fresh thyme to the chicken/mushrooms. I did not use the spinach because we had a big side salad. Despite all those tweaks, I think I stayed true to the recipe. The shallot, garlic, thyme chicken and mushrooms were delicious all on their own. When they were melted in a crusty roll they were so satisfying. Yum! I will make this again, likely in many different forms depending on the contents of my fridge at the time.

I thought I would love this, but it came out rather soggy and tasteless. There was no way to pick it up, and we ate it with forks and knives.

I followed this recipe exactly. It was tasty and the chicken filling was juicy but overall we felt that it was just missing something. It needs a little bit sauce or something with a zing (we layered the mustard on thick but it still didn't do it) roasted tomatoes might work, or a dipping sauce. Tasty, but also a bit dry

This sandwich is absolutely delicious!!! I used Maille Old Style Mustard and laid it on pretty thick - a very good move because it wouldn't have been very flavorful without it. The fontina cheese is wonderful in these sandwiches - don't substitute it for anything else. It's totally worth making the trip to the grocery store to buy it. I'll be using the leftover chicken mixture in sandwiches for lunch tomorrow! So good!!!

I made this with rotisserie chicken and green onions instead of shallots. Otherwise I made as directed and it was great. The whole grain mustard is the key to giving it some zing!

I made this using Trader Joe's Pretzel Rolls and Comte cheese. The sandwiches were so delicious and craveable.

Very good. My only suggestion is not to be stingy with the mustard, garlic and onions, as the recipe could use a bit of flavour. Experimenting with a stronger cheese might be nice too.

This was a rather simple recipe even for me who likes to bake rather than cook. I had to nix some ingredients because of allergies and I served the chicken hot and not chilled. The sandwiches still came out great tasting! Next time I 'll use all the ingredients it calls for and see if it's any better.

I am just weighing in on the arguments about posting a review if you have not tried it or changed quite a bit. I don't think you should rate it if you haven't tried it. However, that's the beauty of cooking...changing the recipe to ingredients that you like. Sometimes you just need to get inspiration and go from there. I happen to enjoy reading the reviews and finding out how other people tweeked it.

I just want to give mad props to A Cook from the North Pole!! It's the first time I've laughed out loud at a review!!

Two things people need learn: - Don't rate the recipe if you haven't made it yet. - Don't rate the recipe if you 'tweaked' it to the point where it isn't the same. Example: "This Warm Chicken sandwich recipe was great, except I used salmon, substituted Walnuts for the Spinach, and served it cold over a bed of pasta, would definitely make again!"...LOL.

Good for the posters that have expressed their opinions about reviewers that rate their own recipe. I, too, am annoyed by ratings that don't reflect the original recipe's merits. Let's keep it real!

I made this exactly as written and we did not like it at all. Upon reading the ingredients I couldn't imagine this sandwich to be bland-- but it was-- unbelievably bland-- almost devoid of flavor. I love simplicity, but not at the expense of taste.

i would like to say that i totally agree with the cook from sebring. i finally decided to speak up as well because i just detest the the the emiril wannabe's that feel they have a to rework someone elses well planned recipe that seems to work for 25 others but not them. i found this particular chicken sandwich to be quite delicious and it went very well with a white wine that was left over from the night before. oh and if i don't like someone's dinner...i just don't go back.

I plan to make this for dinner this evening but I've held my tongue long enough about the reviewing practices of some others. It's okay if you "tweak" a recipe a little bit but when you rewrite the entire recipe and then give it 4 or 5 forks,I don't believe that's a true rating of the original, even if you believe yours is better. It's very misleading. Why not give it a lower rating and then explain how it might be improved?

Prepared this recipe the day before hosting our book club. I always add more garlic!I also added a little fresh thyme to the chicken spinach misture. The ladies loved them! In store roasted/rotisserie chicken is the way to go too!

The issue is that something can be "simple" without being bland and I, too, found this recipe to be pretty bland. A more flavorful cheese might have helped. Also I thought that the olive oil on the ciabatta rolls made it too rich so I would leave that off next time.

I don't understand why everyone is complaining about "blandness". The simplicity of this sandwich is what makes it so exceptional.

even my son, who hates spinach, liked it. However, he did say it would be better, if I had left it out!

Really good, quick, and easy. The only thing I would do next time is maybe throw some marinara on to brighten things up, or maybe serve a jus on the side for dipping. Cooking time is perfect, melty on the inside crispy on the outside.

Delicious and easy. Perfect for a cold winter night. I wouldn't change anything.

This recipe is delicious with a few tweaks and a great way to use up leftover chicken. I use feta cheese, whole wheat rolls, and frozen spinach is fine if you don't have fresh. I also warm my chicken with mushroom soup sometimes to give it extra flavor. I have made this several times hubby says its a keeper!

I agree with the other poster; it was bland and needed some zip. How can you really go wrong with a sandwich - but this recipe needed something else.

Very easy to make! Could make ahead (saute the mushrooms/shallots/chicken). This should keep pretty well. Then, saute the spinach and assemble/bake when ready.

I agree with Cook from Bethesda, MD. As written, it is a little bland. However, with a couple tweaks, it's quite good. I've made it twice so far, since it's such an easy thing to make. I used whole grain sandwich bread, and provolone/gouda. To make this recipe pretty good, I just added some dried rosemary and cumin, as well as using portabella mushrooms. I think any herb or spice you like would make this a darn good sandwich. And don't forget the pepper! It needs pepper.

I thought this was just okay. I made it exactly as written, using a rotisserie chicken. It lacked some zing. My husband liked it, but to me, it was terribly bland.
