These cake balls taste amazing, but be prepared to put some labor into them. This recipe has sugar-coated everything. Couple tips: Use white or chocolate Almond Bark (not chocolate chips for the coating). If you prefer a coating with color, you can find Wilton's Candy Melts at your local crafts store like Michaels. Using food coloring with White Almond Bark will give you a pastel color. It is also so hard to make the balls look "perfect," so don't expect Starbucks looking cake balls. The taste will make up for it though. Don't place the ball into the entire bowl of dipping sauce. Instead hold it on a spoon, and with another spoon dip into the sauce and drizzle over the ball until covered. Also, I find that after coating the ball, using a toothpick to gently slide the ball off the spoon onto the parchment paper works best. It's fun to get creative with them. For Christmas I use a red velvet cake with white Almond bark icing, and white cake with green and red Wilton's chocolate icing. Enjoy!

The end result -- after MUCH time & labor -- was cute too look at but kinda gross to eat: the balls were heavy belly bombs that only kids can stomach. Note: (1) white chocolate coating is a nightmare (kept burning), (2) if you plan to put them on a stick make them SMALL, I used a 1.25" ice cream scoop and they were much too heavy to stay on, (3) make sure the balls are VERY COLD (freeze for 20 min.) before you work with them, and (4) I ended up using my hands to coat them in chocolate. Not worth the effort.

These are fantastic! Who knew you cake from a box would taste like this? I pretty much followed the recipe to the letter and had excellent results. For the coating, I used an entire package of chocolate Almond Bark and had no trouble melting it in the microwave, but I did take the time to chop it first. There is enough left over from the coating process to perform the drizzle technique. Three-quarters of a can of frosting is plenty. I think the key is to have the whole mixture a little less moist than you think it should be - kind of like when you squeeze pie crust dough to form a ball. I did cut off the crispy edges as another member suggested, and I also covered the cake with the pan lid immediately to keep it super moist. They will ooze a tiny bit if you leave any spots uncoated, but storing them in the refrigerator should help. I will be making this again in endless variation!

This was an easy and fun recipe to make. I took them to a party and everyone was asking me for the recipe. I put them on cookie sticks and then placed them in a pot as a centerpiece/desert. They are rich so one was enough for everyone.

the recipe is right on the nose. The only suggestion I would make is to trim off the crispy edge of the cake once you cool it. The edge doesn't crumble like the rest of the cake.

This is one of the easiest things to make - and guests think you've worked your fingers to the bone for them. The directions are easy to follow. While I was preparing the coating, it occurred to me to try making cake balls with my citrus pound cake recipe, my sour cream devil's food cake recipe and my chocolate fudge brownie recipe. Actually, any good recipe can be substituted. For those having problems, don't melt the coating in a microwave, and be careful not to have the double-boiler's water on a hard boil: if the steam gets into the chocolate, it'll 'seize' and be useless. Also: this is for 'A Cook from Delaware': If you have a Bulk Barn or Michael's that sells bakery tools, pick up a set of candy making tools which includes a hoop-like spoon on which you place your cake ball, truffle or mixture that you'll be coating on it, dip it into the coating, gently tap the ball into the coating, turn over to cover completely, pick it up again in the hoop and use the pick to gently roll the ball onto waxed paper. If there's a tiny area that the coating process mission, it's easily fixed by using the pick to smooth over some of the coating.

I was very excited to make these for Valentine's Day gifts and I have to say, I think they were a flop (and believe me, I wanted to LOVE them). I used the Williams-Sonoma Red Velvet cake mix, which is fabulous and making the balls themselves was fine. But....coating them was a nightware. I bought the candy coating as written, melting as written and coated the cakes fully as suggested by another reviewer. Getting them out of the chocolate was a challenge (I ended up wearing gloves and using my hands) and in spite of checking thoroughly, most balls had tiny areas without candy and did ooze immediately. Sorry....I honestly wanted to love this but this was too much work for oozy candy.

I have to admit i kinda hate box cake and canned frosting, but I used both in this recipe and they turned into a new creation (both the darkest chocolate flavor I could find). Sweet and addicting...I ate far too many before i brought them to a Halloween party. The plan was to coat them in green-dyed white candy coating and make them zombie heads...but the cheap Kroger coating did not coat, so a messy green drizzley mess covered them instead. Ugly - buy hey, who said a zombie should look palatable?

I was worried this recipe would taste like plastic, artificial pre-made frosting yuck...but it turned out great! I had fantastic aspirations of making witches and pumpkins and unfortunately, ran out of time. I used Betty Crocker Supermoist Dark Chocolate and Pillsbury whipped white frosting. I left the balls covered overnight in the fridge then dipped them in Ghiradelli 60% cacao chocolate and Halloween sprinkles. SUCH a hit, no one believed they weren't from a bakery. PS don't try to use white chocolate (unless you're just doing a drizzle), it didn't melt very well at ALL. If you need white, use the candy chips as recommended.

these are cute as a button and fairly easy to make. They are just waaaaay too sweet for my taste.

I am so glad I stumbled upon this recipe. Made these for a group meeting, and they were a huge hit! I used a Halloween theme: orange supreme cake mix, orange frosting, semisweet chocolate coating, and Halloween "funfetti" sprinkles on top. Adorable and scrumptious, plus they were super easy (just took some effort to roll and coat). I can see why people are saying cake balls are the new cupcakes. Will definitely make again!

I think next time I will use a double boiler for the almond bark. It got lumpy from re-heating it in the microwave. Also, be very careful to completely cover the ball in coating, if there is ANY without, it will expand and squeeze out like a cake-ball-cyst. Otherwise, it worked great. We're planning on having these for our wedding, so I am trying to perfect the process.

I made these for a bridal shower a few months ago.. they came out really well! One major suggestion..if you're working in the summer months, make sure to turn your A/C on! I did a test run that went really well. The next day, the heat had really picked up, and things were just going awful - chocolate coating wouldn't set right, they were cracking, etc. I gave up, turned on the A/C to relax a bit and decided to give it another go - no problem with the cooler air!

My sister in law made these for my birthday with red velvet cake, vanilla frosting and chocolate coating - it was a major hit! The frosting wasn't too sweet but made the cake extra moist. I highly recommend this!
