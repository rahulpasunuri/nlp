This is my first attempt at homemade ANYTHING and it was a huge success. I made this for 12 people for a friend's b- day, and 3 people asked for the recipe. Extremely easy and keeps well for the next day.

Easily my FAVORITE pasta recipe. This says it serves for but can easily feed a ton more...especially if you are using it as a side dish. And it's quite quick to make.

This recipe is our absolute favorite pasta dish. It is incredibly flavorful and is very easy to prepare. It also freezes well and makes an excellent left over for lunch.

I took Christina's advice and used the dried tomatoes cooked with a little onion and added a lot of red pepper flakes and extra feta cheese. My husband and I both loved this dish, especially with the fresh basil and fresh mozzerella.

This is nothing special and it certainly wasn't spicy.

I spiced it up with red pepper and the sun-dried tomatoes I used were spicy to begin with. Excellent, but a little too oily.

I made this recipe tonight with a few minor changes, and it was delicious! I added about a pound of chicken breast (cubed and cooked in olive oil) and a half teaspoon of red pepper flakes. Also, I could not find fresh basil, so I used a 7 oz. package of prepared pesto. I used tri-colored pasta to add some color and character. My husband and I both loved this dish, so I will definitely be making it again. I think it would be wonderful with shrimp instead of chicken, too!

I was really in a hurry last night when I cooked this, and I had it served in 30 minutes. Its a delicious combonation of flavors, thanks to the feta, fresh basil, and kalamata olives (could add more of those!). I added some italian sausage and red pepper at the end. The servings were huge, but it just left extra for lunches the next day. Wonderful.

I used 1c. dried tomatoes and sauteed them in olive oil with a small onion. Then a added a few tablespoond of ground red pepper. I also added some grilled chicken pieces in at the end. It was awesome!

That was a really a good finding! Excellent dish like in best italian retaurants! To make it a bit more spicy I added a bit hot pepper and it was perfect.

Fabulous! Agree with the not spicy, but that's ok. My addition (along with some hot pepper) is a healthy dollop (or two or three) of pinot grigio.

A very nice Mediterranean spin on this dish. In order to add a little more kick, I added some hot sausage. The final product had a wonderful, distinct flavour. This one's a keeper.

Quite nice, but a bit plain. Spicy is a big misnomer. It needs a little kick -- some crushed red pepper, or oregano, maybe? But a nice dish overall and very easy to prepare.

I've passed this recipe to several people. The sun-dried tomatoes give this dish a hearty feel and is good for both veggie friends and non.
