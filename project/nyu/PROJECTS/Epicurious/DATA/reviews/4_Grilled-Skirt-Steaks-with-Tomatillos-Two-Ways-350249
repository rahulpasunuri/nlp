Used NY strip from Rainshadow Meats, sous vide and finished on charcoal grill with applewood chips. This was a beautiful dish. I had an avocado from my CSA and added it to the salad mix. Bueno.

Yum! Complex flavors-- smoky, sweet, spicy. Great meal, worth the medium time to make.

I've made this 3 or 4 times now, really love it. I played a little fast and loose with the salsa proportions--don't let it get too sweet. For the salad, since I'm not wild about large chunks of tomatilla, I added a few tomatoes from my garden (ripe or not, doesn't matter). Having lots of juicy salad, the two sauces blend nicely together.

This was fantastic! I made the salsa and the salad a bit ahead of time. It still turned out great. Everyone loved it. Yummy!

My full review. In my previous review the salsa was on the sipcy side only after being just made,however,once in the fridge for an afternoon it settled and was just sweet...so for next time I am leaving some of the seeds in the chile because I like the combination of sweet and spicy. The steak was delicious, right after cooking it was on the salty side but after placing in the fridge and reheating it was fine. The tomatillo salad was delicious, very refreshing and light, the combination of the shallots, cilantro and the dressing was just perfect and went well with this dish. If the salsa was spicy this salad would have cool down the heat. This was another perfect recipe for entertainment.

This is a partial review. Salsa is sort of sweet but with a mild spicy taste to it. I cooked the beef more on the raw side since I will be eating it tonight for dinner, but tasted just the tip of it...It was awesome! The sauce goes well with the meat. I am planning on precutting everything for the salad and then fixing it right before dinner...will write full review later. so far I am planning on making this again.

i've only made the tomatillo salsa from this recipe. and i've made it many times for different uses. i think the molassas gives it a great depth. i do strain it after blending. the tomatillos sometimes are too seedy for my taste. i have used other dried pepper combinations that work well too.

This was totally delicious and pretty easy to make. I had no idea tomatillos were so amazing! The salsa, steak and salad look very beautiful together and taste great, too. I cooked the steaks on my grill pan. Pretty much stuck to the recipe since I was unfamiliar with tomatillos. I will definitely make this again. I think the salsa would be awesome with roasted chicken, too.

This is a fabulous recipe! My issues were with ingredient quality. Went to one store and the skirt steak was just this side of green. Yuk. Second place had the steaks in vac- sealed plastic. My piece was gristly. Tough to cut or chew. Had freshness issues with the tomatillos as well. Also no dried, smoked chiles. Used anchos in adoboo.... HOT. All that being said. This was a hit. The cooked salsa was very hot but the flavors popped. The salad was fresh and fantastic. Can't wait to get the right ingredients and do it again. Make it, you'll love it.

Everyone loved it. I made just the salsa and steak recipe. Instead of the salad listed, I just used plain greens with their dressing of cilantro, lime, shallots and oil. Substituted olive oil for vegetable oil on the steak, salsa, and salad "dressing" (didn't have any), and it still tasted great !

Excellent! I was going to skip the salsa, but when I read the rave reviews, that no longer seemed an option! Glad I made it, it was great! I couldn't find smoked dried peppers, so instead roasted 2 poblanos and 2 jalapenos on a cedar plank! And rather than use a blender, I coarsely chopped everything in a food processor to keep a little texture. Next time I'd cut back the salt to maybe half. (Always easier to add more later!)

I agree with all the reviews. I am making it tonight using carni assado flank steaks

Delicious recipe! We loved the flavors the tomatillos, cilantro and dried smoked chiles bring to the salsa and salad. I will certainly make again.

This was a great recipe. The salsa is a wonderful garnish for the grilled steak. I am not a big meat eater, so I made half of the recipe with steak and the other half with mahi mahi. Both the meat and the fish were cooked on the grill following the recipe instructions. When I tried the meat with the salsa and salad, I was blown away! The mahi mahi did not accompany the dish well, as did the meat. Will make again with skirt steak only!! My boyfriend who loves Mexican food and is a picky eater loved it!

One more thing... thanks to the cook who explained why my single tomatillo plant made lots of lovely flowers and puffy husks... with nothing inside! Now I know I needed to plant two for pollination. The things they don't tell you in the nursery, sheesh!

Oh my... everybody has said it already... amazing. I had high hopes after reading the reviews and sure enough, this is so dang good. Skirt steak is my favorite cut of beef besides the tenderloin, for a good reason! I did not have the dried chiles on hand, so I just skipped them and the salsa was delicious. The salad was amazing, too. And all of this begs for rich beef... The recipes are not fragile or fussy, so do feel free to fiddle with them according to your taste or with what you have on hand. The only thing I added was a generous dose of sea salt to everything.

Fantastic. The steak was tender and declicious, the salsa was great (I didn't have dried chiles, but instead roasted 4 from the garden- good substitution). But the real surprise was the tomatillo salad. I look every summer for uses for the tomatillos I grow besides salsa, and this really just blew us away. Will probably make it again this weekend! And if you like tomatillos at all - they are completely easy to grow - just be sure to plant more than one for pollination puposes. They produce abundantly with no work.

First and foremost- this was AWESOME. I really turned some heads making this for my family. The acidity of the salsa made the steak more tender and delicious. I never made the tomatillo salad, but I will try to next time around. I will admit that the salsa looked a little scary when it was done.I really had to beg and plead with my mom and my brother to try it on top of the steak, and when they finally did the "closed eye, sour faced swallow" they ended up fighting over the rest of the salsa to heap over their steak. The salsa is great with Corn Chips and shredded cheeses, too. I would like to say the salsa makes an excellent after dinner snack, but we didn't have any left over! This is a fantastic recipe that had my family very fooled!

The snow had finally melted enough for me to reach my grill. This is the first recipe that showed up on my search of keyword GRILL. Perfectly delicious. The salsa was interesting because it was not cold. More like a warm, spicy sauce. It had flavor, texture and complexity. This was my first time using tomatillos. The salad was more like a traditional salsa of raw ingredients. It was great but "potent" so I used the salad as a dressing for some Boston lettuce to cut the sharpness and I added the small sweet tomatoes as suggested. Skirt steak is one of my favorite cuts of meat. I wish it were sold in my local market, but I have to go to Dewars to get the meat. Worth the trip! Everyone enjoyed it! I would make this again.

this recipe while being unusual is really wonderful. the flavours are amazing and it is super easy (just dont overcook the steak)! the only change i made was i added some sweet cherry tomatoes to the salad part to help balance some the tartness of the raw tomatillo.

easy, delicious & unique. the meat was sooo tender-i skipped cumin on the steak b/c my bf doesn't care for the flavour (i did leave it in the salsa). the salsa would also be great with lamb. i threw some sweet cherry tomatoes into the salad to break up the tartness of the raw tomatillo.

I made the recipe minus the salsa since I was low on time. My whole family loved it; even the picky kids.

This recipe is incredible. The best part is the salsa. If you have never used dried peppers, here is your chance. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
