Made this last night - soo tasty! I added chicken and omitted the zucchini as I didn't have any and it came out wonderfully! Very easy and will definitely go into my meal rotation.

I think this a great healthy way to cook pasta. I had some older sundried tomatoes a friend made and they soaked up a lot of the chicken broth. I needed to add a bit more chicken broth. I also added a little Pernod since I had some. Used haricot vert and snow peas out of the garden and a red pepper that need using. The worked real well.

This is a simple but excellent base recipe for pasta primavera. The most important part is to use the hot chicken broth and sundried tomato combo - this is the base of a flavorful but almost invisble sauce that makes this dish more than veg. + pasta! From there one can vary the vegetables almost infinitely. We did shallot, garlic, thin-sliced leek, broccoli, red pepper and snap pea. I also sauteed some red pepper flake with the garlic and shallot, added a dash of white wine while cooking the broccoli to help it steam, and substitued flat-leaf parsley for basil. It was one of the best primaveras I've ever made!

This was a winner in my book. Took no time, used up veggies thst I couldn't bear to waste and was quite the yum dinner. I made the recipe as is and I don't know that i would change much, save for the addition of some other veggies that might need a home. I'm looking forward to having more for lunch tomorrow!

I made this recipe as written, and it is great! Must add, though, that I consider it a side dish. Its flavors are tasty, but subtle enough to pair with a variety of main courses. Made last weekend and plan to make it again for Easter!

Very easy and very good. A great way to use up veggies in the fridge. I added a hearty splash of white wine to the sauce. The leftovers were good reheated.

Easy and tasty. I would definitely add some of the pasta water as suggested to moisten the dish next time. YUM!

This recipe worked well on its own, but I found it missing somthing. I added thinly sliced carrots, yellow squash, red,yellow diced peppers and a String beans.

Tasty and light weeknight supper. Liked it but didn't love it... would definitely make it again, however. I substituted fresh roma tomatoes for sundried. My family ate it up.

I found sun-dried tomatoes in balsamic vineger and also added a little balsamic to the sauce. Then, just to be bad, I added some shredded prosciutto at the end. Also YUM!

Sauteed sliced shallots in butter, added diced and drained sundried tomatoes (marinated in oilive oil and herbs), shitake mushrooms, slivered carrots, broccoli florets, zuchini, browned the above, simmered in chicken broth/ a little red wine - Divided over angel hair pasta and whole wheat angel hair pasta. Tossed with toasted pine nuts and fresh parmesano-reggiano. YUM!

I thought this dish was pretty good. A little bland (maybe because I didn't have enough fresh basil on hand), but quite simple and even the kids liked it, especially my 21-month old! Easy way to use up vegetables, fairly healthy, and quite versatile!

This version is wonderful! Besides being very tasty, it offers a change from a recipe with lots of cream and butter. Definitely worth trying - and trying again.

This recipe is tasty. It is also easy, quick, and versatile. I used spinach instead of broccoli and roma tomatoes instead of sun-dried. It still tasted great. There are so many ingredients that will taste great in this recipe. Make this and discover a winner. Enjoy!

This was easy to make and very tasty. I only made one modification to the recipe as written: I used about 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water to moisten the dish! My husband loved it!

I made this last evening to rave reviews. I added julienned pheasant breasts and some carrots as well. I will make this again, definitely!

Easy and delicious! This has become a staple in our household. I made just a couple of changes to the recipe as written - I use tomatos packed in oil (and skip the simmering-in-broth step), substitute vegetable broth for the chicken broth, and sautee the veggies a bit before adding the broth.

Delicious, even my kids who don't eat many veggies liked it. I didn't have basil but added red pepper strips, kalamata olives and sprinkled it with pine nuts.

This recipe is simple and quite delicious, I found some baby zucchinni, that was out of this world in this recipe. The presentation is stupendous as well, very eye appealing.

This was delicious! Even my kids liked it. I used regular mushrooms and doubled the chicken broth (I used boullion cubes). It was Fabulous and I will definitely make again.

Excellent recipe! Substituted canned artichoke hearts instead of zucchini, though, and it was wonderful! Can't wait for leftovers for lunch today!

I used the exact ingredients & I loved it! My boyfriend raved & he's a meat lover. He didn't miss the meat one bit! I'd also like to add that I've halved the recipe & it was a nice 4 course serving with bread & salad. Also, used pappardelle pasta instead.

this is a good weeknight family dinner dish -- healthy and quick to prepare. I just used whatever vegetables were in the fridge, and it was good.
