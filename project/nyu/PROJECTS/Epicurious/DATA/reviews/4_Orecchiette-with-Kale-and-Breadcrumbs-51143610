Has potential. But the breadcrumbs are too much. Don't mix in the 1/2 c. breadcrumbs, just finish with some on top and you'll be much happier. I'd make this again if I left out the breadcrumbs. It has a good flavor and is an excellent way to eat greens.

Delicious, easy,fast, home run. The anchovies we had on hand had red pepper flakes in the olive oil so we had an extra little kick. Very good, look forward to making again.

So good! I used anchovy paste instead of anchovies because that's what I had. I agree with other reviewers--don't skimp on the anchovies. It makes this so delicious. My 10 year old even liked it.

This was a huge winner at our house. We love Kale, Anchovies, and Parmesan so that was a good start. I doubled the anchovies and would consider adding even more. Definitely no less. I added a 1/2 cup of toasted pine nuts to the breadcrumb mixture. I'd do that again as well. Make sure to reserve the pasta water. The recipe needs at least some of that moisture. I also bumped the garlic to 4 cloves. We'll be making this a lot.

Liked this dish a lot - it is a good, healthy, meatless dish. I followed the advice of others and increased both the anchovies and garlic. Will make this again...

I found the dish okay, but the breadcrumbs are spectacular. Will probably not be making this dish again.

Really, really good! I took others suggestions and added an extra anchovy fillet. The flavor was fab! Great, healthy and hearty dish!

Yummy use of kale, which is tasty and healthy. I added a handful of pine nuts to the bread crumbs for extra protein.

This recipe is tasty! Even my 4 yo liked the tasty crunchy texture and taste! I used a large package of baby kale, only 4 T of olive oil and added a couple extra anchovies. I did not blanch the kale and feel that may be an extra step that was not needed. Very easy and from things we had in the pantry!

brilliant recipe. super easy and elegant. family said it was like something you would find in a high end italian restaurant. the only change i would make next time is add a few more anchovies. we like them and really wanted it to stand out more. four we could not taste at all, which might please other people i understand!in the end we each grabbed a few whole ones left from the tin and added them to our plates. it was yum! i also most likely added more garlic but that always happens.....
