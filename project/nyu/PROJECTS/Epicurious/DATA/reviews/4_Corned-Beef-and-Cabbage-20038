An outstanding classic. Used 3 bottles of ale plus water to coat. Will use Guinness next time. The meat was deliciously moist and tender - a much better result from stovetop than slowcooker method, which I've tried in the past. Veggies took a bit longer (5- 10 minutes?) to cook, but again - not mushy, done just right. I also steamed some small creamy potatoes in a ladlefull of the stock and then sauteed in butter, salt and parsely, then added these to the platter of meat and carrots, cabbage, etc. Not just for St Patrick's Day!!

The meat was moist and delicious. I used a bottle of ale, as suggested by some of the other reviewers. Next time, I might consider using something lighter or omitting the beer entirely; I didn't enjoy the flavor on my vegetables.

Made this in slow cooker 6 hrs on low and finished it in the oven using the bourbon glaze mentioned here (made 1/2 the recipe for a 3# flat corned beef from Whole Foods, which included pickling spices). I just started with the bourbon, apple juice & guldens mustard, then added abt. 1/4C lt. brown sugar and then adjusted the sweeetness to our taste by adding honey. Baked it for abt. 30 min. at 350 degrees, after it came out of the slow cooker. Couldn't believe how great it tasted! Put glaze on the carrots too...be sure to line your pan with non-stick aluminum foil. Oh, yes, I added a whole bottle of Harp beer at the very beginning.

Great and simple recipe. I found a pre-seasoned raw corned beef at Whole Foods, so I didn't need to add any of my own seasonings, just a method. This was very simple. I used my Le Creuset dutch oven and the 4lb beef was tender in about 2 hours. I'll definitely do it again.

This recipe was perfect! The corned beef was so tender and moist. This is definitely a keeper. The only thing I changed was to add a bottle of ale to the water and I added the cabbage in for the last hour.

My husband and kids made me get rid of my crock pot last year and I love the simplicity for cooking while at work. I put this on before I went to work, had my nanny add onions and carrots and then I added cabbage when I got home and it was simple and delicious!

You really can't go wrong with vintage James Beard. But I make a few enhancements to his recipe to make it even better: This is great in a slow-cooker. I set mine on low and cook for 8 hours. From the start, I add a bottle of dark beer, either a stout like Guinness or a brown ale. Considering the lower cooking temp, put the veggies in sooner- like 2-3 hours before finish, and add the cabbage at least an hour before. One very key trick that adds a new dimension - stick 6-8 whole cloves into a halved onion and put that in the pot such that the cloves are submerged by the liquid/beer. Some cooks suggest cooking potatoes in the same pot but beware of the starches extracted. Best to boil the spuds separately. Yukon gold or small creamers are best pairing for this dish. Can't wait for St. Patty's Day!

Follow this exactly and you will very happy. If you want something different, go find it, but this is simple and authentic. Really, do YOU think James Beard would steer you wrong??

This recipe is nearly authentic. When I married my husband 60 years ago, his Grandmother who was from County Cork, Ireland, gave me her recipe. She said buy 1 pound of Beef for each person plus another piece all square cut. Believe me I never have leftovers. Darn..Simmer all day 6 to 8 hours. Add dark beer after about 2 hours. All veggies, including potatoes go in the last hour. The cabbage, which is quartered goes in the same pot for the last half hour. The Corned Beef need some resting time, so can be taken out when tje cbbage goes in. Our Irish family, and the new inlaws, all love it. I am now teaching my Grand daughters how to do this.

I would like to make this recipe this evening. I was thinking of cooking it for four hours, then refrigerating it UNtil Saturday when I would cook it for the last hour with the veggies. Any thoughts?

I read many of the reviews, which include some wonderful suggestions, but I opted to make this recipe exactly as written. The only this I omitted (actually forgot!)was the butter at the end. This turned out SO GOOD! I highly recommend this recipe...easy and delicious! Oh, I did change one thing...I added small potatoes to the pot with the carrots and onions, and I also went ahead and put the cabbage in then, rather than waiting. Glad I did, because it was perfectly done. This is a MUST TRY!

Classic recipe, just like Mom used to make. Like a lot of people I also add small boiling potatoes along with the carrots and onions about an hour before it is done. My mom throws in parsnips and turnips to stretch the recipe for a big crowd. I also agree the cabbage needs a good 30 minutes to cook. Great dish when the weather gets cooler.

love this recipe, the only thing I do differently is cooking the potato's with everything before I pull it all out.

We had a crowd for a birthday party. I had an 8lb brisket & 2 - 3lb. I boiled water on the stove top with a bottle of Guinness and poured it over the 8lb'er in a roasting pan with lots of peeled carrots, sealed with foil and baked at 325 for 5 hours. The other 2 smaller ones I simmered on the stove top in seperate pots with water and a bottle of guinness for 3 hours. I then removed them from the pots and boiled potatoes in one and simmer cabbage in the other. All of the beef was excellent! Our guests where thrilled with the results. My aunt made some soda bread..I have never had it before and it was very yummy. I'm such epicurious has a recipe for it, so I'll make some next time. I usually make corned beef for my husband and me in my slow cooker (low 8 hours)..again, always turns out great!

Thanks to the reviewer who suggested baking in the oven. This cut the cooking odor substantially. I bought an 8 lb. corned beef from my butcher. The day before serving, I brought it to a boil stove-top with 3 tbsp. pickling spice, a bottle of Guinness, and water to cover. Once it boiled, I tranferred it to a 300F. oven to cook for about 5 hours. I cooled it overnight, then reheated it at 325F. the next day for 2 hours, then added cabbage, onion, carrots, and potatoes and baked for an additional hour. This could, of course, all be done the same day. But the extra sitting time added to the depth of flavour. This is a keeper!

I'd never eatten Corned beef and cabbage beef. I went with the Honey bourbon Glaze that's mentioned a lot. I wasn't sure what type of mustard to use, so i did use Dijon. I reduced it further on the stove after the 30 minutes. I cooked fat baby carrots and onions along with my beef all day. They were soft but didn't fall apart. Everyone liked them cooked with the beef. I also cooked the cabbage in the beef liquid. It was a definate, yes please, for the family.

We make this whenever corned beef goes on sale at the grocery store and at/around St. Patrick's Day and when we're just craving corned beef. Incredible!! If you're a foodie, take the time to read all the reviews here (a long list, I know) and implement what appeals to you. Well worth your time. Enjoy!

This was delicious!! I've never made a good corned beef. This is what I did: used flat briskets, not points. Had to purchase two to equal approx. 5 lbs. Used the packets that came with the meat to season the cooking liquid. Added 1 bottle of Guiness Beer, put a dinner plate on top of the meat to keep it submurged. Brought UP to a boil on the stove top and baked in 325 degree oven for 6 hours. Added the veggies at the appropriate times so they weren't mushy. The cabbage did take longer than 15 minutes. Received RAVE reviews. We loved it!!!

Excellent recipe with suggestions from other reviewers. Added the recommended Guiness Extra Stout after the first hour. Bourbon glaze from Saratoga, CA (3/16/01) was outstanding. One third of the glaze recipe was sufficient for a 4# brisket. Horseradish cream from Lakeville, MI (3/06/02) was also very good. But the bourbon glazed corned beef with superb with the following Sweet-Hot Mustard: Combine 1 cup Coleman's dry mustard with 1 cup red wine vinegar and let stand for 12 hours. Then add 1 cup sugar and 3 beaten eggs. Cook in top of double boiler until thick. Refrigerate.

I made this during St. Patty's week using a bottle of dark beer and peppercorns, simmering it on top of the stove for four hours. I added the carrots and onions during the last hour and the cabbage in the last 15 minutes. I would give the cabbage a full half hour next time, as it was still really crunchy after 15 minutes. I served it with parsley red potatoes which I cooked separately and bread and butter - yum!! My husband and 3 kids (ages 4, 3 and 20 mos) all loved it. The best version I have made yet and easy, too!

I have made Corned Beef and Cabbage many times. But, this recipe was THE BEST! I did not use the glaze but will try that the next time. I made 25lbs of corned beef for about 25 people and had just enough left for a few sandwiches the next day. I simmered the corned beef in 1/2 water 1/2 ale and finished in the oven for 30 minutes. I also made the Champ and Soda Bread from this menu. I used 10 lbs of potatoes and had very little left over. The soda bread was also a big hit. I will use these recipes every year!

Works well with corned round roast, too, decreasing the simmer time to 3 hours or so.

This was fantastic, and oh so tender! I did let it simmer longer than 5 hours (started in the morning, and let it go all day), and added a Guinness about two hours in. I used the glaze, the horseradish sauce and the brick, but probably wouldn't repeat any of those three - call me a purist, but I liked the meat straight out of the pot. :-) Definitely a keeper!

This was by far the best corned beef I have ever had or made. I cooked 3 of them { 9 lbs} in my big Nesco roaster, added extra spices, water, and a German beer for about 31/2 hours. Then it went into the oven covered for about 30 minutes. I brushed with the glaze that was posted here for the last half hour. This was excellent. Everyone raved about this. the glaze would work on ham and pork quite nicely. Try the glaze. Wow!

My first time cooking a brisket and it was wonderful and so easy. I used only the spices that the brisket was marinating in, cooked it all day in the crock pot w/ a beer and water to cover. For the last 45 min. or so, I added onion, celery,cabbage and carrots. I roasted the potatoes separately in the oven. I also made the Brown Butter Soda Bread from the site. A wonderful meal for St. Patricks Day!

I logged back on to give my review from yesterday's masterpiece, but I see that many people have already said what I would have written: cooked 7.5 pounds for 10 people, added the Guinness, did the bourbon-mustard-brown sugar glaze, served it with horseradish sauce on the side, and it was fabulous! Awesome flavor, incredibly tender and will only make this recipe from now on.

I've never made corned beef before so I was a little worried, but it turned out amazing. I thought I cooked enough to have plenty of leftovers, but every morsel was eaten - I'll make twice as much next time. I followed the advice of others and added a tall can of guinness, waited until after skimming to add the pickling spices, and I added the potatoes to the pot with the rest of the veggies. Thank you to whoever posted the creamy horseradish recipe, it was excellent! I'll definitely make this again next year, and probably even sooner since everyone said they didn't want to wait a whole year to enjoy this meal again.

This is the first time I've made corned beef and it was excellent. I followed the advice of several reviewers by adding chicken broth and stout along with the water. I cooked peeled, red-skinned potatoes along with the carrots, onions, and cabbage. At the suggestion of the "Cook from Boston on 02/04/05," we made the 1:1 grainy dijon & brown sugar glaze and cooked the corned beef at 400 degrees for 20 minutes. The glaze was great, but my corned beef, which had been perfectly tender, became a little crusty on the edges. I would either skip this step, or shorten the time in the future. Overall, excellent flavors. We will definitely make this again

Fabulous! So I was crazy and read ALL of the reviews, if you want to save time, here is my recap of what I did! Bought an extra corned beef, now had 6 lbs. Almost covered w/water, brought to a boil, skimmed off scum, then added 2 bottles of Guiness stout and the two packages of pickling spice, brought back to a simmer and then put in 300 degree oven for 5 hours, covered. Removed corned beef, but on a baking sheet, had my husband find two bricks, wrapped them in foil, put them on top of beef and put it back into the oven (it really did compress it and make it easier to slice). Meanwhile added the onions and carrots to the pot of broth, 15 min. later added fingerling & purple peruvian potatoes (had them on hand) and 15 minutes later added the cabbage. Once I had added the cabbage, removed the corned beef from oven, took off bricks, mixed 1 part grainy mustard to 1 part brown sugar, spread that on top of corned beef, back into oven until cabbage was done...slice, serve, enjoy. Tried the Irish soda bread...not my thing I guess. For a grand finale I made the corned beef hash w/fried eggs from this site this morning, wow! That was great too!

I made this for St. Patty's Day, and it was great! I took several suggestions from the reviews. I added springs of fresh thyme & parsley, 3 cloves of garlic, mustard seeds, cloves, and peppercorns to liquid. I used 1/3 chix broth, 1/3 beef broth, and 1/3 water instead of all water to boil the beef. I also made the glaze with 3/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup apple juice, 1/4 cup bourbon, and 3 T. grainy mustard. This was by far the best corned beef I have ever had! Yum!

Rating: 3
This was good. I tossed it in the crockpot with its spice mix and 12 oz. Guinness stout for 6 hours and later added the vegetables and little red potatoes as others suggested. The bourbon glaze made it much too sweet. If you like pure unadulterated corned beef, skip the glaze.

Rating: 3
I've used this recipe for years. This I tried some of the recommendations in the reviews and was please with some, not so pleased with others. Using chicken stock is excellent. I have always used a beer in the recipe so nothing new there. As for the bourban/brown sugar glaze, NEVER again. I thought that I was eating a ham. As much as a brisket costs, if you want something that tastes like ham then buy a ham, it's cheaper! I eat corned beef because I like the taste of corned beef.

I've been cooking for over 30 years and have tried corned beef and cabbage many times and haven't been really happy with any of my attempts--until today! I used a 3.8 lb corned beef brisket, added a bottle of Guinness to the simmering water along with extra pickling spice and red pepper flakes in a tea ball to simmer the beef. I, too, added extra carrots and turnips and cooked my potatoes in the juice. I tried the bourbon sauce and the horseradish sauce (halved both recipes for my small family) and we loved them both. My 85 year old father said "you're not supposed to experiment with a classic" but he finished his plate! Can't wait to for sandwiches, hash, and to try the broth as the base for some onion soup, as one reviewer suggested. Happy St. Patty's Day!!!

I've made this recipe every St. Patty's Day for the past five years and it is as good as they say-OUTSTANDING! I've made just a few modifications over the years, sometimes cooking just for my family, at other times for more than 30 people. Here are my suggestions: After adding the corned beef to the pot add 2 bottles of Guiness Stout and then add the water. The recipe says to add water to cover but increase the amount of liquid because you're going to want to add a few pounds of small red potatoes later and you'll need the additional liquid. Don't bring the water to a boil (if you can help it) but only to a simmer. After the water begins to simmer adjust the heat lower periodically-every 5-10 minutes or so until you've got it simmering on low. Skim the top after one hour of simmering and then add the pickling spices. Add a couple of cans of chicken broth mid way through cooking. After washing the potatoes I peel them only partially-making a stripe around the midsection. Add the potatoes during the last hour of cooking. I also use 2 heads of cabbage (during the last 20 minutes) and a small bag of peeled mini carrots-sometimes more if I'm cooking for a lot of people. Serve the cabbage with red wine vinegar. If making more than two briskets do one with the bourbon glaze. Serve the other brisket with a quality stone ground mustard. (Don't be afraid to splurge for the expensive stuff-it's worth it!) Make the horseradish sauce and serve it on the side as well-it's great with the potatoes! Happy St. Patrick's Day!

So, if I follow the instructions for the brick AND the glaze, how does that work? Doesn't the glaze not brown where the brick is? Or do you do one then the other in succession?

Rating: 3
Just a suggestion for this about the cabbage. Many in this country don't like the flavor of boiled cabbage, so I've often made a white sauce and chopped up the boiled cabbage into the white sauce. Voila! Creamed cabbage, which can be spiced up with salt and pepper. I've used this at parties and seldom have any left over. Also, a mild horseradish sauce with the corned beef cuts down on the "too salty" taste of the corned beef.

Shame for your cavalier treatment of this wonderful Irish heritage dish! (A) Substitute chicken broth for 1/2 the cooking water. (B) Include small whole or halved larger red (largely peeled) potatoes with the vegetables. (C) Finally, include a touch of Gaelic spirit with a half-bottle of Porter along with the cabbage.

I made this last year for St. Patty's day and it was wonderful - There were 4 adults (three men and one woman) to split a 3 1/2 lb brisket - I thought it would be plenty!!! Definitely going to make more this year - wanted left overs last year. I was slightly disappointed in the flavor of the cabbage - thought it would be more something - it was good though. I did use the bourbon glaze and it was fabulous. "A cook from Manchester, MA" on 3-15-05 wondered what to do with the leftover glaze (as it does make a lot). I didn't reduce mine, so it was still very thin, and used it as a marinde for pork chops (about 12 hours or so). It was so good, I've used that as a marinade several times since! Not as good with chicken. Anyway - great corned beef!

Thanks to all the great comments and suggestions. This is my first time preparing corned beef and it came out delicious. I used 1/2 Chimay Belgium Ale(what I had on hand)and 1/2 water to cover. I also added extra pickling spices with a few cloves of garlic in cheesecloth. I started on the stovetop and moved it to a 325 degree oven, weighing the corned beef down with a plate. After a few hours I removed the beef and made a glaze with equal parts mustard and brown sugar. Then I baked it at 400 degrees for 30 min while I simmered onions, carrots, parsnips and kale(much more flavorful and healthful than plain cabbage) in the broth. It was sooo good I didn't need or miss potatoes and butter! I also made an Irish brown soda bread from Gourmet's cookbook to accompany.

Rating: 4
Good idea is to let it simmer on stove for 30 min. then put in 325 degree oven with tin foil as a cover. I simmered on top of stove once and it got tough because you have to watch so closely to prevent boiling. In stove about an hour/pound. Also, used mainly 3/4 beer to 1/4 water.This made broth so tasty that I ate it with just the veggies as a soup for lunch today. Purchased corn beef at Whole Foods - all natural, no nitrates...big difference in taste (much better) than regular corned beef.

Just Fabulous-of course you would have thought I was cooking for the Queen with all the stress I put into this meal instead of just 2 good friends on St. Patty's day-I read all 100 of the reviews (start at the bottom and come up)-When I took a little taste as I was slicing it, I literally did a jig around the kitchen-it was great! I made a novice mistake of buying a plain brisket -passed this on to some cooking friends and started over with a corned beef-made the horseradish sauce and the glaze-cooked 5+ lbs for at least 6 hrs-made sure to watch the meat and not to boil it-just a slow simmer-If I can do this recipe successfully-ANYBODY can!

Many recipes on this site yield delicious results, but this one truely serves up "a dish beyond compare." Hyperbole or no, this is the best corned beef and cabbage I've ever had. I followed the suggestions of another reviewer (scroll down to "A Cook from Boston on 02/04/05"): I added Guinnes Stout and brushed the corned beef with her mustard sauce. Like others, I served it with Soda Bread. Fortunately, I got two meals from this recipe; the first night I blundered by serving it in one dish; I rectified that the second night by serving the meat and vegetables separately with horseradish sauce on the side. Superb. I made two soda breads from this site: Soda Bread with Raisins (Bon Appétit, 02/05) and Irish Soda Bread (Gourmet, 03/02); both are excellent, but the latter better compliments this dish. It won't be long before I make this dish again.

I've made this dish several times, and every time I ask my husband why we only have it once a year. This year I used a bottle of Mackeson Stout, two bay leaves, peppercorns and whole cloves. I also took the "brick" suggestion and it worked perfectly. This is always a hit on St. Patrick's Day.

Prepare this wonderful dish, using a pressure cooker, in 2 hours - honestly. Pressure cook Corned beef + spices + 2 cu water for 1 hr - remove and keep warm in oven. Check liquid in cooker - add whole potatoes, whole carrots, whole onions and cook for 7 min. Then add the quartered cabbage, parsnips, for 2 min. Wait for cooker to come up to pressure before timeing. Enjoy with lots of unsalted fresh butter! Happy Saint Patrick's Day!

This dish was a hit at our dinner table. We hosted a dinner with this as one of the main dishes and people couldn't stop talking about it as they ate it. Definitely use the Bourbon Glaze and the can of Guiness as written in the earlier reviews (scroll way down). This is an easy to prepare recipe and allows you to manage yourself in the kitchen when making multiple dishes to serve a group of people.

Ick! I made this for my dad who used to eat this all the time when he was young. Having never tasted this dish before, I'm not exactly sure if I messed up the recipe or if I just really don't care for the taste of corned beef and cabbage. My dad, however, thought it was okay. Nonetheless, I won't try this again!

Excellant dish! Used Guinness in the water to simmer, then finished in the oven with bourbon (apologies for not having Irish whiskey) and mustard glaze.I cooked the potatoes and cabbage in the brisket water. Very flavorful. Have found that the leftover broth makes an excellant base for French onion soup. Just add sliced sweet onions and slow cook for a few hours. Serve with toasted croutons and melted Swiss or Gruyere cheese.

About the question of substituting another cut of meat: The corned beef is pink because it is pickled in sodium nitrite/nitrate. An untreated roast will not produce the same result in this recipe . I have tried several times to make my own corned beef and have googled extensively in search of the right recipe. I recommend Joan Nathan's recipe from her wonderful and essential cookbook, "Jewish Cooking In America". You can find nitrite in the salt section of most supermarkets, for example, Morton's "tender quick" If you want to leave out the saltpeter, as Joan calls it, your beef will be gray rather than pink, and the texture will not be quite the same. 1 4-pound brisket of beef 1/4 cup large-grained kosher salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper 2 teaspoons ground ginger 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves 2 bay leaves, crumbled 1 tablespoon brown sugar 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg 1/8 teaspoon paprika 3 cloves garlic, minced 1 tablespoon saltpeter (optional) 1/2 cup warm water Wash and remove most of the fat from the brisket. Mix all the spices and the garlic and rub well into the brisket. Dissolve the saltpeter in the warm water and pour over the meat. Place in a large, non-metal container. Weight the meat down with a stone or brick and cover it with plastic wrap or aluminum foil. (You can also place the ingredients in a plastic bag and weight it down.) Refrigerate for 10 days to 2 weeks. Turn the meat every 2 to 3 days. Place the meat in a large pot of cold water. Bring to a boil and throw away the water. Repeat 3 times. Cover with cold again, bring to a boil, and cook over low heat, covered, for about 2 hours or until tender. Cool slice thin, and place on a platter.

Great corned beef & cabbage recipe. I put the corned beef in the crockpot at 7:30 a.m. with the spice packet that came with it and a bottle of Fat Weasel Ale. Came home at 5:00 and added the carrots and potatoes, turned to high and left it for 1/2 hr. or so. Added the cabbage and left it for at least another hour, maybe longer. Served it Sierra Nevada Pale Ale Honey Mustard. Absolutely divine! Will definitely make this one in this manner again.

Rating: 3
Also took the advise about adding stout but could only find Murphy's. Good stout but **warning** it has a self-pressurizer in the can to make sure the beer pours with a full head. Luckily the 5 hours I simmered the beef gave me sufficient time to clean a rather sticky kitchen. I use the pickling spices in the bag but put them in cheesecloth as I find that I skim out 3/4 of the spices when I skim the froth. Looking forward to trying the glazed version also.

For those using a smaller cut of meat, stick to the 1 hour per pound rule. Last night, 12 of my friends (ages 7 to 64) gave this recipe 4 forks and said it was the best corned beef they ever had. I actually never saw so many people really enjoying this dish! I cooked up 15 lbs of the stuff (4 point cuts aprx 3.5 lbs each, 3 cabbages, 4 lbs of carrots 3 large turnip and 5 lbs of potatos). Excellent! The key is to use the 1 hour per pound formula and simmer (never boil!). I used my huge counter top roaster, boiled water separately, poured on top of the meat and brought it to a simmer for 3 1/2 hours adjusting temp between 350-400 degrees so it NEVER boiled. Not only did I use the spices included with the meat, but added a TBL of peppercorns, a sprinkle of hot pepper flakes, 2 bay leaves, 1 tsp. whole allspice, and 10 or so cloves. Added a can of Guiness an hour into it. I took the meat out before my guests arrived as they came in 2 shifts, 2 hours apart. I made my version of glaze simmering til it turned to a thick syrup...1 jar of apricot preserves, a healthy squeeze of wasabi sauce and dijon mustard and bourbon. When the first group arrived, I added potatos to the pot of broth for 15 mins ahead then the turnip & carrots for 15 more before adding the cabbage for 20. The meat was glazed and put into a 400 degree oven while the veggies continued to cook for 15-20 mins and let it stand for 10 before slicing. The meat was firm but very tender and the veggies perfect in each of there own! Looks like St PAtty's day is at our house from now on!

I altered the recipe as follows: added to the water 2 cans of beer, 1 diced onion, a handful of peppercorns, 2 bay leaves and a few cloves. I did not cook the potatoes and carrots in the corned beef water. I added the cabbage to the water after removing the corned beef. Because it's hard to nail down a cooking time per pound (especially if making 2 pieces in the same pot), I think a meat thermometer is essential. The meat is ready when internal temp is 160.

Solid, classic recipe. I am half Irish and this has long been a family ritutal every St. Patrick's Day. Coleman's mustard (in the yellow tin) is de rigeur (you constitute it w/ cold water). Also Irish soda bread makes for a nice complement--many of the markets and speciality grocery stores carry it, or check Epicurious for the fall Gourmet 91 recipe. I bought the Niman Ranch corned beef--more expensive than the supermarket specials but so worth it in the quality--lean, flavorful. You can get that in the Western US at Trader Joe's. They also carry Irish butter and Irish cheese, which makes a nice-pre dinner appetizer. A selection of Irish red, ale and stout makes the whole deal great for easy entertaining! And don't forget the Bailey's for a sweet ending....

Absolute heaven!! Alot depends on the quality of the corned beef brisket you buy. In my experience the best ones come from a N.Y. butcher in those vacuum-packed things that contain about a half-cup of brineing liquid. To Sari from New York - the corned beef with caramalized onion & sauerkraut on this site is delish!

Wow! I have really been butchering this dish on past attempts! This was as delicious as promised. I cooked 10 lbs of beef (three pieces) in a bottle and a half of Guinness with water to cover. I used the glaze recommended in previous reviews, which was sweet, but yummy, and the brick (how amazing was that?) and also the horseradish sauce. Fabulous! A single recipe of both glaze and sauce was more than enough even though I doubled the meat. I did add both turnips and parsnips to the vegetable mix and used the stovetop method. Thanks to all for the great suggestions. This one's going in the vault!

Okay, this is a great recipe and I'll tell you why. 1) I'm Italian 2) I've never made corned beef before 3) I've never TASTED corned beef before AND I made this dish for my husband's Irish-American family of 10! I made two briskets, each 4.5 lbs. I cooked one in the slowcooker on low for 10 hours, and the other on the stove top for 5 hours. I added a half can of Guiness to each. My husband and his brothers said it was the best corned beef they've ever had...by the way, I served this with the Champ recipe from this site and everyone raved over that dish, too.

This recipe was wonderful and SO EASY. I read most of the other reviews and decided to make a few slight variations as well. I used a 3.5# brisket and simmered it for 4 hours. After skimming I added a bottle of beer like many suggested and the spice packet that came packaged with the meat. After 4 hours I transfered meat to a roasting pan with some of the juices and glazed it with a few tablespoons of mustard and brown sugar (equal parts) and roasted it at 300 for an additional hour. I boiled all my veggies (carrots, onions, potatoes and last 15 minutes added cabbage) while it finished in the oven. It was excellent. I will make this dish again.

I grew up with my mom making this dish the exact same way EXCEPT she didn't add the beer, I did and it was wonderful. I liked the flavor it added. The whole family loved it and I have a whole one left over to try one of the hashes that are on this site. Any recommendations?

We have this every year. I serve it with horseradish gravy. I use 2 cups water from the pot{strained} and 1 chicken boullion. Heat in separate pan. Mix togather 1 packet chicken gravy mix and 1 tablespoon cornstarch in 1/2 cup cold water until smooth. Whisk into water mixture. bring to a boil and then stir in 2 tablespoons prepared horseradish. Simmer 1-2 mins. Serve over potatoes, cabbage and meat. You can adjust horseradish to your own taste.

Very good recipe. I agree with the cook from Belfast that this is unusual in Ireland, with boiled bacon (which is NOT like bacon in the USA!) being much more common. I was also surprised at the scarcity of seafood in the Republic. We were told it was the result of all the "Fish Fridays" when growing up. I add a little brown sugar and a 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar which seems to bring out the flavors a bit.

This was very yummy. I think I may have made the glaze a bit incorrectly and didn't reduce it enough. It was pretty runny, rather than thick like syrup. I used Southern Comfort instead of brandy and it worked well. Next time I will reduce the glaze, though. I made the cornbeef in the crockpot with the beer and it was wonderful. I used some of the liquid and made a gravy for the vegetables. I think this was a great meal and will make it again!

This is one of my favorites! I discard the spices that come with the brisket and add about 10 peppercorns, a couple of whole cloves, 2 bay leaves and a clove of garlic, all wrapped in cheesecloth so as not lose them. I agree with the other readers - the combo of water and beer does make a difference, although it is fine with just water, too.

Funny enough, corned beef and cabbage isn't actually very common in Ireland! It's more of an Irish-American dish. In Ireland you're more likely to find something called 'boiled bacon,' which is similar in terms of prep and presentation but is pork. But who cares - it's a great Irish-American dish and it's part of St Patrick's Day in the USA! For a high-quality brisket, buy one from a good kosher deli. It will be very salty, so soak it for a good 12 hours, changing the water a few times. It will be worth it. For a variation on the cabbage, you can make colcannon, which is like champ but contains cabbage instead of onions. Shred your cooked cabbage and stir it into creamy mashed potatoes, with lots of butter and maybe some chives. Yummy. Also, turnips and swedes (rutabagas?) would make frequent appearances in Irish dishes like this. And for the reviewers who found it plain... don't forget that what most people know as Irish food is peasant food, and it is based on high quality ingredients and simple prep. Another thing - Ireland is an island! I'm disappointed the Epicurious St Pat's day recipes don't contain more seafood.

Loved it!! The glaze is definitely what made this above and beyond. Thanks to Saratoga for the recipe (3/4 c. bourbon, 3/4 c. apple juice, 3 T. mustard, 1.5 c. brown sugar). I am saving the left over broth and glaze and am trying to figure out some type of stew to make with it. Any ideas??

To the cook from Chicago: it is completely normal for the corned beef to float, just set a salad plate on top of it in the pot.

I tried this receipe as it was written, only I cooked it in a crockpot for 8 hrs as suggested by other reveiwers,in honor of St Patrick's Day and my minimal Irish ancestry. We had guests over and none of us liked it. I guess we just aren't the corned beef and cabbage type. My roommate loved it though. She said it tasted better than what her mom usually makes. Guess I will try the corned beef and hash with the leftovers. If I ever do make this again I think I will try the variations suggested by other reviewers.

Very tasty. I followed the suggestion of cooking with Guiness. I had bought a 2.8lb piece so I cooked for about 3 1/2 hours. I served with the Champ recipe also from Epicurious and it was a major hit.

This is a great example of why I love getting recipes from Epicurious. I'm sure the recipe on its own is very good, but incorporating many of the reviewers' suggestions (start at very bottom & scroll up!) made it OUTSTANDING. I too used my crock pot (set on low) - put in the beef @ 9 a.m. with a bottle of Harps & then water to cover + a few peppercorns & mustard seeds, added the carrots, onion & potatoes @ 5 p.m., the cabbage @ 6:15 pm. and took everything out at 6:30. I sometimes find that the veggies get too mushy if you leave them in all day - this way they were cooked just right. I then put the beef in a 400 degree oven, slathering a 1 to 1 mixture of brown sugar & grainy mustard on top. Let that cook for 20 minutes and it was FANTASTIC - I can't imagine skipping that step. I also made the horseradish sauce, and it was a winner. Made a sandwich the next day for my husband using the sliced corned beef, sauce & raw cabbage leaves - YUM! The only thing I would note is about the corned beef. In MA at least, it comes in 2 varieties - red or "gray", which is New England style. It also comes either "flat cut" or "point cut". A very nice Irish-American woman in the meat section, seeing the perplexed look on my face, told me that I wanted the flat cut gray variety. While the finished version was perfectly salty & delicious, the appearance was a little off-putting. She did note that the red variety was too salty - so that may explain the issue other reviewers had. For appearances only, I may try the red one next time and soak it in water overnight to cut the saltiness. Otherwise - this recipe is a BIG winner. Enjoy!

I have never made Corned Beef and Cabbage before, and I decided for the new year, I'd give it a try. I took the advice of others here and added a can of Guinness after the first hour of cooking. I cooked a 3.5 lb piece of meat and let it simmer for 5 hours. It was PERFECT! My family loved it and I could tell they were really serious! I also made the Irish Soda Bread (recipe on this site) with it and that was a hit as well.

This made a great Monday night dinner! I did add a can of Guinness which gave a very interesting flavor to the broth. Used red skin potatoes. Served some applesauce on the side. Beef slices will make a great sandwich tomorrow.

This was the first time I had ever made Corned Beef. It was fantastic! But we don't eat a lot of salt, so I soaked the beef overnight in water, drained it the next day and then poured a 16 oz. bottle of smoked porter (beer) over it, along with a combination of low salt beef broth and water. It really cut down on the saltiness, because the next day I did another brisket without soaking it and it was much saltier. I served the brisket with Brown Soda bread, boiled potatoes with butter and parsley and my neighbor made "Champ" (mashed potatoes with scallions). We had an American-Irish dinner to honor my Irish roots and the meal was fabulous. This recipe is a keeper.

Made this recipe last night for a party of 10. Used 8 lbs. of beef. Added a X-large bottle of dark ale after first 1/2 hour. Used the bourbon glaze and the brick in the oven method (see previous reviews) for the last 1/2 hour. THERE WAS NOT A MORSEL OF BEEF LEFT! Everyone said it was the BEST corned beef they ever had. I actually boiled the potatoes carrots and cabbage separately, as I thought the corned beef broth looked too red. (was there dye in the corned beef?) Never made corned beef before so I didn't know if that was normal. Does anyone know?

Rating: 4
Such a simple recipe for such a yummy dish! Made this a day early for St. Patrick's Day, and was amazed at how tender and juicy the corned beef was -- the trick is to keep it at a very low simmer for a very long time. I cooked a 2.5 lb piece for over 4 hours, and it was much more tender than in the past, when I cooked it at a higher temp for shorter time. I also took reviewers below advice and after one hour I removed the scum, then added a can of Guiness Stout. The cooking liquid was, for the first time, really tasty, and I enjoyed mopping it up with some crusty bready with the dinner. Oh, and I also threw in some whole cloves with the peppercorns at the beginning -- they add a subtle sweetness to the overall taste. You can't go wrong with this recipe. Enjoy!

I still think the best and easiest way to cook a corned beef is to put it in the crockpot at the lowest setting, and let it cook slowly all day. That said, this is still an excellent alternative!

I am not sure WHAT I did wrong--I read all the rave reviews and followed the suggestion to reduce saltiness by boiling for 1/2 hour and then dumping half the H2O and adding a nice hoppy beer and H2O to cover. The meat is bland as can be, though tender. I may have just gotten a bad cut of corned beef...it seems everyone had such success. I am dismayed!

Pretty good with others advice. I added apple chunks, and would recommend cutting the cabbage similarly to the way the onion was cut and sauteeing it all in the bacon grease. A few cracked peppercorns would cook in quite well.

Made this with the Bourbon Glaze and absolutely loved it. Next time, and there definitely WILL be a next time, I will try the following suggestion (I think from Time-Life Books) to reduce saltiness: " Place...beef in pot. Cover with cold water and bring to a boil. Remove the scum as it appears. Reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. If the liquid is salty after 10 minutes, start again with boiling water. "

I used a half-bottle of pale ale. Should've used more, or Harp's or Guiness instead. I did the crockpot method with chunks of potatoes, carrots, onion, parsnip, and turnip - the cabbage was thrown in later, and I didn't use butter. Overall, I the meal wasn't too salty, and I especially enjoyed the tasty horseradish sauce listed here.

This is soooo easy and absolutely delicious. I served this to my family of twelve for St. Patrick's Day and it was like a bunch of locusts had arrived. I had prepared enough so there would be leftovers to make corned beef hash, but to my amazement, every speck was eaten up!! So, I cooked the entire meal again the next night. I added a half a bottle of Guiness and a half bottle of Harp to the pot and then added enough water to cover. (Make a black and tan with the remaining halves). We served the meal with a horseradish sauce made with 3/4 cup sour cream, 1/4 cup prepared white horseradish, 3 Tablespoons chopped chives, and fresh lemon juice from half a lemon (a few teaspoons). Last year, I made the bourbon/apple juice glaze for the meat and I actually prefer it without. It had a good flavor, but it is sweet and it's a very different end-product. I prefer the more savory version, without the glaze. We served this with some hearty rye bread AND Irish soda bread. They both go wonderflly with this meal. We finsihed off the tasty meal with the Irish Cream Chocolate Mousse Cake, also from this sight. Drink a black and tan enjoy this simple yet fabulous meal. Yum!

Can't beat this basic recipe because it's so easy. I skipped the whole baking part of it and just simmered it on the stove per the recipe. I was worried about overcooking the meat, but it came out fine. Didn't rinse the meat ahead of time so that all the meat juices helped flavor the vegetables in the pot. Served it with gourmet's irish soda bread.

This was delicious. I took the advise of some of the other cooks and made the apple/bourbon glaze. I glazed it and then broiled the top for just a few minutes before serving. the horseradish sauce was great w/potatoes. I sauted my cabbage with caraway seeds instead of boiling though.

Fantastic!! Made this for the second year in a row...exceptional dish with no leftovers. As others recommended - added a bottle of beer after skimming off the foam 30 minutes into the simmering process. Made Lakeville, MI's (3/6/02) horseradish sauce: 'Whip 1 cup of heavy whipping cream until peaks form, fold in 1/4 cup horseradish sauce, 1/2 cup mayonnaise, 1 tbsp dijon mustard and bit of sugar.' Made Saratoga, CA's (3/16/01) to die for glaze: "took the beef out after 4 hours and put in a 400 oven for 30 minutes with the following glaze:kept the broth and cooked the carrots, potatoes and cabbage in it. Glaze: 1 1/2 cups brown sugar, 3/4 cup apple juice, 3 tbs mustard and 3/4 cup bourbon." Simmer, simmer, simmer...don't boil. If you have problems trying to keep the water from boiling even on low, make a flame tamer: 3-ft. piece of foil crumpled into an "o" shape and put on your gas burner. It lifts the pot about 1/2" from the flame and helps keep the heat down. I won't wait another year to make this again.

No number rating, because I used the crock pot (as mentioned by other reviewers). Maybe it was the meat (I used Usinger's black angus corned beef), and maybe it was because I cooked it on low all day, but it seemed kind of "washed out" to me. The spice flavor was there, but it just didn't have that salty quality that I expect with corned beef. That said, it was still good. I did notice that there was much less of the distinctive "I'm cooking corned beef" smell than I'm used to. Don't know if that's also attributable to the crock pot, or the meat itself. The bottom line: these are great instructions for the basic preparation of corned beef, which I will continue to make.

this was the best! i just threw the brisket in the crock pot on high, added 1/2 of the jar of pickeling spices and went away. after about 6 hours i threw in the carrots and onions and then 15 minutes before serving threw in the cabbage - this meal caused a unanimous clean plate club at this dinner party!

Well, after going through all the reviews for this recipe, I used all the suggestions. I cooked in the crock pot using two beers--one for the corned beef and one for the cook--:) After cooking the beef for approx. 6 hrs on low, I put the beef in the oven with the bourbon glaze at 400 for 30 min. Oh, also laughed my az off when I was wrapping the brick with tin foil which eventually sat on top the beef in the oven. The corned beef came out so tender and tasty but the brick was a bit crunchy. Also made the horseradish recipe found in the reviews and thought it was a nice accompaniment. Will make again but next time I will look for a better cut of brick!

I made this recipe following what the saratoga suggested (the bourbon glaze) When I boiled the meet I added a can of stout beer. I really like it, my husband who doesn't like boiled meat found it alright. I think this is a good recipe with the modifications. However if you aren't a fan of boiled meat it may not bowl you over.

I followed the recipe adding the spice packet included with the (round) brisket. I also added 1 can of Guiness and some of the onions. Brought to a boil and simmered 5 hours. Added carrots, rest of onions, quartered red potatoes and cabbage. Simmered 1/2 hour. Removed meat, letting vegetables continue to simmer. I made a glaze of German mustard (with seed)and brown sugar. Equal parts. Put in 350 oven for 20 minutes. AWESOME! My kids loved it - which is always the test. Served with biscuits.

I made this last year for St. Patrick's Day. I followed "A Cook from Tampa's" advice and added a turnip and removed the meat 1/2 hour before the vegetables were done.

I made this for my family on St Patty's Day. It was awesome and everyone loved it! I agree with everyone - definitely use the bourbon glaze and the horseradish-cream sauce. The meat came out very tender and sliced like butter. It was not dried out like other corned beef I have made in the past.

Made this for St Pats day and it brought back fond memories of the "New England Boiled Dinners" my dad used to make for Sunday suppers. I, too, added potatoes and turnips. My only problem was that I don't think I bought a high enough quality cornbeef, either that or it needed to be soaked first. It was extremely salty, much more than normal as this is by nature a very salty meal. I have made briskets in the past and have never had this kinds of saltiness. Live and learn!

This is a great basic recipe that we like to have every St. Pat's day. For a real treat, remove the meat before the vegetables are done and spread a glaze of mustard and brown sugar over the top (fat side up) then garnish with cloves and cook 20-30 min. in the oven at 350.

I've made this twice for my husband for St. Patrick's day and he couldn't be happier. I use plain ol' (spring) water, throw the potatoes (cut up) into the pot at the end with the cabbage, and with all that wonderful beef fat coating everything, butter is entirely extraneous! I've learned though it's best to not add the pickling spices until after skimming the froth or you'll end up skimming off the spices too.

I've made this exact recipe for years, using the spice bag that comes with the corned beef. I add the potatoes, but cook the cabbage a bit longer, about 20 mins. Serve the cabbage with cider vinegar, the corned beef with horseradish/sour cream. When we are lucky enough to have leftovers, we make corned beef sandwiches with sauerkraut.

This is the best corned beef recipe I have found. I, too, substituted beer for some of the water (about 3/4 bottle of Guinness - I swear there was a tear in my boyfriend's eye when I poured it in!). After cooking was complete, I then placed the corned beef in a baking dish with the bourbon glaze previously mentioned (I used 1/4 C bourbon, 1/2 C of grapefruit juice - that was all I had -, brown sugar and mustard) and baked for about 30 minutes (turning corned beef in pan for 15 minutes at a time) and I have to say it was incredible. I sometimes make it without the vegies for good sandwich fixings! Try it - you won't be disappointed!

I often make this dish almost exactly as this recipe indicates. It is fabulous. When I am feeling lazy I throw the potatoes in the pot with the corned beef and other veggies. It kind of all smooshes together deliciously with the pot juices when served.I put a big spoonful of Grey Poupon on my plate and dip it all up. Delicious with a cold beer and some rye bread!Use leftovers for hash a couple of days later, and if you didn't use all your cabbage, make coleslaw and serve the next day with leftovers on sandwiches (uses up that extra rye bread, too).

This is the perfect recipe for the perfect St. Patrick's Day dinner. As for the glaze the cook from Saratoga recommends ... TRY IT!

For those who agree with me that corned beef is frequently too salty, here is what I do. I cover it with water and let simmer for about half an hour, discard the water, then add fresh water (the beer suggestion is a good one) and spices. I added a lot more spices than called for. Overall, a good recipe. I see no need to cook the potatoes separately.

We make corned beef every St. Patrick's Day, and this was by far the best yet. I added a bottle of dark beer 1 hour into the cooking time, then made the glaze with the brown sugar, apple juice, mustard & bourbon. Baked the beef in the oven for the last 20 minutes with the glaze on - fantastic.

Simply delicious! I used 1/2 beer and half water and made Epicurious' Horseradish Cream as a sauce which was a real find that I will use over and over again!

This dish was a regular sunday dinner for us when I was growing up, and I thought I'd see how other folks do it. In my version, I add a can of guinness to the water about an hour into the cooking, substitute parsnips entirely for the carrots, and include enough potatos to make a meal in themselves. If the meat doesn't come with pickling spices, I add mustardseed and juniper berries to the usual mix, for extra spiciness!

Very good. I'd already gotten it started so didn't do the beer. But just before I added the cabbage, I pulled off about 3 cups of liquid, put it in a saucepan, added some corn starch to thicken it, a bouillion cube & some parsley. This I used as a sauce with the veges. Very good!

This was my first attempt at corned beef and cabbage, and I must say it turned out great. I took the advice of those adding beer to the water mix and it tasted great. The meat was very tender and the potatoes and cabbage had a great taste as well. Yum!

I made this for St. Patrick's Day and it was by far the best corned beef & cabbage I ever made! The only thing I did different was I added the potatoes to the corned beef about and 1 1/2 hours before it was finished because I was getting a little behind time. It turned out awesome. Everyone loved and there was hardly any leftovers (I missed my corned beef sandwich's!) Would absolutley make again!

Excellent S. Patricks day meal. I used Mary Beth's suggestion and covered with half beer and half water and it was very delicious. I served it with Champ potatoe dish and guests raved about the dinner.

try using your presssure cooker, cuts the cooking time from 5 hours down to one hour. Resulet sar excellent. Also put in parsnips. Happy St Patricks Day.

I'm always surprised that most corned beef recipes call for boiling or simmering the meat. I find it is much better to put the corned beef and vegetables, covered with aluminum foil, in a 300 degree oven for a few hours, and then remove the cover in the last 45 minutes of cooking.At that time, increase the teperature to 375 degrees. The meat will be tender but will also have a nice glaze and will be slightly crispy on top.

This is a very good recipe for Corned Beef and Cabbage, I agree with MaryBeth from San Francisco, beer mixed with the water makes an excellent substitution, and for your non-alcohol drinking friends alcohol-free beer works just fine...my only suggestion on the beer is to cut it to one fourth of the total amount of liquid...and if you really want to simplify your life, toss all the ingredients into that crockpot that has been sitting up on your pantry shelf and let it simmer on the LOW setting for about 10-12 hours...it will come out so tender it will melt in your mouth...this is a great way to do it all in one pot and never have to worry...too often people ruin corned beef by accidentally allowing it to come to a boil and that toughens the meat beyond repair, with the auto temp of a crockpot this never happens.....enjoy!!.....Scott

Try subsituting beer, Harp is a good one, for 1/2 of the water. It is how we always did it in Boston and my friends say it is the best ever!

This is a tremendously satisfying and delicious "comfort food" recipe. I'll definitely make this again in the fall and winter. I modified/updated this 1965 recipe a bit, just because I can never leave well enough alone in a recipe: 1. sear the meat to seal in juices, but don't season beforehand; 2. add a cup of white wine in place of one cup of water; 3. double up on the carrots, they add sweetness; 4. use both the 6 peppercorns and use 2 T. of the picking spice. 7. sit back and let the house start smelling great!

Easy dinner to make, perfect for entertaining friends on St. Patrick's Day. Irish Soda Bread is a wonderful accompaniant.

Exactly the way I cooked this in Ireland. It is essential that the vegetables (with the exception of the potoes) be cooked with the corned beef, I serve this with a Horseradish Sauce
