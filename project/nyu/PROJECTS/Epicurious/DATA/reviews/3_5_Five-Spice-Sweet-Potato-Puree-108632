This was part of an Hawaiian luncheon for 35. I did add some brown sugar. It was GREAT! People wanted the recipe for Thanksgiving!

I also added brown sugar, about 2 TBLS. Served this a part of a Hawaiian themed meal. Delicious!

This recipe converted all the sweet potato 'yuckers' in my family to sweet potato 'yummers'! It's like eating dessert with dinner! We now prepare sweet potatoes many different ways (grilled, roasted, etc.) and always add ginger and five-spice powder. Excellent!

I will never cook sweet potatos any other way, I loved it.

pretty good. i made this twice, and i recommend making sure you don't add too much five-spice (it quickly becomes overpowering). also, i added 2 1/2 tablespoons of brown sugar the second time, which helped the flavour a lot. third suggestion is to puree it until completely smooth (more like 2 minutes instead of 1)

Interesting flavor, though I wasn't personally that fond of it. It was a nice contrast to the rest of the meal and tasted different from your usual sweet potato puree.

The combination of the ginger and five-spice was perfect and this recipe is going in my special recipes binder
