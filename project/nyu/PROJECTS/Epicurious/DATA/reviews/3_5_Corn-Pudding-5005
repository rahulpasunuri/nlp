I didn't make as written, because I'm a rebel without a clue. I used 2 lbs of corn, pureed one. I added 4 dried red chilies I had in my pantry and some garlic. I used 1&1/3 cup buttermilk and 1/3 cup cream. I didn't use any cheese like some people but I wish I had. Tastes really good like I made it, and I'll make it again, probably playing around with it some more too, just for fun. Seems like a versatile and forgiving recipe.

I made this recipe exactly as written and didn't like it at all. It was like a big corn omelet with barely enough egg to hold it together. My favorite corn pudding recipe calls for pureeing the corn and that works much better.

I made this the first time for Thanksgiving. Wow! My guests loved it - even the picky ones. I did add about 2 T chopped parsley to add a bit of color. I also creamed 4 cups of corn as suggested by other readers. My husband, who prefers creamed corn, loved this too. Will definitely make again!

This was super easy, healthy and totally delicious. I made it as written, used a sweet onion and skim milk. oh but I cut the recipe in half. We had it with beer can chicken and arugula salad. Soooo good.

I've read the reviews & made this dish several times, so here's my variation. Instead of souffle dishes, I use a 13x9x2 glass casserole dish. I thaw the corn & puree half of it with 2 cups of half-and-half (instead of the milk called for in the recipe). I then mix it with the eggs and add about a cup of grated cheddar. Once the onions are sauteed, I use masa flour instead of all-purpose flour. Lastly, I stir a 4-ounce jar of diced pimientos and a 4-ounce can of diced green chiles into the mix. The pimientos & chiles add a mild pepper taste and really brighten up the dish in terms of color. This is the one thing I know I can consistently make and not have to worry about leftovers. I get raves every time, even from picky eaters.

I give this four forks for what I think it would taste like, not for how I made it... Accidentally doubled the milk (a poorly executed effort to halve the recipe) and it was still probably the most popular Christmas dish on the table! I did make it with the tweaks suggested by the Texas cook. Would definitely make this again but with the proper amount of milk next time.

This dish is easy and impossible to mess up. I've even made it with skim milk when I didn't have whole on hand. I always puree half the corn with some of the milk. I also have done several variations on it. A handful of grated pepper jack is nice. Or a handful of grated gruyere and some smoked paprika sprinkled on top. Have also put leftover chopped up ham and in it - yum. With a salad, the ham variation makes a hearty meal.

This recipe surfaced on this website the other day so I thought I'd give it a try after reading the comments from Claypotz and a Cook from Spring, Texas. They were right on about everything. I just made a single recipe but used 1 cup cream and 1 cup whole milk and the 3 tablespoons sugar are a must. Pureeing the 4 cups corn had to have made the difference - it was so creamy. Also, I buttered a 9 x 13 Pyrex and it baked beautifully and was done in an hour - just perfect. Thanks Claypotz and A Cook From Spring, Texas - you did good.

The only suggestion I would make is to stir the pudding after the first 15 minutes and once again 15 minutes later--This will keep the whole corn through out the pudding and not on the bottom

I have to clarify that I gave this recipe a four fork rating because not only did I love it but my guests loved it too. Also, I didn't make it exactly like the recipe..I made the variation proposed by the reviewer from Texas that a lot of other epicurious fans mentioned was really good. Well it was. I made 1.5 recipes. I pureed a 2 lb bag of corn with the milk and salt and to that I added 3 tbsp of sugar like the Texas reviewer suggested. I used 1 cup of half and half and 2 cups of 2% milk. Then I mixed that into the onion, eggs and flour mixture and to that I added a 1lb bag of Birdseye white and yellow corn. I put the whole thing in a big casserole dish and cooked it for an hour at 350 degrees on the convection setting for most ot the time. At the very end when the top was looking pretty well browned I turned off the convection and used the regular bake feature.

I baked this in a shallow 13" oval and dusted top with chili powder and pushed cubes of monterey jack into top before baking. Looked and tasted fabulous.

I halved this recipe and used one onion, and I found the flavor to be overwhelmingly oniony. Next time I'll either use less onion, or use a nice Walla Walla or Vidalia, which would be sweeter. I threw in about 1 tablespoon of sugar, pureed about 2/3 of the corn, and used 2% milk. The texture was exactly what I was looking for but I thought the flavor was only okay. The BF loved it, though, much to my surprise, so I'll definitely make it again, with adjustments.

Great recipe and extremely easy to make!. I followed some of the tips from other people who had made it and it came out wonderful!. I did almost all the steps the same, except I added 4 tbsp of sugar and I used 1% milk. Also instead of butter, I used 4 tbsps of olive oil since it's healthier then butter. I also added the salt to the onions to prevent over browning. Follow these tips and you'll have a successful corn pudding.

Great recipe once you tweak it. Followed another reviewer's advice and pureed most of the corn, added paprika, cayenne pepper, and used half whipping cream and half whole milk. Delicious! I was looking forward to leftovers but had none. This is a keeper.

I have made this more times than I can count. Pure comfort food. But, I have found that a 16 oz package of frozen corn is plenty.

After many attempts at different corn pudding/souffle recipes, this one is the best so far. After a run of this recipe, I did however, make some minor revisions that makes this even better. I used only 1 medium onion because I found that 2 onions was too pungent and overpowered the corn flavor. I also used cream instead of milk (1/2 milk, 1/2 cream is good too)pureed 4 cups of frozen corn kernels, kept 2 cups whole, added finely chopped red bell pepper for both color and flavor, and took previous advice on adding sugar. The cook from Texas added 3 tablespoons, but I added 4-5. There is some play with that amount because of the sweetness of the corn you choose to use. I also added a dash or so of cayenne, not enough to alter the taste at all, but give it some depth. I'm sure this would do just as well in a dish more shallow than a souffle dish. Much better!

I made this dish for Thanksgiving. Instead of individual dishes, I put everything in one big casserole dish...I even made it the day ahead!! Didn't bake it until the next day and it turned out great. It was a little bland, I'll admit but sometimes with a lot of other flavors going on in the other side dishes, it is perfect. I do think next time I'll add a kicked up cheese....maybe jalepeno munster.

I thought this recipe was only "ok" but my husband proclaimed it one of the best things he's had in a long time! (?) Well, at least it was ridiculously easy!

The first time I made this I thought it was good but too bland and a little too "set". So now I heat up the milk and add chicken boullion to it (omit the salt then) before adding it, use less flour in the roux and, as someone suggested, chop up half the corn first. I also add a pinch of nutmeg to it, which may not be everyones taste. It´s almost ridiculous how often I make this dish now, it's so good!

I've been making this for a few years now.. every Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve dinner !!! I occasionally make it when I have baked chicken or a special Sunday dinner. It's delicious!

I threw in a couple of handfuls of grated jalapeno jack cheese that we had in the house. Wow!! Delicious!! I think any kind of cheese would be good, but the jalapeno jack really added a "kick" to the overall taste. Also, I pulsed about one half of the corn in the food processor and then added it to the rest of the corn kernels; gave the whole dish a very nice texture.

Made this for Christmas dinner (main course was Roast Rib Roast) and it was a hit! Followed the suggestions from the Texas cook and pureed 4 cups of the corn; substituted cream for milk; and added sugar (I used supersweet frozen corn but still liked it sweeter). Also sauteed 1 diced red bell pepper and added it to the pudding. The adults and kids (two toddlers) loved it and everyone asked to take home leftovers.

Wonderful! I agree with suggestions to liquefy part of the corn, and to use cream and a bit of sugar. The result was delicious and was an impressive but easy addition to Thanksgiving dinner.

This is the first corn pudding I have made and it was delicious. I pureed two thirds of the corn like the Texas cook and added a little sugar. My husband also enjoyed it and I will definitely be making again soon.

I have been making this recipe for years, and it has become a family favorite. The trick to a sweet pudding is to use "extra sweet" yellow frozen corn. I also bake it in a souffle dish which makes a nice presentation at the table.

I have made this recipe many times, and all just love it. It especially suits youngsters and teens who all seem to love corn. I try to find butter and sugar corn kernels for this recipe.

I've been looking for a GOOD basic corn pudding recipe and this is it! My changes were as follows, liquify 4C of corn, keep 2C whole. Use cream instead of milk and added 2 Tbs. of sugar. It was fantastic! It gave it the texture and taste I was looking for.

I made a 1/3 version in the microwave. 4 min. for the onions & butter, 1 min w/ the flour. Added the rest plus a tsp of bullion granules and gave it 10 minutes more. Even the kids liked it.

I would make this recipe again but add some kind of sweetner. Everyone liked it, but I remember my corn pudding from New England childhood and I think that I would add a bit of sugar.

I have made this every year since 1992, lost the recipe, and hoped I would find it here. This is a winner at our dinners: don't overcook, don't cook in one dish, and it should come out beautifully!

This was a big disappointment. Not creamy at all.
