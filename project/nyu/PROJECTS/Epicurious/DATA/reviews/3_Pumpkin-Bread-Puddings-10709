I nearly burned down my house trying to make this! It started smoking in the microwave at around 15 minutes. I had to throw the whole thing out- it was burned and hard as a rock! Where did I go wrong?

The flavor of this pudding was very good, but it had way too much bread. I only used 3 slices of bread, but that was still too much - the pudding was rather dry. Also the serving size is huge - way too much for two people to eat at one time.If I made it again, I would use 2 slices of bread and maybe a little more pumpkin for a moister result.It is very easy to make.

try raisin bread

I put my bread pudding in a casserole dish sitting in a dish of water and baked it in the oven instead of microwaving it. I hate the soggy microwave effect, so baking it was much better -- even though it took a long time. Next time I make this dish, I'll use a firmer, crustier bread (like French bread) than the recipe recommends. Regular cinnamon-raisin bread makes the dish too mushy. I've been a bread pudding connoisseur for years now, and I always like some crustiness (and crispiness on the top and edges) to my bread pudding.

I MADE A FEW CHANGES SINCE i WAS A FEW INGREDIENTS SHORT. i TOASTED POTATO BREAD, LIGHTLY BUTTER IT AND REMOVED THE CRUSTS, IN PLACE OF THE RAISIN BREAD. i INCREASED THE RAISINS TO 1 CUP AND PLUMPED THEM IN BOILING WATER FOR A FEW MINUTES BEFORE ADDING TO THE PUDDING. I also increased the cinnamon to 1/2 teaspoon and also the vanilla to 1/2 teaspoon. this is probably on the quickest and delectable desserts I've ever had. Also finished off pudding with a drizzle of cream. Excellent.........I hope you enjoy it too.

I had some leftover canned pumpkin and found this recipe. It's fantastic, especially warm with fresh whipped cream. I had increased the amounts to feed more people and cooked it all together in a glass loaf pan. It worked great!
