We don't eat much starch/gluten so omitted the pita - it was STILL great!

Loved this. Did not get pocket pitas so I didn't try to cut them in half and it worked fine. Great flavors and very summery. I served with the Persian Rice with Golden Crust for a meatless meal. Check out my review on KateCookstheBooks.com!

Outstanding. This is a great summer meal!

Made this recipe tonight for a middle eastern themed meal and it was excellent! The grilled vegetables and fresh herbs all mixed together nicely. I used toasted french bread instead of the pita bread. All around great meal, I would recommend it on a nice summery day to accompany any grilled meal. I also was glad that I read a review and halved the ingredients as using it per the recipe will give you a solid 8 servings.

Fantastic. Only adjustment that I made was that I broiled the zucchini and peppers instead of grilling. Also, it makes A LOT. I served with "My Favorite Falafel" recipe from Epicurious, harissa mixed with yogurt and tahini sauce.

Delicious. Alot of work with so many ingredients. We enjoyed the strong flavors of cilantro and mint. We omitted the olives as we don't like, and used Farmers Bread instead of pita (a thick dense wheat bread). We made a 1/2 batch which was easily enough for 6 people - will make less next time. We did reserve the bread to add at serving. We liked that it absorbed some of the juice with out being soggy. We couldn't find sumac but this was delicious without - the cumin, cilantro and mint added alot of flavor.

Great summer recipe and equally perfect as a vegetarian main OR side. I used a grill pan and grilled (only until nicely al dente, not to smithereens) 4 small zucchini, 2 large bell peppers and also grilled the green onions a bit. I served the pita on the side, cut the olive oil down to 1/4 C. (equal parts lemon & olive oil), used the full tsp of cumin, cut the feta to 1/2 c. (used light feta), skippped the mint/cilantro (husband & kids dislike both) and added two cans of rinsed & drained garbanzo beans. Yes, I monkeyed with the recipe a fair amount, but the end result was, I think, in the spirit of the original and was very good. For leftovers (yes, there were plenty, and I was so glad i hadn't added the pita!) the next night I grilled some lamb chops and served the fattoush on a bed of spring greens. Will happily make it again.

I used this recipe as my side dish for the Morrocan Marinated Sturgeon also from Bon Appetit. This has to be one of the best fattoush salads I have ever had. I actually cut up the tomatoes first and let them sit with salt and pepper for an hour. I added fresh oregano, doubled the cumin, and agave nectar to the dressing. I feel the agave did a good job of balancing the lemon juice. I finished the salad off with fresh chopped basil, parsley, and cilantro. Everyone raved about the salad even a friend who grew up in the Middle East. I think the best part were the dressing soaked grilled pita...YUM!

Oh this was sooooo good! I actually made it without the bread but it was excellent. My SO took one look at it and said it won for color--and then he tasted it! I did indoors using my Cuisinart Griller--cut the cucumber and tomatoes and up while I grilled the peppers, took them off and put on Grilled Rosemary Lambchops from epi, finished cutting up herbs & olives, made dressing, cut up zucchini and peppers, poured dressing over added feta and tossed. Lamb was then ready and onto the table! Very quick and easy and a great meal even in the middle of winter. Will definitely make again and again.

My husband did enjoy this, too. I broiled the zucchini, bell pepper and a white onion (instead of green onion). I also added a little balsamic vinegar, honey and worchestershire sauce to the dressing. We're with the reviewer who prefers the pita with hummus on the side. I didn't look for sumac and used fresh basil instead of mint.I loved the feta in it and really enjoyed it for lunch the next day.

This is one of my favorite summer salads. It's full of wonderful flavors and really lets the veggies be the hero of the dish. I use reduced-fat feta cheese, in block-form, just to help in shaving a few calories off the dish. I've found that the pita bread isn't really necessary (I prefer to have s side of hummus and pita on the table instead), but do LOVE to sprinkle sumac on the top of my portion. Yummy is all that I have to say! And I'm enjoying the leftovers today!

All the veggies should be chopped to a similar size for flavors to blend evenly. Even better the next day. Hubby want's to make it on a regular basis.

This was delicious. I grilled the veggies a bit longer than suggested (firm but not crunchy) and they were perfect in the salad. I used Armenian flat bread (thicker than Naan bread) - just the right thickness. Otherwise I'd use ciabatta. Try to find sumac - it adds a wonderful tang to the salad and so typical in fattoush. Making this salad for the second time this week. Definitely a keeper!

Number one, this recipe makes enough to feed a herd. 16 to 20 servings. As far as taste goes, it was a tad too bitter. In between the olives and the lemon dressing and the Sumac, the sweetness and crunch of everything else just kind of got lost. For example, you couldn't tell this had mint leaves and cumin in it. It was different, pretty and not something I'll make again.

I have made this twice now, and everyone loves it, even the kids and my picky father. I excluded the bread the second time and reduced the olive oil to 1/4 cup and it was excellent. I also switched the olives for 1/2 cup of capers. It's already been requested for the next family cook out!

Excellent dish; one of my favorites. Good as a side dish and also as a main course. Add the grilled bread just before you serve the salad in order to maintain the crunchiness. And then, only add the bread to the salad thats being served; otherwise any leftovers will have soggy bread in it. Save some grilled bread in an airtight container to add to the leftover salad the next day.

Yes, this is an excellent recipe. I made the dressing as suggested, but to cut down on calories, let each person drizzle they amount they wanted rather than douse the whole thing. It's almost unneeded with the strong flavors from the feta and olives. If you plan to have leftovers, leave the pita bread out as it gets soggy overnight and add it at the last minute.

This is excellent. I live in the middle east and this is even better than some of the fattoush that I've had here (which is often drowning in vinegar). I made this according to the recipe but overcooked the zukes. Make sure you just gently grill the veggies or they will be too mushy. We ate it as a main course, but it would be excellent alongside chicken or fish.

this salad is delicious! you can use whatever fresh herbs you have around. I will make this many times again.

Loved this. Delicioius. Grilled the zuccini in a grill pan on the stove and put the peppers in the broiler to char the outside. Worked great. Used whole wheat pita and made it into a pita sandwich, which also works great. Will make this over and over again.

I used whole wheat pita for grilled bread and used the oven gaz broiler instead of a grill. The bread does not stay crisp long in the salad. It would be better to serve the bread on the side given that the contrast of textures is important in this dish.

Oh my MMMMMM This was delicious. I had to fight my husband for the leftovers and he doesn't like "salads". The leftovers were awesome also. I had a little trouble with the toasted pita bread being sliceable and it ended up more like croutons.

This was very good. I could not find Sumac so it was not added. I used eggplant in place of 1 zucchini and got a wonderful result. I've made it to times to great reviews.

This was really good. Also skipped the sumac. Served with grilled lamb chops marinated in lemon, olive oil, garlic & cumin. Great summer night dish.

Terrific. Have made several variations, all good. Used gnarly croutons (from a whole wheat demi miche) and frozen chopped cilantro in a pinch. Still great. Used a mix of grilled eggplant & globe zuccini (Ronde de Nice) and it was perfect.

I made this salad for a dinner party and everyone loved it! The fresh, colorful veggies and grilled pita taste perfect with the lemon-cumin dressing. This goes especially well with the feta burgers on this site.

This recipe is out of this world! I made it with capers instead of olives and added grilled tuna--it was a perfect dinner, especially on Friday night! Goes well with white wine. Held up well next day (took the bread out) and put remainder in a pita for lunch--great!

All the favors just mixed so well. Made just has written, (with whole wheat pita breads) except for adding the sumac (didn't look for). Served with grilled Tuscan steak. A wonderful summer meal. The next day it was just as tasty.

Great 4th of July side dish with grilled sausage & pineapple. Substituted parsley for the cilantro & the next time will try thicker pita. Great the next day! Delicious.

Absolutely delicious! I've made it three times so far.

This was fantastically tasty. The crunchy raw vegetables and toasted pita; the soft, smoky roasted veggies; and the tangy lemon and salty feta and olives were an amazing combination. I don't care for cilantro and substituted flat-leaf parsley, and that was just right for my taste. I also cut down the cumin a bit, but that's just me. I would love to try to find sumac for one of the many times I'm sure to make this again.

delicious. we used a little less cheese (and the cheese we used was low fat). Also threw in some spicy arugula from our CSA.

by the way, didn't find the ground sumac (but didn't look very hard either). The fresh cilantro, mint, cumin & lemon juice was plenty flavorful.

I love panzanella salads and this was a great twist! The smokiness of the grilled veggies with the crunchiness of the fresh veggies and the delicious vinaigrette were so good together. We had this as a nice light main dish salad on a warm summer night in San Diego! I will definitely make it again and again.
