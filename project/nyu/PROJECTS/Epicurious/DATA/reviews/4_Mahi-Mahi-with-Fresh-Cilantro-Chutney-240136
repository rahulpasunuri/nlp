something went wrong here. I follow the recipe exactly. I used mahi from tjs and it came out so dried, it was inedible! Chutney has potential, but not out of this world. I will not make this again, ever!

Excellent flavor balance. We doubled the chutney proportions, even though it was only 2 servings, I liked having plenty of chutney. I also added one micro scoop of Stevia. This will be a new staple fish dish for us.

I substituted some olive oil for the coconut milk because I didn't want to open a whole can and Sriracha hot sauce for the jalepeno since I didn't have one. It was still excellent. My husband complained that I didn't make more!

Very good, especially given the short amount of time it takes to prepare. As another reviewer, I used frozen Mahi Mahi from Trader Joe's. I added some chopped mango to the chutney *after* it was coursely chopped in the food processor and also added a bit of maple syrup since I like it a little sweeter. Was excellent!

This was terrific! I used frozen mahi mahi chunks from Trader Joe's and took to heart the recipe's instructions for a coarse blending of the chutney. I used a small "chopper/grinder" (Cuisinart) instead of my regular blender. This made for a chutney with lots of body--and less blender cleaning!

The method of cooking the fish was fine and the cumin was a tasty addition to the usual salt and lemon pepper, but I was not impressed by the chutney. I made this because I had lots of cilantro left over, but it was too sharp, not enough body. I was disappointed since it got so many good reviews.

This was delicious and the minimal ingredients made for a super fast dinner. I substituted mango for the kiwi, used an entire jalapeno, two cloves of garlic, and sauteed the fillets in butter. My husband rated this a "restaurant quality" meal which I think says it all. Will definitely make again.

Very good, and very simple! It was so healthy and light that it was a perfect meal for a hot Texas summer! This dish will definitely make it into the rotation more often!

Could it be any easier and taste so good! Loved the combination of flavors and it goes so well with the delicate Mahi Mahi. Used leftover chutney for spiced rubbed pork loin chops! Yummy. Gotta have the Kiwi!

Easy and good. I didn't have a kiwi and squeezed some lime in, but came out great. I might try w/ yogurt next time to reduce the calories.

Yummy and simple. Kids loved it. Served over whole wheat couscous mixed with a little mango salsa

We really enjoyed this one. My son took some to work the next day because he wasn't with us for dinner. He texted me and ask what the sauce was. When I asked why, he said it was awesome. This from someone who rarely eats white fish, but loves cilantro and jalapeno. Made it the first time as recipe was, second time added lime juice to the chutney and a whole jalapeno.

Chutney seems like a very apt name for it. I decided to make it because I had a lot of leftover cilantro from another dinner that called for 4 sprigs. Have that ever happened to you before? You know, you buy a bunch of cilantro and never use it all? Not this time. I used it all for chutney and cilantro rice. It was great! Definitely a keeper.

Amazingly delicious! With a surfeit of cilantro to use up, I tried this quirky recipe.. I made it exactly as listd but with Tilapia. It is great! A snap to make, with a fantastic fresh taste. Who would have thought these ingredients would go together SO well?! I will definitely make this again!

I made this with fresh tilapia instead and it turned out great! I followed the recipe almost exactly but added green chillies for a kick and more cilantro than the recipe called for since I love it. Result was terrific!

Delish!!! I changed it a little because the kiwi didn't ripe on time. I used half a pear instead. Also, since the cilantro has a secondary effect at night, I mixed it with 50% of spinach. Otherwise, I followed the recipe and we all loved it. Super easy, fresh and tasty.

Very tasty on any kind of fish. Definitely a keeper.

Loved this. Made just as written. Very unusual but vibrant flavor.

Amazing and strange at the same time. My chutney came out a little runny, but still tasted great and hubby loved it. Will definitely make it again!

Great use of extra cilantro. The sweetness of the kiwi and coconut played well against the spiciness of the jalepeno (I used the whole pepper). A very fresh taste that would work well with shrimp too.

I thought the Cilantro was so overpowering that I could not even taste the flavor of the fresh fish. I honestly dont think I would ever make this recipie again

Incredibly easy!! This tasted very fresh. Putting a kiwi inthere sort of threw me off in the beginning but in the end no one could really taste the kiwiw

I followed the chutney recipe exactly, but substituted grilled tuna steaks for the mahi mahi. My husband and even kids (ages 3 and 5) liked it. It was very easy to make and will definitely be added into our rotation! I served it with cous cous, grilled marinated red and yellow peppers and a green salad---simple, but delicious!

This was delishious. I used two kiwis instead of one after reading other reviewers' comments.

Made this for a light, in between the holidays meal for my boyfriend, substituting tilapia for the mahi-mahi. The chutney as is had just the right amount of sweetness and spice. Served with brown basmati rice with scallions and herbs.

I made this recipe for my family of five plus my in-laws... and mainly because I ran out of steam cleaning the cilantro I cut the amount in 1/2. This actually worked out great for the chutney; all flavors were still clearly detectable and not too overpowering with the fish. I served it with rice pilaf and a garden salad with balsamico vinaigrette and rosted pine nuts.

While most college students are happy with 4 minute ramen, I can only stand the stuff once every few months. I come to this site pretty often and find recipes like this that are quick and easy, and are almost always delicious. This is a perfect example: I cooked this in about 10 minutes, and it was 10x better than any easy mac. I just tossed in a whole jalepeno, making it perhaps a little too strong, but that was easily fixed by sprinkling in just a pinch of sugar. I kept my extra chutney and used it on some chicken in a wrap the next day, which was perhaps even better.

This recipe was good -- not fantastic. Maybe my kiwi wasn't sweet enough, but it seemed like the cilantro swallowed the flavor of everything else. Next time I might try an herb mixture. I served a salad full of garden tomatoes with soy-mustard- ginger vinaigrette. It was a nice contrast. Either way, I prefer the pumpkin-seed encrusted fish on this site, or the salmon with chili-mango salsa. This is easier than both of those, though, and makes a quick "real" dinner for a weeknight.
