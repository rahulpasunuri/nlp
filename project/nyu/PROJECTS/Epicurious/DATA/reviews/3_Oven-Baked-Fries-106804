These were easy to make and very good! I cut the potatoes lengthwise into quarters then cut each quarter lengthwise into three wedges. I lined the pan with parchment paper which prevented sticking and made clean-up really easy. I checked out the recipe suggested by the cook from knoxville and it sounded interesting but took way too much time. First you had to boil the potatoes then bake for an hour and a half! There were a lot of other interesting looking recipes on that site, however.

Easy, and not bad. I think that cutting the wedges thinner would result in a crispier texture, and it's worth trying again like that. Not at all greasy. Do oil the pan.

Surprisingly good and so easy. Stuck a little too much. Next time I will add seasoning salt and brush the bottom of the pan with oil.
