Absolutely delicious! I followed another reviewer's advice and used grated walnuts instead of bread crumbs - a really pleasant substitution. These are time consuming to make, especially if you do all of the components the same day (like I did), but they are great to have stored away in the freezer for whenever you want a delicious dessert in 13 minutes.

these are absolutely incredible. i have never made anything that tasted this good. just cook the apples down longer than recommended.

A great recipe. Really easy. I loved how you could freeze the filling and make them as you need them. I will definitely make them again.

These tasted amazing. I thought the ice-cube idea was good but chose to use a muffin tray so I could use more filling per turnover. (Actually, the sauce is too reduced to freeze completely) I didn't bother with the breadcrumbs, which made no difference as far as I could see. Also I used Granny Smith and Golden Delicious, which was all I could find in June. I'd certainly make this again (when I have 4 hours or so to devote to the making!) The freezing option allows you to divide, however, the assembly across a few days.

I didn't freeze the filling. If sufficiently thickened they can be made immediately. I brushed the triangles with butter and sprinkled coarse sugar on top. Lovely dessert, with or without the ice cream!

This had great flavor. It was just so time consuming, not as big a pay off in the end as I'd hoped. My sauce never thickened after cooking double the time. I just ladeled out the apple mixture so it wouldnt be too runny. I also think there was not enough filling, only 2 bites in the center and the ends were just dough.

great recipe! i made a couple of slight variations...added fresh nutmeg to the apple mixture and less molasses. i feel too much molasses overpowers the flavor of the apples. also added a drop of cornstarch to the sauce to help thicken and sprinkled the tops of the turnovers with cinnamon sugar. just a note about adding water to the brown butter...if you add the sugar first, then the water, no worries about hot butter splashing you or your stove. great september dessert!

These are pretty tasty indeed! One thing of note is that hot butter + water = FOOOOOOOOOOOSH. Let the browned butter cool down a bit before adding the water. The frozen apple cube is definitely a good idea (no more trying to roll up hot oozy apple filling), though my apples never froze solid so much as got colder and more cube-shaped. But that was sufficient to help me assemble, and it was actually useful to be able to squash the cubes into shape as I was rolling them up. The white pepper adds a tiny bit of heat as more of a background note; I liked it. One thing I noticed on the finished, baked product is the breadcrumbs tended to darken between the layers of phyllo, which is somewhat unattractive. The crumbs are supposed to be there to keep the layers from sticking, though. Still, I might try this again without them, or with something else between the layers, or maybe process the crumbs again after toasting them to make them finer. The last minor issue was the brand of phyllo dough I used tasted somewhat savory (salty) in places that didn't have any apple in them. Next time I might try wrapping the apples tighter and sprinkling the finished turnover with a bit of sugar. Overall, thumbs up! Definitely something I wouldn't mind playing with again.

This is absolutely fabulous. I made them ahead of time and froze them to serve with Christmas brunch. I did have a difficult time getting the sauce to thicken. Ultimately I had to remove the apples and then continue to simmer the sauce. It took a lot longer than what the recipe indicated. I didn't have ice cube trays, so I used the plastic egg trays sprayed with cooking spray. You should plan on the better part of an afternoon to make these, but they are absolutely worth it.

I really liked these turnovers but I did not get enough apple mixture to fill 2 14 cube trays. I also thought that the turnovers would benefit from having more apple fillng. It seemed a little skimpy. That being said, they are tasty and were a big hit when I served them.

Used chopped walnuts instead of breadcrumbs on one layer of the phyllo. Only one thing to say . . . magnifique!

This is a very time consuming recipe but well worth the effort it takes to make it.

I liked this recipe because I did it in completely separate steps, spaced over three months. In October I made the apple filling and froze it in ice cubes. I used Cortland apples. After a few weeks I removed the frozen apple cubes and put them in a freezer container. Then in November I did the phyllo thing, this was the most labor intensive, and one needs quite a bit of freezer space to keep placing the completed turnovers on a cookie tray and then transferring into a storage container. I also used Japanese panko bread crumbs instead of the home made crumbs. The baking was the easiest thing, I used parchment paper to minimize clean up, and they were enjoyed by all.

This recipe sounds good. Freezing the apple mixture is a nice touch. It saves time filling the turnovers as none seeps out while closing the pastry.I live in Holland and can't buy molasses. Has anyone tried these with Maple syrup or The English Golden Syrup? My review is based on my experience as a cook. I haven't tried the recipe yet.

These are delicious! I've made similar strudels for years, and I like the addition of the pepper(I used white pepper). To the cook from San Francisco: When the first 14 sheets are cut in half, one half is placed on top of the other for 28 half sheets. Since two half sheets are used for each turnover, you still need the remaining 14 sheets for the other 14 filling cubes. I hope this helps. You can add walnuts, raisins or other dried fruit. I like the addition of Calvados and a touch of nutmeg. I hope this helps. Let us know how they turn out.

In response to the microwave question: i tried it and the turnover wasn't nearly as good and the crust turned sort of chewy and tough instead of crispy and flaky. I would recommend heating them up in the oven.

I may be mis-reading this recipe. Does this recipe really need 28 (not 14) phyllo sheets? Since the first 14 sheets are already cut lengthwise into 2 stacks already, and only 2 'strips' are used per turnover - you don't need the 2nd set of 14 sheets do you?!!! Please help.

If you don't plan to serve the turnover right away can you heat in the microwave w/o ruining it?

I feel similarly: what political comments? Do you mean editorial comments? Anyway, excellent turnovers. I'm sure you could add raisins, if that appeals to you, tastewise and texturally.

Wonderful!!! Not too difficult for us po'r home cooks. But of course I also make my own pizza dough, tortillas, cinnamon rolls, broths, among others. I will make it again.

I make a strudel from scratch that is with a dough that is stretched till you see the tablecloth below. Pepper is an option, I don't use. Basically, the sugar you choose is up to you as are the addition of any dried fruit or chopped nuts. Personally,I like cinnamon and nutmeg as seasoning. However, intially I'd follow whatever is written. White pepper is milder than black and wouldn't be seen and probably acts as some kind of balance to the molasses.

I've never made apple strudel before and was surprised to see that there is pepper in it. It sounds like a lot of work but will give it a try. Do you think for a variety you could add some golden raisins to the mix?

To the cook from Florida, yes, you cook turnovers from frozen. Have'nt done these yet, they sound good.

Fantastic !!!!!! Loved it. Served it at a party and it was a hit, Freezing it in advance made prep time so much easier..and YES you do bake it frozen. Able to bake it so it was served warm from the oven.

If I've understood your question correctly, freezing the apple filling (and keeping it frozen before baking) is quite ingenious. In order to keep the filling from leaking out of the pastry, you need to have your pastry cook and seal before the apple mixture inside becomes liquidy. Keeping your apple filling frozen does this. Of course, once baked, the apple filling will cool and thicken slightly ... but the sealed pastry will contain it nicely. Also great to know that this can be made in advance and frozen. It's somewhat labour intensive ... and better to do the labour when you have the time. :)

I didn't rate because I didn't make it yet. Pardon me all you gourmet cooks, I may seem totally obtuse, but are we supposed to cook these from frozen or thawed? If thawed, why go to the bother of re-freezing after making rolling the filling up in the dough? Please don't ask me to look at recipes elsewhere since I am not an expert cook like so many reviewers think they are! And, please I am asking a serious question, please, someone, answer it and don't just insult me. Thanks in advance
