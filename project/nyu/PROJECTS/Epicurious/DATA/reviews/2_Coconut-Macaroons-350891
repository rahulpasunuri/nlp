These turned out really well and were well-received at my family's Christmas gathering. Although while baking some expelled some excess liquid, they were great! (but messy with chocolate drizzling)

I agree with the previous review. I was expecting more taste, but if you're looking for a healthy alternative to the standard macaroon recipe you might try it.

i really didnt have any success with this recipe....it wasn't tasty at all....needs more sugar and flavor. I will stick with my other recipe for macaroons I would never try this recipe again
