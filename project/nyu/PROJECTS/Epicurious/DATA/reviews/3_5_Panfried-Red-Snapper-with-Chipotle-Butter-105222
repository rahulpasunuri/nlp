I followed recipe exactly and thought it was too heavy between the frying of fish and adding butter afterwards. I should have known better after reading the recipe!

Sometimes simple is the best! I just used flour as in the recipe and although I love panko I think that that this is the way to go for for this one. Served it with some green bean fries that I did on the grill along with some new red potatoes (also on the grill after I'd gotten them started in the microwave) and marinated cucumbers. A great July dinner!!

Quick, easy, and soooo delicious! I consider myself only slightly above novice on the cooking scale, but I made this with no problems and even impressed my boyfriend who's an amazing cook! The only thing I altered was that I added breadcrumbs to the flour (about half and half) for the breading to add a little more substance. Served with Cuban-style black beans, saffron rice, and an avocado/butter lettuce salad with a cilantro-lime vinaigrette. Plan on putting it in my dinner rotation for sure.

great easy meal. I had some doubts, but the chipotle-butter mixture melted overtop, and it was delicious. Next time I will try it with an egg-white wash, then add some panko to add more texture.

So simple...and so perfect. A friend in the seafood industry called me up with a great deal on red snapper...(in a rush) I found this simple recipe and couldn't have been more pleased with the results. Simplicity at it's finest.

Delicious, though the barley pecan salad was half of what made it great. There was a little too much butter (rarely an issue) but I suspect it would do well on steak.

I made it just as suggested and added a little bit of breadcrumbs to the flour. My husband loved it! We didn't think the chipotle butter was overpowering at all. Very good for the weekly rotation!

This dish was incredibly good. A definite keeper. I followed other reviewers' suggestion and served this dish with yellow rice and black beans - Mexican style. Excellent recipe.

I had never cooked with chipotle peppers in adobo sauce before, and was surprised at the strong barbeque smell and flavor. I agree with a previous reviewer that the chipotle butter did not complement the fish at all. I usually enjoy most recipes from Epicurious, but not this one.

This was quick & simple, but nothing exceptional.

This was simple and easy - instead of just flour dredge I used ground up blue tortilla chips with flour (needed an egg wash to hold it on) but was excellent on Lake Erie walleye!

Absolutely wonderful and so simple to make. We did use substitute butter (watching our cholesterol) and it was still fantastic. We probably used more chipotle than it called for, but we love spicy food. Served it with brown rice with lentils and veggies. We will definitely be making this again!

I think the chipotle butter would be very good on just about any kind of white fish; it's also good on broccoli. My red snapper fillets were skinless, I don't think it matters one way or the other. Adding the chopped chipotles and adobe sauce very gradually to the softened butter is the best idea. Otherwise you may get a very hot and unwanted surprise! I freeze the remainder of the can of chilies in adobe in a small freezer bag and break off pieces as I need them.

Red snapper is now one of my favorite fishes since trying this recipe. Definately going to make this again & again........

I used trout instead of snapper, and it was just as good (and easy) as the other reviewers said. Yum.

WOW - This is amazingly easy to make and absolutely delicious! Definitely a keeper!

I agree with other reviewers - excellent as is. And so simple! Am making for a dinner party - serving with soft cheesy polenta and a cilantro / lime coleslaw. A tip: you can freeze the leftover chipotles in their sauce - put one each with some sauce per icecube tray section.

This is an amazing dish!!! My husband dislikes seafood, and requests this dish periodically. Following the recipe as written makes for a good dish, but adding the panko (Japanese breadcrumbs) to the flour mixture provides a nice addition to the divine texture of the fish. Really great and subtle taste!

This is phenominal - absolutely - as is - would not change a thing. It is important that the skillet be nice and hot before adding the fish so as to achieve a nice brown/crisp texture. Also - the butter is very flavorful so be careful not use too large a dollop - I spread a light coating over first then a real small dollop on top. It is outstanding and so incredibly easy.

Yes yes yes. Wonderful just as it's written.

So simple, so quick, so good!!! I used tilapia instead and was very pleased. I have another recipe I use the chipotle peppers in (Short ribs) and now have something else to make with those leftover chipotle peppers. Thanks for another great recipe!

I always add ground cumin when using chipotles in adobo sauce, keeping chipotle mayonnaise on hand. Now I will be keeping chipotle butter on hand too! I used ruby trout with this. This recipe is quick and easy and delicious.

This was fabulous! I also added bread crumbs to the flour, which gave it a better crust. I added brocolli with the left over buttered, which added a great zing.

My husband is not a fish lover, but tell him your making red snapper with chipotle butter, and he'll eat it every week! He puts the extra butter on his vegatables as well. It's so simple to make, I have added it to my regular weeknight bag of tricks.

Easy and really good! Great week night meal. I used the 1/2 T chipotle and 2t sauce and it was just right for us. It still let the flavor of the fish come through. I served it with the rice with green chiles & green onions from this web-site. Wouldn't change a thing in the recipe. Although...I may try grilling the snapper next time and brushing it with the butter and serving it with grilled veggies.

I made this last night and it was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly - except that I added some breadcrumbs to the flour, as other reviewers suggested. The husband loved it and said it was now one of his favorites. I served it with new (red) potatoes - steamed. The butter worked exceptionally well with the potatoes - yum! This recipe is a keeper for sure. Fast, easy, inexpensive and delicious!

Simple yet delicious. Chipotle chiles are great to use for adding instant flavor and heat. I use them in a variety of dishes, this one will be added to that list.

Wonderful recipe - very easy to make but truly delicious! Living on the Gulf Coast, we love snapper, but this is one of our all-time favorite recipes already. We added breadcrumbs to the flour, too, and it gave the filets a nicely textured crust. We served this dish with the Mexican green rice recipe from James McNair's Rice Cookbook - it was a perfect accompaniment to the snapper.

Wow! Following the suggestion on breadcrumbs, we dragged the fillets through some crunchy Japanese breadcrumbs, and the result was amazing: the soft texture of the snapper, the crunch, and lets not forget the spice, building slowly with every bite.

Sustituted Habanero for chilpotle and doubled the recipe...use half of mixture( save the rest for tomorrow)

I SERVED THIS WITH YELLOW RICE, RE-FRIED BEANS AND A LITTLE SOUR CREAM AND IT WAS EXCELLENT! I USED THE LEFTOVER CHIPOTLE BUTTER ON BAKED POTATOES THE NEXT NIGHT... VERY CONVENIENT

We really liked this. I used rockfish (Pacific snapper) without the skin because that was what the market had when I shopped, and it was just great. New red potatoes on the side soaked up the chipotle butter very nicely!

This recipe was wonderful. I also added Vigo italian style breadcrumbs to the flour, and then dredged the fish in that mixture. I spread the chipotle butter across the fish, and it added a fantastic flavor. I have to admit, I was a bit hesitant about this recipe at first, but now I cannot wait to make it again!!!!!!!!

This was a winner in my home even among the hesitant fish eaters. I didn't use all the chipotle butter and it was still quite delicious. Will definitely make it again.

this fish is much improved by removing the skin, brushing both sides liberally with the butter, and panfrying directly (forgo the flour). spicy and nice!

We did not like this at all!! The chipotle butter had a very strong taste and did nothing to compliment the flavor of the fish. I had a lot of butter left over, and it went straight to the garbage. I would NOT make this again!
