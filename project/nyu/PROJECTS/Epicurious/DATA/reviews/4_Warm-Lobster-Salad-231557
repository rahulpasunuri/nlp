My husband and I rated this recipe as one of the best things we ever ate. I made this last year for our dinner-for-two we always have on Christmas Eve and it was delicious. It is indeed time intensive, as you have to make the stock to make the vinaigrette, but very much worth it. I am making this again this year!

I agree with here2help that this is an involved recipe, but the concept and flavors work well. I skipped the elegant presentation since I didn't have time and couldn't get fresh lobster (October+Texas="tank flavor"). I used frozen pieces and fish stock from our local fish monger instead. The vinaigrette/stock sauce was a little strong by itself, but added missing flavor to the defrosted and warmed lobster meat. I paired it with Graham Beck Brut and they were complementary. Planning ahead, I will make it again, but most likely using crab meat instead since that's regionally available.

This recipe is not nearly as easy as it looks because the lobster stock is another recipe. But it is definitely worth it. I just poached the lobster - I think it's the most humane way to kill them, and nothing is gained by the skewers and plastic wrap (do you really want to eat lobster that's been boiled in kitchen wrap?). Then I used the poaching liquor in the stock. You cut the lobster tail into coins, so what does it matter if they curl? I recommend saving the extra lobster stock for risotto.
