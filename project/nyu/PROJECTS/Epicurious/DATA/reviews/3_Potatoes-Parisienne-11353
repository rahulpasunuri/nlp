The potatoes were very good. They didn't reheat well. It was really wasteful, between clarifying the butter and using a melon baller. I might make them again sometime. I would probably dice the potatoes.

I made this when the recipe first came out in '92. It was part of a Valentine's Day menu with crown roast of lamb. It was one of the best meals I've ever made - and I'm now a caterer! I'm making it again tonight for Christmas Eve. Follow the recipe and you will love these!

Definately something wrong with how long to cook these potatoes. I used store bought parisienne potatoes. I cooked them for 25 minutes and they were still raw. I even cooked them in the microwave for 7 seven minutes. Needless to say they didn't make it to the table for our dinner party. Next time, I will microwave these first for a good while and then cook them in the pan.
