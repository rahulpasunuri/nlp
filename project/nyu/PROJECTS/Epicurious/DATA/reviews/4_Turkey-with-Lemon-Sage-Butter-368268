For a comparably easy recipe, this one packs in the flavor. The turkey was absolutely delicious and moist. I would make it again in a heartbeat.

Easy and delicious. The meat becomes suffused with a hint of lemon and sage and the breast is not overcooked. I lowered the temp 25 degrees and cooked our 12 pounder 45 min. longer since our turkey was stuffed (used lots of fresh sage in the stuffing as well). The only problem encountered was that the skin over the breast was torn when I flipped the turkey, so that could have been problematic if I had wanted to present the turkey whole. But we carve the turkey before bringing to the table, so it didn't matter. You could put foil under the turkey initially to avoid this potential problem. Also, I put foil over the breast during the last hour of cooking because it was browning fast. I agree with the first poster--after brining, smoking and many other roasting techniques, this is my absolute favorite roast turkey recipe.

A wonderful classic turkey! This year we were looking for the easy way to go. We have brined, smoked etc we have tried everything but fried. Since my husband had his hip replaced two weeks before the big day we needed to find a simple and easy recipe. This little gem was tucked away in the back of the November 2011 issue. Our turkey was 21 lbs (great left overs) doubled the butter mixture used sweet spanish paprika that added a slight smoked flavor.The bird cooked and presented beautifully. Of course the quality of the turkey is key. Ours was fresh and raised by from local farmer. Served with Rustic Herb Stuffing(bon appetit Nov '10). Thankful the turkey was moist/delicious and no hip pain!
