I thought this was really good given how super easy it was, which is why I'm giving it four forks. I used real whitefish, which I'd never had before, and I really liked the texture. Like the other reviewer, I did not have to finish it in the oven. My fillet was thin, so it only took about 6-8 mins total.

I love the remoulade sauce. I think the crust is great. I think in the future I'll use them separately. One or the other should be the dominant feature. I think the remoulade overpowered crust's flavors. I did not need to put the fish in the oven to finish the cooking; it was done after about 7 minutes in the pan. I used whitefish, one of my favorites.

i read all of the reviews for this & was skeptical because of all the negative reviews. i've always wanted to try this & finally just gathered the ingredients & made it. i decided to add 2 eggs to help the coating bind better (that was a complaint from a reviewer). it stayed on just fine. i also cooked the whitefish at 400 (because a reviewer recommended that) and that was a good idea. i used VERY fresh local whitefish. i think part of the problem other reviewers had was because no one used whitefish & it is very different from other fish. but i live by the lake, so i'm lucky. i also used the finest grain mustard i could find. as far as the remoulade, SO WHAT if there is too much? i just used it to dip in. i'm glad i have leftovers because remoulade can be used on sandwiches or as a dip for something else. even diluted into a sauce. hearty & delicious-i will DEFINITELY make this again. only with fresh whitefish.

This dish did not work all around. The breading did not want to stay put, the fish did not take on a good consistency and the flavors were overpowering. While I will concede that I used fish I had frozen, this still is not a recipe I will use again.

I found the breading and the remoulade too overpowering, hiding the delicate flavors of the fish. This is not a recipe I'll use again.

Way too much remoulade, but it was great with crab cakes later in the week.

Wow, this was excellent. I used cod and baked as past reviews suggested on 450 for 10-15 min. I am also a mayo hater - when ever a recipe calls for mayo I substitute it with an avocado +1/4 cup milk blended until the consistency of mayo. I followed the rest to a tee and was blown away by the taste.

Thanks to the reviewer who suggested baking the fish. I used tilapia and baked at 400 for about 15 minutes. Topping was crunchy, fish moist. The topping has a lot of flavor, the rémoulade would be overkill imo.

Recipe yields far too much remoulade, as one reviewer notes. Another remarks that she used flounder, as I did, and it falls apart too easily. Yeah, I basically ended up serving fish casserole instead of fish fillets. So I agree with both those reviews. Also, the horseradish was a bit much, and in the future, I'll use less. Still, my family loved it, despite my own culinary failings: the fish was delicious, and it had a pretty color and texture. I served it with a helping of 90-second steamed veggies and instant Cajun rice. Fast, simple, tasty, and filling! I'll make it again.

This recipe didn't work for me, but I'm willing to concede user error. I used flounder (we don't get whitefish and I thought it would make a good substitute). It completely disintegrated in the pan. All I could think was, "why didn't I just bake this?!" I also had my suspicions about the nonstick pan, so would love to hear how it worked for others using a delicate fish. Maybe I'll try the cod, as others suggested.

Cod is a better selection for the width of the fillet holds up better. Alternative way to just put the fillet in the oven @ 450 for 10 minutes.

This was excellent and not difficult to make. I used cod, which held up well in the pan. This makes a huge amount of the remoulade, so you might consider cutting it in half, as the sauce goes a long way.
