While I didn't have a problem with dryness (taking a cue from other raters, I carefully monitered baking time from the 30 minute mark), I found this cake to be very boring. Chocolate and cinnamon can be wonderful together, but not here.

Like another reviewer I made this cake twice and both times found it to be very dry. The flavor is good but as one reviewer said even a day later the dryness is worse. Too bad

This is my fourteen-year-old son's favorite cake. I know, I couldn't believe it either. Very rich. Nice presentation. Good for gatherings.

When i made this recipe i found the cake to be quite dry on the inside. The glaze made up for the dryness however because it brought the whole cake together. It was a perfect balance of cinnamon and chocolate and was a semi big hit at a party.

This cake has a unique and really delicious flavor. However, both times I've made it, it came out a bit dry. By three days after baking, it's almost inedible because of the dryness. I think next time, I'm going to try adding some moisture via extra oil or something. The chocolate glaze is FANTASTIC.

Excellent! I have made this several times and each time it was a big hit! Make sure to use whole milk though-I tried it with skim once and it was way too dry. I will definitely make this again!

i'm no cake expert, but i took this to a small dinner party and it went over 'blah' - my husband said it reminded him of playdough and the hostess even sent me home with ALL of the leftovers. it was dense, dry and the cinnamon, while tasty was almost too overwhelming. i even followed the previous reviewer and made sure i used cake flour. it has been banned from my recipe book.

Very nice! It was very dense, however, because I didn't use cake flour -- next time, I will make sure I do. I took this to school and those students who had a piece LOVED it!

Made this cake for a co-workers birthday. The whole office enjoyed it and polished it off in minutes.

This cake was a big hit when I brought it in to work. I let them think I spent a long time making it when it really was very easy to make. This is great to make to go places. It travels well and will stay for days.

I have made this a few times - it has an excellent flavor, and the texture is wonderful. I have a sweet tooth, so I make a little extra glaze. One time when I made it, I over-beat the eggs, and the cake came out a little dry...it still tasted good, but it lost the great texture.

This cake received rave reviews every time I made it! The cinnamon and chocolate together make for a very satisfying dessert. The glaze comes out fine made with milk instead of cream.

the cinnamon adds a nice taste to this cake, it goes well with the chocolate swirl. It makes a large cake and the baking time was a little longer in my oven. The glaze is better with half the butter.
