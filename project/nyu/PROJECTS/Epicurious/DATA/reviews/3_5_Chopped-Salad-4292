I've been making this since 1997 and am often asked for the recipe. I make just a couple of adjustments, though. I add more arugula because I love it and I add either pinons or spiced pecans. Also love it with goat cheese as a change from the blue.

I could live on this. I'm a fan of bitter greens, though. It is true that the lemon peel brightens it, but I've made the same salad with a regular vinaigrette and found it delicious. And also that it needs a good, strong blue cheese. Genoa salami is a great idea; made with crumbled bacon, it's spectacular.

This has become one of my favorite dishes ever. I find it diving-I do think it is very important to use a high quality blue cheese--and I also add a good high quality chopped genoa salami. Delicious!

2 1/2 forks is more appropriate. We liked it but thought it was a little bland. I used Saga blue which is creamy and not as strong so that may be part of the reason. I will try it again because it is a good, mild & light side salad.

I love this salad. It is delicious. I have served it with chili, as a refreshing side dish. I have also enjoyed it at Rosa Pistola.

I served this tonight with garlic bread and an Italian pasta dish, we enjoyed it quite well. I didn't chop the greens, just tore them in the usual salad size pieces.Although I'm not fond of blue cheese, I thought it was quite good in this recipe. I wonder about the person who didn't like the dressing, if he/she grated the lemon peel. Without that, the dressing would have been bland.

I'm not sure what the problem was here, but I didn't like this salad at all. My husband would give it two forks however. The dressing basically tasted like oil, even after adding TONS of fresh lemon juice. And maybe my store didn't have the freshest ingredients. The radicchio (which I had never bought) tasted bitter.

We still frequently dine at Rose Pistola (11/00), even though this recipe is from 1997, it is still one of my favorite dishes when I visit the restaurant.

guests favorite salad...easy to eat...we pass the bleu cheese because some people really don't care for it or are lactose intolerant. the salad still shines.
