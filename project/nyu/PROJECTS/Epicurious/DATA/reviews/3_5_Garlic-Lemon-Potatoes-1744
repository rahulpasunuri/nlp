A disappointment :( and I made the recipe exactly as stated.

I've made this recipe twice and now it's on the top of my friend's and family's "wish list." I prefer to use either red or golden potatoes as a waxy textured potato seems to work really well.

I used small red potatoes cut in small wedges. Note to self: takes longer than 45 minuts to bake - closer to 1 1/2 hours! I ended up turning heat up to 400 after the first 50 minutes. The sauce was perfect...not to overpowering to the soft potato.

WOW-Yum-MmmMmm!!! Perfect with a garlic rubbed pork tenderloin. I have made this recipe twice and the second time I used baby reds with the skin on, which added some color and also garnished it with a sprinkling of fresh chopped parsley. I know this will be eaten many times in our home over the years. Happy Cooking!

I used the russet potatoes, but I will use red potatoes next time. I also added fresh chopped basil and parsley. Fast and easy to make.

Very Good! I also used olive oil and black pepper. This was the starch compliment to the Rosemary and Garlic Lamb Chops (awesome Epicurious recipe).

I agree that olive oil and black pepper are great choices for this recipe. I like to make it with baby red potatoes (using a vegetable peeler slice off a thin ring around the middle of the potato...just makes it look pretty). I usually add some chopped fresh herbs to the olive oil mixture. I've used parsley, basil, oregano and chives (separately) with great success. I also like to make it a few hours ahead of time and let the potatoes come to room temperature. It really lives up the flavors.

Very good and easy. Nice change to everyday potatoes. Very good with greek food. Smells sooo good when cooking.

I used olive oil instead of butter, and added a few grinds of black pepper..it was wonderful! Try it with spicy blackened catfish and some sauteed spinach...wonderful!
