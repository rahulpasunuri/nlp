The quality of lamb shank is important. Made it once with shanks that were tough and I was disappointed in the result. The tomato taste is very mild and really serves as mostly a broth to braise the shanks in. Very tender and very tasty. Will do again and again for special occasions.

The tomato taste did not go well with the lamb. There are better recipes out there

This was absolutely delicious. I've never done lamb shanks before and was happy to find that they are very easy to find at the grocery store. (I tried this just after New Year's so the meat counter was out of fresh but the frozen New Zealand lamb packages were there and each contain 3 shanks, which is an awkward number when the recipe serves 8.) I halved the recipe and it worked perfectly to proportion. Only changes I made was that I microwaved the lemon(s) for 30 seconds to increase the amount of juice they give up and I juiced them and zested the peel to add to the casserole, instead of throwing in lemon wedges. Then I regretted the lack of pulp so I dug the seeds out of the pulp at the top of the juicer and threw it in too. I also added diced onion at #3. step of the recipe just because I figure onions make everything even better. My cinnamon sticks were kind of old and not as flavourful as fresh so I decided to put in a dash of ground cinnamon too but then opted to put in a dash of allspice instead. You could go either way. Very aromatic and the house smelled wonderful for 2 days. Other than that followed the recipe completely, refrigerated overnight and reheated gently on stovetop. The meat was beautifully tender and the sauce was rich and full of flavour. Will make it again for sure.
