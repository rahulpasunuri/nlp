Excellent and very tasty. I used a light homemade chicken broth instead of water. My family loved it - it's been an instant favorite.

This was good--I made it with the hazelnut pesto, which really enhanced the flavor. I felt it was really heavy, though (I didn't even use the cream). If you're looking for a lighter parsnip soup, check out the parsnip bisque from Gourmet, December 1999.

Bland, bland, bland...I was very disappointed. The pesto was great, but the soup lacked flavor. Don't waste your time.

Really great! Loved it. I too was a little concerned over the color, so I added tumeric (no flavor, and supposedly an altzheimers preventative...true or not, I dont know, but I add it to everything just in case...) and it was beautiful.

Incredible. What a wonderful dish to feed guests. They wanted it for dessert. The hazelnut pesto is perfect. Great recipe.

This is one of my favorite soup recipes. Last week, all of the members of my book group (The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay is a great novel, by the way), brought a soup to share. This was the best! I cut back on the amt. of butter and completely omit the cream, but the pesto is a must. Yum!

I've made this soup several times. I agree that the hazelnut pesto really enhances the flavour of the soup. We've served this dish to company and received many compliments. As well, I've used the pesto sauce mixed with mayo for sandwiches which was very nice.

the soup flavor was quite good and we really enjoyed the pesto with it. the reason i couldn't rate it higher was the appearance of the soup--the color was really quite unattractive. we enjoyed it but i wouldn't make it for company for that reason. any ideas on fixing that?

A keeper. The basic soup is lovely -- but don't overlook the pesto accompaniment. I was sceptical of it, but it really brightens up the soup -- jazzing the texture and complementing the parsnip's sweetness.
