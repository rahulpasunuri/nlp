I cooked the ham hock covered in water first with a bay leaf until was tender and then removed it. Did the bacon and onion in a separate skillet. Measured the ham cooking liquid to the recipe amount and discarded the rest with the bay leaf. Added a peeled chopped carrot for color along with the shredded ham as the lentils cooked. The salad sat a day before serving. I added more dressing and garnished it with mixture of chopped red onion, parsley and addtional bacon. Our guests loved it.

I've made this several times, and I like it best without the ham hock. It's more salad, less a meat salad with just bacon.

I made this without the bacon, because I didn't have any on hand. I also used dried thyme. I wouldn't leave out the hamhocks; they added extra flavor to the salad. This is delicious, even straight out of the fridge the next day. This is a great one dish dinner for the summer. I think that it would also go over well at a potluck or dinner party as a side.

Lover this dish! I made it twice in the last two weeks! My boyfriend and I both gorged ourselves on it! I skipped the ham hog and cooked the lentils in chicken stock. I replaced red onion with minced shallots. I was also out of red wine vinegar so I used sherry vinegar instead. It was delicious! Like many other reviewers I suggest to use French green lentils. They hold their shape much better then other lentils. Other types of lentils turn out a little mushy. This dish is definitely will become my kitchen staple!

This was tasty and next time I may add a some feta or goat cheese. Did use the ham hock for the simmer but did not include the diced meat in the final dish and it was still very flavorful.

Utterly amazing--the epitome of soul food-comforting, filling and delicious. When I don't have hocks and bacon, I chop up left over ham and use that.

This was a really good side dish. I opted not to add the ham hock meat at the end. Ham hock meat adds great flavor, but doesn't look appealing. The walnut oil adds a complimentary dimension to the dish. Visually, the dish needs something else, something brightly colored. Finely diced red peppers might do the trick. P.S. Expect a longer cook time if you live at any elevation. At 6500', it took the lentils 45 minutes to tenderness.

Received a thumbs up from my husband, Will make again! Followed recipe as printed. Will use better quality ham hocks from a meat market, not from the grocery store.

wow! tried this tonight in a much diminished version (we had no ham, parsley or celery and i forgot to add the mustard) but it was fantastic! i can't wait to try it again with all the ingredients at hand!

I made this for a picnic later this evening, and have already eaten about 20% of it! I pretty much followed the recipe except I had no ham hock so used extra bacon and definitely the bacon fat. Added some chopped carrots for color & texture, and added the bacon last for crunch. Easy to adjust this for personal taste preference, as lentils are so forgiving and flavor absorbent! Definitely a keeper!

I just made it for dinner and it was amazing! I did as another reviewer suggested and left out the red onion. I am big on dressings, so after an initial taste test, I decided to add another 1/4 cup olive oil, 1/8 cup red wine vinegar, and added 2 tablespoons of mustard (it could've taken a bit more mustard...mustard fan!) You must try this recipe. It was reasonably quick and definitely one of the easiest recipes I've tried.

Perfection as is!

Wonderful! Despite the ham hock and bacon, this lentil salad was described by a guest as "light and airy." The red onion was inspired - just the right zip. I'm trying it tonight with ham shanks.

It's a perfect summer dinner! I didn't have the ham hock the second time, so I just used all bacon and some of the bacon fat in the dressing. For those who didn't like the soggy bacon, what I did was use a couple slices in the cooking, then added some crisp-fried before serving. It's also good with a bit of extra mustard in the dressing, too.

Thank you for printing this recipe! In the future, I'd make a bit less dressing, and definitely go easier on the mustard, but overall, YUM. Just like I remember from the Ambassade d'Auvergne.

I made this as a side dish for a dinner party and received excellent reviews. Very rich flavors-this would make a great main dish with a lettuce salad. My lentil tok a little longer than the recipe stated, about 15 minutes.

This recipe is wonderful and unusual! The smoked ham enhances and compliments all of the other ingresdients beyond beleif! It really is a meal in and of itself.

Definitely by far the best green lentil salad recipe I've tried (and I've tried several). Will make regularly. I do wonder, though. Bacon is rare in France - they use chunks called "lardons". I would like to know if this is what they actually used in Paris - lardon are easier to find and of better quality here.

Yum. This salad is great. The ingredients combine nicely to provide a cohesive, delicious dish. Very French! I am not a fan of raw onions, but I found the chopped red onion to be fine. I combined the ingredients about a half hour before serving. The lentils and ham were no longer hot, but were still warm. Perhaps the warmth and the time mellowed the raw onions.

I liked this very much and so did my company for lunch.

Of all the incredible food I ate in Paris, this first course at the Ambasse d'Auvergne was the dish I craved the most when I returned.I was thrilled to find the recipe in Bon Apptetit just a few weeks after I came home. Mine tasted similar, but not quite as good, as the restaurant's version. I'd leave out the red onions next time.
