awesome! it makes a lot of dressing. I added a pinch of sugar to the mix, otherwise, as written.

This was so good. How can it not be... there's bacon in it! Anyway, I used yogurt instead, otherwise followed the recipe. It was a great lunch with a slice of crusty bread.

Very good. A nice change up to our typical spinach salad recipes (we usually use a hot bacon dressing or poppyseed dressing). We use light sour cream which worked just fine.

We loved this recipe. Only change? A large, rather than a small garlic clove.

Very refreshing!! The lemon is the key! Makes plenty of dressing for more than the recipe called for - had left overs and ended up using on couscous! Fantastic!

This salad was tasty, but best I think as a side salad. A little too rich for me to have as a main dish. I used bacon drippings instead of olive oil to add more bacon flavor, but next time I will just use the oil to keep the flavor less intense. I will make this again.

Really didn't like this. The dressing was just too tart for our taste. Won't be making this again.

I really liked the dressing for this. I did warm up the dressing before putting it on, and added goat cheese crumbles and toasted pecans to the salad. YUM

I have been making this for over two years, it is always a success and almost always am asked for the recipe

This dressing is a nice change from the basic red wine vinegar and oil spinach salad dressing! Definitely will add this to the rotation!

Have made this several times in the last few weeks. Great salad and use of spinach.

Outstanding! We use only 1T of lemon juice and 3 of sour cream. Also, since my wife is on Atkins, I sub Splenda for sugar. All is Wicked Yummy, ya ya, I'm from New England!

This is a fabulous recipe! I have made it many times. It is the only spinach salad my son will eat. He loves it! The only thing I did differently was add croutons.

Excellent! Doubled the bacon, added chopped hard boiled eggs (4) and sliced fresh mushrooms (10oz) and it was a real hit!

I really enjoyed this recipe! Bacon didn't sound like enough, so I added green onions and mushrooms, and thought it was great. Try a similar recipe to the original adding ham and gruyere instead of bacon and parmesan, and add an apple for crunch. Now THAT is divine!

This was a simple salad with great flavor, paired it with the Pork tenderloin w/ gorgonzola recipe on this site!

I really enjoyed this. I made exactly as written and I don't think I'd change anything. Maybe use more bacon as my meat loving fiance did say he would like a bit more. Served this with Creamy Bean Soup With Leeks and it was a great meal!

This is great - I used a baby arugula mix instead of the spinach, and also used lite sour cream.

I always add cherry tomatoes and pine nuts to this salad and it is delicious. Also sometimes add steak to make it a meal in the summer.

I was very disappointed with this salad. I have had much better but thought we would give this one a try since it seemed so simple. I will keep searching for the best spinach salad.

I liked, but did not love, this recipe. My husband thought it was "very good". We both agreed I have better spinach salad recipes, so I probably wouldn't make it again.
