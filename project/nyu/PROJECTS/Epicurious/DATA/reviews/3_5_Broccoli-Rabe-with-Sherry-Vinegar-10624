Used an entire bunch of broccoli rabe, and 2 T. oil, not changeing the amount of sherry vinegar. Finished with sea salt and pepper. Even without garlic, this was excellent, warm and at room temperature.

Fresh rabe, plus vinegar. Tastes like an hour, but only takes 15 minutes.

Good combination of flavor. Very healthy, plus easy to prepare.
