Simply wonderful easy to make recipe with a great tasting sauce that would cost you plenty in a good dining establishment. I used panko.

I can't believe no one has reviewed this since 2005. I've made this so often - and we LOVE it. It is easy and tastes like it took forever. I use the panko breadcrumbs (wonderful texture) and with the mustard cream sauce the beer work fine (wine might be an alternative if you have some extra) Any extra breadcrumb mixture I refreigerate and use the next time. Try this - you won't be disappointed. Oh, and it is SUPER EASY!

This was really good, first time I've breaded pork tenderloin. The medallions were delicious and tender (of course) and the sauce was very good.

I wanted to make this dish with ingredients I had on hand. I used green cabbage instead of red, and some fresh cranberries. I enjoyed the cabbage side dish very much. It turned a lovely rosy pink color after the cranberries popped. I think the sweet/bitterness of the cranberries complemented the cabbage, probably more than raspberries would anyway. I also substituted the raspberry vinegar with apple cider vineger, and I recommend you julienne the apple slices for better consistency. Also, the mustard cream sauce was very tasty, but I would thicken a little with a beurre manie the next time.

Really yummy and SUPER easy!!! My family was tired of pork tenderloin in the more traditional fashion and this is a great alternative. My kids gobble it up, but it would be tasy enough for a gathering with friends!

This is a great dish. It is one of my favorites. The breadcrumbs are awesome. I often make more than enough and freeze them. I have made the sauce either way but I can't resist adding some garlic. Love it with Mashed Potatoes....yum!

Unbelievably delicious! Easy to prepare. My husband I ate every last morsel and wanted more. I served it with a butternut squash recipe.

Wonderful recipe! Based on the "loved it or hated it reviews" of the mustard sauce, I passed and made another mustard cream sauce from this web site that was wonderful. The other recipe is from Bon Appetit, June 1998, RSVP; Gouloff's, Jackson WY. In that recipe I substituted low-fat sour cream for the whipping cream as one rater had suggeste. In this recipe, since only serving two, I purchased two butterflyed porkchops, cut along the fold line and tenderized. Will make this again and again.

I made it with chicken instead, and thought it was delish! The sauce was yummy and I took the advice of others and used wine instead of beer. A great winter dish. I served with potato pancakes and would make again for sure!

I couldn't stand the smell of this. Gave it to the dog without even trying it and then ordered a pizza.

just so-so. I used 1/2 and 1/2 and thickened with cornstarch. Only had creamy dijon mustard. Maybe this is why is was just so-so, not good and bad.

Really enjoyed it, but with a few changes. Like many reviewers, I used white wine instead of the beer. Also strained the sauce of the shallots and thickened the sauce with 1 TSP of arrowroot dissolved in 1 TBS wine before I added the mustards. Worked like a charm, very velvety. For the pork, I used panko. Served the dish with rice, steamed asparagus and carmelized corn/shallots. Sauce worked with everything.

Wow! This was some schnitzel! I used panko breadcrumbs which made the medallions extra-crispy...YUMMY! Panko is also good to use if you're not making your own breadcrumbs from high quality (artisan) bread. It doesn't contain preservatives found in others. I think veal and chicken would also work in this recipe. My family loved it, especially accompanied by a hot bowl of lemon risotto (also on this Web site). The mustard sauce was also very good, but I think I didn't reduce it enough. I ended up having to add more mustard to beef it up a little. Will definitely make this again!

This dish was an instant winner. The aroma in the house when I was cooking it was almost better than the meal itself. I did find, however, that a sweet and sour sauce tasted even better with the pork than the mustard cream sauce (I made both). And the mustard cream sauce will last you for daaaaayys. This recipe is definitely one of my most memorable dishes.

I had to simmer the sauce longer, to get a good thickness. I will saute the shallots in butter first. After pouring sauce on meat, I will place the sauted shallots on top. Thus allowing you to whisk in the Dijon when added to sauce for a smoother sauce.

I usually do not give 4 forks, but this is one dish that deserves it. Fantastic. I followed the recipe exactly as written, and made the suggested red cabbage to go along with it. It was a beautiful dinner.

I would try using smaller pieces of pork. I pounded out one whole pork tenderloin and cut it in half and it was too big.

Spectacular! We're often looking for new and different recipes for pork tenderloin ...this one went way beyond expectatons. The pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg in the breadcrumbs give it a kinduv Middle Eastern flair. Those flavors combined with the mustard cream sauce were heavenly. This recipe is restaurant caliber.

The answer to the raspberry seeds is to use seedless raspberry all-fruit spread instead - about 2 tbs. We couldn't find raspberry vinegar so i smashed a pint and added red wine vinegar. Let it stand over night on the counter, then strain. Going to leave out the mustard seeds next time - just up the wet mustard a pinch. I loved the taste of the walnuts in the breading! The cabbage was wonderful. We used a boneless center cut pork roast instead of tenderloin. I recommend this to any one. It is a WOW dish.

A friend in my cooking club chose to make this for the group. It was a huge hit, even though we were a bit skeptical about the cinamon. The crust is incredible and the sauce, out of this world. It was so good, I have already made it for my family only 4 days after I first tried it. We used regular bread crumbs instead of fresh french bread breadcrumbs and it still turned out fantastic. My husband, who doesn't even like pork, loved it.

Liked the pork medallions, loved the mustard cream sauce.

Sauce does take longer to reduce(each step). Might consider making red cabbage a day ahead and let it absorb flavors. Would like to get rid of raspberry seeds from cabbage. Each part was very very tasty! My family raved and said they would like it again.

The timeframes for "reducing" the mustard cream sauce were inaccurate. It took much longer (maybe 2x as long) at each stage to reduce the mixture. Other than that - the pork was excellent! I ran out of raspberry wine vinegar and substitued red wine vinegar instead for the cabbage...still tasted very good.

Overall, a really tasty dish. Halving the breadcrumb mixture provides more than enough to do the job. Reducing the sauce longer and using only about half the cream makes this sauce even better. Using dry white wine indstead of beer and a horseradish mustard works very well also.

Excellent. I used sour cream and a good white wine instead of beer in the sauce and used seasoned bread crumbs for the dip.

I made this recipe exactly as listed and it was wonderfull. The sauce goes particularly well with brussels sprouts. A definite keeper.

Fabulous! I have made this several times for company and have been asked for the recipie every time! I do reduce it further than mentioned and have used thinner cream with good results.

I've made this twice ... once for the family and once for company. It was a big hit both times!

ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC! I loved this recipe. I took the advice of the cook from Milano and used less cream. It was still totally decadent. I loved the coating and think the recipe would be great using chicken breasts rather than pork. This is destined to become a family classic.

Rating: 2
I was disappointed. It sounded exquisite. I found the pork coating was too sweet. The mustard sauce was way too rich but it might be because our panna (heavy cream) is more dense than the double cream found in the States. It had a good taste though. I would try the sauce again with less cream and maybe top it off with some fresh chives. And definitely a different coating on the pork.

The entire family enjoyed this dish.

Made this dish with chicken rather than pork out of necessity, but it turned out wonderfully! The spices in the breading and the sauce are particularly delicious. I would make sure to start the sauce with plenty of time to spare to ensure thickening time. The raspberry/cabbage salad was a great compliment.

My husband and even the kids love this recipe. It has become one of our family staples.

My wife Cynthia has made this recipe several times, and it has turned out wonderfully each time. She makes her own bread-crumbs from homemade bread. Be sure to pound the medallions thin and have a nice hot frying pan. She is a bigger fan of the raspberry cabbage than I am, but it is still nice.

Delicious, indeed. Perfect for a cool evening. No plroblems with cooking for two.

Excellent! The only problem I have with this recipe is that it looks like chicken fried steak. So I wouldn't serve it at a dinner party (except I may use the mustard caper sauce on something else). The taste, however, is outstanding.

This dish was wonderful! I do agree with the other reviewer about the sauce though, it is very thin but delicious. It is a wonderfully elegant meal and would not hesitate to make it for company.

My guests liked the pork, but I'd personally leave out the nutmeg next time. My sauce was a bit runny prepared as written, so I'd err on the side of less liquid or longer reduction. The pork is a good "base" for breading it as you please and serving any form of sauce you choose.
