Delicious. Made several modifications: Included some whole cardamom pods in the spice saute. Added toasted chopped almonds and a generous spoonful of mango chutney at the end. Didn't include any dried fruit. The whole family loved it and the leftovers were nice for a cold salad lunch plate.

I make a lot of bulghur wheat salads. This is not one I'll likely make again - at least without some considerable revisions. Biggest problem: too dry, flavor is nice and complex but too understated. The onions and ginger work great together. The spices make a nice combo. I added a little more olive oil, juice of one lemon, mint leaves, and served with a dollop of sour cream. If I ever make this again, I'll use more oil, add in some garlic when I add the ginger and onion, and I'll probably throw in some raisins or dried cherries.

This is wonderful and a good change from rice. I was concerned that my husband might not like it so I mixed in a little brown rice (cooked separately) and it was tasty. BUT this dish is tasty as is. I served it with an African seasoned salmon and mango salsa. I will definitely make this again.
