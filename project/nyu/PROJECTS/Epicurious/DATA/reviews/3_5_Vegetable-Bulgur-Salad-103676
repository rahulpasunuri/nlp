Made it with zucchini instead of eggpant and quiona instead of bulger. Added a little feta. Yum! Nice way to use up summer squash this time of year.

This is a really gourmet salad! I loved it! I was out of spinach so added the organic arugula blend from EarthBound Farm and turned out great! I used both yellow squash and italian zucchine. For the bulgur I had at home, I needed to let soaking for the double time and half more of the amount of water required. It is a perfect summer salad!
