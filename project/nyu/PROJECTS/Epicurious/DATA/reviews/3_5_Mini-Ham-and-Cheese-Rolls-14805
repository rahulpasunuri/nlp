Not what I had hoped I had purchased the take and bake dinner roles that are 90% already baked. They were good but the paur on sauce was too buttery and just tasted like mustard and butter the other flavors did not seem to come through.

i've been making these for years and adults and children alike routinely swoon over them. just made them again last night for a superbowl party. here's how my recipe differs: i use kings hawaiian rolls (halved length-wise so that you have a top and bottom), spicy mustard (dijon or chinese hot mustard) and boarshead honey ham that i have shaved at the deli. i melt the butter over the stove, add the poppy seeds, worcestire, mustard and onion flakes then drizzle the whole mixture over the assembled rolls with ham/swiss. wrap the whole thing in foil and heat thru for 15-20 mins at 350. never had any issues with rolls turning out soggy. try these. you won't be dissapointed.

I made these for a party and they were a big hit. Instead of drizzling melted butter, I just used very soft butter and spread it inside and on top. Yum!

Almost made these for a large party and GLAD I didn't. This recipe needs some serious tweeking. I agree only with the 13 year as these were very ordinary

As was stated below, this is a very popular recipe in the south. A few modifications I make for ease: chop the ham, cheese, and a medium onion separately in the food processor. Instead of melted margerine, I use two sticks of softened butter mixed with 1 tsp. worcestershire, 3 T poppyseeds, and 3T dijon. You can then mix in the ham, cheese and onion and simply spread on the rolls that have been split in half lengthwise. This recipe freezes well and can be baked straight from the freezer (add an additional 5 - 10 minutes to the cooking time). By the way, the rolls they are talking about are the little rectangular ones you can find in the bakery in a little foil baking sheet with about 24 rolls/package(always available around Thanksgiving but usually I can find them the rest of the year). My version makes enough filling for 3 pans of rolls.

Oh my goodness..... I made this recipe for my wife. She was having a Southern Living Home Party and I am the cook in the house. I decided to try this. The only thing about these is that they must be served warm or they are not as good. Everyone raved about how good they were and said they wished their husbands made stuff that was that good! This one was a real winner. EXCELLENT RECIPE! I will make it over and over.

These sandwiches are sooo good and easy to make. In answer to some of the questions about rolls and where to put the melted butter. I've made these with Pepperige Farm dinner rolls, bakery dinner rolls, regular rolls and you could do this with a whole italian loaf. As I understand the recipe, it is to pour the melted butter OVER the bread. That's what I did. I was afraid it would make the bread soggy being covered with foil to bake, but to my surprise the bread gets nice and crunchy and very tasty. I also used finely minced fresh onion. I've varied the filling. My sons like ham,provolone and pepperoni, but any cold cuts and cheese makes a great sandwich. I used Turkey, muenster, and cooked bacon strips. For the poster who wonders what soup to serve. A nice creamy potato or a simple hearty vegetable is nice.

I did not use pepperidge farms rolls. You can use any roll or even Hamburger buns if you do not have small rolls. I could only find large sized rolls and I sliced them in 4 pie shaped rolls after baking. I agree to let the butter solidify before spreading. I had butter all over my sheet and had to spread the poppy seed mixture on the rolls. I had 10 teenagers and 4 adults for a superbowl party. The kids loved them. My daughter ate the leftovers cold out of the refrigerator the next day after school. Good idea about freezing. They would make a great after school snack.

I made these with Virginia ham and baby swiss. As per a previous reviewer, I sauteed chopped onion in the butter rather than use flakes, and subbed stone ground mustard (try Plochmans--it has a touch of horseradish, yum!) for the yellow. Like many, I couldn't find the Pepperidge Farm (despite it being an available brand here), so I used little butter twist rolls from the bakery. As for the ongoing controversy as to where the butter mixture goes, I brushed some on the bottom of the rolls (under the ham) when melted, and then cooled the rest, and spread on the inside of the tops, so it melted down into the cheese. I could see saving some to brush over the outside as well, depending on the style of roll you use, kind of like making an onion/poppyseed roll. The bottom line is, enjoy your food, and these are easy to enjoy. My husband said "these are really good, where did you learn to make them?" It would be a great thing to keep in the freezer and just pop in the oven as needed! (Now I just need to figure out what kind of soup to match up with, for a great soup and sandwich supper.)

I first made these when my middle son hosted his first Super Bowl party. He was in 5th or 6th grade, and my notes (in the stained, dog-eared copy of the wonderful community cookbook where I found the recipe) say that all the guests raved. He said several of the guys particularly asked if I'd make "that ham thing" again this week for their annual SB gathering at a friend's house. Pretty remarkable, considering that those grade-school kids are now twentysomethings! Can you spell 'k-e-e-p-e-r'?? :) My version calls for melting the butter, stirring in Dijon mustard, poppy seeds and fresh onion (a medium one, chopped), sauteeing until onion is translucent. Love the suggestion about allowing the butter mixture to solidify so you can spread it on ahead of time without getting the bread soggy. But I really question putting it on top of bread instead of using inside as a sandwich spread. One other thing...Pepperidge Farm is a fairly high-quality label that, as another reviewer noted, is most commonly found east of the MS. You don't have to use that particular brand, but I think it's worth seeking out 'party' rolls. The filling would be sort of overwhelmed if the bread wasn't soft and more or less bite-sized.

There are really sim[le and a good week night meal. To CA: Pepperidge Farm is a brand that is not readily available west of the Mississippi-- I've yet to find any of thier products since I moved to NM. And the spread goes, as far as I'm concerned, with the ham and cheese, not on top, but that's a preference.

I have YET to make this recipe - am stymied - #1: Pepperidge Farm dinner rolls as recommended by Va Beach, Va reviewer - WHERE does one FIND Pepperidge Farm dinner rolls? I checked the bakery AND the freezer section of my store and Pepperidge Farms dinner rolls were NOWHERE to be found. #2: Is the drizzle mixture placed OVER the dinner rolls or BETWEEN the dinner rolls?! #3: Exactly HOW many dinner rolls (countwise) are needed for this recipe - "2 packages dinner rolls" is too VAGUE

These are SOooo good!!! A staple in our family especially around holidays when pressed for time and people are coming and going. We make them up ahead of time in large batches, wrap in foil and keep in freezer. We use country ham and regular swiss. The Pepperidge Farm dinner rolls are faster, just split the whole package and layer ham & cheese. The secret to the wonderful flavor is the spread. Make up and refrigerate. It is easier to spread on INSIDE of rolls when solid. Enjoy!

Great recipe! I made these for a Super Bowl party and kept them in a chafing dish to keep them warm. Many of my guests asked for the recipe. Definitely a keeper!

We've been making these for years for Christmas morning. Never knew it was an official recipe. They're so tasty and addictive!

YUMMY! I suggest making these with homemade rolls. There's a very easy recipe for "Dear Little Rolls" on this Web site...they're out of this world! I loved these miniature ham and cheese sandwiches because their simplicity is what makes them so delicious. Less is more...these are definitely proof of that sentiment.

This was a big hit at my latest party. I used the PFarm dinner rolls (sliced in 1/2, assembled, and cut into individuals after baking) as suggested and tried a more hearty italian loaf (prepared the same way). The PF were more popular and took less time to heat. I also chilled the margarine mixture and spread it inside and on top - I think poppy seeds can function as a decorative herb -it made the sandwiches look attractive. Will definitely make again.

These were great little sandwiches. I read the other reviews and took the advice of one of the members and made up the mixture ahead of time and refrigerated to solidify. I thought that 20 minutes in the oven was a bit much. Will cook less next time.

Great little sandwiches. Easy and loved by kids and adults!

Easy, easy, easy!! The directions to split the rolls in half and cut after baking helped. These were great in an appetizer spread. Made up well ahead of time, pop in the oven as needed. I look forward to experimenting with other flavor combinations. I see Turkey and horseradish in my future....

I get raves every time I make these, and they are so easy! Great for tailgating or any other casual event. Everyone begs me to bring these rolls! (They are also great with turkey instead of ham.)

My husband loved these! I made them for a football game and thought they were easy and yummy! I was confused about whether or not to put the spread on top or inside the rolls, I opted for on top. Next time, I'll do both.

These are a must have for parties. Everyone loves them. I like to use turkey- chopped a little, and shredded swiss. If you melt the butter, add chopped fresh onion, mustard and the poppy seeds, you can refrig. overnight or a few hrs. The mixture solidifies and makes a spread that is very easy to work with. This way I can assemble the sandwiches ahead of time without the bread getting soggy. And, bake at the last minute. A great time saver if planning a party!

Excellent snack to have any time of year, and it's always a big hit! I have made this several times for Super Bowls as well as a picnic snack for boat rides. Never any leftover! For those a little confused by the directions - the easiest way to do this is cut the entire package of rolls in half, spread mixture on one half, add cheese and ham, and then place back together. Cut into individual sandwiches after they are baked - MUCH easier! I have made several variations on this - for a little zing try a finely diced onion instead of the dried, and for a little more flavor, add 2 tablespoons Worstershire to mixture. Yummy!!

This is a great pick up for a brunch or casual party at night. This is a very popular recipe down south and the way we do here is to cut the whole package of rolls in half. Then, mix the margarine with the onions, mustard and poppy seeds and spread it on the bottom half of the rolls. Top with ham and cheese. Put the top back on and then cut the sandwiches with a knife. Cover with foil and bake.

The "product" is SUPERB .. given the MINIMAL EFFORT required. The reviewer suggestions of Dijon for common mustard and minced onion for the flakes have my vote, also. Because of the ambiguity of the instructions regarding "dribbling the margarine mixture over the sandwiches" (while open or closed?), I spread some on the inside of the rolls with a spatula and dribbled over as well. I used 1 package of the much touted Pepperidge Farms "Party White" mini-rolls and some silver dollar rolls from the upscale store bakery. I feel that the silver dollar rolls (more readily available year round) are every bit as good as the Pepperidge Farms "Party White" rolls which the upscale urban store explained were stocked there around holidays only. A KEEPER!

Everyone thought these were great. But will someone please tell me -- do you pour the butter mixture over the ham and cheese, or do you pour it over the top of the rolls (I poured it over the top)? Stupid question, but recipe is not terribly clear.

I make a similar version of this recipe CONSTANTLY. These rolls are at home at a picnic, brunch, shower or cocktail party. There are never any left. The differences in my recipe: I use fresh minced onion, and dijon mustard. Men, women, kids, adults -- everyone loves these. Be sure to use the Pepperidge Farm Rolls called "Party Rolls" -- they are tiny and the perfect size for hors d'ouerves. Make these soon!

OK..Here's what I did to make my life easier when making this for 50 or so people, but it even streamlines things for one batch. Split the entire tray of rolls in half horizontally, keeping them joined to one another and spread the mixture over the large rectangle of bread. I used deviled ham (horrors you may say) but it was actually very good. I mixed it in with all the ingredients and spread the whole lot at once. It was MUCH easier and quicker. You can split them up after they come out of the oven.
