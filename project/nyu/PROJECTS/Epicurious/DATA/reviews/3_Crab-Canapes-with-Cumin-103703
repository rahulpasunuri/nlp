I just made this and added a little mayo and celery to the recipe. I think it needs a little something..... maybe some cream cheese would have worked as well. I like the cilantro and tobasco, they give it a nice kick.

The pita chips don't need 10 mins. at 425 degrees. Went through two batches before I used a 350 oven at 5 mins. Also, used fresh cilantro as the recipe called for. I thought it was too strong a flavor for the crab.

Recently made this again, and as always, a huge hit. More oil is necessary than what's called for, and don't even think about using anything other than jumbo lump. There is no excuse for canned crab.

I made this according to the recipe and found it tasty. I don't like fake crabmeat so used the real thing (lump, frozen) and it was great - went very quickly.

Reviewer who found the crabmeat smelling fine by itself but awful in the recipe - you are not alone! The secret is to use fake crabmeat. Otherwise, it's a roll of the dice - no matter how high quality the crabmeat.

This was really tasty. All I had on hand for crabmeat was the imitation kind. I made up a small batch to sample it first and it was great!!! I made a full batch -everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. I minced some red onion instead of the scallions to give it a bit more bite. and agree about needing more oil for the pita toasts- and really watching them so they don't burn. Definitely an easy recipe that will be a keeper! Will make again with real crabmeat, but the imitation stuff was pretty tasty too! I would imagine using good quality crabmeat would have me giving it 4 forks.

To the cook from Texas, it sounds like your Sesame oil was rancid. Sesame oil is not very shelf-stable. It's betst kept in the refrigerator.

Something went horribly wrong with this recipe. When I tasted and smelled the crabmeat by itself, it was fine. But when I added it to the other ingredients, a particularly loathsome smell was released: foul and fishy. The house reeked. My first thought was that the crabmeat was not high-quality, but then I remembered it smelled and tasted fine by itself. I don't know what happened, but I wouldn't spend the money to try again. If I could this recipe zero forks, I would.

Absolutely double the oil mixture. The quality of the crabmeat is the key to this dish. I've made this twice and the second time was nowhere near as good as I couldn't find fresh crabmeat.

The crab and corriander flavors are excellent together! I have made it with canned crab when "real" crab was not available and it was still very good.

Excellent! I doubled the oil mixture as suggested. The real secret is to use good crabmeat not the 6 oz. canned. I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved them.

I have made this twice. I agree you need more oil mixture. Also, watch the toasts so they don't burn, the difference between crisp and burned is a very short time.

I have already made this twice since first seeing the recipe. I found that I needed significantly more of the oils and Cumin than was called for in the recipe.
