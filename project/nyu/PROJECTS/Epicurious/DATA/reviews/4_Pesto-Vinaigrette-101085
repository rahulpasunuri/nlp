I have made this as written and we love it. I am wondering if I can use lemon basil and leave out the fresh lemon?

This dressing turned out great. I didn't use my food processor. I combined the lemon juice and mustard, then drizzled the olive oil in, whisking all the while, and it emmulsified beautifully. Then I just stirred the herbs and garlic into the oil mixture. If you have accesss to Meyer lemons use them! (We have a Meyer tree so I always use these delicate sweet lemons in every recipe.) Will definitely make this one a spring and summer staple when I have fresh herbs around!

I have made this for dinners with friends. Everyone who likes basil, loves this. It is easy and tasty and need not be limited to salad greens. Pine nuts is a very good suggestion, but I've only made the dressing as written.

Added two tablespoons of toasted coursely ground pine nuts. Delightful.
