Loved, loved, loved this recipe. These were very light on filler and heavy on seafood. I followed another reviewer's advice and used 1 lb. of scallops and 1 lb. of shrimp. I also only processed 1/4 of the mixture of seafood, and added the rest of the chopped seafood to that mix after processing, which worked really well. It held together wonderfully while cooking. I make these for a cocktail party so made them bite-sized, cooked them ahead of time, 2 minutes a side, and kept them warm in a 200 degree oven--worked great. I made the red onion marmalade, but did not feel that it complemented the flavors of the seafood all that well. I used instead a cajun style remoulade sauce (online) instead. My guests raved about it.

I thought these were fabulous. I live on the coast so we eat a lot of seafood, and these are definitely going into permanent rotation. I made them almost exactly as the recipe directs, with a couple of changes: I don't like panko, so I used coarsely crumbled Ritz and oyster crackers instead, but in the same amounts as the recipe states for panko. Also, I made them about half the size that the recipe suggests, I ended up with 11 rather than 6. That was the perfect size in my opinion, the proportion of soft inside to crunchy outside was ideal. This exceeded my (high) expectations by quite a lot. I loved the sauce, but the kids wouldn't eat it- too sharp for their tastes. I want to make this next week for a guest who dislikes cilantro. I'm not sure which way I'll go with it, possibly some curry flavor in the cakes and a coconut milk-based sauce.

I have made this two ways now- once with cilantro and once without. Both times I was very pleased with the outcome. The second time I took the below reviewers' advice and made the Red Onion Marmalade. Delicious! It complimented the cakes very well, I cant wait to use it again with this dish and others! The cakes taste great and are easy to make. Highly recommended.

Very good and a hit at my appetizer & wine party. The sauce is so-so ... I think I'll take the other reviewers suggestion next time and serve with an aioli sauce instead.

I thought this recipe was fabulous. I made it just as written. I didn't find it to be too difficult or time consuming because of the number of steps that can be done ahead of time. It's impressive to look at and a nice change from crab cakes. The sauce is great and a much needed addition.

Great appetizer ... made the suggested Red Onion Marmalade (recipe online) -- wonderful addition and a definite must-do. For a dinner party of 8, I used 1 lb of sea scallops (well-drained and patted dry) and about 1 lb of shrimp ... all other ingredients in the original proportions ..... I chopped both the scallops and shrimp ..... put about 1/4th of this mixture into the processor .... then folded in the remaining and refrigerated. Give this a try -- you'll be glad.

I made this recipe for a dinner party and it was a big hit. BUT, I also served it with the red onion marmalade the cheif suggested in the magazine article.(I found a recipe on this site) Everyone agreed that is what put it over the top!

Great recipe, I have made this with half the scallops blended and half roughly chopped. I did not care for the sauce, so the 2nd time I made the cakes and accompanied it with a cilantro-lime aioli.

But I would add more seafood, and less filling. Too much breading

This was good, but after reading all the rave reviews, I was somewhat disappointed. It was a bit overseasoned, and I would have preferred the scallops to have been recognizable rather than blended to smooth. Overall, it was still quite good.

Very good recipe! I added crab meat along with the rest of the seafood. Sauce was a little strong, I wasn't a huge fan of it, but my company loved it. Would definetly make again, but my modify the sauce a little bit. When I do I will post the changes if I like the results.

This recipe is perfect and I wouldn't change a thing! However, it is alot of work. For an easier alternative,dip seabass orhalibut in panko and cook like the seafood cakes. The sauce works just as well with the fish.

I love this recipe! I have made it several times. I made it as an appetizer for a large dinner party. Everyone loved it. As a personal chef I am always looking for recipes that I can freeze ahead. This freezes and reheats beautifully. Make sure you use panko...it makes all the difference.

this recipe is very interesting because one of the main ingredients in flavor is used a lot in my native land, but besides that the completion of the rest of the ingredients is just well combined.

Just wonderful! I didn't change a thing and it was terrific. Sauce was delightful - it's got quite a bit of butter in it - however, I found that we only used approximately 1/3 of the finished sauce because of the richness (so don't worry about all that butter!). I found myself shoving my rice into the sauce just to get more!

Every time I make this for a party, people love it. If just serving as appetizer for cocktail party, substitute the cilantro cream sauce with aioli.

My husband, who said the whole time I was preparing these,that he disliked 'fish cakes', was barely satisfied with the 3 that he got! These were AMAZING! Used ordinary breadcrumbs...and couldn't imagine a tastier treat! Well worth the prep. time (will make double batches in the future!).
