Very good, and pretty to look at. It was too late for Rainier cherries, so I used Canadian Bing cherries. Also substituted rice vinegar for white wine vinegar, as another reader suggested, and Asiago for Parmesan, because I had some. Perfect summer lunch, with focaccia and the suggested wine pairing of champagne.

Superb. Use Rainier cherries and Marcona almonds. They do make a big difference. Our local cherries are so big that a cherry pitter is useless. We paired this salad with a wild salmon that had been grilled with a butter and cherry balsamic vinegar glaze and a Willamette Valley pinot noir. Fabulous meal. Manchego sounds like a good idea and we'll try it next time. Thanks! This will be come a much repeated meal during fresh cherry season.

Simple and delicious - perfect for summer! The cherries and arugula make a lovely combination. Forgot to buy almonds, so I toasted up some homemade croutons to add a crunchy element. Was still very good! Next time will try with almonds.

Terrific and terrifically easy. Suggestions: 1. Rainier cherries, not bing. They have more personality, look better, and the touch of sourness holds up well to the dressing. 2. Fresh cherries, at that, using a cherry pitter.

Excellet done way it is written, for some variation on the theme I have substituted Manchego for the Parm and on another occasion did White Balsamic rather than the White Wine Vinegar. Maybe I will try Mache next?

I just made this tonight to rave reviews. I didn't have any white wine vinegar, so I used a bit of rice vinegar, oj, and agave. Also, I chose an arugula blend box of lettuce. I mixed it all together and poured my dressing around. BTW, the most time-consuming part was slicing the cherries. And we liked the choice of cheese in the recipe. I highly recommend this!

Interesting combination, but the arugula and Parma overpower the salad to where you hardly taste the cherries.

This salad is so simple to make and has so few ingredients, yet is sublime. I used fresh white cherries as it's the short season in the Pacific Northwest for them now. The peppery arugula combined so well with the other ingredients. Even my ten year old congratulated me on finding a new way to serve a salad. I will make this every summer when white cherries are in season.
