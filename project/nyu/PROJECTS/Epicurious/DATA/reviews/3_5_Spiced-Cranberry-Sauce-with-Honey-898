We have made this since it was published 17 years ago! This is our "go-to" cranberry sauce. Make sure the cranberries "pop" otherwise it won't gel like it is supposed to. Superb recipe!

I make this every Thanksgiving. It beats canned mush any time. Sweet with a kick, your teeth don't feel like they are going to rot.

This was a fantastic recipe. All my guests loved it. I felt it was a little too "runny" so I might reduce the amount of cranberry juice cocktail for Christmas dinner.

The flavor of this was exceptional; including both peppers. To thicken it I blended about a cup of the sauce & added 1 tablespoon of butter. The butter added a nice dimension to the flavor. I will do this again!

I'm not a cranberry sauce fan but tried this for the Thanksgiving crowd. Many remarked that it had something "hot" in it and of course, it does. I tired it and thought it was an interesting mix of flavors but if I make it again I will omit the black pepper.

at my suggestion - my daughter (17) made this sauce, much to the delight of all who ate it including those who don't usually eat cranberries. it's been requested again this year, and we plan to make enough to have leftovers to 'put up' (so we can use it to top a brie encroute at our christmas brunch. also, it makes a lovely gift in a canning jar. DON"T OMIT THE CAYENNE.

This has become a family tradition. I have made it at Thanksgiving and Christmas every year since it was first published. The flavors are complex and deep, and there is just enough heat from the cayenne to enhance them. As others have said, don't skip the cayenne, as it adds an important dimension. Everyone I've served it to loves it -- including my picky daughters.

Mine was a little more sour than I like it. I much preferred the recipe for the Cranberry-Pear Chutney I had made in a previous year. It wasn't a disaster but I wouldn't make it again since it was just "ok".

This sauce was AMAZING!!! Don't you dare omit the cayenne - that is what makes this sauce so special. Reduce it if you like, but leave it in for a wonderful warmth that beautifully complements the other ingredients in the sauce. This sauce was such a hit that I actually RAN OUT! Who'd have thunk that it was possible to run out of cranberry sauce?

This was very good. I also made Triple Cranberry Sauce. I liked this one better though. I like the spices.

I hate to provide a negative review, but this turned out to be the worst cranberry sauce I ever made. No one finished their serving, and we are real cranberry sauce lovers. I recommend instead the cranberry sauce with pears and cardamom or the cranberry sauce with dried cherries and cloves, which I made in the past & were huge hits.

I've made this cranberry sauce every year for the past 6 years for Thanksgiving and always get rave reviews for it. I omit the cayenne pepper, as did most reviewers. It makes an attractive addition to the Thanksgiving table and it's really yummy with leftovers!

This was excellent! The spice flavors were so perfect. I never would have thought to combine this flavor combination, but boy did it work.

Great recipe. I made it without the cayenne pepper. In addition to looking great on the table, it has a wonderful aroma and really interesting flavor. My only problem was that it took quite a bit longer than 15 minutes for the berries to burst.

I must have done something wrong along the way, but I have no idea what. This sauce just hurt to eat. With that ginger, and pepper, it was just too pungent for me, almost a chemical sting. Others I served it to were satisfied with the flavor, so perhaps it's just preference. Maybe keep that in mind when creating a menu, if you are serving someone who isn't fond of powerful tang and flavor, choose something more mild.

Quick and easy with a little flare....when it is this simple why buy the canned variety. Your guest will appreciate the extra effort.

We *love* this recipe in my family, although I, too, skip the cayenne. It looks beautiful on the table for holidays, and it's great in the leftover turkey sandwiches.

This cranberry sauce is absolutely amazing...you have to try it. I have made it three years in a row and it has always been a hit. The spices and orange add a lot of layers to it! It's great as a leftover too.

Really yumbo twist on an old standard. Four forks up!

This is a beautiful recipe that is just bursting with flavor. A step above the usual cranberry sauces one normally samples around this time of year. I have made this recipe the past 4 years in a row and everytime there is someone that wants the recipe. Be sure to make enough to last past the holiday season because of the sauces versitility.

I absolutely adore this recipe with a few modifications. Use orange blossom honey (it really makes a difference,) omit the black and cayenne pepper, and the salt. The fragrance is like a cranberry perfume. Try it as a cheesecake topping during the holidays. Fabulous. (PS. I also keep a can of ocean spray jellied sauce for the cry babies in the group)

I really enjoyed the flavor of this recipe, but would have liked the sauce to be much thicker than it was. Perhaps I'll try adding gelatin or cornstarch to the recipe next time I make it.

EVERYONE loved this: kids, Velveeta people, foodies. It made the house smell great and was really easy. It's now in my permanent collection.

After reading the rave reviews I made this sauce for Thanksgiving this year, along with a more traditional sauce. I had high hopes for it, but must admit it was quite disappointing. I really preferred the traditional sauce.

Just a wonderful way of using cranberries. Every guest we had enjoyed it and are asking for it again this year.

This will be our 4th holiday season enjoying this wonderful alternative to traditional cranberry sauces/relishes. We love it!! This year I'm going to make some for Christmas gifts too.

My favorite cranberry sauce recipe. The first time I tried it for Thanksgiving (3 years ago), someone in my family insisted on making the "traditional" kind, too. They don't do that any more.

Wonderful. It has a little spicey kick. It is easy, and your house smells great afterwards. If it is not for Thanksgiving try it with roast pork tenderloin!
