This is a great, simple to make snack. As with anything fried, make sure your oil is hot enough (375) before you start dumping stuff in. One recipe makes quite a lot of them, so make sure you have a good number of strapping boys around to finish them off! I made the chickpea mixture on the stove, but next time I'm going to try the microwave suggestion.

I haven't made these yet, but plan to. The whole concept of panelle is easy enough, so I'm sure these will come out great (I plan to try the sundried tomato suggestion - yum!). I did want to add something: I lived in Palermo for a while, where these are a go-to street food. Over there the cheese sprinkled on top is called caciocavallo and it's kind of like provolone. I'm sure parmesan will work great but, if you get a chance, pick up some caciocavallo and rustic semolina peasant rolls... heaven. Makes me homesick just thinking about it.

This was delicious. A simple dish, but extremely addictive! Everyone tonight asked me for the recipe. I must confess that I did not cook the mixture on the stovetop, but instead, did it in the microwave (!); I cooked the water and chickpea mixture covered on high for 5 minutes until it had changed to a darker pale yellow colour. I'm pretty anti-microwave, but I ruined this recipe 2x before trying to do it on the stovetop. This time, microwave = sucess! No lumps or burning. Of course I still panfried it after it'd set in the loaf pan.

These are yummy! Can't see eating them between bread, however. We ate them like crackers. Also, did not take nearly as long to thicken as recipe states (more like 5 minutes).

Does'nt anybody worry about the fate of the unfortunate baby chickpea who had a creepy life, raised in the giant ranch of an inhuman chickpea grower ?!?!?! HAHAHA!!! This recipe taste very good, will do again.

Very amusing - never thought I would get so much 'entertainment' from a food review. Bravo.

Sicilian sea salt is harvested from the Mediterranean & is naturally produced from salt pans by evaporation and ground without washing or further refining. It is a natural untreated salt, rich in minerals such as iodine, fluorine, magnesium and potassium, all of which make it an ideal table salt. The combination of different minerals and the naturally low percentage of sodium chloride in Sicilian sea salt gives it a delicate taste and plenty of flavor without being too strong or salty. This sea salt is generally meant for use in cooking, as opposed to liberal sprinkling at the tabletop.

This was a good recipe. Try it, you will not be disappointed. Regarding Sicilian sea salt, it it harvested in the shallow area of the Med off the cost of the island with mineral content unique to the area. It is "sun-dried" in open flat containers and is not refined like all commercial table salt and some commercial sea salts. So it does have a subtle flavor difference. Does it make or break the recipe? Of course not, but let's be respectful of each other and appreciate the intent of the recipe's author to present an authentic regional dish.

Sounds good and I have to try this because of all the fuss. Some of us do like simple foods - like that fresh homegrown tomato I am looking forward to in July. The soap opera of cooking?!!

I would like to state firstly that I haven't made this recipe - hence no forks. However, I made a delicious recipe last night with similar ingredients and can heartily recommend it: "Zucchini Fritters with Feta and Dill" - from the 2nd Moro cookbook. Made with grated zucchini, chickpea flour and soda water, they are wonderfully light, tasty and best of all do not need to be deep fried - a huge plus in my book. They are served with a light yoghurt sauce and a simple tomato salad. A fantastic summer starter. I would also like to suggest that anyone with salt issues, re: comments below, read Jeffrey Steingarten's essay, Salt Chic - from his second book "It must have been something I ate". Happy cooking and happy chatting, all of you!

I made this recipe tonight with a friend who is from Palermo...she suggested using oil infused with sun-dried tomatoes in the batter. Talk about a DELICIOUS suggestion... By the by, poster from NYC...give your opinion and move on. Almighty knows, we NYC natives have a bad enough reputation in too many circles as it is...whether we deserve it or not.

These fritters were outstanding and the hit of my wine party. Hey cook from NYC-- quit urging everyone to get a life when you obviously don't have one! Otherwise why would you keep checking back and defending your opinion on a COOKING FORUM??

These were tasty and a fun new thing to try! To the person from NYC: hope you can cook better than you post-- one post of your preachy opinion is bad enough, but three is downright boring!

As for the person who just posted the following remark: Much more annoying are those who have to post their comments 2 and 3 times because they are impatient. Trust Epicurious. Post once. Please. It will eventually show up...) " ..... Please note - I am not impatient at all - my computer kept dropping the page over and over again and my post was unfortunately, without my knowledge, posted several times. It was not my intent and I assure you, not due to impatience on my part. Again, I have never viewed such an attack on a RECIPE site because someone dared to speak their mind over a comment which I ALSO thought was ridiculous, i.e "use sicilian salt"!! Good Grief - no one is attacking your CULTURAL (in this case Italian) food preferences - GET A LIFE!!

Without a doubt, this is an outstanding recipe of a not often seen Sicilian food. I, also, am Sicilian - and have made this recipe many times (although I've always 'dried' the panelle, never chilled - I like this version!) To the individual who claims to be a cook in Arlington and had the poor taste (haha, a corny pun there) to make an unnecessary reflection on Sicilian salt: I always understood that regional cooking and foods are always celebrated for their unique flavors DUE TO unique ingredients found in that region. That is why we have so many different, wonderful types of regional cooking - right? Otherwise South Pacific or Australian lobster would taste the same as farm-raised...

I can't see getting excited about this recipe. It tastes like falafel without the flavor.

To all of you bashing Arlington: Arlington made a comment, but look closely: THERE WAS NO "FORK" RECIPE RATING (also none for this post). Comments and ratings are separate. Also, the ratings may include people who have "fork" RATED (and chosen "make again" or not) but have not chosen to COMMENT. One can do either or both.(Much more annoying are those who have to post their comments 2 and 3 times because they are impatient. Trust Epicurious. Post once. Please. It will eventually show up...)

It appears all of you have made this recipe or have eaten it in the past. However, the person who made the remark about the salt is entitled to his/her remark, in my opinion. When I read the remark about it should be "preferably sicilian salt", I TOO thought to myself, "what are they kidding"??? I can see suggesting that you use sea salt or similar, but to actually suggest that you use SICILIAN sea salt is a bit much, don't you think? Afterall, I am assuming most readers of this sight are in the U.S. and I certainly don't think that making a point of using salt from some remote part of the world was necessary to the outcome of the recipe. Get a grip -

I am so excited to see this recipe! My family has been making panelles for years (we are Sicilian). I haven't ever tried them with parsley and cheese, but it sounds wonderful!

This is great!! Even tho fried, still has a lightness suitable for lunch or even brunch. It is a shame that the recipe was poorly rated by some who will never understand "local colour!!"

Fabulous recipe. To the cook from Arlington, VA: Please refrain from using this rating index to make petty comments about the dish's ingredient list if you've never tried the dish, and if you can't distinguish the difference between various sea salts. This is, afterall, a RATING index -- and people like you, who just leave irrelevant comments, mess up the rating system for the rest of us.

Fabulous recipe. I wish people who have never tried a given recipe would refrain from using the rating system to leave petty comments that have no bearing on the quality of the dish. If you can't rate it from experience, why mess up the dish's overall rating index? Maybe Epicurious should have some kind of a petty comment/ make fun of the chef forum?

To the person who asked about the Salt and the taste - YES it does taste much different. Just like Fleur de Sel tastes different (I actually carry this with me - when food is just so-so - Fleur de Sel can bring a dish to life). Sicilian Salt is a stronger salt then say table salt or fleur de sel. But what you use doesn't really matter as long as it tastes good to you.

This fine, authentic recipe transports a cook to a Sicilian kitchen. Of course, Sicilian salt isn't necessary, but it's preferred because it's part of the culinary voyage. (What a shame that someone gave this recipe a bad review simply because it recommends a local ingredient!)

"Preferably Sicilian" sea salt? Does Sicilian sea salt taste that much better than any other coarse sea salt? Give me a break.

Absolutely delicious! My family loves this recipe.
