I have made this with Blackberries and now with strawberries and it was AWESOME. I used the recipe as written with 2 Lb of strawberries and lemon zest from a med. lemon. It is perfect. I cooked it about 20 min. I could tell it was getting thicker and it jelled nicely. The first time I made it I overcooked it and it jelled a bit stiffer but not an issue on warm toast! I do alot of canning and use the "revised canning method" where I don't boil the jars after I fill them as the jam is already cooked and hot. I just pack the jars right away and warm the lids as the recipe says and screw them on tight and turn them upside down for 10-15 minutes and then put them right side up and let them sit for another 10 min. Then check to make sure the center of the lid goes down (concave). I have done over 100 jars/jam using this method and it works great without all the hassle of boiling them in a hot water bath.

I've made this jam several times now - with mixed berries, single berries, figs, you name it. Always a success. I've added in spices, port, whatever goes with the fruit, and again, always turns out beautifully. I hit the farmers market, buy a lot of whatever is in season, and voila, a pantry full of goodness for the winter, and for holiday giving. If you want to skip the canning, I've found the jam lasts 2+ months in the fridge.

Okay, I ended up making another batch in August that I canned and I'm happy I did since its almost November and I'm still enjoying berries. fineeats.blogspot.com

This was my first time making jam. I think this is a delicious simple recipe-let's say I may have dipped my finger in the jam for a little taste. I didn't want to try canning so I just have it in glass jars with lids. I'll be using this in a jam tart or to fill some sable cookies. Yum.

I've made this twice now. The second time I doubled the recipe and ended up with 8 half pints of delicious jam. I used raspberries as I had it in abundance from the bushes behind my house. The first time I made it, I overcooked it a bit and it was difficult to spread. The second time, I think I got it just right, although it took longer to cook than the stated 18 minutes. Either way it was delicious! Especially when it is still warm. I will definitely be making this again next year.

absolutely delicious. I used 2 lbs strawberries and 1 cup of sugar along with the 2 tbs lemon juice and added some lemon zest. The jam smelled delicious when it was cooking and was great right off the stove over ice cream. I'm not sure if it will gell correctly as I never made jam before but it will still make a great spread. I also followed the simpler non-canning instructions.

I just made two batches of this jam - blackberry-blueberry (equal amounts of both berries) and plain blackberry. They came out delicious, and both batches yielded 4 half-pints. Also, I lightly crushed the berries before mixing in the sugar so the juices and the pectin really have a chance to flow during that two-hour wait. I've been making jams, etc. for years, and I've always used the "old school" method this recipe uses (no added pectin), but I've never seen a recipe that uses so little sugar - hooray! When making jam this way it is CRITICAL that you get the mix to the jelling point - 220 degrees F (8 degrees above boiling point) or the mixture won't set. Jams made this way are softer in texture than jams made with added pectin, but they set up perfectly when refrigerated. If you make a batch that doesnt set right, you can always cook it again till you get it to the right temp. The results are definitely worth the effort  sometimes the old ways are best!

Two pounds of peaches and one pint of raspberries, three hours of work, a big mess and...two half-pints of jelly. Delish, but maybe not worth the effort?

Superb combination of flavors. I can't ever seem to get it to set up, but I have made this six or seven times to pour over ice cream or shortcakes.

I made this for mother's day and canned them in Mason jars decorated with dried flowers on the top. I used strawberries instead and it came out exceptional. everyone loved the jam. I have never made jam before and this was easy, yummy, and an exceptional present made from the heart. I can't wait to try it with apricots
