I think I must have overcooked this a little as it was rather dry. n The orange sauce and cream are what makes this recipe.

Gluten Free Option: Although this torte is lighter if made with wheat flour, it is still quite delicious if made with all purpose gluten free flour (Bob's Red Mill). The almonds are the key driver for the flavor/texture.

This is an old favorite recipe. Can't believe I've been making it since it was first published in 1995. You don't need both sauces for 6 people. Pick one, both are nice. Even good with just a simple dusting of powdered sugar. For the ground almonds, try what is packaged as "almond flour" in some stores like Trader Joes. It's finely ground almonds and make this even faster to perpare. Yes, the 1 tablespoon of OJ should list orange peel for the cake.

Wonderful! I made this for our dinner club using indiv. ramekins. Nice presentations and great taste. It was a huge hit. I will make again but decrease almonds by 1/2 and increase egg whites to 4 to make this a lighter recipe.

this is a poorly written recipe.How many eggwhites am I whipping here?I assumed three and I liked the results.I sprinkled sliced almonds on top before baking,delicious.

I think there is a typo in this recipe -- in the ingredients for the cake, there should be 2 T orange juice and 1 T _orange_peel_, not orange juice also.

This is a perfect ending to any meal. I didn't serve the cream, didnt need it. It was light, tasty and just the perfect sweetness.Perfect with tea or coffee.

I agree with the previous review, this recipe was easy to make and delicious. The almond flavour really shines through in the cake. The Marsala cream was good..but even better after adding another tablespoon of marsala.

This torte is fantastic, and very easy to make. The orange sauce is very good, but is is great all by itself. It's so good I never bothered to make the whipped cran, it doesn't need it. Enjoy!!
