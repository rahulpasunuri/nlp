I prepared this as written (mostly--I subbed a parsnip for one of the carrots), and thought it was good. Oh, and I steamed the clams in the liquid mixture in the shell and then pulled them out and shucked them cooked--just seemed easier. If I made it again, though, there are a number of things I would change re. the contents. First, there are not nearly enough clams. Four clams per person, when those clams are about the size of a nickel, is just sad. It also needed more liquid, and more thickening. So I would potentially add another half cup of clam juice with cornstarch and a little cream--maybe 1/3 cup? Plus more thyme and some black or white pepper. Because there wasn't enough volume to fill our bowls, I added some frozen corn at the last minute, which cooked perfectly in the 20 minutes in the oven. Overall, though, a nice cross between clam chowder and chicken pot pie.
