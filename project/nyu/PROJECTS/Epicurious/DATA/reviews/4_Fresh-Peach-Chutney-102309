Loved this -- served it with poached salmon and the Leek/Shiitake risotto. I added red peppers for a colorful look. A quick and colorful meal with great freshness of tastes. I'm freezing the leftover chutney to have during the winter.

Great recipe. I agree with other reviewers: cut sugar in half.

Delicious! I too halved the sugar and skipped raisins. Served as an appetizer for my Indian themed dinner and used up a jar of homemade canned peaches. Perfect!

I find it rather spooky that I located this recipe in Sep 2011 -- notice that it came from a chef at Windows on the World, the restaurant that topped the World Trade Ctr! I'll be making it this week to use up some of the local peach bounty, plan to freeze it as I don't have the appropriate kitchen for fullup canning, serve it later this winter as 9/11 chutney. Will report back on how well it holds up in the freezer.

I halved both sugars, subbed a dash of cayenne for the jalapeno, and used 1/2t of dried ginger. Reduction time after adding the peaches was 45 minutes at which point there was a bit more liquid than I'd have expected, but the taste & texture were PERFECT. This was an AMAZING topper for smoked ribs with BBQ sauce.

I love this recipe, but had to embellish. Tripled the recipe, but only doubled the sugars, added coarsely ground mustard and cardamon seeds, added red pepper flakes and serrano chiles, extra garlic and ginger in strips, and boiled syrup for 40 minutes before adding fruit. Fruit inlcuded 4.5 lbs peaches and 2/3 cup fresh black currants from the garden. Yum!

Halved the sugar, added a little cumin and mustard seed, and it was perfect. It could use a little more heat--maybe habanero pepper instead of jalapeno. I doubled the recipe and canned 6 1/2-pint jars.

Halved the sugar, per other reviewers, and it was perfect. Cannot imagine how sweet it would have been with all the sugar. Canned 16 pints to put up for winter. Yum

Thanks to the reviews here, I halved the sugar, and it it perfect. Had an abundance of peaches, now I have pint jars to give as Christmas gifts.

Oh rats! Usually I check out all the reviews before starting, but I forgot this time. If I had, I would definitely have halved the sugar, because it is too sweet. The flavors, though, are wonderful -- I'd make again.

Be not afraid of the hot water canner my friends!!! But do treat Chipotle peppers with respect...After reading all the reviews I decided to add chipotles since I like the flavor with peaches. However, be forewarned, those things are hotter than jalepenos, so be carefull. Also, keep in mind that if you are interested in canning this recipe you will need to BOIL it for about an hour. It sounds terrible, but a couple of glasses of wine don't hurt during your travails. Put the chutney in jars and process for 10min + 1min for every 1000 feet above 1000 feet sea level. Don't fret--It turns out GREAT!

Found this to be extremely sweet and not particularly flavorful. Just an observaation but 1 large red pepper yields considerably more than 1/2 cup.

When I first made this, I tasted it and wasn't overly impressed. I put it in the refrigerator, then a few days later realized I needed to use it. I simply grilled chicken breasts and cooked up some brown rice with a few wheat berries thrown in. I lay the chicken partially over the rice and topped it with the chutney. It was delicious and I'll definately be using this recipe every peach season! I'm thinking about freezing some just to see what happens.

Great dish! It went wonderfully as both a topping for chicken and for crackers (with diced rather than sliced peaches. I agree that only half the sugar is needed. It would be way too sweet with any more.

Rating: 4
Fantastic with pork! I did make some adjustments, like the other viewers--I substituted red pepper flakes for jalapenos, included some diced tomatoes with the diced pepper, and halved the amount of sugar. I also added a tbs of cumin. Delightful! Make sure to simmer and reduce for about double the time the recipe says before adding the peaches. It's summer in the south, so I increased the amount of peaches too. Note: A tiny amount of leftover chutney makes a great base for vinagrette the next day.

Does anyone see a reason this couldn't be canned? It matches relatively closely with a recipe I have that can be... Thanks!

This recipe is delicious!!! I have already made it again and again... I did cook the liquid down before adding the peaches. I also doubled the recipe and the peaches were very ripe and I had too much liquid so I jsut poured it off and cooked it down in a seperate pan. I added 2 teaspoons of canned chipole peppers for a different taste.

Nice flavor, but way too sweet for me, even after halving the amount of sugar.

This was so tasty!I made it with chicken. I added one apple to make the one and a half lbs. of fruit. I used hot pepper flakes so I could regulate the heat. My husband couldn't stop saing,"this is delicious!" I would definately make thia again. Thank you Michael.

Definitely needs to reduce for a while. Served it with bacon wrapped scallops, rumaki, and ham as part of the buffet for a luau. Fantastic!

Rating: 4
Yummy, yummy, yummy. Like others, I needed to reduce the liquid for quite a while to achieve a thickish consistency. I removed the peaches before doing this in order that they not get too mushy. I'll serve this with chicken tonight but imagine it would go well also with rich meats such as pork and duck.

Fabulous as written! So good, in fact, I am making another double batch today to can and share with family. I served it with pork tenderloin but it would also pair nicely with chicken. The only item to note is the reduction time...it took a long time to boil it down to a thicker chutney consistency. But well worth the time! Also, because of small eaters in my house, I used only 1/2 a jalepeno per batch.

I changed some of the ingredients to: balsamic vinegar v. apple cider, chipotle v. jalapeno, currants v. raisins, and added 1/4 tsp. crushed hot pepper, and WOW! The next day, I made a similar recipe with plums and soy sauce, and WOW! Great basic recipe for chutneys, just change the fruit..Warning! Let the syrup cook down to thicken the chutney..

Fabulous. Didn't use the onion. Left the rest of the recipe alone.

I was looking for a new peach chutney recipe. What makes this so poignant is that this wonderful restaurant no longer exists. I am going make this for friends as a remembrance for all those people who were lost that day in September 2001. Question: Do you think this is can be canned like any other chutney?

Rating: 4
To die for! I added the juice of one lemon and 2 tbs. of corn starch to thicken it up. Just fabulous. I gave 2 jars of it away the same day I made and and both recipients called to tell me they ate all of it up that night. No better advert than that!

I thought it was a nice compliment to chicken, but I really liked it on bratwurst! I would definitely make it again and again. It's perfect for summer barbecues. FYI, I went to my local grocer and they were out of peaches! I used canned peaches and it tasted fine. I can't wait to try it with the real thing.

This was a great served with a family favorite - chicken divan. I had some leftover pineapple and added that too. Also a pinch of cumin. Really tasty.

Really tasty recipe that let us consume a glut of peaches from the backyard. Beware that the recipe, when directions were followed to the letter, produced a very runny, thin juice that should be boiled down some for a more chutneyesque consistency.

This was tasty. I floured some boneless chix breasts then browned them and added them to the chutney mixture. I cooked everything together until the chix was cooked through. My chutney was thicker than usual but it turned about to be a good dish served with couscous. It had a nice sweet/sour flavor.

There is one word for this recipe...AWESOME!!! I've made this twice now, once with fresh peaches and once with frozen peaches. Both times it was a huge hit with my husband and our guests.

I just found this very very good. I would make it again I think Michael is a great cook

Delicious! I used peaches just picked from the tree and peeled them vs. blanching them. This one's a keeper.

Well received: served this with a spicy bbqed chicken and thought it complemented the meal very well. I added a little cornstarch to get the chutney to a thicker consistency, and I found it works just as well if you peel the peaches by hand: my Oxo peeler was faster than blanching them.

I made this dish to go with roast pork tenderloin and it was wonderful. Beautiful presentation. Definitely will do again.

Absolutely delish! Even my 82-year-old grandmother liked it! A wonderful compliment to a meal.

Jerk cooking is a staple in my house, especially in summer, and the peach chutney is a terrific accompaniment. I also tried a variation of this recipe by replacing 1/3 of the peaches with a combination of coarsely chopped fresh pineapple and mango.
