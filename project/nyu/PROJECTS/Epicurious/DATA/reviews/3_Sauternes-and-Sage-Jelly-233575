I made this with ease and success. It set up perfectly and gannered rave reviews. It is perfect for a cheese plate and quite impressive.

I didn't have any trouble with jelling. I used a late-harvest Sauv. blanc from Sonoma instead of Sauternes because that's what I had in the basement. I did use twice the sage so am rating this as written. With the extra sage it's a 4-forker. I wish I'd gone with my instincts, though, and found smaller jars. Using a precious commodity like dessert wine makes it special and it would be nice to have more, smaller jars so I could give some more of it away for gifts.

I made another batch with more sage. After six weeks it still hasn't jelled, and the flavor is just sweet and nothing else. Bah!

The sage flavor didn't come through. I ended up re-cooking with more sage extract. I'd use twice as much sage if I make this again.

Sooo good. I made it with lamb for a gourmet club and it was superb.
