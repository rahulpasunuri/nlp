Wow! Worked with a few substitutions and this was fantastic! 1. used figs instead of dates 2. after toasting the pecans I gave them a saute in butter and brown sugar with the diced figs in a nonstick pan 3. I served this as a layered presentation with vanilla ice cream on the bottom, the nut and fig topping, blood orange sorbet, more vanilla, and finished with whipped cream and the nut and fig topping. OUTSTANDING!

It is really very easy to find a dairy-free 'ice cream' in the ice cream section of your local grocery store. They come in many varieties and flavors and are really tasty. I've been substituting these soy or rice ice creams for many years for two reasons: my husband has a dairy allergy and I keep a kosher home. So you can, in fact, have your meat and eat your 'ice cream', too.

although i did not try this recipe, if you are kosher, you would not follw a meat meal with a dairy dessert!

Please stop being such biggots. Not everyone is of your faith. Just because others eat dairy with meat doesn't make us wrong, it just means we are different. This county has GOT to stop seeing other ethnic groups as 'other' or 'wrong' just becuase they do not share your views. I am horrified to see an ethnic group who was treated so badly by others in the past, be so openly game to affect that very same prejudice on other groups. SHAME on all of you.

While I respect the opinions of the writers below me, I would like to say that a non-kosher Hanukkah meal ought to be an okay thing to put out, if only for the enjoyment of non-Jews who want to participate in a millenia-old tradition. That said, these items ought to be reviewed on their merit, not their title.

Although I did read the editors note at the end of the article~ no excuse. Dairy and meat do not belong together for a Chanukah menu. Either do it correctly up front or don't print it.

I read the comments and instead of thinking like the previous two "I am so much smarter than the author" I read the rest of the article

Hmmm, pot roast and then ice cream, doesn't seem kosher to me...

Before reading the above review/comment, I said almost the exact same thing. What were the editors thinking? Maybe next year you do ham dinner with latkes on the side.

I have no desire to rate this recipe--an ice cream dessert has no place in a Jewish holiday meat-based meal. What were the editors (or the chef, for that matter) thinking?
