This tasted pretty good, but was nowhere near worth the time, effort, and money (morels!!) it took to prepare. I would not make it this way again. It's easy enough to find a delicious braised chicken with mushroom dish, and serve it with asparagus. I made it from an old Bon Appetit, and I didn't see anything about plastic wrap.

WAIT! Do not cover with plastic wrap to put in the oven! The recipe is not written this way in the magazine. It actually states to cover the pot with foil and then a tight-fitting lid. NOT Plastic....good luck. BTW, in January, dried morels cost about $200 per pound!

Back to the plastic wrap: if you used it and it was successful, what brand did you use?

I'm really curious about the plastic wrap. I used it and it melted all over the dutch oven. Am I missing something?

I was hesitant about the plastic wrap also - - it works great and is a fantastic recipe. Wonderful flavor, just marinate the night before to reduce work.

Couldn't bring myself to use plastic wrap. Thought of waxed paper. Decided on slightly buttered parchment paper. A much better choice I believe. Very good!

This is a fabulous springtime recipe. Although not for a newbie cook, this recipe will become an annual right of spring for us as soon as the morels appear. The incredible flavor combinations of the subtle lemon, thyme and the woodsy morel was just amazing.

Just wanted to add comment about plastic wrap under foil in the oven. I've done it for years, especially when baking lasagne. The cheese never sticks to plastic and other items sometimes discolor when they touch foil. So go ahead, just be sure your foil completely covers the plastic wrap.

Ummm ... where are the asparagus? And I didn't even attempt putting on the plastic wrap. Ever smelled melted plastic? Yeah ... that's what I thought. NO plastic wrap. I've taken aspects of this recipe and used them & it came out great, but I truly expected more from so called professionals!

Hmmm.... The flavor of this chicken is good if a little time intensive for what it is. Face it, chicken is a meat that will readily accept many different flavors with a little marinating. One step I totally avoided was placing plastic wrap and then aluminum foil over the pot for the second cooking. Did I not read something right here? Even at 325 degrees, plastic is going to melt, right? Just popped the foil over and that was it. It turned out fine. Has anyone else actually put plastic over the hot pot and then stick it back in the oven? Let me know what happened.

this recipe was way too much work for chicken. It took all day with marinating and preparing. Chicken should be easy. We didn't really like the flavor. I definately would not make it again.

this dish was fantastic. outrageous flavor. definitely marinate over night and the lemon flavor is not over powering. to save time I simmered the chicken on the stove for 40 minutes instead of 1 1/2 hour in the oven, came out fabulous. I would definitely make this again.
