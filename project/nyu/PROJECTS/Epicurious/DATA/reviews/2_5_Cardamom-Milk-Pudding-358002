Taste is wonderful, especially since I added 2 tsp grated orange peel. However the texture is terrible. Looks like goo. There has to be a way to make the texture more appitizing, maybe egg?

While a very simple recipe, I believe that the flavour and combined with the simplicity of making it deserve a high rating. I even left out the nuts for topping- but using green cardamom pods, I was able to get a delightful, rich, complex flavour with relatively little effort. I found it important to buy my arrowroot and cardamom online at a reasonable price, because you use SO much arrowroot. Also, I over-thickened my pudding: it is important to follow the recipes timeline and remember that once it cools in the fridge, it will be MUCH thicker. My result was rather like slime, it was so thick: but the flavour was amazing. I look forward to doing this again, and this time taking care to thicken it only slightly- getting a better result. I also recommend having the whisk handy during the second heating stage, as it helped to keep the pudding properly mixed even after putting it back on the heat. Definitely a good way to use extra milk you have on hand, and get a gourmet tasting result!
