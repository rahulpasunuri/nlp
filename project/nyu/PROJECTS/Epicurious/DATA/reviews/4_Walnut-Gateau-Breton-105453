I have Susan Loomis' book, On Rue Tatin, and found the recipe in there. When I made it this weekend, I had run out of plain flour and found SR flour worked fine (but then I've not made it with plain to compare!). I'd thoroughly recommend this cake - really simple and delicious.

Easy, elegant and fantastic. Have made it several times as an easy, affordable cake. The only tricky thing is telling when it's done. Follow the directions above and hope for the best. Oh, and DO NOT accidentally use self-rising flour. Big disaster.

I made this cake last week for a Bastille Day party. It was delicious. I used one of the egg whites for the glaze instead of another yolk. I didn't have an extra egg. I also let the cake bake an extra 5 minutes. I'm still not sure if it was quite done.
