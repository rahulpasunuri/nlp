I recently needed a vegetarian first course and remembered this dish that I made numerous times many years ago but haven't made in some time. I was reminded of just how good it is. Fresh and tasty, it's filling without being rich. As noted by another reviewer, I am careful not to use much oil on the eggplant and make certain to cut it a full 1/2- inch--not thinner. I find that I tend to use more tapenade and goat cheese than the recipe recommends so that I have a thin but consistent layer of each across the other ingredients. I, too, often tweak the parsley sauce but I always make as much as double the recipe because it's so good. It can be as thin as a vinegarette or as thick as a pesto depending on the parsley (or my mood), but either way it's a good addition to the dish. Highly recommended!

For those who feel Goat Cheese is a bit "strong" or "musty", Feta is a good substitute...

I have made this several times, but used my homemade pesto sauce because I had a ton of fresh basil, instead of the parsley sauce. I have also used both whole and crumbled goat cheese, which both worked very well. As far as serving, I have just pre-sliced the "loaf" ahead of time. It goes so fast I have not had to worry about it becoming warm or losing form!

I took the time to make the olive tapenade and the roasted pepers from scratch. Although I like the flavor combinations in the terrine, I did not care for the parsley sauce at all. I just wonder how you could incorporate this dish into a buffet table. It's much too dense for guests to cut themselves and the layers would probably separate. Any suggestions.

I've made this dish several times and every time at least two o three people ask me for the recipe. This is great for entertaining.

I brought this along for a dinner with friends, and it went over really well. The colours also look spectacular.

This was fantastic! Wonder if it would freeze well (?), or if I should just freeze the roasted veggies to help cut down on the time it takes to make it....

Last reviewer MUST have done something wrong. I've made this dish numerous times for gourmet club gatherings and it is always the first thing to get gobbled-up. The sause may not be the prettiest visually,but think about it...how can balsomic, olive oil and garlig not taste fantastic?

This recipe was quite a let down. After all the rave reviews it got on this site I was expecting something more. Since I had all the necessary ingredients ripe in my garden, making this terrine seemed like a great idea. Not! The parsley sauce definitely needs some tweaking 'cause it ain't ready for prime time. I found it bland and insipid. I added some fresh basil to try to kick it up a notch. I made this dish last week and it's still sitting in the fridge. Can't give it away. I've been cooking professionally for a long time so I know it wasn't me. This dish is too tart, too sour and too cold.

Great dish, looks terrific, easy, good flavours, make your own tapenade from a Gourmet recipe!

I have been making this spectacular terrine for years. Everytime it is the talk of the meal and every one wants the recipe.

I copied this from the magazine back in 1993 and it has been a regularly repeated item on those occasions that have called for an appetizer several cuts above the norm. We make it once or twice a year. We have increased the olive paste to 1/2 cup and have halved the goat cheese. The suggestions of additional garlic and of added mayonaise in the sauce are interesting and will try those next time.

I made this for a luncheon with a vegetarian. It didn't go over very well. And the parsley sauce came out looking like green goo. Nobody touched it except for me and my husband. It tasted allright, but I wouldn't bother with it a second time.

This terrine looks outrageously beautiful and tastes rich, complex and delicious. It's not at all difficult or time consuming to prepare if you can find bottled roasted red peppers (make sure to drain them very well) and tapenade-Trader Joe's is a good source if you have one near you. I'd suggest using the chevre-its slightly gamy taste contrasts beautifully with the other ingredients. I didn't find that the eggplant took up lots of oil, but I was careful to brush the slices very sparingly. As for the parsley sauce-terrific! It might be a tad bland in its original incarnation, but with four cloves of garlic and extra balsamic vinegar the terrine was amazing. My garlic loving guests inhaled every bite and then laundered their plates with their bread. If I could eat this every night, I would.

I found this recipe in Gourmet years ago and loved it. However the issue it was in was mistakenly given away and I had been looking for it for some time. I was thrilled to find it in your eggplant recipes. Thank you Epicurious!

This is terrific, and looks great. Feta is fine instead of chevre, and costs much less here in Australia. Has anyone made this with a different sauce? I love the colour of the parsley sauce (and I don't bother to strain it, but sometimes add mayo) but would like to do another sauce.

This dish was definitely impressive-looking, but the taste was too overwhelmed by the eggplant, olive oil, and tapenade. A little too dense.

This one is easy and looks impressive. Careful when brushing the oil on the eggplant - they absorb a lot very quickly and didn't really drain well for me. If you don't have an extra loaf pan to weigh it down, a video box fits perfectly as a base. Top with canned food or a small hand weight and you're set. Looks silly in the fridge, but works well.

Absolutely delicious! Really colourful too, and it looks impressive on the plate before you cut it up. I made my own tapenade as I couldn't find it in the shop adding a large bunch of oregano (to the tapenade) which added a good flavour. I also added roasted plum tomatoes, and used feta instead of goats cheese. Next time I make it I will use less oil though - I don't have a broiler so used a grill pan instead. The vegetables tended to soak up the oil quite a bit.

I've made this dish quite a number of times since it originally appeared in Gourmet...it's one of my favourite recipes of all time. It not only tastes sensational it looks superb. On every occasion everyone has asked for the recipe. I roast the peppers in a hot oven with the stalk cut out for 20-25 minutes then sweat them in a tea towel or brown paper bag before peeling. And I often make double the sauce.

I've had this recipe for years since it first appeared in Gourmet, and somehow forgot about it. I made it as a first course to take to a dinner party. It looked beautiful and tasted fabulous! Everyone wanted seconds, even though they knew lots of excellent food would follow. I roasted and peeled the peppers, but next time would use good quality peppers from the jar, well drained and blotted with paper towel. I found a very sharp serrated knife worked best for cutting through the eggplant.

A wonderful combination of flavours...I substituted fresh basil leaves for the tapenade and it was like a taste of late summer.

This dish is not only great tasting but makes a wonderful presentation. I sprinkled fresh chopped parsley on the plate and add a carved tomato rose to each plate. Mt gourmet club loved it.

Wonderfully flavorful and perfect for unexpected guests. I cut the cooking time down by using bottled roasted red peppers and crumbled the goat cheese instead of slicing it.Although I strained the sauce as suggested, I wonder if the additional thickness and lovely green color would enhance the presentation.

This recipe took some time to prepare, but was well worth it. It was an excellent meatless entree, and I will definitely prepare it again.
