I feel I should review this meal since I make it so frequently. It's delicious and fancy enough to serve to guests. I have made changes only to simplify the recipie. My changes include using chicken breasts that I cut into bite sized pieces. Along with straw mushrooms I add cans of Asian vegetables, such as mini corn, bamboo shoots, sprouts, water chestnuts etc. I always use lite coconut milk and lime juice instead of the lime leaves or grated peel. I cook everything in a saucepan and forget the oven part. I always start by cooking the chicken first. Finally, I serve it over rice.

This was delicious--what a sauce! I like a little heat in my curries, so I used a healthy tablespoon of the red curry paste, and a mix of Thai and sweet basil for the garnish, with a couple of chopped, dried Thai red chiles. I had dried shitake mushrooms in the pantry, so I soaked them and used a 1/2 cup of the mushroom liquid in the sauce (cut the chicken broth in 1/2). The hens had a gorgeous color from the searing/roasting, and I served this with jasmine rice. Will definitely serve for a dinner party soon!

Addendum to my review: I have made this a few times now, love it every time. I've been using bone-in chicken breasts instead because the game hens were a lot of work (great flavor, though!) Today I tried another tweak worth sharing: instead of finishing in the oven, I used my crock pot on low for 3 1/2 hours--chicken absorbed more of the flavor and it was great!! Totally recommend.

YUMMM! Ok, thankfully, I made some slight modifications according to the reviews (thank you for these, so helpful!) I used 1 Tbsp. of the curry paste at the start, and added about a half T. more as it was simmering. I, too, used the whole 15 oz. can of the straw mushrooms, and could have even put more in (will next time). I also added a bit of red pepper flakes, and since we like it hot, I cut up 2 of the Thai chili peppers (removed seeds) and put those in as well. I found the kaffir lime leaves at Whole Foods in a jar, chopped, so I had to estimate how much 3 leaves was. Instead of cherry tomatoes, I used 6 T. (approx) of crushed tomatoes. I forgot to use the basil leaves, which didn't seem to make much difference. I did use the game hens, but think I will opt for boneless thighs next time. I made the sauce in dutch oven, fried the hens in the nonstick skillet, then just threw the hens in the sauce in the dutch oven to bake. Baked for 45 minutes just to be sure they were done, and think it was just right. Did not bother with reducing at end, just served as it was, with Basmati rice--mmmm. Will repeat very soon! Made it for hubby's b-day and he raved about it the whole night :)

Exceptional. There is an easy fix to the common complaint that the sauce does not adequately penetrate the bird: put the sauce in a gravy dish and keep some of it on the side. Like others, I did the one-pot dutch oven technique, and I also could not find kaffir leaves so subbed with lime peel, and I also used regular mushrooms. The dish is great. As written, it is a very moderate curry. For those who want fire, add more fire. But for everyone else who likes their dishes mild to medium, this will be perfect. Other cooking note: I cooked for 45 mins just to make sure everything was cooked properly. Worked fine.

With four unexpected guests showing up for dinner in less than an hour, I needed something fast but delicious to serve (hey, they're my in-laws!). My gut told me that something requiring so little preparation couldn't possibly be that good. Was I ever wrong! I followed the recipe, save for the fact I didn't have straw mushrooms or game hens on hand. I used some leftover shiitakes and they tasted great and used bone-in chicken breasts. The sauce flavours were so complex and savoury - my guests couldn't stop raving about how delicious it was. I served it with steamed jasmine rice with fresh basil leaves and Thai cucumber salad. This is definitely going into the rotation; I think I will try it with pork next time and serve over rice noodles. HIGHLY recommended!

this was okay. there are much better curry recipes. The hen did not absorb the spices, and was a little undercooked. i will stick to my chicken curry with sweet potatoes.

Very good. Mushrooms gave it a nice complement, and liked the combination of flavors. Needed a little something, though, maybe more salt.

This is a go-to recipe for us ever since we saw it in the magazine. I am glad I found it on line, since my organization of recipes is pretty bad. I don't think I've ever used tomato paste, though. I like things hot, so I use the red Taste of Thai chili paste. I think that's enough. I added garlic and onion, too, as one of the other reviewers said. I think I'll try some bell peppers, too, since the color pop should be nice. This is a great dutch oven dish, and I get my game hens from a butcher and the fat isn't ever overwhelming.

Very, very good; best Thai recipe I've found on Epicurious. Added one chopped red onion, 4 garlic cloves, and the juice of one lime. The limes leaves really make it (they can sometimes be found fresh at Whole Foods if you don't have an Asian market around). Restaurant taste.

Rating: 2
This really wasn't all that great. There was so much fat to skim that it was hard to get it all. The sauce was nice until I put it in the oven over the birds and then it sort of lost the flavor. There are many other better Thai recipes, so I won't make this again.

You don't need to use so many dishes if you have a dutch oven. Fry the hens, remove, then make sauce in the same pot, add the chickens back in and throw in the oven. Also I didn't need to skim any fat off the top before reducing the sauce. Lime leaves are important.

Made this the other night for guests and just finished the lef-overs today. This recipe is outstanding! It recieved great reviews from the guests(they wanted the recipe)and was very easy to make for such complex tastes. The three changes we made were: skinned chicken thighs, they really soaked up the sauce, lemon zest instead of Kaffir leaves(hard to find where I live)and I added red bell pepper for color and taste. This will definitely be in the dinner rotation!

I made made a recipe for 2. This was a fantastic dinner. I made the suggested rice and sauteed spinach with slivers of garlic. The can of straw mushrooms that I found was 15 ounces and I used the whole can. They are so good. In spite of the ingredients the sauce was not real hot.

Didnt love this, and there are better thai curry recipes on this site (ie see the sake marinated sea bass recipe). Couldn't taste the coconut, and the tomato flavor drowned out the others.

This is a phenomenal recipe: it's easy, tastes great, and looks beautiful. I didn't have time to search for the kaffir leaves, so I used lime peel, and substituted 8oz white for the canned straw mushrooms. I also added some julienned red bell pepper, only because I needed to use it up (but they added to the pretty color). My husband asked to take the leftovers for lunch the next day, and he actually remembered to grab it out of the fridge before he left. So I KNOW it was good!

This dish is very easy to make (very little to chop) and would look great on a plate for guests. I recommend reducing the sauce longer if necessary to intensify the flavors, and pour it all over the hens. When reducing the sauce though, make sure that you do not include the mushrooms and tomato, as they are already cooked in the oven. Rice is a good idea, and I highly recommend hot pepper flakes or whole peppers (for heat) and basil (for color).

For those who have difficulty in locating Kaffir leaves, try an Indian store next time. They carry them in abundance.

Awesome dish! The family loved it! Instead of game hens, I substituted boneless chicken breasts that I grilled on the bbq on high for three minutes per side instead of bronwing in the rest of the oil, then returned to curry sauce and baked for 35 minutes. Chicken came out tender, juicey and perfect.

very good, I use chiken thighs and get raves from quests.

The sauce is dilicious, but I agree with others that the hens don't absorb the flavor. I will difinitely try the sauce with chicken. Perhaps that dish will warrent more "forks"

After having my share of great Thai food and awful Thai food at various restaurants, I was extremely pleased that this recipe was both easy and very, very good. I substituted boneless, skinless chicken breasts, because others in my household won't eat anything that (still) has any bones, and I don't think it could have been any better. I'll definitely make this again!

Good. Lots of sauce as indicated by others. I used the leftover sauce later in the week with some sauted chicken breasts and thighs and they "soaked" up the sauce even better than the game hens. I substitued regular mushrooms because I had them on hand and I've never thought that canned straw mushrooms added anything except a nice look and I'll take extra flavor any time. Also had to use lime peel, but will look for kaffir lime next time at Whole Foods Market.

I made this with chicken. Everyone loved it and thought it was a carribean recipe, as we just returned from there.

I made this last night and thought it was very nice. I do wish kaffir lime leaves were easier to come by, I had to use grated lime zest. Also could not find straw mushroom so left them out. I served this with rice and stir-fried sesame asparagus from this sight. This is a keeper.

This dish was delicious, and very subtle--each bite was different. If you are not one for highly spiced dishes, follow the recipe exactly, as the amount of curry was perfectly piquant without being overwhelming. One way of cutting the richness of the sauce is to de-grease it thoroughly. What really took the dish to the next level was the basil garnish on top--next time, I'm going chop some and sprinkle more. Also, definitely make your rice with lemon zest and cardamom, as it complements the dish quite well.

I have made this several times now, and just love it. I have yet to make it with Cornish game hens, though, using chicken pieces instead to excellent effect. Highly recommended.

Loved this. I browned chicken thighs in a dutch oven, took them out and then made the sauce in the same pot. Added the chicken back in, and let cook over low heat for about 45/50 minutes. Great tang. I used a bit more curry paste than the recipe calls for.

The hens never picked up the flavor of the excellent sauce. The recipe for us was a waste of time. Too bad, since I don't find many Thai recipes without peanuts or peanut oil.

I made this dish substituting chicken thighs and it was wonderful. So easy and with jasmine rice-yummy. Pino Grisio was a great compliment. No lime leaves available so I used the grated lime peel and I think I would double the amount for that extra zest. I also would use a dutch oven instead of the 13x9 inch dish. This is a keeper with just some minor adjustments. Donna in Pacific Grove, Calif.

I used cornish hens the first time, but it was difficult to eat. I've also used boneless chicken breasts and thighs and the outcome was great. A delicious sauce! Definitely needs rice as an accompaniment for all of the great gravy.

This was really good, I think the straw mushroom really adds more texture. I would not make it in a 13*9*2 baking dish though, I was thinking more of a dutch oven type or a deeper casserole so the hens can be covered in the juices and be more flavored.

Used Taste of Thai red curry base, two tablespoons. I was afraid it would be too hot, but the end result was delicious, spicy but not hot.

To cook from Sonoma County re Kaffir lime leaves: Yes, these leaves should be bruised before using so the flavourful oil will be more easily released. Just crumble/crush them in your hand so the smooth surface bends and cracks but the leaf remains intact. Or, fold/roll each leaf and pound it with a heavy knife handle. They may also be coarsely chopped/shredded but this method makes them harder to find and remove before serving. Hope you find these tips helpful. Cheers!

Followed recipe as directed but I thought sauce should could have been thicker. Otherwise, yummy.

Just made this last night for a nice "Oscars" supper. The only change I made was to use fresh mushrooms, just because they looked so good at the market. We loved it and would certainly make it again. I chose the recipe mainly because a friend who grows them had given me some fresh kaffir lime leaves, and I'm not sure that I tasted them. To those of you who have used them before, would it have been better if I'd crushed them slightly? Or next time, should I add more?

This was a great easy recipe. I substituted chicken quarters for the game hens. I would probably add a little more curry next time. My husband likes "hot".

Rating: 4
Nice recipe. The Tyson rock cornish game hens, which are most common in US supermarkets, taste no different than chicken, in my view, but their smaller size makes for a nice change. I added one chopped red pepper in addition to the prescribed amount of tomatoes, and used Masaman curry paste instead of red curry paste. The curry sauce is not quite as rich with light coconut milk, but this will make for a much healthier dish. If you partially debone the halved hens, it will make dining a bit easier on your guests.

This was delicious!!! The sauce was great. The hens were tender. We added more cherry tomatoes. And we used different mushrooms. We bought a mix of smaller fresh mushrooms at Whole Foods which had a nice texture and appearance. I plan to make it again for a casual dinner party next week. It was very nice with a pinot noir.

This recipe was very quick to make, attractive and worked just as written...BUT the hen flavor was disapoointment - very bland. They just didn't pick up the wonderful sauce, and there really isn't much meat. I WILL make this again, but with chicken thighs. Another slight adjustment would be to add at least twice as many tomatoes. Again, the sauce is VERY good.

I loved this recipe for two main reasons. 1) The flavors are wonderful - for company or every day dinner. 2) So incredibly simple and quick to make. I walked in the door late at 6:02 with grocery bags in one hand and my 14-month old in the other arm. By the time our company arrived at 7:02 I had this dinner ready to go, kitchen clean and table set. I've made it again already because it tasted so good and was so easy. It is defintely being added to my recipe book.

Ever since I saw it in the magazine, I had been dying to make this recipe. It was as good as I imagined. The sauce tasted and smelled just like the red curry at my favorite thai restaurant. I followed the recipe pretty closely- using grated lime peel as I couldn't find kaffir lime leaves. (go figure!). The games hens were okay, but this would be good with regular chicken parts too. 3 1/2 forks.
