First time using panko and the crust turned out a beautiful golden color. Next time, I'll salt and pepper the flour though. Made it with tenders instead of breasts and the pieces cooked super fast and made the portions more manageable, especially since I served them alongside angel hair pasta. I doctored up a jar of sauce with shallots, garlic, olive oil, lots of fresh basil and 1/4-1/2t. crushed red pepper (love the heat). Super fast and great for company. My boyfriend said he'd pay $100 for it if he were out somewhere. Paired it with an amazing Volver Tempranillo.

I have used this recipe numerous times, but I've only made the sauce once... it's pretty plain, so I just use good quality jarred sauce, and for the chicken I add salt & pepper to the flour/parm mix, and let the coated chicken sit in the fridge for about 15 minutes- that way the coating stays on when sauteeing. Very tasty.

This dish looked great, however we all found it bland. Made it just as the recipe stated and my 13 year old son's comment was that it tasted about the same as the chicken marinara from his school cafeteria!

YUM, this dish was delicious! My boyfriend loved it, saying "we don't need to eat out anymore". I used all fresh ingredients & followed the recipe. I will definitely make this dish again, although with a dash of sugar or honey added to the sauce!

I loved this recipe! Tender, tasty, and simple. I skipped the breading entirely, just melting the cheese on the chicken and smothering with sauce; it was perfect. Kickin' tomato sauce recipe as well, wonderful on a little pasta. I highly recommend.

Very good. I added a full cup of basil and an additional fresh, diced tomato to the sauce. It really brought the flavor out. Also, I pounded the chicken to 1/3 inch thick or so which really helps with making sure it cooks evenly. Delicious on top of Angel Hair Pasta.

When I tried this recipe for the first time the panko coating burned using the medium-high heat. I did not read in the reviews that anyone else had the same trouble. Next time I will try using a lower heat or even precooking the chicken before coating. Otherwise the sauce and flavors were delicious- my kids enjoyed it.

After two weeks on the South Beach diet, we decided to splurge. My husband thinks it was a four fork meal but then again, we hadn't had any carbos for two weeks so we settled on three forks. Didn't have fresh basil so used dry, and I doubled the garlic This was a really good meal. Will make again.

Four forks because it is such a great recipe. Used onion and dried spices in the sauce and serve with gnocchi. Excellent. A keeper.

I have been searching for a great chicken parm recipe and finally found it. This was great. I followed the recipe exactly.

Loved the recipe, but did a few things differently. - used 1 teaspoon dried basil instead of the fresh (didn't have fresh in the house) - used 3 tablespoons of chopped onion instead of the shallots (didn't have shallots in the house) - sliced the chicken breast into thinner pieces prior to breading and frying (makes the meat so tender) - I agree with the others, we also served pasta with the extra sauce

This dish receives four forks for several reasons: It was easy, inexpensive, plentiful, and delicious. Per other reviewers suggestions, I cooked some linguini noodles to serve with the chicken because there was a LOT of extra sauce. I also served it with brocoli rabe and parsely butter (recipe from this site).

Very delicious and easy to make. I'd agree with the other reviewers and serve with pasta to use the extra sauce.

Quick, easy, and turned out excellant. The crust, well browned, added a lot of flavor, and the steaming at the end left the chicken very tender. Even the kids loved it.

This recipe is really great - next time I will serve pasta with it, because it does make a lot of sauce. I used regular breadcrumbs.

This was pretty good. I would suggest that you pound the chicken breasts before breading them. I do this with all my chicken breast recipes. It makes them more tender and allows the flavors to penetrate better.

This was a great recipe. It had a wonderful taste to it. I especially liked how the cheese was imbedded into the breading of the chicken. I served it over pasta since there was a lot of sauce. It was quite tasty and i would definitely make it again

This chicken marinara was awesome! A big hit with the family. I made it two weeks ago and is still being talked about. Very tasty and easy to make.

This was okay, but thought the sauce was a little heavy and over powered the chicken. Made a side of pasta with it, I guess it was too much sauce for me.

Loved it. Very yummy and easy. Even made a few extra pieces for the next day and it was fabulous. Extra sauce good for next day on pasta as well.
