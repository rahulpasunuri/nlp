I'm a Mexican food lover and found this recipe in 07 and tried it. As others have said "it was a big hit" - so much so that I made it for about 5 or 6 years running for T Day and have even made it for those unlucky fam members that don't normally join us for that special day. You gotta try it...the gravy is unreal good with out turkey and cornbread dressing.

This is our Holiday Turkey favorite - so refreshingly different and traditional at the same time! My husband, kids and now guests ask for it every time, and more than a few of these recipies are now in circulation. Make it, you wont' regret it!

Wonderful use of regional ingredients and a spin on "normal" turkey. Caveat emptor...I modified this recipe! I used a bone-in turkey breast and smoked it on my smoker with apple wood. I also added a chipotle to the chile puree for the gravy for a little extra kick. It was incredible, and will be added to my recipe shortlist.

This is absolutely fantastic-- one of the best recipes I've discovered in years. I used a pork loin roast rather than poultry. The roast was beautiful and tender. We put the gravy on the meat and mashed Yukon Gold potatoes. Rave reviews all around. Do not change the gravy one iota!!!!!

Made it for a swim team function, and it was devoured.

I made this five years ago (I'm the designated Thanksgivinig Turkey preparer for the extended family and I do something different every year). Folks are still talking about it. Would I make it again? Due to popular demand, I'm doing it again this year. Fantastic!

This was wonderful!!! The Ancho Chili Gravy is outstanding and is even better with leftovers. The Turkey came out brown, juicy and very tasty. I was unable to find the achito paste and it still came out Great.

I couldn't find any dried ancho chilies, so I used dried guaillo (sp?) chilies...HOT! It turned out good though, all my guests love spicy foods. The turkey had a beautiful color to it. I made the southwest cornbread stuffing, the gravy was fantastic mixed w/it. Nice change of pace, rather than the traditional holiday turkey. Try it.

A lot of great flavors, the achiote paste gives the turkey a beautiful red golden color. The gravy was really complex and wonderful.

Great recipe. I liked mine with a few more chiles to give it added flavor; don't be worried, these chiles add flavor, not heat. Best source I found for Anchiote Paste and chiles of all types is at www.loschileros.com. I think they also have an 800 number.

This has become a Thanksgiving tradition. We look forward to it all year long. I have substituted chicken as well which works fine. The best part is the Chorizo cornbread dressing to go with it!

Achiote is available at ethnicgrocer.com. I have been making this for Thanksgiving or Christmas since the recipe appeared in 1997. Everyone loves this turkey, even picky eaters! The only thing I do differently is I add only about 1/2 of the chile puree to the gravy (I love chiles). I go by taste, otherwise the gravy is too smoky tasting. I keep thinking I should try this achiote technique with a roast chicken.

The turkey was a hit. I was not able to find the achiote paste so I had to wing it!

To break the Thanksgiving blahs, I made this with the Southwestern Corn Bread Stuffing. The achiote paste was hard to find, and I used pasilla chilies instead of poblano, but it was a HUGE hit! Seconds and thirds were had! I followed the roasting time on the turkey package instead. It came out beautifully! Just don't spill the achiote juice on your carpet!!

I made this recipe last year and it was a hit with my family. They liked the different take on the usual bird, and the smoky chile flavor really works with the turkey. I'd make it again.

I used this recipe last Thanksgiving. My husband just loved it (he's from Mexico) It was the most flavorful, moist turkey we've ever had. I'm doing it again this year. The gravy was exceptional and with a cornbread w/chorizo stuffing (cooked separately) you can't go wrong.

I am a mexican chef, and I must say that the recepie was creative and a great mix of regional chiles. I sugest everybody to try it.
