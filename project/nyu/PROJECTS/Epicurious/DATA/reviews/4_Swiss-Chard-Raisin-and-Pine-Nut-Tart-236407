Delicious exactly as written. It is a sweet dessert. Loved it, now I can serve leafy greens and add a veggie to desert. Seriously, my children look forward to swiss chard season now. I was confused at first as to whether to weigh the leaves before trimming or after. I'm convinced it is the former after trying it both ways. Make this dish, you won't regret it.

We liked it a lot (and it worked fine in a round 11" tart pan, btw) but I'd say the tart veers more toward sweet than savory. A perfect brunch dish. For dinner, I'd like to try a chard tart again with no raisins, but adding parmesan cheese and subbing lemon for orange zest.

I thought it was wonderful! I soaked the raisins in orange liqueur instead of the orange zest and I did not use a top crust. I covered it in foil. It was a wonderful side dish for our roast chicken.

I made this recipe with a mix of kale and beet greens from our CSA. Delicious flavor combination, but I wish I had followed another reviewer's suggestion and used lemon zest instead of orange zest. For me and my husband the raisins made the tart too sweet (though I didn't add any sugar) and the orange was a bit overpowering--I will definitely make this tart again, but with lemon zest and cranberries instead of raisins. However, if you're going for a sweeter version, you can probably follow the recipe as written.

Super way to use an abundance of chard from the garden. I love the versatility - it's a sweet(ish) tart with the powder sugar and a savory(ish) tart without. I used a store fridge crust for ease and ricotta instead of the cream and I'm happy with both although I would probably use even a bit more ricotta than 1/2 cup next time. And there will be a next time cuz the chard just keeps growing!

I also used rainbow chard + some spinach to make up the difference & baked it in an 11" round tart pan. Seemed a bit liquidy when pouring into the bottom crust & am glad that the instructions said to bake on a cookie sheet, otherwise it would have made a mess in my oven. Overall I felt that the orange zest & refrigerated pie crust overwhelmed the taste of the greens. Not sure that I would make this again - would probably make lots of substitutions if I do.

I made as recipe outlined. I'd skip all the sugar. I will definitely make again with these changes.

Very nice. Great way to disguise chard so that family will eat it. Worked fine with pre-made crusts from the refrigerator case and a 10" round tart pan. The raisins give it enough sweetness that it worked best without the confectioners sugar when served with dinner and best with the confectioners sugar when served as breakfast. Also best warm with dinner and room temp as breakfast. Have not tried yet as dessert.

Anyone who is a member of a CSA should download and print this fantastic recipe, because it is amazing, and uses up two entire pounds of chard in a single recipe that every person in your family will love. Make it first as directed, then substitute various ingredients on subsequent tries. Monterey jack cheese, believe it or not, can be subbed for the cream; and you can use lemon zest instead of orange. If you're making this when your CSA box contains tons of kale, then use that instead of chard, but increase the sugar. And by all means, try a whole wheat crust. This really can be breakfast, lunch and dinner, as well as dessert, in a single dish!

I usually make every recipe on this website exactly as specified but deviated a bit on this one. My chard was rainbow chard so that's what I used. I'm not crazy about raisins so I skipped the raisins. I used the frozen puff pastry from the grocery store and this recipe turned out well with the puff pastry. I used half n half in stead of heavy cream. The recipe was still pretty rich particularly with the puff pastry so next time I think I'll use regular milk. My pine nuts were pretty heavily toasted just shy of being burned. I used the heavily toasted pine nuts and the dish still turned out okay. (The toughest thing about making this dish is not burning the pine nuts.) The touch of orange zest gives it a refreshing flavor. This dish is very versatile: would be great for breakfast, appetizers, lunch with a salad and as a dessert with dinner!

My garden full of swiss chard has enabled our family to enjoy this recipe all summer. My kids (6 & 9) LOVE it and have requested it often! To save time I've opted to use a store bought frozen pie crust that comes in an aluminum pie pan. Also switched to a one-crust version that I bake with a silicone baking mat on top instead of the second crust. Perhaps its no longer officially a 'tart' this way but my family still loves it. I can make two tarts instead of one if I fill both frozen crusts with the chard filling, place filled pans on a baking sheet in the oven and cover them with a silicone baking mat. We sprinkle each serving with the confectioners sugar rather than the whole 'tart'.

Very nice, rich, flaky, crispy tart. Recipe worked well in a round 11" tart pan. I added 1 carmelized yellow onion to the filling (my raisin supply was low so I wanted to add a something for flavor) and it was very very good. It's very good hot out of the oven, no need to wait for it to cool down much. Butter Pastry Dough recipe was the perfect crust. Three forks rather than 4 because it was rather time consuming, though it was good enough and versatile enough that I'll make it again. With some practice I could see this becoming a much easier dish to make.

i reviewed this recipe previously but wanted to add that 1) raisins don't take nearly an hour to plump in hot water, more like 15 minutes; 2) if you boil chard for 10 minutes, you'll overcook it. Either boil if for a couple minutes, or wilt it as you would spinach.

Fantastic. In light of the other reviews, I tried this with a different pastry dough and made with the butter pastry dough that goes iwth the tomato onion tart (May 1995) found on this site. I increased that recipe by 50% but had a bit of extra dough.

an elegant, perfect tart. since the bunches of chard where i shop are only 1.5lbs, i use a package of frozen spinach to make the difference.

Wow! I had chard in my CSA box, and kept coming back to this recipe. I did use a different crust--just a basic crust, but with lard & butter, and I used 1/2 stone ground whole wheat flour. Otherwise, made exactly as written. I didn't dust the top, and I'm having a slice right now with my coffee. This is amazing! I feel that it's more sweet than savory, but it's a wonderful breakfast! I will definitely be making this frequently.

I was looking for a different recipe for Swiss Chard, as I was getting a little tired of saute - ing it. This was wonderful! I used a whole wheat pastry flour crust recipe I have as I like to use whole wheat - I loved the flavor of the WW in this tart. Yum! I think this would be a great vegetarian main meal, or as an addition to a Medditeranean themed meal.

i love making tarts and this was a nice alternative to the classic chard tart. not too sweet as mentioned.thought of the possibility of someone in france enjoying this during 'le tour' and dreaming of one day being there myself.
