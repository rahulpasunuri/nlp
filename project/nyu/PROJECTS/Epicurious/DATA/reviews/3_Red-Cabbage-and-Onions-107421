Great taste, provided you pair this with the salmon and gastrique. Otherwise, you'll be disappointed.

I added a couple minced shallots and a handful of very finely chopped oil-cured olives; fantastic.

Really boring. I guess cabbage doesn't have a lot of flavor to start with, but all this recipe does is get the stuff cooked. As other reviews seem to indicate, call in some flavor help for this one, or look elsewhere for a better recipe.

Great recipe! I made a bit more cabbage then called for and added bacon to it for more flavor. I substituted the olive oil for the bacon grease and it was very good. Very Easy everyone loved it!

I added an unpeeled sliced apple to the skillet, used a little bacon fat instead of olive oil and served this with a grilled pork tenderloin. Feels like October!

A good fast alternative to long-cooking sweet and sour cabbage. Served with kielbasa and sweet and sour potato salad and it was a tasty German meal. Maybe a few capers as a garnish would be nice.
