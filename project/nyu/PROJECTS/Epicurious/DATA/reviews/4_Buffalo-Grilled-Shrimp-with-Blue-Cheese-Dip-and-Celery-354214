This was very easy to make and yummy. I would make it again.

This is perfect. I like to use the crumbled gorganzola cheese and use Greek style yogurt in stead of the sour cream (makes me feel healthier). Always gets rave reviews.

Delicious, I have made this twice and it was the hit @ the party. If you love chicken wings this is a healthier way to get the same great taste. And it easy and quick to make.

Excellent! Worked well with regular shrimp on shish kabob sticks grilled for half the time. Can't wait to make it again. The leftover hot sauce and dip was perfect on a baked potato as well.

This was really great I made for friends that I forgot did not really care for blue cheese. They loved it!!!! I will send it to all my kids and foodies. I did add more of Frank's RedHot but stayed true to the recipe. Do not pass this up it is easy and a great go to dish.

I've made this innumerable times and it never fails to disappear as fast as I can plate it. Frank's Red Hot is the inimitable 'buffalo' flavor. This recipe is full of pure win.

Very good! Tossed shrimp in some garlic powder, onion salt, and a little smoked Paprika prior to grilling. Also added some cider vinager to the sauce. Overall very good, very easy and everyone loved it.

We had these for dinner tonight and they were really yummy. I made everything exactly the way the recipe called for it and we didn't feel there was anywhere enough heat. I will probably reduce the amount of butter next time and add more Franks. The blue cheese dip was really good - and we don't even like blue cheese! I put all of it in the food processor so there weren't any chunks and the flavors blended. This would be good for an appetizer or lunch/dinner.

We devoured this for dinner several nights ago. Made it as written and would have loved to have doubled it. Perfect level of spice and we are making this again tonight! Delicious!!

We loved this recipe and used the left over blue cheese sauce on lots on veggies after the shrimp got eaten up. The buffalo sauce is perfect. It wasn't as heavy and drowning of the shrimp as is often the case when buffalo anything is ordered in a restaurant.

I am not a big fan of HOT but these hit the spot! Peeling and prepping shrimp is something I do every other week or so. I do the double skewer thing to make them easy to handle on the grill. I wimped out and used a bottle of prepared blue cheese dressing & dip. I also put a splash of red wine vinegar into the butter & hot sauce. Fresh succotash of local limas and corn kernels with a bit of pasta completed the meal.

Yum, yum, yum!!!! I did not know what to think of this until I read the reviews so I decided to bring it to a party. It was a hit! Everyone devoured them quickly. The blue cheese dip is amazing! Definitely will make again!

My family ate these up. I used a little less butter with good results.

I made the dressing without the parsley and added onion salt instead of regular salt. I also modified the buffalo sauce a little as below with 1 tsp honey and 1 tsp apple cider vinegar. This is excellent with grilled shrimp! Yum!!!!!

Sorry the 1st review didn't come out right. To enhance the shrimp brine it for 30min. basic brine solution.

Made this on the 4th of July, grilled on stove top grill pan, and was absolutely delicious!! Would maybe cut back on the butter slightly.

I made this tonight as a light dinner for my wife and me. Followed the recipe to the letter and it was excellent. I was able to find Frank's RedHot hot sauce at my local store. I will certainly make this again.

This was a huge hit at a bbq this weekend. Added a little mayo to the dip and extra blue cheese, lots of black pepper. Added a little honey, garlic, and apple cider vinegar to the buffalo sauce. Outstanding! I'm not a fan of skin on chicken, so usually avoid buffalo wings even though I love the flavors. Now I will make this shrimp instead!

This was really good and really easy! I did not care for the parsley in the dipping sauce. The second time I made this I bought a good quality blue cheese dressing and added the green onions and extra blue cheese crumbles - much better!

So easy and so good! They went very fast!

Outstanding!!

Excellent recipe! I was afraid that the pepper sauce would overwhelm the shrimp, but it was PERFECT. I ran short of sour cream for the dip, made up the difference with buttermilk & was happy with the result.

I have been making these for years. Thought it was my own little secret. I am addicted to buffalo wings which I cook on the grill in almost the same manner but opt for shrimp when I want something more healthy. Delicious!

OMG! Why didn't I think of this before? I love this recipe and I always have these ingredients on hand--minus the celery but I never eat that anyway! I will make it again and again. Much easier than deep frying wings. The dip recipe was pretty good as well.

Great recipe and very easy! We used blackening seasoning instead of salt and pepper, which "kicked them up a notch"!!! The recipe is most definitely a keeper.

Totally underestimated how tedious and time consuming prepping the shrimp would be but the end result was fantastic and well received at my dinner party.

YUM! Why did I never think of this before? We happened to get colossal jumbo shrimp (4/lb), and tossing them in the buffalo sauce was fabulous. I don't love bleu cheese, but appreciated how easy this dip was. Would definitely make this again.
