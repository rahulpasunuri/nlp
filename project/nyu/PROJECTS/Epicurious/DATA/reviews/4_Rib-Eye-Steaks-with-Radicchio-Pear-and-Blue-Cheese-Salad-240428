The salad was delicious (even my Dad loved it and he doesn't like salad!) but the steak was very plain. Obviously, it's just salt and pepper. I would have done a marinade to pair with the salad. Worth it for the greens! :)

Simple and delicious.

The salad really makes this dish. I let the shallots soak for five minutes with the vinegar in a mortar and pestle and then added a wedge of the pear and blended it into the vinaigrette before adding the oil and honey. Overall, it was a nice alternative to heavier sides that usually get offered with steak. We'll do this one again.

The recipe as written is excellent, and I highly recommend it. I have also adapted it to a quick mid-week meal or weekend lunch by using leftover steak, sliced, and placed atop the salad with the blue cheese. I use the store prepared mixed greens in this case, omit the radicchio, use the pear if I have it, and add dried fruit, walnuts or sliced almonds as my mood dictates.

I make this CONSTANTLY. It is one of the best dishes on this site BY FAR!! Don't alter it a bit unless you can't find a ripe pear. In that case, an apple substitutes nicely!

This recipe is incredible and SO EASY. I cook a lot of steak and nothing has ever turned out so well. I seasoned the steaks and let them sit for about an hour before cooking. Also, I substituted arugula for radicchio. The dressing has the perfect acidity and sweet to go with the steak.

Delicious! I made it just as described in the recipe. It was company quality food but was incredibly easy to put together. These flavors just go together so well that with quality ingredients you can't go wrong.

I would recommend mixing the dressing in a small bowl and adding it to the greens, instead of adding the greens to the dressing, in case there's more dressing than you want to use.

I have made this recipe many times and it's fantastic. It's fast, easy and impresses guests as well. I also have varried the kind of pear used and cuts of meat. This one is a keeper!

This is one of our favorite recipes. I make the salad on its own all the time and vary the cut of steak - works with all cuts of steak from flank steak to tenderloin.

Cannot beat a good, simple steak paired with a fantastic salad. Loved the light dressing. I used white wine vinegar--that's what I had on hand and it worked well. Added toasted walnuts for some crunch. Did not have comice pears so I used Bosc. Apples would be great too. Craved same salad next day--so good!
