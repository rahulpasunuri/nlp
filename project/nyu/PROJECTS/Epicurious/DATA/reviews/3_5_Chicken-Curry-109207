Ok I saved the recipe, heat oil in a 12 to 14 inch skillet 2 to 3 inches deep.... I read this as 2 to 3 inches of oil. Mind said... This is not deep fried. I was already cutting the recipe back for two. So I only used 1/4 c oil. The onions were yummy. So was the curry.... Just didnt use the excess oil at the end. The called for 2 Tbsp ofmoil would have been better. The spice combination was wonderful. Subtle, flavorful and deep with just a hint of heat. I think part of the spice problem some had is that in the USA we think of chile powder as that mix that we use for barbecue, texmex, etc. Pick the right one and you can make a mighty fine chili. And chili heads will dazzle you. However as a general rule when I make anything Indian, southeast Asian or mexican I use some appropriate version of pure chili powder. I used pure ancho chili powder in this recipe which added the deep depth of flavor and a mild heat.

This was exception and pretty easy to make. Yes, a little labor intensive but not complicated. We loved it. Only thing I would change is adding a little more spice to kick up the heat a bit if you're into that sort of thing. Enjoy!

This dish was excellent. I made two modifications based on the common complaints listed in various reviews: 1) Not spicy enough--for this, I chopped up a serrano pepper and blended it with the garlic and ginger for the chicken marinade. This made for a mild to medium spice. You can add more chiles depending on your preference and tolerance for heat. 2) More bland than the ingredients suggested--the key to changing this is not adding more spices, but adding them at the right time. If you add them to the onions, bay leaves and oil and cook for a couple minutes before adding the chicken and marinade, the oil will absorb much more of the flavor from the ground spices, and will greatly enhance the flavor of the curry. This worked great for me, and is the key for getting the most out of any curry. What I'd do different next time: I'd add less salt, as this recipe could have done with about half of what was called for. Also, I'd make more of the sauce to reserve for pouring over rice and for soaking naan.

I followed the recipe, but found it too mild for my taste before serving so I added a tablespoon of red cuury dissolved in hot wated to the pot. No sense in argunig about whether a recipe is too bland because it is personal...not an absolute! I have another chicken curry recipe I prefer so I'll stick with it for now.

Great recipe but light on the spices, I found it to be too mild. I added a little ceyenne pepper and that did the trick. I have made it numerous times since!

Doesn't quite taste as good as it smells. I used high quality spices and the ground cloves, cardamom and cinnamon smelled heavenly, but the taste didn't have the same punch. I enjoyed the dish, but thought it could have used some more heat, and more spice in general.

Absolutely delicious. A bit labor intensive but by far the closest I've ever come to restaurant quality curry chicken, and I've been trying for years. I was generous with the garlic and ginger, and I skimmed the fat before boiling the sauce. Served with jasmine rice, pappadums and Indian beer. My husband wants me to double the recipe next time to ensure plenty of leftovers!

this is a simple but wonderful recipe that makes a great, tender chicken curry. I make it with boneless thigh pieces I get at the supermarket. Really good the next day, maybe better.

Very good, and relatively easy. Didn't bother to separate drumsticks from thighs. Used only 1/2 recipe, but kept the seasonings in original amounts, and added 1/8 tsp. cayenne to the marinade. Nonfat yogurt worked fine, as did yellow onion. Delicious with the Spiced Saffron Rice. Second time, didn't skin the chicken. Still good. After removing it from sauce, emptied a bag of frozen vegetables into sauce, covered and cooked them until tender, about 4 min. Removed with slotted spoon, stirred 1/2c. chopped cilantro into veggies, and resumed sauce reduction. Delicious.

It's a delightful dish. I used mild (yellow) curry powder instead of the chili powder, and came out with a dish the whole family loved. It really doesn't need any extra 'heat' at all.

Very tasty! Those who found it bland likely weren't using very fresh spices. The flavor was complex, without one spice overwhelming the others. I did make a few fat lowering modifications - non-fat yogurt and boneless skinless chicken breasts - and it was still very rich. Only complaint was that it had no heat in the spices and next time I'll use a hot chili powder rather than mild.

Very blah. There are better curry recipes out there.

I made this for dinner last night. GONE! Plates were licked, etc, followed recipe to the "T". Jasmine rice is great with this!

This was excellent! I served it to a friend who lived in India for a while and he couldn't get over how good it was. I served it with basmati rice, indian potatoes (which I will omit next time) and mango lassis. I also picked up some naan to go with it. I am looking forward to making it again!

I used skinless thighs, chicken was tender. Made as recipe called for and really felt it was dull. Added extra onion, 2 lg. blanched chopped fresh tomatoe, increased chili pwd to 1 tbsp., 1 tsp. cumin seeds (ground), 1 tsp. green thai curry paste, fish sauce instead of salt,flavour was much better. However, very unattractive dish. Fresh lime over top as served greatly improved the dish. I do no believe a recipe should need so much fixing. However, in the end my husband enjoyed.

Everyone in my family liked this chicken. That is very rare.

Finally made this tonight for dinner. Simple to prepare and just wonderful!!! Changed nothing. Used fresh homemade full cream yogurt - and top quality fresh spices are a must! For us it was a really special dish and is now in the "Family File of Favourites" - Have noted some of the suggestions previously posted and will try those out soon, too!

I work with a girl from India and had her look at this recipe prior to making it, she said that the ingredients are correct and requested that I bring her a sample. She thought it was delicious, as did my whole family. We'll have this again and again. Thank you!

OK and edible, but definitely not the best chicken curry recipe I've used.

Rating: 3
this was a wonderful dish- the flavors were complex, but not overwhelming. I didn't reduce the sauce very much- used it over the basmati. My entire family loved it and insisted that it become one of the staples..

There's a fair amount of prep work with this recipe, but IMHO, it's worth it. Good curry flavor without being overwhelming . . . and not expensive, either.

This is the first recipe from Epicurious that I will be be deleting from my recipe box. I followed the recipe exactly, and although the chicken was tender, the taste was terribly bland. I was especially disappointed, as I adore Indian food. Whenever I cook one of your recipes for the first time, I cook only for my husband and myself, or with a friend who knows she is my culinary guinea-pig. We all agreed it was not to be repeated.

This is easy and delicious! I used chicken breasts instead of legs. The marinade was enough for 4 (skinless) chicken breasts. Since there are only 2 of us in the family, I had enough left over for chicken salad next day. Wonderful in a sandwich!
