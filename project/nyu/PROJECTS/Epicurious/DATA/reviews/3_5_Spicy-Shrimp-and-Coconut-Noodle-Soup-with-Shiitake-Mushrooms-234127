If you skip the shrimp, add veggies and amp up the heat, the fresh ginger/garlic combo makes it the perfect curative for a vegan's winter colds. Added steamed potato chunks, green beans & cabbage, and sauteed in a red bell pepper. I made paste from scratch and subbed 1/2 jar (1/4C) commercial red chili paste for the fresh chili, plus added 1T chili powder and 1/4 cayenne at the end (and it still came out only slightly spicier than my local takeout version). Gorgeous colors, satisfying and a huge hit with my vegan family!

Very good, but time consuming. Leave the lemongrass in larger pieces so it's easier to remove when serving it.

I've been using this recipe for years and everyone loves it. It turns out great as it's written and also takes well to substitutions. I often leave the noodles and shrimp out and load the soup up with vegetables simmered in the coconut broth (broccoli, carrots, cauliflower - whatever is in the fridge) for a light and healthy dinner. As good as the curry from my favorite Thai spots. Highly recommended!

If you are looking for a great Thai soup recipe, you must try this. It's truly oustanding - my husband's favorite meal. It is time consuming, and you don't want to skimp on any of the steps - but it will be a special meal each time you make it.

Made to recipe with the caveats of using shrimp tails instead of shells because I purchased the wrong product and adding a Tbsp of soy sauce at the end instead of salt. The end result... excellent.

We thought the coconut milk and peanuts overpowered this dish. If we were to make it again I'd add more ginger (or galangal), garlic, kaffir, lemongrass, and lime juice. Also I would use a fresh thai chili rather than a dried one, giving it a brighter flavor. Fresh tomatoes might give it a bit more acidity. Lastly, I'd either omit the peanuts or use them as a garnish on each bowl. Overall I'd give it a B-.

This was superb even with quite a few substitutions and omissions. I omitted the kafir lime leaves, had only 3.5 oz of shiitake mushrooms and 2 cups of coconut milk. I added 2 cups of chicken stock in place of the coconut milk along with a little half and half. I also substituted chicken stock for vegetable stock. I also did not have green onions and used parsley instead of cilantro (I probably wouldn't do that in the future.) With all that, it was a wonderful filling soup.

Having been to Thailand 8 times and eaten my through most of Bangkok I can say the one thing that characterizes nearly every Thai dish is distinct, bold, clean and uncompromised flavors. Ive so fallen for Thai food I grow my own; ginger, galangal, kaffir lime tree and lemon grass. There are no suppliers of fresh Thai produce so its nearly a necessity here in central Iowa. I followed the recipe exactly as written using freshly harvested ingredients and I found the flavors muddy and muted. I can only imagine this is what Thai dish water tastes like. I had such high hopes for this dish, Im so disappointed. If only I could give it zero stars.

This is an awesome recipe. It is a time consuming recipe, but well worth it if your like Thai foods. I have made the following changes in the recipe and have made it many times!! I used 2 cans of coconut milk, 4 c. of chicken broth, 1tbs. lemongrass paste (found in the fresh produce section in a tube); skipped the lime leaves; added 2 tsp. of Sriacha Sauce and left out the red chillis. I also used the thin rice noodles but only 6 ounces and liked it much better.

Just made this soup and it was fantastic (though I hesitate at exceptional). As much as I enjoyed it, it took two hours to make (included cleaning up as I went). I will follow some of the shortcut tips on my next try. I also did not have access to Kaffir Lime leaves, and left them out. I used cashews rather than peanuts, and they worked well. I felt the soup really did need the nuts for added texture.

This soup was fantastic. We skipped the part about adding the shells and didn't strain anything. We also used the skinny little rice noodles instead of larger flat ones. We also didn't put in kaffir lime leaves, because they don't carry that at our grocery store.

Fully agree with the previous comment- I used 'bought' thai curry paste and it was great. Also halved the amount of coconut milk - not exactly low cal, but easier to justify on a week night.

Really fragrant and delicious. If it is too time consuming, here's a shortcut that worked very well for me. Instead of making the spice paste from scratch you can substitute a couple of teaspoons of the Thai red chili paste that most large grocery stores sell in the Asian foods section. It's a very close match to the recipe and it cuts the preparation time by more than half.

I've made this dish twice now, and it was great both times. A little time consuming, I wouldn't do this on a weeknight, but worth the effort.

I have tried over 12 different recipes for tom kha goong and this is the BEST one ever, by far! I didn't include the noodle but rather cooked up a batch of rice to accompany the dish and it was perfection.
