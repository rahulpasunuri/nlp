This was tasty, a good recipe. I served as the main course for lunch and I wished it were more visually appealing - I'm not sure what would help. Maybe wait til it cools to room temp before tossing in the mint / parsley / lemon so it's not wilted from the heat. But I'm not sure flavors would distribute as well. I really liked the flavor but more for a side dish than a main lunch meal.

i made it with cilantro instead of parsley and tomato sauce instead of tomatoes - great! i didn't use cabbage at all. served hot with mango curry chicken and bombay potatoes -- yum!

Would not make this recipe again as is. Didn't really like the taste of mint. Will try again but make the flavour more garlicky and just include parsley but not the mint. Maybe add in some chopped anchovies but not sure if this would make it non-low-fat. Pretty good for low fat though.

Wish that there was a 2-1/2 cause it was somewhere between good and delicious. Didn't have fresh mint so used out of jar. May not have tried it either if I wasn't looking for a healthier, low fat alternative. Its a keeper.

This dish warrants my favorite buzz words: delicious, easy, nutritious. My next culinary project is finding a use for the rest of the cabbage head.

I just started Weight Watchers and was looking for a tasty, low point dish. This was amazingly good and the whole recipe was only a few points. I wouldn't have tried it if I wasn't dieting, but I will make it again! Don't forget the mint - it made the dish!
