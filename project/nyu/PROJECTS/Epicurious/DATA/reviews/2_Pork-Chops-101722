To the "boy cook from Orange, Ca", yeah, I have a MUCH better grilling recipe. No joke. Melt together some butter and garlic, add a couple dashes Worchestershire and the juice of about a half a lemon. Pour that over the chops and let them sit for about 30 minutes. Scrape off any congealed butter mixture and grill, basting with the butter mixture. My family begs for chops made this way. No joke.

I can't believe this is a James Beard recipe. Like many other reviews this is a joke and not a recipe. You might think this a joke but I've been grilling pork chops for years and always get raves. So simple, rub pork chops bone in or out with olive oil, Lawry's seasoned salt and freshly ground pepper. If you have something better let me know!

If you are ready to try something bold and unexpected, Substitute garlic salt for the salt. It will be a hit!

Granted this is a basic but instead of salt and pepper try badia all seasoning or paul prudhomme's meat magic. Sometimes when you have good side dishes less is more on the meat side.

Very versatile sauce. I tried the 'pepper and salt' technique while frying a couple of eggs with remarkable results. (Next week I'm looking forward to trying another egg recipe that suggests removing them from their shells prior to frying.) So simple. Be sure to kill and butcher the pig _before_ cooking or it becomes very messy & wasteful. My children had nightmares for weeks but my husband loved the recipe! Goes well with a nice glass of dihydrogen oxide, which is equally simple to make.

I made this for my husband and he loved it. I also made it for my mother-in-law, my sister, her friend Angelique, Angelique's mothers daugters friend who was home recovering from a nasty fall while skiing in Aspen. Then there was Uncle Ladlee, and his boyfriend Tray, their dog, Mr. Tootle's, and a street person (never learned his name!)who came right in from the street because those darned pork chops smelled so good. Everyone raved!

Okay, James Beard's recipes listed here get a good going over by folks. They are more of historical interest than anything. I agree that this one is particularly bad because he doesn't give us a timeframe, temperature settings- he doesn't even give us a cooking method! What, do I boil these? And those portions! I don't think Fred Flintstone or Tony Soprano could handle two of those bad boys! Now I know why Beard looked more like Orson Wells than Jack Lalane. But James Beard is not being done justice by this recipe. I still use his fish book quite a bit, and my wife loves "Beard on Bread." But yeah, this is a lame recipe.

This recipe is very simple and to the point. Some people have to realize that there are very young people out there that need very simple recipes. My sister for example is a pre-med student. She can't boil water, but thanks to this recipe she can now make pork chops.

Interesting mix of flavors. I've never paired salt and pepper together before. Look forward to trying this in other recipes.

This is a classic example of how easily we used to cook! Two thumbs up for simplicity...not that I don't love all the new sauces and condiments. Nowadays, those are the uniques touches that keep forty years of cooking for a family fun, tolerable and varied. Thanks for the laugh with all the other comments! Dee

Didn't Have Salt. Didn't Have Pepper. Didn't Even Have Pork Chops! Ordered Pizza. Would Definitely Do The Same Again!

I wanted a simple recipe to go with the Grainy-Mustard Mashed Potatoes with Sausage in the March '01 issue of Bon Appetit. Did I find it, or what?!!!

In 1956, pork chops had more fat on them. This flavored the chops. Today's lean pork needs a little more flavoring.

The recipe should have been a little more exact on certain things. For instance at what temp should we cook the pork chops at.

Yes, it's just common sense, and everybody knows how to fry a pork chop. But consider that this recipe was published in 1956. It has that sweet, nostalgic quality that reminds me of my mom, standing at the stove in a shirtwaist dress and a frilly apron, making dinner for the family. I loved the recipe as a little piece of my childhood, before we were all so impressed and intimidated by food. Forty three years ago, it was pretty much just food. PS - if you like old recipes, the Epicurious search works by year, starting with 1956. Many old James Beard recipes like this one.
