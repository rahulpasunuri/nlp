I did a ton of things different from the recipe. I boiled the potatoes with a cup of sugar, sea salt, and a large pinch of pie spice. I used half the butter, an extra egg, 2% milk, added cayenne pepper, apple pie spice, orange zest, and cracked white pepper. The crystallized ginger was fabulous! I made the topping different, too. I used roasted, salted pecans, tossed them with orange zest, raw sugar, and cinnamon then added oats. They were rich, creamy, flavorful, delicious, amazing, magical... Everyone raved about this dish! And by the way I butchered the recipe, I'd say its hard to mess up. LOVED IT!

This was the hit of our Thanksgiving dinner. Three potatoes didn't seem like enough, so I used five. Came up to the top of the baking dish. This was fabulous - I wanted to eat it for dessert, too!

Fabulous! I host Thanksgiving dinner for my family every year, and they always tell me that I can add something new, but I can't take anything away from the menu. This Sweet Potato Streusel was my new recipe this year, and it was a winner. We will be having this again soon. The leftovers are awesome, too!

So delicious!! I made it exactly as stated in the recipe. While I was skeptical of the coconut flakes, I didn't find them overpowering. This was the most raved about item for Christmas dinner two years in a row. And I'm about to make it again for Thanksgiving.

This dish is a dessert (I didn't realize that until I ate it). It is really good, but should served warm. Sorry if I sound inexperienced, but I didn't realize both of these things when I read and made the recipe. I got a request to make it again (for a friend's Christmas meal) so I know it is very very good!

This dish was a big hit at Thanksgiving. I steamed the potatoes (instead of boiling them) and left out the nuts from the topping. Turned out FABULOUS. Really liked the coconut in the topping. Will definitely make this part of my holiday menu.

Delicious! I usually am not a fan of sweet potato dishes at Thanksgiving dinner, but this one has fabulous flavor - the coconut, pecan and ginger are great additions. I doubled it in a 9x13 and it worked fine.

p.s. looking back at the recipe I realized that I did purposely omit the 1/4 c. sugar in the filling and am glad that I did - could not imagine them any sweeter....

I made a double batch of these potatoes today for a potluck Thanksgiving lunch at my son's school. They were such a huge hit, I promised to send the recipe out to the entire class and teachers. OMG do NOT leave out the crystallized ginger - it makes it! If your local markets don't carry it, try Trader Joe's, or just Google it and order it online. I may leave out the coconut when I make it for my family but other than that, it's literally the best sweet potato dish I've come across. p.s. I had to leave out the pecans due to family nut allergies.

This dish was the hit of the Thanksgiving day dinner. I used ground ginger instead of crystallized. Simply delicious.

Several guests asked for the recipe to these delicious potatoes! I cut down on the sugar in the sweet potato filing since the streusel topping is sweet and I didn't add the crystalized ginger. This will be a staple at every Thanksgiving dinner from now on!

We've used this recipe with several different groups of people. Even people who don't ordinarily like sweet potatoes have had second helpings.

great dish - especially for anyone who insists they HATE sweet potatoes!
