Incredible recipe with a few tweaks. I prefer using half and half or heavy cream, rather than water. Or a mixture. It depends on how thick you would like it. And I would use Kosher (or Sea) Salt. The fennel is an exceptional combination with the squash. If you would like, you can also use 1/2 butternut squash and 1/2 acorn squash. It's very good with those changes. I had no trouble with the fennel chips. I made this in a high altitude place and it only took 45 minutes. They weren't messy or anything. Just cut them VERY thin and make sure to pat them dry before you put them on the Silpat.

Super great, really easy, and you can make this as thick as you want.

This is an easy, delicious soup. I used vegetable broth, added salt and pepper, substituted olive oil for half the butter, and skipped the chips. Everyone loved it!

This is really good. The flavor is quite special. If you want a knockout winter squash soup this is the one to try. I made it exactly as written. It's fast and easy. Use an immersion (stick) blender right in the pot to puree, much easier and tidier. Wow!

perhaps it was the fennel I used but I had difficulty making crisp chips for the topping. Cut lengthwise mine looked like spiders and added nothing to the soup. stored in a plastic container on a shelf, they lost all crispness the next day. I like the combination of fennel and butternut squash but would skip the toasted fennel and use fresh toasted bread cubes.

Made this recipe for a church supper. A total hit. Will make it again and again for family and friends.

I have made this several times. The soup is very easy and hard to mess up. The chips take time but are very worth it. I find the process messy, but that might just be me.

I have made this soup many times - it is my favorite squash soup. The fennel and anise give it great depth of flavor. The first time I followed the recipe, but every other time since I've used boxed squash broth, and it tastes just the same with way less work. Put the extra effort instead into the fennel chips - they are what make this soup so special. (And, I use plain old parchment paper instead of a silpat mat - works just fine that way, too.)

I was skeptical about making this soup, but love pureed soups, and the reviews were great. I was really surprised at what a delicate flavor the fennel added to the squash. I only had one small fennel bulb on hand, so I used the stalks and leaves in the soup (which made for a beautiful contrast against the orange) and saved the bulb for the chips. I also added a sweet potato. I would give it four forks, but my husband just said it was good, not great.

I don't comment as often as I should, but this recipe prompts me to pipe up. This is exactly the sort of "find" I treasure on epi--- simple, with a sophisticated twist [I also thank the candid Indianapolis cook for a great shortcut]. Having made these fennel chips, I'm envisioning lots of variations for my new Silopat, purchased on faith for this recipe and glad I did.

This dish was delicious!

I have made this recipe twice and is now a family favorite. You could always add more aniseed and red pepper for a little added spiciness.

This was wonderful soup the first time and maybe even better tonight after being frozen for a couple of weeks. I used butternut squash and a stick blender. Easy, quick and delicious.

I highly recommend this soup. The anise packs this dish with flavour and gives it a twist that's very original. The soup is now a family favourite and always a hit with guests.

I found this recipe a little lacklustre. Not bad, but after the other reviews, disappointing!

My guests love it. I am making for the 3rd time this year. You can short-cut by substituting Prepared "Imagine" Creamy Butternut Squash soup and adding fennel and etc. to it. I have done it both ways and both delicious. The fennel chips make the dish!

A wonderful soup, which compliments many dishes, but, oddly, tastes worse the day after. In the future I would add more water to achieve a soupier consistency (the recipe is quite thick, and for the summer or spring, too much). Absolutely wonderful with sourdough bread!

Excellent. The fennel flavor is sweet and very delicate; it just sort of adds a twist to the conventional squash soup. I didn't expect to like it nearly as much as I did!

The soup tasted wonderful! I had some problems with the fennel chips though, they took longer in the oven than described. My boyfriend gave it 5 stars out of possible 3! I will definitely make it again but start with the chips beforehand.
