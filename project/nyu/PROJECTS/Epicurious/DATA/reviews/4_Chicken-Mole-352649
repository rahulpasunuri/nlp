Great recipe. I decided to dress this up a bit further and when I served I put sweet plantains at the bottom of the soft taco shell and added an assortment of red green and yellow peppers. I tried with and without cheese and thought that it was good both ways.

So yummy! I cut back on the orange based on the other reviews, but I feel like the dish would have been even better with the recommended amount of citrus. I used bittersweet chocolate instead of the Mexican chocolate. I think a dash of cinnamon would have helped to compensate. Can't wait to try this again with the changes.

Taza Chocolate makes the perfect chocolate for this'recipe. trader Joe's also carries disks of Mexican style chocolate.

Wow! This is so delicious! I agree with the other reviewers about the orange and I'm glad I read those prior to making the dish. I used one cup fresh orange juice and 4 cups broth with only one 1-inch orange peel and it came out perfectly! Also, for those of you who don't have a scale, 4 oz of peppers is about 5-6 dried peppers. I used five large-sized ones of each kind and it worked out great. A dolup of sour cream is all you need! Yummmm!

Delicious! We used chicken tenders (breasts) instead of thighs but the richer flavor of the thighs would have worked well. Browned the tenders only lightly. Used less hot chile: about 3/4 oz dried chiles (unknown type from the pantry!), as the invited company don't care for hot spices. Used the zest from 2 oranges, carefully avoiding the pith, this was about 1/4 of the amount called for. Used Baker's semisweet chocolate plus about 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Otherwise, we followed the recipe as written. With 2 cooks, it took us about 2 hours to make the recipe plus the side dishes; this included washing dishes along the way and setting the table. You could taste the chocolate, orange zest, almond, cinnamon, and other spices distinctly but none of the flavors overwhelmed the others, rather they made a very pleasing blend. The level of sweetness was just right (not very sweet). It was too mild for the one person who likes spicy food, but as mentioned above, this was intentional. The chicken was slightly dry but acceptable. We served this with flour tortillas, rice, home made refried black beans, and a salad. We set aside some sauce without chicken for the one person who doesn't care for chicken, the sauce was delicious mixed with the rice and beans. We used chicken broth for the mole and refried beans, but a well flavored vegetable broth would have been tasty, too, if we wanted a 100% vegetarian option. I'm sure it will freeze well, but you need to make a lot, as it's so delicious people were taking extra helpings even when they weren't so hungry any more.

WOW - this Mole is spectacular! Complex flavors that play off the various taste bud zones (I actually loved the hint of orange with the cinnamon of the mexican chocolate but might scale back on the orange peel a little next time). I didn't find it to take that long and we really enjoyed it - it's definitely a new staple and one that I will love sharing.

I took cues from previous reviewers and cut down on the orange (I juiced one very lovely tangelo, which gave me about 1/3 cup), and, being afraid of overly sweet-tasting savory dishes, I also subbed the mexican chocolate for 70% dark chocolate and a little cinnamon. My mother had Ibarra mexican chocolate in the pantry growing up, and I remember it being very sugary, so I didn't want to risk it. So that said, this mole (my first) was very, very good, and I'm glad I made the modifications that others suggested.

One of the best thing I've ever made and I've been cooking gourmet meals for 25 years. The only things I did differently were: I had ancho chiles in stead of pasilla and negro; I added 2 canned chipotles (I'd started with a different recipe that called for those) and didn't have mexican chocolate so used a combination of unsweetened ghirardelli and ordinary toll-house chips. I think the bit of extra sweetness was really worth it.

I'd like to make this recipe,but I'm confused about pasillas vs negros. Many sites say they are the same (including the dictionary on this site!) Some say pasillas are related to bells, and others say poblanos are incorrectly called pasillas. Can anyone elucidate me as to the real difference and what I should really look for?

We've made this recipe 7 times so far. Have eaten many different chicken moles, and this is our favorite. Made this the 1st time exactly as written. Hated the orange.So,we've simply left the orange juice and peel out of each batch since.We made a double recipe yesterday,and used shelled pumpkin seeds. I was out of almonds. We add a few more negro chilies to spice it up to our taste. This mole freezes well. Takes about 2-3 hours to make, with 2 people.Worth it!

My whole family loved this. I used mandarin oranges, figuring they would be a little less bitter, and they were perfect. This recipe actually made far more sauce than we needed for the amount of chicken called for, so next time I will sauce the chicken separately and freeze the balance before it hits the meat.

i am a vegetarian and was given some pasilla chiles, and was looking for something to do with them - so excited to find that they're a key ingredient in mole! i adapted this recipe skipping the chicken prep, using strong vegetable broth instead. simmered a bit longer to reduce the liquid, and it was so delicious! I used mostly cocoa powder and a few semi-sweet chips and cinnamon instead of mexican chocolate (i didn't have any) and omitted the orange peel as recommended. made enchiladas with poblano peppers, black eyed peas (New Years Day Leftovers) and seitan. fantastic!! Would definitely make this recipe again!

Full disclosure first - I have only ever had bites of mole off my husband's plate when he has ordered it in restaurants, so I knew I was at a disadvantage going into making this because I didn't really know what I was striving to replicate (he LOVES mole). My impression, and his, was that this recipe as written has too much orange flavor. So, I think when I make it again I'll skip the orange peels or just use less juice/peels overall. I also used ground spices instead of seeds, and could only find pasillo chiles, not negra. We ate the chicken and sauce wrapped up in fresh tortillas, but i think next time I'll make enchiladas. Overall, a complex and flavorful dish but needs some tweaks.

This is a great mole. I've made it several times. Usually make it exactly as is, except for the Mexican chocolate. I never take the time to pick up specifically "Mexican" chocolate, but use 70% dark and add a little cinnamon. Tonight I had a few of my home grown pasilla peppers, so I roasted and seeded them (left the skin on). I threw them in at the same time as the other chillies.

WOW. I love this mole! Much better than the other recipes I've tried. If you double the recipe, the leftovers can be frozen and saved for an easy weeknight meal.

Fantastic mole! It was time consuming, but no more so than other mole recipes, which did not turn out as well. I used cinnamon and dark chocolate instead of mexican, as well as 4 oz of dried ancho chiles.

If you're looking for a good Mexican chocolate, I highly recommend Taza Chocolate -- a small, socially and environmentally responsible business located in Somerville, MA. They make organic, minimally processed (stone ground) chocolate using traditional Oaxacan methodologies, and it is delicious! Here's their website: http://www.tazachocolate.com/

Amazing! I love the complexity of mole! I used 4 1/3 cups broth to 2/3 cup orange juice, and half the amount of orange peel, which made the flavour less bitter and helped the other flavours shine through. I made a second time with vegetable broth for a vegetarian friend and it was just as good! served over rice and grilled veggies.

I really enjoyed this and it turned out great. It was a bit of work but I knew that going into it. I cut down on the citrus slightly and, while yes it was a little sweet, actually was quite delicious. It may have been better with cinnamon and dark chocolate instead of the mexican chocolate to cut out a little of the sugar but the sweetness was not overpowering. I will make it again someday!

I found this mole to be a bit too much on the sweet side, I think I'll try it with less orange juice next time (I couldn't get a fresh orange- go figure -for the rind). I can't get Mexican dried chilis here in Africa, so I used a few different fresh ones I could find in a market, roasted in a cast-iron pan prior to adding to the mix. I made a big pot of chicken stock this afternoon, and so used the shredded chicken from that rather than cooking more chicken, which worked really nicely.

My first mole! I've eaten many a mole, but have always been intimidated by the labor intensive preparation. Had some friends over to help me (I put them on chile duty) with plenty of margaritas to go round. It was fantastic! I made it with chicken breasts which got a little dry but the sauce was excellent and even better the next day. It had more of a citrus taste than I had expected but it worked. I used more OJ and less peel. I will definitely make this again and I no longer feel intimidated!

This is an easy recipe to screw up. Several of these ingredients are going to do what they can to sneak through and knock out the others. The other reviews have talked about the peppers and the chocolate both shoving everything else out of the way. I managed to keep that under control but must've been dealing with a particularly bitter orange peel. I followed the instructions as to quantity and found the result good but having a distinct and unpleasant orange peel aftertaste. The bitterness doesn't play nice with the other flavors. Next time - more OJ, less peel.

Love this recipe! Made it for a party and though it is a little time consuming to make, I made it the day before the party and simply reheated prior to serving. I did not shred the chicken and just cut it into serving sized pieces instead and poured the mole sauce over. There was plenty of sauce left over and it was even better today! I served it with Mexican rice and a jicama slaw with a spicy orange dressing that went beautifully with the richness of the mole. A real crowd pleaser. By the way, pasilla chiles and chiles negros are not the same thing, as a previous poster stated. I found both types at Mexican market near my home and they look totally different (the chiles negros are black and the pasillas are more of a brick red).

This is certainly good but it is a fair amount of work. This makes a lot of leftovers and it reheats great.

Haven't tried this yet, but planning on it. Several of you have asked what to serve with this besides tortillas. My husband suggested Fideo. A pasta style dish. I think am going to try that. My grandmother used to serve her mole with Fideo.

Wonderful recipe, easy and full of flavor. Be careful with the orange peel as too much will overwhelm the other flavors. I added sesame seeds, but otherwise followed the recipe as written.

This has a lot of depth in flavor. I couldn't find any mexican chocolate, so I used some 70% dark chocolate with a bit of cayenne and cinnamon. It would be nice to get some ideas about what to serve alongside the dish though. The mole with tortillas isn't quite a well rounded meal... I had a salad as well, but it wasn't particularly mexican-inspired.

I thought this was sensational. Mole is one of my favorite Mexican dishes. I've made other recipes but this one was so easy by comparison, with no loss of quality. I followed the recipe to the letter except I didn't have Mexican chocolate so used half unsweetened and half bittersweet, plus a couple teaspoons of ground cinnamon. I also didn't bother shredding the chicken, just left the thighs whole. Agree with the first reviewer, using an immersion blender made it simple. I served this to a dinner party for several friends and everyone raved.

Great recipe. Thinned with extra chicken broth; cut 1/4 of the chocolate and could have cut it even more; and had perhaps too much heat; but will definitely make this again.

I made this for Cinco de Mayo at work and received a lot of compliments. I didn't have the Mexican chocolate, so I used a semi-sweet variety and put some stick cinnamon in the broth with the chicken. I thought the sauce was a little heavy on chocolate. The recipe also made about 3 times what I needed to coat the chicken. Hooray for extra sauce!--I'll freeze it use it with leftover chicken.

We tried this out on a couple of friends and it turned out well. We made a half recipe and basically followed the ingredient list down the line. It's a short-cut to a very decent mole and we'll definitely be making it again.

Relatively simple and delicious. Made considerably easier with an immersion blender. Pasilla chiles and chile negro are the same thing. 4 oz of Pasilla is plenty. They are not hot, but give a nice heady boldness to the flavor. I used 64% Valrhona chocolate which was sweet enough, not bitter at all. I also added a couple of teaspoons of sesame seeds with the other seeds and almonds. A keeper.
