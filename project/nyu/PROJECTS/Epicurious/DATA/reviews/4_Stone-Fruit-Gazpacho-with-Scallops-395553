I wanted to add to my recent review that I did not need as much olive oil as called for--3/4 C worked fine. And I needed to correct that my fruit was not in the fridge, just my watermelon.

Such a great moment, when we ate this amazing gazpacho last Wednesday here in Southern France, where peaches and plums are doing their best to please us (it's Summer!) and thyme grows as free as the Mistral wind (it's la garrigue!)!

Absolutely loved the combination of flavors in this recipe! We had extra gazpacho left over after we had devoured the scrumptious seared scallops, so I added a dollop of no fat Greek yogurt on top of the fruit gazpacho, and that was also delicious with some chopped almonds sprinkled over it. I just happened to have all the fruits in my fridge so had to make this summer gazpacho, and I will look forward to making it again next summer after local plums are in season along with the local peaches and watermelon. (I used yellow peaches and red watermelon, so the color was darker, but the taste was full of flavor--also added some peach balsamic vinegar in addition to the other ingredients.)
