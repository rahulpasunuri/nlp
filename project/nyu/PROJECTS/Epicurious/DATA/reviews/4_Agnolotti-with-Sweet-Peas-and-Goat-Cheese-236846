Just one important correction to this recipe: Once rolled out, the fresh pasta strips should NOT be left uncovered for 10 min to dry out slightly (as the recipe wrongly suggests). This is fine for unfilled pastas, like tagliatelli, but is incorrect for filled pastas, like ravioli or agnolotti where dough strips should be moist and slightly sticky. The drying out of pasta sheets would reduce stickiness significantly and would therefore make it almost impossible for dough edges to stick together when pinched to create triangles/squares. Thus, after rolling out, the pasta sheets should be COVERED (with plastic foil or wax paper/parchment) until shaping.

This was a great recipe. I too used the Wonton wrappers. You really have to press down hard to make sure that the green pea and cheese mixture does not come out of the wonton wrappers while boiling. Another problem was it was WAY too sweet. I kind of felt like I was eating dessert. No matter how sweet it was, it had a lot of great flavors. I highly recommend this recipe. Note: you have to make sure the cheese you use is vegetarian (no animal rennet) to make this dish vegetarian.

Loved this. I also cheated and used wonton wrappers. This creates a very soft pasta though. I loved the creamy/sweet mix of cheese and peas. Great summer dish.

Yummy yummy! The taste of the peas was so refreshing - quite a difference from your typical ravioli. I made the filling then used wonton wrappers, and added a little proscuitto strip in each bundle as one reviewer suggested. It's time-consuming to make the raviolis, but they could be made ahead and cooked when needed. We ended up kinda frying the ravioli when we put them into the brown butter sauce in the frying pan, and that extra crispiness was a nice touch.

This was wonderful! I was looking for ways to enjoy the fresh peas at my farm stand. Cheated and used won ton wrappers and made ravioli. Also used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of the cream...... served with a fresh pea sauce I made by sauteeing peas, shallot, garlic and chicken broth....then purreed...delish.

I struggled with making the pasta dough. It seemed too dry and would'nt roll out easily but I decided to use it anyway and it came out fantastic! I used frozen peas and did'nt have cream so used milk. I also added a small piece of Proscuitto under each dollop of filling which really added to the dish. I did not top with any more thyme as I felt there was enough already. I simply browned my butter and tossed it with large ribbons of fresh parmesan. Yum!! I want to give it another go and get the pasta more tender this time.
