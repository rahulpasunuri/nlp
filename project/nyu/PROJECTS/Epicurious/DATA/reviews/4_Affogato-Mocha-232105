Quite good for a recipe that takes at most 5 minutes to put together, but it tastes like what it is (basically: ice cream in a bowl) and that isn't anything spectacular. I'll only make it again if I have an emergency situation that doesn't allow more time or effort for a better dish.

I'm a sort of addicted to Affogato Mocha :-) hadn't given it a try until I met my dream man. He is an excellent Coffee Brewer. One of the reasons could be that he knows to craft it well :-)

It doesn't get much better than this! Easy,fast,do-ahead and chocolate!! Didn't have rum so used Kahlua instead ..delicious..I had to prepare seconds for 2 of the men ! I put the ice cream into coffee cups and stuck them back in the freezer until serving time then added the toppings .

Really good. I made it for my parents - big chocolate fans. They loved it. And in a pinch, it's still good without the rum.

A simple recipe that got nothing but raves at our BBQ. I think a dollop of whip cream would really finish it off. By the way we don't have an espresso machine but strong coffee woked very well. This is a keeper.

If you love Chocolate Mocha flavors this is an excellent dessert. It's like creamy chocolate cappuccino!! I topped it with ready whip and toasted almond slivers !! So easy to make and it's great for after dinner with company or just as a special treat!
