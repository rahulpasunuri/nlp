Really delicious. Made a few mods, including using veggie stock in place of chicken stock, omitting the raisins, using two zucchini instead of one zucchini and one crookneck squash, and using chickpeas instead of lima beans. I cut the oil content in the harissa down to about 1/3 cup as it seemed like a whole cup of oil was excessive. Limiting the liquid content in the harissa in this way caused the harissa to be very thick and chunky; to get around this, I pureed it to get a more sauce-like consistency. The only thing I would do differently next time would be to cut down on the amount of raw garlic in the harissa - as a rule, I love garlic; however, in this instance, I felt like it overwhelmed the other flavours in the sauce.

I have been making this recipe for the past three Passovers using Quinoa instead of Couscous. I really love the Harissa - it is sweet and spicy and I put it on everything, especially leftovers. This year I roasted all the veggies - you can really use whatever you like - and I thought it added something different that I liked. One thing, because quinoa cooks longer than couscous I recommend not adding the vegetables until it is cooked or almost cooked or the vegetables will get mushy. This year I used eggplant, butternut squash, zucchini, peas and chickpeas and cauliflower florets all roasted in the oven at 400 for 1/2 hour first.

This is one of my favorite recipes on epicurious. Love it! The only thing I'd advise is to decrease the olive oil in the harissa. You can play around with the vegetables as well. Absolutely delicious!!!

This recipe is fantastic as written, especially the harissa, but, as other reviewers have mentioned, it is very adaptable. (I've made it with brown rice to accommodate a gluten-free guest- still amazing). Love it as a side-dish, but definitely hearty enough to be a meatless main dish. We make it often on our Meatless Mondays. The kids devour it. Everyone always asks for the recipe.

excellent. very adaptable. As others suggested, I cut the amount of olive oil in the harissa and some of the cayenne and crushed red pepper. Also did not have green onions so I did include red onion. The couscous could use more diced tomatoes. Added chickpeas and more squash. Omitted raisins and ginger since my husband does not like to combine sweet and savory. I would definitely make it again and agree that the harissa makes it special.

Made this for a graduation party for 60 people. Multiplied the recipe by 4 and it was plenty. Everyone loved it - especially with the harrissa.

We made this tonight and really enjoyed it. We had a large butternut squash so ended up with a lot more squash than it called for - it was great! We thought that the harissa was a little overpowering. I would only make about half of it next time.

I'm always looking for healthy recipes that will be hearty and give me leftovers for lunches, and this is a great addition to the recipe box! I used 2 zucchini because the yellow squash looked pretty marginal, otherwise followed the recipe more or less as written (used fresh ginger, more garlic than called for, a few less raisins and chick peas instead of the peas/beans). I wasn't sure as I was cooking that there would be enough liquid for the couscous, but it turned out great.

I'm only reviewing the harissa because I made my own couscous and roasted some vegetables. It was delicious!! I added way way more spicy than it called for, but I'm also slightly insane with the heat, so that's understandable. Though I wouldn't call the original state hot in any sense of the word. Maybe my cayenne is broken. Anyway, delicious. Made heaps. Enough for lots of leftovers for my big hairy male, who also liked it. Without meat. :D Yaaaay.

So great. I made lots of substitutions that resulted in a really quick week night dinner...pre-cut butternut squash, canned garbanzo's subbed for lima beans, skipped the crookneck squash, used canned tomatoes, AND store-bought harissa. It was really fantastic. Would be beautiful and filling for vegetarian dinner guests.

I have made this recipe repeatedly, and now my kids make it at their own homes. For vegetarians you can easily substitute a vegetable stock for the chicken stock with no loss of flavor. (I am not a vegetarian, so I say this with confidence). The harissa is beyond delicious.

This was excellent, but DEFINITELY serve the couscous with harissa; if you don't plan to, add some chilis or other spice to the couscous itself, because it's a little too sweet and mild without any pungent accompaniment. I used a good jarred harissa I had in the fridge (the forte kind of A Riche A's kosher stuff from France), and it was fine; in fact, I don't think I'd've liked the recipe's chunkier, onionier one. Also, I advise a few minor changes to the recipe: Use less oil (only as much as needed to slick the bottom of the pot) and add the butternut squash when you add the leeks (since butternut takes longer to cook than does zucchini). The recipe lends itself to further tweaking, too, as per the contents of your fridge: I omitted the yellow squash, used homemade veggie stock instead of chicken, added cooked chickpeas instead of lima beans, and substituted chopped dried apricots for raisins. I served the finished dish alongside a tagine-style dish of chicken cooked with lemon and olives (which recipe I found on SimplyRecipes and highly recommend), although the couscous is certainly hearty enough on its own, too. I'll definitely make this again.

I made this last night for a family gathering Erev Rosh Hashanah and it was wonderful. I cut down on the oil for the Harissa and, since my daughter doesn't like zucchini, used more butternut squash. I also added chick peas (good idea). Everyone loved it and wants the recipe.

Rating: 4
I tested this last night (as a possible dinner-for-30 recipe next month). It was amazing, a "party in my mouth." I cut back on the olive oil in the harissa as others suggested. The harissa completed the couscous, which was nevertheless delicious on its own. The recipe makes a LOT. I halved it, and it could easily serve 8.

This was a phenomenal side dish to the Cumin Spiced Beef Kebabs in the August 2009 issue of Gourmet. I didn't have all of the veggies so I only used 1/4 cup onions, 1/2 cup garbanzo beans, 1/2 cup tomatoes and 1/2 cup green beans. I also subbed currants for the raisins and we sprinkled feta cheese on top. SOOOOO GOOOOOOD!!! I would not skip the Harissa, it was really tasty and added a nice extra layer of flavor to the already flavorful couscous. Plus it was a cinch to make, so why skip it? I did cut the amount in half though, and that was still plenty. I also skipped the cayenne and only added 2 tsp of the crushed red pepper and it had a nice kick but was still mild enough for the kids to eat.

Yuuummmy couscous, with tons of veggies. Just use vegetarian broth to make a perfect vegetarian meal. Good to follow the recipe, too many veggies and not all the couscous will be in broth when it cooks. The harissa adds a really nice touch, even for someone who doesn't like cayenne or vinegar. The red onions I would put in only if you like to eat raw onions.

Rating: 4
The harissa is fantastic and makes the dish. The recipe is surprisingly easy for the amount of flavor it packs. You can reduce the amount of olive oil in the harissa by about half. I substituted chickpeas for the peas and lima beans. This recipe would work with a variety of vegetables; no need to stick to the list provided. You do not need to cook the couscous in advance. It cooks in the pot with the vegetables.

I plan to make this tonight, but can someone tell me if I am supposed to cook the couscous before starting this recipe, or do I add the 1 1/2 cups of dried plain couscous to the mix and it will cook within the broth? Thank you!

very nice for the times you want something lighter than meat and full of veggies. i agree about cutting the oil in both the couscous and the harissa in half - i omitted the crookneck, used drained canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh, and subbed chickpeas for the limas, though only because i couldn't find baby ones - next time i would add both. yum - a good recipe to personalize!

Amazing. I would give this 5 forks if I had the option. So many flavors in one dish... this is perfect for a chilly fall evening.

I used onion instead of leeks, skipped the butternut squash, lima beans and the whole harissa. I added some frozen corn and we didn't have any plain peas, but mixed frozen peas and carrots worked instead. I forgot to add the rasins while it was cooking, so threw them in when it came off of the heat, which I think I liked better because I really don't like the look of big bloated rasins, or the texture either. I also added some leftover cook chicken for some added protien. This was great how I prepared it, but I would like to try it how the recipe was wrote, but probably woudn't make the harissa, just becasue it is so flavorful by it self.

Rating: 0
Wow! This dish far exceeded my expectations. Like the other reviewers, I credit the harissa. Out of this world. My adjustments: I left the red onion out of the harissa, subbed chickpeas and corn for limas and peas, and left out the butternut. I also cut the olive oil and vinegar drastically to save on calorie and fat content. This is certainly a versatile recipe and I look forward to trying different combinations of veggies.

Rating: 4
Truly delicious with fantastic earthy flavors. The harissa turns a good but forgettable dish into something special. I skipped the red onion in the harissa and it was still v. spicy. I agree that the harissa recipe can be halved. I had harissa leftovers for weeks (which was not entirely a bad thing.)

Rating: 3
The couscous was quite good, but as others have commented extensively on that, I won't add much. My one comment is that the recipe makes a TON of the harissa. Much, much more than I needed for all the servings of couscous. I would suggest cutting it in half. I used the rest in a recipe for Merguez lamb patties, also on this site. Enjoy!

Rating: 4
I'm only rating the harissa. Excellent with changes (I've made several times). I only use 1/4 cup oil, put the crushed red pepper through a spice grinder, so use cayenne to taste (usually 1/4 tsp). Don't bother with red onion. I make the harissa a couple of days ahead, but just add green onion an hour before serving. Great with any Moroccan food. Nice to add a few tbp. to creme fraiche for those that don't like it so hot.

Rating: 4
One of the best recipes I have ever made! And it is so healthy with all natural ingredients. I substitute chickpeas for the limas, and add corn to it also. I definately recommend using 1/2 the oil in the Harissa sause. You can go a little lighter on the red pepper flakes as it can get pretty spicey. I also think that the sauce should be made in the morning or the day before to let the onions mellow.

I've got to say, every time I make this, people ask me for the recipe. It's great for a big dinner party, and easy since it's a one-dish meal. Chopping can all be done in advance. The harissa is yummy! Sometimes I substitute chickpeas for limas, or currants/cherries for raisins, etc. Add oil slowly in the sauce, it can be too much...

absolutely delicious & visually beautiful. wonderful variety of colors & flavors. used cranberries i/o raisins. some prior reviewers said the couscous was too bland by itself. i disagree! my harissa was way too hot & spicy [maybe i added too much cayenne] so i added honey, sugar & some balsamic vinegar & used half the oil as suggested. brought it to a dinner party. everyone raved about it!

After much deliberation, I used all the oil for the Harissa. I figured that the proportion is what made the flavor. Once I added the vinegar, it emulsified nicely. I cut the red pepper in half, as I can't handle hot like I used to, and the result was a perfect heat, just spicy enough, but it didn't overwhelm the flavors. I also used homemade veggie stock - for my veggie daughter - that I added about a half a cube of mushroom boullion. Couldn't find any crooked neck squash, and didn't want to overwhelm it with butternut, so I coarsly chopped mushrooms and added. I also used 3 tsp. of fresh ginger, minced. I hate lima beans, so I used chick peas. I'll make it again, but will have all ingredients chopped first. The veggies got a little too soft while I cleaned and chopped the cilantro. All in all, I think this one is definately a keeper!

Excellent! I had my doubts about the harissa (tomato paste?!?), but it was absolutely delicious. The couscous keeps well in the fridge and is even better the next day -- hot or cold. I served leftovers to some friends for an improptu dinner party, and they couldn't stop eating it.

Delicious! The harissa is what really made it. Use dry couscous, not cooked couscous. I wasn't sure and cooked my couscous before (it will cook in the pot with the stock) and there was a bit too much liquid and it was a little sticky. Still tasted great, but I would definitely not cook the couscous next time.

Wow, this is fantastic. Chock-full of tasty veggies, and the harissa is delicious. This recipe makes a LOT, but fortunately cold leftovers keep well and taste just as good. I normally am not the biggest couscous fan, but this had so many tasty veggies that my friends and I gobbled it up.

Don't skip the harissa sauce - it makes this dish. The first time I made this, I was out of tomato paste but had plenty of fresh tomatoes on hand. I pureed some tomatoes and simmerred them until thick. I preferred the fresh taste of the tomatoes to the paste version I made the next time. Take the suggestion to reduce the oil by half. I served it with chicken baked with lemon and greek olives. It is great leftover.

Great recipe. I did nto follow it exactly however, but would make it again indeed. I only added in carrots for the vegetables since I was making lamb and it was my side dish. The harissa was great chunky and I took the recommendations and used 1/2 cup of olive oil and agree more than that would have been too much. I also did not use as much oil for the couscous - probably a few tablespoons.

Made without the Harrisa and it was GREAT. Might try the Harrisa next time. The dish itself is not bland (simply add more spices to kick it up if it's not spicy enough) and is very colorful to the palate and the eye. Very easy and quite quick. Superb vegetarian recipe.

Rating: 3
Very tasty. Reiterate suggestions to use WAY less oil. I used 1/2c for harissa and would use even less next time. Keeping it raw is pretty important though. Next time I might try pureeing it so it's more like the hot sauces I have at the local Middle Eastern restaurant. I added tofu to the couscous for a vegan protein boost, too -- chickpeas would be a more authentic addition.

To be honest, this recipe didn't sound that exciting, but the reviews were so good I decided to try it and was pleasantly surprised. Although the couscous and veggies are good, it's definitely the harissa that makes the dish special--it's very pungent and is a nice contrast with the milder flavors of the couscous. I agree that 1/2 cup of oil is plenty for the harissa, and a can of diced tomatoes are fine for the couscous. I made it with vegetable stock and it was a great vegetarian dish.

This was a huge hit with everyone who tried it. I cut the oil in half for the harissa and didn't add any red onion since I didn't have any. The next time I make it, I will also cut the oil in the couscous in half.

Very good. Make sure you follow the directions about cooking time. The texture and color of the dish will be at its apex if you do. I used 1/3 of the recommended olive oil for the Harissa and it was lite and flavorful...an excellent counterbalance to the sweetness of the couscous.

Very good, a keeper. For the couscous, currants were great in place of raisins. I added a little veg. broth powder to amplify the chicken broth; next time I'd also bump up the tumeric, ginger & cayenne. The harissa was WAY too oily; I'd cut olive oil in half next time. I also decreased the vinegar, increased the tomato paste and cooked the red onions & garlic as suggested by another cook. Overall, a delicious dish.

Complex, interesting flavor. I am not a fan of mouth-searingly hot foods, so it was with caution that I tried the harissa...although the couscous is very good plain, the harissa very nicely counterbalances all the sweetness of the squashes and fruit. (I used dried cranberries in place of raisins, and added a chopped bell pepper.)

This has become a staple recipe in our house--it is fantastic. My family is from North Africa and we make Harissa slightly differently: to blend the flavors more, we saute the onion and garlic in a little of the olive oil first, then cool it and then mix it in with the rest of the Harissa ingredients. I don't like vinegar in Harissa sauce so I omitted it and it was great without out it.

Honey, I thought I died and went heaven! This dish was sweet and spicy, light and hearty. I cut down the oil a bit--it didn't hurt the flavor. I tripled the lima beans and doubled the tomatoes (which were canned due to unavailability of ripe tomatoes) and still came out with a Weight Watcher special. This is one you want to share with others. EXCELLENT!
