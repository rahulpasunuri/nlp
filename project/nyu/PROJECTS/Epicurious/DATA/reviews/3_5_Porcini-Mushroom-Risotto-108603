This is wonderful. I also made it traditionally by stiriring in the liquid bit by bit instead of using a pressure cooker. Delicious! A keeper...

Great recipe! I made it the traditional way though - adding liquids gradually and stirring all the time - because I don't have a pressure cooker

The only change I made to the recipe was omitting the fennel seeds. This was so delicious that I can't wait to make it again!! YUMMMM And so easy!!

Wow!!! what a gerat way to use the pressure cooker I have never used but got as a weeding gift 6 years ago. First time out of the box and never going back. I love this recipe, quick, easy and very flavorful. My husband is italian and he could not tell the difference from the traditional method. I LOVE IT!!!

What an amazing dish, and it couldn't be easier. I just got a new pressure cooker at a garage sale and this is by far the best use of it so far. The flavor and consistancy of this risotto could not be distinguished from the normal slow cooked recipe. The fennel was a bit overpowering, but all in all, it was fantastic- and took only 20-25 minutes to get to the table. Rave reviews from my Italian husband!

to the cook from Scotland - please don't rate recipes unless you've actually made them. You can comment without rating-

I left out the mushrooms to make the dish lighter. I don't think you can distinguish this from slowly cooked stirred rissoto.

this is not a genuine risotto recipe. a real recipe calls for adding fluids gradually and continual stirring.

I made this dish for a dinner party and got rave reviews. Perfect for a side dish too. My husband loved it.

This dish is great. Risotto is rich and creamy, a perfect winter meal.

Delicious. The porcini mushrooms add a certain earthiness to the dish. A good dish for weekend guests -- they can help stir!
