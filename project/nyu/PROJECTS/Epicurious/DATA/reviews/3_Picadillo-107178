Too much water, not enough cumin or garlic. Leaves out some of the things we see in picadillo like carrots, potatoes, and sometimes even peas. Found some better recipes for it on other sites.

Will try with some carrots and potatoes, finely diced, as that is the way it is traditionally served around here in Central Texas.

A very authentic picadillo like I grew up on in South Texas. I spiced mine up a bit with some diced hot peppers.

Thanks for the only traditional picadillo recipe on the net. This is the good, old, basic traditional texmex standard. From here you can jazz it up all you want, if you want to.

This is not picadillo, just a very boring chili recipe.

This recipe was okay. It would probably be great in tacos or over rice, but alone it's not the best. I sprinkled cheddar cheese over it and even tried it a-top lettuce for a fiesta salad. I also had to add more spice. I found that cooking the beef for so long made it a little tough and chewy.

i've always loved picadillo, but with summer around the corner, i substituted ground turkey for the beef, and i also added chopped garlic, red peppers, red tomatoes, and some olives along with the raisins , yum, you can't even tell it's turkey. also very easy to make

I eat low-carb and this was perfect by itself for dinner. The cooking liquid really makes the dish. It has a savory beef flavor with the light tartness of the tomatoes. Delicious! I will definitely make this again.

This is a great easy recipe! It's versatile and quick, and mighty tasty. I added a little more spice, and fresh pressed garlic. I spooned it over corn chips added some shredded cheese and unfortunatly was missing sour cream. It didn't really need it but I love it as an accompniment with any mexican flavors.

Chalupas: These are made by pressing tortilla dough into an elongated shape with a ridge around the edge, resembling the chalupas or canoes from which they take their name. They are cooked on a comal, and sometimes fried as well, then topped with shredded meat, cheese and similar fillings.
