Easy to make for a weekday meal but nothing special.

I made this recipe as part of the week-long Use Large Amounts of Leftover Ham cooking series. It was hands-down the best. The tarragon cream sauce is straightforward and delicate, as tarragon sauces go, but it nicely complements the salty ham, and the sliced cucumbers and mushrooms add texture if not a great deal of taste. Slice the vegetables super thin: you want them fine and flexible so that the sauce clings to them like pasta. (And please don't bother peeling and seeding the cucumbers unless for some reason they're monstrously huge and tough.) We upped the sauce-to-ham ratio considerably -- in our opinion the recipe as written makes enough for about two standard slices of spiral-cut honey-baked ham. I have already made this recipe twice, and people still gift me with cucumbers and hints for more. Simple and successful.

MY fiance and and I thought this was yucky as well! very strange flavor and we should have just eaten the ham plain and untouched.

I made this because the prior reviewers loved it. ICK! This is one of the most terrible dishes I've ever made. My husband & I ended up throwing it out. Terrible flavor!
