Unfortunately for me, I could not for the life of me remember where I got the recipe from of the salmon burgers I usually make, and cuz in a hurry (and because i had all the ingredients), i settled for this one. I guess I have the dissenter view, but I thought this recipe was not even okay. Even though I upped the salmon in the salmon vs. filler ratio, I still thought that there was way too much filler and not enough fish. Upped the flavor ingredients as well, but still thought this was much too bland. Truly, I found the whole thing a waste of my salmon :(

We love salmon so I was anxious to try this recipe. The aroma of the salmon patties while they cooked was enticing however the final product was quite dry. If I were to make this recipe again, I wouldn't cook it for the full time specified in the recipe and would omit the bread.

This was delicious. We broiled the burgers for about 15 minutes (7-8 minutes on each side) instead of cooking them in the skillet--it worked out very nicely. I didn't make the pickled cucumber, but instead topped it with a ginger-horseradish mayonnaise.

Fairly easy to make, everyone really liked this meal. The combination of flavors was very good - I made this just as the recipe said.

I made the cucumber salad and mixed the fish the night before. Came out great, everyone loved it, I hope to make it again.

I have been making this recipe since I clipped it from the magazine! I sometimes add a little sesame oil, but it doesn't really need it. My husband and I are not big pumpernickel fans, so we use whole wheat pitas. Lovely recipe.

I made this for my dad- who loves salmon but was horrified when he saw me chopping it up. He claimed I was ruining the fish. At dinner, he not only ate the salmon but his words too. Wonderful dish.

really easy, and really delicious. Nothing spectacular, but good, fresh flavors. Will become a staple for how I fix salmon.

This is a keeper! What a great way to get in your salmon. I used fresh potato sesame buns and they were delicious! This will become a staple in our house.

Can't say enough about this recipe. It's easy, healthful and delicious. I served it on baby greens instead of pumpernickel. Next time, I'll probably make a light gingery vinaigrette for the salad.
