A little too doughy for me - I use 2 cups of Bisquick and a little water to make mixing easier.

I adjusted the recipe and they came out perfectly. I used 1 1/2 cups flour, 2 tsp. baking powder, 1/2 tsp baking soda, 1/2 tsp salt (omit if sausage is very salty), 8 oz. grated cheddar, 1 lb. raw chorizo or other sausage, 2 Tbsn shortening or lard, and 3/4 cups chopped green chiles. You can add garlic powder, chile powder, etc. to taste. Roll into 1" balls and either refrigerate or cook right away on foil sprayed with cooking spray on cookie sheet for 20 minutes at 375 degrees. This works great at 5,000 ft here in NM, but you mau need to increase baking powder and soda and reduce cooking time at sea level. These don't come out greasy at all. Easy to do ahead and bake at last minute.

I make these all the time and love them. I also add some hot chili flakes, sometimes thyme but you really need lots more sausage to balance off the bisquick.

Rating: 0
The ingredient proportions are completely off. My husband made them this way and they tasted more like SAWDUST balls than sausage balls. With that much bisquick, you need at least twice as much sausage and cheese. Ugh. Don't use this recipe unless you have a lot of beverages nearby to wash them down.

In my opinion these are seriously not up to Epi standards. This recipe should be found only on the Kraft site. I know, not everything has to be gourmet, but they were well below expectations. To salvage this recipe you would have to totally reconstruct the ingredient list. Not worth the time.

Rating: 1
Super easy but they tasted 'just O.K.' I read all the reviews and decided to try the recipe. I used the microwave technique to melt blue cheese and I added 1/2 cup milk for moisture as I had sauteed off the hot sausage. I also added rosemary, thyme and oregano for a more Italian twist. I served it with homemade tomato sauce for dipping. Probably won't make them again.

Superbowl Success!!! I've made these before, and they are always a hit. I am older now and trying to be slightly more health conscious so I used turkey sausage. I also added: 2 tablespoons garlic powder, 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper and extra sharp Tillamook cheese. (GO MOOKS!) My wife just loved them! Said they were not greasy at all using turkey sausage.

Do these really bring back the memories! I use less bisquik, semi-cook the bulk sausage, add milk, add granulated onion. The grandkids love them. Easy way to make the sticky gooey balls is to keep hands wet by dipping in water!

I have a question and didn't make these yet! I want to make these for Christmas and the instructions are not clear. What do I do with the sausage? Crumble it out of the casings first? Do I saute and get the fat out from it first and then mix with the flour and other ingredients? then I bake to cook the rest of the way? It doesn't say it in any of the instructions if I cut the sausage and cook first then mix with the flour and stuff. Thanks. my email is e_susan94@hotmail.com

I made two versions of this for a superbowl party: one exactly as printed and one for the vegetarians/dieters. The exact recipe here was decent but not fantastic - maybe 2.5 forks. It was so greasy and no one ate more than one because they were so heavy. In the second batch, I substituted Gimme Lean sausage (veggie) and lowfat cheese (the pre-shredded 2% Kraft stuff - I think it was a combo of Mexican and cheddar). I used the same quantities as the recipe listed, and also threw in some red pepper and a few shakes of cajun spice (to mimic the spicy sausage). These were a crowd pleaser! They were far less greasy than the full-fat version, and much lighter in your stomach. The texture was also bit fluffier. The platter was empty very quickly, so I'd give that version 4 forks.

Rating: 3
This recipe is a Southern staple and while you can add a gazillion other ingredients, I think it's best left in its original simple state. Use only high quality sausage (try Bass Farm and use 1/2 lb. hot and 1/2 lb. mild) and sharp or extra sharp cheddar cheese (grate it yourself). Use your kitchenaid and it's ok to add a bit of water or milk to ensure the bisquick gets mixed in - but other than that just enjoy the simplicity of a wonderful southern holiday staple.

Rating: 3
I used many suggestions from these reviews, and hit the jackpot. I used 1 lb. spicy sausage, 12 oz. grated cheddar/italian cheese mix, 2 cups of bisquick, 2 tsp. garlic powder, and 1 egg. Then I used my Kitchenaid mixer with the dough hook. Super easy and the kids loved them! Yes, they are extraordinarily fattening, but they're a great party staple, especially for kids who haven't developed a more refined palate just yet. (Okay, I admit, I ate several, too.) For Halloween, I poked 6 chow mein noodles into each ball to make spider legs -- cute!

Rating: 2
I made these for Superbowl and everyone agreed they were just OK. Based on all the other reviews, I brought the sausage and cheese to room temperature, used 2 cups of bisquick, and used my Kitchen Aid with the dough hook - they came together very easily. I guess I expected more of a biscuit than a meatball... So I added a little more bisquick to the next batch but it tasted doughy. They weren't a flop, they were still tasty but I wouldn't make them again. Everyone liked it dipped in ranch best (next favorite was BBQ sauce).

Rating: 3
I made the recipe with 2 cups Bisquick and added 1/3 cup of milk and a bit of garlic powder. I didn't think they were hard to mix at all. I'm not sure you really need to cut back on the amount of Bisquick. Very easy and tasty. A simple crowd-pleaser for guests who don't like "complicated" dishes.

Why not try adding an egg like you do when you make meetballs? It might make it moister. Just a suggestion.

YES, this recipe is WAY too dry. I would use perhaps 1 - 1.5 cups of baking mix to the same proportion of sausage and cheese. I added some chopped green chile, which made it moister. Served these at a party and they FLOPPED.

For the reviewers that said it was too dry, the trick (and the original recipe from Bisquick)is to add 1/2 cup of milk. It also calls for some rosemary, parsley and 1/2 cup of grated parm, but I just use the cheddar, and they come out wonderfully!

Rating: 4
I make these for my family all the time. However, I decrease the bisquick by half. That much bisquick makes them too dry.

Here's the trick to this recipe. You need to add some liquid. I added in about 1/2 cup of manwich and it makes these balls SUPERB! I took the Manwich-sausage-cheese balls to a New Year's party and they disappeared instantly. I made another batch where I used a cornbread mix instead of bisquick, spicy mexican sausage and also added enoug milk to make the mixture come together. These were also good and I did receive compliments. However, they were eaten up after the batch using the manwich as a liquid.

This is an all time favorite .MY family eats them up faster than I can make them. Perfect for small parties or Christmas Goodies.

This is a terrific make ahead nibble. Men especially like this which is great for an all appetizer party, as most men don't feel that appetizers are substantial enough to qualify as a meal. One suggestion is to increse the cheese to 16 oz, and decrease the bisquick to 2 cups. This might help the cook who said hers/his were dry.

I made these for an office Thanksgiving Potluck and they were a big hit. I used 1 lb. Jimmy Dean Sausage (spicy), 2 cups bisquick and 1 lb. cheddar cheese. I used parchment paper on the cookie sheet and they came out perfect on the bottom. Try them, you'll love them! (also a great make ahead)

This recipe totally did not work for me. I followed others' suggestions and used 2 1/2 cups of bisquick. I had NO grease in the pan, the bottoms burned and they grew so much that it all stuck together in one big heap ... it seemed to taste ok, but what a disaster.

I made these last night to test them for a holiday party we're having in a week. I added chopped onion and 1 tbsp garlic powder. I liked them very much. My husband liked them, but thought they were too Bisquick-y. He did enjoy dipping them in several different mustards and barbeque sauces I'd picked up, though. They definitely do taste more like a biscuit than a sausage ball. You could use 2 cups Bisquick rather than three if you wanted more of a meatball type of appetizer. I think for the party I will roll them out and cut them with cookie cutters into Christmas shapes rather than make them into balls. They would definitely be good for a brunch, made with breakfast sausage, as well.

Rating: 3
Much easier done in a food processor. I crumple a sheet of aluminum foil before laying it on the baking sheet, creating valleys to catch some of the grease. Spray with Pam, or they will stick. Delicious with honey mustard.

I've been making this recipe since I was a child - if you have kids I highly recommend you let them do the mixing. But I also recommend that you only make this recipe at holidays - it is extraordinarily fattening, and the kids will eat them up like candy.

Don't precook the sausage, and definitely use less Bisquick - about 2 or 2 1/2 cups should do it. The onion & garlic powder suggestions worked out really well for me, too. This was a hit last year for Christmas at my house, and I'm making them again this year. These are far from healthy, but for a once-a-year, "comfort food" treat, they're a tasty indulgence.

Rating: 4
Hilarious. This recipe is like making lil' smokies in bar-b-que sauce or fried baloney sandwiches on Wonder white bread. Nobody wants to admit they love that kinda food but who they kiddin'? Sausage balls are awesome but if your looking for a culinary masterpiece, f'gedaboudit. I was making this recipe when you still had to use a double boiler to melt the cheese! Now, just melt the cheese in a glass bowl in the microwave. Add onions and garlic powder for added flavor and if you like some crunch, celery. Use HOT sausage. DO NOT serve at a fancy dinner party! :-))

Rating: 4
Our family first found this recipe in the Louisiana Farm Bureau Women's cookbook in the early 1980's. We love it. I cook my sausage first, then mix so that the cheese melts. However, you will have to allow it to cool before you roll the balls. Also, these freeze very well. To freeze, stop the recipe after rolling the balls and before baking. To freeze, place unbaked balls on cookie sheet and put in freezer. When frozen, place in plastic bag, and bake as needed. Do not thaw before baking. (These are also great for a breakfast "biscuit".

Certainly easy to make, and being able to freeze them before or after cooking adds to the ease. I only used two cups of Bisquick and I cut it down some more. It's definitely a dish to experiment with and add your own touches.

I've made this recipe several times. Often, I add a teaspoon of water to make the mixing a little easier. I also add red pepper and a little garlic powder to spice it up a bit. It's always a hit at a party and I've never failed to have someone ask me for the recipe. Serve warm for best results.

my sister makes these. and we love them. i recently ran across a similar recipe in WS for sausage/cheese puffs. took lots of effort and time and while they were good, they were not as good as these. i have made and added olives (chopped and used either grated romano or parmesan and italian sausage i think it makes for a "fancier" appetizer.

Everyone loves these. I made them with maple breakfast sausage and they smelled wonderful baking. For me, the easiest way to make them is to put it all in a glass bowl, break it up and mix somewhat, then warm it a bit in the microwave, mix some more and warm it once more (probably one minute each time). It mixes more easily and molds better.

I have made this recipie twice now and both times it was a hit. Its an easy appetizer, and delicious. Everyone loves them - perfect for parties - like the superbowl.

I've added chopped onions, and chopped waterchestnuts for "crunch". Also, the balls can be frozen raw, or cooked.

I've made this several times since coming across the recipe - definitely go along with the suggestions of using slightly less Bisquick (I'd never used Bisquick before; who knew?!?)

I noticed that someone wrote that they had found this same recipe on Jimmy Dean Sausage. I remember it as having come from Bisquick back when quick mixes were a new concept.
