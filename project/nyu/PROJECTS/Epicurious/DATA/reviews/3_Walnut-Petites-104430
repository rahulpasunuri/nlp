These are perennial favorites in our Christmas cookie gift boxes. They are labor-intensive (I guess that's Christmas for you!) but they are like a delicious mini nut pie. I've found that baking them in silicon mini muffin liners lets you just pop them out without any casualties. I shape them in the liners in the tins, but bake them free-standing. I wonder if some reviewers found they had too many walnuts because they either didn't chop them finely enough, or didn't measure by weight. Just a thought. I've never had any trouble with these, and people love them.

I love this recipe and have made it twice. Admittedly, it's a bit labor intensive, but each piece is like a miniature pecan (or walnut) pie. Because they are so rich, the size is perfect. When you fill yours, make sure that there is both nuts and the syrupy stuff in each. Then hopefully, they won't turn out dry. Also, they're even better a day old.

The filling did seem dry to me so I added some corn syrup into the mix and they were great. Definitely watch the amount of filling.

I loved this fairly simple, not too sweet addition to my holiday cookie recipes. I did substitute pecans for the walnuts the second time I made them -- fantastic!

Found these dry and disappointing. Would not make again.

We didn't particularly care for this recipe. If I ever did make it again I would cut down on the walnuts. There were way too many. I agree with the last reviewer - the filling has to be kept small because it rises quite a bit. I think that the large proportion of walnuts in the filling is what made it seem so dry.

My husband and I really enjoyed these cookies. Just be sure you use only a teaspoon when filling them because the filling does rise quite a bit. I used too much filling the first batch and although they were still delicious they looked like mini muffins instead of cookies.

I love this type of cookie but thought these weren't that outstanding. My husband found them a little dry. Also, the filling mixture was way too much; I had a full cup left over whilst the dough amount was right on. They'll be fine for the holiday cookie exchange because they look sweet and I'm sure someone will love them!
