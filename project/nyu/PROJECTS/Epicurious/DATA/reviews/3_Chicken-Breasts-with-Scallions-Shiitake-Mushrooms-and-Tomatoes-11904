This worked great as a weeknight dinner for my teenage son and me. He hates mushrooms, so I left them out, but there was delicious flavor from the other ingredients. I used two diced heirloom tomatoes, and very fresh, plump scallions. I think this dish will rise and fall with the quality of the ingredients. At the end, I put the breasts back in the sauce to cook for a few minutes, as I thought they might not have stayed hot enough. This overcooked them slightly, and next time I would stick with the recipe in this regard and just pour the sauce over the breasts to serve. I would definitely make this again.

My family and I loved this recipe. I used flour instead of arrowroot. I also used Italian diced canned tomatoes in the recipe. I was delicious.

Everyone loved it...even without the shallots, garlic and scallions it came out great. Didn't use arrowroot and substituted cherry tomatoes. Asparagus salad with sweet balsamic vinegar and rizzoto rice (with the remaining mushrooms and tomatoes) completed the meal

I like this dish. I agree that adding a little salt and pepper is better. I do not use arrowroot and use cider vinegar as well. It is great and if you want a light meal it would be wonderful with rice. Definitley something I would make again. The sauce is good.

Too bland! If I were to make it again, I would sautee the shiitakes in butter then add to pan, then add wine. They lost all flavor being "boiled" in wine.

This recipe is a little bland and common. Though the flavor is not bad, there is nothing special especially considering the time put into making the dish. To spice it up try a Flavorful Rice Pilaf and a balsamic and blue cheese asparagus.

The recipe omits adding salt and pepper to the sauce, so this is the reason some of the other reviewers found the sauce bland. I used apple cider vinegar instead of white wine vinegar, and flour instead of arrowroot. I also used yellow and orange heirloom tomatoes. I thought the sauce was flavorful and had a nice body to it, yet it was still light. The sauce would also be delicious on a firm fleshed fish. It also looks beautiful on the plate.

A new family favourite!

We tried this after reading the reviews, and we left out the vinegar. We were very disappointed in the overall flavour, which was bland to say the least. We will not make this again without adding something to spice it up. But have lots of recipes to try yet.

This recipe was healthy ( I grilled the breasts ) , had nice presentation, but I thgought it was pretty bland. I added a litthe soy sauce to the sauce, which helped.

Taking the advice of the Las Vegas cook, I didn't even use the vinegar and the dish tasted quite good. I also took her advice about cooking the chicken breasts just a bit longer in the sauce. I served this dish over Kluski noodles and my partner raved about it. With a green salad and Italian bread, it was a great meal.

As the Mom of a great chef (soon at the Blue Marlin in Cary,NC - Open March 2000), I have learned to exchange ingredients to suit my tastes. I used oil packed sun-dried tomatoes in place of the plumb tomatoes. I added the sun-dried tomatoes with the mushrooms. Next time I would eliminate the vinegar - there is enough acid with the white wine. also, my chicken breasts were thick - I cooked them about 8 minutes longer and added them back into the sauce for 2-3 minutes before serving.

I specifically liked the ease of this dish. I prepared creamy grits to accompany the meal. It even made for good left overs.

Yummy and out of the ordinary taste. For people with big kitchens' it would be great. For our little new york appartment, it left a "lingering" smell in the air. But a good meal non-the-less
