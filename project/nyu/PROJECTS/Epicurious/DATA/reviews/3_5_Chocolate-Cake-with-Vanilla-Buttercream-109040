The cake recipe is excellent, I did NOT care for the buttercream at all. I really thought it tasted like slightly sweetened whipped butter.

I usually buy cakes from a local bakery, but this year I made this cake for my daughter's 3rd birthday. Everyone thought it was better than the bakery cakes! It was moist, very chocolatey, and I made it with all organic ingredients so we didn't get that sugar-rush shaking afterwards. My son has asked for it for his birthday so I'll be making it again tomorrow. The only change I made was as per another reviewer's suggestion of baking it at 325 for about 50 mins. Maybe that's why it was so moist and perfect. I'm drooling just thinking about tasting this again!

very good chocolate cake recipe, I habe tried several others and by far this one is the best. I only used 1 cup brown suger and added 1 cup Slpenda. I also used fat free milk instead of whole milk. I kept everything else the same and it was a big hit! I will make this cake again... for sure!

This is the best chocolate cake I've ever eaten. Ever. I usually don't eat a lot of chocolaty stuff, but this was moist and rich. The buttercream frosting, however was a disaster. Despite using the stand mixer, it never came together. Can't wait to make the cake again, but will do a different type of icing.

Rating: 4
The cake recipe is so simple, takes maybe ten minutes to pull together, and bakes to perfection - moist, just the right amount of chocolatey, and neither too dense nor too fluffy. (Use good quality cocoa and vanilla!) The buttercream? Be still my heart! This is truly the most incredible, buttery, not too sweet frosting I have ever made. Huge hit with the adults and kids at my son's second birthday party.

While I have not made this cake recipe, I have been making a very similar one for years. (White sugar instead of brown.) My recipe calls for baking the layers at 325 F for 45 to 50 minutes and it has always turned out well. Could this be the solution to "overbaked" and dry? This has been my usual recipe for years, and I have baked it successfully as layers, a 9x13 and also cupcakes. Usually serve it with ice cream or whipped cream and a berry sauce.

This was a hit. Gorgeous cake, perfect layers. I used Pernigotti Cocoa, delicious. The buttercream was also 4 star, however, if you chill the cake you want to bring it to room temp. Otherwise the buttercream tastes like...well, butter. 6 sticks is a lot of saturated fat. Once a year at most!

Excellent cake. I didn't use the buttercream recipe because reviews for that weren't as good, but the cake was wonderful. Very moist and chocolaty, but not too rich. Everyone loved it. I will make this my primary chocolate cake recipe from now on.

I first made this for my husband's birthday, and it is fabulous. I was wary of making a chocolate cake, but this one is moist, with a strong and rich chocolate flavor. I made a layer cake, and found the baking time to be at the longer end of the suggested time (it ended up being approximately 38 mins in my oven). High quality cocoa powder is a must for this recipe - I used Ghiradelli.

Just wanted to add my accolades. I made this cake for my husband for his birthday - it is FABULOUS. Deliciously decadent chocolate cake that maintained its shape/moisture/texture over several days in the fridge. I made the cake and buttercream icing exactly as specified in the recipe and could not be happier with the results - dark chocolate cake (I used valhrona cocoa powder) and fluffy buttercream with light vanilla flavor. Icing was easy to spread and held decorative piping nicely. The cake was definitely a labor of love, but well worth the time and effort. Highly recommended!

The cake was moist and delicious. Great chocolate flavor. The frosting took forever and was NOT a favorite. It sounds terrible, but I prefer vanilla buttercream that tastes more like the thick canned kind! This was one was dominated by the taste of butter and was too light for me.

One word....amazing. Not nearly as difficult as I thought it was going to be. Totally worth the time. Although I haven't figured out how to make it look the same as the photo, but am definitely going to give it another try.

I made the buttercream a few days ahead. After letting it sit out of the fridge the day of the party, I had a mino freak-out when I started beating it and it looked like was separating. I just kept whipping it up and it snapped back to it's lovely, spreadable self. I followed the cake recipe to a T and it was moist and fantastic. Everyone was crazy about it. I baked three layers in slightly smaller pans (8x1.5) and I filled the cake with raspberry preserves. SO GOOD!

This cake was DELICIOUS. I read all of the reviews and made this myself for my son's 5th birthday party. I followed the instructions and the cake came out with a rich,chocolate flavor - not dry as others had reported. The vanilla buttercream was not as WHITE as the photo. Perhaps I need to take some of the tips suggested in the comments, but it was still delicious. I only used 3 sticks of Clover organic unsalted butter (hence the yellow tinge?) and my vanilla was a brown color. Up until that point, the mixture was white white as it was nothing but egg whites and sugar. I highly encourage people to try this. It was a huge hit with everyone. You do not have to be a baker to rock this recipe. I did not make the vanilla mini cupcakes recipe - I use the Magnolia Bakery vanilla cupcake recipe for that. Good luck - give this a try today.

Is it fair to review and rate a recipe more than once?? This is my go-to chocolate cake. Makes exceptional cupcakes--just don't overbake. I use water in place of the coffee to bring out the chocolate flavor. I always wait until the chocolate-coffee-milk mixture is cool before adding it; I figure otherwise it melts the butter, then what was the point of creaming?? Probably not very scientific logic, but hey- This recipe is good stuff! P.S. I don't make the Buttercream, if I'm going to the trouble, I use MS's Italian Meringue Buttercream

I made this cake for the second time, and in both instances received rave reviews. I agree with others that timing is very important-- be sure to frequently check the cake fore doneness. Mine took longer than the 35 minutes, but came out fine. The buttercream is also a favorite. Friends who don't like sweets love the cake because of the buttercream. A few weeks ago I made the red velvet cupcakes from epicurious, and I used the buttercream from this recipe for them (again, rave reviews for the buttercream). I didn't use all of the buttercream from that batch, and froze it according to the instructions. Used it for the most recent cake, and it was just as good when first made.

I made this cake for my son's 1st birthday and it turned out perfectly. The look of it was a big hit with the kids and the mini cupcakes were a big hit with the parents (smaller portions for the little ones). The cake was moist and perfect. This is one of my favorite chocolate cake recipes I've ever made. And the buttercream turned out perfectly also, delicious and easy to work with.

I just made this cake and the Vanilla Butttercream for my son's 1st birthday. The cake recipe was easy and the cake was good enough, kind of average I would say. The frosting was just OK. I didn't really like the taste ~ overly buttery. I will stick to my Martha Stewart Swiss Buttercream recipe (to the reviewer who asked about Swiss Buttercream, it is made by whisking the egg whites and all of the sugar over a double-boiler to 160 degrees, then whipping it until cool, then adding the butter & vanilla). I love buttery frostings, but this just didn't work for me.

I would have given four forks, except I changed the recipe and used one cup of coffee instead of the water and buttermilk instead of whole milk. With those modifications, this is the best chocolate cake recipe to use for cup cakes.

Kind of a lot of work for a pretty good cake. The cake itself is not too chocolatey but rich and dense. I made a 3/4 recipe of the frosting as I wasn't making the cupcakes. Not owning a candy thermometer, I boiled the sugar syrup to the hard ball stage and might have overboiled it a little. Also, I only have a hand-power egg beater, and had a lot of difficulty beating in the butter. At the end, it still looked pretty curdled and my arm was about to fall off. What to do, what to do? I ended up whirling small batches in the blender, which whipped it up nicely. I baked the in two 8-in instead of 9-in pans. As a result, the cakes were much more mounded than expected and it took a lot of frosting to fill in the gaps. I hardly had enough left for more than a crumb coat. I ended up mixing together a bit of the old-fashioned butter /powdered sugar/milk frosting and dyed it blue for the decorations. It came out tall, lovely, and delicious, but perhaps not worth all that effort. The frosting is VERY buttery, and if I were to make it again, I'd probably use about 2/3 the butter called for. I'd also slice off the tops of the cakes. A note on the coloring--the frosting did turn out a creamy yellow-white, but so much of the flavor is from the butter--don't replace it with anything else, or you'll end up with sugary car wax.

I made this cake for a work birthday, and got raves. Someone actually asked if I made cakes to sell! The icing is a little odd on it's on, and I did cut it to 3 sticks of butter, but on the rich and sweet chocolate cake it works. It's not too sweet, so the compliment is perfect. I mixed half unsweet cocoa and half special dark (b/c I was out of regular cocoa) and the chocolate flavor was great. I think the users who complained about dryness are definitely overbaking. I already have plans to make this for my dad's birthday.

PASS ON THIS RECIPE. Cake tasted good, but was too moist. I made the cake the night before & wrapped in plastic to keep. Outside of cake was almost wet when I peeled off the plastic to begin frosting it. Crumb coat did no good, as it was ALL CRUMBS. Frosting was time consuming to make, but looked OK. Tasted like sticks of pure butter despite doubling the vanilla (I don't mean that in a good way). An almost complete disappointment. Might be salvaged if this was made into cupcakes instead of a layer cake.

I haven't made a "from scratch" cake in quite a while, and this cake/ frosting combo was quite a bit of work. I found the final product rewarding and very tasty. However, I think next time I'd try something different, it took a bit too much time. I might save some effort by using a box cake and only making the frosting.

I made this cake for a friend's birthday. It was a great success! however, i made the chocolate cake using the double chocolate layer cake recipe from this site, which i have made before with great success. i used the butter cream and decoration ideas from this cake. first tip: DO NOT make the buttercream a day or so in advance like it says you can. i let it come to room temperature out of the fridge for 2 hours until it was soft, but when i tried to whip it up again as directed, it seperated and i had to make it again in a hurry. on the plus side, i made it with A LOT less sugar and vanilla the second time around, so it tasted less like it was from betty crocker. i used only a tsp of sugar in the egg whites, and 1 cup of sugar for the syrup. i also only used 1 tsp of vanilla, which was really enough! i also suggest not cutting the cake in half and filling it with buttercream in the middle, i didn't simply because i didn't have two pans and decided to just take a bigger pan so that it could hold all the batter, and the cake would have just been too heavy with a filling. but, all in all (with the reduced buttercream) it was a fantastic cake!! i will deffinetely make it again!

I baked this cake as cupcakes for my husband's birthday. Couldn't decide between this and the Double Chocolate Cake on this website, but this cake was exceptional. It was light and moist with a great chocolate flavor. I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of making it as cupcakes (which I baked for a little under 20 min.) I made it with a white chocolate frosting (white chocolate, cream cheese, butter) and I'd say it was fantastic. I'm not even sure I want to try the Double Chocolate Cake now. . .=-)

my 8 yr old daughter and 4 year old son helped me make this cake for her Dad's birthday - they said it was delicious.

The cake was better the next day.

Wonderful, moist, delicious chocolate cake. I've made it twice now and will definately make it again and again. Perfect for birthdays. The buttercream frosting is delicious and totally worth the time, and is not too difficult once you get the hang of it. I typically put my kitchen aid bowl in a bowl of ice water briefly after adding the hot sugar syrup to help bring the temp down. Also the butter seems to whip in best if it is softened, but not too soft and warm.

Buttercream is not really my thing, but after reading the reviews I thought that I should give it a try. The texture of both cake and frosting were just fine. The taste, however, was absolutely nothing to write home about. I agree with the reviewers who commented that the frosting tastes like butter. I should have followed my instinct and stopped at the point where I had made the marshmallow frosting by adding the syrup to the egg whites. At that point the frosting was absolutely yummy. After adding the butter, it was downhill in taste from that point on. As for the cake, it was moist, but not exceptional. This cake is wonderful for dieters, not from the calorie stand point, but on the want-more scale. I , for one, wont have another slice.

Superb, ultra-rich, almost fudgy cake. Great chocolate flavor and moist crumb, though overbaking can dry it out a bit so pay close attention. Frosting is buttery to a fault--my guests were overwhelmed and some said it was "too much" but yet still ate every morsel. This is a gala cake, one to be eaten slowly and savored, a real special-occasion treat, not for folks watching their cholesterol. Would be equally fine with a lighter frosting.

Excellent chocolate cake. Very flavorful, moist and nice crumb texture. Make sure to overbake as I am sure this will dry it out and lead to complaints as we have all read. Great for cupcakes too. I baked mine around 18 min on convect and they turned out just right.

Delicious and moist--not at all dry. Stop overbaking your cakes! Seriously, the texture was moist & chocolately--the superb butter chocolate cake. Unlike the double chocolate cake on this site that everyone seems to love which is an oil based cake and therefore moist in a spongy way, this recipe is a butter based cake which means the chocolate flavor can really shine through and the texture is meltingly soft and moist.

This cake was fabulous. If you can remember what birthday cakes are traditionally like you will enjoy this recipe. I would not describe this cake as dry as some others have, they might just not be familiar with this cake style. Trust me, once you try it you will know what I am talking about. This cake has a nice chocolate flavor, perfect airy layers and the frosting is excellent! The recipe for the frosting is the best buttercream frosting I have tried. All this cake needs is a bit of vanilla or cookies and cream ice cream.

This cake was delicious and gone in an hour. I believe achieving the moistness is in the mixing technique. I made it twice, both cakes were perfect. Frosting was pure white in spite of one pound of butter. For the second cake, I added melted bittersweet chocolate to the buttercream. I have a very happy family this week.

Unlike some of the other reviewers, I thought the cake was very good and very moist. In fact I have repeated the recipe for cupcakes which turned out great. Be careful not to overbake. Because I am not a fan of sugary icings and love butter (who doesn't) the concept of this icing seemed to appeal to me. However, I really did not like the icing. It added no positive flavour to the cake. I would not make the icing again. The presentation of the cake was outstanding...just like in the picture.

I've never made a cake from scratch before and this chocolate cake was really good considering. I had no problem with it being dry or anything like that and I didn't even have all the right ingredients. In fact, I used light brown sugar instead of dark and skim milk instead of whole. Now I've never had buttercream before and I was not a big fan of it. It was just too.....buttery. I would definitely make this cake again but with a different type of frosting. Even so it was the perfect birthday cake for my boyfriend and he loved it (I made a good impression-he thinks I can bake now). Looked just like the picture.

Excellent but time consuming. The frosting turned out an almost pure white and I used deep brown, real vanilla, so I'm not sure what the problem was for the other reviewers - the recipe works fine.

As many here have said, my son saw this magazine months ago and has been showing me the magazine every week for his 2nd Birthday! Don't know why some people had a problem with the frosting not being WHITE but I was actually floored by how white the frosting was with that much butter added! Mine was as white as the cover, I just followed the recipe to a T. I got it as smooth as the picture by dipping a spreader in warm water. The cake was delicious, and even better the next day. I LOVED the cupcake cake too - it was almost like a cake version of a cutout cookie! The frosting was great for decorating, and there was more than enough. Don't skimp in between layers, there's a TON of frosting. My ONLY complaint was that getting the cupcakes to balance & be even was harder than it looks, LOL!

The cake was easy to make but I can't say I was impressed with the taste of the chocolate cake I baked the cake just until done and it was kinda dry.

What a crowd pleaser this cake turned out to be! I was quite excited to try this when it appeared on the cover of January's Gourmet magazine. I had to wait all the way until my son turned two in October, but what a winner it was. I did the entire thing with a hand mixer and had no problems with the cake or the frosting (very bright white). The vanilla buttercream, though labor-intensive, garnered rave reviews from all of our guests. It is a perfect not-too-sweet match for chocolate cake. The recipe makes just exactly the right amount of buttercream for the cake and cupcake toppers. The chocolate cake was rich and moist and delicious. The presentation was a huge hit. I'm dying for another birthday to roll around so I can make this again.

What a great chocolate cake recipe!! I made it for my daughter's first birthday (the whole thing, mini cupcakes and all), and since then I have been using the cake recipe itself for all my chocolate cake needs. I am about to use it to make cupcakes for my niece's 7th birthday.

I'm puzzled by the problem with yellow buttercream. Mine turned out very white and I used Land O'Lakes butter and a very deep brown Mexican vanilla extract. Suspect the problem is insufficient beating. A hand mixer will not do. If you don't have one, put a good Kitchen Aid stand mixer on your holiday gift list. It will transform your baked products like nothing else.

Rating: 3
If you want the chocolate cake to stand on its own without the cupcakes up top, try baking it in an 8 inch pan. The eight inch cakes are tall enough to easily split in half for four layers. The buttercream recipe makes enough for generously frosting a four layer cake. The end product is nicely proportioned and doesn't look like something is missing.

This cake was extrememly easy to make so much so that I imediately made a second one for a Sunday brunch. I did not bother with the cup cakes and what not though. The cakes with the frosting were good enough and there was none left by the end of the day. Deffinitly a keeper.

The taste of this cake was delicious, and it was indeed very light and moist- almost too much so. The cake actually fell apart when I took it out of the pans, and it would have been way too soft for me to try to decorate it or create a layer cake. We wound up just eating the crumbs. Not sure if I did something wrong, but this is not a cake I would make for decorating again.

Like other reviewers, my kids motivated me to make this b'day cake. It was moist and delicious, but I was surprised by the skimpy 1-inch layers it made. I ended up making another 1/2 batch for a 3rd layer, which resulted in a spectacular looking cake. I was concerned about the buttercream frosting (especially the complaints about the yellow color). I used epicurious to search out a wonderful Coconut Cream Cheese frosting (accompanies the Tropical Carrot Cake recipe). It was so easy to whip up the day of the party and the flavor really complimented the chocolate. THe color, while not snow white, was a close match to the magazine cover. One caveat is that the frosting is a bit too soft to do elaborate decorations such as rosettes. Make sure it's well chilled and it should be solid enough to pipe the polka-dots.

My 9-year old daughter spotted this on the January cover and told me, right then and there, she had to have it for her July birthday. I am so happy I made it. The end result is a grown up, delicious Devil Dog! I bought the Wilton food colors in the craft section of Walmart. My daughters had a great time applying the polka dots. One of the reasons I like this cake, and will make it again for children, is that it offers the guests both chocolate and white cake - chocolate for the layers, and white for the cupcakes. And the buttercream is melt-in-your-mouth wonderful.

Okay I cheated. I had the bakery prepare an eight inch round carrot cake and frost it.

I baked both the cupcakes and cake yesterday and did the buttercream and decorating today. I love to bake so I was in my elememt, but it was a little time consuming. The frosting took a while to beat, but tasted wonderful. I used the clear vanilla extract(artificial, but I wanted it white) and I also added a little Wilton white color, and the frosting was a beautiful white. The dots were fun and very festive looking. I only had trouble keeping the chocolate crumbs out of my white icing. The cake and cupcakes were both good, not dry at all. Just watch your baking time. I also added Fioro de Sicilia Orange/vanilla flavor in place of the vanilla in the cupcake batter. I am loving that stuff!! They have it in the Baker's Catalogue. Is great in batters, icings, anywhere you would use vanilla and it tastes like dreamsicle! Yum! But, amnyway, this recipe is fun and good and I will most likely do it or at least the buttercream again! Much, much better than Crisco...yuck!

The cake was good but the frosting was very hard to work with. Just after making the frosting it was perfect... then I followed the suggestion of refrigerating it. Bringing it to room temp took about 6 hours, at which time the frosting was oddly chunky and waxy and would not spread on the cake. I re-beat it with the addition of a little powdered sugar and then it was fine. Everyone loved the taste of the frosting but I am not sure it was worth it! The different colored dots was very fun for my daughter to do.

This cake was good...not the best chocolate cake, but definately not the worst. I don't think I am too keen on the buttercream frosting, never made it before, but probably wont again. Also, just a note...unless you are a professional cake decorator the cake with definately not look like the picture. Luckily it was for a 2-year-old's birthday so it looked cute and child-like and everyone just loved it and said they were going to do it for their kids...which was nice but it looked nothing like the picture.

I haven't made this cake but have made the frosting before. I had no problems with it and it came out a very light off white. One tip is to add the butter very slowly and wait at least a minute between each addition. The more air is incorporated, the lighter the frosting will be. It takes a long time - probably at least 20 minutes to add the butter. but it is worth it, in my opinion. The crisco frosting can't even be compared- waxy, nasty and flavorless. gross stuff. It's true, kids probably won't care, but I personally would rather make a whipped cream frosting than feed my kids crisco. If you want your frosting whiter, just add some of the wilton opaque white color. it will lighten it up for ya!

My five year old son saw this cake on the cover of Gourmet when it arrived and immediately wanted it for his upcoming 6th birthday party. It was fun to make, both the cake and the frosting were delicious, and the pyramid of mini-cupcakes was a hit with his friends. I plan to use the frosting recipie again for my daughter's upcoming birthday.

I am a dessert lover in the midst of a non-dessert loving family! Every now and then, I get a request for a dessert for family event and this was one of those items. This was a HUGE success! My family who does not like sweets has already asked for the cake again! The buttercream is the best I've had and has all the richness that you'd expect from a true buttercream - not sweet.

I made this cake for my daughter's 5th birthday, but used different frosting. I am not a cake baker but the chocolate cakes came out perfect. It was very delicious. Not nearly as pretty as the picture but nice. I also made the mini vanilla cupcakes which were perfect for her class party (just the right size).

I agree about the frosting color. I make a variaton on the "Wilton" white frosting with a block of Crisco regular shortening, 1 lb. sifted 10X sugar, 2 tea. McCormick's imitation butter (clear) and 2 tea. McCormick's imitation clear vanilla and enough water (start with 1 Tbs.) to make it creamy. It will be white. My family loves it but I secretly prefer the off white "true" buttercream frosting.

I made this cake just to try it and it was great. Not too rich, not too light. I noticed the comments regarding the frosting....To get really white frosting, you should use shortening and a CLEAR extract....however, when using shortening, you lose the "butter cream" richness, and usually have to increase the sugar added for sweetness. The butter gives the frosting a rich, creamy feel. Use Land O'Lakes UNSALTED butter. You can also add a little bit of wilton white gel or frosting color to it and it will whiten too.

Yum. My 13 year old daughter and I just made the cake exactly how it was printed for her birthday today and it was delicious. The chocolate flavor was perfect and we were all licking the bowl of the buttercream. It seems some of the reviews were concerned about the frosting not being white enough. Our buttercream was a soft white, and my daughter was able to mix the colors with our gel set and apply the dots herself. She had a great time. We used unsalted butter( I am a big fan of Land O' Lakes) and I am wondering if some of the reviewers used a really yellow colored butter. Even with the addition of vanilla it was a beautiful shade of soft white.

I haven't made this recipe, but wanted to comment on the yellow buttercream frosting. I took a cake decorating class a while back and was told that the only way to get a true white buttercream frosting is to use shortening and clear vanilla extract. If you used a brown vanilla extract that would have made it even darker. Wilton also makes a clear butter flavored extract that you can add to give it more flavor. Just thought I'd pass along the info.

The cake was fine and the icing was quite good but the cook from Franklin is dead-on when she says there is no way that this icing is pure white, as pictured. The photo on the cover of the magazine, from where this recipe is printed, is pure fantasy. Clearly a rolled fondant was used to get that smooth finish. Secondly, the colors used in the "dots" come from specialty food gels. Those particular colors are not in the standard food gel kit. The editors of this issue owe their readers a little more! Thankfully the people who use this site are too smart to be fooled by all that stuff.

Not spectacular, not tricky - but it's an okay recipe. To the cook from Franklin, MI: I didn't try this for the vanilla-buttercream, and I suppose it's not a "great cooks" kind of method, but... to keep the icing as pure a white as possible, what about using something like shortening in place of the butter? I don't know if it would work; of course the taste wouldn't be as nice, but if looks are more important than taste (how many kids at a birthday party really care how the cake tastes?), maybe that would be a solution. Anybody want to experiment with it and see how it turns out? ;-)

I made this cake over the holidays and besides being cute (although I did color the cupcakes and pokadots with red and green) it was also quite a hit! I added 1/3 extra batter to make it into a 3 layer cake, and I tried changing the method of making the icing and failed miserably. So I made new icing, but used the recipe from Mixed-berry and white chocolate buttercream cake - I just used 1/2 of the recipe. So, although I did change the icing, the rest of the cake was great. I loved every bite I was able to get!

I made this cake for my husband's birthday and was quite pleased with the results. I'm not a huge chocolate fan, but he is and it had just the right amount of chocolate to please us both. It was moist and yummy but not too decadent, and I'd definitely make it again. I should note that I used my own frosting recipe so I can't comment on the tastiness of the Vanilla Buttercream Frosting. 3.5 forks

This issue arrived the day before New Year's Eve, my son's birthday. so, naturally, he loved the cover and wanted it for his birthday. No problem. Except that it is virtually impossible to add a pound of butter to any meringue and have it stay white, as the picture suggests. So the icing is actually almost yellow, which means it does not look like the cover. Don't even get me started on duplicating the colors of the cupcakes. I am reasonably confident the stylists at Gourmet spent considerably longer on this project than the recipes suggest. That said, there's nothing about a pound of butter that doesn't taste good.
