Delicious! It's very easy with pre-made dumpling wrappers.

Fantastic! Kids helped me make these - fun! I poached them in a light chicken stock and served them as a "won-ton" soup for the children. So great :)

Loved these! I made these twice and both times they were gobbled up almost right away. The Lantern sauce gets better the longer it sits. I couldn't find dumpling wrappers so I used wonton wrappers. The only downside was that the wrappers felt slimy and weird once the dumplings got cool, so I cooked in batches the second time. Also, I substituted sherry for the Shaoxing wine. I couldn't tell the difference in this recipe. I think next time, I will try making my own dumpling wrappers.

I am not a very good cook and we had a lot of fun preparing these dumplings. They tasted great and were very simple to make. Spent a good while looking for the dumpling wrappers. Found them in the produce section!

Wonderfully tender and delicious. I had to substituted Sake for the Shaoxing wine (unavailable in this area). Will make this again and again.

These are divine! Easy! To the reviewer from Philadelphia - how can you rate the recipe when you didn't even MAKE the recipe? Just curious...

Excellent! Had I know how simple and delicious home-made dumplings are, I would have not order in so many. A definite keeper. PS - used square wonton wrappers as they were all the market had, and they worked beautifully.

WOW!! This is the pork dumpling recipe I've been looking for. The "better" pork really does make a difference in taste and texture.

This was super easy and delicious. Something special to elevate the weekday asian dinner to a new height! Served it with brocolli beef and rice. Yum yum. The dipping sauce was OK, not great.

Excellent recipe and very easy to make. I substituted sherry for the Shaoxing wine. Cooking time of 3 minutes was perfect to cook the pork.

I've never made dumplings before because it seemed too hard. This was surprisingly simple and very good. Great flavor! I made a double batch (since I had a pound of pork) and it worked out to just about the right amount for a large package of wrappers.

I really enjoyed this recipe! I don't care for chives, so I took them out. My boyfriend didn't care for the cilantro stems, but I thought it gave it an interesting flavor. Also, I made this vegetarian so instead of ground pork, I used the Light Life Gimmie Lean Sausage Style and they came out beautifully with the time required in the recipe.

Delicious! This will be my go to dumpling recipe for now on.
