This is in my top 3 soup/stews I've ever made. Simple, aromatic to the extreme, and was even delicious the next day. I am absolutely making this again, multiple times. My new favorite winter stew. I used bone-in lamb shoulder that helped add some of it's own flavor, and canned cannelini beans for quickness.

Our CSA gave us a gigantic head of cabbage. This seemed like the tastiest recipe. Changed two things: switched out the lamb for pork (the store didn't have small pieces of lamb) and omitted mint leaves. The dish was great. Only gave it a 3 because I've had better stews.

What a great recipe! This is our new, new year's day tradition. I substituted dryed black eyed peas for the fresh shelled beans, and it was still amazing. Double enjoyment from this dish--cooking it is as enjoyable as eating it. The scents and flavors are incredible.

a phenomenal dish -- healthy comfort food at its best. i made a little extra spice mixture second time around because it seemed a little sparse and appeared not to be enough to coat all the lamb. it is a drier paste so i massaged the ziploc bag a few times during marinade process. the spices are so warm and delicious! guests loved it.

It was very good and inexpensive. Easy to make and fills the kitchen with a wonderful aroma.

I made this last week and used fresh shell beans. It was excellent. I would have thought after the long marinade period it would have been a little spicier but I will certainly make it again.
