Surprisingly good! I added about 1/2 cup of bechamel sauce just add the end, and plenty of parmesan and black pepper at the table. I skipped the caraway and tried the sage. The sage didn't seem quite right to me. Maybe thyme instead?? I'll make it again.

It needs more cabbage and less ham

Hi, I used egg noodles instead of the recommended pasta. Terrific!

Loooved it! Just be sure you cook this all in a big enough pot - I ended up with a kitchen full of dirty pans because I misjudged the volume.

Admittedly, I used this recipe as an inspiration, but my end result was awesome, and I think had I made it as written it would have been delish too. I didn't fry any bacon, but I had leftover bacon fat (southerners always keep that stuff), so about a teaspoon of that and a teaspoon of butter went into the pan where I browned the home-made smoked sausage as opposed to ham. I added sliced mushrooms as suggested by another reviewer - the liquid released help steam the cabbage a bit. I didn't season with fennel or caraway, as I am not fond of either, and I was out of sage, so I just used a little celery salt and black pepper. I used left-over caramelized onions (I had caramelized a big batch the day before and found this recipe when trying to figure out what else to do with them), and they had plenty of butter in them, so I didn't need to moisten with broth. When I caramelized the onions, I did it in butter and I added a teaspoon or so of sugar, and cooked them until they were a nice deep mahogany color. I deglazed my onions with a little dry vermouth too. I used rotini as my pasta, adding it at the end just after I added the caramelized onions, and I have to say again, I LOVED this and will make it again. Had it for lunch the next day and it was great as left-overs. The only reason it gets three forks is because I didn't really follow the recipe, so I can't rate it appropriately.

Made this several months ago and it was delicious. This time I added half a dozen fresh mushrooms and a handful of pine nuts and it was even better!

Surprisingly good! The combination of bacon, ham, and carmelized onion was great. I have lots of sage in my garden so I added a tablespoon or so of chopped fresh sage instead of the caraway seeds.

This is a good recipe to use with left-over ham. I used 1/4 c. canola oil instead of bacon, to lighten the recipe, and both fennel and caraway seeds (1/4 t. each). Also, used whole wheat penne for the pasta. It is a fairly quick and delicious dish that my husband really liked.

How easy and if you are on a "Jorge Cruise" diet, how great! However, I changed a few things which made it even quicker and 'lighter': instead of bacon, I used smoked turkey (no need to fry, just chop), instead of onions I used green spring onions (caramelize much faster), and of course I used full grain pasta instead of the white one. Scrumptious luncheon, thanks!

a very yummy and satisfying pasta. I was looking to use up some cabbage and came upon the recipe. I did not feel it needed the beef stock.

I made this dish with some leftover ham. It was fine......not great. I did not add the caraway or fennel, I didn't have any, maybe that would have made the difference. The onions were good but the whole dish fell flat. Not one of my successes.

This is like a gourmet version of a Polish dish I grew up with (noodles & cabbage). It was very tasty, but I would add about 2 tsp of sugar to the onions before carmelizing next time I make it. I used caraway, but would be interested in trying fennel next time.

The combination looked too odd but after reading others' reviews, I thought, "why not". I only added 1/2 tsp of black pepper and 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper to it. The final product was so interesting and tasty, I mailed the recipe to 2 friends for their Easter ham leftovers.

This dish was fantastic! My husband was in the mood for a red sauce with pasta, and he was very hungry. He was wary of this dish at first, because it looked too heavy, (i.e. not a red sauce). He agreed to try it. He loved it! It's sweet, and the blend of flavors is "beyond compare". A definite family favorite.

This was delicious! It is simple to make and very flavorful. I've made it twice already and it is bound to become a household favorite!
