This was a hit for my summer soiree! I caramlized the onions on the stove top on a 12" inch skillet which worked fine. The only thing I used Walla Walla sweets which are in season now and they took 2 1/2 hours to cook down as they exuded a lot of water. The end result, though, was phenomenol! I am also gluten free and I used Chebe brand pizza dough mix for the tart crust, following the mix instructions for baking temp and time. This tart was one of the first things to run out of on my buffet table. Definitely a keeper

Oh boy... I really didn't like this. And I thought I was going to love it! First... I roasted the onions in the oven exactly per the instructions, setting my timer for each 30 minutes to stir... after one and a half hours, I had some burned onions and some just white onions. The herbs were burned and hard to find among the onions to remove. I dumped what I could salvage into a frying pan and caramelized the usual way instead, for the final 30 minutes, over a very low flame. OK. Followed the rest of the instructions exactly. Decided there are way too many onions, the anchovies are too intense... sigh. If I ever try this again, it will be with fewer onions and maybe an anchovy paste brushed on under the onions... Whoa. Just couldn't eat it. Blech.

Delicious and easy to make (I bought my crust: Farro by Berlin Natural Bakery). I found I didn't need all 20 olives so some were diverted to the appetizer tray. Made for Christmas dinner, (with salad, was my first course).

I thought that the 3 rising times for the dough seemed a bit excessive, but I tried it anyway -- by the time I was wrestling the VERY soft, sticky dough into the sheet pan, I knew I was right. There's no reason why this recipe shouldn't be made with a normal recipe for pizza dough. Also, I found the 1/4 cup of butter that's melted on the pan before the addition of the onions for cooking in the oven, along with the additional 6 tablesspoons of olive oil on top of that, make the onions far too oily. I would reduce both amounts significantly. In general, I would suggest you try one of the 3 other pissaladiere recipies on this site. This one is far too laborious, time-consuming, and greasy.

Excellent crowd pleaser! This was the first to go at a cocktail party. It's a bit of work, though, especially getting the dough on to the baking sheet. The dish looked beautiful when it came out of the oven, but slicing it into bite sized pieces with a pizza cutter made a bit of a mess. Will bake it on top of baker's paper next time and slice with a large knife. Regardless, I'll make this again, as all my guests loved it.

A delicious dish and pretty easy to make, though it does take time. I disagree with the cook from Chicago: this dish can easily be made without a cuisinart or food processor. I used a mandoline to slice the onions, and a bowl and spoon to mix the dough. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written and it came out beautifully. Oh -- I did used salt-packed anchovies, which are larger than the little oil-packed ones.

I had about 2 cups of cooked onions leftover using the required pan size. Good flavor. For anchovy anxious people try this: put the anchovies through a garlic press and toss the pressed solids with the onions about 1 hr 30 mins thru cooking. People notice the salt and flavor, but the telltale fish shape, concentrated fish flavor and bones are disbursed. My guests didn't even guess there were anchovies. I also added about 50% more olives.

Fantastic. The roasting onions made the house smell soooo good! I had very good success with this crust recipe too - turned out very light but with a good crunch to the bottom. Really, even anchovy challenged people should be able to deal with this one, but if someone is particularly frightened but still wants to try the recipe, maybe try sprinkling with ?feta? instead? You sort of need the salty explosions to get the full effect, I think.

I've made this dish more than 5 times. It is awesome. I do use prepared pizza crust from the deli department to reduce time in the kitchen. I also use my cuisinart to slice the onions.

My food-savvy guests simply RAVED about this. It would be a shame to omit the anchovies. They practically melt into the onions and marry spectacularly well. A mandoline was a huge help in slicing the onions. Made the topping as directed but used a partially pre-baked pate brisee crust. It's a bit of a pain to pit nicoise olives, but well worth it. Outstanding recipe.

I loved this recipe. And since most people are put off by anchovies, it meant all the more for me! Fact is, the anchovies do not overpower this dish. I put some basalmic vinegar in the onion pan while they were carmelizing. Also sprinkled on a bit of freshly grated parmesean with the herbs.

As we were anchovy and olive challenged, we roasted cherry tomato halves in place of those ingredients. Plus, we really didn't need quite so much onion. Roasted onion and tomato...wow!

Was this work worth it - YES! I never tackled this type of dish but it was part of French Provence buffet dinner. It pays off to start early and a food processor is a must. I used more olives since some of my guests were anchovy-challenged and it was great!
