Disagree with previous reviewer. I've been making these for the last 5-6 years; friends adore them. I substitute 2 T fig jam (from Whole Foods) for figs and use Callebaut or other premium chocolate. They are fabulous!

I made these truffles as part of a truffle trio that I made for an Xmas party (I also made caramel and hazelnut truffles), all the other truffles were soon gone, but the poor fig truffles hung around. They weren't bad, but they definitely weren't as delicious as other truffles.
