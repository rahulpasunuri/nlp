I used regular flour for this and they were GREAT! Dense and moist, and the red and white made them very festive for the holiday cookie party.

This recipe did not work out. It says to use a large tablespoon to drop the cookie dough onto the baking sheet, however these cookies spread A LOT while baking, and I ended up with a sheet cake instead of individual cookies. I switched over to using a teaspoon and increased the cooking time to 10 minutes, which was an improvement. The cookies are flat and look nothing like the picture. The filling is good and helps to cover up some of the grittiness from the rice flour.
