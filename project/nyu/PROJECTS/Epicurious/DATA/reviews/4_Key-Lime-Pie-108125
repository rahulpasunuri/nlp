This pie was fantastic. Not too tart or too sweet. Since I made it during passover, I used the matzoh-almond crust from the passover lemon cheesecake http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Passover-Lemon-Cheesecake-242023).

this is so quick and easy - always a hit - i omit the sugar in the crust and add a little cinnamon, sometimes nutmeg. I use fresh limes and usually add one ripe lemon (yes, i know this makes it more of a citrus pie but it does cut some of the bitterness i find with an all lime pie) and add a little lime zest... perfect.

Made this pie for my Uncle's 62nd birthday and it was a hit. For the crust, I substituted 2 Tbs powdered sugar instead of regular sugar to help it hold together better. Only had 4 Key Limes on my tree at the time, so I added bottled lime juice and 1 Tbs Key Lime Zest. Finally, for the whipped topping, I added 2 Tbs Sugar and a dash or two of vanilla. Was delish!! Can't wait to make it again!

I checked some more modern recipes; evidently cooking the filling has become common practice since I learned this pie many years ago. At least in published recipes; this may have to do with publishers' fear of liability if someone uses bad eggs and gets sick.

Rating: 3
Baking the pie is a bit unusual, this is usually an uncooked filling. I don't think the 15 min is enough to either kill bacteria or set eggs, not sure what it's for. Key lime pie actually predates Graham Crackers, and I prefer a standard crust; the cinnamon in the crackers is a serious clash with the lime, to me. Can also be topped with meringue, for a lighter touch (this also has plenty of history) or served untopped. Another variation (there are a lot) is to fold the beaten egg whites into the lime-yolk mixture; this will fill a 9" crust nicely. The 2 extra Tb of lime juice help, but key lime pie is by nature screamingly sweet; be prepared for it.

Ah - kind of wish I'd come here first, rather than waiting until after I'd put the pie in the oven. I used this recipe from the Gourmet cookbook, which calls for 6 Tbs of key lime juice (vs. the half cup plus 2 Tbs of juice noted here). The filling was scant for my crust, and not quite as tart as I like it. Still, delicious, and I'll make again (albeit with a little more lime). It's certainly a simple recipe!

added toasted pecans to the graham cracker crust other than that followed the filling recipe exactly. Next time I would double the filling recipe but this was delicious!

I just made 12 of these pies for a senior luncheon at our church. I followed the recipe exactly and used Manhattan Lime Juice, and store bought graham cracker crusts. The filling fit perfectly in each one. If I was making my own crust in a larger pan I would need more. The combination of the Manhattan Lime Juice and sweetened condensed milk was genius. This is the easiest Key Lime Pie recipe I have ever used and the one with the best results! We have had many requests for the recipe already.

Rating: 4
Ok...I followed the reviewer who duplicated the measurements on the previous review. It came out great! Served to my ladies group last night and they loved it!! Thanks for making the adjustments. You really did need the extra egg & condensed milk, only used the 1/4 cup of the real key lime, this way it wasn't too tart. However, if you like it real tart use the 1/2 cup! Will definitely make again!

Rating: 4
Bravo! This recipe is so tasty, simple + easy; perfect for any event or occasion! The only issue I found as many others is the amount of ingredients needed to fill the 9"-9.5" glass pie plate. For the crust I used 1 stick of butter, 1 1/2 cups of graham cracker crumbs + 2 tablespoons of sugar. For the filling: 5 egg yolks, 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk (1 can was fat free) 1/4 cup fresh squeezed lime juice from 2-3 limes 1/2 cup Nellie + Joe's Key Lime Juice 1 small container of heavy whipping cream (more if you like whipped cream!) It's chilling now for 8 hours...will update my review tomorrow!

The perfect key lime pie, tart and delicious. I wouldn't change a thing and the best part...fast and easy to make. My guests asked for seconds. It is very tart (as a key lime pie should be) so a healthy dollop of whipped cream is a must.

This was easy and I found the amount of filling just right. However, it was waaaay too tart. Maybe I got an especially tart batch of key limes, but I didn't really enjoy this pie, and I generally like my desserts on the tart side.

Rating: 4
I use more graham crackers than it says to - maybe like 4 extra. and an extra egg. the filling is fine in the amount there is - but if you want a fuller pie then you can use extra limes & eggs. Also -if you don't have or can't find key limes - you can totally just use regular limes or even bottled lime juice (seriously it's just fine - you might even like it better if the real key limes are too tart for you!)

Rating: 4
Surprisingly easy! I made a double batch of filling since other reviews have said the filing is to little, but I must have a shallow pie pan because I definitely have enough for a whole second pie! Used juice of 3 fresh limes and the rest from a bottle. I cooled it on a rack til col enough to touch, then moved it to the fridge for an hour or so, then into the freezer for about 20 because I'm impatient and it was set up beautifully. We ate it that night!

Excellent! Got rave reviews when I served it New Year's Eve. Used a 9 1/2 deep dish pie dish. Made 1 1/2 recipe for crust (also, added a couple of dashes of cinnamon). Doubled the filling. Baked pie for 30 min. exactly. Came out perfectly. Didn't feel like messing with the whipped cream by the time I was ready to serve it (Thank Gawd I bought a can of redi-whip for back-up). It was just fine and a lot less work. Thank you to the reviewers that suggested using a garlic press for the key limes!! Will definitely make this one again...soon!!!

This recipe is easy and delicious. I used Rose's lime juice and it gave it a wonderful flavor without needing to add any extra sugar. I did have to double the filling, though, for a 9.5" pie dish. I also made a gingersnap/coconut crust as someone recommended. The ginger was a great contrast to the pie.

I made this pie with my pie group this week, and we absolutely loved it! I followed other reviewers' advice to 1 1/2 the filling and am glad for it. Took the pie home and it was gone in a day. This is now my go-to key lime.

Great recipe. Have made it 3 times this summer and have been tweaking to find the perfect combo. Key limes are hard so used half nellie/joe key lime juice and fresh limes. I am not sure if I am doing something wrong but agree with others that the mixture is not enough to fill so I add another half a batch to fill. Watch out with the lime juice(s), I think I used a little more than called and it was too tart. Err on the side of less lime. I used light cool whip as I can't whip the consistency with the heavy cream;) My husband loves it!

The recipe fits a 9-in tart pan perfectly. The crust only needs to be baked for 7 minutes.

Rating: 4
Very, very good! The homemade crust is a must. I couldn't find the bottled lime juice, so I used fresh limes (it took about 7 limes) and was still delicious. Could perhaps even use a little bit more lime for tartness. As other reviewers noted, the amount of filling was quite small, but since only two of us were eating I made the crust smaller and it ended up a good match. Will definitely make this again.

Rating: 4
I highly recommend this recipe because it is so easy and delicious. We had 1/2 can of sweetened condensed milk leftover from a lemon bar recipe, so we added it to the one can in this recipe, plus one more egg. The increased filling set perfectly, solving the problem of being inadequate for the 9" pie pan that some people had been critical of. We used limes (non-key lime) from our tree. The crust was perfect.

Rating: 4
Delicious. I did a gingersnap cookie crust that complimented the creamy lime flavor perfectly. 2 cups crushed gingersnap cookies mixed with 3/4cup melted butter, pressed into a pie pan and baked until just golden. I added zest from 2 limes to the filling and decreased the lime juice by 1 tsp. As with other reviewers, I increased the filling by half, and was glad I did.

First I must thanks the previous reviewers who suggested to cut the key limes in quarters or halves and use a garlic press, it saved me a huge amount of time and energy. I have read many reviews for this recipe as well as other similar recipes which mentionned that the amount of filling was a bit on the short side, I therefore increased the filling ingredients by half and it turned out perfect.

I made this recipe for a Thanksgiving potluck at work and for my Thanksgiving meal at home for family and friends and it was a hit.

This is definitely the most delicious key lime pie recipe I have ever made.

I just made this for my uncle who scours the nation searching for the best key lime pie. He's an extremely honest fellow and he declared some of the best he's ever had, including the pie that started his obsession down in Key West. I couldn't believe how simple it was to make, as well. There are some things that don't benefit from a lot of fuss and muss and this is one of them. Simply delicious.

The simpler the recipe, the more important it is to have the highest quality ingredients. I am lucky enough to have a key lime tree and the eggs were fresh from my hens. The crust came together quickly, and was so much easier than the typical pastry crust. Delicious and easy, this is a classic and true key lime pie.

Good recipe but using a 9 inch pie plate, the amount came only halfway, I would definitely double the recipe. Also just a tip so you don't have to squeeze limes all day is to use a garlic press, cutting the limes in half over a large bowl. I was done in 5 minutes, unless you double the recipe and then it's 10. :)

This was my first attempt *ever* making pie. I've made plenty of cookies, cakes, and other desserts over the years, but never a pie. This was exceptionally easy!!! I also used Nellie & Joe's bottled key lime juice...altho according to another reviewer it's actually Persian lime juice. Don't know. I used about 1/4 cup actual and fresh key lime juice, but didn't have enough so used the N&J's for the rest. I grated some zest in for colour and fun. I have to admit, I cheated in the crust dept...I used the Keebler ready-made graham cracker crust. I know, I know!!! Terrible ingredients, etc. It was late in the evening and even tho it seemed easy, I just did not feel like crushing up graham crackers and doing the whole combine w/ butter and sugar thing. Next time, though, for sure. And when I make it again, I'll probably add another 1/8 or 1/4 can of condensed milk. As the recipe is now, the filling didn't reach the top of the pie crust. Plus it was jut a wee bit extra tart and extra milk would help soften that. My friend at an entire 1/4 pie, he loved it so much! And I used Reddi-Whip topping b/c the house had no beater...tasted pretty damn yummy even w/ all the easy Sandra Lee-esque substitutions! And now I feel more comfortable with the medium of pie. Cool. Oh yeah, I baked it about 15 mins longer than recipe said b/c it didn't seem set in the center. Maybe the oven was weak, I don't know. Then I stuck it in the freezer for almost an hour to turbo-chill. I was able to serve it in a couple hours rather than 6. Everyone was zany about it! And it took me maybe all of 20 mins to make it (prep time only). Totally will be making this again! Makes you look like a world-class chef! ;-) I

Key limes are no longer grown in the Keys. Years ago they switched to Persian limes. Nellie and Joe's Key West Lime Juice in the yellow bottle IS NOT made with Key limes but with Persian limes bottled in Key West (clever marketing huh?) They do sell Mexican/Key lime juice by mail however you have to order on their site.

the pie was very quite good as well as the crust. but what i added was instead of keylimes (they werent in season when i made this) was i used about 2/3 lime juice and zest and a little bit more that 1/3 and it work out nicely. also the consistancy was wonderful!!

I have been making this for years- it is a family favorite. When I made it last night I didn't have any graham cracker crumbs so I used ginger snaps- after processing in the food processor with the sugar and butter it seemed a bit too buttery so I searched for something else to add- found some coconut and threw about 3/4 of a cup into the processor with the cookie crumbs- it is the best crust ever! The coconut gets chewy and crunchy when baked- really good. I will add this from now on- just cut down a bit on the cookie crumbs.

This key lime pie truly is exceptional! I've made it twice now, and both times have used about half fresh lime juice and half bottled (Nellie & Joe's). I'm always a bit late getting started, so the half fresh and half bottled saves a little bit of time. I also put the pie in the freezer for about half an hour in the middle of the chilling time to speed that bit up as well. This will absolutely be one of my summer go-to recipes!

Another crust that complements the key lime filling is a vanilla wafer crumb & macadamia nut crust. Combine in a food processor 6 ounces vanilla wafer crumbs (1 1/2 cups), 1/2 cup finely chopped macadamia nuts and 1/2 cup dark brown sugar. Pulse a few times to mix. Melt 1/3 cup unsalted butter, add and blend well. Press into pan and bake 5 minutes at 350; cool. I've also used this crust for a banana cream pie. Enjoy

This was delicious. I used regular limes and topped it with meringue (using the leftover egg whites) instead of whipped cream.

VERY tart. I followed the recipe exactly, and for some reason it made more than what the pan could hold. Therefore I made a 9" and a scant 8". I highly suggest using a bit more cracker crumbs to make a thicker base, and finding something to add to the filling to mellow it out. A thick layer of whipped cream on top does help. All in all, for my first time making key lime pie, I am pleased.

This is really good. To me it was just as good as what I had in the Keys. When I was there I bought an inexpensive bottle of Florida brand Key Lime Juice. They sell it at a lot of the tourist shops in Key West. I liked the way it tasted in this pie. I'll definitely use this as my Key Lime pie recipe from now on.

This was pretty good, sweet, tart, & all you'd expect. Not sure if I did something wrong, but mine had a pretty soft consistency. Nice, but I would've thought it should be a tad firmer. I doubled the filling (reviewers are right that as is, there IS NOT enough filling for a 9" pie), and extended the time, so maybe that's wear I got off course. May or may not try again.

I've made this several times and it's always great. I made just a couple of small revisions. Add 1/2 cup of slivered almonds, (I grind in food processor for 10 seconds) to the crust. I add a large tablespoon of lime zest to the mixture to give it extra tartness.

I haven't tried Manhattan Brand Key juice but beware of Nellie & Joe's "fraudulent" labeling: "Key West Lime Juice" per N.Y. Times-- Nellie & Joe's is the most popular brand of lime juice, though some note that the label says the product is "Key West lime juice," leading to suspicion that Persian limes are part of the mix. The company, which no longer does its bottling in the Keys, having moved near Fort Lauderdale, will say only that the juice is based on a secret formula. Nellie & Joe's also sells 100% pure Key Lime Juice which seems to confirm the N.Y. Times caveat.

Rating: 3
I'd recommend sticking to the recipe. I tried adding key lime zest to the top, but found it difficult to obtain zest unadulterated by the white bitter bit between the peel and inside of the key lime. Also, a garlic press doubles well as a key lime presser -- just slice the lime into quarters and squeeze through. I also found that, using the garlic press, it took about 25-30 limes to get the 1/2 cup + 2 tblspoons of key lime juice.

Warning: I modified this recipe a lot! I use the crust recipe from "Coconut Cream Tart with Macadamia Nut Crust," toasting the chopped mac nuts first. Because that recipe uses a 11" tart pan, which spreads this filling recipe a little thin, I added about 1/2 cup very soft cream cheese and about a teaspoon of lime zest. (Next time I'd add a whole package of cream cheese and more juice or zest.) Despite what other reviews said, there's no excuse for ending up with a filling that's too tart/sweet. Just taste it from the bowl and either add more juice or more sugar! Sugar naturally counteracts acidity...in any recipe. FYI, you'll need about 15-18 key limes for this recipe, and nuking them first (20 seconds on high) does make them juice easier.

I think this might have turned out better if I had not read some of the reviews and just stuck to the recipe... Someone said that this key lime pie wasn't tart enough, and another person (many) said that there wasn't enough filling. I doubled the filling, and made this in a 9 inch cheesecake pan. I also used 1.5 the lime juice this calls for... Even though I like tart, this was TOO MUCH lime juice, so you're better off sticking to what it calls for. No one, not even me, was able to eat more than one tiny sliver... Also, doubling the filling might have been a good idea, but I think this would have been fine as is. Since I used a cheesecake pan, there really wasn't enough crust to use on the sides, so I put the crust only on the bottom. When the pie came out the sides had a very off texture to it - kind of curdled. I ended up cutting off all the edges (about .75 inch all around), and the middle was super creamy and silky... My family is not much into key limes I guess, cause I ended up throwing most of this away, I do agree that it would be a good potluck recipe to bring to a party of less picky eaters than my family... Other than that, I would stick to the recipe... I listened to reviews and basically wrecked that pie...

This is a great recipe, but I did make a few changes. First, I used Nellie and Joe's Key Lime Juice. Also, I made a Graham cracker crust with 1 1/4 C crackers, 1/4 C sugar, and 6 T melted butter. Finally, I made a Meringue topping with my left over egg whites (4 egg white, 1 t vanilla, 1/2 t cream of tartar, and 1/2 C sugar). I baked the crust first, then let it cool and added the key lime filling before I topped it with Meringue. I baked for 15 mins. The resutls were awesome! It was probably the best Key Lime Pie I have ever eaten and it was so simple to make!

Inspired by a bag of Key Limes but limited by what was available in the kitchen of our vacation house, I made the following adjustments with HUGE success; everyone loved the pie: 1- Used a refrigerated roll-out pie crust, blind baked. 2- Augmented the lime juice with some fresh lemon juice (some of the limes were beautifully juicy, some dry). 3- Used three eggs, mixed yolks with condensed milk and juice, beat the three whites and folded into the yolk mixture. This filled the pie dish nicely. 4-Baked the filling at 350 for about 18 min. 5-Chilled for six hours and served with aerosol whipped cream (at least it's real cream...). Results were fabulous, like a citrus cloud. Will do this again.

This recipe is INSANELY easy and DEELISH! Absolutely PERFECT for a potluck. Buy a ready-made crust, and you seriously have a pie ready in 30 minutes (if you're juicing all the limes by hand). Just be wary of dried out limes. If someone has a tip to distinguish juicy from crappy limes, please post!

Exceptional recipe! You won't be dissapointed. I only had a couple hours to chill my pie so I put it in the freezer and it came out great. Yum!

This was SO good and totally worth the time and thumb ache from squeezing all the little key limes. I will get a lime juicer for next time. My husband who never had a key lime pie in his life had two pieces. The tartness was just right. I didn't really measure my juice amount, though. I just squeezed the whole bag of key limes and that was that. I used cinnamon graham crackers and the crust was really yummy but stuck to my glass pie plate. I will spray with Pam for baking next time.

Not being a very big fan of Key Lime pie myself I reluctantly made it for my husband on his birthday. I followed the recipe exact as well as reading some reviews on how to choose the best Key limes (the more yellow the better). This pie was excellent, even I had a second piece. It is not too tart, sweet or at all grainy. This pie is smooth and delightful. I have already made it twice and will continue to make it, living in Miami it is perfect any time of the year.

I made this recipe multiple times and many said it was the best key lime pie they ever had! I agree. I used regular limes, put whipped cream on the entire pie, and grated some lime zest over the whipped cream and put a twisted slice of lime in the middle for a nice presentation. The pie freezes perfectly too. I will make this again and again.

My Dad hooked me on key lime pie, and this one is great. I add some walnuts to the graham crackers when I am crumbling them in the food processor- tasty!I like to make my pie alittle more tart & will add extra lime juice. I juice either key limes or the regular ones(I know-you can't really call it key lime pie at that point, but it still is tasty!) I'm not a whip cream fan, but will make it and let others add it to their serving as they seem fit. All in all-very easy recipe

Many thanks to the Conches for their reviews. Without them, having never used canned milk products of any sort, I don't think I would have tried the recipe. I am glad that I did.

I've made this many times. I have a Key Lime tree in my yard, and this is a delicious way to use the bounty. Last time I made it, I did not have graham crackers, so I used a sleeve of Girl Scout cookies-the shortbread ones in the blue box. After crumbing them, I added 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup melted butter. At first I thought it would be too sweet, but with the contrast of the tart pie-it was perfection! I don't make it any other way now. Come Girl scout cookie time, I always get at least 6 boxes of the shortbread. They freeze beautifully.

Excellent, but would definitely double recipe - not nearly enough to fill shell. Used fresh key limes, but they were bitter, and the pie was a bit bitter also. Would adding a bit more sw. cond milk counter that? Also, what is a good brand name for bottled key llime juice?

This is a staple of mine that is requested at every family holiday. People who love key lime pie LOVE key lime pie, and this ranks up there with the best. Definitely worth making. Don't skimp on the whipped cream - it is a MUST!!! (I add about a half tsp of vanilla extract and 1 tsp of sugar to the whipped cream to add a little sweetness).

Made this as directed, with fresh key lime juice, except I used a store bought pie crust, the kind you get in the freezer section and bake yourself. I'm not a great key lime pie afficiando, so I have no idea whether this was authentic or not, and It was tasty, just nothing special. With all the great recipes out there, I probably wouldn't make this again.

I love this recipe!!! Reminds me of visiting my Grandparents in Florida as a child. Delicious and so simple.A true classic that I will make again and again.

I am from the Keys - a true Conch, born and bred and not a transfer. Without the whipped cream, this is actually the classic Key Lime recipe from the Keys. However - Whipped Cream is never a part of a real Key Lime Pie, nor is, shudder, food coloring. True Key Limes are yellow when ripe - not green - and should never make anything green. Whipped cream is good - I'll grant you that - but the reason that it's not legitimate is that back when Key Lime Pie was a fixture on the old Keys good cooks' tables , cream of any sort simply wasn't available. We used Carnation, or Eagle - that was our cream. Remember - refrigeration wasn't so great, and we got our "fresh" milk down from Miami, home delivered, a couple of days a week. Sometimes that, too, had been in the heat for too long... This is why the mile-high meringues were added to a pie with a pastry crust. If you had a really good freezer, you could whip meringue into the pie, using pastry or crumb crust, and it would make it a light airy "frozen" pie. And - make it tart to taste. The real one should be tart - but sometimes your limes may not be the same one batch to the next, so taste and add to taste. Please - no food colouring!! And if you ever see a green Key Lime Pie, you know it isn't from Key Limes. Order something chocolate....

Rating: 4
Just for the record - (I'm a Keys Native, rare, but true ) no real Key Lime recipe would ever use cream because cream wasn't available in the Keys until the late 60s. Except for the topping, this recipe is the great, classic Key Lime recipe, using, of course, only Key Lime juice. The classic topping should be a tall meringue using the whites of the 4 eggs, sugar and small amount of Cream of tartar as used by the "best" cooks in the old Keys. It should be tart. Most of the cooking it complemented was old Keys - Cuban and Bahamian inspired. NEVER use RealLime! And Run, don't walk, from a green Key Lime pie!!There is a particularly lovely flavor in a Key Lime - you can smell them in anything. It's worth it to obtain the limes, or real bottled Key Lime juice.

I liked this recipe as it was very simple to make- a bowl amd a whisk and you're done! The last time I made this recipe,I toasted a 1/2 cup of coconut and sprinkled it on the pie after I baked it. I then used a large star tip and piped the cream over the coconut and it was delicious!

This is my recipe....almost. I use 3/4 cup of key lime juice because I like it TART. I also use 5 egg yolks. I have juiced fresh key limes (30 of them, thank you) and I was quite surprised to find that wasn't significantly better tasting than using bottled Nellie & Joe's Key Lime Juice. Overall, people either love the serious tartness of my recipe or hate it.

Followed the advice of other reviewers who advised adding zest to the custard to give it some color; it made the custard only very slightly green, and added a slight bitter edge that I didn't love. However, everybody else raved and ranted about this pie. Those who are not fans of meringue especially appreciated and were pleasantly surprised by the whipped-cream top. Will make again without the zest.

Rating: 4
Excellent! Several people have told me that this is the best key lime pie they have ever tasted. It's definately the best I've ever made. It's worth the effort to make the crust and whipped cream from scratch. I agree with a previous review about the crust. The texture is better if you let the crust cool completely before filling.

Rating: 4
I added lime zest to the first step, which actually colors the yolk and condensed milk to a light green - a tip from Cook's Illustrated. The ingredients are wonderful and I will definitely make it again. Someone asked how to make the crust crispier - just prebake the crust to desired texture (longer for harder). To avoid a custard-like filling, let cool before adding filling and try not to over-bake the pie. The filling may not look done (still a little jiggly in the middle, but the heat will continue to cook the center even after you pull it out of the oven. I hope this helps.

This was terrific. The recipe is also in the Gourmet cookbook. We added lemon and lime zest to the filling and the whipped creme. We chilled it for about 5 hrs before serving, though the recipe calls for 8 hours of chilling

Of all the recipes I made for Thanksgiving, this was by far the easiest, the least time consuming, and the one that made the biggest and best impression on my family. I used regular limes in place of key limes, and at the last minute discovered the store had sold me outdated whipping cream, so I had to sub with Cool Whip. I topped it with lime slices and small chocolate alligators brought back from Florida. I figured at least the kids would eat it, but to my surprise, everyone tried it and loved it.

Great tasting filling and crust, but the filling was a bit custardy and the crust a bit soft. Next time I'll leave the crust in for a couple of extra minutes, but does anyone have any suggestions for a firmer filling?

Rating: 4
This is a fantastic recipe!!I couldn't find graham cracker crumbs, so used digestive biscuits and walnuts for the crust. I only baked the crust for 8 minutes before filling, due to the nuts, which tend to get burned. I live in the Caribbean, so no problem with the limes! Key limes are unique, with a sweetness that ordinary limes lack. Still, I think fresh limes of any sort would work. The citrus flavor really comes out as the pie rests in the fridge. Great if you are any sort of citrus lover. I would think that if you had access to fresh lemons, that would also be delicious. One note of advice. If you are like me, and haven't used sweetened condensed milk since you were making fudge in 7th grade, be aware that you will have to take the whole top off the can. Just poking holes in it won't work, as that stuff is very sticky and messy. Good luck and bon appetit!

Since I'm allergic to wheat, I make this recipe a little differently. Instead of using a pie crust, I pour the custard into creme brulee dishes and cook it like a creme brulee. I then chill it overnight and use the creme brulee iron or torch to put the burned sugar top on it. Turns out great every time.

This was DELICIOUS! I used fresh key limes, it took 21 of the little guys to make the pie. I highly suggest buying a lime squeezer...I have one and it makes the job of squeezing all those limes easier. Mine is a green color, and I have a larger yellow one for lemons and I use them all the time. This is a great recipe!

I made this for someone who's very particular about their key lime pies and it was a hit. Texture was great, tartness was perfect using the extra juice. Fresh limes are a little time consuming but worth it, a 1 pound bag will do the trick.

Followed the recipe exactly, except left out the extra 2 TB lime juice (fresh key limes). Next time I would pre-bake the crust for only 10 minutes...found it a little overbaked. Wonder why I detect a slight graininess with the filling...too high heat? overbaked?

I made this pie yesterday for a small party. I followed the directions exactly and had no problems with the crust or making the filling. I used fresh key limes to make the pie (they are always at my local Wegmans) and while squeezing juice was time consuming it was worth it. However, next time I make this pie I will double the filling. There just didn't seem to be enough. That being said, this was delicious and I got a lot of requests for the recipe.

I've made this pie several times for friends and it never lasts more than a couple of hours - everyone always loves it and scarfs it down FAST. I make it with real Key limes. I like a tart pie, so it's perfect. Good with or without the fresh whipped cream. The crust is not easy to shape, but even if it's a little messy, don't worry, it will still taste good. I do like to use the homemade crust in this recipe if I have time because it makes a difference - the store-bought graham cracker crust isn't as good.

This is the real deal! I have made this version many times and its a huge hit with Key Lime Pie lovers. I've found that when using Nellie & Joe's Key Lime Juice, you need the whipped cream because it is extra-tart. If you can find real key limes they are slightly less tart and work well alone.

Key lime pies are my favorite so I am very picky about how good they are. In this case, my taste buds may have been biased, but it was a delicious pie. I doubled the recipe because I'd intended to make two, but all that filling fit into one 9-in. pie dish. And for authenticity's sake, I manually squeezed the key limes for the juice (and threw in a few regular limes because they yielded more liquid), forgoing store-bought juice. This took a long time, but I highly recommend it. An excellent pie and easy to make.

It turned out absolutely fantastic, tart sweet, set up perfectly. It was very easy to make and is going into my "keeper" file. One thing about tartness, some folks have a stronger ability to taste "sour" then others. So that may explain why some folks find this pie too tart, while others love it.

This is real key lime pie, not like the fake, green stuff you find in diners with hard meringue. This pie tastes like it should've taken hours but it's really simple.

I have made this recipe about a dozen times with the following substitution: I substitute one of the egg yolks with a 3 oz. package of room temperature cream cheese. It is so good. When I find key limes available at the store in the spring I make this pie a number of times. If you use the cream cheese you have to whisk the filling quite a bit more, and I sometimes strain it into the pie crust to make it extra smooth. It's really delicious.

Very easy, though 20 minutes is a bit too low. I have made this twice, both times with fresh squeezed limes and without the whipped cream. I would strongly suggest 1/2 cup lime juice, the extra 2tblsp made it too tart - and I love tart. Also, for the crust I would strongly suggest cutting the butter in half and tripling the sugar. When you bake the crust with that much sugar the sugar partially carmelizes and makes it a little chewy. Definitely better (to me) then the listed recipe.

This pie is good for a quick dessert BUT if you really love Key Lime Pie, the Lime Mousse Cake recipe at this site is out of this world...only MAKE SURE you follow readers' suggestion to DOUBLE the amount of lime juice.

This is a wonderful recipe and so easy! I doubled the filling to fill a large pyrex pie dish and then baked for 30 minutes.

The recipe might be even better without these shortcuts, but considering how yummy it is anyway, I might keep taking them. I like less-sweet desserts, so I love the tartness of this pie.

This key lime pie is so easy to make it's almost criminal! My boyfriend loves key lime pie, so I make this for him often. The crust is really easy to do in a food processor, the filling simply done in a stand mixer. The first time I made this recipe I used the 1/2 C + 2 Tbsp lime juice called for.

I used 1/2 cup bottled Nellie & Joe's Key Lime juice, plus 2 T fresh lime juice to make up the total. I added one T grated lime rind just to intensify the flavor, but it wasn't necessary, and it does mean that the filling isn't 100% smooth. I did not use the crust recipe that was included with this recipe.

Excellent and refreshing! A great spring and summer pie! I doubled the filling & in the interest of time, used the large-size Keebler graham cracker crust and baked the pie for exactly 30 minutes. I also made the filling according to the suggestions from the St. Louis (9/7/03) cook. Also used whipped cream sweetened with powdered sugar and a little vanilla. Next time, I might experiment with adding a little coconut to filling, and will maybe even coat the bottom of the crust with a little melted bittersweet chocolate before adding the filling! I will definitely make this pie again!

This is just superb. I prefer my key lime pie on the tart side, so this was just perfect. I also added two teaspoons of lime zest which gave it some texture and pizazz.

Not bad. Next time I would probably use more lime juice or less sweetened condensed milk. Solid, everyone enjoyed it.

in reading all the reviews, i decided to buy the keebler already prepared large pie crust and double the filling and cook for 30 minutes. i followed the directions from the reader that got the recipe from Joe Stone's Crab website. it seemed like there was too much movement in the center of the pie when taken out of oven, but staying in the refrig. overnight did make the consistency o.k. next time i might bake it for 2 min. longer. i also added minced lime peel from 2 limes to the filling. what a great recipe! i'll defintely make this again and again...

*I* think the tartness is where it's AT, though! Leaving the whipped cream unsweetened counterbalances the tartness. The tart/sweet flavor combined with the rich/unsweet of the cream is very taaty. At first I thought there was not enough filling - the crust wasn't very full. But you need an almost equal amount of cream for that flavor contrast thing. I did end up with some leftover whipped cream, though.

Rating: 2
I think overall the recipe is a good one, but way too tart. I love key lime pie- it is one of my favorite deserts, but this was way too much. The whipped creme (sweetened with some confectioners sugar) helped a bit but you should have seen everyone's faces puckered up past the point of enjoyment. I would definitely reduce the amount of key lime juice next time.

Made this recipe and it was OK. Then ran across "Joe9's Stone Crab" recipe while looking through "Best Of" recipes on foodtv.com. Decided to meld the recipes and the result was AMAZING. Here are the changes. For the Crust: I used 1/4 cup vs. 2 T. sugar. If you have a FP it make this so easy. Break up the crackers & put them in the fp & process to crumbs. Add the sugar & pulse until combined. Drizzle in the butter & pulse until combined. BE SURE to butter your pie dish before pressing the mixture into the pie dish. Make the filling & bake: In mixer with whisk attach. beat yolks & zest on high until very fluffy (about 5 min). Gradually add milk & continue to beat until thick, 3-4 minutes longer. Lower mixer speed & slowly add juice, mixing just until combined - NO LONGER. Pour filling into baked, cooled crust & bake in middle of oven 13-15 minutes. For the topping: 1 cup heavy cream and 3 T. confectioner's sugar. Pie freezes VERY well. Just cut the pie into sections and then freeze. When you feel like a piece thaw one and top with some whipped cream.

This is a fantastic pie. Made it for dinner, and everyone was sneaking back to the kitchen for seconds. The quality of the juice makes a big difference to this recipe - Manhattan really is the best bottled juice.

This is absolutely delicious...the crust is so tasty (I added a pinch of cinnamon), & after reading others' tips, I doubled the filling, using Nellie and Joe's Key Lime Juice and baked the pie for 30 minutes. I prefer twice as much cream for the topping, though. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I agree with the reviewer below--not terribly different from most key lime pie recipes, but easy and tasty. I took it to a picnic and it disappeared quickly and everyone liked it. I made it with standard limes from the supermarket; personally, I think fresh-squeezed lime juice, even if the limes aren't Key limes, is superior to bottled Key lime juice.

Rating: 3
Superb, and pretty much the standard key lime pie. I used key limes that were yellow-green in color, that's when I think they taste best. They start out green and turn yellow when ripe. The greener they are, the tarter they are. Unsweetened whipped cream helps cut the sweetness and provides a perfect contrast.

I made this last night and brought it to work today. Smash hit. We all agreed it was the best key lime pie we'd ever eaten. Sweetened the whipped cream with honey and vanilla. Nice balance between the tartness and sweetened cream. A perfect summer recipe, not to mention easy.

I made this pie for a recent dinner party using a ready-made crust and bottled lime juice, and it was incredible!!! Very impressed, especially given the short cuts I took. I balanced the tartness with a sweeter whipped cream--3 Tbsp sugar, 1 tsp vanilla. Everyone loved it! It's great for entertaining since you can make it a day ahead, and it takes 20 minutes to make. A keeper!

This is a great Key Lime Pie Recipe--I have made it 6 or 7 times this summer always to rave reviews! I did change the recipe slightly, though. To reduce the work, I use the oversized pre-made graham cracker crust from Keebler. Then I double the recipe and cook for about 30 minutes. Finally, I sweeten the whipped cream with about 2-3 tablespoons of powdered sugar and grate lime peel over the top of the whipped cream to decorate the pie.

I must've read 10 recipes for Key Lime Pie before I chose this one. I've made it at least 4 times over the summer and have served it to lots of people.

Ok, so I got actual key limes to make this... and I squeezed every tiny little one of them. The result was a delicious pie to those who really really love the taste of lime. Others reported that the lime was too much and bitter. Any suggestions about how to eliminate any bitterness?

I hope those cooks who referred to 'evaporated milk' did not actually make the pie with this!! I cheated and used a purchased cracker crust. I used the 'two extra servings' size and doubled the recipe and it was great (I only used 6 eggs though). Since it is really tart, the cream is a must. Next time I will use half the amount of key lime juice (I got mine from Wholefoods market). Even if you like this tart, consider your guests might not!!

Made this for a dinner party and received rave reviews. People literally said it was the best they had ever tasted. It is easy and fast to make (we even let the kids help). For those of you fearing the 8 hour chilling commitment, we only let ours chill for 4 hours and it was perfectly fine. I did sweeten the whipped cream a teeny bit with vanilla and a dash of sugar because we used regular limes instead of key limes. A perfect summer pie!

Thanks to the reviewer who recommended the local Williams-Sonoma as a purveyor of the otherwise impossible to find key lime juice. I used W.S.'s brand, and the pie was excellent.

This was an excellent find! I wanted a simple and delicious dish to get my smart-alicky nephew Maurixe interested in cooking. The only problem we had was when I asked him to prepare the 1 1/4 cups of graham crackers... unbeknownst to me, he did 1 cup of crackers and an honest-to-goodness George Washington quarter. The pie tasted delicious, and we were all VERY relieved that his sister Rosemary bit down on the quarter instead of swallowing it. Maurixe was sent to his room, and he promised to never do that again! Oh, we also sprinkled pistachio nuts on top. The colors were intense!

I made three of these in the past week (two for work, one for home)with Nellie & Joe's Key West Lime Juice and each one was easy to make and consistently excellent. The two for work were made with a metal pie pan and the one for home with a glass dish and they all came out exactly the same. The only addition I made was to sprinkle some lime zest (from a regular lime) on the whipped cream topping. This one's a keeper!

Question: If I use a ceramic or metal pie dish instead of glass, ideally, should I make adjustments to my timing or oven temp? Review: I made this twice - once with Nellie & Joe's Famous Key Lime juice (which was excellent) and once with fresh Key Limes (or as fresh as they come in MN! - this one was quite bitter and not very good). I won't bother squeezing 18 little Key Limes again! This crust complimented the flavor perfectly, and the pie was fabulous whether I used unsweetened, slightly sweetened, or completely sweetened whipped cream. It didn't seem to matter at all. My household now gets Key Lime Pie cravings.

I make this recipe using bottled Key Lime juice even though key limes are available here, and it turns out great. I follow the directions but double the recipe to fill the pie shell (one batch doesn't quite do it), leaves about 1/3 of a batch extra to bake as crust-free custard snack. As a vegetarian, I wouldn't add gelatin, but I don't think the recipe needs it. Just bake and chill. So easy!

Simplistic, elegant, tasty and easy! A++ Notes: Do not follow the previous reviewer's suggestion of beating extra to produce more volume. You'll end up with lots of air holes in your pie. Maybe double the recipe and make some tartletts with the leftover batter after you've filled the pie.

I made this recipe using fresh Key Lime juice. I noticed when juicing the limes that the juice was bitter and the pie turned out bitter as well. Perhaps I got a bad bunch of Key limes.

This easy pie can be made the night before your dinner party . I added a a dash of cinnamon to the crust and two heaping tablespoons of creme fraiche to the filling. The creme fraiche makes the pie less gooey and adds a more creamy texture. To add that extra flaire I served it with a raspberry sauce . The beautiful red sauce next to the yellow pie looked so appealing .....ooh la la.......and try to find the ripe yellow key limes if you can. A very simple yet very elegant dessert!

This is the absolute best key-lime pie I have ever made! Doubling the filling was a good idea, but we had a little filling left over, so we made a mini key lime pie in a custard cup! Without the whipped cream, the key pie is too tart, but it is perfect with it. I also used the freezer-chill method, I put it in the fridge 5 minutes after it was out of the oven for 20 minutes, and then into the freezer for about an hour and it turned out perfect! This is a GREAT key-lime pie recipe!

My first time making a key lime pie, and a pleasant surprise in ease of preparation and final result! I made the pie almost exactly as written, except took other suggestions of adding grated lime zest and folding in one beaten egg white. Also used packaged graham cracker crumbs. I did not find it at all too tart, as the graham cracker crust and canned whipped cream offset it with enough sweetness. Used Trader Joe's key lime juice. Will definitely make again, as ingredients are easy to keep on hand!

This is CLASSIC Key Lime Pie and is a very good summer dish. It was VERY FLAVORFUL (like Key Lime Pie should be), so I understand if those weak of palate found it too tart or too sweet. Also, taking everyone else's advice, I doubled the recipe for the filling and it was enough to fill the shell completely with a tiny bit to spare. Very very good. I did not need to chill it for ten hours, rather I stuck it in the freezer for 40 minutes and it came out perfectly.

Key Lime Pie is one of my favorites, but I've never tried to make it at home. Don't know what I was waiting for-- it was fabulous and so easy! I used graham crumbs out of a box and bottled Key lime juice (100% pure juice, avaiable at Williams-Sonoma) and this took no more than ten minutes out of my day. I recommend following the recipe and using unsweetened whipped cream for the topping.

This recipe was just too intense, too tart, and too sweet. I think the quantity of key lime juice was excessive. I make this same pie in a lemon version with 1/3 cup lemon juice to raves. I also think the whites should not have been wasted. With my lemon pie, I use the whites for a merengue topping. If I made this again it would be with less juice and merengue on top. Comments from my guests were "this is good, but whew, this is really tart." Another, "Wow, is that sweet." Next cookout I throw, I will stick with my lemon version.

This is very similar to a recipe we used to make, back when we had a key lime tree. It came from Morrison Woods' "Jug of Wine" cookbook. He used the egg whites though, whipped until stiff and folded into the filling. This makes a much lighter, fluffier pie, kind of velvety. He also used a little rum in the whipped cream topping, and a dask of ground cinnamon.

I made double the amount of filling and used a pre made crust. Also I changed the amount of lime juice slightly, using only one cup of lime juice with two cans of evaporated milk, plus 6 eggs.

Stir 1/4 of hot mixture into egg yolks, mix well and add to remaining hot mixture. Cook 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from heat add butter, rind and juice stir til butter melts. Spoon into crust. After throughly chilled, top with real whipped cream with powdered sugar added to taste. I think you will be happy!!!!

For the Key Lime Pie beyond compare, I recommend the Garden Cafe downstairs in the National Gallery, Washington,D.C. It was 12 yrs ago that I had their Key Lime Pie, different in flavor and texture from the norm, and not too sweet. I could have eaten 2 pieces easily. If anyone knows their recipe, please pass it on.

To Charlottesville and Las Vegas, Key Lime Pie and Meringue Pies are definitely different; both good in their own right. I have often made Lime Meringue Pie using the directions in the Betty Crocker Cookbook circa 1971-an excellent pie and maybe what you are looking for. Have not tried this Key Lime recipe yet but will-sounds very easy and good.

HELP!! I used to make Key Lime pies about 30 years ago (these limes were sold in a celophane bag containing about 6-8 limes), using the recipe that was printed on the bag. Nowhere was there a mention of condensed milk. I comment only because I cannot stand the taste of anything using it - up to and including Irish Creme whiskey; it's cloying. Doesn't anyone make this desert without using condensed milk? As I recall, the recipe to which I referred was similar to a lemon meringue pie, with no topping.

This filling is great. I've made it numerous times and it's always a hit. It even works well with a pre-made graham cracker crust and that frozen whipped topping in a "pie emergency"

It is a very refreshing dessert. I certainly would enjoy serving it on a very hot day.

There are many key lime recipes and this is a classic version. If fresh Key limes are not available, try Nellie and Joe's bottled Key lime juice (it's bottled in Key West and available in grocery stores and online). Whatever you, DO NOT use regular limes or the stuff in the green bottle.

This is an excellent pie - very authentic, from what I understand. The complaints about the small amount of filling don't consider how rich this dessert is. I am lucky to be able to get key limes at a large Michigan market, but I would prefer juice from regular fresh limes to bottled key lime juice.

This was really good and so simple. I thought the filling looked a little low in the crust but I just cheated and topped the whole pie with extra whipping cream. I brought it to a cookout and it was gone in a few minutes.

I made this recipe but decided to use a chocolate wafer crust to offest the filling. Doubling the recipe would help, but the chocolate added an extra twist to the recipe. It was delicious, and didn't last the day!!!

Since I like a high-filled pie, I doubled filling ingredients. I also topped it for decoration using candied lime peels. It worked like a charm on my guests

I actually didn't make this recipe but my sister-in-law did and it was delicious and I usually don't like her desserts. It was very easy to make and she just put whip cream on top to make up for the lack of filling. I thought it was puposed to be that way because the whip cream nicely balanced the key lime. I'm making it for mothers day dinner.

I brought this pie to a party and people were literally fighting over it! The whole pie was gone in minutes! The pie tasted great, the only problem with the pie is that the filling comes out a on the small side. If I were to make this again I would increase all the ingredients by at least half to try to make a fuller pie.

I served this for a Cinco de Mayo party and everyone loved it! I do agree that there wasnt enough filling Next time I'll make the crust smaller.

My first ever key lime pie so no expert, but I made this pie three times in ten days! Couldn't keep it in the fridge. I agree the recipe was short on the filling but it tasted delicious.

Here's the right recipe. The one that deserves 4 forks. April Fountain ( april_islandgirl@msn.com ) from Martha's Vineyard, MA on 08/01/01 I also made the recipe from Joe's Stone Crabs . I am also going to retype it so it's more recent: Use same almond/graham cracker crust as above. For filling, combine 6 egg yolks with 2 cans sweetened condensed milk (one can of low fat works fine). Add 1 cup of key lime juice and 1 tsp lime zest. Blend well, bake at 375 for 10-15 minutes. Refrigerate at least 4 hours. I wanted to cut down on the fat so I made the meringue rather than using the whipped cream. Then I served with a low fat frozen Vanilla yogurt and garnished with mint leaves. Very yummy and pretty too! Enjoy!! See Reviews and the Gourmet 1990 recipe on epicurious. A Cook from Milwaukee on 07/03/01

I made this, my first attempt at key lime pie, with a few modifications: i doubled the crust, used an entire green squire bottle of regular lime juice, and topped the entire thing with whipped cream. There was plenty of filling (probably due to the extra thick crust), and it was the perfect combination of tart/sweet (especially with all the cream). Everybody enjoyed it!

Gourmet failed on this one! Not enough filling and waaaay too much lime juice. I made it prior to reading the reviews and still only used 1/3 cup fresh juice. My husband thought it tasted fine (I had to spread whipped cream over the top to make it look decent) but he did suggest whipping the egg whites and making a meringue topping next time. Well, next time HE'S making it!

I just made this recipe and after juicing all those tiny limes I was very dissapointed to find that it called for entirely too much juice- the end result is exceedingly bitter/ tart . . . if I made this again I would definitely reduce the amount of juice.

I made this for Eater and although it was very good it sure didn't fill the pie plate. It was very thin. Other recipes call for 2 cans of evaporated milk??

I made this pie last week and got rave reviews from everyone who tried it, but I personally didn't love it. The key lime juice that I used (purchased from Williams-Sonoma) perhaps made it bitter. I will make this again but I will use fresh limes or another brand of lime juice which will hopefully eliminate the bitterness. Be sure to serve it with whipped cream-- it cuts down on the tartness and compliments the pie well.
