This pie tasted great! The toasted almonds give the custard portion a very rich flavor. I used blackberries since boysenberries were not available at my market. This recipe does take quite a while to prepare. I started a day ahead--keep in mind the pastry dough has to chill both during preparation and after it is complete, in addition to the chilling time for the filling. This is not a spontaneous dessert to make! This dessert didn't look all that grand in the dish--make sure to make the fresh whipped cream to garnish the top and to give it some softness. The berry topping tastes great but the appearance is predictably gelatinous. Also, I had to refrigerate the topping for around an hour to get it cool enough to top the pie. Allow yourself lots of time for preparation, but if you like almonds and berries, you will enjoy this pie!
