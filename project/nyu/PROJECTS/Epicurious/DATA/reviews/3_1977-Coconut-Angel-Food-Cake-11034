This cake is so delicious. My family said it was the "best cake ever." I frosted it with whipped cream to cut down on some of the sweet. It is definitely worth a try!

Actually, you cool an angel cake over a bottle neck to prevent it from collapsing. When its fresh from the oven, it isn't stable enough to maintain its height. Cooling it suspended upside-down allows it to firm up enough to stay light and fluffy

To the person who questions hanging an angel cake over a long neck bottle, it is the time-honored classic way to cool an angel cake..perhaps from the days of limited cooling space and hot kitchens. Another feature.. .cooling this way, the cake falls out of the pan if it is not done. No dessert-time surprises for sure.

I understand from these reviews that the frosting was not a big hit but what about the actual cake? I'm looking for comments...

Too heavy for this light, airy cake. I never got the frosting to "stiffen" properly so it just glooped off the cake. Disappointing.

I made this for my daughter's birthday at my in-laws and was so embarassed. My desserts made from this site are usually very anticipated by this group. Although it was pretty when I made it, the frosting was so sickenly sweet and discustingly sticky. It "fell" off of the cake in a pile around the base even though I did it only hours before we ate it. It was a lot of work for such a disapointment. My mother-in-law's comment was "At least now I know you are not perfect".
