Everyone at my Christmas table loved this compote. I used ruby port because I had it on hand, and it was fine. The flavor balance is great with pork, works with poultry too.

I made this with the pork recipe and it was a killer combination. I followed the recipe with the following changes, frozen pearl onions, golden raisins, and 50-50 ruby and tawny port as I had some leftover ruby. I am looking forward to making this for guests. My wife was a little intimidated by the whole garlic cloves, but I had no such compunctions! It was an incredible combination of flavors with the pork. As mentioned by one cook, cranberries would also be great in this recipe.

Excellent and versatile. As always I believe in the culinary motto - "Test for guests." (Make the recipe for yourself before serving it to your guests.) I did test it with some slight changes. First, I did not use pearl onions. I used yellow onions cut into approx 1/2" by 1" pieces. Second, the garlic was cut in half or thirds. By doing this to both of these ingredients you make them more proportionate to the raisins. You will then saute the garlic, onions and bay leaf with the butter for approx 15-20 mins and then proceed with the recipe. Keep all other ingredient amounts as the recipe prescribes. The last item to remeber is to reduce-reduce-reduce. You want the flavors to blend-which they do. As others have said-this gets better flavor if made a day ahead and it can be used as an appitizer to acompany various cheeses. The test for my guests worked. It received an A plus.

Everyone enjoyed this recipe men, woman, and my family. I will try it with frozen onions or the boiling onions as it was tedious to peel. Also I would reduce the amount of port. It was a delicious recipe and I'll make this again and again.

I made this with the Pork Loin and it was amazing. I took the advice of previous chefs and made 1 day prior and then reheated and also removed the garlic before adding the onions. Don't be alarmed - this isn't the most appetizing-smelling when preparing but when paired with the pork lion it was fantastic!

I served this with the pork loin and it was amazing! I had to ad lib a little, as I did not have all of the right ingredients on hand. I used vermouth with rasberry syrup instead of the port, but it still turned out quite deliciously.

Huge success! Even the boys and men liked it! I substituted the raisins for dried cranberries and cooked it the mixture until it got thick. Great contrast to the salty brined pork.

This is a good accompanyment for a crowd that likes garlic. If not then remove the whole garlic before you add the onions. I used white raisins. I also substituteed a reduced cabernet ( 75% reduction) instead of the port. That with the white raisins paired better with the wine I served. I finished it off with a little butter to give it a smoother mouth feel and remove any left over vinegar taste from the wine. I have also added this mixture ( strained )to a double reduction veal stock, reduced the combination by 25% and made a really nice sauce for beef, pork or venison. You can add the onions back after the reduction. Also you can add dried fruit in the last few minutes of cooking to match up with the type of meat and wine you are serving.

Only 1 of my 7 guests really liked the compote. Some were put off by the whole garlic cloves. I thought there was too much vinegar, myself.

So good! Didn't have tawny port, so I used ruby port - fabulous. Also, added some shallots in addition to the onions and garlic. I wonder how it would be with dried cranberries in place of or in addition to the raisins?

I haven't made this but our host served it with the pork the other night. The compote was one of the very best dishes I've ever eaten-savory, spicy, interesting-all the good adjectives! I logged on to get the recipe to do it myself soon.

I made this as an accompaniment to roast duck, and it worked well. Used a mixture of white and red pearl onions, which looked pretty. Next time I will probably add a little more vinegar and reduce the amount of butter. Agree about making ahead of time.

I made this for dinner guests for the brined pork recipe that it accompanies, and they RAVED about it! Definitely a keeper, and easy to do ahead. In fact, I recommend that so the flavors have time to meld.
