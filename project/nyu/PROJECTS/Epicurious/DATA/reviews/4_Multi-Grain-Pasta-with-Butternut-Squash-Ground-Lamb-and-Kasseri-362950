This recipe was okay, but not spectacular. I thought it would be better after reading the reviews. As others have suggested, we increased the amount of lamb, doubled or tripled the amount of spices, and substituted feta for kasseri cheese because it's what we had in the house. While the dish was OK, it wasn't spectacular and I don't think we'd make it again.

I did not have lamb, so I used round steak (very lean), which I cubed rather small. I skipped the broth and just used the whole can of tomato, pureed, for liquid. The result is a warm, homey dish. I also used feta and a little parmesan, and fresh mint and parsley instead of cilantro. I realize this results in a different dish, but the textures came together as one would expect from reading the original recipe, and the balance of sweet, savory, meat, grain and dairy are similar. I will make it again and try it with lamb and kasseri.

Love this. Doubled everything but the squash.

Exceptional dish with unusual flavors and seasonal ingredients. I even shared it with the family that supplies lamb to our farmers' market! Can use Feta if Kasseri is not available.

If I could I'd give this recipe a 3.5 - Not totally amazing, but pretty darn good. I followed the advice of other reviewers and doubled the lamb. I also used a little less chicken broth then what was called for. Otherwise, I kept to the recipe (substituting Romano for the Kasseri) the same. Yum.

I followed the recipe, maybe adding a bit more spices and a taaad bit more lamb. I certainly didn't think it needed to be doubled. IT WAS SO GOOD. So comforting and satisfying, while having a bit different set of flavors than I'm used to every day. I didn't really need the extra moisture at the end. I feel bad for the reviewers that had to replace the lamb with another meat, really missing out. Never had kasseri before this but yum, it made the dish delightful. If you can't find it I guess I agree with another reviewer, pecorino romano could be a good substitute... something salty, tangy, and sharp.

*** Spoiler alert *** I made this dish with the recommended changes of more spices, cook and drain lamb prior to adding onions etc., almost no stock, used roasted sweet potatoes / yams. I had a guest for our casual dinner who suddenly went dairy and gluten free (!), so I opted out of the cheese and used chickpeas instead of pasta. I added canned chickpeas to the base and simmered for about 30 minutes to create a "drier" end product. I didn't add the sweet potatoes until the very end, so they had their structure. It was delicious. So even though I didn't make the recipe as listed (OK it is far from listed), this was a great base to work with. The base is wonderful, but even if you make this with pasts, it will be bland if you don't make the recommended changes of less broth, more spices, etc. I think this would be awesome with pasta and some grilled cheese.

Wow - this was good! I doubled the meat, per some other comments and then I doubled the cumin and cinnamon, but not the cayenne. I kept the liquid ingredients the same, but added a little tomato paste to amp up the flavor since I'd added more meat and spice. An easy weeknight meal and a keeper!

A little on the sweet side. So next time, I'll use 1/2 the amount of squash.

GREAT!! A keeper. I used 1 cup of chicken broth instead of 2, and I used feta cheese instead of kasseri, with a little parmesan to finish. It was exceptionally good. I'll definitely make this again.

Beautiful flavors. I have made this twice: once as directed and once with double the lamb for personal preference. Both times, it was wonderful, though I prefer the additional meat (it still was not a meat dominated sauce). I simmered the sauce for a bit longer the second time and that really allowed the flavors to develop. This will become a favorite weeknight dinner in our house. It's complex enough to crave, but healthy enough to serve any night of the week.

I don't know why some people called it bland because the dish was definitely not bland. It was VERY heavy though and that's why it's 2 stars instead of 3. I thought it was ok, kind of a traditional pasta with meat sauce (I'm Italian), except with a few twists to make it Greek? - lamb instead of beef or sausage, cilantro instead of Italian parsley or basil, kasseri instead of Romano cheese (both are hard sheep cheeses). It did have different spices though. I liked it, but my boyfriend clearly did not (but he doesn't like cumin in anything except Mexican food). A few tips: you must use lamb to get the true flavor. If you can't find kasseri, Romano is a good substitute. Make sure your pasta is harder than typical al dente because the sauce makes cooks it more when you mix it up. Add a spoonful of chicken soup base instead of the broth. You can always add more water later if it gets too thick.

Great, light, healthy meal and very easy to make! They were out of lamb at the store so I made it with ground turkey and it was delicious. Agree w/ other raters that you really only need half the suggested chicken broth to make the sauce.

Rating: 4
Yummy! Even my one year old couldn't get enough of it. I forgot to take other reviewers advice to cut the chicken stock down by half. Instead I added 2 T. tomato paste and let it simmer a little bit longer to thicken. It was perfect by the time I added the pasta.

Loved this recipe and so did everyone I served it to! Is in my re-make list close to the top. Very very easy especially for weeknight cooking. Bravo

This was one of the best dishes I've had in a long time. I followed recipe but used 1lb ground lamb and did not need chicken broth. Added squash right before serving. Used diced tomatoes instead of crushed. Loved it and will definitely make again.

Very yummy. If you love lamb - feel free to add more. Also, I'm thinking that I'll increase cumin & cinnamon by a bit next time, to make it more magical.

Excellent flavors, and an interesting twist on the more usual Italian approach. I, too, found the amount of broth to be excessive - it would have required too long a reduction to thicken the sauce - so I cut back the broth to 1 cup and that was fine. One word of caution: When sauteeing the lamb you may find that it renders a lot of fat - as mine did. Since you never know exactly how lean the meat is, I recommend first sauteeing the meat w/o the onions. When the fat renders, strain the meat, then return it to the pan, then add the onions, and proceeded with the rest of the recipe. You will have a much less greasy, and more healthful sauce. Will definitely make this again.

This was good, but no 'wow' factor, but I would make again. I used 1 lb lamb, so increased the onions, garlic and spices. Next time would decrease the chicken broth - 2C broth took a long while to thicken. For the pasta I used med-size shells. This made a lot, but am looking forward to enjoying the left overs.

YUM! Read all the reviews and added some of my own. I cooked my pasta in chicken broth. Used that pasta broth to help thicken the sauce and give the added chicken broth flavor. I also added portobello mushrooms which gave the dish a little more of an earthy flavor. The Kasseri cheese was really great. In the Washington DC area, Giant Food Stores carry Kasseri Cheese. Absolutely a do over again and again!

This was an excellent dish! My store did not have the Kasseri cheese so I substituted feta instead. It still tasted pretty good. Also, I forgot the chicken brother when I went to the store so I went without and it turned out just fine.

Rating: 4
This was a fantastic blend of flavors! I, like many others, eliminated the broth. In hindsight, I may have added a little, but not very much. I also did not add the roasted squash until the very end. I tossed the pasta, sauce, cilantro, cheese and squash together only just before serving. That way everything retained its flavors.

Rating: 3
Great dish to incorporate higher ratio of veggies with moderate meat and pasta. Good results without being complicated. Deviated on one preparation step because my store had run out of pre-packaged butternut squash. I halved a fresh one (unpeeled) and roasted it and then cut the halves into cubes and used what I thought to be a generous amount. The rest of the squash will become soup! Very satisfying meal with a salad.

I made this as written and it provided a yummy midweek meal and great leftovers for me and my boyfriend. Needing something quick and easy I doubled this recipe a week later, added a small pinch of saffron threads to the garlic saute, and ended up with a company-worthy meal for 6. No leftovers and tons of compliments all around.

fantastic recipe, I'll definitely be making it over and over again. Also, I made this with brown rice pasta and it was still delicious.

Didn't love this as much as I expected after reading the reviews. Needed a bit more zip and wasn't as good as my usual pasta sauce that's easier to make anyway. Wouldn't make it again.

Rating: 4
Delicious combination of flavors. Do try to find Kasseri cheese-- it really makes a difference. To those who questioned the proportions, they are intentional. Mark Bittman advocates using just a little bit of meat as a flavoring or condiment. He also recommends a more-sauce-less-pasta approach (see The Food Matters Cookbook).

Rating: 4
Loved this! As with others who questioned the proportions, I doubled the pasta and the lamb, did not use cooking water, and it was perfect. Loved the "exotic" taste of the cinnamon and kasseri cheese. I will definitely make this again.

Got really lazy....and made this a one-dish wonder. I also couldn't find a package of cubed squash, so I used 1 frozen package of butternut squash that was pureed. I skipped right to step 2, and sauteed lamb, onions, garlic. Then added in 1 chopped zucchini and 1 chopped squash along with the frozen package of squash, 1 can of diced/stewed tomatoes with their juice, and seasonings. It was a little thick, so I threw in a cup of chicken broth. Like other reviewers, skip the pasta - I served the "stew" over some pearl cous cous. Couldn't find Kasseri cheese, but Feta was the perfect substitute. Amazing....and SUPER easy.

Wonderful. I couldn't find kasseri cheese so I used a different hard goat cheese instead and I did not add any of the reserved liquid. Otherwise, I followed the recipe, including the amounts, exactly.

Delicious! I agree with previous reviewer that proportions seem off. I used 1 lb of lamb, none of the reserved liquid and did not add all of the roasted squash at the end. Had enough for one pound of pasta and there is still more in the fridge. Will make again, even the kids ate it!

Prepared as written, except could not find kasseri cheese. Everyone was late getting home to eat, so it simmered longer than recipe said. Very tasty flavor to the sauce, it made more than enough for the 14 oz box of pasta. I froze the rest of it for another quick dinner later. Hubby didn't care for the pasta part of this, so maybe next time it will be rice or cous cous.

Made it just to recipe - except accidentally used basil-infused crushed tomatoes. Luckily we didnt notice and the whole dish was excellent. Super hearty winter dish. Lovely flavors.

Made this exactly as recipe, except I didn't need to add any of the reserve liquid. It was already saucy enough. Great combination of spices and flavors. Loved the cinnamon combined with the squash and the tang of the kasseri cheese. Makes enough for a small army so have plenty for leftovers. Hubby had seconds. Will definitely make again.

I am about to make this dish & wondered if you changed the proportions of pasta, lamb & squash, did you adjust the seasonings, too or leave them as written?

Very tasty! surprising flavors for a pasta dish, but in a good way. I want to try it on couscous or w rice too. A definite do it again. Couldnt find kasseri cheese, used goat cheese gouda instead.

This is an easy, very interesting and different dish, perfect for fall and winter. The unexpected spices, the tang of the kasseri cheese and the sweetness of the roasted squash all work together to provide a good balance of flavors. Visually, this is a very colorful and pretty presentation. Mine ended up looking just like the photo.

Amazing! Great mix of sweet and savory flavors and very hearty. The proportions seemed right on. The only changes I made were a little extra garlic, cumin & cilantro.

This was an exciting take on a more Tuscan version I usually make. Great winter meal. I did not have tomatoes or tomato paste so I just used broth and pureed about 1/2 cup or so of the squash and added to the broth, then threw in some additional veggies let it reduce a tad then thickened the sauce with a little spelt flour. Dinvine!

We absolutely LOVED this recipe. My supermarket just happened to be out of ground lamb at the time, so I used ground Italian sausage instead. Delicious. The flavors go together really well - sweet but not overpowering.

Rating: 3
I loved this. I made it pretty much as written, although I used one small butternut squash and it didn't yield five cups so I had a little less squash. I wouldn't have minded more squash so will pick a bigger one this time. I did use the multigrain penne and the flavors in this dish are interesting enough to mask the "healthy" taste.

Rating: 3
We found the proportions to be a bit off. We used 1 lb of squash, 1 lb of pasta and 3/4 lb of lamb. The proportions were much more balanced this way. Otherwise, we found it to be absolutely delicious.

I liked it, but the rest of the family, which doesn't have quite as adventurous taste buds, did not. It was too "different". I admit that the cumin, cinnamon, squash and the kasseri make an interesting combination. If I make it again I will probably reduce the cumin just a bit. A little overpowering for my taste.
