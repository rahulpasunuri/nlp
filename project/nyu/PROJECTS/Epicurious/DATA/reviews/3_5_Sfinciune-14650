My Sicilian grandparents used to make 30 or 40 of these pies every New Year's Eve. We would buy prepared French Bread dough from a local bakery and the whole family would work together turning out pies all day long. The pies were distributed to neighbors and family members and eaten for dinner that evening. This recipe brings back a lot of fond memories of growing up in the Sicilian part of the lower French Quarter of New Orleans.

I made this sauce for a party on a Boboli crust, with provolone. The Boboli is an excellent timesaver. The sauce is absolutely delicious--I love cooking with anchovies. People who think anchovies are overpowering should try this; they give an incredibly subtle flavoring. The pizza disappeared as soon as I put it on the table. Everyone raved about it.

I am a little Sicilian Girl who has been to Sicily several times. My father of 88 grew up there and his favorite dish was Sicilian Sfinciuni. This recipie is just like what you would get from the Famed "Panaficio" Sicilian bakery. My father said it is like his grandmothers.. Perfect! If you have a taste for anchovies.. and like a soft and flavorful bread.. this one is for you.. I verify this is very close to what you might have while sitting at a sunny roadside cafe in Beautiful Sicily!

As an avid pizza maker I had to try this recipe and I was not disappointed. The topping is sublime especially if you like anchovies as much as I do. Lately I've been using a pizza dough recipe based upon on one by Carol Field in The Italian Baker with great results.
