Far too complicated and time consuming. Ribs should be easy: a rub; time in the oven or grill; a lightly-sauced finish. Beard's recipe is a time-waster. Stick to the basics!

I loved this recipe since it was quick and easy and very tasty. I love and prefer a simple recipe. Next time I would put less salt and maybe vary the spices a bit for the rub just to experiment. We cooked the ribs for exactly 1 hr and it happened to be the perfect length.

My wife exclaimed that these were the best ribs I have cooked. I was surprised considering that I have done many other ribs by much more complicated methods. I added some specialty spices, but overall you get a dry rib that isn't a total mess to eat. Congratulations James, we will be back for seconds.

I wasn't a big fan, nor was my husband. The meat still seemed very tough after an hour and 10 minutes of cooking, although they were done. I'll skip this recipe next time and try one that cooks at a lower temperature for a longer period of time.

This recipe is perfect as it is, but it also lends itself to infinite variation- I garnish it differently every time I make it. The cooking time does vary according to the size of the slab of ribs.
