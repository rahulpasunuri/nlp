I was disappointed in this recipe, especially after the rave reviews I read before making it. The shortcakes didn't rise; they were dry and crumbly. One reviewer mentioned doing the strawberries the night before. I tried that and by the next day the mixture was way too soupy. I'll keep looking for that "perfect" strawberry shortcake.

Yummmmmmmm. The ginger was a wonderful addition, and made it a really interesting dessert.

A good recipe. I would add a little more orange peel and sweeten the whipping cream.

I would like to bake very soon; but, I believe part of the recipe is missing? What does one do with the other 4 tbsp. of sugar in filling, with other 3 ingredients of filling, and the assembly of these?
