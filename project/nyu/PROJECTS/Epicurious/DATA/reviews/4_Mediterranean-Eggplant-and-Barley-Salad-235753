insanely delicious!!! My tastebuds are currently exploding with flavor beyond compare!!! I usually follow recipes to a tee but I will now sound like all those who "I substituted this for that" (which bugs me!!) but I seriously think my subs were good pones so here goes: Used almost 1 cup of fresh basil instead of parsley but 1/2 c of parsley instead of mint. Threw at least 3/4 c FETA (yummmmmm) on top and since I was starving (takes a while to make) and my barley was not cool yet I actually just ate the mediterranean veggies!! I probably won't put in all the barley now (half?) as the veggies take my breath away :)

The previous reviews were so helpful I happily followed their advice! I increased the vegetables (used a slightly larger eggplant -- unpeeled, about 1+ pounds of zucchini, added a red bell pepper, a whole red onion and roasted them together, using less oil. With about 20 minutes left in the roasting process I added 2 diced garlic cloves to one of the pans and roasted it, too, to avoid the sharp, raw garlic flavor). I used 2 tsp. cumin (could've used a bit more), used a squeeze of honey to replace the sugar and skipped the mint. I used a full 3/4 c. of parsley and next time will use a bit less, as it permeates everything. I cooked the pearl barley covered for about 25 minutes then partially covered for the remainder, for a total of 35-ish minutes to keep it al dente. The lemon wasn't bright enough so I added a few Tbs of white balsamic to finish. It sounds like a lot of substitutions/modifications, but I kept to the spirit of the recipe and I loved the result. It made PLENTY as a side dish (at least 10 servings) and would be a great meatless main dish. I'll make it again; it's really flavorful, can be made well in advance (and should be, as it's a bit labor-intensive -- though well worth the effort) and is colorful and pretty (not to mention healthful).

This is a really wonderful recipe. So much flavor and very hearty. We served it warm with a sprinkle of feta on top. This one's going to become a regular.

Lovely combination of flavors. I do not like eggplant, and this dish has changed my mind. I will be making this again.

The first time I prepared this salad it was a winner. I increased the spices to make the favor bold and delicious. My family loves it and ask me to bring at all family gatherings.

This is like a taste explosion! So delicious. I substituted 1/2 c. of basil for the mint and parsley and used bulgur instead of barley and it turned out great.

I LOVE this recipe. I am always looking for recipes using ingredients I don't know how to cook with, i.e. barley, eggplant, mint. At the end the mix of textures and flavors was excellent. I didn't have the coriander, and the mint and parsley were long to pull out of the garden, rinse, pull of the leaves, chop. But I would still definitely make it again!

I made this dish with the intention of having it as dinner instead of a side dish--works perfectly well as a meal. The barley makes it really hearty and the vegetables and dressing give it a lighter, fresh taste. I didn't have coriander or cumin, so I substituted chili powder for them--it came out with a little kick which I didn't mind (we love spice), but I would scale it back a little for more sensitive palates. I substituted vegetable stock for chicken stock, since we are currently fasting for the Lenten season. I omitted scallions because I didn't have them and omitted the mint leaves and olives just because I don't like them mixed into dishes. It still turned out really tasty! I scaled back the oil (probably used 6 tablespooons), but I think it still could be scaled back more. Overall, it was a solid recipe and I would make it again!

Simply Delicious!

I already reviewed this once, but wanted to add a couple of things. First, I agree that less barley and more veggies make this an even better dish, and a very healthy one at that. Second, I am not sure why people are having such trouble with both mushy vegetables and mushy barley unless both are being overcooked. Barley when cooked properly should have a little resistance to it, a bit of an al dente feel, which you can monitor by periodically removing a few grains and biting down on them. The cook who rinsed also had a good solution to the stickiness. Both zucchini and eggplant will absolutely hold their shape if cut into the required half-inch cubes, unless they, too are over-roasted, over-oiled, or not fresh. If you have a convection oven use that feature to dry them out a bit.

This was good but I would reduce the amount of barley and increase the vegetables next time. I also needed to cook my barley for more like an hour and the vegetables took around 30-35 minutes to get golden. I omitted the cayenne since I'll be giving this to my toddler, and I used an onion instead of scallions. I'm excited about bringing this to potlucks--it's a great dish to prepare in advance.

This recipe was very good, and I will make it again. The combination of the eggplant, zucchini, and tomatoes was excellent. It did seem like there was a little too much barley, so next time I will half the barley to get more of the veggies.

I have made this twice so far. The first time, I too had a problem of mushy barley. This time I waited to add the spices and rinsed the barley twice with cold water. I marinated the sliced red onion in vinegar while doing other prep, then rinsed and drained. I added sliced green olives, a small can of Niblets corn and quickly cooked haricots verts. My only substitutions were grape for cherry tomatoes and feta for ricotta salata. Next time (and there will be one!) I will raise the cumin and coriander amounts.

I made this today, and had high hope because of all the great reviews. It was OK - but it was very mushy. I followed all the directions as written - but the problem is that Eggplant and zucchini do not hold their shape when roasted, and barley when cooked is very starchy, so when mixed together, it all sort of stuck together into one big brown blob. Next time, I would cook the barley with water only, then rinse the barley after cooking, and THEN add in the cooled sauteed onion/garlic and herbs. I like the idea of this dish - but would totaly mix it up with roasted root vegetables (that hold their shape) and different spices (Indian/curry)

I made this today for a Labor Day barbeque pot luck. I was really excited about using all the great fresh produce and herbs I bought at the farmers market, and thought all the great reviews for this made a no-brainer. Bottom line - It was good - but I was not dying with pleasure when I ate it. The big problen is that it was too mushy. Both eggplant and zucchini become very mushy when roasted - they are not like root vegetables that hold a bit of shape and maintain a bit of firmness after roasting. When mixed with the barley, the eggplant and zucchini all sort of mushed together into a big brown blob. Next time, I would cook and then drain the barley to wash off the starch, and then woould toss it with sauteed onion/garlic and herbs. I would halve the amount of olives (I find Kalamata olives to be very pungent and they dominate the flavor.) I would increase the amount of lemon and maybe even add some lemon zest. The idea for this salad is interesting, though, so next time, I am going to experiment and twist up the flavors - I will use roasted root veggies and Indian spices instead.

Amazing! added feta cheese cubes and omitted the olives but all around a fab dish. It is true - it makes a lot! bumping up the lemon juice is something i would do next time.

This is a great recipe, but it makes a TON so I'll be eating it for the rest of the week. It's nice because you can play with the ingredients as the reviewers below note. Next time I want to put a feta cheese with it.

Absolutely delicious! Perfectly seasoned and hearty. I had cooked barley from another dish so I sauteed the coriander, cayenne, scallions, and cumin then added them to the barley with a bit of olive oil. The only things I changed was a handful of leftover sauteed haricots vertes from the previous night and diced fresh tomatoes because I had no cherry tomatoes. We will be making this on regular basis and keeping it on hand for summer lunches.

I made this for a potluck, it was excellent! I added feta, and used veggie stock instead of chicken, but otherwise followed directions. Okay, I added more cayenne too. Great potluck dish because it tastes good at any temp.

This dish is truly excellent. Really tasty! I served it hot as a main dish and we loved it - I'll definitely make it again. There are some leftovers (it makes quite a lot) so I will try them cold and see which way I like it better. I made a couple of changes: I didn't have enough chicken broth so I added 1/2 cup of white wine to the cooking liquid. I used a combination of green and kalamata olives, and I am not a fan of mint so I left it out. I think the cayenne was a little too subtle, so I will add more next time. As a few other reviewers suggested, I'll probably cut down on the oil as well.

WOW! This was great! My husband and I loved it! I added kalamata garlic stuffed olives and while I was buying the olives, I saw roasted garlic cloves, so I added those. I will be making this many more times!

The first time I made this we just wanted to keep eating more, it was that good! The second time I used more eggplant, zucchini, 1 orange bell pepper. We all agreed more vegies suited us. I use fresh ground coriander because it is what I have. It is also excellent with feta cheese sprinkled on top. It keeps very well for several days. This is definately my new favorite recipe and will be a hit at summer BBQ's.

This was a very nice dish. It was unique and refreshing and dare I say healthy! I felt it was a little more work than I anticipated but it was worth it (meaning lots of dishes to clean). You can skip the cheese, it's flavorful just fine without! I was also out of olives and didn't miss them either.

I really feel that this recipe as written (the only thing I changed was using half the total amount of olive oil) is more of a 2.5 forker. The roated eggplant and zucchini were delicious. However, nothing else really stood out about this recipe. The spices on the barley didn't come through. The dressing fell flat. The mint was a bit overwhelming. I topped it with feta, which I felt was a good choice. All this said, I will make it again, as it was better the second day. Next time, I will up the spices in the barley. I will also top it with my own lemon mustard vinaigrette instead of what is called for.

Wow. This was way better than I expected. Only changes I made were roasting the onions, and I added a couple of carrots to the roasted veg as well because I needed to use them up. We had it as a main course, and I think it would be great to take for a potluck. I can never find Ricotta Salata, and I guess feta makes a good substitute, but I just took a veg peeler to some good parm to top it off and it was tasty too. Try it. Even the carnivores liked it, and it was nice to go meatless for a change...

Wonderful salad. Rather time consuming to make, but worth every minute of the time required. Many interesting flavors in a bite.

I agree this is a great salad. I changed nothing except used rich vegetable broth instead of the chicken broth. My husband and I thought the cayenne was just right, and felt the dressing was just right, too. I think roasting the onions would be good and I'll try that next time.

This was delicious!! I did the barley first. I also cut up the red onion into cubes and roasted along with the eggplant and zucchini. Used less oil for roasting the vegetables and the vinaigrette. It's very good with or without olives.

This is great! I doubled the amount of barley and spices to make it more of a main course. Only thing is next time I might roast the onions with the eggplant and zucchini, because they're kind of overpowering as is. The dressing is good, but I think it's unnecessary.

Very tasty salad, though there is no hint of the cayenne in the final product. Next time I will add a bit of chopped Jalapeno and up the garlic a tad. A touch of salt before serving heightens the flavors, too.

Very tasty. There is no taste hint of the cayenne in the finished dish. Next time I will up the garlic a tad and add in some chopped Jalapeno. A whisper of salt just before serving freshens the flavors, too.

WOW! Amazing salad...much better than I had hoped it would be...I'd suggest doing as much as possible the day before b/c it's a lot of prep work, much more time than stated in the recipe...but definitely worth it b/c my taste buds were exploding!

Great entertainment salad, and quite a main course too. I followed others' advice and reduced the cayenne; the barley, tasted by itself after cooking was pleasantly spicy, but when tossed with everything else the cayenne is not noticeable at all. We'll see tomorrow, after the salad sits overnight...This makes HUGE servings.

Yum! this dish makes great use of the late summer bounty from the farmers market. I agree with some of the other reviews, cut the cayenne a bit and it is easy to skimp on the olive oil

This has become a very popular recipe at my house...I cut the olive oil to 1T for the dressing, and about 2t combined for the roasted vegetables and barley (cutting the fat, per serving, by almost 30 grams) and it is still excellent!

I was thrown off by the only three fork ratings before I made this, so I wanted to add my own cheer. This salad is FANTASTIC. Healthy, hearty, complex enough in flavors that it doesn't taste like good-for-you food. My husband and I are notoriously awful at finishing our leftovers, but we ate every last lick of this. My only suggested adjustment is that while I like spicy food, I found 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne to be quite a kick. 1/8 tsp. seems more than enough, especially if you are serving it to people with a mix of spice preferences. Ah, one other suggestion: the eggplant/zucchini mixture takes about half the time to cook as the barley, so it made sense to swap those steps and make it after setting the barley to cook.
