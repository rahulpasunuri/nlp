We really enjoyed this, perfect for a warm summer night and a cold beer! I used purchased salsa which made this quick and easy to prepare. Plus I prepared all ahead of time, which is great for entertaining. This dish is probably spicy enough for most people, but my husband and I thought next time we'd make it a bit spicier for our taste. Maybe just by using a spicier purchased salsa will add that touch more spice we'd like.
