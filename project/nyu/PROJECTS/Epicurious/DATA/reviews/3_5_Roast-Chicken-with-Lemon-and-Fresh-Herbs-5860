I've made this several times now. A quick, easy way to roast a chicken. I use my weber gas grill in the summer to roast it.

Yum! Especially when made with a Rocky Junior chicken. These all natural chickens have such a fabulous flavor that accentuate the recipe. Cooked in a convection oven is the only way to cook it too. finger linkin' good!

Quick and easy to make. Okay but not fabulous. There are better recipes. Won't make again.

This was EXCELLENT! I've already made this meal about 4 times with snow peas. I loved it and I recommend it to anyone who likes this kind of dish.
