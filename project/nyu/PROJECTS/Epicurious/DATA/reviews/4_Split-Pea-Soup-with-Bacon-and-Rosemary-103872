This was really good. The only change that I made was to add some left over Easter ham. Also, just before the soup was done I removed some of the peas and mashed them, then returned to the soup to thicken it. Served with fresh biscuits. Very comforting soup.

Great soup. I only made a few modifications: Removed the bacon after browning, so that I could use it a crispy garnish; increased the fresh rosemary to 3/4 (heaping) tsp. This makes a thinnish soup, so cut back on the chicken stock if you want a thicker soup. Lovely with creme fraiche!

I always make this recipe in the week after Easter - it's a great way to use the leftover hambone and chunks of ham from Easter. I also use extra peas - up to 1/2 cup additional - and puree for extra thickness. Everyone in my family loves this soup!

This is a DELISH recipe. I made it as printed first, and then tweeked it to make it more my taste. I added a diced russet potato, a few more slices of bacon, and a total of 2 cups of split peas. It was thick and so tasty. It's a little heartier than the original recipe, which I like. This freezes really well and I just add a little more broth when I reheat it after thawing.

This soup had great aroma and flavor. I doubled the bacon (drained most of the grease) and used dried minced onion and a shallot instead of onion and leek because it was what I had on hand. I also substituted 1 can of water instead of a 4th can of low sodium Chicken Broth to cut back on the salt. I added an extra 1/4 cup of split peas and wish I had added more to deliver a really thick, chunky soup. Will make it again!

Rating: 4
I prefer a thicker pea soup, so I probably would use 1.75 c. split peas in the future. Also, I had added a left over ham bone with some meat on it to the boiling soup, which added a nice depth of flavor. I also used a bit more rosemary than the recipe called for, which was flavorful without being overpowering. My boyfriend, who is not a fan of soup, thought it was delicious.

This is an amazingly good twist on traditional split pea soup. The little extras really bring together all these flavors to make my favorite recipe I've tried for split pea.

Rating: 4
Quick & easy prep work. Great soup. I whipped up some homemade garlic croutons in a frying pan about 15 minutes before the soup was done cooking and served them on top of the soup. Like the other reviewers said, I blended the soup with a hand blender and it had a better consistency. Also, this soup needed exactly an hour to cook on our gas stovetop, exactly as the recipe stated it would.

Rating: 4
This was the best split pea soup I ever had made with a few minor modifications in the execution. Upon the advice of previous reviews my intent was to partially puree the soup with my hand blender at the end, but I didn't like the idea of pureeing bacon that had been in liquid for an hour. With that in mind I sauteed the bacon whole, left it in the simmering soup & took it out at the end. I used black forest bacon from Whole Foods that was incredible! I then used more fresh bacon at the end that I cooked and crumbled to be served at the table. I also substituted a little less than 2 cups of the broth with homemade chicken stock just because I had some left over from the night before. And overall did have to cook the soup much longer than the 1 hour called for, the split peas were too firm. Next time I might soak them overnight. I think that using a mixture homemade chicken stock & canned broth definitely upped the flavor profile - I only wished I had enough stock to not have to use any canned broth. Either way, this one will be made again and again in my house. Even my 7 year old who proclaimed she only likes lentil soup gave it a try & ended up polishing off her bow!

a hearty pea soup, satisfying to make, the fragrant aroma of all the ingredients melding together is awesome. i didn't use bacon to decrease the salt content, i did use all parts of the leek for added color, i upped the amt of bay leaves to 3, upped the amt of rosemary b/c i love rosemary, upped the amt of garlic to 4 cloves b/c i wasn't leaving my house, and added tumeric b/c it's such a health promoting spice. the results were wonderful.

I doubled the amount of bacon and also added a small hambone and this soup was great. I made the mistake of not draining the fat off after frying the bacon and then had to skim it off the top. Happy with this recipe-tasted even better the next day!

I often make this in the winter. I've tried making this with bacon bullion before. Very tasty! Tonight I was out of bay leaves, so I instead put in two teaspoons of Old Bay seasoning. I actually liked it better than just using the bay leaves!

I omitted the bacon and simmered a ham bone overnight with water, onion, carrot, cerlery. Strained the stock and de-fatted and added enough water to equal the chicken soup stock. Omitted the leek, too. This is a wonderful, subtle soup and the rosemary just gives a creative, bistro-like edge.

Rating: 3
This was good, but it defininely needed "the stick" to blend everything together into a nice, creamy soup. Without it, the bits of bacon tasted a little rubbery. Took other reviewers advice and made this with the Gruyere/Scallion/Bacon muffins from this site. Yum, delish dinner and lots of leftovers.

Rating: 3
Great flavor but there's just no way getting around the fact that split pea soup just looks plain blah! Maybe that's where the crouton and chervil garnish comes in! Anyway...I loved the depth of flavor. Just enough smokey bacon and tender leeks. Wasn't sure at first about adding rosemary, but it was not overpowering at all. Also love the fact that this can be thrown together quickly and economically on "pantry" ingredients. All around, a hearty soup for a chilly weeknight supper.

Absolutely wonderful! I've made this several times now, and the only part of the recipe that I change is that I double the bacon. Easy, fast and delicious... great with a crusty loaf of bread on a snowy winter day!

I have made this soup for years. It's easy, cheap and so delicious. I always double the carrots and use fresh rosemary.

I was fighting off a cold and this was perfect. I soaked the split peas overnight, used both fresh rosemary thyme since I grow them. I sliced the leeks very thinly so those "vanished" in all the peas; and I didn't puree the peas as they were really soft. The bacon didn't add anything for me (so I gave the bacon to the dog). I'm making another batch to freeze. Thanks for the recipe and all the advice.

Rating: 3
Really good! I didn't use the leeks. I soaked the peas for an hour and didn't need to puree any of it after the one hour cooking time. Added chopped smoked ham steak in addition to the bacon, to make it meatier. Will definitely make again.

Rating: 3
This is a great recipe for using up some leftovers! I have made it several times with different substitutions and it always comes out wonderfully. I like to use pancetta instead of the bacon, and I have even made it with leftover salami at the end of the school week, and it came out fine. I also use extra onion instead of leeks since I don't regularly keep them on hand.

We had a huge mound of leftover ham from Easter, and were sick and tired of eating ham sandwiches. We obviously didn't want to throw it away and this recipe was just the ticket. It was so simple that I made it after I got home from work, and dinner was on the table by 6:15. Very easy, and I think the ham gave the dish a smokiness it might not have had otherwise. I added some homemade black pepper croutons for garnish.We'll definitely make this again!

Excellent. Simple and delicious. Easy to experiment with. Used thyme instead of rosemary. To the cook from Washington DC, I like the idea of substituting turkey bacon, but I'm not sure how that qualifies as vegetarian though.

Good eats! The basic soup is very good and easy to make. This time used the bacon for the bacon/gruyere/scallion muffins instead of the soup and tossed in the remainder of a baked ham with toasted spices from, sorry Epicurious, Michael Chiarello on FoodTV, which gave the soup some nice heat. Outstanding!

Very nice soup. It's winter, so I need comfort food and have no shame - and hence used 8 slices of bacon & more onions, leeks & carrots, and bumped up the split peas to 1.5c. After sauteeing the bacon, I removed it & set it aside to add in later. I used my handy stick blender to puree it just enough - and then added the bacon back in, seasoned to taste, reheated through. Yummy. Strangely, a little sweet tasting - could be the low-budget chicken broth I used. Next time I might add a splash of sherry vinegar (teensy bit) to make the taste a little sharper. Will definitely make it again - seems like a very nice soup to keep in the freezer for those cold nights after a long day at work!

I had never made Split Pea soup before but remember how good it was as a kid when my mom would make it. This version is even better! I did what other reviews suggested and did not puree all of the soup which made for a nice texture. I loved it and it made hubby happy, too. Will make again and again.

very quick and easy. doubled bacon, leeks and herbs. left out carrot because i didn't have any. i usually don't like split pea because of the creepy ham hocks, so the use of bacon calmed me right down as did the warmth of the soup. a wonderful fall dinner.

This is our favorite split pea soup. I've been making it for a couple of years now, but living in Hawaii, not very often. Today was just a gray, rainy day, and if you kick the A/C up high enough, soup hit the spot! We don't change a thing.

I blended this soup with an immersion blender as other reviews suggested and it became "too smooth" - we like more lumps in pea soup. Great flavor though. I added some celery and a few sliced mushrooms, some basil and sage.

This is by far the best soup I have ever made. I did make a few modifications. I used three cans of chicken broth and one can of water and 1 1/2 cup split peas. I didn't use any leek and I used thyme instead of rosemary. I browned a bone-in country style pork rib along side the bacon and left it whole in the soup pot to stew. I simmered it on low for 1 and a half hours. It was so good that even my picky sister who swore she would never eat pea soup polished off two bowls.

Rating: 4
Definitely drain bacon after cooking, and reserve only about 1 tbsp. of bacon fat to saute vegetables. Add bacon back in after cooking vegetables. Use immersion style blender to blend as much of it as you like - gives it a much creamier consistency.

Rating: 4
This is easy, uses readily available ingredients and is superb. My alterations: I use approximately 1 tablespoon fresh rosemary, chopped fairly fine, which is not too much and gives the soup more character. I use a large (49.5 ounce) can of chicken stock rather than four smaller ones. Like some prior reviewers, I soak the peas for about an hour. I use extra thick bacon and cook it crisp first, then cut the bacon with scissors. Because I discard the bacon fat, I cook the carrots, leek, onion and garlic in about 1 and 1/2 tablespoons olive oil, adding the chopped bacon with the split peas (with unabsorbed soaking water)and the chicken stock.

Rating: 4
I augmented this soup with a few pieces cut from the typical kind of ham steak you can get at grocery stores with a single bone in it and a rim of fat. I find that working with hamhocks in most pea soup recipes is a little clumsy, and you end up wasting a lot of the soup in the process of pulling the meat from the bone. But the addition of just a little ham made this wonderfully rich and almost stew like. I doubled the amount of rosemary and added vermouth as part of the initial cooking liquid. This is excellent with sourdough bread.

Rating: 3
Takes "comfort food" pea soup and "kicks it up a notch" with the rosemary and garlic. I used a garlicky sausage rather than the bacon. Yum. Perfect on a February evening.

I expected something heartier than this thin soup. I like split pea soup to have a smoky flavor (which the bacon couldn't really provide) and a thick, almost creamy texture. This does come together quickly--a godsend for a weeknight dinner--but it made me yearn for my mom's thick, hearty split pea soup.

I eliminated the bacon and added a ham bone to the pot during cooking then pureed half the mixture and added it back - it was fantastic!

I made a vegan version of this soup, and it was very tasty. I sauteed the veggies in 1 Tbs olive oil, and used 6 cups of water with 2 vegetarian "chicken" bouillon cubes. I also omitted the leek, and used a medium-sized onion instead of small. I used about 1-1/2 tsp of fresh rosemary. Next time I will use even more rosemary, and add it towards the end of cooking so the flavour is more pronounced (I found it faded with simmering). I'll also pre-soak the peas, as they weren't soft enough after an hour. Definitely a keeper!

This was excellent. By far one of the best split pea soups I've had. I didn't add the leeks and I halved the amount of chicken broth added. The soup came out a bit thicker this way. It was extremely easy and I'll definitely be making it more often.

My roommates and I really enjoyed this soup--flavorful and delish. I used dried herbes de provence instead of rosemary. The only reason I wouldn't give it four stars is that the twice-cooked bacon reminded us of something out of a can. But next time I think I might try to puree everything so I won't have to chew on the bacon. Otherwise, a definate keeper.

Wow! My boyfriend agreed that this was quite possibly the best soup that has ever been made in the history of the world! I did make a number of changes though-Boiled water and soaked the peas for 1 hr. first, didn't have leeks or carrots, added 1/2 cup diced celery, and substituted Orrington Farm Ham Flavored soup base for the chicken broth to add more depth. I was afraid that it wouldn't thicken up, but continued to cook, and after about 2 hrs. it was perfect- very rich and creamy. Topped off with some caramelized red onions. PERFECT!!!!!

Very flavourful. I soaked the peas for about three hours (I don't really think you need to so don't worry if you haven't) and pureed the entire thing with a handheld blender when done. I would have like a thicker texture; next time might use less broth and add more if necessary. Great!

This was my first attempt at split pea soup, and in a word - YUMMMM! It was incredibly easy, and the only change I made in the recipe was to substitute turkey bacon for the regular bacon.

I love split-pea soup and this is the best recipe I've tried. My wife (who isn't a big fan of soups in general) agrees that this is a 4-fork dish. Not only that, but it's so easy to make you can't go wrong. The only modification I (sometimes) make is pre-cooking the peas in the broth and then blending them with a stick-blender before adding them in with everything else. Sometimes I just like that goopy-green texture I remember as a kid.

This is some of the best split pea soup I have ever eaten. The rosemary and bay leaf (I only used one) added such great subtle spice taste and I love the taste of bacon instead of ham.

I soaked the split peas overnight as another review had recommended. To my horror, I discovered just before bringing the soup to the boil that I didn't have any rosemary in the house, so I substituted fines herbes instead.

There is a problem in the proportion of dried to fresh rosemary. It is usually 3 to 1 and based on other reviews saying that the soup was bland, I used about 2 T of fresh rosemary. Also, the soup had to cook quite a bit longer than called for but the end result was quite good. My entire family loved it.

I don't know if I screwed this one up or what, but it didn't taste like any pea soup I ever had, in the sense that the peas weren't soft enough. I cooked it for more than an hour, but this still wasn't enough. Next time I guess I will soak the peas.
