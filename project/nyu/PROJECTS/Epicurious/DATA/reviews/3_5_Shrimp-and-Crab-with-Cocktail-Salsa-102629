As I wanted something to feed 10 people for an appitizer...was in the mood for playing, I cut the recipe in half, drained off some of the liquid in the salsa and played with the spices until it was spicy enough. On a large platter I layered in the following order: cream cheese, coctail salsa, chopped up prawns, grated mozarella cheese, tomatoes, green pepper and green onion chopped and sprinkled over on top. I served it with bit size tortilla round chips. Devine!!!!

This was a nice variation on traditional shrimp cocktail and the presentation was lovely and practical. The ice is no big deal, and keeps the shellfish cold (as it should be) while guests snack on the dish. Shame on you, reviewer from Vancouver. You should actually make the recipe before commenting.

This sounds really, really nice. But putting the shellfish on ice sounds a bit fussy and awkward to serve up. I think I would use this idea as a dip. Place some lovely soft cream cheese in the centre of a plate, pour a little of the sauce mixture over the cream cheese and then top it with the shrimp and crap...then pass around the crackers or small pieces of sliced bread. Otherwise...serve it over a bed of shredded ice-berg lettuce. But then, that just me.

This is delicious - cool, refreshing & tangy! I will definately make it again. I couldn't find chipotles & instead used very spicy chipotle salsa. I served it with shrimp w/ lime juice & zest squirted on it...yum!
