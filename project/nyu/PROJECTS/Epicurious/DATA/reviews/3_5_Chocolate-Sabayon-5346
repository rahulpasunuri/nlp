A very good ratio for chocolate sabayon. To the previous reviewer and others who might have trouble with clumps: Make sure your water is barely simmering, never boiling. Controlling the temperature is the key to smooth custard making.

I like sabayon a lot and loved serving it with strawberries and raspberries to my guests. However, the chocolate sabayon came out a bit too thick and clumpy, so I would recommend straining the mixture both before and after you whisk it over the steaming water. It tasted fine, it was only the looks that needed to be improved. I also made traditional, plain sabayon which turned out well although not very thick, simply by leaving out the chocolate ingredients. That turned out wonderfully, and I think I prefer the non-chocolate sabayon over the chocolate sabayon.
