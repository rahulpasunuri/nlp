Yum yum yum! I used frozen corn in place of the fresh ears, since it is autumn--about 4 boxes, or 40 oz should do it. The cheese is important (I used a very mild feta since I had some left over from another dish, but you should use the quesco fresco if you can find it, as the feta definitely has a stronger flavor). Also, unless you get giant scallions from the farmer's market, you will need at least 12 to get the full 1 1/2 cups...

I hesitated to make this, because my only previous encounters with creamed corn were canned, which I strongly dislike, but there is no comparison. I did cut corners to use frozen corn, and it was still fabulous. A great veg dish for company, as it retains heat so well. Love it with the feta.

I love this. I made it for a cottage party using the last of the season's fresh corn. I put cilantro on the side for those who hate it. I'm pretty sure I was able to convert at least two creamed corn haters. This is nothing like the canned stuff. Instead of a sugary mess with terrible texture, this is a great tasting dish. I used an immersion blender to blend just a bit of the dish, but I don't think it is necessary. One of my favorite sides. (Sort of too bad that everybody like it so much. I wish I had more left-overs).

i am not a cilantro fan, so i left that out, but it was a big hit anyway. i found that even cooking the corn for 15min was not enough for the puree to be smooth. that said, this recipe is a great twist on creamed corn and a great tribute to fresh corn.

This is a delicious side with Mexican food. A keeper!

Yum! So delicious, even my creamed corn hating husband loved it! I added quite a bit of cayenne pepper to spice it up, and I left all of the corn kernels whole. I will make this again and again!

I roughly halved the recipe to serve two of us and used 3.5 cups (1 bag) of Trader Joe's roasted frozen corn, since fresh corn is not yet in season here. I added some cayenne pepper to the butter to punch things up, used half and half instead of heavy cream, and one extra garlic clove. I didn't bother with the blender and simply added queso fresco directly to the pan, which melted nicely. Using chopped cilantro out of the garden put it over the top. Tasty!

As the recipe is written, it looks nothing like the photo. Mine was really creamed corn, since all went into the blender (I used food processor). Delicious recipe. I used 6 cups of organic frozen corn and it turned out great.

I guess I was expecting more flavor. I even used corn that I had grilled and stripped off of the cob to give it an extra layer of tastiness, but that didn't even save it. I used Queso Fresca which is just too mild. Next time I will try the Feta, and chop a jalapeno or two in the mix. I think there is hope for this recipe, but as it stands, it needs a boost.

Simple and REALLY GOOD! The queso fresco, scallions and cilantro, I think are critical along with using the corn cut from cobs. I needed only 10 ears to feed 8 as a side dish.

Delicious. This went really well with chipotle BBQ pork chops. I substituted 1/4 c. skim milk and a heaping spoonful of reduced fat cream cheese for the heavy cream to reduce calories (for 4 ears of corn). I also skipped the queso fresco and we didn't miss it. Do not skip the cilantro though - it makes this dish!

Made this last night and got rave reviews. Here are my modifications: **Used leeks instead of scallions (hubby dislikes onions but puts up with leeks) ** There is no way I was going to cut the kernels off 12 ears of corn... instead I used 2 bags of frozen sweet gold and white corn. Tossed it right into the pot on top of the leeks, frozen. ** My cream had soured so I quickly improvised with a container of plain greek yogurt watered down to the consistency of heavy cream, added about 2 tsp. of sugar to take the tangy out of it. ** Tossed the 6 oz queso fresco right into the pot and melted, still also put some crumbles on top when serving. ** I will make this recipe again, and again! Easy and yummy. Beautiful presentation. ********************************************** Served with oven roasted chicken leg quarters: *2 T olive oil *2 T lemon juice *2 t cumin *1 t lemon zest Toss to coat, cook at 400-ish for 40- ish minutes or until done.

We found this recipe pretty bland. I think maybe using pepper jack cheese and a little bacon in there would spice it up. I will try it again with Pepper jack cheese and some bacon bits. I think I would use can corn mixing the creamed corn with regular corn. Seeing as how corn on the cob is not always available or super expensive to shuck 12 ears.

Delish. I wanted some whole kernels so I just popped the immersion blender right into the pan in a few spots and got a nice blend of creamed and whole corn. And doing it that way also saved time. The whole thing only took me about 30 mins.

This is really, really tasty. I used feta and didn't do any blending--just didn't feel like cleaning the blender! Yum.

Right. Creamed corn. I'm thinking canned cream corn, gross lunches in grade school, or dinner at my aunt's house when I was a kid. BUT, this is different. With cilantro (hello?! go to the store and buy some!) and cheese it is a completely different and wonderful experience. I'll be surprising guests with this for years to come.

This is called Elotes in spanish. If you used actual mexican sour cream,cotjia cheese, jalepeno, or pobalno chiles and garnish with cliantro it is very tasty. Squeezing lime and hot sauce is excellent too!

Really good fresh and leftover. I used Feta and the flavor was really great! Will be making again next summer when fresh corn is a bounty.

I don't know whether we have bigger corn cobs in Australia, but I only used six with the same amount of other ingredients and it made heaps. Was great, though!

i couldn't find queso fresco, so i used some feta.... the hubby isn't a huge fan of cilantro...so i left it out (although i know i would prefer it WITH the cilantro)....regardless....great homemade creamed corn recipe...make sure you use fresh corn!

I made this recipe and wound up only half of the people showed up for the weekend so we had a lot but it was eaten. The queso fresco was great and I too didn't have cilantro, why I don't know. Definitly will make it again. Why? 'Cause it's good that's all you need to know!

Love this recipe! Don't skip the cilantro, and the queso fresco adds a nice texture. I will make this again and again (am craving the leftovers in the fridge now!)

Great recipe. Got rave reviews even though I didn't have any cilantro (shucks!). Next time, next time...

I made this, along with the chipotle chicken from the same menu, and my family proclaimed it the best meal I'd ever made - but really, it was the corn they loved the most. Didn't think we could eat all that corn, but we did.

When you've tried this - you will know what Creamed Corn should taste like - one word - unbelievable.

This was absolutely superb, and by far the easiest creamed corn recipe I've made. I used ricotta salata. Excellent!

The creamed corn stole the show. Served it with the chipotle chicken which was also amazing but my husband and daughter took seconds and thirds of the creamed corn. I followed the recipe as written but halved it (we are a family of only 3). I did not find the need to add more cream as other reviewers suggested. Every part was perfectly balanced.

Just a tip for those who can't find queso--ricotta salata is a much better substitute. Most feta is saltier and more assertive than queso, but ricotta salata has a similar crumbly, semi-salty taste.

This was delicious, esp paired with the Caramelized Chipotle Chicken. I only used about 6 ears of corn and it still needed about a cup of cream. It was a little too thick so I added some milk to smooth it out a bit. Couldn't find queso fresco and didn't care for the feta - a little too strong. Used about 3 cloves of garlic. Did not use cilantro.

This recipe was simply amazing, however, please do NOT go without the cilantro, it would defeat the purpose - I chopped up a healthy hunk and mixed it into the dish right before serving. The queso fresca offered up the perfect creamy consistency. I made this along side the chipotle glazed chicken and they complimented one another so well that I'm hosting my family this weekend just for the excuse of doing it all over again.

Dee-licious. Halved the recipe, but still needed the full amount of cream. As we sat down for dinner, I realized I had forgot the queso fresco but everyone was still so satisfied. I broke it out, and it did add a bit to the dish, but this is an excellent creamed corn recipe without the cilantro and cheese.

Flay's grilled corn guacamole was the top fresh corn recipe for us, but this one is serious competition. I have creamed corn nightmares from childhood and it honestly took a lot for me to get over it and try this one. We were rewarded with a tasty, creamy, silky corn dish that guests could not stop going back for more. When you hear "I'm so full, but..." as they're taking another scoop, then you know you made a winner. I used mild feta, and backed off on the cooking time a smidge to keep the corn crisp and sweet. The corn we had was large and 8 ears yielded a whole lot of corn. I ended up using nearly a cup of cream and only pureed a cup of the corn - my fear of that sloppy creamed corn from a can weighing on my mind. It was delicious.
