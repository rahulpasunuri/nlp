Ignore all this inane chirping, and dig into this recipe. This is one of the most complex and interesting ones I've tried on Epicurious. Beware: if you don't like fish sause, move on. If you do, and if you like complex taste with real depth (and heat), this is for you. 1) the fish: I thought initially I would try this with any fish but just happened to buy Mahi Mahi because it was fresh and on sale. Good choice. The texture of the fish really made a difference. 2) the heat: I love hot food. Love. But both my wife and I thought you might want to remove the seeds of the serranos, perhaps even go with one and a half (I also added crushed red pepper, but that was overload). In short, as with Indonesian food, this has some serious kick. 3) A side like rice might cut the heat. 4) Carmelizing the pineapple, as other reviewers suggested, is imperative. Skip the extra teaspoon of sugar. In short, wonderful and complex recipe that will wow any guests that also have adventurous tastes. If not for guests, then party on without them.

This is one of our favorite dishes for company. It is delicious and unique and so easy and gets rave reviews. We love the pungency added by the fish sauce, just try using a bit less at first if you're not a lover of fish sauce. It does take longer for the pineapple to soften than the recipe calls for, but caramelizing the pineapple a bit is critical.

A BIG hit with the family! I used a small can of crushed pineapple and the juice in place of the fresh pineapple as well as a few dashes of curry instead of the chiles. I also added 1/2 cup corn to the sambal. It was a magnificent compliment to the mahimahi, can't wait to make it again!

In response to the Indonesian person below, My husband is from Padang ( West Sumatra ) and sambal in Padang does mean an assortment of dishes. In other parts of Indonesia sambal means the ground chili condiement served as a side dish. But as we know Idonesia is a very diverse country. And what means one thing in Bali means something completely diffrent in another area. I myself have lived all over Indonesia for the past 15 years. Sometimes you guys are way to serious. Lighten up!

As a long-time reader of this website and the comments section, I have learned one thing: what is authentic to one person (e.g. sambal) is completely wrong to another. Food, like language and all cultural traditions, varies from region to region, village to village, and even family to family - all within the same country. Look at Italian food and all the controversies this website has hosted regarding what is "authentic." I think this would be especially true of a country as far-flung and internally diverse as Indonesia. But the point really is that none of us, no matter how proud we are of our cultural heritage and traditions, should think of ourselves as the final arbiter of what is "authentic."

For those who thought the fish sauce ruined the dish, it sounds like you overdid it on the fish sauce. When used correctly, it adds depth of flover and NEVER overpowers the ingredients. It is to SE Asia, what anchovies are to Italian cooking. Whether this is an "authentic" Indonesian sambal or not, it is a delicious accompaniment to grilled fish, in my case, it was swordfish.

WE REALLY LIKED THE FLAVOR OF THE SALSA, BUT THE PINEAPPLE TOOK 10 MINUTES TO SOFTEN, VERY GOOD DISH. YOU COULD EASILY LEAVE OUT THE FISH SAUCE IF IT IS NOT YOUR TASTE.

This dish started out great, until the fish sauce - ugh. Horrible small, that ruined the entire dinner! Wasted perfectly good mahi mahi and pineapple!

Who submit this recipe? First of all Sambal in Indonesia DOES NOT mean variety of side dish. Sambal means hot paste sauce. Whoever submit this recipe should really be very careful. This is an insult. How would you like if I told people that Hot Dog in US means spicy process dog meat?

I agree, lighten up on old John from 6/15/04. If I had a 50 foot boat in the Hamptons and a cookbook deal pending, I'd be proud as punch. Happy fishing John...

In response to the "dolphin" comment, it's a deep sea fish we're cooking here. There are three names for it: Dolphin, Dorado, and MahiMahi. Don't worry, 'Flipper' is still frolicking in the sea *wink*

There is a fish called a Dolphin. http://indian-river.fl.us/fishing/fish/dolphin.html

Does one fish for Dolphin?? I thought Flipper was protected. Or have we been eating it by a different name?

I love any fish dish being from the Hamptons and fishing on a 50' sportfisherman for dolphin and yellow fin. And Im having a seafood cookbook published by Brick Tower Publishers New York

I used Hawaiian snapper instead of mahi mahi, but I think almost any fish would work. The sambal was quick and easy to make and the flavors were nicely balanced.

Wonderful, not too hot. It took longer than suggested to soften up (and slightly carmelize) the cubed pinapple, but otherwise great exactly as described.
