I made this recipe for Shrove Tuesday dinner. As other reviewers have noted, it is not really a pancake. I wasn't overwhelmed by the flavour combination, and I personally found it a little too cheesy. It is more of a frittata than anything else.

Don't skimp on the bacon fat. That's what helps it rise. I make a smilar "dutch baby" or German Pancake that uses butter which is really important for a nice puffy rise. Looking forward to making this one. Topped with smoked salmon maybe?

Great Flavor - I added some gouda and good quality crab meat to the mix and it was fantastic!

Four forks because this dish is easy and extraordinarily versatile. I have made it a variety of ways--sometimes susbstituting onions for leeks, chorizo for bacon--and it always comes out delicious. I once forgot to put the flour in (what was I thinking?) and it came out a bit flatter, and eggier, but still tasty. Foolproof (just the way I like 'em!).

Pretty much like a frittata or crustless quiche. Pleasant, and a nice side with soup or a salad. Agree with the previous poster that you can just whisk the ingrediants together instead of using the food processor. You could easily use onions instead of the leeks if that is all you have, and you could use other cheese too.

Yummy combo! But it really should be called a Gouda, Bacon, Leek Omelet. Unfortunately, I overbrowned the bacon and leeks, which probably accounted for them sticking to the skillet once the omelet was done. Why does this recipe call for a food processor to blend the mixture? Seems like an awful lot of trouble when a good whisk will do.

A quite tasty, easy dish to make. Recommended for anyone not suffering from heart disease.

These flavors are really great together. Next time I will follow the suggestion to remove extra baconfat from the skillet before proceeding (my bad) and I will add a little more gouda.

i made this pancake as an accompaniment to my salad course for a dinner party. cut into little slivers, it was a great counterpoint to my rather tart dijon vinaigrette. it's also really easy to make this as a vegetarian dish by leaving out the bacon. make sure to add a little extra oil, though, if you do.

I'm surprised that I'm the first person to comment on this recipe. It deserves some more attention. The ingredients blended beautifully. Just remember to wash the leeks thoroughly to remove all the sand.
