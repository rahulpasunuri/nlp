This was the first time I made corn bread stuffing as opposed to regular bread stuffing. We enjoyed this dish, but parts ended up a bit mushy. I would use more care in combining the ingredients next time. I used turkey bacon and baked the entire amount in a 9x13" dish which fit perfectly.

Actually, I changed the recipe quite a bit and made the best stuffing I've ever had. I used onion instead of shallot (only because I didn't have any on hand), omitted the pecans and eggs, and added fresh herbs instead of dried. Oh my. I also used hickory smoked bacon, which might be the best stuffing ingredient I have ever tried. It added a nice smoky flavor that blended beautifully with the herbs.

This recipe is great! In order that the my brother could eat this, I didn't use the bacon and I replaced the chicken broth with vegetable broth. I also left out the pecans for my sister's benefit. Everyone liked this and that is saying a lot for my family. I can't wait to make it the way it was written; the bacon and pecans are going to take this recipe to the moon and back. Thank you!

I am making this for christmas dinner with a couple of changes. Instead of bacon I am using panceta, and I am replacing the toasted pecans with fresh roasted chestnuts. It is going to be a great stuffing.

Great recipe! Made it for Thankgiving dinner and everyone loved it! Very flavorful and moist. I might add a little sugar next time I make it, but I just like a little sweetness in my cornbread dressing. Highly recommend this recipe!

I've made this recipe every Thanksgiving since 1999. My family always asks for it and I will be making it again this Thanksgiving. I do make a few minor additions -- some chopped dried cranberries and about 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce to bind it (with the eggs) and to add a subtle hint of sweetness. YUMMY!

This has just become a family tradition. I cooked the entire recipe outside the bird in a 13 X 9 X 2 baking dish. I added an extra 1/2 cup of broth to make up for the juices that would have come from the turkey. Rich, flavorful, aromatic -- it says Thanksgiving.

In our family, there are prerequisites when it comes to holiday dinners. This is one of those recipies. Must not come out of the kitchen without it.

This was barely edible in my opinion and the opinion of my 6 guests. The texture was gritty and neither the pecans nor the bacon gave it enough flavor. There are other corn bread stuffings on this site that are much better. Clearly a difference of opinion on this recipe ... consider it carefully.

Wow, it's been 11 years! I have made this recipe since the day it came out, and every single year since. The turkeys have varied, but I would fear retalliation if I were to skip this recipe. The combination of flavors is exceptional, as well as the mixture of textures. I have made it in and out of the turkey and on its own with other meats. It is definitely a winner, and the recipe is very balanced as it is. Take away the thyme or the bacon, and it sounds logical that it feels like it is missing something. I love it just as it is, as so do my kids, friends and family. Definitel a 4 forker for me...

Absolute heaven - I followed this recipe precisely (a rare event) and I couldn't be happier with the result. I completely agree that the only thing it needs is more - and it makes a healthy amount to begin with! Ok, so the one thing I changed was using yellow (Indian Head stone ground) cornmeal in the cornbread, rather than white, and Berkshire extra-thick cut bacon. Cooked the entire recipe outside the turkey in a 13 x 9 inch baking dish. For me, this is the apex of comfort food.

I made this recipe for my yearly Thanksgiving dinner for friends and family here in Holland. It is a United Nations table of different cultures who have never had a whole roasted turkey or stuffing before my annual celebration.Cornbread is unheard of here, so this was a different stuffing for everyone. This recipe was a winner. I did use 1 package of cornbread stuffing mix (instead of making cornbread) as cornmeal is very difficult to find here and I had a friend bring me the stuffing mix when she came for a visit. I used pancetta bacon and the out come was fantastic. This is a great cornbread stuffing recipe that my guest loved!

I agree with the guy who followed the recipe to the LETTER. I took his advice and made a double batch. Hasn't finished cooking yet but the nibble I just sampled is delicious and flavorable. The variety of textures in this dish REALLY work! In case anyone is considering this, I thought I'd give my input early enough for 2006 holiday. Otherwise, I may have given it a 4 forks, had I waited for it to finish baking!

I made this stuffing last year, when my wife and I hosted our Family Thanksgiving for the first time. This recipe disappeared before the turkey was dented. My only advice, make more. Better to have leftovers than to run out during the meal. Also, don't leave out the eggs - they bind the stuffing, and that's probably why the reviewer below didn't like the consistency. Pork fat rules. Use the bacon.

I didn't care for this at all. I love cornbread on its own, but didn't at all like the texture of the cornbread in this stuffing. I did reduce the amount of dried thyme as a whole Tablespoon of it seemed a lot for this amount of stuffing. I also didn't add the eggs because I didn't want them and have never used them in a stuffing. By the way, I don't see how this amount would be sufficient for 12 people. Like the reviewer below, I also know how to manipulate recipes, and if I felt that my changes or omissions might have affected how I view the recipe I'd admit it, but it was the cornbread texture of it that I didn't like.

I think if you eliminate bacon from a stuffing recipe it will have significant effects on the flavor and consistency. So, to the reveiwer who "followed the recipe exactly except for the bacon" probably didn't give it enough of a chance. I just loved this stuffing, and might make it again without bacon to see the difference for myself.

It is unusual for me to differ so drastically from other reviewers on this site. I hated this recipe and so did my guests. I followed it exactly, except for the bacon. I know how to cook, and I know how to manipulate a recipe if I need to, but this stuffing had an unpleasant consistancy and the thyme overpowered the flavor. It is unfortunate as this was my Thanksgiving stuffing which is usually my favorite part of the meal.

This recipe is wonderful. I've also tried it with wheat breads and it's just as delicious.

Easy to make. I did not stuff a turkey with the stuffing and just baked it in a casserole. I added more chicken stock to keep it moist. Delicious!

For my first turkey ever, I opted for corn bread (as opposed to wheat bread) stuffing because my partner loves corn bread. This stuffing was a big hit. People really liked the pecans. I thought the shallots were a key ingredient. I used smoked turkey leg instead of bacon and, as a result, I felt the stuffing could use more herbs/seasoning, but my "audience" disagreed with me.

I've been searching for a great cornbread stuffing recipe for years, and I've finally found one that fits the bill. Simply delicious.

I made this recipe because it accompanied the turkey recipe I decided to try last year. This is really good "traditional" stuffing. I'm making it again this year.
