Good recipe. Easy to make. A half a can of black eye peas work well. Could use a little more sweetness. Perhaps some brown sugar or honey could be added to the recipe. 1% milk works fine. Goes well with "Sticky Spicy Ribs" recipe on epicurious.

I didn't know what to expect because I had not tried muffins with beans in them, but I expected something creamier; however, in spite of the butter and cheese they were a bit dry. Maybe I overcooked them. Also, they had a bitter taste, I believe from the large amount of baking powder, and they were too salty, so I would cut most of the salt out.

I made these for New Year's last year and they were delicious! I just made them again, and I wasn't disappointed -- of course they're great, they're loaded with cheese and butter. The recipe makes more like 18 than 12, although they didn't rise as much as I expected, so I could have made them bigger.

These were yummy. I'd be careful not to cook the black-eyed peas too done (it's simple to get them mushy). I used cilantro instead of parsley.

The black-eyed peas were subtle and good, but I didn't care for the flavor imparted by the jalapenos. 1/2 can of black-eyed peas was a suitable substitute for the dried peas.

Tasty and different. I like the subtle flavor of the peas. I substituted canned black-eyed peas and white cornmeal.

My roommate and I loved this recipe. I substituted a can of Roman beans I had on hand for the 1/3 c. of black beans, assuming that they would cook up to the equivalent amount. I substituted dried parsley to save a trip to the market. They still turned out great!

If you believe black-eyed peas bring new-year's luck, make a batch of this cornbread for your friends and family and deliver it on New Year's Day. (I bake mine in mini loaf pans.) Or, if friends and family are calling on you, serve the muffins on your New Year's Day brunch buffet. Happy 2001!
