Easy to make but not as special as I had hoped. The tarragon and lemon juice gave it a nice, fresh taste but I had higher hopes for what the cherries would bring to the sandwich and it was a bit of a disappointment. If I made it again, I might try using more than 1/3 cup.

If I were rating this I would give it 4 stars, but I think my version was just a bit too different to do so. I omitted the tarragon as I've never been a fan, replaced the walnuts with sliced almonds since they go so well with cherries, used 1/4 cup lowfat mayo and 1/4 cup regular mayo, and ate the salad wrapped in the lettuce leaves since I ran out of bread. This one's a keeper. It's so delicious I think I'm going to have to keep it in the fridge all the time! I gather this originally appeared in a health mag. I suppose I'm doing away with a bit of that by adding regular mayo, but eating it in the lettuce (i.e. sans bread) is more carb-friendly, so I suppose it still has something going for it in that direction!

This was speedy and delicious! I'm trying to streamline quick lunches that will keep for a couple days so I spend less time cooking between classes, and this works great. I used less mayonnaise and 2 cans of chunk chicken breast (cheaper!) instead of 2 cups, and replaced the shallots with chopped onion. If you like more complicated flavor, use more cherries and chop them very finely. Delicious!

This was delicous! I eyeballed all the amounts, which makes it easy to make and it will be easy to remember, so it can become one of my staple recipies without having to actually look it up. I toasted the walnuts for a little smoky flavor. I also smashed a slice or two of avadaco on the bread before putting down the salad, to keep the bread from being dry. All in all, a delicious sandwich where the flavors blended together wonderfully!
