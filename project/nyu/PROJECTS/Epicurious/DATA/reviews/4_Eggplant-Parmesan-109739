I used a high end tomato/meat sauce from a local deli to save time. The panko crumbs really made this eggplant dish. Don't skimp on the olive oil to save calories, you really need the oil to make the eggplant melt in your mouth. I added extra basil on top of the parmesan slices. Just tore it into pieces by hand.

This was good but not great. I expected the sauce to be better after spending so much time on the tomatoes. I will not be making this again.

This is the best eggplant parm I have had. The eggplant is tender and flavorful and the sauce is to die for.

Rating: 3
The flavor of this was fantastic. My only complaint is that you lose the great texture of the crispy panko once you assemble and bake. Would make again but probably put it together in a different way - maybe bake the cheese on the eggplant and put sauce on at the last minute.

Eggplant Parm has always been a favorite of mine (at a restaurant, but never homemade). Until I found this recipe about a year and a half ago. The recipe is outstanding. Now this recipe is a regular in my kitchen. I admit that on occasion I use prepared sauce, and its still amazing. I have also found that it is just as delicious when brushed with olive oil and baked instead of fried. After baking until crispy I layer the crispy eggplant rounds with sauce and fresh mozzarella and bake until the cheese is bubbly and melted. The panko crust on the eggplant stays nice and crispy that way.

This recipe is outstanding!!! Can I give it 5 stars? I followed the recipe exactly except I used my own homemade sauce, Gluten free bread crumbs and asiago mixed with the bread crumbs. It was amazing!!! Definitely a keeper and will happily enter the rotation.

Really good. I used a different sauce for this, but it was similar to this recipe's. I used crushed tomatoes San Marzanos instead of the plum tomatoes.

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious!!!!! Like another reviewer I cannot have any gluten so I used Bob's Red Mill All Purpose Flour and a GF Panko Bread crumb that I found at whole foods. I also cheated on the sauce (I just used a nice brand of jarred sauce and added some fresh basil). I brought this to a casual dinner party and it was a huge hit!!! People were shocked that it was gluten free and everyone enjoyed it and requested some of the leftovers.

Rating: 4
Fantastic! And for anyone out there with a gluten problem, I substituted King Arthur all-purpose GF flour and Kinikinnick's GF panko-style crumbs and it tastes like old times. Also halved the recipe and can't wait to take some leftovers to work tomorrow. A winner!

Ridiculously Delicious!! Will definitely make this a family favorite in the future.

Definitely need to halve this recipe if you aren't serving 8 people. For the sauce, I used: two 28-oz. cans of pureed tomatoes, 3 cloves of garlic, 1 tsp. sugar, 3/4 tsp red pepper flakes, and 5 cubes of frozen basil (which is equivalent to 5 tsp. frozen basil). I also used Parmesan cheese straight from the bottle & doubled it in the panko breadcrumb mixture. The fried eggplant that was created before baking was really yummy just on its own.

I made a smaller batch. Only used one eggplant and it still fed 6. Its very good so I'm happy to have the leftovers. I posted the scaled down version plus lots of pictures of the process to my blog, Spoons to Sporks if anyone's interested.

I made a much smaller batch - sliced one eggplant and sprinkled with coarse salt, then laid out on heavy towel and left in the refrigerator while I went to work. Rinsed off the salt, dried the slices, and proceeded with the flour/egg/panko and fried in vegetable oil. Took a really lazy approach to the sauce - used one can of quality crushed tomatoes, to which I added about 1/4 cup of good pesto. Next time I will add some red pepper flakes, but I must say this was a truly exceptional(and easy) weeknight meal. 4 servings.

1 large eggplant was more than enough for entire family (2 adults, 2 small children). For the half recipe, used only 1/3 C. of panko, since that's all I had. Kept the full-recipe amount of parmesean. Lightly fried in a non-stick w/ little oil. Beautiful! It was so light and crispy. For sauce, used full -recipe and saved time with 28oz.canned chopped organic tomatoes. Assembled by stacking eggplant, 2 rounds high, for easier individual portioning. Husband loved it. Kids ate it! It looked beautiful.

Cutting this recipe in half still makes more than enough for six people. I cut it in half and use a 28oz can of diced tomatoes rather than dealing with blanching the plum tomatoes and it saves a good bit of time and mess. Easy to assemble and delicious. First time you make it it's a little tricky but once you get a system going it's a breeze.

Rating: 4
Delicious! I made a tomato sauce using San Marzano tomatoes, a small onion, a shallot and a clove of garlic and added some chopped kalamata olives and fresh basil to give this recipe an edge. I followed the recipe for the eggplant preparation and it came out great! The eggplant preparation takes some time but a nice glass of Chianti and some music make the whole experience enjoyable.

Rating: 4
Very tasty recipe! Wrong time of year for good fresh tomatoes, so I used canned whole plum tomatoes (2 large cans) instead. I would probably use crushed tomatoes in the future though as the sauce was a touch watery. However, it was a very simple, tasty sauce. I also used just a small amount of peanut oil to pan fry rather than deep fry the eggplant. The only drawback is that it's a very messy recipe to make.

Rating: 4
Great recipe...actually a bit more difficult than I first planned but definitely worth it. I didn't try to make my own tomato sauce and I just used my favorite "jarred" sauce. Made this easier and was very tasty. A "definitely make again".

Yum! Just served this to my inlaws and it was a huge hit! Thanks again, epicurious! I used 2 jars organic tomato basil sauce as a time saver, 1 1/4 lb fresh mozz, added extra parm to bread crumbs (didn't have panko on hand) mixture and used a giant pan to fry lots of eggplant slices at once. I only fit about 2.5 eggplants in my 11x13 dish. Took about 20 min prep and 30 baking. Secret time saver: recruit a sou chef to prep/bread eggplant while you fry them! Great task for a kid (or hubby).:)

Saved myself time by using jarred sauce. Came out delicious. Two pieces of advice: slice the eggplant thin so that it gets really soft when cooked, and try adding feta.

I completely messed up this recipe. Two layers instead of 3, wasn't even sure if the eggplant was ripe (straight from the garden), didn't have enough mozzarella and used jar sauce, and it was still amazingly delicious. A hard to ruin recipe is always welcome in my home. I think the key is the prep of the eggplant, great texture and taste. Now if only I can get my husband to try it!

I will never order eggplant parmesan in a restaurant again! This was SOOO good it has spoiled me. Since I didn't have the Panko I thought I did, I dessicated 8 slices of oat bread and cuisinarted them in place of the panko. All the veg and herbs were fresh from my garden. I'd give it 5 forks if I could!!

I made this and it was wonderful, however, the sauce was a little bland so the next time I made it I added some italian seasoning, more garlic and some sugar, it was much better.

I had never made eggplant parmesan but had two organic eggplants from our CSA box that were begging for the proper attention. This is such a great recipe and very forgiving. I was making dinner for just three so had to reduce the recipe and did that by eyeballing measurements - sometimes altogether changing them, for example I added more red pepper flakes, which I will do again! Didn't have time to make the sauce from scratch so I used canned. Also, I added zucchini and thought it gave the finished product a bit more depth. Husband and friend loved it! As far as Gourmet recipes go, this is a very easy recipe to put together. Definitely a keeper.

Rating: 4
WOW!! SOOO good! I was lucky enough to get some of my friend's beautiful home-grown tomatoes for the sauce and that may have been the key, but this was hands down the best marinara sauce I've ever tasted! and I made it myself! and it was easy! It really isn't that hard or time consuming so skip the jarred sauce. The rest of the prep was surprisingly easy as well since you can have a lot of things going simultaneously (salting the eggplant while making the sauce etc) I expected the final product to be heavy and greasy but it was light and delicious! I'll definitely be making this again. Did I mention I've never made Italian food from scratch in my life? (unless you count boiling spaghetti!)

My brand new daughter-in-law and I made this recipe today and give it highest ratings!! Made a couple of changes, however. I started out by roasting the tomatoes with salt, pepper, a little sprinkling of sugar, fresh thyme, and slivers of fresh garlic and lots of olive oil!! (350 for 3 hours). Processed all of this in cuisinart and used for tomato sauce. Used rest of recipe as is, and was fabulous!!

Rating: 4
Outstanding. I skipped the homemade sauce and used our favorite jarred sauce (DiSalvos-Sicilian, you should try it) which saved a lot of time. My husband is not a fan of no-meat meals but he helped himself to seconds and raved about it. I will surely be making this again.

Rating: 0
You can save a ton of time by just using canned, diced tomatoes for this. And if the eggplant is young and fresh, it won't need the salting/draining. What a waste of time. Also, I skip the breadcrumbs. For eggplant parm, I dip in egg, then flour, then fry. The crust is perfectly flaky and wonderful. This recipe it just too time-consuming.

Fantastic. I did use an organic marinara sauce; peeled but did not salt the eggplant, and it was fantastic. My family loved it and could not believe no MEAT. This is a keeper.

Wonderfully delicious!! I only used 2 eggplants and it fit the baking dish quite nicely (3 would have been too much). I used a jarred marinara sauce to save time but I will definitely make the sauce in the recipe (probably a day or 2 ahead) next time.

Rating: 3
It's good but it takes way too long. I tried canned tomato sauce and cooked up a sauce with red wine and garlic. Then I ignored the assembly line of flour and egg and breadcrumb which nearly killed me and attracted the household cats. I simply fried the egg plant then layered the dish with 4 beaten eggs (add milk) and use a brush to spread, breadcrumbs, sauce, cheese etc. Plus, don't salt the eggplant to prep because you end up having to wash the salt off anyway.

Rating: 3
I followed the recipe, and found the tomato sauce was not that great. I bought organic romas, but this is April so I suggest either canned to replace the sauce content, or peak season for more flavor. The recipe took me about 3 hours without cook time...so use prepared sauce for a quicker result. I did a short broil at the end of cook time to make a pretty, spotted top on the cheese.

Rating: 4
Insanely delicious and worth the time. The sauce is especially tasty, and leftovers are twice as good. The one change I make is to used 2-28 oz canned crushed tomatoes in basil, rather than whole tomatoes, to skip the step of pureeing. My husband asks me to make this for his birthday every year!

Rating: 3
Followed directions for the recipe and while it came out tasty, the final product was mushy and lost the crispness of the panko, seems like kind of a wasted effort for all that prep work and frying. Going to try individual plating and using the broiler to melt the cheese next time instead of letting the whole mixture bake together

Rating: 4
This was definitely worth the time in the kitchen! All eggplant parmesan is laborous, but the extra time to make your sauce in this recipe really makes the difference here. The simplicity of the flavors, especially the fresh basil, is perfect. I usually use breadcrumbs but the panko added a nice crunch. If anything, I was short on sauce, but I would absolutely make this again. Don't tell my mom, but this is better than hers!

This dish was ok. My girlfriend and I made this for our boyfriends one night b/c she is a vegetarian. My issues: 1) We spent a lot of time in the kitchen. 2) There was way too much eggplant 3. We only ended up using 2, but there was still too much. 4) I doubled the tomatoes, but there was not enough sauce. If I made this again, I'd make my own tomato sauce. Also, I think I'd use regular breadcrumbs instead of the Panko.

Loved this and I made some major substitutions for ease and cost (which should have negatively affected taste). I used canned diced tomatoes (still pureed in blender), dried basil, shredded mozarella and fried in good old vegetable oil. It did take a lot of time to fry and I only used 2 eggplants. Next time will use 2 frying pans.

Addendum: wasn't as time consuming as others say. We used a large skillet and cooked all the eggplant at one time. We did halve the recipe, however.

Uh, Deeeeelish!!! My girlfriend and I made this tonight and it was fantastic! Very easy recipe, just takes a little time. I Read the reviews and one said that you will be in the kitchen a long time. NOT TRUE! 45 minutes prep and 30 minutes in the oven. You even have time to clean the kitchen before you eat! It took longer finding PANKO than to make it.

Rating: 3
This is very good, but I have a few technique issues with the recipe. First of all I never sweat eggplant. There is just no need. Nicholas Clee, the British author of "Don't Sweat the Aubergine" (Short Books, 2005), argues that salting probably is unnecessary given the relatively mild bitterness of most of the eggplants available today. Also, salt extracts only as much bitterness as it does moisture: that is, not much. It also leaves the eggplant too salty. Also, I cut the slices much thicker. You want to taste the eggplant, don't you?

First time I've made (or even eaten) eggplant parmesan. Love it! I made it with yellow romas from the Farmer's Market. It was wonderful! I didn't think it was all that much work. I'm introducing this new taste to my non- vegetarian sons tonight.

I gotta say I don't have alot of faith in this recipe so far....I baked the eggplant in the oven after breading and I just tasted them and I'm disappointed....I didn't have panko...it matters but shouldn't that much....I usually just soak the eggplant in salt water and then egg and fry because as my italian girlfriend says....am I eating eggplant or breadcrumbs....maybe I'm spoiled.

Very satisfying cool weather dinner, served on it's own. Fresh eggplant, tomatoes and basil came from a local farmers market. I cut the eggplant a little thick 1/2 - 3/4-inch. Overall texture and consistency was excellent and what I was expecting. Like most reviewers this did take slightly longer than I anticipated, about 1 hour of prep time.

Rating: 4
Expect to be in your kitchen for a while with this one. I followed it closely, only exceptions are that I used cornmeal for the breading and made my own homemade sauce. If you're up to a long evening in the kitchen, its worth it. My husband (a foodie) loved it. We served over pasta, yummy!

delicious! great dish for vegetarian friends. I used diced tomatoes for the sauce and placed slices of tomato on top to add moisture.

Rating: 4
The eggplant's texture and amount of breading are perfect (note i used cornmeal instead of panko and rice flour instead of wheat flour, because i can't eat gluten). I used store-bought, good quality sauce (actually three kinds, two basic garlic and one with some spice). It still took me 2.5 hours, but i think i'm a bit of a slow cook (i clean as i go, for instance).

I also used three cans of san marzano tomatoes instead of fresh and put them through the food mill. The only other change I made was taking the basil leaves out of the sauce after I cooked it because sometimes they get slimy. This recipe was absolutely delicious and not as time-consuming as it looked. It is definitely a keeper.

Hands down, fantastic!! The time it took was outrageous, so I recommend using pre-made sauce if you don't want to spend all afternoon on this recipe. I followed the recipe though, and you can really taste the fresh tomatoes. I also used smaller-than-average eggplants, so there was a lot more breading/deep frying (boy was it amazing) So great! Will definitely do this again!

I would definitely recommend this recipe. I tried it because our neighbor gave us exactly 2 1/2 pounds of eggplant, so I guess it was meant to be. I didn't have the problem that some other reviewers had - it seemed like I had plenty of sauce. I was actually a bit worried because it seemed like there was quite a bit of liquid in the pan when I pulled it out of the oven. I let it rest for a few minutes, like lasagna, and it was fine. Next time, I may try to reduce the sauce a bit more. Anyway, this was a bit labor intensive, but my husband said it was the best eggplant he had ever had (and he claims to not really like eggplant), so it was worth it. I will definitely make it again, but maybe only once in a while. I think there are definitely healthier things to do with eggplant, though it was tasty! :)

Rating: 4
The olive oil imparts a wonderful flavor and is very key to this recipe. Have not tried oven frying the eggplant but I think pan frying will give better results with more flavor. I doubled the garlic in the sauce and used fresh plum tomatoes which are out of season and expensive right now, and the sauce had a wonderful, fresh taste.I'd like to try San Marzano canned to save time and money. In the end, I wish I had a little more sauce to work with so next time I'll double the sauce recipe and freeze what I don't use. Lots of flavor from very simple ingredients.

Rating: 4
Great recipe! Turned out beautifully. I thought it wouldn't make enough sauce, but once it was in the oven for a while, it got much more juicy. In the future, I think I might use cornmeal to coat the eggplant instead of the panko, but it was still a beautiful recipe.

Rating: 4
I made it with only one big eggplant, adjusted the flour, eggs and crumbs accordingly. I used regular Italian seasoned bread crumbs instead of panko. I also used Trader Joe's Bolognese sauce instead of making my own to save time. It still came out delicious! Great recipe and easy to adjust!

Rating: 4
Super tasty. I used canned tomatoes, and added about a half a cup of white wine to the sauce as it cooked down. I also used bread crumbs instead of panko. I hardly ever use panko crumbs and couldn't bring myself to spend $5 on them when I know the majority of them would go wasted in my freezer or pantry. Delish!

I got a "face" from the carnivore when I told him what was for dinner, but he absolutely loved it. My 5 yr old cleaned his plate! I baked the eggplant rather than frying it for a healthier option, and it was excellent. I used my own tomato sauce which saved a lot of time.

Made this a second time but made one change. I chopped a large shallot and sautéed it in olive oil until soft and just starting to brown, then added that to the sauce. That moved this recipe up from just ok to very good in my opinion.

We used this recipe at one of our cooking classes - It was a "Chef's Challenge" of the staff favourites. It actually proved to me that I really DO like eggplant, and all our customers loved it! My chef's advice regarding the tomatoes however - fresh isn't ALWAYS best. It turned out that the flavour of the tomatoes would have been rather weak since they weren't "in season" (they even looked really pale after cutting up) so he added some tomato paste for flavour. When I use this recipe again, I will use canned tomatoes as he suggests - they are more flavourful and consistent year round.

Rating: 3
My fiance loved it. I thought it was pretty decent. Made it mostly to recipe but used more garlic than called for. Making your own sauce is a pain, but making it from scratch gave it a bright tomato flavor that you just can't get from canned. According to my fiance, I will make this again.

A keeper for sure! Most reviewers are right, it could have a little more sauce, but the flavoring is excellent and the use of panko crumbs for breading is genius. Luxurious, worth every minute.

Very disappointing. Since I made some changes I'm not adding my rating, but this dish tasted like two forks. It was a mistake to bake 25 mins instead of fry. Panko is meant to be fried, so if you are going through the effort of breading, fry it. I eat healthfully and don't crave fried foods, but this should have been fried. The crisp-baked blobs were unsatisfying and weirdly too "fresh", even though I broiled them before breading as someone suggested. Another suggestion that didn't work: Letting the dish sit for 10-15 mins before serving. The fresh mozzarella had toughened and congealed by then. It should be served right out of the oven so the cheese is gooey. Finally, the sauce. I used tomatoes etc fresh from the farm, plus some canned organic tomatoes. The result lacked depth. Maybe roasting would help. Suggestion I wish I'd taken: Layer additional fresh basil when you assemble it. The basil got lost in the sauce. I would rename the dish I made "flab-covered undercooked egglplant with a lot of mozzarella and bland tomato sauce."

Rating: 4
Halving the recipe is much easier and still makes plenty of food (would easily serve 4). leave 3+ hrs to make it. once I had everything in the casserole dish, I poured off as much of the liquid as possible, leaving a thicker tomato sauce and potentially a less-mushy result after the baking. Next time I will try straining the tomato sauce before the layering process. Also, no need to preheat the oven so early--frying all the eggplant takes a long time. Important to have a lot of paper towels on hand for draining the eggplant slices after they have been fried. Adding more mozzerella wouldn't hurt, but it's also fine how it is. This turned out pretty incredible!

Rating: 0
Good recipe, did take 2 hours. I modified a little, by doing a half recipe I used 1.25# homegrown tomatoes (Romas) plus 8 oz of canned tomato sauce. Would have liked a little more sauce, but realize too much liquid just makes it soggy. This casserole was firm and the eggplant flavor stood out. I used Monterrey Jack cheese instead of mozzarrella. A half recipe makes 6 servings as a side dish. Used 8x12 pyrex dish.

I've made this twice already. I made a couple of substitutions. I used fire roasted canned tomato to save time and baked the coated eggplant pieces instead of frying to save on calories. I added extra tomato sauce to the recipe to make the dish a bit more saucey because it can turn out a little dry. Its great to freeze the left over for those times you need a quick bite but dont feel like cooking or have the time.

Delicious, even when made using the lazy and gluten-free method. Used store-bought tomato sauce, added some sauteed onions and garlic. Used rice flour and cornmeal for frying the eggplant. Layered with extra basil leaves. The cornmeal worked exceptionally well, and I highly recommend it whether you're gluten-tolerant or not.

I can't say that I made this actual recipe--many substitutions--but it served as an excellent guide. It was the best eggplant parmesan I've ever had. Used a good quality bottled tomato-basil sauce doctored with sauteed garlic & red pepper flakes plus some fresh basil. Used bakery breadcrumbs instead of panko (which always seems to have hydrogenated oil), used a nice regular mozzarella instead of fresh, and finally, used a butter-olive oil (mostly olive) mix for frying to give a nice toasty flavor. It wasn't outrageously time consuming. So good!

The last time I ate melanzane alla parmigiana was when my friend from Salerno prepared it. My friend is a great cook and the secret, quite simply, is her heavy-handed olive oil application. Enjoy this as the indulgent dish that it is. Go ahead and fry the eggplant. I didn't find it as labor intensive as some people made it out to be. Make the sauce with diced canned tomatoes. Have eggplant frying as you are battering up the next batch to be fried. I managed to prepare everything and have dinner on the table in an hour and a half.

Tons of work but well worth it. I made the eggplant and used the exact same recipe on chicken, as well. Both were excellent. The sauce recipe did not yield as much as I would have liked, so I'll probably double it next time.

I changed this a bit and made it the best eggplant parm I've ever had. First, I marinated the eggplant slices in a cilantro, fresh ground peppper and light oil mixture before baking them. Meanwhile I made sauce from scratch adding slow roasted tomatoes and red peppers with fresh basil. I also added beef stalk and pancetta bits into the sauce with a dash of red wine and creme. After the eggplant came out of the oven I followed the recipe exactly. The cilantro leaves under the layer of breadcrumbs add a lot of personality to the dish. I used fresh buffalo mozzarella. Garnished with fresh basil and red pepper flakes. A really fabulous pinot to pair. This dish is dangerously delicious, I have to resist making it too often because it's so time consuming and food-coma-inducing.

Baking the eggplant cuts back on fat and time - you could even do it a day ahead. Using panko mixed with parm helps. I'm a huge fan of tomato sauce from scratch but using a jar of crushed tomatoes plus a basic marinara sauce and then adding your own spices will definitely suffice. This is a great recipe! Have it on a baguette the next day for a delicious parm grinder! Boyfriend approved!

Great recipe, but want to make it shorter and healthier? First, don't salt the eggplant slices, just bread them. Second, bake the breaded eggplant slices on cookie sheets for 25 minutes at 375 degrees. Third, doctor up jarred spaghetti sauce. I added diced whole tomatoes and red wine to the jarred sauce. This took a 2 1/2 hour prep down to 1 1/4 hours. Yes, I know this changes the recipe, but quicker is important for a working mom.

This was really good. There's no Panko where I live but it worked fine with regular bread crumbs. It was sort of time consuming but delicious and I'm not even a big eggplant fan. Next time I'd like to try the non-frying method but I wasn't sure how it would come out so I stuck to the recipe. The sauce was the real surprise for me. Normally I spend a LOT of time making homemade sauce and I thought because this one was so simple it wouldn't compare but it was great. I made it according to the recipe but I used the canned tomatoes as suggested to make it even easier. I've made it since as is or jazzing it up with veggies, meat and spices for other recipes or just to have sauce on hand.

Loved this recipe, definitly go for the panko. We really liked how the red pepper flakes add a little something to the finished product. I used unsalted fresh mozz so it wouldnt be salty with all the parmigian- reggiano cheese layered in. Will definily make again.

This was extraordinarily good. I used top notch ingredients, and it was worth it. I would double the tomato sauce next time and freeze some of it. I added too many hot pepper flakes, and had to add a jar of sauce, to lessen the heat, but my guests raved anyway. A keeper, this one.

A hearty, soul-warming kind of dinner, delicious and fortunately alterable with success. We short-cut this labor-intensive recipe (esp. for something that ultimately isn't a very attractive-looking dish) by using Trader Joe's organic marinara sauce (great as is - we didn't add a thing to it!). I'll try to shave off even more time (and oil consumption) by baking the eggplant next time around as other reviewers suggested.

Rating: 4
Delicious!! I think the key to this recipe is cutting down the time - halving the recipe helps a lot as there's a lot less eggplant to batter and fry, and using canned whole peeled tomatoes instead of blanching and peeling yourself tastes just as good and makes it all go a LOT faster. Other than that, I made this recipe exactly as instructed and it was fantastic - definitely a keeper. Go for the panko for sure.

We had an eggplant and abundant tomatoes from our farm co-op that I didn't want to let waste, so I made this despite that I'd never before eaten an eggplant recipe that I liked. Husband declared this the "best sauce EVER", and rated the overall meal an A+. To my surprise, I agreed with him. Made the recipe as written, except used a variety of types of tomatoes. Outstanding!

I used a fresh, small (less than 6" in diameter) eggplant from the farmer's market and halved the recipe for my small family. I cheated by using a prepared sauce, but the results were wonderful and preparation time was cut in half!

Huh, Seattle. DEFINITELY must have been a tomato issue with your sauce. I used canned-San Marzano- and it was fine. In fact, that is my staple quick marinara recipe. As fresh as you can get is DEFINITELY the key though. Anyway. This was good. Time consuming, but good. Can't say I ended up with mush either. Eggplant stayed crispy even with the sauce and cheese. Don't go nuts with either, and I think the results will be much better.

I thought this was not good at all and I DO NOT recommend making the sauce from scratch! It was bland and sour, perhaps my tomatoes just weren't ripe enough but it definitely wasn't worth it. The recipe might be good with better tomato sauce but I will not spend 3 hours making this again.

When our vegetarian Daughter comes home for a visit, this is what she wants. Take the time do make it just as written and you won't have mush. Buy the fresh mozzarella. Use fresh basil. Don't over do the tomato sauce. and definitely use panko bread crumbs. Yes it is time consuming, but sit your guest down on the other side of the island (counter) open a bottle of wine and catch up while you make a great dish. And after all the hard work, just make a simple dressing and serve with an easy salad and crusty bread.

No eggplant available so I substituted flattened skinless chicken breasts. Followed recipe exactly except battered breasts in one whipped egg and coated with unseasoned breadcrumbs. Lightly browned in 1 T. olive oil. Quick, easy and very light.

Amazing. I peeled the eggplant though and it was really good. No issues with it staying together at all.

Let me start by saying I love to cook and enjoy my time in the kitchen. That said, for the labor required for this dish, the results were distinctly mediocre. There isn't a thing wrong with the recipe, it's just a LOT of work for a meal that everyone said "Yeah, it's pretty good". Not one of four diners said "Wow, this is GREAT". I have about a dozen recipes that take 1/10 the time and get much better reactions from myself and my guests. Frying the eggplant took FOREVER and frankly, I agree with other reviewers that you go through all that effort and by the time you layer it all with sauce and bake it, you end up with mush anyhow. I will say I nearly ate all the eggplant right out of the frying pan though. That part was delicious. Think I'd be more likely to do that part and serve it up as an appetizer with an asian plum sauce than go through the whole process. Overall a decent recipe, but there are many better ones that take far less effort.

This was just about the best thing that I've ever personally made. The prep took a while, but it was all very easy, and it turned out to be delicious even without the best ingredients. I will definitely make this again.

This was a good recipe. I breaded and baked the eggplant slices, 375 for 10 min. flipped over for another 5. Seemed quicker than frying. Used canned diced tomato, shredded mozz and regular bread crumbs, since that was what was on hand. Sprinkled parm and romano between layers.

I can't rate this recipe because I made too many changes. That said, it was fantastic. I didn't have panko crumbs, so I used a mix of polenta and matzoh meal, it came out nice and crispy. I also used a jarred sauce with 4 cheeses. After baking in the oven, the coating was still crispy and delicious. I liked it so much, I might take the time to make the whole thing from scratch.

can't believe I'm giving it 4 forks after all the hassle, but it was worth it! somehow wound up with 3 LARGE eggplants, so breading took forever. baked in batches at 375 for 20 min and it was perfect. had to use 3 28 oz cans plum tomatoes for sauce, also terrific. husband hates panko (after 2 yrs in japan go figure) but reg. breadcrumbs were fine. will definitely make again and again.

Loved the tomato sauce - if you need a good tomato sauce recipe, look no further. And using canned tomatoes was fine. I agree with the other reviewers - broil the eggplant. It's not as greasy and it's quicker! Yum!

Rating: 4
EXCellent recipe. Made all from scratch. Fresh tomatoes in blender required a can of paste to thicken a bit. Try to use fresh mozz as the packaged was not as good. eggplant stays very hot (like cooked tomatoes) so let rest 15 min or u will burn roof of mouth.

I have made this recipe several times, to rave reviews. I must say, however, that the eggplant is at its prime in terms of taste and - in particular - texture before layering, as this step makes it soggy (still delicious, though!)Every time i make it, my boyfriend likes to eat what he calls "eggplant chips". Next time, i'll bake or fry, then add cheese to the individual slices, put in oven for a few minutes (just enough time to melt the cheese) and either pour the sauce over the slices or serve on the side. Also would make a great party appetizer!

Amazing. Truly delicious. I had both left over eggs and panko mixture, but ran out of the flour mixture. I layered some shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano in between the slices of eggplant, and I used fresh basil from the farmer's market. I also doubled the garlic amount, because I wanted to make sure I could taste it. I put in a LOT more dried hot red pepper flakes - mainly on accident - but they added a nice kick to the dish. Canned tomatoes here, 59 cents from a neighborhood grocery store, tasted DELICIOUS. I can only imagine what this dish tastes like when it's cooked with plum tomatoes, as prescribed.

Yes, as previous reviewers said, this is yummy and time-consuming. But my husband picked this out and helped with the prep, and it was much more fun - and took a bit more than an hour. He did the tomatoes while I did the garlic and other prep for the tomato sauce. We did the egplant a bit thicker - 1/2 inch+ and did the coating. Bake/broil at 375 and it took 10 -14 minutes. The it was only 2 layers, but the sauce, eggplant and cheese all came out even. I also did the extra parmesan in the middle layer.

Even my meat loving friends finished off this dish and I had leftover sausage lasagna with meat sauce. I followed a few hints from other users however. I used canned whole tomatoes which still tastes awesome and frees up more time to focus on the main ingredient, the eggplant, which requires time to correctly prep. I sprinkled eggplant(not sliced too thickly) with salt and broiled till brown, wiped excess salt off, then proceeded with breading. The real secret to this recipe is the sauce. It's perfect, even with canned tomatoes. I make extra and freeze it for friends or for a spur of the moment pasta idea.

I made this recipe last night for my friends . I also baked the eggplant rather than frying it . They thought this was the best eggpIant parmesan dish they ever tasted! In addition, i added parmesan between the layers along with the mozzarella cheese. it was absolutely fabulous and will make this over and over again! Scrumptious and healthy!

This is a fabulous recipe!! I have made it as written, & made it with canned whole tomatoes. Didn't really notice a difference. I would only use fresh tomatoes again, if they are in season.

Several years ago I canned some plum tomatoes with garlic and basil from my garden. Never used them up, and am glad now! HOw easy to open the jar and puree! So, having saved time with that, I did as another reviewer and broiled the eggplant. Having 2 ovens is great-did all slices in one fell swoop. Couldnt have been easier and was rich and yummy and filling. Even eggplant-timid-hubby admitted it was good. Will use more sauce next time, cause it was a tiny bit dry for my taste. This made so much that I have enuf in freezer for 2 more dinners.

Outstanding. Thank you A Cook from Delaware on your suggestion to broil the eggplant. I then topped with plenty of panko and parm. Also used fresh oregano in the sauce. Wow!

Delicious and satifying dinner. To cut fat content, I did not fry the eggplant. I coated it according to the recipe, but baked it at 375 for 20 minutes on foil lined cookie sheets sprayed with a little olive oil. I only needed 2 eggs. I also misted olive oil on top of the crumb mixture before baking, for crunch. The coating does add flavor and substance that comes through after the dish is baked. The whole family loved it. I told the kids it was lasagna and they scarfed it up. Will definitely make again.

A good trick to shredding mozzarella is to put the block in the freezer for about 20-30 minutes first. That will harden the cheese so it won't fall apart when shredding.

This was AWESOME. Time intensive, but not difficult. I doubled the recipe (so I would have one to freeze), which made it take all afternoon. The end result -- well worth it. My dad didn't know he liked eggplant, nor did my kids and they devoured it. I used canned tomatoes (still delish) but other then that followed the recipe exactly. Wouldn't change a thing.

Unbelieveable! This recipe is forever going into my own recipe box collection. And with the leftovers, the next day we taosted up some French bread and made Eggplant Parmesan subs. Absolutley delicious!!!!

Other than making pierogis, I don't think anything is more labor intensive than eggplant parm. Even with shortcuts, this recipe takes a long time. I agree with the reviewers who used two or three 28oz. cans of plum tomatoes as a shortcut. I also agree with broiling the eggplant to save TONS of fat and calories. I suggest buying high quality shredded mozzarella because the block form is really hard to work with. Even with all these shortcuts, it will take a good chunk of your day to make this. However, eggplant parm is one of the world's great recipes, so it's worth it.

This is one of my favorite epicurious recipes. I work at a Japanese food wholesaler so I have easy access to panko. I forgot to bring some home last night, and moreover forgot to buy breadcrumbs at the supermarket. Panic! A quick substitution proved to work despite the odds: crushed Special K cereal. Still yummy! (But next time I'll probably go back to panko just to be traditional.)

I made this for my New Years Party and everyone enjoyed it. It was a bit time consuming to make, not to mention the clean up! My husband devoured the leftovers the next day. I made it with a completely different sauce - made with sundried tomatoes. Really added a great flavor to the dish. I also layered the the eggplant with a little ricotta cheese and steamed baby spinach.

UNBELIEVABLE! Even people who think they don't like eggplant love this recipe. I have made it numerous times and have finally had to double the recipe to have any left for freezing, (which it does, beautifully). Yes, time consuming and labor intensive, but so very worth it. I have used canned tomatoes when fresh are not in season, doesn't seem to diminish the taste at all. The sauce is so great that I now make extra to freeze as a base for spaghetti sauce. I do not salt the tomatoes first, nor have I puree'd in the blender, cuts the time quite a bit. Panko is a favorite in our house, available at most grocery stores now. I promise, once you try this, it will become a lifetime favorite.

Delicious!!!! But 1 hour active time is a lie- it took me 3 hours. Maybe I'm just slow. Regardless, it's worth it.

The final product was a thing of beauty. I definitely reccommend making the sauce a day ahead (which I did), or you will be exhaused by the time you're ready to eat. I had never used panko for breading/frying before, and I was amazed by how much better it worked than using my own homemade breadcrumbs. I am sold on that product. Allow plenty of time to make this dish, (as well as for cleanup) but definitely make it-it's worth it!

Once again Epicurious comes through. My daughter loves eggplant and I wanted to make something special before she went away to college for the first time. Needless to say she loved it. It's a bit of work (especially since the tomatoes from the garden were so plentiful and good. In the winter I'm sure as other reviewers have suggested some good canned will be great, but I won't skimp on the fresh basil. Leaner options sound good, but the panko coated and fried eggplant was to die for even before the dish was completed (I think my daughter would have eaten them alone and would have been extremely happy. I didn't have any fresh mozzerella on hand so had to substitute shredded mozzarella/ provolone blend from Sam's, can't imagine how it could be better, but will likely try for next year's going away feast (will likely have to repeat sooner!!!) Leftovers were great too (she inhaled them the next morning for breakfast)

This was excellent. It impressed my vegetarian & meat eater friends alike. The only change I made was to bake the eggplant, drizzeled in oil, instead of frying (much less labor intensive, and healthier). The sauce was also excellant, I added extra red pepper for a little zip, awesome!

Truth be told, I adjusted too many things in this recipe to properly "review" it, but the recipe is a great base to play with. I used a different sauce recipe (I like to add roasted red peppers to mine) but used the proportions for the bread crumbs and parmesan from this recipe. I found that 5 eggs was too much. For future use, I would start off with 3 eggs and add another if needed. I ended up pouring a lot of extra egg down the sink. I also recommend adding dried basil and oregano to the breadcrumb/cheese mixture. Yummy.

This was a big hit for Christmas dinner (vegetarian was a must!). I made extra sauce since it seemed sparse the first time I made this recipe. Steamed green beans made a colorful side dish. I also froze extra fried eggplant and gave them to friends who said they made a great meal later on.

I made it last night. I was very happy with my frying work...and then I put it in a baking dish, covered it with tomato sauce, baked it, and it all got mushy! Next time I'm going to fry the eggplant, then lay out the breaded, fried pieces on parchment on sheet trays, put moz and parm on each little fried piece, put the sheet trays in the oven, bake them until done, and serve the breaded/fried/cheesed pieces at the table, with sauce on the side. This will be quicker, and I think it will have much nicer texture...

Rating: 3
It is salty. I would cut the salt down -- the sweetness of the sauce (which doesn't have any salt in it) helps. But I baked the eggplant at 350 for about 15 minutes, followed the recipe exactly, but put the breaded eggplant on the baking sheet and baked it for 15 minutes or so. I did it for health reasons, but I think that it keeps the whole dish a lot lighter, a whole lot less oily in texture, and also, I think that you get more of the taste of the herbs, tomatoes, and eggplant.

I only made the eggplant. Then used it like lasagne noodles and made a Eggplant Lasagne. Before that though, I couldn't help but eat about 4 of the eggplant slices after cooking them. WOW! This is fantastic! You could even cover the eggplant with a little spaghetti sauce and grated mozzarella. Then serve up a salad with Italian olives and add a Merlot or Shiraz wine. Fabulous!

Eggplant parmesan is probably my favorite dish, and this is my favorite recipe. I think it is the sauce that really does it for me - it just tastes so much lighter and fresher than a lot of sauces. I also like the texture and taste of the fried eggplant and don't mind the additional work, although the next time I prepare it I plan on trying the broiler method and seeing how it turns out.

I like the panko crust, but next time I might try the broiling method that other reviewers have suggested. I used fresh tomatoes for the sauce, and I thought it was way better than sauce I've made with canned. Takes longer, but worth it. The fresh mozzarella and fresh basil were fantastic.

Very delicious and a perfectly traditional dish - we loved it! Next time, I'll take the advice from the cook from Delaware who said: 'Slice the eggplant thickly, drizzle both sides with olive oil, sprinkle with salt and broil both sides until lightly browned.' While the pan fried option is tasty...it really isn't needed for the flavors and it is time consuming. I used canned tomatoes as well - tasted great!

Was looking for a recipe that would come close to the incredible eggplant parmesan I recently discovered at an upscale deli here in Portland. Wow! This is even better! Would agree with others in (a) backing off on the salt and (b) broiling the eggplant. Fresh basil is worth the extra effort. Next time (and there WILL be a next time) I'll make sure and use fresh mozzarella as called for (I used processed). Also made my own panko. Even if you THINK you aren't a big eggplant fan, you GOTTA try this!!

It was very good - made it for my husband's birthday. Being of Italian heritage on my mother's side, I still prefer the classic, thus three, not four forks. Could be the missing fresh basil was also the culprit. It's so hard to find this time of year in Northern Minnesota.

I agree with the others. This was quite delicious but it is somewhat time consuming. Lots of pots and pans but worth it. I also substituted two 28 oz. cans of Italian whole plum tomatoes for the fresh ones. This time of year, fresh tomatoes are usually not as sweet so this worked out well. I lowered the salt as suggested by another cook.

Perfect recipe! This was a delicious classic eggplant parm recipe. I've already made it 3 times in the past month. I lightly browned the eggplant on broil for a few minutes at the beginning as advised. This cut down on the acidity of the eggplant. Oh, and the next day it tastes even better than the first day.

Fabulous recipe! Especially the Sauce! Instead of purchasing 5lbs fresh plum tomatoes, I used two 28oz cans of tomatoes (Pastene & Hunts). This allowed me to skip the laborious process of blanching, cooling and peeling the tomatoes! Curious why the recipe says to chop the tomatoes if you are going to coarsely puree them anyway? I did not bother chopping the tomatoes. The sauce was a fabulous consistency, and the red pepper flakes gave it a nice zing. I recommend trying the sauce over pasta! My fresh mozarello cheese was spoiled so I substitued "Mexica" Queso Quesadilla semi soft melting cheese. Great Taste. I liked the panko crumbs mixed with the parmesan because it browned up the eggplant slices nicely. Delicous recipe and I would recommend this to my friends. Does anyone have a fabulous ox tail recipe?

This s a great recipe for a classic version of Eggplant Parmesan. I substituted 4 large cans of whole plum tomatoes (drained) for the fresh ones and it turned out great. If you do this, omit the salt in the sauce. I also substituted whole-milk mozzarella for the fresh mozzarella because I couldn't find it fresh. Even without having to peel and seed the tomatoes, this recipe is a lot of work, but worth it!!

I'm Italian-American and have been making eggplant parm forever. I'd like to offer an easier preparation that actually allows the flavor of the eggplant to come through even more. Slice thickly, drizzle both sides with olive oil, sprinkle with salt and broil both sides until lightly browned. It's necessary to cut thick slices because they'll diminish greatly under the broiler. I also find that the bitter juices leech out. You can proceed with whatever recipe you prefer. I like to serve it with cappellini tossed with some of the sauce. Believe me, you won't miss the eggs, flour and breadcrumbs and you surely won't miss all the work!

This was my first time making eggplant parmesan and I loved it - comfort food at it's best! Tip - to cut down on preparation time I used 2 tins of plum tomatoes and whizzed those in the processer (note I cut the recipe in 1/2 so if you are making it for 8, use 4 tins). The tin tomatoes are just the same - according to the chefs on tv! It is a bit of work frying off the eggplant but I thought it was worth it! YUM

Sauce was awesome, actually is our new red sauce staple in our house. I would also disagree about the previous post and using 5 eggs. Although I too at first thought this was way to many, I actually ended up using all five eggs to my 2 1/2 lbs of eggplant.

I found this to be an excellent eggplant pamesan recipe and my dinner guests loved it. It is somewhat labor inetnsive but well worth the effort. (Just a cooking tip - the mistake a lot of cooks make when preparing eggplant for frying is making the slices too thick. Too thick when fried will yield mushy eggplant parm!)

This was my first attempt at eggplant parmesan, so maybe my lack of skill contributed to my poor results. The flavor was ok but all of the breading and frying is not worth the effort. Once the eggplant bakes with the sauce and cheese the crispy panko gets mushy.
