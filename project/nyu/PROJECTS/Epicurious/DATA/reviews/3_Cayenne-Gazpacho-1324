This is my first attempt at making gazpacho and I only used the recipe as a base. There is something about it that doesn't taste like most I've had in restaurants, but it's tasty anyway. I varied the amounts of ingredients and added the peel and juice of one lemon, a clove of garlic and substituted two chopped cayenne peppers for the powder. 3 celery stalks is too many for my taste.

I prefer Mom's Gazpacho (on this website) to this version of gazpacho, which is a little bland and a little too "grassy" for our tastes. Maybe cutting down on the celery and green onions would help, also adding more cayenne and a splash of Tabasco?.

Lots of vegies in this gazpacho but it was a little bland - we like spicy. There are better gazpacho recipes out there but if I made it again I would use spicy V8 AND chop the vegies a little more than 'coarsely chopped'. The carrot seemed like an odd ingredient.

this was easy to prepare and tasted great even my husband (not a veggie lover)approved the spicy taste!

So simple! Didn't have to chop much. The soup was even better after a day. Only negative is that at first it looked rather greeny-brown, but after adding more tomato juice and letting it chill for a couple of hours it looked perfect. Also, very nutritious.
