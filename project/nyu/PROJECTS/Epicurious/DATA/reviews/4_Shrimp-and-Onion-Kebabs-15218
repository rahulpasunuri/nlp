Easy to prepare and very tasty with the suggested herb and garlic marinade. The onions were a good accompaniment for the shrimp and I would recommend including them. The only note that no one has mentioned before is that the marinade, probably because of the olive oil will flame up easily (at least it did on our charcoal grill).

AMAZINGGGGG!!! Wow this was the best grilled shrimp I have ever had. I also grilled porter house steak for the dinner party tonight. I marinaded them in the herb garlic marinade too. I was told they were like "budda". I am pretty sure that means amazing. I am in the process of making another batch of the marinade to bring on vacation so I am prepared to marinade something / anything for the grill. A++++ for this marinade and recipe

Made this using the Herb-Garlic Marinade, did not have enough lemon so I substituted lime juice. Was absolutely fabulous - highly recommend

Made this last year for Father's Day and my dad is still talking about it a year later. Will probably make it again this year as it is perfect for on the boat... just grill, eat, and wash off in the lake. It's so simple and wows even the "gourmets" in the family. I did not make the onions, but nobody missed them! Served with a variety of chilled salads (including the orzo and feta salad from this site- another HUGE hit) that I could pull right out of the cooler. Fabulous and easy... what more can you ask for?

Really good. I did all the prep at home and took it camping. Quite successful. I was pressed for time and left most of the thyme leaves on the stick and threw it in the marinade. No problem. Highly recommend.

Very enjoyable. Loved the marinade. Added lemon zest to the marinade as well as the juice for that extra zing. Since I was cooking for two, shrimp was cooked with shells, then peeled. Even normally quite husband commented that this was good.

I didn't have pearl onions so I used a vidalia cut in big chunks. Marinade is fabulous, I would use it on any meat you choose. Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent...cook the shrimp in the shells so they do not dry out!

Wonderful recipe and fairly simple! Made it for a first meal with a boyfriend (who is now my husband). He still talks about these shrimp!

This was fabulous!! I just made this for my family and they loved it. I was surprised how flavorful the shrimp was. We cooked them with the shells on, and they were moist and delicious. I would definitely make them again!

I too have made this recipe a bunch of times and it is always wonderful. My family and friends always ask for the recipe. Keep in mind that it is a messy dish; however, the taste outweighs the mess. I highly recommend it.

It's a travesty that no-one else has reviewed this one. I've made it a handful of times and it never ceases to get RAVE reviews. I serve it without the onions (much less labor) as the perfect summer appetizer. Get nice big shrimp with the shells on - or if your guests don't want to get messy it works well without too.
