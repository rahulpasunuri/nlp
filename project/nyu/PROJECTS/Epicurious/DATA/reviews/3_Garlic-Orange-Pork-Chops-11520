Quick and easy, and helps keep the pork tender. I also liked the flavor. Adding this to my list of "go-to" recipes!

I read the reviews after starting the recipe, and so made some changes. After browning the pork chops, I removed them from the pan, added the garlic and let it soften and infuse the remaining fats. Then I added the wine and deglazed the pan, scraping up the brown bits. Then I added the pork chops, orange juice, and lemon juice. Once the pork was cooked, I removed the chops, and began reducing the sauce, adding around one fourth of a cup of apricot pureé. I reduced the remaining sauce by half, and poured in over the chops. We both thought that it was good.

I'm not a huge fan of pork, so I was hoping for a spectactular sauce. Didn't find it with this one. The sauce was very bland even with the addition of extra garlic and fresh ginger.

I always brine pork chops before cooking. This insures tenderness. Added the brown sugar and ginger and everyone loved it. Spectacular, no, but easy and very kid friendly for a working mom. I will definately make again! I served it over fresh baby spinach which wilted slightly from the sauce.

I followed the instructions exactly and my girlfried and I found this meal to be incredibly boring. This one goes in the trash...

We didn't have lemon, so we added to the sauce some marmelade, chopped apricots, and a dash of rice vinegar. Mmmm.

This was very delicious. I added some ginger and some Worcestershire sauce and more garlic. I would definitely make this again. Pork chops were very moist and tender.

Pork chops were moist, and flavorful.

An easy weeknight recipe. It lacked a kick so next time I will add some ginger and sugar as others suggested.

What a Ho-Hum recipe! Granted, it was quick but no imagination. I added a little cornstarch mixed with water to the sauce at the end, but it just didn't have much pizazz. Am sure there are better recipes out there.

Not much flavor, even with the citrus. I was surprised. Skip this one...

I was a little disappointed with this recipe (found the sauce boring/very little flavor). I will try it again and boil the sauce to reduce and thicken it. Maybe I'll try doctoring it as suggested in previous reviews. If it is not tastier the second time, I will be removing it from my recipe box.

I agreed with another review that it was too tart. So I added 1teaspn ginger & 2 Tablespoons brown sugar. This made it really good. My very picky son & husband said I should make it again. I used 2pans & doubled the recipe.The nonstick pan did not brown & thicken as quickly as the stainless steel pan. I also mixed a tablespn of cornstarch into some extra O.J. to thicken.

In order to kick it up a notch, add a jigger of Grand Marnier along with the OJ.

Excellent. I love recipes with 5 or less ingredients. I did use freshly squeezed o.j.

Made with quality ingredients this recipe deserves four forks; mediocre ingredients (i.e. canned orange juice) earn it two, and anything less than that is the fault of the cook.

I used 3 garlic cloves and also added some brown sugar to this, removed the pork chops for a few and kept them warm and let the sauce reduce until it became a glaze consistency. It was excellent the sweetness/citris flavors really complemented the pork. Will definetely make again.

So easy and a great alternative to marinading...no time for that on the weeknights! I would go more conservatively with the browning time - they were a little dried out. But the flavor was excellent!

I added a little low salt chicken broth and two extra garlic cloves. It worked for chicken breasts too.

These are very easy to make, which is a plus, but flavor wise they are just so-so.

I jazzed this up a little, and then it was a great fast supper. After browning the chops, I removed them and carmelized half a diced onion with the garlic in the same pan. I added some chile sauce and some brown sugar, as well as fresh orange and lemon rind, to the onions. Then I returned the chops to the pan and poured in the juices and wine--I ended up having to add more wine as it was evaporating too fast, and then at the end I finished off (and thickened up) the sauce with a little bit of apricot preserves. Good, but not a make-again.

very tasty, but i used more garlic than called for. will become a quick-meal staple.

This was a piece of cake to make--very quick and easy! I simmered the sauce (with chops in pan) for 10 minutes uncovered and it thickened beautifully; therefore, no need to remove them (and have them get cold) or add starch/flour.

An absolutely delicious recipe! Agree with other cooks that more garlic is needed - I used 3 cloves in all. I find the sauce a little sour so I added a teaspoon of honey. One of the best pork chop recipes and VERY easy to make. An ideal week-nite dish. Would definitely make it again.

This is a simple and tasty dish. I took the advice of a couple of other reviewers in that I added a Tsp. of ground Ginger as well as a couple of Tsp. of brown sugar. The best, and critical as far as I'm concerned, suggestion was to use a little cornstarch mixed with orange juice ( or water ) to thicken the sauce as a last step.

Correction - rating 4 is correct, not one.

This was just okay. My family would prefer the pork chops grilled where they would get browner.

A great recipe. Surprisingly elegant for how simple it is to make, and the flavors blend well (although it is sweet). I plan to try to get my fiancee to try pork with this recipe.

Recommend doubling the garlic, also removing the chops at the end and thickening the sauce with a couple of teaspoons of cornstarch mixed with a couple of tablespoons of orange juice.

This is easy, fast and extra yummy! Make SURE you make the sauce, it is the best! 2 thumbs up!

These were very easy and flavorful pork chops. They also made the kitchen smell great! Although I am not a huge fan of pork chops, I would definitely make these again. I followed another reviewer's suggestion for the sauce (butter and thyme and then boil)...a great idea!

This is a great recipe; easy enough to fix during the week and yet special enough for company. I served it with the recipe for mashed potatoes with prosciutto and parmesan cheese (also found through Epicurious.com)...a great combination with a green vegetable.

This was really a hit and super easy. I reduced the sauce and served with pesto mashed potatoes. YUMMY!

The suggestion to make a sauce after removing the chops that several people have made is good. I added about a teaspoon of dried thyme and a tablespoon of butter and it turned out deliciously! I sopped up the remaining sauce with french bread. An Alsacian "Tokay" pinot gris complemented this dish perfectly.

Oh, yes, a great new pork recipe. Fast, easy and yummy. Made with 1" thick chops - the additional cooking time required for the thickness (about 14 min. total, after browning) made the sauce a perfect consistency when the chops were done.

I have fussy eaters in my household but they raved about this dish. Although I did add a bit more wine and an extra clove of garlic (just because I like both), the fresh juices really made a terrific sauce. Will definately make again.

I loved this recipe it was quick to make and tasted wonderful. I am fixing it again as I typed this! I sent it to all of my friends after I tried it the first time. It was very good made with just water or the white wine (I have tried both). I served it with mashed potatoes and asparation ( a new veggie that is a cross between broccoli and asparagus). It is added to my list of quick delicous recipes, perfect for guest when you want to fix something that taste like you spent hours cooking.

Try stirring in 1 tsp powdered ginger root and 2 tsp dark brown sugar after removing chops. Reduce to a thick glaze and spoon over chops.
