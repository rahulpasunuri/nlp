I have been looking for a good meatloaf for 10 yrs,had great hopes for this one, but alas it was not to be. Made it almost to the recipie, but used the egg,it was still to dry. I was even dissapointed with Paul Prudhomes.

It's a great surprise to find a eggless, delicious meatloaf. My daughter is allergic to eggs and every time I run into a quality recipe I send it to her. Quick to make, moist, and well worth waiting for!

I've been making this meatloaf for years now, always doubling the recipe. And I still never have leftovers. I allow the fresh breadcrumbs to sit in the V8, and I use Chili Sauce (found near the ketsup at the grocery store). I don't measure the onions, so I can't tell you if it's too much. I use 2 medium to large onions when I double the recipe.

Everyone enjoyed this meat loaf. However, the recipe does not feed eight adults. For eight, I doubled the recipe and had only a small amount left over.

Serve this with your own mashed potato dish and you will be the hit of the dinner table, also the best sandwich you ever ate!!

Prepared as instructed, diced onion, subbed dry parsley for fresh, used crusts from whole wheat bread instead of white. Delicious, moist and tasty. Most of all, 5 yr old child is eating it too!

Very moist, the red onions give a great sweetness, used only beef and will definitely keep this recipe. Was so moist though that if there had been leftovers (it was so good there was none left) it would have fallen apart for those who love the cold meat loaf sandwich the next day.

We love loves of meat! One of the most used cook books in our house is 52 Meat Loaves. We have tried at least 40 of them and also love to develop our own improvisational loaves as well. For how simple this is, it is a rather tasty, moist loaf. I followed the recipe very closely (for once) and found it quite satisfying. Ketchup to taste....

Always try a new recipe when I make meatloaf because I never found one I loved- until now. My husband & I thought this was deicious! Very flavorful and juicy!

My husband and I both agree - best meatloaf we've eaten! Per other reviewers, didn't use the V-8, and added an egg. Also, had only ground beef.

Rating: 4
If you love garlic and onions you will LOVE this recipe!! It's now the only meat loaf recipe we make. So flavorful, not your mama's meatloaf--BETTER! My husband is a hunter so we used ground venison--healthier choice--instead. We have also substituted other things for the V-8 juice and it's still always great.

My local Publix sells a meatloaf mixture that lacks veal-it is half ground pork and half ground beef. I added an egg without eliminating the juice, which may account for the fluffy-soggy texture. I skipped the ketchup on top but this unstable loaf was still too sweet. My husband agreed that it was the worst meatloaf of many we've tried over the last 40 years.

"Best" Meat Loaf EVER! A little changes made mine greaterthan listed! 1 large Red Onion, not 1#'s...Beef, Turkey, and ground Pork. Egg, bread crumbs, not V-8 juice, Basil and Oregno too. And a little more Catsup on top! Sent to my son, the Gourmet cook, and he can't wait to make it too! Flavors all linger and gives a very full feeling a long time too! Try the Silky-Mashed Potatoes in this site and you have a DINNER for a great crowd to!

Not usually a meatloaf fan, but was when I was pregnant, and this hit the spot. Not into meatloaf at the moment, but if I'm ever expecting again, I'll make this.

that is one boatload of onions for a meatloaf ! I love it but might be a tad much for anyone with a spouse that wants to smooch after dinner ! Whats next - garlic meatloaf .... 2 lbs garlic for every pound of meat. All those anti-oxidants ... yum !

As a huge fan of both onion & meatloaf, this was FABULOUS! My husband loved it, it now ranks right up there with Tater Tot Hotdish! (& that's hard to top!). Will be making this often, shared recipe with family & friends, all raved! Extra egg is a must tho.

I found this recipe okay but nothing spectatular. I didn't used the quantity of onion called for but I think that even more onion than I used would not have improved the taste or consistency.

I used to make meatloaf using onion soup and my husband loved it. Then he made this recipe and we were hooked. It's now the only meatloaf recipe we ever want to make!

Loved it- added some dry breadcrumbs to get it hold together better. The onions keep it so juicy and flavorful- hubby was crazy about it!

Decent meat loaf recipe, but the amount of onions was way off, I'd use about half, if that.

I added a generous splash of Habanero Tabasco to the mix, replaced the V-8 with an egg and added Worcestershire Sauce to the ketchup on the top of the loaf. Served with potatoes, this meatloaf leaped over my husband's favorite dishes and is at the top of his list.

I'm tossing out my other meatloaf recipes. This is truly one of the best! (And I never thought I'd say that about a meatloaf!) I used beef and pork, an egg instead of the vegetable juice. My only additions to the mixture were a hefty pinch each of dried basil and oregano, and some dry breadcrumbs to give it more body. And I couldn't resist placing a couple of bacon slices on top before adding the rest of the ketchup. Wonderful! The sauteed red onions really added big flavor and kept it moist. With wasabi mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli, this made a great comfort-food meal.

flavor was ok (i added thyme, worcestershire sauce and mustard to ketchup topping and mixed it into meat) but consistency was off. Husband compared it to dog food! I think the problem was that the fresh breadcrumbs are not hardy enough to give the loaf any type of shape. it was so moist that it simply disintegrated on the plate. next time i think i would use a binder with a little more substance - perhaps some crushed saltines. think there are better meatloaf recipes out there.

I made the recipe exactly as written with one exception; I'd run out of bread so used one onion bagel to make the bread crumbs. I didn't measure so it could have been a bit more bread than the recipe called for; it doesn't matter though as the consistency was perfect. I have this copy of Bon Appetit and, before making the recipe, spent some time remembering the victims of September 11. The woman who contributed this recipe was noted in the magazine as being a beverage manager at Windows on the World (WTC restaurant). I did learn that she survived the attack.

This was a great recipe! I replaced the veal with ground turkey (the store didn't have veal) and added a quarter cup of BBQ sauce ( I ran out of ketchup). I will be making this one again.

This is a wonderful recipe. First meatloaf recipe i have ever made and it was a success and special enough to serve to guests. The changes I made included omitting the v-8 and using egg. i mixed the ketchup with honey bbq sauce and worcestchire and tabasco. also, i mixed lean ground beef with hot turkey italian sausage. i served it with creamy mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli and red pepper. for dessert i served gingerbread ( not so successful, but that is another review in and of itself!). The meal made for a wonderful presentation and was prepared with no difficulty.

I had to use honey BBQ sauce instead of ketchup (didn't realize we had run out) and used ground turkey instead of the three kind of meat in the recipe. The result was fantastic, and my husband claims it to be the moistest and yummiest meatloaf he'd ever tasted.

This meatloaf is incredible. I guess it's true what everyone else says about it being a little squishy inside, but the taste is excellent.

What is a scallop and Thai noodle girl to do when she wants to make meatloaf? Use this recipe!! Wow was I impressed -- very juicy and yummy and easy to make. Only use fresh parsley and don't use the vegetable juice (I didn't use egg either though and all turned out ok). I didn't use veal --just organic pork and beef and spooned the drippings over skin on mashers and called it a meal.

Sustitute an egg for the vegetable juice. It's too loose otherwise-no structural integrity. Add some Tobasco to the ketchup for an extra kick.

This was great and believe me I have made every kind of meatloaf you can imagine. I omitted the vegetable juice and added 2 eggs and green chilies and vidaila sweet onion. Topped it with sour cream and Guacamole. Boy this was good.

This is the best meatloaf I have ever tasted. I did not have veal but it was great with ground beef and pork. The sauteed onions and ketchup inside and out gave it great flavor.

Beautifully flavored meat loaf, but there are consistency problems as other reviewers have noted. For a firmer meat loaf, I would increase the bread crumbs and/or add an egg. The pork and veal are what really make this one worth doing, and the freakish amount of red onions helps put it over the top. I know you're not supposed to overmix meatloaf, but make sure the different meats are well blended, as mine had pockets of pork and veal intermingled throughout. Not a bad thing thing though, and it actually added interest to the dish (interesting meatloaf--what a concept). I substituted a roasted red pepper sauce from Bobby Flay's line to pour over the top (awesome stuff!) and I forgot to buy vegetable juice so I used some sour cream as a moistening agent. Served it with scalloped potatoes & parsnips and green peas with pearl onions. Rosemount Cabernet Merlot blend worked well if you're a wino like me.

To the Connecticut cook and others reading the review, Inez, the author, was NOT in the WTC on that day. Do a search by name in any search engine and you will see articles attesting to that.

I ripped this page out of March issue with the intentions of trying the recipe. Re-reading the article I was overcome by the fact that the author is beverage manager for Windows On The World. Never have I used this site as a forum other than reading, rating & trying recipes but I have to express my sadness and my hope that the author is safe.

I'VE BEEN MAKING GOOD MEAT LOAF FOR YEARS (PER FEEDBACK)BUT I WAS TIRED OF USING THE SAME RECIPE. TRIED THIS ONE AND ITS FANTASTIC. MY HUSBAND HAS IT ON HIS "DO ANYTIME" LIST.IT'S SO MOIST, IT ACTUALLY DOESN'T EVEN NEED GRAVY.

This was a very tasty meatloaf, I wouldn't use it to 'wow' company though. Mine stayed together with no problems, in fact this was the first time I didn't cook it in a pan. Easy to prepare.

I have never been a big fan of meat loaf but this turned out awful...soggy and soft. My husband is a meat loaf eater from way back and even he wouldn't eat it. I'll try another recipe.

This tasted pretty good, but my son refused to eat it. My husband liked it and so did I. It was easy to make and was very moist and tender. I wrapped tin foil around the baking sheet first and sprayed it with Pam before putting the meat on the baking pan, to save on cleaning up. I think I prefer a firmer meatloaf, so I'll go back to my old standby. But it was worth a try...

this tasted wonderful but came out so soggy that the loaf wasn't holding its shape. I don't know what I did wrong.

This will be my new standard meatloaf recipe. Both the taste and texture were perfect. I made the recipe exactly as stated (unusual for me). I think it is VERY important to use the meat combination, and to use fresh bread crumbs. Both of these ingredients act to add volume, and prevent the denseness of my previous loafs. Also, be careful not to overcook. Use a thermometer, but an hour is usually plenty.

This is a wonderful and easy recipe. I used all ground beef. I also used a loaf pan instead of the suggested pan/method and it worked well. Serve with garlic mashed potatoes and you're sure to have a hit.

This was one of the best meatloaf recipes I have ever made. All of my guests said it tasted just like the famous meatloaf at the cheesecake factory. I could not find ground veal at my grocery store so I substituted with ground turkey and it worked well. I served this with garlic mashed potatoes and buttered corn. It was GREAT!
