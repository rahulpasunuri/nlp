I made this as specified and it makes a really tasty weeknight meal. I put orange butter on everything and worked very well. I thought the beets might be mushy, but no, they were crisp and fresh. I didn't find it difficult to grate them - I left about 4 inches of stems at the end to make a handle to hold onto while I used the box grater. No need to dirty the food processor!

Delicious. We will make it again.

We loved this meal. We actually did the chicken on the grill, but followed the recipe for the greens. Per other reviewers, I used balsamic vinegar and I put the orange butter on the greens rather than on the chicken. Sprinkled a small amt. of finishing salt on top. Delicious!

We received some beets and greens in our CSA box. This recipe was perfect. Simple preparation and great taste.

really yummy, especially the orange butter. I didn't have all the ingredients so I substituted green garlic and leeks for the shallots and balsamic for the sherry vinegar. I rubbed a little mashed garlic onto the chicken breasts and I added red cabbage to the beet greens, which was really delicious!

I disagree with the last review. I think it's really healthy, tasty and beautiful on the plate! If there is any drawback, it's the beet prep. Grating can be very messy and rough on the knuckles.

I wasn't impressed with this dish. easy? yes, healthy? yes, but delicious? no. It tastes like mid week dinner, nothing especial. I won't make it again.

My chicken was already cooking in the crockpot when I found this recipe for my beets. I did pop the chicken into the skillet for a few minutes to lightly brown even though it was already done. Then proceeded with the recipe as written except I used Balsamic vinegar. Greens had a great nutty flavor. This recipe paired nicely with Ellie Krieger's Orange-Pissacio Wild Rice Salad I had left over from yesterday. Definately a keeper!

I liked this recipe easy and tasty. I would not have thought to combine beets, greens, and chicken! I added garlic salt to the chicken.

I love beets and wanted a way to use them, my husband doesn't care for them but he liked this a lot. Now for the changes. No shallots so I used a red onion, no Sherry wine vinegar so I used a little basalmic and a little Port but more than the recipe called for. I was worried about tasteless chicken so sauted a crushed clove of garlic in the oil before putting in the chicken and then while cooking squeezed some of the orange into the pan, and since I happened to be drinking it at the time added a splash of white wine. Made more orange butter then called for and added some while cooking beets. It was really tasty! And my husband went back for seconds and even asked if there were more beets!

This was amazing! Beets with orange is my new favourite combo I think. I only changed how the chicken was cooked. I foil baked it in the oven and added some carrots and zuch's, some of the orange butter, half of the zested orange juiced, and the other half sliced on top. I think this solved the problem others had of having bland chicken - it all blended together beautifully. I also took anothers suggestion and stirred some of the orange butter into the beets too. Yummmm. I will make this again next week with my Beets from the CSA!

This was the first time I have ever actually liked beet greens. I love beets, but tend to always throw the greens away, as I have never been able to cook them in a way that I liked. This is a relatively fast and easy recipe, and it was quite good. The flavors blend well together.

Yum, yum, yum and healthy, healthy, healthy. This meal makes me feel like I'm at a spa and, it's beautiful on the plate!

A great, easy weeknight dish. Didn't have shallots on hand, so I subbed a bit of onion and it worked fine, though shallot would be better. I also cut the beets into matchsticks and cooked for about 5mins total.

Rating: 3
Really enjoyed and was so easy to prepare. We added bit of the orange butter to the greens and pankoed the cutlets which added a bit of crunch. Great little recipe.

Rating: 4
Definately worth making again. I also added more butter to the recipe. I didn't have fresh shallots available. In it's place, I used 2 tablespoons of store bought chopped shallots in a jar (in water). I also did not have sherry vinegar available. I substitued with 2 tablespoons sherry to 2 tablespoons of vinegar. Evenly divided between the greens and the beets. A very colorful tasteful meal.

I made this as written except used thighs instead of breasts. I did not enjoy it. The orange butter was good, but a strange combo with the vinegary greens. I believe there are better recipes for beets. Having them merely steamed doesn't do much for them.

I made this for dinner tonight. It is sooo good! I used a red and white striped beet and a bunch of gold beets. The dish will be great for Christmas. I cut the beets into shoestring/matchstick pieces. Walla! No mess, no clean up. Put the beets in the skillet for a couple minutes, put the greens in and stirred them in and cooked until soft to the bite. The reviewer who mentioned a dirt taste must not know one has to wash produce that comes from the ground.

I don't really care for beets and my husband surely doesn't, but this was amazing. I actually loved the orange-butter. I added a lot more orange zest than called for and I used all of the butter in the beets. I didn't put any of it in the greens. The greens were plenty flavorful with the shallots and I didn't want everything tasting of orange.

Rating: 3
This was a good dish. My husband isn't a fan of beet greens or "fresh" beets. He did eat most of his meal though and didn't complain. I really enjoyed the orange sauce, and felt that if you got a bit of everything (beets, chicken and greens) it made for a very delicious mouthful! We'll definitely make this again!

The person who came up with this recipe is a genius. The only changes I made were I cooked a slice of bacon separately but added a little of the bacon grease and the crumbled bacon to the beet greens. I also went a little heavy on the butter and used skin-on breasts. Otherwise recipe is good to go. The sherry vinegar with the beets is amazing and the orange rind with the chicken ties it all together. Great dish. It might even convert some beet haters.

Ive made this recipe a few times now but never with the chicken and it is even better each time i make it. I dont have a food processor so I finely dice the beets (have used either white or golden beets to cut down on mess) and use balsamic instead of the sherry. The best part of the dish is the beet greens so make sure you get a bunch of beets with lots of delish greens. Ive also made this with both orange and lemon butter and both have been great!

I agree that the chicken might have been a little bland as is. I prepared the beets as directed, but to the orange butter I added goat cheese, scallions, and a little garlic. Really made the dish! Served with thinly sliced fingerling potatoes sauteed til crispy. I loved this meal!

Rating: 4
This was phenomenal! Of course we made changes, but mostly due to lack of ingredients on hand. We added grated orange peel to the olive oil for the chicken cooking to avoid it being flavorless like others mentioned. Our beets came without greens so we substituted red swiss chard. And lastly no sherry vinegar, after researching substitutes we decided to use port instead. Then because we didn't use all the butter on the chicken we had some leftover for toast with honey, yum!

The chicken breast, while good, wasn't really inspiring. The 4-star rating is for the beets and beet greens, which would make great side-dishes for just about anything. The greens, especially, were excellent: a fresh, satisfying alternative to braised collards or cabbage.

Rating: 3
The orange butter chicken is simply suberb. The beets have a nice sweet flavor; a nice alternative to the pickled recipes you usually find. A beet recipe for people who usually do not like beets.

Rating: 3
I had some beets from the local growers' market and some frozen chicken breasts, so this looked quite doable. Both the beets and the greens were great; the chicken breast was sauteed check breast, just OK. Orange butter was a nice touch, but you don't need too much.

Rating: 3
Yum! I used baby beets chopped up instead of mature/grated and used 1/2 orange juice from the zested orange and half water for the cooking liquid. Also, increased amount of shallots slightly and used balsamic instead of sherry because thats what I had around. Really good!

I made this exactly as stated EXCEPT (I hate it when others do this, but...) I used panko on the chicken and used oil instead of butter. Flavors were fabulous.

This recipe was fast, used just one pan, it was beautiful, and . . . it tasted amazing. How many recipes use beets and beet greens? I don't even like beets, but I loved this recipe.

Rating: 4
This is a really tasty recipe. I love something that I can make with both parts of the beet in one meal and this is a good one. I've made it combing the grated beets with the greens and having them separately and I like it both ways, but maybe a little better mixed. This recipe also goes really well with the bulger pilaf (also a quick and easy). The flavors are amazing.

I thought the beets and greens were really delicious and my two year old devoured them. The rest of this recipe is a big yawn. Plain sauteed chicken breasts are not my idea of a tasty meal, that's just me. The orange butter was also nothing to write home about IMO. I'll keep the beets as a side for other, yummier dishes!

Easy to make and very tasty! I will definitely make this again, but I would pound the chicken with a meat mallet first to make it thinner.

This was my first attempt to ever cook beets. They were delicious! I decided to cut up the chicken breasts into small pieces so it would cook faster and served it with the beets and whole wheat cous cous. Delicious meal. I didn't have an orange so I skipped the orange butter. Still great without it. Would highly recommend, especially to those of you who are beet skeptics, like I was.

Chicken was okay, but the beet greens were soooo good. My kids thought so too. They wouldn't eat the beet bulb, but my husband and I thought these were also good. He ate the remaining beets for lunch the next day and they were also good cold. I will be doing this recipe again. Oh, and you must use the grater on a food processor in order to speed the job and keep your kitchen clean.

This was a very tasty, easy, one-pan weeknight meal. Food processer for the beets was a big help. We wished we had more greens on our beets. The beets were very mild-tasting and the kids liked it a lot. The orange butter is tasty but the dish would be good without it (but then you wouldn't have extra orange butter to put on bread).

Rating: 3
Delicious!! I used boneless pork chops instead of the chicken, and kale instead of the beet greens, but the flavors were all there and they tasted great together.

Good, but not great. bought the beets at the grocery store. Will try getting them local when in season and try again. Did love the beet greens and shallot mixture.

This recipe was simple and so delicious. We got beets in our CSA box and they're not something I would normally choose from the shelf, but now I'm hooked. I am thankful to have used a food processor, perhaps this is a big ordeal with a grater, nevertheless, the flavor pays off. I used red wine vinegar instead of sherry and the beets were organic and from a small farm (maybe the negative reviewer down there didn't have good beets).

Rating: 3
This is a great way to prepare beets. I liked that 2/3rds of this recipe comes from one (inexepensive) vegetable. I'll be using this to prepare beets & beet greens with all sorts of things in the future. The only modifications I made were that I sub'd red wine vinegar for sherry wine vinegar, and threw a pinch of sugar into the beets.

My husband, a friend, and I really enjoyed this recipe. I doubled it and am now looking forward to the leftovers! Peeling the beets was probably the most time-consuming part of the prep, and be sure to wash the greens thoroughly. Grating the beets in the food processor made clean up easy. This is not the kind of dish you can cook ahead of time though; only do the prep if you want to have a drink and appetizers first. I don't think I had to double the orange butter since I didn't use it all.

Rating: 4
Great flavors! I already had a roast chicken, so I skipped straight to the greens...should have used the food processor - sometimes I think it takes longer for me to get it assembled, but the grated beets fly over the counter and really do make a mess. So on the back end, clean-up would have been easier with the processor. I just warmed the chicken and served w/ beets and greens. Stirred a little orange butter into the beets...delicious! And made good leftovers to take for lunch

Do not make this recipe. I love beets and expected to like this recipe. It is horrible. It is not fast to make. It makes a mess of the kitchen also. Clean up took as long as prep. And it tasted...well it tsted like ground up dirt with a little greasy orange flavor. I put the leftovers in a lunch container and my husband threw the whole thing away - including the container. He didn't want to risk the flavor sticking to it.
