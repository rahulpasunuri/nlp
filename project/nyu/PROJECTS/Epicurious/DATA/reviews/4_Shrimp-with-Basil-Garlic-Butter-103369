I just made this again for the first time in years, even though I have a note that it's a great stand-by on the printed copy I have. I up the portion size and serve it as an entree with either little mashed potato or risotto patties that I mix up with a little egg and finely grated cheese. Chill them, then coat with panko and saute in olive oil until golden brown. They can then be put into the oven along with the shrimp to finish heating through while you make the sauce. They're both easy to make, and you can do all your prep in advance, then just whip it together a la minute. It impresses guests, and I love it!

Want an easy, yet memorable dish to whip up? This is it. I agree with other reviewers about 2 helpful hints: 1) Saute the shrimp for 1-2 minutes, then pull out of pan into a bowl. Add them back after you finish the sauce and simmer for a couple more mintues to reheat. 2) Cut down the butter to 3-4 tbls - it's plenty. (And FYI: if you only have a lime, instead of a lemon, it works well.) Have a crusty bread available for cleaning up the sauce from your plate.

Fabulous weeknight dinner, with the added bonus of being special enough for guests. The sauce is amazing. I omitted baking the shrimp and just sauteed them till cooked through. I also used 1/2 a cup wine and only 1/2 the butter. Served over whole-wheat linguine and it was perfect.

It is a Friday during Lent, so I decided I would use up the shrimp I had in my freezer. I found this recipe and decided to give it a try. Not only was it quick and easy, it was tasty as well. The flavors meld together well and it has fabulous color and texture. I decided to serve it in individual ramekins and it looked lovely. I definitely will make this recipe again.

This is a wonderful recipe. By mistake I bought shell on shrimp, so we had to eat it with fingers and lick up that fabulous sauce. I wished we had had had bread to mop up that sauce, it is incredibly yummy.

This recipe created a flavorful, tasty dish that didn't take long to do. Instead of putting the shrimp in the oven, we just sauteed them until they were done (2 min per side). The sauce was sublime!

pretty good basic shrimp recipe- Has good flavors but I guess I have had better recipes (that don't have the butter thicken and when it gets cold and make you feel like you are clogging arteries) - I probably will make it again since it was easy and still tasty

I made this easy recipe with my mom (I am eight). It was awesome!!! We doubled the sauce, and it was still not enough. I am going to make this recipe for the rest of my life. I will try it with chicken for my dad, who is not a shrimp lover. Extremely good recipe!!

This is a favorite with my son and daughter (my husband is a reluctant seafood eater).I made this to celebrate my daughter's return from college for winter break. I don't change a thing, except to serve it over angel hair pasta, as some have noted, and I make more, to serve as a main course.And I have to be careful not to forget the shrimp in the oven when I prepare the sauce, so as not to overcook it. This is really delicious!

Rave reviews from all!!! I have made this recipe a number of times now for family and guests. Serve it over fluffy steamed Basmati rice. Everyone loves it. Never any leftovers, no matter how much I make. I have learned to prepare everything ahead, because the 7 minutes that the shrimp is cooking is not enough time to get everything else organized. I make it exactly per the recipe. Why tamper with perfection?

Easy and quick to prepare. Good combination of flavors. A very tasty entree. I used a bit less butter and I don't think it hurt the result. I served it with the shrimp and sauce on top of a little white rice with cooked spinach on the side. The presentation was nice with the varying colors.

I grill the shrimp (after tossing with a bit of olive oil and garlic) - double or triple the sun dried tomatoes without chopping them (buy julienned) and add a bit of the sun dried oil, and serve the whole thing over pasta with extra lemon on the side. It's delicious!

I made this dish for myself since my wife doesn't really care for shrimp or sun-dried tomatoes, two ingredients that are cornerstones of this dish. But she loved it and couldn't stop. She's requested it again twice in the last month. I rarely make recipes more than (there are thousands that I still need to explore!) but for this dish I make an exception. As with most shrimp dishes it is really quick to make and is a tasty dish for a weeknight.

The dish was quite good, a nice change from shrimp and pasta with pesto. I barely used butter at the end, and I don't think it suffered. I used dried basil and I would like to make it again with fresh, I think tht might get the 4 forks rating -- it cooks so quickly the dried can't possibly keep up.

I have never done this before, but am going throught he buzz box and saw this review. I love Henry's End!!! My husband and I used to live in BH and enjoyed many a meal there and always took visitors. That was 12 years ago and now we are in Hong Kong so am glad the restaurant is still there. I will try these and post my review...but if you are in the neighborhood the food is faboulous. My dad and stepmom would visit us and my dad would just ask the chef to give him whatever was good. Elk chops come to mind as one dinner he talked about for years!!!!!

My guests raved over these shrimp. I used three pounds of large gulf shrimp and tripled the sauce. In the end, I could have just doubled the sauce but it was better to have too much than not enough. I put the shrimp in the oven as directed and they were perfectly done in 8 minutes. Glad I did because had I left them in the skillet while making the sauce, I think they would have come out overcooked and tough. Will definitely make this again, it's a winner!

Somebody asked how this compares to the "shrimp scampi pasta"; I think I like that one a little more, because it allows for the fact that most people will serve a dish like this over pasta or some kind of starch. They are very similar and I'll probably combine elements of both in the future. I always have added chopped fresh campari tomatoes to the shrimp scampi pasta, but sun-dried tomatoes are very nice, too. One variation I suggest is to lightly dredge the shrimp in flour along with the salt & pepper- it really facilitates the sauce-thickening process.

Rating: 4
This dish is wonderful! I add more white wine after the stated amount reduces down, just to make this a bit more saucy. I also have used less butter for health reasons, and it still tastes wonderful. I have made this quite a few times, and will make it again, as it is very easy. Be careful, this dish comes together very quickly, so have all ingrediants ready before hand. I also like to make extra sauce, and serve the shrimp (more than listed when doing this) over angel hair pasta, which makes this a meal. I have used different sizes of shrimp, just adjusted the cook times,as I prefer smaller shrimp to really large ones.

Rating: 4
An unbeatable recipe that I will make again and again. I used regular butter instead of unsalted and served it over thin spaghetti noodles. I used smaller shrimp than suggested and cut down the cooking time in the oven to around 4 minutes. Best shrimp recipe I have ever found!

This dish was so easy-the timing for the shrimp was perfect, the prep was very simple, and the taste was sensational. My husband raved over it. The only change I made was halving the butter-it made no difference. I wish every dish gave this kind of return after such an effortless preparation.

I would give it 3.5 forks with the following modifications: add sauteed mushrooms, less butter than called for (by half) and some red pepper flakes. Also, you definitely need to double the ingredients for the sauce or you won't have anywhere near enough. Not the healthiest dish in the world, but very tasty and easy.

Completely delicious and quick and easy to prepare too! I substituted a roma tomato for the sun-dried, and added it at the end instead of beginning. I also sauteed a little crookneck squash with the garlic and I added a shallot. Served with bow tie pasta and what can I say? HUGE hit!

This was a simple and very tasty dish. I served it to a weekend guest and she loved it just as much as I did. Instead of using 6 tablespoons of butter, I only used 2, and I used it to cook the shrimp (with the olive oil) until almost done, set them aside, then added 1/4 cup of heavy cream combined with everything else, threw the shrimp back in until done and then served over fusilli pasta (I think angel hair would have been better!) Delicious, fast and EASY!! Topped with a bit of freshly grated parm and a few toasted pine nuts!

This dish is absolutely wonderful! And the restaurant it comes from is one of the best in the city. An undiscovered treasure that is definitely worth the trip over the bridge for.

This was so simple yet so decadent. I used about 25 medium-size shrimp and it came out fine. I served this on al dente penne rigate (although I suggest angel hair, which I did not have). I also did not have sundried tomatoes, so I used a can of chopped tomatoes. It came out wonderfully! I have always had good experiences with canned tomatoes, no matter what anybody says, they are still good. Be sure not to use all of the juice, but plenty of the tomatoes; they add so much flavor and taste excellent after reduced in the wine sauce. I used lemon zest, as suggested, and probably should have used more because it did not shine through the garlic or basil. I used slightly less butter, as suggested, and the sauce was amazing. I did a quick chiffonade over the basil and it reduced to great success. I would probably use a slightly less amount of basil next time. I highly reccomend this dish.

Went for the gusto. Doubled the sauce ingredients. Including the butter! Gasp! Not sorry! Served it over angel hair. Too swoon over! Left sauce/calories in the bowls. The shrimp/pasta was out of this world! Didn't have sd tomatoes, but had sd pesto. So fast, so easy, sooooooooo good! Oh! I sauted the shrimp for about 2 minutes on each side, then placed in a warm oven until I completed the sauce & pasta. Then added the shrimp to the sauce. Think cooking the shrimp as long as suggested may be tempting with tough shrimp. Gotta use common sense.

I'd give it a 3 but my husband said 5 forks. So we averaged. Wanted to use the sauce on pasta so doubled the wine, basil, lemon and garlic. And tripled the tomato and only used 4 tablespoons of butter. We still did not have lots of sauce, but it is so rich a little goes a long way. I'll triple everthing next time and still only use 4 tablespoons of butter.

Great flavor combination! I used 3 TBSP butter and fresh tomato. Wow, the tomato really makes the dish. I will try with the sundried just to compare, but the fresh was very good. My husband wants us to add some lemon zest, and I think he's probably onto something. Next time I will use a bit more basil and the zest and see if that kicks up the flavor even more.

This was wonderful. Like many of the reviewers I doubled all of the sauce ingredients, except the butter, and it made enough to coat about 3/4 of a pound of angel hair pasta. There was plenty of butter to make this dish rich and yummy. I was out of whole s-d tomatoes, but I discovered I had a tube of sun dried tomato sauce. It took the whole tube to get the 4 tbls, but it dissolved beautifully into the sauce.

Excellent dish and so easy to make! I used large frozen shrimp and did not bake them in oven. I left them in the pan (with a bit of garlic) for 2 more minutes and returned them to the sauce towards the end. Except for this minor change, the recipe was followed to the letter. Very appealing to the eyes because of the green (basil) and red (sun-dried tomatoes). I served over a small bed of fettuccine. Perfect for two. Would also have been wonderful served alone as an appetizer. Will make this often!

I'm a native Bostonian - and wanted to make a scampi-type dish for a dinner party. All I have to say is 'wow'. My dinner guests agreed.

I have made this recipe a number of times, both for company and kids. It has been raved about each and every time. I have added fresh tomatoes when I didn't have sundried and the recipe doesn't seem to suffer at all. I have also served it over Angel Hair as well as white rice and each party eating it were extremely happy to do so. I imagine that serving it as is, with only a hunk of bread, salad and a glass of wine would be equally as wonderful, if not better, because the flavors would not be masked by the pasta or rice.

What a delicious, flavorful dish! I served it as a first course one evening and it was a huge hit.

This was delicious - very simple to make with a wonderful blend of flavors. I used smaller shrimp, and they were just about done after a minute on each side in the pan.

Love this dish. I make it without the tomato and adding some zest from the lemon and it is a nice light dish that everyone loves. Everyone. No basil on hand, use parsley, but the basil is wonderful. The lemon and garlic carry the dish.

This was an excellent dish! I served over cappelini, I should have doubled the sauce. I also cut back on the butter and didn't use the oven at all. My husband loved it too. Served with a green salad and crusty bread. Delicious!

I've made this dish twice. Second time was perfect. I didn't bake shrimp, just did them in the pan. I doubled the sauce so there was enough to pour over angel hair pasta. I also added about 1/3 c of chopped fresh tomatoes and I cut back on the butter a bit. Yum.

This recipe was fantastic and simple. Use fresh basil, organic garlic and large shrimp and you can't go wrong. I served it with a saffron rice with diced red pepper and it was not only gorgeous to look at it was delicious. The only problem? Now my friends turn up all the time expecting the same show!!

Made this with a few changes. Used chopped, deseeded, Jersey tomatoes (what I had on hand, plus hubby doesn't like sun-dried) and added ALOT more garlic (around 4 cloves). Also did not use oven at all. Just added the shrimp in toward the end, then removed them when I added the butter (two tablespoons short of given amount) and basil. When I make this next time I will wait until the end to add the tomatoes. They broke down a bit too much for me, but this recipe was still absolutely delicious. Served with bread for dipping as an appetizer. Will serve over pasta next time. Definitely good enough for company and super, super easy.

WOW!! SUPER FLAVOR. INCREASED QUANTITIES A BIT & SERVED AS AN ENTREE WITH FETTUCINE, FRESH PARMESAN ON THE PASTA ONLY!! YES, I DID DIP MY SHRIMP INTO THE CHEESE! TO PREPARE AGAIN, I WOULD NEVER HEAT THE OVEN. PREP SHRIMP,SAUTE BREIFLY IN OIL & GARLIC. SET ASIDE WHILE I PREPARED THE BASICS OF THE SAUCE. ADD SHRIMP BACK WHILE SAUCE WAS REDUCING, THEN ADD BUTTER & BASIL. I'D ALSO USE LARGE VS JUMBO SHRIMP. I LOVE A PREVIOUS REVIEWER'S IDEA OF ADDING A LITTLE CAYENNE! THIS IS A REAL KEEPER. MAYBE NEXT TIME I'LL TRY IT WITH CHICKEN.

Stop the presses - this one really ROCKS! It was sooo fast and one of the tastiest things I've ever eaten! I used a whole lb of large shrimp (16 count) and my S.O. and I ate it ALL! I served it over a small serving of very el dente fresh linguine with an oaky/buttery chardonnay and it was an unimaginable delight. I added a sprinkling of cayenne for some a touch of heat. I brined the shrimp for 15 mins before cooking (2 tbsp each salt and sugar in ice water - soak 15 mins then rinse and cook). I didnt precook the shrimp, I prepped the sauce then added the shrimp and cooked it over high heat for a scant few minutes (didnt add the basil till the very end. The shrimp were crisp, sweet and succulent. I very highly recommend this recipe.

I made this tonight and it was a huge hit!! I served it with white rice, asparagus and carrots with sugar snap peas.The only thing I changed was I didn't have regular stick butter-only whipped butter.It didn't seem to make any difference because it couldn't have been better. A definite keeper!

This was so delicious and very easy. I was also thrilled that it was a "quick to prepare" meal over pasta. I used elephant garlic which I love for its smoothness (I'm like Emeril with the garlic) and no bad breath for days! This is on my regular list of meals.

I love this recipe and have prepared it over and over again..I dont bother baking the shrimp, just saute a little longer and add back to the sauce before adding butter and basil. I have also added fresh tomatoes and reduced the sauce which works well too. I always have served it over pasta passing the parmesan cheese. ( I know the Italian purists would say never serve parmesan with seafood, but to heck with it ...its GOOD!!!!!

This was so good and easy to make it will become a regular item on our dinner menu. I've made this recipe twice; once with shrimp and once with chicken. I cut down on the butter and increased the olive oil. When making with chicken I cooked the chicken in the pot as opposed to putting it in the oven like the shrimp. I also increased the amount of garlic, tripled amount, in the recipe. This dish is very very flavorful and makes a good leftover to bring to work!

I lost count of how many times I have made this dish. It is always a HIT and I look like a great cook. I serve it on top of pasta or rice, both work well. I usually cut down the butter by half and use frozen raw shrimp and sundried tomatoes marinated in olive oil. I have tried the shrimp in the oven and mixing it in with the sauce and the results are always good but I prefer the oven better. I would be carefull with the lemon, I am not the type of cook that measures everything to the exact amount and sometimes I have ended up with a little too much lemon.

This sounded so good and I had tons of fresh basil in my garden. Maybe I did something wrong but I was not impressed with this dish...the only change I made was adding scallops to the shrimp so it was more of a hearty entree. The sauce just seemed watery and I did reduce it. Oh well...I will try again!

Henry's End is one of my favorite restaurants in the NY Metropolitan area so I was delighted to find a recipe from there. We made it last night and it was fabulous. Doubled the wine, lemon and sun dried tomatoes and added a dash of chili pepper to the shrimp before cooking it. We served it over angel hair pasta and it was fabulous. Next time I have a dinner party, this is the meal. Excellent.

I enjoyed this very much. My 9 year old son did not like the sun dried tomatoes, so he just picked them out. My husband enjoyed it, but said there were too many sun dried tomatoes. I doubled the quantity of everything except the butter. I also did not have jumbo shrimp, used large. I enjoyed the leftovers over rice the next day.

This wasn't a dish beyond compare, but it was pretty darn good. Simple basics combine to give the shrimp a very full flavor, but something else was needed. The sauce tasted delicious, and the sun-dried tomatoes added a very good aroma. I would definitely make this dish again.

A wonderful dish that can be made as either a first course or main course. I made it as a main course & also served it over linguini. I allowed six jumbo shrimp per person, doubled the sun dried tomatoe and lemon. Was worried that cooking the shrimp partially in the oven would overcook them but it didn't. Will try adding roasted red pepper and mushrooms next time!

This dish is excellent as a casual dinner if you use small to medium shrimp and add them to the sauce at the last minute to cook. I used half the butter and added some fresh green beans. They cook while the sauce is reducing. Serve over rice. Pretty fast and very popular.

I did not have sun-dried tomatoes, so I used fresh. Also, I used a 12 oz. bag of frozen shrimp and eliminated the oven part (because they were already cooked) and it came out fantastic!! I toasted thick slices of french bread and served them in deep plates, covering them with the shrimp and sauce. The bread was amazing because it soaked up some of the sauce ..mmmmm... I think fresh tomates might be better than sun-dried, but next time I will garnish the toasts with them instead of cooking them in the sauce. But it still came out wonderful, even though frankly, the shrimp was pretty bad. The great sauce covered their less-than-fresh taste.

This dish was easy and tasty. I only used 6 jumbo shrimp but kept the rest of the recipe intact and served over linguine. It made enough for 2. I would make it again, except that it is sooo buttery. It is pretty much a butter souce, when served over pasta. Too much butter for this calorie counter. I would definitely make it as a first course, so the eater could control the butter intake.

I doubled this recipe & took the advice of the cook from England & served it over linguine. It was very flavorful, used roasted garlic. By doubling the recipe I don't think I would double the butter next time. When I reheated it the next day it was very oily - maybe from the sundried tomatoes. My husband loved it!

I made this for two people as a main course and served it over linguine - it was awesome - I loved it and so did my husband. There was plenty of sauce for the pasta and it was very flavorsome and garlicky - the sun dried tomatoes are great in this. I didn't have raw jumbo shrimp but I had some already cooked frozen medium shrimp and it still came out great. I bet it would be delicious with the jumbo shrimp for a first course with plenty of crusty bread to dip in the juices. This is the best epicurious recipe I've tried - I'll definitely be making it again soon - try it, you'll love it!
