At first I wasn't sure how the flavors of tomatoes, leeks and white wine in the sauce would meld, but it turned out great. We made it as written, with maybe a bit extra garlic, and it tasted really good with the Dover Sole. Unlike other reviewers, I think frying the fish after flouring gives it extra flavor and a crispy crust. The leeks were greaqt, I'll definitely make it again.

Fantastic. Used flounder with the skin off and toothpicks. Poached in the sauce for about 10 minutes.

I"m reviewing just the leek/tomato compote part of the recipe this time, as I served it as a side dish to "Sole with Herb Butter". The leeks/tomatoes are so delicious. As with the last time I made the dish, I upped the leek to tomato ratio. This gets four forks for simplicity and flavor. It has a tasty, mild acidity balanced by the olive oil, with lots of flavor. An easy, healthy and pretty side dish. Yummy!

I made a few changes, but this was a very easy recipe and delicious...I added a fresh cayenne pepper from the farmer's market (diced) and didn't have white wine, so I substituted chardonnay pear vinegar (1/4 cup-ish) and a red/BBQesque sauce I like (Larrapin Red, 1/8 cup).....I never can seem to leave a recipe along, but it always goes well....served with rice pilaf & steamed veggies.

I thought about giving this a third fork for the simplicity. This is a delicious and quick way to cook white fish. I chose to put in half the amount of tomato - I recommend it; it showcases the leeks. I served it with garlic mashed potatoes. A great compliment to the leek and tomatoes. Definitely worth making.

Delicious and Easy. I tweeked it a bit as I'm not a huge garlic fan, but still found it to be super tasty. I used fresh lemon thyme and only wine (no broth). I cooked the fish as suggested in the sauce and it came out super moist and cooked to perfection. I did try the recipe with Tilapia the second time and the petrale sole was definitely superior.

This was great. I used mahi mahi, seared it first then finished it in the sauce. I cooked the leeks in butter and longer, about 10 minutes. I reduced the wine before adding the broth and used only half the tomatoes. I will definitely make this again and probably use the sauce with chicken too.

WAY LESS TOMATOES! And I am a huge tomato fan-but they overpowered the expensive tasty leeks. Could use 3 leeks even.

This was very very good. It was easy and extremely flavorful. Used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth and 5 fresh peeled tomatoes instead of canned because they were available. The whole family loved it! The fish melted in your mouth!

Very easy and tasty. I used tilapia (no sole available) and baked it in the sauce, because I knew tilapia wouldn't hold up to pan frying. 400 degrees 18 minutes. Delicious and easy!

Used an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce, tilapia filets and left out the broth. Also, sprinkled it with parsley. It was great.

I went with the rest here and didn't flour the fish. S&P then poached it in the sauce. Didn't have toothpick either. Just folded the fillets over and nestled them in the sauce then lifted them out carefully when done. Fast enough for a mid-week meal. The tomatoes and leeks give it a wonderful color. This is going into my regular mid-week recipes.

new twist to save on the calories. DO NOT flour the fish, instead just rinse, S&P and fold in half with the toothpick. Once the tomatoes have simmered, place the fish in the sauce and cook on a simmer for 6-8 minutes. Remove carefully and remember to discard the toothpicks. Much less fat and calories and there is no difference in taste.

Like most people, I cooked the fish in the sauce. This is a great way to make tender fish, I often do it with curries. I substituted the thyme with fresh marjoram, which was really nice. Also, I skipped the veggie broth. Who needs all that liquid? I served it with roasted baby artichokes, which were seasoned with olive oil, sea salt, fresh marjoram and rosemary. Would go well with a very dry sauvignon blanc or riesling.

This was Delish!! I had some shrimp which I halved lengthwise. I added these to the thickened sauce and once they were opaque, added the sole (I too left out the flour and frying part). Everything was wonderful!

Made this with salmon trout and the fish turned out very moist and tasty. I cooked the fish directly in the sauce as some previous reviews recommended. Would have liked a somewhat thicker sauce but that's a minor point. The recipe is great when you're short of time but want to serve something delicious and healthy.

Like the cook from West Vancouver, I didn't flour or fry the fish-just added it to the sauce and saved the extra calaries. I had a number of garden tomatoes that I cut in half and boiled and then added to the leeks. The skins fell right off while they boiled.

This was very good. We used Rock Sole for the fish, and our homemade chicken broth (very dark and flavorful) diluted a little for the veg. broth. Otherwise, followed as is. Served with a bit of saffron rice and it was delish. Would make again ... plan to.

Unlike other reviewers, I found this recipe kind of blah and probably wouldn't make it again.

I have made this dish 6 times and no one tires of it. It is great for a quick dinner for the family as well as company. I gave to my in-laws in Florida who prepared for friends down there and it's now making the rounds in the senior circuit. Prepare the sauce first and for timing start the fish when the tomatoes start to boil, you may need more than 5 minutes for the tomato reduction. Mashed potatoes are great on the side with the extra leek-tomato sauce. I like the idea of poaching the fish.

A really good, lowfat recipe - lovely with brown rice.

Will make again even though my first attempt wasn't exactly "as is" - had to use onions instead of leeks, red wine instead of white. I still think it needs something, perhaps cilantro. Did not bother with the extra step of frying the fish, just added it to the sauce and poached it for about 5 mins. Served with rice, might be interesting with mashed spuds, too.

Very good. The recipe leaves you with plenty of chunky sauce, so potatoes or rice as a side dish make sense. I ignored the toothpick suggestion and then promptly say my thin fillets break apart when I turned them over in the skillet. Use them.

I would make this again mainly because my boyfriend's favorite fish is sole and he seemed to like it. I prefer more flavorful fish, so I thought this sauce really overwhelmed the delicate taste of the sole. This site has another recipe for sole in a leek cream sauce that I think is better, but this is a good way to get more vegetables into the equation.

Very good - Although, I used fresh tomatoes rather than canned and cooked the sauce for about 25 minutes at low heat to really reduce it and let the different flavors blend.

I can't believe it tasted so good. I used fresh thyme from the garden. Warning: read the recipe through before cooking so you can organize yourself. A lot happens in a very little time.

Yum! Tried this one Friday when bored with the same Ol Fish. Delicious. The sauce is easy, smells great and everyne loved it.

So simple! Sauce is plenty for 4. Wouldn't change a thing. I cut the leeks in 1/3 inch strips. Delicious!

Sauce is delicious. Used left-over sauce next day for Brushetta - top it with parmesean cheese and broil. I also added a couple of Tablespoons of cream to the sauce to smooth it out a bit.

A terrific dish and really easy to make! I modified just slightly. First I dredged the sole in flour and sauteed in a little garlic flavored olive oil in a teflon pan. I used 1 tablespoon. When it was almost done, I transferred to a covered plate. Then I sauteed the garlic, leeks and I added mushrooms. When just starting to brown, I added chicken broth and canned diced tomatoes and the wine. I let it really simmer down much longer than the recipe states until it starts to thicken. When ready, I put the fish back in and let the sauce coat it and let it finish cooking for another minute. I only made 2 filets so there was lots of sauce which we soaked up with fluffy rice. YUM!!

The smell of this cooking makes the mouth water. The taste is better than the smell. We enjoyed the sauce without any additions and will surely make it again. It is a top priority in my recipe box.
