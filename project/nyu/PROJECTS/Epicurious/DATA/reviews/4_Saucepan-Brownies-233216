Terrible, I followed the recipe exactly, and it might be better with less sugar, but as it stands, disgustingly sweet. I even looked at that number a couple times and thought about it, but thought I'd put faith in the recipe because most of them on this site are decent, but these brownies are disgusting.

Excellent brownie recipe. I followed it exactly and the brownies, served warm with vanilla ice cream, were a big hit. Will make again!

Simple, basic recipe--can be easily modified. Moist, chewy. It loses nothing if you reduce the sugar to taste or even use brown sugar. Using Callebaut 55% cacao, I melted the chocolate and butter together in the microwave. I tripled the recipe, and baked for 30 minutes in a parchment-lined jelly roll pan. I imagine it would keep well or even improve in flavor in the freezer or air-tight container, but I can't seem to keep them around long enough to test it out!

Oh, in addition to substituting gluten-free flour, I also cut back on the sugar, as so many suggested. Perfect.

As I cannot eat gluten, I substituted gluten-free Namaste Perfect Flour Blend for the regular flour. The results were unbelievably yummy.

Perfect brownies and so easy to make! This will be my go to recipe. I absolutely love being able to make them in one pan without separate bowls, a mixer, etc. Like others, I reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup. I added nuts, dried cherries and a bit of coconut. Mine came out dense, chewy and not too sweet. Delicious!

These were the best brownies I have ever made. Like other reviewers, I reduced the sugar to 1 1/4 cup. I also reduced the flour to 1/2 cup so I would have a fudgier brownie. The addition of chunks of bittersweet chocolate topped it off to delight the entire family.

This is the best recipe I have ever found for Brownies!! They were perfect, moist, chewey and fudgy. The only thing I changed about the recipe was to add an additional tsp of vanilla. The ease of the recipe was a big plus, I will be making these often

The worst recipe I have ever made off Epicurious' website :( I was so hopeful, but these turned out terribly, with the butter separating from the other ingredients while cooking ... they looked like they were frying in fat. $5 worth of primo chocolate wasted!

These brownies are wonderful. I've made them at least a half dozen time - reducing the sugar by 1/4-cup. Just to change 'em up I've added things like coconut, Kahlua, almonds, mint extract -but they are delicious just with the regular recipe. If you like easy homemade recipes - this one is right for you.

Since I like things less sweet, and someone already had a very strong reaction to the sweetness of these, I reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup, just to see. Good thing I did: they have just the right bittersweet balance. Like other reviewers, I took them out sooner, after 25 minutes, and that was just about right. Much longer and they would have dried out.

I think the cook from New Orleans either used sweetened chocolate or too much sugar because these brownies are fabulous! I have some in the oven right now. Be sure to bake them only 25 minutes though, and I like a pinch more salt. Really these are heavenly.

Actually, this recipe deserves ZERO forks, but that was not an option. I followed the recipe exactly and these were horrible: WAY TOO SWEET. All I could taste was sugar and and maybe the vanilla. The butter, chocolate could not be tasted at all. What a waste of good chocolate!!!!!

Absolutely my favorite basic brownies! So easy. I baked them just 20 minutes and they were perfect. The first time I baked them 25 min but that was a little too long. My pan may be 9x9 instead of 8x8 as the recipe instructs, which would account for the difference in baking times.

I loved this recipe for its simplicity. Unfortunately, my brownies didn't turn out that well. I baked the brownies for exactly 30 minutes because I like them fudgy and gooey; instead, as they cooled down, they became almost rock hard. I use a separate oven thermometer, so I don't attribute my crunchy brownies to strange oven temperatures. I've decided not to give a fork rating until I try this recipe again - if I get it to work, I'll post again. This recipe is just too easy to throw away! I do, however have two suggestions. I think it would be better to melt the butter and chocolate using a double boiler (easy enough) and I would butter the baking pan (just in case). One more thing - do not attempt to move the brownies until they've cooled completely. Even though the texture was off, they were yummy. And luckily my boyfriend had never tried brownies before, so he didn't know the difference.

Best brownie recipe I have found! For the chocolate, I used two 2.47-oz bars of Santander 70% cocoa (because it was recommended in a taste test in Gourmet magazine). Also need to let them cool completely because they will be soft inside. Great!

These brownies are moist and chewy, very easy to make, good flavor. I used Ghirardelli unsweetened chocolate and plugra butter (cultured) and increased the salt to 1/2 teaspoon.
