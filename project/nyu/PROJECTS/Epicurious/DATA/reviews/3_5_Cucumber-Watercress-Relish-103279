Served this with grilled salmon, and an oakey California chardonnay, plus an orzo salad. Wonderful. Definitely a keeper.

I made this as a relish for the tarragon fennel butter salmon. I adapted it with less onion as a salad for roasted lamb on Easter Sunday and it went down very well. The fennel really adds a lovely tang

I made this to go with the tarragon salmon, which I made as a dill salmon. I added some radishes to the relish and some shallots instead of red onion. It was very tasty.

A excellent relish. Good for the summer. Goes well with the Baked Salmon with Tarragon and Fennel-Seed Butter.
