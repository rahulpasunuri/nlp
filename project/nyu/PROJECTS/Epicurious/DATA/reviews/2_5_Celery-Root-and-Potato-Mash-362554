This recipe was fine. My only issue was the celery root was ridiculously expensive. Not really worth it in the end.

Made for Thanksgiving and both cooks thought this was bland and flavorless, even though we had substituted yukon gold for the russets. In our case, couldn't taste the celeriac at all and ended up sauteing a couple cloves of garlic in salted butter and adding.

I feel bad saying it was just "okay"... The celery root is a bit of a bully, if I make it again it will cut way back and also add some herbs. There wasn't much in the way of flavor outside of celery. That said, I tend to be very light with the butter and dairy but it still felt like it was lacking. Great base to start with and make it your own.
