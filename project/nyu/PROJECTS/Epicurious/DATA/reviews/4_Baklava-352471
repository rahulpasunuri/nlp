Middle East Countries is known have Baklava as their favorite treat as the recipes varies from country to country. It has been known since the Hellenistic period. The best one I tasted was in Greek Cyprus and it was made of walnats spices and honey. The Greek Cypriots have using this recipe for over 2000 years.

First of all Turkish Baklava syrup does not have any honey,cinnamon , clove or cardamom in it. Second, % 80 baklava consumed in Turkey is made with pistacchio,not walnuts. Most people buy walnut baklava because they are out of pistachio one. Then there is the "kaymak" which is a clotted water buffalo cream ,has to be layered along with pistachios as well.Closest thing you can substitute is Marscapone. I have spent enough time in Turkey and city of Gaziantep (Mecca of Baklava) despite CIA's credentials this recipe is as authentic as Guacamole that has sweet chili sauce in it.

This was an exceptional recipe, first of all. If you know how to work with phyllo, then it's not labor-intensive at all and it's a very impressive dish to take to a party. One thing was wrong with this recipe, I didn't use more than a half of the syrup...there was WAY too much. Waayyyy too much. Same goes with the butter for brushing. Other than that, it was perfect! I will make this again and again and again. The spices are perfect, the flavor is perfect. It's not too sweet or too crunchy, it's a recipe worth keeping.

To chime in with the recent comment: yes, traditional baklava from Turkey does not have any kind of spice or honey. I believe these ingredients are used in other middle eastern countries, and Greece. also, the more butter means fluffier baklava. if you skimp on the butter, it might get soggy and layers may stick to each other...

Perhaps this is a tasty recipe, but as it is listed in this week's e-mail as a Turkish recipe, I beg to differ: Turkish baklava contains no honey, no cardamom, no spices at all. And while it is possible to make it with walnuts, it may also be made with pistachios. I have tried so much baklava in Turkey and not once was there any honey or spices in it. This spiced baklava is from other countries.

Two suggestions for this foolproof recipe. Place a damp dishtowel over the phyllo dough once you've unrolled the sheets. It keeps the dough supple and workable. Secondly, invest in a great honey (like chestnut) BUT if you don't have any on hand, put two juniper berries in the syrup and boil with the lemon peel and clove. It will give you the balsamy taste that is characteristic of many Mediterranean honeys.

Crush the walnuts in a thick ziplock bag with a rolling pin to break into small pieces. Use Orange Blossom water 1/2 cup and reduce the water volume by the same amount. I made the syrup ahead of time and used some of it ( about 3 tablespoons ) on the Baklava before I baked it. Watch the video it helps to get an idea of what you should be doing. Note - if you follow the care with the filo pastry you shouldnt have any issues.

A P.S. to my review: I used all the butter and all of the syrup. I did not see the chef's note about 2/3 nuts and did 8 phyllo, nuts; 4 phyllo, nuts; 4 more phyllo nuts and it was still great.

I have made baklava many times and thought I would try a new recipe. This was fabulous! The recipe is sweeter than other baklava and the amount of syrup makes it especially moist and great. My guests put it straight with comments "this is the best baklava I've had"....and this from a group of foodies! The hint: excellent phyllo dough that you keep moist while you prepare it. I served with a small (2-3 oz) of vanilla bean ice cream sprinkled with Penzy's cinnamon.

i haven't made this yet, but i am as soon as i shop. for those of your who were wondering about the other third nuts, the first layer is 2/3 nuts per the video attached. you should watch, the CIA chef sure makes it look easy. i'll write another review after i make it.

This was very well received. I used a food processor to chop the nuts a cup at a time. Easy peasy. I also added the juice from 1/2 lemon and about 1/4 cup of orange juice to the sauce, and the citrus undertone was great. I used, like many others, 1 cup of butter which was absolutely enough.

Wonderful! This tastes better than many restaurant versions I've had. The flavor and texture are top noch. Like other reviewers, I used only 1 cup of butter and most, but not all, of the syrup.

Delicious! Some tips: It's true that you don't need the full 1.5 cups of butter, but I did need one cup. Also, if you don't like your baklava completely drenched in syrup, then don't use the full amount. But I do, and several people agreed it tastes quite good, so use it all if you want!

Highest marks! All the flavours come out with every bit! I do have a couple comments: 1) I used only 1 stick of butter (1/2 cup) and of that only used half of it. 2) I had twice as much syrup as I needed. The extra syrup turned out to be great because I am hell bent on making another batch tomorrow! Thank you for sharing this, it is a masterpiece.

To: A Cook from NYC, there should be another section of nuts and phyllo sheets. Also, make sure you use a candy thermometer when boiling your syrup. If you boil the syrup to 325 degrees, it will all be soaked up by your baklava, without running. My husband and I make a LOT of baklava and have found thse tips useful.

This sounds wonderful and being a big fan of baklava, I'm eager to try it. Just wondering if it's missing a step - I can only account for 2/3 of the walnut mixture. Perhaps I should just repeat the prior step...suggestions?
