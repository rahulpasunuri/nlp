I've made these many times. I place the dough in the freezer between two sheets of parchment paper and then roll them out with the parchment paper in place so that dough doesn't stick to the rolling pin. I also use butter, because I'm not a big fan of baking with margarine. I don't have a food processor, so I use a nut chopper and mix the rest of the filling by hand. They are fast and easy to make and delicious with coffee.

Made these to use up some cottage cheese that was on the edge. I processed the cottage cheese first. Used butter (its all I had). Cut each dough into 12 wedges for easier handling. They were out of this world.

This recipe was easy and very good. I didn't grease the pan, however, and it was nearly impossible to clean. It was as if the brown sugar was permanent glue. Did I do something wrong? If I make the recipe again, I'll either grease the pan or put foil or parchment paper down.

I found this recipe while looking for a quick cookie that I already had ingredients for. This turned out fantastic. Got rave reviews at the social I took it to. It was easy and not very time consuming. Have definiteyl added to my recipe box.

This was an easy recipe. First time making these also. Taste wise they are pretty good. Nothing to go ooh ah over but not bad. Would make them again just because they were so simple to make. Didn't have any problems with the dough or the filling. I just sprinkled the filling around and then proceeded to roll up each one.

We made 5 of the 6 rugelach recipes on this site. The margarine gave this one a beautiful deep yellow color, the cottage cheese made the dough (and final product) extremely soft (roll fast!), the smooth brown paste filling was very easy to spread, and they assembled beautifully. Taste-wise, this one may not be as traditional as the other rugelach recipes, but I personally really like the brown sugar filling.

This is a great recipe, one of those things that lends itself well to improvisation. I was trying to use up some sour cream that was heading south, so I substituted it for cottage cheese -- worked great and produced a very flaky cookie dough. My only issue is that I found the filling very difficult to spread as a paste (the dough is stretchy and soft, and I just couldn't get the filling to spread evenly although that didn't end up affecting the resulting cookies). I might try to add less butter to the filling next time around and see what happens.

This is a WONDERFUL cookie. We do not buy cookies in our house... they all come from my Kitchen Aid mixer so we have tried quite a few. They are moist and buttery and the filling can be ground fine for those who don't like nuts (ie. the kids) or coarse.

A nice dough (I put the cottage cheese in the blender first) -- be sure to keep dusting w/flour as you roll it out, though, or it will stick and they'll be hard to ruggle! i think another time, i'll just roll it into a rectangle and roll jelly-roll fashion, then slice.
