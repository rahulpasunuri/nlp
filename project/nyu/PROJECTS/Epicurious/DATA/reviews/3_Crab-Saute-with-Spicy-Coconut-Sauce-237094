Crunched for time, I changed this up a fair bit, but it was still great-- very flavorful! I added the garlic to the coconut milk sauce, skipped the turmeric, and substituted cayenne, five spice powder, and used already ground coriander and cumin, and skipped the shredded coconut. I served with rice, chopped cilantro & green onions. It was great! I then made stock with the crab shells, and turned leftovers into a spicy Asian soup.

I must admit I was skeptical about this recipe at first. I never took the time to smear the crab with garlic and turmeric, but incorporated those ingredients into the sauce. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as described. This really was so easy, and the coconut and spices played off the sweetness of the crab beautifully. I served it with Japanese sticky rice and a chardonnay. Delicious. Totally cook time was less than an hour, which will make this a work week staple.
