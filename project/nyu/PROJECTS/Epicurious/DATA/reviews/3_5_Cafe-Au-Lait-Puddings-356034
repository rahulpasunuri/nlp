Very easy recipe with a smooth texture and not too sweet; made with 1 Tbsp coffee + 1.5 Tbsp cocoa + a little dark chocolate - nice complement of flavours with the vanilla whipped cream and sprinkle of cinnamon.

It was a great recipe and turned out very well! Instead of using coffee granules we decided to use Nestles Chocolate Powder and It was fabulous.:)

I made this from the Nov. 09 issue of Gourmet before finding it online here... so I didn't get a chance to read the comments first. After making it (and then looking it up online), I would totally agree with the other reviewers who suggested reducing the instant coffee to 2 Tb. It was way too strong and even a little bitter with 3 Tb. Points for presentation, though. Worth trying again with less coffee granules next time.

I used 2 tbsp of coffee instead of 3 and it was delicious!! All guests ate the puddings, including those who claimed they "did not like coffee." Will definitely make again and again.

I made it with decaffeinated crystals. Easy to make, and a nice switch for everyday. Perhaps if I add cocoa as suggested, it might give it more taste layers. For a special occasion though, I can think of many other recipes I'd rather serve.

I typically don't like coffee desserts, but I made this for a birthday party and they devoured it. I added 1 Tablespoon of dark cocoa (the kind without the sugar), and I used decaffeinated Folger's Crystals. I was concerned about the recipe not making enough for big eaters, so I added 1/2 cup of half and half to the milk. I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla to the whipped cream also. This was divine and everyone raved - they were putting their fingers in the ramekins to get the last little bit out!

This was just okay - nothing special. I didn't care for it at all (the coffee taste was too strong for me), but my husband liked it. I thought that it would be a nice, light dessert to serve to guests, but next time I will make something nicer. There are a lot of other desserts that don't take much time and would make a better impression.

This was simple and easy - used powdered espresso instant coffee in the qty called for and it was perfect. I had 1% so added a bit of cream - was light and delicious with the whipped cream on top. Will definitely make again (and again!).

This is a terrific coffee dessert and simple to make. I agree with the first reviewer that it was a bit strong so I would drop the amount of instant coffee (I used instant espresso powder) to 2 Tbsp. It must be eaten with the whipped cream!

This was definitely quick and easy, but a little strong. It may have been the instant coffee I was using. Also, I used 1% milk (didn't have whole on hand). Still, it had a great texture-- be sure to remember the whipped cream and cinnamon, that's what really made it great!
