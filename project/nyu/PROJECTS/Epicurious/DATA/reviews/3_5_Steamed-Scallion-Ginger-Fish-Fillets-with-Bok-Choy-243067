This was super easy and really delicious. I've always been a fan of of this style of fish but didn't think to make it at home. I saw the video that went along with the recipe and found it very easy to follow. I dind't have any rice wine but substituted regular white wine instead. It was great served with the accompanying Bok Choy side dish and steamed white Jasmine rice. Perfect for a weeknight dinner.

Yum! I've never steamed fish before but this was easy and fast. And it turned out great! I'll definitely be making it again!

I made it with Sea Bass instead, which needed to steam for about 8-10 minutes and had to grind my own 5 spice (cinnamon, ground clove, 'red pepper' as I didn't have the Asian one, anise and fennel seeds) in coffee grinder. That made the marinade even fresher tasting. It was excellent. It would have been very useful to assemble ingredients in advance as it somehow took FOREVER and was difficult to read directions, entertain and cook at same time. Didn't quite catch that the scallions were to be julienned so I just kind of hacked them to death as I was already way behind, but otherwise pretty true to recipe. This will be repeated again and again (with prep done in advance of course).

I'm a child of Cantonese immigrants: This is a recipe that stays pretty true to its roots. However, I've never seen my parents nor my relatives include alcohol on fish. I've never had it at restaurants either. Somehow, I think the rice wine addition is more of a twist to appease modern palates than a true Cantonese tradition. Also, tradition recommends using whole fish. Everyone I know tries to use whole fish - uncut and unscathed. It gives you the best flavor, and it makes eating a lot more fun! Note: The hot oil that sears the fish at the end is the BEST part! Do NOT skimp on this step! You can skip the 5-spice powder and even the scallions, but never skip the hot oil step.

Watching the video demonstrates how easy this meal is (with the bok choy). Timing of the steaming was perfect. If you cannot find rice wine use Sherry. Only thing I would change is use of sesame oil at the end vs vegetable oil to lend more aromatics. Husband loved the fish and the bok choy. Will definitely make again.

This is a solid recipe and pretty simple to make. We used tilapia and cut the marinade in half (there's way too much if you follow the recipe). The fish was is lightly flavored. It's intentional that the 5 spice doesn't stand out over the wine and soy sauce. The flavors are supposed to be balanced and fairly subtle, and it's delicious. Great with the bok choy.

This was truly awful. I love the flavors of five-spice powder, but all that light soy sauce and rice wine overpowered it. And the majority of it was to be set aside to "finish the dish", but it wasn't specified how much to use, or when exactly to use it (I didn't use it to finish, it was strong enough to begin with). What a waste of soy sauce, rice wine, and innocent fish. However, the accompanying stir-fried baby bok choy was excellent.

Delicate and delicious fish. The directions for this recipe are poorly written, I suggest you watch the video. You could probably reduce the amount of oil drizzled on at the finish if you would like to lighten it a bit. We made a double batch of bok choy b/c we like veggies.

This is a fabulous, flavorful, healthy recipe! Made it last night for dinner, and had absolutely no leftovers. Left off the vegetable oil at the end to cut back on fat, and did not miss it. This is going to be a regular in our house...

Simple and delicious, I have made this dish several times and it always turns out very well. I use a two level steamer basket and steam mushrooms on the lower level and the fish on the top.

Excellent even though I wasn't true to the recipe. I used Chilean Sea Bass (Thin fillet) japanese rice wine vinegar, substituted a mix of spices for 5 spice as I was sort of unprepared. The flavors permeated the fish and the steaming (pasta pot) took longer with the dense fish. This was so good my hubby want me to make again tonight! Splendid Results! Loved it!

Good. i cook a similar dish to this at home, except i don't use five-spice powder, and definitely one should use a splash of sesame oil at the end instead of just plain oil ---this makes for a great oriental flavor. i also typically add some fresh coriander, and if u don't want to bother with a steamer or oven, try placing the marinated fish in foil, then popping it in the toaster to cook.

Really good. I cooked followed the recipe with the exception of the Shaohsing rice wine, I couldn't find any so I substituted Gin. It worked great. You need to have a light touch with the Five Spices but they and a very interesting flavor to the dish. I usually grill fish outside but this is a good fish recipe for a cold, rainy day

This was quite good. I cooked it about 5 1/2 minutes. I think it took longer because I used a bit more marinade. I also substituted sherry for the rice wine, and used hot sesame oil instead of vegetable oil. Sole was my fish of choice.

I cook a similar dish all the time and people love it. But I gave this recipe 3 forks because I don't particularly like the flavor of five spice and never use it. I also place the fish in a baking dish and cook it in the oven at 350F. The results are the same but more convenient than steaming.
