This bread has a hearty texture with a moist, springy crumb that I enjoyed. However, if I were to make this again, I would increase the amount of maple extract. Toasting the bread really brings out the flavour. I don't agree with the suggestion this bread pairs well with peanut butter and jelly because the richness of the p.b. overwhelms the delicate flavour of the bread. I would recommend eating it with some tangy cream cheese or some good aged cheddar instead.

Very good and very easy. Even my husband, who doesn't like whole grain breads, likes this. I omitted the maple extract (didn't have any). After my first loaf, I upped the salt to 1.5 tsp which worked better for my taste. Next time I will try it in a bread machine.

I loved this bread. It makes a huge loaf that everyone in my family loved.

Though my loaf didn't turn out perfectly, I did think this recipe was SUPER easy and quite delicious. I don't think I did a good job of kneading and I should've baked it a little longer as I got a big hole in the middle of the loaf and some of the dough was undercooked and mushy. But I'm definitely going to try again. It's really great toasted!

I love this recipe. I subsitute Lyle's Golden Syrup and 1 tablespoon maple flavoring. I've also made it with out the maple flavoring and added cinnamon to the dough and mixed in cinnamon chips at the second kneading. Next time I make the cinnamon version I'm also adding raisins.

I love this recipe. Very simple and great flavor. I baked it about 25 minutes. I tried the thermometer but it never reached 180. Maybe mine was broken.I will definitely make this again

Easy and delicious. I've made it 4 times already and am getting ready to bake another loaf. My sons (a picky toddler and pre-schooler) eat it non-stop until it's gone. I didn't have maple extract so I used extra Grade B maple syrup (just shy of 1/2 cup total), which seems to work just fine.

Just made this today and it was so good! Really not that difficult, and comes out very thick and hearty, thanks to the wheat flour. Definitely a make-again!

bread is okay, but nothing exceptional, although it did smell great while it was cooking... it was a very dense bread for me
