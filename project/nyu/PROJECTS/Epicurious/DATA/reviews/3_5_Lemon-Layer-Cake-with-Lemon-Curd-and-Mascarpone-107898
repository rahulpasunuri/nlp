Forgot to mention that the curd definitely needed to be strained. I also had to do a crumb coating on the frosting and let it set before applying more. Too many crumbs got mixed up in the frosting.

Just made this for Easter and it was such a hit! I followed it to the tee and there was the perfect amount of curd and frosting. I made the cake and curd one day and then made the frosting and decorated the next. The mascarpone frosting was delicious!!

Lovely cake! Just made it for Easter. It sat in the fridge over night, then sat out for 4 hours before eating. The frosting held up wonderfully, it cut like a dream and most importantly, tasted great! The curd needed strained, as the whites from the eggs got a bit cooked. I prefer to make curd with just the yolks. And frosting the sides was a bit tricky because the cake was crumbly. It could have used a crumb coat, but I made it work. Overall, though, this recipe is definitely a keeper!

I recently made this cake for my manager's birthday. It received rave reviews! I've been asked for the recipe. People were trying to guess all of the filling ingredients! I would recommend people know, the eggs for the cake should be at room temperature prior to whipping the whites. My cakes rose beautifully, and were easy to cut. Will most likely make this again for Easter!

This cake is fabulous! After reading all the reviews, I consolidated a few. 1) Used 2/3 of the frosting is ample 2) Used 1 3/4 cup of lemon curd in between the layers and the rest for frosting 3) REALLY MUST use all the syrup for the cake to be moist and get rid of the eggy smell when the cake just comes out of oven 4) DO NOT OVERWHIP WHIPPING CREAM, watch a video on the correct consistency. I wasted 2 containers of whipping cream :( 5) Watch video on folding egg white and the cake would be really fluffy 6) if you dont have a cake cutter like me, increase batter by 1/3 for easier cutting 7) do lemon curd and cake on first day and the rest on second day, refrigerated cake makes cutting so much easier

This cake was the most beautiful and delicious cake I have ever had, and I amde it myself! That being said it involved quite a few steps and required advance planning and the right equipment. I had no issues with the icing melting, even using a plastic bag for the piping. I also have used this icing as a base for other recipes and used strawberry jam to make a strawberry version for cupcakes for my daughter. Two key things I have found is using a lazy susan to slice the layers in half. They are very thin and if you put the layer on a lazy susan and use your longest carving or bread knife holding the knife in one place and very slowly sliding it through the cake as you turn the cake on the base it works like a charm. Also you have to use the right size pastry tip. The one the recipe requires is large, but makes all the difference. When I tried to use a small plastic one it didn't work well at all.

So sorry - but after reading some of these reviews I just have to step up - Really - substitute boxed cake mix? Really - substitute bottled lemon curd? Are you all nuts? This recipe if followed will come out perfect. Is it a bit involved? Yes. So do it in stages if it is too much for you to do in one day. The recipe explains how to do it. Is it a little pricey - well - maybe, but IT IS FABULOUS, LIGHT, DELICIOUS & IMPRESSIVE. If fast, cheap, and easy is your thing - go pickup a cake a Wal-Mart and quit complaining.

I made this cake for a wedding reception after making several 'test' cakes & playing with dowel rods & stacking. It was quite a bit of work, but in the end, the cake was 3 beautiful tiers. I put each tier in the fridge after filling the layers, and then again after decorating it. I wish I could post a photo! It was stunning. There was enough cake to serve 100, EVERYONE had seconds and the Happy Couple nearly had to fend off guests who wanted the top tier that we had set aside for the couple to take with them. There were 5 small pieces left at the end of the evening. This was on the gulf coast of Florida, it was 90 degrees out, and guests were coming & going from the living area to the pool terrace all evening. The cake held up admirably! Just follow the recipe exactly. I did turn down the temperature of my extra fridge to just above freezing while holding the cake. I will add that I have the KitchenAide standing mixer, and I do believe you need a powerful motor to really beat the eggs/etc to get a good consistency. the cake was moist, the texture just perfect and the lemon curd, marscapone combination unbeatable! If I could give this 10 forks I would ! THIS IS THE BEST CAKE I HAVE EVER MADE!!!!!!!

This cake is amazing! I followed the instructions to a "t" and it came out absolutely perfect. The cake was incredible, the filling was thick, and the flavor was great. The cakes came out so spongy, fluffy, and moist! It frosted beautifully and got rave reviews at our party (only made it home with one slice!). Some people have mentioned thin filling/flat cakes -- I think it's crucial that you beat both the eggs (separated) and the cream long enough to get the right consistency. I beat the egg whites and yolks until they matched the descriptions given. I also turned on the ac (it was hot out) and worked quickly, to ensure nothing would go become. I was super pleased that the frosting held up for two hours, while on display at our party. Flavor-wise -- if you like lemon, you will love this! The simple flavor of the cake/syrup mixes well with the tartness of the of the curd, balanced with the creaminess of the filling.

First, I didn't make this cake...I ate it and OMG was it good! A friend (and a great cook) made this cake for my birthday dinner - she knows I love lemon. It was the best lemon cake that I have ever had. Beautiful cake, light, creamy, lemony....perfect!

I gave the recipe 3 forks for taste. I'd give it 1.5 or 2.0 forks for preparation/turn out. I followed the recipe to the letter. I didn't change one thing. The cakes were too flat to cut horizontally so I just used the two layers. As for the frosting, it was just too runny. It never solidified enough. I put it in the freezer for almost 2 hours and it got somewhat firm and I assembled the cake and put it into the fridge. I checked on it about an hour later and a good amount of the frosting oozed off the the top and ran down the side. The frosting was not firm enough to put into a pastry bag. Perhaps it needs to be mixed with a mixer for some time rather than whisking. Based on the turnout, IF I ever do this again, I'll just put the syrup on the cake, chill, then cut into cubes. Then put the curd and frosting on top in dollops and serve- -maybe with some seasonal berries-- sort of like a shortcake.

Rating: 4
This cake is extraordinarily flavorful and light at the same time. Because so much of the flavor in the layers is provided by the syrup and curd, making this at least two days in advance and refrigerating it is a very good idea. My only trouble was with decorating the top of the cake. The filling/frosting melted so much in the process of using the pastry bag that I finally gave up and decorated with fresh flowers instead. I did put the frosting in the freezer for 20 minutes before using. I think that next time I will try my canvas pastry bag rather than the see-through plastic ones. Perhaps there's a little more insulation with the canvas? No matter. The crowd roared with approval.

My most favorite cake in the world. My daughter and I make it every Easter. I have made shorter versions, When I need a quick version I use a yellow cake mix, bought lemon curd and turn them into cupcakes. My bridge friends love it. I need only half the icing recipe, stuff the cupcakes with lemon curd and away we go.

This cake was a show-stopper, and one of the most beautiful cakes I've ever made. I had only two cartons of marscapone, so that's all I used, and I cut the cream down to 1 2/3 cups, and the sugar for the whipping cream down to 2/3 cup. Everyone loved it, as I did, and I don't even like lemon desserts! Excellent. It is now one of my treasured recipes to pass along to my daughter.

Ugh. Can someone please tell me what I did wrong? I followed instructions exactly and my cakes came out of the oven and they're only 1/2 - 3/4" thick. I'm assuming they should be much lighter and thicker. Not sure if I under/over beat the eggs or what. I'm supposed to serve this on Easter and I think I'm going to have to buy a box mix :(

oh and by the way.. i served this with grapefruit ice cream that I made from scratch. PERFECT pairing!

This cake was incredible. The cake was light and fluffy and insanely moist because of hte syrup (maybe a little too moist?). I actually made grapefruit syrup because I ran out of lemons, but you couldn't really taste any grapefruit. Also, only used 2 containers of marscapone, and the frosting tasted great. You could still taste the fluffy creaminess of the whipped cream. I LOVED this cake. I was quite proud of myself for making it!

Made this cake a few times. First time I used the exact recipe for the cake. Agree with others - dry and eggy. Next time used an old recipe for the cake and eliminated the syrup. Also made 2/3 frosting. Came out much better. Everyone thought it was much better than original recipe.

I have made this cake twice before for Easter -- it was a hit --and will make it again this year. It is incredibly yummy and is quite impressive. This year I'll use store-bought lemon curd to cut down on a bit of the work - it won't make much difference. And though I like the idea of using Duncan Hines Lemon cake mix, I think the lemon syrup brushed on this super moist cake makes it really special. As always, I'll add some sugared, purple violas for the finishing touch! This recipe is a keeper!

Rating: 4
This cake is fantastic. Everyone in my family always asks for it, even my granddaughters who are 5 and 8. Anyone who says this cake is bland must be doing something wrong... To make your life easier you can use Duncan Hines lemon cake mix and add the zest of two lemons. Do make the lemon curd, it is delicious and so easy to make. I usually do the cake in steps. One day I will make the lemon curd, lemon syrup and bake the cake, then I cool the cake, and wrap well with saran and freeze. the next day I will put it together. For those of you who can't find mascarpone cheese in their area, or find it too expensive I have a great alternative - In place of 1 8oz container of mascarpone you can use 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese 1/4 cup heavy whipping cream 2 1/2 tablespoons sour cream I triple this recipe and use it in place of the mascarpone cheese, after creaming it all together I measure what I need, and then continue to make the filling and frosting. If you find that it make too much, freeze it and use it another time. This cake can be made ahead of time and frozen, just defrost in the refrigerator.

Rating: 4
In order to make this recipe quicker, I use Duncan Hines classic yellow cake mix, then add MyTFine lemon pudding to it. Use the kind that is cooked, but just add the powder to the cake mix. Otherwise, the filling, frosting, syrup and lemon curd is done the same way. Makes for a much more lemony cake. Also add a bit of lemon extract to the curd/cheese mixture.

Inspiration for a Lemon/Coconut Roll. Made a basic sponge and doused it with a Limoncello syrup, then rolled it up. Combined the curd with the mascarpone and whipped cream and used it as a filling and frosting. Topped the frosted roll with shredded coconut and used this as a centerpiece for the Holiday Dessert Buffet.

Made this cake according to the recipe, and my guests RAVED about it! Next time I would make the following changes: due to the amount of time involved I would just use store bought lemon curd and lemon juice. I would also reduce the frosting ingredients by 30%. (I ended up with a lot of extra frosting, which was too bad since mascarpone cheese is pretty spendy.) I'd also add fresh raspberries or candied flowers as a garnish to give it a bit of color.

I made this cake as directed, with the exception of using limes instead of lemons. I also added lime zest to the syrup and simmered it for 10 minutes before straining the zest out. The cake was very well received. There was about 20oz extra frosting. Since I think tartness is a good thing I'd be inclined reduce the frosting without reducing the curd. I'd also be tempted to substitute neufchatel for the marscapone.

it's a wonderful recipe. a few tricks will help to keep the cake from being dry. watch the video on how to cream butter and sugar - and check a lot of basic things - like the oven temperature and keep the rack in the middle of the oven. double the amount of syrup, and that can help the recipe from having a dry cake as well. I usually double the syrup, frosting and filling. I'm left with some extra frosting which I eat while hiding somewhere. It is a fabulous recipe and will make you look like an expert baker.

absolutely fabulous dahling... you can be the cake snob from hades with this recipe. Everyone will die for the cake too. I double the amount of the syrup, the filling and the frosting - the tiny little bit of cake left is just something to hold the luscious concoction of saturated fat, sugar, and fresh lemon juice. btw - don't even think of using anything other than fresh squeezed lemon juice - and don't use margarine or lite cheese or any of that stupid stuff.

I substituted the buttermilk cake (double recipe) from the mascarpone cake with sherried berries on this site. I have consistently good results with that cake and it's easy to cut the layers in half. I had trouble with the lemon curd so I had to cook it further the next day and add a bit of cornstarch. I think you should have it at 160 degrees for a while. One thing - if you want really pretty rosettes, I think you'd have to stick the pastry bag in the freezer here and there. The heat from your hand will melt this frosting as you decorate.

Rating: 0
My trick for cutting cakes into thin layers: Refrigerate for 30 mins or freeze for 20 -- slices very easily. Must use a serrated bread knife, though. Also if layers break, you can piece them back on, like a puzzle, over the filling. Have done many times, including wedding cakes. Once the whole thing is frosted and set, no one could ever tell. What happens in the kitchen stays in the kitchen!

Loved the frosting and the curd, but cake was dry and tough and tasteless. Seemed like way too much flour. And it was hard to incorporate that much flour by "folding." Probably just me, cause other reviewers didn't seem to have this problem. Also, the recipe yields way too much frosting... so now it's just me and a spoon on a slow road to ruin...

This cake works very well if you follow the recipe exactly. I used gluten free self raising flour and made the cake gluten free and it still turned out perfectly well...in fact nobody could even tell it was gluten free. I made in an 8" cake tin and I think better than 9" tin. I substituted one packet mascarpone for light cream cheese. Just fold in egg white as little as possible. Next time I would make half the filling mixture ..I had enough to do a whole other cake left over! Lemon Curd is delicious and I would make it by itself. I used all the lemon syrup which made it very lemony..butlovers of lemon liked that. If you don't love lemon..cut syrup back. It turned out just like the picture.

Best cake I've ever had--and everyone who has tried it agrees. Quick tip: if the frosting is too thin (as mine was the first time I made it), just put it back in the mixer for about 30 seconds (putting it back in the refrigerator, even for a couple of hours, didn't work for me).

I agreed with other reviewers about the difficulties with cutting each cake in half and ending up with skinny, flimsy layers. But other than that, I think this cake turned out beautifully. I added raspberres between the curd and frosting in each layer and arranged them on top instead of piping icing. Plus, we're not huge fans of frosting, so I cut the recipe down to 1 c cream, 8 oz mascarpone, 8 oz curd and it was exactly the right amount. If I made it again I might make another 1/2 recipe and try to bake thicker cakes. It would be easier to slice in half, and make for a taller cake.

This cake was not so much a lot of work, but a lot of stages -- so, yes, a lot of work too. Also, somewhat expensive. I was a little disappointed. The cake was kind of dry. Otherwise it was very lemony and creamy. I had higher hopes than this cake put out.

Everyone raved about this cake! I was concerned, after reading other "eggy" reviews, so I used the 3 leftover whites from the curd recipe to sub for two eggs for the cake part of the recipe.

My mother-in-law loves lemon cake and said it was the best she ever had!

I had high hopes for this cake but they were disappointed. As is, I would not make this cake again. The texture was great, moist cake but the flavor was too intense. It tasted like lemon concentrate was injected into the cake. The frosting came out with soft peaks so it was challenging to coat the cake. If you do any piping make sure to regrigerate the cake until you serve it. I read all the other comments, made the recommended changes and it still had some problems. The cake mixture is thick and tacky and it's hard to know if you have divided the batter evenly between the pans. The cakes will bake to 1/2"-3/4"thick so it's hard to split them. They bake like large crumpets. I would make the cake again but with several changes. I would reduce the lemon juice by 50% or more. I would increase the cake batter by 1/3, increase cheese qty by 1/4 c. and put the icing in the freezer until firm to ice cake.

I used the lemon curd and a modified verison of the frosting of this recipe and it was fantastic! i have never made lemon curd and this was easy and absolutely delicious - tart,tangy, sweet and bright. i would recommend use of the thermometer. if i didnt have one, it would have been difficult to know when to remove the curd from the sauce pan. the curd was very frothy during preparation but that didn't effect the end result. the curd is so tasty i couldn't top eating it straight out of the bowl. scary! i made the frosting with 2 8 oz packages of neufchatel cream cheese, mainly due to cost. i also cut the sugar in the whipped cream to just less than 1/2 cup and it worked out fine. i made the cake from the recipe below: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Lemon-Ginger-Cake-with-Lemon-Cream-Cheese-Frosting-448 i would definitely use the curd/frosting again. making this cake again for mothers day.

I made this for my Mother's 87th birthday on Easter. It was wonderful, the cake is moist and fluffy-light, this is one of the best lemon curd recipes I've come across (will make it my go-to now) and the marscapone frosting was delicious, not cloyingly sweet either. Marscapone is expensive, using three containers at roughly $4 apiece makes this "special occasion" frosting to be sure. I lean towards alittle weightier frosting, like traditional cream cheese. This was lighter textured, but not something I'd hold against it. Perhaps next time I'd substitute 1/2 cream cheese for the marscapone. This would lessen some of the fatty flavor of the marscapone (that could be brand specific),cost of making it and give it alittle less butter texture. I will make this again for sure!

It was one of the best cakes I ever made. I used a lemon cake mix and purchased two jars of lemon curd but I still felt that it was very labor intensive. I had plenty of "frosting" left over so I froze it and plan on using it in a lemon jelly roll with the lemon syrup and lemon curd

I made this cake for an Easter get together with friends of all ages. I made it exactly per the recipe and it was absolutely outstanding. Even those who have passed up desserts before as "not having a sweet tooth" gobbled it all up. Even the few leftovers were delicious the next day. I think the sponge cake that the recipes calls for is essential to soak up the delicious goodness of the lemon syrup. Any light fluffy cake would most likely be mushy. The "icing" is to die for. I would consider making it alone again for another kind of cake. I did find that after folding the curd, mascarpone and whipped cream together that it was a bit soft, so I just beat it a bit more in the mixer and it held up quite well while frosting the cake. Be careful, however, not to overbeat. I think this will become our new family birthday cake recipe.

Just delicious and really beautiful! This is not one of those cakes that looks pretty on the website, but only so so when you make it at home. A few tips, 1) Undermix the batter a little, so as to make sure it doesn't deflate (everything will smooth out while baking), 2) After releasing the cakes, pop them in the freezer for about 15 minutes (really helps when splitting), 3) Before making the whipped cream, stick everything (cream, mixer, bowl) in the freezer for 10 minutes, and finally, 4) As soon as you make the frosting/filling, stick it in the fridge while getting everything else together and measured. Used good store-bought lemon curd (two 11.5 oz. bottles - one for filling and one for layering). Yum!

This recipe is absolutely magnificent! I have only made it once, but after so many compliments I know I will include it in my future cooking repertoire. I have a few suggestions: 1) Have the cake sit for 1-2 days before serving in the fridge. 2) Maybe use smaller round pans (instead of 9" round), so the layers are thicker and the cake sits taller A final note to everyone who is not using fresh lemon juice or lemon curd - you are selling the recipe short! It's more work, but worth the effort...

Definitely one of the most memorable lemon cakes I have had/made. Although, I totally cheated by using a lemon box cake mix, and used purchased lemon curd. I mixed lemon curd and marscapone, whipped the cream with a little bit of powder sugar, mixed half the lemon curd mixture in whip cream, and used other half as filling. I was so amazed at how perfect the frosting turns out, it hold up quite well. I want to experiment with the cheese/ whip cream mix, and try other flavors, and use on other cakes.

I've made this cake several times and people absolutely love it! I've also used to lemon curd recipe for other treats that I've made! The frosting recipe makes far more than I need (I frost but don't decorate the top) so I've made 2/3 of it and still had plenty! My only complaint is that the cake has a bit of an egg taste, so I've added extra lemon juice to the soaking syrup to offset that a bit!

I made the curd and frosting from this recipe but not the cake layers. After reading other people's reviews I decided to go with a method I was more familiar with and therefore chose this recipe for the cake: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/100975 With that out of the way, let me say that this is a fabulous cake. The marscarpone cheese frosting is subtle, not too sweet, with a little bit of tang (but not super tangy like a cream cheese frosting). I did have trouble keeping the frosting set up, it seemed like as soon as it warmed a little, it started to spread. But I just kept it in the fridge as long as possible until serving time. Maybe not the prettiest frosting to work with but really delicious.

Excellent. Be sure to follow the instructions exactly -- to the point of measuring the temperature of the lemon curd and measuring how much curd, filling, and syrup to put on each layer. I inadvertently skimped on the syrup on the first two layers and that made a difference. I thought the top was easy to pipe out.

I will be making this cake for the second time next week. I made it for a baby shower and everyone loved it. However, instead of 3 containers of mascarpone I used 1 mascarpone and 2 containers of ricotta that had been blended to a smoother consistency.

Great cake overall- not that complicated at all, though a number of steps, Followed other's advice and used 8" pans- worked well- layers were easy to split. Frosting is very easy and foolproof, but would cut back on the mascarpone and sugar and increase whipping cream next time.

I made this cake for a birthday cake and it was awesome. Very easy to make especially if you cheat and buy the curd although it was not hard to make either.I recommend making it in 8" pans it makes it thicker and easier to divide, cook it about 10 minutes longer.

I would have enjoyed it more if I had doubled the cake or halved the filling/frosting.

This cake was fabulous! I made it for Easter as I wanted to finish the meal with something light and refreshing...it won rave reviews from all my guests. To make things a little easier, I used a good quality purchased lemon curd rather than making my own. Delish!

To the cook from TX-yes, you need to read the whole recipe-it says to reserve one cup curd for spreading between the layers.

To the previous reviewer...the recipe states to save 1 cup of lemon curd to put on the layers, the rest to mix in with the cheese and whipped cream. The above instructions are in the "lemon curd" instructions. Read your recipe carefully and take cooking classes!

After reading all of the previous recipe reviews this is what I suggest: If you follow the directions exactly you will end up with a beautiful, delicious cake. If the batter is properly folded without stirring you will have layers that rise up nicely. The lemon sugar syrup adds moistness and an additional lemon flavor. As far as the frosting goes...yes the recipe yields a lot. Use it! I used 11/2 cups in between layers and used the rest on the outside of the cake. For those of you who complained about the fat content...you are on the wrong website. Try Cooking Light.

Am I the only one that can't read? I am baffled by the lemon curd being mixed into the marscapone, then folded into the whipping cream. When time to layer cake, it says to add a layer of curd. I didn't have any curd to layer. It was already mixed into the cream!!!!!!! So, my cake wasn't lemony enough. One more confession, I didn't have time to make the curd, so I purchased a jar of Dickinson's lemon curd. Might not have been enough. I will try this again making sure there is enough lemon flavor.

I made this cake for our Easter party to rave reviews! I didn't have the 24 oz of marscarpone, so instead mixed 8 oz of marscarpone with 8 oz of reg. cream cheese. I also used another similar lemon curd recipe that I'd used many times before. I was afraid that the added slices of strawberries between layers would make this cake a little slippery, but I must say, the cake turned out fabulously. It didn't even fall apart when I sliced it to serve. Yes, it's a lot of steps, and maybe not for a novice, but it's worth the effort.

I made this cake to rave reviews for Christmas. Although it is time consuming the end result is well worth the efforts. My family enjoyed it so much that I made it for Easter, only this time I used oranges instead of lemons and the end result was awesome.

Excellent cake, although not a breeze to make. I used 3 8-inch pans instead of 2 9-inch, mostly so I wouldn't have to split them. It seemed like there was too much syrup, and I didn't want to make the cake mushy, so I didn't use all of it - I probably should have. Also, I ran into the problem of spreading the curd onto the layer, then trying to spread the mascarpone/whipped cream filling onto it, and it just slipped all around, and threatened to squeeze out between the layers when another was one added; so, I spread the curd on the top of the lower layer, and the filling on the bottom of the upper layer, and left about 3/4" all around the edges. I also used 4 wooden skewers as mini-columns to keep the layers from sliding back and forth, and refrigerated it overnight. Well worth it, however.

I made this recipe using a good quality white cake mix and served it at a bridal shower. Rave reviews! The mascarpone/whipped cream/lemon curd mixture is fabulous. My son was trying to eat it out of the bowl as I was icing the cake. I think this would be a wonderful cake for a small, elegant wedding.

Some loved it, some only liked it.The curd was delicious and perfect, but the cake layers were slightly weird, esp when first out of the oven. The they were light and fluffy alright, but they smelled very VERY strongly of egg - like two omlets. The smell was masked by the curd and the syrup and the icing, but they texture was weirdly spongy. It was pretty though.

This recipe did wonders for my reputation as a baker! I carefully followed the good advice from the other reviews, being very careful to only bake the layers on the driest day I could find (in Houston, no less!) and it came out beautifully. I used Meyer lemons instead of regular ones and the effect was incredible. Anyone looking for a worthy baking challenge should give this a spin - just make sure you pay attention and you'll do fine.

One more note: this cake serves more than twelve unless you have a bunch of extreme gluttons. We served twelve, with several people having two pieces, and still had cake to send home and eat for two days. It is rich!

This is not a recipe for beginners who are unsure and have no technique. If you are an accomplished cooked and you want a knockout, high-fat, high-impact cake, this will do it. I only gave it two forks because the filling has too much fat for my taste--both whipped cream and mascarpone, and it coated my tongue, which I don't like. However, everyone loved the cake and raved about it, so I sent it home in doggie bags with them. Here's what you need to know: the filling in the layers requires 4, count them, 4 preparations: the syrup, the lemon curd, the lemon curd and mascarpone, and the whipped cream. It is time consuming and gets a lot of bowls dirty, but it is not difficult, as I said, if you have the technique. Follow the directions exactly, and do not take short cuts or think that something doesn't matter. It does. When you fold the parts together, fold from the bottom over the top in big, sweeping motions. The cake rose fine, and wasn't dry. I gave up on the rosettes after two rows because my arm and hand were in spasm, but that was a function of the toy tool I had. It convinced me to buy a real tool for frosting. Anyway, this is an impressive cake that everyone will comment on, but it may not be the one you turn to when you want something you can make and eat every day. You can make it the same day, BTW, but you must start early, like by 9:00 a.m. to be ready to serve it by 7:00 and give it the 6 hour chill time.

Eating this cake is like eating a lemon cloud. It isn't difficult to make though it is time consuming, but it is truly delicious. My favorite cake

Rating: 2
The flavor of this cake is good but the recipe appears to be flawed. The lemon curd has the consistency of water and the frosting melts too easily - need to refrigerate for awhile before you attempt to spread. Not sure of the purpose of the syrup but it too is waterlike in consistency which is a concern - why soak a cake and make it mushy?! The flavors are very good but need to find another lemon curd (the Wedding cake curd at Bon Appetit works) and refrigerate the icing for a day or so before decorating.

I've made this twice. The first time I used the recipe exactly. Found it made way too much frosting and the cake was too 'eggy'. This time made 1/3 less frosting but used all the lemon curd. Spread the extra between the layers. Found a similar recipe and used that cake recipe instead. It used egg whites only. Much better. Would give it 4 forks making it this way.

This cake is awesome though very time consuming to make. The lemon curd in this recipe is too watery - I made another one off this site (also Bon Appetit) and scale it down to match the ingredients called for in this recipe. The one that I used was the one that called for corn starch too and you cook it over direct heat unlike this recipe - over water. It came out great.

It was okay. Too sweet though, and the marscapone frosting was not good. Too much of it entirely. Not worth the bother and won't be baking this again.

This cake is AWESOME!!! It has quickly become my family's favorite! the cake part is tempermental, i agree, but if you follow their directions, it works out fine. really beat the egg and sugar and add meringue just like you would any other recipe-very carefully so as not to deflate.

I made this cake back in October for my niece's 1st birthday(all adults attended) and everyone is still raving over it!! It was absolutely delicious. It takes a lot of time but well worth making for a special occassion!! Don't over mix the 2 batters or else your cake will be flat, just lightly fold the batters together. Good luck!!

As a few others have said, this is an EXTREMELY tempermental cake recipe and even though I was very careful, it still came out flat. The curd was delicious, so I think I may make it with another cake next time. I would suggest to those considering this recipe to just go for a different cake recipe from the start and still use the lemon curd recipe. You've been warned!!! :)

I've made this cake about 5 times. Not everytime came out as I would have pleased. But they were learning experiences. The first 3 times, came out great...although I did have a lot extra frosting, better than not having enough. The last 2 times however, the cake came out flat. I wasn't really sure what went wrong, considering I made it exactly the same way I made it before. It wasn't until someone mentioned to me that you want to avoid beating egg whites on a rainy day...and it just so happened to be rainy days that I attempted to make the cakes. Just check out the forecast before you make it...hehe!

I have made this cake numerous times and it always gets raves. It is a little daunting because the layers are so thin and light. Each time I've made it, I worry that it won't work--but it always does. It comes out light and delicious and I LOVE the combination of frosting and lemon curd. I double the lemon curd, so I can be generous with it between layers and so that I'll have some left over for other uses; and you could probably make 1/2 the mascarpone filling and have plenty, but my husband likes those leftovers, too! As the pastry chef's review said: pay attention to the egg whites and this cake ends up light and delicious. I have a metal cake decorating-thing (rather than a pastry bag), which makes the frosting so easy and I usually put thin lemon slices and fresh daisies on the plate around the cake-- it's a beautiful spring presentation and not that difficult at all.

The cake was very good & lemony. If you are not a big lemon fan, I would not suggest. I loved the icing & the curd, but wasn't thrilled with the cake. It was a little denser & not quite as moist as I like cake. Will definitely try again to make sure I didn't deflate the batter, but the curd & icing is a keeper for sure!

The lemon curd and the frosting/filling was good, but the cake itself was very dry. I made a full recipe and used one 12-inch round pan, instead of (2) 9-inch pans. I don't know if this contributed to the dry cake problem. It soaked for 2 days...maybe I didn't use enough syrup?

My husband loves this cake -- such an intoxicating combination of rich but light/lemony but sweet. It has become his official birthday cake. I find it a lot of work but don't care; plenty worth it. MAKE SURE you give the mascarpone frosting plenty of time to chill, otherwise you're likely to have trouble piping it through the pastry bag and it won't look as pretty.

I made this cake for a dinner party I was having with friends. Everyone LOVED it. It was the perfect finish to our meal of BBQed leg of lamb, roasted asparagus and new potatoes. I followed the recipe to the letter and did not have any problems with it, although I ran short on the lemon curd. Next time I will add some grated rind to the curd and the syrup. I piped frosting all over the cake instead of just on the top since the recipe made so much. Garnished with fresh flowers, it was beautiful and I was proud of it!

THe filling/frosting of mascarpone was not good! It wasn't sweet, it whipped up almost curdled. I can probably account human error on some, but the proportions must be off b/c the mascarpone part was bland and not tasty.

I have never used mascarpone before. Does it give the frosting a sour milk taste? My frosting was sour milk flavored with a hint of lemon, tasted terrible. Is it supposed to have a sour milk flavor or did I have some bad mascarpone or cream? Everyone raves about the frosting so I assume something went wrong with mine. This is not a difficult cake to make but it does take time and it's pretty expensive.

I used 8-inch cake pans and doubled the cake better recipe, since the cakes deflated and came out really thin (but excellent). Used 5 layers for the cake, and then used the leftover cake layer and frosting in a tiramisu/trifle with sherry and a ton of blueberris and strawberries. Yummy!

I had the best time making this cake! I never thought it was labor intensive at all. The most fun was making the cake batter; it was so fluffy! And it all tasted wonderful. Even my husband who cares nothing about cake liked it, mainly because it was so light. The recipe calls for 24 oz. of Mascarpone; I had only 16 oz. and it was fine. Thank you to the pastry chef who passed on some valuable pointers.

Made this cake recently for a wedding cake. I read all of the reviews, and as a pastry chef, thought I would try to answer some previous questions. The cake is a type of traditional biscuit, which means that it is meant to be on the dry side and gets is moisture from the soaking syrup. The texture/moistness is going to be different from the usual layer cake. The cake gets is rising power from the egg whites, it is essential that they are whisked firmly and not deflated during the folding of the batter. This cake is very light and spongy, any denseness is most likely a result of deflating the batter. Same with the frosting (of which you only need 1/2-2/3 of the recipe, but the extra is great for other uses) - make sure the cream is whipped firmly and carefully folded in, to get the best result when piping. Don't skimp on the chilling! It helps alot in the assembly. I made about 4 recipes of this and built it into 7" wide towers up to 14" tall, for this the chilling is essential. Overall it has great flavor and was a big hit. Happy baking!

This is a fabulous cake. I made this in 2 stages - the lemon curd one day which finally thickened in 17 minutes not 10 and the cake the next day. There was a ton of frosting but after the kids and I stopped sampling the it, we had enough to frost the cake! The frosting is heavenly. This is a time-consuming cake to put together but well worth the effort. I had no problems with anything involving this cake - it came together like a dream, just follow the directions carefully.

This cake is not only time consuming, but it barely tastes so-so! I had the most trouble with the lemon curd, regardless of what I did, it would not reach the required temperature. It also tasted terrible! I followed the recipe exactly. One positive note about the cake, that it looked beautiful! No problems with cake density nor frosting consistency. But I still would not recommend making this cake!

The lemon mascarpone frosting was delicious, but my cakes didn't rise and came out very dense and small. I followed the recipe closely; I think a bit of chemical leavening (baking powder) would have helped.

This is my favorite cake, a perfect balance of sweet and tart. After two years, this cake is now an Easter tradition. It is also the most requested cake from family and friends whenever I offer to make a cake. Sometimes I double the lemon curd and make a batch of scones, spread the curd on the scones and use some of the leftover frosting as a "clotted cream" substitute, and it is wonderful!

This is one of the best cakes I've made. I made it for a birthday party and made a test cake first, so it was much faster and easier the second time around. Definitely worth the effort. Everyone at the lunch (as well as the test-cake eaters)thought it was divine.

Definitely expensive, definitely time consuming, and altogether worth it! I doubled the recipe for a large birthday party and baked it in two 12" square pans. I recommend assembling the night before as the lemon syrup and filling both plumped up the cake very nicely... the leftovers also got better with age. If attempting to double the recipe, definitely triple the curd - there was not enough. I had a little extra mascarpone left, but not enough to warrant making less. A big hit! Will definitely make again someday when I have 2-3 days to spare!

I've made this cake for my husband's birthday and it came out great (no problem with icing consistency), except I really didn't like the taste of the filling. The butter and all the cream made it quite heavy. The second time I've modified the recipe to get a Tiramisu-like cake. It was absolutely gorgeous! I didn't change the cake recipe; for the icing I replaced the lemon juice with milk and didn't use any butter at all, omitted the heavy cream and used 2 pounds mascarpone instead of 3 8-ounce packs. For syrup I used 1 cup strong coffee with 4 tb.s. rum. I served this cake to a crowd of 10 and everyone absolutely loved it! My modified version of this cake would be a regular for special occasions, but I would not make the original cake again. I gave it three forks for the potential.

I've made this cake several times since it was published last year. Every time my guests are very complimentary. I have substituted ricotta in place of the mascarpone on occasion with no problem at all. The cake is wonderfully moist and if you chill it, it travels very well. I have used candied violets as a garnish on each plate at time of service and the presentation is just divine. A wonderful summer dessert!

Rating: 2
Very time consuming, and although the taste is good, it is not worth the effort. I've made much simpler recipes that taste equally good or better. My icing weeped horribly - I perhaps didn't whip the cream enough, although they were stiff peaks. I also used Philly cream cheese instead, so maybe this is why it didn't work?

Rating: 4
I had only 10" pans so I made 20% more cake (1 1/5 of the quantities) to account for this. I however made 1 2/3 of the lemon curd and syrup based on the suggestions of others and to take into account the larger cake but left the amount of frosting as written as it was considered too much for 9" cakes. If I had iced the sides of the cake I would have used all of the frosting. The quantities of lemon curd and syrup were generous and you could see the lemon curd layer easily from the sides as well as when cut. I made it for a summer birthday and everyone commented about how light and delicious it was. I substituted 1 pack of neufchatel cream cheese for one of the 8 ounces of marscapone cheese to cut down on the fat calories and the cost and it was fine. My 10" cake easily served 24 people. I made it over 3 days and put it all together a day in advance. It kept its shape well (I took the advice of someone else and whipped the cream until the peaks were stiff) and was transported for 30 mins in a 75 degree F car with no ill effects to it. I also crystallised the lemon peel to decorate the top and around the base of the cake. It was rich (serve it with coffee) but all plates were cleaned of the international crowd present including several children. A definite winner but you do need a crowd to do it justice. I wonder how it would be if you halved the recipe and made 2 layers of cake instead of four?.

This is a beautiful cake! I made it for mother's day dinner, and it has a certain dramatic panache to it that Mom appreciated. All that lemon and simple syrup make it so moist, too! I do agree that it is a bit time-consuming, but I'm no pastry chef and I pulled it off. I say go for it! FYI, I used mascarpone -- and although I suppose I can imagine that cream cheese would be tasty, too, it strikes me the flavor would be different. Good luck!

I made this cake for Easter dinner a year ago when it was first published on the cover of Bon Appetit. It's really, really lovely, but unless you're a practiced chef do make sure you're ready for an 8-hour project. Either all in one long day or over two days. I also substituted Philadelphia Cream Cheese, as mascarpone might as well be from outer space around this area, and if I recall correctly for part of this I used low-fast cream cheese, and it still turned out very good. Because the cake looks so monotone I wanted to give it some color. A garnish idea: I put strawberries on top, but as I didn't have enough for the whole cake I took 2 and sliced into them vertically from the bottom four or five times each while still leaving them attached to the leaves, and fanned them out before placing them on one side of the top.

Awesome ! Note: This cake requires great care in the making and assembly. However, if done correctly, it's a sure fire winner. I made it for my girlfriends law school grad party, and all of the 20 guests enjoyed greatly. Also, you can make this cake with orange instead of lemon, just a straight change. You may also double all parts, and make in 12" pans. Be careful about the cooking time!

Wonderful cake, made it for a party and got raves. Followed all directions as written except subbed cream cheese for 1/3 of the mascarpone. I wouldn't sub more than that, because it would change the texture too much. Do use all the syrup. The cake smells very eggy when newly baked, but the odor subsides once you've soaked and frosted it.

Mmmm! This is a pucker-perfect lemon cake! It's light-tasting and delicate with a bright lemon flavour, and makes a lovely spring-time dessert. Next time, though, I think I'll make only half the quantity of icing, as I have a lot left over ... in spite of incessantly sampling as I was making it! Mmmm!

This is a fabulous dessert. You don't need to start 2 days ahead of time--the day before is fine. I started in the morning and served it the next afternoon. The lemon curd only needs to chill thoroughly--overnight is not necessary. Beware of the stickiness of the layer cake...it will stick to whatever you lay it down on. Well worth the effort. It was fun building and everyone loved it!!!

This Cake was a complete hit!!! The texture was smooth, lite and not over-bearing but the flavor was wonderful. A few things -- I had a hard time finding Cake flour but used pastry flour instead which based on my research worked perfectly. Second, my rosets were not up to par so I placed some fresh yellow dasies on top of the cake that made it beautiful and added a hint of color. Finally, I actually didn't have much of the filling/frosting left which worried me that I had used too much but it ended up just perfect. Overall, it was a total hit and will be made again. Make sure and give yourself plenty of time to prepare. Enjoy!

Definitely the most beautiful cake presentation I've ever done, and the taste matched up on every count! I followed the recipe exactly, and was concerned about the amount of syrup, so glad to hear other reviewers recommend using it all. I found it much easier to use it all when brushing on the cut (not top) sides of the layers because they are more absorbent. The whipped cream portion could be cut in half though, as it makes TONS. I was impressed at how well I was able to pipe the frosting and used a design similar to the photo, with lemon zest curls and a yellow pansy for garnish. I served it to 14 at a wedding shower - it would make a great wedding cake too!

This was an excellent cake! I followed another reviewer's advice and increased the amount of curd and filling between layers. The lemon curd and mascarpone filling/frosting were incredible. It took me approximately two to two and a half hours, when I found time over the course of two days (make the curd ahead of time!), but well worth it. A huge winner at the Easter table.

This was a very good cake to make and is not too labor intensive if you buy the curd. Made a lot of revisions: baked 3 cake layers (instead of 2 layers cut in half), bought lemon, lime and orange curds from William Sonoma(expensive! can buy it cheaper elsewhere) and divided the syrup recipe by 3 to match the 3 different curds using freshly squeezed lemon, lime and orange juice. Brush all of the syrup onto the cake. I didn't and thought it was a little dry. Made only 1/2 of the frosting recipe by using 8.5 oz mascarpone, 3 oz. cream cheese and 1.5 C whipped cream. Would make a little more next time. Overall, not too sweet, and was very refreshing with the 3 different curds.

At first I was unsure on how the mascarpone cheese would taste being incorporated into this cake recepie, but to my surprise, I have enjoyed this recepie very much and every one that has had the joy of tasting the finishing touches will agree that this is one true to heart. My friends and I thank you.

Simply a delightful recipe with so much room for variation! This was the first cake I ever made, and since there was so much frosting left over, I let my imagination run wild on the decorations. I've made it since then, and always mix the lemon curd into the portion of frosting used for filling. This gives a prettier colour definition when cutting, since separate layers of lemon curd and frosting inside proved nearly impossible. Also, I like to make candied lemon peel and use that both to decorate, and chopped up in the filling.

I hesitated to rate this recipe because I didn't know if it was supposed to taste cheesy or if my mascarpone was old. It didn't have the definition of layers that are shown but was moist and looked beautiful. Will try again using everyone's suggestions. Thanks

I made this cake(with many others) for a family gathering, and was very happy with the outcome. I baked the cake two days before the party and I think the extra time in the fridge helped to set and moisten the cake. As suggested, I used cream cheese and cut down on the filling by a third. I used up all the filling and it turned out perfectly!

I made this for a family birthday party and the adults loved it. I made two-thirds the frosting/filling and it was plenty. (I wasn't about to pay for mascarpone and throw any away!) There was actually too much filling for the thin layers. I had limoncello on hand so I used that for the syrup. No distinct layering as the lemon curd disolved into the cake or blended with the filling - disappointing. Would consider using only lemon curd for the filling - but, would make more - and reduce the amount of frosting to half. I would also consider pouring the cake batter into 3 pans for thicker layer and no splitting.

Rating: 3
After reading the reviews, I was afraid that the cake would be dry, but with the syrup, it was really moist. The cake cut and served beautifully, and tasted like a lemon trifle. I used regular cream cheese instead of mascarpone with no problem, but like other reviewers, didn't use anywhere near all of the frosting. I would cut it in half next time. Overall, this is a make-again!

Rating: 4
I made this for the third time and it was again a hit. It is labor intensive, although I have spread it out over three days and that does minimize the time committment to some degree. This time I made it, I inadvertantly used one more egg white in the cake batter and will do that again--it just seemed a little fuller. Also, I divided the lemon curd a little differently--I used about 1 3/4 c. to put between the layers and the remainder with the frosting/filling. I liked it better that there was more between the layers--it really was prettier. I also put more than 1 c. of the filling between the layers as there is a ton of the frosting/filling and didn't end up with such an excess left over. It is an expensive dessert, but I think it is worth it. Making your own curd cuts down on the cost to some extent. Very light and refreshing for the hot summer.

I made this cake for my mother-in-law for her birthday. VERY labor intensive, but the cake looked absolutely beautiful. However, I was disappointed in the taste.

Absolutely divine - I was very proud of this cake, which I made for the first time for a group of 10 guests at a baby shower. It presented nicely, was easy to serve, went very well with tea. Really nice lemon flavour. One thing I wouldn't bother to do again is actually make the sponge cake - with all the other overpowering lemon flavours,and the way the curd and mascarpone are layered, NOBODY would have noticed if it had been shop bought sponge cake. So that would cut out a lot of work. I would definitely make this again, but probably for an afternoon tea where other cakes were on offer, not for a sole dessert as some people may not like the lemon taste.

Be warned!! The recipe calls for 6 hours of refridgeration. Don't pass this step up. I was in a hurry. I frosted the cake and jumped in the car to go to the BBQ. After the twenty minute ride in the car my cake was a melted/curdled mess. What a shame!

Wow, this was a beautiful, delicious cake. I made an extra layer because I was afraid there wouldn't be enough. Then I had to make more frosting, if you can believe it, and I botched the rosettes so I decorated with pretty pansies instead. Thank goodness I used cream cheese, I would have been put in the poor house!

I made this for my sons birthday cake and wasnt impressed, however I did substitute cream cheese for the marscapone. Everything else I did to a tee. Curd was delish, but didnt come thru much on the cake. The cake tasted a bit too egg-y and at least a third too much frosting. Good but not great.

Rating: 3
Exeellent. Because the recipe for the cake was so time consuming, I used my own basic white cake recipe and cut it into four layers. I the lemon curd and the frosting are what make this cake soooo wonderful and they work really well with a nice simple white cake. I made it for a family get together and it was devoured.

This cake was terrific! It is light, lemony and kept wonderfully. I agree that it is a bit on the expensive side ($15 just for the marscapone), but worth it for a special occasion. It makes way too much frosting so I'd cut it down next time as others suggested. And make sure cream is whipped enough! I can't wait to make it for my husband's surprise birthday party in July!! I can almost taste it now....

RECIPE FOR LIMONCELLO: Zest of 6 lemons 600 milliliters of "Evercleaar" (pure grain alcohol) 600 grams of sugar 1.2 liters of water Put the lemon zest in the alcohol and store it away for 6 days (those glass canisters with rubber gaskets are ideal for this). Make a simple syrup of the sugar and water, let it cool and add it to the lemon-scented alcohol. Then strain out the zest. You can let the mixture age for another few days (I give it a month, at least). I make this at Christmas, bottle it up and give it away. You can make your own orange liqueur that tastes just like Grand Marnier by using inexpensive brandy, orange zest and sugar, but it needs to age at least 4 months.

Made this cake for Father's Day to rave reviews. It looked and tasted great -- light, lovely, lemony and pretty. I would have given it 4 forks, but it took FOREVER to make. Definitely start 2 days ahead if you can. I would double lemon curd recipe next time. (Better yet, to save time, purchase some from Williams-Sonoma or similar!) I topped with candied lemon peel, as suggested by another reviewer, and it really added to both the presentation and the taste. A lovely special occasion cake if you have the time.

I made this for my Mother's 80th birthday party and everyone raved about it. I took a shortcut and used a prepared mix for the cake and you can also substitute lemon pudding mix for the curd. The filling and frosting kept getting soft so I refrigerated it a little at a time but it came out beautiful.

Made the cake in stages. It turned out wonderful. I frosted the cake Sat. morning , put it in a cooler and transported it 4 hours. I was worried, but the cake did survive the trip.The decorative top even looked good.I used a Tupperware cake decorating tip - a breeze to use for a novice. I am making again.Tasted great. Lemony and light. I doubled the curd- plenty of that but did I have "filling " left over! I have been sneaking litle finger-fulls right out of the refrig.

I have made the cake and frosting part of this recipe 3 times now. Filling with other fruits mixtures like pineapple/coconut and peach and using other simples syrups for brushing. The lightness of the cake and ease of preparation makes the cake recipe a launching point for other layered desserts.

This is an impressive looking cake for a casual, summer gathering. However, I, too, found the lemon taste was overwhelming without much richness. It was time consuming, so make sure those that you will serve it too are lemon lovers. I found it too be better after a day or two in the fridge.

Sorry, but am I the only person who found this recipe an obscenely expensive failure? After I realized that I was spending over $25 on this (I cheated and purchased lemon curd) I was leery if this could possibly be worth it. The filling was way too soft to be able to spread. Cream cheese would have been just as good (if not better) and would have had the right consistency (and at $4.99 for 8 oz. for marscapone, a lot cheaper). I was able to salvage this by making it into parfaits. It was tasty, but not as impressive and tasty as a cheesecake or several other recipes on this site. All the other reviews were so stellar that I was really psyched for this, but it didn't live up to the hype.

My mother-in-law, who rarely eats more than two bites of dessert because she doesn't care for sweets, was following her grandsons around to glean the leftover frosting from their plates, if that tells you anything. :)

Rating: 4
Extremely good. I made 2/3 the amount of frosting and had a litle leftover, but would have needed all of it had I done the rosettes on top, rather than just making it smooth. The cake layers seem dry out of the oven, but the lemon syrup makes them extremely moist. Any more and it might have actually been too wet. I do NOT think using twice as much lemon curd, as many reviewers have suggested, would have been a good idea. It's already quite lemony. True, the curd is not really visible between the layers when you cut it, but I think the magazine cover with the visible bright yellow was tacky. The accurate picture attached to this recipe looks nicer to me, and more importantly, the amount of lemon flavor seemed just right. I used self-rising flour instead of cake flour--this may have helped make the layers airy and soak up the syrup well. At the very least, it didn't hurt.

Rating: 3
I thought the amount of frosting was just right. I followed other reviewer's suggestions and made extra lemon curd, but I had a lot of trouble assembling the layers with the extra curd. My layers began to shift in the fridge and I had to do some repair work before serving. I will make this again, it was a great dessert after a heavy meal, but I may stick to the recipe as written.

Rating: 4
This cake is outstanding. Everyone I served it to marvelled at it - I got accused of buying it at a bakery and pulling "the switch." I had extra frosting as well, but not a third. I also ran out of curd unfortunately, and will make 50% more next time I make this.

Excellent special cake, and a great one to make ahead. I made cake and lemon curd Friday night, frosted the cake on Saturday and served it Sunday. It needs the overnight for the flavors to seep into the cake. I followed the recipe exactly and used almost all the frosting. Make sure to whip the cream enough to get a firm frosting. I did use Lemoncello as a replacement for the lemon juice in the syrup.

Rating: 4
I have to agree with all the comment. You get WAY more frosting that is required for the cake. Cutting it by a third is probably a good idea. I also found it's definitely a cake that hang in there for more than a couple of days - and it probably tastes better too! All in all, a great, light tasting (though very rich) cake.

Rating: 3
Delicious cake. Heeding the warnings of others, I only made 2/3 of the amount of frosting, and found this to be just about right. Several house guests raved about it, and wanted it for breakfast the following day. I agree it was just as good three days later.

As another reviewer said, the recipe makes way too much icing. I would cut it down by a third, and use the rest of the curd as extra filling. The texture of the cake was nice and light, and overall the cake was not too sweet, just right. Yum!

I made this cake Sunday for a Monday party. I'm eating the leftovers on Thursday, and it's as good or better than that 2nd day. Boy, do I love something this good that you can make ahead! A fabulous cake that remains servable at least 4 days, beautiful to present, moist, tart and creamy all at the same time. What could be better?? The only problem I had was finding something large enough to keep it in. My Tupperware keeper scraped off some of the icing.

This cake is time consuming, but it's well worth it! It turned out very well, not dry at all. I did have a problem with the frosting being too soft, but a few hours in the fridge solved that. Made it today for a luncheon (5 women). There is only one small slice left!! Simply said it's delicious.

I've made this cake twice. The first time, I followed the recipie exactly and it was quite good. The second time I made the cake I used a good white cake mix instead of making it was at least as good, harder to mess up, and less time consuming. I also doubled the amount of lemon curd between the cake layers because the first time it wasn't quite enough for my taste-- and finally (this made is the best tip!) use Lemoncello liquor instead of making the lemon syrup, about 1/4 cup per layer. The marscapone frosting is perfect, and the cake IS noticably more delicious if you give it a solid 24 hours in the fridge to "bloom".

This recipe was wonderful! Thankfully, it was not as time consuming as the recipe originally seemed. The final product actually looked exactly like the picture (with no leftover icing)! I must admit though, that after 3 grocery stores and no italian shops around, i had to resort to regular old cream cheese. Worked like a charm!!! I would make this recipe again.

I made this cake for a Mother's Day get together, and everyone raved about it. It was fairly easy to make, though I used nearly every bowl I own. I made a third more lemon curd then the recipe called for and it made for very nice yellow layers, however it made the cake slip a little. I would recommend making this cake at least a day in advance to allow it to chill and stay together.

I made this for Mother's Day dinner at my sister-in-law's. Everyone loved the cake. My sister-in-law already put in her order for this cake for her birthday in November. I followed the entire recipe. With the lemons I used for the lemon juice, I made candied lemon peel, then sprinkled them over the decorated cake for added color. It made a wonderful presentation.

I also had lots of frosting left over, but did bake the cake in 8 inch pans. I didn't double the curd due to lack of lemons, but wish I did. An easy recipe if you do it in steps. Being a lemon lover, I will make this again with plenty of lemon curd next time.

Rating: 4
Very good. I listened to some of the other reviews and doubled the lemon curd - good suggestion. However, I disagree with the comments about the recipe making too much frosting. I used all of the frosting, with only alittle to spare for touch ups. Make sure that you whip the cream until very stiff, I found that my frosting was a bit soft and I had to chill it for a while before I could successfully pipe the rosettes. (I also made the mistake of listening to another review about not using 3 packages of marscopone - I only used two. The frosting was delicious - but soft. Definately follow the written recipe for the frosting. ) Everyone really love the cake. There were even a few people who (after seconds)stood around the extra cake on the platter with forks and finished it off. The cake was also very pretty. Easy to decorate, and I added a few fresh yellow flowers on top - simple but beautiful.

Like many other reviewers, I wanted a spectacular cake for Easter. Well, I ran out of time to bake the cake, so substituted good purchased pound cake & then proceeded with the syrup, lemon curd & frosting.

A marvelous dessert! I made this for a dinner party I had with friends, and they were all thoroughly impressed... especially since we're in college. I find myself trying to find success in "difficult" recipes (just so I can brag to my mother if they turn out well), but this one was MUCH easier than I'd anticipated! I had a great time decorating it (I made rose shapes with the icing instead). I plan on making it again for my grandparents' 50th wedding anniversary celebration this summer, and think I will add a few edible flowers for further garnish. (The recipe does make quite a bit extra marscapone icing, but I melted it down and put it on top of a bread pudding)

This was a terrific cake! A project to make but well worth the effort. And I never thought I'd like lemon cake let alone love it!

I made this cake for my mom's wedding and got rave reviews. It seemed to be a universal crowd pleaser. Before the wedding, I made a "practice cake". I'm glad I did because there was too much of the decadent mascarpone frosting - I cut the recipe in half for the real thing. Also, since the frosting was so rich, I assembled the cake in a more rustic style - no frosting on the sides, just between the layers and slathered on top. It was nice to see some of the lemon curd peeking through from between the layers. I also liked the fact that this cake wasn't overly sweet and it had a nice texture. All in all, a delicious, rich and impressive cake that was simple (and foolproof) to make.

Rating: 4
Although the recipe seems complicated, if broken down into its individual parts it really wasn't too difficult. I did add the extra egg whites from the lemon curd to the cake batter which made the cake even lighter than the original recipe. Everyone raved about it - including my dog who stole one of the layers from the counter and didn't leave a morsal of evidence.

I made this with purchased lemon curd, and put 1 cup into the frosting. It turned out perfectly. I thought the frosting was perfect and there wasn't too much at all. I had exactly the right amount. I do agree that more lemon curd between the layers might be nice, but it is unnecessary. I had no problems with the cake being dry- I used the entire recipe of syrup. Everyone that tried some loved it.

This cake turned out almost perfect. My goal was to make it look like the picture and it came close. I used two 12 oz. jars of lemon curd, which cut down the preparation time. I also took another reader's advice and used more syrup than directed on each layer of the cake. My cake was very moist and flavorful. It is a rich cake so small servings are recommended. I had a dinner for four people and still have about 75% left to freeze.

Rating: 3
I totally agree that the lemon curd should be doubled and it's best to cut back the mascarpone to 8-16 ounces. It is a good and pretty cake, and making it ahead is a benefit because then you don't even have to worry about it on the day you are serving your guests.

Rating: 4
Not only is this cake beautiful it is delicious. I served it Easter sunday and everyone loved it. I love to bake and have become good (super) at it, but I haven't mastered cake decorating at this point so my cakes must be exceptionally good since I just swirl the icing on and call it ready. We loved the tangy taste of lemon curd against the sweetness of the cake and frosting.

Rating: 4
I followed the directions to the letter and it was wonderful! You could add more lemon curd if you want a stronger lemon flavor and the visual impact of a more distinct bright yellow layer, but it was really great just as written. The cake MUST be made and assembled a day ahead of serving, as the thin syrup needs to moisten the cake. That's why so many reviewers liked the leftovers more the day after. The frosting held up beautifully while refregerated overnight. Everyoneyone raved about it! This one is a keeper.

This cake was so yummy everyone had seconds after a very filling dinner... I would double the lemon curd next time (this is the cover recipe from this issue and the picture definitely looks like they doubled it as well). Otherwise don't change a thing. A must for lemon dessert lovers. I did not do the fancy rosettes on top and just smoothed the frosting - it was fine - also serve with fresh strawberries with a little powdered sugar on them. Helped presentation on plate and tasted great together!

Way too much frosting. I used 16 oz of mascarpone and still had too much! The frosting is very rich so a little goes a long way. I make my own lemon curd and used about 2 cups of curd. I think this cake is even better after a day or so. The cake gets moister. This cake was a big hit. I think I'll put edible flowers coated with sugar next Easter for a pretty top.

Rating: 2
The cake looks spectacular and tastes good enough, but in order for the finished product to resemble the illustration and taste like something more than the rich filling, I would make half again as much lemon curd and 2/3 the frosting recipe. As presented, there was only enough lemon curd for a thin skim on each layer and way too much nasty-rich frosting. Be careful not to overbeat the cream or the frosting will be hard to spread.

Rating: 2
I thought that this cake was relatively easy to assemble and certainly lovely, but I was disappointed for a few reasons: 1) This cake does not look like the stunning Bon Appetite cover photo, instead it resembles the less colorful inside photo (no bright lemon curd shows). 2) I found the marscapone flavor to be overpowing in the final product, not allowing the wonderful flavor of the curd to shine through enough. The cake was plenty moist, and my family did enjoy it, it just wasn't the "super-stunner" that I was hoping for.

I was looking for a cake to make for Easter that would be out of the ordinary. This was definitely it. It was relatively easy to make (but then, I'm the adventurous type) and assempled well, but I wasn't thrilled with the mascarpone icing. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but I wasn't wowed by it. Everyone else raved, however, and there was only a small wedge left - which I gave to the hostess. I would agree that there doesn't seem to be enough lemon curd. Having said that, this cake is really rich, so I'm not sure I would want much more than the recipe made. BTW, the cake that I made was not dry. I think I used enough syrup to ensure that it was nice and moist.

Rating: 2
I don't know what went wrong. I followed the recipe, and I have made plenty of cakes, and the cake came out very thin and relatively dense. More dense then I anticipated. The cake was dry and the frosting didn't hold up. All in all the cake was good and my guests enjoyed it but it was ugly and dry. I made the cake part a second time and it came out the same. I wouldn't make it again but I would like to see what a professional may be able to with it.

I made this cake for Easter. I used a bunny face cake pan and split the baked cake in half to make my layers. I then decorated the face of the frosted bunny with white chocolate clay that had been colored with food coloring to form the eyes, nose and ears. It turned out very cute. Everyone loved the cake. It was light and fluffy and perfect after a big outdoor champagne brunch. This cake lasted outdoors for hours in 75 degree temperatures in Arizona. (I kept it in the shade.) I didn't know if the frosting would hold up for that long, but it did. My only complaint with the cake part is it's too dry even though I used a lot of syrup to soak it. I also used a lot of the frosting between layers, as well as lemon curd. I made the cake two days in advance and it was still a little too dry for my tastes. I will make a different cake portion the next time, but use the rest of the recipe. I will use the frosting again and again for different cakes. I am thinking of adding melted white chocolate to substitute for the lemon curd for a white chocolate cake recipe I have. I'll experiment with it, but I'm sure it would be very good.

This was labor intensive, but a very pretty presentation and it was tasty, though I guess I expected more given some earlier reviews.

This cake was the perfect dessert following a heavy Easter dinner -- light, yet still rich. Because the cake itself is so dense, it's easy to cut into thin slices, and easily served 16. For those who wanted to purchase the curd, the recipe makes 22 oz., but making the curd isn't that hard. I made the cake on Friday for Sunday dinner, and the moisture was just right. I also agree with whomever said the leftover frosting was great with strawberries -- raspberries too! I topped the cake with three raspberries in the center and served each piece with an extra spritz of frosting and a raspberry on the plate.

Delicious and beautiful! I have made this twice now and wowed the crowd both times. I did have lots of icing left over, but I think the amount of lemon curd is fine...it's more for flavor than filling. One note about making the icing...when it says to beat the cream until "peaks form", that means STIFF peaks. I went to soft peaks the first time and the icing was way too soft! Teh recipe is sort of time-consuming but fun to do.

Rating: 4
This came out perfectly for me. I think the amount of the lemon curd is fine. It's more for flavor than for filling. I don't think you need to use all of the syrup; I brushed it generously over each layer and threw out the excess. Once local strawberries are in season, I'll make this again, but skipping the syrup entirely, placing a layer of strawberries over each layer instead of the syrup, except for the top where I'll leave them whole, above a flat layer of the frosting, rather than the stars. The frosting is divine; it could go with just about any kind of layer cake. This made dessert for a big group of guests at Easter with leftovers for the lucky ones.

This is a great cake! My daughter requested it for her birthday when she saw the cover photo, and she gave me Meyers lemons from her tree (so I had an advantage!) I agree with those who thought it needed more lemon curd (no way that the accompanying photo had only 1/4 cup of curd between the layers); when I make it again--and I will--I'll double the curd. Trader Joe's just didn't compare to the lemon curd made according to the recipe, it seemed gray-ish and bitter in comparison. I made the curd a full week ahead of time and it was delicious. I put lemon slice curls and daisies on the platter around the cake. It was beautiful and folks went back for THIRD servings! It's the perfect cake for spring birthdays--just allow yourself lots of time to assemble it.

Just finished the finishing touches on this cake. The hardest part was not eating all the frosting prior to it being applied to the cake. Cake came out perfectly, although I found 15 minutes was way too long to bake. Must keep in mind that a dark cake pan cooks much faster than a light one, and a air-form pan takes even longer. The quesion I have is how much trouble will I get in if I sneak downstairs to have a slice B4 the company arrives tomorrow. Try this, it is a winner. Happy Easter All !

I made this for my mother's birthday, and the whole family loved it. It was time consuming, but well worth it for a special occasion. Like others here, I would recommend increasing the amount of curd and decreasing the amount of frosting. After assembling the cake, I had about 2 cups left over (although it does go well with strawberries). My family loves lemon, and thought that the flavor was nice, but a bit too subtle for our tastes. The next time I make this, I will double the amount of curd.

I made this cake for my mother's birthday, as she is an avid lemon cake lover! The recipe was time-consuming, but enjoyable to work with in the kitchen. My lemon curd did not turn out- it was more runny than thick, but I used it in the cake layers anyway. I agree with the other reviewers in that the cake itself is too dry. After a few days in the refrigerator, it becomes too mushy because of the lemon syrup. However, I loved the icing recipe and would use that again, possibly on a different cake.

Made this recipe for our Dinner at 8 dinner group. About 1/2 the participants left 1/2 or more on their plate (Were the servings too big? I ate all of mine!). I like the frosting, thought the cake was dry (I ate leftover cake the next evening and was surprised to find the cake moister). I would have liked more lemon curd between the layers and less frosting. I had leftover frosting and used it as a dip with strawberries - this was a big hit. I would use the frosting recipe again.

I made this for a birthday celebration and it was a hit. I too saved time by buying ready-made lemon curd. I found some English Lemon Curd at Trader Joe's supermarket and bought 3 12oz. jars, using nearly all of them. I added the lemon curd liberally between layers, and approximated the addition to the frosting by adding a whole 12oz. jar. It came out perfect - not too stiff, not too loose. The cake was a tad dry, but with the yummy frosting and lemon curd in between layers, it tasted just fine. My biggest problem - not making a lopsided cake! My layers never seem to come out evenly, but hey - it tasted great.

Rating: 3
A major hit at a group dinner party. I myself was astounded by the results. Everyone was quite happy. One recommendation, increase the lemon curd preparation by about 30%, and add that extra 30 to the part you save for the layers; it could have used a bit more curd. Also, when spooning the filling between layers on top of that curd, add a dollop to an imagined four corners and spread from there. It spills over the edges quite easily. Before presentation, I added some lemon zest to the top of the cake to make it a little more stunning.

Rating: 3
I agree with the other reviewers that this was an excellent recipe, having said that I did encounter some difficulties. In order to save time I used ready made lemon curd which is widely available and of high quality. The only problem was that I could not discern how much curd would be produced by the recipe so I did not know how much to add to the icing, I guessed and added about 8 oz which caused the icing to be rather loose and impossible to pipe. I also think one could use twice the amount of lemon curd between the layers. Finally I did not think the cake remained that moist despite the use of the syrup. I considered adding Lemoncello to the syrup, also considered using lemon oil and sugar in the icing instead of lemon curd thereby avoiding the potential for the acid on the curd to break down the icing. I appreciate any input others could give, I would like to make this again soon.

Judging from the reviews and the review dates and when the recipe was issued, I would use the magazine recipe. And the recipe on the web site states 1/2 cup butter with "1/2 stick" in (). 1/2 stick is a 1/4 cup of butter. Whoever typed the recipe into the web site had a typo. Also, the magazine states 1/4 cup of lemon juice for the lemon curd. Make sure to make these changes to your printed web site copy. I would use the magazine. So in brief, use 1/4 cup of butter in the curd. And a 1/4 cup of fresh lemon juice in the syrup. I will see if there is a way to contact epicurious.com to have corrected.

I would really like to make this cake, but would like to know the correct ingredients to use. Are they the ones on the web site or the ones in the Bon Appetit magazine.

My wife made this cake for a truly splendid dinner party she organized for my 40th birthday. Can't recall ever having had a cake that can rival it! Alas, it vanished. But such is the way of a world in which we cannot have our cake and eat it too.

A friend from work invited me and my husband to his wife's birthday party, along with several other of their close friends. Not only did they prepare a wonderful meal, but the cake was absolutely yummy! It was so good, I had to have the recipe. They said making the cake was quite an involved process, but anything that tastes as great as this is certainly worth the work.

This is a wonderful recipe--one that I will definitely make again. It does take a bit more effort than your average cake, but it is so worth it! Beautiful to look at and divine to eat--the cake stayed incredibly moist, even after several days (the "syrup" is the key to the moisture--and it should be a thin liquid, in spite of what the name implies). I followed the recipe to the word and would not change a thing. One tip regarding cutting the cake into layers--I used a slicing knife and a cake turntable, turning the cake as I cut it, and it worked out beautifully.

Followed recipe exactly as is and turned out wonderful. It is somewhat involved, and does take at least a couple of days prep work. Only problems I encountered were, the two layers of cake were fairly difficult to cut in half. I even had a wire cake-cutter. Just takes a very steady hand, and cooling the cake in the freezer helps. Also, my syrup didn't really turn into syrup. It stayed still very thin. This may be correct, and I still applied it to each layer. Just was much thinner than what I think of when I think of syrup. Iced it exactly as in the photo, and turned out beautiful. The icing is incredible. My guests were very, very impressed and the taste was outstanding. I served it with home-made vanilla bean ice-cream. Delicious!
