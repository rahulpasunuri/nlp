I made these when the recipe first came out. These were a bit of a pain to make, but my brother who is not only a great cook, but has a very sophisticated palate loved them and still begs me to make them. I did not put the apricot filling in them, so they were not soggy at all. i dipped one half in chocolate. I had lost the recipe and when I searched I found this. Making it again this year for my brother.

I tried this recipe and was very disappointed in the result. Considering the amount of work and expense that went into these and the way they sog over the course of the day I would never make them again. Also the amount of apricot given in the recipe was way too much. On a scale of 1-5 I give this recipe a 2 only because the cookies tasted good plain out of the oven.
