the flavor of this was great, but next time ill double the veggies. the lamb turned out a bit overcooked for my taste, so ill shorten the cooking time there, too. we had this with couscous and it was super fest and easy.

Really impressed with this. The spice mixture is fantastic. I used fleur de sel for a bit more bite.

Tasty, easy to make and fast. However, I would double the amount of vegetables and sprinkle the meat with the seasoning as well.

It has a strange combination of spices. I tried to feed the vegetables to the dog, he didn't like it either.
