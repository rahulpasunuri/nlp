Fantastic cookie! This little number is a hit at nearly any gathering - holiday cookie exchange to casual dinner party. I have made them twice exactly per recipe using Challenge butter with delicious results each time. Agree with previous reviewer...don't be stingy with egg whites to produce a very pretty cookie.

An exceptional, sophisticated cookie -- this is what you bring to a dinner party, not what you bring to a kids' cookie party. Don't be stingy with the egg whites.

Great recipe and really easy. I don't know why anyone would want to mess with rolling these out just to cut them into circles. I divided my dough in half and rolled each half into a log. Chilled the logs then just cut each into half, halved the halves until I had 16 slices per log. I dipped the bottom of a glass in flour and pressed down on each slice to flatten slightly. Much less mess and trouble and no need to gather scraps and re-roll, which always yields inferior cookies. I followed the recipe exactly otherwise, and my cookies looked exactly like the picture and tasted great. They do need to be completely cooled before you can fully appreciate how good they really are. Mine tasted better the next day.

Delicious. A little finicky to roll out but so worth the time and effort.

My dough was far too crumbly. Hard to work with.

Yummy! The first time I made them I used a jumbo egg, and the dough was too wet to roll and cut. So I made it into two 8-inch rolls, wrapped each in wax paper and refrigerated until firm. Then I used a sharp, thin-bladed knife to cut each roll into 32 cookies 1/4 inch thick. Worked like a charm. The next time, after grinding the toasted nuts I just added all the other ingredients (except the egg white, which I covered and refrigerated) to the processor and processed until well combined, then rolled and refrigerated as previously. Much easier and less mess. Takes 64 pecan halves, but more pecans is never a bad thing. I do not butter the baking sheets or use parchment. I can get 32 cookies on each of two sheets as they don't spread much, and I cook both sheets at the same time, switching their position about 12 minutes in. These cookies should look dry and very lightly golden when removed from the oven. The refrigerator version takes 18-22 minutes in my oven.

Miam! This simple, sweet cookie won the hearts of everyone at a vin chaud party last night. No need for fancy ingredients I'd say. It's worth doubling the recipe though, these will be munched up quickly! I loved the nutty flavor; what a marvel that those toasted, pulsed pecans add to the dough. Magical!

I make this cookie every year without fail. It has exceptional flavour and texture.

Very good as written, but I think these could be amazing with simple additions. A little bit of cinnamon or perhaps some ground cardamom would add nice flavor. Maybe I rolled mine too thin, but they were a bit overdone for me in 15 min.

This was a delicious little number that I was proud to serve. I used a diamond shaped cookie cutter and they couldn't have looked and tasted lovelier! Very sophisticated little biscuit. I didn't use fancy butter, but maybe one day I will spring for it and make these again!

This is a beautiful addition to any cookie tray - they disappear very fast. I did not have sea salt, but because I live in Mexico, the butter is outstanding - like Plugra. I used a one and 7/8 inch fluted cookie cutter, and lightly toasted the pecans for the top. I also sprinkled a tiny bit of sugar after I finished brushing on the egg white - the sugar here is less refined and more like raw sugar. These cookies are delicious and I could not stop making them. Made two double batches for Christmas trays.

Delicious and easy to get them to look uniform and professional. I had trouble lifting out cutouts so I rolled into balls in my palms and flattened on to cookie sheet. They only needed to be baked for 13 minutes

Thought these were great. Yes, there are so many other cookies out there, but for the nutty, tasty butter cookie...yum. Melted in my mouth. I used unsalted raw pecans from Trader Joes so they were not salty. Followed the recipe exactly and they turned out. Only took 11 minutes to cook.

Wow! Easy and delicious, not too sweet and perfectly crumbly. To the reviewer who thought these were too salty: you may have used salted pecans, or salted butter which would make these too salty.

I didn't have any fancy European butter nor did I use the sea salt, but they still turned out delicious! I rolled the dough into 1/2 inch thickness and baked 20 minutes. Delicious! Brought the cookies to the office and everyone loved them.

Made them for Christmas, but with plain old butter and regular old salt. Still, they were okay. Not my favorite cookie, but repeatable.

I doubled the recipe but only came out with 3 1/2 dozen. I did use a star cutter but it was small. They're pretty cookies. I used sea salt and wow is that strong when you bite into one. Not sure how I feel about that yet.

This is the best pecan cookie I have ever eaten and I didn't bother using European butter or fancy sea salt.

This was a really good recipe, however, when I made the cookies 1/4" as directed, they burned. I made mine closer to 1/2" and watched them carefully. Wonderful results!

Incredible recipe!!!! I bake professionally and this actually one of the better "sable" type cookies I've made. The dough is very forgiving thanks to the confectioners' sugar. I've actually multiplied the recipe and it has remained consistent.

An unexpected cookie that stands out from the crowd, I brought them to a Thanksgiving dinner and they were a total hit. I used a diamond-shaped cookie cutter instead of round and they looked quite elegant. Splurge on European butter and expensive sea salt. It's absolutely worth it.
