I have made this recipe now for 5 years in a row. Whomever's house has the seder, I am asked to bring this dish. It is not a traditional tzimmis, but a terrific twist. I add dried apples and prunes to make it more like my mother's traditional sweet potato tzimmis. Everyone loves this recipe!

I began making this dish 5 years ago for Passover and will keep it as a Passover staple. It is an unusual twist on traditional Tzimmes. I am used to other dried fruits in tzimmes so I add dried apple and some prunes. This seems to be a love / hate dish. You either love it or not. Most of my family and friends love it and ask for it every year.

I have made this dish every year for seder since 2002 when I was asked to bring tsimmes to a cousin's house. Not a fan of traditional tsimmes, but a big fan of matzoh balls, I thought this might be a good compromise, and that's exactly what it is. I do brown the matzoh balls, but I use extra light olive oil, and they seem to absorb less fat than they did with the margarine, making them lighter. It's a delicious blend of sweet and savory.

I grew up in a very traditional Jewish household, and had the pleasure of eating tzimmes on all the holidays. This is not a tzimmes recipe and shouldn't be judged as a tzimmes, but it is quite delicious. It is everything a holiday recipe should be: special and festive and fragrant. I've made it many times and it is always a hit.

I served these with dessert, and they were good, but not a substitute for the regular matzah balls in soup.

The teenagers liked it. No one else thought it was great. TO be fair, I've never liked Tzimmes but I figured I'd try this since I love matzo balls and thought a different twist would nice. I did skip the preforming step and just rolled 'em and cooked em.

Was looking for a tzimmes recipe, one like my grandma used to make....this DEFINITELY IS NOT IT! Did make it though as it sounded very interesting....served it at a special holiday dinner....those who ate it, loved it! asked for recipe and requested that i make it again for next year's holiday! lots of steps involved, but worth the effort.

Tasty, but... 1. Much too greasy - the margarine in the sauce soaked into the matzah balls. Plus, frying in margarine imparted an unpleasant fried-in-margarine taste (I'd use butter or oil next time, if frying is really necessary). 2. Problems with quantities - I bought 2 large potatos (1 1/2 lbs) and when I scooped out 1 1/4 cup, I still had half a potato left. Also, after an hour of simmering, I had 2 cups of sauce; don't know how long it would have taken to get to 3/4 cup as called for. 3. I'd use fresh ginger next time. 4. Preparation is way too complicated... any ideas for simplification? I skipped dropping the matzah ball mixture on foil before forming into balls; I'd consider skipping either the frying or the baking.

It is delicious. I made it exactly as the recipe called for. Even the children loved it.

made this recipe two years ago and it was a great success. It was a bit time consuming to make but worth it.have given the recipe to several people that have tasted them. Thought they were very different.
