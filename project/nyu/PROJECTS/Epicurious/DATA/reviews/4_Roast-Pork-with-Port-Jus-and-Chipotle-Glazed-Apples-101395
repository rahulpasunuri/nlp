Made this dish tonight. It was basically easy to prepare but a bit time consuming. The flavors work great together. It is a restaurant quality dish. My husband and guests loved it. The chipotle adds a wonderful kick. Will certainly make again.

I'm giving this recipe a 3 for taste but a 1 for attention to detail. I cooked the pork 15 minutes less than instructed and only then took the temperature - it was already 30 degrees over, so it's quite overcooked. The jus is a disaster because it too has already taken nearly 45 minutes longer than the instructions, and it is still nowhere near reduced to 1 1/4 cups, so we've had to start dinner without it. It's very tasty, but the instructions are really off. Chef Beware!

A correction to my earlier post: It's roast for 15 minutes at 400F and then for 1 hour - 1 hour 15 minutes at 350F until the meat thermometer registers 155F. Sorry for the confusion!

Definitely something worth doing for a special holiday meal with family or a big group of friends! Well worth the effort and the cost of the ingredients! Used a 5.5 lb standing rib roast and used roasting instructions from the Joy of Cooking: 250F for 15 mins and then lower to 225F and roast for about 1 hour until the meat thermometer registers 155F. Needs some water in the pan (add 1 cup at a time) and baste with pan juices every 30 minutes. I also used 1 1/2 tbsp in lieau of 2 tbsp of cumin as per other reviews. Did the port sauce which really compliments the roast perfectly. Didn't have ruby port so I used 2 cups tawny port and added 1 cup Madeira. Worked phenomenally! The sauce takes a long time to reduce (an hour or so) but well worth the wait. In the meantime, took the extra effort to do the chipotle apples and the cilantro mashed potatoes as per other reviews. Perfect combination!

This was killer! Did pretty much as written, but since I was cooking only for myself, instead of roasting a boneless loin I pan- roasted a bone-in chop, deglazing the pan to make the sauce afterwards. Also substituted ancho chili powder for the brown sugar in the rub so it wouldn't burn while searing, and brined the chop before applying the rub the same day.

I didn't read all the reviews, so perhaps someone mentioned this, but it bears repeating - save your shallots from the port sauce! They make an excellent topping for cheese and crackers. And the apples are really worth the effort.

This was very simple and made great use of a cheaper cut of meat. I did not have time to let the spices sit overnight but I added some Dijon mustard on the top layer of the pork over the spices and it was delicious . I baked it in a clay cooker which keep in the moisture and I recommend this method. I shortened the time to make the Port Jus by adding less broth to the reduced port and sugar mixture. It may be better with a longer reduction time but in a pinch and rushed for time it turned out perfect. My husband asked for it again before he had even finished eating.

What a great recipe! I made this for my husband & myself for our wedding anniversary dinner & we both loved the flavor combinations...the sweetness of the port sauce with the heat from the chipotle apples. Really a dish worthy of a special occasion. We made this with the roasted garlic parsnips suggested on this site & I wouldn't change a thing. I'm thinking about making this again for christmas eve.

excellent dish, got rave reviews at my table, BUT as another reviewer noted, the pork took much less time to cook than the recipe indicated. watch it very carefully. also, be sure to reduce the sauce substantially, as a runny sauce makes a poor presentation. still tastes good.

I made this for my Book Group and served it with Arugula Salad with Manchego, Apples and Caramelized Walnuts, and Whipped Parsnips with Roasted Garlic (from this site). It was fabulous! All of my guests thought it would make a great alternative Thanksgiving meal.

This is a great, great recipe and so easy. Everyone at dinner club loved it and the leftovers are just as good! I also made the apples (which is a must do)along with mashed sweet potatoes with pureed pears. YUM all around!

I usually make the spice rub and sauce with pork medallions -- the cooking time is dramatically reduced but the flavors are still stunning. This meal is a favorite of my husband's -- I make the chipotle apples, cilantro mashed potatoes and apple fennel salad to accompany it, with pears poached in red wine sauce for dessert.

Rating: 4
I made this dinner with cilantro mashed potatoes and the effects of all the flavors: cumin, cilantro, chipotle--sweet and spicy, made for a most delicious, mouth-watering bite. I recommend watching the pork carefully, it took substantially less time to cook in my oven and pork will continue to cook even after you take it out of the oven. I had guests ask for a straw, the jus was that good.

Beautiful Presentation.

This dish lived up to all of the reviews. The combination of the sweet and spicy flavors complimented each other very well. The chiptle glazed apples were easy to make although many of the previous reviews noted strong smells and the challenges with making them ahead of time. I made them in advance and let them stay at room temperature. I must admit that the "heat" was a big suprise at it was at LEAST a 10 sec. delay from the sweetness. I made this dish for a family dinner and everyone LOVED it! I would rate it 3 1/2 forks and will definitley make it again. Great meal that was enjoyed by all!

Concur in the reviews below. Followed the recipe exactly, except substituted each chipotle pepper with a little less than a tsp of canned chipotle pepper sauce. Diners were seriously impressed; a roast fit for service at a restaurant.

FABULOUS!!! Made this dish twice. 1st time was a test run prior to Christmas dinner. Followed directions exactly with exception used thick cut pork chops since it was just hubby and me. We both loved, however thought cumin should be cut back. In preparation for Christmas dinner, I made port jus in advance however I added a bit of roux to give it some consistency, then froze. (I also tripled the jus recipe and stored additional in 1 cup containers as this sauce is delicious with beef and makes the meal prep faster.) Also, instead of frying apples on Christmas, I broiled them on a hot cast iron skillet when the meat came out of oven to rest (so apples would be tan on each side). Much easier and no last minute fussing. Everyone loved the combination of flavors. Thanks bunches to the restaurant that shared this delicious dish!!!

Forgot to mention that reduced Jus almost twice as long as specified - and turned out wonderful.

Made this for christmas dinner. Absolute hit with everyone. Flavours are awsome, and as an idiot read recipe wrong and marinated wihtout the sugar overnight, added it 1/2 hour before cooked, still wonderful. If possible this is even better when cold the next day, and therefor would recommend as a coldcut. Becomes awesome with the chipotle glazed apples, absolute must. Most succulent way of cooking pork i have found yet. This is my christmas pork from now on.

Wow - this was great and my guests raved - just wish i had doubled the recipe!!! used white sugar because i was out of brown - made the apples that morning and the sauce never really got very syrupy but this was an amazing recipe - think i'll try it with tenderloins next and make extra apples - perfect dish as the weather turns and it starts to get a little colder - actually would be perfect just about anytime - any suggestions on making the sauce a little thicker would be appreciated

This is a totally delicious roast. I used an 10 rib crown roast - bone-in for a holiday dinner party for 8. The pork is delicious but the sauce is divine! It's an easy dinner party dish and was a hit with my guests. I served it with roasted garlic mashed sweet potatoes and of course the apples. Yum.

Made this for an annual Christmas bash with friends. I cook a lot for this group and this was definately a favorite. Lots of ompliments...especially for the au jus and apples. I was a little worried about the amount of cumin and I could really smell it while the roast cooked but it was sooo good and moist! A wonderful meal!

Rating: 3
This was great and should be a 3 1/2 fork. I made the apples the day before and kept in the fridge on parchment paper on a cookie sheet. I reheated in oven while cutting the roast. My guests raved about it. My husband said it tasted even better the next day - if that was possible. I served with chive and parsley mashed potatoes as well as steamed green beans.

Delicious. A bit tedious with the three steps - roast, sauce and apples. Everybody loved it and got lots of compliments. Made twice the recipe of apples with half the pepper - kids in the group. Served it with the Sweet Potato and Yam Galette and was a great pairing.

Very good. Easy to make and quite spicy. I cooked it well-done and it was not dry - it was my first time to make a pork roast. Definitely do the apples and the Port jus.

I was only making this for two, so I used a small (1.5 lbs) tenderloin and cut down the marinating time -- I put the rub on in the late morning (on my lunch break) and left it all day. For the smaller, more tender cut of meat, this was perfect amount of time. For the prep, I seared it on all sides, then put it in a 375 oven for only about 10 minutes. For the sauce, do use a good quality port (I know this gets expensive because 3 cups is almost a whole bottle) but don't expect to find one called "ruby" which is what really young port is called and which generally can't be found. Just not "tawny" port. Do not neglect the reduction stages, they are essential for the taste. Definitely make the apples.

i made this recipe for 18 people this Christmas Eve, and I served it with the Chipotle Apples as recommended. Our local grocery had huge port loins for a killer sale, so I decided to try it out. I doubled the recipe for a 9 pound loin. My favorite part of the evening was hearng one of our outspoken guests asking his wife how come her pork is never that tender or jucy. Not too smart if you ask me. I have to admit it was stellar. Everyone raved about it, and there was much less left over than I had expected. The Chipotle Apples were awesome too, but the house had to be cleared when I was cooking them because everyone was coughing and rubbing their eyes.

Rating: 4
One of my absolute favorite meals. A pork roast supreme is a nice substitute for the recommended loin and tends to be a bit more tender. I've also substituted a boneless pork shoulder roast and had good (although less elegant,) results.

Rating: 4
Outstanding! Followed this to the minute, except was out of brown sugar when I did the dry rub. Substituted a little raspberry jam. Used a Pork Loin Crown instead of a boneless loin, since this is what I had. Made with the Port Jus and Chipolte Apples and served with buttermilk mashed pototoes kicked up with chives and garlic.

Wow, this is a terrific recipe for pork roast. Very easy, as long as you prepare for the overnight marinating. The port jus is a terrific complement. I've made this a number of times and it's become a favorite. We often use the leftover pork in enchiladas, stretching this into another tasty meal. Yum!

Wonderful dish. Dead easy to prepare and melt-in-your-mouth delicious. Don't skip the apples; their distinctive taste compliments the pork perfectly. I made extra and served the pork slices on a small bed of apples.

Pork roast raised to high art. I have also made the jus with a plain ole red, in the interest of economy and all I had to do was reduce longer for a different (and cheaper!) yet equally satisfying sauce. Don't skip the apples.

DUH! In the "read the recipe" column, I missed the overnight marination of the pork. Subsequently, the flavors were not nearly rich enough to compliment the apples (which were terrific). Will try this again the right way!!

Now one of our favorite meals! Made with sweet potatoes with cinnamon, nutmeg and brown sugar and a spinach salad with cranberries, pecans and feta. Fabulous!

This dish, along with the apples and a couple of nice side dishes makes a wonderful dinner. Better than the cilantro mashed potatoes was, we found, the potato green-chile gratin also found on the epicurious site. The port reduction compliments the pork perfectly. We made the pork roast, apples, gratin, and a salad for a large dinner party, and everything came out well. Plus it was possible to plan things ahead and not be cooking when the guests arrived! Mexican chocolate icebox cake (also epicurious) was the desert. Hooray for epicurious! We'll definitely make this again.

awesome! takes some time and planning ahead, but is so worth it - i also made spicy cilantro mashed potatoes as a side and the whole dinner was great -

I've made this several times, always to rave reviews - and you can't have too much of the jus - it's almost better than the pork itself! Also, in case you have any leftovers of the pork, they are great in the Georgian Pork Stew recipe, found here at Epicurious. (I've only had leftovers once, when I made about 10 pounds of this for a big party.)

I found the flavours to be a little bit much. My guests enjoyed the menu (served the pork with the apples, mashed potatoes with leeks and a salad). The port jus was very good but I did reduce a little longer and thickened it a bit. Overall, it was a good recipe but not one I'll likely make again. I love pork and just found the spices overpowered the meat too much for my taste.

A perfect autumn recipe. Served with Mashed Potatoes with Cilantro and Roasted Chilies and Southwestern Caesar Salad with Chipotle Dressing. All were excellent!

Have made this several times, each time winning rave reviews. I also served cilantro mashed potatoes with it the last time, but was disappointed with the potatoes, as they were bland. Made a great backdrop for the port jus, though. My guests were floored at the combination of sweet-hot with the apples, which are a must with this recipe. Definitely a keeper.

This is fabulous. I made it with the cilantro mashed potatoes as suggested by another cook. While the whole menu was time consuming, the techniques were simple. I really liked the sweet and hot combo in the apples, I only had chipotles in adobo sauce and it was fine, We also had a nice salad , and dessert was homemade angel food cake with fresh strawberries and whipped cream.

I made this as a congratulatory dinner for my best friends Graduation. It was fabulous to say the least. Easy to make. I did however spice it a little more and reduced the sauce longer for more thickness. I would definately serve this again.

Tried this last night with the chipotle apples - in a word... YUM. I reduced the sauce more than I would have given other reviews that said the sauce was thin - the result was simply heaven. Note: there was a little too much cumin in the rub for my tastes.

This pork is to die for delicious. I used just a loin, not a tenderloin and it turned out well. I sliced it very thinly. I served it with the equally delicious "Southwestern Caesar Salad w/Chipolte dressing".

I am rating this recipe as an eater not as the chef. We were having company & I had to work late & my husband made this. I LOVED IT & SO DID THE COMPANY!!! I think he went heavy on the cumin..so it had a great buzz nicely balanced by the apples. A repeat for sure! My husband thought the recipe should call for the sauce to reduce longer (too thin in his opinion)

This recipe was a hit, even with kids. I had a bit of problem roasting the pork as the pan started to burn...I just poured some chicken broth and was able to add this sauce to the port jus which enhanced the flavor.

It's always a good sign when your guests "lick" their plates clean. And that's exactly what they did-all 7 of them. This is probably one of the best meals I've had my whole life!

I served this to our "gourmet" dinner group of 8 last night. They went crazy over it and the men were especially fond of the port jus. Definately would not make less of the jus as some suggested; we barely had enough. We omitted the chipolte peppers as some would not have been able to handle the heat. It was great just the same. We will all be making this again soon.

Very tasty - a good Fall or Winter dish. However, I found the Port Jus ended up being too much for a three pound roast. You could get away with making half the amount.

These dishes with the cilantro mashed potatoes will be one of our favorites for family and company fare. I will probably lessen the amount of chili pepper slightly as the combination is very spicy and as my husband says : If you have chapped lips one would not enjoy this great food as mnuch. A sorbet for dessert would calm the mouth.
