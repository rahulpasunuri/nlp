These were pretty good, but next time I will look for a recipe without vinegar.

I made these for Thanksgiving, and they were wonderful. Got raves from my guests, and reheated wonderfully. Nice simple recipe with lots of flavor. Mine tasted very sweet and I can't imagine adding more sweetner, as some reviewers did.

This receipt has become part of the canonical meal required of me on Thanksgiving Day. It is tough to bring a new recipe into the meal I make on that day, but the kids loved this first time!

As a somewhat serious home cook who has the range of 40+ foodie siblings to a vegetable hating 3 year old to please at christmas, I had to give this all 4 forks. I cracked a lid on my sautee instead of the wax paper round and I probably didn't really cut properly (one time I made this using a bag of babies but the product was lacking flavor) but no matter, the core flavor of this is good. I've done variants with ginger et. al to amp up the flavor/pair better with other dishes as well. I never add any additional sweetener like honey because I just loathe anything sweeter than the carrots + applecider reduced, but that's me -- I'm sure it could stand up to that if you like it sweet.

These were okay but definitely not worth the extra effort. In the end, they were simple glazed carrots. I did the funky cutting thing but I really didn't get the point.

This turned out very well, and ignore all the brouhaha about the carrot slicing. Have some fun with it, or just cut however, they will still be delicious. I haven't tried it yet, but suspect this recipe would also be good w/ sweet potatoes cut pretty small. I made this on an evening when I was craving carrots but making the leek & brie quiche from Bon Appetit (6/97 p. 29, but not on this site), which seemed to call for some greens. So I served the carrots over some greens on the side. A nice mix, though a little dry. Better would be to up the liquid ingredients a little and remove a few spoonsfuls as "dressing" before the final reduction. FYI, I made 1/2 the recipe.

So, I took one for the team here and followed this recipe. The cutting technique wasn't so bad, really, though I can be kind of a dolt at these degrees of turns, I just turned the carrots a quarter turn per cut, and while probably not perfect, turned out quite lovely and not so harsh looking as just a straight cut. I did cut the butter in to bits, it only took a few seconds out of my life, and seemed to make sense as it was more spread out through the carrots as it melted instead of one giant glob. The only variance from the recipe was that I used parchment instead of waxed paper and added a splash more vinegar because I really love apple cider vinegar. Nor did I measure the salt and pepper into the dish, but I just added to taste. The result is quite delicious and better than most cooked carrot dishes I normally make. It's a keeper.

these were so easy and so yummy. i did take a short cut and just cook the carrots with a regular pot lid on for 30 minutes and then took the lid of and reduced the sauce for another 10. perfect.

I finally MADE this recipe & used the roll-cut method, which was veru EZ & made for an impressive presentation. I cooked everything in one pot, sans wax paper & used wht pepper (instead of black). The end result? BORING! I added a 1/2 tsp ground cardamom & 1/2 tsp ginger + 2 T honey & that did the trick!

Nice twist on those traditional candied or sugar-glazed carrots. Even my picky NYC transplant friends would eat them. And yes, most of us on this site are not professional chefs and don't really care about the cut being professional. The cut described is interesting, but this recipe does not deserve 1 fork from those reviewers who have issues with the cutting technique described. Please rate the recipe, not the knife skills of the writer.

While planning my Tday menu, I chose this recipe (which I have yet to make) but was so sad to find so many unkind comments here. It's so uncalled for. Isn't the world a horrid enough place w/o being mean about COOKING for crying out loud?

This recipe is fantastic!! The roll cut is not that hard and really worth while. It impressed our friend who is a chef. He wondered how I learned that technique... made me look like a pro :)

Certainly Kinnelon, the roll cut oblique would be 90de. Perhaps we shoude check that a l'etuvee technique, saute' in fat/oil then braised in a "small" amount of liquid". If they're good, so be it but there is till no need to cut the butter and certainly no need to oblique the carrots. A bag of babies is the way to go here.

These were great, the flavor of the carrots wonderful. Will be a keeper. Made exactly as recipe except purchased bag of organic baby carrots - who needs to go through all that slicing when busy preparing a holiday dinner - made the day before, warmed up right before serving and were great. No wax paper flavor! Only addition I made was to add a tablespoon or so of chopped chives for some color. Great way to serve carrots and add color to a Thanksgiving meal!

The roll cut is used to maximize the surface area exposed to the glaze. We use it in Chinese cooking 101. Beyond that: has anyone actually MADE the recipe? Speculation is one thing; I would appreciate the benefit of experience here...

Previous reviewers must lack a concept of classic cooking techniques? Aside from the error in the number of degrees to roll the carrot, the recipe follows a classic French sty0le of cooking called a l'etuvee. Try it, just make sure you barely simmer and your carrot are cut to the appropriate size. Test for doneness with a pairing knife. If it enters and exits a carrot piece easily they are done. If not, remove and reduce glaze then add carrots back and toss to coat.

That would be a half turn or 180 to produce a wedge shape. This technique is usually used in roasting to provide both cooked carrot and browned edges.

Yes, it appears that we're re-inventing the wheel again here. The vinegar should go in with the cider. I would also use parchemnt so I'm not eating the coating of wax off the paper and I would not over-cook the carrots by simmering them for 50 minutes! The butter does not have to be cut into bits... what the ??? for? it's gonna just melt as the cider warms up hugh? I've said enough.

Should that be 90° or 180° for rolling the carrot between cuts? 180° produces a log with both ends cut off at an angle so the cross-sections look like a trapezoid. Rolling it 90° produces an asymmetrical wedge that's much smaller. Which size is intended for the cooking time?

Simple recipe made complicated--"trape- zoidal log"--you've got to be kidding! And I passed math!

Question: the cider vinegar is added with the cider or at the end?
