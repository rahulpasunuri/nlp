This was a wonderful, quick and easy meal. I loved the basil/garlic sauce - it was very fresh and gave the veal a great kick (I added another clove of garlic and extra pepper). The tomatoes and squash were a great side.

This was pretty decent and actually did NOT need the suggested accompaniement (roasted garlic basil sauce). It would have been just fine without it. It did not seem to have a WOW factor, we will not be craving this dish next week. Perhaps, I was cringing over the cost of 1 lb of veal scallops. I need a category for quick, lowfat and not too expensive. Again if it had been fabulous, I could live with the cost.
