This was quick and easy. I had to substitute dried cranberries for the raisins, but otherwise I followed the recipe. Next time I would substitute a bittersweet chocolate for the milk chocolate as we love bitter chocolate, and perhaps try mixing candied ginger with the apricots. I think this is a recipe you could have a lot of fun with.
