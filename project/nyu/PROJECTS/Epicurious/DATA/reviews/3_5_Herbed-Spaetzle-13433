I made this with roast beef for an Octoberfest type party. It was good, but the parsley flavor was a little overwhelming for me. It was better as leftovers with brown gravy. Would probably make again with a variety of herbs or less parsley.

I was looking for a recipe I remember for crispy spaetzle. This is close. Instead of finishing in the oven, try frying the spaetzle until crispy.

Excellent and really easy. I don't have a spaetzle maker, so I just pushed the batter through the holes of a colander. I used the spaetzle in place of noodles in my favorite baked mac'n'cheese recipe. Delicious!

This is pretty good, coming from Germany I'm pretty familiar with spaetzle. Personally I prefer making spaetzle and mixing it with a simple cheese sauce and extra cubed cheese, place it all in a casserole. Brown a sliced onion in butter (until really dark) and place on top of the casserole. Heat through in a 350 oven for 20-30 minutes. It's a classic south German (Swabian) dish, sort of like macaroni & cheese. Another version is to do the same as I just said, but stir in a can of tomatoes - chopped. Simple and good - real home German cooking. To the last reviewer - you can get a spaetzle maker at any cookware store for about $15.

Want to try this for Thanksgiving. Please tell me what a spaetzle-maker is and where to get one. The recipe says see above but there is no info on it.

Very good with cured pork loin chop. Try tossing the spaetzle with a little chicken stock reduced with cream, whole grain mustard & spinach for a big flavored winter side dish.

A big hit every time I serve it. Universal appeal.

This recipe will accompany any meet, from fish to sausages (even lamb). It is a good departure from the traditional potatoes, rice or regular pasta. My friends were quite delighted when they tried it for the first time in their lives. I really recommend it. What I love the most is the twist over the regular spaetzle... this one adds color and flavor!!
