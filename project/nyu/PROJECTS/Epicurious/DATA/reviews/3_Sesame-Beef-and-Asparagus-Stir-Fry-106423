I give this recipe 4 forks only after some additions. I added garlic, red pepper flakes and soy sauce. I also marinated beef(I used tenderloin) in soy, oil, hoisin and garlic. Served with japanese noodles.

I also added some of the same ingredients as others (soy sauce, red pepper & garlic). I also marinated meat for 1-2 hrs. in hoisin,soy & sesame oil. I served it over asian noodles. Big hit with my wife & I.

Solid basic recipe and very quick to prepare. You can easily tailor the recipe to your taste (i.e. red pepper flakes, fresh ginger, etc). You can't mess this dinner up.

Very quick and easy. The sauce was a little lacking. I ended up doubling the Hoisin Sauce and adding a bit of Soy Sauce. Is a great recipe if you have an abundance of asparagus and have run out of ideas.

Thought this was great, although I did take some of the previous suggestions- I used garlic and a little worcestershire, as well as a dab of Barbadian hot sauce (it's great if you can get it). For the beef, I coated it for about an hour with coarse sea salt and cracked pepper, as well as a tiny bit if soy sauce. Good stuff, was a pleaser at the table.

I used ginger and garlic per the earlier recommendations, and I also used the Soy Vey marinade from Trader Joes instead of Hoisin sauce, and it worked! I also recommend marinating the beef in advance

I added ginger and garlic at the suggestion of other reviewers. I used a different cut of meat (tri-tip), Oyster Sauce instead of hoisin sauce (which I'm not fond of), and omited the water. The dish turned out favorful and I will be making it again.

While I made the additions suggested in the reviews, I still thought the dish was quite bland. I also found the sweet flavor of the hoisin sauce to be at odds with the savoriness of the beef and asparagus. I would make this recipe again, but would really spice it up with even more ginger and garlic. Perhaps a splash of Worchestershire?

The recipe by itself might be a bit bland. We added some hot oil to the vegetable oil, added garlic to the onions, an extra tablespoon of hoisin sauce, red pepper flakes and a few sliced mushrooms. It was very good!

This is very easy (and fast) to make... I have used broccoli florets when I didn't have any asparagus on hand and it was very good. I agree on adding the salt & pepper, plus I use chopped shallots instead of the red onion - it adds more flavor.

I agree with several of the other reviewers that the recipe is very bland. It looked so quick and easy and I was hoping it would be good but my husband absolutely hated it and I thought it was pretty lousy too. If I were to make it again (which I won't) I would suggest marinating the meat and adding ginger to give it more taste.

altered the recipe significantly based on previous reviews with great success. Added minced garlic and minced ginger (2 tsp each) with the onions. also doubled the water, hoisin and sesame oil because we like lots of sauce. extra salt and pepper added and passed the red pepper flakes separately so we didn't alienate our 5 year old. she liked it too. quick and easy meal.

really liked this recipe. My Husband said its a "do again". Just add additional salt and pepper to taste because it can be "bland" without it.

We thought this was a great midweek supper. Quick and easy. Noted other reviews, and added some fresh ginger, paprika and red pepper flakes to give it some spice. Threw in toasted almonds at end and served over steamed rice. Yum!

This dish was great. Had a nice subtle flavor. Husband loved it. Next time I'll cook beef first and not add as much water. Kids ate it too!
