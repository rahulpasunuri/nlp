Perfect just as it is written! I think the trick to getting this right is making sure that the squash cubes are nicely browned and the chopped almonds are well toasted. I used Meyer lemon juice and upped the amount a little, but adding anything else to the dressing would mask the other wonderful flavors.

I incorporated many other's suggestions and it was wonderful. Specifically, I added crushed garlic, dijon mustard, honey and finely chopped shallot to the dressing. I added dried cranberries to the salad and topped with crumbled goat cheese. Very yummy!

My family enjoyed this. The butternut has a sweetness that is nicely balanced by the lemon/olive oil dressing. I thought it was simple and delicious.

This is a wonderful and different salad. I particularly enjoy "composed" salads and avoid "salad bar" type salads. This salad did not dissappoint! The toasty almond flavor that the oil picks up while browning the almonds is wonderful and blends well with the fresh lemon juice. The dressing does require a bit of good salt (I used grey sea salt) to bring out the flavors of the lemon and almond. I was really impressed that a salad with only spinach, butternut squash and almonds could be so delicious!!! We will definitely make it again!

Our guests were pleasantly surprised by the use of butternut squash in a salad. I think the only thing that didn't go as well as I had hoped is the dressing. So simple and fresh, I expected a great hit. Most of my guests wanted a little more from the dressing overall.

oh yes, i do agree that the vinaigrette needs doctoring!

I tried this salad, and used some of the ideas from others. I liked using sage for the squash. But found that the dressing was not well balanced - far too acidic and not much taste. adding some honey and a bit of dijon mustard, and a 1/2 clove of crushed garlic greatly improved the vinagrette. I too used Arugula, but found that the baby stuff is not assertive enough. Next time I will use mature Arugula for a more aggressive bitterness. Dried cranberrries could be a good addition. This would be great in the fall with turkey.

I made this last night. Changed a few things which i highly recomend: 1) Used baby arugala instead of spinach 2) Used 50% pine nut 50% almonds 3) added curry powder and fresh sage to squash before cooking 4) added a bit of crumbled goat cheese to the salad. AMAZING!

The butternut squash in this recipe is wonderful. It is very flavorful and adds color to the salad. Wonderful flavors.

I agree about adding some shaved parmigiano reggiano at the end...this is a delicious salad with lots of flavor that doesn't need a ton of dressing. Next time I will use fresh lemon juice and maybe I'll roast some garlic with the squash. Also swapping walnuts for the almonds is a good alternative.

I really liked this recipe. I used acorn squash, and realized that I like it better than butternut, anyway. It's true that you end up with not a lot of dressing, but that's a god thing. I thought that it was just enough for a perfect coating of the greens. I may not have used as much greens as the recipe called for (it calls for a lot), which may have helped the dressing situation. It was still plenty of salad. I would be sure to add enough salt to the almonds and to the squash. I used some mixed greens as well as spinach, and the added bitterness was nice. My friend and I thought that is was a very interesting salad, but that it was missing a little something. My friend added shaved parmesan to hers and said that it was perfect. I would feel comfortable serving this dish to company again, especially because it has no vinegar, because some people don't like vinegary dressings. Overall, I think that this is a unique and delicious salad.

I only had frozen spinach in the house so I made it as a hot entree, and it's going to be a staple in my house from now on! Also, if you don;t like to peel squash, I find that steaming a butternut squash produces a tender enough skin that I can generally just mash it ( or cube it, in this case). Another time saver: nuke the almonds for 2 miute in the oil.

This is an awesome salad. People get excited when they eat it. And don't worry if the warm squash wilts the spinach a little bit, it's better that way (seriously).

I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it. I subbed walnuts for almonds and it was delicious. The cubing and baking of the squash makes this more effort than I would usually put into a salad but the raves from my friends made it all worth it in the end.

Very tasty. I seasoned the squash with salt, fresh ground pepper, garlic powder & drizzled a tiny bit of honey over the top. It was delicious. We brought it to dinner with friends & everyone loved it. There wasn't a morsel leftover.

I found this recipe in the Gourmet cookbook while searching for something to cook with butternut squash and spinach. It was amazing with such simple ingredients. My roommate and I loved it!! I will definitely make it many times more.

I've made this salad twice this week becuase I love it so much. Really very easy and the roasted squash is well worth the time.

This is a fantastic recipe and one of my staples now. The one change that I make is that I use kabocha squash instead of butternut (much richer & sweeter), and that the temperature for roasting the squash seems way too high - 350 works better. If you can't find kabocha, try butterCUP squash - nearly as good.

I really liked this recipe, and the toasted almonds were absolutely divine with the other flavors. We didn't have a butternut squash so we substituted a sweet potato, and even one of the Progeny who doesn't like sweet potato enjoyed this salad.

I would try this with a red raspberry red wine vinaigrette and pistachios, roasted and salted and leave them like that, instead of almonds and maybe add some chopped dried cranberries. Shaved parmesan or some other flavorful hard cheese would be another great addition. I love butternut squash roasted and the idea of combining it with fresh spinach. I think I would dust the squash with Goya's Adobo seasoning for more kick, too. I like the one with garlic, onion, cumin, and oregano but not chili for this salad. It has a green cap. Yumm!!

Due to the recent bad reviews, I almost didn't make this salad. But going back to the first reviews assured me. I'm not a nut person, so I was hesitant about the almonds, but I loved this salad. I used an acorn squash instead and it worked just fine. I also halved the recipe, but ended up adding more lemon juice to the dressing for more "kick". This wasn't a "knock your socks off" salad, but it was pretty simple and very tasty. Nice for a simple fall meal.

This dish is so delicious and so easy to make! I've also substituted the butternut squash with other types of squash and it's just as delicous.

Excellent! Guests love it - double it, because they'll all want seconds. Some crumbled ricotta salata is a nice addition.

This was a dud. Fixed it for guests and everyone passed it by or left what they took on their plate. Really this is nothing exceptional!

? To those of you who have made this salad - I would like to take this salad to a pot luck dinner on Monday - can I make the dressing ahead of time? Any suggetions would be appreciated.

I too used a little maple syrup with the squash, perfect. I also used hazlenuts instead of almonds which were wonderful. I did have to add some extra oil for the dressing but the end effect was just wonderful.

The dry portion of this salad was great, but I'm not sure what happened with the dressing. Perhaps the problem was my use of grape seed oil in place of olive oil. If so, don't EVER use grape seed oil in place of olive oil for this dressing. It was truly offensive. A balsamic vinegrette worked well instead, and dinner was saved. Would definately make this again (minus the dressing). You can't go wrong with roasted butternut squash.

Great taste, but a lot of work for one salad. I would only make for guests and not an at home meal.

This is a keeper for quests! I added just a hint of "real" maple syrup to the squash but changed nothing else. To the cook that wanted to know how to easily cut a butternut squash...put whole in a 350 degree F. oven for 15 minutes or so and the squash will cut easily and safely. Cut in half and peel. This works with any winter squash. Enjoy!

I doubled it - perhaps that was the problem, but there wasn't enough dressing to coat the spinach leaves even lightly....wound up adding more almond oil and lemon juice before combining.

This is a very delicious salad. I poured a bit of honey on the squash before baking it. Very light but still filling enough to serve as a main dish.

This a wonderful winter salad! To the cook in Corvallis Oregon--- Go to Trader Joes grocery store in Eugene, they have it already cubed in a bag over by the salad stuff. I also use that to make butternut soup. Go to www.traderjoes.com to help you find the store.

Oh my! This is absolutely delicious. I added some garlic powder to the squash before cooking. Yum. Does anyone know any tricks for easy peeling of the squash. I am still healing from peeler wounds.

A perfect salad in every way. Very healthy, interesting ingredients and texture, and very delicious. Received rave reviews from everyone. For presentation, I first put some cut-up romaine on the plate and then the spinach. Around the greens, I put some halved red and yellow grape tomatoes to form a circle. Looked great and tasted even better. A keeper

Packed with flavor and nutrients, just what we look for. Served it with Lemon Mushroom Risotto from Gourmet.

A wonderful main-course vegetarian salad! As a non-vegetarian, it takes a robust recipe to make me not miss the meat. This one absolutely does it. The squash and spinach compliment each other perfectly and the toasted almonds provide an almost bacony flavor. I might add a little blue cheese or perhaps shaved parmesean next time around, just for kicks...

The nutty squash and the almonds go quite well together, and are accompaied quite well by the spinach. I added about a tbsp of balsamic vin to my dressing and a tsp of sugar to give it more rounded flavour.

everyone who had this salad loved it. the combination of flavors was delicious. the almonds provided just the right contrast and crunch. i used organic baby spinach and it was perfect. the next time i make it i will make some extra dressing as i used more than 1/2 lb. of spinach.
