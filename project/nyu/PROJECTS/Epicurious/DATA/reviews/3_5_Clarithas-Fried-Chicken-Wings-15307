I have been using this recipe since it was published in 1998. When I want to WOW guests this is the recipe I use. I oven fry and use a homemade orange mustard wing sauce when I want wet wings. The end result is well worth the time, effort, and patience required of this recipe.

This recipe is my "go to" method for chicken wings. I don't need to "go to" it often as it is memorized. A few tips for those with salt complaints. First, make sure you are getting 16-18 wings in your 3 pounds. Anything smaller will naturally be affected by the salt. As for the salt. There are basically 2 brands of Kosher Salt that are common. They are Diamond Kosher Salt and Morton Kosher Salt. All of us chef types prefer Diamond. The crystals are larger than Morton making for a less salty taste and there is no anti-caking additive which, alone, seems to add a bitter taste. If you want to see the difference in the salt types, go to cooksillustrated.com, but Diamond is the one you want. Do not leave the wings in the salt longer than called for and be sure to rinse completely as you don't want any salt residue on the outside. If you follow the recipe as written with these few tips, you will not want to fry your wings any other way. Of course you can up the spices as you like, that is just personal taste. Do it right and you will love Claritha's Wings.

So good, I find myself making it again and again...

I have made this several times with thighs, not wings. My family enjoys them immensly though I will say that of late I am adding either more cayenne or a 1 tsp of Emeril's seasoning for a little more kick. Be sure to start a day early and with thighs, they need to cook about 15-18 minutes. Enjoy.

I had high hopes here but was very disappointed. On the advice of reviews, I used 1/2 the salt, even though I used coarse kosher salt. I rinsed them very thorougly. They were still TOO salty, and the meat was rubbery. I also thought the coating was too thick. Nothing special about these at all and a lot of work.

the test of good fried chicken is whether or not the skin stands alone ... claritha's skin stands alone and then some! try it exactly as written - coarse salt only, plenty of time in the buttermilk brine... perfection.

I suspect that most people who think these wings were too salty used table instead of coarse salt. As at least one other person wrote below, table salt is twice as salty as coarse salt. I just made this recipe as written and it was sublime. Delicious! Four forks but I can't figure out how to add those.

This is an all-time favorite. After making the wings many times, I found that my late mother's "chicken frying pan" (a Magnalite pan) worked the best. I even went to ebay and bought a second one of them. The wings fried very evenly, unlike the "better" pans I have at home. Terrific recipe!

My friends loved the chicken, but I thought it was a touch too salty and overdone. Having read the original recipe in Ruth Reichl's memoirs, I was a little disappointed. Next time I make this, I will definitely eliminate the salt in the flouring. The cooking time seems about right - but I learned that the burner on which I cook has definite "hot spots" (the right side of the skillet was much hotter than the left, so all the chicken on that side burned) so I will definitely watch the frying part much more closely. The meat also was pretty tough and not cooked all the way through, even though the outside was well-done (again,I attribute this to my stove and perhaps not turning down the heat enough).

I take A cook from Milwaukee's suggestions (4/30/00): cut back on the salt, added more cayenne (AND more pepper, I love spicy!), and used the flour mixture to make onion rings! Excellent, take it from a fried foods fanatic!

FYI, kosher salt cannot be substituted measure for measure with regular table salt. The crystals of kosher salt are much larger. Use half the amount of table salt when the recipe calls for kosher.

My husbnd thought it was too salty even after I rinsed the wings like the other reviewers said. Next time I will try it without brining.

Rating: 4
OK OK you can not handle the brine part. Too bad. A turkey is unbelievable when brined. Anyhow, try marinating the chicken wings in buttermilk with all Claritha's seasonsoning for at least 4 hours. Drain and then use buttermilk residue to coat wings in flour. No egg. Fry and enjoy as directed.

What is wrong with your reviewers? Do you ever try following the recipe first before altering it? The only fair criticism is about too salty--so remedy by rinsing after brining--too simple!! Egg wash--uck! Try it at least once Claritha's way!!!!!!!The delicate onion flavor is to die for.

My Mom made a version of this and she said it was the south that invented this recipe: Here it is yall, the real dealSouhern version fried chicken: Marinate the chix in salt brine for 2 hours before hand.In your egg wash , dip the bird. Then dip them in a seasoned flour mixture of Salt/pepper/pinch (or two) of cayenne pepper/paprica and a dash of garlic powder (not garlic salt) Fry in VER hot oil,covered, 5 min per side. Lower tewmp to med and continue to fry untill brown. True to my word, you will do it like this the best. Don't forget the vino! Stefano

My kids won't eat chicken skin or dark meat so I used breast with ribs. I pulled the skin off and marinated them in ziploc bag with buttermilk, 1 T salt, large onion rings, dash of garlic powder, onion powder and cayenne. The next day, after frying the chicken, I gave it an extra 15 minutes in the oven at 350, while I fried the onion rings. I dusted the onion rings with Kraft Parmesan. Adults and Kids thought it was great. Next time I think I'll leave the butter out of the oil.

Omigod! I can't believe how good these were! Having read the other reviews, I cut back on the salt also, but because I was making these with a young picky eater in mind, I didn't spice them up any more than the recipe called for. There turned out with a mild bite. Absolutely heavenly! I've always felt defeated in trying to make fried chicken before -- those days are over. I don't feel I can say enough about how great these tasted.

These chicken wings were good but I would definately use less salt next time. They were WAY TOO SALTY! Also I would add more cayenne pepper to give them a little more zing! I will defintately try it again.

I've been making this recipe since it first appeared in Gourmet. I used it on skinless chicken and turkey breasts. My family loves it and I always make extras for cold snacks and sandwiches.

These were truly wonderful, and worth the time, energy, mess and clean-up!! Next time I will make more so that I can share them with friends. Yum. I think adding some jerk seasoning to the mixture would help jazz these up. I prefer the spicy to the mild. :d

This recipe is great! The second time we made them, we cut back on the salt, increased the cayenne pepper and added more onions. Instead of discarding the onions, we floured and fried them along with the wings! A great treat while you're waiting for the wings to finish, as well as serving them.

I have made this recipie twice and love it! Though I followed the other reviewers advice and cut the salt in half the first time, and even more the second time, and added a bit more Cayenne -- much better. I also lowered the heat a bit to prevent over-browning. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

After anticipating making these chicken wings all weekend, I was disappointed in how they turned out. The buttermilk and kosher salt didn't tenderize them like I thought they would, and they browned way too quickly. They had a nice crunch, but they didn't knock my socks off! My kids weren't overly enthusiastic either. My daughter said they were a little too salty. In addition, they were too time-consuming and troublesome to make. I'm going to stick to my own chicken wings, which are much more succulent, flavorful and tender.

I've never made good fried chicken until now. My husband loves chicken wings adn thought this was terrific. I'll use less salt the next time though.

I've tried this recipe many times and they always are spectacular. For New Year's Eve I'm going to use this recipe to make Buffalo wings.

This is the best fried chicken recipe. I did substitute bacon greese for the butter, and added some tabasco to the butter milk.

The overnight marinade of onions and buttermilk is the secret to this recipes success.

One of my favourtie summer recipes. The last time I made it I only used 1/2 of salt for the marinating and only 1tbs for the dredging. That was more than enough.

I made these wings specially for my dad for Father's Day last year, who is always picking out Gourmet recipes from HIS magazine for me to cook! Although the recipe has several parts, spaced out over time,the overall preparation is actually simple. My dad and I are some one of the biggest fried chicken fans in the world, and we thought this recipe was FANTASTIC! The wings were very flavorful and crisp, yet very light. They've become a regular favorite when Dad comes over!

Best recipe I've found yet. My girlfriend, who normally eats like a bird, loved them! She had them for dinner, then for lunch the next day, and then again as an appetizer before dinner.

The wings stay nice and moist which they usually don't in other recipes. I will definitely have it again.

I wanted to love this recipe. I just finished (and really enjoyed) the book Tender At the Bone that contained the original. I used thighs not wings. It was tasty but not all that special and I had guilt pangs about all the fat.

Don't be fooled by the cute story behind this recipe or the exotic (?) ingredients (buttermilk, kosher salt, black peppercorns); this is a comparatively average recipe. Two things I would recommend to help present a cooking disaster. Watch the cooking time carefully. Following the recipe's 18 minute cooking time is guaranteed to result in burnt chicken. Also, cut WAY back on the salt. The recipe calls for enough salt to de-ice the New York Thruway in January.

We tripled this recipe for a dozen people. It's a lot of prep work, but well worth the trouble! The worst part was having to share! We're making it again.... this time all for us!

I personally don't care for wings & neither does my husband. I'd make it again with boneless/skinless chicken breasts. My husband likes my fried chicken because its not too greasy. So now I have a new one to try. Thanks
