Loved this. I've become a big fan of potato salad without mayo this summer. This is one of the best. Could cut back the oil a bit....I also used a dry rose as the wine because that was what I was opening for the meal. It was fine.

This is a nice alternative to mayo-based potato salads. The hotter the potatoes are when you mix in the herbs, the more flavorful the end result. In my opinion, this is four star flavor, but some people I served it to thought there was too much wine. Next time I would cut back.

Absolutely delicious. Made it for a party, was a big hit with everyone who tried it. I used Yukon Gold potatoes with a combo of small purple, red, gold potatoes. Left some peel on, but the purple ones had to be completely peeled, skin was too tough. Omitted the eggs, used small amount of basil & parsley for herbs, as I do not like the flavor of tarragon. Will definitely make this again.

Made this for Easter dinner and people raved. I asked for honest reviews, which I hope I got, since I'm also making it for a wedding reception in 3 weeks. The only negative (maybe) comment I got was "it was really good but not really potato salad" but then we live in Alabama where everything has mayo. I boiled the wine down with the various onions as I do in one of my favorite broccoli salad recipes and that worked nicely,especially since the only white wine I had was pretty poor quality. Couldn't find tarragon so I used parsley but I think that the tarragon would be much, much better. The only change to the recipe I'd make would be to increase the amount of dressing on the potatoes, I think that there would have been more flavor if I had done so.

I was looking for a potato salad recipe without mayo and this is a winner. I made it exactly as written. Somehow the combo of white wine, olive oil and mustard makes the most delicious dressing. The onion, scallions, garlic and fresh herbs round out the flavors. A definite keeper. This would be great for summer picnics as no refrigeration issues.

I just want to say that everytime I find a recipe for potato salad which is not drenched in mayonnais/miracle whip etc. I try it - I have my own Viennese one with variations which is always commented on with wonder. How come mayonnaise is not needed?

Excellent! Hats off to Jacques for a great recipe.

Perfect. Made with parsley and cooking sherry because I had them on hand. Can't wait to try it with tarragon, but it's hard to imagine it could be better.

This was definitely a hit. Served with speidies. The only mod I made was to substitute red wine vinegar for the wine, since I didn't feel like opening a bottle for such a small amount. I used a spicy/peppery mustard which gave the salad a good kick, and plenty of fresh tarragon, parsley, and chives from the garden. I also tossed some blanched green beans with some of the dressing, which was a nice addition of color and texture.

This recipe was a hit. Made it for a bbq/dinner party and everyone loved it including myself, and I don't generally care for potato salad. I followed the recipe except that I doubled the scallions and cooked the onions slightly longer than called for. I did not peel the fingerling potatoes to save time; I was careful not to cook the potatoes beyond the point of just tender so they held their shape even though they were cut up into 1/2" pieces.

This was really, really nice. I served it warm with a hard boiled egg per person with simple arugula/ green leaf salad. It was hearty and satisfying and light at the same time. Tres bien!

This was delicious! Much better than the mayonaise coated church picnic potato salads my guests were expecting. It was a big hit! The recipe says to serve at room temp but it was much better and less runny when chilled overnight.

This was a nice change from traditional potato salad, but I found the wine taste to be a little overwhelming.

Simple and easy! I am a procrastinator so I was pleasantly surprised to find a potato salad that did not need to sit overnight in order to have good flavor. Was delicious at room temp the day of. I made it and forgot it until it was time to serve.

Oh la la! I hate potato salad (you know, the kind drenched in Miracle Whip and other abominations) but this sent me to carb heaven! It's simple, fresh, and perfect for a summer meal. I had to make one adjustment. For some reason, I could not locate fingerling potatoes so I used instead multi-colour mini-gems (red, white, and purple). Also, I used just half of the dressing as I found it was more than enough to flavour the salad. I always have to remind myself that a recipe doesn't have to take 10 hours and 60 ingredients to be amazing. This is a keeper!

Very simple and delicious. Made it for a BBQ and it went quickly. I used basil and chives from my garden and a dry white wine. Good to know about the white wine vinegar kflister, but I would not leave a bad review for a recipe I made a mistake in preparing...

I didn't have the recipe in front of me and used the white wine vnegar. Don't!! It was too bitter. I had to add sugar to take away some of the bitterness.I thought it had to many herbs. Hopefully it will be better when it chills overnight.

Great recipe! I used basil, but will try with tarragon, too. I roughly peeled the potatoes after cooking and recommend peeling as skins intrude on texture. The recipe says to serve warm, but I thought it was even better chilled the next day.

For such simple ingredients, the sum of the parts was really excellent. The fingerlings were worth getting, although I think you could skip the "decorative" step of peeling part of the skin. I wonder if white wine vinegar would be good.

I have made this recipe for years - being sure to use tarragon as one of the herbs. It is a fabulous side for grilled meats, chicken and salmon. I've never had any left.
