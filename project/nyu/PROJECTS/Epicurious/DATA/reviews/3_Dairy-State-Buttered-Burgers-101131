Butter must be in the meat as well as in the bun. Best butter burgers, Solly's Grille in Glendale, WI (on Port Washington Road - down from Kopps). If you're in Milwaukee, make the trip -- $5 for the 1/3 lb cheeseburger and you'll need cardio paddles for resusitation. Too hell with my high cholesterol!

Great recipes, reminds me of home. Another reply to the cook on 8/28/03- I grew up in WI, but have since lived in the South and East. Believe me, there aren't any more overweight people in the North than there are anywhere else. You shouldn't make such a rude comment when you obviously have no idea what you are talking about.

This is sooo Atkins. Come on, Molly McButter, get with the program. Low Carb is healthy for your body and you lose weight. Just omit the bun, butter the burger and YUM!!

this is a very good recipe for any burger lover...if I changed anything about it I would first toast the buns slightly for crispness

Very Good recipe, reminds me of great burgers from Kill Devils Beach Fries and Custard... YUM and I agree to putting butter on while cooking. Enjoy!!!

I agree, put the butter on the meat while cooking. To the cook on 8/28/03: We are rating recipes, not how much Americans weigh. You must be a very unhappy person.

Now I see why most Americans from that region have weight problems. Why on earth do that to your heart? Molly McButter anyone?

I live in Maryland and miss Kopp's burgers. Culvers is not even in the same league as Kopps. I agree with other reviewers, put the butter on the burger while cooking

I'm not sure about the "butter" burgers, but burgers from Kopp's Frozen Custard is much better than any Culver's. Kopp's adds a pat of butter on their burgers as well.

If you're ever in Wisconsin or Minnesota, Culver's has the best butter burgers! You'll taste the difference if you try one. I suggest toasting the bun first, then slathering it with butter. And, yes, they do put lettuce and tomato (and ketchup, mustard, mayo and pickles) on them. I'd love one right now......

I am also from the Midwest and I agree with Milwaukee. The butter should be placed on the burger and melted into the meat while it cooks. It makes the meat moist and flavorful. Buttering the bun just gives you a buttered bun.

I couldn't taste the difference between this burger and any others.

When I make a butter burger I put the butter on top of the patty so it melts into the meat.(not on the bottom bun as the recipe suggests) I'm from Milwaukee and rarely do I see people eatting butter burgers with lettuce and tomatoes. Use more butter and less veggies!
