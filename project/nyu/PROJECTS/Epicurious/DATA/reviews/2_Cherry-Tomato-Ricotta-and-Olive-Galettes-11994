We prefer the asparagus and goat cheese galettes which use the same crust, but these are okay too. They have less of an original taste than the asparagus ones--they taste a lot like pizza. I make the dough before I go to work and let it chill all day. I have also learned to simplify the baking. I just put the toppings on and bake for 15 minutes. I have made these more than once already and would consider making them again in the future.
