Fabulous dinner, made exactly as written and paired with pearlized couscous with roasted garlic, olive oil and roasted pistachio nuts. Added a glass of chardonnay. Truely an outstanding dining experiece. From this hard to please foodie, definitely 4 forks!

Totally agree with the last reviewer - this recipe is so good as is, I didn't make the glaze and didn't miss it. The husband and I thought it was really delish, will be making again!

Very good, very quick! Made this twice, and it comes together very nicely. Forgot the balsamic glaze the first time, remembered it the second time. You may find you don't even really need that, as the spinach bed with the olives, shallots, and raisins really provides enough "other" flavor for your taste. It was good even without the honey balsamic glaze, and didn't find that it added all that much, but you be the judge!

My sister was convinced she didn't like salmon after experiences with the canned stuff... but after making this, she's in love. We serve the salmon on a bed of raw spinach and use the glaze as a dressing. Great fast dinner! I also made it for a head-turning lunch at work, sans the shallots and over jasmine rice.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I am a beginner-level cook, and wanted to cook something delicious and healthy for my bf and me for V-day (gag, I know). This was delicious, easy and still interesting! I used two 5-oz. bags of baby spinach and it was the perfect amount. The salty-sweet combo of the olives, shallots and raisins was delicious. I made with basmati rice with toasted slivered almonds and the combo was great. Will definitely try again, even if cooking for myself.

I would definitely make this again--even my husband who is not a big fan of seafood liked this! The flavors are so unusual and blend beautifully

You can never have too many Salmon recipes in your repertoire... this one is simple and amazing! Love the salty-sweet combo of the olives & raisins. I simplified it even more. I had a bag of mixed greens I needed to use, so I tossed them with a very scant amount of vinaigrette (Newman's Own Olive Oil & Vinegar) and skipped the spinach step. When the salmon had a minute or so left to cook, I just threw the shallots, olives, raisins, balsamic and honey in with it and finished it all together, then topped the greens with it (I removed the salmon skin before cooking). Served with a baked sweet potato, drizzled with a little bit of the glaze. Awesome flavor combo!

This was very tasty especially for the short amount of time it took to pull it all together. This will definitely be put into the weeknight rotation. It might even be good enough for company.

Wow! The flavor was amazing! My bf isn't big on salmon, so I just swapped it out for chicken tenders. He said "I didn't think healthy food could taste this good" lol. I also only used 1/2 the spinach and it was plenty for both of us. Loved it!

This dish was absolutely delicious, healthy, and super easy to prepare. I did not alter the recipie at all and did not find the reduction to be too sweet as other people have mentioned. The spinach, shallots, kalamata olives, and golden raisins is such an amazing combination that it is good enough to be its own side dish. The timing instructions for cooking the salmon are precise for a 1 inch thick piece. While it's nice that this dish only requires one pan, I would have preferred 2 pans so that everything could remain the same temperature when served.

My family loved this, especially my 13 year old daughter. I didn't have golden raisins so I substituted regular raisins. I will definitely be making this one again....quick, easy and healthy!

Easy to make but the result was kinda lame. All in all, I really didn't care for it. There are better salmon recipes out there.

Easy and delicious. I discovered I didn't have balsamic, so I substituted white wine vinegar. And I was glad I did because it's already plenty sweet with the raisins and the honey, and I think the white wine vinegar added a little tartness (though the glaze didn't thicken as much).

Unfortunately, this was not a hit at our house. Made as suggested, but used a tangerine based balsalmic vinegar as part of the finishing sauce. Overall I would have preferred a garlicy saute for the spinach instead of the sweet/savory. I liked it 2 stars, my hubby threw his out. It was simple to make, but not interesting enough to try over.

Great dish and exceptionally easy. I added a pinch of salt to the spinach and a tad more balsamic--it cooks down quickly. Will make again.

This was pretty good. It came together quickly and had a good balance of ingredients... get your fish, vegetable, and fruits all in one meal. However, it was much sweeter than I'm used to eating in a main course. Still not sure how I feel about that, not certain if I'll be making it again, but I enjoyed trying it out

This was a wonderful combination of flavors. I made it exactly per the recipe. It's quick and light, great for a late night dinner. And do include the suggested couscous with toasted pistachios.

The spinach was delicious. Like many others, I did some substitutions - used onions for shallot, had a mix of green and black olives that I pitted myself, and very plump black raisins instead of golden. And, I just realized while writing this review that I never made the vinegar/honey glaze...oops!

Its a good quick and easy dinner. I particularly liked the spinach preparation. Made it once wouldn't make it again though. So many recipes so little time.

This dish was fabulous and both hubby and teenage daughter loved it. I didn't have the olives, so I substituted capers.

I liked this, more than my husband, who, too, is afraid of 'weird' things like olives and raisins. But I really liked the sweet and savory - although you can overdo it with the honey, as others warned. But given the health and relative ease of this recipe, it's a keeper.

This recipe was quick, easy, tasty, and healthy. We sauteed the spinach in lemon olive oil and the lemon flavor really came through and added a lot. We'll definitely make this again!

Was looking for a quick and different salmon recipe for a solo dinner...with spinach to use up: agree with previous reviewer about the balance of salty/sweet and quite liked it...with no shallots or raisins in house I did a quick substitute of fresh pineapple dice and red onion and it was still a great flavour combo, next time will be faithful for comparison...I am not a fan of cooked spinach, preferring it raw, nor am I a sweet main fan and found it surprisingly tasty and very, very simnple to prepare on the fly. Will definitely add to my repertoire!

Pretty good salmon recipe...very good for a rushed weeknight. Like another reviewer said, the spinach was the highlight of the dish. Not sure how I felt about the balsamic-honey glaze (though it wasn't bad). Could easily substitute any homemade compound butter, beurre blanc, or just a touch of butter and orange/lemon zest/juice. Extremely healthy too, which is an obvious plus. Overall a legit but not WOW quick dish.

Rating: 3
I thought this was good but way too sweet. I made as directed but added a few splashes of wine before adding the spinich. When I make it again, I will not add the balsamic glaze or the honey. I'm thinking just a little lemon and butter would be far better.

This was fabulous! One dish was great but in the future I will grill the salmon with some of the glaze. The spinach is the star of this recipe...off the charts good. My husband,who has a dislike of "wierd food" i.e. raisins and olives in spinach; loved it. Will make again for guests!

I really liked the idea of just one pan & it was fairly quick. The spinach was really delicious. The salmon steaks I purchased were a little too thick & had to add a little water & a lid to get them to cook through. Also, next time will add more seasoning to the salmon.

This is a simple and easy meal. I didn't have any olives, so I used capers, instead which worked just fine. I would add orange juice to the glaze next time, though. I served the salmon/spinach with quinoa cooked in vegetable broth topped with toasted pine nuts.

Good not great salmon recipe. I would cut down on the Kalamata olives. This was quick and easy to make though.

I made this for dinner last night and it was absolutely fantastic. I followed the recipe to the "T" and it came out exactly as described. We will definitely add this to our regular dinner rotation.

Very good weekday meal. I didn't use quite as much spinach and it was still plenty. Werved it with couscous and pistachios, as suggested, and it was a good side dish.

Rating: 4
Very good. I would have liked even more of the glaze, but maybe I reduced it too much. I had more spinach than I needed, but I also didn't cook it too much, so it didn't become a much smaller amount like spinach can. I halved the amount of olive oil and served it with mashed potatoes.

Hard to believe you need this much spinach, but it worked out perfectly. The Salmon is beautiful on the bed of spinach, raisins, shallots and olives. The glaze takes a bit away from the beautiful brown color of the salmon, but the flavor was outstanding. We served with the couscous/pistachio side and it added wonderfully to the look and taste of the meal.

Superb! And easy. I made it as directed except for using a smaller amount of spinach than called for and sauteing with the shallots, raisins and olives. The sweet, tart and salty flavors were perfectly balanced. It was wonderful with the glaze. We served it with a Pinot Noir.
