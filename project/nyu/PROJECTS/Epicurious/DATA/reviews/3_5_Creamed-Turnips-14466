Delicious! the white sauce would be excellent in creamed spinach, collards, etc. I used salted butter because I know white sauce can be bland. I always grate a good quantity of nutmeg to inhance the flavor.

A little bland but a simple (and slightly unusual) side dish.

This was quite good. A basic bernese sauce that has been kicked up a little. The swiss cheese suggestion made it extra gooey!

I made a big hit with this at our family Thanksgiving meal in 1997. I also prepared the Roast "Chrysanthemum" Onions from the November 1995 issue of Gourmet. Everyone, to my delight, continues to talk about these dishes! They have become "must-haves" every year!

The delicate essence of the fresh herbs and spices in this recipe will turn the heads of most anti-turnip people. This is a wonderful vegetable dish to serve with a roast of beef, turkey, veal or lamb.

I have made this recipe several times. The sauce is very good. I have also used the sauce over pearl onions. This sauce is great for creamed onions.

add a handful of cubed swiss cheese to this and no one will know it is turnips!
