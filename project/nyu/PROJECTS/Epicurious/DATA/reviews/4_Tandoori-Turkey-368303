I don't like turkey much, but I do love Indian food so I decided to give this recipe a try last Thanksgiving. Absolutely the best turkey ever. So good, in fact, I made it again this month. Tender, flavorful. The turkey is mildly infused with the Indian flavors -- especially the skin. The gravy is super flavorful. You'll have plenty of garam masala and tandoor masala left over -- the garam masala is especially good in the Salmon w/ Indian Spices and Raita on this site.

I was encouraged by the reviews, so I made this turkey this Thanksgiving. I use masala frequently in cooking, so I was familiar with making them, and I'm sure I'll use them up. Roasting the turkey in a bag made me nervous, too, but it turned out fine and as other reviews noted, very moist. My main disappointment was that for the amount of work and spices and yogurt, etc., it tasted fine. But it wasn't like the meat was really infused with spice flavors or anything like that. So while I would totally make other side dishes "Indian," I don't think I'd make this again.

It took some courage to substitute this for the conventional T'giving turkey, but we did, with great success. Followed the recipe, making the masalas two weeks ahead and testing them on a chicken w/ good success...but the turkey was even better. Marinated it for 24 hours. Cooking in the same bag worried me but it all worked just as specified. I used the convection setting on my oven. Served w/ fluffy mashed potatoes, a citrus and mint salad, the gravy (absolutely delicious, cooked down a little) some fresh green beans spiced w/ shallots and lemon zest and a butter lettuce salad w/ cranberry viniagrette. Made a traditional dressing, but it couldn't stand up to the other flavors. Open to suggestions. An homage to (East) Indians on Thankgiving was a hit with our band of fam & friends.

I'm not necessarily a turkey lover - but this turkey got rave reviews was absolutely phenomenal! Super moist breast meat, and flavorful throughout! I'd definitely make it again, over any other method / recipe that I've tried so far.

It took an act of faith to go to this trouble, that and way too many boring roast turkeys. So to make it work I made the two masalas two weeks ahead of time and did a trial run w/ a chicken...yum. As usual, details matter, and I missed one, turning the turkey over to make it breast side up when I baked it. Couldn't see inside that oven roasting bag with all the yogurt marinade-so the drumsticks were a little over cooked. I did everything else as directed-exactly and it was a HIT, even for the most tradionalists. And I'm looking forward to leftovers this year.
