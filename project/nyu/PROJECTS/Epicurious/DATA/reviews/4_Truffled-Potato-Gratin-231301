Wonderful. I made a couple of revisions. After simmering the garlic, peppercorns and thyme in the cream, I put it through the food processor and did not strain it. The flavor was just great. Used jarred black summer truffles. I will make this again.

Simply Terrific! Worth every penny! Used a black truffle paste instead of sliced whole and tossed a drizzle of truffle oil on each layer. Skipped the straining step on the cream. From 4 to 64, everyone devoured it!

As Sarah from Chicago wrote, can I substitute truffle butter for the truffles ?

I would rate this a half fork higher, as I did not quite fully deem it a full 4 forks. To change it I would cook the entire portion of cream with rosemary, as the flavor was so wonderful with that, but could stand to be a little stronger. ( I had black truffle in the jar and it was not as flavorful) I served this dish with rib~eye steaks with red wine sauce, and also a mache salad with pear and a white balsamic vinaigrette. My brother told me the meal looked like it could grace the cover of Gourmet, which is high praise coming from him! My husband also enjoyed the meal tremendously!

If you go for black summer vs winter truffles you'll save yourself about $50. http://www.gourmetfo odstore.com/truffles /summer-black- truffles- truffles.asp? mscssid=4VB81WBTRSQE 9NCVVKU0B2DF1F1C83C9

It's time consuming, but one of the most wonderful potato dishes I've ever made. Everyone loves it.

I want to make this, but I have a question. Can I substitute truffle butter for the truffle? I am just not comfortable spending that much for the truffles.

This is an awesome holiday recipe. It takes some time but the result and taste is great. Make sure to use a large baking dish as the heavy cream has a tendency to bubble. Use fresh truffles if you can find them($$$$)

This was an average recipe - nothing special except the truffles. I was expecting much more.

Fabulous and very easy!!!! I cut it in half as I was serving a smaller group and it turned out great! Easy and the most flavorful gratin I have ever tasted. I did use more truffles just to make sure the flavor was rich. I served it with the Bacon-Wrapped Beef Tenderloin with Herb Stuffing...huge success with my guest!
