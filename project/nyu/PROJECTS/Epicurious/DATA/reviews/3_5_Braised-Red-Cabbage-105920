FANTASTIC! This was one of the highlights of our Thanksgiving meal. Not only did it add a beautiful splash of color to the plate but the slight tang and crunch helped to break up the otherwise rich meal. More than one guest said it was their favorite dish! So easy to make and twice as delicious. I can't wait to make this again and again throughout the winter.

Brought the taste of home (The Netherlands) to my kitchen. Very easy and very tasty. I did not have to add or subtract anything and for once followed the recipe to the ml and it came out wonderful.

This is the third recipe I've tried for red cabbage and it was both easy and delicious. My only change was omitting the bacon and cutting the recipe in half. It had a perfect balance of sweetness and acidity and we ate every last morsel. Served with pork chops and baked potatoes.

This is an absurdly easy and remarkably good side dish. A perfect mixture of sweet and tangy. It will definitely become a part of my regular rotation.

I'd never made red cabbage before at home before - this was easy and delicious. Like other reviewers, I omitted the bacon, and thought it didn't need the extra fat. I used about 1/4 c apple cider vinegar and 1/4 c red wine, though I added some white wine vinegar and sea salt towards the end of cooking to bring out the flavors a little more. I thought the blend of sweet and sour was perfect, not too strong - but it's worth starting with less vinegar and then adjusting as the cabbage cooks. Word of warning: this makes A LOT of cabbage, so be ready to feed 4-6 people with it, or eat it for a week ...

I've made this dish a number of times and I can say it's always been a hit. My husband is German and red cabbage is a very popular dish in Germany. Every time I've made it for German guests, they've raved. One guest even said it was the best she's ever had. Enjoy!

This was delicious. I used about a 1/4 cup rice vinegar and 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar, plus a splash of white wine.

I am perhaps the greatest chef on the planet and I can say with authority that this braised cabbage is good, but not great. Next time, I will substitute a bit of white wine (perhaps a Chardonnay) for the vinegar which, in the end proved a wee bit strong.

This was really good. I add some red wine in place of some of the vinegar, and use sugar substitute if making it low carb. I omit the butter, seems to be enough bacon fat to do the job.

This was delicious. I made it with a braised Silver Palate ham for New Years Day. I used a little sugar and red wine vinegar when cooking the onions, as if carmelizing them ... and then added another splash of red wine vinegar to the cabbage. Cooked it for about 50 minutes, and it was perfect.

Simple and delicious. I had to change the proportions a little bit as the head of cabbage I had was nowhere near 3.5 lbs. But it was really delicious, hubby was raving. Served with a simple pork tenderloin recipe also from this site. It's a keeper. I'm craving it again already.

Too sour. I prefer my red cabbage sweeter.

I left the bacon in as I sauted the onions. I also added some chicken broth and a handful of leftover frozen cranberries and a splash of cream sherry. Very tasty. Reminds me of the cabbage I had with venison tenderloin in a small inn in Germany. I will be serving with roast duck tomorrow night.

This side dish was a hit. Everyone at the table was unsure they would like it and as it turned out they did. I made it as a side dish for a roast pork loin twice and both times people asked me for the receipe. A good addition to a meal of pork or chicken.

We really enjoyed this dish at my house. Unlike the other, I did cook it for the whole amount of time. I think the cabbage carmelized - it made it so worth the time!

It was easy and delicious. I did not use bacon to be a bit healthier. I added 1 tbs of honey and I cooked only 40 min. It became a wonderful accompaniment for roasted pork tenderloin.

I haven't made this yet, but I'm planning to. Is is really 1 tablespoon salt? I never add that much to anything!

As good as it gets. Did not have to change anything except I did not cook it 1 3/4 hour. I cooked 30 minutes and it was delicious. It is wonderful with lamb. I think the sweet taste compliments most lamb dishes. Ro WIlliford

So glad I read Chicago's review before cooking this dish. His/her suggestion to reduce cooking time was right on the mark. Even more important though, was the goat cheese crumbled on top. Wow! That addition takes an ordinary side dish to new heights. The soft, tart goat cheese somehow cuts some of the sweetness of the cabbage. I highly recommend it. Served at Christmas with a roast goose and roasted potatoes.

Totally declicious! I found that I didn't need to cook it so long (only about half an hour) and still had amazing flavor.

Made this trying to duplicate something I had in a restaurant and loved. Ended up with a duplicate of the restaurant dish using this recipe with ingredients as written with the following variations: 1. Cut the cooking time by about half--was going for an "al dente" version not quite as soft as red cabbage is usually served. 2. Then served it with crumbled goat cheese on top. Was just like what is served with grilled meats at the Bandero Restaurant in Chicago.

I like to make this recipe with chopped Granny Smith apple and substitute apple cider vinegar for the white. A great sweet-sour dish!

I added a little too much brown sugar, but the sweetness was still good. Cabbage the way it should be.
