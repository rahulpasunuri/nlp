Hosted a dozen Hungarian-born guests last evening and they raved about the authenticity of this recipe's flavor. The only modification I employed was adding 2 finely diced anchovies. This is a terrific spread which freezes well.

I was pleasantly surprised! What a nice change from your average appetizer. The flavors are delicious and the dip has been a huge hit. Pretty easy to make.

This is a pretty good rendition of liptauer. I live in Austria, where this comes from, and it's made with "topfen" which is a cross between cottage cheese and cream cheese. I would use a mixture of the two instaed of just cottage cheese. Also, even though it makes it more fattening, the butter is part of the original recipe. You won't find it in Austria without it.Liptauer should be a little sharp, so I suggest using a mix of sweet & hot paprika or a few drops of tabasco. Also important - LOTS of chopped chives!

This has become one of my standards when I have company. I use smoked spanish paprika instead of the sweet hungarian which everyone found delicious. I'm addicted to this stuff.

This is very similar to a spread that has been in my family for generations. The butter is totally unneccessary here and the onions HAVE to be green and be chopped fine. I would also not recommend using light cream cheese. Regular tastes much better in this recipe.
