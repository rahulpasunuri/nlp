To reduce fat, I left out the butter and sprayed pan and in the pistou I used very little olive oil. I topped w/pistou and sour cream. It's the pistou that makes this 4 forks and my husband said it was as good as any five-star restaurant.

I made a healthier version of this soup by eliminating butter and only spraying pan for the soup. For the pistou I decreased the only to 1/8 cup. Otherwise, no changes except some white pepper, and topped with a dollop of fat free sour cream and sprinkling of crushed red pepper. Very pretty.

My husband loooved this soup, especially with the pistou. I liked the soup much more without the pistou (and I generally love pistou). I wasn't paying much attention and added only about 1 tbsp of butter with about 1 tbsp olive oil. I do think my soup could have benefited from a bit more butter (3 tbsp?) without the olive oil. I used small yukon gold potatoes and didn't bother to peel beforehand. All in all, we liked the soup. Next time I may add a little more salt and include a bit of garlic.

Wow this is the best summer squash soup -- lots of flavor and richness. We enjoyed it equally without and with the pistou. For the soup I reduced the butter to 4 TB and added chopped garlic. For the pistou I used basil instead of parsley. I will definitely make the soup again and again. No need to fear the over abundance of summer squash growing in my garden with this great soup! Great soup for family and for company.

The perfect summer soup for friends and family who are lactose intolerant. A favorite

With all the good reviews, I had high hopes. However, I was not very impressed. I thought it was okay, but far from the best use of summer squash I've had. My boyfriend couldn't even eat it. Without the pistou, it was bland. With the pistou, it was just not very tasty.

7-6-11: WOW. The big wow is that when I tasted just the soup by itself, I thought it was a bit bland, and needed more salt at the very least. Then I swirled a generous blob of the pistou into it. To me, it then became absolutely to die for. I am now a lover of pistou. I will now make pistou all the time. Pistou, pistou, pistou. And here's the kicker  I didn't even use parsley because our herb garden was way low on that, but was brimming with oregano, so I used that instead. Nor did I have a scallion, so I skipped that. But the result was divine. Also my fresh mint leaves from a few weeks ago were now dried, but I measured them the same way, and it worked great. My husband thought the taste was "interesting," and I think that's because mint as a savory herb is not for everyone, and I wasn't at all sure it was for me, until I tasted this. I thought it was absolutely gourmet, and beautiful. Big sprinkling of black pepper on top is also recommended.

i thought the soup was just okay when i tasted it alone. then i added the pistou & it was so delicious!

Delicious! My family loves this soup, the Mint Pistou gives the soup a little punch of pizazz. I had lots of summer squash from the garden so made two extra batches and froze them. I needed a quick dish for a friend, this heated up and tasted as fresh as the first day I made it. Whipped up some fresh Postou and they loved ot too.

What a surprisingly delicious soup! We reduced the butter to 4 Tbsp and the soup was still so rich and velvety.

This was, as previously stated, very delicious. I am not a mint fan and I thought this soup would change my mind based on the reviews. However, in the end I still preferred the soup without the pesto. Maybe my ratio was off but the pesto was a bit too minty. I agree with other reviewers that you can definitely cut the butter down in the beginning. I made it with 5 TBSP butter and it was very rich... next time I'll cut it down to 2 or 3.

I had a lot of squash from the farmers market and decided to make this soup for dinner. It exceeded my expectations: it's far richer than one would imagine, and delicious.

I rarely get back to rating recipes, but I had to comment on this delicious soup. Who would have thought that mint would taste so great with yellow squash soup? Besides providing color and texture, the mint pistou adds wonderful layers of flavor to the velvety soup. The pistou is an integral part of the recipe, so please try it. I finished the soup with a little cream at the end, and I added 10 roasted cashews to the pistou at the end of the blending process. These ingredients enriched an already great recipe. Suggest this for a dinner party first course. Your guests will rave about what an ingenious cook you are!

This soup is simple and delicious!! You can enjoy it cold or warm with or without the pistou (which took me a bit to realize was French for pesto). The pistou definitely gives the soup a more complex flavor.

I LOVE this soup. It's summer as I write so I enjoy it cold. I omit about a tbl of the butter and the potato to save a few calories and I certainly can't tell that anything's missing. Make no mistake--this soup would be nothing without the pistou!

Very simple and delicious! Nice contrast of flavors with the pesto, not at all too minty as I had feared. I served it with some homemade croutons sprinkled on top for a little texture. I will make this again and again!

Absolutely fabulous! I would definitely serve this as a first course to guests. I used my hand held immersion blender, easy and safer. Made recipe exactly as stated and pleased.

I cut the butter to 2 Tbs. and it was still incredibly delicious and a great way to use overgrown squash. It was great on its own but the pistou really makes it different.

I used Earth Balance, and a little less than the 6 T called for. The soup came out very creamy, delicious, and filling.

Excellent soup! I used less butter and added some water at the end. It stands on its own, but the pesto is a nice touch...great presentation when entertaining!

I don't have a food processor--any suggestions on how to do the pistou without one?

This soup is amazing and so easy! Perfect as a first course when there is company for dinner (don't leave out the pistou!). For those avoiding dairy, this can easily be made with non-dairy margarine. You won't find a creamier non-dairy soup!

This is so good! I added some leak b/c I had some. Instead of the pistou, I used some parsley pesto which I already had made in the frig (parsley, walnuts, garlic, parmesan, olive oil). It was delicious -- the pesto worked really well. The nuttiness of the pesto worked really well with the squash.

It's very nice, but I don't think all the butter - or even the chicken broth - is necessary. I make a butternut squash soup in the winter with enough water to cover the squash and just enough butter to cook the onions. It turns out extremely rich and flavorful. I'll do that next time I make this soup.

Decided to try this after visiting the local farmer's market. It was a great hit!! Friends who dropped by said it was the best soup they had ever had.

definitely pretty, and tasty. but I would not skip on the pistou cos the soup itself is pretty bland. I did cut a bit on the butter (to 1/2 stick). would do again.

beautiful smooth texture- I would just cut down on the salt overall especially in the mint pistou

This was elegant - understated but definetly delicious using all the season's freshest produce. My husband thought there was cream in it. Very good without the pistou - but with the pistou it really pops. I thought about adding cumin and hot pepper because the ingredients seemed rather bland but it did not need it at all. Enjoy!
