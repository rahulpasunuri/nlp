The recipe was phenomenal. I served with a wild rice and diced beets tossed with wilted beet greens. If you are using fresh horseradish, it isn't overwhelming to follow the recipe and use the full 1 1/2 cups. If using prepared horseradish, it's going too strong.

This was really excellent. The horseradish and salmon flavors combined perfectly with the well-seasoned beet sauce. Here's my suggestions to clean up problems with the original recipe: 1. Don't bake the ginger with the beets and garlic. It got hard and dried out, even though I had added a little water to the baking pan with the beets. I discarded this dried out ginger and added fresh grated ginger to the beet sauce at the same time as I added the balsamic. The ginger flavor is an important part of the sauce. 2. The amount of horseradish given in the recipe is ridiculous. I used 1 1/2 Tbsp. of prepared hot horseradish and that was plenty. 2 Tbsp. would have been okay, but anything more than that would have been overwhelming. 3. After cooking the salmon for 2 minutes on each side on top of the stove, I baked it at 375F for 6 minutes. Any longer or any hotter would have destroyed the salmon. 4. Remove the salmon skin before serving and garnish with sprigs of fresh thyme.

The beet sauce is incredibly good. It is sublime. If it were just the sauce I'd give four forks. But, the amount of horseradish in this recipe is way way over the top - it overpowers both the salmon and the wonderful beet sauce. And I LOVE horseradish. You could cut the amount of horseradish to one quarter of what is called for. The other problem I ran into is the length of time you are told to bake the salmon. After searing for two minutes on each side, salmon fillets certainly don't need 12 minutes in a 425 oven. Five minutes at 375 is quite enough. I think with these changes this recipe is definitely four fork, and I will make this again.

This dish is nothing short of amazing!

Was disappointed after reading the exceptional reviews. Thought it was time consuming and wasn't impressed with the flavor of the beet sauce. Wouldn't make again

Made this for my wife and she rated it as a "keeper". I liked it too and I'm not a great beet and horseradish fan. I used prepared horseradish rather than the fresh grated n=and just reduced the amount. The beet sauce was a nice balance to the horseradish. Very tasty.

I made this for Christmas dinner this year and my family liked both the flavors and the festive red color of the beets. I would recommend grating the horseradish as finely as possible since I tried it with larger pieces and found the texture unpleasant.

I made this for a guest who, upon taking the first bite, said that I should be cannonized.
