This is great vehicle for dealing with leftover cornbread. I served it with braised chicken with apples and sage. Think of this like polenta, you can serve it with lots of dishes.

This was okay, but came out way too sweet. Here's the thing: The recipe calls for a package of cornbread stuffing, but doesn't say whether to include the "spice packet" that comes with those cornbread stuffing mix. So I didn't include it, and I probably should have.
