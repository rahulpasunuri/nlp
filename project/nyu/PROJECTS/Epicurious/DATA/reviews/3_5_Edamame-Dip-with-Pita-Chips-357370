Very tasty! Best fresh and room temperature/warm. If you must make ahead of time, leave it out of fridge to warm up before serving. Add more cooking liquid as necessary for lubrication; don't over-oil. Also add salt & pepper to taste. A must for parties--it's something different!

Loved this healthy version of dip. The kids ate it too. Added roasted garlic and also salt. Definitely need to add the reserved liquids too. Ihave made it several times, and my friends really enjoyed.

All you need is cheese .... I added about 1.5 oz. Pecorino Romano, cut into 1/2" cubes, to the processor. Also used at least 1/2 c. basil and a splash of hot sesame oil. Kept adding olive oil through the feed tube until the consistency was right. Not as healthy as the original recipe, but the people at my party scraped the bowl.

Boring. Had to add numerous ingredients to make it tolerable. Garlic, extra lemon juilce, hot cayenne, and plenty of salt and pepper are a MUST. I wouldn't bring this to a party, but we still ate it. On the upside, it is very easy/simple to make and very healthy.

I really love this dip! I've made it several times now. The first time I made it as written and found it really pleasing--but, I love clean, pure flavors and I love edamame. Lately, I've been making it with a little more basil, a tablespoon or so of garlic, and the juice and grated rind of 1 fresh lemon. It seems to have more mass appeal that way.

I really like the concept of this recipe, but I would add in more flavor and garlic to up the taste factor.

Recipe is bland and tasteless as is. Requires a lot of extra seasoning. I brought it to a party and it was the only bowl at the end of the party that was still almost completely full. I added extra salt and lemon to give it more of a kick, but it needs much more than that to bring this dish to life.

Very easy and tasty recipe as written, but I'll maybe try a little more lemon juice and a tiny bit of garlic next time just to punch it up a bit.

I made this for a party and it was good, but it lacked flavor. Next time I will sautee some minced garlic and add to processor and then season with worcestershire and hot sauce to taste.

I couldn't find shelled edamame, so I just boiled the ones in the shell and shelled them myself which was still easy and didn't take up too much time. I followed the recipe exactly and only needed to add 1/4 cup of reserved liquid. Came out delicious and will definitely make again.

Easy to make, perfect as is. I only required 1/2 cup total of cooking liquid.
