This was a really nice salad. Nice and light, but the combination of the dressing, slightly bitter greens, and fresh herbs made it really flavorful. There was no frisee at the store, so I substituted escarole. Still worked well.

Instead of buying each of the mixed greens, I combined a box of mixed greens (with a lot of the same ingredients listed here) with the listed herbs and added the dressing - it was great, and easier than tracking down each of these greens separately.

This is a great, easy salad with a great dressing. I thought it was a bit strong so I added a bit more olive oil and honey for honey Dijon dressing. Yum!

I really liked the contrast of the dressing with the sharp greens.

This dressing is tasty, quick and easy. Definitely tangy - a little goes a long way!

I actually only used the dressing portion of this recipe for a different salad and it was phenomenal. My husband wants me to keep making it, he liked it so much. I only had regular dijon but the flavor was still pretty zippy, and I added a tablespoon of chopped capers. Very, very good.
