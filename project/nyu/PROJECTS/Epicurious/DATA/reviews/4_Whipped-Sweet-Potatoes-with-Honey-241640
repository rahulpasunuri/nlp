Mmmmmm. Threw these in the lower shelf of the oven to roast while the ham was cooking. Simple and absolutely delicious.

This really was very simple and is delicious without a lot of sugar. I did substitue butter with Earth's Balance (making it with a Kosher meat meal). I roasted the potatoes for 2 hours and they were very easy to open. I think peeling is a misleading term. You really just need to cut them in half and dump out the insides. I scraped out the rest with a grapefruit spoon. I did not add as much honey because my potatoes were fairly fresh and sweet.

I've always been a bit resistant to sweet potatoes, but decided to try this one anyway. The roasting, while simple, seemed to take forever (longer than the approximation in the recipe), but it was worth it. I used some local orange blossom honey we had on hand, and it turned out just right. My "bottomless pit-tummied" boyfriend loved them, and actually found them to be quite filling. We had some leftovers of them that needed to be eaten before I could cook again, so he ate the leftovers for breakfast, with some brown sugar and a handful of the vanilla-scented granola (also from this site) I had made earlier in the week. He was surprised that it could be both dinner side dish, AND breakfast...

I'm glad there is a recipe here for the rest of us, who haven't always "done ours this way". This method couldn't be easier, I roasted the sweet potatoes along with the pork loin. I didn't add the honey, and they tasted just lovely. Next time, I would like to try the lime juice.

One of those things I don't see much reason to have a recipe for. We've always done ours this way, with a dash of cinnamon, and I don't think anyone ever thought of it as a recipe. It's just basic preparation. On that note, it is a tasty way to prepare them, and very easy.

So good, and perfect with the baked ham and kielbasa I served on Easter Sunday. Make sure the potatoes are really well-baked before preceding with the rest of the recipe

Simple but good. My kids like a little brown sugar added in, adults seem to like cloves or brown sugar as is. Went well with ham.

Very simple dish to make. Followed to recipe exactly and it was excellent. Got rave reviews from my guests. Made it two hours in advance and kept it warm by leaving the covered potatoes in a glass bowl over a pot of simmering water. When I make it again I will make it a day in advance. This should be a most popular.

Very good and easy. I microwaved the potatoes and added less than a stick of butter and honey to taste with a touch of salt. Refrigerated with plastic wrap for 2 days then placed in baking dish. Mixed 1/2 c brown sugar, 1/3 c flour, 1/3 c melted butter and 3/4 cup chopped pecans (ran out but would have used 1 cup) and sprinked this on top. Baked at 350 for 30 min and this hardened into a nice crunch. Was well received.

I agree - it can't be a Most Popular recipe with ONE review
