Great stuffing. Got rave reviews from my guests. I felt it could have been more moist so for future reference I will be adding more broth or cooking inside the turkey.

I haven't made this recipe yet but wondered if anyone had tried it in a slowcooker. I had a stuffing recipe last year for the slow cooker that I loved but can't seem to find. Wondered if I could add additional liquid to this one and adapt it. Only having 1 oven calls for some creative thinking!

This has been our families favorite receipe since 1992. I use 1/2 lb. of Italian sausage & 1/2 lb. of Hot sausage, 1/2 c. toasted pecans & 1/2 c. roasted chestnuts, 1 c. orange craisans - soaked in orange juice for 1/2 hour before hand, 1/2 c. dried curants soaked in sherry 1/2 hour before hand, & 1/2 c. dried apricots. For those who like moist stuffing just add a 1/2 c. more broth at a time until desired consistancy - Just delicious!

This stuffing is easy to make and delicious. I have made it two years in a row for Thanksgiving and will probably make it again this year.

Rather dry, and we like moist stuffing. We also felt that there was too much pork sausage in the stuffing.

Not bad, but kind of plain and dry if you follow the instructions as written. I wish I had read through all the reviews before making it and added some dried fruits and/or nuts.

I was looking for a simple stuffing receipe and happened upon this one. I read through the previous reviews and took to heart some of the suggestions (adding more chicken broth). I also chopped up two boiled eggs into my version. I'm from the south and we have eggs in our stuffing. My husband and kids loved it. I will definitely make this for Thanksgiving to take to my mother-in-law's. I do agree with one other reviewer, this is a great base recipe!

I tried this twice, once T'giving and then revised (more broth) at Xmas.I am voting on behalf of my family - all say - please, never again!

I think it is interesting that the recipe is rated so well, but it seems like no one followed the recipe! I, too, made the dish, but revised it a bit (based on previous suggestions) and it was the best stuffing we've ever had! I added an additional 1 cup of chicken stock, 2 chopped apples and raisins...excellent! This is a great base recipe, just get creative and add what you want!

I have made this several times and everyone likes it a lot-I did cut down the corn bread and stuffing-made on 8x8 of the cornbread and approx. 2 c of the stuffing mix-used almost all of the broth and it came out very moist-baked it in a casserole and uncovered it the last five minutes-came out really good.

I am a semi-vegetarian so I omitted the sausage and substituted veggie broth and followed a recommendation I found suggested below: add 1 c shredded parmesean, 1/2 sleeve of Ritz crackers (I used reduced fat variety), and 1 pkg Craisins. I am in a dry climate and 6 c. of vegetable broth was the bare minimum. This has become our new family standard. Very flavorful and attractive to serve.

This stuffing was great I added 2 eggs and a granny smith apple. I didn't have the poultry seasoning so I added Old Bay Seasoning. Fab

I have made this many times, but I always tweak it a little. I feel that it needs some sharpness, so I add a oregano (dried and fresh) and some fresh parsley. A little (1/2 tablespoon into the sauteed veggies at the last minute) finely grated lemon zest also helped alot. I used this recipe a launching pad. Oh, I always use about 4 cups of stock. It's too dry without it.

I enjoyed this recipie however I would add a little more broth to make it not so dry...also I always mix one half sweet italian sausage with one half hot...there isn't anything to compare...we have an older gentleman who makes it fresh once a week if you get to his deli on time and order...store bouht is fine if you find the kind that you like

Good place to start, especially if you're trying to do it quick and easy. You will probably want to add more broth if you cook it outside the bird but it's perfect stuffed in the turkey.

Perhaps I should have added more broth, as others recommend. My stuffing was sort of dry and didn't really come together in the way that I like. The sausage great but the rest of the stuffing was just so-so. I actually would have preferred more celery and more onions!

Wonderful stuffing - I will be making it every year for Thanksgiving from now on.

I too added more broth,VERY EASY and tasty stuffing.

This is the basis for a great recipe. I start with this, and add to it a cup of dry parmesean cheese, a half a sleeve of crushed ritz crackers, another cup of chicken broth, a cup of crushed peacans, and 2 cups of Ocean Spray Craisins (dried cranberries). Trust me, its fantastic. Additionally, once I have cooked the sausage, I throw it in the food processor and smack it down a few times to get a better consistency throughout the stuffing. Bottom line, start with this and experiment a bit. There are many things you can do to customize this dish to your liking. Enjoy and Happy Thanksgiving everyone.

This was a pretty good stuffing overall. I'm not a big celery fan so I halfed the amount of celery and still thought it was too much. I'll probably omit the celery next time. Not bad though!

Great recipe. I read the reviews and added more broth and it was perfect. I have a friend that still raves about this stuffing. Will definitely make for Thanksgiving this year!

Reading several comments that the stuffing turned out dry, I added a half cup more of chicken stock to the recipe, which produced a moist, delicious stuffing that almost disappeared among our seven guests. It's easy and scrumptious and can cook while your turkey is cooling.

I added some dried apricots and baked it separately. My guests were delighted and asked for the recipe...

Great stuffing. Better than others I've tried from this site over the years. It was delicious and, best of all, easy. The only change I would make would be to add a LOT more broth to the stuffing in the baking dish. It was definitely on the dry side (maybe I should have left the foil on the whole time it was in the oven). The stuffing inside the bird was just right.

I made this for Christmas dinner. A few people loved it, some thought it was just OK. I thought it was a bit dry. Not a family favorite for future dinners.

Outstanding! My Thanksgiving guests just raved and didn't leave much for the next day.

Last year was the first year I made homemade stuffing. I searched and searched for the perfect recipe to impress my family. I tried this one and it was a hit. Everyone loved it. It will be a yearly tradition from now on.

My family always argues about which stuffing to make - now we finally agree - this is THE stuffing to make at our house. Plus the recipe makes lots so everyone gets enough.

I've been making this recipe for about 4 years now and it is always a hit. One year I even added some jalapeno pepper to it. It has not become MY traditional stuffing, although I cook it outside of the bird.

Excellent! You can add toasted pecans to this (about 1 cup) or even 1 can sliced water chestnuts. I've made variations of this recipe for years, and have always baked it in the turkey without a problem. Sausage stuffing is the only kind I make anymore. Feel free to add more seasonings to your taste!

I knew someone from the South created this recipe before I saw the address! This calls out " Thanksgiving" and "Christmas Dinner". So many times these great recipes are lost to the younger generations. Thank you for sharing! My family always cooked this in a separate dish for safety sake....
