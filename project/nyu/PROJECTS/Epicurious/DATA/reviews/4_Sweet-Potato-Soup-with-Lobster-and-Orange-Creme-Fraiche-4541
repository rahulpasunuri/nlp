This was SOOOO good. Made it for Christmas dinner and everyone raved about it. Tasted like restaurant quality. In fact, made most of this menu for Christmas dinner. Everything was awesome. People asked me how I was so daring to make new recipes without trying before serving, and I explained I based it in the ratings. Epicurious has ALWAYS steered me right!! This one wont let you down.

I served this as a first course for Christmas dinner. I halved the recipe and made the soup and creme fraiche 2 days ahead of time. It was fabulous!! I served with a CA chardonnay; bliss!

made this twice and enjoyed it very much. made some changes the 3rd time around. used greek yogurt thinned with milk instead of creme fraiche and omitted the ginger, putting it in the soup only. also, omitted the brown sugar and replaced butter with olive oil for the sweet potatoes. changes made to make it a bit healthier and still thought it was delicious.

This is the best soup I have ever had! The main three elements (sweet potatoes, creme fraiche and lobster) are all very rich. I would recommend it for a starter rather than the main entree. The creme fraiche is delicious although I did find the ginger overpowering as others have mentioned. Next time I would use ginger powder or paste instead. One of the best recipes I've made and will definitely make again.

The soup and Crème Fraîche are delicious but the lobster makes the soup spectacular! This is a keeper - both with and without the lobster. The lobster makes it a special occasion soup. I keep making up special occasions! ;P

Just made this for Christmas dinner and everyone loved it (even the picky eaters). Followed the recommendations and omitted the lobster, but the broth was rich and flavorful so I agree with others in that I suspect it would have been completely unnecessary. The creme fresh was a wonderful, delicate addition. My husband (who has hypersensitive taste buds) felt the ginger was a bit overpowering, but I thought it was perfect. Wouldn't change a thing. And I loved that it was easy to make! Made it all a day ahead, heated and served. Perfectly delicious!

A lucious soup, very luxurious yet very easy to make. I've made this every year for Thanksgiving since the recipe came out. The only change I've made is that I cook and serve the lobster chunks separately, so people can choose to add it to their soup or not. Hint: I do cheat with the lobster and just buy a couple of frozen tails.

Delicious and easy. I used crab meat but definitely think the lobster would give it a better touch.

I made this when it first came out in 97 and maybe 3 times since. I am making it again this weekend for a dinner party. I used to get fresh lobster from family in MA. but now I just use lump crab meat. It works just as well. And it is easier to get good quality crab meat than lobster here in PA. One year I used vegetable broth so I could serve my vegetarian friends. It was still very good. they asked for the recipe.

Rather unusual soup which tastes absolutely fine without the lobster, creme fraiche or parsley. Though I did put a small daub of sour cream and zested a little orange over each bowl, I didn't think they made a difference. The parsley overpowers and detracts from the flavour of the soup. Add if you like some color contrast or an additional flavour, but go easy on it. My sweet potatoes were a little fibrous and didn't blend up entirely. I would strain the soup in future.

I served this soup as a first course for Thanksgiving. I will make it every year, it won rave reviews from a family of 'foodies'. After reading other reviews I left out the lobster, it wasn't missed. I made the soup and creme' fraiche 2 days ahead and heated it right before dinner, turned out beautifully. I served it with whole wheat cinnamon pita toast points and floated a candied pecan atop the creme fraiche, a perfect start to a holiday meal!

I just test drove this soup as a possibility for Xmas Eve and while it is a lovely soup, I felt like it could have used less orange juice. I made it exactly as directed, using pure organic juice with no added sugar, and the orange flavor was a bit overpowering. It's good but not something I want to eat a big bowl of. Unfortunately, it doesn't really serve my more casual intent this holiday but I would probably make again as a starter for a formal party. I would serve it in a shallow bowl with a couple of seared scallops in the center and I'd skip the orange/ ginger creme fraiche in favor of plain.

Excellent soup. I made this tonight for (Canadian - yes they are heathens to have it so early) Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow and it is spectacular. Even my sweet-potato-loathing (Canadian - so I don't get hate replies) husband loved it. Cannot comment on the creme fraiche, as am using store bought for tomorrow, but the soup alone is sublime.

pluggedin2, get over yourself -- we all make mistakes, and experimenting with a recipe is a great way to make it "your own"; that's what these comments are all about, after all. Sizzlingseven, thanks for the tip about crabmeat -- many members of my extended family prefer it to lobster (they're from Maryland), and I will try this recipe with good crab for them.

I don't understand the review from sizzlingseven. What two week old leftovers? If you used crabmeat instead of lobster, you didn't follow the recipe to the T. And fraise is French for strawberry.

A small dinner party last night with this soup as the entree. The guests were enthusiastic about it, I was relatively pleased. After reading thru all the comments (which I ALWAYS do before selecting a recipe), I left off the lobster. The texture was quite good using a blender but I did feel it needed "something"...so I added a bit of splenda (sugar substitute) and some cinammon. Perhaps my sweet potatoes weren't sweet enough on their own, who knows? The addition perfected the soup. I did not, however, care for the creme fraiche. It did make the presentation more interesting but I didn't like the flavor of the ginger. My guests enjoyed it, so I supppose it's just my own dislike of that ingredient.

I prepared this today for dinner tomorrow. I will forgo the cream fraiche as the soup is wonderful as is - when I serve it I will sprinkle a bit of lobster in the middle for presentation. This soup has a unique sweet flavor. I did omit 2 cups of liquid, used 2 large cubes of veggie broth, 4 c. water and 4 cups of chicken broth (it is what I had) I pureed with a hand blender - very easy.

oh my gawd! amazing! everyone loved it! even my daughter (16 mths) loves it - including two-week old leftovers! easy, full of flavour, followed the recipe to the T. Used crab meat instead of lobster. My Advice: put the meat in the soup bowl FIRST, then pour the soup around it, then put small dollops of the creme fraise around it. I did the creme fraise first, then when I put the meat in, it ruined the nice design on the soup. Do not hesitate in making this soup - my husband doesn't even really like soup and this was stellar! thank you!

This soup is fabulous! I did not include the lobster and made it as a first course for our New Years dinner. Our guests thought it was amazing! I will definitely be making it again!

(This is my first Epicurious review) I made this soup as part of Christmas dinner 2005, and have to agree with the other reviewers who loved the soup but not the garnish. When I first tasted the soup, it was a rare case where, as prepared according to instructions, it was absolutely perfect. It needed no seasoning or improvement whatsoever. The creme fraiche, however, was another story. It was entirely too bitter. The orange overpowered the ginger and was too, too bitter. I hoped it would mellow as it mixed with the soup, but no. It messed up an otherwise good thing. Also, the lobster was rather pointless. It was simply an expensive garnish. PS: I'm a former professional chef and felt so strongly about this recipe that I'm posting my review on Christmas Day, right after dinner.

Absolutely divine! I, too, prepared this soup without the lobster and served it as the first course at a dinner party. Everybody raved about it and I got several requests for the recipe. I will make this often!

The four-forks is for the dish without the creme fraiche and lobster. It made for the perfect starter for a fall dinner. My family devoured it. The creme fraiche came out a bit bitter, so I didn't serve it.

I live in Paris and invited a french chef to my home for dinner last night! Served this soup as a first course without the lobster and he left asking for the recipe. He could not believe this american girl who can not cook made this delicious meal. I used homemade chicken broth and added extra broth at the end to thin. I also gave a small amount to my french neighbor who also cooks and she too was astonished and asked for the recipe. I gave them both the site address!

We loved this soup, which has a lovely creamy texture. The orange creme fraiche was the perfect topping. I wanted the soup to be a bit thicker, so I did not use all the broth as I was pureeing it in the blender. Like many others, I omitted the lobster.

Isn't there a better rating? Five stars..maybe six. This is CRAZY good. I did not add the lobster, but did add a bit of nutmeg...and topped with candied pecans. NOT A DROP left after a huge Thanksgiving dinner...requests for the recipe came flying in. This is a keeper. Thank you, thank you, thank you!

WOW! This is a really flavorful soup. As other reviewers, I did not include lobster and agree - you do not need it. I did add a little extra orange zest because I love orange; it mixed perfectly with the soup. Both my husband and I are not fans of sweet potatoes but, we LOVED this recipe.

Fantastic soup. Everyone loves it. Simple and elegant. The lobster is completely unneccessary. I prefer it without. I use a handblender and blend everything right in the pot. Saves a lot of time and mess.

This was delicious. I think the lobster is unnecessary, but, to cut the expense, I used half the lobster called for, sliced it, cooked it in butter, then diced it and put a spoonful in each bowl. My husband thought it was needed for texture. I thought the soup was great without it.

This was my first course for Christmas Dinner one year. Also the first time I cooked an elaborate dinner. My boyfriend loved it and compared it to soup served at one of the top restaurants in town. Have made it again and will keep making since it's awesome!

I've made this twice, once with the lobster and parsley garnish and once without. It is much better without. The first time I served it at a party without the lobster guests raved. The second time served with the lobster it got a ho-hum repsonse - bowl came back unfinished. The lobster, while interesting, detracts from the soup and the parsley, while decorative for presentation, took away from the flavor. Your best bet - pipe the cream fraiche in swirls for the a lovely presentation and skip the lobster and parsley.

Excellent! This was the first course for Thanksgiving & our guests agreed it's superb. The creme fraiche is a great counterpoint to the sweetness of the soup and the briny lobster. The orange is subtle in both taste & fragrance and adds a surprising note. Next time I'll probably add - maybe double - the ginger, but I'm a ginger fan. It definitely didn't overpower anything at this rate. One guest is allergic to shellfish & she said it's also great without the lobster. The most time-consuming part of this recipe is pureeing it. Otherwise, it's a snap. Won't hesitate to make it again.

Very good! An interesting way of having sweet potatoes with Thanksgiving or other holiday meals. I am serving this as a first course this year instead of candied yams with dinner. We will likely do this again next year and maybe at Christmas!

Tasty, but in my opinion not an optimal use of lobster. The soup is well flavored, but I thought it overpowered the lobster, and would overpower any seafood that wasn't strongly flavored.

One of my all time favorite dinners. This soup is amazing as a first course or dinner with salad. The full meal (Christmas in the City, Bon Apetit- Dec 97) with this soup, Beef Tenderloin and Scalloped potatoes is stand-by.

I served this for a formal dinner on Christmas Eve. It was gorgeous and elegant, just the look and feel that I wanted! I omitted the lobster, but swirled the creme fraiche with a skewer and the results several guests deemed too pretty to eat! The leftovers were great several days later. It can easily be made 3 - 4 days ahead with no loss of quality!

Wonderful recipe! I served this to my family on Christmas Day. It went over even with nonsweet potatoes fans. I made the creme fraiche with light sour cream and it turned out perfect. I cooked the lobster tails in the microwave. They were just as moist and tender as the steam method but a lot easier and faster. Definetly a great presentation for a formal dinner.

Indescribably delicious!! I've made this soup many times now and am able to prepare it pretty quickly. It has become a regular dish for Thanksgiving dinner and is great even without the lobster and/or creme fraiche. I even forget to add the ginger sometimes and everyone still raves over it. A few tips to make it easier...I use baking pans instead of baking sheets (easier to stir the potatoes midway through). I also line the bottom with foil, and after roasting the potatoes I just grab the 4 corners of the foil towards the center of the pan, and easily transfer the potatoes from the foil to the pot. Instead of using a processor or blender, I use a Braun hand mixer to puree the soup right in the pot.

Just Fab! Used for my Y2K celebration and got raves! I used YAMS, not Sweet Potatoes (there is a difference!!!) and also increased the ginger and orange zest in the creme fraiche considerably. Lobster didn't really do much for me. Next time I'd use shrimp or scallops. Made ahead it stores beautifully and reheats beautifully. Will Definately Make Again!

I made this with scallops as a first course for a fancy christmas dinner. Using low-salt no-salt stock is A MUST. I inadvertently did not, and almost didn't serve it. But, then I used the potato trick, added a bit more orange concentrate and ginger, and it balanced out nicely. The creme fraiche was essential as well. Fine recipe.
