I used 2 lemons (juice and zest) because I love lemons. Used scallions instead of chives (and added more) and also added in 3 tbsp fresh flat italian parsley. I also used the celery leaves in it. It's so good I've made it twice now in a week, and it's even better the next day after the lemon has soaked into the potatoes. It's also a very pretty salad!

My husband and I both agreed that this was the best potato salad we've ever tasted. It's very fresh and bright, with just the right amount of creaminess. Plus, it's a snap to make. Will definitely make again!

This was so good! I loved how light and fresh this tasted and my husband, who doesn't love lemon as much as me went back for seconds, the highest compliment coming from him!

I have made this potato salad five times now and each time it's better. I decided on green onions instead of chives and I zest the entire lemon and add it, plus I increased the mayo to one cup with the juice of the entire lemon and a little extra lemon juice to boot. It's easy and excellent. I gave this recipe to several friends and they love it, too. I also made some to give to friends to try and it's always a pleaser. Everybody loves this simple, quick recipe and now I'm hooked on it and will probably never bother with my old recipe that took hours to make again. I love this potato salad and so does everybody else! Thanks for publishing this recipe!

I'm not normally a potato salad lover but loved this recipe. I used scallions instead of chives and for a little extra touch I added some dill. Delicious!

I've made this quite a few times now, and have been consistently pleased with the results. I've received rave reviews from potato salad lovers and skeptics alike. It's relatively light for potato salad, is flavorful and well balanced, and comes together without too much fuss. It's delicious as written, but I sometimes vary the recipe depending on preferences or the ingredients that I have on hand. Finely diced scallions work well in place of chives, and if I'm looking for a lighter version I'll sub in Greek yogurt for some of the mayo. Depending on what I'm pairing this with I'll sometimes finish cooking the potatoes on the grill before mixing them in with the dressing.

I've made this twice now & it's better each time. I used the entire lemon for the zest and then all the juice from the lemon. The second time I did leave out the sugar bacause I'm diabetic. I love this potato salad. I'm famous for my own recipe, but it's lots of work to make and this is super easy! I highly recommend this recipe. It's best right after making it and let leftovers warm to room temp before serving it again out of the fridge. I also increased the amount of mayo so it would be better coated the second time around. It's "company or covered dish" quality and I'd be proud to take it anywhere. Too easy! A real time saver, different and delicious!

This is a light salad that is perfect for a BBQ. I followed the directions exactly as written but after mixing all the ingredients the salad was dry so I added more mayo to taste. Everyone loved it and it is the lemon that is the "secret" to this recipe.

Added 1 cup of finely diced spring onions, an extra cup of chopped celery, plus 1 cup of diced radishes for more texture. Then I made a huge mistake and inadvertently added 2 teaspoons of fresh lime juice instead of fresh lemon juice. Our guests loved this salad with the prominent citrusy flavor and didn't notice the difference. Whew! B.J. Harrick

I found this potato salad quite refreshing. I took it to a picnic and all the guests really enjoyed it, and seemed to agree it had a lightness to it that isn't generally expected from a potato salad. I used white potatoes that I cut, and I even added some capers for extra zing. I will be making this again for sure!

Wow. Excellent, light, fresh, tasty. I followed the recipe exactly, and it was a hit at our BBQ.

I made this for my dad and we both love the taste of lemon and because of this the recipe is one of our favorites. We also like olives in our potato salad so we added them and it added a nice touch.

I've made this numerous times! As written, it's a light & refreshing potato salad - not heavy at all. As with most recipes, the end result is very dependent on good-quality ingredients. I like Sylvia_in_Ottawa's idea of pairing it with a Greek-inspired meal, and will try that using Greek yogurt in place of the mayonnaise. I've been known to add slivered fresh basil, par-boiled fresh peas, and diced red onion, and / or lightly toasted pine nuts, depending on what season it is & what I'm serving it with. Excellent, clean, light potato salad to serve with grilled fish.

So fresh and delicious. The ratio of dressing to potatoes is perfect. I used regular old white potatoes and cut them into bite size cubes before boiling. I also peeled them.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. We found it bland - tastes like an overly basic potato salad with lemon flavoring. Will not make this again! While not a mayonnaise based salad, think the warm smashed potato salad with mustard seed/capers on this site is 100X better...

This recipe is a real winner. Prepared it for the second time this weekend for a summer bbq. Whipped it up the night before and it tasted even better the next day. I used half non-fat yogurt and half mayo to make it healthier. Even the usual non-potato salad eaters in my family loved this dish and had seconds.

YUM!! I didn't change a thing, it's sooo good. I used baby red, yellow, and purple potatoes, and it's absolutely GORGEOUS. Next time I'll try using yogurt instead of mayo, or maybe half and half. There's so much flavor in this potato salad, it's my new favorite!

I've lost count how many times I've made this potato salad in the last year, and am making again this weekend for guests. It's an excellent flavor on its own, but also an excellent base to experiment adding additional vegetables or herbs. Have fun with this one!

What a nice update on a summer favorite. This recipe is so simple to make and a definite keeper. Grilled marinated pork tenderloin and vegetable kabobs rounded out the menu.

I usually can't stand mayo-based potato salads, but I really enjoyed this. I was tempted by the lemon flavors and added more zest than was called for in addition to using a product called Lemonnaise--a mayo product enhanced with lemon that I had previously purchased from Whole Foods. I also added fresh thyme from the garden for added flavor and color. I liked the texture and color that the celery brought to the salad; I'd definitely include it. Also, I cut the potatoes before cooking so I didn't have to wait for them to cool.

I think to be fair I have to mention I'm not a HUGE lemon fan. I like it but don't love it. In the end this was just too lemony for me. I think I prefer a more traditional potato salad with radishes, onions etc...

You know you have a keeper of a recipe when your guests say "I don't EVEN LIKE potato salad and this is GOOD!" Then again, I seem to think that lemon makes everything better...

This salad is so refreshing. I think it would be very good as the recipe is written, but I made the following modifications: substituted finely chopped red onion for chives; substituted non-fat Greek yogurt for mayo (for health reasons, but I think this also tastes better on this particular salad); doubled sugar to counter-act tartness of yogurt; seasoned with salt and pepper. Delicious!

Very good. I used scallions instead of chives. Sprinkled with fresh parsley from my garden. I think if people find it bland they might try adding more salt or more lemon zest. (Note: I didn't measure any of the ingredients.) Next time I will try it with olive oil and see how that compares.

Why remove mayo? Just eat a little bit less! This potato salad was amazing, I am not a huge potato salad fan, but the lemon was a really refreshing addition. I will definitely make this again.

I'll start this review by saving - I don't like potato salad whatsoever! But... I needed to make a side dish for a BBQ and this one didn't sound half bad. It was really yummy. I added more seasoning that the recipe directed, though. And I think next time I'm going to try greek yogurt instead of mayo. I don't know why, but I have a "thing" about using 1/2 a cup of mayo in just about everything!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Having tried several different versions of potato salad, I concluded that I just wasn't a potato salad sort of person. Wrong! I LOVE this salad! I'm going to gain five pounds if I can't get rid of the leftovers quickly -- I can't stop eating it.

My wife and son have just come back from a wedding and I was left at home on the net and in the kitchen. This was their midnight snack as they came in. Living in France we're slightly suspicious of Americain recipies, but they both loved this, and had to get through quite a few spoonfuls just to see if it was really good...

Delightful! The lemon adds a light, bright flavor. Caution, use less salt. I had to make the dressing a second time with 1/4 t salt and I added capers. Took it to a picnic and came home with an empty bowl.

I swapped olive oil for mayonnaise like many others said. Not sure if that was the driver, but this dish ended up very mediocre.

This recipe is so simple and delicious! A wonderful accompaniment to heavier dishes (we paired this with the "Sticky Balsamic Ribs" recipe on this site. The balsamic and lemon played off each other quite nicely). As another reviewer mentioned, the lemon MAKES this dish. Fresh, summery, amazing.

I really hate mayonnaise, so I made this with a little olive oil instead and everyone loved it that way at my dinner party. On the same plate everyone had the corn and tomato scramble and the green beans with sweet onion vinaigrette. All three together represented the best of summer.
