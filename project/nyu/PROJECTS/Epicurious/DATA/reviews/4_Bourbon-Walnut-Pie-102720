A real keeper. I make this pie every year for Thanksgiving and again for Easter. Everyone compliments it! You can really use any type of nuts - walnuts, pecans, hazelnuts .. I do make one addition - before pouring the filling into the pie crust, I melt bittersweet chocolate in the microwave and pour a thing coating onto the bottom and sides of the crust. Five minutes in the freezer sets the chocolate, then I pour the filling and back. Delicious!

I'm very impressed by this simple and easy-to-make recipe. As a devotee of pecan pies, I wasn't sure the walnuts would pull this off - but they did. The combination of chopped and larger walnuts is nice and the filling is perfectly sweet. A wonderful slight variation on the traditional pecan pie.

Great easy to make recipe. Everyone loved these. Most thought it was pecan, but those I told said it was clearly better than pecan pies. Not as sweet and a better flavor. Perfect texture and consistency. Highly recommend!

This is a great recipe. I followed it exactly and it was perfect. The crust was forgivable and vary easy to roll out. It was flaky and also held once you cut it into wedges. The filling puffed up and settled beautifully. The touch of bourbon was a perfect amount just to satisfy me with the flavour without tasting boozy. Use good bourbon!!

I brought this pie to Thanksgiving at the in-laws & it was met with rave reviews--and we had 6 pies to choose from! I used the "tender pie crust" also on this site, because I had a spare in the freezer, but otherwise I followed the recipe closely. My oven may be off, but I removed the pie after only 43 minutes--it was golden, puffy and set. I WILL make this easy and delicious pie again! Try it!

I have made this pie every Thanksgiving since I got the recipe a few years ago. It is soooo good! My husband tells me every year that it is the BEST "pecan" pie he ever had. After all these years, he still doesn't know the nuts are walnuts.

Great flavor and texture. The crust was easy to work with and the pie was both quick and easy.

This pie is amazing. Truly amazing. I've made it many times over the years and will continue on. It's best with walnuts, I've tried to substitute pecans but the result is an awkward balance with the sweetness and texture of pecans.

Turned out very well and was very tasty. The crust turned out well. I think I'll use pecans next time.

Very good and very easy! The walnuts get nice and toasty. Use a shield on the pie crust as it turned dark brown the first time I did this.

Good! A lot like pecan pie but with more "oomph!"

A hit with the superbowl crowd. Very tasty. Next time I would use a different crust, since the crust in the recipe did not roll out well. Also, make sure you are using a standard pie pan (not a deep dish pie pan) or else the filling won't fill up the entire pie.

I've made this pie twice so far and have used pecans instead. The second time, I opted to chopped up all the nuts so the pie will slice easier. So easy and so tasty.

This is a nice change from the traditional pecan pie. I bought a frozen deep dish crust and it turned out great. You can taste the bourbon but it's just the right amount. Excellent pie.

My Husband wanted to take on the task of making this dish. He had a bit of a hard time picking up the dough for the pie crust after it was rolled out, so I did that part for him. He did a GREAT JOB!!! The Pie was wonderful. Great tast to it, we added some, Vanilla Ice Cream & Home made whipped cream to top it off. It was a great way to end off our meal.

This is the second year that I've made this pie. It is very easy and great tasting...nice looking too! Used walnut pieces for the walnut halves...but still put in the chopped walnuts too!

I replaced the bourbon with brandy and rum and added two melted cubes of semi-sweet chocolate to the walnut mixture -- divine! In the crust I accidentally added 1/2 cup sugar and it came out beautifully - almost a shortbread crust. Everyone loved it.

I've made this recipe several times and everyone raves about it. I serve it with homemade whipped cream with a pinch of bourbon in it. The crust recipe is one of the best I've found.

I have actually been making this pie for years, unfortunately I can't remember where I got the recipe from. This is a wonderful pie and always gets RAVE reviews. It is VERY rich so be sure to cut small pieces.
