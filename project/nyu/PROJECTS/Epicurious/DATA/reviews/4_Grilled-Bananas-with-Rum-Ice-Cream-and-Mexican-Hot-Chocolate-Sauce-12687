Simply amazing!! My Dad never eats dessert.... He basically licked his bowl clean and went in for seconds! I didn't have the patience to make the rum ice cream. I bought vanilla bean coconut milk ice cream. I made a sauce by melting 2 tsp butter with 1/4 c brown sugar and 1/4 c rum... Then drizzled the ice cream with the rum sauce and topped with grilled banana and pineapple chunks. Yum!!

How can you go wrong with such delicious components? The only problem I had was that a few of the bananas split in half during grilling, but it didn't compromise the flavor and was not hard to mask in the presentation.

Caveat: I only made the ice cream and the chocolate sauce. They were terrific together! The ice cream is totally tasty (I decreased the brown sugar slightly and increased the rum!) And combined with Mexican chocolate, the dessert is fantastic, easy, and fun. Enjoy a slight twist on traditional ice cream and chocolate sauce.

The dish was not difficult to make and once it was assembled the flavors blended together nicely. However, it was a lot of work for what were basically banana splits. Not particularly impressive or exceptionally good.

This is a wicked dessert! I served this at 3:30 a.m at the end of our 13 course New Year's Eve dinner, and it was out of this world! I did however have to practice with the bananas. It is possible to broil them to get the same carmelized effect, but they are better grilled(for whatever reason). I had a very hard time finding the mexican chocolate (found Ibarra Chocolate eventually at Mexgrocer.com),so I used a chili infused chocolate. The rum ice cream is simply dreamy. The combination of the bananas, rum and chocolate are outstanding, and I would highly recommend holding out for the Ibarra Chocolate because the spices and sugar are vastly different and put it way over the top. But even without the proper chocolate, this is a relatively easy dessert that guests will rave about for a very long time.

I am in love... The best dessert for a outdoors get together, after using the grill. Everyone was impressed by the taste and uniqueness. I actually used Dreyers Slow Churned Vanilla Ice Cream (lower fat) and mixed it with Kahlua. Yum. Made chocolate sauce, but wasn't really neccesary and would prefer it thicker in the future

This was a nice twist on the standard banana split. I didn't make the ice cream, and I regret that. Homemade is always better in my opinion. I used store bought butter pecan ice cream instead and it was ok. The chocolate sauce is delicious. I was able to find Ibarra Mexican chocolate, and it's a really different flavor.

You have to know the recipe is a success when a couple of your guests asked if I had any more bananas and then made the recipe over again in my kitchen. We served it again after an evening of playing Bridge.

When I grilled the bananas I had to keep peeling more and tossing them, they were so delicious I had a hard time saving them for dinner. Everything turned out great - if you wanted to skip the homemade ice cream, you could. Just buy some to go with the delicious bananas and chocolate sauce!

Great recipe! Adults loved it, kids were intimidated by the grilled Bananas, something I didn't expect. The Rum Ice Cream could stand on it's own as a dessert! Wonder if broiling the Bananas would have worked just as well. Definitely try this one!

I confess I cheated massively as I was short of time. Instead of making rum ice cream, I used bought vanilla ice cream and made a rum chocolate sauce. Was fantastic.
