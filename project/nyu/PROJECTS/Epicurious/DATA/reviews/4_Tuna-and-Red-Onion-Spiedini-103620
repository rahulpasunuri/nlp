Fantastic! The tuna was done in about 5 minutes. I used oregano instead of rosemary and served with the suggested tomatoes and basil on slices of ciabatta. Really delicious, great for a warm evening.

Excellent recipe. A truely great mix of fresh flavors. I didn't have any garlic flavored olive oil so I just pressed a small bit of fresh garlic into normal olive oil. Was worried that this would be too strong for tossing with the greens but it worked out fine. I can't wait to make this for friends and family.

I made this for a party at the lake. It was fantastic. I'm not a fan of tuna but I've made this repeatedly since then.

This was wonderful. I too thought it needed a little zip so I added a little fresh ginger, fresh garlic and some red pepper. Go light on the ginger, I loved it, but others thought it was a little strong. Can't wait to do this again.

Very good but a bit oily. Needs more zing but that is all adjustable in your own customization. Mmmmm
