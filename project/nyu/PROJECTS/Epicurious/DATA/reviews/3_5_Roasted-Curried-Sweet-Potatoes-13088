Delicious and ridiculously easy, but you should double the butter and curry powder (if not triple it).

I love this recipe. It's so different from the usual syrupy sweet potato options and not mushy. Offers a great flavour combo with any meat. Goes very well with lamb. Also easy to adjust for any amount of sweet potato you have. I get requests for this recipe all the time.

the flavor was underwhelming, and i seasoned generously with s&p. the potatoes crisped nicely, but the flavor wasn't the sweet and savory combination i expected. it was more like bland sweet potatoes with a teeny sprinkle of curry.

Delicious and so easy especially for a novice cook (like me).

I didn't have enough sweet potatoes so made this using half sweet & half white potatoes. Delicious! To help the potatoes crisp up, be sure there's only a single layer in the pan.

So simple yet so effective. Great combination of flavors. I quadrupled the recipe - all the ingredients proportionately - and it was delicious.

This is so easy and so flavorful. A great way to prepare sweet potatoes for a change. Easy during the week and different enough to serve as one of the vegetable sides to company.

I concur with all of the other reviews -- a simple delicious side dish. Next time I might increase the curry powder to 3/4 tsp or even a tsp.

Use the hottest curry powder you can get.

It is hard to believe that with such simple ingredients that these potatoes would be so tasty!!! Definately one of my favorites! I will be making these for Thanksgiving. Like the other reviewer said "double the recipe" Yum Yum

I love this side dish! Takes no time to make and it's so delicious. However, if you like sweet potatoes I recommend doubling the recipe. The amount it yields is a tease!!!

You can save washing another pan by melting the butter in the roasting pan.

An interesting way to prepare sweet potatoes. Served as a side dish with baked chicken. Thin-sliced them (like potato chips) and kept them in the oven longer to make them crunchier.

These are a nice side dish. A very good way to do sweet pototoes.

I must admit ,if I am having roast potatoes I like them crispy-so leave them in the oven longer and turn the grill on to crisp them up!!.

I have made these potatoes several times. The simplicity of the recipe allows you to focus on other dishes and still have an elegant and delicious side dish for just about any main course. I have served it with chicken and marinated grilled tuna. The last time I made this dish, I added a dash of ground cloves...worked nice with the curry.

Very easy to pull together and delicious. My husband expected (wanted) them to get crusty but they stayed soft.
