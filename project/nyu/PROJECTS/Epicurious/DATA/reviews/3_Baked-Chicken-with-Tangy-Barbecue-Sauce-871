My family loves this recipe. I use both dark and white meat, to make everyone happy, and it comes out well. My only variation was that I added the whole sauce to the chicken instead of saving some for the end. "Baking" the sauce made it thicker.

I followed the recipe exactly except that I added a bit more vinegar (my personal preference). We enjoyed it very much and will make again. It is a very simple recipe and good for a weeknight meal after work.

Chicken was very good- tender. The sauce left a lot to be desired, tasted too much like ketchup. Perhaps cutting down on ketchup, or adding vinegar will make a better sauce....

This was fabulous!!! Everyone loved it. I added some Tabasco sauce, removed the skin. BAKE WITH BREAST SIDE UP SO SAUCE IS ON THE MEAT.

this recipe worked on two levels. First, the breading helped the sauce adhere to the chicken pieces, and second, the sauce was a nice alternative to most of the vinegar based sauces out there. Followed the recipe exactly and found it to be very tasty.

Loved the sauce. I did not bread the chicken, and used chicken breast, but followed the rest of the recipe. My husband and I loved the dish! We both had seconds. Will definitely make again!

a good sweet taste. I substituted maple syrup for the brown sugar.

Excellent! I doubled the sauce and added a small can of pineapple.
