Add 1 Tb lemon juice, 1 tsp cumin, 2 Tb olive oil, 1/4 C. Parsley and you are there. Great way to increase your iron and get your veggies in!

I like to use what is in season in my own garden so I used fresh peas and my own lemon, parsley and green onion. It was a beautiful way to make the most of my garden. The cumin is the perfect touch.

I used canned peas, added more onion & lemon juice and it was great! I will be making this again!

I've made this a few times and found it was better with good quality frozen peas. The fresh peas weren't tasty enough for some reason. That's the only change I made. I've served it at a dinner party with other appetizers and had a lot of comments about how good and fresh it tasted. I'm making it again today.

I really liked this. I didn't have all of the ingredients, so I used frozen peas and milk instead of yogurt. I didn't have the parsley either. I think I might try some fresher herbs like dill or basil next time, instead of cumin. I added a bit of cayenne too.

Nothing could save this. My mom and I kept tasting it and added more lemon juice,a clove of garlic, a drizzle of olive oil-it was truly bad.
