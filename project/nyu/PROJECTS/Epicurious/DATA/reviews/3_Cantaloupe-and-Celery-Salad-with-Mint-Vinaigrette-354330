Superb flavors & textures - definitely worth the effort. I sliced the cantaloupe by hand, thin rather than very thin, which I think provided a nice contrast to the very thin celery and scallions. I served it as appetizer/salad followed by simple oven roasted salmon filet & fresh corn on the cob. Perfect summer dinner.

The dressing was outstanding. I used lime instead of lemon, and white wine vinegar instead of Champagne. Loved the mint and the shallots. As far as the salad goes, I think the dressing over just the melon would have been perfectly adequate. I know that might not be texturally appealing, but the radish and celery didn't add anything but work to the recipe, in my opinion. Will make the dressing again.

This was surprisingly VERY good. I really liked the layers of flavour with the acid, sweet, bitter all well balanced with a nice texture. Slice the cantaloupe crosswise after halving it lengthwise with a mandoline.

This was really easy and refreshing. The only thing I changed was white wine vinegar in place of Champagne vinegar as I didn't have. Will be making this again.

The flavors were nice and bright - great for a hot summer night. My only issue is that it's very labor intensive (thus the 2 forks). The crunch of the veggies is a nice juxtaposition to the soft melon, and the mint and lemon juice in the dressing was nice.

We made this recently, and were in agreement that the flavors clashed as presented (two bites and the rest went in the disposal). I'd try making this again, eliminating the shallot, onion and radish. The celery and cantelope were a nice, surprising combination and the lightly minty dressing was refreshing.

As presented, this is the rare recipe on the site that I thought was inedible. Elimiating the onion and radish would be a drastic improvement (and I'm usually a fan of both). The cantelope and celery was a good combination, and the vinagarette was otherwise tasty. We prepared this recently, and both of us didn't finish the portion and the rest went in the trash.

I liked it too. I was afraid the vinaigrette was going to be too bland, but it really nicely complemented the melon, radish, celery and onion.

I don't know what made me try this recipe but I'm so glad that I did! The flavors were very nice together and so summery and fresh tasting. I really reoommend this salad.
