I'm not a pea lover, so I found this to be a good, simple dish, which says a great deal. I did reduce by half the amount of peas called for by the recipe. A good Thanksgiving side dish.

I didn't eat peas until recently. This is a great recipe for the finicky eater. Enjoy!

A virtually effortless way to update plain peas. Made this as a side dish for Thanksgiving and got rave reviews. Used chicken stock in place of beef broth, and pan fried some prosciutto as pancetta was not readily available. Takes only minutes and makes a world of difference with both taste and presentation.

A really easy/quick way to prepare petite peas, with a very nice flavour. V. recommended as a repeatable side dish.

I added a package of dried morels and used the soaking liquid in place of the beef broth. With the leftovers, I added some pasta and a little parmesan. Both ways, it was delicious!

I made this dish with a stuffed leg of lamb for Christmas and everyone just raved! I used chicken broth instead of beef broth and it worked out just fine!
