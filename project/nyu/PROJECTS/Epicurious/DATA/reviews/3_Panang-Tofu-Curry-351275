Excellent! Made with shrimp instead of curry.

I think that this is a very good recipe. I have followed many of the minor modifications suggested earlier and the result was really good. I would say that the full taste definitely comes through only on the 2nd day; so if/when I make it for company, I'll probably cook it ahead of time. The modifications suggested earlier that I followed: (1) chicken broth for water, (2) used the additional Pananag curry paste suggested by Columbus, OH on 12/31/09 (note, though, that most ingredients in the paste overlap with ingredients used in the recipe as is, so perhaps upping those would have the same effect); (3) added peppers only toward the end.; (4) pressed water out of tofu and fried it before using in the recipe. These are actually minor modifications, or rather adjustments, just how things are with cooking, which is why I think that the recipe merits 4 forks even as written.

With revisions (many of them inspired by all of you) would give this 4 forks. Browned the tofu cubes to start and set them aside until the end. Agree to add 1 Tbsp fish sauce vs salt (mine even used another dash of salt at serving time, but then, I added alot of low salt ingredients). Sauce itself was tasty (luckily, I have a "family sized" pack of Kaffir lime leaves from our local Asian supermarket in the freezer). Used regular coconut milk. When adding the veg, started with cubes of yam. Let them cook for 10+ minutes before adding carrot red pepper, then in a few minutes cauliflower, then broccoli, then spinach and bean sprouts, and finally fresh minced basil (from my frozen stock). Serves an army. Delicious, with a plentiful amount of sauce. Plenty spicy enough with sambal olek (can't speak for other chili sauces).

Delicious! Used regular coconut milk and fried the tofu first, but otherwise followed the recipe verbatim. Served with the coconut rice recipe on here too. Rave reviews!

This ended up being a great family recipe. I've never had Panang Curry or even made a Thai dish, so had no particular expectations. I adopted most of the suggestions - chicken broth instead of water, added water chestnuts and snow peas, rounded up on the spices. Everyone voted to have it again, with one improvement: I will brown the tofu cubes. Nobody cared for the soft tofu texture.

The panang curry is wonderful, although I made a few changes. Replace the salt with about 1 tbsp of fish sauce (nuoc mam). Replace the water with vegetable or chicken broth. Halve the sugar. Add about a handful of Thai basil leaves about 1 minute before cooking is done. Then... it's perfect.

I've made this recipe a few times and it never fails to please. I added 1 more tablespoon of chopped ginger and some fresh chopped galangal, omitted the chilli paste and used 2 fresh red chillies instead. Threw all the spices into a food mill and pulsed them into a paste. And, very important, I used sugar-free peanut butter. Added diced sweet potato. Yum!

Great! Didn't add brown sugar but did add snow peas and cut tofu in smaller squares then fried the tofu before putting it in...and only used coconut oil instead of olive oil

I've made this twice, and I hardly ever make anything twice. The peanut butter and coconut milk lend a creamy richness to the sauce. It's a delight! :) I served it to my parents with brown rice, and omitted the brown sugar. Make sure to salt this dish enough.

This is the most amazing vegetarian curry I've ever had! It was so tasty and fragrant. Used ground chili instead of chili paste. Used organic soya milk instead of coconut milk. Frying with olive oil is not healthy as it's original molecular structure desintegrates and turns into trans fat. Used organic sesame sead oil instead. Sooo yummy!

Rating: 3
I followed some tips from other commenters. I used a lime instead of the leaves, since I did not have those. I only used the zest and juice from one lime, though. I also added 1 tbsp. brown sugar, 1/2 tsp. red curry powder, 1 tbsp. fish sauce, and served over brown rice. I had been nervous about the recipe because some commenters seemed very displeased with how it turned out, but it exceeded my expectations! Yum!

Rating: 4
I thought this curry was excellent and very easy to make. The flavours blended perfectly and I didn't find that any were over powering or stood out from the others. I added broccoli and zuchinni to the carrots and pepper for more of a meal. This was a learning experience, as I usually sautee tofu before adding it to things, but by not sauting the veg. or the tofu first, the vegetables tasted fresher and the tofu was softer and juicy. I also left out the sambal olek and just used a small red (hot) peperoncini with it's seeds. I can not imagine using lime (and certainly not lemon) juice. The Kefir leaves are an essential ingredient although when serving this to guests it might me nice to place a lime wedge on top. Can't wait to make this again!

Rating: 2
My main criticism of this recipe is that it doesn't really taste like Panang Curry. Mine had a very unusual flavor--something that resembled what I can only describe as "peanut-butter mustard". My only idea why is that I used the lime juice/lime peel rather than the kaffir lime leaves. I would not make it again.

Very easy and satisying! Most ingredients are things I had around the house already, and it only uses one pot! Definitely need to double the chili paste, though. I added zucchini to the curry and that really put it over the edge. VERY tasty. The only thing I didn't already have around was kaffir leaves or even limes. I used lemon juice instead, and it was tasty, but I'll hunt down the kaffir leaves next time. I just needed to make sure the recipe was worth the effort. I only used one block of tofu, I can't imagine using two.

Easy and delicious! But this definitely feeds more than 4 people. I made the full recipe of sauce but just one package of tofu. Added spinach near the end of cooking time.

Rating: 4
Great recipe with some slight adjustments: Omitted the carrots, used 2 red bell peppers versus 1 and sauteed those prior to adding to the curry. Also, I used 1 Tbsp sambal olek (we like it fairly spicy), added in 1 Tbsp fish sauce and 1/2 tsp corn starch in with the water, tossed in some extra lime zest and added an extra teaspoon or two of brown sugar. Lastly, I made this recipe with 1 container of firm tofu and 1 batch of fresh paneer (versus 2 containers of firm tofu). Would also be good with only paneer.

I was struck by the fact that aside from a bit of chopping, this recipe required very little work and only one pan, which was nice. (Make sure the pan is at least 2.5 quarts large, or the dish won't fit in it!). My changes: I used non-organic peanut butter, 1 tsp of dried red pepper flakes instead of the hot chili paste, and regular coconut milk (I couldn't find the light). I also added a can of baby corn and a can of water chestnuts. This was a delicious, wonderful curry. I ate it alone and didn't bother with rice. It was a bit rich, no doubt because of the regular coconut milk, but the flavors made it worth it. The additional veggies also made this a more substantial meal. I loved this curry and can't wait to make it again.

This recipe would be great if they gave you the recipe for the Panang curry paste. I added it to the recipe and it was fabulous. Here it is. For Panang curry paste 2 dried chillies 1 medium shallots (finely chopped) 2 cloves of garlic (finely chopped) 1/2 tspoon ginger (finely chopped) 1/2 tspoon lime zest 1 tspoon cilantro roots and stalks (not the leaves) pinch cumin seeds pinch whole white pepper pinch of clove pinch of cinnamon bit of star anise Mix the panang curry paste in a mortar and pestle or roughly grind it in a mixer. Set it aside.

I followed the recommendations here to increase the chili, etc. I made it in advance, and amglad I did. When I made it and tasted it, I didn't care much for it. But after letting it sit in the fridge a couple days, it improved very much in flavor and consistency of the sauce. I am not vegetarian nor very accustomed to Thai cuisine. This was the first time I ever tried tofu. I found the tofu to be OK. It was nice that the tofu absorbed the flavor of this sauce. If I were to make it again, I would make it without teh carrots & red peppers, then refrigerate a couple days, then sautee the peppers and carrots and add that as I reheat to serve. The red peppers and carrots were way overdone and mushy, which is not my preference. Since making this I did go to a wellrepsected Thai restaurant and had something similar, and quite frankly my opinion is it was inedible. They breaded and deep fried the tofu, which made the tofu dry and rubbery and also prevented it from absorbing the flavor of teh sauce. The curry had a rather "starchy" taste to it -- and aftertaste that actually lasted a few days. Basing this recipe in comparison to this restaurant, this recipe was far superior. Also, if I were to make it again I would add some green vegetables.Probably green beans, peas. Perhaps some bamboo shoots.

I'm only giving this one fork because it's not letting me give 0. This was just awful! It smelled great, but it was way too bland and tasted like watery mush. It's worth the 12 bucks to get this as take out Even my husband, who's a very agreeable eater, couldn't finish his portion.

This dish is amazing. We substituted chicken breast cut into 1 inch cubes, and added it at the same time as the veggies, and made sure to keep the heat very low to poach the chicken. We absolutely loved it - a very subtle but rich flavor. Make sure that you're adding enough salt to bring out the flavors - a pinch isn't going to cut it.

Rating: 3
I've made this recipe twice, the first as is and the second with modifications. I agree with many that this is a good recipe but improves if you add extra flavor and spice to your taste. The second time I used chicken instead of tofu, chicken broth instead of water, and added extra peanut butter and extra red chili paste. Using kaffir lime leaves instead of lime juice/peel does make a difference! Great served over rice or bulgar.

Rating: 3
This version of curry is very good, but...as others have said, it needed some tweaking for our tastes. Definitely better to use chicken broth instead of water, used more peanut butter, used only half of the coconut milk, added more fresh lime juice. Made the curry sauce first and let it simmer for forty minutes. Added the called for quantities of tofu,carrots and bell pepper. Seemed to have a lot of curry sauce so I added chopped cauliflower, sliced okra, and diced potatoes. Simmered for twenty minutes. It was perfect for us.

Lacking flavor. I added fish sauce, curry, sesame seed oil...nothin'. This won't be a recipe that I repeat.

I agree with all the reviewers who said they didn't understand the negative reviews - I made this according to the recipe with the only changes being substituting light coconut milk for the non-light version and adding frozen peas for some color, which frankly doesn't alter the recipe in any great measure. I loved it (vegetarian) and my whole non-vegetarian family loved it!

Rating: 4
Very good. I did make a few modifications, based on the other reviews: added more peanut butter, added more chili, reduced the tofu (I used ~16-18oz), & added more veggies -- I used 1 red bell pepper, 2 carrots and 1 cup frozen cut green beans. I used low sodium veg broth instead of water. The next time I make it I may cut down on the turmeric, 2 tsp seemed like a lot. Served with Jasmine rice. Delish.

This turned out delicious with a few very minor modifications I made, but I'm sure it would be great without them. This is, however, totally unlike the gloppy, sugary, fish-saucy Panang curries you get at your local Thai place (or that I have had at mine). It has a nice, rich nutty sauce with a faint splash of ginger and herbal flavor from the lime leaves, and it doesn't overpower the flavor of the veggies or the tofu. I increased the chili sauce by 2 tsp, added a tbsp of soy to the coconut milk, and added a bit of galangal along with the ginger (used the pre-minced stuff in the jar), to prevent the lack of flavor mentioned in other reviews, and I substituted a zucchini for one of the carrots. If I could have gotten my hands on some premium hand-made tofu this dish would have been really awesome.

Rating: 1
Yuck, this didn't turn out well for me. Like other one fork ratings, I found this to be bland. When I added more spice, it became sort of like spicy peanut sauce. I didn't have the lime leaves, so my version used lime juice and peel. Maybe that was the problem.

Rating: 1
I have to agree with previous reviewers who found this recipe bland - as written it is very, very bland - very rich due to the coconut milk and PB yet strangely flavourless. I noticed that many reviewers who rated the recipe highly did so based on changes they made, NOT the recipe as written. The one fork rating is based on the recipe as written. With tinkering, I give it two forks. I did end up doctoring the recipe a lot to make it worth eating: increase amounts of ginger, chili, sugar and cumin. Added soy sauce and fish sauce. Even added some sweet chilli sauce. Substitute stock for water. Added LOTS of extra veggies - green beans, yellow bell pepper, bok choy, etc. (sorry, but a curry that consists of only carrots and tofu is not appealing to me!) With the addition of extra veggies, I found one pack of tofu to be sufficient. The recipe is worth trying but only with lots of tinkering. Not sure if I'd make it again - maybe in a pinch as the ingredients are ones I usually have on hand and it's very quick to make.

I am a huge curry fan and I loved this one, although it resembled a yellow Indian curry more than the panang curries I've tasted. First time cooking with tofu and it worked great, super flavourful and easy.

delicious!! my modifications -- fried 4-5 red chilis 1st before adding onion (red instead of shallots). used skippy chunky peanut butter. skipped adding lime juice . used one Japanese eggplant instead of carrots. could fry more chilis for added spice. the tofu just melts in your mouth and despite what others reviewers said, it is very flavorful and tastes even better than it smells. i love thai food, and this one is definitely one that will stay in my recipe box.

Good to start. Definitely add chicken broth instead of water, and a few tablespoons of fish sauce. Do NOT go overboard on the peanut butter, and I needed another teaspoon or 2 of brown sugar. Don't be afraid to add water if too thick!!

This recipie is epic. Dont believe the neg reviews.. there are some caveats however. Kaffir Lime leaves are essential.. replacing them with *fresh* lime juice is probably as close as you can get, but the one fork folks probably squeezed some of that "lime juice in a plastic lime" crap into it and killed it. Other suggestions: Use fresh turmeric if you can get it, not powdered. Get a mortar and pestle and grind up whole cumin seeds(pre ground is oxidized and doesnt have nearly the punch). Make sure you are using the kind of peanut butter that separates. *not* peanut butter with added sugar like Jif or skippy.

The smell was good. The taste was bland. Had a good balance of heat (doubled the amount of chili paste) but it really seemed to be lacking something to round out the flavor and give it a more complete taste. It was a nice and easy recipe, however, and I'll keep tweaking it until finding the right formula!

Oh my gosh! I never thought I would be capable of making a decent curry but I did it! I didn't follow the recipe all the way. I used pickled ginger from a jar which was faster and in my opinoin tastier than plain ginger. I had to do a Teensy bit of fish sauce because what is thai without fish sauce? I used a squeezed lime because my grocery doesn't have the leaves. In terms of the bad comments, I would definetly add way more spices and Chili sauce and Peanut butter than is specificallly called for.Tasting it is key to getting the flavor right. I also fried my tofu in olive oil to make it crunchy before adding it to the curry. At any rate I am sooo happy with my delicious curry!

Rating: 3
I made the recipe as listed with sambal oelek, kaffir lime leaves and regular coconut milk rather than light (my store didn't carry light). We thought the recipe was great--subtle but a perfect balance of spices and flavors. It was a hit with our family (husband and 2 teenage girls) and we will make it again. Don't be put off by the negative reviews. If you like things spicy, just increase the hot sauce but otherwise, the amount of carrots, tofu, bell peppers was really just right.

This is terrible. I think it could have been salvageable but the lime is such a bad flavor in this that it overpowered anything I tried (curry powder, more salt, more brown sugar, etc.) the lime comes out at the end of the flavor and it is awful. Disappointing, guess we're getting take-out tonight.

I would not make this recipe again. In fact, I couldn't even eat it. For the amount of preparation required, the end result was tasteless and disappointing. I am going to siphon out the vegetables and use them for something else. What a waste of ingredients!

I thought that this was pretty close to the real deal but I did change it. I added 1 chicken breast (thinly sliced),zucchini,1 Yukon gold potato,1 jalapeno thinly sliced, 2 tsp. extra turmeric, fish sauce 2tsp.(a staple in all thai food). Just make sure you slice the 3 carrots (it was doubled in the recipe) very thin or julienne or they don't cook quick enough. I did have to add about 3 extra cups of water to the sauce to get the carrots to cook but it was great when it was finished!!!!

well...after reading all the reviews, I still decided to give it a try as panang is one of my all time favorites. After adding to and playing with the bland sauce, I wasn't able to improve on it much and have a ton of leftovers that probably won't get eaten...bottom line, this aint your mama's panang...take the safe way out and patron your favorite thai takeout.

This recipe is lacking something - the flavor is not as robust as a good panang curry could be. I added salt and then some fish sauce (although I guess it was no longer vegetarian at that point), but I was still disappointed.

This was fine, but could be improved upon. I used nam pla instead of salt. And I would defintely up the spices and the heat. Might be nice with some basil. The tofu could be pan seared before adding to the sauce for additional texture.

My husband and I both thought this was great. I followed the seasoning instructions exactly, but only used one package of tofu, and just used veggies I had on hand (yellow squash, carrot, bok choy, handful of spinach) and only one package of tofu. I did sear the tofu in a skillet before adding to the sauce, because I like tofu to have a little more texture to it. Yum. Will certainly make this again.

Delicious. Great for winter, and all the ingredients were readily available (unlike, say, red curry, which really needs fresh basil). I made it exactly as written (except of course for the thousands of carrots it calls for). For those who said it lacked fire, I think the problem might be the chili paste called for....not the chinese hot sauce with the rooster on the bottle (though that is good stuff), but thai chili paste, which is hot as heck and comes in a small jar.

2 1/2 forks. i think this recipe has the carrots listed twice. 6 carrots would have been waaaay too many. i used both green and red bell peppers b/c thats what I had. i preferred the flavor of the red with this recipe. i used red curry paste instead of the chili paste and would use more next time. not that hot at all. i agree it needed a little more oomph!, and i had to salt it quite a bit. but, overall - a good tofu recipe to try. not many good tofu / veggie recipes on this site. i enjoyed the peanut buttery-ness. made enough so we can have leftovers for lunch & i like that. it will probably taste better tomorrow.

Rating: 3
a good simple recipe. I used red curry paste instead of sambal oelek and 1 tsp was plenty. Since it has tumeric and ginger in the paste that may have helped the overall flavor. I did put in minced ginger instead of grated. I did double the cumin, just in case and b/c we love cumin over here. It's very warming and very filling with all that protein-dense tofu.

Rating: 1
Blah. Not much flavor. It may have been easier not to pre-cook any of the veggies or tofu, but it meant that the dish was even more boring since none of the flavors ever really melted together. And the sauce wasn't tasty enough to cover it up. I wouldn't bother trying to improve it. Too many problems, I won't make again.

Spouse rated this 3 forks while I thought it was 1 fork (just ok). Spouse said this was better the first night; flavors melded too much later on. Seems like it's missing something to me.

May not make again.

This is the first time I have ever made tofu, but decided to give it a try because I love panang curry. I made it exactly as written. I found it very flavorful, but not very spicy.

A very good tofu curry recipe. Per another reviewers' suggestion, I doubled the number of shallots, used an extra tablespoon of grated ginger, and I doubled the sambal oelek. I also thickened the sauce a little at the end with cornstarch. Perfect amount of heat. The peanut butter added a nice background richness. I think the dish could use more color, so I added 14 oz of chopped spinach, plus mushrooms (I love mushrooms). I think the additions helped.
