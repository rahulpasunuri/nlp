Ok People....LISTEN UP! New England clam chowder does not contain celery, broccoli, red peppers, capicolla, bacon or flour (yes, I said NO FLOUR). Real, honest to god NE Chowder is thin...like milk. It shouldn't be that nasty gelatinous mess in a can or that is served at most chains around America. It is thin, people, thin...like Milk!!

I shucked a dozen small to medium clams. That was the hard part. Using fresh clams, I thought the recipe tasted good overall but was really a bit too "clammy" if you can believe it. Personally, even though I enjoyed the cooking process, the taste isn't much better than Campbell's Chunky Clam Chowder. If you want similar results, you could always add a little sauteed onion and a half-and-half to Campbells. I'm going to try the Campbell's Stock Pot chowder and report on that in comparison. The only reason I made clam chowder in the first place is that I decided my clams were a bit too large for me to enjoy steamed. Next time, I think I'll use them for clams casino. But let me finish by saying this recipe is just fine. It's bland, but fine.

This is a real authentic chowder. I cooked the potatoes in clam broth. Don't substitute the salt pork, capicolla is not a good replacement!Quick and easy. I made it Rhode Island style and swirled the cream into the individual bowls.

Great recipe for a very fast, warm, delicious soup! I did take some ideas from the 1992 Gourmet recipe (carrots, celery) and advice from others to add some flour to the onions as they were sauteed.

LOVED the recipe. Very good flavor!!! We're an hour from San Francisco, so we've had some awesome clam chowder: this it up there! Made a couple minor modifications: Added additional clams (chopped) and used heavy whipping cream instead. Next time, I may add a tablespoon of flour to the onions to thicken the soup a bit more.

This is the best clam chowder recipe ever! I am a Jersey Girl who lived in Leominster, MA for 4 years and this tastes as good as the locals made up there. The first time I had no salt pork and substituted bacon. It was quite tasty. This time I used the salt pork & added a handful of leftover corn. It was superb! Even my picky mother asked for seconds. I never scald the half & half though; it just seems like a waste of time.

How would a person from Ithica know what GOOD New England clam chowder is about? Brocolli or celery??? Are you serious? Corn is a perfectly acceptable ingredient. BTW, the potatoes are mushy as in not chewy...not cooked enough to dissolve. This is a good solid recipe, that I plan to make again for my SuperBowl party this weekend. Sorry about the Bills, Giants, and Jets . Maybe next year and you can add celery and brocolli to yours if your team is in the big game. Take the last comments for what they are please...in jest.

Why would you "scald" the H&H? Geez. There is nothing worse than boiled, overheated cream or milk. Corn? Gimme' a break. Celery and even broccoli would be good, but not CORN. Russet potatoes? What difference does it make if they get "mushy?" Think of it as a thickener. Good luck.

Delicious. A fine clam chowder, quick and easy as well. A cook from Swansea, MA and 'a cook on 2/3/02' have the right idea. If you are looking for authentic New England Clam Chowder, the kind you get from a lobster shack on a wharf in a small town on the coast of Maine, Massachusetts or Rhode Island, this is it. It's all about the simple, fresh, oceany flavor of the clams, with the warm, buttery flavor of the cream or half and half. Simplicity is the thing. The onion, salt pork, salt and black pepper simply round out the flavors. Potato is for texture and a little thickening. For the real thing, please don't add anything else: no celery, no carrots, no red pepper(!), no cornstarch, no clove, no bay leaf, no parsley (not even for garnish). Please don't use russet potatoes, they get mushy and fall apart. A little leftover fresh corn is OK. Oyster crackers are OK. Canned clams are alright. It is supposed to be thin, like milk. Prepare this as per the recipe and when you sit down to taste it, enjoy it for what it is, not what it isn't- and it isn't the canned what-they-think-is-chowder that Campbell's or Pepperidge Farm makes. The next day it's even better. Please reheat it slowly, boil it too much and it will curdle. Three forks because it's delicious, and very tasty.

Instead of salt pork, I used Hot Cappa Colla (an Italian salami found at the deli section of most fine stores) and used fresh minced clams with bottle clam juice. For a nice suprise, I included fresh pieces of Cod fillet and served in a small Italian/Rosemary/Olive Oil round loaf. Hubby and 11yr loved it on the cold and rainy day. Bon Apetite!

This was my first attempt at chowder and it's so quick and tasty I will definetly be making this again. Like others before me I used what was on hand. I used 3 strips of bacon, 1 can of clams, 1 chopped stalk of celery, and fat free half and half. I also added some left over white corn.

This was exactly what I had my mouth set for: simple, satisfying and absolutely delicious! I made it as written with the following substitutions, based on what I had on hand: 1/3 c minced prosciutto (lean), sauteed with the onion in 1 t sweet butter & 1 t olive oil; 1 med russet potato, peeled; fat-free half&half; 2 cans clams with their juice; and about 1/3 c leftover corn kernels. Non-traditional? Nope. No self-respecting New England housewife would wake the horse & fire up the buggy just to go get a particular variety of potato or side meat, nor do I think she would turn up her thrifty nose at using up a handful of leftover corn. THIS IS REAL YANKEE SOUL FOOD!! P.S. Watch the salt! It's easy to get too much; better to let anyone who wants more add it at the table.

This was incredible. My husband is a New England Clam Chowder fanatic, so I was a little nervous as to how it would turn out. I made it for the first time when we had friends over and everyone raved how fantastic it was - even my husband! He likes it a little thicker, so right before serving, I let it come to a soft boil and it thickened up nicely.

Good, basic clam chowder. Exactly what I wanted. In answer to Cherie from Australia, I would reserve the liquor from the canned clams and make up the difference with your own fish stock. It should be a reasonable substitute.

I cannot purchase clam juice in Australia - can anyone suggest a substitute please?

If you are from New England, this recipe for clam chowder is recognizable as the real thing. This is how we make it. There are no herbs or other veggies used. It isn't supposed to be too thick either. Variation is the spice of life, but true clam chowder is very basic

I love this chowder! I only slightly varied this recipe: I evaporated almost all of the liquid and used non-fat half and half, and it turned out great. Patience is key, just let that liquid evaporate, and occasionally stir so that the vegetables don't stick to the pan. My husband said that it was the best he'd ever had. Wish we could give it 3 1/2 forks, it's a real keeper! I bet it's wonderful comfort food after a brisk walk in the chill (but it's 75 here today, and it still was great)

All the reviews I read were from everywhere but New England> This is the way we make it in R.I. and Massachusetts. It the simple basic chowder the fishermen make without destroying the clam flavor with too mmany herbs and spices. If you want authentic chowder don't mess with the recipe!

My husband refuses to eat chowder from a can anymore. This recipe is wonderful and is just as easy to make as the condensed chowder.

This chowda was o.k. but needs parsley, salt, pepper, butter and cream instead of half and half. By the way, Jim Wells, in his review, says that clear broth clam chowda is real New England clam chowda. I'm afraid not. Clear broth chowda is Rhode Island chowda. Creamy chowda is New England chowda.

I've included this clam chowder in our family repertoire, but add clove, bay leaf, parsley and freshly ground black pepper for more flavor. It's great to have a taste of my New England home her in landlocked Iowa. Doubles well, but don't double the amount of water or you just waste time boiling it off.

Rating: 2
Decent flavor but very watery. I think the water-onions-potato mixture should be boiled until the liquid is almost ALL gone. In addition, add the half and half a bit at a time and check flavor and consistency as you go.

I made this clam chowder last night and I as well as my family could not get enough of it. I had to double the recipe , and next time I will have to triple it. This was so easy that it does not pay to buy it from a can . Also I did use can clams. This recipe I would recommed to anyone wanting a quick dinner all you need to do is serve a salad and bread. Thank you Jo Boestfleisch Palm Bay Fl.

As a native of RI I also prefer "Clear Broth" Chowda. Try this: 5 lbs potatos, 6 large onions 1lb salt pork, 10 - 20 qts chowda quahogs. Cut salt pork into 1/4 pieces, rend. Cut onions into small pieces, cook in rend juice. Cut potatos into 1/4 to 1/2 inch pieces. Place potatos into water. Add minces quohogs, add onions, salt pork. Add white peper to taster, salt to taste. This is REAL NEW ENGLAND CLAM CHOWDA

As a native New Englander, I prefer "plain" (ie--no milk/cream or tomatoes) chowder! This recipe lends itself well to alterations. Instead of adding the milk and heavy cream, I simply added more water and clam juice. If you're lucky enough to have access to fresh clams, the "liquor" derived from streaming these clams is awesome in this chowder. Also, it is a great base for fish chowder--just use fish stock in place of the milk/cream and add your favorite fish (cod, haddock, etc.) Of course, if you like creamy chowders, prepare the recipe as is. It's great!

When I made this receipt I used 2 cans of clams and 1 bottle of clam juice. I also added chopped carrot to the chowder, and dried red pepper about 1/4 tsp. to give it a zing. I used 2% milk instead of cream and thickened with cornstarch. Very good.
