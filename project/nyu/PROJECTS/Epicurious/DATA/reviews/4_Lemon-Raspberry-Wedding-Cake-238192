I made this cake for my future sister-in-laws wedding. I followed the directions and it turned out great. I did however use a different lemon curd recipe than the one provided here. I read the reviews for this lemon curd and there was too much inconsistency so I went with a lemon curd that had better reviews. There are a few things I learned along the way that will hopefully help you, they include: 1. Make the lemon curd in advance and make sure it's COLD when you layer the cakes. When it warms up it thins out and will begin to seep out the sides when you layer the cakes. 2. Make 1 batch of the meringue buttercream before you layer the cakes and use it to put an outer layer on the perimeter on the outside of the cakes. This will help keep the lemon curd and raspberries from seeping out the sides when you layer it. Trust me, it works. (Other reviews on here had issues with this but I didn't by doing this). 3. If you can afford fresh raspberries and they're in season buy them. I used frozen since it was the end of November but their juice got too much into the cake than I'd like. It wasn't soggy, just too much juice into the cake. 4. When frosting the cakes, just know that the first layer is going to be bad, just do your best. Refrigerate it till it's really cold, put 2nd layer of buttercream on and it'll begin to look better. Smooth it out as much as possible. Refrigerate it overnight for the Big Day. The next day put the 3rd batch of buttercream on and smooth it out as much as possible. It'll be much easier since the cake is cold and the buttercream will begin to hard once it hits the cake. It worked great when smoothing it. 5. Keep any extra buttercream out at room temp. even if it's overnight. It'll look a little separated but just put it back in the mixer and beat it with the whisk for a while and it will smooth out. 6. Definitely start the cake 2 days before the wedding, you can make the lemon curd 3 days before.

I am making my son's and daughter-in-law-to be's wedding cake and they have requested my carrot cake with cream cheese frosting. Having never made a tiered cake before, these videos make me feel like I can pull it off--thanks, Melissa!

Hi. Does anyone know if you are supposed to use three-inch-deep cake pans with this recipe or if it's OK to use two-inch deep pans? I can't find that information written anywhere in the recipe. I'm planning to try and make this cake for my wedding this summer! Thanks for the help!

I have made this recipe many times with perfect results.Having said that. I made it again last week and was very disappointed. I made it ahead of time and refridgerated as always. When I "reconstituted" it I broke down more than in the past but did finally come together. The problem is that it turned very yellow. Most times I've made this it has been in the summer. But somehow I don't think that would make a difference. Can Anyone help me. I will be making it again in a few months and don't want this to happen again.

Once again Melissa Murphy does not disappoint. Pair this with her Meringue Buttercream frosting and you have a sure hit. I have made this many times but I use a lemon cake and use white grape juice as the liquid in the recipe. It is so moist and light.

this is a great recipe. very easy to deal with and very yummy. yes, the cake is somewhat dense, almost like a pound cake. but this makes it very easy to handle, i.e. splitting them is easy, and paired with filling and buttercream is a perfect match. i bake a lot but had never done a wedding cake. i used this recipe for my brother's wedding last weekend and everyone was happy with it.

I made this wedding cake 4 my sis wedding in 2007. It was soooo easy to follow the directions. I didn't decorated the same way I used frosted grapes as the topper and cascading down the side. EVERYONE loved it and the caterers said it was the nicest they have ever seen. I am imporvising and making the same recipe 4 my daughters babyshower.

I am DIY-ing my own wedding cake, and did a test run with this recipe. Its FANTASTIC! I did 1/3 the recipe and it still made a huge cake, so I took the rest to work, and everyone there told me how much they loved it. the recipe is a little time consuming, a little picky (i.e., you need a candy thermometer for the icing, a double boiler for the lemon curd, etc...) but these aren't issues if you love to bake. I would not suggest you refrigerate the icing in bulk after making it. It was very difficult to get it smooth again, and even when I got it manageable enough to spread, it still wasnt the same as being just-made, it wasnt as fluffy. But when its just made, the icing is WONDERFUL. its so fluffy despite all the butter. It could use a tad more vanilla than what was called for though, but would be fine if kept as-is too. the lemon curd was amazing, and pretty easy to make. I never made a curd before and it turned out perfect. definitely use fresh lemons for the juice even though its time consuming. I ended up just using raspberries for the center (2nd) layer, instead of the 1st and 3rd layers because I thought it would already be a little tart. that, and fresh raspberries are pretty expensive. One layer of raspberries was fine. The cake part was a bit dense, which is how wedding cake should be, and it was slightly drier than boxed cakes, but the filling and the icing allow that to complement it nicely. Overall, Im very happy with this!

I made this cake for a friends last minute wedding. It was a HIT!!!! Some people thought I should open a bakery after trying it. The instructions were great, and easy to follow. I did not use the recipe for the white cake because someone had said it was dry(I used a box mix), and madethe different teirs different flavors. The Lemon, and the frosting were great. I am using the recipe again for another wedding cake, I hope it will be another hit.

chef from Chicago...This receipe should only use fresh fruit, it's quite tart with the lemon tart as is. Also, what should be a quite simple receipe, is quite dragged on and lengthy. Instructions not quite clear if you do not know your way around baking.

This is a great recipe. My only comment is that the yield on the lemon curd was more than twice what was needed. Considering the cost of the ingredients it was disheartening to have more than twice what was needed. I will use the leftover curd to make a trifle, but the recipe could easily be cut in half. Also, I used 5 half pints of raspberries and it was ample. Beautiful and delicious cake and the video was very helpful. Thank you Melissa!

Sweet Melissa is a genius! This was easy to do if you know your way around a kitchen. I used it for my daughters sweet 16. What a hit!
