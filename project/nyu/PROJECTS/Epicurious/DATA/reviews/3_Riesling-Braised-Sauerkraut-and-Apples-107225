This is the best sauerkraut recipe ever!

This was excellent. I used brandy instead of the schnopps and it was a great substitute. The cream is optional, but it definitely makes the dish! You might even win over a few sauerkraut haters with this recipe.

I made this last night along with pork. We all enjoyed this dish, the mellowness of the flavors was wonderful!! I reduced the cream to 1 cup (the other cup was in a potato gratin) This was a nice change from the usual robust kraut's.

Too many flavors are in competition here. The cream modified the combination but didn't resolve the competition. I prefer a more robust outcome with sauerkraut. The flavors were more appealing the second day.

My mother used to make something similar with a nice rolled pork roast, apples and sauerkraut, I always added a little caraway and brown sugar, but the reisling is a good sweetener. This would be wonderful with the pork added.
