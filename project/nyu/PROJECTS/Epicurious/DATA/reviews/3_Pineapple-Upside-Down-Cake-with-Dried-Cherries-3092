Didn't knock my socks off. I followed the recipe to the letter and found the end result to be a tad dry. Didn't rise much either. It was fun to make though - I love beating egg whites and folding things! - and the finished product is pretty. BTW, a 14 oz. can of pineapple is plenty; don't know why it stipulates a 20 oz. can.

This cake is fantastic! It is light and sweet and the presentation is beautiful. I've made it at least 10 times, and it is perfect every time. I don't change the recipe a bit.

My cake also came out flat, but I'm attributing it to the "fake" egg whites and yolks I used. It tasted fine, but it's hard for me to go wrong with sugar and pineapple, so I can't give the recipe much credit.

I was disappointed in this. I wanted something ooey-gooey and warm, and this didn't cut it. Too dry. Needs more topping. The cake came out to thin, not fluffy. So sad - and I'm the quintessential low-fat advocate! Need to find another way around all the fat.

Beautiful presentation. I thought it was a little dry, my husband and mother-in-law disagreed.

A great low-fat dessert! It came out moist and delicious. Great with coffee. I substituted dried blueberries for the cherries, which worked out fine.

I can't even taste the difference between the low-fat and normal pineapple-upside-down cakes! This was wonderful, full of flavor.

What a cake! Easy to make. We had all the ingredients in the house except (vanilla) and were ready to go. We used morello cherries (trader joes is the best place to get them) they added a nice tartness and we used coriander and cinnamon instead of vanilla. It turned out beautifully. A great beginner cake.

This was one of the best cakes I have ever tasted, period. The fact it was a lower-fat dessert was just a lucky bonus.

I have always wanted to try one of these. The cake turned out picture-perfect. I followed all directions exactly except I put a little more butter in the pan at the start.
