After reading the reviews, I followed other peoples advice, and added the garlic and a little oregano while sauteing the onions.I only had cremini mushrooms, so that was what I used. I also made extra bechamel sauce so that the pasta wouldnt dry out. Someone said it tasted like cream of mushroom soup with pasta. Yeah it did a little. My boyfriend who is a chef, said it was pretty bland for him, but I didnt mind it at all. I will definitely try adding some cooked chicken, and the sun dried tomatoes next time. We both agree, that we enjoyed this recipe a lot more: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Baked-Rigatoni-with-Sausage-and-Mushrooms-231288

After reading the recipe and some of the reviews, this did indeed sound like something that could be made delicious with a little adjustment. My results were terrific! I used the three varieties of mushrooms suggested, but sauteed up a heaping TBSP of garlic with my onions. I used 1/2 & 1/2 for the sauce, and added extra Parmesan. The sauce is pretty thin, but the consistency improves once it's added to the mushroom reduction. I also added about 1/2 cup of oil cured, julienne cut sun dried tomatoes that had been well drained, as well as about 2 cups of diced, cooked chicken. I cooked my pasta to slightly less done than al dente, tossed it with the sauce, and baked it in the casserole as suggested. I rather liked the crunchiness on the top. Though the dish was not a saucy one, I thought it was plenty moist. Just don't over bake it! 20 minutes is plenty. My family raved, and I'll be making this again.

The ragout is great, BUT....Do not bake. Make as sauce to serve over linguini, etc. Baking takes away/soaks up/breaks down too much liquid (not correctable) and almost inevitably overcooks pasta. I think done as a baked dish, it undercuts and unbalances the qualities of the ingredients.

This is a favourite, especially for mushroom lovers. I used green onions instead of chives, added extra milk to the sauce to make it creamier, and used Asiago to top it off. Can be made a day ahead, refrigerated, and then baked the next day. This is a keeper.

This is excellent. I made a few changes, added some heavy cream to the milk, substituted the 1/2 C of parmesan in the mixture with grated fontina. I also added chopped wilted swiss chard, marjoram, thyme and nutmeg. I took it as my offering at a large family gathering and it was a huge hit.

Solid recipe. I did feel it was like putting cream of mushroom soup into a bowl of penne pasta, then baking it. That's kinda what it is, but it was overall good.

I could see where the recipe as stands could be very bland, though I don't know how it would become dry! I used shiitake, oyster, and enoki mushrooms since button mushrooms and porcini are not available around me. I also added 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp of dried sage, basil, and oregano and 1T of minced roasted garlic. I served with a marinated pork tenderloin and steamed asparagus. Next time I will add chicken to the bake and serve it as a meal by itself.

I love mushrooms and put my all into preparing this dish. I followed recipe to the letter. VERY time consuming and the dish was so dry that it seemed like the penne came right out of the box it was hard like a brick! Very dry and pretty much gross, wasted alot of money and good food. I threw out the entire dish minus two bites! Where did I go wrong?

It was a time-investment but worth it.

I incorporated several of the suggestions given by others. Added lots of garlic, oregano, sage and black pepper to the sauce, and used more porcini than called for - still too blan! Also added a little bit of spinach to the mushrooms, which may have diluted it somewhat. But I don't think it is possible to rescue this one. Maybe some crushed chili peppers on top would have helped, but thought of it too late.

I would like to know if this recipe could be made beforehand [1 hour], and then put in the oven. If so would you refrigerate while waiting? This will be served to company and would like it to be all prepared so I don't have to be in the kitchen.

Based on previous reviews, I added salt, fresh pepper, fresh basil, fresh oregano, fresh garlic, shallots and some grilled chicken. I tried the mushroom / milk / chicken mixture before I added the seasonings and herbs and it was very bland. You need to really season the mixture and taste it. In addition, I used dried portabella mushrooms, and fresh white, crimini and shitake mushrooms. The water from the dried mushrooms is key I think so that the dish doesn't dry out. Based on these changes, I thought the dish was fantastic! I don't usually cook pasta without some type of protein, so I liked the chicken. I am making it again to bring to a friend who just had a baby....

I love mushrooms so really wanted to make this, but was rather skeptical after reading so many hohum reviews. So, I made a few changes: added 3 cloves minced garlic, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 3/4 cup white wine, lots of fresh ground pepper and reduced the milk to 11/2 cups and added 1 cup of plain yogurt. Otherwise I followed the recipe. With these changes, this was a great pasta dish - rich and tasty, and the nutmeg was a lovely complement to the mushroom flavours. It certainly did not resemble canned cream of mushroom soup at all! My only complaint is that it was a tad dry after baking, so next time I will reduce the oven temp and bake only 10-15 min until it is just heated through. Served with grilled chicken breasts, dilled sugar snap peas, a simple mixed green salad and Italian cheese bread. This will definitely go in my favourites file!

Even with the addition of wine, garlic and herbs, this dish was boring, it reminded me of a canned cream of mushroom soup casserole -- a waste of good ingredients. I honestly can't believe the recipe made it into a magazine.

I enjoyed this very much and have made it a few times now. I made a couple of changes however..I added some merlot to the ragout along with 2 large sliced italian yellow squash along with oyster and italian mushrooms. I also added fresh basil,dried thyme and a little minced garlic. I liked that I could prepare this in little time and it presented well. Everyone seems to enjoy this dish and I've been asked to make it time and time again.

Use plenty of black pepper. I thought it was screaming for some fresh herbs, probably tarragon, maybe thyme. It might have been nice to reduce some marsala or other wine in the sauteed mushroom mixture. Good comfort food. Not great, but good.

The whole family (two preschoolers included!) loved this meal. I will definitely make it again. Was a little time-consuming but worth the effort.

I added chicken - marinated strips of breast meat in olive oil and fresh thyme and garlic - and it was wonderful. Also added some thyme to the mushrooms. Skip the breadcrumbs - why bother.

this dish was great! I would highly recommend it. I didn't use the regular white mushrooms as I am not particularly fond of them and instead used a combination of porcini and oyster. also I only baked it for 10 minuntes (sans breadcrumbs) as I was too excited to eat.

I was somewhat disappointed with this recipe. Although it had a pleasing taste, the preparation was so time consuming that I know I will never make it again.

It was time-consuming to make, but it came out pretty good. I used more parmesan cheese than the recipe called for, and baby bella and shiitake mushrooms; next time I might add some garlic. I wasn't overly impressed with this recipe, but it was good enough to try again.

I used some different mushrooms than called for and it was still very good. The more mushrooms the better! I served this with baked pork steaks. What a great dinner!

A lot of work for a very mediocre dish. I was true to the recipe but got a rather dry, bland result.

This turned out to be not what I expected but maybe that is my fault. It was more of a Roux than a Ragu and tasted to me like a cream of mushroom soup recipe. I did like it because it was different than the way I usually cook but I won't be making it again.

I just made this dish for a bridal shower. I substituted portobello for the shitake mushrooms and couldn't find fresh chives. I decided to add garlic and hope for the best. It turned out great and I'll definitely make it again!

Another success! I made this dish for a new year's eve dinner. Instead of porcini mushrooms I used portobello mushrooms. Also, because I forgot to buy chives, I used a mixture of fresh thyme, rosemary, and marjoram with excellent results. Next time I'll add some fresh sage. Another one for my repetoire!

Y-u-u-u-um! The only change I made was to add a couple of cloves of crushed garlic at the end of sauteeing the onions. Made this for my parents while visiting them over Christmas and they've both raved about it at every dinner party we've attended since. They've actually asked me to make up a couple more batches and freeze them before I go home. Hope it holds up as well after coming thru the freezing process.

Great recipe! Delicious! Everyone in my very picky family - from grandma to the kids - loved it!

The day I made this, everyone in my group house asked to borrow the recipe. It's now a favorite of the house and so many more of my friends. It's easy to lower the fat by using spray for sauteing the 'shorooms, and then using only 2T to start the roux. I used fat free half and half instead of whole milk as well, so the only fat is the butter.

Any variety of mushrooms work just as well. This dish was just as good the second day.
