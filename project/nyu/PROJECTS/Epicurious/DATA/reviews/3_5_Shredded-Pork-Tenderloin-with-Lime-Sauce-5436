This was a nice quick weekday meal and a good use for pork tenderloin which is quite tasteless on its own. I can't say that I would think it guest-worthy but for a family dinner PERFECT

This is really fantastic! I like the tangy, creamy with a hint of bacon flavour. I followed it pretty much as is. Can't wait to serve to friends.

Pork (especially tenderloin) has been so inexpensive of late that we're constantly looking for novel ways to shake it up. I prepared the dish as instructed, BUT I doubled the sauce, as some suggested. This is a no-brainer, simple, satisfying and savoury. My only suggestion is that I think next time (and there *will* be a next time!) I will cube the pork, as opposed to cutting it in strips, just to lend a bit more integrity to it. The scallions added a nice freshness, so don't omit them! I ground one of my dried red chilis with a mortar and pestle and passed that at the table for those who wanted to spice it up even more; NICE!

An easy weeknight main course. Be careful not to overcook the pork as it is done very quickly

Fantastic! I didn't have pork. I made it with a combination of cut up chicken tenders and thighs. I cooked the bacon first. Removed the bacon and some grease. Added a touch of broth and some wine to the pan.... Cooked the chicken...Removed that...Cooked the onions and jalapeño...(Drank a glass of wine during this time)...Proceeded ahead with the recipe after that. Incredible!

I have made this once or twice a year since May 22, 1998. It is one of my huband's favorite dishes. I cut up the pork first and salt and pepper it an add a little cayenne. Than I chop and meaure all the ingredients once that is done, I brown the pork. I do not remove the bacon because it desolves and goes well with the pork. I add more liquid and cook it much longer. I add 1 cup of wine, 2 cups of chicken broth, and one cup of creme. I serve it over Jasmine rice and do add the finely chopped green onions on top. This makes excellent left overs because the rice soaks up the sauce. I use two cups of uncooked rice and chicken broth to make enough for dinner and leftovers.

Phenomenal! Quick, easy and delicious! The bacon added that extra something. The lime juice pairs perfectly with the pork.

I have made this recipe more times than I can count. I always double it. Freezes well. My eleven year old daugter requests this recipe more than any other. I serve it over Basmati rice.

Made this tonight because it's a LONG way to the grocery store and I needed to use what I had. My "riff" on tihs used crushed red pepper flakes in place of the fresh pepper and coconut milk instead of cream. Served over jasmine rice with some roasted asparagus on the side. We liked it a lot!!!

I've made this recipe several times substituting butter for the bacon (just didn't have it on hand) and everyone loved it. Made it again this week with the bacon and we'll never make it that way again! It really changes the flavor of the dish and not for the better. I'll definetly make again, but never with the bacon.

Served this with sauteed shredded cabbage. The combination was great. Even the picky kids liked this one (sans cabbage, that is).

I have made this several times now. Sometimes with white rice and once with couscous. I also render the bacon first then add the onions and jalepeno. I have also made the mistake of using bottled lime juice once, it really changed the flavor. I had to promise the DH not to do that again! I wouldn't call this shredded pork. I cut the tenderloin into thin slices while it is still partially frozen. Yummy every time!

I tried this last night and my husband and I both loved it. He tends to be a bit pickly, but he said it was delicious and would definitely eat it again. I followed the recipe with one exception, I used charcoal cooked barbecued pork tenderloin from my freezer which had originally been marinated in KC Masterpiece Lemon Pepper marinade. Whenever I barbecue I try to do several meals at a time, so I had the tenderloin on hand and ready for the recipe. It added a great flavor! I will also consider other suggestions of adding cilantro and a couple more pieces of bacon next time.

This was so good. I licked my plate, the sauce was so good. I followed the advice of other reviewers and cooked the bacon separately, until crisp, and added to the sauce while it reduced. I served it with cumin and lime rice, and asparagus. Mmmm - a major keeper!

Made this dish last night for my husband, my teenage son and his five friends. Everybody loved it. I also added garlic and cilantro and cooked the bacon seperately. The lime juice definitely gave it a good taste. Serve it over rice.

Good flavors, but definitely needed adjustments. I sauteed 4 cloves of garlic before adding the onions, cooked the bacon separately as others did, and sprinkled the whole thing with chopped cilantro at the end. The cilantro was a BIG help. Next time, I think I'll sautee some yellow peppers after the onions for extra color and veg content.

Enjoyed this quite a bit. Added an extra 2 strips of bacon. As another review suggested, I did cook the bacon first in the microwave so it was crispy and added it to the sauce instead of cooking with the onion. I served it over pasta - a fairly quick and satisfying dinner.

Spectacular and easy. I'm dumbfounded that anyone could give this dish a low rating. The pork tenderloin melted in my mouth. The flavors were full but not overpowering. Lime juice gave the meal just the right boost.

This was very good however is missing something. Thai basil maybe? I also added two cloves of garlic. Next time I will add an herb of some sort. Will definitely make again.

I used about a quarter cup more lime juice which was good. I would slice the pork thinner than I did which was about 3/8 of an inch. So basically as thin as you can. As another reviewer stated, a little bit of garlic might be a nice. touch to accent the lime. I served it with a rice almond pilaf and asparagus sauteed with bacon which was a nice flovor blend. Also next time I make it I'll double the jalapeno and leave some seeds in to kick up the spicy quotient. It's a good dish to try and then experiment to suit your own tastes. It does cook up fast though, so that's convenient.

I loved the flavor of this dish and will certainly make it again. The only change I made was using scotch bonnet peppers (with the red/yellow/green color) instead of the jalapenos; I can't imagine the taste being any better with the jalapenos. I also omitted the green onions. This was wonderful!

I will try this again, with a little tweeking. I was pressed for time, so I sauteed the bacon with the onion... big mistake. Next time, I will fry it alone and put it back in later. I thought it was a little too limey and could definitely use a little more jalapeno... simmering it in the sauce mellows out the flavor. Has potential!!

I have made this twice. The first time I made it exactly as specified, except my pork strips were more thick than thin. I liked it OK, but I figured I'd try it again, this time cutting the pork into VERY thin strips while it was still partially frozen. Again made it exactly to specs except I didn't have bacon. Came out MUCH better--but next time I'll probably add bacon because it does add a good flavor. This is good for take to work lunches.

I also added garlic to this dish and cooked the bacon before adding the onion so I had crisp rendered pieces in the sauce. I seared the pork in larger strips and then sliced them smaller before adding them back to the sauce. I served this with zucchini couscous (also a Gourmet recipe) I am definitely making this again!

This is a super tasty dish - I tweaked it a bit by first cooking the bacon and storing it in a seperate dish, then after draining the grease, I sauteed the pork tenderloin it it. I then removed the pork and added it to the dish with the bacon. I then added the onions and jalapeno and sauteed till translucent, added the wine, reduced it, then in goes the chicken stock and cream. Add the pork and bacon, lime juice and tomatoes in and voila! Any extra time this may take adds incredible dimension to this dish. Everyone always has seconds and sometimes even thirds!!!!!

Were I to make this dish again, I would substitute coconut milk for the cream. Overall not a stellar meal.

Gee I'm surprised about all the people that didn't like this! I made this pork last night and we loved it. Unfortunately, I didn't have a jalapeno pepper, so I just put in a dash of cayenne. Between the bacon and lime, the sauce had a unique flavor and my husband and I thought it was delicious. I actually prepared this one night ahead and let it sit for a day and re-heated it the next day and it the meat got very tender and flavorful. It was very easy to make and I would make it again!

Time consuming?????? I don't think so. It was delicious as is. Next time I will serve it with frosty bottles of Corona beer with lime. Great for a summer meal.

I usually never have to rate a recipe with only one fork. I tried this because I thought it sounded wonderful. Both my husband & I were far from impressed. It landed up being too much work for how it landed up tasting. I actually found it rather bland for all that was in it. You would of thought with all those ingriedients it would of been great. Normally my reviews are in synch with other reviews. However, I do see this one is getting real mixed reviews.

I was very disappointed in this recipe; it was a waste of good pork tenderloin. The flavors just did not come out like I thought they would. I love to cook with lime so I thought it sounded really good. But it was not nearly as good as other recipes for pork found on Epicurious!

I also cooked the bacon by itself until it was almost crispy, and then added the onion and jalapeno. The flavor is good, but needs "something".... I think I may try adding some bottled Pick-A-Peppa and that might just do the trick next time. Maybe also add more bacon. At any rate, it is worth trying! KIMBER

I make this dish often. Its really wonderful. I cut the tenderloin in 1" pieces and serve with Jasmine Rice and Haricot Verts. Serve with a New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc. Enjoy!

Make this dish with cumin rice...the combination of cumin and lime is out of this world! I also make the bacon ahead of time and pour off the fat before adding the other ingredients, and add more lime juice.

I really liked this recipe. To cut down on fat, I used condensed skim milk. I also marinated the pork in olive oil and garlic for an hour. I think the next time i make this i will reduce the amount of lime. This recipe is a little time consuming but I think it is worth it.

This was OK but not worth the effort. Save the calories of the cream and eat the tenderloin grilled!!! It's easier and much better that way

I really liked this recipe and found it easy to prepare. I found that I preferred to cook the bacon until crisp and then add the onion and pepper. This keeps the bacon from getting soggy when adding the wine. Also, I left out the whipping cream (who needs the extra calories). It It really lightens up the dish and is equally delicious.

My Guests LOVED this receipe. The only thing that I did different was that I marinated the shredded pork with the olive oil and 2 cloves of garlic for 20 minutes then continued on with the recipe.

It's a good basic recipe, but needs a few upgrades. For starters, use much more lime juice. The last time I made it, I doubled the lime juice and it was better. Second, cook the bacon in a microwave or in a skillet before adding. Next, eliminate the green onion garnish. Too overpowering, the onions used in the basic recipe are enough. Finally, use garlic. I'm a big backer of the use of garlic whenever possible and reasonable. If you use it, however, brown it first or used roasted garlic. That way, it fits in with the other ingredients as an accompaniment and does not overpower the other ingredients. I hope you all like these changes, they sure do work for me.

When reading the recipe, I thought it sounded so good......and I was so disappointed! I love the flavor of lime, but thought it made this sauce much too sour. The final tasting was not a pleasant one.
