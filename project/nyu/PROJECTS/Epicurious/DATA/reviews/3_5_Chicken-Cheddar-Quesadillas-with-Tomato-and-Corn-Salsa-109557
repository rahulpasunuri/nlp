Really enjoyed this -- I used smaller whole wheat tortillas. Put one on the bottom and topped with cheese, cubed chicken and red pepper, & more cheese, then the other tortilla. Flipped them so the cheese melted on both sides. Cut them into wedges and served them on the plate with a spoonful of Avocado and Corn Salsa and a dollopof sour cream. Very quick, light refreshing dinner on a very hot & humid evenig.

I thought this recipe was pretty good but not great (I actually would have rated it 2.5 stars). I would have chopped up the chicken tenders into chunks since it took the chicken longer to cook than stated therefore the onions and garlic overcooked.

Yummy -- I added the spices to a bit of flour and dredged the chicken bits in that. I also added a thin layer of honey-chipotle sauce (tomato paste/honey/chipotle/lime juice) to the quesadilla. Like others, I used a medium salsa. The chicken rocked the house and the crispy onion/garlic bits were awesome.

Great recipe! For 2 of us, I sauteed a chicken breast and shredded it and added a minced jalapeno (based on reviews) otherwise followed the quesadilla recipe. For the salsa, I used medium salsa (not verde) and added the ingredients called for and it was fabo!

This recipe turned out to be a fast and outstanding surprise. Instead of salsa verde, used roasted pepper/black bean salsa and only had manchego cheese. The result was fast and delicious, received high marks from my husband. Will definitely make again.

I think there is a misprint in the title; it should probably read "Tomatillo and Corn Salsa" due to the salsa verde. Anyway, this recipe really is delicious. The salsa makes run-of-the-mill quesadillas something special. I serve these with guacamole too.

Great quesadillas! The recipe could have been written differently to be a bit more clear but this recipe is nonetheless a keeper!

It was delicious, but I added lime juice and jalapenos to the salsa. Also, the title is Tomato and corn salsa, but never mentions tomato in the ingredients or preparation again. I didn't use tomatoes. Also, I used Monterey jack cheese. I have already served this twice again. Delicious

I made this recently for a small party. It was an awesome dish to serve - and very well recieved by talented critics with great palates for Mexican foods. I did a few things differently. I did make my own salsa verde - thanks to the reviewer from Texican! When making the salsa, I added fresh corn (I cut it off the cobb) to a saute of onions and yellow and orange bell peppers. This added nice color and flavor to this salsa once it all came together. I was surprised I was out of chili powder - I used cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes instead. Also, I used a combo of cheddar and pepper jack cheeses. Yum!

Such a simple yet delicious recipe! I like to put some diced jalapenos in with the chicken while it's cooking for a bit more heat. You could do without that salsa.

The quesadillas were okay, but nothing special. The salsa mix would probably have improved if I had made the salsa verde myself.

I love this recipe. It's so easy to make and absolutely delicious. Especially when you make the salsa with fresh summer corn! Yum. I will definitely be making this again.

This was really good and my family loved it. The corn salsa makes the dish, but I think will make half next time since there was tons left over. I marinated the chicken in the spices as suggested, and grilled it. I also used white corn tortillas, layering them like a sandwich, because that's what I had on hand. They came out very crispy and tasty, although a bit messy as some of the cheese leaked out. Served with guacamole and sour cream.

Even my husband loved this recipe and he is not a fan of quesadillas!! I too used Monterey Jack plus cheddar and will serve it again!!

This was perfect for a weeknight dinner. I substituted Monterey Jack for the cheddar and served the quesadillas with chili beans on the side. It tastes just like something I would get in an upscale Mexican restaurant. Using good quality salsa and fresh cilantro really made the dish. Will definately make this again next time I'm in the mood for Mexican.

I constantly challenge myself to find recipes that will suit the tastes of my family: 5yr olg picky eater son, 10yr old girl who won't eat onions and husband who hates tomatoes. I won't custom-cook for each (there isn't enough money nor thanks..!). This recipe incorporates all the foundations of a tasty meal with the option of leaving out a sprinkle of cilantro here and a layer of onion there. My family have asked for this to be added to their list of favorites. I liked the fact that we all have these ingredients somewhere in our kitchen. No need to custom-shop in advance.

Delicious and fun! I too used the grill to cook them all at once; the smoke added another yummy flavor dimension. (Check the recipe for Chicken and Mushroom Quesadillas here on Epicurious for the method). I marinated the chicken all day--served with the corn salsa, guacamole, and sour cream to dip, then washed it all down with margaritas-- so good!

I thought that this recipe was quick and easy. The kids loved it and the leftovers were good the next day.

I used really good aged cheddar, and so it was very tasty. I used precooked chicken, it worked fine. And I cooked them on my gas grill, a method used by another quesadilla recipe, it makes it easy to cook them all at once.

This was a hit with my husband and Mom! I made the salsa according to the recipe, using mild Pace picante sauce. I agree that the reference to the "Verde Salsa" was very vague. After referring to the reviews I decided not to worry about it and just used the picante. I took the garlic, cumin, chili powder and thin slices of chicken breats and marinated them in that rub for several hours. Then I put the chicken on the grill. It took less than 10 minutes to BBQ them and the BBQ flavor enhanced the quesadillas. I put the tortilla in the pan, topped with the chicken, then the salsa and cheese. Let it cook long enough to get golden on one side and then flipped over to brown the other side. Husband went nuts!!!! Served with quacamole, sour cream, the extra corn salsa, refries and lettuce. This is a keeper!!!

Forget the title of the recipe, it's the corn that makes this truly different. Salsa verde is the GREEN salsa you can now find just about anywhere. I used frozen roasted corn (trader joe's)in the salsa and added sauteed mushrooms, onions and peppers to the quesadillas. I made them on the grill and the only problem was it got a little messy. The real showstopper in this recipe is the corn salsa. We served this as a meal but it would also make a great appetizer. A keeper!

I would echo the thanks to the rater from Texican for providing the salsa verde receipe.... I loved how the sweet red onion and garlic, the acidity of the tomatillos and spicy jalapenos all combined to make this a very tasty dish! We couldn't stop eating them. If you don't buy chicken tenders and use chicken breasts instead, be sure you cut the chicken into chunks before cooking. Otherwise, it'll take the chicken too long to cook and you'll burn/overcook the onion and garlic.

Thanks to the cook from Texcan, I really enjoyed cooking and serving this dish, the guests loved the salsa and I certanly will serve this dish again in the future.

Great recipe, and yes, salsa DOES have tomato but not the common red tomato. Here's my salsa verde recipe so you don't have to buy it: 10 tomatillos (these are green and look like tomatoes) 5 jalapeños, 1 garlic clove, chopped 1/2 tsp salt ½ finely chopped medium onion 1/8 tsp sugar cilantro chopped Boil tomatillos and jalapeños in just enough water to cover until tomatillos turn dull green color and are cooked. Cut stems from peppers and put them, garlic and salt in blender with some cooking liquid. Blend well adding more liquid if needed. Stir in remaining ingredients and serve. Ojalá que les gusten.

very simple and good... as for the tomato/salsa verde debate, obviously it is a mistake in the title, if you want tomato and corn salsa just buy regular salsa or make your own. it's really not hard. if you like to cook, you should be able to read a recipe and use it as a guideline, not hard and fast rules. and the 1/4 cup plus 6 tablespoons is divided as such because that's how you use it in the recipe, duh....

To many errors! There are no tomatoes in salsa verde. Alos 1/4C plus 6Tbs is 1/2C plus 2Tbs....

There's something wrong with the title or the ingredients. The title calls for TOMATO and corn salsa but there isn't any TOMATO in the list of ingredients and purchased CHUNKY SALSA VERDE doesn't contain tomato (at least, not in Texas where I live).

Excellent recipe if you like cumin, which I do. I made the recipe with 1/2 lb. of shrimp and 1/2 lb. chicken. Personally, I think all shrimp might be better. A homemade salsa would also be better if you have the time, but in a pinch, the store bought is fine. Also, guacamole would be a nice addition.

This is a good base recipe, but can definitely take some tweaking. I used leftover lime marinated grilled chicken, and grilling does make a difference. The cook below who used fresh salsa has the right idea, and, of course, use fresh Jersey corn rather than frozen kernels. ;)

Nothing groundbreaking, but ideal for those days when all you crave is something reliable and familiar. They have a robust flavor and are not too taxing to put together after a day at work. I used my own salsa fresca recipe (tomatoes, red onion, jalapeno, garlic, lime juice, cilantro) rather than the tomato and corn salsa. Next time I might try grilling the chicken and the onions for more kick.
