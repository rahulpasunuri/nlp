Eh. These were OK, but maybe it's because I wasn't able to follow the recipe "exactly" as written. I used others' suggestions and made it with canned salmon, added capers, more lemon zest, lemon juice, Tabasco, and Worcestershire. I pan-fried them in a non-stick skillet with a small amount of olive oil. Mine turned out somewhat dry and the flavor was salty. The Lemon Mayo, however, was a HUGE hit.

This is my new go-to salmon cake recipe. I took the advice of other reviewers and added a dash of Worcestershire sauce and a few capers, plus a couple dashes of pepper sauce (just a bit of Tiger sauce or Tabasco will add a subtle kick). I cooked them on the stovetop in some olive oil and they came out perfect. To save on cholesterol and fat grams I used a non-dairy, soy-based mayo; reduced the amount of mayo by half but kept the amount of onion and lemon the same - delicious.

This is a perfect, easy, quick summer meal. The kids love it too. I've made it to the letter, and also with some changes (red onion instead of green and wheat germ instead of bread crumbs)and each time was great. It does make too much mayo but since we're not big mayo fans anyway, I used onion and lemon juice and just slightly thickened with mayo. Gives it a nice light flavor.

I liked this, but the texture was a bit mushy for me. Perhaps add an egg next time? We didn't have parsley for the salmon patties so I used some thyme for flavour. We made the sauce exactly to the recipe, but felt it needed a bit of extra oomph. We added a 1/2 tsp garlic powder, a dash of worchestshire and a 1/2 tsp dill. Overall, pretty good.

Excellent recipe. We used canned sockeye salmon and substituted dill for the parsley. Super tasty. We did make less than 1/2 the mayo and found it more than sufficient. Can not wait to make again.

I loved this very simple, very tasty recipe for salmon cakes. Panko makes all the difference (instead of regular breadcrumbs). I also added capers to the mix but otherwise made the cakes just as described. Instead of the lemon mayo though I made the tartar sauce here: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Tartar-Sauce-5891. Was delicious!

I made these for my family several times. Everyone loves the salmon cakes. The boys, ages 7-16, say it's their favorite fish recipe. My 7 year old calls it pink chicken. Chopping the fresh salmon in the food processor is easier than it sounds. The fresh salmon cakes were browned nicely on the outside while on the inside they were cooked and moist. The lemon (and onion) mayonnaise is a fresh and flavorful upgrade from tartar sauce.

This was delicious and loved by both adults and kids in my family. A definite keeper. Very quick and easy to make and the patties barbecued beautifully without sticking or falling apart.

I can't stand fish but I adore this recipe. We've made it for several dinner parties and it's always been a big hit. Adjustments - we cut down on the mayonnaise recipe because it makes way too much, also added more lemon juice to cut the richness of the fish and add more tang. Use panko instead of other breadcrumbs - the texture is much better. These freeze very well and taste great as leftovers (if you have any)!

I really like the way these salmon cakes turned out. Gave me a new way to prepare all that salmon I had in my freezer. I used tarragon instead of parsley and plain breadcrumbs instead of the japanese ones. I really like the lemon mayonnaise too.

I've made these cakes twice, once grilled and once pan-fried. Both times I added some finely chopped capers and lemon zest to the salmon mixture itself. Both times they were a hit. Also, just made four big patties from the mix, so they stayed moister. Will defintely make again.

I used leftover fresh Coho salmon, and I pan grilled in olive oil. The flavor was delicate but flavorful, and the texture was light and melt-in-your mouth.

this dish was so BLAH. and my house smelled awful after cooking these to boot! i have another recipe for salmon cakes that is excellent; it uses cream & egg to hold everything together, red & green peppers for color & flavor, & tabasco for kick. i'll be making that recipe next time.

This was nothing special. The cakes AND the sauce had no flavor.

I have made this recipe several times. Sometimes I have made it exactly to specifications and others I substitute items that I have on hand. I have grilled them as well as pan-frying. All have turned out wonderfully. I have even converted staunch salmon-haters with this recipe, having them begging for more. This one is a keeper!!!

Only having fresh salmon on hand, I followed the general directions for this recipe and it was still a smash hit. Instead of fresh parsley I rehydrated some dried parsley in a bowl of water for ten minutes and then food processed it with about half a white onion. I next added the salmon, dijon, etc, but did not process it too finely for texture. I added regular breadcrumbs and a whole egg, and stirred this up by hand. When I formed the patties, I coated both sides in extra breadcrumbs. When frying, I used both butter and olive oil - be sure to use fresh oil and butter for each pan of cakes. Also be sure to pay fry over medium heat so that the salmon gets cook all the way. About the dipping sauce, add twice the lemon zest and lemon juice, and a little parsley for color.

I followed the cook from Elgin, Illinois and pan fried these. Instead of mayo I substituted Trader Joes garlic mustard aoili. More panko in mixture and also coated the outside. The salmon (wild salmon from the NW of course) turned out moist and flaky inside..definitely a keeper. For a more lowfat sauce (to balance out the high fat frying) I used the 1-2 T aoili again, lemon juice, lowfat sour cream, and lowfat yogurt. Serve it with some simple greens and you have an easy meal in under 30 minutes!

This is a great base recipe. I did however, tweak it a bit, and got phenomenal reviews. (We own a German restaurant in Elgin & always have willing guinea pigs who are brutally honest).. I did NOT grill these. I did a trial one, and sure enough, it looked like a hamburger, and was very dry. I just took the olive oil set out for this and added it to my MARGARINE in the skillet to saute my salmon cakes in. I added more breadcrumbs than called for as well as an egg to help hold it all together. I had extra parsley, so in the mayonnaise it went. I increased the lemon juice in the mayo (it was sooooo mayonnaise-y otherwise), and a chopped avocado. Have fun with this, it is a GREAT dish.
