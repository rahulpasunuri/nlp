Like with all fruit based deserts, the quality of the finished product depends on the quality of the fruit. Excellent when the apricots are ripe and juicy, so-so using the aneamic fruit of the off season. One note of caution: better leave a full 24 hours for the bavarois to set up. I also found that using a glass bottomed pan makes the serving easier.

Love apricots and love chocolate, but this just wasn't the thiller I was hoping for.

Good, not great. This is certainly not a difficult recipe but it was fairly time consuming. I made the mistake of sampling the apricot puree before mixing it with the custard - delicious! Subsequently, the end result was somewhat of a letdown. I would definitely make the puree again and serve over ice cream but I wouldn't do the rest.

The preparation of the recipe at first seems complicated and involved. In reality it goes together fairly quickly and returns a very unusual apricot pudding dessert that will have your guests talking to themselves. Very different, very good. I also happen to love apricots.
