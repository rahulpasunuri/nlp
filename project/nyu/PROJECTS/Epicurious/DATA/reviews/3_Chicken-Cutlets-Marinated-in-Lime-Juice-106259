Haven't made this yet because I don't know which Maggi sauce to use. There are many. Can anyone help?

Very dissapointed. What's the great sensation here? All it tasted like to us was chicken soaked in lime juice. Totally lost was any flavoring from the Maggi sauce.

I did this with Chilean sea bass, instead of bird. It rocks!

Addendum to earlier review, I also grilled chicken instead of pan frying.

Reminiscent of a recipe that my Mom used to make for pork. Prepared 2X the recipe for 3# of boneless chicken thighs, except I only used 3T. of garlic-infused olive oil. Maggi sauce was a great addition. Simply served with steamed brown jasmine rice, and steamed broccoli with a squeeze of lemon juice.

I'm sorry folks, but I didn't find this to be all THAT. I had high hopes for it, after reading everyone's rave reviews, but I just wasn't "wowed" by it & thought it was a bit too salty. And yes, I followed the recipe TO THE LETTER. It wasn't a total waste however - at least I got to use the Maggi seasoning that I brought home from Mexico last year ;-)

Chicken is as delicious and satisfying as other reviewers have commented. I cooked the chicken breast medallion (small part off of the breast) aside and cooked with same recipe--put on top of french roll and put the boiled marinade sauce in the sandwich like a po'boy. A bit greasy, but a crowd pleaser!

Very easy, different weeknight meal, and a nice change from the ordinary. The Maggi sauce is interesting - I had never heard of it before I read about it here. My sister-in-law, who is of Dominican descent, told me her family uses Maggi (made by Nestle, by the way),in boullion form, quite frequently. You learn something new every day.....

this recipe is one of the easiest recipes that i have ever made. i followed the recipe verbatim and the results were amazing. the chicken was juicy and very flavorful. i have made this recipe a few times now and most recently used chicken breasts that were about 1.5" thickness and marinated for double the time, and although it was still flavorful, it did not compare to the thin chicken cutlets. this recipe is a keeper.

Tried this recipe tonite with turkey cutlets that were a litle too thin (OK, I had no chicken). I also had no Maggi so I added some worcestershire sauce (just a little). All in all I was pleased with it. I did make a mango salsa to go with it which made it nice and fresh tasting for a day that was almost 90 degrees. I combined mango, kiwi, red peppers, red onion and a bit of jalapeno (all chopped, of course) with some lime juice, freshly ground black pepper and just a drop of olive oil (I'm not sure why but it seemed like the thing to do at the time). I'd definitely make again with any cutlets - chicken, turkey, pork, veal would all be OK.

I've made this a few times and have gotten great reviews from my husband and 15 month old baby. It's great for an easy and tasty week night meal. Goes great with white rice and guacamole. yum!

Maggi Sauce is a condiment sauce. It's somewhat like a slightly thick soy sauce. It can be found in the gourmet sections of supermarkets as well as in Asian markets. If I didn't have any, I'd use thick Chinese soy mixed with some worstershire. If you can find the Maggi Sauce grab it. It lasts virtually forever in the fridge. Get a small bottle, though. I run across very few recipes that call for it. It's used as a table condiment in Asia and is often seen on the tables at Vietnamese restaurants here in the States.

Haven't tried the recipe, just wanted to answer your question. Maggi is a brand name of boullion. You can find it wherever you would find chicken/pork/beef boullion. I did notice that the boullion contains MSG if that's a concern for you.

I couldn't find Maggi sauce, and didn't know what to substitute it with, so the sauce came out overly tart. Can someone tell me what Maggi sauce is?

This was delicious and got rave reviews from my husband. I added some chopped cilantro to the marinade. I would double the sauce next time. We had it with spanish saffron rice and sauteed zucchini, perfect midweek meal!

This was easy and great. I will use Tablespoon proportions (or more)next time, not teaspoons, because the resulting sauce was a fabulous addition to my rice and peas side dish.
