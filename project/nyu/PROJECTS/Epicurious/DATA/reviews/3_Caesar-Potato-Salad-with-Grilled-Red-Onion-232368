Okay, but nothing special. Added kalamata olives because it needed something else, but it still was just okay.

Excellent salad. My family loves the flavor of grilled red onion which was a great addition to this recipe. Next time I make this salad, I am going to roast some red peppers to add some color to the salad

We thought this dish was okay. I do not think that it was worth the effort - the joke was made "this is an onion salad not a potato salad".

My husband loved this, and it's so easy to do the onions if something already needs grilling. The online posting has some mistakes; it says Gourmet, while it was actually published in Bon Appetit, also it mentions where to find chili garlic sauce, which isn't found in this recipe but in another recipe on the same page.

Very easy to make and so delicious! This salad disappeared quite quickly. The dressing has a good spicy kick.
