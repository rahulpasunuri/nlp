Excellent recipe. This is my "go to" brisket dish since it is easy to make, delicious, and beautiful. I make it two days ahead of time so there's time to meld the ingredients and have a snack or two.

Absolutely delicious! It was well worth the time and was a big hit for my dinner party. Will definetly make it again and would not change one thing about this recipe. Perfect dish!

If you have never made brisket before-- be careful! This is time consuming and absolutely not worth the effort. I made the sauce and could not bring myself to cook the brisket- it smelled bad and tasted worse- the cloves seemed to overpower everything else and it tasted too sour to pour over my 12 lbs. of meat. I scrapped it all the night before my Seder and made a simpler recipe with wine which was delicious.

So sorry, the review below was for the Cauliflower-Leek Kugel, which I made to go with the brisket. The brisket, likewise, was extraordinary -- the best brisket I've every made. The flavor of the sauce was perfect. Followed recipe exactly, save that I cooked it a bit longer.

I made this for an (early) seder this year to rave reviews. While kugel connotes heavy, bland, and tasteless, this dish was light, with delicate flavor -- a real treat. I can imagine making it as a regular vegetable dish anytime. I followed recipe exactly, but did add cremini mushrooms (and cooked them at the same time as leeks). Fantastic!

I skipped the puree step and tossed everything in the slow cooker for 6 hours. It was yummy comfort food. This makes a large amount; I had to freeze some. I might cut the recipe in half next time.

A great change from my classic dried-fruit recipe, with deep, intriguing flavors that one guest, a chef, called "worthy of Spago" (yes, he meant it as a compliment). Dellicious sliced cold with fresh horseradish sauce - always a challenge to work through all the Passover leftovers, isn't it?

I thought this was fair -- my best brisket recipe is the old-fashioned one my grandma made, sorry! Way to much prep work. Yes, it was very tender and my guests seemed to devour it, I just don't think it's the best brisket recipe out there.

Made for Passover. Excellent flavor. Guests loved the light and the slightly thinner sauce. I cooled it and sliced the brisket the next day, put it back into its original shape and reheated a full hour in the sauce. Very tender. A winner!

The flavors of this brisket were awesome. I didn't need to thicken the sauce--it came out perfectly--although I did cook it a touch longer than it said the last hour. This is a definite keeper.

My comments below erroneously triggered a 2 star rating, don't know why, as it's a 4-star recipe in my book and I have indeed made it again.

Advice to the cook from Sunnyvale - I'm puzzled by your outcome. Perhaps your cut of meat was not of high quality - I just made a double batch of this with brisket from Whole Foods and it's exceptionally tender. Also, instead of thickening your sauce by adding cornstarch, you should reduce it over high heat after removing the solids. This both thickens and concentrates the flavors.

I've only made Brisket one time before. This was a LOT of work, the flavor was pretty good, the meat wasn't very tender, the sauce was too thin (I thinckened it with cornstarch). Perhaps cooking it even longer would have worked out. I thought it was a LOT of chopping for the results I got.

Delicious. After years of serving my own brisket creation, I tried this one in small-batch mode prior to Passover. It's quite nice. I had two bags of Trader Joe's chopped dates, so used some of those in lieu of whole ones. Other than that, followed as written and quite delighted with the result. Will be making 10 pounds of this this for 15 people next week.
