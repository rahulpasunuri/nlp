Whenever I try a new recipe from Epicurious I always glance at the reviews to see what changes other readers have suggested or how they rate it, but I rarely let a poor review stop me from trying a recipe if I like all the ingredients. That's why I'm so glad I tried this recipe, even though at this stage only 78% would make it again. We loved it, along with the peppers and onions we grilled along with it. Served with a left-over potato salad, we thought it was a great, good-for-us, meal.

It's actually good contrary to some of the reviews posted here. Be sure to marinade the chicken for a longer time. That's the trick to this recipe. I also added garlic, Worcestershire sauce and chili powder to the marinade for extra kick. Rubbing salt and pepper on the chicken just before you put them into the marinade is better than sprinkling them with S&P before grilling them. And if you want it to be sweeter, add another or two tablespoons of honey. If you can't grill for any reason, you could try frying them.

this was soooo good! the sauce is simple, yet so tasty. I agree. Letting it marinade for longer and making more of the sauce is the trick.

We LOVE this recipe - I have made it several times, and it's always really popular. That plus how easy it is makes it a winner. A few small changes I make: Boneless chicken thighs instead of breasts are a MUST - much richer flavor. Marinate in the entire lemon mixture. Pour off however much you want to have for sauce when finished marinating, reduce per recipe. I've recently added chopped fresh rosemary, which was really good. Have never added garlic (thighs have enough flavor without it), but sounds like a good variation. During non-grill season, brown the meat, cook the onions, then braise in the marinate - different, but also really good.

I was surprised how tasteless this was. I added garlic but it didn't help. I made it because it sounded so easy but I would never make this again.

I was expecting very little from this recipe, based on the lackluster reviews, but was very pleasantly surprised by the results. First, this recipe is painfully simple, a must for week-nights. Second, I followed several reviewers' advice and added three cloves of garlic to the marinade (which I doubled), and salt-and-peppered the chicken generously before marinating. I figured that any meat merinade that does not include garlic must be a misprint. The chicken marinated for about ninety minutes at room temperature in about two-thirds of the marinade, the rest of which I kept warm on the stove for saucing. I grilled the chicken for sixteen minutes, turning and basting once. The result was a flavorful chicken breast which retained moisture well and received a bright, tangy flavor from the marinade. Served it over Basmati to family from ten to forty five years old, and all liked it very much; which is why I cook in the first place.

I would give this recipe half a fork, if possible. The marinade was not well balanced at all and imparted a bad taste to the exterior of the chicken. The marinade would be better with less lemon juice and more soy sauce and perhaps substituting chopped garlic for the onion. I marinated the chicken for 4 hours in the refrigerator and an additional 1/2 hour at room temperature before grilling it, but the marinade did not penetrate into the interior of the chicken. The only thing this recipe has going for it is that it was extremely easy to make, but there are many better easy recipes to be found.

I don't have a grill at my apartment, so I simply used the marinade and cooked the chicken in a pan. It was very good and I will definitely made this recipe again.

Just so-so. I gave it a long marinade. Added some garlic. It's just not great.

I also doubled the sauce. The grilled chicken is kind of bland without it(even after hours of marination) but the sauce does "make" the recipe. And it appears to be fairly low fat as well.

LOVED this dish!! Yes, S & P breasts before cooking. I made 2x the amount of sauce and was able to get bites of onion glaze with each bite of the chicken. This goes in my "best bets" file!!

This is a truly delicious and simple dish to make. I make it when I don't have a lot of time or haven't thought about dinner. The dish uses ingredients that are always in my home. The key however is to season (salt,pepper) the chicken ahead of time.

After reading the reviews(a wide range of opinions)about this recipe I was interested to see what we would think. I marinated it for 4 hours in the fridge and 1 hour at room temp and I agree that it didn't give it a huge amount of flavor, but I followed the recommendations of other cooks and used half the boiled glaze on the grill and served the other half at the table and it was very good. I used 1.25lbs. of chix breast and found the marinated to be enough. I served with cole slaw and it went well together.

I made this for for guests along with grilled asparagus and yellow squash, with grilled glazed nectarines (My wife enjoyed me doing all the cooking on the grill). It was good, and my guests said how delicious it was, but I think it should have been a marinated a little longer, or with more of the glaze. It didn't have as much of a pronounced flavor as I would have liked, and didn't penetrate the meat well. I will definitely try it again, but with all of the great grilled chicken recipies on this site, it might be a while before I get back to it again.

So simple and so delicious. The glaze makes the chicken incredibly flavourful. A great weeknight meal in summer when it's too hot to cook inside.

This is a simple marinade, but the honey seemed to burn too easily, which ruined the dish. I have made much simpler and tastier marinades and will not make this again.

Great marinade, I added something to it though, I doubled the recipe,used a tablespoon of garlic, and added a mild hotsauce made by Guavaberry in Saint Marteen (its really red pepper flakes in a sauce)just to give it kick. I let it sit overnight and it came out excellent.

This was easy and tasty...next time I would definitely top the chicken with more sauce, even if it meant that I couldn't use the glaze as often. The onions really are good. The chicken is very moist, and if you use a good coating of sauce it's very flavorful too.

I followed this recipe until I realized that it wasn't going to give me much flavor and then tweaked the ingredients accordingly. What I ended up cooking was nothing like the recipe but delicious all the same. I won't use this recipe again.

What a waste of time. We marinated the chicken for 8 hours and it was fairly juicy, but as bland as if we hadn't marinated it at all. I would not make this again.

These burned on the grill due to the honey. Despite the burning, they were just ho hum. I have some just-as-simple recipes that taste much better.

This was absolutely the moistest grilled chicken I've ever eaten!! For the best flavor you really need to save some of the marinade as indicated and glaze the chicken whlle it cooks, and pour any remaining sauce over the chicken once its on the platter. The chicken breasts I bought were pretty good sized and I only grilled 5 min. each side. I doubled all marinade ingredients for 6 large breasts. Really excellent and, best of all, very simple! I plan to make it all summer.

I wasn't very impressed with this recipe.perharps i didn't let the chicken marinate long enough.I thought it lacked flavor.I think I will try this again but let it marinate overnight...1-4hours just wasn't long enough to flavor it properly.

I made this because I wanted something simple and fast, but it was surprisingly delicious. I used it on chicken legs with the skin cut off and meat pierced with a fork to let the marinade penetrate--mine marinated for about 12 hours, and the chicken was juicy and had a lovely lemony flavor. The glaze reduced well, and I served some on the side as a sauce. The only changes I made were to use green onions instead of yellow (personal preference) and to add a tablespoon of chile sauce to the marinade, not to make it spicy so much as to round out the flavors. Overall, one of the best, and yet simplest, marinades for chicken.

It was very good -- I did mine in the oven like some of the others, but I am sure it would taste even better on the grill. I was concerned at first about there being too much lemon, but after a night in the fridge it mellowed a bit. I used it for sandwiches the next day and it was terrific. It's a keeper.

I have made this twice, even catering a party with it. Both times, rave reviews. I have used lemon and lime alternately, with equal results. I used boneless chicken thighs, putting them on soaked wooden skewers for ease of grilling, and really liked the flavor, and appreciated the economy, too.

Wonderful! I grilled it with vidalia onions and red peppers, the vidalias went wonderfully with it. Be sure to put a lot of pepper on the breasts before grilling, the flavor subsides a bit when grilled.

I doubled the recipe for the sauce and marinated with half of it then cooked the other half on top of the stove. After I tasted the stove top creation I thought it tasted like poison. When I tried it with the chicken however I along with my guests thought it was a delicious pair, just right for the chicken! I served mine with orzo pilaf, & corn on the cob.

Yummy!! I threw this together at the last minute and consequently was unable to marinate the chicken for the recommended time. However, the chicken was moist, tender and delicious. The flavors really blend nicely. My husband and kids gobbled it up. In fact, I was astounded at how much chicken my two year old (who can be picky at times) ate. This definitely commands a repeat performance, perhaps even for dinner guests.

It was ok but I wouldn't go out of my way to make it again. The marinade did keep the meat moist, and making even 3x the glaze seems like a good idea if your chicken breasts are large, as mine were.

In reading the previous reviewer, Lisa, I want to remind everyone NOT use the marinade at the table. The recipe says to make the onion mixture (onion, lemon juice, vegetable oil, honey and soy sauce) and use half as a marinade for the chicken. It should be discarded. The recipe states to boil the second half of the onion mixture making it a glaze for the cooked chicken. The second half has not been used with raw chicken; it is not the marinade. Additionally, I wonder why the authors of this recipe thought it was OK to leave the raw chicken out at room temperature for an hour to marinate?

I made this dish tonight, and as we were eating, we both thought, just so-so. Then my husband said, is there any marinade left to put over the chicken? There was, and this made all the difference. The onions had been soaking up the marinade for a few hours, so they really had a lot of flavor. Maybe I missed something somewhere, but this was not mentioned in the recipe, so I thought I'd share the idea. It really punched up the flavor. I think I will double the marinade next time just so there will be enough marinated onions to pass at the table. Also, I did cut back a little on the lemon and added a little more soy sauce. All in all, I'm looking forward to making it again.

This recipe easily moves to four forks with the addition of 1 tablespoon of hot chili sesame oil and increasing the soy sauce to 2 tablespoons. The smell of the chicken on the grill is absolutely riveting... you can just get happy by standing nearby and sniffing... and the promise is carried through in the flavor. The steamed asparagus and rice-orzo pilaf we served with it were perfect. The pilaf is made this way: In a 10" skillet, melt 2 talbespoons of butter over medium heat. Saute 1 cup long-grain rice, 1/3 cup orzo, and 4 oz. sliced tiny mushrooms until grains are brown. Add 2 1/2 cups chicken broth, and cook, covered, over low heat until liquid is absorbed. Stir occasionally. Remove from heat and let steam about 20 minutes. This was a fabulous dinner!

although I have not made this recipe, my husband has been grilling chicken breasts like this for years. He does use olive oil instead of vegetable oil, adds a little bit of seseme seed oil, and adds some yogurt and ginger. It's delicious! Oh, he also uses less lemon juice.
