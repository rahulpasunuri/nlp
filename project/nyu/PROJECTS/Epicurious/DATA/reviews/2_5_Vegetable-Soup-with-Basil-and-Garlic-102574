This recipe had a 1-fork rating, so I compared its ingredients/techniques to other vegetable soup recipes on epi-c. Something didn't add up. I decided to try this recipe despite the low rating. Wow! Am I glad I did! Made as suggested, the soup presents itself beautifully with lovely colors of orange and yellow (I used yellow zucchini) and green. The garni adds depth of flavor. I added 1.5 tsps salt and a couple grindings of pepper to taste. The pistou is absolutely fantastic. With each spoonful of the soup, you smell a hint of basil, tomato and garlic. The only wish on my list is that I had fresh white beans instead of canned. This is such a fresh-tasting soup, the canned beans, while not distasteful, tasted....canned.... I placed a tomato on tin foil on a radiant-heat burner, prepped the veggies while it got hot, then dropped it in cold water. The skin peeled right off. I used a couple cans of chicken broth with the water to hedge my bet against the 1-fork reviewer. The alteration tasted good. Yummy, wholesome, delicious soup. What more could a soup-eater want? This soup is a keeper and one I will make again and again.

This soup needed alot of work to make it eatible. The pistou leaves the soup with a very dishwatery appearence on top. Only a proffesional cook could make this soup in the 1 1/4 hours. The servings are more like 20 not 4-6, just look at the amount of water used (2 1/2 quart = 10 cups.)
