rice cooker are okay to have, but I find them for the not so sure, if you know rice it's easy to cook in a regular pan on the stove-top,and it taste better.

You should NEVER reheat rice more than once in the interests of food safety.

I made this recipe last night using brown rice. It needed the full 40 minutes, and it turned out perfectly. I've never used a rice cooker, never needed one. A good pan and good technique are all that's necessary. I make jasmine rice at least several times a week and it's better than the rice we used to get with our Asian take out. This recipe makes quite a lot of rice, but it's easy to store in the fridge or freezer for later.

Personally, I won't buy a rice cooker. I invest in pans for a reason! This recipe is more than simple. I used this recipe as a base for the fried rice and my husband went crazy over it. The finished product was evidently exactly like what he ate in Okinawa, Japan when he was a Marine. We will be making this often.

I tried this recipe and found it works perfect. Rice can be hard to get right when you're in a hurry and making the main course at the same time. It's really full proof. I like the old school method. No, I don't have room for a rice maker in my kitchen either. :-)

I haven't tried this method, but it's very close to how I make rice. I grew up in a Chinese household with a rice cooker, and it (the cooker) fared just fine. I still have a rice cooker, but for the past several years have been cooking it in a pot on both gas and electric stoves. Surprisingly, I've found that it takes a shorter amount of time, and is more consistent. The trick is to simmer it covered on the lowest heat after it boils. If you do it right, it doesn't stick to the bottom of the pot at all (no more scraping!). You don't need to spread it out in another flat pan to cool. Just use what you need, leave uncovered to cool, then put in a bag or tupperware. Rice also freezes well. Voila!

I agree with the cook from Mexico. This recipe is not exactly rocket science, and I simply don't have room for another appliance for occasional use.

This is perfect for making fried rice. And to all the critics..I have a toaster oven, microwave, coffee grinder, knife sharpener, two blenders, a Kitchen Aid mixer, food processor and hand blender on my counter top. Where would I put even one more appliance for occasional use like a rice cooker? Jeez

Makes sense to me. If you want to do it the old-fashioned way, here it is. I'm glad to see it. Personally, I use a rice cooker. As an aside, I find the water bath style cooker to be vastly superior to the other kind which are hardly "foolproof."

It MAY be easier to use a rice maker, but there are some people who like to take the time and effort of making the authentic product...in some cases, a teaching lesson. This is what this recipe accomplished.

I think it would be easier to just get in the car drive to the nearest Walmart and get that rice cooker rather then messing with this one.

WELL, I DO!! Just about every Chinese restaurant has an electric rice cooker. And all of my Chinese friends do, also. When I asked one why, she smiled sheepishly & said it was because it was the most consistant. :)

WELL, I DON'T AGREE. Are all you people so millenium-gadget dependent that you can't deal with a simple cooking procedure to make perfect rice "the old-fashioned way." I hear there is a new gadget that makes perfect boiled water. It'll be a grand success. Personally, I don't need a gadget to boil rice. It's easy!

Oh, come on. We don't all have rice cookers and I've found this to be a foolproof way of achieving fluffy, perfectly cooked rice.

I AGREE JUST BUY A RICE COOKER.

This is silly. Buy a cheap rice cooker and be done with it. Perfect rice everytime.
