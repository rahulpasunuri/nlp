Delicious. . . This was a big hit at my party. I cut the sausages into rounds and served it as an appetizer with toothpicks. I prepared the recipe just as written. I did not reduce the amount of sauce, but I did need to add another teaspoon of cornstarch in 2 tsp of water to make the sauce thicker.

This was way too sweet for me. I think the sugar should be cut in half. I didn't have clove so I use 1/2 teaspoon of coriander and 1/2 teaspoon of cardamom. I was however able to ignore the sweetness and focus on the general deliciousness of this recipe. Next time Ill cut the sugar and enjoy it even more! Its really good, make it! Yummi

An easy and delicious dish, though the figs do take some time to prepare. Well worth it though, and it leaves the house smelling like the holidays. The fig sauce could easily be used with other meats as well, and perhaps even as a topping for pancakes or waffles. Overall, a thumbs up!

good stuff. salvaged some salsiccia that had sadly been overcooked. halved the recipe based on previous reviews. one thing i found was that the sauce was very thick and viscous and needed to be heated just before applying, otherwise it was far too sticky and gooey.

Strange and delicious... I served these "hot dog" style as a main course, and I made the following alterations to the recipe with great success: 1) Sliced figs in quarters to better fit into the bun 2) Added 1/4 teaspoon red chili flakes to vinegar sauce to spice it up... as is, the recipe is too sweet for my taste. My guests raved- this is so unexpected and original, i definitely recommend trying it!

Very unique and impressive looking. The occasions in my life would be rare to merit this dish. Had a tapas party last night with great reviews.

Forgot to mention. Followed the suggestions of others and halved the sauce. It was more than enough for the sausages. Good call.

Oh yummy!! Although the reduction took a while I didn't need to babysit it. What an easy recipe (with a little planning ahead) and what outstanding results.

Excellent!! Just made this for a Spanish tapas party and it was fantastic. I too had way too much sauce (probably only need half as much). But it was soooo good.

Impressive! I also had twice as much sauce as I needed. Use the sauce sparingly, you don't want the sweetness to overpower the savory sausage. Balance of flavors is the key to this dish.

This was amazing. Do not hesitate to try it! Unquestionable hit at the Tapas party I served it at. While the sauce makes the dish there seemed to be too much of it when I doubled the recipe. Will certainly make this again and again.

Why hasn't anyone tried this yet?? It is amazing! I saw it in Bon Appetit and tried it at Dali and loved it. Then I made it at home and loved it even more. I'm trying to think of other ways to use this sauce...I'm thinking seared foie gras!
