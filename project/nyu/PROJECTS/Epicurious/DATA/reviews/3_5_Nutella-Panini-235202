This is a recipe? I love Nutella, but spreading it on white bread and slapping it into a panini press doesn't constitute calling it a recipe.

use croissants-nutella and a bit of peanut butter...fantastic!

One of Food Network' recipes called for using pound cake in place of bread. It was topped with Nutella and sliced strawberries and the placed in the panini press. A great dessert.

I grew up with Nutella and I have eaten it in many forms, so I was not terrible convinced that this was going to make a difference in a panini machine, I was so wrong! This was wonderful, used sourdough bread and will try the suggestion of sliced strawberries with it

I just want to add that if you add a bit of peanut butter to it it tastes amazing!!

Nothing beats a nutella sandwich with sliced bananas. Must use a good bread.

My family loves Nutella -- a hazelnut spread with cocoa. This is a very simple snack for kids in the afternoon and it tastes wonderful!! Panini is great, but so is a slighty toasted french baguette.

I saw Giada de Laurentis make this on food network and I made it and LOVED it. But do not use Soggy old off the shelf white bread, opt for a crusty rustic whte or challah (sometimes challah falls apart when pressing because of its delicate crumb but it stil tastes YUMMY.
