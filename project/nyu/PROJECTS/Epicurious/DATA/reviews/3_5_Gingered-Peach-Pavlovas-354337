Great end of the summer recipe! I used white peaches, blueberries and raspberries and it was a colorful, tasty treat. Took the easy route and used "whipped cream" from the spray can (not as sweet and one less step).

This was pretty delicious. The peaches had just the right amount of ginger. I thought the dessert on the whole was too sweet. Maybe I would leave the sugar out of the whipping cream next time. But there will definitely be a next time.

Absolutely amazing! My guests could not stop talking about it. The flavor and texture balance came together really well. With local peaches in their prime in August, it could not have been timed better for my dinner party this month.

Outstanding, light summer dessert. Let the meringue cool completely and you will have no problems, only compliments.

We made this for our dinner club - but strained out the ginger before poaching the peaches, which is key - and got compliments. The combo of sweet cream, tartness and crunch of the meringue is great. We were meringue novices, though, and made them on a humid day without leaving them in the oven long enough to dry out a bit. So the centers stuck to the parchment paper. Too bad, because the chewy centers are the best part. Our friend advised us to take them off the paper right away and put them onto a cooling rack.

I made this as directed and had no problem with stickiness, however after turning off the oven I left the meringues in it to cool off for almost an hour, as is usually done when baking them. They turned out very nicely & were delicious. I would suggest that the amount of ginger be reduced,though,as some of the fresh peach flavor was lost.

I think there must be either a problem with the ingredients or oven temperature for this recipe. I have made lots of different pavlova recipes with success but this one did not crisp up and was very sticky on the outside and bottom.
