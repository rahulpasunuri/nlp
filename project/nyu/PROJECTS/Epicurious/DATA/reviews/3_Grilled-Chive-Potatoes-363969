We loved these. My potatoes were on the small side so I didn't split them. I also didn't over smash. The butter sauce was divine.

The recipe is ambiguous by stating "6 red- skinned potatoes". Red-skinned potatoes come in many sizes. It would be helpful if a weight measurement was added so that the intended ratio of potato to sauce is maintained.

I thought these were easy, tasty, and a bit different from run-of-the-mill potatoes. Also easy to prep ahead and grill at the last minute. Will definitely do again.

GREAT flavor!! 1 medium potato per person is plenty. I overcooked the potatoes so we did not 'press' them. The chive butter is fabo with them.

Be careful when trying to flatten potatoes with a fork after boiling. Two of the six I boiled completely fell apart after pressing "gently" with a fork. They were not able to be grilled.

A very nice side dish. I boiled my potatoes a little longer and grilled them in a grill rather than in the oven. They came out excellently, a very nice flavour. Served them with a sour cream and chives bake and beer battered fish.

My family thought these were the best potatoes ever. Delicious. Yes to the lemon. Yes to the chives. Yes to the grill marks.

I say cut the chives by one third and use fresh rosemary for the other third. This is a real winner and your family will absolutely love it! Remember to apply the rosemary before grilling and only slightly overcook the potatoes for a SLIGHTLY crunchy edge.

Careful when griddling/barbequeuing potatoes - you mustn't burn them as potato is pretty disgusting burnt (too much starch). Black griddle-pan lines on a potato like in the picture may look pretty but they sure don't taste nice. Far simpler to finish them off in a medium/hot oven, maybe crush them a little to get some crunchy bits...

We really loved this recipe. What a change from "same-old" potatos. We thought the lemon and chives really added a great flavor.

The lemon peel was not a good addition to this recipe. Perhaps rosemary would have been better.
