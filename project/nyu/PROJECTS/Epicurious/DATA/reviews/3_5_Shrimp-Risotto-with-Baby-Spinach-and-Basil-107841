I had shrimp and baby spinach on hand and was looking for a recipe that used them both. This met my needs perfectly. I make a lot of risotto, so I have the cooking method down. I followed the recipe pretty closely with two changes: I added chopped mushrooms with the onion and skipped the basil because I didn't have any. The shrimp were cooked perfectly using the method supplied in the recipe. As others have mentioned, a squeeze of fresh lemon juice at the end added just the right bright note.

A good recipe made great by the wisdom of the Epicurious community. I took the advice of other reviewers and substituted pecorino romano for the parm; I sauteed the shrimp in olive oil and garlic at the last minute instead of poaching them; I threw in a wee pinch of red pepper flakes for a little kick; and I finished the dish with a squeeze of lemon, which gave it the brightness it needed. Will make it again often.

I cook the shrimp in 4 cups of water not chicken broth. Then I strain the "shrimp" water to use in the risotto. Follow the directions up until where you start to add the broth, just put all the liquid in the pressure cooker . Once it reaches pressure it only cooks for 5 minutes, the 4 cups of shrimp liquid is enough. Release pressure, stir in the shrimp, baby spinach and cheese. It is perfect and there is never any left over!

This was fabulous! Made some adjustments to accommodate personal preferences: sauted the shrimp with the onion and removed before adding wine. Used 6 cloves of garlic and supplemented the Parmesan with a Spanish sheep's milk cheese. My 10 year old raved about it.

This recipe was good. I only made one change, which was to add sliced baby bella's to the onion/garlic mix. It was a decent risotto, but not amazing. While I loved the texture of the baby spinach, I felt a little bored eating it (which is not something you want to say after you've spent an active 30 minutes stirring the broth into the rice!) I squirted some lemon juice into the leftovers and hope that will add a little brightness to the flavor. I won't give up on this recipe, but I'll definitely follow other reviewers recommendations before I make it again.

I love this as a basic risotto recipe. Usually I adapt it to be vegetarian, using heated vegetable broth and not bothering with shrimp, but adding portobello pieces sauteed with garlic to get a little of that deeper flavour you'd get with meat. It's easy to impress people with risotto and this one is great - just make sure to taste it often to check that your rice is finishing properly.

My husband loves risotto. This recipe is superb. It was easy to prepare (I was a bit nervous, I have not had success in the past). I sautéed the shrimp with 2 chopped garlic cloves in unsalted butter and used regular chicken broth.

Great recipe. Made in pressure cooker (8 min processing) so it was really quick. Topped with sauteed scallops. I agree that a little lemon or zest is a good addition. Does need significant salt & pepper for us.

WOW!!! This is exactly what I was looking for. Flavorful, yummmo! I didn't have 6 cups of chicken broth. Used 5 cups and it turned out fine. Also, I had precooked shrimp on hand. So I thawed them a little then put them in the hot broth for just about a minute to get them warm, then took them out like the recipe suggests. That was the only change I made. I would qualify my basil choice though. I have both broad leaf and italian so i mixed them together. What a fabulous flavor. Make this. You won't be sorry.

Rating: 4
Fabulous! We make this recipe constantly at home. You can follow it to the letter or make some little changes. One that we like is to add another 1/2 c onion (white onion) and add another 1/4 freshly grated romano cheese (the romano really wakes up the flavor). We also abandon the shrimp on occassion and have it plain or use some seared sausages (like Hans Italian or Red Pepper and Garlic). However, you do it, I highly recommend the addition of the romano though.

Made quinoa with chicken broth and then used saffron, shrimp & scallops (frozen). Really yummy! Didn't have parmesan but used lots of fresh basil and a lime instead of lemon - totally improvising based on what was in my fridge. Delicious! Would definitely make again.

AMAZING! I made this Saturday night and my husband could not stop telling me how amazing it was. I did make some changes - I used 1 c wine and added saffron as one reviewer suggested. I used barley instead of arborio rice which gave it a wonderful texture. Sauteed the shrimp in onion, garlic and olive oil, fresh lemon juice and zest, sea salt which gave the shrimp amazing flavor. Highly recommend it and will be making this again. Suitable for a dinner party in my opinion.

We made this exactly as written and thought it was great (not bland). Definitely recommended!

This was really good but I made several changes... First, I did not boil the shrimp in the broth. I sauteed the shrimp with garlic in 2 T's butter and sprinkled with lemon juice, then set aside. Added more wine ~ 3/4 c chardonnay. Used less spinach, approx half of recipe amount. Added mushrooms during last 10 mins and 2 chopped roma tomatoes. Opted to add fresh italian parsley instead of basil. I always keep a bag of frozen, uncooked shrimp on hand and it was perfect for this dish.

Rating: 4
Thought this dish was amazing! I don't agree with the bland comments at all. However, I did take a few measures to prevent it. I used organic chicken broth (not necessarily low salt), and I left a sacrificial shrimp simmering in the broth almost the entire time. I also used super-fresh, pungent parmesan. In fact, next time I may cut back on the parm a little next time. But maybe not, since after reheating the next night, I added fresh tomato to the top and that cut the richness down to perfection. This goes on my "good for dinner company" list.

Hmm - not sure what I did differently than everyone else, but I thought that this was REALLY bland. I ramped it up a bit by adding more basil and cheese and some lemon zest, and sauteed the shrimp scampi style per other suggestions, and it's not awful. But I would not make it again.

A great risotto and easy to make. I used a nice Riesling for the wine. Delicious!

This definitely would have been bland, however I read and took all readers comments into consideration and ended with a perfect, delicious dish! Used lemon zest sprinkled in at end and on top for presentation (really makes the dish); put the shells in the broth to boil for shrimp taste in broth, used 1 cup of wine, sauteed shrimp in butter and garlic and set aside rather than boiled (this seemed like a no brainer- NEVER boil in a dish like this), then I cup up the shrimp in large chunks with two whole ones on each bowl for presentation. PERFECT! The only thing about the basil, I honestly didn't taste it at all but made it pretty!

I've found that simply cooking the shrimp by boiling them in the chicken broth does not give them good flavor. i have developed a recipe that gives the shrimp more oomph by sauteing them in a shrimp scampi kind of style - check it out on my blog: http://foodtosavor.blogspot.com

We thought this was a great recipe. I suffused a little saffron in the wine for a while before I ued it in the recipe and I added some crimini mushrooms in the last half of cooking the risotto. My guys (husband and 12 yr old son say this recipe goes into the mix, for sure.

The first time I made this recipe, my boyfriend couldn't stop high-fiving me and we both licked our plates clean. I made it for his mother, she loved it. My mother loved it, said it was restaurant quallity. It's a great meal, and you can make enough to feed an army. One thing I find is that in a pinch for both time and money, de-veined, shelled, cooked cocktail shrimp will do if left to cook into enough broth to get rid of the super shrimpy flavor. I find for some reason that frozen works better than refrigerated fresh shrimp from the deli case.

Rating: 4
This is an excellent dish. A few tweaks as previously mentioned heighten the flavor (a bit more wine, basil, and garlic), but most important, put those shrimp shells to good use and simmer them in the stock with some onion and garlic. Strain before adding to risotto. Delicious combination of flavors.

Saute the shrimp in the onions; season the shrimp with lemon pepper to give it a little zing. Added about 1/2 cup heavy cream at the end. Use a Le Creuset pot.

Rating: 4
This is what I'd call a restaurant quality dish. Like the previous raters, I made a few adjustments to the recipe, but most of those were due to the fact that we were leaving our summer place and I either needed to use up available ingredients or not buy additional things. I think the most beneficial change I made was to saute the shrimp in the onions (I used a mixture of green onions and a purple onion) and garlic. I seasoned the shrimp with lemon pepper to give it a little zing. This change gave the shrimp an unbelieveable flavor that made it central to the dish. After I sauted it, I removed it from the pan as directed in the recipe. I also added mushrooms; did not add basil because I did not have it on hand; added about 1/2 cup heavy cream at the end, and used 1 cup wine rather than 1/2 cup. We almost licked our plates and have already planned our next dinner around this wonderful recipe! Make this at your first opportunity!

Rating: 3
We really liked this, but tweaked it a bit. Made a richer broth, as others suggested, from the shells, plus celery, onion, bay leaf, and lemon and then added the shrimp to that. Doubled the wine, garlic and basil. Used a Le Creuset pot, and the risotto was definitely done in the alloted time. It was creamy, hot, and delicious. Thanks to all for the good suggestions.

Tweaked the recipe to "Frenchify" this Italian classic by substituting the onions and oil with shallots and butter. Added a lot of fresh cracked pepper and found the result to be decadent.

I was looking for bland, and found it here. My family, who complains about my over use of spices and big flavors, loved this. I did add the juice and zest of 1 lemon.

I will definitely make this again, but not without the roasted peppers!

Great recipe, though a little time consuming. I agree with the cook from Laurel, MD with a more seafood flavor though I used 3 cups chicken broth and 3 cups shrimp boullion. It was a big hit along the asparagus with gremalata butter.

Delicious comfort food. Not spicy, but I didn't find it bland either. I added a sprinkle of crushed red pepper flakes while sauteeing the onion. Also boiled the shrimp shells for a few minutes with the chicken broth and replaced some of the broth with clam juice. There was plenty of seafood flavor.

As proposed, I can see why this recipe could be bland. HOWEVER, with a little tweaking, this recipe can blow the doors off the house. I followed the other recs and went with the shrimp stock. Fearing that it might be too bland, I also added clam juice -- wow did that do the trick (1 part shrimp stock:1 part clam juice:1 part chicken stock).

I'm not sure how you could find this recipe bland. It was absolutely delicious. A wonderful first course for the Crazy for Italian feast found under the Menu section, which we made for a dinner party, or good enough to stand on its own on a casual weeknight.

This is labor intensive but makes a very nice weeknight dinner. I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and used a full cup of wine and extra cheese.

Make cracked pepper corns available for those who like them - definitely a good addition on top.

made this last night pretty much exact except with veggie stock instead of chicken... i added some lemon zest in with the spinach at the end (used regular, not baby) and squeezed the juice of the lemon on the shrimp before putting them back in the risotto...added a bit more garlic and still found this recipe missing a bit...i did enjoy it but i didn't really taste the basil (use more), and if you use store bought stock, cut down the parmy, as it gets pretty salty...so i agree with the cook that said there are better risottos out there...i also think using fish stock would be a great idea...all in all, not bad...but i'm a bit biased--i love risotto

I made this using some shrimp stock I had on hand (I save the shells whenever I don't cook shrimp w/the shells on and save them in the freezer till I have enough for a batch of stock). Added a bit more garlic and basil than called for, and the results were excellent...a very tasty dish. Update: I made this basic dish again the following night as part of my culinary class practical exam (omitting the shrimp and adding more Parmesan), along with the Chicken Marsala w/Sage, also on this site. This time, I used the veal stock we had on hand. My chef-instructor LOVED it so much, he said he was going to add it to the menu at his restaurant.

I made this for Memorial Day dinner guests, and it was a hit. My 9-year-old had many helpings and took the rest in a thermos for lunch today. I had sorrel in garden so I added that at last minute and didn't cook long, so it wouldn't dissolve. That may have made the dish a little more flavorful than some reviewers found with spinach. I also finished off the rest of my parmesan block--which was more than 1/2 cup, I think--and more cheese was nice, too. We liked this a lot.

This is something special if each of your ingredients is super fresh--the flavors remain distinct and complement each other very well.

Went well with a mixed green salad, french bread and a good Chardonnay. Will fix for friends next time.

Really delicious. I made half the recipe for two using a little extra shrimp and agree the serving sizes are small. Also agree, too long to cook the shrimp and for the cook who had gummy rice, did you use the medium-grain instead of arborio? If so, it might be the reason it was gummy.

Definte company-worth dish. Tastes fabulous and looks impressive! Next time, I think I will take others advice and cook the shrimp 1 or 2 minutes. It was a little chewy at 3. (Also reheats well if you microwave the risotto and then stir in some warm chicken broth before serving.)

ATTN: A COOK FROM NEW YORK - as for your risotto being gummy, theres a little trick my nona taught me, and is the opposite of this recipe, add the white wine at the end! Right when the rice is cooked and thick, add good white wine then (I use a good chardonnay) stir on a high heat for about a minute or two and you may smell the wine cooking and it almost smells like vinegar, that should pass in those two minutes and serve immediately. Good luck! I thought this recipe was fantastic and most risottos are bland - add a mixture of mushrooms to this with a bite to them! Delightful with warm crusty bread and a salad on the side!

Awesome dish and beautiful for the spring and summer. The dish is better if you put the uncooked, peeled and deveined shrimp in the risotto and cook them during the last 4 - 5 minutes. Cream is a nice finishing touch.

Good. All you folks should also check out the 'Couscous Risotto with Shrimp, Asparagus and Peas' on this website to compare. Can't decide which is better. The 'Couscous Risotto' uses Israeli couscous (pearl pasta) that's really good.

I was served this at a dinner party and was really impressed. Found the recipe on Epicurious and have made it again and again. With good shrimp it is perfect-- an elegant, unique balance of flavors with the basil and the other ingredients. Of course it tastes a little fishy but that's because it's a seafood dish and the flavors of shrimp get infused into the rice. This has become a mainstay.

This is a wonderful dish, but it is only as good as the shrimp you use. Don't scrimp, buy top notch shrimp!! I will definitely make again, delicious as a main course.

Okay, I'm sure you have to be a seafood person to really like this and I'm not. My husband is, however, but he wouldn't want it again. I followed the directions exactly but added more cheese at the end. Just didn't blow me away at all. It's very fishy, but maybe I had icky shrimp or something. If I did make it again, I'd make sure I had super fresh shrimp.

Simple and fantastic. I substituted spinach with a mix of sauteed wild mushrooms. Served it with chicken breast sauteed with rosemary, juniper berries and marsala. The entire meal took me about 40 minutes to prepare from start to finish.

Wonderful as written!

I cut this in half as there were only two of us but still used all the wine and garlic, also used shallots in place of onion. It came out fantastic! This recipe has such a smooth, creamy texture but with lots of depth and it dances on your tongue. I am making this again this weekend for a dinner party and will be serving it as a first course. This will be a mainstay for me!

I've never made Risotto before but am certainly glad I tried it. Wow, this is too good for a first course, one just wants to eat more! I fixed it for my mom who is recovering from hip surgery and we both enjoyed it. I reduced the recipe somewhat as there were only two of us (still wanted to leave her some leftovers).About 11 oz. shrimp (large Key West Pinks); 1 cup onion; 1 cup rice; 4 cups broth, about 4 or 5 ounces of spinach, 1/3 cup of parm. Used the amounts of wine, garlic and basil originally called for. Given her small kitchen I was still able to make a couple of salads, slice and heat the Ciabata while minding the rice. And, it not only tastes wonderful it smells just as good while it's cooking! Try this stuff!!!! P.S. To the cook from Southfield who used cooked shrimp: you missed the chance of instilling the broth with the flavors of fresh shrimp! Try it with high quality, fresh shrimp and you may change your mind about this dish.

Simple to make, and simply fantastic. I made this dish as a first course, then serving the sausage and cheese stuffed manicotti as an entree. Risotto is really quite simple to make- and this recipe is outstanding. Creamy, rich in flavor, it was a winner for this small dinner party. Everyone hangs out in the kitchen anyways, so why not make a dish that requires 20 minutes of semi-constant attention? We all agreed that this dish seemed like one you'd pay big money for in a restaurant. It served 4 people nicely, for under $10!! Could be an entree also, with bread and salad. Try it, you'll be glad you did........

Cut recipe in half for the two of us except for the olive oil and wine. Used jumbo cooked shrimp sliced lengthwise. Husband loved it, I was disappointed, not up to my standards

This was so tasty. The shrimp are tender, not overcooked and the risotto is very flavorful and creamy. Love the taste of the basil and spinach. Don't scrimp on the basil!

This recipe was excellent. I didn't make any changes and it doesn't need any. Risotto always seemed so labor intensive, but this one was easy--of course I used already peeled and deveined shrimp. It looked as good as the picture, too.
