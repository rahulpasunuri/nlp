Wonderful, flavorful & easy. I also added thyme, lemon zest and the leftover flour to the sauce. The chicken was singing!

This was surprisingly delicious! It was too simple and not attractive enough to warrant four forks, but I thought the flavors were amazing and my kids liked it too.

Simple and easy with lots of flavor! I think next time I make it I will add another tablespoon of Creole seasoning! I served it with mashed potatoes and green beans!

I cut the chicken into strips and it was a very delicate taste and the meat was very tender. I paired it with a salad with balsalmic vinegrette and a dark wine. Was fantastic!!

I cut up the chicken into strips and it cooked very well in the olive oil maintaining its moisture. Added a slight bit of white wine to the sauce for tartness instead of lemon juice.

Chicken was excellent, the sauce a little too spunky.

This was a disappointment. The chicken itself was okay (and would be good on a sandwich), but the sauce was very tart. I like lemon, but the mixture of lemon juice and capers, a classic in its own right, didn't go well with the creole seasoning.

We really enjoyed this recipe, and I always love to find a new chicken recipe that is not just another variation of chicken/mushrooms/wine. I doubled the sauce recipe, and found it to be just enough. I also whisked two tablespoons of my leftover flour and spice mix into a little water and used it to thicken and season my sauce. Next time, I will double the cajun seasoning and paprika, as we like our food a little "kickier". I also am going to add rubbed thyme, as I feel that would give the recipe a little something it is missing. I also felt this came out a little too salty, so I will try rinsing my capers instead of just draining. I think the brine on the capers may have been the culprit.

Not company material, but good for a quick and easy week nite meal. I found it took alittle longer to cook the chicken than recipe said.

Everyone in my household LOVED this one! I did pound the chicken, doubled the spices in the flour, added a little zest, white wine, and garlic to the sauce. I also thickened it a bit with arrowroot so it would better cling to the noodles I served it with. The cajun/lemon combo is unreal!

My daughter loves lemon and capers, so this recipe is a favorite. We like extra sauce to spoon over orzo, so we use 1 can of low-salt chicken broth, 3 TB lemon juice and 4 TB capers. I leave the chicken in the pan when I add the sauce ingredients and simmer, covered, for about 10 minutes.

Very easy to make, but the seasoning wasn't great and the sauce had a very odd smell to it (the lemon flavor it added to the chicken was good, however). This is just a quick and simple dish, nothing to rave about. If you really like Cajun, I'd advise trying something blackened.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was a big hit. The gravy was amazing the chicken cooked up beautiful and light. I added a bit of cinnamon for some extra spice. everybody loved it. i made some fresh corn and green beans to go with it. i will absolutely make this again.

I enjoyed the chicken and pounded it out. I did not care for the sauce though.

We really liked this recipe. I used just 1T capers, pounded the chicken a bit, and added a little white wine. Served with noodles and sauteed peppers and mushrooms.

This was delicious and I will definitely be making this in the near future. I spiced it up a tad bit by adding a little (1/2 tspn) cayenne pepper and for once, the wife said she thought it didn't need the extra kick. Very flavorable, quick and easy to make. Didn't do the rice though, but would be a nice addition for those not on the low carb craze. I pounded the breast to the same thickness so that they would cook evenly. Try it, you'll like it!

Loved it. The chicken was gorgeous. Although I used big pieces of chicken, it really got to absorbed the cajun flavour deep into the center of the piece. Used steamed and roasted veggies on the side, but I guess seasoned rice would make it as well. Will cook it again!

I thought this one was great. I have already made it twice. I sliced the chicken breasts really thin. I didn't have capers in the house so I cut up some green olives (minus the pimentos). It came out really tasty and it was quite easy. I will be making this one again!

Great recipe, sooooo easy! Pounded the chicken flat, doubled the cajun seasonings and sauce ingredients as suggested. I had a pound of medium shrimp in the fridge which I cut up and added to the sauce just as it finished thickening. Served the chicken over homemade spinach pasta, topped with sauce,shrimp and minced parsley. Very Pretty and what a wonderful flavor!

Very easy to make, especially for novices. Has a nice flavor. Maybe need to add more spice than suggested, in order to give it more zing. Flattening chicken would certainly help the sautée process also.

I made this recipe for a SupperClub dinner with a Mardi Gras theme. They loved it and I passed along the recipe to all. The only thing I added was 1/4 c. white wine to bring up the browned bits, and then added the broth and lemon. I also topped with sliced lemons for better presentation.

Thank you for the suggestions. I doubled the spices, flattened the chix and cut the capers. My husband said it was a hit!

Made this for a Sunday night supper for two...loved the flavors! I swirled a couple of teaspoons of butter in the sauce before serving..added a lovely, rich flavor. Served with garlic butter rice. Slightly spicy flavor of the chicken was delightful with the lemony sauce.

I like the idea of this recipe but think the sauce definitely needs something? butter and/or white wine. We felt that 2T of capers were way too much. Next time I would pound the chicken breasts and then cut into thirds, add a little more cajun seasoning, make 3 times more sauce, and leave out 1T of the capers.

this was great....a bit hit with the family. i too added more cajun spice to the flour and added more broth and lemon juice to make more sauce....next time i will make even more.....it was a wonderful sauce!!! i took the advice as well to add lemon zest and a bit of butter to the sauce....fabulous with rice!! next time i will flatten the chicken some too. this is a keeper!!!

Delicious! I thought this dish was great! The lemon and the capers made it tangy, while the cajun seasonings gave it a spicy kick. next time I will double the chicken broth to make more sauce and it will be even better.

A definite keeper for the recipe file. Easy & fast for a tasty mid-week dinner. A real hit with my husband. Doubled the cajun seasoning as we both like it spicy. Pound the chicken a must to keep it quick.

I have made this recipe at least 20 times. It's both delicious and quick to prepare. Pounding the cutlets (as suggested by several people) tends to toughen them so I simply slice the cutlets in half, before cooking.

This is a very quick, simple and tasty dish. Next time I will pound the chicken breasts slightly. My boyfriend loved it!

This was good since I already had all the stuff in the house, and I'm sure I'd make it again since it barely requires a recipe. Lemon + capers + chicken broth is a standard but I'd never thought to add cajun seasoning into the mix. It tasted good and precluded the need to add salt to the chicken or the sauce. I would also usually use wine but it was okay without, since I didn't have any. I melted some butter in the oil before sauteeing and then added another little pat to the sauce. Also pounded the chicken breasts, which I highly recommend. It doesn't take much time and the chicken cooks faster and has a far better texture.

My husband raved over this dish! I did put a little more cajun seasoning than called for, since several had mentioned doing that. It turned out so delicious! And I'm sure I'll be making this again.

I took the advice of the other reviewers and added more cajun spice. But the dish came out too pungent and overwhelming so watch out in overdoing it. We didn't care much for the sauce also. The other chicken recipes in the same ranking category are much better.

An alright dish just kinda boring. If we made again I'd pound the chx & add more cajun seasoning & a little white wine.

This dish didn't meet my expectations, though I don't feel that the fault lies with the recipe alone. The next time I prepare this dish I will use much more spice and maybe blacken the chicken. The sauce was simple, delicious, and paired nicely with rice.

Next time I make this dinner, I would take the left over flour/spice mixture and combine it with a little more broth to give it a bit more of a "sauc-y" look - otherwise, very tasty dish.

Have made this quick dish 3 times and my 2 finicky boys eat it without the sauce. I add lemon zest to the sauce.
