it would be really excellent if people who write reviews actually used the recipe, i mean, i think 2 actually used the salami. this is a problem on epicurious, everyone is so anxious to say that their way is so creative, when, actually, people, your way is usually the way that the rest of us make things without even thinking...stay off unless you have something of value to add....ridic.

Just an "ok" here... I skipped salami and instead chopped, high quality sun-dried tomatoes. I also used more rosemary (fresh). This could be only my lack of expertise in bread making. I'm practicing, I promise, I am! I think I'll have a tomato sandwich with a bit of cheese with this bread today... or ooooo, a grilled cheese! Yum!

Skipped the salami and used black olives instead, as well as a butter glaze. Came out very good, excellent base recipe.

Loved this, though I used the recipe more as a base for my imagination than as a step-by-step list of instructions. I did make this into two loaves instead of one, which was good, because it would have made a huge single loaf. I used dried fine herbs and cheddar instead of rosemary and salami, and just brushed the top of the loaves with butter. My whole family, even the picky members loved this.

Took the advice of other reviewers and used copious amounts of fresh rosemary. I didn't include cheese or salami, but found the bread light and delicious with a salad. And i only made 1/2 the recipe to avoid the Lucy effect! Perfect amount for one manageable loaf.

I am particularly fond of this bread. I agree to adding more rosemary, have never used the salami, but I usually add either chopped fresh or roasted garlic in copious amounts. I've also taken to dividing the dough and making two long thin loaves rather than the one "Lucy Ricardo" loaf.

I have made this bread several times to raving reviews but with an important sustitution. Finely dice approximately 1/2 ounce of FRESH rosemary and use instead of the dry. Makes this bread a meal in itself!!

This bread is delicious and beautiful. I added about a cup of shredded mozzerella before the final rise, just folded it in twice so I got a nice spiral look, then I sliced the final dough round into three sections and made three loaves. I also used fresh rosemary, about 4 T. The recipe did fine with turkey salami.

Very yummy meatballs. Easy to make (especially with a food processor) and goes a long way. I mixed half ground beef and chorizo to give it a spicer taste and left out the currants (not wanting to make a trip to the specialty grocery store). And taking everyone else's advice, I used my own sauce. My family loved them.

This bread was OK- like other reviewers, I thought that it needed much more rosemary than called for. I also put in 1/2 lb of chopped provolone, but it seemed like the recipe could have taken more cheese..

This was the Loaf that Ate Dallas! Remember when Lucy Ricardo made the loaf of bread that was so huge it came surging out of her oven and pushed her down? I feared the same event here. This barely fit onto my large cookie sheet. Maybe I let it rise too long in the first rising (although it was less than the hour recommended in the recipe. Maybe I let it rise too long in the second rising (still less than the recipe calls for). I was diligent about the recipe in all ways except one: I added at least a cup of very finely cubed gruyere at the same time I added the salami and rosemary (finely chopped fresh, not dried). The resulting bread was OK, not great. My spousal unit did not like the coarse salt sprinkled on top, although it was a very very small amount. Recommendations to someone determined to make this recipe: 1) buy the absolute best salami you can afford...something that is wonderful on its own, 2) use fresh, not dried, rosemary...as much as you think you would like, 3) consider dividing the recipe into two loaves before baking, and 4)seriously consider finding another recipe. And if you do make this, just know that the resulting bread really is quite pretty. Just not worth making another time in this household.

Again and again we've enjoyed this bread. We have added provolone. It's a meal on it's own. ENJOY!!!

This was such a delicious bread-my husband and I relished it dipped in olive oil and pepper. I would suggest using more rosemary (I used a Tbs. of dried, and it still wasn't enough for me). Next time I will try fresh rosemary-about 3 TBS. I'm sure that will make all the difference. This would make a great light lunch with a salad.

I make bread every week and didn't think this bread was worth the effort. It wasn't bad -- just not particularly inspired.

Wow, great bread! I substituted the meat with walnuts (Yummie)and I was very liberal with the Rosemary quantity. The result was superb! I am baking it again today!

Very yummy. I used 3 cups of wheat flour for some of the bread. And I added 3 slices of provalone cheese chopped up. It probably could use more rosemary like NY said.

This bread is great! I personally like to add extra rosemary because the recipe doesn't call for very much.
