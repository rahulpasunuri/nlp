This dessert is addicting! I have made it with marble halvah and have used both vanilla or coffee ice cream and it is a nice combination. The crust is so tasty. One of my favorite recipes to make the night before for a party the next day.

{I'm not rating because haven't tried yet.} Here is my point: I always have thought this was spelled 'Halva' not 'Havla' like the recipe says!? I love Halva & can't wait to try this recipe!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'll leave a review when I do!

I made this recipe for a dinner party using halawa with pistachios, and it was INCREDIBLE!!! Everybody loved it; some asked for the recipe, and my 16 year old son wants this for his "birthday cake." I will definitely be making this again.

I have made this recipe about four times. It is a family favorite.I have used different flavors of ice cream, but the vanilla is the best as it is nuetral enough to allow the halvah flavors to come through. I found it easier to serve when I used parchment paper on the bottom of a springform pan.

If you like the taste of halvah this is fabulous. It makes a great presentation. But you have to also like ice cream, which I am not such a fan of, but still I enjoyed it. Very unique!!!
