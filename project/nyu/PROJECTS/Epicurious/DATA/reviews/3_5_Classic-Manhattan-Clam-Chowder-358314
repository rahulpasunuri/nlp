Since I don't eat Clam Chowder I can only write the review my husband gave. It was "good". Said it didn't have much flavor. Guess I'll have to work on it.

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for: something simple and "classic", and with ingredients that are easy to find in my country. (I did have to adjust some numbers/volumes here and there, but that's normal, right?) I also appreciate the history in the description: that it is not exactly "Manhattan" that invented this. I recommend this recipe to anyone who wants to try "Manhattan Clam Chowder" for the first time. Or, if you like tweaking, you can use this as a "benchmark" Manhattan Clam Chowder. I would suggest a little smaller pieces for the bacon and vegetables, because it is easier to eat. But, that is just my opinion. Ray Chang
