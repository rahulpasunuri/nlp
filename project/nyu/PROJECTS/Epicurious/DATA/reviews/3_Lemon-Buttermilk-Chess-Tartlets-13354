These were good, but I had to make some changes in the cooking time. The first batch I baked at 425F for 15 min and then turned it down like the recipie stated and that was just too much - and my oven doesn't run hot. The second batch I baked at 375F for about 15 or so minutes, and that was perfect. It's very important to use FRESH lemon juice - not store bought. I ran out of fresh lemon juice on one batch, and subbed bottled juice - they didn't even taste lemony! I also used the sweet tartlet shell recipie from this site - it's the BEST tart shell recipie I've found. Overall - great tartlets!

These tartlets are fresh and yummy. I would make the pate brisee with all butter rather than with crisco as well. These are perfectly lemony with a homestyle buttermilk chess flavor. Great for a spring-time soiree.
