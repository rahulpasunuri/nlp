Quick, easty, and got rave reviews from all involved. I also used a stick blender with no problems.

PS. I use a stick blender in the pan I make the soup in. What could be simpler?

The combination of taste plus ease of preparation makes this exceptional. Its a very flexible recipe. I have used different types of lettuce.(Including the hearts) No butter minimal cream half/half etc. I used whole can of chicken broth instead of 1 C + water. Probably either is OK as is dried or fresh dill

This was great! It was especially nice to use the outer leaves of a head of romaine, and have the heart to use for something in the same meal, like a caesar salad or in sandwiches. Also, I quite liked the little bits of lettuce that didn't get completely pureed -- it makes for a more interesting texture. I served it cold with a small dollop of creme fraiche. Tasty!

I adored this soup. Delicious hot or cold. My only quibble is that there were fiber-y bits that didn't get completely pureed. Nevertheless a terrific soup!
