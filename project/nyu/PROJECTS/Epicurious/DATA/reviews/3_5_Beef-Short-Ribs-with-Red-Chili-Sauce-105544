(See below.) How funny that someone from Alaska is using this space to advertise their product. How pathetic.

Not bad, but the ribs lacked a "depth" of flavor I expected to have. I guess it may have to do with the parboiling, even though the water was flavored. Next time I make these, I'll season the ribs with my Executive Chef Prime Rib and Roast Seasoning (a seasoning mix made in Alaska...call 1-907-457-6850), let it sit for a few hours, then boil. The sauce was good though, although the whole recipe was a lot of work for something lacking a deep flavor, like you would expect from a prime rib or filet mignon. I'll make again with alterations!

I thought these had no tast at all, and were extremely time consuming. They definitely need more flavor, and there are far better recipes around, that take much less time

Beware of chiles! Following the advice of another reviewer, I weighed my chiles instead of counting them and ended up with just over 4 ounces total (pre-seeding and stemming). I followed the rest of the recipe to the letter and when all was said and done, the dish was inedible due to how spicy/bitter it came out (and I like spicy food). I have to assume that just like fresh chiles, some dried ones are stronger than others. If you find yourself having used overly potent chiles, we rescued it by adding ~2t brown sugar, ~2T tomato paste and then the key ingredient-about 1/2 cup of heavy cream. The sauce is now spicy, but no longer bitter and the cream not only tones down the heat but added a smoothness to the dish. I don't think we changed the character of the recipe and dinner was saved.

I LOVED IT, IT WAS A LITTLE TIME CONSUMING BUT COOKING CAN BE FUN.

I have made this recipe more than once, and my friends have loved it. I would recommend when making this recipe that you follow the "ounces" of the peppers, as the peppers can vary in size considerably and you may end up with too many or too little.

This is definitely a higher-maintenance meal, but the sauce is worth it. Overall, however, the beef ribs were a disappointment because they were very fatty. If I make this again, I would definitely use different ribs (pork perhaps?) so that they have more meat and less fat.

This is a great recipe. The meat was very tender. I made dish twice, the second time I made some changes. The vinegar was over- powering so I omitted it and added 1 tbs. of fresh lime juice. The sauce was bland so I added brown sugar along with the salt and pepper. The brown sugar helped balance out the salt. Make sure to trim off the fat. I simmered it for an extra hour. It makes a big difference. It helped the flavors come together. This dish was time consuming but well worth the time. I plan to make it again soon.
