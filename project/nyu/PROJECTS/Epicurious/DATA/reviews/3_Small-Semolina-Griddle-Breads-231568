I always feel cheated when a recipe is supposed to be really quick but it takes a long time to cook the entire quantity. Sure, it's only a few minutes for each flatbread, but unless you have a few large grillpans this will take a while. I've never had the real thing on a street in Tunis, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I also couldn't get coarse semolina; I tried both the website listed above and 3 speciality shops. I really wanted to try the recipe though (Paula Wolfert, stop reading here!) so I figured that couscous is semolina and, well, it seems pretty coarse to me. I ended up with tasty, dense and heavy little pancakes. The texture was soft and chewy, which I liked but I don't know if that is what they are supposed to be like. They're greasy because they're cooked in a lot of butter. On the whole, I liked them and ate them, but I didn't impress my dinner guests with them.

These were really delicious with the Herb Jam with Lemon and Olives, but they were really delicious on their own, too! An easy alternative to boring old biscuits.
