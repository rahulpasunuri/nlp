I followed others suggestions and added garlic, onion, and a handful of currants. With these additions the recipe is still very easy but with a fuller flavor.

I made this for a group of 25 (tripled the recipe) and it was all eaten! I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used goat meat (99 cents a pound from my local arab butcher). So yummy!!

Wow!!! Delicious!! Made this today for the first time, and certainly won't be the last. Have a feeling it may become a "go to" recipe. Did as others suggested and started with some sauteed onion/shallot in the beginning, but other than that, followed the recipe as posted. Really really good.

Definitely a keeper; I've made this dish at least half a dozen times and it is amazing!! A cup of chicken broth added after the wine reduces (about 5 minutes) adds a nice flavor.

Fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly, using the salt-cured black olives. Delicious! My husband, who claims to not like lamb or olives had three helpings.

This was an excellent recipe that was easy and very tasty. Simplicity at it's best! I did alter the recipe a little after reading the other reviews. I added 2 large shallots. I added a little more tomato paste and subbed beef broth for the water. It turned out delish and it was so easy to make. My husband raved about how lovely the stew was. I highly recommend this dish to all.

I have made this recipe three times now and we love it. I added shallots, red onion and fresh instead of dried rosemary. I rounded out the menu with Polenta Gratin and Green Bean/Cherry Tomato Salad (Bon Appetit May 2002). I always keep a Leg of Lamb cut up in the freezer now and make this as a mid week treat. Easy and flavorful!

I followed the recipe (no onions, shallots or oregano? as the other reviewer suggests) and was quite pleasantly surprised. Used stew meat and had the most tender lamb stew I've ever made - this is probably a good technique that could be used with other flavors.
