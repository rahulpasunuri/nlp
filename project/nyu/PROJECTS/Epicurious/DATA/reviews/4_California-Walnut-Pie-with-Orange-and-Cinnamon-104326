Needed a flour-less dessert to bring to a family occasion. Had walnuts and love Pecan Pie so gave this a try. Great Pie here! I did substitute lime zest for orange, as it was what I had...the pie did not have an overly citrus flavor, just flavorful nutty goodness.

I made the recipe as written but I found there wasnt' enough filling and I really think I like pecan pie better. This was just all nuts with a little filling. The crust however was FABULOUS!!!! I use it for other pies.

The filling (which I increased by half to make a fuller pie) was wonderful, but it was the crust that everyone raved about. (I used my hands instead of a food processor, and it came out perfectly.) The filling is a lot like pecan pie, as a previous reviewer pointed out -- really sweet and very rich. A beautiful alternative to the usual November-December pie selections.

I really enjoyed this pie, it is much like a pecan pie. The orange zest was a fabulous addition. My new micro plane zester worked perfectly for this chore. Since my family roots are from Georgia I will try it with pecans next time.

When I cooked this pie, I inadvertantly forgot to include the butter, but the pie was simply delicious, but with less calories.

I've already made this pie three times! Everyone loves it. It's very easy to make and the crust is outstanding. This will definitely be a standard.

This pie was easy to make. The filling was exceptional; although, I did add a bit more orange rind. The crust complimented the filling. We used it for a dinner party on Thanksgiving and it was a success("Can I have another slice, please?") This is definitely a "keeper."

So light, not too rich, but a great subsitute for pecan pie!
