The dough is sticky and tricky, but I was very motivated to make this for a Russian/Eastern European themed housewarming party. I actually loved it, and so did many of my guests. But to be fair, it is effort and it looks a little dismal.

I just could not make this work. The dough was way to sticky to handle. When I did get it rolled out it was impossible to traansfer to the pan. Good flavor, but not a beauty to behold.

holidays provided the time to try this -tend to shy away from recipes with yeast, but this worked well - outer crust was too brown and crusty for our liking though inner was delicious - not sure if this was my oven, the way it was suppose to be, or the egg wash - next time, I will begin watching it at about 30 minutes

Although it was time intensive and my picky eaters didn't like it, I enjoyed it and my Russian guests loved it. I especially liked telling people JUST HOW MUCH poppy seed was in it.
