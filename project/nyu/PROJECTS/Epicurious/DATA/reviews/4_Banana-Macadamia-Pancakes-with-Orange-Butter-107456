I would definitely recommend adding 2 bananas instead of 1. Like others, I mashed the very ripe bananas in, and the flavour permeated the pancakes: excellent! I'm not a fan of macadamias, but find that other nuts (especially pecans) are terrific substitutes.

Really yummy, great texture. The roasted macadamia nuts sort of got lost in it for me - not sure why, maybe I will try pecans next time. Added chocolate chips too!!! Needed a lot more zest for the orange butter.

I made this recipe with the ingredients called for (I did give the bananas a rough mash), and though the pancakes themselves are really good, it's the orange butter that makes the whole thing go from "really good" to "WOW!" Make the orange butter, folks. Trust me.

Just like JMHens, my husband and I halved this recipe, using sour cream and milk (1/4 sour cream and the rest milk) plus some really ripe bananas (the ones where the skin has blackened). The intensity of the banana flavor and the coolness and freshness of the orange butter with the crunch of the walnuts (that's what we had) made for a really wonderful brunch for us. :)

Amazing! I used plain nonfat yogurt instead of buttermilk and walnuts instead of macadamia nuts. I cut the banana in chunks like the recipe called for, rather than mashing it like some suggested. Topped with the orange butter, my husband and I agreed that these were the best pancakes we've ever had! For just the two of us, I cut the recipe in half and it makes one big pancake for the each of us, which is perfect.

I could not keep the smile off my face as I enjoyed these pancakes- The BEST ever!!! I would give this recipe 5 stars if I could. I did not make the orange butter and I used 3 small bananas and almonds in lieu of macadamias. This is my new favorite pancake recipe!

These are very good. I made them just like the recipe (though I mashed up the banana. I can see how they would be even better with more banana.

This is a go-to weekend favorite for me. I usually use pecans instead of macadamia nuts, and plain yogurt instead of buttermilk. I once used strawberry yogurt in place of the buttermilk, for some terrific strawberry-banana pancakes! I don't bother with the melted butter in the batter.

Absolutely delicious! Used an heirloom navel, the orange flavour really came through, no need for additional zest. Used the food processor to chop the macadamias, chopped them a little too fine but they were still lovely. The bananas we had were definitely small, so we used two, mashed. The best pancakes we've ever made at home, and quite possibly the best we've ever had. We only had a yield of 10 pancakes.

I didn't have butter, so instead used canola oil. Also reduced sugar to 1 Tbsp. (I don't like things too sweet) and mashed the banana. These are the fluffiest yummiest pancakes I have ever had, and I have been making pancakes for years. I will now use this as my favorite "base" pancake recipe. The batter is very thick, but that's what makes them so good!

This is the best pancake batter recipe EVER. Just barely mix ingredients, leave lumpy then let sit for 1/2 to 1 hour before use like for crepes. I added a bit of powdered sugar to the orange butter to hold in the OJ.

A great banana pancake recipe. I modified by using 2 bananas (mashed and incorporated into batter) and toasted walnuts in place of the macadamia nuts. These were certainly the best banana pancakes I've had!

Rating: 4
these are the absolute best I have ever eaten...the smoothness of the banana is made so interesting by the crunchiness of the macadamia nuts..try brazil nuts and hazelnuts...serve with nutella an d you can become part of some kids memoirs decades later.

Made these again this morning for my son and my niece. They are so delicious and just the right texture inside and out. We used walnuts this time in lieu of macadamia's and they were just as amazing. My son actually referred to me as 'Martha Stewart" with the complimentary Orange Butter, which will be delicious on muffins as well. YUMMMMMM!

These pancakes are quite tasty. I just had one cup of buttermilk so I added 1% milk for the other half cup. I didn't make the orange butter and they were really good on their own with some real maple syrup.

Fantastic! I used two bananas and next time I think I'm going to add cinnamon. I also added walnuts and they were de-lish!

Rating: 4
These are delicious and are now my go-to recipe for pancakes. After making this recipe a couple of times, I agree with reviewers on some changes. We think they are better with toasted pecans than with macadamia nuts. Love the orange butter mixed with the maple syrup. And, I agree that 1.5 mashed bananas makes them even better. Also, I can never find buttermilk here, so if you're in the same boat, the recipe works well with the same amount of normal milk mixed with a tbsp or more of vinegar or lemon juice.

I made this recipe without the banana, macadamia, or butter and they were absolutely fantastic. I'll try the more interesting version when I have more time, but this is a great recipe for plain buttermilk pancakes as well.

I made these for a friend using half the recipe, but still using one full banana and they were absolutely delicious... the texture with the coarsely chopped macadamia nuts is amazing... this will become a 'go-to' breakfast recipe... particularly for the upcoming holidays.. Fantastic

Rating: 4
My husband said these were the most delicious pancakes he's ever tried. Like many other reviewers, I made a few changes to the recipe. I chose to mash up the bananas instead of dicing them. I also added a bit more banana, added only one tbsp. of sugar, and since I didn't have any macadamia nuts, I used toasted, chopped pecans instead. I am still amazed that the pancakes tasted light and fluffy. Now I just need to try the orange butter.

Rating: 4
These are excellent, excellent pancakes, and have been my new "go-to" everyday recipe ever since the first batch. I too finely grind the mac nuts and replace that amount of flour with the ground nuts. I mash the banana too. These are so delicious as-is, I haven't even bothered to fuss with the orange butter.

these were very, very delicous, I did not add the banana and they came out light and fluffy

I made this for Father's Day brunch at the cottage and did not make any changes / substitutions. Everyone raved about it and my mom said these were the best she's ever tasted. Topped with pure maple syrup (from the local farmer down the cottage road)...it doesn't get any better.

Excellent! I used 2 bananas and mashed them into the liquid,added blueberries one time and strawberries the second time I made this recipe (as I prefer fruit to nuts) and doubled the orange zest in the butter for a bit more flavor. I also drizzled a bit of honey over the pancakes.

A terrific recipe. I made the whole recipe for just two of us to make on two different days, and both times my husband rated them the best pancakes ever.

I made this a couple of weeks ago for my boyfriend and I. We loved it. I added an additional banana, and I am a no milk girl, so I used soy milk. It came out beautifully.

Yuuum! Love the oranage butter.

I also like to grind up an extra 1/2 cup of macadamias for the extra 1/2 cup of flour. These are out this world and it always impresses guests to use up the extra hundred or so bananas and oranges that grow prolifically in our yard. Fantastic!

Rating: 4
Wow, these are simply freakin delicious. If you're tired of the standard plain pancake or if you want to impress some out of town guests, then try these. The orange butter is a must in my opinon, it ties all the flavors together nicely. I made mine a bit larger than the recipe calls for and it still made pleny for 4 people. Very easy to make.

This recipe is fantastic, and very similar to the pancakes served at the Hula Grill in Honolulu. Followed previous suggestions about increasing orange zest and banana, chopping nuts in a processor.

I am not that big of a pancake fan, but these are great! I put 2 decent sized bananas in, used all whole wheat flour, toasted walnuts, and yogurt instead of the buttermilk. I didn't mess with the butter either - they didn't need it.

I smashed the bananas as suggested by other reviews. I really like these pancakes but, my husband didn't like the texture Therefore, had to give this dish 3 forks only.

These were the best pancakes I've ever made. I skipped the orange butter and just topped with some fresh strawberries and a little lite maple syrup. I was worried at first because I only had wheat flour and 1% milk, so they looked a bit rustic, but they were unbelievable. My boyfriend and I were saying an emphatic "Mmm" after every bite. I cut the nuts down to 1 oz and used a nonstick griddle to reduce calories and they weren't missing a thing! My recipe made only 10. This is a keeper!

Had friends over and this was a big hit. Made recipe as detailed. Only feedback is that the orange butter could use more flavor and next time I will add more orang zest. This recipe was a great find!

I made these exactly as written. They were very delicious. I did cook them longer than 2 minutes on the 1st side,at a somewhat lower temperature, to let them cook through to the center, since it seemed like a denser batter. They turned out lighter than I expected. I also served them with maple syrup, along witht the orange butter. That seemed to be the touch that it needed.

delicious, i dont do dairy so, i used a container of strawberry flavor soy yogart and added soy milk to bring it to 1 1/2 cups,my kids ate it up

This is what I did: mashed the banana and mixed in with the buttermilk. Did not have enough buttermilk, so finished up with plain yogurt. Used 100% white whole wheat flour. They were fantastic. I recommend never ever substituting another nut in this recipe. The macadamias are important. Also, I thought it could use another half banana, but my husband disagreed, so I guess it's personal preference. Side note: use a food processor to chop those macadamias. I was using a sharp chef's knife, and it took a long time. The buggers kept rolling all over the cutting board, and I got a lot of shaved macadamias. Took quite a while to get them chopped.

This is spectacular. I made it just as the recipe said. When I made the orange butter I softened the butter in the microwave to make mixing the ingredients easier then put the mixture in the 'fridge to harden it up again. The orange butter adds a really tasty twist to the pancakes.

Really tasty. Doubled the banana, added a little more flour to thicken it up. Used skim milk and low saturated fat margarine.

I have made this now several times (upon a variant). Grind macadamia nuts about 1/2 cup and replace same amount of flour. Powdered suger and a drizzle of honey and you're set for a beautiful sunday brunch item.

This was a very good recipe but my batter wasn't thick at all. It was really on the thin side which made the pancakes a little heavier. I double checked the recipe to see if I did something wrong but I had the correct amounts. Did anyone else have this problem? Next time I will adjust the ingredients to thinken the batter.

Made this for family who were visiting from out of town and everyone agreed that they were the best pancakes they had ever had. I didn't add the orange zest or nuts. They were so light and fluffy with just the perfect amount of banana flavor. There was just enough for 7 people with this recipe, but they were small so I will definitely double the recipe next time.

These pancakes are DIVINE! When I make them, I feel like I'm at a 5-star restaurant, dining like a queen! They're fluffy, light and airy...they literally melt in your mouth. The scrumptous toasted nuts pop between your teeth and add a wonderful and rich texture to the cakes. The orange butter accentuates the richness of these pancakes and adds a delightfil zest. I'm planning to make these for Christmas morning brunch.

Fabulous! Banana pancakes are one of my favorites. For the reader with the child that didn't like the texture. I don't like sliced bananas in mine either due to the texture. Try mashing them with a fork and then mixing in. They don't change the texture at all but give a great flavor!

I followed the recipe EXACTLY and these were delicious! Then I sprinkled chocolate chips on some of them and they were decadent, fabulous! I will make these again and again.

I made this recipe for my family this morning. The pancakes were fluffy and the nuts imparted a satisfying crunch. The orange butter was a nice touch. My family didn't go over for the flavor and texture of the banana in the pancakes. My moderately picky seven-year old found them particularly unappetizing and ate only half a pancake. Although banana pancakes were a childhood favorite of mine, I agree that these would be better without them. Next time I make this recipe, I'll omit the banana.

What great pancakes - and we're not really pancake lovers. I made exactly as described, including the orange butter. I had a bit of a difficult time incorporating the juice into the butter, but it was worth it. We managed to use all the butter on only 6 pancakes - so it might be a good idea to double the orange butter.

Rating: 4
This recipe was absolutely terrific!! It is very easy to make and all of my guests raved about it---even those that aren't particularly fond of pancakes loved them! I made the batter before everyone arrived and let it rest so I could enjoy the company. As I fixed all of the pancakes, I kept the cooked ones warm in the oven on a pizza pan and loosely covered them with foil. It did not ruin the texture at all!

I made this recipe for the family this morning and everyone loved it! I doubled the recipe and was skeptical about adding almost $4.00 worth of Mac nuts to it but it was worth it. I was also tempted to add more banana but stuck to the recipe and was very happy with it. The orange butter was a little too subtle for my taste so I doubled the zest and juice and thought it was a nice touch, still subtle but a detectable flavor.

Yummy! I realized after making that we were missing the coconut syrup that we use when dining in Maui...extra calories, but would be worth it! My husband passed on the orange butter, but I thought that it added a bit of "zest" and cut the overall sweetness a tad, giving it more of a "tropical" flavor. Worthy of a Sunday morning treat.......

Um, maybe the reason you thought they weren't that good is that pecans are NOT macadamia nuts. Substituting ingredients is all well and good, but you can't really comment on a recipe when you took its showpiece ingredient and replaced it with something so inferior as pecans are to macadamias. Don't know why you posted a review for a recipe you really didn't make.

Rating: 3
recipe is very nice.I prefer to mash the bananas rather than chop them when I combine them with the liquid ingredients.Substitute grated apple for some or all of the banana and try different pecans or sliced toated almonds.I also thin my batter with a little nut liquer and 2 tbls extra milk

Rating: 4
Fabulous! Made these this morning for a group of friends and they were devoured heartily, and recipe requested by all. The macadamias, although pricy, added to the buttery flavor and complimented the bananas so well. All in all a wonderful combination of flavors. And what the buttermilk does to the texture is incredible. Can't wait to make these again.

Pancakes are good, but not fabulous. I substituted pecans for the nuts (1/3 the price of macadamias). Orange butter lacked pizzaz. I recommend adding some orange flower water and honey to the butter.
