This tasted way better than it sounded, I made it with the grilled steaks with red chili sauce and pickled red onions menu. I'll be making it again.

I didn't have the zest so just added a little extra lime juice (which wasn't fresh, either). Still very nice! Perfect on a summer evening.

This dish reminded me of the sides accompanying a Swanson TV dinner (fried chicken??) that I ate as a child. I needed to add a great deal more lime and lime zest to elevate beyond that taste. Also, it was a total waste of expensive haricots verts, given that you need to cut them into small bits to stir fry them. The cachet of these beans is their thinness and length. Don't bother.

This is surprisingly light and yummy. The butter is good, but to cut the fat content, I used olive oil. Just as good.

Delicious and easy. A little garlic salt a nice addition too.

Rating of four forks definately based on the ease of this recipe. Only a few, easily found ingredients are needed, all ingredients can be prepared in advance, and it only takes minutes to cook. Added a bit of color to the plates as well. The lime zest is key and added a nice twist to the otherwise well known flavors. Proportions in the recipe seemed good to me.

Excellent, easy, and fairly quick. I blanched the beans first for 20 seconds.I served this at a dinner party with scallops and everyone really liked it. One of the nicest things about the recipe is that all the ingredients can be prepped well ahead of time. I sauteed the shallots in the butter, chopped the beans and blanched them, and removed the corn kernels from the cob, and zested/juiced the limes before my guests arrived. Definitely will be on my table every August!

This is the perfect recipe to use all of the late summer green beans and corn. Just change the seasonings based on the menu you are serving. So easy and tasty.

Flavorful and easy. Great alternate way to cook fresh corn during corn season.

I loved this dish. We served it with halibut and it contributed a flavorful, refreshing, tangy taste to the meal! This is an easy & yummy summer side dish-especially perfect with fish.

Really delicious. A unique way of eating the abundant corn and green beans of summer. Made exactly as specified and it was great. I didn't think the beans were undercooked at all.

Great flavor - I liked the crunch of the beans. Lots of texture, flavor and color. Served with flank steak - lime and beef a great combination

A good side dish that gets a variety of vegetables in you. In the summer, I love corn but get tired of eating it on the cob all the time.

The flavor was delicious but the haricot verts were undercooked. I wish that I would have blanched them first as other reviewers suggested

Lovely, simple side. I tossed the shallots in the food processor, and because they were so fine they created almost a paste on the veggies. yum! the lime is a great addition.

Delicious, easy, and goes with scallops as easily as it does with steak.

My family enjoyed this recipe. I used leftover corn from the night before instead of fresh corn and I also used green beans. A great recipe for a hot summer night!

Easy and very tasty. Got great reviews. Couldn't get haricots so I used fresh green beans. I've already made it twice

Thought this was really great! Just really good fresh flavors + butter + lime. Nothing could be better.

Thought this recipe was easy and terrific and went perfectly with the menu from the July 2003 Gourmet Entertains (Grilled Steaks with Red Chile Sauce, Pickled Red Onion w Cilantro). Used fresh haricots verts and frozen sweet corn kernels. Cooked in a heavy skillet until the corn toasted some and the beans were tender.

Very good - fresh, light flavors and not overpowering, but just right.

Delicious, but not worth the trouble.

Very nice flavor, the lime adds just the right touch to the corn and beans. My husband really enjoyed it...and that says a lot for a vegetable dish!

I don't know what I was expecting from all the rave reviews, but not this. The lime-shallot butter added a nice touch, but the corn and beans were very heavy overall. Seemed like a waste of fresh corn to me -- try it with frozen in the winter, maybe. I ended throwing out most of it, which is something I *never* do.

Made this with fresh Delaware Silver Queen corn and haricots verts. Fresh fresh ingredients and a little extra butter (!) and it was fabulous with grilled beef tenderloin. What's not to love?!?

Ignore the comment of the other stating this didn't have enough zing. This was GREAT! I think the best vegetable recipes feature the flavor of the vegetables themselves, not oversauced. I will definitely make this again.

What a great combination of flavors! The zing from the citrus rounds out the fresh flavors of the corn and green beans. To the cook from Santa Barbara: it's meant to be a side dish; not the Last Supper.

Excellent dish... Great for the summer

As printed this was unexciting and not worth the effort it took to chop the vegetables. It does have great possibilities, tomato and basil, or dill and feta cheese, or orange rind and toasted sesame seeds would make the recipe work with a multitude of ethnic foods.

This is a wonderful side dish. I used store-bought green beans and lightly blanched them first so that they finished with the corn. What a treat. The flavors blend as beautifully as it appeals to the eye. Highly recommended recipe.

I don't usually have much luck with veggie receipts, but this one was a keeper. I will absolutely make it again. I used regular string beans, but they were fresh from the garden and delicious.

I was looking for something different to go with grilled steaks that I rubbed first with olive oil, and then with crushed garlic, salt, pepper, and lots of ground ancho chili powder -- a family favorite. This corn and green bean dish really hit the mark. Relatively easy to make and the shallots and lime really complimented the sweetness of the corn. I followed the recipe for the most part. I did add one more tablespoon of butter once I had added the corn and beans. I also covered the large skillet I was using to help the beans cook a little better. The next time, I may quickly blanch the beans first, so I don't have to cover the pan (I don't mind crisp beans, but I do need them to be cooked to some degree). This is definitely a keeper and a good alternative to potatoes.
