I absolutely adore the simplicity and great flavours of the salsa with the beef. This is the perfect 'go to' dinner party dish.

Amazing recipe. Easy to prepare. Great to serve at parties, sliced 1/4+" thick, served on platter with sauce poured over top. Crowd pleaser!

Overall I thought this recipe was delicious but not superb. It looked very pretty on the serving platter and the green salsa was fresh and not heavy -- a nice change from the usual port wine, butter, flour, cream, etc sauces. I did alter it a bit, using a lot less salt on the beef, and only 1/4 cup of olive oil for the salsa verde.That said, the cut of beef makes the dish -- beef tenderloin always tastes good.

Instead of serving the salsa cold I sauteed it and added some white wine, chicken broth, allspice and a little balsamic vinegar. The shallots carmelized nicely and the ingredients formed a nice sauce when cooked. Topping the tenderloin- it was perfect. Mild enough not to overwhelm such a nice cut of meat, I found that it was a perfect compliment that we kept piling on top of each bite of beef.

This is one of the best beef tenderloin recipes I have ever had. It is a staple when I am entertaining to impress!

The flavor of this sauce is fresh and tangy. I decided to process the four sauce ingredients (olive oil, capers, parsley and shallots), which made a rich green that looked perfectly spring-like flowing down one side of the tenderloin, with the wasabi cream sauce (see epicurious recipe) that I had drizzled down the other side. Quite a tasty show!

I have made this one many times over the past few years and it always gets rave reviews. I generally use a 4 to 6 pound roast and it takes about 45 minutes to 1 hour to cook. I don't double the salt, pepper or salsa when I double the size of the meat. It's great, I'll continue making it.

The four forks is for the salsa / tenderloin combination. We have made this dish several times and have received rave reviews!

What a way to ruin a beautiful piece of meat! The meat "cooked" by marinating in salt for 3 hours. It took 40 minutes to cook in the oven- not 12. It was so salty it was almost inedible. The "salsa" was like a runny salad dressing, which is so unnecessary with great meat, but was the saving grace because it drowned out the taste. Bon Appetit should pull this recipe or at least rework it. Thank goodness for understanding friends!

Have made this several times. It's easy and gets rave reviews every time. Made it for a friend who owns two fine dining establishments and he loved it!

This dish was a winner. I substituted the shallots in the salsa with finely chopped garlic. Then, added the salsa to sauteed mushrooms and poured the hot mixture over the thickly sliced tenderloin on a serving platter. It received rave reviews and compliments from my six dinner guests. Thank you for sharing this recipe.
