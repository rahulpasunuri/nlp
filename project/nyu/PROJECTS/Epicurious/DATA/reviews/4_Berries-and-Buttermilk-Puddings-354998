This was a delicious dessert and perfect for summer. The only problem I had, that I saw others had as well, was that the pudding itself was too soft. I left it to chill for over 12 hours, yet it was still very liquid. I suggest to at least double the amount of gelatin next time...

I only made the pudding, and although I found it delicious as is, it was too sweet for my taste, and I would reduce the sugar by 1/3 or even 1/2 next time.

I made some changes due to suggestions below, & also due to not having red wine or berries: -doubled the recipe (but changed milk:buttermilk ratio to 1:3 since I had extra buttermilk, and I dislike a lot of sweetness) -used almond milk since that's what I had - and since I used extra buttermilk, the richness wasn't compromised -vanilla extract instead of bean (just didn't have a bean). I'd add extra next time. -used white wine instead of red. -added 2 lemons worth of juice & zest -no orange zest or berries. Super simple and a nice light dessert at home.

Made it again with a little more gelatin and it was perfect-mmm

The texture is very soft and jiggly. Almost like a soft gelatinous yogurt. I wasn't expecting it to be that soft but it was good that way. Still, I might try it with a little more gelatin. I liked the refreshing buttermilk flavor with vanilla. I didn't make the berry sauce but it sounds good.

My boys and I made this dessert last Fall and it was sublime. I accidentally used a tablespoon of gelatin rather then the tsp. called for and it was a tad too firm, but after reading reviews, I think I may try again with at least 2 tsp. gelatin. I used dried lavender in lieu of the bay leaf and orange zest and it was wonderful.

This was pretty good, but the sauce was not as vibrant as I was hoping it would be. Maybe needs lemon juice? The pudding was loosely set, as another reviewer mentioned -- needs a little more gelatin, I think. And, could do with a little citrus zest to give it some flavor.

I tripled the receipe and made 15 servings. It was a hit. The only change was a reduction in sugar for the sauce from 3 tblsp to 2 tblsp. The buttermilk gives it just a little tang.

This was an outstanding dessert. A simple and light compliment to the fresh blackberries and blueberries from the farm market with notes of cheesecake and a soft texture. The sauce made it even more wonderful. The presentation was colorful and uplifting. We will definitely do this again.
