Almost too crunchy, but very fluffy inside. My husband and kids loved them. I thought they were a bit bland in flavor.

These were delicious and the best roasted potatoes I've had. I made just as directed except (since I avoid wheat at all costs) without the semolina. They were still fantastic. Goose fat is a MUST, not unhealthful, disgusting vegetable shortening or olive oil (which shouldn't be heated to such high temperatures).

Absolutely delicious! Perfect in every way. To those who posted the negative comments, whats your problem? Where are your cook books and television shows? Hating on Nigella may make you feel superior but it makes you look childish and silly. Nigella brings a breath of fresh air to unpretentious, wholehearted enjoyment of cooking and eating. Take a lesson, nasty people! I cant wait to make these perfect potatoes again.

Whoops! I WROTE A GLOWING REVIEW OF THIS RECIPE AND THEN REALIZED THAT I MADE A BIG CHANGE...I TOSSED THEM IN ABOUT 2 OR 3 TBS OF FAT, NOT 2 CUPS...IT WAS VERY GOOD THAT WAY...SORRY!

We LOVED this recipe! In fact, I'm making it again for our fancy Christmas Eve dinner. The only thing I didn't do was peel the potatoes. I have goose fat on hand and it made the potatoes delicious! Oh, and they ARE beautiful...

After 11 years of living in France, I know how to make roast potatoes with goose or duck fat - they are the best ever! And you certainly don't need 2 cups of fat, only two tablespoons... I never parboil the potatoes, just put them raw in the roasting tin, mix with the fat, and roast while stirring once in a while, for about an hour.You can add flavours (herbs) as you like during roasting, and salt at the end of the roasting time. This is a favourite in my extended family!

"Sorry Nig. I've made them your way and the really hot oven doesn't give you the best results. 350 and the same time gives crunchy luverly spuds. by A Cook from east coast, isle of wight England on 09/13/07 " Remember that depending on what ALTITUDE you are at, the time temp. is different. the higher above sea level you live the lower the temp needed. I am at 2800 ft. above sea level. for every 1000 ft you need approx 2.5 degrees lower for the same time/temp result so same temp equals less time. Adjusted my time/temp and turned out fabulous. used the Crisco. Despite having an abundance of goose and duck here, could not find goose fat that didn't make the cost ridiculous. Crisco is a good high heat oil.

I suspected I wouldn't like this recipe just from Nigella's ridiculous lead-in (what does she think tremulous means btw? I think she should check a dictionary). I agree with a previous reviewer that called these fried potatoes, not roasted. However, you can get the satisfying crunch without the semolina and all that goose fat, in a much simpler and easy way. When you're finished parboiling the potatoes (I let them go a little longer than she does), put them back in the pot with some olive oil (I am of the less is more camp) fresh ground pepper, fleur de sel, and fresh rosemary or herbes de provence. Put the lid on and shake well to thoroughly coat. Then roast the potatoes in a very hot oven for 30 to 45 minutes, or until the crunchy crust develops.

I made these for Chrismas Eve Dinner along side prime rib with great anticipation, and honestly, was quite disappointed. Being from the UK, my mom always "roasted" potatoes along with the roast for the last hour or two so they sizzled in the tasty fat to an amazingly crunchy and flavorful delicacy that just couldn't be matched by these little spuds. Although their texture and crunch was decent, I found them quite bland.

I'm sure these must be wonderful but these are FRIED potatoes, not roasted. If you put that much oil/fat in a pan and cook potatoes they are bound to be delicious!! Where I'm from (originally) these are called Okie Fries.

You buy the duck or goose fat in 16 oz containers at high end grocery stores. Use one container poured into a 12 x 9 approx, roasting pan and heat until really hot. When you put the potatoes into the fat it will come up about one third of the potato. 5 or 6 russets cut in thirds, that will be loads. Then carefully flip after 30 mins, they are fab !

hi there - o Could someone who is familiar with the recipe tell me what proportion of fat-to-potatoes to use? Should they be drenched in the goose fat or just a light coating? I am imagine you dont want them to come out oily and greasy. Not sure how much 6 pounds of potatoes would be, so want to get an idea for how much fat there should be relative to the potatoes? Thanks.

Well, they're in the oven cooking as I write....and my kitchen is full of smoke. Anyone else have this problem. Used goose fat at 400 degrees and I'm just hoping the fire department doesn't show up.LOL

Perfect potatoes! My family now loves this simple method of making baked potatoes so Semolina is always in my pantry now. I love the method of cutting the potatoes - a wonderful way of ensuring even cooking and even sizes.

Made these with duck fat as that's what I had on hand. Baked on top shelf at 425 for about 40 minutes as I had a roast in. I had cut the recipe to about a 3rd for two of us, planning on leftovers, but husband raved and finished them all. I must admit they are THE best roasted potatoes - addictive actually.

Perfect... and a real crowd pleaser! The recipe was well researched and produced beautiful, crispy, and delicious results. Bravo Nigella!

The best! Add salt and don't bother trying with Crisco, find goose fat!

Very crunchy potatoes, they turned out great! I was roasting a guinea hen at the same time and threw the pan of potatoes in with it but at 450*. I also used olive oil instead of goose fat and they turned out amazing. A keeper!

Sorry Nig. I've made them your way and the really hot oven doesn't give you the best results. 350 and the same time gives crunchy luverly spuds.

It is worth it to find and use goose fat even if you have to render the goose yourself.

Excellent. I used vegetable shortening, 500 degrees and only 15 minutes per side for good crust development. And all without the sickeningly sweet, over adjectised, verboseness oozing from my dark, however and henceforth, heretofore enlightened soul. Thanks Nig!

"...in all honesty it is impossible to cook roast potatoes without needing them, tremulously, to be perfect. That means sweet and soft in the inside and with a thick golden-brown carapace of crunch without. And the strange thing is, no matter how many tricky things you can attempt and succeed at in cooking, no matter what elaborate techniques you might learn to master, nothing gives you that wholly happy yet unbrazen glow of pleasure in your achievement that cooking a good pan of roast potatoes does." I couldn't agree more! Potatoes, like sex, can be ordinary or exceptional. Thank you Nigella, for sharing the secret for sublimly perfect roast potatoes. I am now so completely and utterly satisfed (even if I did use duck fat) that I greatfully take this into my 'kitchen' repertoire!
