Very good, but.... You don't put onion in pimiento cheese.

Smear some hot pepper jelly on the bun and wow. The sweet from the jelly, the tang from the cheese and the smokiness from the burger is a combination that is delicious. I am not a bacon lover but friends say adding crumbled bacon adds a tasty dimension to this burger.

Let's talk about a goopy burger either ya like em or not. Poker Guys Like Em!! This was a fun good tasting burger, certainly not the best one we've chomped on but way up on the list. The cheese has a lot of other apps. as well. We were stuffing tortillas with it, making stuffed peppers with it just unlimited milage on the cheese.

Wow! What a great idea! My family is from central Illinois with roots in Indiana and farther south. Our recipe for pimiento cheese spread usually includes a bit of sweet pickle relish and not quite so much onion. These burgers are SO good! Even if you choose not to make the burgers, if you've never had pimiento cheese spread, you should really try it! It's great on crackers, celery or on a white bread sandwich!
