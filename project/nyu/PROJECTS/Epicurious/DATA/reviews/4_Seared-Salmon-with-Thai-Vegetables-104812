I loved it.The salmon was cooked perectly per these directions. I served the sauce on the side. I made the Thai vegtables. Added bean sprouts and used regular mushrooms. Delicious. restaurany quality meal.

This is amazing, always a huge hit with guests. I sear the fish a couple of hours ahead of time (on MEDIUM heat, to prevent spices burning) then put the fillets on a foil lined baking sheet. They go into the oven at 450 for 7-10 minutes to finish cooking. This really reduces the amount of last minute work for this meal. Make the rice and veggies just as written. I also make up a large batch of the spice mix to keep in the pantry; that way it is ready quickly any day you want to make the fish.

I have made this salmon dish many times since 2001 and will be making it again today for guest with Copper River Salmon from Alaska. I have been receiving Bon Appetit since 1982 still a great magazine.

This was absolutely delicious. I followed the seasonings exactly, but I used Japanese sticky rice instead with great, sticky results - 1 1/2 C rice to 2 C liquid, half water, half coconut. I also served the Thai veggies with it and again, kept the seasonings the same, but I used different fresh veggies from my garden (yellow beans, green onions, red peppers, and slivered chard and stems) and bean sprouts. To die for. Really awesome. The dressing was lovely over it all and brought it all together. Make sure to use the coconut milk in the rice - it gives the dish that very subtle sweet taste and makes it more Thai. As far as the type of seasonings,I used Masaman curry powder, not just the stuff you get at the grocery, half regular mustard and half oriental hot mustard powders, and 2 chili powders too - chipotle and anaheim. The spices make the difference, so don't settle for bland ones.

Rating: 4
This was really good and easy to make. The liquid in the rice cooked up really fast while I was bringing in guests for dinner so I added more water and coconut milk while it simmered and it was fine. The salmon took much longer than 3 minutes per side to cook though, also fine. Sesame oil has the most wonderful fragrance to it and I can't wait to cook with it more. I was suprised by how much I liked this dish and will definitely make again.

Wonderful with my changes. I stir fried veggies with some dressing. Added more variety including zucchini , scallions, red bell pepper, shitake mushrooms,napa cabbage, snow peas, kale. Didn't have coconut milk and used Trader Joe brown rice medley. Salmon great with rub.

Pretty good recipe. Healthy, tasty, and pretty easy. It wasn't amazing though, and I was a bit disappointed that the rice wasn't more coconut-ish. I used lite coconut milk though which may have been the reason. I'll definitely make this again; between the aromatic rice, crispy fish, vegetables and sauce, it had a good appearance, color, and variety of flavors. My guests were really pleased.

This is one of my absolute favorite recipes! It's very easy to make and my husband ALWAYS cleans his plate! I love the spice combination...I actually triple the amount and have it to use on shrimp, scallops, mahi...just about any seafood. The exotic spices, tangy dressing, and the sweetness of the coconut rice are a perfect combination!!!

I thought this recipe was just ok, not too wowed by it. I also tried the Roast Salmon with Thai Red Curry and Bok Choy and thought that recipe was better.

Rating: 4
Quite tasty and much easier than it initially appears! I doubled the sugar for the salmon and used brown sugar instead of white and used only 4 tbsp of rice vinegar in the dressing. Instead of the thai veggies it calls for, I used a frozen Trader Joe's stir-fry mix with snow peas, carrots, mushrooms, edamame, and bean sprouts (I added in a few peppers). All in all, we found it yummy.

We do not see what the fuss is about. The salmon tasted coating tasted muddy, the dressing was acidic and did not complement the salmon or the vegetables.

This was very good, but I thought the dressing did take over the dish and everything ended up tasting the same. The coconut rice was so good on its own but couldn't taste it in the aggregate. Next time I will toss just the vegetables with some of the dressing, instead of drizzling on everything. And I agree with the previous reviewer, the amount of sesame oil could be reduced some.

Rating: 3
very easy and quick. At the same time tasty and healthy. For the salmon, I cut out the butter and seared the salmon on a nonstick pan. For the dressing, I only added 1 teaspoon of sesame oil just to get some flavor. I served it with wild rice instead - making it much healthier. will make again

Rating: 4
Yummy Flavorful dish! I liked that the rice and vegies went well and you don't have to come up with side dishes! The spice crust was GREAT and the fish was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. The vegies were excellent (probably the most time consuming part). Overall, this was fairly easy to make - - it took less than 1 hour to get it on the table. The only minor additions I made were adding some mustard seeds to the rice while cooking and I also added extra sugar (to taste) to the sauce since I though it was too acidic.

This dish was as pleasing to the palette as it was to the eyes and the nose. An explosion of flavor in every bite. My only suggestion: Use the Vinegar Dressing sparingly. It could easily over power all the other yummy flavors going on.

Have made this a number of times and have yet to find someone who doesn't love it. The combination of spices, vegatables and dessing is a wonderful combination. Unless you have an outside exhaust, be prepared to smell salmon for a couple of days. The searing of the salmon really permeates the house. Of course that smell just reminds you of the fantastic leftovers you have in the fridge.

Rating: 3
Wonderful flavor and company worthy presentation. I added the white part of the bok choy and I think the secret for the veggies is not to over saute. Crisp tender! I also did not allow the spices rub to marinate more than an hour and the salmon was fabulous. Searing on high temp is the secret here.

Rating: 4
Wonderful - not difficult - Made this pretty much to spec with no problems at all. I did not refrigerate for 3 hours - but rubbed the spices in a little and gave it a half hour. Still came out fabulous! A little less coconut milk in the rice would be a bit nicer.

THis is lovely. Quick to prepare, different, very tastey. I didn't have enough bok choy, so added a baby spinach and arugula mix to it. I used low fat coconut milk, so pretty low fat too. Each of my 3 kids walked into the kitchen and it said it smelled good. Can't do any better than that.

Yum! company loved it too. I lightly sauteed carrots, sugar peas and bell peppers (yellow, orange, red) instead of thai veggies as another reviewer suggested and was great.

I would make this recipe again but I might tweak it. I love the crispy outside and barely cooked inside of this salmon. The spice rub was delicious. I like the coconut rice with the dish. I used low fat coconut milk and added some shredded coconut to the rice. The vegetables give a welcome balance to the dish. I added some sliced hot chilies to them though. The dressing was sort of so so. I think that's the weak link. Over all this recipe went together in no time and was a healthy week day meal.

Very nice change, very easy, quick, very tasty. We just made plain jasmine rice instead of the coconut one. The seared crispiness of the salmon was great. My husband loved it and would make it again, but altho I really enjoyed it, it lacked the "oomph" that I was hoping for so if I never made it again I would not miss it. But I was looking for a nice fish-and-rice combo so this fit the bill.

This recipe is one of our favorites for salmon. I substitute an equal amount of orzo for the rice - you get a stronger coconut flavor and it is really good (and very popular with the kids).

The spice rub for the salmon was very flavorful even after only 1.5 hrs of marinating. I cooked the fillets without skin and got a very pleasing crust on both sides. I wouldn't change a thing. The rice recipe, however, tasted pretty bad. My husband, who is not a foodie, even commented on how basmati rice and coconut milk DO NOT GO TOGETHER! I'd stick to plain jasmine rice the next time.

To the cook from Coral Springs, FL: the sesame oil I use in this recipe is the dark, toasted one. This is a delicious meal and easy to prepare, and I have done it many times. I roll the fish in the spices and cook it immediately, and it doesn't seem to make a difference. Like some other cooks, I substitute fresh spinach leaves (since I usually have them at home) for the bok choi, and it tastes fine. I also substitute fresh lime juice for half the rice vinegar in the dressing, and put a few drops of sesame oil (instead of 2 tbsp which is quite overpowering for my taste). Finally, I serve it with plain (basmati) rice and it is just delicious!

We loved the spice marinade on the salmon. The dressing is wonderful, however, I did not have any FRESH cilantro and used dried and I know that it would even be better. I think that I will cut back a bit on the bok choy (used in the Thai Vegetables) next time...a bit over powering for our taste. Don't let the long instructions scare you off. It's very easy to put together and is terrific.

I'm hoping someone out there in cyberspace can answer this culinary Q for me. In many recipes, I see the ingredient "sesame oil" Is this the dark, toasted one or the plain one that looks like ordinary oil?? I can't say how many times I have made recipes, and I wondered if I was using the right one. An example is a chinese chicken salad. I know the dark, toasted is very strong. Sometimes it says "dark, toasted" and other times not, and I wonder in this recipe if it is the toasted one. Will wait for a reply before I try it!!

This is fabulous and very easy. I've made it a number of times and my guests rave about it, my husband loves it and even my kids love it. I've substituted spinach when I don't have bok choi, used other vegetables depending on what I have on hand, and it's always delicious.

The rice is what really wowed me. Basmati rice cooked in coconut milk is unbelievable! So easy and simple and so yummy; I'm going to make it often from now on. Everything tasted so good together and there is lots of room to experiment with your own vegetables and adjustments to the sauce.

The salmon rub was delicious. Everything tasted wonderful together. The coconut rice and Thai veggies complement the salmon. I also doubled the garlic and ginger in the vegetables and doubled the bok choy. The bok choy cooked down to almost nothing, so I would suggest doubling. Instead of searing the salmon in oil, I grilled it. This dish was simple to make although some of the ingredients might be difficult to find at an ordinary grocery store.

Rating: 3
As always, I lowered the fat WITHOUT sacrificing any flavor!! I suggest you do the same. It was so rich and tasty the way I made it, I can't imagine putting all the fat back in: In dressing, 1 tsp ot toasted sesame oil. In rice, saute rice in 1 tsp oil and used LITE coconut milk, for fish, seared in non-stick pan with 1 tsp. oil then baked at 450 for 10 minutes. For thai veggies, saute in 1 tsp. toasted sesame oil. You will be surprised how far in flavor just ONE Teaspoon of toasted sesame oil goes!

Rating: 4
So good...and I don't even like salmon! I made the dressing using the advice of others to reduce the sesame oil to 1 T. and to reduce the rice vinegar and it was great. The coconut rice, salmon, and dressing compliment each other fantastically. I didn't make the Thai veggies, thought they sounded very bland and "un-thai" without fish sauce so I made my own. Great dish, highly recommend it. I also used skinless fillets & grilled it on my indoor grill - awesome and healthier too!

I only made the salmon and the dressing. It seemed like the amount of vegetable oil could have been reduced -- maybe in half. Also, the specified cooking time results in very rare salmon.

Next time, I will sear the salmon to get that gorgeous dark color, but probably finish it off in the oven.

To Pat, the cook from Bermuda, the thai vegetables (listed in a link) are as follows: 1 tablespoon oriental sesame oil 2 teaspoons minced peeled fresh ginger 1 large garlic clove, minced 1 red bell pepper, cut lengthwise into thin strips 6 ounces shiitake mushrooms, stemmed, thinly sliced 3 large green onions, thinly sliced on sharp diagonal 3 cups thinly sliced bok choy (from 1 bunch; green leaf tops only) Heat oil in heavy large skillet over high heat. Add ginger and garlic; sauté 20 seconds. Add bell pepper and mushrooms; sauté until pepper is crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Add green onions and bok choy and sauté until just wilted, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Makes 4 servings. Enjoy, and let us know how your turned out. :-)

We prefer to eat lighter, so I cut the seasme oil in the dressing in half and used and no butter or oil in the rice. I also skimmed some of the coconut fat off the top of the "lite" coconut milk and used brown basmati rice. It was still wonderful.

I have made this dish several times, for a wide variety of people, and it turns out great every time and gets rave reviews. Last time I printed it out, I read some of the other reviews and found them somewhat harsh. This recipe will wow most people you serve it to because it looks so pretty on the plate...and half the battle is presentation. However, I did add a small red thai pepper to the ginger and garlic before stir-frying the veggies and it added just the right zing. I also put more coconut milk and less water in the rice which made a stronger contrast with the spices as well. The only other thing I would add is that using red and yellow pepper instead of just red makes an even prettier plate.

Unlike some reviewers, I thought the vegetables were quite good. I drizzled the dressing over the vegetables right before serving - it added just the right spark. Rice was a great variation on basmati. I did the spice rub on salmon and then baked it at 400. Probably would have been a bit better following recipe directions to sear and brown - but watching the fat. Very good!

Totally disappointing!!- especially the Thai vegetables which were very bland despite adding extra spices, coconut milk & soy sauce! I probably should have added red chillies to spice it up.

This is an elegant and very tasty dish. As I do not like to stay in he kitchen for last minute preparation, I found out that this dish can be prepared ahead of time and assembled last minute. I seared the salmon 3 hours before serving, put under the broiler for 3 minutes, before serving. Prepared the rice 3 hours ahead of time, covered, kept it warm then I placed it in warm oven half hour before serving. I chopped or sliced and refrigerated the vegetables. Sauteed garlic and ginger. Everything was ready and the house free of smell when guests arrived. All I had to do is sautee the vegetables!

The salmon was great, with the herb crust, like a blackened salmon. The vegetables were good, but not terrific. The rice vinegar in the sauce was really too dominant and we will reduce it next time.

This recipe was such an obvious winner, I barely deviated from it. Drizzled some of the dressing over the vegetables after adding the bok choy. I doubt that you could get a more impressive salmon dish anywhere.

One of the most impressive meals I've ever made OR had seen made. Everyone raved! Looked beautiful and tasted great! I didn't make the coconut rice because i didn't have time but instead used "A Taste of Thai" brand coconut ginger rice. Worked out well.

This was easy to prepare, beautiful presentation, and met with rave reviews from company. I added some fresh green beans to the vegtables and there was not one bite left .

I have made this dish twice since this month's Bon Appetit has come out, it was perfect both times. The flavors are complex and match so well together. This recipe is very easy to make and I recommend it highly. Great for a dinner party.
