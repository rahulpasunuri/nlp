Like other reviewers I used less broccoli, some potatoes and a quarter onion. Will make again..soon.

The texture was terrible. It was almost gritty. The broccoli I used was well cooked but not overcooked.It was soft but still green as described in the recipe, but it still came out with a rough texture after I blended it. It wasn't pleasant as far as mouth feel goes. Flavor was OK but nothing great. My quest for a good cream of broccoli recipe goes on.....

Okay, but nothing special. It was boring - nobody touched the leftovers, which usually disappear by bedtime.

This soup was delicious! I used some tips from other reviewers - reduced the broccoli to 6 cups and blanched it in the chicken broth and used 2 potatoes (boiled separately) ... use the liquid from the blanching and the boiled potatoes for the soup. Used a 1/4 of an onion sauted and a handful of cheddar cheese. Didn't need much salt since I had salted the potatoes and didn't have white pepper so I ground a few black peppercorns in the soup. I didn't have cream so I used half-and-half. It got rave reviews from adults... alas was not as popular w/the kids. It is very green and my billing as "spring soup" (we had an exceptionally warm day in February) didn't cut it w/kiddies but it did with the adults. ENJOY!

This soup was nice on the night - but even better the next day. I added the cream and some grated cheddar after blending and sprinked some extra cheddar and pepper on top to serve. I also cooked the broccoli in a mix of chicken and veg broth rather than salted water and used this for the soup. Yum. Yum.

A gourmet dish!!! I added some small pieces of SMOCKED SALMON at the very end and simmer it for a few minutes. Absolutely delicious!

A great beginning! I sauteed chopped onions and garlic in a combination of olive oil and butter. Added chopped potatoes and sauteed for 10 minutes on low heat. Added roasted cumin and red pepper flakes. Blanched broccoli in veggie/chicken broth. Added blanched broccoli and broth to onion/potato mixture and finished cooking until potatoes were done. Added half and half to mixture. Pureed in blender. Served with a dollop of yogurt. Delicious!

I am not a fan of broccoli - but am thrilled with this recipe. After reading the other reviews, I added onion and shallot, too.

Made this for New Year's and my guests couldn't get enough!! I might as well not have made anything else!! Loved the addition of smoked gouda...totally made it!!

Quick, tasty, and bright-tasting. The flavor of the broccoli really stood out here, and wasn't subsumed in the cream or the broth. I used the butter to caramelize a small chopped onion, then put the stock and cream in over it, bringing it all to a boil so that the flavor of the onion was incorporated into the broth.

Very simple and quick. Delicious and filling and healthy. Try adding smoked gouda for a nice twist on the taste buds.

Don't expect this soup to be really thick. Definitely add half a sauteed onion and some garlic. Also, if you're going to add cheese blend it along with everything else. I would leave more broccoli chunks next time also. This is a good soup to use as a first course. It may not be enough for a full meal. Really good flavor.

I have made this dish several times, and even though I generally do not like broccoli, I think the soup is delicious. For a complete meal, I place 3 cooked, peeled jumbo shrimp in a little pile in the center each bowl of soup . Everyone loves it!

i added an extra two cups of stock and a few dashes of tabasco and it was fabulous

I've made this a number of times, for family and for my night hosting my reading group, and it's gotten raves. I did a couple of things: I sauteed a whole onion and some minced garlic and pureed them with the broccoli. Also used half-and-half instead of whipping cream. For spice I added fresh ground pepper and a bit more salt - and this was really delicious. Living where I do, fresh young broccoli is easy to get and the flavor is fabulous. Yum! :)

Something was missing for me in this soup, like an herb or spice. I only give this two forks for my palate, but I'll make it again anyway because it was a big hit with my boyfriend, who helped himself to seconds and thirds. Maybe it's a guy soup. :) I added the onion, like other reviewers suggested, but maybe next time I'll add the cheese, too.

This is a simple recipe that is easy to spruce up. If it tastes too much like a broccoli smoothie, add additional cream or milk. Like the other reviewers, I also added sauteed onions and parsley.

Delicious! I have never had cream of anything this good. We used a hand blender to blend everything all at once and also added the 1/2 chopped onion, sauteed with garlic. Very easy to make and definitely a repeat for our household.

This is supposed to be a "lite" recipe? My version, which gets raves, requires only 3 tablespoons of cream. Use 4 cups broth (instead of 2) and sautee 1/2 chopped onion to be added with veg.

After using many recipes from this site, this was the only one that went down the disposal! In response to another review, trust me, it was not your blender. Final word: Don't Bother!

Very smooth and elegant. I added a bit of finely chopped fresh tarragon. Absolutely fabulous.

Why not cook the broccoli in the stock; therefore you won't have to throw away the nutrients.

Didnt like this recipe too much. I absolutely love cream of broccoli soup and was very diappointed with this recipe. I thought it would be a lot smoother. Maybe its my blender?

It definitely needed tweeking. I added more broccoli in bigger chunks. I also topped it with extra sharp cheddar. Also to keep vitamins in I used a cup of the boiled watered used for cooking the broccoli.

Like always, I ended up tweaking it a bit, but this recipe was a wonderful base for it. I added some mild cheddar this time, my fiance ate 3 bowls of it!

Just what I was looking for, a simple & quick yet delicious way to make cream of broccoli soup. I would mention, though, that it's much more nutritious to steam the broccoli rather than boil it & drain away half the nutrients & it works just as well.

Great basic recipe, but I added two more bullion cubes to the chicken broth, used half and half instead of cream, and included two diced/boiled potatoes run through a potato ricer, and a chopped/butter satueed onion to the puree. I topped the hot soup with parmesean cheese. It was the best broccoli soup I've ever eaten.

Good basic recipe. This recipe tastes better after it's sat in the fridge for a day or so. I added a dash of hot pepper sauce for interest.

This was very easy and good. A great starter or main course.
