Look for the more expensive Italian tuna in olive oil, really worth it when it is a featured ingredient. I also occasionally drain some of the oil (or add it to greek yogurt) and make a "vinaigrette" from red wine vinegar and greek yogurt to dress mixed greens and the tuna with vegetables for a more complete salad. Very simple, very good.

Wow-this is one of those recipes when the whole exceeds the sum of the parts. I've even made it without the feta and it's delicious. Quick and nutritious, too.

I added some chopped Italian parsley and mint, drizzled some white balsamic vinegar and seasoned with salt and pepper. Was tasty and very satisfying.

Simple, fresh and inexpensive. I used the solid tuna in water and a homemade greek dressing along with some crunchy lettuce.

should definitely use tuna in olive oil or use tuna drained of water and add olive oil. Also can use black olives or small capers

This is a family favorite. Look for the tuna in the Italian section of your grocery store.

I love the idea of using tuna in olive oil in a salad. I have changed this recipe by adding fresh spinach leaves, a lettuce mix, and garlic salt to make a complete meal. My husband and I make this often.

Fast, easy and tasty. Make sure you use the tuna in olive oil; try imported Italian tuna.

A well-received salad, albeit with a few changes. I used fresh tuna, grilled, and dressed with olive oil.

Simple and tasty. I should suggest using solid pack tuna as opposed to flake :)
