This worked perfectly just as in the recipe! It was the perfect topping for my Red Velvet Waffles.

I have made this recipe several times. Its quick and easy..also made a few changes...used low fat butter milk instead of milk and cream and alwayS add more lemon. This time I added cimminon powder ginger and cardiman for a more fall like feeling... served with apples that I cooked with honey lemon and nutmeg ...yum...have also served it e with honey cracked black pepper and fresh figs during the summer...leave out the fall spices of course.

Excellent. People were raving. I made this, along with strawberry sorbet (paula deen on foodnetwork) and mai tai sorbet from epicurious. Served with some coconut macaroons.. Great texture. So easy too.

This recipe is excellent! We have made it twice. We used 1.5 cups of whole milk because I didn't want to bother with the cream. I like adding 1/2 to 1 tsp of vanilla extract. It's wonderful with a chocolate-peanut butter sauce or a strawberry sauce (both homemade). Best homemade ice cream yet!

I made this recipe for friends at the beach this weekend and it was a huge hit. It couldn't have been easier to make, although I think I will add vanilla next time. This time,though, I topped it with cherry pie filling and served it with graham crackers for a deconstructed cheesecake of sorts. My friends asked for seconds and all but licked the bowls.

made this as my first stab at homemade ice cream and it's fantastic! so simple. i used light cream cheese, soy milk, and half & half bc that's what was on hand. added frozen blueberries at the end, tho next time i might opt for a blueberry sauce...the add-ins are limitless!

I turned this into an Apple Cheesecake by sauteeing apples with butter,cinnamon and brown sugar and added to the ice cream mixture during the last 5 minutes of the churn. It was a huge hit. I'm making it again this weekend!

Very simple and delicious recipe, but it was much too rich for my taste.

I make this recipe as is but add about a tsp of vanilla; the last time I just spread the ice cream into a graham cracker crust and served it with sweetened blueberries -- a very impressive dessert w/minimal time involved.

This recipe turned out great with a little alteration. I took the suggestion from another reviewer and reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, upped the amount of lemon juice and added frozen raspberries into the blender. The finished product was a creamy, refreshing ice cream with the tartness of cream cheese and lemon, and none of the "frozen frosting" aspects mentioned in other reviews. Served it in puff pastry shell with fresh berries and whipped cream. Delicious!

A friend made this and it was absolutely delicious. I am not really a sweets person and rarely eat ice cream but I love a good cheesecake and this is pretty much just like eating frozen cheesecake. Loved it. Loved it. Loved it.

YUM! I made this to go with rum cake. The ice cream was amazing and I will make again and again...

Had several flavors of home made ice cream and this recipe was by far the favorite.

Easy and tasty. Had only skim milk, so switched the milk to 1/2c & 1c of cream. Also added fresh raspberries & strawberries, but will strain before freezing next time. If prior reviewer wants "real ice cream" this is it. For frozen custard you use eggs and cook it. Thanks Alton Brown!

This recipe is delicious! It does taste like very cold cream cheese frosting, but come on, isn't the frosting the best part anyway? I could have eaten the whole batch myself. I am going to put it into a graham cracker crust and make it an ice cream pie. Yummy!

My family and friends were disappointed with this recipe. We all thought it tasted like a bowl of very cold cream cheese frosting. We all wondered where the carrot cake was. It was too heavy and much too sweet.

Rich and creamy - yum!! For fun, I added a few crushed chocolate wafers shortly before I removed the mixture from the ice cream maker. Can't wait to try it again with a fresh raspberry sauce poured over!

This tastes like frozen cream cheese...not ice cream. I'll stick to the creme anglaise base.

YUMMY! That's all that can really describe this. If you like your ice creams to be smooth and velvety, then you will love this one. It is simply perfect and couldn't be any easier to make. No cooking involved, no eggs- nothing complicated at all. But you would think by the taste that it was made from a rich Creme Anglaise. I served this with a blueberry sauce I whipped up with some frozen blueberries, sugar corn starch, lemon zest (good way to use the zest of the lemon in this recipe), and a dash of cinnamon and grated nutmeg. I also used half and half in place of the heavy cream because I still had a pint in the fridge, and I used vanilla sugar that I had stored up from the last vanilla bean I used. And I used pretty much the whole lemon's worth of juice. I also realized, after reviewing the recipe, that I had forgotten to add the salt- whoops! You'd never know, though. Great recipe!

Very easy and great to use with all sorts of fruits. I would increase the lemon juice to balance the sweetness a bit more.

Our first attempt at making ice cream and a great success! I used skim milk and reduced fat cream cheese because that's what I had in the fridge. It came out delicious and creamy and I can't imagine that full fat would be any better. This will be a spring and summer staple in our house. LOVE it!

I wonder Foodyites...and those of you on "low carb" diets... if you substituted say, Splenda for the suger, how do you think this would do as a sorta, kinda, approved dessert?

I love this recipe! And so does my family. It goes especially well with a dutch apple pie.

A major crowd-pleaser and one of the easiest recipes I've made. It is a great recipe to make ahead. Very good with the addition of vanilla and/or fresh fruit.

If you like cheesecake you'll like this ice cream. I used reduced fat Philly cream cheese. My son had requested peach ice cream so I added 2 cups of diced fresh peaches that I added 1/8 cup sugar to and cooked until juices thickened then cooled before adding to the ice cream mixture. I let the mixture sit overnight in refrigerator before putting into my Cuisinart ice cream maker. The mixture tasted great and the ice cream is in the freezer waiting for my son when he visits.

I agree with the other reviews - this is very cheescakey. It is very rich. I did not scald the milk and the ice cream is very smooth. The beauty of this recipe is that you don't have to plan ahead and cool the custard before freezing in the ice cream maker! Delicious and easy.

I'm going to try this, but I'll scald the milk. When the milk is scalded, the ice cream is smoother. Read Cookwise, it will explain it all. Never make ice cream without first heating the milk, it makes a big difference. Also, I'd add more lemon juice and a vanilla bean.

I liked it. My very traditional mother did not. I called it cheesecake ice cream instead and topped it with frozen blackberries and raspberries. I substituted splenda for sugar for my diabetic father. It was great, but maybe would have been better using half sugar half splenda. Also used 1/3 less fat cream cheese which added to the tart-ness cheesicakie taste and I think it worked great!

I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract. Good flavor on its own, but easy to adapt, too.

I made this for my family's Easter luncheon and everyone, including the kids, thought this ice cream was FABULOUS! It is definitely cream cheesy--has that ever so slightly tart-sweet taste. I served it with sliced fresh strawberries and drizzled the caramelized sugar & wine sauce that was to accompany the berry dessert in the same issue, which made for a very attractive presentation, but it didn't need it--it stands alone. I could eat this three times a day, but I will try to restrain myself to making it once a month. (And restraint will be in order because my fridge is always stocked with all of the ingredients.)

This was a simple recipe that didn't really knock our socks off. If you love the taste of cream cheese, you'll love this. It wasn't the best homemade ice cream we've ever had, but it was far from the worst. Kinda reminded me of unflavored frozen yogurt.
