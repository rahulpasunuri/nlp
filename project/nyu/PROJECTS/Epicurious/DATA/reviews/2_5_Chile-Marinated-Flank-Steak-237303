Although I wish the chocolate that could be smelled in the marinade was clearer in the final taste, this made a relatively straightforward but flavorful steak.

This recipe is a bit strange, so I can see why the other reviewer called it disappointing. I would like, though, to make it again and experiment with it. I think it has a lot of potential. Some of us liked it quite well, and others not so much, although that may have been more 'cos the flank steak itself was a little tough, rather than that the marinade was bad. Also, I made it in the broiler, not on the grill. The marinade is kind of thick so it is hard to cook the meat well on a grill without the marinade burning.

Very disappointing.
