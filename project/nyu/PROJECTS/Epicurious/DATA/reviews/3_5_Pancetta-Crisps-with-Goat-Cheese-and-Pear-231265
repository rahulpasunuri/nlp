Made this for a dinner party as an appetizer. Wasn't sure how it was going to go over but it was a huge hit, even amongst the real meat and potatoes crowd. Very easy to make; I put them on parchment paper when baking the pancetta and it made clean up simple.

I loved this recipe. It's very easy to make and very versatile. I can see changing it by adding different fruit or savory fillings.

This is a great, easy go to appetizer! Try fig jam with the goat or Gorgonzola over arugula. Have even topped with diced pear and peppery radish. Adds some nice color. Delish!

These were a huge hit at a champagne cocktail hour. Tried several ways to bake the pancetta, but what worked best was just flat on a rimmed baking sheet, just as in the recipe.If your pancetta is sliced too thin, just bake 2 slices together.They do smoke and smell, so I baked them about an hour ahead. Don't skimp on the goat cheese-the creaminess balances the saltiness of the ham. A really good, fast easy appetizer that looks and tastes special.

This was THE hit of our holiday party. Followed another reviewer's suggestion of using mini-muffin tins. They looked great! Filled half the pancetta cups with chevre and pear, the other half with mashed potatoes and cheddar cheese. The potatoes and cheese was much more popular, eliciting almost inappropriate moans and many weak knees. 48 pancetta cups needed about 4 medium potatoes, 1/2 cup of milk and 2 cups of sharp cheddar to fill them. Thanks to Bert at Ellio's German Auto in Sacramento for the filling suggestion!

This recipe was really good. Be sure to make the pancetta crisps well before your guests arrive. They are a pain to make, they smoke like crazy and the smoke alarm constantly went off but it was all worth it in the end. My guests loved it.

A wonderfully easy recipe that everyone enjoyed. Pancetta works 1000X better than proscuitto (tried to use it for a less fattening appetizer). Definitely use premium ingredients!

I was planning on serving this at a cocktail party and my boyfriend suggested I try it first...glad I did. I found all the ingredients at my local grocery store, fixed it all up and discovered the pancetta overbearingly salty. I like salty&this was a bit much (I got the ONLY pancetta available and maybe it wasnt the best quality *shrug*) . SOOOOO, what I did, smear the pear slices with goat cheese and sprinkled a bit of pancetta on top, balanced everything out and it was DELICIOUS!!! This deserves max forkes rating IIIFFFFF you work with your available ingredients, the flavors are all there!!

As with any recipe that requires so few ingredients, the ingredients must be of the best quality. These are easy to make and delicious. A nice crisp pear is necessary. And goat cheese at room temp. I have served these multiple times and quests are always pleased with the combination of flavors.

To be honest, I was disappointed - my hopes were so high after reading the reviews. I took the suggestion for a thicker pancetta (spot on). I found the pancetta too greasy for my taste, even after baking on parchment paper and draining on a paper towel. You need a very soft goat cheese - mine was too hard and crumbled with you bite in. Lastly, do't be afraid to add a good amount of thyme leaves - they are very mild and add a nice flavor. My guests liked these; however, I felt for the effort and the OK flavor, they did not deserve more than 2 forks. Sorry to be the dissenter!

Quick and easy yet elegant. Guests loved them. Pancetta can be baked and topped with cheese then refrigerated. Add pear just before guests arrive.

Loved the taste combo of this app. I folded the pancetta in 1/2 and then baked it. That makes it easier to handle when eating. (the muffin tins made these too small to work with). You only need to bake the pancetta for 6 1/2 mins or it will burn. yummy!!

December 2009 issue of Souther Living has a better version of this recipe. The pears are cored and sliced cross-wise, pancetta baked similarly and layered on pear slices. Goat cheese sprinkled on pancetta. Then black pepper, fresh cracked, sprinkled over, with honey drizzled over just before serving. Delicious.

I struggled with this recipe, but they turned out great in the end. I used prosciutto and tried to baked a few in mini muffin tins, but after cooking they were too small. I then baked larger pieces on a baking sheet. The shapes were irregular, but after adding plenty of goat cheese and apple (I forgot to buy pears and had apples in the fridge), they looked decent. They tasted awesome and my guests gobbled them up immediately! I think the trick is to cut the prosciutto into rectangular pieces, load them up with goat (let it come to room temp so it's easy to handle, then top with a wedge of pear.

Simple and elegant. Served these as an appetizer for Thanksgiving and they were a hit. I made them that morning and served at room temperature. These might be best if they were slightly warmed so the goat cheese is soft. Instead of using wedge-slices of pear I would cut the cheeks off the pear and use larger thin slices.

this was so easy and fab! I substituted green apple for pear and paired it with Sauvignon Blanc, perfect!

I made this as an appetizer last Chistmas. This has become a favorite for all of my guests who try it. The secret is: don't buy the pancetta packaged. Go to a deli counter and request a medium slice. Thin slices will crumble after cooking. Use a good goat cheese! And... don't try to use an overly ripe pear! (these seen to be the common complaints) Easy, perfect appetizer!

Rating: 4
This is a fail-safe recipe that has great flavor with minimal effort. I substituted gorgonzola for the goat cheese, as it "pears" (pun intended) nicely with the fruit and the salty pancetta. I didn't serve them as flat crisps. As soon as I took them out of the oven, I shaped them into small cups to make them easier to eat, and I didn't have to dirty my mini-muffin pan. I made these for Christmas and everyone raved so much about them that I'm bringing them to my in-laws' house for Easter. If you want a practically no-bake appy, this is a good one. If you want an absolutely no-bake appy, try the Belgian Endive spoons, which I served alongside these. Delish!

I experimented with this recipe several times before my dinner party. I used prosciutto the first time and my slices were too thin - just crumbled like bacon, so I used them in a salad! I finally settled on pancetta sliced in the deli at the #2 setting. I baked them on a cookie sheet like it says and as they baked the sides curled up a bit and looked like little baskets. At the #2 slicer setting they are a bit thicker and not as fragile. I used a combo of fresh rosemary and thyme from my garden (I had some starting to come back from last summer). A bit of any fresh or dried herb would be great! I cooked them several hours ahead of time and just covered the crisps with foil and kept them in the oven. I turned the oven (my warming drawer) on warm an hour before the party. Everyone loved this recipe - I will definitely serve it again! It is a keeper!

I made these as an app for Xmas dinner. Followed the mini muffin pan suggestion, which worked great and gives a lovely shape. I sprinkled a few thyme leaves on each "cup". the combination of flavors was amazing. We served them at room temp about an hour after making the cups. This one is a keeper

I am sure I did something wrong, but did not care for this at all. I used proscuitto and baked it the morning of my party. My crisps were not uniform, so the presentation was lacking. I really think the muffin cups would give you a more bite-size appetizer. This recipe did not lend itself to being served at room temperature. I think the crisps should be served right out of the oven! Doing the cheese, pears and thyme while your guests are there (especially if you triple the recipe), is a lot of work! On the fresh thyme, did you put use a small sprig or did you remove leaves from the stems?

Sooo good! My pear was a little too ripe, so I ended up using cranberry chutney. These little bundles are beautiful to look at and even better to eat!

I was so sad that I decided to make this recipie. The pancetta is very expensive, $4.50 for 10 very thin strips. I cooked it for 10 minutes at 450 and it turned into a mess. I had to throw it away, It crumbled into nothing but bacon chips when taking them off the baking sheet. I had maybe two pieces that I could have used. I would not recommended it. Perhaps the proscuitto would have been a better choice.

Rating: 4
FAST! Really yummy! I used proscuitto for less fat. Coiling a little strip into a circle in the bottoms of a mini muffin pan created a beautiful little shape. I found that less than a 1/4 tsp on the goat cheese made the perfect balance of flavors. I will definitely use this one often! If I want to take this somewhere, I will use Fruit Fresh on the pears to keep them from tasting like lemon juice. YUM!

Rating: 4
Crazy easy, and a knockout! I brought this to a New Year's Eve party three years ago, and people still talk about it. I couldn't find ripe pears that day, so I poached the pears (cored/pealed/halved) in wine+honey before slicing. Just saw the muffin-tin trick. Interesting, but I'd be afraid of "filling" these, it sounds like too much cheese for me. A thin, graceful dollop is plenty.

This is a wonderful appetizer, especially for those of us who love bacon! The key with this recipe is to use very ripe pears, sliced very thinly and to use fresh thyme, the dried stuff just won't cut it. Every time I serve this for a party people are asking for more! Its a wonderful combination of salty, smoked flavor blended with the sweetness of the pear and the highly aromatic thyme, so simple, so sublime.

I found a better way is to use a mini muffin pan. Sometimes the pancetta can fall apart on a baking sheet. With the muffin pan it cups it nicely. I also added a drop of hot plum chipotle sauce over top

I was not blown away by the taste which surprised me because it got such rave reviews. But these were easy and impressive looking, so I'll probably make them again. I used thin sliced pancetta and didn't have an issue with breakage. This may have been because I reduced the cooking time to 9 minutes as suggested by previous reviewers. This made the pancetta crispy but left some spring in it so it didn't break during assembly. I recommend going heavy on the cheese to balance the salt, and light on the thyme b/c it can be over-powering, at least it was with the fresh thyme I used.

This recipe always receives such favorable comments from guests. I made it again for a holiday party over the weekend, but had the deli slice thicker pancetta, and baked them in muffin tins. The presentation was still gorgeous, and I think they were a bit easier for guests to manage.

This was sublime, and so easy. The flavor combination is dynamite, sweet, salty and creamy richness rolled into one. My grocery store only had very thinly sliced pancetta, so I layered two slices to make the "meat crackers" thicker. I tried it with both figs and pears, because another reviewer suggested the figs, but definitely preferred the pears. Also, don't skip the thyme! It adds a little extra flavor dimension and kind of brings it all together. I used both dried and fresh to experiment, and found that dried is fine if you don't have fresh.

I love this appetizer...very easy but comes across as extremely gourmet. I agree with the other reviewers regarding getting regular sliced (rather than thin) pancetta and making it ahead of time. It is extremely smoky, so the last thing you want to do is make it right before company arrives.

Rating: 3
Very easy, the 'meat crackers' as we called them can be made well in advance. I let them sit on paper towels for a while before putting them on the platter. I put my goat cheese in a pastry bag and piped in onto the crisps which worked well and looked nice. Also I used slices of dried figs which gave a nice sweet flavor to the salty of the meat. Everyone loved them- definately will make again.

Four forks because this appetizer was delicious and super easy to prepare! Tastes as though you hired a caterer. I agree - next time I will cook the pancetta about a minute less, 9 mins. It might appear uncooked but finishes when removed from oven. All three ingredients compliment each other perfectly! Can prepare hours before guests arrive and add pear (get the best) slices before serving.

Wow! This appetizer was a hit. I requested that the pancetta be cut the thickness of bacon. Cooking it in the microwave on paper towels was quick and easy. The day before serving I mixed some fresh thyme leaves with the goat cheese and rolled it into small balls. Half an hour before the guest arrived I assembled the appetizers. To keep the pears from browning I dipped eat piece of pear into lemon juice. After placing the tidbits onto a large platter I was inspired to place a whole pear in the centre. The stem was removed and in it place I stabbed a few sprigs of fresh thyme. The presentation went over very well.

Everyone loved the taste, but I didn't bother putting them on my buffet b/c they were too flimsy. Bought pre-packaged pancetta b/c the butcher didn't have any... have learned. Everyone who I let try them (b/c I didn't want them to even go out) were loving them, though.

While this appetizer was well received, the you should buy medium thickness pancetta, not thin. By default, most deli's will slice the pancetta about right, but since the recipe said 'thin', I had them back it off. This left me angry several hours later when all of the pancetta disentigrated and I had to make an emergency trip back to the deli.

Tasty. And so quick and easy to make! I didn't have any problems with the pancetta breaking, but then again I didn't try to "spread" the cheese. Just drop the spoonfuls on top. Also, I would say 10 minutes in the oven is way too long for the pancetta. It took only about 6 minutes for them to crisp up nicely.

I made these for Christmas as an appetizer. Make sure your pancetta is not sliced too thinly or they will crack when you try to spread the cheese on top. I thought they were a little salty, but all the guests loved them. And they were extremely easy to make.
