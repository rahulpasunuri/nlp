I have never made a mushroom risotto before. I altered it a little as I was going. My wife works at a celebrity chef restaurant here is Las Vegas and she said it put their risotto to shame. The secret ingredient is love but besides that I was very happy about how she continued to rave over it. Sucks it takes an hour to make because we are going to have to make this once a month.

This was absolutely delicious! I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I made the recipe exactly as is except for one thing -- I did not have vermouth, so I used white wine instead. This will become one of my go to recipes!

Oh man was this good--rich, silky, and incredibly mushroomy. I made my risotto with a mix of oyster mushrooms, shitake, and cremini since I couldn't find fresh chanterelles or porcini, but the result was still excellent. Do take the time to saute the mushrooms in multiple batches so they brown properly in the butter, and definitely use low-sodium chicken broth if you salt the mushrooms as instructed. Not exactly quick, but well worth the effort.

This risotto is EXCELLENT and highly recommended! i made the recipe as instructed, except used cremini mushrooms and substituted the wine and vermouth with a chicken stock/red wine vinegar mix. I'm not sure why it's labeled 'quick and easy' however. It's not difficult to make, but certainly not quick. With prep time it took about an hour and twenty minutes.

Delicious, but you definitely need to be a mushroom fan because it has a very strong flavor. Ive been too lazy to make it again because risotto takes so long to make, but it is worth it.

This was my first risotto, and it turned out really well! Used shiitake mushrooms and didn't have vermouth, so used 1/2 cup white wine. Very rich and flavorful. My husband said that I could make it again any time.

Better than many restaurant versions! Be sure to use a low salt broth. Made this for my boyfriend, and then again for a Christmas party. Perfect just the way it is. Its so rich, the additional cheese really isn't necessary.

This recipe requires some editing. When cooking the mushrooms, make sure they are very dry when putting into pan, use less butter, a very hot pan and keep the broth hot as well. I used $50 of chanterelles, oysters, red furry mushrooms I've never seen before - and as they hit the pan they just let liquid go. They never got "browned" as I think they were too wet, there was too much butter and the pan was medium warm. All in all, not really worth the effort or cost. So many better risotto recipes out there.

I agree with the cook from Austin, Tx, you have to keep the broth hot and don't cook the mushrooms in one batch!! I would also add that your pan needs to be hot when sauteing the mushrooms, don't let them sweat! I used red wine instead of the white and vermouth, we thought it paired very well. I will be making this again for sure! Quite yummy! Thank you Epicurious!

I will not rate this recipe as I did not follow it closely - subbed sweet onion for the leek, veg broth for chicken, champagne for the vermouth/wine (open bottle - it's what I had!), and used only crimini mushrooms. Used probably 1/2 the butter. I thought my version lacked a little acid and the finish product was quite orange (same as my broth!), but was pleased for an inexpensive weeknight effort. Was plenty rich. Might use mushroom broth and vermouth/wine per the instructions next time. Served alongside Braised Swiss Chard with Currants and Feta from this website. In response to previous comments, I would absolutely NOT saute the mushrooms in one big batch, especially if you've splurged on expensive mushrooms - they will end up sweating. Tom Colicchio gives an excellent tutorial on pan roasting mushrooms in his book Think Like a Chef. Also, when making risotto it's important to keep the broth hot so that you don't arrest cooking each time you add a little to the rice. Don't cut corners on these steps!

excellent! my first risotto. it's time consuming and requires attention throughout, but it's worth it. I used half brown button mushrooms and half chanterelles (they're expensive!) and it came out with a wonderful, rich mushroom flavor. definitely use the parmesan - I don't know how this could be considered optional!

Made this last night and have to say that after the rave reviews I was disappointed. I make a number of different risottos, several from this site, and this one was just okay. Didn't have great mushroom flavor as I anticipated. Think I'll go back to my porcini mushroom risotto recipe that I got from a bag of dried porcinis!!!

Delicious & easy. Great w roast chicken or pork. Can use any combo of mushrooms.

Wonderful dish. Full with flavor. Made this for a light meal served next to an arugula salad. Everyone loved it, even one of my guests that didn't like mushrooms. The secret is the freshness and variety of the mushrooms. Will definitely make this again.

This is a solid risotto recipe. Don't change anything. Though I think you can save a heap of time by sauteing all the mushrooms in one big batch, in a large pan.

This was my first risotto, and my husband and I absolutely loved it! I halved the recipe, and even with very large portions, it was more than enough for 2 adults and a child to have second helpings. This was our entire meal, with no other courses of any sort. Had I made a starter and a dessert or salad, this could have easily fed 5-6 people. I used a mixture of shiitake and white mushrooms, chicken stock, replaced the white wine and vermouth with the chicken stock, and replaced the leeks with onions. I also used less butter than called for, and it was still a bit too rich. Next time I'll at least halve the butter. I will definitely be making this again, especially when we hit the colder months!

I have some issues with this recipe, though it IS truly delicious. The quantity is waaaay off--this yields far more than 6 first-course servings. We had 4 generous portions the first night, with 2 quarts(!) left over. In addition, it really NEEDS to have the butter reduced by 1/2 as suggested by previous reviewers--it was such a rich dish that my husband really did not feel all that well the next day, after having generous 2nds. The flavor is wonderful and I will try it again, making a 1/2 recipe and cutting significantly back on the butter...hope it works and retains the wonderful taste and texture.

Excellent and easy.....

I made this last night and my husband and I both really loved it. I used less butter than suggested and doubled the leeks to compensate for a few less mushrooms in the sauce. The other change I made was using all white wine instead of the dry vermouth - we rarely drink dry white wine so I wanted to use as much as possible of the bottle. This was a really delicious, flavorful dish. It was my first time making risotto and it was actually quite easy. I will be making this again!

A keeper, made it with a mix of porcini and cremini, added some liquid cream, and sherry instead of vermouth. Very easy, very enjoyable!

Delicious! I often find risotto to be very labor intensive with the constant stirring, and frequently the result is a bland rice dish. But this recipe is outstanding! Very tasty. Rave reviews from my guests and family and some even said they could have just kept eating the risotto all night!

This was delicious but I thought it could use more complexity of flavor. I would make again as instructed but will add more black pepper and thyme. I also wont bother dirtying another dish just to heat chicken broth before adding to the rice.

Risotto is the ultimate Italian comfort food. Creamy, rich, smooth. You absolutely do not need all the butter this recipe calls for, I use about 5 tblsp and it is still to die for. Love it topped with shrimp scampi and grilled asparagus. I always get compliments when I serve this.

Delicious! Followed this recipe to the letter, though I found the quantities of each ingredient in the recipe to be a bit odd. I boosted the arborio rice to 2 cups, and doubled everything else *except* the butter and the broth, which I left at about 1 stick total and 8 cups, respectively. I would have had trouble sleeping at night knowing that there was over a stick of butter matched with 1 1/4 cups of rice. But it didn't matter, even with my adjustments this was still a really tasty dish (and now I have enough for leftovers!) - I would definitely make this again!

This recipe is so far beyond good that I have spent many hours of the past several days since making it just sitting and thinking about it as one might a new lover. ...to the point where I may be compelled to go out in this snowstorm to procure some wild mushrooms and chicken broth. Really. I used regular onions, a lot more than called for, a bit more parmesan than called for, and a couple tablespoons of soft goat cheese. White wine but not vermouth (per suggestions). The shiitake shrooms were unbelievably delicious in this. I'd say more, but I'd better start scraping the car off cuz my husband is begging me for more too. :-)

This is the best mushroom risotto I've ever made, so it has quickly become a favorite.

There is a reason this recipe has a 4 fork rating and 100% would make it again... it's AWESOME! I made this dish as a side for Christmas dinner, and it was a total hit! I used medley of wild mushrooms-- cremini, baby bella, portobella, shitake, button, beech, and trumpet. I halved the recipe and only used a half pound of mushrooms and that seemed to fill the dish pretty well. This is a new favorite! Also, add the mushrooms after all the liquid has been used and before the parm. If you add the mushrooms too early it doesn't hurt the dish, it just takes a little longer!

Yum, I cut the butter but added browned italian sausage. Such a great flavor combination.

Made this in honor of our first big winter storm. Definitely a repeater. Nutty, creamy, delicious. Used crimini mushrooms only. They toasted up nicely in two batches with less butter. It wasn't until I was storing the recipe that I noticed Lori De Mori's name. I met De Mori at her home in Italy 13 years ago. Fresh cherries served on crushed ice al fresco. Best dessert ever.

Absolutely delicious. I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth and omitted the vermouth and used 1/2 a cup of white wine. I also couldn't find a leek so I used about a cup of finely chopped onion. This recipe is a keeper

Made essentially as recipe describes, although I was not so precise in measuring the butter, used vegetable broth instead, and finished the risotto right before serving with 1 tbsp butter. Delicious. Earthy, warm, and per wife made a prefect accompaniment to poultry

I went with the other reviews: used half the butter, substituted some good sherry (some for the pot, some for me...) and added some thyme-totally yummy!

I suggest ditching the vermouth like others have said. I also added a tablespoon of Marscapone cheese at same time as adding the Parmesan. I also went heavy on Parmesan. Not exactly heart healthy but creamy and delicious.

This recipe is really awesome, and super easy... took slightly longer than the 20 minutes they suggested, maybe 23 or 25. But otherwise followed the recipe exactly using an equal combination of button mushrooms/chantrelle/shiitake, and substituting grated Iberico cheese for the parmesan (which was a waste of Iberico in my opinion, but delicious nonetheless).

Rating: 4
Delicious. I used a bit less butter as well and did the broth additions pretty slowly. To be honest, I made the whole recipe for just myself and had some leftovers today for lunch. It was still pretty good rewarmed. Not sticky at all. I used fresh chanterelles, shitakes and criminis.

Yes, "risotto waits for no one!" is the motto. It will not keep!

I think it is IMPERATIVE that I mention that you MUST serve this dish immediately after it is ready. Otherwise you wind up with a substance like paste. My husband was late coming home from work, thus, that late serving of dinner, which ruined this otherwise amazing dish. The flavors are wonderful, just make sure as soon as it is done, you get it on the plates! Additionally, I did not use 9 1/2 tablespoons of butter. Maybe half of that.

Followed recipe exactly, except less butter and more olive oil. Cooking the mushrooms in batches and letting them brown a bit is key. Served with arugula salad...fabulous!!!
