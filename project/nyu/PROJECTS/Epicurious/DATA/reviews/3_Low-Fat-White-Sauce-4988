I used 1/2 cup of skim milk and 2 1/2 cups of low sodium chicken broth. I also omitted the nutmeg but put in plenty of minced and powdered garlic. Instead of the parmesan, I used the left over white cheddar and swiss I had in the fridge. I completely omitted the egg and butter. It has made a fantastic white sauce. I plan on using it with mashed butternut squash and roasted pine nuts in a lasagna

So, I ruined my first attempt because my pan was too hot. Rookie mistake. Started again with a cooler pan and it turned out well. Its not the absolutely tastiest white sauce I've ever made- but the tastiest one has heavy cream and lots of butter.. So for the health factor this is pretty good. I'll make it again for sure. Next time maybe a bit more spices (garlic maybe?)

i made this with skim milk and gorgonzola instead of parmesan - good basic and low-fat sauce for pasta or anything else.

Good basic recipe, turns outs just like a regular bechamel. I made a half portion, used 2% milk and forgot the butter, and it was extremely thick. Next time I'll use less flour as the other comments suggested and possibly a lower fat milk. All in all, it was delicious and did seem low fat. Definitely needs doctoring, I used some garlic and onions along with some yellow squash and sweet corn.

As some others have discovered, this is a great base sauce but lacks something on it's own. I added roasted garlic and sauteed baby artichokes. Wonderful over pasta!

A great basic white sauce recipe than can be doctored up anyway you like. If using low-fat milk (such as 1%), I'd add the milk very gradually, as it's more watery and you may not need a full 3 cups. I used 2% milk. The end result is a sauce that's flavor is not as rich tasting as when using heavy whipping cream, but still a decent alfredo sauce with less fat. Will definitely make this again!

Made this with the hearty vegetable moussaka on Epicurious, substituting a 1/2 cup of strong feta for the parmesan cheese. Thickens nicely and is very quick.

I used many suggestions from this website, goes to show it is worth reading all reviews! I used 2 cups milk, one cup white wine, and omitted egg as suggested. I also added chopped spinach, petite dice canned tomatoes (garlic and olive oil kind, drained), and some dried garlic, onion, and basil. Also added 1/4 of asigo cheese. Cut the flour to 5 tablespoons as suggested, and simmered for 5 minutes more. SO GOOD! I made it with penne, which grabbed the sauce nicely. I live in Boston, and my roommates thought I bought home take-out from the North End. Wonderful base recipe to play with. I will say again though, is a base recipe, if made as is is a bit bland. Have fune with it!

I use evaporated skim milk to cut down on fat and it gives the sauce a good consistency and flavor.

I really liked this sauce, but I didn't have any nutmeg, so I added in some garlic salt and some basil, and it went very well together. I also didn't use an egg, and I used skim milk. I found this sauce a bit thick, however - especially when it's not super-hot. Next time I think I'll cut down on the flour (as previously suggested). Any other suggestions?

I make this white sauce often. I omit the egg and change the type of cheese used based on what I am using the sauce for. You can also add dried or fresh herbs for additional flavor and texture.

I too have made this sauce several times. Its great with the addition of chicken stock and/or wine, other wise its a little milky and bland. I also have left out the egg a few times and the sauce doesnt seem to suffer. However, I repeatedly find that 6 tbs of flour is way too much (as another reviewer noted the sauce gets very thick, more like "icing") so I use less. Not sure if its due to high altitude or low humidity but here 4 tbs is plenty. Great sauce though! Easy to alter and include veggies to go over pasta.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I `tempered` the egg before adding it to the flour/milk mixture. I was surprised at how non low fat it tasted. Makes alot too. I see endless possibilities with this recipe.

This is a terrific ingredient. I am trying weight watchers and this is only 2 points per serving at 8 servings per recipe. I just made it adding sauté mushrooms, onions, garlic & chicken with pasta. (This is a recipe that I used to make using cheese in a béchamel sauce.) This was terrific result for the calories. I plan to add some homemade tomato sauce tomorrow over pasta with shrimp and scallops! This lends itself to great creativity.

As written, I thought the sauce was okay, but a little flat. I agree with the previous reviewer that some chicken stock and wine might perk it up, I will try that. Also agree that one should simply temper the egg, preserves the sauce con-sistency better than adding cold or at the beginning.

This is good by itself but also is an excellent base for making all kinds of low-fat sauces. I used 2% milk since that's all that was at the store. I cut the milk down to 2-1/2 cups and substituted 1/2 cup chicken stock. Next time I think I would cut down on the milk even more and add a little white wine. I slowly tempered the egg with the hot milk before pouring the whole thing in the sauce. It thickened up beautifully. I served this as-is over broiled chicken. It was great! Next time I would experiment by adding fresh basil or tarragon for chicken; dill, mustard, or horseradish for fish. With my revisions, my calorie counting software rates this at 61 calories and 2.5 g. fat per 1/4 cup serving. Bon appetite!

Great with the hearty Moussaka. I'm not a white sauce fan, so I don't anticipate using it again, except for when I make Moussaka. I used Romano cheese (that's what I had) and it was wonderful. Make sure you let the sauce cool a bit before adding the egg, and whisk it well until it is smooth or it will scramble for sure.

I used this for the moussak recipe. The parmesan to thicken is a stroke of genius for flavor and keeping it low-fat.

I added mixed seafood to this white sauce and poured it over egg noodles. The outcome was delicious and guilt-free. I would recommend this recipe.

I think that if you beat the egg into the cold milk before you start to heat the white sauce, there is a less likely chance that the egg will scramble in the hot liquid. I would also add just a touch of minced fresh Italian parsley.
