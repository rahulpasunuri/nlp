Accidentally used twice as much red pepper flakes. Highly recommend doing this! Served with cumin rice and sliced garden tomatoes. Was a delicious meal!

I toasted the whole spices before grinding out of habit and because it really brings out the flavors and aromas. This dish is genius! Simple ingredients and straight forward preparation - more than the sum of it's parts.

Great summer recipe and the husband raved throughout the meal that this needs to be in the rotation at least once a month. Served It with Cline Rose Mouvedre and they were made for each other.

Delicious! Unfortunately I didn't have whole seeds so I used cumin powder and coriander power. I was too lazy to grill so I cooked the lamb in the oven for 30 minutes instead (I'm sure it's even better grilled) The meal was still delicious! My husband was skeptical about all the strange ingredients at first but he ended up loving it! I ended up licking the spoon!

made this the other day and it was great - my husband and company raved. I didn't have apricot jam so use orange marmalade - still delicious. Have a dinner party coming up and will make this then - but will try it with apricot jam. Eggplant turned out very tasty.

Loved this recipe. It was a bit of work, but well worth it. I would suggest shish kabob baskets if you can find them!!

Made with lamb chops instead of skewering the lamb. Had separate fruit skewers. DO NOT SKIP MAKING THIS RECIPE. Lovely. Paired it with the pea, radish, feta salad and steamed rice. It was a warm evening and this was perfect

The lamb and glaze are delicious. Fresh figs were out of season so we substituted pears. Gave 3 stars because the eggplant was not so tasty. Next time would marinate the eggplant with at least lemon and oil.

I've made this recipe several times and it is always a hit. I followed the recipe pretty closely and it is absolutely delicious.

I have used Epicurious for years and this is my first review. The dish was easy to prepare and sensational. Use American Lamb, much better taste and make sure it's done Med-Rare. I marinated it with the olive oil and spices for a few hours in the fridge. We had one guest that didn't like lamb so I used one skewer of chicken. That worked very well. I found a jar of Mint Chutney at my local supermarket, in the Indian section, added this to the glaze. (about a tablespoon) It's hot but also has a concentrated mint flavor. You might want to cut down on the pepper flakes if too spicy. I also had some oven dried tomatoes that I served over the eggplant, they have a rich concentrated taste and adds a nice splash of color to the presentation. This really was a incredible dish.

Amazingly good and easy!! Everyone loved them.

To die for! I used already ground spices instead of whole, and used reconstituted dried figs instead of fresh. Also, I'm not a fan of eggplant, so I substituted zucchini. Very quick and easy, and the flavors were sublime. Enough for four big appetites.

Superb! A great party recipe!

Do yourself a favor and MAKE THIS RECIPE. I've had made this half a dozen times and never regret it. Some may find it a little too spicy but I think it's perfect. Alternate serving suggestion: Cut the lamb into bite-sized cubes, grill lightly, and then serve with toothpicks and the glaze on the side. Makes an excellent appetizer!

What an amazing recipe! Just made this tonight for Easter. Didn't make skewers - used a whole boneless leg of lamb for a grander presentation. Served roasted new potatoes on the side. The sweetness of the glaze with just the perfect amount of spicy kick was so memorable! And the mint complemented everything perfectly... Fresh figs aren't in season so I reconstituted dried figs in boiling water. Grilled them whole. I'm now looking for another set of guests to entertain with this meal!

Absoluetly wonderful. Have made this a few times to rave reviews. Even my husband likes it, and he is of middle eastern lineage and eats lamb like it's job. I have followed the recipe closely, although I usually add red onion chunks to the skewers.

I just made this for the second time and it was even better than the first. the left overs were great in a whole wheat naan from whole foods

made just the skewers with chicken, lamb and figs for a large dinner to rave reviews. used the green figs (was afraid the black ones would fall apart)

Rating: 4
Excellent. We made this for company last night and everyone raved. I loved that it was fairly easy to prepare and perfect use for figs. No need to grind your own spices--I think it worked fine with regular ground coriander and cumin.

Rating: 4
Outstanding! An interesting, unique combination of flavors. Of course, I had to make a few changes. my figs were a little underripe, so I cooked them at a different pace on separate skewers, solving the problem others mentioned about the figs overcooking. With only the lamb on some skewers, it was easier to cook them to a perfect med-rare. The glaze was perfect - I used a little more red pepper, as I like spice. It would burn on the grill if added too soon. I thought the plate would be too colorless, so I served the dish with sliced cucumbers, tomatos, kalamata olives, and cubed feta - typical mid-eastern style. Instead of the sliced eggplant, I grilled the whole eggplant and mashed it with yogurt and garlic. This was an excellent summer dish, as everything came from the grill outside or from the garden, so I didn't have to heat up the kitchen. A top-ten from epicurious.

Modified the lamb preparation -- brushed the lamb lightly with oil then pressed the spice mixture on lamb racks. Grilled to medium these, plus the glaze, were exceptional. Also separately grilled vegetables. Had several requests for the recipe and will definitely serve this again.

Loved this. Next time, I will substitute the pepper flakes with chipotle in adobo sauce, adding some smoky flavor to the hot/sweet glaze.

Excellent recipe, even for people who don't love lamb. The spice mixture is just right and the lamb and figs compliment each other perfectly. I added red onion to the skewers. Eggplant is good too, though not a must. Serving with heated pita worked well.

I made this for an event, but instead of lamb, I used chicken. Also, no fresh figs were available so I used dried figs that I steeped in Chai Tea to soften. Let me tell you.....Everyone LOVED it!

Rating: 4
Amazing! I had to skip the figs, but as a way of cooking lamb, it was great! My only mistake was letting the glaze cool down to much after making it; it returned to a near-solid state, making it almost impossible to put on the lamb, so I had to re-heat it. Otherwise, it was perfect!

Rating: 4
The flavors were delicious, but next time I will make some changes. The 1inch pieces of lamb were just too small and seemed to shrivel up on the skewers so I would make them a bit larger. I would also buy more lamb than required because the leg (it was my first time cooking leg) was fairly fatty and I had a lot of scrap and much less meat than actually required. Otherwise, it was great!

Rating: 4
Excellent. I modified the recipe by adding oregano, rubbed mint and garlic to the oil on the lamb and added peppers and onions to the skewers. Do on a charcoal grill if possible.

This is a wonderful recipe. Whole figs are tough to find in wintry Montana, so I substituted whole dates for the figs and used both leg of lamb and a breast cut. I was worried the lower quality breast cut would turn out poorly, but needn't have worried. The meat was delicious. My guests raved about the dish, and the dates were perfect. They complimented the lamb and held their shape on the grill.

My friend gave me fresh figs from her own tree and I happened to have eggplants so this recipe seemed just right. It turned out to be beyond right and was fabulous. Everyone who tasted it loved it. But don't make my mistake and marinate it for a long time... the figs just melted away. Definitely a keeper.

This was fast and easy to make and very tasty. It was too late to grill so I broiled the skewers in the oven and it was fine. Don't make my mistake and marinate overnight... the figs just about melted away! But do make the dish.

I followed the recipe exactly and was not disappointed. It is a very easy dish (I did make the sauce earlier in the day) and the flavors are wonderful together. I used fresh figs and organic eggplants from the farmers market. I think my next dessert will be grilled figs over ice cream - they are so good grilled. I can't wait to make this dish again.

Fabulous recipe--results beyond my expections. I've never cooked lamb before, but now I'm craving to do it again! The only cut of leg of lamb my supermarket had was "lamb leg sirloin chops", & I took all they had (resulting in 2 pounds of meat after removing the bone and trimming the fat away, but the full recipe of marinade wasn't excessive for 1/3 less meat). I used a mortar & pestle to coarsely grind the seeds. Thought maybe I should've toasted the seeds first, but not necessary. I allowed the lamb & figs (I too had to use dried figs) to marinate for a few hours in the fridge. Used bamboo skewers soaked in water, but the exposed skewer still burned--didn't matter, because I removed the lamb & figs before serving. Brushed on the glaze immediately after removing the skewers from the grill because another minute would have meant overcooking the lamb. I'd do it that way again next time--my glaze was thick enough that it held on to the meat, and also I may have ended up burning them because of the sugar from the jam if I applied it while on the grill. Next time I'll use vidalia onion, pineapple, peaches, plums, &/or red bell pepper instead of the figs (or meat alone). I'll also leave a couple skewers unglazed--the glaze was great (don't skip it), but may be too spicy for some guests.

Me again. Marinated deboned lamb leg overnight.

Awesome flavours. Did this with a deboned leg of lamb on the barbie. Figs were not in season. Served with saffron/apricot/almond pilaf. The grilled eggplant was out of this world. Hubby said it was the best lamb he'd ever tasted. Thanks epicurious

This was one of the best dishes I've served at a dinner party. Unanimously loved! I would definitely make this again. I would not change a thing but be sure to choose figs which are firm so they don't melt away on the grill.

I loved this recipe. Everything turned out delicious and was easy to make. I used two differnt kinds of figs (I found them at whole foods), and intertwined among the lamb chunks - it gave off such an aromatic smell. To the apricot mint glaze I added extra red pepper flakes for an added punch.

I agree that this was really good. And to Laura from Calabasas, your review was one of the most straightforward, sensible and real reviews that I've seen on this sight. Thanks and you go girl.

This is a great recipe BUT I could not find fresh figs, and wish that they had a note on what to use if you could not find fresh figs. It would be helpful in any and all recipes to offer suggestions when using ingredients that may not be widely available or are seasonal.

This turned out probably better than anything I've ever made before. I'm not a pro cook, or anything but it was just one of those meals where everything works out perfectly. I'm not sure if it's because I used a high quality piece of meat, or if it's because I marinaded it for a few hours (with the spices and olive oil), or if it's because of the glaze... but the meat turned out VERY tender, almost creamy, and the combination of flavors was amazing. Very interesting flavors... When I was cooking the glaze, I was very nervous about how it was going to turn out because it really tasted odd - the jam, mint and vinegar had a strange taste. It also seemed very spicy which appeals to me but not everyone I was cooking for. But when it was all put together, all the flavors were very well balanced. I would think this is an exceptional dish for a special occasion barbecue.

this was a yummy recipe. I made some variations w/the glaze: I used marmalade and pear jam that I had leftover and I used white wine vinegar (ran out of red!). It turned out great - I also glazed the figs!!

This recipe was delicious. As per the other reviewer, I also was unable to buy fresh figs, so I substituted with dried apricots & prunes, which worked out well. I'd definately cook this again.

This recipe was a hit. I served it to my mother-in-law without trying it first, so I was sweating it! She and everyone else loved it. It is just spicy enough and very tasty! I followed the recipe exactly except that my store did not have fresh figs. I used sun dried figs instead, as opposed to leaving them out all together, and they worked wonderfully. The fig and lamb is a suburb flavor combination. I also served a curry flavored couscous which went very well. I called it a "middle eastern dinner." Delicious. Will certainly make again.
