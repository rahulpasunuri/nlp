This was so easy to prepare & tasty. There wasn't much of a mess to clean up either. Next time, I would use half of the red pepper, or maybe try mushrooms instead. Also, the potatoes need lots of salt. Mine came out a bit under-seasoned. It tastes just like the tortillas I had in Spain. I will definitely make this again!

Another suggestion for getting the top nicely browned: use either a tortilla/frittata pan that is actually two pans sold together that fit together and you can flip the frittata and then brown the other side. This can also be done with any two pans of similar size.

Easy and quick for a simple, but hearty meal paired with a salad. Because I had these ingredients on hand, I substituted diced mushrooms for the bell pepper and fresh basil for the thyme. Also used fontina cheese instead of the parmesan and it was great.

This is a solid recipe that can be adapted to suit your preferences. I used sliced mini new potatoes, and omitted the red peppers (only because my daughter detests them). I chopped up the capers and added them into the egg mixture along with the parsley, which I would recommend. Served some sausages on the side (had some left over - it was a good combination) and a green salad. A nice simple dinner.

This has been a staple in my kitchen for quite a while. It makes an easy weeknight dinner when served with a salad. Delicious!

I thought this was delicious. I did make a few minor changes, but I don't think they altered the dish very much, certainly not enough that I can't review it. So here they are: I used half the bell pepper (too much does not agree with me), yukon gold potatoes, an extra egg, and I used much less thyme and chopped it up with the parsley and threw half of that into the second round of sauteed vegetables right at the end, sprinkling the rest over the top when serving. No big change. Delicious, I tell you. I served it for the World Cup Final 2010 where Spain not only played but won :D and it was also a hit. The nonstick pan is a total must, and I also ran a silicone spatula around the edges a few times during cooking to help loosen it even more. It came out beautiful, golden brown and so tasty.

Delish! Made a great brunch with a side of cottage cheese. I baked half of the capers into the dish, as someone suggested, and put the pan into the oven for a few minutes (at around 300F) at the end, as someone else suggested. It turned out perfectly that way!

One of my favorites. Have made this many times, just finally got around to reviewing it. You do not have to change anything - just follow the recipe!

The only odd thing in this otherwise very good recipe is sprinkling the capers on top at the end. I would either include them in the mix as you cook or eliminate them altogether. I noticed a number of them simply rolled onto the plate as we ate the dish.

I make these egg based dishes frequently. (See how I side stepped the frittata- tortilla debate.) Anyway, I think this is very tasty and I will use it for my basic recipe. I made it with potatoes that were already cooked, and I don't think the dish suffered. Also, I finished it off in the oven for a few minutes just to make sure the eggs on the top were cooked. I good, fast dinner with a salad and a glass of wine.

My husband and I thought this was great! (Unfortunately our three year old son refused to touch it, but that doesn't prove anything :)) I didn't have parsley and forgot the capers, but the frittata was delicious nonetheless. The only thing was that we found it to be enough only for two people. Dunno why it says it gives 4 portions. Maybe we eat too much?

Great frittata recipe. I make frittatas relatively often so, I am always looking for a new variation. This one was very good, very easy. I skipped the capers because I brought the frittata to a picnic and, it was still great. Will make again. One point of advice: do not burn the eggs. Cook on a low heat and take off the stove before you think they are done, they continue to cook. Similarly, I placed mine under the broiler at the end of the recipe for about a minute, it makes life much easier.

Amazing. And easy to make. My family and friends have enjoyed this many times at our table. Highly recommend it.

I used a carrot instead of a red pepper and thougt it tasted great. I like that it's a one frying pan dish, other recipes ask that the potatoes be boiled first.

I eliminated the red pepper and added some left over (already cooked) acorn squash. It added a smoother texture and a nice yellow color. I didn't use the capers, but I added about 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese. It was creamy and my husband loved it as a light dinner when paired with honey drizzled grilled pork chops and fresh pears. Like quiche, this dish really allows for you to be creative. Just be sure to use a REALLY non-stick skillet.

Just an all-around great recipe to which you can add your favorites. I added some basil, didn't use parsley and capers. It's a great dinner with a salad, great as left-overs the next day for lunch. Reheats great. I always cover and let cook over low about 5 minutes, then put under broiler to finish top. Gives good consistency throughout dish.

I am making thsi dish for Fathers' Day brunch tomorrow. I think I will omit the pepers since somepeople in our faily dislike them, but I like the basics of this recipe, you can really play around with various ingredients and get great dishs every time!

This is quite good. I went out the night before to purchase a red pepper, expressly for this recipe, but changed my mind and used fresh asparagus instead. I also added the last little bit of leftover ham I had in the fridge and only used 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Can't believe there's an argument about how 'authentic' it is! Good grief. It's called *cooking* people. Have fun!!

I say "frittata", and you say "torilla", you say "tortilla", and I say "fritatta", "tortilla" - "fritatta", "fritatta" - "tortilla", let's call the whole thing off! Bottom Line - this is a good dish, whether Italian or Spanish, and the joy of cooking is being able to experiment with different variations. If you like peppers, put 'em in. If you don't, leave 'em out. Enough said.

I liked this recipe, and will choose to use it as a basic Frittata receipe in the future. I might choose different vegtables.

To Noelle - guess you felt pretty stupid when you looked back on the recipe and reallized that it says "This classic egg and potato dish is called a tortilla in Spain."

After making this recipe, I would say it is like meatloaf-you can add different ingredients each time and it will still be good. Be careful not to add to many vegetables. I added too many sliced potatoes and it didn't have the omelette like appearance and egg flavor that it should have. Even then, it was still very good!

Did not try this specific recipe, so am mot rating it. However, I have been cooking for 30 years and have made many a frittata (my wife is Italian, as is frittata) No matter that this one is called "spanish", it's still frittata, and you can put whatever you want in it, including peppers.(No offense, you Spaniards out there!) Tip for those reviewers who had trouble dishing it up in one nice serving piece: When your frittata is near fully set in stovetop skillet, place it under the oven broiler (approx. 4 in. away from heat source) for a few minutes until slightly turning brown. Remove from oven, place your serving dish upside down over top of skillet, and invert skillet so that frittata comes out in one lovely circle unto serving dish. Try it. Only way to serve frittata.

I did not make this recipe, but I would like to carify something- For the reviewer down below, the recipe above says FRITTATA, not TORTILLA. A frittata is Italian and you can put in to the pan whatever darn well suits your taste at the moment. Yes, it does say Spanish but it also says frittata and peppers could work just fine. I personally reccomend something cooler for your temper.

This was a huge hit at our Easter Brunch. People had seconds and thirds. Also, if you get the chopping done the night before, preparation is a snap.

I learned to make tortilla from my Spanish stepmother and have become pretty good at it. I agree: no peppers for a true Spanish tortilla, but if it tastes good, what the heck. I really question using one potato and 2 T. oil with 6 eggs. I've always used about 5-6 potatoes (I make a BIG tortilla), deep fry the slices in batches using about a cup or more of oil, use a slotted spoon to transfer them to the beaten eggs, then let the mixture sit for about 15 minutes before returning to the skillet. I think you really need alot of oil in the potatoes to keep them from sticking. Also, I flip the whole thing halfway through cooking, so both sides brown. (Slide out of skillet onto a large platter, place skillet over tortilla then...FLIP! Takes some practice.) I like the caper idea though. I'll try that next time.

Having red bell pepper or any other pepper for that matter gives it a 0 fork. A spanish tortilla with pepper only means that whoever came up with the recipe is not spanish as I am. No, I haven't tried the recipe. It could be tasty but....no spanish.

I made this recipe for my boyfriend who lived in Spain for 10 years. He said it tasted okay, but I found it very hard to get it out of the skillet in one, nice cake like form (which is how he said it should look). I totally agree with the first review about baking it so it will set better - I'm going to do it like that next time.

I lived out of the US for many years and in the original version of this you bake it for about 10 minutes or until the mixture is set. You also do not have to combine the eggs & potatoes in a bowl but can just pour the eggs over the potato mixture. I noticed that it is missing one of the main ingredients - garlic. I add about 1t minced garlic. We love these on our meatless nights and the variations are as endless as your imagination.

Simple and hearty. Needs a sauce though - not sure what.
