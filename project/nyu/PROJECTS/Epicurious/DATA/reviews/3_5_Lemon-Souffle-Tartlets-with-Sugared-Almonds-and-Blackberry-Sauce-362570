This got rave reviews at my dinner party last night. I love that you can make it ahead and stick it in the freezer. I used unsalted butter rather than the margarine. You will have some curd leftover, and I had the souffle filling left over also because I used a smaller tartlet pan.

I appreciate this recipe is in honor of Hanukkah however can butter be substitued margarine?

Very elegant and good--and easy since it can be prepared ahead of time. I think I would use a bit more lemon zest and poke the crust so it doesn't shrink as much. I also had to watch the baking of the crust as it seemed to brown quickly, which made for a little tougher crust after the second baking, but the taste was delicious.

It was okay. I was worried that the cookie crust would be too hard to cut easily, but that was not a problem. My only criticisms are that the souffle was not lemony enough for my taste and that the portion size is too large - the tart shell should be smaller.

I made this for Christmas dinner - OMG, so good. I forgot the blackberry sauce and it was still fantastic. I made the tarts 3 days ahead, froze them and baked them before serving. It makes more lemon curd than you need for the filling.
