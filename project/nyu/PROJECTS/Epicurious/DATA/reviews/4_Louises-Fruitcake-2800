This is a great old-fashioned fruitcake. The only change I made was to include roughly chopped pecans in with the fruit, which adds a little more texture to the cake. Brings back memories of my Grandma's holiday treat.

Amazing! This cake was delicious!!! And super easy to make. I didn't have almonds so I just put an extra 1/2 cup of flour, I think it would have been better with the almonds but nevertheless it was delicious!

I've made this recipe for several years. It is very dense, and mostly fruit. The batter does nothing but bind the fruit together. It does not rise when baking, and its hard to tell when its done. Don't cook it too long.
