meh. kind of agree there are more interesting quick chicken recipes, though I did like being able to make this with next to nothing in the fridge.

What's not to like about this dish? Easy & tasty & inexpensive! Prepped it earlier in the day. Because my thighs weighed almost 4 lbs., I doubled the marinade (and used fresh oregano) & doubled the sauce (again with fresh oregano). Roasted potatoes & veggies alongside, and added a salad. Had friends over, and everyone enjoyed the meal.

Halved recipe for two, came out great. LOVE the crispy, flavorful skin. Don't skip the browning step!

This was a great easy recipe that can go with a variety of different side dishes. I served it with risotto and a caesar salad. The chicken skin gets nice and crunchy or can be removed altogether. Definitely will make it again.

This was my first time making chicken thighs, and though I followed the recipe exactly, I found it turned out very oily, but still delicious. Chicken was cooked perfectly - moist and tender. I was surprised though, that considering how much garlic and lemon was used, the flavor was not nearly as strong as I was expecting.. very very subtle

Excellent and super easy. The recipe is specific about using unsalted butter and reduced-sodium chicken broth. I recommend you take heed as the reduction process will intensify the flavors. I did this with skinless, boneless chicken breast and simply skipped the browning step.

This is an easy recipe, relatively quick to make, with ingredients I already had at home. It was satisfying and tasty, but not particularly delicious or remarkable. The chicken skin was nice, but the flesh itself lacked flavor. I don't think I'd bother making it again.

This was a really easy and fast recipe and turned out fantastic for a weeknight dinner. I used skinless, boneless thighs, and after browning in the pan put them into a baking dish with some par boiled fingerling potatoes and roasted them together with the sauce for the 20 minutes. Perfect.

This was delish! i used good ole kirkland boneless chicken breasts which i'll marinate alittle longer next time. also kept the crunchies (garlic) from the pan seared chicken in the broth/lemon reduction as it added flavor. about 20 minutes in the oven was just right for the whole breasts. served with the lemon roasted potatoes which were also yummy.

Very easy to make, and a super taste. It has become my 'company' recipe.

Turned out great--especially the leftovers that I'm eating right now! The only thing I'd do differently next time is use a pot that works on the stovetop and in the oven, for an easier cleanup. I also made an Orzo "risotto" recipe I found here to go along with it which was also great. And bonus, you can use some of the same ingredients from the citrus salad recipe.

Like other reviewers, I used chix breasts (what I had in the house) and marinated in the oil, garlic and lemon juice for an h our prior to cooking. Easy, moist and flavorful - great weeknight dinner and I will definitely make again.

This was delicious! I used split breasts instead of thighs (it's what I had on hand) and cooked it to 180° internal temp. The seasoning was perfect, and the chicken very juicy without being underdone. I will make this again for certain. Oh, and my kids liked this too -- were looking for more!

It was Ok. There are better easy recipes for chicken on this site.

We tried it with thighs this time, but my husband and I both prefer chicken breast so I think we'll try that next time. I'll also marinate the chicken for a bit. The chicken was great though, we both enjoyed it!

Wow, easy and delicious. I marinated for a couple hours and up the garlic. Used drumsticks. Simple and a crowd pleaser. Served with asparagus, cor on the cob, and roasted garlic potatoes from this site.

This chicken was delicious. I used boneless/skinless chicken thighs and they worked well. I will definitely make this again and often.

Yummy!! Quick, easy and delicious!!

Delicious and easy. I loved the brown bits of garlic in the bottom of the pan. If you use skinless chicken breasts, don't overcook them! Sauce is very buttery, so you can leave out that last tablespoon if you are watching your fat intake... still is great!

This is a very easy and flavorful recipe. I took the earlier advice and marinated the breasts and thighs in the oil garlic mixture for about 30 minutes. I served it at a small dinner with my aunt and then to 34 people at Rosh Hashanah. Outstanding!

Great lemony roasted flavour. Will definitely make again. Thumbs up from everyone - even the picky 15 year old.

I followed the recipe and both my wife and I thought it was wonderful. Next time I will try to brown the chicken well in advance leaving only the roasting until the end. Is there any reason this will not work? Also, any suggestions with resect to the skin sticking to the skillet? This created a slight problem for crispness, but it would be like using skinless thighs as many of the reviewers did. I would like to keep the skin and avoid the stickiness, if possible.

Absolutely Fantastic! It is an easy, delicious recipe. My family loved it!

This recipe is absolutely perfect as written. The bone-in, skin-on thighs (good quality chicken is important here) are a must as far as my family is concerned. Everyone loves the delicious, crispy skin that emerges from the oven a gorgeous, deep golden brown. Best part is once the chicken is in the oven I wipe the pan out and make Jamie Oliver's Simple Sauteed Zucchini with garlic, chile and lemon (Cook With Jamie). I also roast potato wedges in the oven while the chicken bakes and we have a really nice meal. Once I even prepared the Lemon Glazed Butter Cake from the same issue.

Not a big hit with my family. Will try again, but next time marinate longer as previous reviewer suggested. I served it with rice pilaf and roast carrots.

Used skinless boneless thighs and the flavor and texture were wonderful. Very easy dish. Do marinate the chicken a bit in the garlic mixture if you can.

This was excellent! I only had boneless skinless chicken breasts so that's what I used and it was still very moist and delicious. The whole family loved it!

I made this with boneless, skinless breasts and it was very good. It was quick and easy and I had all of the ingredients in my kitchen already, which is a big plus. I marinated the chicken in the garlic mixture for about an hour before I cooked it, for extra flavor. I only browned the chicken for 2-3 minutes per side and I cooked in in a 375F oven for about 25 minutes, basting occasionally. It was moist and flavorful and easy.

A simple recipe that yields extremely flavorful, tender chicken. Definitely use bone-in chicken thighs with skin... the crispy, garlicky skin was my favorite part of this dish. The sauce is VERY buttery and rich, reminiscent of Chicken Kiev.

This was extremely delicious; I'd have given it another half-fork were it possible (though didn't feel it went all the way to 4 "exceptional" forks). Like the Yuba City cook, I used boneless/skinless thighs -- and I still felt the required amounts of oil and butter were far too much. I only used 2T of vegetable oil in the coating and 1 T of butter in the broth-lemon reduction (but I left all the brown bits to scrape up -- yum). To brown the thighs -- remember, these were already swimming in the lemon juice-oil-garlic -- I simply used an oil spray and a good pan. Based on others' remarks, I also upped the lemon juice and broth amounts a bit -- and ended up with a perfect amount of sauce for my 6 thighs. YUM!

This was SO flavorful! I used chicken breast, but cut it into pieces before I cooked it. My husband doesn't usually like lemon, and he loved it. Next time I'll make more of a sauce and put it over rice.

Delicious, simple, and quick (not counting clean-up, for it does get messy). Even four year old devoured an entire thigh. [FYI, it also works if marjoram is substituted for the oregano.] Will be making this again. Hey, it has garlic and butter; what's not to love?

Was a hit. Made a roux and added chicken broth to make a sauce for those who liked sauce in our family. Was great and will probably try again. Only complaint was that there wasn't anywhere close to enough chicken based on recipe and we aren't big meat eaters!

Great easy dish. We used boneless thighs and breasts. Dusted them with bread crumbs to keep moist. Delicious...and easy (and cheap!!). What's better than that?!?!!

Rating: 4
This is a very yummy dish. I made it extra yummy by putting a very thick layer of my favorite veggies (broccoli, zucchini, onions, much....) and placed the chicken on top to cook. I then served it over brown rice. It was so good that I made it for lunch the next day for just myself!

Really good and quick. Used whole legs and maybe a bit more lemon juice. Great with garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus . . .

I opted to used skinless boneless chicken thighs instead of the bone in with skin. Using a high quality ovenproof non stick skillet it was not necessary to brown in butter, there was plenty of oil in the garlic mixture to brown with. I followed the rest of the recipe as written but added a splash of white wine to give the sauce a bit more interest. Big flavors and plenty of moisture with the accompanying sauce.

Absolutely delish! I LOVE garlic & lemon so I doubled them. I skinned my thighs and it came out well - I just rotated them in the sauce, which I doubled also. This will become a regular at my house.

A huge hit with everyone from my 8- yr-old son to my 81-yr-old uncle. Skin was perfect, flavors excellent. Upped the garlic slightly (we love it) and seasoned well, but stuck fairly close to the recipe. Easy to do, and even took a short break in between the browning and the baking (so can "do ahead" slightly). I would make extra, as that was the only complaint (no leftovers!)

Yummy! I pretty much doubled the garlic and the lemon, and it was terrific. The skin on the chicken came out beautiful.
