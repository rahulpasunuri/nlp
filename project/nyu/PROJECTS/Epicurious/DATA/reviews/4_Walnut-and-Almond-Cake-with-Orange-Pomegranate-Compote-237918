I haven't made this yet, but will do so this year for Seder. If you can't find matza meal (where do you live???) you can use more ground nuts or just grind up matza in a blender. Grind it REALLY fine! Also, please note that Ashkenazic Jews cannot use "vegetable oil" during Passover and so should either use cottonseed oil or olive oil (my choice). It adds a little savory edge that I really like.

If you cannot find matzo meal, and still make it for Passover, you can always use almond flour or ground almond meal

To Larryecollins: You could totally use mandarin oranges instead of slicing to save time. You would have to add a little OJ to the syrup. It would change the flavor a little, but I don't think people would complain!

I received many compliments on dessert. The pomegranate makes the syrup nicely tart. The only negative is the recipe requires lots of dishes.

Couldn't I use mandarin oranges instead of bothering with peeling and sectioning oranges? That seems the most time consuming part.

You COULD use plain breadcrumbs instead of matzo meal, but do note in that case it would NOT be fit for Passover.

Recipe looks really good. However, I can't find matzo meal anywhere. What could I use as a substitute?

The cake is very good and the sauce and compote add the necessary moisture that is usually missing from Passover cakes. However, while it tastes good it is a many step process to make this cake and can be very time intensive. Peeling the oranges takes a while - a long while. Also if you don't have juicy oranges the recipe does not specify how much juice you should be adding to the remaining syrup at the end of the recipe. Pouring off 3/4 of a cup of the syrup onto the cake is most of it not leaving you with a lot for the compote so I just guessed as to how much orange juice to add at that point. This would be a great cake to bring to someones home during Passover but not the cake you want to make if you are hosting and preparing the rest of the meal as well.

Why do they not have active time and total time to prepare at the start of their recipes?
