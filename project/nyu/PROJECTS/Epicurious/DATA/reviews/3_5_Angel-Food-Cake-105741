Followed directions exactly and it turned out great! Cooked for 40 min. but probably could have taken it out 5 minutes sooner. Only problem I can figure why others had their cake flop would be not beating the egg whites to the proper consistency.

I have never made an Angel Food Cake before, and chose this one. I did follow the other reviewers suggestions of cutting the confectioners suger down to 1/2 cup, other than that followed the recipe to the "T". It turned out great. Of course, my wife always thinks I'm nuts trying something out for the first time. You'd think after 26 years she'd have learned to have a little faith... The only issue I had was there was a little trouble getting it out of my pan. The sides pulled free, but the bottom stuck. When I did get it to pull free, it came out in one piece, i just had to help it a long a little more than i thought i would have to. It was nice as i was able to use my mom's pan from the 50's that I grew up watching her use so many times. A great recipe.

I gave this recipe two forks since I found it disappointing, but something I could work with. Firstly, my husband prefers savoury dishes, and I prefer sweet, so we generally strike a good compromise, but this was way too sweet for both of us. I like to do recipes as they're written first time around, so I didn't cut the sugar as other reviewers suggested, and now regret it. Secondly, the cake came out very tough; we're very experienced bakers, and the batter was very light, so it wasn't folding technique etc, rather, I think this recipe is incompatible with some newer ovens, notably self-cleaning ones. With our oven the bottom element is built in rather than exposed, so it has a very even heat throughout the oven - 350F was way too hot.

I've used this recipe several times and it has always turned out well. I have even made small mistakes in it and it still turned out well. Incredibly easy, and extraordinarily good.

I made cupcakes with this recipe -- 19 minutes baking time and they came out great. I didn't have cream of tartar, so I substituted the same amount of lemon juice to compensate -- it worked great. The only thing I would change is to add more vanilla -- 1 teaspoon didn't seem to add enough flavor.

This was my first time making angel food cake and this recipe was simple and delicious. I followed the recipe as is and it turned out wonderful. I was initially worried because past reviewers noted that it was on the sweeter side... which I found the cake on its own was. But I served it with no-sugar-added whipped cream and rather tart strawberries, it turned out to be the perfect sweet compliment!

It's all about the technique. I made this recipe about two weeks ago, with the tiny addition about about a tablespoon of fresh orange zest. Wow, it was incredible. Be very gentle when folding in the flour, and follow all the instructions precisely. Will definitely be using this one again and again.

It's turned out really light and airy(as most descriptions for Angel Food Cake go), and I love it . Made it for my mom's birthday :-)

this cake turned out good but I found it too sweet. It looked great and tasted good but everyone agreed it was too sweet so I'll look for another recipe that uses less sugar and wouldn't make this again.

this cake turned out great. imade it for my small family so i had lots of theftovers. I topped it with some whipped cream and fresh strawberries. Great idea for easter brunch, make french toast with slices of leftover angle food cake instead of bread. Top with leftover whipped cream and berries. Great dessert/breakfast!

In sticking to low fat desserts, I made another version of this cake. I grated a fresh coconut in my food processor and toasted 1/2 of it. I added the toasted coconut to the batter before adding flour and used very good vanilla and organic coconut flavorings. I stirred about 3-4 tablespoons of coconut puree from the processor and sifted 1 tablespoon of baking powder and folded in. The result was "Toasted Coconut Marshmallow Cake". It tastes just like a toasted coconut marshmallow. Great! Best low fat dessert ever.

I'm not an angel food fan, but this was pretty darn good. I added 1/2 tsp orange blossom water along with the vanilla and it gave it an interesting "something". Served with cherry merlot sauce and chantilly cream, it was really tasty.

I made this again--and it really is GOOD. It is better after 1 day. Wrap or keep in container. Very good indeed. So I am upping the rating to 4 forks.

I thought this recipe was good , but not OUTSTANDING. But good. Angel food cake is ,well...angel food cake. I ended up greasing the pan and did not cool on a bottleneck and it was fine. What I did to really bring the flavors out and make this a great dessert, I made a raspberry curd and topped with whipped cream. I had some fresh raspberries in the freezer from last summer. I whirled them in the processor for a minute and strained over a fine sieve to remove the seeds. I added about 1/2 cup sugar to the juice. Brought it to boil and cooked it until most of scum subsided. I thickened with a cornstarch and water solution. I frosted the cake with whipped cream and swirled the curd into the cream. I poured additional raspberry curd over each cut slice. Now that was OUTSTANDING. To make a decadent low fat dessert , just use Cool Whip. A big winner.

A quote from my picky husband who says I'm a great cook, but baking is my downfall: "This is the best angel food cake I've ever had"

Rating: 2
My beautiful cake just fell out of the pan onto the wine bottle, countertop and floor. It is ruined! So basically I would guess that it is a BAD idea to turn a hot cake upside down on a bottle. I am NOT a novice either... just never baked an angelfood. What a waste of an afternoon.

Fantastic taste and texture. I used a bundt pan as a substitute and did have trouble getting it out, but even though it put up a fight the cake was intact and not entirely destroyed upon eventual removal- only slight cosmetic damage. I used a coconut topping to disguise the damage (1/2 butter, 1/2 milk, 1/4 sugar, 1 1/3 cup coconut - warmed and drizzled over top), which was also fantastic with the cake.

For years I have made the angel food cake out of the Fanny Farmer cook book but I do believe this is a better cake.I have made this cake at least 10 time and will make it many more. Just for a change sometimes I use 1 teaspoon of almond extract. I have also used grated lemon peel. This is a yummy cake!!!

What a great cake. Very light and moist and turned out picture perfect. I would use a high grade vanilla to increase the flavor. It makes the difference.

I made this recipe when I had some egg whites left over from a brunch dish. What a mistake! I should have used one of the simple, classic recipes from an old cookbook (like Better Homes and Gardens). The addition of confectioners sugar only makes the cake too sweet and sticky. Sometimes you really shouldn't re-invent the wheel.

Rating: 2
I thought this was pretty good, but way too much sugar for my liking anyway. Yes, I would make this again but will use only about 3/4 to 1 cup of confectioners sugar and with some lemon zest as the previous reviewer suggested.

Rating: 3
Perfect Angelfood cake recipe! I did make a few additions, and I hate when people review a recipe that they significantly changed, but I think my changes were still following the intent of this recipe. I used 1/2 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp of lemon juice, plus zest from one lemon and 1 tbsp poppy seeds. Then I iced with leftover icing from Epicurious' LEMON LAYER CAKE WITH LEMON CURD AND MASCARPONE and topped with fresh sliced strawberries. Delicious! I will certainly make this again, and probably also try other variations like orange.

I'm more of bread baker than a cake baker. This was my first angel food cake from scratch and it was perfect! I used a hand mixer rather than a standing mixer (which can be impractical in certain Manhattan apartments!), and had no problem. I followed the directions exactly; next time I may reduce the granulated sugar as suggested by some other reviewers. Can't wait to make it again. I tried making creme anglaise with the yolks, but came out with something more akin to sweet scrambled eggs...yuck! :)

First time making an angel food cake from scratch and it turned out beautifully and here's the best part. I took a chance and used a bundt pan! I never would have, based on an early experience in my just-married days with a boxed angel food cake, but encouraged by another cook's use of it, i tried and it worked fine. One thing I did was take other's suggestions to cut the sugar and I only added 3/4 cup and my first reaction when I took a bite was that the cake was not very sweet. So next time I make this I will use the full cup.

easy and yummy! you're supposed to cool the cake by turning the pan upside down and resting the tube on a long neck bottle--my mom always used a beer bottle ;)

To the cooks from Germany and British Columbia, a. the cake fell out of the pan because it didn't cook quite long enough. I learned that the hard way, too. and b. try making lemon or lime curd out of the extra egg yolks. It would go really good with the cake.

Rating: 4
Mmmmmmm! I followed the suggestions of reducing the granulated sugar to 1/2, and the cake tastes heavenly. I used an angel food cake pan with a removable bottom, and for the life of me I had no idea what "inverting the cake on a bottle" meant. The pan has a funnel - why do you need a bottle? Very confused, I was. I just turned it upside down supported by some knives to give it air for cooling. Have no idea if that was right or not. But the cake is yummy!

this cake rocks! i made it on the fly and turned out perfectly. i even baked it in a springform pan and it was great, perfect texture. yes, reduce the sugar. someone asked what to do with all the egg yolks. here's what i did: i made lemon curd mousse which was very easy and delicious and served it with the cake, topped with tart blueberry sauce. so good!

Rating: 3
assuming you have a tube pan, this is pretty easy. i too vote for a reduction of granulated sugar (i used 3/4 cup this time, but next time i will use 1/2 cup). About texture: it was almost right, but still slightly dense. Possible solutions are to beat egg whites longer and/or to fold dry ingredients in with as few strokes as possible. About flavor: again, almost right, but a bit flour-like on day 1. it got better on day 2.

This was a great recipe,easy to follow. I took other reviewers advice and cut back on the granulated sugar. Anyone have any ideas on what to do with all the yolks?

HELP!!!!!! What happened???? The cake baked beautifully. High and golden brown. Took it out of the over and turned it on the wine bottle. It fell out of the pan and shrunk together. Most amazing sight to watch and of course I was close to tears!!! Could there be too much sugar?????. Give me your feedback. Colleen

My boyfriend said this was "like eating a cloud". It IS really good, simple but clear directions, easy to make. I used egg whites that had been accumulating in my freezer, 3-4 months old, and if there was any loss in quality I didn't notice. I used that really good vanilla extract from Mexico and it was delicious. I'm sure that almond or any other flavor extract would be good, too, or perhaps about 1/3 C Droste chocolate sifted in? Mmmmm. Highly recommend this recipe.

Being fond of rich, eggy concoctions, I have a plastic container in my freezer accumulating excess whites. What a wonderful way to use them! I loved the texture of this cake, and the beautiful golden crown which rose above the edge of my makeshift angel food cake pan (a bundt pan). Next time I will try different flavored extracts.

Rating: 4
Clear and concise directions with this recipe are very helpful, to the novice baker as well as the well practiced chef. I found a few adjustments that made this recipe exceptional in it's results: addition of 1/2 tsp. almond extract and 1 Tblsp. water, to be added at the beginning of whipping the egg whites. In a previous review I read of this recipe it noted a suggestion of reducing the granulated sugar by half. I used a reduction of 25%, to 3/4 cup, to be the right balance. Why would anybody want to purchase a store bought angel food cake again? I doubt I will again. Forks up!

Let's face it, angel food cake is not to die for--but it can be delicious, and this recipie is just that. I thought the texture was surprisingly light and melt-in-your-mouth (much, much better than store-bought, styrofoam-like cakes I have bought). I was trying to use up some egg whites I had, and I added reconstituted dried egg whites to make up the rest--worked just great. Also, I added the zest of one lemon and sprinkle some raw sugar on the top before baking for a little interest. I was happy with the results.

Finally! An angel food cake recipe that works well! I've made several before and they either fell, didn't brown well, or tasted like styrofoam. This one bakes up high, browns nicely on the sides as well as the top, and tastes delicious. Great recipe.

While the use of powdered sugar is a good one, there is then too much granulated sugar. The whole taste is sugar. Next time I will cut the granulated sugar to 1/2 cup and may add a little almond extract.

This was absolutely delicious. I served it with fresh berries and creme anglaise. Our guests loved it -- and it really was delicious.

Most angels are similar, but I found the ratio of 1 & 1/2 powdered sugar, 1 & 1/2 egg whites and 1 flour to be perfect. Also, try using different extracts like orange or almond.
