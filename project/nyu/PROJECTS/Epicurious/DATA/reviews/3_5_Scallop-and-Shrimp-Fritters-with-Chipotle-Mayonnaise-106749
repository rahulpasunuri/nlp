Wow...what a mess, and I'm talking about the finished product. Way too much liquid to hold together properly and the taste was bland at best. Not work the time or expense.

This was totally bland, and really a mess. The batter for the patties was so runny that they didn't firm-up at all, and they brooke apart in the oil. It was a total mess. I don't even know what would improve it.

Another winner! This sounds weird and is kinda messy, but worth the mess! My husband and I both loved them and my daughters, who are not crazy about scallops, liked them too. The sauce is wonderful and in a pinch you can use chipotle powder, but use the canned if you have access to them! The sauce is a real treat used for shrimp cocktail too.

I used a pound of scallops, no shrimp, added a few drops of chipotle hot sauce and coated in panko before frying. I added a couple Tablespoons of sour cream to the mayonnaise and used fresh lime juice instead of lemon (I have a lime tree). This recipe was a big hit!

i didnt follow the recipe fully [i put the shrimp in with the scallops and pulsed them all together and i also did not use the heavy cream used a bit of skim milk] I just quickly sauted them with a drop of oil in the pan and then baked them in the oven for about 15-20 mins. They came out really good. I did not try the mayo i just used some mango peach salsa instead.

This was quite tasty! I did follow the recipe exactly and had no troubles except I made the fritters too large first batch. But after I figured it out, awesome resuts! 2 Tbs. per fritter is about right. And I agree, the Japanese bread crumbs are wonderful!

This was quick and easy and had a nice flavor. The mayo was great and really made the dish. Also, the Panko really made the difference, so make sure to use it. I forgot to add the cream and it was still wonderful.

This is a great dish. It was simple to prepare with fabulous results. I did not place on wax paper. I just moved fast and dredged the fritter in the panko breadcrumbs and immediately placed it in the skillet. This worked well for me

Although I balk at the thought of subjecting beautiful scallops to the Cuisinart, the end does justify the means. These were outstanding. I followed the recipe exactly, carefully drying the scallops and shrimp, rolling in panko then chilling the formed patties well. Ended up with 10 patties which did not fall apart. The chipotle mayo was key. I will make this many times.

Excellent!! Followed the directions to a T. So easy,,,,great appetizer or main course. Make sure you dry the scallops and shrimp very well.

Awesome. Followed tips below on draining shrimp and scallops very well, and also patted dry with paper towels. Concerned about them falling apart, I spread circles of bread crumbs (I used panka) directly on wax paper and formed fritters here. I then cut the wax paper into squares around each fritter so I could individually slip them into the pan. This way I never had to handle them until it was time to flip. (Careful of grease splatter though!) Good tip on making two strenghts of mayo - my girlfriend appreciated it!

I, too, made these appetizer-sized to accompany Shrimp in Mojo de Ajo (garlic butter)They were incredible! I used a bit more shallot and added about 1 TB of minced onion and a little chiffonaded parsley. I also used panko crumbs, thanks to the other reviewer's hints. I drained the scallops and shrimp very well before proceeding and after 15 minutes or so in the fridge, the mixture was thick enough to coat. I used a portion scoop to put them in the crumbs, then scooped the crumbs over the top so as not to have to turn them. They were delicate, but not impossible to work with. The taste of these fritters was totally worth it and they're not really much work at all with the food processor. I made two versions of the mayo because I had guests that don't eat a lot of chile. I preferred the full-flavor one, but it IS spicy. I used 1/4 of the chiles and more adobo for the mild version and the chipotle flavor was noticeabe but there was only a hint of heat. My guests raved and fought over the last fritter. I rarely give 4 forks to anything, but you really HAVE to try these!

I made these as an hors d'oeurve: baked on a buttered sheet pan and made them mini-scallop/shrimp cakes. Passed with the chipolte mayo. Everyone raved.

I tried this recipe because of the rave reviews. What I got was a mushy mess. The mixture seemed wet and very soft.When I put the patties into the oil, they fell apart. What did I do wrong?

Great recipe! I had serious doubts about blending beautiful scallops but the end result made me glad I took that leap of faith. I dropped the spoonfuls of scallop mixture on top of the crumbs and covered with more crumbs - made it easier to form the fritters. I also substituted panko and loved the crunch.

delicious,and such a wonderful texture.

Definitely use the panko batter, very light and crispy. And since the inside is all seafood, it's dense.... really good.

The mixture was rather wet. Chilling it a little in the freezer helped firm it up enough to make the patties -- think drop biscuits. Use a deft touch to get the crumbs to coat it and all will be well. All in all, though, these turned out great and the chipotle mayonnaise was a great sauce. I served it with a Caesar salad made with chili-spiked croutons. Great combo for a hot night!

Wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly as written, and was very pleased with the results. My husband declared these fritters his new favorite dinner. Deveining the shrimp is a bit time consuming, but with two people working the dish is easy and reasonably quick to make. Would be great with a vinegary slaw to contrast the creaminess of the fritters and mayonnaise.

Very tasty, and quite easy as well. We substituted panko (japanese breadcrumbs) for a lighter, crunchier fritter. Also, the mixture was a bit too wet to form without adding some breadcrumbs to the mixture. Reheated well too, in frying pan with a little oil. Overall a great dish.
