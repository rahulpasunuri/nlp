Great recipe. The leeks are such a great addition. I used 2 very large cloves of garlic and the flavor doesn't really come through so you could use more. I mashed the potatoes with a hand mixer. I don't have a ricer.

This has become a Thanksgiving staple since it was 1st run in 1990. Why? It is delicious, easy & you can prepare it in advance - which is essential on such a big food day!

Good easy recipe. If I make it again, I would add more garlic. There just was not enough garlic flavor for us, but the addition of leeks to basic mashed potatoes was a good idea. The consistency (the amount of butter and milk) was just right.

Used local, organic potatoes, leeks, garlic and butter - prepared just as written less one change: simply mashed the garlic and potatoes together with a plain ol' masher. Result: PERFECTION.

This was an excellent side dish with my Salt Crusted Standing Rib Roast. It was the only side dish with no leftovers!
