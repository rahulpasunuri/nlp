Excellent recipe. The orange-almond batter is fantastic. The only thing I changed was the frosting, which I made from 330g chocolate (65%), 270ml whipping cream and 70g butter.

Sunday was our daughter's 50th birthday. I pulled out all the stops and made a "real" birthday cake. I hadn't made an American-type cake, the kind with baking powder, in years and years. 4 stars for the cake, 3 for the icing, 2 for the combination. If I make this again, I'd make it as a single layer cake with just a dusting of powdered sugar. The cake itself was delicious, moist, wonderful flavor. But the chocolate icing was almost like a melted candy bar. It was so rich, and so strongly chocolate that it overpowered the cake. And the recipe made twice as much icing as needed. I could have frosted a Volkswagen.

I love to cook, hate to bake. So, when my mom turned 70 and I offered to make a cake, I regretted it right away. However, after reading reviews of this cake, I thought I'd give it a try. It was fabulous, and very easy to make. I will make this the next time I foolishly offer to make the cake! Delicious, and a hit with everyone. Frosting did take about 15-20 minutes longer to finish, and boy was it worth it!

This was good, but not great. I would have like even more orange flavor. Also, the icing never set up for me (even after refrigerating overnight) and it slid down to a thicker pool at the base of the cake. That said, I liked the texture of the almonds.

This is a GREAT cake, easy to make, and unique, too. The combo of chocolate, orange and almonds is delicious. The almonds lend a nice crunchy texture, and the orange juice reduction helps keep the cake moist. It is a perfect combo of lightness and richness. I will never use another chocolate ganache frosting recipe again, since this was so easy with great results. I made the following adjustments: I reduced the recipe amounts by 1/3 (you can go to http://www.fruitfromwashington.com/Recipes/scale/recipeconversions.php to convert the amounts) so that I could use 2 8 pans instead of 3 9 pans. I sliced the two layers in half lengthwise, so that I would have 4 thin layers (it looked like a real European torte). I added a TBSP of Grand Mariner to the OJ reduction. I also used parchment rounds in the pan with flour/canola spray so it would come out clean. For garnish, I had a great idea to get one of those chocolate oranges that come apart in slices, but Trader Joes didnt have that, so I bought dried orange slices and halved them. I placed them around the sides of the cake, and I alternated whole almonds and thin slices of TJs dark chocolate orange sticks (little natural jelly candies) so they were about the same size as an almond around the top. I used orange BDay candles too. Beautiful!

This cake was FANTASTIC! I only gave it 3 stars because I didn't follow the recipe to the letter. I couldn't find whole almonds, so I used sliced, and because I made it in the form of a bundt, I used a chocolate glaze instead of the frosting. But It was great! I squeezed fresh orange juice from the oranges (it only took 2 for me) I got the zest from and made the syrup with it. I will absolutely make it again, and next time, I'll do the layers and try the frosting. The only "complaint" was that my husband wanted more chocolate in each bite.

This is an excellent choice for a birthday cake. I thought the combination of orange-almond and chocolate looked fabulous. Unfortunately, I'm not the biggest fan of citrus-flavored cakes so I probably won't be making this again. For those who do like orange, this cake was VERY easy to make. The frosting for this recipe is also EXCELLENT, although it is quite heavy. After making the frosting, it takes quite awhile to thicken. I left it in the refrigerator overnight, and to my dismay it got quite hard. I had to leave it out a few hours in order for it to soften. I should have listened to other reviewers and stuck it in the freezer for a few minutes.

This tasty cake exceeded the expectations I had after reading the reviews here on this site. While I didn't make the cake myself (my boyfriend made it for me for my birthday), I assisted and provided an enthusiastic cheering section while I watched the cake take shape. From my experience with other cake recipes, I did not feel that this cake took exceptionally long or an inordinate amount of effort to make. The cake layers turned out beautifully, and the orange juice syrup was a nice touch to bring out the orange flavor and add more moistness to the cake. As noted in previous reviews, we had trouble getting the icing to set up, but putting it in the freezer did the trick. We are dark chocolate lovers, but felt that the cake was the true highlight of this dessert. Next time we make it, we are considering only using the icing between the layers so it is not so overpowering. Either way, this cake is excellent, and I can't wait until next year's birthday so I can have it again!

This is a fabulous cake!! I made it for a birthday and it was a huge hit. I tried the Grand Marnier idea and the cake was moist and the orange flavor just perfect. I made the layers and the frosting the day before. The next day, afterletting the frosting come to room temperature, I assembled the cake. Superb! Can't wait to make it again.

I am so glad I tried this recipe! This is an absolutely spectacular cake. Orange and chocolate are a wonderful combination and this cake certainly capitalizes on that flavor. This cake tastes almost like a truffle. I found the the recipe to be an easy one and I had no trouble w/ the frosting. I did cool the frosting in the freezer and it was ready in about 35 minutes. If you love chocolate and orange together -- try this recipe!

This recipe took more than 2 hours to prepare and was definitely disappointing. Cake looked great but was too rich. The cake itself was very coarse and had a very strong orange flavor - almost overpowering. The chocolate frosting was very rich and too chocolate-y for my taste. None of my guests finished their piece.

Cake was good. Frosting was excellent. Next time I would brush the layers with a Grand Marnier syrup instead of the orange juice. A note for the cooks who complained about the length of time it took the frosting to reach a spreadable consistency: an easy way to do it in a timely manner is to hand whisk the frosting over a bowl of ice water. Mine was ready in about 15-20 minutes.

This cake was really good...for adults. My kids were completely unimpressed. The best part is the frosting. It does take longer to set up than stated in the recipe but, once it does, it goes on the cake beautifully and tastes wonderful (if you like dark chocolate.

Delicious, beautiful and special. Have made several times and always greeted with rave reviews. A couple of real dessert-lovers said it was the best cake they have ever eaten! Freezes well.

I had a bad experience with this recipe. The cake layers took much longer than 25 minutes to bake, and they stuck terribly in the pans (yes, they were greased & floured). I would recommend lining your pans with greased & floured waxed paper if you want to bake this one. The frosting took MUCH longer than 45 minutes to cool, after refrigerating it for 1-1/2 hours I was forced to improvise & thicken it with confectioner's sugar.

Cake had a great, and very distinctive flavor. Icing took much more than 45 minutes to set.

This cake was great for my mother's birthday. It is definately an adult cake reminiscent of the European cakes we grew up with. We particularly liked that it was not terribly sweet. The frosting recipe yields much more than is needed. I froze half of it for later use.
