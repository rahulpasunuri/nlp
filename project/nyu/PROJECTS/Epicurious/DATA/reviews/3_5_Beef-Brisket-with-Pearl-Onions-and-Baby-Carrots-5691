This turned out to be somewhat tasteless. I prefer recipes that have tomato sauce in it or beer added for a more robust stronger flavor.

I did not reduce the wine mixure all that much. I pretty much just brought it to a full boil and then put it over the meat. I also roasted the meat at 275 for 5 hours as I prefer low and slow. Then I let it rest while I strained all of the veggies out. Then sliced the meat and poured the juice over it and refrigerated it over night. The next day I took 1 lb of baby carrots and 1 lb of small white potatoes and put them in the pan and covered it for 2 more hours at 275 again. I know its done when the veggies are soft. Once complete I reduced the juice some more and added some rue to make a gravy. I have made this several times and everyone loves it. There are never leftovers.

This recipe is great! We cooked the 5lb piece of meat at 350 and it was perfect. Plenty of sauce and it served 6 guests with a large bowl of leftovers. We added red potatoes to the roasting pan and Everyone enjoyed it. Serve with French bread and red wine!

I agree with the cook from Vienna, Virginia. I too lowered the temp to 350 degrees and did not reduce with wine mixture. It reduced nicely in the oven, and I added more wine/chix stock as it cooked away. When I finished and sliced the meat, I ended up reducing the sauce/gravy a bit in a saucepan, just to thicken it a bit, then added pearl onions and carrots. OH, SO TENDER! A keeper.

Based on other people's comments, I decided to try this in the slow cooker for 8 hrs instead of a proper braise. I also doubled the carrots and celery because I like the little vegetable bits. The meat turned out very tender, and the flavor was quite nice. The brisket was still holding together but pulled away ever so easily with the touch of a fork.

I've made this twice, both times I lowered the temp to 350. There's just no way 450 is feasible. Also, I didn't see the need to make a reduction for something that's going to cook for 4 hours, thus, making a reduction anyway! I just dumped in the wine, carrots, onions, and thyme in with the brisket. After that reduced I started adding in a half wine/half broth mixture. It tasted exactly the same as when I bothered to make the reduction the first time I tried this recipe.

Sorry if this prints twice... there may be a glitch.. I've tried the recipe twice and cut temp way down both times as sauce in pan had just about evaporated. Had to add another two cups of water. Don't know how others could have cooked it the whole time at 450. This must be an error. (Does anyone check the recipes or comments after they are posted?) That having been said... It does make a lovely sauce, the meat is tender, and our guests loved it. Maybe I'll try Wolfgang's recipe on this site to compare.

I took heed about the temp and the sauce not being enough from other reviews, so I covered it half the cooking time and it was just right, with plenty of sauce for yummy leftovers. The original sauce almost covered the meat in the pan and it cooked down some, but just right. Next time I will let it cook even longer for even more tenderness.

I thought the wine sauce was great, however cooking it uncovered, you would need to make extra for basting.

This is the best dish!!! I have actually turned this into my Corned Beef & Cabbage recipe, by accidentally replacing the beef brisket the first time I made it!!! It is the best!

A very elegant dish, for a very special evening. To roast the brisket you must make sure you use the right size roasting pan; you want to make sure the sauce is 2/3's full in the roasting pan. I also lowerd the temp after an hour to 400 degress.

I have made a lot of brisket and this one is now on the top of my list. It was wonderful. Of course, it helps to have a good piece of meat. My Kosher butcher gave me a fabulous piece of 1st cut and I only had to cook it 3 hours. And I had plenty of sauce.

This recipe is excellent if you double the amount of cooking time (and the amount of sauce). The beef will come out much more tender that way!

I will never eat meat for philosophical reasons except for this recipe, which infused new meaning to my life.

I was very doubtful about this recipe while it was cooking. Turned out much better than expected. The sauce was GREAT!! After I strained the juice from the vegs, I used the vegs as a side dish, which I loved. Not sure if I will try this again. Only if I have a beef brisket and no other recipe.

I have made this recipe twice and we love it. But the instructions say to roast this at 450*, uncovered for 3 1/5 hours is pretty high for such a long time. I run out of sauce at 2 1/5 hours. Am I missing something in the instructions? The other brisket recipes instruct 325* - 350*, covered for 3 1/2 hours.

I thought this was a lot (a whole lot) of work for a dish that was just okay. I don't mind putting in the hours, but I expect the result to be "beyond compare" or at least "delicious. This was good, but not worth the effort and expense. Also thought the recipe itself was ambiguious. A large roasting pan, 2/3 full of cooking sauce, doesn' tell you whether to cover the brisket or not. My roasting pan was very large. (Next smaller was too small for 5 lb brisket.

An excellent dish and wonderful alternative to the standard corned beef and cabbage.

I used bottom round since I couldn't get brisket at my butcher's. Part of a buffet and everyone loved it! I skipped the carrots and onions and roasted them separately with other root vegetables for a side dish. Excellent!

Have made this dish several times, and always with rave reviews. I usually make roasted garlic mashed potatoes to go with the red wine sauce that is just out of this world!

My wife loved this dish! I did alter it slightly, I added the pearl onions and baby carrots appx. 45 minutes before the meat was done. This is a great dish if you have a crowd coming over.

This is a wonderful dish to serve for a crowd. The fact that it can be prepared ahead makes it very easy to prepare.
