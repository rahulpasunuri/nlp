Fantastic. I made with 1cp coconut milk and 1.5 cups whole milk because heavy cream is outrageously expensive here. I let it reduce much longer than the recipe called for, but I imagine it came out just as thick as it would have using heavy cream.

Wow! This sauce is fabulous. Makes enough for serveral meals as it's very rich and has quite a bite (but that may be from the brand of curry paste I used). I usually stop reading when a recipe calls for more than a tsp of heavy cream, but I made an exception in this case and I'm glad I did.

This sauce is delicious with no changes to the recipe. Use a nice fresh piece of lemongrass and a good curry paste. I used Maesri green curry paste from the Asian market. I was also patient in allowing the sauce to reduce and thicken so it could absorb the ginger and lemongrass flavors. Don't forget the salt and pepper. It's wonderful - I could eat it by the spoonfuls!

The green curry pasted added nice heat, but I thought it needed more flavor. It could have been the brand of curry I used. Anyway, I added fresh basil and cilantro after I tasted the finished product and was very happy with the result. Used it on Halibut served over rice with lemongrass and green onion. Perfect!

Delicious! I used red curry paste instead of green. It was great!

I had a serendipitous experience making this recipe (to go with the sake kasu-marinated sea bass). My guests for this dinner do not eat any animal products, so the cream would not work. Since I had the other ingredients anyway, I decided to try making the sauce with SOY MILK (!) and if it didn't turn out well, I planned to serve the fish without the sauce. Well, the sauce came out great - very flavorful and not as overly rich as I believe it would have been with all that cream. The mild soy flavor of the soy milk blended right in with the other Asian flavors, and I was able to reduce the sauce very easily with no curdling of the soy milk. I will definitely use the soy milk every time I make this dish.

Very rich and tasty. Worth that splurge of 2 cups of heavy cream! I mixed it with snow peas, baby bok choy and shrimp. Delectable and a snap to prepare.
