Did not use the prunes but added rosemary to the sauce, which was fantastic. This was surprisingly good and fast.

Excellent recipe and the de-glazing of the pan helps to keep those juices together. I'm not sure why the recipe calls for the mashing of the prunes with a fork towards the end.

I'm not one for following recipes to a T, and this was no different. Fortunately, it turned out great. I've prepared this three times already and all my substitutions and lazy omissions still made for flavorful meals. I've used cognac instead of brandy, golden raisins or dried cherries in lieu of plums, and I've never bothered to stir in chicken broth because I didn't think it needed more salt. It's extra delicious with a little extra butter and cognac. I'll be trying this with pork next.

We are not fans of lamb shoulder chops but I tried this recipe to see if they would appeal to us with this preparation. The sauce was very easy and delicious. I will definitely make it again, however I think I will use it over loin chops rather than the lamb shoulder chops. It might be a good sauce to pair with pork loin chops too!

The sauce was no trouble to make... unless you're lazy. This is a good recipe.

This just didn't work for me. The sauce, for all the trouble of making it, was merely "OK" and made no connection with the lamb -- they did not enhance each other. I do like lamb shoulder chops, which were delicious just on their own with salt and pepper. In the future, I'd just broil the lamb. That's much less messy then pan frying.

any suggesetions for substitute instead of the brandy? apple juice, maybe?

The sauce is very very good and quick to make. This cut of lamb is very hard to eat, though. Lots of connective tissue to work around. The sauce is a keeper. Will try it with loin chops or leg next time.

This was excellent and easy. My husband loved the sauce.

I made this tonight for my husband and me. It was quick and very tasty! My husband went back for just the sauce over the suggested noodles.

Made this tonight for dinner with my wife - comes together very quickily - good flavor - served with wilted spinach with garlic - added a little cider vinegar to spinach. Nice, quick meal.
