I was so happy to find this recipe on Epicurious. My husband & I used to frequent Brew Moon in Cambridge and we always ordered the beer crackers. To answer Christine's question, there is no beer in the beer crackers - they are meant to accompany beer. Fabulous with a nice strong ale.

Fabulous!! I have made this recipe a few times and it's one one of my favorite appetizers to make. It's easy and a little different tasting. Everything blends together very well and it's very tasty. I make a big bag of the cheese mixture and keep it in my freezer just in case I have some pop in visitors I am all set to go! It's a big hit. (sometimes, I spread the mixture on flat bread and it works out great)

Just looking for crackers recipes, but to the question about a thinner cracker try chilling the dough then run it through a pasta maker. We have done this with great success with other cracker recipes (but do watch them in your oven so as not to burn them to cripy critters!).

Where is the beer in the beer crackers?

Excellent recipe. My guests loved it. It makes a lot of crackers. To the reviewer who wanted to know how to roll the crackers thin enough, try doing the final rolling on the cookie sheet itself. Also if you hold the rolled out dough vertically, it stretches out more. I used different cheeses and varied the ingredients, but it was best with a strong cheese, onions and garlic.

Hubby loved these, although I didn't think they stayed crisp at all the following day. Better to eat them immediately. Great for football parties.

Delicious. Had a little trouble getting the dough a thin as I would have liked. Any hints? Regardsless, they were a hit and I'm trying them again for an up=coming party.
