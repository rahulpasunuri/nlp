i really loved your recipe for grape jam it turned out great but i have a question why cant you take the whole grape and put in a blender to save the hassle of pealing the grapes ps the jam turned out great

I successfully made this without slipping the skins off. It was very time consuming and not necessary. Instead, I put everything together (grapes, sugar, and lemon juice) in a large stock pot and used a potato masher to to smoosh the grapes. It worked well. If you have an immersion stick blender, that will also help break down the skins ever further. Follow the recipe for the remaining steps. This cuts down your work considerably and I can't tell a difference in taste. I also cut the sugar by about 10% and added a little extra lemon. In total, I made 50 pounds. YUM! Do not double the recipe, it won't work.

Just finished making 6 batches from my garden's concord grapes and plan to make more. DO NOT double the recipe. It won't work. Alternatively, you can have several staggered batches going at on at the same time. Slipping the skins off is the most time consuming, so I'd like to experiment with either pulsing the grapes in a food processor or just cooking them whole and see if that works.

The jam came out fantastic! Made it with a grated apple and a bit of sage as other reviewers suggested. Just got more grapes for another batch.

I made this recipe with Muscadine grapes, followed the instructions and it turned out perfectly.I don't know how concord grapes are, but Muscadines are very easy to peel, you just squeeze one end and the flesh bursts out the other. I have sage in my garden, so i through in a couple of leaves for added dimension. I will definitely be making this again.

This recipe is time consuming. Instead of slipping the skins by hand I used the plastic blade on my food processer to do the job ( I had read about this technique). The balance of the recipe was easy, and the jam is yummy

I made this jam last year, and although it took several hours to set, it was so good that I saved the recipe to use again. I think I figured out the problem with it though--there are two kinds of concord grapes, Eastern and Western. Eastern Concords have more natural pectin than Western Concords (or so I read) so those of us on the west coast getting poor results...that's why, we just need to add pectin. I'm going to try adding a grated apple or two to my jam this year to add the pectin naturally.

This took a lot longer than I expected, as I had to cook down the grapes to make the sauce. Then it took what seemed forever to thicken, if it did at all. But the flavor was wonderful!

I saw Concord grapes in the market and had to make jelly from them! I halved the sugar and did 1 1/2 times the amount of lemon - the extra citrus speeded up the jelling process. I even added a sage leaf at the end to counteract some of the tartness. From start to finish I had everything jarred in little over an hour. Great fall recipe!

yummy. mine had a bit of a burnt taste, from boiling too long perhaps, but that is definitely a user error. however, they could have given a little bit more guidance in the recipe. this was my first jelly ever, though. make a small batch and don't deal with all the sterilizing/canning!

This was wonderful, used a combination of Concord and Niagara grapes, and the ratios here worked; did not, go to the trouble of separating the skins from the grapes, and the results were fabulous anyway.

I had a hard time getting it to thicken. I ended up having the final simmer (to thicken) taking over 2.5 hours. In fact, it was getting really late and I wanted to can it, so I just finished it. This morning it is like slightly thin fruit spread. I remember my Grandma's being thicker. I have no idea why it wouldn't thicken. One thing I would change is that it tastes slightly like the seeds. I think maybe I cooked it too long the first time and that allowed the seeds to impart their flavor. It's kind of a sharp, woody undertone that I wish I could get rid of next time. I didn't crush the seeds in my food mill, so over-simmering the grapes with the seeds is the only thing I can think of. I had 7 pounds of grapes, so I scaled everything up and ended up with 4.5 pints.

I've made this two summers in a row now. Be sure to not let the jam get away from you, it can go from perfect to burnt pretty quick if you're not stirring and some bits get stuck on the bottom of your pan. I was really stoked to have made my own grape jam!

This was my very first time making jam from our vine. I changed it to 1/4 cup lemon juice and on third batch added 1/4 c light corn syrup at reload and 1/3 c after 10 min boil; way better. also reduced longer at higher temp. all and all i appreciated the fact it told me how to step by step!

The flavor is great but my jam came out runny. :(

I loved this recipe - it was the first time I've made jam, and it was a huge hit! Will definitely do it again.

Yes, but I reserve the skins and cook them minimally with sugar because I like more texture and the jam doesn't taste so cooked this way. In answer to the above question, if you use a chinoise instead of a food mill, you can avoid crushing the seeds and the possible woody taste.

I just have a question. What happens to the seeds? I think I have tried to use a food mill with Concord grapes before, and could hear them crunching in the mill. Thought they were passing through the mill. And seeding them by hand is so time-consuming. Maybe I need to give the mill another try. What works best?

This recipe takes a bit of time to make, but the taste is worth it. My grandchildren loved helping me make it.
