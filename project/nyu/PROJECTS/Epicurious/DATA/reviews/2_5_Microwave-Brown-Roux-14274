I love using roux in cooking, but hate the process of making it. This is a great alternative to the old fashioned way and I think the results are almost as good. I have a faster microwave than average so I decreased the power and used 1 minute intervals.

Unless I needed dark roux FAST, I'd just do it in the oven. An hour or so at 300, stirring every twenty minutes or whenever I think of it, is not that big a deal.

I followed the directions as written. After about 8 minutes of cooking, I started using the 70% setting on my 1200 watt microwave, as the roux seemed to be darkening unevenly. I have a turntable in my mocrowave, I think that it's essential.

Followed the directions to the letter, using a very small, low-power microwave. The roux was burned by 6 minutes in. If you try it, I'd recommend whisking every 15 or 30 seconds and see if that helps. Also, be ready to do it the old-fashioned way instead!
