My mother is from Quebec, and we always ate poutine at restaurants whenever we'd visit. As to the cook who asked what would be authentic, unfortuantely, the type of cheese used in Canada can only be purchased in canada and England, due to FDA restrictions on dairy exports, which I believe has something to do with mad cow (as there was an outbreak in the 70s). I actually learned all this while visiting a cheese factory in Quebec, because the type they use is so tasty that we used to buy it in mass quantities to take home with us on every visit. I don't normally eat potatoes, fried foods, beef, gravy, or cheese, but if you're going to do it, go all the way, I say. This dish is definitely worth it!

I have to add a review to get the rating higher on this fabulous dish! I have made this recipe a few times and as the weather turns cool my thoughts drift to poutine. I first had this dish on my honeymoon in Quebec and have loved it ever since. This is very aunthentic and well worth the effort.

For the substitute on cheese, string cheese has about the same flavor as cheese curds.

I used frozen, premade French fries, because on principle I will not deep fat fry anything in my house. I normally do not eat such high fat foods, but I agree with others that rated this recipe that you should try new things and satisfaction and moderation are important. I really like these and loved the gravy. I could not find any haloumi cheese and used havarti instead. What kind of cheese is a good substitue for haloumi cheese and is that the kind of cheese these would normally be made with in Quebec? I did find cheddar cheese curds. Again, what kind of cheese curds would be authentic?

I tried this and it was great...way out west in BC in the small city where I live is a restaurant that makes it's own version of "poutine" they layer fries and gravey with cheddar and mozza then bake it in the oven until cheese melts and top is crisp... makes a heavenly delicious treat when the desire for "bad food" over takes us... enjoy what you like but as with anything, use moderation.

This is different than the poutine you get from chipwagon-type places all over Quebec, but it is definitely very tasty. They are not mistaken about poutine being served in the province's best restaurants now though. Many upscale restaurants are reinterpreting poutine: Au Pied de Cochon tops its version with foie gras, as does Beckta Dining and Wine in Ottawa.

Like jillybean in Vancouver, I am a thin middle-aged woman who loves poutine. It makes a delicious lunch, and I believe it is very nutritious. I think that poutine is better for you than a serving of white bread and meat (ordinary sandwich). It is a hot meal and it "sticks to your ribs" until dinner.

" Served at some of the province's finest restaurants " ????? WHERE, for God's sake !!?? Poutine is junk food, period. You won't find it in any barely *decent* restaurant !!! I didn't try your (fancier than fancy) recipe and certainly won't, since I'm from Montreal and had more than my share of poutine when I was a teenager. But true, as most junk food, it can be comforting, filling and not totally bad in taste. Period. But pleaaaaaase don't pretend it's gourmet's food !!!! ;-)

Again everyone, if you haven't made it please don't rate it. This came out delicious! And so what if it's unhealthy.

Some of you are sooo funny! I believe I'm an Epicurean. After all, my motto IS "eat, drink and be merry". I love new taste experiences and life is enriched when I share such enjoyments with friends. I'm amused that the "Stoics" here are insisting everyone cease and desist partaking in a such a delicious recipe, claiming it's for our own 'good'. That is funny! My suggestion is, if you think you cannot eat a particular offering on this site then don't make it. It's positively embarassing to see you attempting to convince others that what they are enjoying is "not up with the times", or "not 'haute cuisine' enough", or "is too 'unhealthy' to enjoy". By the way, I am a thin, healthy, middle aged woman who is absolutely unafraid to eat this wonderful tasty dish. And FYI, satifaction is also a vital aspect of health. And keep in mind that certain fats are our friends. So, to all you stoics, rather than attempting to censor, ban or book burn, why don't you relax your rigidity? Kick back, have some wine and some laughs with good friends and enjoy this deliciously 'healthy' recipe.

First reading the recipe, I could hear my arteries going "glug! glug!" Realizing the orientation of the recipe & my enjoyment of eating foods from other countries/ethinic groups, had to try it. No--won't have these often. But then I don't often eat fast food hamburgers for the same reason. But once in awhile--your taste buds tell you to "just do it!" :)

Decadent! Also, it was loved by my teenagers; altho' demi glace is a bit pricey and long in preparing at home. Stop bickering all of you - go cook something!

Funny how debates are created. What is poutine anyway ? Typical Quebec fare ? Yes. Fattening stuff ? Yes. Delicious dish ? Personnally not a fan, but others find it great. Should be part of my monthly Epicurious recipe envoy ? Questionable. Like receiving a sloppy joe recipe from a gastronomical website. Not what I expected. Laughing with glee. To NY cook : not trying to be pretentious, beurk is a sound one's makes (in French) when one dislikes something. To all : have a sense of humor, we are talking about food here, not nuclear policy. This is supposed to be fun and informative.Tolerance and openness to criticism makes this enjoyable, remember..

Poutine is an inherent part of the Quebecois culture and best enjoyed when purchased from an outdoor "frite-mobile" for lunch or a snack. Usually made with frozen fries and canned sauce, it is the Quebec fast-food, fattening and delicious. To elevate it to gourmet fare would make most Quebecers laugh with glee.

This receipe is great! I lived in Montreal and Poutine is the first on my list when we go back to visit Family. I can watch what I eat and don't need anyone to advise me on "junk food" for goodness sake keep your petty arguments off of the reviews!

Last I checked this site is not called "Cooking Light." This recipe is a once in a while treat, not meant to be a staple in one's diet. Besides, I think the toxicity of this recipe pales in comparison to the Tommy's chile cheese fries I indulged in today (just opened in San Diego -- thank God for small miracles).

A bit upscale, but delicious nonetheless. And, to the "cook" from California, I suggest that you actually try the recipe first. Nobody eats poutine day in and day out. It's a treat and a very tatsy one. Even Rob Feenie has it on the menu at one of his restaurant. FYI, he's the chef who came out on top on Iron Chef America. Cudos to Epicurious for providing this kind of flavourful recipe!

This recipe is too elaborate for poutine. How about a diner recipe. Sometimes simple and plebeian are best.

To sockmonkey, in Australia I haven't seen any kind of demi glaze. I would use beef or veal stock in its place.

J Mitchell, take it easy on Bill! I really think he's on to something (though I applaud your efforts to remove all the desserts, which I whole-heartedly (no pun intended) agree with). However, I would also add to Bill's list: fried chicken and fried fish dishes, pizza, hamburgers, anything with "corned" or "alfredo" in the name. I also recall seeing some salads that would be just fine if we could only remove their extremely offensive dressings. Finally, all those insidious mashed potato recipes should be burnt as well with all their nasty hidden butter, cream and fatty gravy. Don't forget that the definition of Epicurean is: Devoted to the pursuit of sensual pleasure, especially to the enjoyment of good (low fat) food and comfort.

To bill2455 from Vancouver, BC - may I ask, are you suggesting Epicurious remove EVERY unhealthy recipe? How about cheesecake, cookies, pecan tarts, pie and pastry, etc?

I am startled that this review conversation has become a "junk food" argument. Eat in moderation, and splurge sometimes (or else find a vegan website to complain). Personally, I love Poutine, and it is usually a highlight of my yearly trip to Montreal. Like all food, there are excellent versions in CN and very bad replicas. Before I try this, is anyone aware of a substitute for veal demi-glace? I don't want my fries and gravy to cost $20+ (American :)

For all the crybabies out there that "this is degrading to all Quebecois" get a life. Poutine is eaten all over Canada and originated in Quebec and is much loved by many people. It's made by many top chefs in Quebec both in their restaurants and at home. See: http://www.montrealfood.com/poutine.html for info on poutine if you are interested and a poutine lover like myself. Finally, 8 cups of oil for is not uncommon for cooking french fries; it helps retain the heat when the cold fries are added. Let the oil cool and strain it back into your "frying oil" jar and it can be reused many times.

The gravy was delicious. I used a mixture of gouda and jack cheese cut into small cubes. You guys stop being such snobs.

Strain the used oil and save for another time!! Also, what does 2006 have to do with anything? Good food is good food no matter what the year (and no matter what the foolish diet fad is [atkins]). Moderation is the key to all things.

I understand that a few of the earlier additions to the comments feel this is "junk" food and that it insults those who are from Quebec, however, there are a lot more fish in the water than yourselves, and there is always going to be someone who does not like these recipes that Epicurious posts. Although you are not happy with the recipe, someone else may be, and I applaud Epicurious for also accommodating those who do not eat quite as healthy as the rest of us. It's not Epicurious' responsibility to post only healthy recipes. We are all adults, and can make our own decisions.

As a Canadian in Europe I make this dish with a variety of gravies when I am missing home. Homeade chicken gravy if you do a Sunday dinner would be great. This is also often used in Canada. The fresher the cheese curd the better - you can tell, as the fresh ones squeak between your teeth! I've also used a very young cheddar cut into small cubes so that it will melt quickly when curds are not available. The home made fried potatoes are a luxury and the extra seasonings in the gravy are lovely. With a nice glass of wine on a cold evening...perfect!

Trying to pretend that "poutine" is anything but pure junk food is just appalling. Given Quebec's outstanding cuisine and world-renowned chefs, making it one of the best place in North America for haute cuisine, this is insulting to a Quebec-born and raised foody. And a little demi-glace won't change the fact that this is truck-stop fare at its worst. Beurk.....

I live in Quebec and I must recognize that poutine is very popular... but not very good for health! I tried this recipe and I must admit that is the better poutine that I ever ate in my whole life. But I didn't use 8 cups of oil. Just the regular amount (about 2 cups) that I used when I make french fries. The sauce was perfect. In Quebec, we use a apecial cheese that we call "p'tite crottes" ou "fromage qui fait couish-couish" - a reference to the particuliar sound that this cheese made when crushed between teeth-. Sometimes, I use cheese like brie, camembert ou gouda. Last summer, I was at the National Folk Festival in Bangor, Me and there was a food stand who sell poutine. I was very surprised!

You've got to be kidding. This is 2006! Nobody whould be eating like this. I'ts probably very good, and a small portion in a restaurant might make sense, but what would a home cook do with 8 cups of used oil?
