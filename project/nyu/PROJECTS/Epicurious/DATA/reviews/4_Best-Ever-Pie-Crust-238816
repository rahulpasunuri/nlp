Always struggled with pie crust until my 94 year old mother told me the secret. This recipe is as close to her (no recipe) crust. However-- her secret is to use lard for all shortening and a premium unbleached flour. The results using this recipe with those substitutions was OUTSTANDING!

This truly is the best-ever pie crust, but you absolutely must use the lard. It makes all the difference in the world-- easy to work with, sublimely simple to roll out, and the most user-friendly crust I have ever made. I used my grandmother's ancient pastry blender instead of the food processor with no trouble at all. This will surely be your new go-to recipe.

This is my GO-TO recipe for a pie crust. Paired with my favorite tarte tatin recipe on Epi, it garners rave reviews every time - NO FAIL and always a success!

I've always been frustrated with pie crusts, but have always held out hope that one day I would master a pie! I tried this recipe, first without the food processor. I used a pastry knife because that is what I am used to. Didn't turn out well, so I tried it a second time, following the recipe exactly.......Perfection! Looks and tastes beautiful!!!

You must make this with lard. I have resisted lard forever and gave in on this recipe. It seems to be what I have been missing in pie crusts all of these years. (Have tried all butter, crusts with egg and vinegar, etc. Good, but not as good as this one.) This is now my go-to crust recipe.

I used Crisco (not lard) and this did not make a flakey crust at all...in fact, it was a little bland. Probably won't make it again.

It was so easy to work with. So many crusts are hard to transfer to pie pan, this was so simple!

This is the Best-Ever Pie Crust! I've tried so many over the years in search of a really good, tender, flaky crust that doesn't taste like dust: all butter (tied for 2nd), some with vodka, some with crisco.... none compare with this. I have never tried butter and lard - but I had some lard in my freezer (in anticipation of making homemade flour tortillas) and tried it. I made it as a test recipe for the Rum Raisin Apple Pie from this site, and those testers I gave it to commented on the crust before the pie! I did let it sit overnight (actually 2 before using) not sure if that made a difference, but I would let it rest at least the one night in the frige! I doubt I will ever use another pie crust recipe!

Made a pumpkin pie on 1/7/11---(yes, didn't have one on Thanksgiving Day) and this is the Best-Ever Pie Crusts. It's a keeper!!!

Very good crust...rolled out just fine and cooked to a light, flaky, tender crust. I will keep this recipe in my file.

I never made pie crust before, and this came out perfectly. Everyone wants my recipe! I used shortening instead of lard with no problems at all.

I've been using this recipe since 2007 and it's the very best pastry EVER!!! It's tender and flaky and browns to a beautiful golden brown. To the cook who used shortening instead of lard .... I would suspect that's why you were disappointed with the results. Try again using lard.

I use this pie crust recipe every Thanksgiving and Christmas to make a cherry pie for my husband. It is amazing - tender, flaky, yummy. I use a foil ten the last 15 minutes to keep the edges golden.

I found this crust very disappointing. I followed the recipe exactly and used shortening, rather than lard. It was relatively easy to make, but it had very little flavor. Next time, I will go back to an all-butter crust.

I found that this crust was delicious, but hard to handle the dough. I felt it was too dry, and it kept tearing. I was told to be more patient by my instructor, who then used his rolling pin to roll the dough up (a technique I was aware of but not at that moment, it seemed) and place it easily in the pie tin. So I will definitely try this recipe again and try to be more patient :)

Just as stated- THE BEST EVER. My grandmother always used all shortening which is flaky but missed the lovely butter taste. This crust is perfect. I used about 7T of water rather than 5.

This is my go-to pie crust recipe, and it has always gotten rave reviews. I don't have a food processor, so I do all the mixing by hand. I find if I freeze the butter/shortening I can use my fingers to break up the small cubes once they've been added to the flour. As long as the fat is nice and frozen, the heat from your hands won't do any damage. I also typically need much more than 5 tablespoons of butter, or this makes a very dry dough. Tastes great!

Really good pie crust! I would say best ever as far as a butter/shortening mix crust, but I have to reserve the "best" for the "Butter Pastry Dough" @ this site under Gourmet '95.....super easy to work with, and,who doesn't prefer all butter? However, for my own picked & frozen sour cherries from last July, this crust really fit the bill & baked up so crispy, flaky, delicious! I also used way more cherries than asked for in my pie recipe, so I baked @ 375 for 1hr-20 min & NO BURN! Excellent on that alone!

This is the classic 50/50 crust recipe and it works like a charm every time. I find that "all butter" tastes great but is hard to roll out, is less light/flaky and is more prone to burn; "all lard/shortening" and it's easy to handle and very flaky but tastes like something you bought in a supermarket or from a cheap baker. Keeping the total weight of the fat the same, I sometimes put in a little more butter, maybe 60/40, to improve the taste but also leave me with a malleable dough. Hints: 1) weighing the ingredients (including the flour) instead of trying to measure by the cup gives a more consistent outcome. 2) I prefer to use "frozen nonhydrogenated solid vegetable shortening" (i.e., Crisco) instead of lard because it keeps the recipe vegetarian and means that your guests who keep Kosher can eat the pie. I also think that lard imparts a "heavier" feeling and taste. 3) the fat can't be cold enough to avoid ending up with a greasy and/or unmanageable dough (unfrozen butter or shortening might be the reason that the other poster had a problem with what is usually a foolproof recipe).

This pie crust is definitely the best-ever. I tripled the recipe to make a bunch of pies for Thanksgiving and they were all perfect in part because of the crust.

I made this pie crust using the Elegant Farmer Apple pie filling on Thanksgiving, it was EXCELLENT. Received rave reviews. It has completely spoiled my family who now refuse to eat store bought pie crusts.

EXCELLENT pie crust! I made a basic chicken pot pie with it and the crust made the deal. Like someone else said, I did have to add more water after I refrigerated it, but it was so easy and didn't burn at all. I did use real (nonhydrogenated) lard. The only change I made was to use unbleached white whole wheat flour. Perfect!

Ha! I just had to review this recipe when I stumbled upon it because this is the exact recipe my grandmother--who has no cookbooks to speak of--taught me to make pie crust with. We're Yankees, but I have even had Southern women tell me that my pie crusts are the best they've ever tasted.

This recipe is great!! I received many compliments on the impeccable crust! I'll probably use this recipe for every pie I make.

This recipe was excellent. I used lard and butter, but had to add a couple more spoons of water. I didn't leave in the fridge for more than 30 min but it still came out very flaky and tender. I brushed the top of my pie with egg and sprinkled with coarse sugar. I would make this again for sure.

For those having problems burning the crust, if you have never worked with butter in a pie crust before, this is most likely the cause. Butter burns more easily than an all Crisco crust (and it can make the crust harder), but it also gives it a better flavor. This is probably why the cooks have half and half in this recipe. All you really need is to tent the edges when it begins to brown.

Terrible, terrible, terrible. I'm not rating this because I must have done something wrong. Was it that I used Crisco instead of lard or nonhydrogenated shortening? I don't know what that is, and Crisco is classic in pie crust, so I figured it would be OK. Maybe not. I'm far from a beginner, and I followed the directions exactly (except for the Crisco thing)--used King Arthur all-purpose flour--and it was just a nightmare to handle. I just pulled my pie out of the oven and it looks and smells wonderful, so I hope the crust tastes good. But, gee, what misery!

This made the best crust I have ever tasted! The pie came out golden and flaky--just perfect. I didn't handle the dough much and rolled each disk out between two pieces of plastic wrap after chilling it. I can't wait to make this for the holidays.

Gosh, most of the recipes on this site are wonderful. I'm trying to overcome my fear of making crust and started with this recipe. It didn't come out well at all. The crust ended up being burnt on the ends. I'll keep trying until I master the art! Good luck all...

Have made Crisco recipe for 50 years, so tried this one for fun, didn't get quite enough water in it and it was hard to roll the first time, so I bunched it all back together and rolled it out a second time with great results. I will use it instead of my old stand by because of the butter and next time, I will try the lard.

Wow, lard makes all the difference in the world! This is the tastiest crust ever - I handled the dough a bit much & my crust still turned out flaky and delicious. I have also omitted the sugar and used this recipe for a savory quiche crust with same great results.

I am quite skilled at pie crusts. I have been perfecting pies for years and am on the American pie council.org very often. If done properly and all is chilled, this is perfect and flaky and will be the difference between a descent pie and an excellent one.

Fear not! This is an incredible pie crust recipe; easy and forgiving! I made the Cherry pie from the July issue (first ever pie entirely from scratch) and it was such a resounding success I made a second pie this week (cherry season is too short). The weather was quite a bit warmer on my second attempt and I did not use enough water to bind the flour, I sprinkled about a teaspoon of water on the dough and re-refrigerated the dough for about an hour. The dough rolled out perfectly (like it had on the first attempt) and is not tough or at all overworked. I can't wait to make my next pie (peach cardamom or blueberry?...)

I am terrified of pie crusts - simply terrified. If I want quiche, I buy the prepared crusts. If I want peach pie, I go to my 80 year-old aunt's house. My daughter, apparently, is not quite so daunted and bought all the ingredients to make the summer peach pie (I think she was determined to quash my fears once and for all). Next thing I know, she gets a call, lights out for parties unknown, and I had 4 pounds of peaches in my refrigerator and no pie. So it was up to me! I have no pie pans (those scare me too), so I dug out a square glass casserole dish. I prepared the pie crust exactly as instructed - and "fit" it in to the dish (that's how cobbler must have got it's name: pies that get "cobbled" together). Well - I am victorious. Simply stated: BEST pie crust ever ever ever. Flaky and light and absolutely amazing. I was stunned. My neighbors were grateful. And now I will go to my aunt's for her beef stroganoff. And my daughter? I didn't let her have any. She's going to have to make her own!
