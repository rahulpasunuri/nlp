Made this yesterday for Ratatouille; it was wonderful! Will try it next for just pasta.

Outstanding, easy sauce. A great way to lean out the fridge.

Mellow flavor (fresh herbs do it!) but robust enough for a hearty pasta (we used large rigatoni). Went heavier on the garlic (always do), but made no other alterations --- excellent sauce.
