My take would be to omit the raw red pepper. Not sure about the cumin, but definitely fresh basil and mozzarella with fresh ground black pepper. Sub in good balsamic vinegar and olive oil for the white wine vinegar. Might want to wait for tomato season and try a few different varieties of heirlooms to add color and interest. Then, you would have a winner.

I made the recipe as written and thought it was too bland. I added a lot of freshly ground pepper, thinly sliced fresh basil and some fresh mozzarella which I happened to have at the time. These 3 ingredients turned an ok salad into a wow salad.
