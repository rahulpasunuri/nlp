I really wanted to like this dish, but it fell short for me. I wouldn't recommend that anyone use this recipe. I thought the dish lacked "zing" and agree that onion and garlic would have helped.

Delicious. Very light and elegant and flavorful. Not bland at all. I think the trick is to season well every component. I just noticed that I kept the fennel seed whole and did not grind them. The dish was fine.

I have not written any reviews so far but I have to save others from the same fate. Please do not attempt this dish unless you want cat food for dinner. I would have chosen no forks, if that were possible. Maybe its salt cod, which I have never tried, but this dish was so bad that I dumped two pans into the compost after cleaning up every pan in our kitchen since they were all called for in this recipe and all the sweat and time in the kitchen was for naught.

As I was making the filling, I thought, "Uh oh, this is going to be really bland." But I added an extra teaspoon of fennel seed and a lot of freshly ground black pepper and it turned out surprisingly good. Personally, I think a chopped onion sauteed with the fennel would give it a boost but my boyfriend, who can sometimes be a pain in the you-know-what to cook for, liked this a lot and said not to change a thing.

You can make it as a filling for a crepe as well.
