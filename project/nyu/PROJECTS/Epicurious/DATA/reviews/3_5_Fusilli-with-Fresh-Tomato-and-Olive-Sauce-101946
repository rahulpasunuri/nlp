So simple, so good ... made about half of sauce for 1/3 of pasta (measurements not exact). I think this one of my favorite pasta recipes of all time

This was a very delicious pasta dish. Very versatile. I had a really good tomato paste so I added the whole very small can. A little time consuming to chop the tomatoes. Does anyone chop theirs in a food processor?? I did mine by hand and it was definitely more then 45 minutes prep. Still worth it though.

Absolutely lovely on a hot summer's day. Made with a variety of tomatoes from the garden. Had all the ingredients on hand so it only took the time to make that it took the fusilli to boil. Just added some Progresso tuna packed in olive oil to make it a one dish supper. This is definitely going into the summer rotation.

I made this tonight for dinner and it was extremely good. I didn't stray from the recipe, but the use of my tomatoes and basil from my garden made this dish. I used balsamic vinegar and Mc Cormick's Italian seasoning and extra red pepper. Delicious!

Tried this tonight and it was a winner without changing a thing.

I used organic heirloom tomatoes and added a little extra crushed pepper and it turned out great - spicy and flavorful, with a little zing from the vinegar (but nothing overwhelming).

I was already cooking the onions when I looked for a recipe so I cooked the onions longer (at least 10 minutes) and then added the garlic (2 cloves, plenty)the olives (maybe 1/4 cup) and the pepper. Probably cooked the sauce 6-7 minutes after adding the tomatoes and paste. Really liked the addition of tomatoe paste - fresh tomato sauces can be thin and watery Forgot the vinegar - wouldn't add it, because I really liked the way it turned out. Highly recommend peeling and seeding the tomatoes - after all, you have the boiling water for the pasta! Highly recommend the recipe - the way I made it!

Used this recipe to help use up the abundance of tomatoes from our garden and am thrilled to have discovered it.Everyone absolutely loved this - my only change was to use a little less basil and a little less crushed pepper.

The Red wine vinegar added great tang. Agreed: recommend use as a cold side salad. As a main- I will add more oil/paste to increase fluidity of sauce.

Tasty and relatively quick (as long as you have the ingredients on hand) but nothing spectacular. Maybe more salt or olives...

I added quite a bit more pepper. It was wonderful.

Great recipe for all the reasons stated below. It's also a great leftover. Even served cold 2 or 3 days after you make it, it holds the flavor and makes a tasty side salad.

This recipe is fabulous. I followed the recipe with a touch more onions. I also used organic tomatoes. All my guests request this recipe. Enjoy and don't believe the negative comments!

Well, I thought this was very good and my husband, who does not like olives, did too. I made it using balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar and got the onions soft before adding the olives and garlic. I also probably cooked the tomatoes a bit longer than called for. Good summer tomatoes are a must here.

Great dish, quick & easy to make. Like the other reviewer, I added balsamic vinegar, which makes it smell and taste extra-lovely. I also threw in some thyme and oregano. It's now my boyfriend's favorite pasta dish-- he requests it all the time!

My husband thought it was really, really good. I thought it was pretty good but nothing to rave about. I did caramelize the onions and cooked the sauce a little longer (maybe 15 minutes?). Since there were a few negative reviews about the vinegar, I just added a splash of balsamic vinegar to add some depth but not more than a tablespoon. It was a fairly easy recipe. I wished I had some crusty french bread to serve with it.

If you have time, carmelize the onions prior to makeing the recipe.

I made this recipe per instructions. We like spicy food so the only change I made was by adding a pinch more of crushed red pepper. We really enjoyed this dish. I would not recommend making any changes to the ingredients. The kalamato olives & fresh basil were wonderful!

Wow, I really enjoyed this recipe. I made it for my pasta-obsessed boyfriend, and it was crowned "The Best Pasta Dish You Have Ever Made"... and I've made many. :-)

This is fantastic served hot or cold! I make it for dinner warm one night and have the rest as a salad the next, the flavours really blend over night! Use good tomatoes and olives as you really can taste the difference.

Not spectacular and I don't think the fresh tomatoes work well with the red wine vinegar. So, if I ever made it again, I would omit the vinegar. I would use much more olive oil too. And, probably not use the tomato paste either. I let the tomaotes cook for a bit to release more flavor.

Delicious, but next time I'll double the olives.

This is such a wonderful recipe that certainly stands alone, but sometimes I vary it a bit. Try adding canned artichokes (not marinated) or chick peas. Please don't use canned black olives! This recipe calls for kalamata olives and relies on their distinctive flavor. I've also used fresh oregano in place of the basil. Delicious!

This was a good dish but I found it a little too hot for my taste. Next time, I'll try just 1/4 tsp dried red pepper.

Yum! I followed the recipe exactly and it came out terrific.

I did like this recipe. It was quick (which is always good). I didn't add the red wine vinigar, the red pepper flakes or the garlic (I just forgot the garlic). I probably used 1/2 the tomatoes and double the black olives. Just my preference.

I enjoyed this dish but found the onions too crunchy. When I make this again I will cook the onions for 15-20 minutes until soft before adding the rest of the ingredients.

I didn't add the red pepper, or the red wine vinegar. I also took that good advice and simmered the sauce for 20 min. It turned out wonderful!

I cut back on the olives (very high in salt content) and added mushrooms (anykind, a mix is even better) I've also tried Penolie nuts, excelent.

For my own tastes, rather than for time and ease, I use more olives; sauté until garlic and onions are completely translucent; sauté this "sauce" at least 20 minutes to marry the ingredients well; consider the use of Asiago or Romano cheese, and use less (1/2?) wine vinegar, if any.

I expected to love this recipe but unfortunately did not. I would not make it again.
