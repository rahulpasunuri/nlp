This is super-yummy spinach. A few drops of soy sauce makes it perfect.

Oh, YEAH. Delicious. Complaints of blandness are most likely fixed by adding soy sauce - that worked great for me. I'm sure it also helped that I used a lot more garlic and ginger and substituted half the vegetable oil with toasted - TOASTED - sesame oil. I thought the sesame seeds made it look like it came straight out of a Chinese restauran. I'll definitely make this over and over. A word of warning, though, I've heard that the two most pesticide-filled types of produce are spinach and strawberries - so I'm going to try to stick with organic.

What a nice change of pace for spinach. A dash of rice wine vinegar at the end adds a bit more flavor.

I loved this so much that after making one batch I had to make another just for me! Making the second batch gave me an opportunity to adjust it to my taste. I added a little soy sauce at the end and it was scrumptious.

I made this with yakuna savoy, which is kind of spinach-y. A good take on greens, goes well with Chinese food.

I found this recipe fast and easy. My husband is not a great fan of spinach, but he enjoyed this.

Well, I thought it was OK, but my husband didn't think it was that special. He'd prefer something else. What you see is what you get. it does take a lot of fresh spinach to make a serving of cooked spinach though.
