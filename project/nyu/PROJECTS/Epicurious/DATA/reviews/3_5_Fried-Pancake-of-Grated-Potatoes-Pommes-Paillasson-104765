Great! Crispy and tasty. I used a box grater, and pressed the moisture out with my ricer - worked like a charm - bone dry. Also added a bit of onion powder, and will add real onion next time.

You know, if you are not set on crispy pancakes, you can add more eggs and then you don't need to drain the water from the potatoes. The eggs take care of that. That was my Dad's way of doing it.

Very good. Every one loved them- except one who said that there was too much pepper in it,(WHIMP!)- and there was none left after they were gone. I had a hard time getting it out of the pan so I put the serving plate on top of the pancake and flipped the skillet over. Great recipe though! It goes well with the couscous recipe that they have (I don't remember which one-sorry). I certainly would make this again (I love anything that has potatoes in it!!!!!!)

Still looking for a good potato recipe. This one came out soggy, even though I used a good cast-iron pan. Turning it was impossible because it fell apart.

Delicious! It was basically hash-browns, and it was great!

This is a delicious, simple way to prepare potatoes. I add grated carrots and onion, and we often enjoy this dish for dinner.

Great homey recipe. Need I say "bubble and squeak" to any Brits out there or "rosti" to the Swiss? To get the potato starch stain out of the tea towel just soak in bleach.

I've made this one before......quick and easy... I've also added an egg to the tops of the potatoes as they've cooked. Love it!

Quick, easy, and versatile. You can flavor this recipe anyway you'd like. Just add your favorite spices, onion, garlic, etc. Mine came out nice and crispy. I think the secret is the type/quality of the pan you're using and the amount of heat.

Delicious and comforting! For a nice change, try adding some grated onion and finely minced jalapeno pepper (or other hot pepper). You'd be surprised how good the combination is!

Great recipe but I permanently stained a white dish towel squeezing the moisture out of the potatoes (nobody told me!).

I like this dish with a little fresh thyme crumbled into it. A little grated onion is nice too. Be sure to squeeze the dish towel tightly to get ALL the moisture our of the potatoes. And finally, it takes a very hot oven (450*) to keep the "pancake" crisp while re-heating.

This simple dish has been a family favorite, with seasoned salt, for decades. We've found it delicious with sour cream on it for break or brunch. Serve with a side dish of mixed green onions, stewed tomatoes and cottage cheese for an egg free brunch. Yum!

This is easy, quick and goes great with scrambled eggs for a brunch. For a dinner side dish, I saute the potatoes in light olive oil and chopped garlic, add chopped broccoli, squish it down, get it crisp, flip it several times so crispness is throughout the potatoes. The broc gets tender, potatoes are crisp/tender. Salt & Pepper to taste, of course! Add butter towards the end, if desired (I just drizzle extra olive oil if the potatoes look too dry). Easy & wonderful accompaniment to steak or London Broil.

I make this frequently as it is one of our favorites. I also add grated onion.

I've been making this recipe for years with a few minor adjustments. I also add grated onion and chopped parsley. Then I fry in olive oil until crispy. This goes great with a Navy Bean Soup. They are also good cold.

Again, very similar to one I've used before. Very popular with us.

I've been making a version of this for 20 years. I think I cook it a little longer since we like it crispy. This is also very good fried with a lot less butter and/or olive oil in a non-stick pan. You can make it using a lowly metal grater (with the coarse holes) if you don't want to get out the food processor.

This is a great recipe. I used seasoned salt and a little garlic powder. Everyone liked it

i thought it was great....it was very crispy on the outside and tender on the inside...I used yukon gold potatoes instead of russet

I was not happy with this dish, and I am an experienced potato pancake maker. It was not crisp and it looked very unappetizing. A better use of the ingredients would be potato pancakes.
