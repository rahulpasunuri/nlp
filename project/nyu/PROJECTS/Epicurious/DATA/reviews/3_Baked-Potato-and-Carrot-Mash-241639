I don't have a ricer, but a lot of mashing and beating worked. It's not bad, but the carrot and/or roasted flavor didn't come out for me. It looks good, but its like mashed potatoes. I didn't use sour cream just 3/4 cup milk, and no half and half. Still, I'd make it again. A good change from regular potatoes.

I made this as a side for Easter dinner last year. Everybody loved it. My husband requested the dish for any special occasion, or any day for that matter! You could do anything with the dish to spice it up, not that it is bland. I am very partial to mint in my mashed potatoes. Definitely a good dish for the finicky, or not too foofy, eater.

A very good side dish. Goes well with grilled rubbed pork tenderloin.
