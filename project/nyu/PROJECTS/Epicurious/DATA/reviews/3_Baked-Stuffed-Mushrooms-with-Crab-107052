I used this recipe for stuffing 3 large port mushrooms, though I didn't measure out the crab so much as eyeballed how much I would need for the mushrooms I had. Otherwise, I followed the recipe stuffing ingredients. These turned out well; I made a baked squash/zucchini dish on the side and altogether it was quite filling. I gave this three forks b/c I didn't make the sauce so I can't review it. Instead, I cooked them for 18 minutes and then added a pat of butter on each and cooked another 8 minutes. This made them moist without the hassle of making the sauce.

ok, im going to break from the crowd and say this was just ok. there better recipes out there. if i had seen the review from the cook who served on a bed of sauteed spinach and topped the stuffing with tomatoes, i would have tried that modification, but alas, too late. i wont make this again.

delish-this was great! Followed the recipe exactly. Great side with cedar planked salmon and brussel sprounts. Pinot noir was a nice wine with this dinner.

We love these mushrooms as a tradition at thanksgiving. The only negative is that the recipe calls for too much sauce for the final topping there is always a jar of topping left over! Enjoy!

After reading other reviews, I made this recipe omitting the sauce, but adding 6 slices of diced, cooked bacon. I also pre-roasted the mushroom caps tossed with a little olive oil, salt and pepper before stuffing them. I dusted the tops with a little Old Bay seasoning, and everyone loved them.

This is a wonderful dish to create and serve. These mushrooms can be large portobella for main dishes or baby portobella for appetizers. I used real crab and did not cheat by cheapening the dish with fish. I omitted the mayonaise ( too much fat)in the stuffing and then made a classic Hollandaise sauce for the top. I served the large portobella mushrooms on a bed of sauteed spinach with a hint of garlic and then placed slightly sauteed plum tomatoes with fresh ground black pepper on top of the mushrooms. It was pleasing to see and eat! They were marvelous! I will definately make again.

I make this dish for every pot luck and dinner party I attend, needless to say that these mushrooms are NEVER on the table for more that 10 minutes!! I've made this as is and other times I'll use 1/2 crab and 1/2 shrimp with the same mind blowing results. I have found that using Imitation Crabmeat rather than Lump Crabmeat tastes better (go figure). I don't make the sauce because the mushrooms really don't need it. My suggestion take this recipe and run with it, don't let it be black and white, use your imagination!! For instance, I'll add a sprinkling of chopped chives and a light dusting of Old Bay Crab Seasoning for both flavor and presentation. This recipe is definately worth your time and energy. Enjoy! Happy Cooking!

I did not care for this recipe at all-too much mayonnaise. My husband, however,thought it was great but thought the recipe should have included cheese. No thanks- with or without cheese.

I used this receipe to stuff large portabello caps for dinner and they were excellent. I added some hot sauce and fresh cracked pepper to the crab mixture to spice it up a bit. This is an easy dinner to make ahead and bake whenever you're ready.

I did this recipe for my mom´s birthday party, and everybody loved it. I would definetely do it again, but maybe i´ll put something hot like tabasco or habanero sauce just to have an extra kick to it.

MY FIANCE LOVES STUFFED MUSHROOMS SO I GAVE THIS RECIPE A TRY. ALTHOUGH WE PREFER A BUTTERY SAUCE THIS WAS A PLEASANT SURPRISE. WILL BE MAKING THESE AS AN APPETIZER FOR THANKSGIVING. DEFINITELY WORTH THE EFFORT.

To the cook from Columbia, why go so far as to criticize local cuisine? You were adventurous enough to try it and you didn't like it- that should be enough said.

Ugh! First, I have to admit I can't stomach most of the stuff considered "local cuisine" in these parts. It's frequently high fat, low flavor, and completely boring. I should have known better than to try a recipe from one of the worst examples of it. I'm not a native, and even I know better than to eat at the biggest scam of a "local" restaurant (read tourist trap that doesn't even serve local crab). But, I had all the ingredients on hand, and I do love stuffed mushrooms. Never again.

I'd also give this a zero if possible. Absolutely one of the worst things I have ever made. Completely bland. The "sauce" had such a thick consistency that it was impossible to drizzle.

For all of the fat and calories, this wasn't worth it. I used so-so crab - perhaps better with super crab. But I won't be trying it again.

I would have given this a 0 if I could. I can't imagine that this is what Phillips serves as an appetizer. They could do much better than this!
