Have always been a BIG fan of roasted tomatoes, and decided it was time to make them myself. They have now been in the oven for 2 hours and are not nearly done. I think the 3 to 5 hours suggested in other recipes is more realistic if you want that chewy intensely flavored endproduct.

Super easy. Super delicious. I also roasted two whole heads of garlic while I roasted the tomatoes because you might as well.

Very tasty and easy. We had some feta we were looking to use up, so we threw that on for the last 20 minutes (could've thrown it on for even longer). The feta was great, we couldn't imagine the recipe without it.

The roasting takes tomatoes to a new level, impressive and easy as a side with roasts, meatloaf or non tomato pasta dishes. I like them plain and straightforward as written. I have made these many times, always a hit.

These are delicious - I added thyme from the garden because it was there. Great way to use up summer tomatoes, or to improve the flavor of super market tomatoes. I used Romas, which have less water, so the leftovers reheated nicely.

This is great sprinkled with olive oil, parmigiano, minced garlic, dried thyme,dried basil, salt and pepper.

This is a really tasty and easy dish to make. I love to make this as a topping for pasta by simply baking it with some sliced onions and water. It's especially good on a summer night with fresh tomatoes.

Wonderful with Aglio and Olio pasta or filled with feta as an hors D'oeuvres. Or, put in a decorative jar under olive oil for a great hostess gift.

Easy. Perfect for a side when having a dinner party since it can be fixed ahead of time and it is stress free! Next time we will sprinkle last minute with parmesan reg, fresh basil (no salt) just for variety.

I also sprinkle with finely chopped garlic and put sprigs of thyme on top. Amazing! It will also keep well, covered in the refrigerator for several days. This is very good served with goat cheese and crackers as an appetizer.
