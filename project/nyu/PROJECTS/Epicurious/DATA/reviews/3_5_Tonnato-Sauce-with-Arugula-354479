Fabulous for a weekday meal. It will become a go-to staple as most of the ingredients are easily kept on hand. Great flavor with the arugula pairing.

Wretched. It smelled like a warm tuna salad sandwich. My least successful Gourmet recipe ever. I would give it 0 forks if I could.

We make this all the time, it's wonderful and so quick. Over time I've made a few changes: I leave out the mayo, and add more lemon juice, some lemon zest and a bit of olive oil. Short pasta, like penne, works better than linguini, and it's great with whole wheat pasta. Today I put in one can of tuna and one of sardines - also very good.

Is there a way to use the site and convert the recipes to metric? Thanx!

If I could give this 5 forks, I would. Wow! What a wonderful dish!! My arugula in the garden is half spent and I decided to use arugula and sorrel. My husband loved it. He is of Italian heritage and was always a little wary of tonnato sauces saying he wasn't sure of tuna in a blender because his mother had never made it. I also used homemade pasta with eggs from my chickens and it made the dish. Obviously there was so many components to rate and evaluate but we were very happy with this dish and will definitely add it to the summer meals.

An update--I made it again tonight with capers; I like the olives better. Arugula is definitely good.

Really good. I've been making a tuna sauce for pasta for years, and this is way better. Note, though, that I was out of capers and substituted some calamata olives, and forgot to get arugula and used a lot of parsley instead. Red pepper flakes sounds good, but I'm less convinced about the garlic. (I also used my own EVOO mayonnaise.) My tuna comes in 5oz cans; if yours does too you may want to adjust accordingly.

Full disclosure: I completely skipped the arugula, because my husband wouldn't like it. He doesn't like anchovies either, but I just didn't tell him they were an ingredient, and what he didn't know didn't hurt him... I took the advice of the previous reviewer and added some hot red pepper flakes and some garlic. It came out quite yummy, and my husband even liked it. He noted, approvingly, that it was "different". Next time around I might go a little easy on the capers, because I thought their taste was a wee bit strong, but overall this was a good recipe.

I made a half recipe of this but with the whole can of tuna. It was very quick and easy, and also quite tasty--a unique meal for a hot summer night. However, it was still a little bland. Red pepper flakes, garlic, fresh parsley would probably turn this into a fantastic dish. I would also chop the greens next time so that they wilt a bit more effectively.
