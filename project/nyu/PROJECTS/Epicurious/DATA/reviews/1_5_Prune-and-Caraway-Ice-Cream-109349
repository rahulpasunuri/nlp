Granted: Used 'house standard' ice cream with 1c skim milk, 1c whole milk, 1c H&H, 1/4c sugar and only 2 eggs. But: after that, used proportionate amounts of prunes (though 2x liquor to simmer so as not to burn) and caraway. Result: Not inedible ... but far from a keeper. Other changes: Removed most seeds, wish had removed all as tough, bitter. Color unappealing. I LOVE common ingredients used in new ways but this didn't make the mark for our palates ... PS My 78-year old food critic father says it 'wasn't bad' but he'd have left in more prune chunks so the fruit was identifiable vs obscure.

This recipe sounded so wierd, I just had to make it for my sister's Easter gathering which included her in-laws of Urkranian/Russian decent. It was very rich but the flavor was unique and unexpected ( most guests thought it was chocolate until they tasted it!). The egg yolk flavor and prunes over powered it all and I would reduce both in the next batch so the caraway/vodka flavor can come thru. The poppy seed cookies make the dish! They were great.
