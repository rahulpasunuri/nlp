Not sure if I overbeat the meringue or overcooked the meringue, but it came out glue-y. I didn't think the meringue added much to the experience, anyway: it gilded the lily. I threw away the meringue from the leftovers and enjoyed it as it was. In the future, I would make this as a traditional flan: increase the amount of the caramel and serve it turned upside down. My first try at making the caramel also failed: I threw out the first batch and made a second using the caramel recipe from "The Best Recipe" cookbook, which involves water, lemon juice, and corn syrup (though I used maple syrup instead). That turned out perfectly! The flavor of the flan itself was lovely, and I would definitely try this again with the indicated changes.

This is a wonderful recipe. I have been making it for years. It is too sweet; I always cut down 1/2 the amount of sugar called for. If your meringue topping fell apart, it is because it was not beaten enough or too long and became runny. You have to beat it just right. It is a lovely dessert and I am always asked for the recipe!

I served this for a luncheon and was embarassed! It was not a pretty sight -- the meringue separated from the sides of the pan; after cutting, the meringue then kept slipping off the flan piece; and it was not even tasty. I will never make this again!! A much better pumpkin dessert is the pumpkin bread puddings brulee.

I brought this dessert to a Holiday dinner and it was the undeniable the hit of the meal! It was much easier to make than I expected and I would recommend it to anyone wanting a change from the standard pumpkin pie. It's the kind of dessert that makes you want to get up in the middle of the night, just for another taste!

I was skeptical at first. I already have a wonderful vanilla flan recipe and have never made it with pumpkin. I served this desert at the Thanksgiving table and it was a hit. Some of my guests actually liked it better than my original flan recipe which had always been a favorite at my holiday table. OLE'! to my new holiday tradition!!!

I made this last Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit. Everyone requested that I make it again.

I made this dessert to bring to a friend's house who was having a Mexican dinner. It was much too sweet. I would definitely not make it again.

Flan is a favorite here in Tampa and the pumpkin flan is a perfect holiday dessert!

Absolutely delicious. The flavour combination of coconut and pumpkin is surprisingly fantastic! I've served this to guests twice and received rave reviews each time. The hardest part for me was finding a pan large enough for the hot water bath.
