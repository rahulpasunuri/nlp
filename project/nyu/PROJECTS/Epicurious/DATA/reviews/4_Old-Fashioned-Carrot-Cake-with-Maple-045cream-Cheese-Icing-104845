This is the finest carrot cake recipe I've ever made. I doubled the proportions to make a 9" and a 6". I've made cakes professionally and I think I got more compliments for taste on this cake than any other. (However, I used a different frosting recipe.) The cake was very moist and yet firm enough to stack the layers. The carrot flavor was wonderfully pronounced. FYI, 4 cups of finely grated carrots took a one-pound bag. I added a 1/2 t of fresh nutmeg, and 1/8 of clove to give a little extra spice. If you leave out the walnuts, that is fine, the carrot has plenty of flavor without any addition. This cake made me proud.

This is an awesome recipe! I made it for friends for years but couldn't get my husband to try it because he said loathed carrot cake. So once I told him it was making a spice cake, and he loved it!! I freeze leftovers and slice off portions until it's gone. Delicious!

This recipe has now become a firm family favourite. Because we prefer things less sweet and a cakier texture, we reduce the amount of sugar in the cake and the icing, and squeeze the grated carrots dry before adding them to the cake.

If this cake were a man, it would be Jon Hamm. Or George Clooney. Or whomever your ultimate dreamboat is.. because it is SWOOON-WORTHY! Not even my total lack of baking skills could ruin this marvellous recipe. It was incredibly moist with just the right balance of spice thanks to the cinnamon and ginger. Two things to share that may be of interest. The cake has a very "egg- y" flavour. I love eggs so I didn't mind that but others may not enjoy it. The other is that I found the maple cream cheese wasn't necessary. The flavour - in fact, the whole cake - is so outstanding in itself, I would have preferred an icing that was more understated. Perhaps just a simple cream cheese icing next time. It's not a criticism - just a personal preference. At any rate, you can burn all your other carrot cake recipes - this one goes into a frame!

Simply the best carrot cake I have ever made or had the pleasure of eating. Substituted raisins for the walnuts and added some clove. Perfect!!

I made this cake for a dinner party and those who initially refused a piece because they didn't like carrot cake ended up eating large slices themselves! I omitted the walnuts, since there were toddlers, and used a modified version of the frosting based on reviews (I also let the frosting set up in the fridge first). IT WAS AWESOME. I'm making it again for my son's 2nd birthday party!

Made this as a 9 in. layer cake for my daughter's birthday yesterday. It's been devoured! Really easy, moist, simple, and delicious. Just the right amount of sweetness. I used my own frosting recipe- 3 pkgs light cream cheese, 1 stick of butter, 1 cup of conf. sugar (added slowly and mixed for about 5 min) and a tbsp of lemon juice. Perfect amount of icing for the layer cake. Excellent.

I made this cake for a birthday party at work, and everyone thinks that I am a brilliant baker... Received comments like, " I don't like carrot cake, but I love this! This is the best carrot cake I have every had. How did you get it to be so moist?" Did NOT use the maple cream cheese frosting, but rather a thin layer of regular cream cheese frosting.

Very Good, I will make this again. { I didn't make the maple frosting, I used the Vanilla Cream Cheese Fosting from this website instead and did the recommended adjustments by other reviewers to the frosting.} I was out of walnuts so I used toasted almonds. I DON'T suggest using almonds. They are too hard and the texture of them is wrong for carrot cake. Next time I will use walnuts or pecans. The cake was very moist and still very good even though I used the wrong nuts.

Rating: 4
we love, love, love this cake. one thing i've learned makes a big difference is to be sure to finely grate the carrots. i use the food processor to grate the carrots and one time i used the regular grater instead of the fine grater... it was not nearly as moist with the regular grate.

This has become my standard cake to bring. Made it for a party, made it for Christmas, making it for Superbowl party tomorrow. Works really well in an 8x13 pan too. Everyone and I mean everyone loves this cake. Definitely needs more powdered sugar for the frosting to stand up though.

I made this Carrot Cake last week for my husband's birthday. He has raved about it to family and friends, and I am also quite pleased. He is more of a pie person, so this was a nice change. I followed the recipe exactly for the cake and used about 1/4 cup less powdered sugar for the icing. He loves the richness of the cake and the not-too-sugary-sweet icing. I even used the 1/3 less fat cream cheese and could not tell any difference in taste or consistency. Made it in three 6" pans and one large 9" for the remaining batter, frozen for later snacking :) yum!

This recipe makes 24 cup cakes (~20 min. cooking time). Tested with great reviews by a church group, friends (who are very picky), and a birthday boy. They tasted awesome and even healthy after adding 4 cups of carrots. I made the frosting by whipping 8oz. low fat cream cheese with a dash of milk, tsp vanilla extract, pure maple syrup, and 3 TB of sugar until the right consistency.

I baked this as one layer in a 28cm round glass pan. It came out dense and moist (almost too much of both) and the flavor was great. The icing, however, was runny and made three times more than we needed. In all, it was a good cake but I've had better results with other recipes.

I made this cake for the first time and it was a hit last night at my Christmas party. Because the reviews were mixed on the maple-cream cheese icing, I didn't take the chance. I used this simple recipe instead, which also received praise. CREAM CHEESE ICING 1 3oz. package cream cheese 1 cup brown sugar 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg Blend cream cheese and sugar. Add nutmeg and mix well. (Source: New Age Vegetarian Cookbook)

I substituted 1/3 c. molasses for 1/3 c. of the oil, and cut down on the sugar somewhat to compensate. For frosting, I mixed 8 oz cream cheese and 8 oz sour cream with 2 tbsp butter for firmness and confectioner's sugar to taste. Two people told me it was the best carrot cake they'd ever had.

This cake went over very well with my guests! I substituted some applesauce for half of the oil to make it slightly healthier. Also I reduced the amount of butter in the maple frosting. It WAS a very runny frosting, even after refrigerating it for quite some time, but it was delicious and tasted great with the cake.

Easy and delicious. I skipped the frosting, and just dusted with powdered sugar since the cake was so moist and tasty it didn't need it. Added a tiny bit of vanilla. Huge hit at work, since without frosting could be eaten before lunch!

I love this cake! I used a food processor to grate the carrots very finely, and it was the perfect texture. I did use a basic cream cheese icing (with a little sour cream added) as it's difficult to find real maple syrup where I live. I also used half wholemeal flour, and it was wonderful.

One of the best carrot cakes I have ever had. Extremely moist and quick to throw together if you use a food processor for the carrots. To make it a little healthier I made the following substitutions: 1/2 c sugar, 1/2 c brown sugar and 1 cup Splenda; 1/2 c oil and 1/2 c unsweetened applesauce; 1 c all-purpose flour and 1 c whole wheat flour. I also realized my eggs had expired so I used egg beaters instead. I was a little leary about using the egg beaters but it turned out fabulous! I haven't tried the frosting yet, but will do so next time.

I tried out this recipe after reading the good reviews on it. Otherwise fine, my cake had such a strong baking soda taste that it was practically inedible! This might be because I left out the walnuts (upon opening the bag I found that hey had gone bad), and so there wasn't enough acidity to react with the baking soda.

Fantastic cake - light, moist and delicious! We made it with almonds, rather than walnuts and this weekend we'll be taking out the nuts all together. We used Lemon Cream Cheese Frosting rather than the Maple Icing. Everyone at the party loved it and one guest requested it for his birthday cake later this year.

I tried making carrot cake once before, using a different recipe, and it was dry and not very good. So I was a bit hesitant to try this, but I'm so glad I did! I actually followed the advice in the one negative review, and made sure to use the "dip and level" method to measure the flour. I had to substitute butter for part of the oil as I unexpectedly ran out halfway through, and I didn't make the icing because I had to take it into work and wasn't sure how it would hold up unrefrigerated. But it was delicious and had a lovely, moist but firm, texture. At first, the idea of a carrot-based dessert seemed barbaric to my French co-workers - but this totally won them over!

Rating: 4
I have made this several times, each time to rave reviews. It's also super-easy to make. However, make sure to use full-fat cream cheese; the lite versions are too soft at room temperature and won't hold up the way a frosting should.

Baked the batter in a 9" x 13" pan; took @45 minutes. Do not like maple, so used my standard cream cheese frosting (i.e. 16 oz. cream cheese, 1 stick unsalted butter, 1 1/2 cups confectioner's sugar, 1 tsp vanilla.)Wonderful cake that received raves from guests.

I followed the recipe exactly and it got rave reviews from my guests. I did need to bake one layer for an additional 5 minutes - I think my oven heats unevenly. I used the maple cream cheese icing - it was very thin so after putting on one layer I chilled the cake in the freezer and added another layer of icing and chilled it again. It looked beautiful and everyone said it was the best carrot cake they'd ever had.

I followed the cake recipe to the letter and it came out perfectly. I was scared off of the icing by the other reviews so I used a simple cream cheese recipe from Better Homes and Gardens. Everything was great and I will make this regularly.

I made this cake for a friend on her birthday, but I made a few tweaks that turned out marvelous! If you are trying to watch your weight try this out! I switched the 2 cups of sugar to 3/4C Sugar and 1 1/4C Splenda. I used 2 cups of whole wheat flour instead of the all purpose. I also felt it was missing raisins, so I went to 1/2C walnuts and 1/2C raisins. I also followed the other bakers advice and made it in a bundt pan at 350 for 55 minutes. Turned out PERFECT! Much easier than having to ice 2 layers if you just want something for your family that doesn't revolve around a massive amount of icing. YUM!

I made a gluten-free, nut-free, dairy free version - and I can't believe how good it is. For the flour I used a gluten-free all purpose flour mix made by Arrow Mills. I omitted the nuts and the icing. That was yesterday, and there are only two people eating this cake, but it's gone already. The cake is moist without being soggy, and full of flavour. Frankly it needs no icing - the sweetness level is just right - enugh to make it a treat, not so much as to overpower the other flavours. One word of warning - I couldn't find the cake pans so I cooked it in a tube pan instead. It took about 20 minutes longer to cook, but the main problem was enormous overflow. Though the cake was still great, I recommend sticking with the pan types in the recipe. This will definitely go into my list of cakes to cook for family and friends. It's not suitable for for formal entertaining if you use wheat-free flour though - the absence of gluten makes for a cake prone to falling apart if you have a very large chunk of it on a fork.

Rating: 4
Yum, yum and YUM! Very nice cake, and pretty, too, with all those flecks of dark orange carrot. I used pecans instead of walnuts (didn't have walnuts on hand), but otherwise didn't change a thing (except I did have to bake the layers an additional 8 minutes). Make this cake for someone very special -- even if that's yourself!

Another hit for epicurious! I made the cake with a few modifications. I substituted half the oil for applesauce, as suggested by others. I decreased the sugar to about 1 1/2 cups and used 1 cup of white and 1 cup of whole wheat flour. I left out the nuts, since my 8 year old carrot cake loving son hates them. Next time I'll try all whole wheat flour. The cake came out very light and delicious. I baked it for 55 minutes at 350 in a flower-shaped non-stick pan. When cooled I dusted it with icing sugar. It was a hit with both the young and old tasting and looking fantastic.

This carrot cake was delicious! I tried one cake with grated carrots and another with the carrots chopped finely in a food processor and couldn't tell the difference. However, the food processor was less time and labor intensive. The frosting is a bit sweet, I only used 1 cup of sugar instead of 1 1/2. I would highly recommend this to anyone.

This is by far the best carrot cake I've ever had -bakery's included!!! I added 1 cup of dried cranberries for color and everyone agreed it was amazing!! I was hesitant about the icing as people complained it was too thin so I only added enough maple syrup to get to the right consistency (about 1/2 cup or so) and it was perfect. I sprinkled some chopped walnuts on top for decoration. Honestly, the best dessert ever! Read no further- bake this cake!

Rating: 3
Good. Made this twice -- the first time as written, the second time with 4.5 oz raisins -- and preferred the second because it was more moist and flavorful (but be sure to reduce the baking temperature and increase the baking time if you do add the raisins). I should have increased the cinnamon as well. Didn't make the icing, though, so I probably am missing out on the extra oomph that might garner this recipe a stronger rating.

I made this for my sister's baby shower and everyone RAVED about it! The maple cream cheese frosting is the perfect finish for this extremely moist, flavorful cake.

This is a very tasty cake with a good light consistency. I changed the sugar to 1/2 cup and 1 cup of Splenda, and used 3 cups of carrots, because I ran out. However, it was delicious anyway and just sweet enough. It seems to be fool-proof and I can see adding any number of variations.

I made this cake for the first time on Christmas Day 2003. It was wonderful. There were only 4 of us and over half the cake was gone before the evening ended. I made a few modifications. I reduced the amount of sugar by one half cup; 3/4 c sugar and 3/4 cup light brown sugar. I reduced the sugar for the icing. I don't care for maple syrup so I left that out too. It was the best cream chese icing I have ever tasted. Others have asked for the recipe. This cake is now one of our holiday favorites. I will be making this carrot cake again and again.

This carrot cake took about an extra 25 minutes to be cooked through (until a cake tester came out clean). It was very dark on the outside, and so moist as to be SLIMY on the inside. It was very greasy, and I used 1/2 applesauce instead of oil. It was very very heavy, also, and made thin, flat layers. I have a brand-new, recently calibrated oven, so I doubt that the oven was at fault. The only thing I could think of was that I measure flour on a digital scale, and perhaps the recipe author use the "dip and level" flour measuring method. A cup of flour weighs 4 ounces, but if you dip your measuring cup into the flour tin you'll get some packing and about 5-6 ounces of flour per cup. Anyway, I had to purchase a cake for my party, and I'm not going to bother with this one again.

What a great cake!!! All these years, I have tried lots of carrot cake everywhere. I finally found the recipe that I love. I followed other cooks' advice by substituting half cup of oil with unsweetened apple sauce. I added 3/4 cup of crushed pineapple (drained the juice) and about half a cup of raisins. The cake is very moist and not oily. I only put 1 cup of sugar to make the maple frosting and the frorting stiil tasted yummy and smelled so good.

Very good carrot cake. I followed the suggestion and replaced 1/2 cup of oil with applesauce. It was very moist and did indeed taste like a real "carrot" cake! The icing was a problem. I had to add more powdered sugar and refrigerate it, it was much too thin to frost the cake with. I would use a different cream cheese icing with this cake recipe next time.

I made this cake in my dorm kitchen and it's just wonderful! I only had one pan so I cooked it in one big layer--very moist, and it has a wonderfully superior flavor. A big hit with everyone on my floor! We sliced it up in finger sized pieces and ate half of it while it was still warm from the oven! Also keeps great--chilling it is the final touch...as I think someone else said, nothing like a piece of this cake straight out of the fridge! Instead of shredding carrots with a grater, I diced them and put them through low speed on a blender...a cuisinart would work better. But a few chunks are okay, they just make the cake more carroty and keep that homemade feel. Also I didn't make the maple cream icing, I used the frosting that went with the "Carrot-Orange Cake" on here, and ended up cutting the sugar in half. Overall, delicious and easy to make. Shredding the carrots is the hardest part.
