I have included this in just about every Thanksgiving menu since I first tried it in 2005. I think I only missed it last year because things got too hectic in the kitchen and I ended up just mashing the yams into the other potatoes. I also make it as a side dish during our regular dinners too. Everyone loves it. Just FYI, yams are the red skinned variety and sweet potatoes are the brown variety. Yams are naturally sweeter. It makes a difference in how this dish turns out. As does the type of maple syrup. Grade B for sure makes it richer!

Make sure to use sweet potatoes rather than yams, otherwise it will be very bland.

I hate to say this, but I found it fair at best. Rather bland. My chunks were larger than specified and I don't know if my maple syrup was Grade B or not (although it was high quality). I won't be doing it for Thanksgiving.

There was almost a battle over the last serving of these. So easy and delicious.

I rarely say this, but while this was good overall, it was actually a bit too sweet from the maple syrup. I think perhaps a sorghum molasses might suit it better, or maybe it was the (Canadian, as that is all the store had) variety of syrup we used. In any case, a little goes a long way with this dish, and to balance the sugary maple taste, we sprinkled cinnamon on the finished product. I would make it again, but only if I can find a less sweet syrup to use. It is extremely easy, though, and adaptable to a variety of flavors, be them sweet, savory, or hot.

This was a great side for Thanksgiving. I didn't have room in my oven, so I first microwaved the sweet potatoes, then added the maple syrup and finished roasting them in the oven. Everyone was impressed from the candied-yams-with-marshmallows crowd to the more adventurous of the group. Very easy and delicious

Great recipe. My guests raved about these sweet potatoes this Thanksgiving, and several of them asked for the recipe!! It took longer than 20 minutes for my maple syrup to glaze.

This was super easy and very tasty. My husband has never liked sweet potatoes and he actually ate these! A definate keeper.
