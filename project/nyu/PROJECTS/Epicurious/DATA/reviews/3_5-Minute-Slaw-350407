This is a very refreshing cabbage salad side. I wouldn't really call it "coleslaw", but it was delicious! Used as a side for a rich crab cake for lunch - was perfect! The proportions on the ingredients as written seemed perfect. I halved it, as did for just two people, and cut up both fresh red cabbage and napa cabbage for a bit of color. Let it sit for 30 mins before serving to enhance flavors.

We love this slaw and probably have it 3 or more times a month. It is so easy to throw together and have a fresh salad without mayo or oil. We use a bit more celery seed and let it sit for a while (or not depending how much time we have). I'll be making this for years to come.

Made it the first time following the recipe, and it was waaaaay too salty. I couldn't even eat it. Made it again with 1/2 tsp salt, and it tasted like cabbage with vinegar on it. I suppose I should have expected that, but very disappointing anyway.

super easy, super good. i abhor mayo, but i really enjoy a good slaw, so this recipe appealed to me. i'm also a big fan of north caroline-type slaws, but this one sorta has an asian feel to it. i usually make it a half hour or so ahead of time so the flavors really set in, and i throw in some canned crab to give it a little protein. really can't be beat.

I appreciated the ease of this dish - it was extremely easy! It was good, but I didn't LOVE the taste. I had one friend who just about couldn't put the bowl down - I'm sure she would rate it as a 4. I rated it as a 2 because I just wasn't thrilled by it. I would use a little less red wine vinegar and a pinch less salt. I also forgot the green onions, so that may have been the key ingredient that I was missing.

I'm always looking for a slaw recipe that doesn't use mayo. This one is simple and delicious and doesn't overpower the veggies. I don't miss the oil - it tasted great 'as is' - but a friend added a dash of olive oil and it tasted fine as well. I'm adding this to my stash of oil- less and mayo-less slaw recipes and will definitely make it again.

This is a quick and easy recipe when time is short. I also add some dry mustard and salad oil, as well as a dash of cayenne for a little extra "bite".
