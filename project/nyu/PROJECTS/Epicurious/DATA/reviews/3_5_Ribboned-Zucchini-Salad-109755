Delicious! The dressing is wonderful. Didn't use the frisee but don't think it needs it to be successful. This could win over non-zucchini lovers.

The flavors here are right on. A very nice & refreshing salad. The store I went to didn't have any frisee, so mine was less leafy green than as it is here, but it was still really tasty. also I opted to whirr the hearbs & vinaigrette in a food processor quickly to make almost a pesto that I then drizzled over the zucchini and olives. Very nice indeed.

This was a great simple salad. I made many modifications. I only had salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, fresh basil, olive oil and mustard for the dressing. It was very tasty. I also let the zucchini (I also added yellow squash) marinate in the salt for about 45 minutes. I believe this added a lot of flavor. I also just used a simple vegetable peeler to make the ribbons. I added arugula and tossed in the dressing. Then I stacked them in between thick slices of fresh tomato, drizzled some more olive oil and dusted some grated parmesan. It was a hit. My husband ate them like sandwiches!

great method of draining zukes and using as salad base-- I translated it for a spicy Vietnamese beef salad.

Although the zucchini was a bit work-intensive, this salad was a winner. Used lemon basil instead of the regular sort, and it added an intriguing citrusy note that was really delicious. Also added some baby lettuce leaves. The result looked and tasted like a beautiful salad you'd be served in a restaurant.

The texture of the raw zucchini ribbons was surprisingly fun and crunchy. Instead of olives, I went sweet with some baby yellow plums I scored at the farmers market along with the zukes. A great summer salad.

I really liked this, and the 'raw zucchini' factor impressed other people. some people don't like the taste and texture of cooked zucchini, so this was a great alternative. I also used a vegetable peeler.

What a mouthful of flavors! It is strongly flovored, so a little goes a long way in the mouth. I would use it as a 2nd side dish, with the 1st side having a 'tamer' a flavor. I throughly enjoyed it though. Also, I did not have a mandoline or benriner, so I used a vegetable peeler and also sliced by hand. Any and all of the techniques would work just fine.

I made this last night- the lemon zest and herbs don't quite go with the zuchinni...I've made much better salad combos before. I was bummed because it sounded good. Not sure how to change it to get it right, so I am moving on...

I was skeptical of the raw zucchini, but it was great. After I cut up the zucchini it looked like far too much, so I only used about 1/3 of it. I also doubled the dressing. Next time, replace the frisee with another green. the flavors were excellent, just needed some alterations.

I made this salad tonight to go with some burgers on the grill. It was great! My husband wasnt crazy with the herbs in the dish, they can very easily be omitted. I used a "gourmet mix" of lettuces which included radicchio in the mix as well as frisee. The dressing may have been thick but no trouble at all, I left it that way. I may try grilling the zucchini next time! Definately a keeper!

My husband came home with zucchini and venison burgers last night and I decided I wanted something cold to accompany our meal. This was a lovely side and friend we had dining with us had several additional helpings. The combination of the fresh torn herbs with the zuchini and the lemony caesarish dressing is very nice. I found the dressing a little thick so I added a touch of white wine vinegar to thin it. Also, I am living in England and I don't have access to French endive at my supermarket so I used a mix of spinach, watercress, and arugula and it was very good. A change from the normal summer salad... love those olives!
