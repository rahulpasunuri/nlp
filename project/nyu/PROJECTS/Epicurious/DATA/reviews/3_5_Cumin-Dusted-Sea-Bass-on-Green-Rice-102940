I thought this recipe was outstanding! The lime and molasses sounds weird but is an amazing mixture of flavors. I didn't add the chicken broth...too much sodium but added water instead and the grated peel of one of the limes. The cumin isn't overpowering either. I've made this with salmon and it too was delicious. This searing of filets in a pan and then completing cooking in the oven is my new way to cook fish.

I was curious about this after reading it and had the ingredients available. Being in Florida I had fresh frozen grouper and used it instead. I don't buy or order Chilean Sea Bass since it is overfished. Any way the rice was great as outlined. I changed the fish cooking a bit. My grouper was about one inch thick and using the 10 min per inch rule, cooked it that long TOTAL and it was perfect. I don't believe in searing anything on one side only. So I did both sids for 3 minutes and then a 450 degree oven for four. I agreed with other reviewers that sauce need another 1/2-1 tsp of cornstarch. The blandness was corrected easily with a little bit of salt.

It really came out moist and flavorful. We loved it. I went to the farmer's market and the fishmonger had flounder, so i used 3/4 lb of flounder and followed the recipe otherwise. came out perfect. the side that cooks DOWN in the oven comes out a little bit more well done, but it didn't effect the taste.

This isdelicious! The Sea Bass is crusty on the outside, very tender and moist on the inside. The sauce is something different, compliments the fish to perfection. Will defenitely, do it again!

This Recipe was soooo delicious and surprisingly easy. I chose it simply because I had all of the ingredients (except molasses--subbed in dark Karo syrup). I had it all prepped and then read the reviews so I was nervous about the sauce overpowering the dish. It didn't. It complemented it perfectly. Maybe it was the karo syrup instead of the molasses, maybe it's that we don't mind strong flavors in foods, not sure. I do think that using the sauce sparingly at first is a great suggestion and then add more if you like it. My husband kept raving and then said this was in my top ten of all time best meals I've ever made. I had some sauteed snow peas on the side as a veggie. would make this over and over and definitely for company.

Sorry - I have to disagree. This recipe seemed to have great potential with the blend of cumin and molasses flavors. I found the sauce to be bland. As other reviewers have noted the sauce needs more cornstarch. I subbed arrowroot and used 2 teaspoons. There are other nice fish/sauce recipes on this site that are much better. Pass on this one.

This is so easy and delicious. Followed receipte exactly, except to cook fish longer. We do not like the fish to be loose, and prefer it to be cooked well. I served this to company and they really enjoyed it too. Rice complements the meal and the sauce is a must!

Excellent results first time through with this one. One change we made to accommodate ingredients was to use couscous in place of rice. Threw the onions and garlic into the boiling water ahead of time, then added the parsley and cilantro after fluffing the finished couscous. The sauce didn't thicken as well as we expected, but it was a very nice complement to the cumin, salt and pepper crusted on the filet.

I am a PC cooking in the Savannah, GA area.I first used this when it first came out (the entire menu) and as late as last week. I win new clients everytime I make it so it has become the signature dish in my group of impressive dinners. Not one person has told me they did not like it. As a matter of fact I always make more for those who want seconds.I can always count on BA & Gourmet to give me great recipes/dinner choices. Thank you!

Yuk. I really didn't like this and won't make again. The fish cooked too fast on the stove--I took it off within two minutes. The flavor was dull. The sauce never thickened and the flavor was unpleasant.

This dish was excellent (with changes). Following the other reviewers, I made some changes that added to the flavor.The rice is great. I can see it being used for lots of different meals. For the rice, I used chicken stock instead of water and caramelized the onion and garlic in a small amount of olive oil before adding the stock and rice. The fish was perfectly cooked following the recipe at 7 minutes in my 450 degree convection oven. After reading all the reviews, I was concerned about the molasses being too overwhelming, so I used 1 tbsp molasses and 1 tbsp of honey. I didn't have any limes, so I used fresh squeezed orange juice. This balanced out the sweetness of the molasses/honey in a little subtler way than lime might have. Also, I added a dash of soy sauce and hoisin sauce for complexity. YUM! Sauce is perfect for use on the fish and I had it today on some sliced turkey--a little sweet but not at all overwhelming. Perfect for lots of dishes. All in all, a make again dish. My husband doesn't like sea bass but really thought this was a great dish and since I love sea bass, I'll be sure to do it again when I can. Just wish sea bass wasn't so overfarmed! Makes me feel a little guilty. But as others have written, this recipe would work well with other fish also.

I tested this recipe at home on the family to decide whether I should use it for an upcoming catering event. I used brown jasmine rice and liked the results. Would use broth next time to impart more flavor. Really liked the cumin on the fish, which I sprinkled liberally on fresh halibut steaks. Important to get a good sear on the fish to seal in the juices. It was unanimous that we didn't care for the sauce. Flavors didn't compliment, and actually overpowered the cumin. Deglazing the pan with lime, and a splash of pinot gris might be nice, or a tropical salsa for a little sweetness and to counter the salt, would work also.

I made this with a new fish in my market called Monchong. The fish and sauce was pretty good, the sauce is strange but it works somehow. I really didn't like the rice but I drizzled extra sauce on the rice and it got better. Perhaps I "eyeballed' a bit too much cilantro. I will experiment with the leftover sauce and may try the rice will less cilantro.

I was skeptical about the sauce. Molasses didn't seem compatible with fish. There were so many favorable reviews, that I used this recipe with two beautiful pieces of Chilean sea bass. Figured I could always toss the sauce before I poured. But it all fell together beautifully: rice, fish, sauce. One thing, though: the recipe as printed in the magazine calls for 2/3 cup of rice. That was the right amount with the other rice ingredients.

I thought the sauce for this recipe was the only thing not proper. Be careful with the quantities of fresh cumin.

Tried this on a whim when I picked up some monkfish at the last minute. When I started to cook, realized all I had was "minute" rice, it still turned out great. Individually, each of the components was "ok", when combined, they were great. Picky Hubby raved (unusual for him) over the dish. Served with a chilled bottle of Cotes-du-Rhone....

I have made this dish on several occasions - a family dinner, a dinner party, and just because I wanted it. It has never disappointed, and I have had numerous requests for the recipe. As long as the sauce is used sparingly, it complements the fish and rice perfectly, and friends have reported that it works well with many other fish dishes.

We really enjoyed this dinner. You have to like cumin and cilantro to enjoy this one. We used Kingslip fish from South Africa as it is a meaty fish too. Our modifications included: Tai rice instead of long-grain American, no bay leaf, and some fresh veggies to sear after the fish is cooked. The green rice is good enough to make with other grilled dishes.

Tasty dusting for the sea bass- but avoid the sauce. We put chipotle salsa on instead and it was to die for.

Fish with cumin coating was blah--a waste of really good monkfish--though moist. The sauce, as others have commented, was weird--too tangy and way too strong. I do have to say that the green rice was terrific, though--a really good rice dish that I'll make again.

Tasty and super healthy!!! I cooked with Chilean Sea Bass. The fish was juicy and the rice very tasty. I was not a big fan of the sauce with its tangy taste -- too much for the fish. I did a more blend sauce just with basic ingredients and worked out well.

Chilean sea bass is rapidly becoming an extinct species. A better choice for these recipes is cod or halibut, which are more sustainably harvested fish. Unless the current demand for chilean sea bass declines, estimates suggest that it may be commercially extinct within 5 years!

We loved this very simple and quick to make recipe. Instead of the chicken broth, I put 1/2 cup of a dry white wine and I also added a egg yolk and the sauce was just simply delicious and enhanced the richness of the fish as well as the flavors of the cumin.

Rating: 1
This tasted fine, but the sauce was so overpowering (even with the molasses toned down, as others suggested) that I couldn't taste the fish at all. I felt like it was a waste of cumin. I supposed if you had a very boring fish that you wanted to create flavor for, this would be okay.

After reading other reviews regarding the flavor of the molasses in the sauce and the substitution of honey, I decided to use half the stipulated amount of molasses and substitute honey for the remaining amount. I didn't want to totally lose the "uniqueness of the molasses as a surprise ingredient". The result was delicious! I will make this again, but might experiment more with this part.

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe! I too used honey in the sauce which was the perfect combination of sweet and citrus to offset the richness of the fish (incidentally, I used orange blossom honey). I altered the cooking of the fish slightly for lack of an oven-proof skillet: I pan seared the fish (7 minutes the first side, 3-4 minutes the second) then placed it in a toaster oven (my oven is broken) at 500 degrees for about 6-7 minutes. The fish was so moist! For the rice, I used brown wild rice which turned out great. This recipe has found a place in my fish repertoire!

Following a suggestion from a previous reader, I substituted honey for molasses., which worked fine. A nice balance with the cumin taste. I used California brown long grain rice, which needs a bit longer to prepare, but adds some interest to the rice. Served the fish with haricots verts.

The aromas in the kitchen while preparing this recipe were incredible! It really had me psyched to get a taste. We were not disappointed. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using more cumin on the sea bass. The sauce is quite strong tasting so use it sparingly. I served this with a simple side of steamed broccoli to which I applied a squeeze of lemon. Wouldn't hesitate serving this to company. I loved that it was quick and easy to prepare.

The flavor combination in this recipe is great. I had to improvise a bit because I didn't have a few ingredients on hand, but I'm sure the exact recipe would have been as good or better!

I've made this recipe with sea bass several times for company to rave reviews. Each time our guests have asked for the recipe. The sauce is iffy; sometimes we like it, sometimes not. I add more cilantro for a fresher taste.

I have made this dish 4 times in the last month for 3 of my clients and my own dinner party. I accompanied it with the green rice, the roasted sweet potatoes, the chayote salad, and braised baby bok choy. I received a "standing ovation" from one group of 10 doctors and wives. the only disappointment to ME was the salad. I did not think it had enough kick to it - it was bland. anyone out there try this?. I am doing it again for a party in May and would like some suggestions for a really different sald to accompany this meal. PS: I am a personal chef in Savannah, GA

Outstanding dish but skip the sauce: it's quite inedible (there must be a typo in the recipe), and the fish and rice combination works so well nothing more is needed. Based on other comments here, I doubled the cumin on the fish, and it came out great; I dotted it with butter after broiling to give a slightly richer tast. The rice dish is the real find here: quick, simple, and wonferfully aromatic combination of spices and textures. Highly recommended.

Rating: 2
I'd actually give this a 2 1/2-fork rating if I could....it's a pretty nice recipe, and a good change of pace for fish. I'm not a big fan of cilantro, but keeping the amount low still makes for good rice. One caveat: halibut is a pretty mild fish for the molasses sauce, and can be easily overpowered. Use just a drizzle.

We had this for dinner last night. My husband like it, I didn't. I liked the fish preparation but it didn't have much of a cumin flavor. The rice was good & I may make it again. The molasses in the sauce was too strong. The Gourmet (mag) recipe called for 2/3 cup of chicken broth vs 1/2 in Epicurious. I think the 2/3 is right it may have helped dilute the molasses. Also, in the magazine it called for 2/3 cup of rice vs 1/2 in Epicurious but I think the 1/2 is right! It pays to look at the published recipe sometimes. I didn't until after we ate.....

I had never had sea bass before this recipe, and definitely will be making the fish again. However, I wasn't completely impressed with how the sauce came out. It was a bit tart for my liking, but went ok over the fish itself. The green rice was good, but unless you REALLY like the taste of cilantro i would suggest at least halving the amount. With a few adjustments to taste, this will be a favorite.

This was excellent and very easy to prepare. Definitely one that's good enough for company but easy enough to make for yourself. I used halibut and only had lemon juice concentrate and it still turned out terrific.

A bit difficult for someone with a TINY kitchen, but well worth the effort. I wasn't so sure about the rice until it all came together, which it did like magic. The sauce was tangy and a nice compliment to the fish. I might separate the rice and the fish and serve them with different things as I'm not sure they were a perfect compliment, but overall they were both fantastic.

I made the rice and served it with plain grilled salmon. The rice is very strong tasting on its own, but goes perfectly with plain salmon. I used a little less onion. Its naturually oily from the garlic and a very strong garlic and herb flavor.

It was delicious, however the timing was very tricky. I cooked the fish at 450 degrees to keep it more moist. The sauce was a big hit.

This is one of the best fish dishes I have ever had. I made it for three people and we all enjoyed it. The combination of the sauce with the cumin-flavored fish is outstanding. The green rice is delicious, and it would make a great side dish for many other main courses. One suggestion: take the bay leaf out before fluffing the rice. Will definitely make this dish again.
