Where is the three bean salad that makes this dish so worthwhile?

Great recipe, easy to prepare and healthy too. I used bite size pieces of turkey breast instead of chicken breasts and whole wheat tortillas. Left over bean salad is great the next day for lunch served over shredded red cabbage with a little oil & lime juice.

I have made this recipe many times, usually for casual get-togethers. I consistently recieve rave reviews, in addition to my own! Fresh and flavorful. In the three-bean salad I use corn instead of hominy....The chicken is really good BBQed too.
