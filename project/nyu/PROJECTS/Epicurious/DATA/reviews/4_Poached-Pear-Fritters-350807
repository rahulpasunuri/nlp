I made this with the following changes for a vegan friend of mine: poaching: dried lemon peel (1/8 tsp), 1 cup sugar, and 5 pears. Batter: 3 tbsp brown sugar, no egg, 1 tbsp arrowroot starch/flour. All other ingredients as listed. Did not glaze, confectioner's sugar topping only. These were absolutely EXCELLENT! SOOO delicious, I could not even believe it. I had left over batter so I just fried it into balls, and even those were a big hit! There were none left at my hanukkah party. Highly recommend!
