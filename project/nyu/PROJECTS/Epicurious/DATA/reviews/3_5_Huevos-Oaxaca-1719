Tastes great, but I wouldn't advise it if you have trouble with spicey foods. You'll end up spending Sunday morning doubled over, cramped, and praying to die. My husband loved it, though.

Get up early in the morning. Heat up the oil. (most time consuming part). Fry the tortillas. Very important to do this right. Most aromatic. The smell will wake everyone up. When was the last time you smelled fresh fried corn tortillas? By the time that everyone gets out of bed, the house will be filled with the very potent smells of this most wonderful dish. Note: Anyone that is not risen from the dead of sleep is not worthy of this dish. Warning!!!: If you cook this once. You will be expected to cook it forever. Bonus: You will be famous forever. Good news: It's easy. And you will be famous forever.

II'll be having this for breakfast again! easy to make. I've had something similiar before under the name Chiliquiles & I'd been looking for a recipe. Glad to find it.
