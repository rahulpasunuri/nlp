I was looking for a South American appetizer to make for a South American wine tasting. This is very delicious but I think I would change a few things. I would definitely not cut down on the salt as I took that advice and I had to add more salt later. 1/2 a teaspoon salt is enough for the rice but the lentils needed more salt so altogether it does need that extra 1/2 teaspoon. The onions sauteed with the aji amarillo paste were delicious but when I mixed it all in, the flavor was lost. I would double the onions and the paste for more flavor. The whole frying process was difficult for me. Maybe I wasn't doing it right. Maybe I would put less rice in the pan at the time so that I can get it more crispy. I think it may be good also without the frying at the end. It also took me at least an hour and a half.

Even though this dish is very mild (bland) I loved it! I didn't have any aji amarillo so I made a paste out of mini yellow and red bell peppers and a fresh jalapeno (maybe that's why it was so mild, I don't know how an aji amarillo tastes). I used brown rice instead of the white. The only thing I would change is to cut way down on the salt. I wish I would have made a double batch because it took me nearly an hour and a half to make.

So easy and will make again. I was skeptical about getting the jar of aji amrillo, but my dad and husband LOVED it and used extra on the peruvian grilled chicken and mixed in this dish. To make this really healthy, use brown rice. We will eat leftovers wrapped in the homemade tortilla recipe from this site that is AMAZING! :) Enjoy!

I made this on a night when I was short on time and my cupboards seemed bare - I had all the ingredients but the paste. I used New Mexico chile pepper (ground) instead. I loved it and so did my family. Will definitely add this to my rotation. I will be looking for the paste for next time to get the authentic flavor.

I just made this to serve with peruvian chicken I am roasting. This is delicious! I had to make my own aji amarillo paste, but well worth the effort.

This was wonderful! Thanks to the advice from other reviews, I made the rice and lentils a day earlier while making that day's dinner. That made it a fast, filling meal. I substituted tabasco for the chile paste because that's what I had on hand but was a little disappointed. I have added chile paste to my next grocery list. I finished the dish with a sprinkle of lime juice then topped it with diced tomatoes and feta. A little chopped parsley or spinach would have been good, too.

Excellent taste and texture, and filling and nutritious too! I served with an onion salsa --- thinly sliced onion, olive oil, lime juice, salt, pepper and garlic.

I love this recipe. So simple and good. I served with aji de gallina, a recipe similar to the one on this site. Wow, super differend and delicious! Made the rice and lentils early in the day and I think that helps making things smooth. Double the recipe and glad I did.

Great vegetarian dish - i ate it with feta and tomatoes to give it more moisture. also didn't give it 4 forks because it took sort of a long time. but wonderful! mine didn't look at all like the picture though.

This was fantastic! I would recommend making the lentils and rice ahead of time so that final step (of frying it all together) doesn't take long. We mixed in scrambled eggs at the end. Mmmm. mmmm. good.

Definitely won't be the last time I make this recipe. Easier to make than it looks. The aji paste added a subtle but amazing taste. I will probably add more next time.

Loved it. I have been looking for this recipe ever since coming home from 18 months in Peru. I used brown rice cooked for 1 1/2 to 3 hours in organic chicken broth, for a more healthy version. Also soaked the lentils overnight in water to cover plus 2 T of whey. I think that using another kind of hot sauce in a pinch is a great idea, but to get the truly Peruvian taste of the dish you simply must have ají mirasol. Any good mexican supply should have it. Sometimes I have found the frozen ají peppers, which you can puree in the blender or food processor, and this makes a good substitute when you cannot find the bottled paste.

So simple, doesn't take too much active cooking time ... but delicious! The crispy bits of lentil and rice are really what make it. Made it a couple times now, once for company, and it's been a hit each time. You can of course use any color of lentil to provide a different color scheme, though there will always be browned bits from the frying. If making with brown rice, use green lentils or some other color to keep it visually interesting. I would say this serves 4 - 6 if it's the primary accompaniment to the main dish. Because it's so good, I recommend doubling the recipe and refrigerate half to cook up fresh a day or two later (the frying step is fast, so make a big batch on the weekend and fry up what you want on a weeknight). Have never bothered looking for the aji paste it calls for, instead I substitute whatever hot sauce I have around, use more garlic, and definitely add some salt when mixing things together. You can also toss in other vegetables with the onions or later.

This is a very nice recipe. I did not give it four forks because it requires quite a lot of effort, but the result is a rather simple, staple dish. I simplified it a bit by reducing the last frying stage to three minutes without stirring, but still there was a lot to do. Even though I did not have ají amarillo and did not add any substitutes, it turned out very pleasant and balanced. I will definitely make it again.
