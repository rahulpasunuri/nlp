This was a wonderful first attempt at focaccia bread! I used 3 C whole wheat flour instead of white and the dough was still pretty dry, I ended up adding an extra 1/4 C water. The purists will scoff but I did NOT go and buy a bunch of fancy cheeses (although I do not doubt the bread would be extra delighful with it) instead I finished mine with a pre-shredded 4 cheese "Italian Blend". I know; horrors. I also sprinkled chopped fresh rosemary and pepper over it all before I baked it and the bread was fabulous dipped in olive oil and balsamic as an appy before dinner. I'll make it again!

I have made this recipe exactly as published for years for our annual holiday party. Our guests love and look forward to it. The dough may be a bit dry at first, but I've never found a need to add more water to get the cheese to incorporate properly. I typically have to go to a local cheese shop to get the proper kind of gorgonzola. The 'dolce' variety, commonly found in supermarkets, is too soft to crumble. It is well worth the little extra trouble!

This bread is great - with or without the cheese on top! The cheese does get browned and crispy. It does require more water to make the dough stay together. Add additional warm water after you've added the flour and before you start kneading. It will take about 1/4 cup. Add just enough until the dough starts to stay together - and then quit.

Not enough liquid for the amount of flour with cheese here. My husband took the resulting cannonball, added water and more yeast - I don't know what will result yet. I went back to the first Parmesan focaccia, and put all the cheeses on top - smells and tastes great!

If you like cheese this is the dish for you. I substituted different cheeses. I used White Cheddar and Gruyere instead of Fontina and Gorgonzola. I couldn't find either at the store.
