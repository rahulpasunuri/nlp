Yuck! What a mess. Despite keeping squash and potato firm, it turned into a gloppy mess by the time I was done, with no real flavor. 3/4 inch pieces were way too big for "hash". And the artichoke hearts just seemed totally out of place. Huge amounts of food wasted - everyone in my family, not picky eaters, basically refused to eat it.

For a quick, easy, and satisfying meal on a cold day, this dish was perfect. We also substituted zucchini, mushrooms and carrots in place of some of the squash, and we used unpeeled baby potatoes for less "mushy" results.

I can't imagine finding this marvelous dish bland. The flavor of the tarragon marries beautifully with the chicken and winter vegetables -- for a simply one-dish meal, you really can't go wrong. I made this dish when it was first published in Bon Appetit, and was delighted to find it again. Do take the advice below, though, and don't over-cook the vegetables at the beginning to avoid a mushy dish.

We cut this recipe in half and maybe we forgot something, but it was so bland and looked gross. I only ate it because I was hungry, and I couldn't eat it reheated the next day. I would not make it again. If you like squash, try the stuffed acorn squash with wild mushrooms and cranberries...quick and delicious!

This was great! It was very flavorful. Next time I am going to halve the recipe...it makes alot! Be careful not to overboil the potatoes and squash at the beginning. It will get kind of mushy otherwise.

I've made this for dinner and for Sunday brunch. It's a wonderful dish that tastes like you spent hours, but is easy to prepare. I've also added and substituted: fresh zucchini sauteed with the chicken instead of butternut squash is yummy; mushrooms are a nice addition. So use your imagination!
