Everyone seemed to enjoy this cake much better on the second day. So the second time I made it, I baked the cake a day ahead. Everyone loved it! Also, I substituted almonds for hazelnuts the second time. Both nuts were tasty. Maybe next time I'll try a combination of the two!

I just took these out of the oven and I'm having a hard time not eating them all. I used tiny decorative molds to get a more authentic 'financier' feel, but the cooking time was still 40-45 min. I also subbed 1/3 cup of WW pastry flour and used almond flour instead of hazelnuts because I had it handy. The financier is everything you expect...dense and fluffy with a warm nutty flavor. The pear was very nice, but I found the cranberry a little too tart. I think cranberry might be better with something more like a spice cake mix, something to balance the flavor. The pear and almond were so light and then just these bright globs of tart in the middle...a little odd. Maybe hazelnut mellows it more, but I'm skeptical. Still, an awesome recipe with or without cranberries.

This has become a favorite. Guests request it. Haven't allowed myself to try it with whipped cream for health reasons but I'm sure it would be even lovelier.

I've made this cake on many occasions and it is always a hit. It's fairly easy to make, comes out light, not too sweet and is different from the usual fare.
