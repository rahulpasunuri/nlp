(Summer_luvin)My husband & I loved it. I doubled the sauce & the soy to beef as well. I went light on the sugar, didn't add salt and only used 1 tbsp. corn starch. I had sherry vinegar so that is what I used, but only 1 tbsp in the doubled sauce. I also carmelized onions, carrot & red peppers before I cooked the steak. Then I added mushrooms with the broccoli which I cut up into small pieces, so it cooked quickly. The flavors were layered and delicious.

I was so surprised and happy with how flavorful and delicious this recipe turned out. Like many other reviewers, I tripled the marinade and doubled the sauce (I had about 1.5-1.75 lbs of meat). Can definitely leave out the extra salt in the marinade, especially if you are using regular soy. I'd probably add some if I were using low-sodium soy. Otherwise, we thought this dish rivaled many that we've had in Portland's Chinese restaurants!

Love, love, love this recipe. I found the prep to be most important thing about this recipe. Once done, it takes no time to come together. I didn't change a thing about the recipe. I love the flavor of the sauce. Can't wait to eat the leftovers.

Easy to make very quickly. Pretty tasty, but I wish there was more "pop" in the sauce. Next time I will add more ginger, garlic, and chili peppers. But totally worth trying and making it your own.

I don't know if it's exceptional, but it's truly very very tasty. It's a weeknight staple at our house, but we like to double the sauce ingredients and add more broccoli.

Rating: 3
I marinated the beef for about 2 hours with 4 cloves minced garlic, about the same amount of ginger, 2 tablespoons each oyster sauce and sake, and only 1/2 tbsp soya. Like many others, I added other vegetables - carrot, celery, bean sprouts, mushrooms and snap peas, cooking as described by the fine Chop Suey (Gourmet, March 2002)recipe.

Kinda disappointed. Hoping for more of a flavor explosion in my mouth. Will try again doubling ginger and garlic and maybe double the sauce like other reviewers suggested. Definately will be adding oyster sauce for that missing depth.

Rating: 4
Easy. And an excellent way to use up miscellaneous vegetables like the mushrooms and bell pepper that I added. Sauteed these between the beef and steaming the broccoli. Per the other reviews, I too doubled the sauce and cut it with lite soy sauce. Rivals any restaurant version of the same dish...

I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe and would definately recommed it. I also added mushrooms and baby corn which the kids love.

I've made this meal many times now as one of my quick weeknight meals. The garlic burns easily when adding it with chili and ginger, so I add the garlic right before the broccoli. I also throw in left-over veggies like mushrooms and peppers, which is delicious and adds to the color of the dish.

Rating: 3
I enjoyed this recipe very much. A few comments: Like other reviewers suggested I doubled the sauce and there was still just enough- so DEFINITELY double it. Also I found this to be a bit salty, next time I will omit the added salt in the sauce and use low-sodium soy sauce. Finally my broccoli took far longer to steam then the recipe states, but I don't like it too crunchy. Anyway this is a solid weeknight dinner that I will certainly make again.

Rating: 1
OK recipe but missing one extremely important beef & broccoli component: oyster sauce. I left out the salt in the maranade and left the sherry/scotch out completely,with no adverse affect. Highly recommend adding 2 tbsps oyster sauce to the sauce and leaving out the sugar. Makes all the difference! I guess I would make it again, but my way! :)

Really liked this. As others suggested, doubled the sauce. Also used broccolini since it would cook faster. Topped with chopped cilantro and scallions. Yum.

I made this tonight and it was as delicious as previous reviewers stated! Using 1.68 lb. sirloin: for marinade, quadrupled the (lite) soy sauce and sugar and doubled the salt. In sauce, doubled the soy sauce, kept the sesame oil and the cornstarch the same as listed, doubled the sherry and sugar, and used about 3/4 cup of beef broth (made with bouillon cube). For the remaining ingredients, used two large cloves of garlic and about 2 T. of fresh ginger, 1 1/2 t. of red pepper flakes and the oil called for. I included asparagus pieces, red peppers, sliced mushrooms and carrots. I would recommend that these other vegetables be cut into fairly large pieces. My husband and I thought it was as good as any Beef with Vegetable dish we've had in one of the better Chinese restaurants!

Rating: 4
this is quite good for a home recipe.cut down on the sesame oil the second time around - otherwise it is rather strong. didn't feel you needed to add extra cornstarch, as other reviewers suggested, unless you want the gloppy panda express stuff. will make again.

Rating: 4
This recipe is really good. My husband, who is Chinese, quite liked it. After reading other reviews, I too decided to double the sauce, but I also doubled the marinade for the beef and doubled the ginger (must be fresh!) because we love ginger and I wanted to make sure it wasn't going to be bland. The only thing that I will correct next time is to not use so much cornstarch; like some other reviewers, we found that the sauce was a little too thick.

Rating: 4
Excellent meal. Substitutions used were 1.0 lbs of flank steak vice sirloin. No fresh chili or ginger. Used crushed red pepper as provided and ground ginger powder in lieu of fresh. Added remained of beef broth can (approx 1/3 cup) to broccoli to steam vice water because I didn't want to chuck the left overs. Guest quote, "Restaurant quality." Would definitely make again.

One of our favourites. Agree with other reviewers-- double the sauce!

Rating: 4
WOW, I loved this recipe. I used chili paste instead of dried chilis and I used sesame chili oil instead of the sesame oil. I even added extra ground ginger to the meet as it cooked and even more to the sauce. I also added onions, water chestnuts and bamboo shoots which really added to the meal. I think that we will definitely be making this a staple!

Rating: 4
Great stir fry. I too doubled the entire recipe because we wanted some leftovers. The only thing I did different was put the garlic and ginger into the sauce mixture and I used a small piece of beef tenderloin that was too thin to have on it's own. Will keep this recipe and pull it out for this years Asian themed Christmas party.

I have made this twice with leftover steak (which is great, because I never know what to do with leftover steak). The 2nd time I doubled the sauce.

Really enjoyable recipe. Just like you get in a Chinese restaurant. I doubled the sauce ingredients. Also, I used chili paste (1 tsp) instead of the fresh chili, and added it into the sauce.

I've been making this recipe for years. I love it and my kids love it!! I leave out the red chili when I make it for them.

Rating: 4
Followed the recipe as written and it turned out perfectly. I increased the sauce by .5 to drizzle over the rice To those who experienced tough meat: cut the meat *across* the grain into thin slices to avoid long, chewy strips. Also, if you add too many other ingredients (cilantro and mint?! OJ??), it detracts from the straightforward flavors. The less messing-about-with, the better.

Rating: 3
This is my staple stir-fry with a few changes. I substite rice wine vinegar for sherry, double the sauce recipe (and using a full cup of chicken broth). I use carrots with the broccoli, and steam them in chicken stock for more flavor. Substitute sriracha for chiles. It comes out a lot more flavorful, as well as being saucier, which is just a personal preference of mine. Overall, I quite like this as a base and think it's really fun to play with and substitute various ingredients.

Delicious! After cooking the beef there was a lot of brothy liquid in the wok -- I added the ginger and garlic and subbed chili garlic sauce for red pepper flakes to the broth. The mixture thickened a bit and then I added a whole onion, sliced into rings. After the onion softntened, I followed another reviewer's suggestion and used orange juice to steam the brocoli. It was excellent, and I'll defintely make it again. So fast, too!

Overall Decent recipe if you have all of the items and want to throw together. I added cauliflower & carrots w/ toasted sesame seeds at the end. I wouldn't seek this recipe out, but would figure it a good use for veggies that need to be cooked. I used sirloin that had been mostly thawed and sliced that up for the beef. I don't generally like heat, but would add more chili flakes than recommended.

This is a great basic stir-fry recipe. We make this a lot - try adding beef tenderloin - super tender, don't need a lot. Works with chicken. To address issues about blandness, add more garlic, ginger, hot pepper flakes. Tonight we added cilantro, mint leaves, jalapenos, cauliflower, red bell peppers, in addition to the broccoli. I agree with others, add more sauce. Don't be afraid to experiment - that's the fun of cooking! Do NOT add salt to the marinade, way too salty for us - ruins the dish. Easier to add than take out.

Rating: 3
Great weeknight dinner. I omitted the salt in the marinade -- didn't miss it. Also, used orange juice instead of water to steam the vegetables, which enhanced the flavor. Make sure the broccoli is still crisp when you steam, or it will be mushy by the time you add the beef and sauce. I agree with everyone that you must double the sauce if you want sauce for your rice. Definitely a keeper, and easy to make -- especially if you do all your prep ahead of time.

Rating: 3
I used jarred minced ginger as I didn't have any fresh on hand and chinese red pepper flakes in oil. I did double the sauce but also had a full pound of beef and we served over rice. Just the right amount. Very tasty and easy - took some beef and broccoli out for the kids before adding the chili pepper. My father-in-law had seconds....a rave review from him.

Rating: 3
This was pretty good. I made several changes though, I doubled the sauce and added about 1/3 pound shittaki (sp?) mushrooms, two diced carrots, and one small sweet onion diced. I first cooked the beef and removed, then I carmelized the onions and removed. After that I cooked the ginger, garlic and mushrooms together before cooking the broccoli. All and all it was good, but I would probably add more sherry and soy and a little less cornstarch so that the sauce isn't quite as thick.

Rating: 3
This is a very decent stir-fry recipe. Sometimes I increase the sauce by half and use the extra in place of the water to steam the broccoli. Yum!

OK, but a little bland--I wasn't surprised when I saw it is from a Gourmet of 1990 (ie not very current). It is good, and the broccoli in particular comes out perfectly cooked with this method, but there's nothing surprising or very interesting about the flavors of soy, ginger & garlic at this point. I felt it needed something else to really perk it up. That said, a good, basic dish that kids will probably like because the flavors aren't too strong. Maybe a good introduction to Asian food?

Yummy. If using all fresh ingredients, prep time is a bit time consuming, but worth it. I used low sodium soy sauce and decreased the stir frying portion of the oil, to 1 TBLS. I added strips of red pepper and green onion (nice color presentation). For sure double the sauce! Next time I will decrease garlic to 1 clove and decrease fresh grated ginger to 2 tsp.

This recipe is fun to play with because the timing in the cooking works for other vegetables. I used onions, carrots and peas; and they came out crisp-tender. The sauce and additional water makes this dish substantially moist; but not stewy. And the sauce is mildly spicy. I could see it working for any meat/veggie combo.

This was a great dish and my boyfriend continues to rave about it. For the marinade, I used Kikkoman soy sauce and so, did not add any salt to the marinade. I also did not add any cooking wine (didn't have it on hand) and it still tasted great. I added extra veggies to the stir fry, including 1/2 brown onion (sliced), and half of a green and red bell pepper (leftovers from another dish). You can really add any veggies that you like. Don't let the broccoli steam for too long because it will end up too soft by the time you add the beef. And for the final touch, I gave the dish 2-3 splashes of oyster sauce to add the little bit of salt that was needed. Don't forget the red pepper flakes! They add a nice kick to the dish- you'll also get a nice aroma if you let saute the garlic/onions/ginger on high heat and let them burn a little. I will definitely make this dish again-simple, flavorful, not bland like most beef and broccoli dishes.

As beef and broccoli recipes go, this is pretty bland. The sirloin works well, but flank steak will work too. I recommend using more sauce to marinate, and marinating longer. If the marinade is too thin, you can add some corn starch. This will also serve to protect the meat from burning while stir-frying.

Yum yum yum. This tastes like takout beef and broccoli, but better, because you can control the quality and cut of beef. This is so easy and delicious, it's been added to my weeknight rotation. Two things : I like it a tad saucier, so I multiply the sauce by about 1.5, and I also add a chopped red bell pepper in with the garlic and the ginger for a little color and variety. I also top with toasted sesame seeds at the end but that's just because I'm very fond of toasted sesame seeds. Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing!

I have been looking for a good, easy stir fry recipe to make for my Asian husband and our two kids. I've finally found it. This is the best recipe I've tried. Of course, I made a few changes: I used bok choy and snow pea pods instead of the broccoli, but it is the sauce that works so well. I would use any number of different vegetables every time I made it; stir fries are great ways of cleaning out your vegetable drawer! I think the things that made it so good were the fresh ginger, the pepper, and the sherry. Also, I used beef broth, where I usually use chicken broth. The beef broth made it more robust, and not so bland.

This recipe has been a favorite for years, adapting well to variations to suit seasonal ingredients and ingredients on-hand. The broccoli stems, peeled and sliced thin, provide a lovely cruch, while the florets provide a softer texture. Use fresh broccoli to get this effect. I always add two carrots, sliced on the bias and added to the pan at the same time as the sliced broccoli stems. Adding minced shallots makes a nice flavor, as well.

This was delicious. My husband and both fought over the leftovers. I was taking a class and came home to have some, and there he was eating it! I would definitely make this again. Next time though I will make more, so that we will have more to enjoy. Much better the next day.

I absolutely love this recipe. I make it every few weeks. After making it the first time, it has become easier and easier, so it is now a simple quick dish for us during the week. A couple of variations that I like: When adding beef at the end of preparation, add some fresh bean sprouts; they turn out perfectly crisp. Or, add water chestnuts at end. Also, I am going to start using real pepper I think - the flakes haven't been that tasty lately.

Definitely a keeper. This was a good, fast, and easy dish to prepare. I took the liberty of adding a carrot (slivered), doubled the recipie for eight people, and used a large red habaniero(just one)because I like a little attitude in my food. I also increased the sugar just a pinch. These additions made the recipie in my humble opinion excellent. For presentation I sprinkled it with toasted sesame seeds, the carrots also added some color. Next time I think I may add 1/2 cup of cashews.

Very ordinary recipe. Definitely not something to serve dinner guest. Its fine for Mon-Fri quick dinner.

My fiance and I both love Chinese food and when I found this recipe I knew it was my ticket. I made this once and he absolutely loved it! I now make it every few weeks as a regular thing. It's easy and tasty. Sometimes I substitute brown sugar instead of white and I cut down on the red pepper flakes because my fiance isn't as fond of hot food as I am, though I love it with the full amount. A definite winner!

This recipe is very easy (I had all ingredients on hand except the steak and broccoli). I was worried that the beef might be tough, but it came out very tender and flavorful. The broccoli was perfectly steamed and the sauce delicious. The only thing I might change next time is to double the sauce because I would have enjoyed having extra sauce on my rice! This will definitely become a favorite.

After making this dish, I can't bring myself to order it from local Chinese restaraunts anymore. This is simply better - no doubt due to the better ingredients.

This is really worth 3 1/2 forks. This was very easy to make and was so good. I doubled the sauce and did add about 1 tsp more sugar in the sauce and some sesame oil to the beef marinade. I also added extra garlic and served it over jasmine rice. I went a bit crazy with the red pepper flakes but it was good anyway. Extremely authentic and better than take-out for sure!

Great dish - I didn't have broccoli on hand so I substituted carrot sticks and badit beef and carrots! I served with steamed rice and my kids ate it up, saying it tasted just like "real chinese food". Easy,too. I made on a weekend and reheated for Monday dinner. good the second time too.

I prepared this dish for my family, and they loved it! I marinated the beef for 6+ hours, for added taste. I steamed the broccoli in an actual steamer and added to the beef and sauce towards the end. The only thing I would do differently next time is to add more suger for added sweetness. This dish will then be as good as the beef and broccoli served at PF Chang's! Enjoy!

I THINK THIS RECIPE WOULD BE HARD TO SCREW UP. IT'S RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE, EASY, AND DELICIOUS. WE USED CRUSHED RED PEPPER AND RED WINE, BECAUSE I THOUGHT I HAD SHERRY AND DIDN'T. STILL GREAT!

I finally made inroads into the goal of cooking food at home for my family that tastes like a Chinese restaurant. Raves from the whole family, ages 2-60! I listened to some of the other suggestions and increased the garlic but totally forgot to add my ginger and it was still tangy and tasty. Be sure to get an oil that will fry HOT without smoking (like peanut oil).

Overall, easy and tasty. I used 1 lb of beef, added carrots and onions, and served with "sticky" rice. I doubled the beef and sauce mixtures, and used remaining beef broth instead of water to steam the vegetables.

Better than any beef with broccoli dish I've ever had from a restaurant! I used beef broth, doubled the garlic and ginger, added 1/2 lb. shitake mushrooms, halved the sesame oil but added 1 Tbsp. oyster sauce. I also doubled the sauce part of the recipe so there would be lots to drizzle over the rice. Very easy and tasty.

This is a very simple and rather bland dish. I used 1 1/2 Tbsp garlic, increased the pepper and added 1 tbsp oyster sauce, plus 1 cup mushrooms and one small onion sliced thinly.

Rating: 4
Very easy and very yummy. Definitely scalable for a bigger crowd. I find it easier than other Chinese dishes since the preparation of the sauce with the starch is different, more American-y way of mixing sauce ingredients first.

This has become one of my favourites! Easy to prepare and a sure winner. It can well take more chili than the recipe recommends.

Sauce was delicious. Otherwise, it's a simple stir fried dish that could be used with meat or poultry.

Pretty boring, but yes, fast. Spice it up with more chilli sauce if you do make it.

Very good. Much better than the pre-made mixes. I aslo added a little Oyster Sauce and reduced the Broccoli and added Snow Peas and Mushrooms. My husband loved it but it was a little spicy for my one year old. Next time I will reduce the amount of Red Pepper flakes.

I tried this recipe this evening and I thought it was really delicious! I doubled the amount of meat and marinade and tripled the sauce recipe. I also added a small chopped onion and some fresh sliced mushrooms, which made the dish even more delectable! I thought it turned out perfectly and definitely plan on making this again.

Wasn't particularly impressed. I expected more from a recipe that came from the Constant Comment section. A little bit on the blander side for my taste; didn't have the "oomph" of the beef and broccoli from my local Chinese restaurant. Personally, I'd rather get take-out.

It was a bit over powering with the sesame oil. It was a bit on the blad side so I added oyster sauce which by the way made it taste much better. Next time I would add less sesame oil and more oyster sauce. As for the marinade, it was a bit salty.

For a quick and delicious dinner, this is it. I add more veggies, and up the sauce a bit. I have made it several times, each time with different veggies, and I am always pleased.

Very good, simple stir fry. We used tenderloin scraps and it melted in our mouths.

The sauce was very flavorful and could be adapted to quite a lot of stir fry dishes. I recommend increasing the sauce--you'll want lots.

Everything about this was "just right". I - for once - followed this recipe exactly, but I can visualize adding mushrooms, peppers - or whatever strikes my fancy. Will definitely do this again.

The whole family likes it. I like the crisp/sticky/sweet beef result. I added mushrooms that cooked with the broccoli and fresh sprouts on top.

This was easy to make and the beef was the only thing not hanging around the house already. I served it with a ginger noodle dish and kept the stir fry saucy so there was lots of good sesame-ginger-red-pepper juice to go around. I used Scotch and lots of garlic.

I really loved this recipe, however, I did make some adjustments which really improved the overall flavors. First, I used skirt steak, which is used in carne asada. It really turns out tender in a stir fry. Second, I added 4 minced garlic cloves and Hoison Sauce (2 teaspoons) to the marinade. Third, to the sauce I added another two teaspoon of Hoison Sauce and 1 teaspoon Hot Pepper oil. Lastly, to the food I added sliced water chestnuts and shredded carrots. Not only is this a delicious and healthy meal, it is also so fast and simple. I hope my additions add to your enjoyment of this lovely dish.

We found that the sesame oil was over powering in this dish. If I make it again I will use much less of the oil. Keep the heat low when adding the sauce mix to prvent it from congealing.

This was a delicious solution to ordering in Chinese. Actually, because there is no MSG involved or the mystery of whether they put it in anyway, it was better than most order-in Chinese. Doubled the sauce. Added in some stir-fry vegetables (frozen) the second time and it was yummy. This is a recipe that is versatile and definitely a keeper.

It was like being in Hong Kong again, the exotic aroma and devine taste brought back memories of eating in a fine Chinese restaurant in the old British Colony. Next time I will double the sauce.

I was initially dubious as the sauce ingredients were limited and I had a different beef and broccoli recipe that was nice. However, we liked the use of chili peppers in this recipe. I used chili flakes. I would make it again.

Rating: 3
On the suggestion of another reviewer, I doubled the amount of sauce, keeping all the other ingredients the same, and it was great. I used a saute pan but plan to get myself a wok, as my meat was a little tough which I assume comes from not cooking it at a high enough temperature. The flavor was excellent, though, and I will definitely make it again.

Picture the Beef & Broccoli you've had at your favorite Chinease restaurant, and believe me when I tell you this is just as good if not better.

I have tried to "wing it" to create this type of dish before, and was never happy with my results. So I am glad to have found this wonderful recipe, which has just the right flavor. I served it to eight people of varying tastes and everyone enjoyed it, even my 2 year old. I thought the ginger, garlic, and pepper amounts were just right.

Very nice recipe however found that 1 tbsp of garlic was too much. I will cut that back next time.

For something so simple, this was delicious. I had left over vegetables, so I added baby corn, muhsrooms, red pepper and carrots. Will do this recipe again! (I doubled the recipe for 4 but did not double the ginger or garlic or red pepper flakes...found that was sufficient)
