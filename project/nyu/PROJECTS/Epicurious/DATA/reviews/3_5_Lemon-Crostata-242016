Wayyyyyyyyyy tooooooooooo much trouble for what you get in the end. The crust is delicious and easy to make. I think it would make a great crust for a cobbler but IMHO there is only about half of the filling that you should have. Basically this is a crusty dessert that is fussy and not worth the trouble.

Wow. What an unhelpful bunch of reviews. Thanks, everyone. So, anyway--I thought that this was just an okay recipe, because the crust rather overwhelms the lemon filling. Be sure that you really finely grind the almonds if you make this recipe. For a good lemon tart, I would highly suggest the Lemon Tart with Olive Oil recipe from Gourmet--I think that you get a better result with less work.

This was very good, but I've made easier lemon tarts that were just as good. The crust was tasty and easy to work with.

Me thinks "jywharff from San Antonio, Texas" thinks too much!! Or has sticky fingers from using so much butter and got stuck on the "submit" button! (a little levity . . .) Anyway, sounds like a wonderful recipe--will try it next week.

I was very worried when I first started to roll out the dough, it breaks very easily. But it also patches very easily and the resulting crust is almost cookie like. This recipe is a winner and one that I will make over and over again.

Me thinks they forgot to use a space and meant 1 1/4 sticks of butter. Otherwise it would be waaay toooo buttery!!!

Sorry, you lost me at 11/4 sticks of unsalted butter. I can do math, but don't want to second guess why you didn't make this an easier measure.
