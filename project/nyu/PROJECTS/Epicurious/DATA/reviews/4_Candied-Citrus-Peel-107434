I made this over a three day weekend, and when I was done the final cook and about to drain the remains of the syrup down the sink, my husband said "surely you can find some use for that?" Well I did. I substituted the ~ 1 cup, very concentrated syrup for 1 cup of sugar and the grated orange peel in the Spiced Orange Sorbet, also on this site. It worked out beautifully, and now I have a quart of orange sorbet I'm thinking I will garnish with chopped candied citrus peel. The citrus peel itself I made to use in the Chocolate Panforte, and it is also delicious.

I love this recipe. This will be the fourth Christmas in a row that I have made candied peel using this recipe and each year, the people that I have given the fruits of my labours to have raved about it. Yes, it's long and a bit laborious but so worth it. For me, it's become a Christmas ritual and one I find oddly relaxing.

I nearly always go to Epicurious for recipes. I sorely miss Gourmet. They used exquisite care in testing and writing their recipes. Nothing else will do but Gourmet. I am late this year, but I will be making Panettone in the next few days. Why would I spend days making that, and use nasty candied fruit/peel? I have completed the recipe and my children are trying to eat it as is. It has been well worth it. No need to order from Paris if one uses this recipe and follows it!

This recipe takes way too long. I now use the "Candied Grapefruit Peel" Gourmet December 2000 instead.

This recipe takes a LOOOONG time but it's great! I was very happy with home my candies turned out. I simplified the recipe a little bit (seriously, it takes SO LONG) so it could be done in two days instead of, like, 4. I have pics here: http://delicioushouse.blogspot.com/2009/02/how-to-make-candied-citrus-peel.html

Very fun recipe - a bit messy though, and takes time! But the results are so very tasty... And I also dipped them in chocolate (some of them) this was a huge hit.

I have but one suggestion to make this recipe more, um, foolproof--add 2 tablespoons of corn syrup to the sugar syrup. With that addition, the hard texture that another reviewer described will not happen because the sugar won't crystallize nearly as easily.

I make this recipe every Christmas. It is a bit of work, but well worth it. Everyone loves it!

There is only one way to improve this recipe - instead of the final sugaring dip the peels in dark melted chocolate and let dry - ummmmmmmm

This was so much more work than the recipe I'd used before that I was determined not to use it again...until I took the candied peel to a family party and everyone raved about it. It has no trace of the acrid taste that can be present in other versions. One caution, though--I made the recipe on a very cold day when the house was very dry. After the final heating, the peel was and ready to coat in sugar after just an hour--if I'd left it out to dry overnight, I think the texture would have been ruined

I'm not sure that I can blame this on the recipe, but after a lot of work, this ended up hard and definitely not "gumdrop-like". I didn't have an accurate candy thermometre, but I did watch it fairly closely. I later read an easier recipe in Bon Appetit that only had you cook the peel once and drain it. I'll try that next time.

Although a commitment to make, this was a fantastic treat, and has been very much enjoyed by all! We dipped about half of the final product in milk chocolate, and rolled the other half in sugar per the recipe. We made orange and lemon peels, and cooked them together. This will definately be a regular on our holiday treat plates! With the time that it must sit between cooking times, it does take some pre-planning...or you might be waiting for it to come to temp at 3 a.m. like we were one night!

I made the lemon, orange and grapefruit candied peels over the past week. They really do make a lovely, homemade gift. Candied peels are quite a commitment but I think they are worth it. Make sure that you use a good, heavy wide pan and invest in a high-quality candy thermometer. I had to make the lemon peels twice because the first candy thermometer I got from the grocery store did not register correctly and the lovely yellow color turned brown as the sugar syrup started to carmelize. Also, keep a close eye on the temp. the second and third times you are boiling down the candied peels as the recipe indicates it will take about 30 minutes for the temp. to register 226 and 228 degrees, but it happened a lot quicker the last two times. Good luck and enjoy! If you love citrus, these are an excellent treat.
