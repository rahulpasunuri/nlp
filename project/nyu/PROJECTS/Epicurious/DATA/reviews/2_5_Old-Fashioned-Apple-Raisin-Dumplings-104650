Absolutely wonderful. I skipped the syrup and just poured the leftover apple filling juice in my baking dish and they came out excellent. Just remember to fold the corners tightly so they don't leak. YUM.

I was disappointed by this one as well mosly due to issues with lack of flavor in both the crust and filling. My last dumplings came out much better, I used my trusty apple pie recipe and modified it for dumplings. I did use the cider based sauce from this one, although we prefer to pour some warm milk over top (just enough to pool slightly in the bowl) and sprinkle a tbsp of sugar on top. That's how we ate them as kids and I really prefer them that way but after reading tons of reviews I think this might be unique to our family!

Excellent. Used puff pastry and boiled the brown sugar/cider mixture till it was slightly thickened before I poured it over the dumplings.

I tried this with puff pastry from my grocer's freezer. I add chopped walnuts and it was really delicious.

Yummy! Did make some changes though. Doubled the recipe and fit 12 dumplings in a 10x15 glass baking dish. Instead of using their dough directions, just split dough into 4-5 balls and rolled out like a thick pie crust. Cut between 4-5 inch squares. Didn't use raisins. Substituted 1/2 c. of rum for apple cider (i.e. 2 1/2 c. cider and 1/2 c. rum). This made it really good, but much stronger flavor, so we needed ice cream with it to balance.

This recipe was a waste of time and ingredients. It is impossible to make a 15 x 10 rectangle of dough that is 3/4" thick given what you have to work with. There is just not enough dough. Furthermore, there is too much filling. If you try to use all the filling, you can't wrap the dough squares around it. Other reviewers commented that the dough won't pinch together, which is the same experience that I had, even after removing some of the apple mixture from each square. The dough completely fell apart and wouldn't meet in the middle and seal. My dumplings looked like big mushy lumps. The flavor was okay, but not worth it. Make an apple pie or struedel instead.

I haven't made this dish YET (I plan to tonight), but I'm going to try some variations to make things go a little more smoothly. Rather than make the crust offered in this recipe, I want to use refrigerated pie crusts; roll them out slightly, cut them in 3-inch circles, fill them with apple mixture, fold them over and pinch the edges with a fork to make them kind of popover-ish. Then before baking, brush on milk, bake, then roll them in cinnamon sugar. I'll report back afterwards!

I thought this recipe was delicious! I made a double portion and did not add in the raisins, I also refigerated the dumplings over night and made the syrup the next day. They had no problem sticking together and dough was light and really fantastic. Many compliments!

I thought this recipe was pretty good but could be drastically improved upon. The overall flavor was good, but consistent with one of the other reviewers, I found that regardless of how much pinching I did, the pastry just would not stay together. As a result, the presentation was pretty "rustic"-looking (to be generous)! I soaked the apples for a few minutes in Calvados, which was a wonderful touch that I would definitely do again. Because the pastry is so difficult to work with and doesn't present itself very well, next time I'll probably make this recipe cobbler-style - layer the apples in a gratin dish, drizzle with the syrup, and cut out rounds of pastry to put on top.

My pastry stayed together very well. The syrup thicken good but not to much. It is best to serve at once if you don't the crust does dry out. The secret is to serve immeditely.

Pastry was too dry to knead as per the recipe so added a bit more milk. Regardless the pockets didn't want to stay together no matter how much pinching I did. They were, on the other hand, quite yummy so I would try again!

This was a delicious recipe but I would like to find a way to make it sugar free.
