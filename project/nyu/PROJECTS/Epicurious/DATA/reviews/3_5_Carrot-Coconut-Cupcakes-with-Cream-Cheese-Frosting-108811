I just made a batch of these for company coming tomorrow, and I only wish I had made a double batch. My husband, who is a carrot cake crazy person, said they were the best he's ever had. I opted on a regular cream cheese icing, as I had no white chocolate on hand, and did take another reviewer's suggestion of adding 1/4 tsp of ground ginger, and just a bit more cinnamon and nutmeg. I think it made a big difference. As others have stated, the texture of these muffins is incredible. Just perfect. Will be a staple in my house.

Most excellent, moist, tasty cupcakes. My white chocolate clumped when I added the cream cheese and butter, but I put the whole bowl back on a low double boiler and it got smooth again. This was really exceptional, but it was work.

I can't review the cupcakes but I made the icing and it's divine :)

Splendidly splendid! Perfectly perfect! Light, moist, tasty, nicely balanced. Absolutley loved them. Did cut down on the sugar a wee bit, but that's just personal preference. A keeper :)

These cupcakes are moist and delicious. The frosting is excellent with the lemon zest adding a wonderful flavor. This recipe is especially easy to make too!

These are moist and delicious, and fairly healthy! To increase the kid-appeal, I will puree the pineapple and grate the carrots more finely. I might also try equal amounts of carrots and pineapple to shift the flavour to carrots. Don't be afraid to add extra cinnamon and nutmeg. I made these for Easter dinner dessert for the kids and young at heart, and I'm happy to say that they went over very well. Enjoy!

It was good, and REALLY easy, but the pineapple was a stronger flavor than the carrot. I'd add another half cup of carrots, or try using a bit of a carrot puree or carrot juice. I also like my carrot cake to be a little bit spicier. HOWEVER, the texture was ideal and moist. For a different take on carrot cake, I highly recommend it. Also, I added a 1/4 teaspoon of ground ginger.

really tasty and worked out well as mini-cupcakes. the frosting is delicious although it made a lot. next time i will make a 2/3 batch of the frosting for mini-cupcakes .

shannondoug: I haven't made this recipe as a cupcake recipe yet, but I have made many cakes out of it. I have to say that I don't understand why you would leave out the pineapple. That is the secret to having it come out so moist.

I have to say, I love carrot cake, and I love making this recipe. I made it for work one day and everyone LOVEEEEDDDD it. I am still asked for the recipe a year later, and one of my co-workers made it 2 weeks in a row for family functions. The pineapple, the coconut, the icing. Everything in this recipe just makes for an unbelieveable cake! You have to at least try this once.

I reduced sugar by half and replaced 1/4c oil with unsweetened applesauce. While tasty, I feel like this is more of a muffin than a cupcake and it has too much going on, so if I made it again, I'd leave out the pineapple or the coconut. Not bad though.

OH MY GOD!! I've always enjoyed sweets and liked cupcakes, but let me just say these are beyond compare! Even without the heavenly white chocolate cream cheese frosting (that you could literally sit and eat out of a bowl...but I didn't) they are tasty and moist muffins. We've made these now twice in the past month and both times they have disappeared so quickly. As I have some sensitivies to nuts, I didn't put in the pecans, but I'm sure they would be good with them in. My one recommendation is that unless you're eating them right away, wait a little prior to putting the frosting on because with the moist cake then the addition of the frosting, it can get a little mucky. Enjoy!

I have made this recipe since I first found it in 2003. These are so delicious that they don't need the frosting. I add a little more to them, like fresh cranberries or blueberries. Everyone who taste them ,asks me for the recipe , I love this recipe

They turned out very well. I little bit on the sweet side, I'd suggest cutting down a bit on the sugar in both the cupcake and the icing.

I made these as muffins, no frosting, and got several requests for the recipe. Very easy, so moist, and not too sweet.

Delicious but very rich. I halfed the sugar and they were great muffins or w/the icing more white chocolate and less pwderd sug. Mmmmm. Oh yeah don't drain to much of the pineapple juice.

I was disappointed after reading the review in the magazine. These were just ok. I agree with a previous reviewer, there are better recipes out there.

I thought this was easy and very good. We had half for breakfast and iced the remainder for dessert.........must be served at room temperature for the best flavor.
