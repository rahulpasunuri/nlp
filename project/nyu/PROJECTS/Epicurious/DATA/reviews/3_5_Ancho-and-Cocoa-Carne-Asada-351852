Growing up in San Diego and loving the 24 hr Albertos, Aibertos, Robertos, ect... for their hangover crushing Carne Asada burritos and now living in Japan where Mexican Food is not a popular cuisine type, this recipe was money! Had a dinner party and put this out with guac, cilatro, onions, limes, sour cream, and pico de gallo and corn tortillas. It was one of the easiest recipes I'm made in awhile and so, so satisfying! Yum!

I made this for my son's birthday last weekend as he had requested 'Carne Asada' Wonderful flavor! I used skirt steak as recommended by others.

I used this recipe as part of a taco bar for my book club. It was quick and easy to prepare and we all loved the flavor. Will make this again!

Great rub,excellant flavor. I used it with flat iron steak. There was enough rub left over for another meal. Also had some gucamole (sp?) on the side, I plan on keeping the rub around.

Easy and a great flavor! I think the meat needed more salt besides the initial seasoning, but I added that after cooking.This is my kind of quick, high-protein, muscle-building food!

This recipe was so easy and delicious. The flavors were unique and interesting. I would have given it 5 forks if possible. I served it with sour cream and peach salsa. The only concern is that flank steak was not the best cut for this recipe because it was a little tough. I will try a better cut of meat next time I make it (which will be very soon).

This recipe was perfect timing as my 14 yo daughter was having a chocolate- themed party. I also used it on chicken breasts, and grilled everything. The kids all loved it! I give it 3.5 forks.

3.5 forks! Modified by using skirt steak which cooked in less than 6 minutes on a double-burner grill pan. The cooling time was just enough to make guacamole which we served with the coleslaw blend, jalapenos, cilantro, limes for squeezing and sour cream. Added leftover homemade refried black beans as a side dish and had the entire meal on the table in less than 30 minutes. Great meal, a no-brainer for a work night.

Super fast and tasted good. A nice combination, though the chocolate got a little burned on some of the ends. Otherwise a great recipe.

I've made this recipe twice and everybody in my family liked it. I added some salt to the spice mix the second time and served it with avocados, sour cream and cilantro salsa. The meat was a little tough both times, can someone suggest a way to tenderize the flank steak?

This was delicious. We added a little crushed onion and garlic to the rub and made a tomatillo salsa as a topping.

Pretty tasty, quick and easy. We also had it with the obvious avocado, tomato and cilantro salsa. Great meal!

sounds good, and am going to try it. I like the additions made by first reviewer, salsa avocado/guacamole. I Like to suggest using the microwave to warm toritillas. It's more energy efficient, and quicker, or do it the old fashion way. If a comal was not available, Mom used a non-stick skillet to warm up tortillas!

We liked this. It's a very quick preparation of flank steak. Was on the table in under 20 minutes. I only gave it three forks because I couldn't say it was "exceptional" but I definitely liked it and would eat it again.

This recipe was fast and delicious. I would use more salt than was called. I served it with avocado, cilantro, salsa, and a squeeze of lime. I also used skirt steak instead of flank, and it was even faster cooking time.
