Delicious recipe. I often cook with cranberries so was happy to see this recipe that is a little different from the usual.

We thought this was a great cranberry recipe, something a little different than regular sauce. Five spice was a nice addition.

I'm not a bit fan of traditional cranberry sauces so I was looking for someting a little different. This turned out exactly as I wanted it to, and I felt the five spice was a nice twist. I want to try some of the leftovers with pork too.

We made this dish for thanksgiving and it received mixed reviews. Some said they preferred the simpler, more traditional cranberry sauce-- but I LOVED it! I'd make it again just for myself to eat! I liked the extra bit of flavor from the spices. I think I'll always serve at least 2 choices of cranberry sauce, just to satisfy everyone's thanksgiving needs!

Big hit with all at the dinner and several people asked for the recipe. The nice thing is that this recipe isn't as sweet as other recipes and also the onions help to cut the super tartness of the cranberry. Agree with the other reviewer, cherries aren't worth it as they get lost. But is a definite jam and spreads on turkey sandwiches well.

This was good, but there are other cranberries I prefer. I made it because I was making the rest of "The Big Thanksgiving" Bon Appetit menu, and it did complement the other items well. It calls itself jam, and I agree - it's not as saucy as the cranberries I usually make, which is good, but was unexpected. The onions took on the flavors quite well - I was worried it would be too strong, but it wasn't. The cherries kind of get lost though, and they're expensive, so I don't think it was worth it. My preference is something a little more seasoned and juicy, but this is good for what it is.
