I don't understand the comments about the sauce being too thin. This is a sauce not a gravey.

Made this for Valentine's day dinner. Very tasty, great combination of flavours.. but also found consistancy of sauce to be a little runny. Still delicious, and would make it again. Having read other reviews, I'm thinking it may have had to do with pan being too hot for the red wine and having most of it evaporate before it could reduce to make it thick. Will try it again with this in mind!

The sauce was really odd and unbalanced...we ended up throwing it away and just putting a pat of the seasoned butter on the steak (which was nice, but nothing to rave about). The beef broth ruined what should have been a simple, classic sauce. I used a good organic, low-salt broth and it overwhelmed the wine and butter. Definitely not worth attempting again.

Any tips for keeping the steak warm while making the sauce? I plan on tripling the recipe so the sauce will take a longer time to reduce. Can I slightly undercook it and then keep it at a low temp in the oven?

Absolutely delicious! Made the recipe exactly---except did not add the stock to sauce. Reduced the wine--turned out perfect! I love pink pepper corns, they are almost sweet! Highly recommend this recipe.

I made this for dinner last night and my husband and I both loved it. Granted, I did make some substitutions since I had no pink peppercorns or fresh thyme on hand. (Used black peppercorns and dried thyme.) The steak came out perfectly and was melt in your mouth tender. Surprisingly, the crushed peppers were not overpowering. The sauce was sublime. The trick to getting it to thicken is to add the peppercorn butter slowly, whisking until just combined after each addition. Then remove from heat and correct seasonings. We will make this again, next time with pink peppercorns and fresh thyme. :-)

Didn't love this one- thought the sauce was not very good. Too runny and didn't compliment the steak. Loved the cooking method for the steak, which was excellent all on it's own!

Great Steak. Sort of. Maybe not.

I made this for my sweetheart on Valentine's Day. It was OK, but IMO not worth the trouble, I won't make it again. The sauce was too runny, but it did have a good flavor. I wished I had thought of the corn starch idea. The biggest hassle was finding pink peppercorns, no stores in my area had them. I ended up buying a big jar of assorted peppercorns and picking out the pink ones, very tedious, but I think there was a different flavor than expected if I had just used regular peppercorns. Yes, you need to wait a bit for the pan to cool before adding the wine, which means the meat will be cold when you go to serve.

Flavors were great. I'd agree with the other reviewers on the quantity of sauce. Half the amount is plenty for the 10oz portion of meat.

Not bad, but I also had issues in getting the sauce to thicken. Eventually added some corn starch and it worked. But I do have to say - and maybe this goes without saying for those of you that cook often - the recipe doesn't say to reduce the heat before adding the red wine into the pan, but I would recommend it. My hubby and I made this together for Valentine's Day dinner, and when we began to add the wine in the pan it was way too hot and red wine exploded all over our kitchen! Needless to say, not the most romantic Valentine's Day when I am washing the floor and wiping the walls and ceiling down after dinner :S Again, maybe most people would know this, but I don't normally cook steak or even cook with wine. So just thought I'd worn anyone considering making this dish.

I bought two one-pound steaks for four people, effectively tripling the recipe. I doubled the peppercorn butter and the pan sauce, and still had way more than we needed -- multiplying by 1.5 would have been plenty. This was really good even with supermarket-grade New York steak, and I think it would be outstanding if you made it with a great cut of meat. Served with classic mashed potatoes and warm cauliflower salad. Yum!

To A Cook on 2/7/11: Five ounces of meat is a healthy serving. Actually, 3 or 4 ounces of meat is all anyone really needs. However, if you want to splurge on 8 ounces of steak, I understand completely. It will look sumptuous on the plate and there's no requirement to eat the whole thing if people don't want to.

another question - isn't one 10oz steak too little for two people?? I would think each person would eat abt 8oz. Please advise

To a cook from Boston-you just need to reduce it for longer, especially if you are tripling the recipe. It could take 10 minutes or more depending on your heat level.

I loved the simplicity and the speed of this recipe. The flavor of the sauce was delicious, however, it was far too runny for my taste. I have no idea how the sauce could become thicker, per the recipe (and per the picture). I cooked down the liquids well over the 3 total minutes in the directions, and it was still more like a "jus" than a sauce. Can't help but wonder if there is some ingredient missing here or was it affected by my tripling the recipe?

This is deeelicious, but very rich! I made it on a Thursday night, but I'll save it next time for a special occasion. I didn't have any pink peppercorns so I used black, and instead of cooking the steaks in oil, I cooked them in a dollop of the peppercorn butter! Served it with steamed carrots rolled around in the same butter, and Potato Parsnip Puree. Highly recommended!
