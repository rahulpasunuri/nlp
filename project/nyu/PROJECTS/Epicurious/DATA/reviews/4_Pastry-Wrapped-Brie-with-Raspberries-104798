Absolutely love this recipe. I always substitute a pie crust for the puff pastry. Just roll it out and fold it over the Brie. I use a small cookie cutter with any extra to add stars, hearts, leaves or whatever is appropriate. Use the egg to add them to the top. Gorgeous and delicious! The are never any leftovers.

Easy to make. I was worried it woud be too sweet so I adjusted the recipe. I used 1/4 cup raspberry preserves, 1 cup fresh raspberries, 2 teaspoons minced fresh rosemary and a fair amount of black pepper - still way to sweet. Overall a big disappointment.

An absolutely great dish. Everyone raved about this. I used enough raspberry preserve to cover the top, used dried rosemary, and added crushed almonds. One of the best dishes that I have made.

I didn't have any raspberry preserves or raspberries, so I made this with apricot preserves. Everyone loved it! I'll definitely make it again with the apricot preserves. I might try raspberries someday, but I find it hard to imagine that it's better than the apricots.

This is the first time I have found that my experience was significantly different from other reviewers. I agree with a cook from Santa Monica below, it was way too sweet and a waste of good cheese. I have made baked Brie before and I think the half cup called for is just way too much.

Wow, so easy and yummy! The fresh rosemary really makes it a notch better than your typical pastry-wrapped brie.

I mentioned in my review below that I had not used the fresh fruit in this recipe. Mistake! Now that I've tried it with the fruit, it's even more spectacular. Every time I bring this to a party I get requests for the recipe. This time I used the W.D. Smith peach mango preserves and put diced fresh peaches in with it. I also added lots more rosemary. This will be a favorite forever -- so easy.

I brought this to two parties this season and it was a great hit both times. I replaced the raspberries with fresh cranberries (finely chopped) and used cranberry preserves. It was a nice variation. I thought 1/4 cup of preserves might be too sweet so I used only enough preserves to hold the fresh fruit together. I wasn't sure if rosemary would go with the cranberries so I eliminated it. No one seemed to mind.

I have made this recipe twice for cocktail parties. Both times to rave reviews. Costco sells the best preserves made by W.D. Smith. The first time I used peach mango, the second, berries and cherries. I didn't add fresh fruit either time. It needs all the fresh rosemary it calls for and lots of pepper. This will be a favorite forever!

Love this! I use both sheets of puff pastry and dried rosemary and cook not as long -- lazy brie, but also a better result. More pastry (allows guests to eat it as an entity should they choose) and stays together better.

I made the pastry-wrapped Brie with raspberries today for my guests to enjoy while waiting for the main course on Thanksgiving day. I guess I didn't put enough egg wash on one corner because the top opened up a little. However, that gave it a little homemade appeal. It went over quite well and I am planning on making it again at Christmas, but perhaps with another fruit substituted for the raspberries just to shake things up a bit.

Rating: 4
I have made this recipe several times, and always to high praise. This summer I had fresh-picked blackberries, and they are even better in this recipe than the raspberries are (I use the corresponding blackberry jam). I also use six sheets of Phyllo dough instead of the puff pastry--it looks just like a gift package. If there were 5 forks to give...

Rating: 4
Very good. I made it with apricot preserves and the rosemary and it was yummy. Everyone loved it and now want it as a regular item for our family get-togethers. one note: I wrapped it in wax paper the day before and baked it straight out of the refrigerator. The wax paper stuck to the dough and the pastry didn't "puff" as much as I'd have liked. Next time I'll try to bake it at room temperature. Wonderful recipe though!

This is such a crowd pleaser, though I almost feel I shouldn't review it as I really just used the recipe as a starting point. Good Brie, wrapped in puff pastry with any interesting preserve will be a hit. My two favorites are fig preserves or pepper jelly preserves. No matter what you make it with, it will impress your audience and you will be asked for the recipe. Not to mention, it's easy. In my mind, that gives it a 4 fork rating.

This is something that is a huge treat everytime I make it, put on platter surrounded by breton crackers, grape clusters and pineapple chunks and the evening time with a good glass of wine is very nicely done, this is easy and surprisingly affordable! We used to have to go to a favourite bar for this, they stopped offering it on their menu, so I figured time to do it ourselves! They made it with sweet red pepper jelly...have to find a recipe for that...

I made this for Easter brunch and it was a huge hit and got lots of "oohs" and "aahs." I must say, though, that I changed it a bit because I didn't have any raspberries or raspberry preserves! So I mixed 1/2 cup of pecan halves and 1/4 cup of browned sugar and put that on top of the brie intead. I sealed the pastry on top, as the recipe suggests, then used another pastry sheet to cut out leaves and other decorative shapes, and adhered them to the pastry-wrapped brie with the egg wash (which I made with one egg and 2 TBS of cream). I actually prepared it up to this point the day before, covered it with plastic and refrigerated overnight. Then I baked it as directed the next day and it came out perfect! Nothing leaked out -- it was a gorgeous presentation. When serving, it's nice to cut the first wedge out of the pastry so the cheese starts flowing out and people know how to dig in.

Rating: 4
This is such a great appetizer, I am making it again for Thanksgiving. I've tried folding the pastry as described in the recipe, and as reviewers have described (sealed at the bottom of the brie)...I kind of like the way the cheese and raspberries ooze out a little when the pastry is folded over the top...to me it looks prettier that way. Doesn't really matter too much because it will be devoured in no time!

This went so fast at our Labor Day party and I served it last among several other hors d'ouvres. It was so delicious and decadent. My friend liked it so much she mentioned how good it was at a party three weeks later. It was beautiful on a platter along with fresh red grapes for garnish. Thanks!

Rating: 3
I could only find an 8 oz. brie so I didn't roll out the pastry and it was large enough to use some scraps to cut out leaves for decoration. I used only part of the berry mixture because of the smaller size brie, but next time will use it all. Thanks to those who suggested putting pastry wrap on the bottom for a better presentation. Looked and tasted great.

I wrapped the pastry so it sealed on the bottom. I also added toasted sliced almonds. Roll out leftover pastry and use any cookie cutter shape to add a special touch.

Rating: 4
This is now my standard appetizer. It looks great and very sophisticated, especially for something so simple. One thing I have found make this easier is to wrap the brie so that the pastry closes on the bottom (less cheese oozes out), but makes sure to cut vents on top unless you want it to explode. Another thing that is great is to substitute and equivalent amount of fresh apricots, apricot jam, and 1 T. of jalapenos...a nice mix of creamy, sweet, and spicy.

Excellent! I cheated with dried rosemary because I didn't have fresh, but it came out great. I might even increase the rosemary and pepper - it was closer to dessert than an appetizer but nobody seemed to mind! Mine burst despite the fact that I thought I closed the seams really well - cook it on a cookie sheet with sides because it will ooze.

For the time, this is a tough recipe to beat...looks beautiful (even if it bursts a bit) and was perfect for a late autumn party...great with toasted peasant bread slices. Yum!!

My favorite thing to bring to a pot luck. Ridiculously easy to make, and looks and tastes impressive. For a neather presentation, I lay the cut side of the bride down on the brie, then fold on top and flip it over to bake. This gives a smooth top which you can embellish any way you'd like. It always disappears!

Rating: 2
It was really pretty, and the whole raspberries were dramatic, but several guests said the rosemary was too strong. We served it at a luncheon, with ice tea. Perhaps if you served it with a strong red wine, the rosemary would have been less pronounced. The guests finished the brie with the pears, pecans and brown sugar--and only tried the raspberry.

I took this to a party last night where there was so much food, and it was completely gone. It got such rave reviews. I doubled the raspberries and rosemary inside and garnished with more. Had to make a little braid with extra pastry to cover the seam at the top. Be creative!

I made this recipe to serve with cocktails before a dinner party. It was a huge success! Everyone raved about it. While my husband and I were making it, he wanted to eliminate the raspberry topping because he doesn't like raspberries. I insisted on following the recipe as written. He loved the dish anyway and most people were suprised it had raspberries in it. The flavors just mesh together so wonderfully. My only suggestion is be prepared with plates, forks and a pie cutter or cake server. I tried to serve it with a cheese knife and gave it each person on a plate with crackers and it was too messy and hard to handle. Had to go back to the kitchen for the above items. I also used a slightly bigger brie wheel. It worked out fine but if I could have found a smaller one it would have been easier to handle.

I have made this a few times and I am always complimented on it. I did make it once with double creme brie and found it a little too rich.

Rating: 3
I couldn't find any smallish brie rounds, so I cut some normal old brie into small triangles, and wrapped them individually. Needless to say, this exposed me to the risk of each one of these opening up and oozing cheese onto the baking sheet, where it hardened into a mass of, well, oozy cheese. Served them nonetheless, and everyone agreed that they were very nice in theory, if not in practice.

Took this to a Christmas party where it was a huge hit. I used the puff pastry scraps to fashion a bow on top so that it resembled a Christmas package, then decorated the tray with sugared cranberries and rosemary sprigs, resembling evergreen branches and holly - very festive! I also had to prepare it about five hours in advance since I was travelling quite a ways to the party, and it was still fabulous. I might use a bit more of the jam next time, as I thought it could have used a bit more sweetness to it, but everyone just raved about it. Will definitely make again as it was very impressive, yet (almost embarrassingly) quick and easy to make.

This was a bit hit at our holiday party. The rosemary really adds great depth of flavor. I think I want to make this and just eat it for dinner!!! Fantastic and easy.

Loved this appetizer. Have made it twice now using reviewers' suggestions of using layered phyllo dough but made the filling as the recipe states. The first time I used 2 - 8 inch brie rounds and just cut the phyllo dough smaller and the second time I used one large one. A huge hit with everyone. Served on Carr's peppered table water crackers. Since there is quite a lot of pastry I think baguette slices would be a little overwhelming.

Absolutely delightful! Very easy to prepare and most of the ingrediants are already on-hand or very affordable. Substituted puff-pastry for phyllodough as suggested by one of the reviewers- you can find this in your freezer section in the grocery store e.g.Whole Foods (bake for 20 min and covered loosely with a bit of foil for the last 10 min), and used melted unsalted butter instead of Pam butter spray. Instead of adding the frozen berries, I placed the in a small bowl so that folks could add them to their taste. Served with water crackers (cracked pepper) Very good! Will make again.

Just like all the other reviews herein, I made this recipe for a progressive french dinner and it was a big hit with several requests for the recipe. Make sure that you take the top rind off the brie while it is still cold as it makes it easier to remove. Can make ahead and store in refrigerator for a few hours before baking.

I made this appetizer for 2 holiday parties and at each one it was a smash hit - really delicious. I didn't add the whole frozen raspberries as suggested by other cooks and I couldn't find the puff pastry sheet, so instead I used the phyllo (glad I used the later). I followed someones suggestion in another recipe; instead of melted butter I used butter flavored Pam and it worked great. I layed several (7-10 - not sure how many) sheets of phyllo, criss- crossing each one and spraying each one with Pam. Then brought all layers up and over the brie, tucking and trying to conform to the shape of the brie as possible. I then made topped it (looked kind of messy) with 2 bows from the phyllo. About 20 minutes into the cooking I lightly covered it with reynolds wrap to prevent it from burning. It was soooo yummy. I stop counting how many people asked for this simple and wonderful tasting and looking recipe.

Looking for some appetizer ideas for Thanksgiving; this was already on the list as it has a holiday staple since I first discovered it in Bon Appetit. As others have indicated, you can take some liberty with ratio of preserves/fruit. Don't omit the rosemary, it makes a difference. If you feel creative, make some cute cutout shapes with the scraps of pastry and place on te sides, top (stick on with egg wash. Leave enough time to cool (at least 1/2 I think) before serving as brie will run out of the shell.

Rating: 3
Decadent! Can be tricky to seal the pastry dough if you using wedges instead of a round. You might want to buy a little extra dough just in case. I'd also advise staying away from triple cream brie as it too soft for the high temps of the oven. The fresh rosemary is the secret ingredient that makes the dish and that most people just can't place!

I made this dish over the weekend and loved it! I garnished the top of the pastry with fresh rosemary and it was beautiful. I will only change one thing the next time I make it. I will leave out the whole berries. I thought they were a little sour, and everyone was kindof picking around them. I might also add some chopped pecans next time. Overall it was great. I would definately make this recipe again.

Can't have a wine tasting party and not serve brie - and this was perfect! I don't even like raspberries that much and I loved this! I used a large wheel of brie and doubled everything. Had to flip and tuck with the puff pastry but it worked just fine. I also cut "grapes" out of the puff pastry scraps using the lid to my salt shaker and created a cluster of grapes on the top. I then added two real grape leaves after it cooked. Added to the presentation. (I have also used leaf cookie cutters to cut designs out of the puff pastry scraps to add a design on top as well.)

Hello San Dimas, I haven't tried this recipe yet (though I mean to!) -- but if the pastry dough is 12x12, then it probably measures almost 17" across the diagonal. In that case, I think it should barely wrap around a 6"-diameter round of cheese if it's a couple inches high? Then again, theory does not always match what happens during actual attempts!

I make this all the time, and it is always impressive. On Valentine's Day, I cut the pastry into hearts with a cookie cutter and baked them with small chunks of brie on one side. After baking, I finished them off with a dollop of raspberry jam and a fresh raspberry on the other side of the heart. They were bite-size and adorable. I usually leave off the egg glaze and it still seems fine.

This was the most popular appetizer at my housewarming party, and very easy to make. I used a larger round brie (2 lbs. I think) and another pastry strip.

I will definitely make this again.

This was excellent. I think the hardest part for me was finding the round brie in my area. But answer this please for novice cooks like me - if your Brie is 6 inches in diameter how can you possibly get a 12 inch square of pastry around it? Have you forgotten to allow for the height of the cheese?
