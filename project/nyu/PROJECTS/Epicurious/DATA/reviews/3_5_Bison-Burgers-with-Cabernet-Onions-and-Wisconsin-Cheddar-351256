Delicious recipe, the thyme really makes it shine. I added ~1tsp/burger of bacon fat to help it stay moist.

First time in my life I have ever attempted to make bison and it was amazing! followed the recipe exactly...the only thing I added was my own homemade Aioli yum yum!

This was really delicious. I could have eaten the onions by the spoonful and normally I'm not much of an onion fan at all. I used spinach leaves instead of escarole. http://www.mynewlywedcookingadventures.com/2013/02/bon-appetits-bison-burgers-with.html

The Cabernet Onions were great! The Bison was tender and packed with flavor, no wonder they served Bison at the White House last night.

I used our elk. I don't know if I just wasn't hungry, but this was very rich. I'm wondering if it were the onions?

Amazing! In the directions it doesn't say what to do with the shallots, so I mixed it in with the meat. I recommend dicing the shallot so it is easier to form patties. Also I used fresh thyme (about 2 tsp), and a little ground pepper. I used an apple wood smoked cheddar, and we put these on the grill. They came out perfect.

Pretty much followed the recipe verbatim...and we all LOVED!!! Happy 4th of July!

Used locally grown bison and lucky enough to be less than 25 miles where Bob Wills of Cedar Grove Cheese makes the perfect Wisconsin white cheddar (you can get it if you don't live here: http://www.cedargrovecheese.com/)('tis a matter of taste and I love bleu and gruyere, but I'm sayin') served with locally made whole wheat buns and fresh thyme (the only modification I made to as written and it was a lovely subtle layer of flavor) produced the most divine burger. It just doesn't get any better than this, and then you get to polish of the wine with them. Ahhh.

My favorite part of this recipe would have to be the onions. I cooked them a bit longer then suggested to really get them caramelized. Wow they were good. The cheddar was also amazing, it was important to use the Wisconsin. Good recipe and somewhat on the healthy side.

Really liked this. I made it as sliders and had it with the mustard roasted potatoes, and they went well together.

We make bison burgers frequently as DH loves meat and watches his cholesterol. This is an excellent recipe. I liked it better than picky DH who prefers plain food (as in meat patties with ketchup...). The carmelized onions reduced with wine are fabulous; the really picky eaters may want to omit them. Quite aside from the onion topping, the additions of chopped shallots, thyme and salt to the ground bison resulted in fabulous burgers. I will add these ingredients to the burgers even if I don't make the carmelized onions in the future.

Grilled the burgers, which was excellent. You do need a HEAVY pan for the onions. I used a nonstick all-clad, and it was not heavy enough to keep the onions from blackening. They were still very good, I just deglazed early with some cab. Didn't cook them the full time or they would have been ruined.

I'm rather prejudiced towards Longhorn beef, having raised them. Also very low in fat. This recipe was delicious and Hubby liked it so will make again.

I don't mean to be picky but how does someone give four forks to a "Bison Burger' that omits the bison and substitutes skinless chicken sausage. Is it just me.

We were all in agreement, This is a great burger, but no one particulary cared for the wine and onion.So we remade the batch and grilled the onion and drank the wine! Other than that it was gooooood for us carnivores maximus!

incredible and made as written. you must try this recpie. we bought a large ciabatta loaf and cut individual "buns" out of it - out of this world good.

Big hit with my family of four. The only variation I made was to use a local cheddar in place of the Wisconsin white. I did have an issue with the way the recipe was written. My husband thought that you were supposed to serve the onions chilled, but that did not seem like it could possible be right to me.

This was simply delicious - I made mine with ground Penzey's shallot pepper because that's what I had and put them on whole wheat english muffins. The onions are divine. Next time I'll swing for gruyere, I think it'd really take this burger over the top.

These were good, but I didn't think they were as spectacular as others did. I will make them in the future, but probably try using bleu and balsamic.

This is the best recipe. I make this every week. The bison has the best flavor that beat beef burgers by far!

Delicious. The only thing I would change next time would be to add a bit more salt. Love the addition of the djion. Much better than an ordinary ketchup/beef burger!

This was so delicious! I don't eat red meat so I used chicken sausage without the casings and multigrain rolls. Loved it so much, made it twice in one week!

It's a keeper! A fab recipe for the complete buffalo burger. Onion topping and sharp white cheddar are perfect complements to the juicy, tender patty. Have made this multiple times -- can't get enough!

This was a great recipe. The onions really add to the flavor. I agree that the little bit of thyme may not make that much difference. I used garlic since I didn't have shallots, regular sharp cheddar and romaine instead of escarole. Also used regular buns. Excellent!

Very tasty burgers. The cabernet onions really add a distinctive flavor to the meal. I made the onions a second time with port instead of cabernet, and it turned out just as well. This recipe would be equally good with plain old beef.

My entire family LOVED this recipe. The only changes I made the second time I made it (the first, I followed the recipe to a 'T') was a swap out of the ciabatta bun for a traditional kaizer roll..instead of dijon I used Gulden's spicy brown mustard..I used wisconsin sharp cheddar because I couldn't find any white cheddar (didn't make a bit of difference and still delicious!).. and I 'quick' caramelized the onions by putting all of the ingredients together and covering them with a lid for about 10 minutes after the initial browning of the onions. Slashes the time and gets dinner on the table more quickly!

I'm not sure how much the scant amount of thyme helped, but the burgers were delicious, and the onions were a good addition for those carb conscious people who wouldn't eat the roll.

I've never eaten bison before but using this recipe I will again. To the reviewer who would use Swiss cheese, I couldn't really taste the cheese because of the strong taste of the onions. It would also be good without the bun if you are on a low carbohydrate diet

this is a great bison recipe and it's all in the onions. very healthy but wondering if swiss might be better than the cheddar?

This recipe is fantastic. Hard to find a lot of good bison burger recipes, though I guess most hamburger recipes can be adopted. I found a bison burger recipe here: http://www.foodaficionado.com/index.php?option=com_rapidrecipe&page=viewrecipe&recipe_id=4&Itemid=53 that turned out quite well. I went with the gorgonzola, but I think the white cheddar works well too.

The Cabernet Onions complement the bison burgers. Whole foods usually has bison - just at a high price. I try to find it in other markets for much less. If you haven't tried buffalo - go for it - 96 or 97% lean - unbeatable with a fantastic flavor.
