WOW! Where have I been? I just found this recipe and used it as a base for a lamb shank recipe and the risotto was more the main entree instead of the fall-off-the-bone lamb! Make it as is-- don't change anything. Perfection shouldn't be messed with :)

What's not to love about this risotto! If you love lemon this is the risotto for you. Will definitely make again.

This was delicious! I just finished it and I can't stop eating it out of the pan...I skipped the parsley, reduced the cheese and butter, used a yellow onion instead of shallots, and increased the white wine. My boyfriend argues that it is a little too lemony, but I think it is just right. Maybe next time I will reduce the zest to compromise...because there will definitely be a next time...

Wow! This was unbelievable. I made this a few months ago and had saved the recipe. I just found it again and now I can't wait to make it again. My husband is not a big risotto fan (what??) and he said that this was on the list of things to revisit. I did alter it a tiny bit by adding fresh peas. I just love peas in risotto and it was super. The brightness of the lemon cuts through the richness of the butter and the balance of flavors is perfect!

Rating: 4
Great recipe - will definitely cook this again. Only change I made is at the end of the cooking to take the risotto off the heat, sprinkle over the remaining parmesan and butter (in flakes), put the lid on and rest for a few minutes before giving it a good stir. That makes it even creamier. Then proceed as per recipe with the parsley, lemon juice and peels....

Outstanding. My first attempt at risotto, and it turned out great. Toasted the rice longer than 1 minute, and used a 1/2 cup more broth to get just the right bite. The lemon & parsley brightened it up beautifully against the richness of the cheese. Next time I'll try adding some seafood.

This is unbelievable! Turned out perfectly and was very light and delicious. I modified slightly based on what I had: used Meyer lemons, 1/2 c. parmesan, 1/2 c. mascarpone, and substituted fresh basil for the parsley. I also required an extra cup of broth. Yum! I served it with scallops, but I think it'd be great with shrimp, salmon, lobster or chicken. A keeper!

Rating: 4
My first time making risotto so I followed the recipe exactly. Took more stock, as others have noted, and way more time at almost an hour. Came out very tasty with a luscious lemon flavor, but it was a little underdone and slightly gummy. I have to admit I was unsure about the balance between "add until absorbed" and "creamy texture. I waited until the risotto started clumping and leaving almost no spoon trail on the pan, whilst stirring, before adding broth... Any advice on achieving that balance during preparation would be appreciated.

Rating: 4
I have made this recipe both with chicken broth, veggie broth, AND another time with herb bouillon cubes. The best was with the herb (it also gave the risotto a much darker color.) I always use a large onion rather than shallot. And I use dried basil flakes instead of fresh parsley. note: don't overdo the lemon, or the cheese for that matter.. i decided to test out a little more than the recipe called for once, and for me, it really ruined the fresh, balanced flavor of the dish as a whole. I have been told this dish is professional and sophisticated tasting, and am always asked to make it again!

very lemony. i would cut back on the lemon juice a little next time. however, it does lighten the risotto.

Wonderful flavor by adding piece of rind of Reggiano Parmesean cheese while adding broth. Increased wine to 1/2 cp, then adjusted broth accordingly. Roasted 1/2 pd Asparagus in 420 oven for 10 min with little olive oil and chopped garlic as someone else had done. Then added it at the end of the cooking. Did not add additional butter to reduce calories, and also did not add full amount of fresh parmesean cheese at end. Plenty rich with half amount used. It is easy to let this dry out by overcooking it. If you want it creamy, you need to eat it immediately. I covered the pan and brought to table. Ate it 15 min later. Next time, will bring it to table not quite all absorbed. It continues to cook while it is covered even if off the heat.

This risotto is just as appetizing as any other risotto that I have eaten in finer restaurants.

Delicious alternative to Risotto Milanese. I didn't have any parsley but it wasn't a great omission. Otherwise I executed as described. I also added a bunch of asparagus tips w/ the last stock and they were nice and tender by the time I served. I cannot stress enough how important it is to have enough mouths to feed cos risotto is nothing like it's usual gooey self when reheated. I really enjoyed this.

I've always been intimidated by risotto but this recipe was really easy and produced excellent results.

This was great! A very basic risotto recipe (at least it's like every risotto I've ever made) with that great fresh, subtle lemon flavor. Mine took about another cup of broth to get to the right consistency. Oh and I left off that last kick of butter to save a few calories and fat (it was plenty buttery as it was). Yum!

Rating: 4
WOW... first time I've ever made risotto, and this was better than I expected by far! I didn't even have great rice, just cheapo medium grain type, and it worked really well. I halved the recipe, ended up using like 4x more wine than recommended and a little less broth to compensate. I also have a crappy grater so I used more lemon juice and less peel/zest, and the lemon flavor was exactly what I would have wanted. I used an onion/garlic combination in place of shallots as well. I also upped the parmesan cheese a bit. Served it with broiled salmon brushed with butter and lemon pepper... amazing combination! I think it'd go well with any seafood dish. I think the key to cooking it right is to taste the rice... don't stop adding liquid until the rice is actually done, even if that means you're adding more or less than the recipe says.

I also used less butter and parmesan and it still turned out very well. I thought maybe it could use a bit more lemon flavor, but my boyfriend thought it was just enough. I mixed in some asparagus for crunch and served it grilled shrimp. It was good, but I think I'm just not a risotto fan so I probably won't make it again unless it's for somebody who loves it. It might be a textural thing for me.

This was absolutely delicious! I have a newborn, and I was holding him in one arm while I stirred, but it was WELL worth it. The lemon flavor was not overpowering at all, and it really complimented the grilled salmon we had with it.

It will be my base risotto recipe from now on, and I look forward to experimenting with new additions.

I loved this recipe. I made it in advance (only add 3 1/4 c. of broth, spread on a cookie sheet, and then continue the recipe just before serving) and it was a great hit. I only used 1.5 c of rice and 5 c. of broth. I was worried the lemon would be too strong, but it was absolutely wonderful. I'd like to try it with fresh rosemary next time. A great side dish!

This is a great recipe but like all risotto, it doesn't make for good leftovers. But it's a good ingredient in another dish. Try stuffing grilled chicken breasts with your leftover risotto, or wrap it in roasted red bell peppers for a starter. With this lemon risotto, I heated up some leftovers, added some fresh lemon juice and warm chicken stock and stuffed it inside a couple of whole fresh fish my husband caught. I then roasted in a wok on my grill. The lemon flavor permeated the fish. It didn't have that creamy consistency, but it still had nice flavor.

I've made this as described and also added items at the end. Today, I added arugula and some chicken that I had marinated in lemon and olive oil. The arugula is a great combination.

i liked it - its important to cook slowly so the starches from the risotto come out making it creamy - i like the parm cheese component - lemon zest was hard to create, would just get stuck to the grater - important to serve immediately while its still hot and creamy - does not reheat well, become sticky and kinda hard

Delicious! I made this exactly as written, and it came out beautifully in about 30 minutes. For me, it was the perfect lemony flavor. This makes a generous amount of rice.

I've made this recipe a few times. The person who said it took two hours definitely had the heat on too low, which would also account for the mushy consistentcy. A way to up the lemon flavor of this is to infuse the broth with some lemon peel before you add it to the risotto. You can also top this with some high quality olive oil, it also looks and tastes better with some finely minced parsley for sure.

Exquisite! I prepared a half recipe last night as a side dish with osso buco (also from this site). Oh my, I licked the pot. I prefer Romano or Asiago in many dishes which call for Parmesan, and so used the Asiago for this one. We usually do polenta, as it's so quick and easy, but this dish is transcendent and well worth the half hour or so bringing it along.

The reviewer who said it took 2 hours most likely had the temperature too low. I make risotto 1-3 times per week (and stock once a month!) and this one is a good member of the rotation.

This is a delicious Risotto recipe. I have made it twice each time using the exact ingredients. The first time I made it before my guests arrived and tried to keep it warm over a double boiler. The results were a sticky but tasty mess. The next time I decide to wait till just before dinner was served to prepare. It was excellent but I ended up cooking while my guest were there. One of my friends who has been to cooking school in Italy shared some knowledge she had learned there; prepared the risotto until having added 2/3 or 3/4 of the liquid. Just before dinner,reheat the broth and complete the finaly prep of the Risotto - Something important no one ever seems to put in a recipe!

After having a lemon asparagus risotto at our favorite restaurant I wanted to make my own. This recipe turned out to be perfect. I added asparagus to mine which was steamed but still with a bit a crunch, and then chopped into 1/4 inch pieces. I think it is a great variation. I served it with grilled halibut with the Lemon-Herb Splash (which is from the sponsored link from Redwood Creek). We had a Rioja wine which went beautifully.

THe lemon flavor was subtle, but such a nice compliment to the chicken dish. I will make this again. I used to use one of of BonApetit that used beef broth...I liked this one 100% better. My dinner guests had multiple servings...there were no leftovers!

Amazing, and so simple! The lemon makes this a perfect early-spring side dish. Goes great with fish (we ate it with salmon cakes). Would absolutely make again for company.

A friend brought lemons in to work so I've been looking for creative ways to use them. What an absolutely delicious discovery. Can't wait to try this out at my next dinner party.

YES!YES!YES! Along with the roasted salmon recipe also on this site, what a delicious and superb dinner!!! The tarragon and chives on the salmon, with this creamy,lemony dish were outstanding! I believe need to calm down!

Deserves every word of praise. Just perfect with seafood, fish or chicken. Without question, my favorite risotto. I've made it several times...including once when I added nickel sized pieces of ginger (easy to fish out at the end) to the oil at the beginning. It gives an additional layer of complexity that worked well for me.

Ditto on all the superlatives. Other than omitting the last bit of butter, I followed this to a T, and it was divine. I served it as a main dish, but my husband says next time we should serve it with chicken. Either way, it's outstanding.

So phenomenal. . I can't say enough good things about this creamy lemony risotto. I made it as directed, but held off on the last tablespoon or so of butter and added extra lemon juice instead. Wow, is it good. It's perfect alone for a cold night, but would also be great with the Parmesan Crusted Chicken.

This was incredible. The lemon flavor is just this side of intense--you get the zinginess, but it doesn't besiege your gustatory senses. Rich and light, I reduced the butter and oil to 1 teaspoon each--with the broth and cheese more is not necessary. I also upped the wine to 1/2 cup and reduced the broth to 5 cups. Sumptuous.

I doubled the recipe for a dinner for 10. Everyone loved it! The creamy consistency, lemony flavor, and hint of cheesiness were perfectly balanced together. It accompanied another recipe on this Web site, Pork Medallions w/ Mustard Cream Sauce (which I also highly recommend). This risotto is comfort food at its best. I'll certainly make it again.

This is a very tasty risotto and provides a delicious companion to other main dishes, particularly fish. Also, I used vegetable stock instead of chicken and it was still fine.

So simple and fresh...a wonderful dish to serve along side pan seared scallops.

Wonderful recipe! Easy, didn't change a thing.

This recipe was lovely. I made a few changes to it. I added 1/2 cup of wine instead of 1/4 cup and skipped the parsley in favor of dried porcini mushrooms.

This is the best risotto I've ever made. My spouse thought it too lemony (but still liked it) but I did not, I thought it had a very delicate lemon flavor and complimented the strong flavors of the proscuitto wrapped grilled shrimp and salad with gorgonzola and roasted garlic bread we had with it. Only changes: I used 7.5 cups of homemade onion stock as I don't like chicken broth and it took about an hour not 35 minutes. I used chopped fresh flat leaf parsley and I think I'll double the amount next time. I highly recommend this recipe.

This is really quite good. Try serving it with Duck With Port-Cherry Sauce.

I've never made risotto before but I wanted something to go with a new fish recipe i was making. This was so delicious. I omitted the white wine but didn't notice it mising. Very yummy and unexpected combo of cheese and lemon.

Delicious, delicate taste, and perfect when you're puttering about the kitchen anyway, as you have to stick around to add broth and stir. I, too, halved the cheese, and kept the olive oil and butter to one tablespoon each (watching our weight here!). My one error: I had chicken bouillon cubes in the house and used them in place of the low-salt canned broth, so the resulting dish was a bit too salty. It made quite a large pan of risotto, but there's none left, so that says something about how good it was!

I was surprised how much the lemon flavour came through the risotto. I'm glad that I read others advice and resisted the temptation to double up on the lemon, that would have been too much. This really is a nice side dish.

Just finished this meal. It was delicious, but I must add that I used dry tarragon instead of parsley (didn't have any and I don't particularly care for it). Sprinkled tarragon and lemon zest on top of risotto for a splash of color. It's definitely worth making again.

On a hot night (way too hot to heat up the oven), this was the perfect thing with poached salmon.

This risotto was amazing. Being a risotto lover, I was looking for a new way to prepare this dish. This one is definately a keeper! The lemon flavour was a nice change. I served it along side grilled sole with lemon-basil sauce. Rave reviews from all my guests!

Delicious! Served with Honey, Rosemary and orange pork kabobs and grilled orange peppers and pineapple. Guests kept saying MMMMMM!

Thanks to the other epicurians! I made this also with 1/2 the cheese and it was lovely. I roasted asparagus, served a simple crusty bread and a complex white. Despite the rather generous portions ( I cut the recipe in half, but it was still a lot), my husband polished it off and declared me the risotto queen. Grazie!

I have made a similar version of this dish which calls for stirring in the lemon zest after the first 15 minutes of cooking, as well as proportionally more lemon juice, and I find that this one is far mellower. My other recipe also includes minced sage, which adds a nice touch. Definitely, chicken broth better complements the lemon, as opposed to vegetable broth. A very good dish -- and lovely suggestion from the Pleasanton cook, who added asparagus. I have served this with roasted asparagus and it's an excellent choice. A little crostini, a dry white, a crisp salad = an elegant, simple summer meal!

Fantastic!! fresh, comforting, and full of flavor.I followed this recipe exactly, absolutly a keeper!.

I thought this was a keeper! Don't do what I did, however, which was to add more lemon juice!! The amount in the recipe seemed light, so I added more--what a mistake! Also, I added asparagas cut into 1" pieces to the broth to cook. Then, about halfway through the risotto process, I added all the asparagas into the rice. The blend of lemon and asparagas was awesome!

This was FABULOUS! I also used half the amount of cheese, and it is indeed plenty. I make risotto quite often, but my husband and I agree that this is our new favorite recipe. Served it with steamed broccoli, crusty rosemary bread, and a nice Chardonnay. A simple elegant summer meal.

I loved this rice dish..very fresh tasting and had a great lemon flavor. I listened to the previous reviews and cut the cheese in 1/2 and i'm glad i did, it was just perfect that way. Served the lemon risotto with a nice crisp caesar salad and grilled tarragon-garlic shrimp skewers. I scored big points with the single moms' dinner last night!

Nice new twist to Risotto. I agree with the other reviewer that I would cut down on the cheese. Mine as a little stiffer than I would have liked.

I thought it had a fresh Spring taste. But I would cut down on the cheese if I make it again.
