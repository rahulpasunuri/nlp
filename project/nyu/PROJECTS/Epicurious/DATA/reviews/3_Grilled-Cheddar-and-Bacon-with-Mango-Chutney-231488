I'm blessed with an overabundance of green tomato chutney, so I slathered on a whole tablespoon per sandwhich, and substituted sharp cheddar to stand up to the extra flavor. I'm over missing peaches with this yummy fall comfort food.

I love the combination of cheddar and mango chutney -- who knew it could be so good? If you're not sure if you're going to like it, slice the cheese onto the bread, toast it, and then spread on the mango chutney. This quick, healthier, vegetarian version will let you know if you're into this melding of flavors before you go through all the work of making the bacon.

I did not have whole grain bread, but I had made some homemade bread the same day, and this recipie came out delicious. I would not change a thing, other than the next time I make it, I will use my George Foreman grill instead of pan fying the sandwiches.

Here's one no vote; did not like the combination of mango chutney and good colby cheese. There are many better sandwiches on this site.

I used rhubarb chutney, and rather than buttering the bread I fried the sandwiches in just a little of the bacon fat. And I stuck my cast iron pan on top to flatten them a bit. But the ideam came from here and they were so, so good for an easy winter dinner.

YUM! Easy to make and excellent results. My 14 year old asked what the heck was mango chutney, but she loved them. An absolutly great combination. The Colby -Longhorn was perfect for melting.
