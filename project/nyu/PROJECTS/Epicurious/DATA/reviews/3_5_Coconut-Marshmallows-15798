This is easy to make. i used a square pan for the coconut flavor, filled the rest in mini cupcake pans for hot cocoa (accidentally sprayed the pan- should dust it. I made the same recipe last year and covered it in chocolate... yummy!!

Why make your own marshmallows? The 5 and 2 year old absolutley loved every part of this beater licking, spatula sucking adventure! Delicately sweet -so much more so than anything store bought - coconut added intial crunch revealing heavenly, cloudlike center. Used a 9x9 pan as the other reviewer suggested. Perfect!

To Ann Hickey - try using a 9x9 square pan insead of the 9x13 called for. Also, you might try beating the sugar/gelatin mixture longer - mine usually goes for about 12 minutes on my Kitchen Aid mixer. Hope this helps.

This was a great recipe. Perhaps someone could assist though in recommending how I could get these to puff up about another inch? More egg whites perhaps?

i just made this recipe and i found it to be very easy. i haven't had a chance to taste them yet, but if they taste as good as they smell, i think we have a winner!

This recipe is fantastic. We made them over Christmas and they were a huge hit. I made them again for Easter, cut them out with Easter-shaped cookie cutters and coated them in colored fine sugar. They are much better than the store-bought variety.
