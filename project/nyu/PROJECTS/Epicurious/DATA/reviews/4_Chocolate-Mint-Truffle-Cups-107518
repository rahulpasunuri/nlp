Really tasty and easy to make. I had larger cups and it still worked pretty well. Smaller cups would be better.

Amazing!!!! Even better than Peppermint Patties. I could not find foil cups that weren't paper-lined and didn't have time to order online, so I used silicone molds that are meant for ice cubes but that look more like cordial cups. Worked brilliantly, and they were just the right size for two bites or to pop in your mouth. To make painting the cups easier, cleaner and faster, use a food-safe squeeze bottle (found at Michael's) to dispense the chocolate. Rewarm in the microwave as necessary. And use a knife to spread and swirl the chocolate on top...very pretty results! Will make these again and again. Another excellent filling would be caramel sauce, and if you use cordial cups, try cherry rum in place of the peppermint extract and put a maraschino cherry in each cup. Can't wait to experiment!

These were a nice addition to this year's candy tray - the soft, gooey, minty white center was a pleasant surprise and contrast to the semi sweet chocolate outer shell. Yes, spraying the cups would have been a good idea, as the chocolate really stuck to the paper. Very sophisticated and unusual - I'm always looking for different candy ideas, and this one fit the bill nicely.

These were so pretty and tasted just like a York Peppermint Patty! I would definitely make them again but will spray the cups with cooking spray because it was rather difficult to remove the foil from the candy.

Great flavor and looked lovely. However, as the chocolate is not tempered, it stuck to the petits four cups. They second time I made these I sprayed the cups with cooking spray, and the foil was much easier to peel off.
