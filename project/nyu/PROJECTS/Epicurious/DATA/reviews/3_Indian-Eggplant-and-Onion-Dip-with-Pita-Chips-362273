I've made this a few times. I've gotten rave reviews at parties and plan on making it again for our holiday party this year. I did doctor it with a little pomegranite syrup. It gave it that tartness it was missing.

I learnt to make a similar dip in Costa Rica; excluding garam masala. The spices include a little chili pepper, garlic and nutmeg. Always a hit at parties, vegetarians love it and there are no dairy products so it's safe for a picnic buffet. Use a molcajete for genuine flavour.

Very good. Interesting that I make a dip very similar to this excluding the garam masala. I learnt to make it in Costa Rica and it's always a hit at parties.

Delicious dip. I used pre-made pita chips.
