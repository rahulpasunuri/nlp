I followed the recipe to the letter and used pork which made the stuffing smell unappealing and couldn't even taste any of the spices. If anyone is looking to make this recipe, use sausage stuffing instead of ground pork and double the spice. As for me, I'll just continue to use the family gawumpkie (sp?) stuffing.

I love kohlrabi, my parents grow it in their garden and my mother is from Germany. I was very interested in making this recipe. I followed the recipe and we all liked the stuffing and the sauce. The only problem was the kohlrabi. I made this Labor Day weekend and my father gave me 8 huge kohlrabis. They were larger than a softball. I should have cut them down so that they would cook faster. They were thicker than a 1/4" and a bit stalky. I'm going to make this recipe again next summer earlier in the season with smaller and more tender kohlrabi. Everything else was very tasty. Actually, the sauce was so good I can see using it as the base for soup.

I made it vegetarian. I used textured vegetable protein in place of the ground pork, a vegetarian "chicken" broth, and soy milk instead of the cream. Very good flavor. Another variation: made it using bulgur wheat instead of rice, chopped up some seitan instead of meat, used no egg, veggie broth, and replaced the cream with soy milk. This was also very good.

We loved this dish! It was time consuming prepping the kohlrabi, but well worth it. I will definitely make this dish again. I used beef instead of pork, I also added extra garlic and onion. We used wonderful, freshly picked homegrown (by our friend) kohlrabi, and made it organic. Delicious!

Wonderful flavors! The kohlrabi prep is time intensive, however. I lightly broiled the top add some extra texture. I would definitely make this recipe again.

Super delicious. Very indulgent. I made as written but would consider other reviewers lower calorie modifications such as ground turkey. I served casually alongside additional long grain rice. I also doubled the meat mixture and made rolled out meatballs and cooked them on a sheetpan. I mixed them with the remaining sauce to freeze and eat another day. Make sure to trim all the woody outer peel off the kohlrabi. Would make again but probably in the meatball form to save time.

This is fantastic! It took awhile to make, but it's so different from anything we've ever had. Extremely flavorful and rich.

This recipe was just FANTASTIC! My husband is german; we both love german-style food. I ended up using a large skillet on the stovetop to cook the kohlrabi. This recipe is a bit time-intensive to prep the kohlrabi, but is so worth it. Just make sure to peel the kohlrabi well so as to remove the woodsy bits. I ended up adding a little extra cream, that was the only change. We were both really pleased with this.

Its was very good, reminded me of a dish my granma used to make when I was a child. I substituted ground turkey for the pork. The flavors were great.
