I baked this for a chinese-themed dinner and everyone enjoyed it. Served with choice of green tea ice cream or the ginger whipped cream, and both were very good with the cake. The five spice powder was a great addition to the chocolate. My cake came out a bit crumblier than I would have liked ... perhaps I overbaked it a tad. But it was delish and I will definitely make it again.

Wow! I loved this, but it was definitely a love-it-or-hate-it dessert. Made it for a Year of the Tiger banquet, and 5 of 9 people pretty much licked their plates clean (including me), while 3 ate about half their slices, and one hated it. I tiger-striped each piece with the Red Wine Caramel Sauce (unusual and delicious) from this site, and served it with green tea ice cream on the side. I really found it amazing and delicious, and although it was slightly complicated to prepare, it came out perfectly when I followed the recipe exactly.

This is truly one of the best flourless chocolate cakes I've ever tasted...and the first I've ever made. The texture was unbelievable...just melts in your mouth. The five-spice was an interesting twist but I bet you could even play with other flavorings as well.

Very good, very rich. I served this at a asian - themed dinner party and all present said they really enjoyed the flavor of the five spice powder in the cake. Will definitely make again.

Everyone who ate this cake adored it - except me, and I think it's just because it was so hard to make in my tiny kitchen. I couldn't find a 10 inch round pan that was not a springform (don't use one of those with a water bath - no matter how much tin foil you use, they're NOT waterproof. I ruined the first cake that way), so I used a 9x9 square, which has the same volume and worked just fine. Next time I make this, I will wait until I have access to a full size oven, a standing mixer and counter space. The flavor of the cake is exquisite (I may try adding 5 Spice Powder to my brownies for an easier dessert) and the texture is better than any cake I've ever eaten.

The amazing thing about this flourless chocolate cake is its texture. Very rich, but more like a mousse. It is very delicate and literally melts in your mouth. It was easy to make and handle. I found it very easy to cut when cold, so recommend cutting and plating right out of the refrigerator - then let it warm to room temp before serving. I will not make this excact recipe again because I did not like the 5 Spice combo with the chocolate. Although I generally like intense flavors, this was too much - interesting, but not delicious. It has a rough, raw taste. Because the texture was so delightful, I will modify the recipe by using espresso in place of the hot water, minus the 5 Spice powder, and will serve with caramel flavored whipped cream. Again, the basic concept is incredible!

I made this recipe almost as directed, used two fine quality chocolates, both bitter sweet and semi, whipped the eggs according to the directions and used a silicon bundt cake pan. I knew it was going to be trouble when I went to fold 1/4 of the eggs into the chocolate-it seized up and lost it's smoothness. I continued anyway. Took the pan out of the waterbath and it looked appetizing enough. I let it cool and served it with plain whipped cream. Interesting texture - almost like a very rich mousse but unlike my other flourless cake recipe, this didn't cut it. The flavor was different but it didn't work for me. I'll stick to my original recipe and use the flavors of this one.

This is the most amazing flourless chocolate cake I've ever made. I followed the directions exactly,and used Scharfen Berger chocolate(cost about $20.00), but it was absolutely worth it. I served it with the crystalized ginger whipped cream - everyone raved!

When I was in culinary school, I did a lot of asian cooking. For my midterm back in 2003 I had to prepare an entire meal, I used this exact recipe. I had got it out of an artsy cookbook at school. This recipe was lost to me..I have searched for it for 3 years, and finally I found it! I have tried many different deserts..this is by far the best ever. I served it with a homemade fortune cookie and vanilla bean ice cream with caramel pieces (the pieces were crunchy and yummy and gave the dessert texture) on top..it was a very tall, elaborate dessert

This was awesome. The taste was so fabulous and natural. Even the batter was really good :) But it is really rich. Served it with the ginger whipped cream and it was a huge hit. Delicious with a bold coffee.

Made this for my Book Club when we read an Asian themed book. It was a big hit. I made it the day ahead and had refrigerated it over night. I let it get to room temperature before serving, and the cake was delicious. However, the next day I warmed a left-over piece in the micro just enough to take the chill off and found the cake even more delicious than letting the cake just sit out and get to room temperature. Next time I would zap the cake ever so slightly before serving, if I needed to refrigerate it. The cake is very rich; yet when slightly warm, it has a light texture.

This dessert is sublime. I have made it twice and it earned raves each time. Definitely go for the high-quality chocolate. A few more tips on proper technique would be helpful. The second time I made the cake it crumbled when I tried to cut it. None of my guests cared since it tastes so wonderful. Also, the whipped cream helped to hide the broken cake.

I had this cake at Asia Nora's in Washington, D.C. I had to make it, so I was looking up chocolate cake recipes that I could add the five spice powder and found this recipe. This is a truly inspired cake. The five spice is not overpowering, but everyone I've served it to has been intrigued by the unusual and delicious flavor.

This cake has been a huge success in the several times I have served it. I did find it a bit labour intensive, so leave yourself enough time. The flavour was intense, but I would not change a thing. I loved the ginger whip cream, which also goes nicely with specialty coffees.

Made this with a little cayenne instead of the five-spice. Turned out really well.

I tried this recipe as written. Although interesting I did not favor the five spice flavor but it makes a fantastic light bittersweet chocolate cake without the spice. I have made it as a large muffin size and it is great.

This is one of my favorite chocolate desserts. It is rich but subtle in flavor. I serve it with mango ice cream and have never been disappointed.

This was delicious--lovely and different. I sifted cocoa (dutch process) on top and served with ginger ice cream.

This was a very rich dessert and was surprised to read someone else found it to be light. Enjoyed the five spice flavor, but will cut back on it a bit the next time. Enjoyed the ginger whipped cream with it. I think my low rating was simply because this cake was included in a meal with several other aggressive flavors - its good, but certainly not subtle.

I made this for an Asian themed meal, and it was definitely the lowlight of the dinner. I thought the ginger whipped cream was particularly disappointing.

Although I haven't baked this dessert, yet, I do have all the ingredients, and will do so very soon. It sounds like a dessert I've enjoyed several times at SuLan Bistro. Believe me, I will make this dessert as often as possible and especially for special occasions. I enjoy trying new recipes.

I made this cake for my daughter's birthday. Everyone thought it was excellent. I made ginger ice cream instead of ginger cream and it was a great accompaniment. The cake is not tall, so it was not a typical birthday cake. I will definitely make it again.

Hi! I'm new and I'm on my way to learn to bake some simple cakes! So wish me luck ...

This is an elegant, rich desert. It's relatively simple to make considering the complex flavors of the end result. It is really rich on its own, and needs a cool topping. We liked the ginger whipped cream but think it would be yum with green tea ice cream as well. It also worked well topped with a warmed slice of banana clafouti (we had it in the fridge).

A perfectly sublime texture, silky, creamy and light, very chocolaty and if the 5-spice is too unusual for your audience, you could substitute cinnamon, or leave it out all together.

Not sweet enough...needs more sugar if you're not serving it with a sauce or sweet topping. Directions need to be more specific (i.e. at what speed should the eggs and sugar be beaten with a mixer?).

Deliciously light yet rich and satisfying

This is an easy and excellent recipe. I've already made it 4 times!. It serves a lot of people, so there are usually leftovers. They always taste great, but definitely not as great after 5 days. Nobody can ever guess what the secret ingredient is. I didn't stint on the quality of chocolate, which probably helped.
