I didn't follow this recipe so I won't rate it. I always cook my eggnog on the stove. I made macaroons and thought it'd be interesting to try it with just the egg yolks. After I started cooking it, I decided to check this recipe to see what it said. I read the reviews and followed the suggestion of adding egg whites after they have been beaten. I added it too fast and it curdled (to fix it I beat it with my mixer, it kinda works). I think next time I will try it with just the egg yolk because it was looking really good. PS: I mixed the yolk and sugar together before adding the milk and nutmeg (I also add cinnamon). Good Luck!

I'm sorry, but this really misses the mark, thin, watery, tastes like stale melted vanilla ice cream.

great, even better if you add two more eggs and a little more sugar!

For a crowd, the Baltimore Eggnog on this site is out of this world. I have made it three years in a row. If there are leftovers it freezes into a wonderful eggnog icecream.

this recipe is very bland. it needs a lot of help. i have a much better recipe that i have evolved over a number of years. it makes about 9 5 oz servings per batch.

I agree with every one not pleased with this recipe, especially for just one egg. If anyone would like to try a good eggnog recipe, feel free to email me, and I will send you a GOOD recipe from the Betty Crocker recipe book I've been using for many years now,and it's a hit with family gatherings for the Holidays ;-P!!

My granddaughter Erica who is 13 made this and the secret is to beat it well with each item you add..

I'm looking for a recipe that serves 8 to 12 people. This doesn't sound very promising, even multiplying the ingredients accordingly. One suggestion over use of raw egg, however. Whisk the yolk(s) gently over a double boiler, low low simmer until it appears liquidy. Don't cook it, just warm it up some. Then, put in fridge to cool down. Meanwhile, beat the eggwhite to soft peaks, fold in to cooled yolk then add the milk and other stuff. Too much work for one egg if you ask me!

To me, it just doesn't taste like eggnog. I used whole milk and extra vanilla, like other people said. But oh well, it doesn't taste like it. It's runny...tastes like melted french vanilla ice cream.

Try making eggnog with melted premium vanilla ice cream as the base. Over the top, but no worries about uncooked egg! ;)

I have to agree with the others: this recipe is a little bland. I guess the true flavor in eggnog comes from the brandy and rum. The raw eggs are also a concern (although not a specific problem to just this recipe). Is there a way to make "cooked" eggnog?

Would highly suggest using whole milk and extra vanilla. Beat egg and sugar til it foams. Add your "spice" and it tasted like eggnog to me!

I only marked this as a four because of the ability to make this receipe fit what I needed it for. I woke up this morning with a request from my family for the Egg Nog French Toast, since I did not have any Egg Nog on hand, I used the suggestions from other, added Vanilla Sugar and made a triple batch, holding back on some of the milk as I was using skim and it only made it runny. Have fun with this one it is worth experimenting with.

the taste was dull and if you find my use of words a little crummy it's because i'm only 15.sorry

Eggnog is tastier and more pleasant if you first beat the eggwhites until stiff, add the sugar slowly, the milk and the rest of the ingredients last. Try it with this recipe. I think you will be pleasantly surprised.

I didn't think it tasted like eggnog.

this is a simple recipe to make. however it was a little bland. it could use a touch more sugar and vanilla. also maybe a little heavy cream. a good start be creative.
