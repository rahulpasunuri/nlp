I've been making these since I first read this recipe in the early 90s. They are a hit at EVERY gathering and when brought to a potluck I NEVER bring home leftovers!

the amount of cheese in a cup of parmesan can vary depending on the type of grater you use. any tips on an amount by weight?

Very easy and very good. Very much on the salty side though. I will cut back on the amount of salt next time at least by half. I will also add a big pinch of cayenne or perhaps smoked paprika to kick the flavor up a bit. Finally, if serving with cocktails, a teaspoon or so of the dough results in a one-bite delight.

Super easy to make, and they taste great. I doubled the recipe and used a ziploc bag and a pastry tip to pipe out kiss-sized ones as appetizers. They are great for a make-ahead dish.

These were ok- Not super great. Make sure to make these the day of and serve hot- I made these the night before the party and they were not very good the next day- They are much better hot when just out of the oven. To me, they were too buttery and too parmesan-y. I would use less butter and try to incorperate some other cheeses next time. I did use onion powder and garlic powder and it did nicely. I prob wouldnt make these again. I would go for something more irresistable. Great for kids though.

I have been making these since the recipe was printed and love them. For my Christmas cocktail party I add Herbs de Provence and use a piping bag to make "kiss" sized puffs. They look beautiful in a tall stemmed bowl and are wonderful with wine and champagne!

Very tasty and quick to make. I used asiago cheese and took the other cook's suggestion to sprinkle with Cayenne pepper which gave it a nice little kick. Delicious!

This was SO delicious. I made these for a demo at a grocery store and they disappeared in less than half an hour. I trippled the recipe!! More cheese was added...never can hurt.

I've made these a bunch of times at our beach house - not only are they a crowd-pleaser, but i get requests. I've made a couple minor changes though. I use a teaspoon and scoop the dough out into about 2 dozen mini-puffs. (I can't imagine how big these must be if you only make 8!) This way they're a great party snack with cocktails. I've also served with Asparagus Soup from this site as an appetizer. I also sprinkle lightly with kosher salt before putting them in the oven. The last time I made these, I tried sprinkling cayenne over a few and that was tasty too. Though there's a recipe on this site for cheddar puffs that may or may not be better with the cayenne. I'll try another day. I've also had to cook them a bit longer than indicated to get to a golden color, but that may be our oven.

These puffs are pretty, tasty, quick and easy, and they don't require a trip to the store for special ingredients. Took them to a party last night, and everyone loved them.

Delicious and can be made ahead! A word of caution: If your "puffs don't puff," it's probably because you added the eggs to a pan that was too hot - I've learned the hard way!

This recipe is tasty, simple to make and is time-saving, because it can be done ahead of time. I used it to accompany Caesar salad and it was a hit at a large dinner party.

These were very buttery and had a heavy, almost overwhelming taste of parmesan to them. They were a beautiful golden color and so easy to make. One of my children didn't like the parmesan taste but I thought they were ok. When you need a quick bread for dinner I would recommend them. This might sound gross but I drizzled some honey over mine and it was better.
