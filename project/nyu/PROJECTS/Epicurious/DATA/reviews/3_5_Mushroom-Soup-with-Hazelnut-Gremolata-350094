Very easy! Did not have enough mushrooms, so added a chopped potato to the onion and carrots and reserved some of the mushrooms before pureeing. The gremolata was a great touch! Used almonds instead of hazelnuts.

really good soup- my husband said it would be served in a fancy French restaurant. One change I made- not using so much olive oil in the gremolata~ not needed and adds a lot of extraneous fat..

I am a novice cook, so I was very excited about this seemingly complicated and involved recipe. I followed exactly, and it took about 1.5 hours to complete. The result was okay. My boyfriend liked it. I thought that it was too rich and too overwhelming. I will keep looking for an acceptable soup that I can actually eat an entire serving of!

I admit that is cheating a bit to review this recipe, since I made a different gremolata. But so many reviewers commented on the blandness of the soup, that I wanted to be sure that readers know this recipe can be spectacular with a few adjustments. The gremolata I made used two cloves of minced garlic, about 1/4 cup chopped cilantro, and the zest of 1/2 of a lime. I garnished each bowl with a dollop of Mexican style sour cream, gremolata and one sauteed shiitake mushroom. It was wonderful!!!

The gremolata was good, I might try it over a butternut squash soup. The soup itself was very intensely mushroom-y, a little too much for me but better thined out with some half and half.

I found this soup to be a bit bland. It definitely needed the Gremolata to give it some flavor, not sure I would make again.

Any advice on whether this soup could be made in advance, and if so, how far?

I followed this recipe as written, expecting a memorable soup. Unfortunately I found it very bland. I had company coming over so I tried to fix it by adding some sage, nutmeg and sherry. That brought it up a notch but I was still a bit disappointed with the taste. Next time I'll go with another mushroom soup recipe.

I expected to love this soup. I followed the recipe carefully and thought it came out bland. My broth did not have the deep savory flavor I was expecting. The parsley overwhelmed the rest of the ingredients. It was fine, edible, but not particularly memorable or good.

I love mushrooms and this was a great soup! It seems healthy since you just have a little bit of butter and the rest is vegetable broth! I made this for a football game so mixed the sliced mushrooms in with the pureed soup ahead of time. Next time I will wait or have more sliced mushrooms so there is some texture to the soup. I agree the gremolata makes the soup! Ate it as leftovers today and it was even better.

I was intrigued by this recipe and decided to give it a try. It is wild mushroom season here so I used all fresh porcini for the soup. I tasted the soup before adding the gremolata and was not happy with it - the carrots made it way too sweet and it screamed out for sour cream. Adding the gremolata (which in itself is very interesting) only made things worse - it completely overpowered the delicate mushrooms. Now I know why in Poland we do not mess with our porcini, they truly don't need anything other than onions and cream.

I made this soup for my family and even my daughter who said she didn't like mushrooms ate it up! I wasn't able to find the dried porcinis so I used the dried mix. I also used shiitakes and plain old button mushrooms for the topping - also very good! A rich vegetarian option!

This is a very rich soup. I am a mushroom fan and it was too much for me. I followed the recipe almost exactly (used some homemade chicken broth and some veg broth). The soup definitely needs the gremolata. The orange zest accompanies the soup very well and was probably the only thing that allowed me to get through my serving of soup. I wouldn't make this soup again.

Just fabulous! Used oyster, shiitake and some chanterelles on top and the gremolata gives the soup another dimension. Heavenly.

Made this as soup - and loved it - and then made it again, with two less cups of stock, as a sauce on top of roasted polenta. The gremolata and fried mushrooms on the sauce (on top of the polenta) made the presentation beautiful and the dish very tasty. This is a good dish for vegetarians and, with oil instead of butter, very good for vegans. The roasted hazelnuts and orange zest are lovely in the gremolata.

I had homemade chicken broth on hand, so that's what I used. Forgot to add garlic to the gremolata, but it was deliious nonetheless! Will make more and add it then. Used whatever mushrooms I had on hand and could find in the store. Swapped a mix of pecans and pistachios for the hazelnuts. Added half-and-half to the soup before serving. The resulting soup was absolutely delicious--earthy, nutty, filling, just wonderful.

All of these reviews offer wonderful suggestions! I've been making a soup like this for quite a while, only I use porcini powder along with whatever mushrooms are available and cost effective. Sauteed oyster mushrooms make a very nice garnish. I've found that the addition of a little cream at the end does wonders, as does the earthiness of thyme. I also cap mine off with a drizzle of white truffle oil just before plating. Magnificent! As far as wine suggestions, just don't make the same mistake I did last Christmas. For some reason, I served a Pinot Grigio with this course. TOTAL DISASTER! Don't really know what in the world came over me. Please don't laugh. I certainly learned from that embarrassing mistake. This soup definitely needs a red wine to stand up to the deep and robust nuances of the mushrooms. Don't even THINK about a white. Maybe a bordeaux or pinot noir, or even a chianti. I'd be interested in any other suggestions. Oh, and I also add a splash of dry sherry very near the end. Ummm.

I really enjoyed this soup. I couldn't find dried porcini mushrooms, so used chantrelles instead, and used fresh chantrelles and shitake. I forgot the parsley, which I'm sure would have added more depth and a little lift to the soup, but was fine without it. I also roasted the garlic in the gremolata, added at the end of the hazelnuts roasting, so did not overpower. Delicious soup, will definitely make again! My guests all asked for seconds. I think cream or chiken broth would completely change the intent of the recipe and delicacy of the mushrooms, I like the other reviewer's suggestion of using shallots, will try next time.

This soup is divine. I used 4 cups of vegetable broth, no need for chicken stock here whatsoever. I added a finely minced clove of garlic to the stock s well, added it when I started to saute the mushrooms. Before I started to simmer, I tasted the broth, and felt some spice was needed so added 3/4 tsp thyme. That did the trick. No need whatsoever for the oil in the gremolata. I made mine in the same style as when making osso buco, just parsley, zest and garlic. I pureed the broth until it was smooth as a baby's bottom and added around 1.5 cups of cream. The cream actually improves the color of the soup as well. I used shitake mushrooms for the garnish. I also cooked 6 rashers of naturally smoked thick sliced bacon, then tore it into bite sized pieces and added them to the mushroom garnish, was wonderful. I never cooked the bacon as much as you would when making bacon bits for a salad. All in all, this soup is worthy of any occasion.

This recipe is phenomenal and very simple. The soup on its own (while not as glamorous looking as it is with all its garnishes) is hearty and delicious. The sauteed mushrooms and gremolata added additional flavor and texture depth. I will probably consider using thyme (as another review suggested) in the main soup to add to the earthiness of the mushrooms next time. I will also use a bit of shallot in the gremolata--raw garlic rather overwhelmed the other flavors.

We changed two things: 1) used chicken broth; and 2) strained it through a Chinois, which made it simply ethereal. The gremolata--especially the orange and hazelnut-- added the little bit of extra flavor and texture to make the soup really interesting. We all really enjoyed this soup: it's easy, healthy, and dynamic. Will consider making it for Thanksgiving.

Made this for dinner on a nice rainy day. It was so much better than I was expecting, and turned out to be filling on a sing bowl. The flavors are rich, earth, and slightly sweet. I had a hard time finding enough of the dried porcini, so substituted some dried wild mushroom mix. Also added some lobster and oyster mushrooms to the assorted fresh mix. Would highly recommend. Suggest using a fresh clove of garlic. Older cloves tend to have a very sharp taste, and it the raw state can be a little too strong.

Simple, but delicious. Even better if you use chicken rather than vegetable broth. I also added thyme and I would recommend adding your favorite herb(s) to this recipe. For additional smoothness and sweetness add a 1/4 cup or so of cream at the end.
