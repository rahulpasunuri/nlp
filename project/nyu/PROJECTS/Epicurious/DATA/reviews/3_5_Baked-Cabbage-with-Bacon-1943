I made this for St. Patrick's Day dinner along with the Guinness Pies and the Irish Pub Salad and I was pleasantly surprised how delicious this was. The Leeks and parsley really added another dimension to the cabbage. This recipe is a keeper

This was fantastic for St. Patty's day. I used regular bacon (not smoked flavored). Put the cabbage, bacon and a bit of the fat in a large roasting pan, a little water, covered and steamed in the oven for 30 minutes and it was wonderful. Wouldn't spend the time sauteing.

I agree with another cabbage fan who wrote a review. I love cabbage and the flavor seemed to be overwhelmed by the smokiness of the bacon. I used amounts as indicated in the recipe and if I made it again, I would halve the bacon and not slice the cabbage so finely. If you don't like cabbage -- keep proportions as is, but if you do like cabbage -- dial back the bacon.

The was so good!! I used 1lb of bacon and a little under 2lb of cabbage and made the recipe as written.

I found 2# cabbage + 1/2# bacon just right. No leeks so I used shallots. My very american kids were used to cabbage with melted cheese, but they loved this. Had made the Irish Brown Bread and used that for the bread crumbs. The kids helped with all the stirring so I could keep cooking, but this was great comfort food.

I used 2 pounds of cabbage with 8 ounces of apple-wood smoked bacon and still found the bacon flavor stronger than I would have liked. Don't get me wrong, I love bacon AND I love cabbage - overall it was a bit richer than I was expecting. Next time, I will use 4-6 ounces of bacon. Otherwise, it is delicious and easy.

We made the recipe with 1.5 lbs of cabbage and 0.5 lbs of bacon, and it was great! We used an overproof skillet, so just transferred the skillet into the oven for the last bit of cooking, without messing with a pie dish. The flavors of bacon and leeks/onions do completely overwhelm the flavor of the cabbage, but we enjoyed it with sausages and mashed potatoes for dinner. We also reduced the bread crumbs to 1 cup and that seemed like plenty.

I really like cabbage, both briefly steamed and as cole slaw. But I didn't like this cabbage recipe. It doesn't taste like cabbage at all which may be why some reviewers liked it. It takes about an hour to make from start to finish and it must be watched for most of that hour. Maybe if the cabbage was shredded/sliced, then steamed very quickly and if the bacon was cooked separately and crumbled, and then the two mixed together and served immediately it would be okay. This recipe is not for me.

I'm not a big fan of green cabbage, usually, but I got one in my Good Food Box and wanted to make something other than coleslaw. This was *better than I ever imagined cabbage could ever taste*. I kid you not. It must soak up the bacon fat right into the cabbage, because it all disappears once the liquid boils away. I only used a half-pound of bacon, but it's still 12 Weight Watchers points (i.e., half a day's eating) for a 1/6 recipe serving. I ate two servings when it came out of the oven! I'll probably try it with back bacon to cut down on the fat, but it may not be as tasty. I think it will be a great fall dish for dinner parties with barbecued spicy leek sausage from the local butcher on the Danforth... mmm...

OH MY!!! This was so gooooood.... I actually went to Queens to an Irish Butcher and bought myself a shoulder bacon. Made the difference along with Irish Wheat Bread toasted and made into bread crumbs! My goodness my 10 year old and 3 year old along with the hubby...LOVED IT!!! The hubby wants this made again soon...I boiled it for 1 1/2 hours first... Thank You Epicurious for the recipe!!!

My friends and family loved this recipe, even those who don't normally like cabbage. I used 1/2 lb bacon and plan to serve this again next year for our annual St Patrick's Day Party! Delicious.

I love this recipe and so does everyone else I have ever made it for! Even folks who don't care for cabbage love it. The leeks are what makes it. I use a little less bread crumbs than called for. It's wonderful.

Enjoyed it and plan to serve it on St. Patrick's Day. I will use perhaps a third less bacon to lessen the fat content.
