10 minutes is MUCH too long to be cooking your caramel people! I put the timer on for 10 minutes and at 8 saw smoke coming out. Stunk up the kitchen and now I have to clean that pot. Ok, ok, I should have watched but the second time I only needed 7. Also, I think all the people that hated this recipe burned the caramel. The topping is great.

I made a gluten free dairy free version using cornstarch, a little xantham gum and non-dairy creamer. It came out great and my husband loved it. It is VERY rich and delicious. We both wondered about just a little tiny bite for breakfast.....

These were super easy to make and turned out pretty good! I did not like the caramel and the next time I will use a corn syrup-free recipe - try the caramel topping from the Toffee Crunch Cheesecake on this website. The caramel was bubbling along, starting to get nice and amber-colored, and then all of a sudden it was super dark and ended up tasting slightly scorched. Other than that, the brownies were fabulous and chewy.

These are good, but not so rich that they need to be cut into such tiny pieces. I wonder if the amount for the flour, 3/4 c PLUS 2 T, is intended to be divided with the smaller amount used for dusting the pan. I found that the sugar mixture for the topping caramelized in less time than suggested and needs to be watched carefully. All in all, a nice treat but not so special.

I made these brownies for my wife last night and they were great! Made a couple of changes based on reviews. 1. Bake in a 8 x 8in. square glass dish. 9 x 9 makes the brownie layer too thin which causes them to bake too quickly and they get too chewy of a consistency to balance out the chewy nature of the caramel. Metal pans, I find, tend to only increase this problem. Stick to glass and you shouldn't be disappointed. Using a smaller dish will also put the cooking time closer to the advertised time (about 30 minutes). 2. Instead of the chocolate drizzle topping, add some course ground sea salt. The chocolate, caramel, and pecans need salt to bring out their flavors. Just a bit of salt on top will make the brownies explode with flavor. The caramel definitely needs longer than 10 minutes to caramelize. It takes closer to 20 minutes in real life. If you start the sugar on moderate heat and keep it there it will take even longer. Instead start at high heat to get the boil started then immediately back down moderate heat. Watch the sugar carefully as once it starts changing color it will change fairly quickly from light golden to dark brown. I suggest backing the heat down a bit when the color starts changing to give more reaction time. The caramel will continue to darken after being removed from the heat so be quick about adding the vanilla and cream as it will help stop the caramelization. Make a double batch as these brownies tend to disappear quickly!

Awful recipe. They look great, but the topping tastes awful. I made it for a family Christmas gathering, and was very disappointed...it was the dish that noone really touched. do not make!

Delicious. The best brownies I have ever had. The caramel is a little sticky but the overall result is delicious and they are very easy to make.

I loved this recipe, and everyone who ate the brownies loved them too! I used walnuts instead of pecans for the topping, and that was excellent. When I made the topping the first time, I let the caramel get a little too dark, so be careful to just get that golden color. Even though it was a little dark, it still tasted delicious!

I thought this was overly sweet & rich. The topping is sticky even when cooked to 240F. It does not have the same texture as the softly firm, but non-sticky, caramel on "Turtles". I ended up pulling off the topping layer, put it in a jar, and will dilute it with additional cream for an ice cream sauce.

Also works well with gluten-free rice flour.

I think these are great little treats. I used salty Marcona Almonds insead of the pecans and spinkled a little fancy flake salt on top. I did not drizzle the chocolate on top of them as I felt that was unnecessary. Knowing how to caramelize sugar and not going to far is helpful. Very nice, easy, decadent little sweets. You really don't need to eat more than 1/64th at a time.

I was curious how the brownies would turn out with all the mixed reviews. In my opinion they were great and my family loved them. However they are really rich and more like a fudge (maybe this is why some people didn't like them). The topping was perfect and definitely needed to balance out the rich taste but you need to move quickly and not over mix in order for the texture to come out right. I would suggest a big glass of milk and it would be a great dessert (or snack ;-)).

I add chocolate chips to the base; chopped up the pecans and toasted them under the broiler for a few minutes to give them a richer flavor. It took an additional 10 minutes to get it that golden brown color, but the cout detat  after youve pulled the brownies out of the fridge, top them with a good sea salt, like Maldon, making sure you get a tiny sprinkle on each brownie. Its the salt that makes them crack olicious. Youll need to keep running your knife through hot water to cut these up and get them out of the pan.

I had a batch of caramel I needed to use (from a failed cookie recipe from another website). But I followed the rest of the recipe as written, and they were great!! However, if you cut them in 1" squares, I don't see how you can get 64 brownies from a 9x9" pan. I didn't count how many it yielded, but it was MAYBE half that. But they were one or two- bite wonders!

Rating: 4
Mmm, such a hit. I made this in 2 loaf pans as I didn't have a square pan. The caramel kept it from getting to dry, used all semi- sweet in the base and reg corn syrup in the caramel. And it was perfect because we each took home a pan! (Although I got stuck with the pan we'd already eaten half of!).

These were the best brownies I have ever made. I had thought the brownie base was too dry, but once finished, they were moist chewy and soo rich. My family devoured these.

These brownies were delicious! I was looking for something a little more special than just the average brownie..and these were definitely it! I couldn't wait for them to chill in the fridge so I tried them right as they came out of the oven and they were gooey from the caramel layer on top, crunch from the toasted pecans, and chocolatey from the brownie. After I let it chill, they were much easier to cut and would make nice presentations for future parties. I would definitely recommend these brownies..not very hard at all...very much worth it!

Not worth the time and effort even though this wasn't particularly difficult to make. Disappointing.

Fantastic. I followed the recipe exactly, although it took longer than 10 minutes (more like 14) for the sugar mixture to turn a golden color.

Yup, these are gems. I followed the recipe to a T and all went as planned. The brownies are on the chewy side, but I felt that matched the caramel consistency quite well. The office went nuts for these - I recommend them whole-heartedly.

This were great brownies! Everyone loved them, exept I thought the brownie layer to be a bit chewy. Next time I will most likely make a cakier brownie layer and see how they turn out. Otherwise, I would not hesitate to make these again!

I originally made these brownies for Christmas gifts (and several other recipes from the edition of Gourmet in which they appeared.) This particular recipe was the biggest hit. In fact, on of my male relatives calls them the "widow-maker" brownies, as he cannot stop eating them! I have made them several times, and have never had a problem with the recipe.

Rating: 3
I agreed with many of the cooks. The first time I made it, it was great. The second time was a disaster. I recommend using your favorite recipe then add the topping. The problem was that the syrup took ages to turn golden. Then all of a sudden it was dark. By the time I added the nuts and I poured it on the brownie, it was a knotted mass of caramel which turned hard immediately. It looked more like a brownie with candy topping! Perhaps it's also worth toasting the nuts too. I'll have to look for a nice caramel recipe with butter.

SOOO yummy! Easy, not too time-consuming, and just delicious. I'm making them again in a couple of weeks for a party, and I'm planning to put aside a couple as otherwise, I know I won't get any!

Wow. I was really disappointed based on the reviews this received. I only baked the brownie layer for 29 minutes and it was already wayyyy overcooked because the layer is so thin in the pan. I would recommend for the brownie layer, just use your favorite brownie recipe that it a little bit thicker. I would also substiture the caramel layer with a caramel recipe that contains butter.

I've never made homemade brownies before, and have now made this recipe twice. Both times I was the hit of the party. I can't wait to make it again! This past weekend when I made them, I got distracted and forgot to put the corn syrup in the carmel...but it still tasted okay! These brownies are SO easy to make. I will NEVER make boxed brownies again!

THIS WAS A HIT

This is one of my favorite brownie recipes and my most requested. I've changed a couple of things about the recipe. I use bittersweet chocolate instead of semisweet (I ALWAYS make my brownies with Scharffen Berger chocolate. Trust me, try this brand once and you'll never make a brownie with anything else!)and I prefer to chop and toast the pecans and sprinkle them on top of the caramel while it's still hot. The pecans stay crunchier that way. Be careful not to boil the caramel too long, or it gets far to firm and chewy. I pulled out a crown with these babies once!:)Delicious!

these are awesome!! i took them to a party and everyone went nuts! i toasted the pecans lightly before stirring them into the caramel. the toasting REALLY adds a great flavor. i only baked the brownies for 25 minutes. that was just right. i agree with one of the other reviewers that the caramel would be even better if it was more buttery tasting. next time i will look for a caramel recipe that has butter in it. all in all, these are delish!

Rating: 4
I thought these were fabulous. Taking the advice of a previous reviewer, I laid the pecans on top of the brownie layer before preparing and pouring the caramel layer. The result was quite attractive. I served them chilled; I found them to be much tastier that way. A note on cooking time: my oven tends to cook slow, but the brownies were done in 28 minutes, so I suggest you watch them closely in order to avoid overbaking.

These were ok. Not great, not awful, just ok. They looked gorgeous, however. I did put pecan halves on each piece, then drizzled the chocolate, and they were lovely to look at. But all in all, they just tasted average. Shame, too.

These were very good overall. The caramel topping was not buttery enough for me so I will try to find a different caramel recipe for the topping. The bottom was delicious, and the entire concept novel and wonderful. Next time I will lay the pecan halves on top of the brownie layer and pour the caramel over. If you mix the nuts into the caramel then they are all sideways and upside-down when you pour them onto the brownie layer--not very attractive.

My best friend and I made these brownies two nights ago(we are both twelve). We substituted honey for the corn syrup which was propbably why it was WAY TO SWEET. The rest of the brownies were good. However im still searching for a brownie recipe thats worth the calories.

These were excellent brownies! We only cooked them for 20-25 minutes at 325 degrees in a gas oven and they were perfect throughout. If we had baked them the extra 10 minutes, I am sure they would be much more dry than we would like. We added chocolate chips to the flour mix before mixing the chocolate mixture in--so rich and wonderful!

These were awesome!!! I baked these decadent brownies at 325 with a convection oven for about 22 minutes. They were not dry at all and were very chocolatey. I let the brownies come close to room temperature before cutting them and they cut beautifully. These would be the perfect base for fantastic brownie sundaes!

I thought this was great and didn't find the base brownie too dry at all- definitely chill before trying to cut. Very rich, so the small serving size is just right.

I liked the brownie recipe, I didn't follow directions only because I accidentally read them wrong. my brownies turned out really fudgy (how I like them). I didn't put nuts though, so they arn't actually turtle brownies. But I did love the caramel. However, it got really really hard in the refrigerator. Not as hard as if I had just melted plain sugar, but still. Not pleasant, do I need to just let them sit out?

This topping is wonderful!!!Based on the previous reviewers I used my own brownie recipe then made the caramel topping. I also used a 13x9 pan and it was just fine. They cut very well cold and I got about 50 pieces out of one pan. My husband, the brownie conniseur, thinks these are the best he has ever tried. They have made a great, thoughtful, and economical end of the year teacher gift for my girls' 14 teachers.

The caramel topping with chopped pecans is what makes this recipe outstanding. They are best cold, for some reason, rather than warm. I thought they were a little dry too, but still delicious

I thought the topping on this recipe was phenomenally yummy, however the brownie part turned out really dry and flaky. Everyone who ate them complained about the brownie part being dry. Next time I'll use a different brownie recipe for the base and use the topping from this recipe on it.

I would definitely make this again. The first time I made it, I doubled it and there wasn't a morsel left. Because I cook in a kosher kitchen and cannot mix milk with meat, I used a high-grade non-dairy margarine and cream substitute (not soy milk). The results were fabulous and anyone who is kosher or lactose intolerant can eat them!

Wow! These are amazing! Watch the caramel closely - I was surprised at how long it took to start to turn color. But, once it started, it changed immediately, so you really have to watch!

People LOVED these when I brought them. Definitely a new addition to my repertoire of desserts. If you think they're a little too dense, add a third egg. They still won't be fluffy like a cake, but they'll be a little lighter. Also, I've found the more they warm toward room temperature, the softer they get.

yummy. A wonderful blend of my favorite flavors, chocolate, carmel and pecan.
