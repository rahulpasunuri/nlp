I added a vanilla bean, which added nice flavor, but when I added a cinnamon stick it overpowered the other flavors, making it taste like apple pie filling. Still very good, but I'll skip the cinnamon next time to let the fruit flavors come through.

Easy and very delicious. I am about to make my second batch and will can it and add the vanilla bean and cinnamon stick for extra flavor although it is fine just as it is. And don't expect it to thicken while hot but it does nicely when cooled.

I made this because I needed to use some pears that were quickly becomming over-ripe and I also happened to have some pineapple in the refrigerator. I am surprised at how well I like this combination of flavors, I couldn't stop sampling the jam as it cooked so I'll probably make it again. I changed a few things, only used 1/4 of a pineapple to give it more pear flavor, reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 C, added a whole Tahititan vanilla bean, and a stick of cinnamon while simmering and added a teaspoon of rose water after taking it off the heat. Vanilla enhances the flavor of both pineapple and pears, so that addition was a no brainer; cinnamon and rose water add just a hint of a little more exotic flavor.

If you really like the taste of canned cocktail fruits, you'll love this jam. If not, I wouldn't make it. Also, it took a very, very long time to simmer down. Overall, too much work for mediocre jam.

I made this today as part of several jams I'm making for Christmas presents. It is very tasty, nice golden color and sets up very well. I processed in sterilized jars. Will definitely make this again.

I am a complete novice and was able to create this delectible treat. I doubled the recipe without a problem. DON'T PANIC: This may be particular to doubling the recipe, but don't expect the jam to become overly thick while simmering. Most of the thickening happened while it was cooling.

I used this recipe along with 1 other jam and 2 marmalades as favours at my wedding. It was a big hit. This recipe is niether pineapple or pear in flavour but a perfect blended. I bought pineapple that had already been peeled and cored to save some time and it worked out perfectly. It was so easy to make. It is a good recipe for a beginner.

This is amazing! So good. I cut back a bit on the sugar though.

I made this and gave for Christmas gifts to friends one year. Put in a fancy jar with a red ribbon, it is a very elegant gift for a friend or hostess.
