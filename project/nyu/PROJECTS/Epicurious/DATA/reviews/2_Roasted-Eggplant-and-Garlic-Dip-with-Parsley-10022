Broil eggplant for 20-25 minutes. I start on high temp and switch to low in 5-7 minutes. Cut and get flesh out of the skin in a bowl. Try to get rid of excess of liquid. Mash 1 clove of garlic, add 1 teaspoon of lime juice, 1 teaspoon of tahini and 1 tablespoon of mayo, pinch of salt and pepper, little bit of cayenne if you wish. No food processor. The flesh is so soft you can just mix it all thoroughly.

When I came across this recipe I was in a hurry to find a dip for a party. My mistake not to read the reviews like I always do. This was a waste of my time and ingredients. This was some of the most awful stuff I have ever tasted. Way to much tahini and parsley. It had neither the taste or the texture of the dips that I have had before. One taste and we both said "Into the trash." We spared our guests this awful dip. They were the lucky ones.

Next time I make this dish, I'll triple the roasted garlic, add less Tahini, and cut the parsely by 1/3. Way too much parsley. It should of been called a Parsley dip, with some roasted eggplant and garlic.

Go to the September 2000 Eggplant and Tahini Recipe. You won't be disappointed. It is the same ingredients which MUCH better proportions (including not overpowering tahini like this one.)

This recipe needs serious help. Way too much tahini which makes it taste like peanut butter mixed with eggplant. Cut back on tahini, add a lot more spice - cayenne etc. I processed it to a creamy consistency which was not very appetizing.

This is a great recipe for a variance on the regular Baba Ghanouj. The bite from the garlic is great and the parsley adds a nice green color that goes well with St Patrick's Day.

Very yummy. I added just a touch of cumin and cayenne to zip it up and perfection!!! You know anything with that much garlic has to be good. I love eggplant, so I knew that I had to try this, I'm sooo glad that I did.

Iloved the addition of roastd garlic to an otherwise fairly typical baba ganoush recipe. I also added a dash of hot sauce and a 1/2 tsp. cumin for a bit more zip.

I traditionally love all eggplant dips, so I was excited when I came upon this recipe. The amount of lemon juice called for made it too tart, and though I only used 3/4 head of garlic I still found it a little overpowering. I ended up adding a teaspoon of sugar which made it more appetizing, but overall I was disappointed.

Yummy. If you like the taste of wet cardboard. This recipe makes a John Tesh concert seem exciting.
