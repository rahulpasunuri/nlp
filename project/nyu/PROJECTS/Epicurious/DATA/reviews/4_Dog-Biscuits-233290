Nice dog biscuits I use 1/2 cup parmesan or other cheese and only 1 stick of butter, and honey instead of brown sugar. Or instead of the cheese and butter, I've used peanutbutter. I use no parsley nor mint. The dogs love 'em. I do too! They are very tasty! But I leave them to the dogs.

Like many of the reviewers, I use whole wheat and rye flours with no corn meal or white flour, and peanut butter instead of butter, but the recipe is very flexible. Here's what I do to simplify: put all the ingredients into a stand mixer at the same time (wasn't that easy), add enough water to get a nice dough. Roll out the dough on a flexible cutting mat and cut with a pizza cutter (any size you want!). Turn over onto a baking sheet. Skip the egg wash if you like and bake about 30 minutes. I roll out about one half of the recipe, freeze the rest for next month. My dog is on a diet so I cut into smallish pieces as training treats. Use a cookie cutter for fancy/gift biscuits. I calculated that 1 inch round biscuits were about 20 calories each, so my little ones are about half that.

I must agree with previous reviewers that this is not a healthy biscuit recipe for dogs. Our bulldogs have many allergies, so I modified the ingredients and they came out great (just ask our happy pups)! Substituted both the all-purpose flour and whole wheat flour for brown rice flour, eliminated corn meal (too hard for dogs to digest) and used 2-1/2 cups of old fashioned oats. Eliminated wheat germ & brown sugar and used 1/2 cup of all-natural peanut butter with 1 Tbsp. honey. Eliminated salt and only used 1/2 stick of unsalted butter. My substitutions required more liquid, so I used 1-1/2 cups of chicken broth (instead of only 1 cup water). This recipe came out terrific...the whole house smelled like peanut butter cookies (^:

Dog loves these. I made half a batch since they only keep for a month. Used peanut butter in lieu of butter and whole wheat flour instead of white. Came together easily in my stand mixer. Next time will roll out into a rectangle and cut into various size squares to make that part faster and easier. Can see making these every month for the pup.

I've made this the last few years for Christmas treats for all the dogs in our family and everyone loves them! Even the pickiest dogs will love these treats.

I can see my next challenge will be trying to get into the Doggie Treats jar without Cody hearing me! Not only were these really easy to make using a food processor, but they are absolutely delicious! Healthy, too! Looking at the recipe I just realized that I forgot the salt, although I did use the suggested peanut butter instead of butter and all whole wheat flour instead of half all purpose flour. I used the parsley, but didn't have the mint. I could see rolling the dough into a log, chilling and slicing to make crackers. They are really delicious! Thank you for the recipe so Cody can get some "good for you" treats, too! This is "our" favorite dog bone recipe so far!

Okay, these are so good, my dog maybe got one or two. My son got a kick out of eating something shaped like a dog biscuit and he and I polished them off in a few days. I used Graham wafer crumbs instead of wheat germ and I used slightly more mint than parsley. Next time I would use a little bit more brown sugar just because we love sweet treats. Fabulous, fun recipe!

Wow! I have three dogs, A Chihuahua, a King Charles Cavalier and a St. Bernard. They all went wild over these biscuits. I bought a tin of three different size biscuit cutters at Michaels. I'm afraid I'm going to have to search for much bigger one for my St.Bernard! They were very easy to make and rolled out beautifully without any refrigeration. I didn't have fresh parsley or mint, so I just used dried parsely (we were in the middle of a blizzard). I just hope I can keep these guys stocked up now!

My dog is extremely fussy and loved these biscuits.He sits infront of the cookie jar for the treat. I've made them with the original recipe, then substituted peanut butter or added parmesan/romano cheese, no spearmint. Friends ask for the recipe--epicurious. com.

As they were baking, my partner and I were both threatening to eat them; they smell that good! The dogs won't eat any other treats now!

Daisy and Sookie give them 2 paws up! I used Peanut Butter instead of butter, used more water and all parsley, no mint. They roll out very easy and are really fun to make! I'm anxious to try the baby food meat and cheese bacon variations! The best part is that I didn't lick my fingers, the bowl or eat the scraps! Baking that won't kill my diet!

I substituted rye flour for the cornmeal and the biscuits got a nice dark glow. Also added some nutritional yeast (available at Whole Foods) instead of sugar and some granulated garlic. These biscuits are a hit with both the puppy (5 months old) and the senior dog (17 yrs old). Thanks for a great recipe!

There are a few things in this recipe that are not good for dogs, so I substituted them for things they could digest. I took out the all-purpose flour, cornmeal, salt, sugar & butter and replaced them with Whole-Wheat flour, honey, and peanut butter. I didn't bother cutting the cookies with a cookie cutter, but rather rolled them into bite-size balls and flattened them into discs. My dogs were "sitting pretty" for them before I even got them into the oven!

Made these for a school fundraiser -'bake sale' last year. I packaged them in bags with dog bones on them and tied with a red ribbon. Wasn't sure how they would go over, made about 30 bags. Sold every single one with people asking for more. One woman called me this year to order 20 bags LOL. My dog loves them and all the dogs in the neighborhood do too.

This recipe seems a bit ingredient heavy and a tad cumbersome for dog biscuits, however it is absolutely worth the effort. A friend and I made these, and not only are they really tastey for humans, the dogs we "experimented" on with these really enjoyed them too. An added bonus, the mint and parsley in the recipe absolutely caused our dogs to have fresher breath. This completely sealed the deal with this recipe, and we will make it again.

I, like my dogs, love this recipe. It's my favorite hostess gift for friends who have dogs. I substitute peanut butter, like others, but find that I must increase the water by almost 1/2 a cup. The last time I made them, I tried using my standing mixer instead of the processor. Not a good plan.

Dog's lack the enzymes to properly digest Wheat and Corn. It's damaging to their systems and can cause long term damage.

I USED TO HAVE A RECIPE LIKE THIS ONE BUT INSTEAD OF MINT, I USED PEANUT BUTTER, ALL THE TEENAGERS WHO CAME IN WHILE I WAS FIXING THIS THOUGHT I HAD MADE PEANUT BUTTER COOKIES FOR THEM..LOL

Many thanks to all of you who have reviewed this recipe..Great feedback for me to follow for substitutions. I am going to try wheat free version with soy flour, rice flour & natural peanut butter instead of dairy butter. These biscuits will be fundraisers for the local vet who takes in stray at his own expense. Thanks so much !!!

My dogs love these. I made them as per the recipe the first time now I change it up. I use beef, chicken, veal baby food for an meaty taste. I also cut down on butter and no salt.

The first time, I made these as written and my dog loved them. This time I omitted the mint and parsley, and after halving tghe dough I added 1/2 cup finely grated cheddar to one half. And added 1/2 cup finely chopped bacon to the other half. They may not hold as long in the pantry, but my dog is flipping out over them. And it's nice to have 2 different flavoreed biscuits.

My dog loves these! In fact, she now snubs her nose at Milkbones. I omit the sugar, sub the butter with peanut butter, omit the mint and instead double the parsley, which I often just buy dried. I also don't roll them out and use my hands instead to make tiny flat disks--I have a small dog. Great recipe. Makes enough for a two-three month supply for my pooch.

my dog loves these! i only used 1 stick of butter, half the sugar, subbed unsweetened apple sauce for the water, and added pulverized banana chips (bananas are the dog's favorite treat...including the peel)

These are amazing!! I can't get enough of these little treats! I tend to reduce the amount of salt to only 1 tbsp and I like to increase the amount of mint for fresher breath!! ** woof woof **

I make these alot, my dogs love them. I bought small round cutters to get the max from the recipe. I also add cooked diced bacon. I give them as gifts at XMas and bring them to friends for their dogs. They are time consuming but well worth it. They keep for a good while. Check on the mint you use, either spearmint or peppermint is not good for dogs so you want the one that is not toxic. Your health food store can tell you the good one. Try this recipe!

These are extremely gratifying to make--they roll out like a dream. I gave them to our neighbors' most excellent dog last year, and they asked for the recipe (after sampling them themselves to see why their dog was so blissed out). I made Christmas trees and little men. I'm going to make them again this year.

I made these a few days ago and my Jack Russell loves them. Then again, he'll eat gum off the sidewalk, so he's hardly a dog with a sophisticated palate. I thought they were quite tasty too, a tad bit on the bland side but I think they would make excellent scoops for party dips.

After reading all the reviews, I decided to give it a try although the other doggie biscuits I had baked were not a terrible success. These have to be the best biscuits I have made. My Great Danes loved them, so did my husband. I have made them twice already, and handed them to my dogs' friends. We all love them. Great with cheese and a glass of wine!

My daughter made these treats for her dog and for mine. Both dogs were very enthusiastic about them, so I guess that means that this recipe gets a hearty canine salute!

I thought these were pretty good for humans, and half the dogs I tried them on thought they were very good. Some dogs seem to think that there is not enough meat in them, but those are dogs that get store-boughten treats from Walmart a lot. Adding some dried meat or cheese might make these more attractive to those dogs. I thought they would be good for back-packing food, sort of like the way bread that the elves make for hobbits. I kept them in the car for a while and ate them when I got hungry. They make a lot of crumbs so they are not so good for the car.

My little dog Buster LOVED these! I used mini Chrimstas cutters: tree, jingle bells & stars. I will add that my 9-year old like the dough...I tasted the finished biscuits as well and was impressed. I'll definitely make these again and hand them out as Christmas gifts to my friends with dogs.

Rolled dough into rectangles and then cut with a knife. The dog never noticed the lapse in presentation. Did whine for more. My human friends liked the bones with sharp cheddar. I may invest in a cutter to amuse the owners.
