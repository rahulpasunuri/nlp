I made this cake for a potluck and people raved about it (I personally don't care for cooked bananas, but I needed to use some overripe fruit so I made this anyway for the crowd). Two instructions I would recommend adding are: 1) sifting the dry ingredients to make mixing them in easier & avoiding lumps of flour. Cake flour, because it is so fine, is notoriously lumpy and you don't want bits of dry flour in your cake; and 2) running a spatula or knife around the edges of the pan before turning the cake out. I used a silicone cake pan and the banana top came out of the pan intact, but the sticky edges adhered a little so I bet in a glass or metal pan you might end up with a broken cake if you don't loosen it first.

I made this tonight. I followed the previous reviewer's method, except I forgot to add the sugars to the batter. I was worried that it will come out bland. But it was just right. The bananas are very ripe and very sweet. I can imagine that with the additional sugar in the batter, it would have been too sweet.

Easy to make and delicious. I do agree to cut back on the sugar.

Three forks for the recipe, four forks for chefette's easy and delicious version. It disappeared so fast at the party I made it for that I barely got a sliver. Perfect amount of sweetness and looks lovely, too. I love that it's just one pan and one bowl. I bet walnuts in here would be very tasty. A new favorite.

Delicious- I agree to cut back on the sugar in the cake by 1/2 cup. It is great but too sweet. I used gluten free flour (Mama's almond flour) and it came out light and airy.

Rating: 3
Technically, I'm rating the recipe of the previous reviewer. I'd say s/he pretty much nailed it in terms of reducing the sugar and ease of prep. I made the cake for a dinner party and everyone loved it. My only suggestion would be to try cake flour as the cake was a bit dense? I would go with previous recipe instead of the orginal!

Another keeper for old bananas. This cake is exceeding sweet (used frozen leftover bananas for the cake part) and I reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup Splenda. Used a 10X8X2 casserole dish, just the right size. Teenagers scoffed it down!

This is OK, but there are several problems: 1. It's too sweet because of too much sugar, and not enough salt. 2. Who creams butter and sugar for the topping? 3. Why bake it for over an hour? I'm sure it would be like a rock then. So, with a nod to this cake, I have come up with a much better and easier one that doesn't even need a mixer. Oven 350. Topping: 3/4 cup light brown sugar, 6 tablespoons salted butter, pinch salt, 1 T. honey (keeps topping from crystallizing), 2 bananas sliced. Melt everything except bananas in bottom of a 9 x 9 pan in the preheated oven. Mix well, then add sliced bananas on top. In a medium bowl, mix together 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, 1/4 cup light brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar, 3/4 tsp. baking soda, 1/2 tsp. baking powder 1/2 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon. In a second bowl mix together 1/2 cup buttermilk (or 1/2 cup water and add 2 Tablespoons buttermilk powder to the dry ingredients) 1 cup mashed ripe bananas, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/3 cup salted butter, melted, 2 eggs, and 2 Tablespoons dark rum(optional). Add liquids to dry and stir to mix. Pour over topping in pan. Bake 40 minutes, or until cake is done. Let sit 10 minutes, then run knife around sides and upend onto a plate. Much simpler and much better. You're welcome - haha

I often have leftover bananas, and this time had leftover buttermilk as well, so I happily found this cake. It will definitely become a standard for me. Thanks to another reviewer, I did the simpler version in my 10" skillet--simpler in part because my butter is always frozen so melting is easier than creaming butter from room temp. I used the T rum another reviewer suggested, and only 3/4 cup white and brown sugars in the batter--plenty sweet that way. I will try reducing the brown sugar in the topping, too, next time. What a terrific all-in-one recipe; the cake comes from the oven "frosted and decorated"!

I've been making this since the recipe came out and its always a winner. Very versatile as well; you can add cinn or other spice, coconut, chocolate, rum, bourbon, etc. Usually bakes in 40-50 min depending on oven so I check at 40. I am a caterer and will use this for intimate dinner parties or brunches. Also freezes well.

Added a TB of dark rum to the butter, brow sugar mixture. Alos added a TB of rum to the mashed banana mixture. Pretty tastey with a dollop of vanilla ice cream. I was a little nervous because the cake was getting pretty dark at 40 min. in the oven however it clearly wasn't done. I left it in the oven for the hour and 5 minutes and although the cake was dark it wasn't burnt or over cooked. Very moist. Also, realized to late that I was out of shortening so I used butter instead.

Rating: 3
When I was mixing the batter, it wasn't getting fluffy. I also couldn't find a 9 by 9 pan so I used a 9 by 13 pan. Despite all of the malfunctions, it actually turned out wonderful and I really liked it!

This was truly a great cake. I used just firm bananas-not too ripe and it turned out wonderful. I used a 9x13 pan and followed the other review for this size. Used sucanat sugar instead of regular for the batter and 1/2 cup more flour-added whole wheat pastry flour for the extra. Also added a total of 1 and 1/3 cup sucanat and an extra egg white. Used greek plain yogurt instead of buttermilk.

Rating: 4
YUM! We had another couple over for dinner and had a few bananas that needed to be used and some buttermilk, so I whipped up this cake. It was easy to make, delicious, and every so moist. The bananas, sugar, and butter caramelized beautifully. I did substitute unsweetened applesauce for the shortening in the recipe, and found that I could have cut the sugar in the primary recipe to about 3/4 cup, but it was DELICIOUS.

Rating: 3
This cake is a fabulous way to use up over-ripe bananas. I followed the advice of others to cut back sugar using 3/4 c. dark brown for the topping and then 1/2 c. white + 1/4 c. brown for the cake. I also used butter instead of shortening and since I used powdered buttermilk, I replaced the liquid with 1/4 dark rum and 1/4 c. water. BUT the biggest change was that I started this on the stove in a 10" iron skillet with 2" sides. Melt butter and sugar on the stove top and then put a layer of slices of just-ripe bananas and pecan halves on top of the melted sugar/butter mix. Pour the batter over the bananas and bake at 350 -- takes only 30 minutes. Let cool for about 5 minutes before inverting onto a plate. It was beautiful, delicious and perhaps still a bit too sweet. I'll try less sugar and butter for the topping next time.

This recipe was a disaster. The 1hr 5 min was way too long, it was overdone and then it wouldn't come out of the pan. Might try it again with parchment paper liner, we always have leftover bananas.

Mmm-mmm! This was a delicious use of extra bananas. The upside-down topping makes the cake (and the corner pieces are the best!). I subbed in all-purpose flour for cake flour and it was great. I might just make it again today!

Rating: 4
I loved this recipe! Unlike most, I DID NOT omit topping...This makes the cake...I did however substitute soymilk plus vinegar for the buttermilk as well as powdered egg substitute (we have food allergies!) I did not feel the need to reduce the sugar as others stated. This cake turned out beautiful and was incredibly moist and flavorful! Will certainly make again and again!

Rating: 4
Per the other reviewers suggestion I skipped the topping and just made the cake. I'm generally very picky about my bananas and rarely eat them once they start to spot. This is an excellent way to use bananas that would normally be heading for the trash. I'm vegan so I used coconut cream in place of the buttermilk but I don't think it significantly changed the taste. I will definitely make this cake again.

This was a delicious, if sweet cake. I made the recipe with only one sub--Saco buttermilk powder instead of liquid buttermilk. Works very well (tested by Cook's Illustrated) and super convenient. Tamed the sweetness with whipped cream, and it was devoured. One problem, though--the bananas in the topping got hard. Has anyone else had that problem? I would probably just leave the bananas out of the topping next time and just use the sugar and butter because of it. Oh, I also baked it in a 9x3" round cake pan b/c others said it bubbled over. Worked very well.

Rating: 0
actually baked the cake without the topping as most users said it was awfully sweet. turned out pretty ok and also reduced sugar to 3/4 cup brown sugar, would use 1/2 cup next time. also substitued buttermilk with strawberry yogurt which was fine. would also reduce the amount of liquid. very bananany recipe.

Rating: 3
This is a good recipe to use up leftover bananas, instead of the standby muffins (which we were getting very tired of). I overcooked the cake, and I actually like the thicker crust. it gives nice variation to the soft cake texture. The cake is exceedingly sweet, I would recommend cutting back the sugar. And also I would recommend putting a sheet below to catch the drippings.

My husband baked for the first time in his 75 years and made this. It was absolutely delicious! I thought he was making my recipe for banana bread so when he asked which pan he should make it in I gave hime my bread loaf pans. He called me at work and said he thought the pan would be too small so he baked the cake in both. He brought one to work and I was so happy I had another one for the next evening because the cake he brought to me at work disappeared in 30 minutes! Next time I will make vanilla and candied ginger ice cream and serve it for dessert!

Rating: 4
Absolutley delicious! I baked it in a 9x13 pan for about 45-50 minutes and it came out great. I used one extra banana and 8 tbsp butter in the topping to make up for the extra room in the pan. I only used 3/4 C sugar in the batter, substituted yogurt for buttermilk, and butter for shortening. Everyone who ate this absolutely loved it!

Rating: 3
Well, it isn't a pretty cake, but delicious and moist and easy. Thanks to other reviewers for suggestions on cutting back sugar. I used 3/4 cup brown sugar for the topping, and added a generous sprinkling of chopped pecans and some spiced rum. Used 1/2 cup white and 1/4 brown sugar for the cake, and it was perfect for my taste. This is a great alternative to banana muffins for those overripe bananas. I baked in a 10" springform pan. If you do this, be sure to put a baking sheet under to catch the oozing from the topping. Regarding the buttermilk, you can buy a powedered buttermilk that is great to have on hand for all those recipes that call for it. No more throwing out unused buttermilk, unless you actually like to drink the stuff!

I've made this recipe several times over the past 10 years. I recommend serving it warm as it's truly decadent when still hot from the oven. I've always made the recipe as is. Is it sweet? Yes, but isn't dessert supposed to be?!?!

Rating: 4
Very good for something a little beyond your everyday banana bread; that said, I think I will be reducing the sugar amounts as suggested by previous reviewers next time. Also, as was mentioned, I started checking at 50 min. and used foil to prevent it from darkening too much at the end. I had some overflow, so next time will place something under the pan.

As I was making this cake and planning to use yogurt (as several reviewers suggested in place of the buttermilk), I panicked. I only had boysenberry yogurt in the refrigerator -- so boysenberry it was (after all, it was only 1/2 cup...right?). Anyhow, after cutting the sugars to 1/2 cup white and 3/4 cup brown (thank you reviewers!), I still ended up with a wonderful cake. In fact, it is even better today after the flavors all blended together. So if you're a bit unsure of making the cake because you don't have buttermilk, go ahead and use whatever flavor yogurt you've got -- it made a delicious cake!

My family loved this recipe. It smelled great as it was baking in the oven. I didn't care much for this bread tho. It might have been the lack of banana flavoring.

My husband is a banana cake freak so I made this for his birthday and it was a hit.I used 3/4 cup of sugar in the batter and 1/2 cup of brown sugar for the topping,still sweetbut not too sweet.To the cook who was wondering about the shortening,I substituted cup for cup with butter and it was fine.I cooked it in a bundt tin which I think helps the presentation,I like the look of the caramelized banana and I studded it with pecans.Okay so it sounds like I made a whole different cake but it was pretty close to the recipe and delicious

Excellent cake, and quick and easy to make. I did have one problem as I mistakenly used an 8" square 2" deep pan. The batter overflowed during the baking and it poured onto the bottom of the oven. The center of the cake also took much longer to bake than the rest of the cake. However, the result was so delicious I would recommend using a 9"x13" pan and just covering the bottom with a thinner layer of the brown sugar and butter mixture and using more bananas to cover. It DOESN'T look like rotten bananas, but rather like caramelized bananas when it's done, and it tastes like heaven. Think it might be good with some walnuts, but haven't tried that yet. Also used yogurt instead of buttermilk, which we never use at home. It worked fine.

Rating: 3
My two gluttons loved this. I reduced the sugars as recommended per other reviewers. It unmolded and presented beautifully. The only complaint was that there was no ice cream to go with it. It is a tasty dessert and a great way to use up those over ripe bananas. Next time I will add a little dark run to the brown sugar and butter mix and remember the ice cream.

Rating: 4
Delicious! I made a few modifications (didn't have buttermilk, used undiluted condensed milk instead, only one cup of sugar, as suggested by another reviewer)but the end result was just great! I also added pieces of walnut in the spaces not covered by the banana slices (before adding the batter) and that made a difference, for the best!

Followed the suggest of others and reduced the sugar. Can't imagine what the cake would taste like with all that additional sugar. The result with the reduced amount was absolutely delicious. Made in a spring form pan which made for easy flipping. Excellent warm with vanilla frozen yogurt.

Found myself with a bunch of ripe bananas. Went to epicurious for inspiration. This recipe resulted in one of the best cakes I've made. It kept well in refrig for a couple of days. I added chopped crystalized ginger to the topping; used non-fat yogurt in place of buttermilk; added cinnamon and ground ginger to batter; and reduced sugar to 1 C based on previous suggestion.

As the other reviews have mentioned I would make it again but with only 1 cup of sugar. Rather than bananas at the bottom I used sliced strawberries which turned out really yummy however, I love butter and I used too much with the brown sugar so careful with the butter measurements. Yummy! With a few revisions I'd do it again.

This is comfort "food"! Adults and children will enjoy this cake. Serve this with a premium butter pecan ice cream or spicy cinnamon whipped cream. Very easy!!! By the way, I didn't find this cake ugly at all,kind of overlapped the bananas in a circular design on the bottom and thought it rather attractive.

Great use of bananas that are on their way to becoming rotten. I didn't have enough bananas to do the bottom layer so I substituted pineapple rings. Turned out great! The flavors of pineapple and banana were excellent and the cake was beautiful. No problem with the "ugly" presentation that others mentioned.

One of the best cakes I've made. Simple and not too big (good for family of 5!). I heeded other reviewer's comments, and lessened the amount of sugar as follows: 3/4 c. of brown sugar for topping, and only 1/2 c. for the cake. It was perfectly sweet! Also, used regular flour and turned out perfect. ALL in our family loved this!

One of the best super simple desserts i've made in a while.

I made this on a whim because we had a bunch of almost overly ripe bananas, and my family thought it was delicious! I wouldn't change a thing. What separates this from banana bread is the topping: sweet, sticky, yummy. If presentation is important, beware. It doesn't necessarily look great on top, because bananas aren't quite as sturdy as, say, pineapple. But the taste is great; not too sweet for us! I didn't have cake flour, so I just put all-purpose flour through the sifter. The texture turned out fine.

It sounded like an interesting recipe, but I was disappointed with both the presentation (looked like rotten bananas on top) and the texture of the cake (I've made better banana loaves). I reduced the sugar, as per the reviews, but still not a winner in my books.

This was delicious but very sweet. The cake reminded me of my grandmother's banana bread. Next time I make it I'll reduce the brown sugar, white sugar and butter in the topping. Not a criticism at all of the recipe, just my personal tastes. This was a near perfect dessert and it looked great when I flipped it over onto my cake dish.

I make a version of this cake about every week (maybe I should just buy fewer bananas). I don't use the bananas on top (first time I tried it, i picked them all off)but keep the brown sugar/butter mixture part to give the cake a nice top. I only use 1 cup of sugar and substiute the buttermilk with sour cream and mix the recipe in a single bowl instead of the three differnt bowls the recipe indicates. I serve this cake with a ring of pinapple and pineapple juice poured over it (not too much or the cake will get soggy, but the juice softens it up just right when served warm). This allows the cake to pick up the pineapple taste while diluting the banana flavor.

Rating: 4
Amazing! Easy. I used rum flavoring instead of vanilla, and cooked the recipe in two bread pans instead of one 9" by 2" pan, as I didn't have one. This cut the baking time down to about 35-40 minutes. Very, very tasty. Oh, yeah, I also cut the batter sugar down to 1 cup. I can't imagine any more sweetness. Absolutely does not need chocolate, is complete as is.

Our neighbor buys bananas in bulk and shares a lot of them with us. I needed to use them before they rotted. This recipe sounded good. It was very good, and sweet. However,I would make it again only if I had extra bananas around. My husband and father LOOOOVVED it!!!

I have to serve it tonight, so last night I cut a TINY edge off and tasted it...WOW! If you like bananas foster, you will LOVE this.

This was perfect. The bananas on the bottom were sweet and slightly caramelized and the cake tasted banana-ey and moist. I only had an 8"x8" pan so I used some more bananas and divided the extra brown sugar mixture and batter into 2 small pyrex cups and made mini cakes (baking them for a much shorter time of course). My cake was done about 10 min. before the recipe cooking time (maybe because of the smaller pan). The entire family loved this cake.

I haven't yet made this version, but just want to say it is almost identical to one which was a family favourite that my mother made for years. It was baked in a ring pan with a large centre hole which was to be filled before serving with slightly sweetened whipped cream which had mashed ripe banana folded into it (1 banana per 1/2 pt. of whipping cream). It was wonderful! Made it last weekend for my husband's birthday.
