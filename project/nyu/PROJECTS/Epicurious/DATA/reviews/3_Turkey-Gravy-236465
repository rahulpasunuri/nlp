this is a tremendously flavorful gravy which will produce 'great applause' from your loved ones family and even your boss that you despise. You have to commit to the time it takes and follow the recipe to the letter. it delivers. Amazing richness and flavor like no other gravy i have ever tasted. this will be my third year. it is not cheap -the payback is when people taste it! Make extra-- its delicious.

Yikes! I think I was suffering from a brain tumor when I made this for Thanksgiving..I wanted a do ahead gravy. I started by making the veal demi-glace. All together, it was maybe a 15 hour process. I thought the results would be amazing, but I'm sorry to say they weren't. Nobody disliked the gravy, but knowing how much work went into it, I was disappointed. Sorry Kent.
