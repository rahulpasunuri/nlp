The granola is good on top of things, but not as cereal. On its own it is tasty, but dry. I only made the granola and found its best use as replacement for the oatmeal in the Maple Oatmeal Muffins, omitting the maple syrup from that recipe. Now there it is delicious! The yes is a maybe and I would add the raisins to the cooked hot granola, but not in the oven again.
