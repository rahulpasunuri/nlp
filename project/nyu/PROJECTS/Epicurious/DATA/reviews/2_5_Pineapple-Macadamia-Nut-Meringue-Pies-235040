incredibly easy and delicious. Had I known how delicious and simple this recipe was to make, I would have doubled it. Making more tomorrow. Third time ! I may experiment with different nut crusts...hmmm almond?

I love absolutely EVERYTHING with pineapple in it. That said, there's something about this pie that just didn't do it for me. I think it was the macadamia nuts. It tasted too nutty to me.

I loved the filling...I used any lefted over for ice cream.
