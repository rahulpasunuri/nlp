I substituted minced garlic for the shallot, used sage, and nearly doubled the lemon zest (threw them all in a mini-food processor). Prepped it 2 hours before roasting which may have helped give the flavors time to settle in too. Placed the chicken on top of lemon wheels and sage for extra flavor and baked on parchment for easier cleanup. While chicken was cooking, I used the shallot to make a lemon-butter sauce that I poured over steamed green beans (using juice from the lemon zested for this recipe). Also made some Barefoot Contessa fingerling potatoes while chicken roasted - timing works well if you start the water for both the potatoes and green beans when you put the chicken in to roast. DELICIOUS!

My family really liked this. I used sage and lime as I had them on hand. It was easy, tasty, and the timing was perfect.

While I LOVE the combination of lemon, tarragon and butter, I did think the overall flavor was too subtle and the meat was a bit too dry. Perhaps if I had eaten the herb-coated skin I would feel differently. Next time I'll try roasting them whole and trussed, stuffed with a halved lemon.

Excellent. I used a roasting chicken instead of the hens and increased cooking time to an hour (I had to cover it so the lemon peel didn't burn). I also cut the lemon in half and stuffed the cavity with it to increase the flavor and tenderness. This is a fantastic and simple dish.

This was a nice recipe, the cooking time and temp were right on but I felt the flavor was just a bit mellow for my taste. The skin came out perfectly crispy though. It needed more salt and pepper though, and I rarely add salt to anything.

I left my hens whole, and it wasn't difficult to loosen all of the skin including the legs and thighs. I reduced the heat to 425 degrees, and now feel I should have roasted at the 450 as instructed, because the skin could have been crisper. Any fresh herb of one's preference would work. I also tucked a small piece of lemon and a garlic clove in each hen, and trussed them with kitchen twine. We liked these, but there are much better recipes for this bird on epicurious, even if they are a bit more work.

Remember to remove any rings from your fingers while loosening the skin. It tears easily. Delicious.

Very simple and the hens were wonderful. The flavor combination was great.
