Used 1/2 head cauliflower, 3 cloves garlic, 2/3c. beef broth, 1t. seasoned salt, 1T. butter and 2T. 1/2 & 1/2. After about 30 minutes on low, covered, I added the butter & cream, mashed and served topped with gremolata & a slight drizzle of smoked balsamic atop meatballs. It was wonderful. A nice alternative to roasted w curry.

They must have changed the amount of broth as 1/3 cup wasn't enough and a lot of previous reviewers mentioned that it was too much broth. I had to put in more during the cooking. Otherwise I just tweaked it a bit, more garlic, a bit more butter, Parmesan and half and half. This recipe is a no-brainer and I've fooled my 9 year very picky eater in thinking it was "cheesy mashed potatoes". This will be a regular side dish in our family. I only gave it three forks due to the needed adjustments.

What a disappointment! After reading all the rave reviews I was looking forward to this dish, but even after adding white pepper (which helped), it is really bland. I love cauliflower, but not this way.

This was an excellent side dish. Changes: I used a large cauliflower, 3 cloves of garlic & about 1/2 cup of broth. When it was done, I drained it, used my hand emulsion blender, added about 1/4 cup of fat-free half & half, 1T butter, salt & pepper. Recipe's a keeper!

Delicious & easy accompaniment to Short Ribs with Cranberry-Teriyaki Glaze. The broth and garlic add terrific flavor. I multiplied this recipe by 15 to match the quantities in rib recipe; that proportion worked well. A few preparation notes: don't add salt til the end, since chicken stock has salt. Before pureeing, strain out stock and add it back judiciously or you will have soup instead of puree. When multiplying recipe, did not need all the butter and cream, just small portions. Can make ahead, & its simplicity allowed my 10 yr old son to help! Will make this again; yum!

Delicious and easy. I had already steamed the cauliflower when I found this so I put the cauliflower into my food processor with some broth, butter, salt and cream. Skipped the garlic.

This is the recipe for those who are looking for a way to get more cauliflower in their diet. I don't care for plain, steamed cauliflower but I felt guilty serving it with a creamy sauce. This is a good compromise, I used milk instead of cream and it was fine.

Okay, but it needs some doctoring... a little nutmeg, parm, more salt and butter... I'll try again with tweaks. Browning it with parm under the broiler sounds great.

Left out the butter and the garlic on accident, and it was still delicious. Maybe because I used homemade chicken broth.

Oh my! I've tried many puréed/mashed cauliflower recipes and this is, hands down, the best one. None of the others used broth and I think that's what makes this exceptional. I don't eat chicken or beef so I used vegetable broth. I also used more garlic and added onions. I didn't have any heavy cream so I used half & half and a lot less broth (I think I would have used less anyway). I simmered the ingredients in the amount called for but I then drained the cauliflower, put in about 1/3 of the broth and the other ingredients, started to pureé, then added a little bit of broth until it was the right consistency. I made honey-ginger salmon so I added wasabi to my serving as gmshier suggested and it was a great, asian- influenced combination. The leftovers are sans wasabi so we can eat it later like that, add wasabi or I may even try some curry next time. This is an instant fave; I'll definitely be making this regularly.

Loved it! My guests could not figure out what they were eating...grits? polenta? turnips? Will make again. Just a note, this is for one serving. I used a whole head of cauliflower, added too much broth, had to cook without lid to thicken. Go easy on broth, you can always add more later, I think the cauliflower once cooked adds liquid to it.

Really good and simple, especially as a substitute for mashed potatoes. I did make one modification, instead of the one clove of garlic I roasted an entire head and added it all. It had a really nice flavor, I would recommend it.

Great recipe. Agree with others that less chicken broth is needed. I've made this a few times now, once with cream, once with milk and once without any dairy. We thought the version without any milk or cream tasted best, but we don't like heavy, creamy foods. Great basic recipe to change up however you want!

going with the wasabi style - fantastic. have now tried it as a puree (food processor) and mashed with a potato masher. Both work but create different products. I prefer the mashed variety myself, but definitely recommend the wasabi powder - I added a teaspoon of wasabi powder to this and it was spicy, doubled up on the cauliflower and left the wasabi at a tsp, it produced a nice flavour with the heat at the back, and the delicate cauliflower at the front....mmmm mmmmm good!!!!!

Rating: 4
Totally easy! Had my food processor for over a decade and finally brought it out to try this recipe. The puree was light, creamy, and full of cauliflower goodness! Now I'm trying to search for more recipes that ask for purees. Now there's no turning back!

Good and simple, tasty, but for me/us, a tad on the bland side. I was serving it with a beet risotto and a spicy flank steak, and decided the recipe needed some zing...Added a teaspoon of prepared wasabi paste to this recipe ane it really finished it off perfectly!

This is so easy and quite tasty and with the exception of adding too much broth, you can't wreck it. I steamed the cauliflower, then put in butter, no cream, s&p, and broth as needed. Using the immersion blender makes it even easier.

I also steamed the cauliflower and added a lot more garlic (but that's really my issue - I have a serious problem with always adding more garlic and I love it every time), and it was delicious. Very satisfying. I've been trying to find good substitutes for starchy, carb-loaded sides which are still as satisfying as mashed potatoes, and this was no disappointment.

Rating: 4
I find that it's really best when steamed. You don't lose any of the nutritional value that way, and it won't get overcooked. Also, I brown the chopped garlic separately and mix it in after the cauliflower is mashed. Sea salt and pepper and some crushed red pepper finishes it off. Sometimes I add some fresh cilantro for color and a twist.

Rating: 4
Excellent! I steamed the cauliflower with the garlic so it didn't get mushy. I used more garlic than called for.

This is very good and always surprises people, which is fun, but if you follow the directions as written, isn't it really runny? And if you cook off the liquid, doesn't it make the cauliflower extra mushy, which has the same effect when adding the butter and cream? I have made it three times, and from now on I'm draining the cauliflower before adding the butter and cream. I also have always added a little Parmesan.

I was attempting to make a standard cauliflower soup and got carried away with a new grey salt I was trying, so it came out way too salty. Looking on Epicurious as to find something to do with it, I saw this recipe that was remarkably similar, so I thought other readers would want to know how I solved my problem (first, I froze the puree and we went out for dinner that night, but later): I cooked the puree down even further, then added a bit of cream, and used it as the base for a lamb dish. I took 4 shallow white bowls and put a cup of the puree at the bottom, topped it with a brasied lamb shank, and scattered sauteed mushrooms (shitake, button, baby bellas w/sherry) over it all. The saltiness of the puree was a good foil for the meaty lamb. I also didn't add much salt to the mushrooms to counteract the cauliflower. I very much agree with an earlier reviewer who stated that this dish appears to be a cross between polenta and potato, yet contains neither. My guests were stumped and a potential disaster was saved. Thanks epicurious.

Rating: 3
I made this with half-and-half and while I really liked it, I felt it was a bit over rich/over bland. I'm wondering if I'd like it better with some pepper and maybe with evaporated milk instead of the half-and-half. Or maybe I should have gone ahead and tried heavy cream the first time -- maybe the half-and-half just wasn't a good choice. I was trying to cut the fat a bit. I'm definitely going to try it again, but not sure whether I should up the seasonings, lower the fat still more, or some combination.

Rating: 3
Low-carbing it, so I gave this a try. I was careless adding liquid when blending, and the result was tasty but too runny. Since I'd multiplied the recipe for a whole head of cauliflower, there were leftovers, and taking the idea of one reviewer, I added more broth and made a soup, which had an outstanding silky texture. Better yet, it's the perfect base for adding just about anything - sauteed mushrooms, ham, sausage, chicken, cheese, vegetables, roasted garlic...all kinds of tasty variations. I keep meaning to try the mashed thing again...

I thought this was just so-so, but I would make it again because it's easy and different and I like cauliflower. I used to have a recipe for cauliflower with "hurry curry' sauce which was really good, but now I can't find it. I did experiment one time with the cauliflower puree recipe adding some turmeric and curry powder to it which was pretty good--would be a good accompaniment for Indian food

This doesn't really need another rave, but I can't resist. My husband licked his ramekin clean and begged me to tell him what he'd just eaten. What an easy and delicious recipe and healthy to boot. I used half and half cause that's what I had. Didn't use the broth left in the pan so it wouldn't be too thin. Topped with grated Parmesan and ran under the broiler, as suggested. Didn't quite believe all the reviewers until I actually tasted it. Super!

This was by far the most surprising of all recipes that I have ever tried. I was a little worried about the idea of pureeing a cauliflower into "mash potatoes", but waht I discovered was a texture exactly the same as a potato and the flavor, knocks the potato out! I will definitely add this recipe to my repetoire minus the chicken broth.

This recipe is amazing tasty, yet very low calorie...the perfect combination - in my opinion. I would suggest putting only 1-2 tsp. of cream if at all, and when putting it through the blender, only include 1-2 tbsp. of the broth that it was simmering in for moisture... otherwise it might turn out too watery. Delicious!

This was EASY and very tasty. I used soy milk and margarine to keep it dairy free; it was rich and creamy. This is great comfort food; looks like velvety mashed potatoes without the carbs. Now I'd like to try broccoli puree.....

I was very happy with this. I filed it away because it sounded interesting, but pulled it out when my partner went low-carb and we needed a substitute for mashed potatoes. It was perfect; different from potatoes, but none the lesser...very tasty. The stick blender made it a one dish prep too! (This first time it came out thinner than I would want, but I will just simmer it with the lid off next time.)

Delicious! We love cauliflower but I really wasn't sure about having it pureed. I followed the ingredients verbatum but I did puree in the blender. Next time I won't.

When I first read this I thought it would be a culinary version of www.ugh.com. It seemed like something Sophia Petrello from 'The Golden Girls' would be served at Shady Pines. Yikes. Fortunately for all us, its a simple and elegant recipe that tastes better than one would imagine. Add a little more garlic for a more pungent aroma. Also, this is NOT a cauliflowerized version of mashed potatoes which is the impression many readers could have. It actually holds up on its own, and with the right presentation could end up on a posh dinner table as well. Only tip : I was tempted to try this with broccoli and the resulting dish was a slop-glop fest that looked like pureed green bugs. I'm sorry if that spoilt your appetite but its really the way it is. Also, using small shavings of smoked sausage really enhances the flavor.
