This was so good that while serving 8, I made a double batch and it was gone. One thing, it does tell you what to do with the ginger slices used in the syrup, after it cooled, I chopped my finely and put back in. Doing the was great for the flavor but eliminates the ability to use the whip cream dispenser as it clogs.
