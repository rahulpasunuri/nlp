I have not yet tried this recipe but I'm curious if it would work with a cupcake tin sprayed with baking spray for mini tortillas?

Followed recipe precisely as written except for the addition of one diced sweet bell pepper to the onions once they were sweated, and it turned out very nicely. Lots of eye appeal and delicious!

delicious! I too had a problem with consistency. I up the garlic and chorizo. used 1 lb shredded potatoes. i added crema instead of sour cream, and it lent a lovely sweetness to the dish. Next time I will used more chorizo and cook 5 minutes longer. I will refrigerate a day prior to ensure firmness. I used a cheesecake pan and it was very easy to get it to look beatiful.

I too had the problem with eggs falling apart. I will make it again and make sure potatoes are smaller and dish has been refrigerated before cutting. Having said that, the potato mixture is delicious by itself! I would just make that and serve it with scrambled eggs.

This was very tasty. I see the complaints about it falling apart when you cut into it. It cut much better once it had been in the fridge for a few hours. Perhaps if there was less sour cream it would hold better? I used less pototo than called for and a litttle finely chopped red pepper for colour. I also put the potato-chorizo mixture at the bottom of a 2 inch deep round skillet that could go into the oven with a generous amount of olive oil on the bottom. Then I poured in the egg on top. Once it was done baking I let it cool a little and flipped it onto a plate - it popped out beautifully! With some thinly sliced green onions on top it made a beautiful pot luck breakfast item.

Good, but came out more like a crustless quiche. Still, I will make again, but will not call it a tortilla. Have to come up with another name for my guests.

OK-this makes a LOT- -a very generous recipe BUT beware...it does tend to fall apart more than other frittata type dishes I've made. You really need a fork to eat it!

einerson, I wonder if you tried cutting while still too hot? This is a fantastic recipe, I hope you try again! I made it for Christmas Day breakfast and was a total success. I found this fabulous chorizo which I think is the key to this meal. I sliced the potatoes with a veggie slicer to make them extra thin and put the potato mixture at the bottom of the pan (this helps with the cutting and serving by the way), and the eggs on top. I did not use the cream or cheese because my husband is lactose intolerant, still a great dish. I read some reviews complaining that they would not use the cheese in the REAL Spanish tortilla...so what? this is the beauty of cooking, you can add this, remove that, you can always make it your own. I'm definitely making this again.

I would give it 3 to 4 forks for flavor, but was disappointed in how difficult it was to cut into bite size serving pieces. It was likely cooked, but the custard was definitely set as indicated in the recipe. I was able to salvage enough presentable pieces from the outer edges for our party, but it could have been a disaster if I was planning on this without several other offerings! After cutting, I just let it come to room temp for serving as I was afraid to transfer and and try to reheat. The leftovers (including the center portion that I couldn't serve to guests was better warm). I may try again because I love the combo of flavors, but will either bake longer or possibly bake in a slightly larger pan.

I made this for an hors d'oeuvre, it disappeared, and 2 people asked for the recipe. It's great hot or cold and I will definitely make it again!

I added some chopped up baby broccoli in with the onions, substituted pepper jack cheese for an extra kick, and doubled the recipe to make the squares thick enough to serve as an entree. I'm eating it right now for lunch - YUM!

This dish was a hit with my Daytime Gourmet group. My only change was to used crumbled goat cheese instead of cheddar. I put the potato mixture into the pan and poured the egg mixture over it, so it looked pretty smooth on top.

I made this as a starter and loved it. Am planning to serve for a lunch on a houseboat trip soon. Very tasty

I just came home from a collaborative cocktail party and this dish was my favorite. I had to come here to look up the recipe before I forgot. It was delicious as a tapa, but I think I would make it for brunch. Even the vegetarian at the party had to have her own piece after delicately tasting a bite and eating around the meat!

I am very disapponted to see sour cream and cheese as ingredients in a Spanish tortilla. This is a very americanized version, a real Spanish tortilla NEVER has these ingredients.

I made this twice over the holiday season and they were a hit with my picky crowd. Easy to make. Tasty. Definitely a crowd pleaser. Only 1 issue with recipe -- potatoes took about 30 minutes to soften, not 10 like it says in the recipe. Other than that, it was wonderful. The key to the whole recipe is to use high quality chorizo

This is a great do ahead dish. I made it for 2 small gatherings and froze half (cut it up and froze it in bite size pieces). Reheated it while still frozen and they were just as great. DO not bother if you dont use spicy chorizo or some other kind sausage (andouille?) Everyone loved it. If you are too lazy to dice the potatoes you can buy them already diced! Try it!

This was more like a breakfast casserole than a true Spanish tortilla. It reminded me of hash with eggs. It lacked flavor - maybe I needed better chorizo. Anyway, I'll stick to the traditional Spanish tortilla on the stovetop method.

much more work than I expected - chopping and prep-time wise - but enjoyed by guests and was great to make the day before the party, then heat up.

This was very good! You may need to add more oil to prevent sticking to the pan, when cooking the onions, chorizo and potatoes. I prepared it in advance, once chilled, I took it back out and cut it into bite size pieces, arranged it on an oven-proof platter, then put it back into the refidgerator. It warmed up nicely in the oven just as guests were arriving. Great appetizer!
