This recipe is amazing... I made some whole grain english muffins and was looking for a recipe to use them in. this one was it! i have made it several times i like to add tuna salad to one side of the muffin and make a tuna melt version! Delicious! my husband love it too!

These were so easy and so good. I served them as an accompaniment to a pasta chicken salad. I used sliced cheese instead of shredded and placed it over the bread crumb/basil/garlic mixture.

Fantastic! Simple and quick and tasty. I substituted smoked mozzarella.

So easy. So delicious. This is great with a simple salad or soup. I used 1 1/2 slices of provolone cheese instead of grueyere and I was pleased and cannot wait to try with the suggested cheese. Most any cheese will work, I believe. Don't go overboard on the garlic, remember that it is still pretty raw. This is one that will stay in my rotation and I will adjust it for whatever I have on hand.

Yum--I don't know how you can go wrong with these ingredients! This recipe makes a very tasty mid-week dinner. It seemed a little decadent with all that cheese, but it was worth it!

I have made this dish several times and it is always well received. Use fresh picked tomatoes and make extra topping. The topping that falls off melts on the cookie sheet and makes wonderful "chips".

Just terrific! Use good ingredients, season it well. Would be great as a side dish without the muffin.

Well, I did have the gruYEre & was still quite disappointed. It was very dry. I don't think gruyere is what it needed. It needed a semi soft cheese the melted down over the tomato. Even American cheese would have worked. Disappointed - it sounded kinda good.

These were a hit, especially with my kids. I didn't have any gruyere, so I substituted a slice of cheddar, then mixed & sprinkled the crumbs, garlic and basil on top.
