Not too difficult, and they have a great texture. I would recommend cutting down on the sugar though-I used heavy cream instead of whipping cream and reduced the sugar by a little. Wonderful, quick, and easy!

Slightly too powdery of a texture for me.

This recipe is great! I used an ice cream scoop to scoop the dough rather than rolling it out. You get uniform round scones that way. I also omitted the glaze because I put an icing on top. For the icing I used powdered sugar, maple extract, and milk. The combo reminded me of a way better version of the Starbuck's maple oat scone.

This is my favorite scone recipe. I take them to the office and get many repeat requests for them. I bake mine for only about 12 minutes and drizzle with a glaze made from maple flavoring, powdered sugar and milk.

These were the most delicious scones I've ever tasted. I could not find maple extract so I used vanilla. Also used heavy cream and chopped up dates. ABSOLUTELY TO DIE FOR!!!

These was delicious. Had to go out and buy some maple extract, but worth it as I will be making these again and again.

The better recipe for maple scones is the Maple Tea Scones on this site. Nothing replaces the taste of pure maple syrup. Maple flavoring/extract just doesn't cut it. This one is not as rich or as substantial as the other scone. Try the other one!!

The maple extract I found at my grocery store had artificial flavoring, which I didn't want to use, so I used vanilla extract and replaced the sugar with turbinado sugar (like Sugar in the Raw). Not exactly maple-y but tasty all the same. Everyone in my house loves them.

Great scones! I will definitely make these again. My husband and daughter loved them, too. I followed the recipe, but added a maple glaze to half the batch after they cooled. At that point, we had to exit the kitchen so we wouldn't keep eating them. :)

I'm a caterer and have made this about 20 times. It is one of the most requested scones from my repeat customers. It can get a little on the dry side so be careful not to over-bake it. I do use the food processor to mix first 4 ingredients and to cut in the butter like for a pie crust. Don't try to sub the maple extract with maple syrup-doesn't have enough flavor. Really good!

Perfect! I have tried many scone recipes but most disappoint me. My husband took one bite and swooned that "this was the taste he had been missing his whole life". The only change I made was to pat the dough into a circle and cut into wedges.

I have made this along with another scone recipe for at least 3 years. Both recipes have always gotten rave reviews. Its time consuming but I don't find it complicated. I have usually tripled the recipe. My family really enjoys eating them up. My son and I are making these scones for his kindergarten class, for St. Patricks Day.

My first time making scones. Seems this recipe is a GEM! I left out the maple extract and pecans and put in a bit of pure vanilla, frozen blueberries, and white chocolate chips instead - YUM! I held back the whites from the separated eggs (as yolks are only called for in recipe) and whipped those for glazing. Also sprinkled each heavily with sugar before baking. Cut into 1-1/2" rounds, baked around 10 minutes for small, almost bite-size delights!

easy, delicious...great maple flavor and a light crumby texture. Definitely only bake for 13 minutes as suggested by other reviewers. I made a glaze with a bit of grade B maple syrup (the darker one) and some powered sugar; everyone who eats them raves.

These are soooooo good! I took some to work and my coworkers raved about them. They are the best scones I have ever eaten. Moist and light. Baked 13 minutes in convection oven. Perfect.

These are pretty tasty. It's important that the butter be chilled and not room temperature. I think those of you that had problems with it being too sticky might not of used chilled butter. Anyway I mixed up some milk,powdered sugar, vanilla, and maple extract to drizzle over the top. Also I just patted the mixture into a 1/2 round shape and cut it like a pizza.

How would you adjust the recipe to use real maple syrup, not just maple extract? I will use the maple extract if I have to, but maple syrup is like the food of the gods in my house and in a MAPLE-pecan scone recipe I would want to use it! Would it alter the texture too much? I'm not incredibly experienced with scones.

Delicious scones!! FYI to all of those who thought the dough was too sticky and added more flour...it's supposed to be sticky. Adding more flour will cause the dough to be too dry which is why your cooking time is reduced. If you love makeing scones, spend the money on a scone pan at William Sonoma. You will end up with bakery perfect scones every time.

This is an absolutely fabulous scone recipe. I patted it out into a square and then cut it into 12 even pieces. It would be great to serve at a brunch. I agree that toasting the pecans is a must!! I'll definitely make this again and again.

This is a great recipe. The dough is sticky and you will have to knead in some additional flour. I pat the dough into a square and cut triangles. This saves me from having to re-roll dough. I worry that I might make it too tough. Besides 2 inch circles like the recipe directs are pretty small and they look more like a cookie than a scone. And do take up the suggestion to add maple icing, it makes the scone.

Followed the advice about baking the scones for 13 minutes, any longer they would have burned. Also needed extra flour as the dough was too sticky, wanted to be careful not add too much, didn't want dry scones. I found them to be very good by themselves without butter. Plan on trying the maple icing next go round, I bet this would really make it yummy.

Another great recipe from this site! These scones were out of this world and easy to make. As other reviewers noted, I too had to use more flour in the dough due to its being too sticky at first, and it only took 13 minutes in a convection oven. I made these a few times already. The last time I substituted soy milk for some of the cream (1/4 cup cream, and 1/2 cup soy milk - to make it a little healthier and lower calorie) and they were still outstanding.

Very yummy. The breakfast casserole mentioned in the same issue if fabulous. Makes a nice super bowl breakfast for us.

This is the best maple scone ever!! I've tried many maple scones at many places and tried many different recipes, but no one was good as this one. I also made a maple glaze to drizzle it over it and came out so great!

I made this for Easter. They were absolutely delicious! Very moist. I made a simple maple glaze with powdered sugar, milk and a few drops of maple extract to drizzle over and sprinkled with finely chopped toasted pecans. My only complaint is that I didn't double the recipe! Also they were done in 13 minutes in my convection oven. Don't overcook!

This was my first time making scones. I'm a wonderful cook but don't usually like the exact science of baking. I followed the recipe to the letter but found I had to add more flour because the dough was too sticky to work with. They still turned out great - not too dry, not too sweet. I will definately make them again.

Very flavorful scone. Easy to make too. I made them earlier this afternoon and they are just about all gone!

This recipe is fabulous! These were my first home-made scones and I was surprised at how great they turned out. I highly recommend serving them with the whipped butter & maple syrup spread. YUM YUM!

How easy and how delicious. I did not have maple extract and so I used a top-grade light maple syrup and wow was the delicious. Didn't even need butter.

I've made these twice now for weekend guests both to rave reviews. My favorite scone recipe.

One of the best scone recipes that I have made. They are simple to make and have a wonderful flavor that works either for breakfast or tea. Definitely toast the pecans, it really brings out the flavor and adds a nice crunch.
