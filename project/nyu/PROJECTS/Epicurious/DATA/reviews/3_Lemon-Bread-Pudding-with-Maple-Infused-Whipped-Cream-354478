I am no custard expert, and this was an utter failure for me. This was also my first bread pudding per se. I used 2c cream and 2c skim milk because 4c of cream seemed excessive to me. It didn't set in the least. Was it the milk? I have no idea. I suspect the steps in the recipe are out of order (as it has you pouring the mixture on the bread before you mix the eggs and sugar; I mixed the eggs and sugar, then whisked in everything else and poured it over the bread). When you're cooking it, it's hard to tell whether it's set because there's bread floating on top. Though the consistency was an utter failure, the flavor was good. So, I guess I'd only recommend this particular recipe if you're an accomplished bread pudding (or custard) maker and looking for something different and you know how to fix it. If you're trying this for the first time for a party, I wouldn't...

I made this for our gourmet cooking group dinner - the theme was Western Canada - perfect! It was a big hit - very rich. I would try it next time with whole milk in the custard and the heavy cream only for whipping. We had some leftovers with no whipped cream to serve with it so we stirred some maple syrup into sour cream and topped it with that. Tasted wonderful also.
