Wow...this was delicious! Will definitely be making this again. In lieu of pineapple, I added green mango for tartness while cooking the fruit and then added a ripe mango with banana toward the end. Left out the papaya and pineapple. This was an excellent breakfast, but with a little ice cream would also make a great desert. Highly recommend.

Divine! I made this for Mother's Day and received rave reviews. I used brandy instead of rum and white rice flour instead of wheat flour since one person has gluten allergies. The crepes were perfectly light and delicious! I also topped with a little sprinkled nutmeg. Lastly, this recipe served three people with 4 crepes each. I ate a couple that I botched as am pregnant.... We all could have eaten more was soooo yummy!

Made this for Sunday Brunch today and it was fabulous!! I left the rum out of the crepes batter but the rum flavor in the butter sauce was just enough. Next time, though, I will dissolve the sugar in warmed rum before adding it to the butter-it was a little grainy. For fruit I used bananas, papaya, mango and blueberries. Perfect !!!

I love crepes and this recipe was excellent! The rum butter sauce was perfect although next time I'll only use two tablespoons instead of three because it was a bit too strong for my tastes. All in all a really good, quick recipe for a different weekend breakfast or brunch.
