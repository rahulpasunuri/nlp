These are seriously amazing! Great make ahead addition to any event. They last for several days. But I would say after a 4 or 5 days, the flavor starts to degrade a little--sort of all blending together and losing a little of the freshness.

These are amongst our traditional repertoire for Thanksgiving now, but we typically add a small amount of finely chopped fresh rosemary (or we just throw in a few whole sprigs with the marinade).

I made these one year and they were easy and tasted awesome. I lost the issue but the recipe haunted me until, alas, I found it online. These olives make for an awesome hostess gift too. Remember, they need a few days to brine and meld the different flavors.

These olives are a Thanksgiving tradition at our house now. A delicious and easy way to dress up ordinary olives.

Unique flavor. My Thanksgiving guests were mixed - those who generally liked olives didn't like this recipe.

I used only Kalamatas and they marinated for about a week. I used orange oil instead of the orange peel. These were ok. The orange flavor barely came through. I won't make these again.

Was a nice change of appetizers. Used Kalamta olives and the Jumbo green olives. A very nice taste!!! Served it with an assortment of cheese, crackers, fish and nuts. Easy to prepare.

Really, really good. If you like olives, these become addictive! Highly recommend and will definately make again and again. A no brainer!!!!

These were a big hit. When you refrigerate the olives, the oil will congeal, so you'll need to bring them to room temp before serving. This only takes a few minutes.

These olives are fabulous - a great snack before a lovely dinner. The orange is not too overpowering, it just adds a nice, fresh taste. We like ours with more red pepper and a little more garlic!

We made this for our traditional Thanksgiving get together and everyone RAVED over the wonderful flavors. Paired especially well with holiday spiced nuts and a wonderful assortment of good cheeses. We served with a Beujolais and everyone was in heaven!
