I love coconut and raspberries! I've made these bars for Christmas cookie exchanges and family get-togethers with great reviews. I might try cutting back on some of the sugar. And definitely use thick, cooked-type jam, not freezer jam, which is softer and makes the crust a little damp. Also, bake until the coconut gets nice and toasted looking. This is part of my permanent recipe file now!

These just weren't my style, which I think others have said. They are very sweet and sticky. I see that they were provided by someone on a boat--they are something that can be made with pantry items, so I can see why they'd be appealing in that instance. I don't think I'll make again.

I cut the recipe in half and made it in a 9 x 13" pan - that made about 48 small squares - I can't imagine eating a square the size recommended. Everyone loved them and they were extremely moist.

Wow - so good! I used apricot instead of raspberry, as that is what i had. It was a total knock out.

Very good recipe - minimal changes and some baking tips increase chances of success. BASE: MELT butter, add dry ingredients (reduce sugar to 3/4 c) and mix well. Add eggs PLUS 1 extra yolk, add and mix well. Press very hard in pan using parchment paper and a small glass or roller. CHILL until cold and hard. (Don't reduce butter or the base will fall apart.) FILLING: Quanity will vary depending upon the type used - loose, "fruit" or a cheaper "brand" type. Get extra, and use what's left over for cakes and sandwich cookies. For "looser" jams, cook the jam for 20 minutes or so over medium heat and let bubble (stirring), for about 10 minutes. Chill to room temperature before spreading on base. TOPPING: REDUCE butter by half. Use unsweetened coconut to cut sweetness. If using sweetened coconut, add an extra cup of coconut and REDUCE sugar by half. BAKING: Reduce temperature to 325. Put an oven liner on rack ABOVE the squares in the oven. This deflects heat and keeps squares from browning too fast. Bake until coconut is a nice toasted brown (quite past golden). SERVE: Cool completely, then chill until cold. They cut easily and cleanly. That's it - just made a huge batch of these for a client for a Christmas party and they turned out perfectly.

I made a variation of this I call Raspberry Cheese Cake Squares, partly because comments suggest the original was too sweet and partly because I didn't have coconut! I used the crust recipe as is, but instead of coconut for the filling, I used 8 oz. cream cheese, 1/2 cup heavy creeam, and 1/2 tsp vanilla. I also used a can of whole raspberries and thickened the liquid with 1 Tbsp cornstarch (over heat). That all got mixed with 1 stick butter, 1 cup sugar, and 2 eggs called for. Although I baked it for the same 50 minutes called for, that was too long. But still, it turned out very tasty and looked great. Next time, I will bake it for only 40 minutes, and I might use no butter and 16 oz cream cheese, like a normal cheese cake recipe.

I can see where others would like these (my grandmother would go nuts over them, for instance), but they just aren't my style. For one thing, they're REALLY sweet, and I do like sweet foods! I think they would be much better with pureed and strained fresh or frozen raspberries, rather than the jam. They badly need some tartness to offset the coconut. Also, I agree with the previous reviewer who said that they get greasy after chilling. Maybe cutting the butter in half would help.

I love this recipe and have made them several times. They are great for when you need a lot of homemade cookies but don't want to spend all day making them. And I usually have everything already on hand in my pantry for them. I have taken them to potlucks and even to funerals. I made them again last night for a bake sale fundraiser. But this time I tried something new. Instead of graham cracker crumbs I used chocolate cookie crumbs. It looked a little weird when I mixed the black cookie crumbs with the flour so I added about a quarter cup of cocoa and sifted it all together to make sure I had it all dispersed well and to get rid of any lumps of cocoa and flour. (Of course being the chocoholic that I am I needed to get some more chocolate in there.) Another trick I use is to put plastic wrap over the crust to press it into the pan with a small rolling pin. And I use about a 15 oz jar of raspberry preserves or spreadable fruit and heat it in the microwave to make it spread easier. Well these bars turned out beautiful and have been a big hit. So now I have given them a new name, Chocolate Raspberry Coconut Bars and they are absolutely fabulous!

These are fabulous! I am asked for the recipe every time I make them.I am not sure why some said they aren't finger food...they absolutely are!Just make sure you bake them at 325 and cook them as LONG as possible with out burning ( it's usually 50 minutes for me). They turn out perfect every time. The other change is to use 18 ounces of jam.

I used fresh raspberries instead of jam and loved the taste of these bars - as it everyone else who ate them. I agree they are a bit messy - will use a fork next time.

These are very pretty and delicious. I followed a suggestion and added a little more raspberry jam-it turned out fine. The only thing I found even after chilling them is that they seemed a bit greasy (and I don't tend to cook low-fat food). You probably could cut back on the butter/margarine in the topping. They were very easy to cut and serve after they had chilled for several hours. I served them on a platter with several other bar cookies. They are pretty and tasty!

Ohhhhh so easy,but my mother-in-law thinks I made it from a box.

Too sweet! I used the 100% fruit raspberry jam for less sugar. I would recommed using only a 7 ounce bag of coconut and omitting the sugar in the coconut topping.

This was very good. I served it to a group of quilters who all want the recipe. It was a bit messy to eat, use a fork. I would make this again.

Easy, excellent recipe. I baked it on the large jelly roll sheet, and did not think they were too thin, and I cut them into small squares since they are rich, and got A LOT of cookies out of the recipe.

These are the best cookies I have ever eaten. I even uses only 3/4 the amount of butter. I used a 9x13 pan because I thought they were too thin made in a jelly roll pan. (Dont forget to increase your baking time!!!!)

I would definitely make these again, with a few minor revisions. I wouldn't use two bags of coconut which overpowered the taste of the raspberry. And I'd use a little more raspberry.

This easy to create dessert is a favorite for both children and adults.

Really delicious and very sweet. I actually heated the jam up in the microave for about 40 seconds to make it easier to spread. I was tempted to mix the crust in the food processor but since it was the first time making it I followed the recipe and did it by hand.Would like to probably try the food processor next time and wondering if anyone else already has? I also used the graham cracker crumbs that come in a box.

Easy (careful spreading the jam-really stir it around with a spoon first) and always a big hit whenever I make them!!

THIS IS NOT FINGER FOOD YOU NEED A FORK. I MIGHT HAVE USED TOO MUCH JELLY, BE CAREFUL. MY SON-IN- LAW LOVED THEM SO I MAKE THEM AGAIN.
