Moist, not-too-spicy gingerbread. It is best served warm with the whipped cream, as it is a bit bland when served without it at room temperature. I didn't increase the spices and wish that I did.

I made this again with 3x the spices and 1/2 cup of molasses (because it was all I had left after the first time I made this!). Still very yummy and got rave reviews from all.

I have had many disappointing gingerbreads, so finally I have found the ultimate recipe. Moist, yummy, and so easy to make. I doubled the spices, but I think tripling them would have been better--I will try that next time.

wonderful texture, very moist without being gummy, and great flavor as well after doubling the spices

Just made this for the first time and am so glad I did! One of those rare cakes that works well with half whole wheat flour and half white -- still had a wonderful moist cake texture and the spices and molasses flavor came through strong. I might even try it with all whole wheat flour next time. Really delicious, and don't skimp on the spices -- I doubled them all, added a little nutmeg, and it could still handle a little more.

This has been a standard at my house for the last 6 years. Double and more the spice. YUM!

This has become my favorite gingerbread recipe...almost. I make it without the 1/2 cup shortening and with only half of the sugar. Great with warm applesauce.

Thought this gingerbread was a little too sweet. I might reduce the sugar to 3/4 of a cup next time. Doubled the spices as suggested. Will triple next time. Baked in a 9x9 silicone pan. Was a little dark on the bottom edges at 45 minutes.

This was just what I was looking for. Good flavor and texture. Easy too. I cooked mine in an 8x8 pyrex pan and it took nearly an hour.

I hate the smell and taste of molassass but i was making this recipie for a sick friend. He loved it and it wasn't overly hard.

Gingerbread is one of my favorite desserts. This one is really good. I doubled all the spices and let it sit for 24 hours loosely covered before eating. Worth the wait. This one's a keeper

This was wonderful! I baked it in a 9" pie pan and it came out very well. 45 minutes was pretty much perfect. I also doubled the ginger and added a bit more cinnamon - I didn't have ground cloves, but it was still good. Try this recipe!

I too doubled the spices, and added nutmeg...it was a smash hit...

A wonderfully moist cake for people who aren't crazy about cake. And it makes the house smell heavenly on autumn days!

It was easy to make and came out very moist and flavorful. I doubled the spices and served it warm with vanilla ice cream. It also heated up very well in the microwave the next day.

I make this with between 50% and 100% more of the spices. And, as for the comment about it being a bit too much for an 8 x8 pan - I find that making it in a pan that is a bit too small actually makes it better. Don't cook till knife comes out clean - stop a bit short of that and it is even better.

Look no futher--this is the best gingerbread recipe I have found. I was a little worried when the batter was thin, but it bakes into a beautiful moist desert. Definitely add more ginger, though, as some of the other cooks suggested. I think that goes for a lot of gingerbreads--if you like it spicy, then add more. I used non-hydrogenated shortening for this (Spectrum brand). It worked great, as it always does. Once again, this was terrific!

With a little extra ginger, this gingerbread is moist and delicious. The molasses flavor is quite appealing.

Rating: 3
I agree with the other reviewers that the texture of the gingerbread (moist, tender, not too dense) was just excellent. I found the molasses flavor very strong, but not unpleasant. Next time I may substitute honey or corn syrup for some of the molasses, and punch up the ginger flavor with some minced candied ginger. Definitely worth making again.

What? Something named "Kentucky" with no bourbon? LOL. This is very good gingerbread. It's also a fairly forgiving recipe. I accidently left out the salt, and it didn't matter a whit. I served it with whipped cream to which I'd added a bit of ginger liquer. Very good!

This was my first try at gingerbread. I adored the moist, dense, super-fine texture and thought the molasses taste was striking but not overwhelming. The second time I made it, I used heaping teaspoons for the spices, reduced the fat to 2/3 cup total (half butter, half corn oil) and poured the batter over a pear-caramel base for an upside-down cake - scrumptious! My only cavil is that the recipe seems to make more batter than will fit in a 9-inch square pan. I use the square pan plus a small loaf tin.

This was a nice dessert, but in need of much for ginger. It comes out quite moist, with molasses being the predominant taste. It wasn't what I was expecting but I liked it.

I made this recipe for the first time (and with some trepidation, I confess, due to those one-fork reviews) for a school potluck. Thank goodness the gingerbread was a success (moist, lovely fine texture, and nicely spiced), and I received several compliments. I used 2 tsp. ginger and 1-1/2 tsp. cinnamon as well as a 9x13 pan. My only concern is how long to bake with the larger pan--I think I removed the gingerbread at 40 min. and it still seemed just a tad overdone.

This was really delicious with the spices doubled. SOOOO moist and flavorful! Definitely the best gingerbread i've ever had!

This one is worse than the Christmas Gingerbread Cake with Maple Whipped Cream. This one was not edible. It was black and so strong in Molasses flavour it should be called Molasses cake. There is not enough ginger to even taste ginger. I would never make this or the other one I mentioned here. Horrible, Yuck, Could someone Please send me a good, light, moist cake with really strong ginger flavour! Cathlicgal@aol.com

I had no trouble making this bread. I found the end product to have a texture similar to that of zucchini or pumpkin bread- delightful! Perhaps a little more ginger could be used. In addition, one cannot go wrong by adding toasted pecans to the batter. Simply delicious!

I've made this recipe (doubling the spices) a few times now and everyone I've ever served it to has asked for the recipe. I generally prefer chocolate but this gingerbread is just incredible: deeply spicy and very rich with a great texture. I did use a considerably larger pan than recommended (more like 9x13) and it worked out great. You have got to try it...

I used this recipe because of the glowing reviews. My attempt at this turned out to be one of those legendary cooking disasters of which I'll be reminded by my family when I'm 80. I followed the recipe exactly, but my cake burbled over the edge of the pan for almost 20 minutes of the cooking time. I lost about 3 cups of batter in the bottom of my oven. I had to cook the cake an extra 20 minutes to ensure it was done. What did remain in the pan was flavourful. I consulted with a chef I know, and she advised that the fat (shortening, butter, molasses, eggs) to flour ratio was way off. I won't be trying this again, as it took forever to clean the singed ginerbread out of my oven.

Very yummy and nourishing! I would increase the spices also.

Best gingerbread I have ever tasted. Moist, dense and flavorful. I used extra ginger and served it with a lemon sauce and a dollop of whipped cream, just like my mother used to do.

I am 43, and if I live to be 100, I will never feel as if I "know it all". I read the first review, and liked the idea of doubling the ginger amount, and did such. I also agreed with the 2 day "sit" before eating, to bring more moisture to the product. But my reasoning has always been that recipes including oil, or shortening such as crisco, become moister as these less solid fats (softer than butter) redistribute into the product with a little rest. As for this recipe, all I can say is that even though I am not passionate for gingerbread on a regular basis, there are times when I want it badly. I have tried a multitude of variations, and this is the one for my permanent collection. I won't even try (don't quote me) another version. It was moist, without being "gummy". And the spice ratio (using 2 tsps. ginger) was perfect for my taste. And my final comment is that in this recipe, as in others for cookies, and pie crusts, I have found that a combination of butter and shortening, produces a flavor and texture duet, that just butter, or just shortening doesn't match. Enjoy!

This was good... but even better if you double the amount of ginger and let the gingerbread sit (covered loosely in plastic wrap) for a couple of days after baking so the molasses had time to draw in moisture from the air. Spicy and moist and yummy!
