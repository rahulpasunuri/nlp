I was all set to make this but realized I had several other dishes to cook and couldn't devote so much effort to just this one. I used the poblano, spices and kolonji in the easy cornbread recipe on this site and it turned out good. I would like to make this when I have more time.

My fiance and I have tried to make this twice with no luck. It comes out extremely runny in the middle. We baked it for about 2.5 hours before we gave up the second time. It seems like the foil should be altogether left off. If anyone else makes this please post if it worked for you and/or what you changed to make it work. The taste of the mush was so good. I would love to eat it when it looks like the photo.

I forgot to add (wish one could edit these posts!), Iyer states, "Nigella is also called 'black cumin'....). I found mine at an Indian market.

I'm sorry I don't have a review as yet but a suggestion and tidbit to share. When I make, I will save the drained corn water and use for the suggested water. Why waste it? For those unable to locate Nigella seeds, Iyer (660 Curries) writes: "In India they go by 'kalonji' (mistakenly called 'onion seeds', possibly because of a remote resemblance to the flavor of onions)."
