I've made this recipe with and without the tomato compote, with cod and halibut, and it has been excellent every time. I didn't think it was difficult or time consuming. I threw the mushrooms in a food processor and pulsed a few times to save time. (I already had the food processor out to make the breadcrumbs anyway.) The mushroom herb crust is substantial enough to serve as the starch, so we just have some simple green beans or asparagus on the side to round out the meal. This recipe is great!

This recipe has great flavor but I think too much of the mushroom-herb crust. If you follow the recipe you will have a nicely browned and slightly crispy topping. It is a little time consuming with the compote, crust and final sauce. I used red snapper and a fish bouillon cube. All in all worth a repeat.

Wow, I don't know what we did wrong, we followed to the letter but the mound of messy crumbling (albeit nicely seasoned) breadcrumbs made an unappealing dish and the crumb mountain itself had an unfortunate dry texture. We scraped it off and the fish with tomato compote was nice-- too bad for the hours of prep.

Well, where should I start! This was a fantastic dish which I changed quite a bit. Since my cholestral is a little on the high side I did not use the 5 tablespoons of butter in the stuffing, instead I used 1-2 tablspoons of olive oil. Also, I had 3 cups of brown rice that I cooked two nights ago and used that instead of breadcrumbs since I am, also, concerned about food without value. I skipped the garlic and shallots, which would have been great but the dish was so wonderful, it did not need the additional step. And then I used a half cup of clam juice that I poured into the glass dish after rubbing with olive oil and placing the fish inside. I will make this, again, real soon! Yum!!!

Very good and interesting; worthy of serving to company. That said... I have to confess that I took part of this recipe and combined it with another to make a slightly different dish. I skipped the tomatoes, made the cod with the mushroom crust, (just used the fish stock; no garlic/shallots) and used a different sauce. Sorry. I used a Pinot Noir sauce which is made by carmelizing sugar and adding wine with rosemary; reducing and then adding butter at the end. I happened to have some of this leftover sauce in the freezer, so I just made the mushroom crust, coated the cod, roasted it in a pan with fish stock and then served it on the wine sauce. It was very good, and I'm submitting this just as an alternate idea.

This was tasty, but not quite worth the amount of work -- and I like fussy recipes. This will take some tinkering with to make it truly worthwhile.

this dish is very easy to make with wonderful results and I have made this with sword fish as well as cod

This is tasty, especially the sauce, I used Pineau de Charentes vs. fish stock. However, the prepation was tedious and I don't think the results warranted the effort.

This a guaranteed winner.

Loved it! However, I did not make the tomato compote because I wasn't in the mood (may try it next time). I must say that I am perplexed regarding the difficulty of this recipe and fail to see how it is "not for novices," I actually thought that for such a great tasting dish it was very little preparation.

Not only is this recipe good on fish, I have made the stuffing to be put inside cornish hens. It is fabulous.

This recipe is not for novices, Yet the result is as delicious as beautiful. Take your time and follow the directions. Don't use shortcuts on the breadcrumbs. I learned from my mistakes. ENJOY!!

Great flavor! I used too much dried breadcrumbs. Next time I will eliminate 1/2-1 cup of the breadcrumbs from the recipe. Couldn't find fish stock so I used the clam juice but it came out wonderfully!

This was a bit tedious but a well-rounded, flavorful recipe. I garnished with watercress sprigs for a colorful presentation and added texture.
