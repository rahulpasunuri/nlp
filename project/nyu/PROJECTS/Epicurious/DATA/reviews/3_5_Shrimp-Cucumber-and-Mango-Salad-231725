Dijon mustard dressing has a lovely tangy kick, matches well with the cucumber and mango. Easy to make, great salad - used living butter lettuce as cups and really enjoyed the finished product.

Our dinner club used the complete menu in March 2005 BA.This salad was nothing special. On the other hand, never know if the recipe was really followed. Ha!

Nice summer salad with a great combination of refreshing flavors. Simple and tasty.

Salad is good but pour dressing on to just coat, otherwise it is way too much and overpowering. I should have read the other reviews first!

Not sure if it was just the midwest shrimp that are subpar on a good day, but I didn't like this recipe. I made it the night before like a reviewer suggested and found the dressing got watery. I just didn't like the flavor combo and found it kindof okay. I wouldn't make it again. Hope others have more luck.

Great for a day a at the beach... Used Kiwi instead of cucumber and terragon istead of Dill, worked delicious!

This was solid, but not so good that it warrants three forks (which is the rating for "Delicious"). Nice for a quick dinner when you don't want to turn on the stove, assuming you buy pre-cooked shrimp from your fishmonger. I added avocado, and I used Hellman's Light Mayo in the dressing to make it a little healthier. I found I only needed to use about two- thirds of the dressing. Pleasant, but not spectacular.

Served as first course to "strangers" at a dinner party. All LOVED IT - even my husband who hates mangos. Agree recipe makes 2x the dressing needed. goof proof

I halved the dressing, using just 1T sugar, skipped the dill, and added 1 tsp minced ginger and 2 cloves garlic, also minced. Delicious and super easy!

This is an exceptional no-cook summer meal. The sweet addition of mango complements thte twang of the mustard and vinegar dressing. Quick and easy to prepare. An instant favorite.

This was a big hit - light and flavourful. We had a Gewürztraminer and it went very well. I left out the dill altogether - didn't substitute. Had lots of left-over sauce so next time I'd halve the sauce recipe.

This recipe was excellent,but I did made some adjustments: added culantro instead of dill, added chopped red onion, and to the sauce I added horseradish sauce to give it a more of a kick. It worked beautifully. I also made it like a cocktail by cubing the shrimp and mangos and presenting it on a martini glass. I combined everything together one day ahead and I thought it tasted much better, the flavors blend better. Loved it!!

I would make this again -- but would likely try to make some adjustments to liven up the sauce. Also -- I made the mistake of pouring all the sauce in as the recipe indicated -- without even thinking. Ended up being way too much dressing. I think you could use about half. I did add avocado....and as served as lettuce wraps.

I made the dressing late at night and didn't have enough mayo. Thank you to all who suggested sour cream. This dressing was delicious. I'm using the leftovers for chicken salad! We tried this salad a few days ago when the temperature was sweltering. It was an excellent hot weather meal.

Will make this all summer! Once you whip up the dressing, the rest is hard to mess up. Made it this weekend in an extreme rush and forgot half the cucumber but also held back half the dressing and it was great. Chopped the shrimp to similar size as cukes and mango and thought it worked well. Served it as a side/alternative to grilled hamburgers and it made the meal special. Will remember the rest of the ingredients next time!

I used less sugar, it was great

Made this last nite. Pretty good -- but you literally need about 1/4 to 1/2 of the dressing. I substituted cilantro for dill, used champagne vinegar, and added a serano pepper to the dressing. Likely would add two next time. At the advice of other reviewers I only used 2 tbsps of the sugar, I think I'd go with all 3 next time around. I also think I would try chopping the shrimp along with the mango / cucumber and serving these as lettuce wraps with extra cilantro available.

Rating: 4
Scrumptious in flavor and texture. Made twice, one with and once without added avocado; even better with the avocado. Could even serve on a half avocado for nice presentation. Used apple cider vinegar. Otherwise used original recipe. Will probably end up as a company luncheon dish in the future.

I haven't tried this yet, but for similar ingredients with a more Asian flavor, I highly recommend the Mango Shrimp Summer Rolls, also found on this website. You can even use the ingredients minus the rice papers to make a great noodle salad.

The shrimp was good but the rest of the salad was a waste of good shrimp. Substitute for the mango and the cukes and liven up the sauce and maybe, just maybe...

To Jtspears Temperance MI - Serve this wonderful salad as the main dish. Add more shrimp, avocado and wedges of vine grown tomato for a more hearty serving. On the side, muffins - not bread or rolls because you need the texture. Keep them (the muffins) simple so they don't interfere with the flavors of the salad. For desert try a white chocolate souffle served in individual dishes. Since supper was light you can afford to treat yourselves. Wine pairing: I'd go with the Chardonnay. But a Pino Noir Blanc would work well too. Bon A!

jt - For a light summer meal, I think this would go well with a sandwich of grilled vegetables, or with grilled fish, chicken, or tofu, and couscous or a rice pilaf. The suggestions of adding a ginger flavor and avocado also sound good to me. Lucille, I would respectfully ask that you lighten up.

Wow. I've subscribed to Bon Appetit magazine for nearly 10 years and consider myself a good chef. I find this website very helpful and refer to it often. The reviews are always full of great suggestions, which is what I was looking for in my earlier post. I've never seen anyone post a comment as harsh as Lucille's. It would have taken her less typing time to just offer a suggestion as to what to serve with the salad. Forgive me if I screwed up the ratings. I made this dish last night and it was fabulous.

This is a delicious recipe as is. I wouldn't substitute cantaloupe for the mango since I don't think they compare favourably. To those people using this review area as a question and answer forum or to those who haven't tried the recipe yet, I respectfully ask that you don't comment since it throws the ratings out of whack. If you can't decide, on your own, what to have with this salad, you might want to think about taking a cooking class.

I am interested in this recipe -- haven't tried it yet. I'd like to serve this for a light summer dinner, but I don't know what to serve with it. Any suggestions? Soup? Sandwich?

I made this as an appetizer for our 24th anniversary dinner and it was delicious, The only substitution I made was to use our Maine-made Stonewall Kitchen's Ginger Vinegar, rather than white vinegar, and I suspect it added a special dimension to the flavor. I will add avacado the next time, as others have suggested.

how about cantaloupes instead of mangoes?

Rating: 2
While this was okay, it was far from excellent or outstanding. It's your basic shrimp salad, and way too sweet for me, I halved the sugar. It needs a little zing. Might be nice with some yellow scotch bonnet and cilantro. Still, it's good food fast and might return to my table in variations as a reliable cool all summer dish.

I would love to make this recipe, but my family HATES mangos. Any suggestions for a substitute would be appreciated. Thank you.

I made this wonderful sweet and tangy salad tonight. The dressing was great! My first inclination was that maybe lemon would be better than the vinegar, but really it was just fantastic just the way the recipe reads! The only change I made was that I added avocado as well, which added a nice buttery dimension to the dish. I will definitely make this again.

I made this last night to take to a potluck, so I had a crowd of reviewers. All loved it. I have spent a good part of today distributing the recipe to fellow party-goers. I used mediterranean cucumbers and they were perfect for this. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly (except to double it). If you do double the recipe, you won't need to double the dressing. I used about 1.5 times what was called for. Altogether a wonderful, easy-to-make and very eye-appealing dish. Deserves at least 3.5 forks!

This was a really excellent recipe! I added some chopped avocados and lime juice to this and it was superb. I may try a little cilantro next time I make it. Enjoy!

Fabulous combinations of color, texture and flavors. New cooks - this is a good one to try. Do not alter until you try the original. Suggestion:use either fresh or frozen shrimp, rinse and layer between paper towels to remove all moisture. Use pickling cukes and fresh dill. I used Trader Joes Orange/Champagne vinegar and all was fabulous. Served as a starter course once and a main course luncheon dish. Excellent! Kudos to Bon Appetit

I have not had a chance to try this, I just now found it. But it seems that an avocado, cubed and added to the other ingredients would go well.

I make a dish much like this, but Vietnamese. Just use fish sauce and lime juice instead of vinegar, peanut oil instead of mayo, and a hot chinese mustard or coleman - use Sirachi hot sauce (come in a squeeze bottle) and you have a delicious eastern interpretation of this recipe. Some herbs wouldn't hurt either.

WOW! Made it last night it was just fabulous. Made a few changes used 1 tablespoon of sugar and 2 tablespoons of vinegar and only 1 tablespoon of light-mayonnaise and 2 tablespoons of sour cream and 2 tablespoons of mustard making for a lighter version of the dressing. Could not be better.

A wonderful blend of sweet and tangy, soft and crunchy, with a very eye appealing colour combo. I used long, seedless, English cucumbers, but this salad would be even better with crisp pickling cukes - can hardly wait until they are in season! I changed the dressing a bit: halved the mustard and mayo, added 3 tbsp. sour cream and it was delicious. The fresh dill was an outstanding complement to the other flavours and the tender butter/Bibb lettuce is a definite must. Please give this a try, you will not be disappointed. Cheers!
