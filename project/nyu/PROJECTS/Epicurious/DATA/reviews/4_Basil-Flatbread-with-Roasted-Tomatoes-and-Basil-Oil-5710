We loved this recipe! We did put it together as written with the roasted tomatoes. However they were quite juicy, so I separated the juices and cooked them down to preserve flavor. It was nice to have them over the flatbread (although I am already imagining many many other combinations that would succeed. This bread definitely has a 4 fork taste, but it is a bit labor intensive so we decided on giving it 3 forks.

Does anyone know if you are supposed to add 2/3c water to the water/yeast/sugar mix or 1/3c? It says to add 2/3c in the ingredients list and 1/3c in the recipe directions...

Nice way to use some of that overflow basil in my garden

couple of things went wrong - I think my yeast was too old and my newborn started screaming, so I just grilled it quickly on a grill pan brushed with EVOO, and when I turned it over I sprinkled sliced cherry tomatoes, EVOO, pepper, dried oregano, and a little asiago cheese. Put a cover on it with the heat off and fed newborn - came back to amazing stuff. Not the recipe I know, but yummy nonetheless.

This was absolutely excellent. I listed to other reviewers and made the roasted tomatoes. Trust me, this makes a huge difference in the dish. This is an absolutely must. use extra garlic and olive oil on the tomatoes. The basil oil needed a little kick or needs to sit for a while to get the flavor. This is awesome on the grill. I also added sauteed mushrooms and fresh parmesean/reggiano cheese. Oh my gosh!

Excellent flat bread, love the basil oil butI re-roasted more tomatoes...the recipe should definitely state the tomatoes need to be sliced. Second time around, I used Roma tomatoes and roasted them along with garlic, mashed the garlic and spread it on top, then the tomatoes...So good and good for you!

Awesome. Made some changes. Didn't make the flatbread, just purchased some bread. Chopped the thyme with the garlic and sprinkled it on the tomatoes. Yes, the tomatoes took longer to cook than it says and I seeded them so they wouldn't be so juicy. Also, added some fresh mozzarella. Definitely a keeper.

Unbelievable! I made it for a few friends for dinner and we all had to have it again every night for the next three days! The tomatoes took a good deal longer to roast than indicated in the recipe, so plan accordingly. A fantastic summer recipe that's incredibly simple and oh so good.

Excellent and fun to make - really impresses your dinner guests! The roasted tomato recipe may be somewhat confusing for the beginning cook because it never tells you to cut the tomatoes into slices before roasting them. I roasted mine until they were somewhat dry, and the flavor was intense & wonderful. Alternatively, and if you're in a hurry or without fresh tomatoes, you could also substitute sundried tomatoes. Right before taking the bread off the grill, I grated fresh parmegiano reggiano over the top for that little extra kick. This recipe will definitely be a repeat throughout the summer!

I had never made flatbread before, and I am NOT a baker--this turned out FABULOUS! I was nervous about putting it on the grill--it was SO EASY, and everything worked perfectly. Rave reviews from everybody--my only suggestion is to double the recipe because there will definitely be NO leftovers!!

We've made this recipe once or twice a summer for years and still love it. The flavors are wonderful and it really is very easy to do.

This was nothing special for the bit of work involved...

Wow, this bread was just incredible. Made it yesterday for a crowd. I didn't make the roasted tomatoes or the basil oil; just used good extra virgin olive oil to brush the breads before grilling. When they came off the grill, I brushed with a little more oil and sprinkled with sea salt. Served with grilled vegetables and toasted pine nuts. It was so good I'm making again today.

I LOVE this bread! It was so easy to make and very tasty. The roasted tomatoes in my opinion were a little over powering. Next time I would use fewer and slice them thinner. Also, adding garlic to the oil would enhance the flavor.

Amazing! I was eating the bread as it was cooking on the grill. I couldn't believe how good it tasted! I used dried basil instead of fresh, which I didn't have on hand. Also, I had trouble transferring the dough from the baking sheet to the grill. The dough was pretty soft...next time I might roll the dough into smaller, individual portions. I can't wait to make this again!

I've made this many times. Absolutely awesome! Guests are impressed with the grilling of the flatbread. Have made it easier and lesser expensive to make by using good canned tomatoes, still adding the spices and warming up. Really good tomatoes are just to hard to find, so this shortcut works well. Oh, and you really need to throw a clove or two of garlic into the basil oil. This is like a dinner in and of itself.

I've already made this dish a couple of times. Actually I just make the flat bread and skip the tomatoes. We really like it - especially "baking" it on the barbecue! :)

This is a delicious way to use up extra basil. I made one flatbread plain just for nibbling and one with the roasted tomatoes. It is DEFINITELY necessary to do the whole recipe with the tomatoes. They make the dish; otherwise the bread seems rather dry without enough flavor.

I teach a cooking class for wannabe dieticians and others. We prepared this just like the recipe(maybe a little extra garlic since we're from Louisiana)and it was a real winner. Picky eaters liked it and adventurous eaters loved it. These are beginning cooks and all three labs turned out an excellent dish. We used an open waffle iron instead of a grill(very inventive). It will be a Lab standard from now on.

This flatbread was extremely simple to make! Instead of basil oil, I used truffle oil which was fabulous. The grill marks make for a beautiful presentation. Very Delicious!
