Good recipe, but make sure the oil is not too hot or it will burn. If it starts to brown too fast, just put it in the oven on 325 until the meat is done. Also, I would add seasoning to the flour (salt and pepper).

It was okay, I think cutting down on the seasoning salt is a must but thats me.

Just enough spice to give it flavor. I substituted buttermilk with good results.

Delicious! I chose this one because I had all the ingredients (no buttermilk, no crisco). It was excellent! The spice mixture is so tasty it makes those other ingredients irrelevant.

Moist and delicious.. I nearly skipped the "drrying out" on the rack, but I think that's what makes it so good.
