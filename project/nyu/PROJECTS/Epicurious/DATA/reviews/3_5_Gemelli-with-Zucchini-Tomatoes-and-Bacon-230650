Easy, delicious, and surprisingly sophisticated. I wouldn't try to make it without great, fresh veggies.

YummM! Such an easy weeknight meal, and a great way to use up leftover veggies. I added chopped bell pepper, mushrooms, and a few sundried tomatoes. I also used a can of fire roasted diced because I don't usually have fresh tomatoes in the winter, and slightly decreased the bacon (to 10 slices) and goat cheese (to 3.5 oz). Did a full box of barilla plus penne (14 oz). Will make again - and like that it's so easy to play with and add to.

Needed weeknight inspiration and found it with this easy and scrumptious recipe! Added a diced yellow bell pepper and garlic to the onion sauté, followed by zucchini. Subbed a tin of diced toms for fresh and omitted bacon to avoid a trip to the grocers...didn't matter, still a delicious dinner!

This was great. I did not use 12 slices of bacon because it would have been too much using the homemade bacon I have so I used 8 ounces of bacon ends diced. Wonderful and fast recipe. The type of zucchini I am growing this year does not have many seeds so I did the boil method and it was great. With a different zucchini I might have sauteed it instead. I also used rose wine because I had some leftover from the night before and it worked fine.

Really great. The only change I made was to scale everything up slightly to use a pound of pasta (I hate recipes that leave me with a quarter of a box left over). I thought the boiled squash were fine, but sauteing them with the onion would probably be even better. The squash are starting to take over the garden, so I'm sure I'll be making this many more times this summer, especially when the tomatoes come in as well.

Love it! Use TJ's herbed goat cheese. Can make with or without bacon, but better with bacon.

Delicious! I sauteed the zucchini along with the onion, as some other reviews suggested. It was such a lovely combination--both adults and kids loved it.

This is the second time I have made this dish so a few modifications were made to add flavor with excellent results. I also don't care for boiled zuchinni, so I sauteed it with the chopped onion, also added 2 cloves garlic. Then added chopped tomatoes and 1/2 cup fresh corn kernels and a bit of red pepper flakes to pan and sauteed briefly. Veggies seemed to pick up flavor from the pepper bacon. Then added vegetable mixture to drained pasta, chicken broth and cheese. The dish turned out quite flavorful and addictive. My husband loved it.

I couldn't keep plates full with this one -- it's like an adult mac 'n cheese. I subbed in dry vermouth for the white wine, replaced half the oregano with basil, and halved the bacon used. Vegetarians can leave out the bacon and saute the onion in olive oil instead.

Easy and tasty. I about halved the recipe and used garden fresh veggies and herbs. Halved cherry tomatoes (which are in abundance) worked well in place of the plum tomatoes. Could have used a little more seasoning, but I am not sure if that is a result of my "winging it" with the measurements while halving the recipe or just how the recipe turns out.

Good straightforward pasta. I don't like boiled squash, so I roasted it first. Based on previous reviews, I did add basil with the oregano and used half goat cheese and half cubed fresh mozzarella. Spiced it up a bit with red pepper flakes and cut the bacon by half. Delicious!

Added garlic to the onions and sliced chicken breast when mixing all ingredients... very nice. Added a parmesan at the end... excellent. Don't skimp on the oregano. I might also add basil next time, seemed to lack a full flavor. Be careful not to overcook! Move quickly and don't stir too long at the end!

My husband and I enjoyed this thoroughly. The oregano at the market wasn't up to par, so I substituted basil. Very nice.

With grilled chicken and fresh mozzarella this makes a light, summery lunch entree...add a good crusty bread and a nice white wine and you've got a great picnic lunch
