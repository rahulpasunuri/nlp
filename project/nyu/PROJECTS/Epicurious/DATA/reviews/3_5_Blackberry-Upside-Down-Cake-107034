Yuck! Top looked beautiful, toothpick came out clean, but when turned over, middle was a soggy, unbaked mess!

I had no problems with the cake being under-baked (though I did convection bake it). But the berries were still quite tart-I think they need at least 2 T more sugar. And I found the cake pretty bland. Maybe I'll try it again with a few tweaks, but as is, I found it just okay.

Made this recipe twice last week. Once for when the family visited and again for myself and my roommate. Both times it came out awesome! I feared getting a soft and uncooked top so I added a little extra flour to the blackberries and made sure to move the oven rack to the lowest part so that most of the heat would hit the blackberries first. I had no problems and will happily make the cake again when blackberries go back on sale!

Although I dislike baking, this is a wonderful recipe that I have made 5+ times. The cake itself is very light and moist, and the blackberry layer heavenlya perfect summer dessert. I usually let the cake rest 24 hours because it seems moister. Make sure to store it in the fridge, but let it come to room temperature before serving. You can serve it with a good vanilla ice cream, but this favorite can stand well on its own. Garnish it with rosemary for a beautiful color contrast.

This cake came out wonderfully and I didn't experience any of the problems that others sited in their reviews. I used an 8" round non-stick pan with a removable bottom. I just put parchment around the edges and some of the berries did stick to the bottom, so next time I will paper the bottom too. I guess we are lucky here because blackberries are plentiful everywhere in August if you are willing to get a few scratches picking them.

this recipe is nasty. i read all the reviews but thought i could save it--wrong! i baked it 35 minutes, toothpick came out dry as a bone; i was sure it was done. it was getting so brown on the top that it couldn't bake longer so i took it out. well, the bottom was still completely liquid--it needed to bake a WHOLE lot longer but how was i to tell? the top part of the cake was getting kinda dry. threw the whole thing in the trash--an outrageous act, given the high cost of the blackberries. as far as i'm concerned, this recipe just doesn't work--and i think it's the temperature. there is a way to make it work, but i don't have enough money to keep buying blackberries to test it out.

Very Good! I am actually VERY broke and like to stretch my buck as much as possible. And did I! I used a small springform pan (4") because the desert is just for me.So I adjusted the amount of ingredients accordingly. I came across this recipe cause I got a bunch of blackberries just for a $1! I used whole wheat flour in order to not feel so guilty. Very good, and very cute because it's so small!

This was delicious! I added a bit of almond extract to the batter as other reviewers suggested and loved the results. I think the cake is a little heavy, and I like the Williams-Sonoma Pineapple Upside Down Cake-cake recipe better, but who can beat blackberries baked with butter, sugar and flour?! Serve it with a dollop of homemade amaretto ice cream, and you are in for a treat!

I try to find good cake recipes that allow for 'Smart Balance' substitution for butter. This cake isn't it. It came out okay, but it was very basic and without enough substance in the cake itself. I loved the - Italian Strawberry Tart - recipe and will try that with blackberries (or peaches, etc...) next time. As a stand-alone recipe, I wouldn't really recommend this one.

This is delicious! Added half teaspoon of almond extract to the batter, tasted great! Make sure berries are DRY. First time making this, mine came out soggy due to moist berries.

I made this tonight and it is really delicious! I added half a tsp of almond extract to the batter and used a mixture of raspberries and blackberries. My only problem was that it was NOT cooked in 35 mins in spite of it being a dark brown (berries too moist? ). I turned the oven down to 350 and cooked for another ten mins before it was done. I would definitely make this again but will make sure that my berries are dry next time!

We needed a new recipe for our fresh blackberries, this was perfect! The cake is light and moist and the blackberries add a nice tartness.

Delicious. This recipe can be used with almost any other berry or stone fruit, or even a combination of fruit. It is my go-to upside-down cake recipe. The buttermilk gives it such a wonderful flavor.

Very nice. Last year I was grooming some friends' garden while they were on holidays and "unloaded" the heavy weight of the blackberry shrubs. The blackberries that survived a couple of days went into this cake. I followed the recipe to the dot and came out wonderfully. Can't wait until summer to offer myself as a garden warden again.

Quick and easy, not as sweet as other upside-down cake recipes. Cake portion has a sugar- cookie like flavor. We enjoyed it!

This recipe is very quick and easy. My son has a book "The Bake Shop Ghost," which we were reading the other night when he requested a cake. He was very excited when he came in from playing outside to find a cake.

I made this wonderful blackberry upside down cake twice now and even sent the recipe on to a friend in Germany. It came out moist and fluffy and was done in under 35 minutes. After the first 20 min. of baking I reduced the heat somewhat as it was becoming too brown. In addition to the sugar I also sprinkled the berries lightly with cinnamon which seems to go so well with blackberries. Delicious with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream on top!

I made this this morning. Before the 35 minutes was up, I checked it and the top was brown and a toothpick came out clean. My mistake. Once I turned it over, I saw it was goopy. Very goopy. I did taste the outer edges which were baked through and it tasted great. But I think it needed to bake for the full time. I was thrown off by the very dark top and the way it seemed to test done. I'm not sure I will make it again, because I think it would be too brown on the top if it went for the additional time, at least in my oven.

Wonderful and easy! Did not have blackberries and used raspberries instead, added lemon zest to the batter and served it with a vanilla cream. It was a wonderful way to showcase beautiful summer berries! This one is going in the recipe box!!

My family loves this! I often make it in lieu of coffee cake for brunch. I use different berries. Sometimes I buy a frozen bag of mixed berries, or for the 4th of July I make it with rasberries and blueberries. FANTASTIC! I have never had a problem.

This dish was *very* easy and tasted just great. Maybe not the very best cake i've ever had, but a wonderful summer dessert. I followed the recommendation to add lemon -- i used lemon extract -- and the cake came out wonderfully. Pretty enough and tasty enough to impress my family and our guests. I used dewberries, which grow wild in texas and are similar to blackberries. If you're expecting inspired greatness, look elsewhere. But if you need a simple dessert where the simple/good flavors really shine, this is a great cake for you.

I'm giving this recipe two forks and one more chance. It has potential but needs work. I agree with reviewers who found the cake part bland, so I'll try adding a little lemon zest, or maybe some almond extract. Also, as some others found, the center of the cake was still runny well past the time it should have been done. After giving it a couple more passes in the oven I finally just put it over the smallest burner on the stove, turned on the flame and finished it that way. I used three kinds of berries -- blackberries, raspberries and blueberries -- in concentric circles. The blackberries and raspberries were great; the blueberries were bland and could've used some lemon juice.

There were some reviewers who said the cake lacked flavor. Try adding a teaspoon of finely grated lemon zest to the batter. It gives it just a hint of complexity!

I love this recipe and make it often this time of year. I live in WA where the blackberries grow wild and this is the perfect simple dessert. It's not too sweet and and not very exotic but really great. Good in the morning or anytime! As far as soggy centers, make sure you bake it at the correct temp until a toothpick comes out clean. For those with problems, maybe the oven was not preheated or your oven temp is off!

I really enjoyed the flavor and texture of this cake, however, my cake was also mushy in the middle even though the toothpick I pushed right into the middle of the cake came out clean.

this dessert is easy and quite good! if i serve it with ice cream, i'll leave the cake simple and pretty much as-is.. if i plan to serve it alone, i will add some swirls of jam or chocolate between layers of batter. i used raspberries and it was gorgeous.

I've made this twice. Once with blackberries and once with strawberries. Both were delicious and I think this recipe would work for any type of berry you choose. It was especially delicious warm, and adding ice cream or whipped cream makes up for the lack of sweetness that some reviewers mentioned.

i will try this again, BUT mine was raw in the center also! i used the pan called for.

I made this for Easter and was I sorry. A twinkie would have had more taste. The cake has no flavor and does not make a nice presentation on the plate. I made bananas foster to redeem myself with my family!

despite some bad reviews this cake is a yummy treat that is so quick to make and you can sub rapberries or blueberries or whatever. everyone i make this for loves it and i have made it 5 times. ive also mailed it to someone and it packs easy! one change though is that i use buttermilk instead of regular. maybe thats the key? but just out of the oven with a scoop of ice cream? mmmm.....!!!

I was not impressed but several coworkers asked for the recipe. Used berries picked in summer and frozen. They worked well, cake part uneventful. Tasted better to me raw than cooked. Had to bake longer than specified. Prefer chocolate.

Has potential. Used frozen berries (probably won't again). Added vanilla bean paste to cake batter. Served with a creme anglaise. Guests raved about. I'll try with other fruits and maybe double the batter amount.

Hate to buck the trend, but we didn't like this much at all. the cake part was pretty boring. I used to have a recipe for nectarine upside-down cake that was WAY better and just as easy - in fact easier! I have been trying to find it as I haven't used it since we moved and I lost lots of stuff. This looked nice but definitely won't make it into my repetoire.

MMMMMMM!!!! This was wonderful! My family DEVOURED it!!! It took me a little longer to prepare than the recipe noted, but I always take my time the first few times I make a new recipe.

Made several times, last time I used a small bundt pan, buttering and dusting it with sugar instead of flour, haven't used parchment paper. Substituted blueberries as they were available. Looked pretty, a hit each time. Good cake flavor and simple to put together. Brought one time to a brunch and was a nice addition to the table.

For all those who hate to bake (that's me!) - this has to be the easiest recipe in the world, and very versatile. I'll definitely make this again, trying other berries. The cake was not very "high" so I will either increase the amount of batter or use a smaller pan.

This was incredibly delicious. I'm generally not a big sweet-eater, but I couldn't get enough of this! The end result was beautiful and it was so easy to make. I used raspberries and blueberries instead of blackberries and it was just fine. The only advice that I might pass along: I used a 9-inch cake pan, therefore next time I would increase the amount of berries to about 16-ounces instead of 12-ounces. 12-ounces did not provide enough berries to form the single layer which makes it look so beautiful when cooked (12-ounces left "gaps"). I served the cake warm with vanilla bean ice cream and it got RAVE reviews, I'll make it again and again.

I borrowed the idea of raspberries and put one ring of raspberries on the outer edge and then alternated with a blackberry ring and continued into the center. I received raves at work for taste and looks!

Really easy and delicious. I used 1-1/2 tablespoons of baker's professional grade sugar(available in most supermarkets). This allowed me to distribute the sugar evenly and at the same time avoid disturbing the berries.

Could not find blackberries so I used red rasberries and it was delicious. This cake is so easy to make and looks so elegant. I can't wait to try it with the blackberries!

Tasted Great. I served it with fresh whipped cream. I used a 9" pan because I did not have an 8" x 2" which required more berries and resulted in less "cake" per bite which I would not do again. The berries and cake have a point counter point balance that I put off balance by using the larger pan. I'm very picky but my guests loved it.

This was really wonderful, and very easy and quick to make. Of course, it certainly helped that we had some very fresh delicious blackberries.
