I absolutely love mashed potatoes and olives so I thought this would be the best of both worlds - not so much. I made the recipe twice, once exactly as written and the second time with tapenade instead of olives and much more butter. It was better the second time but not good enough that I would make it again. I'm not sure what about the flavors turned me off but my husband also disliked this dish.

We love these potatoes - they were easy to make and had a "zing" taste with the olives. Nice compliment to meat, chicken or fish.

I liked these potatoes SO MUCH. More interesting than regular mashed. I bet the leftovers would taste amazing shaped into patties and sauteed until crisp. You could serve chicken caccitore or meat sauce over it as an alternative to pasta. Unfortunately we ate ever last bite so I'll have to make more to find out. Loved it!

Wonderful! If you love olives, this is a winner. Based on a review I read previously, I tried a drizzle of truffle oil in addition to the olive oil and it took it to a new dimension. (It's a nice addition, but not necessary if you don't like the taste of truffles).

this potato recipe is delicious. I make it often and sometimes use a drizzle of truffle oil in place of the olive oil. My family cannot get enough of these potatoes. Thanks....
