This is a great basic recipe for "french" onion soup with ingredients you always have on hand. I used beef broth and a sprig of fresh thyme. And I didn't measure anything. That's the great thing about this recipe - use whatever is in the house. Even a little red wine instead of white will work. Then, the croutons/cheese preferences are all up to you!

This was a great recipe, and provides a good basis to a soup to experiment with. I added fresh Thyme and Marjoram and also a tsp of Paprika to give it a little kick - and it was superb. Also, the croutons are essential to this recipe! We will be making this often.

Very disappointing. The croutons(which I didn't make) must be the draw in this recipe. It was like eating buttery onions. I don't like to waste food, so I plan to puree what is left. I will make it into an onion sauce and serve it tomorrow with baked chicken.

An excellent version of the soup! The chicken broth makes it lighter however the butter gives it a rich flavor. It definitely leaves room for some experimentation with different cheeses and wines.

This was very good onion soup. It was interesting to see it in a yellow broth rather than the traditional dark beef broth. I used only 4 T of butter and found that rich enough for me. I also decided against using additional spices to see how the actual recipe performed and was impressed by its simplicity.
