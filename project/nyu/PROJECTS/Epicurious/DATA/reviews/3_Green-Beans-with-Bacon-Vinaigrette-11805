Bland and boring. Bacon didn't add enough flavor. I think that people who rated it higher did so based on their modified recipes. Ah, well.

The good thing about this recipe is that it's quick, although we found the 3-minute cooking time too short. But it's also very bland. I made it the second time tonight and added more bacon, some canned French fried onions on top, and sprinkled on some Parmesan cheese just before serving. With all this, we still found it pretty ordinary.

I had high expectations for this but was disappointed in the end result. I think I will try it again, but I'll steam the beans until tender and then mix in the vinegar and bacon, I think it also needed some more flavor - salt, pepper, maybe some garlic and onion should turn not bad into amazing.

I made these as part of a buffet for a gathering of friends...they must have been good because they were gone by the time I got to them. I used balsamic vinegar because I like it better, and used a little more than the recipe called for; on the advice of another reviewer, I also added a splash red wine to the pan for the vinaigrette.

This dish wasn't bad, but surprisingly was a little on the bland side. The bacon didn't contribute as much to the taste as I thought it would, and I'd probably add a little more vinegar next time.

Quick and easy recipe for dinner parties. I use a nice Cabernet Sauvingon instead of red wine vinegar.

One of my favorites when I cook pork or turkey. I got the suggestion from a friend to add 6 ozs. sliced mushrooms right after cooking the bacon (you may want to increase the bacon amount)... Simple and delicious, and I can never get enough of this great side dish.

I've made this twice. It's very easy but tastes like you went to some trouble, as opposed to just steaming them. I didn't bother rinsing them, used less bacon, and balsamic vinegar, which made them sort of sweet and really yummy. I like thin, young green beans but I think these were better the first time I made them with fatter ones. Go figure.

This recipe serves 4 not 2 as a side dish. If you cook the green beans the time suggested, your beans will be very crunchy. The next time I will cook the beans slightly longer for my taste. After I cooked and removed the bacon, I add a spash of water to the hot skillet to deglaze. Then before serving, I added the bacon fat, etc. and tossed as directed before serving. Very good.
