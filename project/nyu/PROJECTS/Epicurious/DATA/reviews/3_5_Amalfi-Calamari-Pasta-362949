Any recipe that is devoured in minutes and is begged to be made again deserves 4 stars. This is one of those recipes. Our family has been searching for the perfect fried calamari. And here it is! We can make it at home! (Or I can.) I kept fairly to the recipe for the first time, always do, and only fair for a proper rating.... And it was great!!! The lemon with the pasta was the best part! What a great combo with the fried calamari. Did serve a spicy harissa remoulade on side which topped it all off beautifully as well as fresh steamed haricot verts. But the recipe was core. My 8-year-old son said he wanted this for his birthday dinner. What more can one ask?

It was delicious, but next time I will add more cayenne and perhaps a few hot pepper flakes to the pasta, but as the author wrote in his accompanying article....it was light and airy. I used a deep fryer and it was perfect.

I love calamari but usually don't want to go to the trouble of deep frying at home. Glad I decided to go for it one this one. The only change I would make is to increase the amount of cayenne in the coating and add some smoked spanish paprika. 4 cups of oil isn't required - I used my largest Dutch oven and probably only used max of 2 cups and was able to fry in 3 batches.

Wonderful recipe; great combination of delicate flavors! I didn't find it messy or difficult at all; it was easy and quick. The coating on the squid rings was just right - crispy and not too heavy. I'll definitely make this again, but will try extra virgin olive oil instead of butter on the pasta. I love the flavor of good olive oil on pasta, which won't be overwhelmed by the other flavors in this recipe.

Very good, providing you have good and fresh ingridients. But it's not simple at all, it requires some technique to propperly fry the calamari and ir is kind of messy. Still, it's a recipe I'd be willing to repeat any day I find nice calamari.

What a mess! I did not find this easy, but messy. There was too much coating on the calamari and this was not at all quick and easy for me, an experienced cook. Pass!

I liked the idea of the crunch of the calamari with the pasta and the simplicity of it. I resisted the temptation to top with cheese and otherwise play with it so that the natural flavors came through. Unfortunately, the only flavor was lemon. IMO, this needed to be "kicked up a notch."
