This was a good pickled onion recipe...you have to know and like pickled onions...they are for eating crisp as an accompaniment to cold meat, cheese and crisp breads. Maybe this was part of an English Ploughman's lunch menu, I just got it from recent recipes column. BUT...you can keep unopened pickled onions for ever (OK, maybe one year) in cool place, in fact they get better as time goes by. Mmmm, makes my mouth water. I make 'em for gifts at Xmas ( make in late summer so they are ready to be sampled at Xmas) to be different from cookies. Try them!
