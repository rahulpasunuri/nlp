Loved the sausage instead of ground beef. It was even better the next day. Followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious. Will definitely add this to the cold weather rotation.

The ingredients were so easy and I used chicken sausage Italian style. Delicious!

I have been making this for years. We love it. I remove the casings then cook the sausage. I don't remove the sausage, just add the remaining ingredients as directed. It is quick, easy and comforting. I add more chili, cumin and jalapeno because we like things more heavily spiced.

I modified this recipe a little. For the sausage, I emptied the sausage out of the sausage lining, browned it and then used it. I don't like it when the lining shrinks and reshapes the slices. I also added a tablespoon of pureed canned chipotle chiles and a bottle of Trader Joe's mole sauce. Also added a can of garbanzo beans since I was cleaning out the pantry. This was a huge hit with spouse and teenagers. Turned out very tasty and as a basic recipe was not too hard to improve on. For the chipotle chilies, a little goes a long way so when I open a can I puree the whole thing then freeze it in a baggie - when I need a tablespoon, I just cut off the amount I want. Good for adding to taco or fajitas. Same thing with tomato paste if you don't need the entire can.

Used sweet Italian turkey sausage. Was a touch too sweet for my taste. Next time I'll try breakfast sausage.

Easy, fast, and healthy. Good teenager food. Be sure to get a really good spicy italian sausage.

No, I can not believe anyone would like this recipe if made according to the directions! And I can't believe this could possibly be a chili cook off winner. Were there any other entries?? I've made 100's of recipes off this web site and most were exceptional, I double checked the ingredients and can't figure out where I have gone wrong. And I admit, I am a minority according to the reviews. Although, my husband agreed that this is not a good recipe...........

Very good, but I used hot sausage, and it still isn't very hot. That's OK with me, though. Very tomatoey, very good. Next time I think I will crumble and brown the sausage instead of browning and slicing.

I won a cookoff with this recipe too!!! Everyone loved the differnt beans and the sausage.

I just won a chili cookoff with this recipe! I used hot italian sausage, and instead of cooking in a big saucepan, I sauteed the sausage, onions, and peppers, then threw everything into a crock pot and cooked on low for 5 hours. At the end I added the red wine vinegar and some cayenne pepper for an extra kick! Tasty!

Didn't have green or jalapeno peppers, and it was still really delicious, and easy. Using the sausage makes for a nice change from the usual ground beef chili.

I've made this recipe several times, but I do a couple things differently. I've used ground turkey and it's just as good - or, if I double it then I use half ground turkey and the other half is good quality (like from Whole Foods) Cajun turkey sausage. Have also used a chicken Andouille sausage too for more kick. Instead of potentially wasting half a can of 28 oz. tomotoes, I get just one and then one 14 oz. can of diced Mexican style tomotoes. Since I hate kidney beans - I leave them out and it is still just awesome! A great recipe to double and put in the crock pot for a Super Bowl party!

I have entered this recipe in two chili cookoffs and have won both times (and there were people from Texas there)

This is real comfort food. My wife likes sliced kielbasa with this. We've found it freezes well too.

My family loved it! I brought this to a family get together. The chunks of sausage was a new twist on chili. Hot sauce is must !

Spicey and thick! Excellent!

I made this for a birthday party and it was a big hit with everyone - even my six year olds loved it. I prefer a little bit more spice, but everyone else thought it was fantastic. I've made it a couple of times and it is definitely better with turkey sausage.

Yummm! This recipe is a keeper, a nice variation on the kidney bean only variety.

Excellent, and very easy to make. Tasted even better a day later (less tomatoey).

We have been making this recipe ever since it came out in the 1993 issue of Bon Appetit. We, and our friends, love it! We are members of a small local bicycle club and my husband and I sponsor an annual ride and chili feed. Chili and cinnamon rolls - the things dreams and childhood are made of!

A big hit at our latest football tailgate party. The three different colors of beans looked great and tasted great. Used half sweet sausage and half hot sausage...next time would probably use all hot.

This chili was great! My fiance and I really enjoyed it. I added four gloves of garlic, almost three full jalapenos, and about a third more chili powder after reading the previous reviews. I also used "hot" sausage. It had a nice, spicy kick, but not overpowering. It was still flavorful, and very filling. This recipe will definitely fill more than four people up, even as the main course!

Here's my take on this chili...I liked it but thought it was a little too thick, so my addition: 1/2 cup of porter beer! It really gave it good flavor and the soupiness it needed. I omitted the vinegar because of the beer. Next time I might try using a lager. I also used a southwestern oil, infused with peppers and chilies and spices, instead of the olive oil, which bumped up the heat a little. But I did need more than a tablespoon of oil for the recipe. I think this makes much more than 4 servings, also.

One of our favorite chili recipes - we spice it up with HOT sausage and love to try a variety of beans. We serve it in a soup bowl lined with a warmed tortilla and grated cheese (great find at the bottom of the bowl.

The secret to this recipe is tasty italian sausage! Go for the hot and spicy or mild - depending on your taste buds. My husband and I have always enjoyed this chili as it is chunkier and therefore heartier than the bowl of mush that traditional chili turns into. But the secret is the sausage.

I thought this dish was very bland even with added cayenne pepper and extra chili powder. The leftovers, and there was a lot, went into the trash can.

This recipe was a nice change from chili made with ground beef. I spiced it up more than the recipe called for. The combination of beans was great.

My husband and teenage son declared this chili "topnotch." I thought it was tasty, but not the best chili I've ever eaten.

I liked the recipe, though my boyfriend thought it was bland even after doubling the chili powder. I also added some garlic and additional smoked dried jalepenos.

I've made this since its first appearance. It always gets raves. When I want to make the best chili for someone, this is the one I make.

This recipe was absolutely delicious and very easy. I added 4 cloves of chopped garlic and sauteed with the vegetables. I served it over basmati rice. The basmati rice recipe is also found on epicurious. My boyfriend loved it!!!!!

This has become an easy family favorite. None of us like kidney beans, so I use small red or pink beans instead. Portuguese sausage, andouille and/or kielbasa are tasty substitutes. This is popular with my husband's JV boys basketball team.
