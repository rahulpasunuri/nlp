I have made this often; but I do add pressed garlic (minced would be good too) and some freshly grated lemon or lime zest. It makes any sandwich exceptional ~ grilled chicken or leftover thinly-sliced steak on French rolls are awesome!

Adjusted the heat of the mayo to my liking and used this in a sliced BBQ top sirloin steak sandwich on a french loaf. Very nice and easy summer dinner.
