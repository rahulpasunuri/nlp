This was a solid lamb stew recipe. I added a few sprigs of rosemary with the liquid and it was very tasty. I omitted the green peppers, added some potatoes with the carrots and used fresh peas instead of frozen but otherwise followed the recipe as written. Lamb shoulder was a good cut for this.

The family I made this for said it was blah. I followed the recipe completely.

I've made this dish several times for a variety of friends and it always gets high marks from them. It's meaty but light. I think the lemon peel is what does the trick.

This was a good stew for a cold snowy weekend. At the suggestion of other reviewers, I added a generous amount of merlot which added some depth to the stew. My butcher only had 2.5 lbs of leg of lamb which I used for the stew - which also meant I should increase the vegetables and liquid. I added mushrooms and the peas in the last 20 minutes to increase the vegetables. This is hearty one-dish meal.

Excellent flavor and flexible recipe. I made a lot of changes for convenience and to use what I had on hand. I made the following changes: 1) used leftover medium rare leg of lamb cut in chunks and added after stew was cooked since I wanted to keep it medium rare; 2) substituted sliced mushrooms for bell pepper; 3) added potatoes cut in 1" chunks, 4) Sauteed all vegetables, garlic, lemon peel, bay leaves about 5 minutes, 4) substituted lamb broth with chicken boullion and about 1/4 cup red wine for chicken broth, 5) substituted ketchup for tomato paste; 6) simmered vegetables about 10-15 minutes rather than 20 minutes; 7) thickened with red wine and flour mixture.

My mother always made chili for us on Halloween as a good way to warm up after trick or treating on a chilly Midwestern night. I decided to make this stew as a slight variation of the tradition. I went through the reviews and added the red wine and upped the spices for flavor like others. I added a diced russet potato, garbanzo beans and subbed in frozen mixed veggies for the peas and cut up carrots. The lemon peel really makes the dish. I saved the lemon and squeezed it onto the soup right before eating. I bought some pumpernickel bread to eat along with the stew. This is a wonderful stew for a crisp fall or winter night!

Super easy and delicious!

I went with an extra handful of chopped herbs to dress this up, choosing not to go the red wine route as others have here. The lemon peel made this really terrific. I served this with cannellini beans, eventually everything got all mixed together in a wonderful Fall supper.

This stew has good methods and ingredients but is woefully underseasoned. We cooked it with red wine as recommended, added two cups of chopped okra and seasoned it with sage and a hefty dash of paprika.

We liked this stew very much. Went back and read the other reviews and sorry I did not add red wine as so many others thought it was a good addition. Next time. Can't figure why so many nixed the peas. I thought they were fine and made a colorful contrast to the carrots. I was not clear from the recipe if the lemon peels should have been removed before serving. I did remove them but could certainly still taste the lemon in the stew. Next time maybe I'd remove about half of the lemon and cut the rest up very small. I added ground mint and thyme to the stew. Flavor was enhanced.

I had some leftover lamb and leftover pork that I needed to do something with. I did as someone else wrote, and used the mushrooms instead of the peas. It was easy to make and I would use it again for leftovers.

Good but wouldn't make it again, nor could I say it was delicious.

This recipe is delicious. I did use others' suggestions of using red wine but instead of half wine and half broth I used 1/4 wine. That amount of wine added just the right amount of "tang". I also used the lemon peel. The recipe wouldn't have been as good without it. I had lamb leg steaks with some bone in it so I trimmed the meat very well and boiled the scraps including the bone for broth. I used this broth in place of the chicken broth. I also added a little more water. At the last minute I forgot the mushrooms but it was delicious anyway. I served it over noodles. I think it's very important to brown the meat a little to develop the flavor.

We really enjoyed this, served with homemade crusty white bread. We skipped the green pepper, lemon strips, and peas. Replaced 1/4 cup of the chicken stock with port, and added mushrooms instead of the peas, as other reviewers had recommended.

Great dish, made it for Christmas eve dinner. I would love to try to replace the tomato paste with something else, don't know what though... it was yummy all the same.

I added less meat (I used beef) and more peas and carrots -- plus I added white beans. It was delicious and easy.

This was a great simple recipe. I added mushrooms along with the peas. Next time I would brown my lamb in red wine and add a little more lemon for a bit of a bite. Truly a great dish for a rainy nite. (Dont forget the biscuits)

I made this for myself and some friends, replaced peas with mushrooms and added at the same point in the recipie, turned out great. we all loved it and for a cheaper version i'm going to try with precut beef stew chunks.

I wasn't very satisfied with this recipe - I would take out the lemon strips, since it did not complement the lamb and I ended up taking them out after a few bites (and I love lemon!), but not in this dish.

Wonderful gravy. I too added red wine and more garlic. Used only two carrots and added one turnip, peeled and cut into fairly large slices. After tasting it, I froze it for future use and forgot to remove the lemon peel so I hope I don't ruin it in the thawing out process. It's good.

This was a good weekday meal, but not outageous (i.e,, not for company). I also added red wine, more garlic, and some red pepper flakes to add some zip. I also used less carrots (2 1/2) and that was plenty.

I made this ina pinch when I had some leftover lamb and it was great. I added a generous amount of red wine which was a great addition. I loved the lemon peel in it (I wouldn't have thought of it). Was great for making a day in advance and eating the next day.

I thought this was a very interesging, flavorful, and tasty dish. The lamb was wonderfully flavored and tender. I added a couple of generous dashes of white wine vinegar with the stock on a hunch and I think it really gave the dish a kick. I served it over cous-cous which was a great accompanyment.
