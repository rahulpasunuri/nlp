This is a nice recipe but WAY too sweet. I suggest cutting the sugar in at least half. I also used Thai chili peppers instead of serrano.

This is the second day that the recipe file did not match the daily featured dish. Today the dish was Fig and Goat Cheese Crostini and the Thai crabmeat salad came up. Can you correct this annoying glitch?

I was really looking forward to this dish and served it at our dinner club. No one thought it was out of this world, although some tolerated it better than others. I thought the dressing was way too much! Very sweet and strong flavours. The presentation and colors are lovely and if I made it again, I'd try a different dresssing....definitely less sugar to start!

I didn't have papaya, but I couldn't wait to try it, so I served it over shredded romaine tossed in the same dressing. Yum! If you are a Thai food lover, this flavor resembles som tom - so I tried it the next time over shredded cabbage. Wow! Our favorite so far: I added in fresh from the garden tomatoes and seedles cucumbers. Double wow! Basically, you can't go wrong, this is fabulous! A few notes: You don't need salt with fish sauce, but the dressing benefits greatly from some minced garlic and a squeeze of lime. (Some day I may actually try it with papaya!)

EXCELLENT RECIPE, we re-invented it for a Party with cocktail shrimp instead of crab, and with orange, yellow red and green peppers.. it gets very colorful with the papayas on a large and colorful serving plate accompained with toasters for serving... delicious!

Absolutely I will make it again, although I wasn't crazy about the papaya. I'd do it without it, or even with chopped mango added

I made this recipe and it tasted pretty good. Very easy to make as well. I would suggest adding the dressing to the salad (rather than the salad to the dressing as the recipe suggests), or using a slotted spoon to serve the salad. Otherwise the vinegar flavor gets pretty strong by the end of the meal.
