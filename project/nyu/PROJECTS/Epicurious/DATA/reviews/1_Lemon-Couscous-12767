This dish was pretty bland. I doubled the recipe and added more lemon zest and it was still bland. I had to add lemon juice just to taste the lemon flavor and I added a little olive oil and red wine vinegar and extra salt just to make it taste better and I still was not satisfied with it. I also substituted scallions for the chives. I will not make this again.
