I have been making this recipe for years - we love it! Great as part of an appetizer assortment for a Middle Eastern dinner. I had perfect success with these a couple days ago (in the past I have had bursting problems - I rolled them wrong, tried to seal the ends). I used President brand feta - I think it is drier than French feta. I popped my cheese rolls in the fridge and then refrigerated the fully assembled rolls. Make sure the cheese mixture is exactly 2 1/2" (the cut phyllo will be about 4" wide). Don't seal the ends - the cheese will not leak out. If you skimp on the butter the rolls will not have that lovely flaky crunch. I made a triple batch and froze some. The extra cheese mixture was fabulous with leftover roasted eggplant, zucchini and chicken sausage!

My comments are similar to others'. This was much simpler to make and faster than the recipe seemed to indicate. However, the cheese melted out (maybe refrigerate for a bit before baking?), so these ended up being mostly phyllo.

Not the greatest.. I even made extra filling, but then the cheese melted out when I cooked it. It was pretty bland, maybe if you dipped it in something...

I would make this dish again with more filling, and probably making triangles instead of cigars. somehow the filling bursted out of the cigars, so it was not "perfectly presentable" for a dinner party. Working with Phyllo is always a bit challenging, so it was definitely a bit too work intensive for the kind of result I got. Used red pepper flakes, and added chopped parsley to filling.

This was more work than it was worth. The result was just a salty snack--not very visually interesting or particularly tasty.

I'm not sure if I did something wrong but I didn't have nearly as much filling as needed for the recipe. I was able to eek out 24 rolls. Didn't seem to be enough filling for the dough. Mine were all pastry and very little cheese. Maybe I'll try again with more filling and a dipping sauce.

Very good twist on tyropitakia (cheese pies); the standard feta and phyllo triangles. Would definitely make again.

Used only a portion of the butter called for, and couldn't find Aleppo chili flakes, so used regular crushed red pepper. Would be good party food.

Made these for the first time for a party and got rave reviews. Substituted walnut oil for butter and they were delicious. They are on our New Years Eve menu already!

Great for a baby/ bridal shower. Easy to make ahead.....very delicious. I'd reduce the butter next time to make a little healthier!

These are pretty easy and very tasty. Feta's never tasted so good!
