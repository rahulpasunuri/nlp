Great idea but has a few problems: use fresh pizza dough (ofcourse), roast the onion, increase quantity of mushrooms and decrease quantity of rosemary. Also like a mixture of fontina and mozzarella.

let's be honest. real good pizza does not start with ready-made-crust. American's don't know how to make "real" pizza and never will. to make pizza you need to know how to make pizza dough. go to europe/italy and learn the art of pizza

Definitely a keeper. I've made this several times and tried it with proscuitto and pancetta, both work nicely. Though in mushroom season, I'm a purist--just the 'shroooms, and lots of them.

I had friends over for lunch and served this. The topping can be precooked, and the pizza assembled and put in the oven just before guests are expected to arrive.

I liked the wording of this recipe the best

Yummy! A very different mix of toppings for a pizza, and they all go together quite well. A nice switch if you are looking for a change from the good ol' sauce and mozzerella routine. I really like the fotina cheese on this, and the next time I make it, I think some Canadian bacon would fit in nicely with these flavors. I used the pizza dough recipe from the June '98 issue for this.

Overall was good. My husband believes this would have been better with garlic. I used a "Boboli" prepared crust, and it was very tasty. I also used rosemary from our garden (very nice touch). Easy, quick, simple, yum.

AFTER GOING THROUGH RECIPES, I STUMBLED ACROSS THIS THAT I MADE A LONG TIME AGO--THIS WAS VERY DELICIOUS, IM SURPRISED NO ONE TRIED IT YET, THE FONTINA CHEESE IS WONDERFUL WITH THE MUSHROOMS AND THE ROSEMARY WAS A GREAT TOUCH.
