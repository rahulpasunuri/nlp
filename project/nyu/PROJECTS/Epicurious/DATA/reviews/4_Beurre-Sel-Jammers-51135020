These were a hit! The whole party went bananas for them. I used a jam that wasn't very thick. It turned the fruit center a little runny but the taste was still superb.

Fabulous - turned out perfect. Thought I was back in Paris.

Fantastic cookie! Fun to make with excellent results. Using apricot jam was the favorite among our friends and family.

These were a big hit with everyone in our family. They came out best baked in a nonstick muffin tin. Be sure to let them cool 15 minutes before taking them out of the pan.

Very buttery and tasty. I didn't want to use my time waiting for muffin tins to cool before reusing them so I used a mini whoopie pie tray, and was able to knock out 2 dozen cookies at a time. I precut 1.5 inch "coins" to fit the mini cups, and it went pretty quickly. I cooked them for the same length of time as in the original recipe, and they turned out perfect. I used apricot and strawberry jams. Yielded 5dozen in this size, and had to make a touch more streusel topping.

They are a little labor intensive but the end result is worth the effort. Be careful not to roll them out to thin, or else you won't get the full flavor of the cookie. When Dorie says the yield is 34...she means 34!

I am terrible at rolling out dough. I chilled the dough right in the mixing bowl in the fridge, not the freezer. I used a small cookie scoop, and scooped a 3/4 full scoop into mini muffin paper liners. I put them in a mini muffin pan and pressed the dough into the bottom. Filled with jam and topping according to directions. Baked them for 15 min and kept watch until golden. Probably cooked for close to 20 min. They came out perfect, and I left them in the liners. These are very good and I will make them again. Would have rated this 3 1/2 forks if I could.

Really liked these! My batch made 48, but I had to double the streusel part. Go generous with the jam. I made some with blackberry, some raspberry and some apricot for a better presentation.

These turned out beautifully for me. The dough was very soft, and definitely needed to be chilled, but I had no trouble shaping it after about 30 minutes in the freezer. The cookies held together nicely after they baked, and the buttery taste was a great contrast with the jam: I did about half with apricot, and half with homemade blood orange marmalade.

I used a mini-cheesecake pan in lieu of the muffin tins, for easy removal. Fun to make, look pretty. Another cookie to add to the repertoire.

I like the idea of this recipe. The flavors are great together and the dough wasn't hard to mix. However it is the softest cookie dough I've ever worked with and freezing is essential. I wonder if freezing the dough in a log and slicing mint be easier than 2 inch round cutters. This is not a good recipe to try with kids. Too frustrating for little hands.
