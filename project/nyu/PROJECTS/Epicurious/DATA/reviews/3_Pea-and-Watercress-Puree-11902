Easy, tastes just as good the next couple days, and is addictive. Very fresh, friendly pea flavor.

Have made this time and time again, always to rave reviews. Just served it again yesterday as part of our Easter dinner. Yum!

This is a wonderful do-ahead and reheat in the microwave recipe. Have served it to people who were not sure they liked either peas or watercress , and was asked for the recipe. Depending on the pepperiness of your watercress, you may like a little more. A few Tablespoons of shredded cheese is a nice addition - Parmesan, Swiss, etc.
