We absolutely loved this recipe. It was so easy and is definitely the best home-made marinara recipe I have ever made. We doubled the garlic, but everything else stayed the same.

Delicious! My friend thought I had added cheese to this sauce to make it so creamy.

This is a great, versatile sauce. I served it over Polenta and it was delicious. Great, quick polenta recipe here: http://video.about.com/italianfood/Polenta- Recipe.htm I didn't have a blender on hand and it worked anyway. I used red wine instead of white and doubled the red pepper.

I added 2/3 c Burgundy, upped garlic to 6 cloves and did add a good bit more red pepper flakes with salt and pepper to taste. I've been trying to find a truly wonderful sauce for my pasta... six year search. My husband loved this and wants to know that I can repeat it. Simmered for about 30 minutes, it was delicious.

I cooked the sauce down to thicken it up and I was glad I did.
