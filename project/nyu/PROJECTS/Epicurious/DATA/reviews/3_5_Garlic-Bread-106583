After reading reviews, I made some modifications, and it came out great. I roasted a bulb of garlic in olive oil, pepper and salt wrapped tightly in foil for one hour at 350. I used that garlic, and added to the butter mixture. I added paprika, shredded parmesan, and some red chili flakes. Delicious!!

my first time making garlic bread, my mother-in-law liked it so I guess I will be making this again. But next time I'll double the amount of garlic since with the amount called for in this recipe I could barely taste the garlic.

I've been using this as my standard garlic bread recipe for a while now. I find it's easier to spread the butter and garlic mixture if you cut the entire baguette in half, instead of doing the little slices. Easier to make and it improves the texture.

My husband said it was the best garlic bread I have ever made! I followed the recipe exactly except for an extended baking time.

Rating: 4
Great. Measure the salt and the garlic. The proportion of bread to spread is important. I made it on an 8 inch loaf and it was too much garlic but would have been perfect on the 15" loaf.

This recipe was good, but not great. I felt like I could have doubled the garlic spread to better cover the bread slices. It just needed more flavor and substance.

This garlic bread has absolutely no garlic flavor. Instead of 2 tsp, may be I should have put in 2 tbsp of garlic. Very disappointing. The cook from Springfield MA is correct -- it's too bland.

I was looking forward to trying this recipe, but I found that it has absolutely no garlic flavor. The bread tasted like it had been spread with an oil, but there was no other flavor. I don't consider this garlic bread. Bland, bland, bland.

I use this recipe base all the time. I particularly like to use chopped fresh rosemary, shredded parmesan and mozzarella cheeses and a few shakes of garlic salt.

I made this using a crusty local bread, Judies, for a nice accompaniment to the Super Easy Spinach and Pesto Lasagna. It wasnt shy with the salt and perfectly buttery, but if I had to do it again Id use basil in addition to the parsley.

I was disappointed in this bread as it was too soft and did not have enough garlic spread. I think I would cut the bread in half lengthwise and open it for the last 5 minutes in the oven. I would also prefer some cheese in the spread.

This recipe is outstanding!! I wouldn't change anything except maybe adding a little parmesan to the garlic butter mixture.

Great recipe- I cook it as is but add salt. Since I'm just feeding 2 people, I prepare the loaf then freeze half, and it's a great way to have convenient garlic bread without paying for pricey chemical-filled garlic bread. I will make this for a long time! Next step- making my own bread (someday).

Rating: 3
Very good - I added some salt, but left everything else the same. I baked 4 small loaves of Italian bread and used only some of the garlic butter to spread over four halves. I sprinkled some authentic, grated parmesan cheese on two of the halves and popped everything back in the still-warm oven. Yummy!

Roast a whole garlic bud and only put in 1/2 tsp raw chopped garlic, and 1/2 TB olive oil.

Simply delicious! I didn't have a baguette but I had some fresh cheese rolls from the bakery. My husband raved about this and the spaghetti and meatballs I made to go with it. This recipe is extremely easy and delicious to the last bite!! Will definitely make again!

I used a multigrain baguette and added parmesan to the garlic mixture. My boyfriend and I loved it.

This was a great combination with no herbs at all -- just provided a nice garlicky buttery hot bread for pulling apart.

I wasn't blown away by this at all. Too bland. Next time will add a lot more garlic and more salt and probably try some of the suggestions of other users to see if I can jazz it up a bit.

I have been making garlic bread exactly like this for the better part of 45 years (since I was 15). For variety, I spinkle with freshly grated and slightly dried Parmegianno-Reggiano cheese. The real challenge to this recipe is to make your own baguettes!

Pretty good. I used another reviewers recommendation and used rosemary instead of parsley. It was very good and well received by my picky guests.

I made this bread to compliment "Chicken Salad With Grapes and Walnuts" (on this site). The bread was good (and the salad was EXCELLENT), but I don't think that this bread recipe should claim to have perfect proportions of everything. I used 1/2 of a loaf of Italian bread to make 8 slices, so I divided everything in 1/2. The amount of garlic butter was a bit scant to put on each side of each slice. Next time I would only butter one side of each slice, so that the butter was thick on one side, while the other side of the same slice of bread was relatively non-greasy. Then I think that the garlic butter flavor would be stronger and better.

Absolutely without a doubt the best garlic bread I've ever had!! Thanks.

Fabulous... have even made it with chopped cilantro insted of the parsley... DELCIOUS!!!!! More of a Tex-Mex flare....

Even though I added things to the base of this recipe I still scale it a 4 because the ratio of butter to oil is bang on. We are a garlic loving house to I added 3tbls. of it with olive oil, as well I shredded just a bit of asiago cheese. The remaing couple of tsp. I had left over I spread on top of the bread shredded some more cheese and wrapped up in the foil. Can't wait to make it again!

I made this but added a whole teaspoon of salt and definitely way more garlic, also left out the parsely. I think the modifications made it much better than it would have been if I would have followed the instructions completely. As is, it would be a 2. With modifications it's a 3-4

My friends loved it. I would have made my slices slightly thinner (I went over an inch) and made a little more of the garlic butter but my loaf was also about an inch thicker than was recommended.

I've made this several times for the family and there never is any leftovers. I've tried a pinch of red pepper flakes as well....either way we love it!

Bland, very "restaurant" garlic bread. My theory is 2 cloves of garlic and 1 TBS of butter per one inch slice (and I used big Italian loaves, 15 x 5 x 4). A dash of red pepper flakes makes a nice touch. This was nothing special.

My dinner guests LOVED this recipe! I made two loaves, both with a couple TB parmesan mixed into the butter, and one using a loaf of Garlic Pugliese (with roasted garlic cloves - super garlicky!) Enjoy!

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe for garlic bread. However, I found that I had to bake the bread longer than 5 minutes with the foil open in order to get the bread crisp. I guess it was because the type of Italian bread I used was on the soft side.

Rating: 4
I added 2 tablespoons of grated parmigian to this. Delicious! Next time I won't bother with the rest of the meal.

Rating: 3
So delicious, I've made it 2 nights in a row. I agree this recipe has perfect proportions: not too garlicky, not too greasy. I didnot use butter at all but instead used 4 Tbs extra virgin olive oil for the entire recipe and added 2 T grated parmesan. But even the portion without cheese which I've made for my 2-yr old son was equally good. I've used it on multi-seed bread and it was heavenly.

This is a very good recipe...have made many times since it was printed. I use this recipe all the time. The proportions are perfect.

This is great with virtually any pasta dish. Try using chopped fresh rosemary instead of parsley.

It seems silly to need a recipe for garlic bread, but the proportions here are right on. Adding a sprinkling of parm cheese, a sprinkling of dried oregano, and a sprinkling of a little salt and pepper makes it perfect for my family. We love to have it with our meal on "steak and salad night".

Adding a few tablespoons of grated parmesan cheese is an option that really jazzes this up!

How can you not like garlic, butter, olive oil and parsley? hehe. I tried it on some toothsome bread (maybe too toothsome for my guest), but I know that it would be great on any loaf... :D

Very good and so easy. I did add a little salt.

My husband was worried that using raw garlic would be too strong, we've usually sauteed the garlic with butter before spreading on the bread. The garlic was just right, and everyone at the pot luck loved it. We used a sourdough baguette from St. Louis Bread Co, known as Panera in other parts of the country.

Wonderdul garlic bread recipe. I made this last week with some home made lasagna and it was superb. I am giving a dinner party next month for a relative of mine and she has insisted that I make something to go with the garlic bread. Definately will make it again.

A basic solid garlic bread. I wasnt meticulous about the measurements but still found it delicious. My guests all had compliments.

I think this is a very good recipe and would make it again. It is simple. However, a true Italian garlic bread would not use butter but olive oil instead. I had 2 loaves. Tested one with butter, one with olive oil. Both were delicious. However, my father-in-law (from Italy) wouldn't touch the one with butter!

Delicious! Just made yesterday for dinner - also made the skirt steak & old-fashioned potato salad, from the June issues - very good!! I will be making this garlic bread again & again. Tastes so fresh & homemade !!

This is one of the top delicious easy to make recipes for Garlic Bread. For an added touch after baking bread you can completely cut it into slices and then spread them out evenly on a cookie pan and Broil for about 2 minutes for a Texas Toast style of Garlic Bread.

Excellent! For variety, also try the Baked Baguette with Lemon-Garlic Butter on this site, it too is supurb.

People always love this garlic bread. It has enough garlic which many times garlic bread does not. I have always made garlic bread this way but for one change. Bake the bread in a brown paper bag clipped with a clothespin. This gives it a crispy crust. Don't leave it in the oven too long, or it will not be soft in the middle. If you don't have a clothespin, a paper clip will do, but that is harder to get off when it's hot. You can even staple it, but that too is harder to get off.

Impossible not to love garlic bread. . . I added tarragon to the butter & garlic mixture instead of parsley. Tasted lovely, and my guests raved on!

Really good garlic bread. I've made it twice already. Had to use salted butter, so I cut the salt mixed with the garlic to just a pinch. Didn't use all the parsley, but more than I thought I would.
