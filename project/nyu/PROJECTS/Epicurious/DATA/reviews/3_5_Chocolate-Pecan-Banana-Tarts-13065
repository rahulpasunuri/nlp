This is an easy and delilious dessert in a pinch and most ingredients are available from pantry and freezer. Looks impressive but easy!

Excellent and easy.A nice desert for informal dinner company. Used a bit more chocolate than the recipe.Next time will cut the pastry tart size in half to 2-1/2" x 5" (rather than 5"x5") to make them more manageable to eat and perhaps more elegant.Would be nice with strawberries too.
