I substituted dried lima beans. Very rich, lovely taste. Everyone in my family enjoyed it. Making it again today.

This recipe confused me but once I figured out how to make the soup I was very pleased with the result. I am "new to kale" and looking for options - this one fit the bill nicely. I skipped the lemon juice and added a cup of cooked farro (spelt) that I happened to have in the fridge. Filling and yummy!

This was pretty good, very healthful. I used canned beans, so it was also pretty easy and it went well with some pasta that I made.

Wow! Such great taste from such a simple recipe! Being in the process of moving, I didn't have sage on hand, so I replaced it with an equal amount of dry mint. I also used regular (curly) kale (I think I ended up leaving it for ten minutes, as the recipe does say the kind used is more tender). I am serving it with amaranth, and I am looking forward to using this for the other two recipes based on it.

As 1 fork suggests: it was okay. edible.

This was a perfect last minute use for the kale I had in my fridge and the dried cannellini I've had kicking around my pantry for a while. Served it over a buttery, cheesy polenta with a little sprinkle of grey sea salt for an easy dinner tonight, and I can't wait to make the soup later! Not a four fork meal, just simple, hearty, and healthy.

This was the worst recipe I have ever used on this site. It was a tasteless waste of good food and time. Don't waste your effort on this one!

this was a delicious and satisfying vegetarian meal. my intention was to save most of it for the soup version but we ate it all immediately. if you do want to make the soup - double this recipe. i still saved the "broth" from the beans and used it in another meal.

Made this with fresh butter beans and it was amazing!!! Ended up just having to cook the beans just 50 minutes in the liquid but the flavor was still strong enough. Will definitely make again!!!

BTW, I note that some people thought the cooking time excessive. Cooking time for dried beans definitely depends on how old they are. So you need to monitor them. But no cannelini beans take so long that it is inconvenient to do so. If you think it may take a long time, then start them early as I did at high altitude but check them periodically and take them off when they are tender. There is a bit of art to cooking afterall. No set rules.

My husband loved this. Admittedly he is not a meat and potatoes guy but he is finicky so this recipe is a real coup for me. I'm crazy about it.

Very nice and easy dish. I have seen it in many variations and next time I might add anchovies to the dressing. I used canned beans and simply sauteed the onions, garlic and spices for a few minutes, added kale with water on the leaves, then added beans and voila! 15 minute meal. Oh, I also added fresh parmesan the end.

Love this. Great side dish for just about any type of meat, and good on its own with a salad for a complete meal. We love beans and kale and are always looking for new ways to enjoy them.

I agree that the cooking time is WAY too long unless you're using really old beans. That being said, assuming you check on your beans & don't overcook too much, I was impressed with how easy & flavorful this was. As with any dish with few ingredients, I think making sure that your ingredients themselves are good to begin with might explain the difference in results people are experiencing--make sure your olive oil is flavorful

A waste of cannellini beans from the Italian market. The recipe is bland and the beans split and turned to flavorless, gritty mush. Lacianto kale is not readily available in the Midwest. Seldom does a cooking magazine publish a recipe which is such a ghastly disaster. Bon Appetit is sliding downhill, in my opinion. Maybe the editor will drive it into oblivion, as was the case with Gourmet.

Bland and not worth the trouble. I agree with the other reviewers that the cooking time on the white beans in way too long. Mine were mush and became a revolting paste once they were tangled with the kale. I think this was a waste of great ingredients, especially the gorgeous Lacianto kale a sacrificed to make it. My guests barely ate any of it, even with the crostini.

While this is good the soup that is made with this recipe is far better!

Easy and healthy. I made it as directed except subbed white wine vinegar for lemon juice since I didn't have any lemons. I think with the lemon juice and maybe even a bit of the zest and more salt than I used that this could move up to 4 forks and is good way for me to use up all the kale I get at the market.

the cannellini beans over cooked despite cooking for less than the time suggested. but the real problem was that this was very bland. I felt like it was a waste of time and a lot of good kale.

An hour and a half is way too long for these beans, they were absolute mush. Starting over tomorrow!

One other note, there is only one type of kale in the grocery stores here, the curly kind...I used that and it worked just fine!

Very good and versatile! I used most of the beans to prepare the soup that was in a related recipe, but then I also made a wonderful sauce by sauteeing mushrooms and fennel in some white wine and adding the remaining beans to that - I served over some butternut squash tortellini with a little freshly grated parmesan and that was just wonderful!

Anything with kale, and I am there! Also added the zest from the lemon, and used leeks instead of onion. De-licious!!!

I wrote a similar review in the other part of this recipe, but this recipe is delicious. It was healthy, easy to make, and got better with time. I'm turning the left overs into soup.
