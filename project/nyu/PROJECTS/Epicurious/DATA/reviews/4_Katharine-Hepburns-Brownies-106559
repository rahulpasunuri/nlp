This recipe won't turn out unless you use the full cup of sugar. I thought that sounded like too much sugar for a small 8 x 8 pan, so reduced it to 1/2 cup and the they turned out like a pan cookie, not moist at all. If I do plan to make this again will probably try to figure out a way to increase the moistness without all of the refined sugar.

I miss Laurie Colwin's writing, too! I might have to re-read "Happy All the Time." I haven't tried the brownies yet, but I'll have to give them a go.

This has been my go-to brownie recipe for years, and though I try a new one every once in a while, I always end up coming back to this one! It's the easiest and most delicious I've ever found. If I'm serving it after dinner, I usually put the whole pan on the table and basically just scoop it out with a serving spoon b/c they taste fabulous fresh out of the oven but definitely don't hold together well. These are not the most chocolatey brownies out there, but they are moist with a crisp top and I think just about perfect!

I've been making these brownies for years, literally since I saw the recipe in a magazine. These are by far the best (and easiest!!) brownies I've ever made. I haven't made another kind in years. Every once in a while I'll add mini chocolate chips to the batter for even more chocolate. I recommend these to everyone. Everyone who eats them loves them as well.

I first read this recipe in Laurie Colwin's wonderful 'Home Cooking', and have made half a dozen times since. It's so easy to do, and always delicious. It works with or without walnuts too. I'd definitely recommend this.

Oh wow. These brownies are fantastic. They are moist and delicious. The chocolate is not overwhelming which is nice. I did not change a thing and they came out great!

I am running for office. A friend made these for a "meet and greet" party, and after the brownies I am sure everyone voted for me! ;) Her adjustments: Increase flour to 1/3 c. so that fork or spoon are not required. Triple the recipe for a jelly roll pan.

My strong suggestion is to put the nuts(I use pecans) on top! Anyone who can't eat nuts can pick them off. Obviously this will not work for those who are allergic!!

Let's put it this way, I've eaten almost half of the batch in a few hours! They do make a small batch, very thin but the flavor is great but I did increase the vanilla to one whole teaspoon. I, too, found them a tad sweet so, next time, I will decrease it by about two tablespoons and either add more chocolate or cooca powder. These are about the best iteration of brownies I've ever had and super easy to make all in one bowl if you take advantage of your microwave.

These are perfect for "mom, what's for dessert?" when you didn't make any. Used Hershey's Dutch cocoa, etc. because I lacked Baker's Unsweetened. Next time I will use Valrhona and Nestle's chips. Quality in the choc. is essential. They bring my G'mommy's brownies to mind, without the cracking. Need the cracking.

I made a few changes according to the reviews I read, and the next time I think I'll make these brownies exactly as it was written... ingredient-wise, anyway. I did use a big Pyrex measuring cup to melt the butter and chocolate in the microwave (make sure you chop the chocolate squares coarsely, or they will take longer to melt than the butter), and I used it as my mixing bowl too, which was a good tip! What didn't work well for me was substituting 1/4 cup of good sweet cocoa powder for 1/4 cup of the sugar. The brownies were a little too chocolate-y, and not quite sweet enough for me, so I think I'll stick to the original ingredient list next time and use the full cup of sugar without any cocoa. I followed another reviewer's tip and checked doneness after 20 minutes, which turned out to be spot on for me, BUT I have a convection oven with a strong fan, so take that for what it's worth. I'm looking forward to making these again using what I learned from this experience.

This is my fall back brownie recipe. I melt the butter and chocolate in the microwave together. (Nigella melts chocolate in the micro too). I then just dump the various ingredients into my micro bowl -- actualy it's my 4 cup pyrex thing. So easy. Only one bowl and one spatula to clean up afterwards.

These are amazing - I have been searching for a good homemade brownie recipe for about 8 years now, with few prospects. I made these tonight, waited for them to set enough, and found that they had that perfect sugary crust on top, but were completely fudgy and delicious below. I did make two slight adjustments to the recipe - I cut the sugar by 1/4 cup, and "replaced" it with 1/4 of good quality (Valrhona) cocoa.

Rating: 4
I absolutely love these. They are my go to brownie recipe - and I go to them a lot. Sometimes I warm up some organic peanut butter and swirl it in on top, which, if you are a peanut butter lover, is absolutely delicious. They are quick and easy and never disappoint!

Rating: 4
To the reviewer who thought this recipe was too sweet, I would suggest using another bar or 1/2 of a bar of unsweetened chocolate. That will cut the sweetness and will increase the intensity of the chocolate

Rating: 4
Suggestion: I put whole pecans on the top of the brownies. This allows those who don't want the nuts to pick them off. And it toasts the nuts. This is my favorite brownie recipe and as easy as the brownie mixes but MUCH better.

Made these brownies looking for a quick sweet treat and they hit the mark. I doubled the recipe and added 1 cup each chocolate chunks and coconut, then sprinkled additional on top with some sliced almonds--delicious! My only complaint is that next time, I will definitely reduce the amount of sugar if using same extra ingredients, as they were quite sweet. Why go back to boxed brownies though? :)

Rating: 0
These are the biggest hit at parties and holidays. Everyone always asks for the recipe. After eating these you'll never buy boxed again.

My sister and I discovered this recipe in 1975, and heartily approve with one caveat. The baking time is simply too long! After 40 minutes of baking, these are like cardboard. I find that 20-25 minutes [depending on the size of the eggs] produces a chocolatey brownie with a moist, velvety texture. If you were not impressed by the original recipe, I recommend a second try with this adjustment.

Rating: 4
Yum Yum, I LOVE these. I found them a bit salty the first time I made them, so I use a scant 1/4 t of salt instead. I also experienced the "thin" problem, and found a sure-fire cure: bake a double batch! This recipe is almost as easy to make as brownie mixes, which I appreciate, being a poor, brownie-starved college student.

Thin, chewy, no special depth of flavor. What a waste of time. These were disgusting!!

I loved this recipe, although I agree, they don't bind well at first, but a few hours after baking they held together fine. I used 4 T unsweetened dark cocoa powder instead of the squares and threw a handful of Ghiradelli semi- sweet chocolate chips on top before baking. People at the dinner party swooned.

Rating: 1
Not as good as the other reviews made it out to be. The butter content seemed rather high, and made the brownies greasy and not bind (was there an error in the ingredient amounts?? not enought flour?)

I used to make this recipe 10 years ago from a cut out of the magzaine review with Katherine Hepburn. It was a delight to see if again here, since I lost it. Great recipe!

Rating: 0
I have used this recipe for years and love it! One change I have made is to use unsweetened cocoa powder (3T powder, 1T butter) instead of the chocolate squares that have to be melted. I think it makes for a stronger chocolate flavor - I will even double up on the chocolate sometimes.

Rating: 0
Each square of chocolate is 1 ounce or 28 grams. A good chocolate in the UK would be Green & Black 72% Cooks' Chocolate. Although that does contain sugar. The baking chocolate used here in the US is unsweetened chocolate. In a pinch you could use 3 Tablespoons of unsweetened Cocoa Powder and 1 Tablespoon of Fat such as butter or pure vegetable fat, but because it is a substitute for the original ingredient, you may have a bit of a different result. Good luck!

Rating: 0
Each square of chocolate is 2oz and the percentage of cocoa is only 54%. A better brand of chocolate is Scharffen Berger whose semi-sweet chocolate is 72%. Your results will differ, but its a much better chocolate with a lot more coffee liqueur and a higher quality vanilla.

Fabulous - don't skip the nuts (just use whole!). I bake in a pie dish (earthenware) which totally solves the "thin" problem some describe. Just up the cooking time a few minutes! Even my mother, who doesn't like chocolate deserts is impressed.

I followed this recipe exactly except for I skipped on the nuts. I agree that the brownies were pretty thin and I would say that it's good if you like sugary, fudgy brownies. I personally prefer more cakey, chocolatey ones so this wasn't my favorite.... Still, I would say that it's a safe and delicious recipe.

Chewy and delicious- I was given eye rolls of delight from several who tried them. If you're having trouble getting them out of the pan, just pop the pan in the fridge for a half-hour or so. The edges will come out perfectly clean.

My grandmother cut this recipe out of Gourmet, I think, years ago and has been making it during walnut season every year since. The original recipe featured a cup of walnuts, which I prefer, though this is a great recipe with or without nuts. We were snacking on them on Thanksgiving afternoon and my boyfriend declared that they were the best brownies he'd ever had!

This is my go-to recipe, and has been since I was a little girl. My mom always made this and its truly incredible. No nuts, though! Dust with powdered sugar-its a must. I sometimes serve them with a small scoop of good vanilla ice cream, and a few berries. ENJOY!

I have made this recipe no fewer than ten times. It is beyond compare and the only brownies I like or eat. I always use the nuts. They are super yum and a one-pot wonder. Perhaps a secret to a happy life?

This is my go to brownie recipe when I need a quick dessert. You can make it while you prepare dinner and you can add anything you like or nothing at all. I really like it with a cup of chocolate chips or with M&M's on top - just wait about 8 minutes after you put them in the oven to put them on so they do not sink to the bottom. These are great warm from the oven with ice cream or raspberry or lemon sorbet. If you love chocolate and easy fix! Good luck.

Why does it say 2003? This recipe first appeared in Gourmet in the early 90s. I've been making it regularly since then, especially if I have guests. Even people who claim not to like dessert love these brownies. I misguessed the "2 squares" when I read it, and put in 100g of Valrhona chocolate (about 4 oz). This is now my standard approach - 100g of the best dark eating chocolate you can afford. I heartily recommend you try it - you will never look back.

Scrumptious!!!! It's fudgy enough to just melt in ya mouth yet not dry like the 'cake-like' version! The easiest brownies to make ever!!Followed the tip from one of the reviewer here & subst. 1/3 cup of flour instead cuz i dont like nuts with choc!! It doesn't stick to the pan if u dust it well and SERIOUSLY wait fer it to cool down(i used the disposal aluminium pan and it works well for gooodness sake!). Ps. becuz it's kinda thin in the thickness, cover it with an aluminium foil b4 baking it fer 20 mins then remove and bake fer 10 mins to have a nice crisp at the top (I'm staying in a tropical country so it's damn hot! hence it's faster to bake). ;)

Easy and quick, but not the best brownies ever. They weren't very firm and they seemed more sugary than chocolate-packed. I gave them 2 forks because they were fine and I'd make them again only if I were stuck with two ounces of unsweetened chocolate. Alton Brown, Alice Medrich and Ina Garten have better brownie recipes.

I made a double recipe, and baked it in a 9x13 pan. Despite this not being quite equal to twice the size of an 8x8 pan, they are fairly thin. As others mentioned, they are also rather fudgy, and a little difficult to get out of the pan. Despite all that, they are wonderful! Nice and moist with lots of chocolate flavor. I did it all in one bowl (melted the chocolate and butter in the microwave), and it was really easy cleanup. Definitely a make again recipe.

To the NYC cook, I would assume a 'square' refers to squares of Baker's brand chocolate. And one square = 1 oz. Just weigh 2 oz of chopped chocolate for 2 'squares'.

This is the best brownie recipe, hands down. I've tried many. Also, easy! Try adding this: 4oz cream cheese 1/6 cup sugar 1/2 tsp vanilla 1 egg Whip softened cream cheese, then add sugar and mix again, then add egg and vanilla and mix till just blended. Spread on top of the brownies and either swirl it in or leave on top and sprinkle some choc chips. Delicious.

I'd like to make this b/c of all the great reviews, but how big is a "square" of chocolate? My fave chocolate is Callebaut and my market sells it chopped up into big chunks, not in standardized squares.

Really delicious brownies, and so easy. These will be my standard recipe. I melted the butter and chocolate together in the microwave. Also doubled the vanilla and used a heaping 1/4 cup of flour. Since they're so fudgy, they need to cool completely before you cut and eat.

If you want a yummy, chocolatey brownie that's super easy to prepare with minimal fuss, then this is your recipe. This is almost identical to the Fudge Brownie recipe in my Better Homes and Gardens cookbook, except this one calls for a bit less vanilla and flour. I've been making these for years and love how I only have to dirty a saucepan to get great tasting brownies. No bells and whistles here - just good basic fudge brownies!

Very moist & chewy. Similar to my favorite brownie recipe but uses more butter, less flour, less chocolate. Delicious. Would definitely make again. Add a little shredded coconut next time, maybe?? (I did increase the flour to 1/3 cup as previously suggested and it worked for me!)

I've been making these since I first saw them in Laurie Colwin's original article. I sure miss her :-( They are delicious and gooey, but I do agree that they don't make a beautiful presentation. The edges are never clean. Thought I would share something with others. I recently made these for a friend who cannot eat wheat. I substituted soy flour and the brownies did not suffer one iota. Just as delicious. Couldn't even tell the difference.

Delicious chocolately flavor, but oh-so-gooey! Not great for serving to company or bringing to someone else's house since they are tough to cut into neat little squares - their extreme moistness is the problem. They are really tasty, though. Not a cake-like brownie - more of a fudgy type.

This is a great simple moist brownie. I used 1/3 cup flour, so it wouldn't be so gooy.

A great minimal-effort-maximum-effect recipe. Need a quick recipe for a potluck? Forget to make treats for your child's school bake sale? This is the recipe for you. Better than any supermarket brownie mix and just as fast and easy to make! Good, strong chocolate punch with a decadently chewy texture; it's sure to appeal to many. I love this one plain with a ganache topping sprinkled with toffee chips. I also like to replace the walnuts with a heaping half cup of macadamia nuts and a half cup of white chocolate chunks. Not my favorite brownie recipe, but it's the one I make the most. They can be tricky to remove from the pan. I make a "brownie sling" out of tin foil buy folding the foil to fit the pan leaving about 4 inches overhanging on both sides of the pan, butter and dust the pan with the foil in it, add the batter and bake. They lift right out of the pan. As with most brownie recipes, be careful not to overbake. Moist crumbs should still cling to the cake tester. Also, I have doubled this recipe and baked it in a 9x13 pan with no problems.

I really loved the way they tasted but couldn't get them out of the pan. Gooey is an understatement. I had to use a spoon to eat them. I didn't use the walnuts so maybe that's why. I need a brownie I can wrap my fingers around. I couldn't with these.

I've been making these brownies for years-probably found them in the same magazine article mentioned in the review. They're wonderful, easy, foolproof and need the walnuts (pecans are good too). I like to use cocoa powder to "Flour" the pan instead of flour.
