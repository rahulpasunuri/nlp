It's pretty tasty. I added a shallot and 2 cloves of garlic with the mushrooms, but I think I might add more next time.

had a a package of mushrooms that I had to use, so I tried this - it was very good. I added a minced shallot and a little garlic to the mushrooms, and used parmesan instead of swiss (didn't have any) and it tasted great.

Super easy. Great to whip up in a pinch when you want to impress. Keep in mind that frittatas tend to be much better if you make them the day ahead and then reheat them when you want to eat them. The flavours meld better that way.

My boyfriend and I really liked this dish and have made it several times.

Not bad. Try rubbing the skillet with a peeled clove of Garlic before adding egg mixture.

Nothing too special, just a quick, basic omelet (frittata).
