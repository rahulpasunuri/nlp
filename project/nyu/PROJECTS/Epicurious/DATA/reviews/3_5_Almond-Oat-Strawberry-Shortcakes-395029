I tried the first batch with a Greek style yogurt butter which contains 9 grams of fat rather then 12 grams to full fat butter, they spread out all over! I thought maybe it had something to do with the lower fat butter that I used so I made another batch using regular butter and even chilled the bisquits so the cold butter would help them rise this time, I got the same results. I read all the comments before I began and it does not seem anyone else had the same problem, which I find very puzzling. I have made millions of biscuits in my time and never encountered this issue so it is not my technique. The taste was yummy but presentation falls flat, literlely !

Made this for a tea party..... an instant hit! Everyone raved about it and wanted the recipe.... the almonds add a great flavor and texture. My family loves it too.

Served this to friends and everyone liked how light yet satisfying dessert was. The biscuit had great texture and flavor. I had no mixer, so mixed everything by hand. Mine also came out a bit crumbly after cooking but still retained enough shape to plate well. Used ground oat flour and ground almond flour which I already had in the fridge so that helped to speed things up. I prefer light brown sugar with fruit so used that with the strawberries. Did feel I needed more whipped cream though. Overall, simple and delish!

I loved these. Simple flavors, easy to make, and my guests loved them. Some reviewers mentioned crumbliness being a problem - since I was doubling the batch, I did not add the cream to the food processor, but mixed that in by hand. I've found that it's easy to over-process the wet ingred. into the dry in the food processor, resulting in a dry or tough biscuit. Anyway, these turned out a perfect consistency, with good flavor and sweetness.

Made it exactly as written and it tasted marvelous. My only criticism is that, having followed the directions exactly, I found the shortcakes very hard to cut in half for serving. They were too thin (perhaps my fault) and crumbly. It all blends together in your mouth anyway, the cream, strawberries, and shortbread. But it made for an awful presentation that disappointed me after all the work it took to make them.

Oh wow. Delicious, easy to make, looks like the picture. I must have eaten a quarter of the batter before it hit the baking sheet. Made it as-is and can't wait to have the leftover biscuits tomorrow!

Fantastic. It does need to be eaten with a strategy so the fillings don't drop / fall out. But very delicious with a cup of tea.

REALLY REALLY yummy! This is everything strawberry shortcake should be but isn't. I used 1/2 white whole wheat flour and 1/2 bread flour since it is what I had on hand. The scones were PERFECT and the whole thing was really good.

These were gobbled up in no-time! I used orange juice instead of Grand Mariner on the strawberries. See pics here: http://eatingininstead.com/2012/04/08/almond-oat-strawberry-shortcakes/

Very good strawberry shortcake recipe. I used two packets of maple-flavored instant oatmeal that I had on hand which gave it an interesting flavor twist. The texture of the shortcakes made it difficult for me to cut in half and keep in a full slice while layering the strawberries inside the cakes. I had to piece several of the cakes together. Nobody seemed to notice the fact that the pieces had come apart. I enjoyed the almost crumbly texture that this recipe provided.

I had just got a new Food Processor in the morning and saw this recipe in the afternoon, so was motivated to make it that night and exercise my new tool. It shortcake came together pretty quickly with the food processor and the oatmeal and almonds made it interesting and a hit with the family. I used a half-teaspooon of orange extract instead of Gran Marnier which gave a new flavor twist to me early-season strawberries.

Family loves strawberry shortcake. I make every new recipe I find. This version was very well received. Everyone commented on the depth of flavor. I made it per recipe directions, amounts and cooking time. The result looked like the picture. Very delicious.
