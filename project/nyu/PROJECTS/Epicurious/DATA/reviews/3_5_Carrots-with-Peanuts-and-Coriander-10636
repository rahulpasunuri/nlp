These carrots are just wonderful....I prepared them as written, with the addition of about a teaspoon of lemon zest. The organic carrots in our CSA box are so sweet and tender, and this recipe suits them perfectly!

Ignore the esoteric review below and just make these as stated. They're wonderful. If you don't like coriander/cilantro you can probably use nice Italian parsley or the curly kind. I added a bit of sugar and salt to the cooking water as I like my carrots sweet and salty.

This recipe seems to be a variation of a Maharashtrian (Maharashtra is a state in western India) 'koshimbir' which roughly translates to 'chopped salad'. This staple is prepared by tossing together: coarsely grated raw veggies, ground dry roasted peanuts, salt, sugar, lemon juice, chopped hot green chilies, and chopped corriander. The idea behind adding ground peanuts is to add crunch and soak up some of the juices that salt, lemon and chillies draw out. Koshimbir may include a perfumed oil seasoning: add a 1/8 teaspoon each of black mustard seeds and whole cumin seeds to 1t of hot smoking oil. Also add a tiny pinch of asafoetida (a pungent resin used in Indian cuisine). Stir into the salad right away. Veggie combos for koshimbir: carrot; carrot and cabbage; red onions or scallions, tomatoes, cauliflower and cucumber.

I still have trouble cooking carrots, so my carrots were a little bit too crunchy. However the flavor was good. I omitted the honey and used honey-roasted peanuts instead. Also used salted butter. Both of these additions gave it the salt we needed.

So simple and delicious. Would go with so many things. My husband, who thought the recipe sounded boring and generally has to be forced to eat his veggies, actually perks up whenever I suggest making it again. Definitely a keeper.

I was hoping for a bolder flavor, maybe just salt would bring it out. It smelled wonderful while cooking and looked great. Could combine with a varitety of ethnic dishes.

This is a fabulous recipe. We just loved these carrots. I tend to have a pretty strong sweet tooth so I used 1T honey (instead of 1t). They were a great accompaniment to Grilled Chicken with Thai-spiced Oil.

This carrots were delicious. I steamed them in my handy steamer. They were not too sweet which is plus for me. They also presented very nicely. I used carrots that were already sliced with nice grooves in them. They looked beautiful on a dark blue polish pottery piece!

This is the first carrot recipe that my family has actually gobbled up. My toddler & preschooler loved it! I used the microwave to lightly steam the carrots then tossed the rest of the ingredients on them & served.
