I thought this was rich and full of flavor. I made a few tweeks to make it easier and use what I had. I soaked the beans the night before. But I didn't seen any reasons for the multiple steps after that. I just I sauteed the onions and garlic in my big soup pot, dumped in everything else, and simmered until done. I used 1/2 dried and 1/2 fresh mushrooms, chicken broth, and threw the red pepper in at the beginning. I had spinach instead of chard, so I added that at the very end. Not quick, but yummy, easy, and healthy.

I misread the ingredients and made this with kale! Used two portabellas because i did not have dried. Sauteed them with the onions. Used veg broth instead of water to be vegan friendly. This requires salt. . . Willl use knorr veg broth cube next time. Grwat over garlic mashed potatoes.

Cooked lima beans in water and 32 oz of beef broth and added tablespoon of dried parsley and Herbs de Provence and it was outstanding. Other reviews said it was bland so I kicked it up at the beginning. Great winter dish.

It was bland as specified. I added some dijon mustard and lots of salt and pepper, and used veggie broth instead of water, and then it was quite good. I'll make it again with these changes.

Absolutely delicious! The lima beans give it a nice texture and flavor. The lima beans can be cooked in a slow cooker ahead of time, if you don't want to take the 45 minutes the day of. I would recommend for a nice winter's evening

I can't believe anyone actually tasted this recipe before publishing it. It just tastes strange... I added some homemade chicken broth and a splash of vinegar to try to perk it up. I also shredded Gruyere to the individual bowls. It's edible, but certainly not exciting!

Unlike the other reviewers, we actually enjoyed this tremendously and it was very filling served over rice and looked as good as it did in the picture. I did make a few changes. Instead of water, I used vegetable broth. We used wild mushrooms we gathered (saved cost :), added 1 tsp salt, and doubled the crushed red pepper. We served it over brown rice. Even our 6-year-old daughter liked this.

What a waste of dried porcini mushrooms... Honestly, this smelled so good, yet majorly lacked in the flavor department. The addition of a copious amount of salt made it taste much better, though I felt I had to add an unhealthy amount to get to the 'edible' stage.. Very disappointing, and I would never make it again.

This was an okay hearty, healthy dish, but a bit lacking. I only used 2 packages of dried mushrooms, (it became a bit expensive for a vegetarian dish!) and it seemed too much. The picture in the February issue looked much more tempting than the actual finished dish. We grated some aged gruyere (didn't have any parmesan) to it at the table, and that helped somewhat. Maybe a rind of parmesan added during the cooking would help too. If I make this again, I will tinker with it, because I do like the idea of these ingredients together.
