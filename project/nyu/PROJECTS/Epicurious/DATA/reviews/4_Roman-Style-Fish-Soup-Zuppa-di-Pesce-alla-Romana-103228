Don't understand what everyone else loved about this recipe. For us it was bland and definitely missing something, or many things. The fish and seafood was good but think that was because I purchased top quality ingredients. Will not be making this again.

This was absolutely delicious. I was only making for two, and switched up the seafood a bit (rockfish, squid and shrimp), per other reviews, but I still mostly stuck to the recipe. I used a bit more liquid (1 cup tomato puree, 1 1/2 cups clam juice) and it created a delicious broth. Will definitely be making again, probably trying some other seafoods for variety's sake.

This is a great basic starter recipe for zuppa di pesce. I generally use a mixture of tilapia, scallops, squid, and sometimes clams -- the scallops and squid really release a lot of flavor and make the broth quite rich. I tend to cook longer than the recipe suggests so the broth gets more rich, and use a LOT more parsley than called for - I think that really finishes off the flavor perfectly. A great winter soup, and so easy to make!

Yep this was very good. Next time I will allow the sauce to reduce a bit more and add the squid which I did not use (had monk fish and mussels). Used canned tomatoe and onions too. Did not throw out the garlic (throw out the garlic?) and also used chicken broth instead of water. Served on plate with toasted italian bread smeared with garlic. Yummy . . .

One of the most tasteless recipes I have ever cooked! after reading the comments I thought it would be excellent, but had to use oven roasted tomatoes to give it more flavour.

WONDERFUL MEAL!!! You will not regret paying a little extra for all the seafood. It's a 5-star restaurant-quality recipe for the home. I don't have many recipes I repeat, but this is a staple at my house.

This is great, really lends itself to customizing (omit squid, add shrimp, increase liquid) etc. and still turns out great. The wine and red pepper flakes are key. I serve this over orzo and everyone loves it.

Great recipe, althouth I live a mile off the Mediteranian sea,I used what I had in the Fridge/Freezer which was salmon fillet and baby shrip. Go easy on the crushed peppers!

Excellent and easy! I followed the path taken by other reviewers, ie left the garlic in (and doubled the amount), added scallops and shrimp, and substituted canned tomatoes and clam juice for the water. Simple flavors with a kick of pepper, but the seafood really shined through. I plan to serve the leftovers over pasta tonight.

Fantastic! Easy, quick and hearty. Placed bread on the side & added a dash of pernod!

I've made this many times and it is always amazing. I've varied the seafood, but my favorite mix is squid, then shrimp and scallops instead of fish and clams. Don't omit the squid - it gives out a lot of juice that creates the amazing flavor of the broth. Also I would never put the bread on the bottom, I serve it on the side. Truly easy and amazing meal, great for guests who love seafood.

I thought this recipe was great. Very easy and delicious. I would not use too much of the whiting fish as it breaks apart in the soup. I made this for company and everyone loved it. Instead of serving the soup over bread, I served it on top of the soup so everyone could dip it in.

Excellent. I added scallops in addition to the other seafood. Be sure to have plenty of bread - my husband sopped up all the broth with it!

Delicious soup! I only used half of the amount of oil, used scallops instead of squid (added them with the fish and clams) and used thin slices of garlic, which I left in the broth. I forgot to add the water so my broth was quite rich, but all the better for dipping my bread into. Next time, I'll add more red pepper flakes because I liked the spicyness of the soup. I served the soup with a side of sauteed broccoli rabe. This soup is full of flavor and so easy to prepare - a perfect weekday meal.

Quick and easy to make, and very tasty too. A few changes -- sauteed the garlic alone and then removed it from the pan before adding the crushed red pepper, used canned diced tomatoes and their juice, added a pinch or two of saffron threads to the pan along with the white wine, and substituted bottled clam juice for water. Next time I would probably add a little more liquid than called for -- the broth is so good!

So simple and so good. I used veggie stock and canned tomatoes and added some green pepper corns. Fit for company in less than an hour. Fabulous!

New Year's Resolution: to wean my children, ages 7 and 10, off fish sticks forever. When I announced it was fish soup, I heard jeers. However, blowing my mind, they discovered a new taste sensation: squid! They loved this, and so did I. I too used canned tomatoes - and Trader Joe patrons take note: you can get all ingredients for this recipe there, and have shopping & cooking done in less than an hour! Brilliant! Thank you!

Delicious! I am amazed at how versatile this recipe is. I have tried all sorts of fish combinations and it always turns out great.

This fish stew is fantastic!!!even better than the portuguese fish stew(that is done with the fish bones and heads and after the fish is cooked you take wathever meat is left over in the bones and heads),this is more liked fish stew than soup.I most likely make it again, sinse i'm a fish eater,more than meat eater!

This soup was really good! And very easy to make. I changed it a bit since my resources were limited and I've never been able to follow a recipe anyway. I used scallops instead of squid which really added good flavor to the broth. I didn't let the juices simmer off , I used abt 10 cloves of garlic, 5 pinches of peppers, added some herbes de provence (go great with scallops) and doubled the water with the water I used to boil the fish bones. (my family has a cold and I needed a brothy soup) Also, the tomatoes I got were very poor quality and after I put them in the soup just looked nasty so after about 5 miuntes in the pot i removed them with a slotted spoon and they added nice flavor. It's alot of olive oil and is really good that way but I think that you could reduce the olive oil and the dish would still be really tasty,

This was an extremely easy, not-at-all time consuming dish! The broth was mildly flavored, which allowed the flavors of the various seafoods to come through. I used 1/2 pound of fresh sea scallops, and 1/2 pound of shrimp, instead of the squid (added them when I added the fish), and it was superb! Used canned tomatoes as per the test kitchen recommendations, which saved on time also. Delicious!!

To make the kosher variation of this recipe, I'ce changed sea-food to chopped celary stems and hummus grains (cheackpeas), and it was very tasty and rich fish soup and easy-made as well. Definitely worth doing it again.

Great recipe. Quite similar to one that I eat in my favorite Italian restaurant, locally. I made this last minute and used canned tomatoes. I used thin slices of garlic, and left them in. Shrimp and little neck clams were perfect!
