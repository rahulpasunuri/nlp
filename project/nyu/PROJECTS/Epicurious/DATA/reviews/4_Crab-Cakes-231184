These crab cakes had great flavor but needed another egg yolk or two to help them stick together. I also would suggest pan frying them first before putting them in the oven as we couldn't get any color on them with the melted butter/baking method.

I used Panko crumbs rather than the bread since they are more crunchy and rather than baking, I sauteed in olive oil. Served with a cajun remaoulade sauce and fresh grilled corn with lima beans.

Oops--forgot to add: serve it with sriracha aioli!

Fantastic! I've made crab cakes only once before and had problems keeping them together in the skillet. Not this recipe. The "sauce" really helps keep them from crumbling apart. My sauce broke too, but my fiance (who knows a lot more about cooking than I do) explained that once you add the cream, you shouldn't try to bring to a boil b/c too-high temps will destroy your sauce. I almost went with the cheap-o crab, but sprung for the premium lump jumbo crab--and it was worth every penny! I'll make this recipe again and again!

yum, this is a great recipe. i used much less butter over the top and it still worked nicely. i also had to use rice flour to create the roux (due to gluten intolerance) and although its consistency was odd at first, once the egg, mustard and other ingredients were added it sorted itself out nicely.

These were good and easy. I only used one kind of crabmeat which worked fine.No sauce necessary.

Made these as appetizers and they were the rave of the party. Only changes were that I made them smaller and fried them in a splash of safflower oil.

These are the best crab cakes I have had--anywhere. Anytime I eat out and order crab cakes, they never measure up to "my" (and by my I mean Epicurious's) recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and used Panko breadcrumbs on the outside for added crunch. Bravo!!

I've made this for the last three year's for our New Year's party. EVERYONE LOVES THEM!!! I wouldn't add breadcrumbs... if you put them in the refrigerator for about an hour the mixture firms up a bit... making the the crab cakes easier to form. I never had a problem with my butter or cream separating... and I'm not the best cook, so I'm not sure what other reviewers did wrong. If I want them crispier I put them under the broiler briefly. They're really wonderful!

For the previous reader - try coating with panko (Japanese bread crumbs) for a crunchier crust.

The flavor was fantastic, and I would not agree with other reviewers regarding adding breadcrumbs to the mixture. The only enhancement that I would want to make to this recipe would be to have a crunchier crust on the outside. Does anyone have a solid recommendation for doing so?

The seasoning was terrific in these crab cakes and I have tried many. The only fault I have to find is that they were not easy to work with - they could use some of the bread crumbs in the mixture. This should not alter the overall results very much.

These crab cakes are delicious but the next time I make them I will mix some of the breadcrumbs in for easier handling and better form.

The flavor of these crab cakes is wonderful - very nice ingredients. However, they are not easy to form without any breadcrumbs - the next time I would add some fresh breadcrumbs to give them a better shape then maybe four forks.

Very tasty, and no frying! We imagine a light sauce would be a lovely addition.

Very tasty crab cakes. I served them with Chive and Caper Sauce, a recipe I also found on this site, which made for a delightful combination. This has the "quick recipe" symbol next to it in the listing which I didnot find to be true. It took me awhile to assemble. Maybe it was just one of those days, but keep this in mind if you are in a big hurry. I must say it was worth the time.

These were very delicious...moist and tender. I added some lemon zest to perk it up a bit and used whole weat breadcrumbs instead of making them form sliced bread. The only concern I had was while making it is that the sauce started to break after mixing in the cream. As it colled it came back together but I am wondering inf any one else had this experience.

Possibly the best crab cakes I've ever had. They came out very crispy from the oven and were delicious. I used 3 pounds of crab and had 6 cakes left over after serving 6 people. I did add a bit of Old Bay cause I just had to. I also served them with a caper mayonnaise sauce from the website. This was also excellent.

These are some of the best crab cakes we've had. No mayo, no "old bay" seasoning, very meaty and tasty. Not quite as crispy as I would have expected, but we will definitely make these over and over.
