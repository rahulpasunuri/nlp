We made this for an Easter brunch and it was a complete waste of time. They tasted fine but were nothing special and definitely not worth all of the time involved. They are HUGE! Each blini is ten inches across. Not what I usually think of as blini. We wound up rolling them around steamed asparagus and sour cream.

I made these for use with lox as an appetizer for Christmas dinner. Worked great, very popular. I made small dollar pancake sized blinis rather than the large ones. The rice flour made them quite light and the chives complemented the salmon.
