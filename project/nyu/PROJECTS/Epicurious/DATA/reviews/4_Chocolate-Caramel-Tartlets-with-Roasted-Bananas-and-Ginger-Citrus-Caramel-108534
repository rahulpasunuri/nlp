These were great and got rave reviews, but they are VERY rich. I made them the first time in 4 1/2" tart pans and none of my guests could finish them. I made them a second time in 2" tins and they were a better size.

The finished product is beautiful and quite impressive but it was VERY time consuming. The crust was kind of dry and bland but the fillings were yummy. It was very rich and I can't imagine anyone finishing a whole one. (We shared) The ginger sauce and the bananas really made this special.

Very easy if you get organized before you start. I, too, tasted the tartlet without the ginger-caramel sauce, but would make it if I was serving to guests. (I was just experimenting this time). Personally, it's not my thing, but I could see how a chocolate-lover would go for it.

Delicious! I just made the tartlets and they were fabulous, will definately make again.

This was an absolutely delicious recipe. I skipped the ginger-caramel sauce and just placed the bananas on the side of the tartlet. Everything except the bananas can be done ahead of time, and they look beautiful. Would definitely make again!

I thought this dessert was terrific. I made the whole thing, including the ginger-citrus caramel sauce and the roasted bananas. While the caramel sauce was delicious and easy to make, if you are short on time I think you could skip it; the intense chocolate in the tart largely overwhelmed the ginger-citrus taste. I wouldn't skip the bananas, however. They provided a nice flavor contrast to the chocolate/caramel tart. Don't be put off by the number of steps. They all were easy and can be done ahead of time. I roasted the bananas while brewing after dinner coffee.

Unbelievable. I used Scharfenberger chocolate. I did not make the roasted bananas or the ginger citrus caramel. I just made the tartlets themselves. My husband said it was one of the all time best desserts he's ever had.
