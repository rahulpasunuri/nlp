The first time I made this recipe in 2001 my family swooned. They have been requesting it over and over again, and it has become a holiday tradition. Real truffles make a huge difference in flavor. We tried the recipe with inexpensive supermarket truffles and it was good but nothing compared to the real thing. The recipe is surprisingly easy once you get the trick of making the gravy and if you have all the right tools.

Great for Thanksgiving. Used a boneless turkey breast and white truffles from Oregon (not quite a strong so a bit of truffle oil in the gravy did the trick). Great flavors!

I made this recipe for Christmas dinner and it was excellent. The turkey came out moist and delicious. My family said that the gravy tasted wonderful. I will keep this recipe for future holidays.

I spent $70 for a fresh truffle when I couldn't find any bottled black truffles. THEN, I followed the directions for the amount of time to cook the bird and it was WAY undercooked. The whole affair cost me $100 just for the bird and it just wasn't worth it.

Amazing! So moist, so delicious. Did not use chestnuts, and only made a 12 lb. bird - much less cooking time. Cognac gravy was incredible. This was my first bird, and it will be hard to top!
