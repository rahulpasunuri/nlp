I made this for for our dinner tonight and we both agreed that this is the tastiest thing we have eaten in awhile. I used Yukon golds and mixed some shallots in with the onions. The cooking times are absolutely perfect. I found it easy to turn by placing a salad sized plate over the pan and inverting the rosti onto the plate, then just slid the rosti right back into the pan. I did follow the first reviewer's suggestion of cooking the rosti at medium vs. medium high and to use a mix of butter/oil vs. all butter. The crust was brown and crispy, the inside was nice and moist, and the bits of ham were a nice chewy textural contrast to the potatoes. This one is a keeper!

This is a great recipe that my family loved but I would suggest a few changes as the orginal instructions led to a burnt, overcooked product the first two times I did this. First, when the potato mixture is put in the pan, use one tablespoon butter and one tablespoon vegetable oil instead of just butter (my wife's suggestion). This reduces the risk of burning the crust. Second, lower the leat to medium rather than medium-hot when frying the Rosti. Finally, cook the first side of the Posti an additional five minutes (not seven) at medium heat (this makes a total of seven minutes per side). The Rosti also tastes great with sour cream if you don't feel like cooking the eggs.
