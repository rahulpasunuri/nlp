Advice: look for Collard Greens w Red Onions and Bacon instead, a recipe from GOURMET, December 1995. I am one of many who loves that recipe. Since I purchased a ham hock to make beans and greens on New Year's Day, I decided to cobble together the instructions here with the best of that recipe, making sure there were plenty of sautéed red onions to amp up the flavor of the one-note stock. I also added apple cider vinegar and 1 T of light brown sugar. While mustard and turnip greens are much more fragile than collards, that was all there was at the supermarket by the time I went shopping. We'll see how that goes. I'd also suggest trying to find some of GOURMET's recipes from Jan. 2008.

This is quite a bland recipe for making collards. Here's what I do: I suggest using a smoked turkey wing instead of a ham hock, and chicken broth instead of water. I also add an onion, some fresh garlic, and soy sauce (instead of table salt) to my collards; they come out exceptional each time.

I add a tea spoon more red pepper flakes,2 table spoon white vinger, and half a spanish onion. Still this recipe is great for a beginner.

great base, but instead of pepper flakes, I used several shakes of tobasco sauce, 1 tbsp fresh ground black pepper and a few tbsps cider vinegar, about 1/2 a coarsely chopped vidalia onion and about 2/3 the water - the smell of it cooking brought me back to my childhood in the South!

I would brown some diced onions, use smoked turkey wing pieces and a pinch of sugar. Thats along with the other sugestions of broth, etc.

One ham hock? 4 qts of water . . . bad combination! I agree the majority of the ingredients and techniques are missing from this recipe.

As a foodie, I assure that you need to make (authentic) collards as such: brown hocks or bacon with a chopped onion. Add collards and chicken stock (not water!) along with about a 1/4 cup of vinegar and a jalapeno and simmr with lid for 45 mins. At the end remove hock and dice up the meat and return to pot. Yum!

Being from the south I tried this and it was ho-hum as written. I suggest increase Ham Hock to 2 or 1/2 pound and add 3 heaping Tablespoons of "southern style" bacon grease, that being grease poured into a clean coffee can and refrigerated until it solidifies. Measure the solid form.
