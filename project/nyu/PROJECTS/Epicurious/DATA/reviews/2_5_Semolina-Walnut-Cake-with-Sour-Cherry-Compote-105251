Easy and very good. Be sure to use all the syrup. Also, the cake doesn't work without the cherry compote.

This cake was quick and easy, not too sweet (despite the syrup), and had a great texture; firm but moist. It seemed like there was too much syrup, but it all soaked into the cake nicely. This would be great for picnics.

Five eaters, one opinion, not bad but not great either. We found it a bit dry and a bit heavy.
