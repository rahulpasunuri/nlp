These were terrible! My kids had 1 bite and said "No thanks." Enough said.

3.5 forks. A great basic recipe with lots of opportunity to create variations. I made the recipe exactly as stated but found the oil was a bit hot, so I had to turn it down or else the batter would brown, long before it cooked through. Served it with honey as well as the powdered sugar, and it was great. =)

So easy! They come together in a snap. I had to make substitutions for what I had on hand, whole wheat flour and egg whites were used. I guess in a way this made my version more healthy! They puffed up light and delicious and golden brown. A great way to use up my leftover fresh pinapple.

I made this one night when I wanted something sweet to watch with tv. It came together quickly and disappeared even quicker. Making it again tonight just because I have been thinking about them but am using canned tidbits instead of chunks - found chunking pineapple too big.

Tastes even better served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream! Contrast of the hot and cold is amazing!

Delicious! We dropped the batter in teaspoonfuls rather than tablespoonfuls and liked them.

I make corn fritters regularly, so I thought I would try something different. I made the recipe without changing it, and everyone loved them! I served them with some Chinese-style dishes. I have made them several times, a keeper recipe. Finally getting around to rating them!

I served these with a Honey-Ginger Salmon with Chipotle Chilis for dinner. The slightly sweet and citrus pineapple/banana flavors offset the "hot" of the chipotle chilis. They were wonderful!!! I used only 1Tbsp. of brown sugar. In addition, I made them large so each person was served 1 with their entree. I also fried them in a little less oil for health reasons.

This was easy to make, and even easier to make dissapear. I took the suggestions of the other viewers and added apples along with my bananas. My three year old and my nephew ate so many I had to make a second batch.

I halved the batch knowing that I'd eat them all myself. These are great! Back on my diet again...

I used all apples instead of bananas & pineapples, with cinnamon instead of ginger--its a winner--try cinnamon sugar dusting!!! My family can eat them fast enough

Incredibly good. I'll be eating a lot of these!

These were very easy to make. I followed the directions exactly and they turned out wonderful. I think apples or other fresh fruit could be used. The recipe does make 22. The next time I will have to double it because they rapidly disappear. In my opinion these are special enough to use for dessert for a special occasion or a fancy brunch.
