I've made this recipe and loved it! Very thick, rich and creamy. I put the vanilla bean in as I heat the half and half mixture. When the bean is softened it's easier to scrape the seeds from the inside. Then return both and continue heating. I strain the thickened creme into a bowl, set the bowl inside a larger one lined with ice cubes and stir until it is cooled. That keeps a film from forming on top as it cools. If you keep your stove top temperature down and take your time you shouldn't have any trouble with it curdling. I have also made a lighter version using only 1/2 cup sugar and 1% milk. The consistency isn't quite as thick and not as sweet. My husband prefers this version. Either way, it's absolutely delicious. My favorite is with a flour less chocolate cake as others have said.

Overly sweet, very eggy and too thick, this came out more like an eggnog custard. I thought it was too gross to serve but my guests disagreed. Make at your own peril.

Very easy and oh my gosh very good. I was eating it by the spoon full. It definitely made the Grand Marnier souffle. I have leftover, so will pour over fresh fruit.

This did NOT turn out at all. VERY yellow. While it never boiled, and I cooked it much shorter than 12 minutes, the custard became curdled and the consistency was very grainy, even after straining. I've never made something that turned out so completely wrong from Epicurious before!

Made this today - it turned out too sweet, too yellow, and too flat for my taste. I wouldn't make this again without some serious changes.

Although it tasted okay, six eggs yolks are certainly way too many. The yellow tint was also a bit unappealing. Next time, I would use 3 yolks. I ended up adding a bit of 1% milk to thin it out and take away some of the egg taste.

Oh my God! This is unbelievably good. Added a little dark rum after cooking the sauce and served it with strawberries and Angel Food Cake slices for a party. Everyone raved and one guy even asked if he could lick the bowl....

DOODZ!!!1 This tasted real great! But you have to be careful because i let it accidently come to boiling and it got gritty so i strained it and then it was ok. Also i didn't have vanila beans so i used vanila extract. But in spaite of those problems it turned out great and i surved it with some fluorless chocolate cake it's great!!!!1 Im not a good cook but i think i might be becomming one so dont be afraid to trai (sp?) some new recipes like this one its actualy really easy and tastes spetacyoolar!!!!1

Incredible Flavor, don't bother unless you can use real Vanilla Bean with real extract it won't have the same depth of flavor.

Fabulous. The vanilla bean is what makes it special. I served with pound cake and fresh strawberries-- yum!

This was an outstanding recipe for creme anglaise! I served it in a large balloon wine glass with just some fresh berries; the only complaint from my guests was that they couldn't lick the glass! Do strain it on completion and cool down in a bowl of ice before refrigerating.

Delicious. I added some dark rum to the final product, which complimented the vanilla bean nicely. Definitely cool it down by putting the sauce in a metal bowl over ice. Was excellent on angel food cake.

This is such an easy recipe. I have made it for Christmas with wine poached pears and it is very elegant and delicious!!. I cut the recipe in half, and substituded the vanilla beans for pure vanilla extract and it worked fine. I highly recomended, specially because I always look for simple ingredients as well as easy to make recipes since I am not an experienced cook yet. So try it, you'll love it.
