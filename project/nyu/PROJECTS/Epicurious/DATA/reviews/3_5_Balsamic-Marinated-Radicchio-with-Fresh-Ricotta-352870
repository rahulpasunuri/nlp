Tried this tonight with our green radicchio from the CSA. I cut the olive oil in half, and next time would cut the garlic down to 3 cloves--5 was a bit much. My hubby and I agreed that the ricotta was a must--the creaminess helped to mellow out the bitter radicchio.

This was good but not exceptional. I followed the recipe exactly except used a cherry balsamic as suggested by another reviewer. The fresh ricotta from Maplebrook Farm in Connecticut that I purchased at Whole Foods was the best part of this dish. The radicchio was very bitter and although we like bitterness, this recipe seemed to be what my husband called "untested." I dunno, maybe we could try it again and chilled next time? I'm not confident.

Yum! I love radicchio and this was a good and easy way to make it as well as tone down the bitterness. I didn't have any ricotta but it was good without.

This was one of the most wonderful dishes I've made in a very long time. It was super easy to make, was very unique, was light, and was delicious. Everyone loved it. This is going to be a regular feature in our home from now on. I'm thrilled to have found such a unique delicious dish.

Wonderful dish, the color is excellent and it was so well received by everyone (except the 15 year old). What a nice change of pace to add to the rotation.

My family loves this recipe - thanks for posting it! My husband is lactose intolerant, and I am a vegan so the two of us leave the cheese out and it is still delicious! For the balsamic, we use Lucini Italia - they have infused balsamics (fig or cherry - www.lucini.com) that add a nice extra layer to the profile, especially if we don't have basil on hand. Simple to make, and tastes great.
