Loved this recipe and didn't change or alter a thing! Absolutely no need to. I found the beurre rouge had a nice flavor, not at all too vinegary. From my research, there is no hard and fast rule about the ratio of wine to vineger.I definitely strained the solids out of the reduction as it would affect the silkiness and smooth of the butter sauce. One shouldn't have pieces like that in such a sauce, perhaps a smidge of something, but not the remnants of half-cup of minced shallots. The recipe stands and I intend to make this often and also this sauce for salmon. It will be a natural.

This was a nice flavor, but not exceptional. It was a nice main course, but I had forgotten about it the next evening. The sauce was somewhat watery, and I would make sure that I let it thicken more so that it coats the scallops more. I did not serve it over rice or pasta, but I did serve toasted slices of homemade bread with it to soak up the sauce. I followed the suggestion to use more wine than vinegar, which I think was wise. I did add a few splashes of vinegar (to taste) subsequently, but I think the vinegar:wine ratio in the recipe would have been too much. A nice change of pace and not too time consuming.

This recipe is 4+!!! The sauce was bursting with flavor that complimented the scallops perfectly. You couldn't ask for an easier recipe that will impress your guests. YUM YUM YUM.

Oh. My. God. This was AMAZING. And so easy. I'm teaching myself how to cook more gourmet things, and this is the first time I've seared anything all week without the smoke alarm going off, probably because you only really have to do one thing at a time. I roasted asparagus, kept them in the hot oven with a piece of bread heating, made the sauce, and then made the scallops, and the whole thing just came together beautifully at the end. The sauce is just ORGASMIC. I cut the recipe in half for a quarter of the scallops, and it was awesome, extra sauce left to mop up with good, Italian bread. I took the advice of one of the reviewers and did one part vinegar to two parts wine. I used the only red wine I had on hand, which was a Merlot... not ideal, I know. I can't wait to try this with the Zinfandel... I'm sure it'd be even better. I also cut down on the butter. I had cut it into four pieces (half a stick), and by the third piece, the sauce looked buttery enough. I'm glad I did, because I could really taste the wine flavours. This is going to be my new special occasion dish... and probably fit onto the weekly menu a few times as well!

This was very good, not great. Sauce was delicious, scallops were delicious, but the two together didn't make music. I might try again as a white sauce (white wine, plain rice vinegar), and find another use for the red sauce.

This is a stand by for special dinner or casual dinner as well. I like to serve it over Emperor"s Black rice for a dramatic presentation with fresh spinach puree.

This is my standby for scallops. Always delicious and so easy. Served up with asparagus and mashed potatoes we love it. PS Zinfandel is one of my favorite red wines. Great served with this recipe.

I was expecting a mellow taste; this recipe didn't meet my expectation. Perhaps it has too much butter for my taste. It is quick and easy to prepare, however.

Too much vinegar - the sauce is overpowering! I'd make it again but reduce the vinegar by half or more, and add more wine instead.

I actually haven't made this recipe, but the name peaked my interest. After reading through the recipe, I couldn't help but figuring that the dish would taste much better if the Beurre Rouge were made by fully reducing a full bottle of red wine, then stirring in chunks of butter a little at a time. I have done that method and it was incredible! Keep in mind that fully reducing a full bottle of wine will take about 3 hours, but the taste will be well worth the wait.

It was lovely - goes so well with the rich taste of scallops without being overpowering.

To the Cook in Philadelphia - Zinfandel IS a red wine, and CAN be dry. Many people get Zinfandel confused with White Zinfandel which is a blush wine and very sweet. This recipe is with Beurre Rouge - RED butter, thus the Zinfandel.

Beurre blanc is a sauce made with white wine...so why does the recipe call for Zinfandel or other dry red wine? Zifandel, by the way, is not dry at all, quite the opposite, and would ruin this recipe. It is a lovely dish if made correctly.

Is this really in Bon Appettit Jan. 2000?
