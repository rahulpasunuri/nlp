I doubled the recipe exactly and used a large square loose-bottom tart pan. It was superb. The trick is to line the tart shell with parchment or foil plus pie weights or dried beans and blind bake it completely. Add the asparagus as directed as well as enough custard to come up to the brim. I had enough custard left over to make 3 3" tarts with my leftover dough and asparagus. My guests loved this. If its bland then you haven't seasoned it with salt, pepper and enough fresh tarragon!

Made as written and thought it was kind of boring. If I were to make it again I'd add some of the items mentioned by other reviewers.

I used this as a base recipe, used less asparagus and added roasted red peppers, sundried tomatoes, and some chunks of herbed goat cheese. I substituted fresh mini basil leaves for the tarragon, and baked it in a prebaked frozen tenderflake pie crust (regular not deep dish). It was absolutely delicious with salad for lunch with some friends. I will definately try this one again--original recipe and also variations (I'll be buying some tarragon to try it that way).

To the cook from Phoenix: you should use a tart pan with a removable bottom for this recipe - not a springform pan - and the dough should hold the filling in.

How do you keep the filling from leaking out of a springboard pan? I have 3 springboard pans and each one of them leaked the custard filling out. Thank you so much good cooks!!!

I bought freshly-harvested asparagus and couldn't bear to part with any part of it. In it went. Added a bit of gruyere on top. Fabulous.

Nice easy meal. I used a whole wheat pre-made pie crust so I didn't pre-bake the crust. Otherwise followed it to the letter and it was great. The custard was amazingly light but not terribly rich.

I made this dish for lunch with a salad over the holidays for my family. Everyone loved it. I also added sun dried tomato slices. Fantastic!

This was a winner. I used homemade pastry dough for the crust, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Served a wedge with a small salad as first course for a dinner party of 8. Highly recommended!

I love quiche, asparagus and tarragon, but for some reason this didn't work well. Most likely my fault since I doubled the recipe, added more egg mixture and some nutmeg. I'll try it again and stick to the recipe next time. But I'll probably fall back to my old favorite from this site: Speedy Spinach Quiche (http://food.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=2049).

This is a very easy tasty dish. I used a pre-made Tenderflake pie crust and it was great. The flavors were very nice. It was the first course for my Mother's Day dinner and everyone raved about it. Very good for a potluck. Will make again.

This was fast, easy and delicious! I did make some changes: I did *not* make the pastry crust. I doubled the recipe and put it in a large square pan; I diagonally sliced the asparagus into ~ 1" pieces; I used fat free half and half; I used fresh thyme instead of tarragon, and I sprinkled the top with fresh sun-dried tomato slivers before baking. Cut it into squares for serving.

Wonderful! I used premade 9" pie crusts. After doubling the recipe, the filling was not quite enough to fill 2 crusts. Next time, I'll add another egg and more 1/2 and 1/2.

Made this for Easter & have had it requested several times since. Highly recommed cutting the asparagus into small pieces since it's much easier to cut with your plate on your lap. Also used the dried tarragon and it was a big hit. The tart looked and tasted professional.

Very nice, not so rich as many tarts and the convenience of the ready-made pasty is much appreciated, even for someone who's known for pastry. Didn't like the looks of aspargus filling in between spoke. With 10 pieces, only 3 Weight Watchers points per. Excellent cold.

This has been a stable of mine since it was first printed in the magazine. Like another reviewer, I make it in a 9 inch springform pan. I always use the whole amount of asparagus. In fact, after I've arranged the tips in spokes around the pan, I trim the stem ends and fit them in between the tips so that almost the entire crust is covered with asparagus. I get lots of requests to bring this to parties, and I often bring it on camping trips, and I often serve it at my own parties. I've served it cut into really thin wedges as a party snack, and in thicker wedges with a salad as a light meal. I like it for breakfast! It's just a very good, very easy, very versatile dish.

Very good. Used mixture of flavored parmesan cheese and shredded mozzarella. I think a lb of asparagus is a little much too.

Made the recipe exactly as written with dried tarragon and it was a hit with my brunch guests. Very easy to make and your guests will be impressed as it looks very elegant.

Served this for Mother's Day brunch and received rave reviews from all. Prepared per recipe except I used prepared pie baking shells because of a time crunch.

I cut up the aparagus and used a ready-made crust in foil vice the tart pan. turned out fine, everyone liked it.

Oh yum! This was fantastic - I made it as the first course with lamb & artichokes. I left the salt in, and actually put a little more in that it called for, and it didn't seem salty at all to me (then again, I was using coarse salt, and not regular table salt). I tried using the store-bought pastry shell, and it was next to impossible getting it rolled into the tart pan. Instead, I made the "Flaky Pastry" recipe in my Joy of Cooking book and patted that into the pan. Upon the suggestion of other reviewers, I also cut up the asparagus into smaller pieces, and did not ruin the look of the dish it all. Delicious and great as a first dish/main course at a brunch!

Excellent. I'll definitely make this again. Next time, I'll cut the asparagus into smaller pieces after boiling

I think next time I would use less salt, or no salt too. Other than that, it is easy to make and delicious.

This is a great dish. It is simple to prepare (I've got it down to a science). It is easy to work in other additions like mushrooms, without diminishing the flavor of the tarragon or the asparagus. I've found that I can use it equally well as an entrée or a main dish (can add lardons or some other types of meat -- if not a veggie person). Always well received when I served it at dinner parties.

Nice, easy dish. I left out the salt as advised by the other reviewers, and it tasted fine. Someone requested the recipe. One suggestion: I made it for an informal lunch, a one utensil (fork)affair. It was a bit difficult to deal with the long asparagus. Next time, I will cut the asparagus bite size, scatter it in the crust, and reserve the tips for decoration on top.

Very pretty and easy. Freshly grated parmesan makes it taste fresh and the store-bought crust makes easy. I didn't have a tart pan so I used a 9 inch springform pan and folded the crust with a fork...still looked great!

Easy to make, and very tasty. I used 2% milk instead of cream and it tasted fine - the Parmesan hides any "low-fat" taste! However, I found it too salty, as the Parmesan is a fairly salty cheese. I'd omit the added salt next time, and maybe mix in some ?Gruyere/Ricotta.
