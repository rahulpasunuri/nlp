I'm sorry to say this recipe just didn't work for me. I used two snapper filets but broiling for the specified time didn't cook them so I finished them by sauteeing them. The tomato salad was not exciting. I think it's possible that the filets themselves were not the best. However, with all the great fish recipes out there I will not be making this one again.

I really liked this recipe. I used one large piece of fish (1.25 pounds). I added some diced black olives and topped it off with some thin slices of summer squash. Would definitely make again!

This one got two thumbs down at our house. I thought it a waste of a bunch of good ingredients.

Very Tasty. Used fresh herbs from my garden and heirloom tomatoes....WOW. Very easy to fix also. Will fix again and again.

I've made this receipt a lot over the years, usually when I'm tired but want to eat something healthy. If I'm not eating alone, I use parchiment paper for the sake of presentation. I substitute shallots for red onion and add a dash of red wine vinegar to the "salad." I usually serve it with a wild rice/rice mixture. I always use tomatoes and herbs from the garden, which is probably why it's so good. Obviously, you can use many substitute many different types of fish for the snapper.

This is easy and delicious!

While this was easy and fresh tasting, it was a bit bland for my taste. I felt like it needed another/some more flavor, but I'm not sure what. But, it was easy. Not a keeper for me.

What a delightful and simple way to prepare a visually stunning and delicious entree! Because I wanted to make this a one dish event, I doubled the tomato salad, used a great deal more garlic, added zucchini matchsticks, one Anaheim chili cut into matchsticks, and crookneck squash rounds tossed with a little olive oil. At serving time I sprinkled the tops with minced green onions and a generous squeeze of lime juice. This is easy to prep, very quick to assemble and makes a fabulous summertime dinner. I served mine with a chunky guacamole salad on a bed of baby romaine.

Super easy and very fresh tasting. Excellent summer dish on the grill. Surprisingly, the leftovers were good cold...snapper doesn't usually hold up that way. Finish with a generous squeeze of lemon!

Great recipe! I love the taste of the herbs combined with the tomatoe and the fish. Made it on the BBQ. It is extremely easy and quick. Will make it again!

This was very good and easy to do, but next time, I'd spice it up a little (or as Emeril says, "Kick it up a notch!"). I'll definitely make this again and try it with other fish, too.

Very nice, easy, tasty and healthy too. Now, if I could just find fresh red snapper around here for less than $15 a pond, it would be perfect - but fortunately, sooo many fish, so few meals!!!

Awesome! Definitely a good summer recipe. I added zucchini to my salad and it was great.

Great dish that doesn't take a lot of work. I used a little more garlic than the recipe called for.A must for snapper lovers !!!

The tomato "salad" was terrific, however, I would describe it more as a salsa or chutney. The flavors of this dish came very close to a superlative meal I had in Chateauneuf-du-Pape last month, with one major exception -- the fish; they used an amazing fish called "rouget" (a Mediterranean specialty). Red snapper doesn't even come close. I would try this recipe again with rock shrimp or an oilier, more flavorful fish.

Excellent for a mid-week dinner that's soul-satisfying yet extremely quick and easy.
