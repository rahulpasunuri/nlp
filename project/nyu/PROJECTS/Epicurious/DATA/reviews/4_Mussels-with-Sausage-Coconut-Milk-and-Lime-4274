Great recipe with unusual flavors that marry well together. I made some substitutions-- Used turkey sausage, lemon peel instead of lemongrass, a mixture of equal amounts fennel seed, caraway seed, and cumin as a sub for ground coriander. Also added a medium jalapeño, thinly sliced into rings with the sausage/ginger/garlic sauté. I cut the mussels a bit and added a pound of littleneck clams to the mix. I used the coconut milk/clam juice mixture to cook the shellfish. If you use clams, put them into the pan a few minutes earlier than the mussels, they seemed to take longer to cook. Will definitely make this again!!

This is excellent. Added clams to the mix. Amazingly enough, there were leftovers. Of course, even more flavorful the next day. Great recipe!

Loved the recipe! Maybe I just had enormous mussels, but I only got 1 lb ~20 mussels and that seemed like plenty. My only complaint is that I got rolling on this recipe, and realized they weren't terribly specific about cooking the mussels. I don't cook mussels terribly often, so I was caught a bit off guard by that. Did it really mean to put mussels into a large empty pot?

This came out fabulous!! I did use fish sauce (as another reviewer suggested) in place of the soy sauce and clam juice. A word of caution if choosing to use fish sauce.... start lite and add more to taste as it may get too salty rather quickly.

DOUBLE WOW - really terrific, very impressive, can't fail. A couple of modifications still make it great: Sausages - can use spicey, sweet w/added red pepper flakes, can use pepperoni, tasso, chorizo or any type of sausage - if they're not hot, add the red pepper flakes. Instead of soy sauce I added to the authenticity by using Nampla - Asian fish sauce. I didn't have coriander powder, so I approximated it by combining cumin, carraway, cardamon & fennel (found it on wiki). Couldn't get fresh lemon grass but you can buy a really true lemon grass paste in the supermarket veg dept, and keep it in the fridge/freezer for times like this. Don't scrimp on the lime juice.Lastly, I used a little of the clam juice to steam the mussels and then added the sausage coconut mix into the pot after they were steamed.

WOW! This is a wonderful recipe. It was prepared exactly as written...no substitutions. The flavors were beautifully balanced.

Great flavor and simple to prepare. I just cooked the sausage and added coconut milk and curry paste and all the other liquids called for. Came out awesome and went well with the mussels

This was really very good. All the flavors mix together and compliment each other very well. I didn't have lemongrass, so I just used some lemonjuice and it seemed to work fine. I also put it a bit extra cilantro. We weren't sure it was great over mussels, but maybe if you steamed the mussels in the sauce before serving, instead of just cooking them plain. Also, as another commented, it was even better the second day - when we just had it over rice. In the future, I'd add extra sausage and just serve it over rice.

We enjoyed this more the second daye after the flavors had a chance to meld. The mussels with tomatoes and jalapenos and tequilla (also in epicurious) is a more flavorful recipe. Can't find lemongrass? No worries. Just omit it or use some lemon zest. We also used turkey hot sausage and that worked out well. You definitely need bread to sop up the juices.

This was an easy and elegant mussel dish. My boyfriend and I loved the flavor combinations. I must admit I used some of the sauce to cook the mussels (the recipe did not specify what liquid to use to steam them) and then added it back to the main dish. I also forgot to add the soy sauce, but I hardly missed it with all of the other wonderful flavors melding on our tongues. We will add this to our regular repertoire of mussel dishes.

This has become one of my absolute favorite dishes, with a sauce so good that my other half (who professes to hate mussels) is always ever too ready to dip into the sauce with a piece of French bread. I think the confluence of the spicy sausage with the cooling coconut milk is the key to this recipe's success.

I have made this several times and love the combination of mussles and spicy sausage. As other readers said, be sure to have some good bread to dunk. Yummy!

Good but not spectacular. I used chicken andouille sausage, which might have been better if spicier. Next time I think I will add a chili or two. The French bread went well with it, as suggested.

I was suspicious of the hot sausage at first, but the flavors really come together. Make sure to have good bread at hand, because you will want to get every drop of the sauce (I ended up eating it with a spoon..).

We made this dish directly after having it at Salamander and it really is a terrific first course! It's easy to make too.

This recipe is wonderful. I could't find lemongrass the second time and it might have even been better.
