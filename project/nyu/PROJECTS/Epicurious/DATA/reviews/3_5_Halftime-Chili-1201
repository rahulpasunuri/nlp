I first tried this recipe a few years ago. At first I made it as written, then began to tweak it based on the reviews of others. I recently won a chili cook-off with my version: 2 lbs meat, 2 cans beans (plain), 3 tbsp chili powder (combination of regular, ancho, chipotle, sweet and hot paprikas), 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tbsp cocoa, and beef broth instead of chicken. Whether you make it as written or with my changes, it is sure to be a hit.

When turkey is substituted for the beef, and a darker beer is used, it was a hearty-tasting and full-bodied chili.

Great chili recipe! My husband doesn't like a lot of beans in his chili, so this recipe was a big hit. I also added a jalapeno to give it some heat.

I added extra oregano and used brown ale as my bottled beer. It turned out great. I served it over a baked potato. I highly recommend this recipe.

Beer! Why have I not tried this before? Loved the spice blend and added a few that were not called for, ground chipotle, cinnamon and a bit of brown sugar. Used a medium ground beef as well as two spicy store made sausage which I cooked sliced and added to the pot, also added whole button mushrooms. Mine was a little spicy but after adding the toppings of sour cream, green onion, cilantro & cheese it was perfect.

This chill was very easy to make - I found that I also had most of the ingredients on hand which was great. I took another reviewer's suggestion and added 1/4 cup water mixed with 1 tbsp flour to thicken it up. I also added mushrooms when sautéing the onions at the beginning. As many suggested, I added cinnamon. Made a great make-ahead weeknight dinner! My boyfriend loved it and it was perfect for a cold winter night.

Great Chili. I substitute bison for ground beef for a lower fat version. And to give it a kick and a little more flavor, I add tobasco sauce. Also, this recipe doesn't call for salt. It needs salt. A teaspoon of kosher salt does the trick without adding too much sodium.

Tastes great. Very similar to the one i makke, but what i add is baja chili seasoning and it just gives it that kick. Bajachili.com. Also, try adding a half an orange to the pot. Very tasty!

This is a family favorite. I've made it several times and it is always a winner. My only changes are to substitute lean (94%) ground turkey for the ground chuck and add an extra can of beans. It is always better when reheated, but no one wants to wait a day to eat it!

Rating: 4
I'm sure it would be delicious as is, but I added 1 super large chopped green pepper; 1 tbsp brown sugar; used beef broth instead of chicken broth; and instead of 5 tbsp chili powder, I replaced that with 1 1/2 tbsp ancho chili powder + 1 1/2 tbsp chipotle pepper + 2 tbsp chili powder (still 5 tbsp total). This was exceptional!

Rating: 4
I'm not sure how I never got around to reviewing this recipe - it's spectacular. I've made it both as is and with changes. Those changes I did make were based on other reviewer suggestions and made for such a wonderful chili (for the most part, though, the bones of the recipe are the same and are what make this as exceptional as it is). To note: I used a can a Guinness, doubled the cumin and used a mixture of various chili powders, added an ounce or so of mexican chocolate, an extra dash of cinnamon, and a couple tablespoons of instant espresso powder. I also used a combination of ground chuck and buffalo meat. The chili was R i c h , for sure, but so worth the extra time on the treadmill the next day. I've made this several times, and always had luck with freezing and reheating the leftovers (if there are any). I proved my boyfriend wrong: girls, not just boys, actually can make a kick-ass chili.

Rating: 4
This recipe never fails! A few tips from making it over the years: I add chopped green and red pepper with the onions and garlic in the beginning. Also, once it is all finished, I make a 1/4 cup slurry of water and flour (preferably Masa flour - well worth buying!).. I mix the slurry in at the very end to the chili.. it adds amazing body, thickness and a truly distinctive "mexican" taste to it... Try it! And finally, if you can... make it a day before.. freeze it.. then reheat for your guests the next day...

Chili turned out great! I usually read all of the reviews, but was in a hurry, so did not incorporate anyone else's advice. I drained the meat and it wasn't greasy at all. I couldn't locate "prepared chili beans" so used black beans. After eating it and now reading the reviews, I would add another can of beans, and I'd try the chocolate, cinnamon and adding some heat. I'd also try mixing the meats. But it was also delicious as is. I will definitely make again.

Rating: 3
Great chili base as other reviewers have noted. I had a dried ancho chili from ages ago that I rehydrated and then pureed and added to the mix, which gave it a nice bit of extra heat, and it could have even more. It did turn out a bit greasy although I watched it the whole time for fat available to skim off. Will definitely make this again, next time with a serrano or two added.

The quintessential chili recipe. I added a little bit of chipotle powder in addition to the regular chili powder, and for the beer I used an oatmeal stout, which I think added great depth of flavor. Definitely delicious and crowd-pleasing.

This has become my go to chili recipe. Like previous reviewer I add a square of bitter-sweet chocolate. Also if we've had ham and I'm looking to use the bone I'll boil that down instead of the chicken broth then chop the ham off the bone and add that as well! Great make ahead weekday recipe.

This was my first time making chili, and it was perfect for Super Bowl Sunday. Like similar reviews I used 1lb Turkey, 1lb Buffalo & 1lb spicey Italian sausage. I also used 1 tablespoon of cocoa powder. In addition to the chili beans, I added a can of black beans (rinsed).

Made this last weekend. Great texture. Took many other reviewers advice and only used 2lbs beef and an extra can of beans. Skimmed off lots of fat, added brown sugar, cocoa powder, cayenne pepper, more cumin and more chili powder. Great base, just needed a little amping up!

I've found the perfect chili! This had just the right balance of acidity and sweetness. I ran out of regular chili powder, so I used 1 1/2 tbls. of ancho chili powder, which added just a touch of sweetness and smokiness. Other than the chili powder I didn't alter the recipe at all and I don't think I will. This will be my "go to" recipe. Nothing like a bowl of chili on a rainy day. It's been raining for the last 3 days, and I'm happy...just me, my dog and my bowl of chili!

I'm not sure I could duplicate what I put in this chili if I tried. I read a number of the reviews and incorporated those additions/ deletions I thought I would like. Added ancho chili and chipotle pepper, less regular chili powder,a little paprika and cinnamon. Used a mixture of turkey, italian sausages and beef and Guiness stout beer. Drained the meat after sauteeing. The end result: the best chili I've ever eaten. Now, need to remember what I did!

Rating: 4
I have made this several times, I usually use a combination of ground turkey and extra lean ground angus to lighten it up a bit. I use whatever beer I have kicking around but prefer a dark (like Guiness) if possible. I dont use quite as much chili powder as indicated to keep it palatable to my 12 yr old but put red chilis on the table for those who want to spice it up. I also add a tbsp of cocoa powder for some richness. It's delicious served over rice and topped with cheddar, chopped scallions and sour cream.

Delicious. I used ground elk instead of beef, as I took a bull during the rut this year. I doubled the cumin, threw in a teaspoon of cayenne, and also roasted and reconstituted 6 chile guajillo. I blended to a puree' with enough of the reconstitution liquid and added when putting in the spices. It added a nice smoky flavor, as well as a touch of gentle heat.

I have been making this chili for years. It reminds me of bitter cold winter days in the Midwest and my mom had big pot of the "good stuff" on the stove. Delicious....I always add more beans, black, kidney and pinto as well as bitter sweet chocolate, hint of cinnamon a half tablespoon of good cayenne and serve with all kinds of toppings: avocado, rice, fritos, grated cheddar, sour cream and raw onion. Really fun party thing if you do the "Frito Pie" and give everyone there own bag of Fritos to dish it up! Of course, they must have run a half-marathon first to burn off the calories before hand!

This is a staple in my house, made with just a few changes. I usually use a little less beef and add one more can of beans. I like things spicy, so always add considerably more chili powder, a little cayenne and some more cumin.

This is the best chili I have ever served. I made an enormous batch to serve at an open house attended by 60 people and it was a hit. I added some chipotle in adobo as other reviewers have suggested and it added a nice smoky heat. I did not use all the chicken stock called for, so had no problem with the dish being too juicy. Alongside the chili I offered chopped green onions, sour cream, shredded cheddar, chopped red onions, two kinds of hot sauce, and a batch of hot dogs & buns for those who wanted a chili dog. My best move: I made it a couple of days ahead of time and stashed it in the refrigerator, so the flavors could meld. Wow!

Made this for a dinner party and it was a huge hit. Per other reviews, I added a bar of dark chocolate, did a mix of sausage and ground beef and also threw in some chiles in adobo sauce. The flavor was both complex and comforting -- exactly what I want in a chili.

Rating: 3
i give this recipe 3 forks, but with a few quick changes it is truly an amazing four-fork recipe! First, there is too much liquid. Think about it, the recipe calls for 3lbs of meat but 60+ ounces of liquid. The way to fix this is to use 4 lbs of meat. I used: 2 lbs ground beef, 1 lb spicy italian sausage, and 1 lb sweet italian sausage. Second, add chipotle peppers in adobo sauce to the recipe. They are AWESOME and really give the chili a nice flavor. Just take them out of the can and chop them up. Third, skip the basil and thyme. I agree with another cook that this isn't pasta sauce! Next, 14 ounces of chicken broth is just too much liquid. I bought one of those small 8 ounce boxes of beef broth and used about half of it. I loved the beer. I used one bottle of smutynose pale ale. at first, i tried it and thought, oh no i ruined the recipe. but once it all simmers together for a few hours, the alcohol simmers out and you have a really nice flavor. which brings me to my last suggestion. you should really plan to cook this for a few hours. i started making at at 4pm and we ate at 9/930 pm. I would cook it for ~2hours on a medium flame and then just turn it down to low with a lid half-covered the pot so that it slowly stews and bubbles. This turned out to be a truly excellent dish. My guests were wowed. Top it with avocados in lemon, chopped scallion, cheddar, and sour cream.

I found this recipe to be OK as is. I thought it was too bland, had too much meat, and was too greasy. After adding cayenne pepper, cumin, a touch of cinnamon, a splash of red wine, and extra beans, it was very tasty. Chili is such a subjective thing, it's hard to find something to please everyone. This is a great starter recipe if you're prepared to alter it to your taste.

I have been making chili for years but when given the task of chili for my boss's tailgate party I wanted to make something special. I read most of the reviews here and took many of the suggestions including the doubling of the spices, the addition of bittersweet chocolate, cinnamon and Guinness stout. I omitted the thyme added a can of Rotel tomatoes and 3 heaping T of Goya Sofrito. I think one of the reasons people think this recipe is soupy is that they don't drain off the water and fat after having sauted the meat because it isn't written into the recipe!! I had no excess volume and found this recipe to be excellent...not a drop left! Everyone asked for the recipe and wanted to know the combination of spices!! 4 forks! Excellent

It came out perfect. I am a wisconsin boy and this chili lived up to expectations.

Easy to follow recipe. Not bad chili, but there was WAY too much liquid in the pot at the end of cooking time that had to be strained off (thereby taking some of the seasoning with it too). I would try adding some chicken boulloin powder or a cube next time instead of actual broth to cut down on the liquid content.

Rating: 3
Great basic recipe. I like to add a finely chopped chipotle chili...gives a nice smoky taste, and 2 Tbs of masa corn meal (or stone ground if no masa). It thickens it just a tiny bit (some readers complained about it being too brothy) and adds another layer of background flavor that just seems "right" .

I've not had luck until this recipe to make a tasty, hearty chili. This worked very well. Per another raters input, I did not include the basil, oregano or thyme. I used 2 15 oz cans of beans: one of pinto beans and one of kidney beans, and cooked for the entire cooking time. I also had some homemade adobo sauce, and added some of that. I used a high grade chili powder. Overall, it was very tasty. Sprinkled some cheese over dish, as well as some raw chopped sweet onions. This is a winner, and one to add to my "cook book"

Really great chili. Made it with 2 lbs. ground turkey and 1-1/4 lb. turkey Italian sausage. Used 2 cans of black beans, added 1/2 can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, threw in a can of black olives and used a pale ale for the beer. Nice kick!!! You can certainly use all the chipotle if you like more heat. Started it on the stove in the morning then into the crockpot to simmer for the rest of the day.

Great, simple chili recipe! I have made this twice during the last month, and I think it's a great meal to have on hand during the hectic holiday season when kids are coming home from college, etc. A couple of tips: First, use Grandma's Zesty Chili Powder. It has more kick than other brands. Second, I added two cans of beans -- specifically S&W Chili Beans seasoned with chipotles. The smoky chipotle flavoring really makes a difference. I also added the beans earlier, allowing them to simmer for an hour with the chili. One more thing: Skip the basil and thyme -- this is chili, not spaghetti sauce!

Definitely a 'solid' chili recipe. I made it in a slow cooker and made some adjustments per the reviews I read. I cooked up the onions, garlic and beef in a fry pan and then put into the slow cooker. I added the called for ingredients to the slow cooker, except for the tomato paste (didn't have any) and kidney beans. I also added 1 chopped jalapeno pepper, 1/2 chopped red pepper and 1/2 chopped green pepper and some cayenne pepper (probably a teaspoon or 2). The chili cooked for about 5 hours and then I added the rinsed kidney beans and in lieu of the tomato paste I didn't have, I added a few tablespoons of cornmeal per another reviewers suggestion. It came out with a nice, thick, smooth consistency with just the right amount of kick! If I were to make it for company, I would definitely cook it up a day ahead, as again, it was much more flavorful on days 2 and 3.

This is definitely a 'solid' chili recipe, and like some reviewers mentioned, definitely tastier day 2 and 3. I made it in the slow cooker and also made some adjustments. I sauteed the onions and garlic in a fry pan for the 8 minutes and then added the beef and browned. I then dumped that in the slow cooker with the rest of the ingredients, except for the tomato paste (didn't have any) and kidney beans. In addition to the the called for ingredients, I added 1 chopped jalapeno, a chopped red and green pepper and some (dried) cayenne pepper. After slow cooking for about 5 hours, I added the (rinsed) kidney beans and in lieu of the tomato paste that I didn't have, I added a few tablespoons of corn meal to thicken per another reviewers suggestion. It had a nice thick, smooth consistency. And the jalapeno and cayenne gave it a nice kick (but not too hot).

I made this for a party and the little left over I sadly gave away because it was so popular. I used a dark beer, added cinnamon, a handful of semi-sweet chocolate chips and an extra can of beans. This simmered on low heat for a couple hours on the stove, which helped bring the flavors together.

I did take others' advice and add a few spices (1 chopped green pepper, one chopped red pepper, 1T Worcestershire, a few dashes of cayenne) and it is delicious!

This chili makes an excellent base for tweaking. Along with the onion, I add hot and bell peppers, and then I go nuts with the seasonings. Along with the spices listed, I also add chocolate, other herbs and spices, ketchup, mustard, L&P worcestershire sauce, molasses, lemon juice, whatever strikes my fancy. The fun part is tasting between seasoning rounds, until you end up with a very rich nicely melded flavor. My husband loves this, and it freezes beautifully in individual portions for quick dinners and lunch variety at work. The flavor may even improve during freezing! This chili is definitely worth making - get creative!

I have made this chili several times. The title is appropriate as I have made it for the past 2 years for the Superbowl. It is the best chili recipe I have come across! My kids even like it because it has more meat than beans. The flavor is rich and hearty. It freezes well -- does lose a little flavor but not so bad. Definitely make it a day ahead as the flavor is more intense after a day in the fridge. I serve it with bread or tortilla chips. The toppings my family chooses are sour cream and cheddar cheese. It does not even need these but they enjoy it. Love to serve this in the middle of the winter to warm everyone up! I am not a chili fan but even I enjoy eating this delicious meal!! So go ahead and make yourself a bowl!!!

I don't know what I did, but I ended up with way too much liquid for the amount of meat. I double checked my amounts and I used the crushed tomatoes, but I still got soup. I cooked it down for about 1 hour 40 minutes and got it more the consistency we like -- a heartier chili, but still not as hearty as I would have liked. Next time I would increase the meat or decrease the liquid -- but not the beer! The smell of the chili cooking with that bottle of beer was amazing. It's not extremely spicy, so my husband added some Tabasco and some cayenne pepper. Once we made those changes we really enjoyed our meal. I will make again, but with my modifications.

I made w/o the onions because a friend can't stand them and they weren't missed although I'm sure it's better with them. Not spicy enough for me and most spice-lovers, so serve with jalapenos and hot sauce on the side. I agree with the other reviewer that the tomatoes with puree and the chili powder make this recipe; I used a dark beer and thought that also really upped the flavor. Final note: I used turkey instead of beef and no one was the wiser -- it was half the price of the beef and even my meat-loving boyfriend agreed the turkey meat tastes better; it's kind of a no-brainer in my book since you win on price, calories AND taste.

I have been making this chili for years. It is fantastic and I have to print the recipe for company everytime I serve it. I use 1 1/2 pounds of lean (7% fat) ground beef instead of 3 pounds chuck; I use a handful each of chopped fresh herbs instead of the dry listed; I use bottled, dark beer for a richer beer taste; and, I serve it in sourdough bread bowls (cut off the tops of mini rounds and serve the tops in chunks for dipping--YUM!). For those of you who thought this recipe was bland, be sure to use crushed tomatoes with puree ONLY. I've known people to use diced tomatoes, not realizing there is a HUGE difference. Also, don't be afraid to use the entire 5 TBL of chili powder. The sweetness of the pureed tomatoes offsets the heat.

I made this for the halftime of the Patriot's game this past weekend. What a treat! There were no leftovers. I served jalepeno peppers on the side so that each person could control their own "hotness". My teenagers enjoyed this as well. I am looking forward to making this again this weekend for the next playoff game.

Good base recipe. Here's what I did: Substitute 1 pound ground buffalo, 1/2 pound ground turkey, and 1 pound ground chicken sausage for the meat. Substitute anaheims for the Jalapenos. Also, I used all organic ingredients. Makes great Chili Con Queso by adding cheese cubes to leftovers and serving with tortilla chips. Add leftover baked potatoes and nestle in flour tortillas for great burritos.

This chili was so boring. I can't believe how many people loved it. Like other reviewers I had to add worcestershire, cayenne pepper, tabasco and double all the spices to make it taste like chili instead of just meat. I guess this provides a decent base as long as you taste and modify to your liking. I'm giving a low rating because the recipe, on its own, is not good.

I will definetly make this recipe again. the only problem I had was I added hot chili powder, and it was a little too hot for me. I also took the adivce of others and added some semi sweet chocolate and a pinch of cinnamon, nice touch! Does anyone know if there is anything I could add to get rid of some the heat from the hot chili powder?

Very good chili. Like the combination of flavours. I added extra chili flakes near the end as I guess my chili powder isn't very spicy. (don't worry, you can't taste the beer, but, it must add some complexity to the overall flavour)

I liked the chili but I changed the meat. I used a thigh from a turkey without the skin and grounded it up with my food processor. This way I had control over what is in it. Using thighs is dark meat so you think its hamburger when actually its turkey.

Had a great time working with this chili - and it turned out GREAT!!! I used extra-lean ground turkey to save on fat - also, added some pure maple syrup - as well as L&P - doubled the spices - this was damn good chili - My friends loved it - and it's even better the next day. (I got up in the middle of the night to finish it off) - looking forward to making it again!

I have to agree with the people that said it was more of a base for chili than anything. It was excellent!!! I added a lot more of the spices except chili powder. I also added some Lea & Perrins, tabasco, cayenne pepper and some cinnamon and since i didn't have any semi sweet chocolate, i threw in some hersheys syrup...couldn't tell the difference. I will definitly make this one again!!!!

This is a great CHILI, it is quick and easy to make. I added green bell peppers and only used 1 1/2 lbs. of ground meat. I would absolutley make this again. It was a big hit, we had it for left overs the next night (it was even better then)and the night after that we used it for Chili Dogs.....yum!

A fine chili standard. We used it as a guideline and made alterations based on some earlier reviews. The result was a super meaty and rich chili that we could NOT stop eating--despite our bulging and aching bellies. Must have been under some kind of voodoo chili spell or something. Anyway, to avoid bitterness, we did add a 12 oz. bottle of amber ale (homebrewed) and then put three Hershey's Special Dark Miniatures in it. I think this is what "made" the chili for us. The stuff was gooood. However, prior to putting the chili in our bowls, we tasted it and felt it did need quite a bit more cumin and chili powder. Also put a tiny bit of *cinnamon* in it, which is a nice earthy spice. Like I said, we came up with something that really worked for us. I can safely say it was the best chili I had in my life. We got it just right by tasting it before serving. I highly encourage a TASTE TEST. So use this recipe as a sketch...fill in the details however you want. Good luck!

Rating: 4
as is, the recipe is bland, boring and bitter. To make it outstanding, do the following: double up on the spices, except for the chili powder, about 1 to 2 tbsp of krazy salt or montral steak seasoning for salt & pepper, couple squirts of ketchup, some tabasco, and most importantly, about 2 -3 tbsp of lea & perrin's. the ketchup and l&p is the most important thing the recipe lacks. This is a great meaty chili.

We thought this was a good chili recipe. Instead of beer I used hard apple cider, only because I am gluten intollerant and can't have beer. The chili tasted good without being bitter. Maybe because the apple cider is a little sweeter than beer? Added some jalapenos and 2 t. powdered chocolate as earlier reviewers had suggested. Would make again - can't wait until tonight to have a bowl!

Quite good with a few modifications.... I roasted the chuck roast in the oven for almost 2 hours and shredded it (YUMMY!) I also took the other suggestions and added double the spices (expect for the chili powder), a 14 oz can of Guiness, some of the beef broth from roasting my meat, 2 pablano chilis, a jalepeno pepper, 2 miniture snicker bars (for the chocolate....a hint I got from a friend), a dash of cinnamon, and a can of corn added at the end with my beans.

Great warming winter meal and even better the next day. I followed some of the other suggestions, doubled the spices, used a light coloured beer, and dropped in 2 ounces of semi-sweet chocolate (I also threw everything in a slowcooker and went shopping - it was just that tough to make). My fiancé loved it and ate it for 4 days in a row (pity me, please). I served it with a crusty bread and haven't been hungry since Saturday. I thought the spice was a little over the top, and would probably not double it entirely - but I will make it again once our house airs out.

This was great chili....and so easy! I followed the recipe with the following changes..used twice the amount of chili powder, kept the rest of the spices the same; used canned tomatoes with jalapenos and canned pinto beans with jalapenos; added 2 oz. Mexican chocolate and 1 T. cane sugar; cooked it for 2 hours covered, 1 hour uncovered. One of my guests said "Best chili I ever ate." What more could a hostess want!

Rating: 3
This was a simple recipe that did not create a huge mess in the kitchen. However, since this chili needs to simmer for quite a while, I would not recommend starting it at 7 p.m., which is what I did. The end product did lack robust flavor, but over all a good recipe.

Bland, bland, bland, bland, bland, bland......and did I mention "bland"? For all the effort and the number of ingredients, this was truly nasty stuff. Don't waste your time - there are MUCH better chili recipes out there. Although, you wouldn't have to go far to be much better than this stuff. Even doubling & trebling the spices and garlic didn't seem to help, nor did letting it set a day or two to let flavours meld, since chili often is better the second day. Yuck.

How dare you make fun of our eloquent, rocket-scientist President! Oh, sorry, this is a recipe review site so I'll comment on my chili. It tasted okay, but it was pretty run-of-the-mill. It lacked a certain depth. Next time I'll try out some of the suggested additions (ancho, chipotle, etc.).

Oh dear me. Arlington needs to learn her manners or go back to the barn. Northerners, please don't think she is representative of the geographic South (texas is not even). I hope she is not representative of Texas-who name calls in complete public? Anyway, if you are an experienced cook and are familiar with the genre and ingredients, then yes, it is possible to look at a recipe and have an idea what it will taste like. I use another BA recipe, Turkey Poblano Chili, which is very similar--uses chocolate.

Rating: 0
Yum! I did alter the recipe a bit (with profuse apologies to Arlington), so I didn't rate it: used hot Italian sausage, crumbled, in place of half the ground chuck. Threw in several canned chipotle chiles and one cayenne pepper for heat, along with 2 tablespoons of ancho chile powder for a bit of smoky-sweetness. I may be just an ignorant northerner who doesn't know squat about chili, and I may not have followed the recipe exactly (after all, recipes are meant to be a starting point, not a straitjacket), but Arlington will be relieved to know that my chili didn't turn out tasting "like hell."

Rating: 3
Mmm mmm, chili! This was a great recipe. Thanks to the previous reviewer who suggested the Poblano pepper--they grow us Michiganders purty smart. Although, after reading some of the more rabid reviews about this recipe, I was a little nervous standing over the stove preparing it--I kept hearing Arlington coming up behind me, ready to bop me on the head with a wooden spoon if I showed any signs of using up the random vegetables in my refrigerator to make a chili. To feel safe, I stuck exactly with the recipe as dictated by Arlington, since she loved it so much and so did her husband, and this morning I threw away all my extra veggies. I'm such a sloppy excuse for a woman.

After searching and searching for a great chili recipe, I have found the perfect one. This is a great recipe.

Top with chopped green onions, shredded cheddar and a dollop of sour cream (bottle of Tabasco on the side for me!)

A very good basic chili recipe. I made it according to the recipe, but the next time I would add some sauteed peppers and an extra 1 or even 2 cans of beans. I wasn't crazy about the texture - it's a bit soupy and is mostly meat, and I like a toothier chili with more vegetables and beans. However, the flavor is excellent.

Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. I followed the suggestions listed and had a wonderful meal. I tripled the recipe because I had a housefull of beer drinking buddies come over for the game. Our wives, however, did not bitch and complain about the smell of onions! I don't think that women should be allowed to complain about the smell of anything! Back to the chili, I always serve chili with fritos on top and sour cream. That is my ONLY suggestion, other than the guy below should tell his old lady to put a sock in it the next time she bitches about the smell of cooked onions! I'd make it a dirty sock at that! Well, thanks epicurious for the recipe...now I've got to get back to the game and the beer! Go Team!!!!

I stuck with the recipe for the most part with a few exceptions, I used 2lbs of ground beef and 1 lb of ground pork. Used guiness beer (as suggested). Doubled the spices (as suggested). Added 1 can of kidney beans (as suggested). After cooking I still thought that it was missing something. (It was bland) I looked at some other recipes for chili and noticed that some of them used ketchup. I added about a 1/2 cup of ketchup(to taste, really) and that just set the whole thing off! I guess that's why some people had added the chocolate (which I didn't have). It needed something to sweeten it up. This is a really great chili recipe and I will be making it again. Probably won't saute the onions and garlic next time so I won't have to listen to my wife complain about (the aroma)! Highly recommend using either ketchup, chocolate or even sugar to sweeten! I spiced my bowl up with jalapenos and Tabasco! Very nice for a cold rainy weekend.

Wonderful! The flavors of this chili were outstanding, particularly with the addition of a pint of Guinness (which I highly recommend as it gives the chili a deep color and flavor). I served mine with homemade cornbread and a choice of toppings: grated sharp cheddar, homemade tortilla strips, real bacon bits, sour cream, and green onions...a dream buffet! Next time, I may add some stew meat or sausages for more meatiness. Perfect for Superbowl! YUMMY!!

Following the suggestions of other reviewers I added a bit of unsweetened chocolate, increased the amount of chili powder to taste, and added a touch of cayenne. I sub'ed turkey for the beef and added an extra can of beans. This chili is rich and complex tasting and was a big hit with friends. I highly recommend it!

This is a terrific basic recipe, and the advice of adding chocolate, cinnamon and beer put it clearly over the edge and made it very authentic-tasting. Oh, and good chili powder makes all of the difference. As with any recipe, you need to TASTE your food as you are cooking it, to make sure it comes out the way YOU like it. I have been using this website regularly for over 5 years and I will still marvel at people who say the recipe was bland, etc. Recipes are a suggestion for starting point for many of us, and, as pointed out, chili (like tiramisu) is completely interpretive...that's what makes it so great!

I 'm thrilled to be able to contribute my standard chili-making tip to this recipe - a suggestion not seen in NINE pages of rave reviews. To enchance the texture of your dish, buy whole pieces of meats ( sirloin, boneless pork, turkey breast fillets), and partially freeze (or partially defrost) them. Cut into strips, then feed into your Cuisinart's slicing disc. Saves time if cooking for a large crowd, so much more interesting than ground meat. Followed the bulk of previous reviewers' suggestions, adding spices, quality beer, chocolate and cinammon. My son's college dorm friends asked if they could move in for the rest of the semester and have this chili every night.

We loved this recipe but made it even tastier by adding a few more tblspns. chili powder, an extra can of beans and used a dark micro brew.

Enjoyed this, but didn't think it was stupendous. Considering the variety of flavors that go into it, would have expected it to pack more punch.

To the cook from Arlington - chocolate is often added to southwestern and Mexican dishes. There is something magical about the heat and sweet (although I prefer to use unsweetened chocolate or cocoa powder). This chili recipe - or my version of it - has become a staple in my home. As recommended, I doubled all spices from cumin to thyme. I also add 3 cans of beans and cut the meat down to 1 lb. Personally I don't like the taste of a dark or stout beer in it, but that's just me. I use Corona and throw in a tablespoon or 2 of cocoa powder.

For anyone who thinks this chili is bland - BUY BETTER CHILI POWDER. I made this last weekend for a chili cookoff and used 2 tbsp cayenne, 2 tbsp chile de arbol & 1 tbsp pasilla chili and it was anything but bland, in fact it was the unanimous winner. As recommended, I used a bottle of Guinness and 2 oz semisweet chocolate - best chili ever!!!

SO, not all was lost by trying this one.

This was my first stab at homemade chili. I read all the reviews before attempting it, as this is for a potluck gathering at work. Initially, I too, thought it came out a little bland, following the recipe to the letter, but rather than double the spices, I added some tiny pearl-sized chilies I got from Texas--only 10, mashed up with a spoon, and that turned the dish into a five-alarm mixure. Does anyone know what kind of chilies they might be? They are red and about the size of pearls.

I have made this recipe with success. Chocolate and dash of cinnamon can be added to give it some depth..(mole) I use chili powder from New Mexico which gives it the kick that it is lacking. Try adding some cayenne if your chili powder is lacking. Also make sure to add a beer with some flavor...not a Bud Light. I have also made a variation adding a can of pumpkin for a fall treat...the hot & sweet is a nice combo.

I can't say I'm thrilled with this chili recipe. I followed many of the reviewers suggestions (doubling some of the seasonings, adding chocolate), and also substituted some of the meat for additional beans, as I prefer an equal meat to bean ratio. The end result was spicy, which I have no problem with, but it was also decidedly harsh tasting, which I did not enjoy. I'm hoping that the flavours will mellow a bit if it sits for a day or two, but at the moment, I'm not impressed. Maybe its the fault of brand of chili powder I'm using - any other suggestion for what went wrong?

I made this recipe for my family as well as my neighbor's expecting rave reviews. Unfortunately, neither my family nor my nieghbors liked it.

I made this the night before with the suggested changes -- namely doubling the spices, Guinness Extra Stout for the beer, 2 oz. semi-sweet chocolate (I'll probably use unsweetened next time), and cinnamon (I used 1 tsp., but next time I'll use a 1/2 tsp.) I also suggest increasing the diced tomatoes by an extra 14.5 oz. can (I used roasted garlice flavor tomatoes). I, too, used more beans--one can of Bush's mild chili beans and one can of Ranch Style black beans w/ jalopenos. Everyone raved about it and it was all gone, but it didn't win. I really liked it and plan on making it again and again, maybe for next weekend's camping trip.

Because my girlfried doesn't eat red meat, I used ground turkey. I also made some other changers that I highly recomend. Mix up the beans some: whatever you like. If you use ground poultry, use some hot italian sausage to make up for some of the lost flavor. You can never go wrong with more cumin. This was a very good base recipe to use your own creativity.

Seems like there are two side to the fence on this recipe - you either love it or are very dissapointed. We loved it. I think it depends alot on the chili powder you use. It does take about 2-3 hours to simmer. We doubled the spices, added unsweetened chocolate and used a can of Guinness. There were no leftovers!

I like my chili to have a rich, complex flavor & this recipe didn't provide it. The leftovers were no better, either. I should have heeded the others' advice & added chocolate.

I was doubtful that a Californian knew about chili, after having studied the subject at length in Texas. However, this is excellent chili, even if it does have beans! The only thing I did differently than the recipe as written was to cut a chuck roast into 1/4-1/2 inch cubes to avoid all the fat in ground chuck. It did take about 2 to 2 1/4 hours of simmering to get my desired consistency. I also made it a day before use to let it all meld together. Truly an excellent recipe. Addendum: I have made this recipe three times now and the spiciness of the chili beans make all the difference in how much extra spice needs to be added. Bush's spicy was the best and Brook's mild the worst.

Excellent mild meaty chili that was a hit at a local chili cookoff. The only change I made was to add a bit more garlic and a tiny bit of red pepper sauce. Very popular with the "fewer beans the better" crowd.

Made this Saturday, and served it on Sunday. I highly recommend making the chili a day in advance, as I believe a night in the fridge really allows the flavors to mellow and marry. I incorporated all the recommendations (1/2 beef, 1/2 pork, dark beer, chocolate, cinnimon, doubling of herbs, and two cans of beans). I used the 5T of chili powder as written in the recipe. It was PLENTY, and I like spicy food. I think this may have to do with the brand of chili powder being used and the freshness. I had a brand new bottle of "Medium" from Penzy's Spices. Anyway, I recommend starting with the prescribed 5, and adding more only if necessary.

This is good stuff if you are looking for a mild but very tasty chili. You need to add the cinnamon and chocolate according to previous viewers, as well as dark beer. You also need to double up on the spices. I did this for my youth group, and they loved it. The alcohol burned off so they didn't know it. It was quite tasty! Not very spicy though so you can definately kick it up with some peppers of your choice. This is something you should really try.

The beer in the recipe really gave a strong overwhelming flavor to our chili, so I hate to say it, but maybe had I used a "light" beer, I would have liked this better.

Followed the directions with 1/2 beef, pork and hot Italian sausage. Did add the guiness, Scharfenberger chocolate and cinnamon. Did a can of black beans, chipotle beans and pinto beans. Also did three kinds of chili powder...Chipotle, New Mexico and San Antonio. Boy was this a good one!

Excellent chili recipe! I used ground turkey instead of chuck and a can of bud light (gasp!), along with fresh herbs and both light and dark kidney beans (2 cans total). I put the herbs in after the simmering step was complete. The beer adds a nice flavor.

Next time I'll follow the recipe more closely. I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and doubled the spices and added chocolate. It was delicious, but a little too rich.

Except for the chicken broth and beer (I'll have to try that next time) these are the chili ingredients my mom used and that I use now. My husband likes green pepper, so I add that along with the garlic and onion. I always get rave reviews from him and any friends who happen to be here for chili night. It transfers to an easy spaghetti sauce too. Lose the green pepper, cumin, chili powder, and beans. Add celery and mushrooms. It's especially good with ground turkey. Even my "we hate everything" picky eater kids love this. Enjoy

The BEST chili I've ever made. Thanks to all the suggestions - I doubled ALL spices, used Guinness beer, added 2 oz. semi-sweet chocolate, and used a combination of pork sausage, ground beef and cubed beef, 1 pound each. Absolutely wonderful! We aren't huge bean-lovers so I stuck with one can. Great recipe that I will make again and again.

Great! I followed some of the suggestions here: 1/2 beef, 1/2 pork, doubled spices, Guinness, and chocolate. I would also add some chopped onions after cooking - the ones added at the beginning are pretty soggy by the time everything is done. This made for a good, hearty meal that my husband and I loved. And there was plenty left over to put in the freezer!

This chili is the best we've ever had! My boyfriend ate three servings last night alone. A few suggestions to improve it...substitute 1.5 lbs. ground pork for half the meat (I also discarded about half the fat), add 2 oz. semi-sweet chocolate (trust me), double ALL the spices including the chili powder, add one can black beans, and be sure to use a very dark beer (stout) for a more intense flavor. It will have a little kick to it but will be certain to please any chili lover. If you like it spicy, add a little cayenne pepper at the end. I'll be making this on a regular basis. Serve with cornbread...yum.

Fabulous! I made this for a chili contest but my boyfriend and I ate the entire batch before I could submit it! I too doubled all spices except for the chili powder and used 3 cans of beans--pinto and kidney. I used pork, beef and hot Italian sausage. My boyfriend, a chili aficienado, says this is the best he's ever had.

This is absolutely delicious. For those of you who (like me) do not like really thick chili, this is a very dense and heavy texture. I used only 1 lb. of beef, added an extra 16 oz. can of c'd tomatoes and extra stock, and it was still a little thick for my tastes (though still delicious).

Rating: 3
This Chili was fantastic, and I would definitely make it again. I tried it with chicken (less fat), and it was still great. I suggest adding ground chicken, and chicken cut into small cubes so there's different textures. Also add two table spoons of brown sugar. This helps tame the heartburn people get from eating spicy food. And don't forget to add the extra beans.

This is certainly a wonderful recipe, especially with all the tips others have sent in! I do want to direct people's attention to another chili on this site: search for "Lamb Chili."

This Chili is awesome! I've taken several readers' advice as follows: Increase chicken broth to 2 14oz cans, Increase beans to 3 16oz cans (1 each of Kidney, Pinto & Black), use dark beer (Pete's Wicked Ale), and add 1 roasted, peeled and chopped jalepeno pepper.

This is an excellent "base" recipe to experiment with and build on! Many people have added their suggestions below--I used a bit of cocoa, some cinnamon, diced tomatoes with green chiles, beef broth, a bit more seasoning and beans (I made 1/3 of a recipe). Served it over spaghetti with some cheese and cornbread on the side. What a meal!

This was wonderful-my guests raved it was the best chili ever, (and I made it for 50). Followed advice and added chocolate, pork sausage & ground pork-this truly made it. Also added some chipolte chili powder, which gave a nice smokey flavor. If you can, let it sit for a few days-thickens up nicely! I found the spice level to be just right-anymore and it would have been too much for most people, (as it was, a couple were a little put off).

This was my first, totally-from-scratch, attempt at chili and it was great. I followed many of the add-ons suggested, especially subbing 1 lb of pork, doubling the spices (except chili powder) and adding the chocolate. 20 B-day party guests loved it!

I made this with ground turkey instead, and substituted beef stock for the chicken stock. It was very easy to prepare, and tasted quite good. I topped it with shredded cheese, chopped onion, and lite sour cream and it was a big hit.

Rating: 3
This is a great recipe to build on because chili is so subjective to taste. I started by mixing in textures of meat instead of using all ground beef. I went for 1lb. ground chuck, 1lb. pork sausage and 1lb. beef stew chunks. I also skimmed out all the fat after browning. As others suggested I doubled all the spices and added another can of beans (dark red kidney).To finish, I topped it off with shredded cheddar cheese, a spoonful of sour cream and sprinkled with chives. My husband said it was perfect and the 3 year old ate it without complaint. As for the cook? Well I was a little more critical of it...but I think that is typical of all us cooks. Next time I'll buy extra spicy or hot sausage and some hot chili beans to jazz it up.

Best chile that i have ever tasted

I LOVED this recipe. I made some minor changes such as beef broth instead of chicken, more cumin as suggested. Could easily add more beans if you want to. Also, I browned the meat and removed almost all of the fat. I sauted the veggies and removed. I added all of my spices to a little olive oil and let that "cook" for one or two minutes to enhance flavor. Would use darker beer next time, and I would add some heat. I served to family and friends without the heat. Delicious!

Rating: 2
For fuller, richer, more enjoyable flavor, cut bean amount in half, add either 1 lb. ground pork or pork sausage cut up, and 2 oz semi sweet chocolate (yes chocolate), and yes double up on spices, unless you like the bland style, in which case, why not just mix up a batch of American Chop Suey.

Rating: 2
First, if you saute the meat first till almost done, then add the veggies (onions, garlic, and a stalk or so of celery), there will be more flavor. Doubling all the dried spices is a must, add additional black pepper, hot sauce (Tobasco or Louisiana Hot). Use a combination of ground meat AND chopped for variety and also use 1 can pinto beans and 1 can red (kidney)beans. For a richer flavor (reserve a bit of oil from sauteeing meat,) mix a bit of flour and brown (like a roux) add to mixture last. If it is too thick add a bit of water and simmer. Your guests wont be disappointed with this!

I would definitely do this again, tho as it's written it is not spicey enough. I kept it that way because we were serving kids, but I would defisnitely add some kick to this. I also added more beans. The biggest modification, however, was using shredded beef instead of chopped meat. I made the beef by taking rump or round (4 lbs) and covering it tightly with foil, in pan also add 1/2 c. flour, 1/2 c. brown sugar, package Lipton onion soup mix, 1 can beer. Cooked at 300 for 3 hours. I had trouble shredding it, but not sure why. Meat should not be thicker than 1 1/2 inches. When cool, meat should shred....I also added some of the goop from this meat pan, which gave a sweet, rich flavor.)

I thought this recipe was fantastic! I served it at a tailgate recently and the reviews were wonderful. My friends were asking me for the recipe. I cut back on the 8 cloves of garlic and added the extra beans as recommended by the other reviewers... it definitely needed it. I also doubled some of the spices, and added a green pepper and a can of diced tomatoes with green chilis. I used Miller lite and it tasted fine. I think any kind of beer you have will work just fine.

very good, with some changes according to recommendations, of course! I added more spices than were called for. It came out more liquidy than i'd like, and I didn't want to wait any longer, but it was still very good. I made cornbread from another recipe i found here and the whole meal was a delight! I used Yuengling Lager as the beer.

Pretty good basic recipe but needed more herbs/seasonings - used ground turkey, 2 cans chicken broth, 2 cans dark red kidney beans, amber lager beer and added bay leaves, cumin seeds, cilantro, more thyme and oregano, sugar (we like our chili a little bit sweet) and garlic salt (yes, even with all that garlic, we thought the garlic flavor was too mild). Will make again with these changes. Good recipe for crockpot.

I made this for a church soup supper. I omitted the beer and just increased the chicken broth. Also, I didn't put in all of the chili seasoning as I used spicy chili beans - and I didn't want to make it too hot for the crowd at church. A very easy recipe.

I thought this was just OK. I took the other readers suggestions and added one more can of beans (black beans and chili beans flavored with chipotle peppers) but two more would have been better. I would also use a richer, darker beer if I made it again. It just seemed to be missing something--maybe it was a touch of chocolate as someone else suggested.

This is a great, richly flavored chili! I took everyone's advice and have doubled or tripled the beans since I began making it, and I always use ground turkey. This solves the problem of having to cook the meat in a separate pan to drain the fat, and it is just delicious. I'd venture to guess it tastes better than with beef. Reading these reviews, it's obvious how all of us take our opinion on chili heat as gospel truth! Keep it simple and serve jalapenos and hot sauce on the side, and leave each man to his own.

This is the best chili recipe I have come across. Definitely, brown and drain the chuck separately or you will be skimming oil off of the top forever. I took the advice of others and changed it up a little. I added 2 fresh chopped jalapenos with the onions and garlic --2t of cayenne pepper and an extra 1T of chili powder with the seasonings and for the beans I added one can each of kidney and black beans(the black beans are an excellent touch, if you don't like kidney--do 2 cans of black, they are a must add). I love this recipe and will be using it for years to come. My mother has also added it to her favorite recipe list.

I had rave reviews for my super bowl party. Even those who don't love chili were surprised at the spice arrangement. I did use only 2 lbs. of ground meat and three kinds (three cans total) of beans-black, pinto and kidney...great!I used more garlic, chili powder and cumin than called for. I added chopped chili peppers (roasted then canned) to taste.

I made this chili for our chili cookoff at work and it won the cookoff. It was put out at 11:15 with 9 other recipes and it was gone at 11:35, the only one to be completely finished. I took others advise and added 3 cans of beans, one of which was rinsed black beans. I also chopped up a jalepeno and added it in to the pot. I added 1 tsp of ground red pepper and that hit the spot for my palate. Brown the ground chuck seperately and drain it and pat it dry to lighten up the fat content a bit. Good Stuff!!!!!!

Following the advice of other reviewers plus some preferences of my own, this turned out to be great chili. I substituted Morningstar Crumbles (soy protein) for the ground beef, added a diced green pepper and used 14 oz can of diced tomatoes, plus a can of puree and two cans of Ro-tel tomatoes with green chilies. I cut back to 1/2 can of beer and replaced two of the five tbls. of cumin with paprika. Does this count as the same recipe? Anyway, it was delicious- lots of flavor, but not too hot for my spice-phobic relatives. I added a few dashes of Tabasco for myself and it was even better! Definitely a keeper!

Maybe it's just me, but I didn't think this recipe was all that great. The beer flavor was too strong, and I like a lot more beans in my chili (and what is chicken broth doing in chili?!). So I tripled the amount of beans, added a can of diced tomatoes, and lots of crushed red pepper, but it still seemed like it was missing that zing. I've been making one chili recipe for several years that I got from Bon Appetit - it's called Amigos Chili and it was in the RSVP column (for some reason it's not on their web site but I'd be happy to e-mail it to anyone who would like it). Anyway, that recipe always comes out great and is just the right mix of ground beef, beans and spices. I think I'll stick with my Amigos Chili in the future. I can say that this Halftime Chili was a little better the next day, served over spaghetti.

I might make this chili again, but I would alter the recipe. I would add two cans of kidney beans instead of one. I would also do something to make it spicier; to add some heat. Its too bland now - and I don't even like food that's overly spicy. Just using more crushed red pepper doesn't do the trick either - I already tried that. Maybe tabasco or jalepenos would help.

The beer and the chicken broth give the meat a certain "tenderness" or "softness". I like a little extra heat so next time I will probably add some tabasco and jalapenos to the chili. I served with cheese, oyster crackers and jalapenos. Delicious!

This recipe was very easy to make and the end result was wonderful. I added a little bit more of the spices and everyone loved it. It is now something I like to make for a weekend meal, served with shredded cheddar cheese, some sour cream, and a hard bread or crackers.

Substituted two paprikas for 2 of the 5 chilis and added two dashes of tabasco sauce. Finely chopped cilantro and red onion on top when serving makes it just right...specially with Dortmunder Union beer properly chilled, or Asahi Super Dry!

like the overall taste, but 5 tablespoons of chili power is too much.

This is the Best... Made this and everyone loved it. Have since e-mailed it to several friends and family, along with a few more copies I have printed for others. Everyone agrees this is a great recipe.

Made it for the '99 Super Bowl. Everyone loved it! *** Serve with corn bread and top chili with sour cream, onion and grated hot jalepeno jack cheese.

I made this chili 3 times in the first week I found the recipe. It is very easy and has just the right amount of seasoning. I've varied it a little each time--adding diced tomatoes, cilanto, and different kinds of beans. This is an awesome recipe!
