Everyone loved the mashed potatoes this year at Thanksgiving. I will definitely make them again; I even forwarded the recipe to two of the guests.

So Simple.....So Good!! I didn't have any half&half on hand, so I used about a cup of milk(skim) and a dollop of sour cream instead. DELICIOUS!

This dish is easy to make, and the addition of green onions really gives it a "kick"!

Delicious and a snap to prepare! To cut calories, I used 1% milk. Still rich, creamy, and memorable! Sorry I didn't try this one sooner.

Using only Russets, I recall, from 50+ yrs. ago, my mom preparing these. I've changed this, slightly...I saute the green onions & add with cream, etc. & sometimes, 1/4 & crisp button mushrooms to add, as well. Mashed potatoes are so versatile!

This is a great recipe! I made this with the Guiness and Beef Pie for St Pat's, it was a major hit. I did not use 2 kinds of potatoes, but it was wonderful, nonetheless.

It's almost silly to write a recipe like this (mashed potatoes with something added), but frankly I'd never thought about mixing two different kinds of potatoes. I also hadn't tried adding green onions, so I'm glad I found this. Everyone loved it! I discovered that you can do this over an open fire in a cast iron dutch oven. Of course, you have to skip the steamer equipment and just cook the potatoes until they're tender enough to mash with a spoon. Mmmm!
