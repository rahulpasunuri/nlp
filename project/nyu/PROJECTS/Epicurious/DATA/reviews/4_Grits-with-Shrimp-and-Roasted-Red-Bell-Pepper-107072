Made this dish for Mardi Gras dinner. My sons loved it. I added a bit more hot pepper sauce to taste. I would add more feta cheese to the top also, but my family loves feta.

Excellent-easy and tasty...I fixedthe recipe as stated, however, I used corn meal to make polenta instead of grits as I didn't have any grits. It was perfect! Will definintely make again

OMG, so good! I loved this dish. I roasted my red peppers, but I'm sure it would be just as good with jared. The grits were yummy alone. I think my husband was a bit heavy handed with the hot pepper sauce, so ours was a bit spicy. You must make this dish!

This is a terrific dish in every respect -- easy to make, serves a large crowd, lasts well in the fridge. It has become a new staple in my house, and is perfect for pot lucks and parties. I have substituted jarred roasted red peppers with no apparent averse consequences -- and it's a LOT easier! I also bake for about 25 minutes -- the shrimp browns nicely on both sides that way (at east in my oven). Highly recommend!

Excellent! The most time-consuming part of the recipe is charring the red peppers. I like that you can prepare it the day before and it reheats beautifully.

Fabulous except one thing--the shrimp didn't cook as well as I would like. Next time I will broil the shrimp and then add it on top.

True comfort food! This recipe is easy to prepare and so satisfying. I substituted chevre for the feta; I really liked the creaminess and tang. This could serve as a basic or "master" recipe, with many possibilities for other substitutions, such as andouille or other spicy sausage, or even just the grits alone as a side dish.

Merry Christmas 2007. This dish was an outstanding addition to our holiday brunch tradition. I used roasted red peppers from a jar, drained and patted dry, and added chopped fresh parsley. Try this recipe, you won't regret it.

I've made this many times for my southern in-laws. They love it. We add some sauteed mushrooms and have even added cubed smoked ham. Delicious!

This is really delicious dish. I used regular polenta, just cooked it a little longer, otherwise did the recipe as is. Two of us had enough for 3 dinners and it reheated well in microwave.

delicious and very easy. My boyfriend is a N. orleanian so he is picky about grits. But he loves this dish everytime I make it- the grits are always perfect- creamy and moist. And the shrimp really don't need flavoring- they pick up something from baking on top of the grits. Great!

This was awesome. If you like grits, cheese and shrimp you will like this. I halfed the recipe but used 1 1/2 cups chicken broth and 1/2 cup white wine, 1/2-3/4 cup cheddar and feta mixed, and also added mushrooms. Will definately make again soon!!!

My husband and I really liked this recipe. I will definitely make it again. I didn't have feta, so I used a combination of cheddar and parmesan, but I don't think I used enough! You can never have too much cheese, you know! Also, I wasn't sure if the shrimp were supposed to be kind of submerged into the grits or not. As I made the grits earlier and let them sit (as the recipe says is okay) the shrimp pretty much just sat on top. Still yummy, though! I will definitely make this again and encourage anyone who is reading the reviews to try it!

This dish is so simple and delicious. It has quickly become a family favorite. I served it at a brunch for 20 people and everyone raved about it. This will become one of my siganture dishes!

This was wonderful! I used finely grated white cheddar over the top instead of feta (I didn't want to overpower the flavor of the shrimp), and I put it under the broiler for a couple of minutes at the end. I also added jalapeno to the other peppers and it wasn't too spicy. I'd make this again anytime.

This was fantastic! So yummy, and so easy to prepare ahead. I made it according to recipe, but with half the tabasco and salt and used a "no chicken" vegetarian broth. I served it for dinner (guests raved), but will also make it a brunch staple. Will definitely be an entertaining staple.

I made this for last year's Christmas brunch, and am repeating it this year upon request. It is simple and delicious!

This is a really nice quick dish to make after work. The grits can be made the night before and refridgerated. Then just press in the shrimp...top with Feta or Chevre and bake. I have made this many times and we never tire of it. I like adding arugula or other greens to the grits in the prep. Makes it a one dish meal. Add a lovely glass of chilled white wine. Delicious!

This was so good, I want to rate it a 5. I did make one change. I had no feta, but used Chevre. It is hard to believe the feta could have been even better. This is one of the best!

This is really incredible! Loved the idea of roasted peppers and feta with the shrimp and grits. Great flavors! The only change that I made, was to use veggie broth instead of chicken broth since I was serving to a vegetarian. Will be doing again for sure!!!

This dish is even better than the 'Folly's' recipe - Bravo!!!

Really yummy. Next time I might try substituting leeks for the green onions and adding a bit of white wine with the chicken stock. Can't wait to try!

yummy yummy in my tummy! would recommend even for non-grit lovers. followed recipe as listed & wouldn't change a thing next time. if you're looking for a traditional southern shrimp 'n grits, this is not your recipe, but a great twist on the concept! di

We loved this recipe. I wouldn't change a thing, although I wish shrimp fishing weren't so environ. destructive. We can't find sustainably farmed shrimp anywhere, much less those caught with TED nets, so the next time we may use another seafood (scallops?). The grits and feta are what's good anyway.

Interesting & flavorful. Good the next day, too -I served the shrimp cold on a separate plate so as not to overcook them when reheating the grits. Used lemon thyme from the garden because that's what I had on hand - worked just fine.
