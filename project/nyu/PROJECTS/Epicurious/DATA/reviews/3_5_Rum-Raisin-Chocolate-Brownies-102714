Like the others I lined the pan with foil, soaked raisins overnight in extra rum and cut sugar by just a 1/3 cup. Baked 20 minutes and after they cooled I put the pan in the frig to set. They are very fudgy and yummy!!!

I heeded the advice of others and modified the recipe (decrease sugar, increase flour, soak raisins longer, foil in pan). These dense, chocolate-y brownies nicely studded w/ choco chips and soft raisins are very easy to make but I was disappointed that the rum flavor was not more pronounced. I added a rum-butter glaze on top to emphasize the rum.

Read the reviews and implemented most of the suggestions -- decrease sugar, increase flour, soaked raisins overnight in extra rum, check cook time, used greased foil -- but I just wasn't a huge fan. The taste was similar to a french chocolate cake, very dense and not very brownie-y, which was not what I was going for. I also couldn't taste the rum raisin very much.

These were absolutely fabulous show stoppers! I served them for dessert on Christmas Eve and my guests were blown away by the unusual flavours of the chocolate, raisins and rum. They definitely have a grown-up appeal.

I read all the reviews before making this recipe and combined everyone's suggestions. I used 1/2 cup rum and soaked the raisins overnight, cut the sugar down to 1 1/4 cups, increased flour to 1 1/4 cups, baked for 30 minutes. Served mine with unsweetened fresh whipped cream. It was delicious!

I would definately make this again. I made this for a weekend at a beach house with a group of friends and they all enjoyed it, they were blown away with the flavours and taste, so this is definately a keeper. To all the cooks out there who complained about the cooking time, I was taught to always check whatever you are baking from time to time as each person's oven is different and cooking time maybe more or less in some cases depending how your oven may be working at the time. Mine was done in in 30 mins. So maybe you could use my suggestion as a hint for future cooking.

Amazing flavours! Tip, soak the raisins longer for a smoother finish and line the pan with greased tinfoil.

I've made these brownies twice, and I already have the recipie memorized because of the number of recipie-requests I received.

Good taste, but I agree with other reviewers. They stuck to the pan, fell apart when you did get them out and were way underdone for the cook time given. I regret not reading the reviews before I made these.

I might try this recipe again with some advice from people who have already made it. Maybe more flour and no choc chips and the cook time suggested was just ridiculous....over all it was a waste of alot of great chocolate....

Delicious recipe, but after reading other reviews, I made some changes. I used 1 cup of prunes instead of raisins, and soaked them in 1/4 cup of Armagnac overnight. I plan to increase this to 1/3 cup next time I make these. I also cut the sugar to 1-1/2 cups, but plan to cut it another 1/4 cup. I increased the flour to 1 cup, but plan to increase it to 1-1/4 cups, as the brownies were a bit too fudgy for my taste. I brought them to my book club, and people loved them. I plan to try them with raisins soaked in Poire William (pear flavored brandy). An excellent recipe once a few changes are made.

These are delicious. They are moist, but a little crumbly. They took longer to cook than the recipe indicated. I used the type and amount of rum called for and soaked the raisins for about two hours, but I don't taste any rum flavor. I'll try soaking overnight next time. Otherwise a four forker. As an update, the more we ate these the better they tasted. Ranks up at the top of the brownie family.

Although tasty, had some problems. Had to bake an additional 15 min. because they would not set, then they were overcooked and dry on the edges, and still underdone in the centre. Also, very hard to remove from the pan - stuck terribly even though I buttered the pan very generously. Don't think I would make this again, but I did enjoy the rum raisin flavor.

These are awesome brownies! The texture was moist and somewhat crumbly - perfect over ice cream. This is from a rum hating, not-a-huge-fan-of-brownies-or-raisins family. I may have to make them for a best brownie contest!

These brownies are divine! I left out the raisins, and served it with mango ice cream. My boyfriend rated this one of the best desserts that he has ever had, and I have to agree!

This recipe is a bit too rich for my taste, and my batch turned out more like fudge than a cake-like brownie (which is usually my preference for a brownie). I used a slightly smaller pan to bake the brownies, and the baking time was about 45 minutes (not the 20 min. as indicated). Perhaps an improvement of the recipe would be to delete the chocolate chips; the 4 ounces of unsweetened chocolate seems to be enough chocolate. The rum in the recipe is indeed a flavorful addition.

Made it for a cousin party and had to give the recipe to everyone. Baked it in a smaller pan so that they would be thicker.

This recipe was sinfully decadent. I will definitely be making this again. After reading the reviews I went with a few changes. I soaked the raisons overnight so that they soaked up all the rum, I decreased the sugar to 1 1/4 cups and increased the flour to 1 cup. The brownies remained moist and chewy, and they were still nice and sweet. Success!

I ended up soaking the raisins over night. I also uses a 10x10x2 inch pan, and increased the baking time. This made the brownies a little thicker. Very good!

I made this recipe as listed here, with the only addition to soak the raisins for four hours in coconut rum (my raisins were kind of hard). They were sweet and gooey, but everyone loved them like that. They also freeze very well. I think next time I would try bittersweet chocolate chips. The semisweet didn't really add any depth of flavor.....But oh so yummy!

I made this twice-1st original recipe, 2nd with suggested changes. The original recipe is definitely better and more populare here---decreasing sugar, increasing flour tasted OK but the texture was far too dense and dry-everyone preferred the more fudgy, gooey first time around. I also increased rum soaking time; brandy works well if you run out of rum!

These got rave reviews from everyone who tried them, including 2 excellent & very discriminating cooks. I soaked the raisins for around 2 hours instead of the recommended 30 min., which intensified the rum flavor. Also added 1 tsp. espresso powder, 1/2 tsp. almond extract, and 1/4 tsp. cinnamon. Will try the idea from the Delray Beach cook re: decreased sugar & increased rum next time around. This one's a keeper!

Very sweet but so yummy and fudgy!! I needed to cook an extra few minutes.

Marvelous! Marvelous! I have made these brownies so many times. They are always a hit and they are so easy to make.

Delicious, but too sweet. I achieved a greater success rate by cutting the sugar down to 1 1/4 c, increasing the rum to 1/2 c, and increasing the flour to 1 1/4 c. The result: enhancement of the rich chocolate flavor and more balance.

I have never received so many compliments on a recipe! And it's so easy!
