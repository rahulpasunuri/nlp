When I was making these, I thought there was far too little dough to spread in the pan, but they turned out great, and everyone went nuts over them, especially when I told them they were low-fat! After a few suspicious looks I was forced to admit they are actually high-fat, and actually required all the butter I had in the house. We actually blended some up with ice cream, and the shakes were awesome!

This is a great recipe. I didn't have pecans and used almonds with great results. The only time-consuming part is getting the batter onto the baking sheet. Line your baking sheet with parchment. There's no need to grease it. Like a previous reviewer suggested, I dropped dollops on the sheet with a spatula and then with floured hands, patted it out to a uniform consistency. I didn't find it to cover the pan completely, only about 95%, which is fine. I took the baked bars (they're more like brittle or toffee) out of the oven and waited about 3 minutes to slice. I didn't remove the bars from the pan, but put the pan on a rack to cool completely. I was able to remove the bars (they just popped out) when cooled, with no problem. They were crispy and delightfully cinnamon-y. Give them a try.

I used margarine instead of butter for these cookies and ended up with a greasy mess. They didn't really set until I cut them and put them in the fridge. Do you think that the margarine would make that much difference in the baking? The flavor was really good, though, and I may try them again with butter.

I thought the bars were a little difficult to cut, but they might have cooled too much. But they were very good and very different. I really wanted to make them, so I used salted butter and melted the butter in the microwave. This made it easy to spread. I will definilty make this again using the unsalted butter and making sure it is soft and not melted. Thanks for this great receipe!

Half cookie half candy. The bars are so rich with butter that you can serve them as 1" squares. Great as a topper to something else less rich, like warm fresh pieces of pears or summer fruits. No need to grease pan.

I was very disappointed in this recipe. I expected it to be troublesome but to taste really good. I had no trouble spreading it in the pan and removal was easy because I buttered the pan really well. The result, a very greasy bar cookie with o.k. flavour. I will not be making it again.

Well, I goofed on this recipe...put the nuts IN the dough! Sigh. But they came out fine! I also added a bit of white pepper, vanilla and nutmeg. GREASE the sheet...simple clue. To put dough in pan, grease pan, then drop large tablespoons of dough over pan. Lightly flour fingertips and press into pan to make an even dough. Then use a kitchen knife to finish spreading and to even out.

After reading the comments of other cooks, I was prepared for difficulty getting these out of the pan -- I greased the pan with a lot of butter (A LOT) and had no trouble removing them. Very easy to make, but like others said, difficult to spread. Well worth it, though -- they taste excellent!

For the cinnamon lover this is a great recipe. I used parchment paper which made the reomoval easy, easy! If you want quick this is for you!

Very difficult to spread in greased pan and difficult to remove once cooked.

Use some non-stick spray or melted butter on the pan to prevent sticking. This is a really delicious and wonderfully presentable EASY recipe. Have made it a number of times and it's a great crowd (and cook) pleaser.

They are difficult to remove from the pan. But they taste so good I will definitely make them again.
