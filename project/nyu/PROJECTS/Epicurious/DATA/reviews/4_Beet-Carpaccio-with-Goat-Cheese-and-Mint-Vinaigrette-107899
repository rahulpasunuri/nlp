This dish is delish! 4 forks for taste and for ease of making. I was so pleasantly surprised how delicious it was when I put all the flavors together. Like some of the other reviewers, I steamed my beets because the house was already too hot. I think it's my new favorite beet recipe! Enjoy!

I made this for my monthly cooking/knitting group. They are a discerning bunch of ladies, and everyone LOVED this, including the "I don't usually like beets" people. I put the shallots into the vinaigrette and I served it with the cheese separate to prevent color bleeding. Absolutely delicious.

Excellent dish for guests - so impressive. I use a mandoline to slice beets paper thin, like beef carpaccio. Much easier than using a knife or vegetable peeler. Just be sure to slice red and yellow separately to maintain colors.

Very fun recipe. The mint and the rest of the dressing really balanced out the goat cheese. My husband, who doesn't even try beets, ate almost all of his dish!

This was a wonderfull recipie. My boyfriend and I love beef carpaccio so I was inspired to make this for him as a substitute. I prepared the beets as shown here but served then drizzeled in olive oil and topped with shaved parmesean because that is how our favorite restaurant prepares the beef version we love so much. I can't stress enough how much we enjoyed it,

I have made this many times. It is delicious as written, but I often puree the shallot along with the mint and vinegar. Rave reviews are expected!!

I learned (slowly) to enjoy beets years ago, but this is the first beet dish I made myself. Just one point to make - the goat cheese should be added just before serving because otherwise the beet juice leeches into the cheese and you have pink globs all over instead of the nice contrast of the red beets and white cheese and the green mint&chives.

I didn't like the mint vinaigrette with the beets and goat cheese but I did like the beets and goat cheese together, especially when I added some moreton bay bugs on top. The next time I make this I will use some other vinaigrette and I will definitly be putting some moreton bay bug on top of the beets.

I'm usually not a big beet-fan, but this dish won me over! It was beatiful, easy, and tasted great. I added some toasted, chopped walnuts (per the suggestion from a previous reviewer), and it added some cruch - I'd do it again.

I steamed the beets as it was too hot to turn on the oven. I also added the shallots to the dressing. I used a white wine vinegar with mint. I am lucky enough to get fresh goat cheese from an artisan cheesemaker in our area which is very mild. The dish is lovely to look and even better to eat.

I have made this dish many times to rave reviews. I have tweaked it this way and that. The combination of flavors is too good to mess-up. I often blend the vinagrette with the shallot and drizzle it over the beets before the cheese is added.

Delicious! I steamed the beets because I was short on time. The flavor combination is wonderful.

thought the amount to vinegar would be too strong but it was just right; used brown rice vinegar, lemon juice and ume vinegar

I really like beets and I loved this unusual "salad." Goat cheese goes so well with the beets and the mint is a great taste addition. It got the thumbs up from my husband and brother-in-law. I'm making it again today. A side note: I followed the recipe exactly and used a mandoline to get nice thin slices of beets. It made a wonderful presentation that way. But I had leftover beets, so I chopped them up and mixed in the dressing and it was just as good that way, just not as pretty.

I forgot to mention that I used my handy cheese slicer to slice the beets. It made perfect slices just the right thickness. I'd actually give this recipe 3 1/2 forks. Scrumptious!

Great dish. I've made it three times and am making it again for guests this weekend. I added about 1/3 cup dry roasted walnuts to the recipe. (I 'roasted' them in an iron skillet on top of the stove for a few minutes and then sprinkled them on top of the salad right before serving. They were a hit. I plan on making this dish quite often. It's a winner!

This is an amazing dish! I haven't been this excited about a new recipe in a while, and I do a lot of cooking. Tender beets with goat cheese and mint is an unbelieveably good combination. The fresh seasonings all go well. I would definitely make this again, and plan to serve it to company the next chance I have.

I served this as a first course for a dinner party last night, and it got raves! I used feta, and didn't slice the beets really thin, only because I was short on time. The flavors are incredibly interesting and perfect with beets........it's pretty, too!

Really delicious, "beetfiul" presentation. The flavor of the mint really sets off the beets nicely. It did take some time to slice and lay out the beets, but it's worth the effort. I even converted some non-beeteaters.

EXELLENT! I even enjoyed it a day later with the leftovers.

First tried this recipe when beets were flooding the local farmers' market. I'm no beet fan, but we were having a couple of priest friends (sophisticated, well-traveled fellows) for dinner, and I thought they might enjoy them. It turns out neither of them liked beets at all...until they ate these. As Fr. Reidy put it, "You know, I think God probably invented beets just for this dish."

What a terrific recipe! Simple, easy and tasty! I made this for a gathering and even non-beet people enjoyed it. I used a mandoline to slice the beets, very easy.

This is great. I cut the beets into dice instead of the slices. Wonderful flavors. Have already fixed it three times. A keeper.
