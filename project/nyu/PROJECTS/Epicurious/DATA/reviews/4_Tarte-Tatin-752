I have been using this recipe for 13 years. It looks impressive and tastes amazing. I make it twice a year. It can be a messy dessert to make - the apples usually spill over onto the stovetop and then again in the oven. My smoke alarm often goes off while it's cooking.

BEST PASTRY EVER!!! I'm not a huge apple fan, but made this for an autumn apple-themed party. The filling was too sweet for me, and turning the large tart over was too much, so I just served it in the pan with the delicious pastry on top. I have since made the pastry for other fruit and pumpkin pies. It works without pre-baking as a bottom crust although it will be dense. I add a tablespoon more sugar and use salted butter and add a pinch more salt because I like a tastier crust. I'm tempted to make the crust with a dusting of cinnamon sugar and cut out holiday cookies.

I wish I had read all of the comments before making this tarte. 425 is way too hot for the caramel and apples and mine burned - such a waste of effort and food. Next time I will make the caramel by itself and then build it once the caramel has taken. 375 for 20 minutes - tops!

My French mother in law makes Tarte Tatin all the time. But she cheats by using French supermarket frozen crust, cutting her prep. time by half but still getting amazing results! I always resisted making it because I hate making pie crust. But this recipe's crust is so easy and tastes fabulous! For the filling, my mother in law doesn't use any butter. Just add sugar to pan and melt until light brown. Add apples (about 4 large apples if using a regular 9-inch pan/pie dish). Cook apples in caramel until soft but still holding form -- for me far less time than this recipe calls for. I transferred to a pie dish and added foil under my pie dish to catch some overflowing caramel. Added pie crust and baked until golden brown. Perfect appearance and taste, although I did find the cooking/baking a little messy. My husband said it was as good as his mother's!

4 forks for pastry, 2-3 for filling. The pastry is extraordinary and delicious. And easy. The filling - very very sweet and one-dimensional. I'm not a super apple fan anyway, so I think this needs spices to make it tastier. When I made it, I decided not to bother turning the tarte over - just served it as a one-crust pie. I used some scraps from the dough to put leaves on the crust and it looked great.

This may be the best thing that I ever made. Having made it twice now, I had better results transferring the apples to pyrex pie dish after caramelizing them and before baking. This kept them forming a tighter fit when I flipped the tart at the end. Also, I tried substituting the sour cream with Greek yogurt as someone else suggested, and the crust was not as crisp.

Best tarte tatin ever! I made the crust 1/2 whole wheat, subbed non-fat greek yogurt for sour cream. I cut the butter and sugar by 1/4, as previous reviewer did. I also took the same reviewer's advice and caramalized apples for only 20 mins. Baked for much less time, 20 minutes. I retrofitted my pie shield using tin foil to make it 12 inches to keep crust from burning. I actually made two of these tarts this week and my mother-in-law(!) ordered one for next week! Yum!!

I have made this recipe for the last 15 years and I always get rave reviews. We go apple picking in Wisconsin every Fall and this is the first recipe I am asked to make when we get back with the apples. The only time I have ever had a problem is when I tried using a cast iron skillet. The tart came out totally burned. If using cast iron I would definitely cut down on the cooking time and temperature. I use johnathan apples and wouldnt use anything else. I tried granny smiths once but they were too mushy (probably old apples from the market). I wouldnt change a thing about this recipe.

Excellent tarte tatin recipe! I used Gala apples and they held up very well. For health reasons I was skeptical about baking in a non-stick pan, so I used a cast iron skillet instead and it worked perfectly. The sour cream pastry is wonderful; I've since used it for a version of this dish with pears and the results were equally impressive.

Rating: 3
This was good, probably could be great with a few improvements. Used Crispin and Northern Spy apples. Next time I'll cook the caramel without the apples for longer and use less sugar. After being on the stovetop about 30 mins, the apples were a bit overcooked, but the caramel color was perfect.

simply amazing... get the right pan!

This is the best recipe for tarte tatin. Have tried many many others but nothing compares to this one. I always use Gala apples as they are easy to find and hold up extremely well in the cooking/baking process. I have a 10" le creuset and cut back on the apple ingredients. I too cut back on the butter and sugar so you can taste the apples. The sour cream pastry is the best. Not sure how it can ever be bitter. A keeper for sure!

I have been making this recipe since the 90's. Each and every time, people devour the tarte. The crust is exceptional. I will occasionally vary the recipe, adding different fruits...you just have to adjust the amount of butter so it is not too juicy.

I should add that I did cut back the sugar to a scant cup, after reading the comments about it being too sweet. But with that modification, I'd definitely make it again.

I gotta tell ya...this recipe is definitely the best one of many I've tried. The sour cream pastry is awesome and hard to screw up. The technique for carmelizing the apples is the most foolproof of them all as well. HOWEVER. This is what I found: - too sweet. I reduced the sugar/butter in the apples part by 1/3 and found it just perfect. - cooking times too long. Especially with certain cooking apples; after all, who wants mush? It took less than 1/2 hour to produce brown caramel and exactly 20 minutes to bake to perfection in my house. I am aware everybody's oven is different - but beware. Keep an eye. Otherwise go with THIS recipe as opposed to the ones that have you boiling sugar on it's own. That is just a recipe for disaster for first timers, and I think this one is much better. Enjoy.

I agree with previous reviewer- I found this a bit too sweet without enough dominant apple flavor.

Rating: 4
I found this dish to be simple, yet very tasty. It was big hit in my house. I cut down the ingredients somewhat as I was using a Le Creuset dish that was just over 10". I need to cut down a wee bit more as the butter / sugar mixture kept bubbling over the dish. My stove was somewhat of a mess, but cleaned up well. I would definitely make this again. Very yummy.

Rating: 1
This gets one fork from me as the only redeeming quality of this recipe is the pastry. Too much butter, too much sugar. In making the caramel I had to dump the excess butter that was pooling above and beyond the caramel. The excessive sweetness and buttery flavor dominated and drowned out the apple taste. My guest asked if they really were apples. The presentation was nice and by using a non-stick skillet I had no problems with burning the caramel or inverting at the end. If I attempt this recipe again, I'll cut the butter and the sugar down by at least half. I've compared the amounts called for in this recipe to others on this site and it is indeed at least twice by most I looked at... for whatever it's worth.

Such a great recipe! Like another reviewer, I've been looking for it for years, because I remembered the sour cream pastry. I did a few things differently: used Braeburns (still a bit tart, I'll have to play with that), prepared the apples in a skillet, and then transferred them and the syrup to a springform pan. Made it a breeze to plate, but make sure you put the springform pan on a cookie sheet lined with foil if you do this--some of the syrup inevitably leaks out. I think 45 minutes is probably way too long for the apples; watch them carefully! I cooked mine about 35.

This was exceptional and easy! Definitely a wow at the end of a wonderful dinner party!

I was nervous as all get out with so many variables, but against all odds it came out great. I used a 10.75 inch le creuset, reduced portions with guesses, mostly golden delicious with some braeburns thrown in, and watched the timing like a hawk, reducing that a lot too. I JUST squeaked under the burned line, but am thrilled it worked at all, much less came out so light and tasty. I served with (Mon Dieu!) Reddi Wip, since we are all of that "terroir", like it or not, and it was fine.

I have been making this recipe since it first appeared over 10 years ago. It was my first successful attempt at baking so it has long been a favorite. I like to use a combination of whatever apples are freshest either in my yard or the farmer's market. It really is delicious and relatively easy even for a novice. It totally got me involved in making deserts so many years ago.

The directions are perfect, however, I don't have a wisk beater so I used my hands... that worked well too. I've been looking for an easy and good tarte tatin recipe for years. Next time I make it I'll add some cinnamon and black pepper to the recipe. Served this to a Chef and it was a hit.

I served this last night. My guests enjoyed it. I was left a little wanting. The sour cream pastry dough is divine. That gets 4 forks. I did not have the best success with this dish, and I'm an intrepid cook. I used a cast iron skillet, as it was the only non-stick skillet I had. I had no problems with release. I think that I over-browned the caramel in the beginning. I found the texture of the apples (granny smith) very mushy--but 45 minutes on stove presaged that. Tart, though, it was! I will definitely make this again. I have come to rely heavily on other raters suggestions. I'll use the same pan, but keep a more watchful eye. I'll also experiment with a blend of apples.

Rating: 4
I followed the instructions exactly. Did not substitute or add anything. People have been raving about this for weeks. One thing I definitely recommend is that you use a non-stick skillet. Last time I used a tarte tatin copper pan but it stuck a little and was hard to turn over. Also, I think 425 is a little bit high, 400 would be better. The flavor is incredible and you can do a lot the day before. I make the dough and also peel and cut the apples the day before, they do turn brown, but so what? they are going to be brown anyway!

This has been a desert recipe staple for my thnaksgiving table for 10 plus years. People rave, RAVE about it. I mostly follow the recipe though I use salted butter, it seems to cut that cloying sweetness so many of you are offended by. I use a dark non-stick skillet sprayed with quick release. I think a shiny steel pan would be better in the long run but a non - non-stick pan complicates things. Careful attention to heat control is critical.. The apples should cook slowly for close to the approximate cooking time. Allowwing the syrup to pentrate the apple also helpping to distribute the sweetness evenly through the apple. I also use granny smith for a cleaner taste with a tart edge. Pay attention to the color of the syrup as it caramelizes. I try for the light side of peanut butter color in the dark surfaced pan. Anydarker and your apples will burn. Turned out the apples should be a gorgeous deep auburn brown and form a slight delicate crust when the tart cools. This is best served warm and definintely same day. Its not nearly as good on day 2. The creme fresh is very important too as it helps balance the sweet and tart AND BUTTERY RICH FLAVORS. Id give it a best of contest anyday. I served it once and recieved a standing ovation(no joke).. the Tatin sisters are smiling down on us that made it correctly. Bon appetite

What a tremendous amount of work for such a mediocre taste. I followed the recommendations and variations but the only reason this tarte gets one fork from me is for the superb pastry. The apples were sickeningly sweet. This is an Americanised version that does not even come close to the French Tarte Tatin. I'll stick to my French recipe book next time but this recipe is undeserving of the epicurious seal of approval!

Rating: 3
I agree with the cook who suggested to reduce the cooking time of the caramel and of the apples--made mine in a le creuset cast iron, and the apples burned like crazy after about 30 minutes. Went ahead and continued with the recipe though-- the pastry is lovely (quite tender, and substantial). We ended up picking though the burnt remains of apples-- even though a bit of a disaster, the unburned portions were delicious! Will reduce time to cook the apples to less than 30 minutes next time.

Well, this was a lesson in making Tarte Tatin.... I used a cast iron skillet (which has given me wonderful upside down cakes before) but the tart burned at 425 degrees. I had to throw out the mess and do it all over again. It worked out great in a heavy steel skillet when baked for 35-40 minutes at 350 degrees. When using the cast iron skillet, I baked the tart at 325 degrees and convection for 40 minutes. All I can say is test the pastry with a knife in order to check whether it is done. My conclusion: it is all in the skillet!

Loved it! I made this using the suggested golden delicious apples. Although they were larger than pipins, I still just quartered them, which was large chunks Following the directions and standing some of them up on their ends resulted in soft and delicious apples. It was considered one of the most delicious desserts by everyone at dinner. The crust was really easy and fabulous and the directions easy to follow.

Due to turkey taking up oven space, I placed the plan too low in the oven and the result was a tarred disaster. Also, the apple mixture was very dark prior to baking. Should I try again using the middle oven rack and the correct temperature?

I read all reviews and then did the following: I used the butter/shortening pastry found on the sour cherry pie (on this site) I have had success with before. I made the dough at 10. peeled 5 HUGE granny smiths at 2 pm and sprinkled with the 2 T of sugar, a dash of cinnamon, nutmeg and pepper as suggested below. I started the carmel in my 10" non stick all clad b/c that was the closest I had. Because of the dark coating I couldn't tell how dark the carmel was and was worried about burning issues as suggested below. I did the carmel w/o apples for about 3 min. but I think next time i'll do longer. I fitted as many apples in as i could, but had problems with the last few. I cooked on stove for about 40 min. and let it cool slightly as I was ahead of schedule. I think this was a mistake b/c I do think the bottom apples were cooked too much, though the top ones that i had fitted in 1/2 way through stove cooking were just right. Then i cut out pastry (perfect!) baked for 30 min at 400 (my oven runs hot) and it looked gorgeous. had no problems with it coming out using the nonstick. Only lessons for next time: more carmel w/o apples, about 35 min. on stove and top with pastry and bake w/o cooling down in between (b/c the apples continued to cook, o/c).

Rating: 3
My final product tasted wonderful and the color was gorgeous but the apples turned to more of an apple sauce texture. I am not sure if this was due to overcooking or if it was because I cut the apples into 8ths instead of quarters so that I could fit them in the pan more easily. I guess I would try a shorter cooking time and just quartering the apples next time. Also, I agree with others about the peanut colored syrup comment. I think that is a little too vague.

Lip smackingly delicious. At the serving of dessert everyone wished they had less main course! My single adaptation was to use pate brise as I found this was better. Make twice as much , roll out to size and keep frozen for a second go. It is the first time I have been able to reverse a Tatin without being utterly covered in syrup! Thanks a lot!

I have used this recipe for years. When I make this all around the table u will HEAR how deilcious it is. Increidble, I use granny apples they provide a tart contrast to the sweetness of the glaze. I have adapted it to the food processor as i never had luck making it in the kitchenaid mixer. Also the reference to when the syrup turns "peanut colred is a bit vague and slightlty over cooking it can cause a burned product. It should never even approach the color of commercial carmels, and should be plae like a raw peanut not a roasted peanut. Fantastic recipe

This recipe is fantastic & gets rave reviews from guests! A friend & I made it twice each & ALL FOUR tarts were perfect every time! BUT - we used Golden Delicious apples - much more in keeping with a true French Tarte Tatin. Also, I refuse to serve ice cream with this tart - crème fraîche is the best compliment - it's not too sweet & it balances out the flavors perfectly. And it's also OH so very French!

If you follow this recipe precisely and use an iron skillet(the only ovenproof one I had), you will have disastrous results. You will burn the sugar-butter mixture on the stove and continue to burn your apples during the baking. My suggestion? Use half as much butter, apples, and sugar and make an old fashioned reliable american apple pie.

I have made this tatin several times since it was printed. I don't even make apple pie anymore. I use about 15 apples and I've used different kinds of baking apples--all with the same results. I add a little cinnamon and nutmeg to the apples before carmelizing them. I've made several different tatins but this is by far the best. You'll get nothing but rave reviews! I've served it with c.f., sour cream and whipped cream. People seem to prefer the whipped cream altho I prefer the c. f.
