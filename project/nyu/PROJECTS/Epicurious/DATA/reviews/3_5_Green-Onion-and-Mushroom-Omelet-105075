I was quite intrigued when I read vermouth was used in an omelet recipe, and as I like very much to try new techniques which such things, I prepared this for my client's evening meal. I used chanterelle mushrooms in replacement, but he was quite pleased and remarked on the unique flavour. I served it topped with minced flat leaf parsley, lots of fresh cracked pepper with sliced tomatoes and a rasher of applewood smoked bacon. I think its a great dinner omelet or brunch center piece. I have also prepared a similar egg dish baked in mini buttered ramekins as a first course.

i made with dried porcinis (as another reviewer suggested) just soaked for 20 minutes, shitake, brown mushrooms, and added some shallots. finely diced everything, sauteed in butter. then when adding vermouth i added some dried herbs; parsely, sage, and thyme. after making omelettes, i poured some of the mushroom broth into the hot pan and turned up heat, added a little butter and more vermouth, quickly reduced and swirled in some cream. served with a little sauce atop and mushroom onion mixture. beautiful! and unbelievably tasty!

Delicious !!! I used dried porcini mushrooms for extra flavor (they need to be soaked over night). Dried porcinis are vailable at fine groceries stores, and are more expensive than fresh criminis, but the flavor is beyond compare. Use the soaking "water" as base for soups or sauces.

So easy and so lovely. This is a case where simple translates to elegant. Then again I looove mushrooms.

This was a delicious and easy recipe that works well for any meal. The vermouth adds a nice flavor that's hard to describe. It's a great 'fast food' alternative to 'drive-thru fast food' when we come home late from work. The only other thing that I sometimes do is add other vegetables to the mushroom mixture (depending on what has to be finished up.) Happy cooking!

Yum, Yum, and yummy! And the reviews...oh, so amusing. As Forest would say: 'Stupid is as stupid does'. Or in this case "Trash is as trash talks'...get over yourselves. ;)

People like the first reviewer and like Susanne are just plain rude. The reviews are simply put just peoples opinions. Just because the first reviewer didn't like the recipe he should just say so and leave it at that. Just because he didn't like it doesn't give Susanne any reason to be just as rude and insult his palate. Who died and made you two king and queen of peoples tastes. State your personal opionion of the FOOD not trade insults of other peoples opinions. It makes a person not want to read the reviews if you have to rummage through the childish comments.

I disagree. I think Susanne is fantastic. Not as good as this omelet, but fantastic nonetheless.

I agree with everyone else. Susanne Haggenmiller should be thrown off this site. Such comments are mean-spirited and inappropriate.

I agree with East Lansing. Susanne Haggenmiller, please edit your offensive and inappropriate post. Merely click on "rate this recipe" again and it will bring you to your posting to edit. No need for such rude comments here.

The only thing worse than the first comment is the last one--but it's considerably worse. If we were voting on who we'd not like to see on the site, people who blend racism with their recipe reviews would be among my top choices.

This dish was excellent, despite the first person's uneducated view point. I guess that's what happens when white trash tries to rate a recipe like this. As far as I'm concerned, the web site would be better off without people like you on it.

What great flavor! I used shitake - only because our local grocery store is not carrying crimini mushrooms right now.

I have not made this recipe yet but it sounds delicious. My husband has been using vermouth in vegetables that he has added to eggs/omelets for quite some time and the vermouth gives eggs a very interesting and wonderful flavor.

I did not have vermouth in the house and used sherry instead (Harveys Bristol Cream). It was a delicious quick dinner that I served with a salad. I am looking forward to making this again only next time I will try the vermouth.

Good grief, find something else to do with your time. Vermout and eggs?!?!? I am not too happy with this web site anymore. Why must the recipes be so way out of line?
