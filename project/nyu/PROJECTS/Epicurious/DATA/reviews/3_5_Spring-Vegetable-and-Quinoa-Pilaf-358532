@ Lore2 - This recipe says at the top "serves 4" so 1 serving would be 1/4 of the finished dish. Yes, I'd like to see serving size mentioned, too, but I think nearly all Epi recipes do give you that much info.

Hi, I just want to know if any one knows when they say per serving in this recipe and give the nutritional information what is the serving size? Is it a cup? thanks

This is a very nice recipe full of yummy vegetables, looks and tastes good. Can definitely serve as an entree as it did for us. It does need some Sriracha or other flavor enhancer, even feta cheese worked well, but everybody liked it a lot. I used 3 red beets instead of the golden beets and frozen asparagus because no fresh and it was perfect. Made the quinoa in the rice cooker with water so was totally vegetarian. Would be great for a picnic or potluck too.

I'm a big fan of roasting veggies. It adds a little more sweetness to this recipe.

can't find golden beets anywhere going to try it with red beets.

I make this with couscous (cooked in chicken broth) because it's so quick and easy. I also use yellow squash instead of beets. This is a nice, light, delicious side dish - especially good in the summer to balance a heavier BBQ. It makes a lot and warms up well, so it's a good choice if you're having a cookout for a crowd (and a nice change from baked beans and potato salad!)

Only okay pretty bland.

Great start. Switched up the veggies with grilled asparagus, red peppers and calamata olives. Garlic, Italian parsely and lemon juice perked it all up. I really wanted to add garbanzos and feta cheese, but none in the house.

Very good recipe and you can vary the veggies quite easily. I get rave reviews from guests when I make this. My friend told me her husband would never eat anything like this but he went back for seconds and everyone wanted the recipe.

I made this in May - it was a perfect side dish for a dinner party. I made it beore the guests arrived, then let it keep warm in oven. I usually use more garlic than called for and I am sure I had other herbs haning around that got chopped up and tossed in at the last minute, but this was good! maybe the reviewers who said it was bland skimped on the S&P, also toss in the herbs and green onions just before serving to get the fresh flavors. i would also do some grated cheese, but I served this with scallops with giber cream sauce from this site so the sauce was also good with the quinoa.

Made this tonight and it was ok, but it wasn't good. It was bland and lacked a pop of flavor. I added a splash of white wine vinegar and it rounded out the flavor in a way that added depth and fullness that it lacked before. Try it! After that little addition, I'd say it was very good!

Satisfying healthy vegetarian meal. Holds its own as an entree. I used prerinsed quinoa, although I did one additional rinse. Used 1 1/4 cup of broth and cooked for 12 minutes to achieve perfect texture. Also roasted peppers, diced, added at end.

Tastes great! I had to use red beets instead of the gold, and it turned the quinoa pink - so extra-Spring-y, I guess. Made the beans and mayo and salmon suggested in the menu - (except it was frozen, so I didnt grill it.) All good.

I love the variety of vegetables in this dish. It is not bland at all if you don't skimp on the black pepper and salt. I also sprinkled a little grated parmesan over it once when I was re-heating it for a "leftover lunch", and that was a nice flavor addition. I recently made a southwest-flavor variety adaptation to include shucked grilled sweet corn and black beans with some red pepper flakes and cilantro.

I enjoyed this meal, but i agree that it needs... something. more beets? some spices? I'm going to experiment.

This is a great dish for the spring. It is light and healthy with subtle flavors. The number of veggies adds a bit of prep time, but the efforts are well worth it in the end. Next time around I'd consider spicing it up or trying another herb to accent the flavor.

YUM - golden beets are hard to come by where I live so I substituted yellow squash cubes. Still very good.

I don't get this recipe. I did not make it. What's the point? Under-seasoned veggies and grain...sigh.... I like everything in this dish. To put then together makes want to season and then maybe season somemore! The recipe really needs to be kicked up.

This was pretty good. I used vegetable broth for the quinoa and it was pretty flavorful. It also wasn't mushy - I think that's a function of using too much water to cook the grains. I don't recommend topping with goat cheese, as another reviewer suggested - it was really the wrong note for the dish. Subbed red beets for gold, and french green beans for asparagus. (I think you can probably throw any veggies into this dish). The amount of green onions called for was way to much. Overall, not bad, not outstanding.

This is a good dish, I made it mostly as it was written and took it for lunch, it was good for three days. It will go into my regular rotation.

Quinoa can be wonderful, but NOT like this! I had high hopes because I love the veggie combo this recipe suggests. But what a let down! This was simply tasteless mush. // Quinoa needs a kicky vinaigrette and a proper cooking technique. I loved Epicurious' "Quinoa with Black Beans and Cilantro." Next time, I'll start with that as a base, and then tinker with adding the beet/asparagus/zuchini, etc. // As written, this recipe is a complete disaster. But with a proper cooking technique for both the quinoa and veggies -- and some decent seasoning -- the idea behind this could recipe could be nice.

Crumbled goat cheese on top makes it perfect.

Loved it! I couldn't find golden baby beets, so I used 2 medium-sized regular red, instead. Next time, I might just use one red beet if I still can't find the golden baby variety. I don't cook may beet dishes, but this one had a great flavor (and you gotta love that color)! Quinoa is known as "the perfect protein"--super good and good for you.

This was much more flavorful than I expected and made for a delicious dinner. And hard to totally screw up which is also nice.

My husband and I had this for dinner tonight. I didn't have beets and so, substituted corn. (I've liked corn/quinoa combo in other recipes .) Otherwise, I used the ingredients called for. Overall, we thought it was good! It had a nice balanced flavor and was pretty on the plate. I use Bob's Red Mill quinoa as you don't need to wash it multiple times first. To me, this is a huge time saver and reduces overall mess.

This was pretty bland and with all that chopping I expected something a little more exciting. There are much better quinoa salad recipes out there.

This was a great, colorful dish; surprisingly flavorful! Made it with vegetable bullion instead of chicken broth.

I think this was fantastic! What a great side dish or entree for a vegetarian meal. I didn't use any lime, it sounded odd to add, but I did shave some parmesan cheese on top. I also used about half red beets because I forgot to buy enough golden, but it didn't make a difference. Wonderful!
