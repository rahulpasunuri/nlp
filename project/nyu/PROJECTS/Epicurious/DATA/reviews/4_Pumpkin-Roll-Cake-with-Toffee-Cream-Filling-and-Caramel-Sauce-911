Had some reservations as this was coming together, but with a couple of hours' rest in the fridge, it lived up to all expectations......easy, not too sweet (except for those who want to load up on the caramel sauce!), impressive presentation. As suggested by others, made 1.5 times the filling. Loved by all from 15 to 65.

Made this for a very discriminating crowd and everyone loved it. My husband said it is the best dessert he's ever had. I will save this recipe and make it again. For the reviewer wanting a good caramel sauce recipe- I used the one listed for the Apple Tart With Caramel Sauce recipe that I found on this website. It was perfect and a huge hit by itself.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner hoping for something a little different as we had about 10 families together and I didn't want to make something that someone else was already bringing. It was a huge hit. Saving this recipe for a long time. The only thing that could improve is a recipe for a caramel sauce. I just ended up using the canned stuff.

I made this recipe last week. It is the same as Paula Dean's from Food Tv. It is good without being too sweet. It was easier than I expected.

I will generally make a dessert of some sort anytime the family gets together, but I decided to try something different for Thanksgiving this year, and opted to give this recipe a go. It was wonderful! The entire family kept going on and on about how delicious it was. It's true that it is not a very rich dessert in terms of overwhelming sugary taste, but it's not supposed to be like that. It's the perfect balance of sweet and spice. I made my own caramel sauce to pour over the top and it hardened a bit, to give a nice contrast to the soft texture of the cake. I also placed a few fresh cranberries, dried cherries, and a few of the toffee pieces on top just to give it some color and personality. It was beautiful! I highly recommend this recipe!

I've made this every Thanksgiving since 1995 - 13 years! It's a family favorite - I had to make two cakes for our meal this year! As for crushing the toffee - I use Heath bars which I freeze and then smash. I also double the filling!

We had trouble crushing the english toffee - it turns out that if you put the toffee in a plastic bag and beat it with a hard, flat object it will crush more easily and not make a mess. Just make sure you don't break the bag =D

My husband requests this dessert over and over again. The pumpkin and toffee are a delicious combination.

I made this for Thanksgiving last year and everyone RAVED about it. They were literally fighting for the last piece! Making this is definitely going to become an annual tradition.

Found the cake and filling very bland, the cake was just a kind of slightly spicy sponge cake with little pumpkin flavour. I made it a day ahead and by the time I served it, the toffee bits in the filling had melted. I thought they'd be crunchy. I like the pumpkin roll with a cream cheese filling much better.

I was very excited to make this recipe after reading all of the great reviews. But, I have to say I didn't like it at all. The roll itself didn't have much flavor (maybe I expected it to taste too much like pumpkin?) and the filling was totally blah. However, the three other people that I served it to loved it (of course my in-laws could have just been being nice. But, my husband really did like it). I think that if you are a person who does not like very sweet or very rich desserts that you will like this recipe. If you are like me, and prefer more of a sweet or rich dessert than you definitely will not like this recipe. Either way, it certainly does not taste like pumpkin so don't expect that.

Rating: 4
Tasted wonderful! Perfect fall dessert. Looks impressive, but very easy. I thought adding the caramel sauce after the amount of toffee bits used would be overkill but it wasn't at all...everyone loved it! I took a previous reviewer's idea and used the caramel sauce from the pumpkin bread pudding recipe. Will definitely make again.

I made this recipe in 1995 and it was a huge hit. My husband does not like pumpkin pie, yet he asks for this every year! In fact he begs for it!! This is possibly the most delectable pumpkin dish you will ever eat. Yes, it is labor intensive, for those of us who are not gourmets, but it is worth the raves!

I made this last year to rave reviews. I'm making it again this year and for many years to come. I don't care for pumpkin pie much. This is a fantastic way to have a pumpkin dessert on the Thanksgiving table.

I made this cake for my company's pumpkin baking contest at halloween. The judges went nuts over it. I followed the cake recipe exactly but put the rum in the cream too soon while making the sauce and it curdled. I still won the grand prize. I made it again for thanksgiving dinner at my friend's house and everyone loved it. It really is a lot of work but it looks dazzling and tastes great.

Really delicious! A nice change from just pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving. I also increased the amount of filling by 1/2 & it worked out great. I've found that dark rum is better than white in the filling.

This recipe became a family favorite when it first appeared in 1995 and has been served every year since.

Sometimes liquor in a dessert recipe boosts the other flavors, and sometimes it's distinguishable on it's own. In this recipe the rum is distinguishable in the filling...and it's just a taste I'm not that fond of. Everyone else seemed to really like this though, so it's probably a matter of personal taste. Not as hard to make as I expected.

This is the BEST! My family do not like punpkin pie or anything with pumpkin, but I had to make this pampkin roll 3 times already and everyrime I made it my family just loved it!

When this recipe was first published in Bon Appetit I made it to take along to my in-laws for Thanksgiving. I hate pumpkin pie but wanted to have something seasonal for dessert. It was a HUGE hit. I have made it every year since, and everyone always asks ahead of time, just to make sure! Sometimes I leave out the rum, sometimes I use spiced rum, which is a nice addition. This recipe is well worth the effort.

Made this for a party and it disappeared immediately!! Although it required a bit of effort it was well worth it. Will make this again.

Made this for Thanksgiving to try something new. Everyone raved about it, including myself, and I usually dislike anything with pupmkin. Made it the night before I served it so it was very moist and flavorful. Did not taste the rum at all. However, like previous review I too had followed the reviews and made more filling than called for, way too much, I couldn't roll the cake. Still excellent although it wasn't the best presentation.

This was a big hit at Thanksgiving. What a presentation! I used 1.5x the filling, which was perfect, and I made my own caramel sauce using the recipe from "Pumpkin Bread Pudding with Caramel Sauce." I will probably be making this every Thanksgiving.

This cake was way too sweet, even for adults who love caramel and toffee. I made 1.5 of the filling as recommended, but only used half of the toffee indicated and drizzled the carmel lightly on top. It looked great and is now at my son's frat house.

Superb. A beautful and delicious treat. I too used the SKOR bars and was very pleased. Just perfect. -- To the cook from Chicago re: gelatin. There are non-animal gel type products in health food stores (and Whole Foods) that will work just fine...ONE OTHER THING: This only used a portion of a small can of pumpkin...what does one do with the rest? It doesn't taste very good just heated...

My first roll cake. VERY good. Also quite easy. Tastes even better after a night in the refrigerator. Important: I made 1 1/2 quantity of the filling, this was the perfect amount. I used 2/3 cup fresh pumpkin- scraped it from the sides of the pumpkin, boiled it 20 minutes, strained, pureed it, then strained again. Also slipped up and rolled up the cake starting on the short side: this worked out just great!

I'll definitely make this one again for a fall dinner. I used it in an office Halloween baking contest and won first prize. I doubled the filling as others had suggested but ended up with quite a bit leftover. Otherwise, I don't know how it would have rolled up.

I made this desert back when it first came out in Bon Appetit and it was the first roll cake I had ever made. I was nervous about making it because I didnt want to ruin it and I didnt. My family and friends were very impressed with the presentation and flavor. I too decided that the next time I made this cake I would increase the filling.Im making this again for my in-laws and ther are all a pickiy sort of bunch. Im confident that they will love it.

I liked this recipe but I would agree with the reviewer who thought it was too sweet (kids love it though). I doubled the filling which was a must but despite more than doubling the rum I could not taste the rum flavor in the filling at all. As a cake it makes a terrific addition to all the pies that abound at a holiday dessert table and I have to admit that although I only thought it was ok, it was the first dessert to disappear.

Rating: 4
Amazing. The spices, most likely the ginger, leave a very clean taste and mouth-feel. I would have liked the toffee description to be a bit more precise in terms of toffee format and method of crushing. Even though my family doesn't usually like pumpkin, they devoured it at Thanksgiving and demanded I make another for Christmas.

This was FANTASTIC! Rave reviews from guests. Be sure to oil baking sheet well. I guess I didn't and the cake stuck a bit and broke getting it off baking sheet(managed to patch it together for rolling and simply cut it into two shorter logs for presentation). DEEElicious.

This is not your grandma's pumpkinroll! This made a pumpkin convert out of my otherwise pumpkin hating brother in law (who generally doesn't like dessert either). Requested at our holidays every year. Wonderful!

I loved making this dish as well as serving it...The presentation looks fabulous, however I would alter the recipe slightly and use less rum. I found the filing to be very strong and the taste was overpowering. Also, I used caramel syrup on top which provided a great glaze and taste! I will definately make this my annual Thanksgiving desert~

I made this cake for Thanksgiving. It looked beautiful and was fairly easy to make. It was a great recipe to make with the kids, a little messy but fun. The only problem I had was that it was too sweet(my girls don't think so, but it was.) It could have been delicious if the filling had been less sweet. The toffee candy requirement was not specific enough. I froze the candy so I could break it up. I didn't let the candy get soft enough before I served it on top of the cake...broken teeth potential plus lots more sweetness. A brittle would have been easier on the teeth. Less sugar in the filling would probably do the trick.

I've made this every Thanksgiving since it came out - by request. It didn't have enough filling for me either so I always double that part. Makes the roll a little fatter but it's much better that way!

Made this for Y2K / New Year's Eve bash and it was a hit with the crowd, but I would increase the cream filling next time around (double or 1 1/2 it to bulk up the middle. I did make it the night before, maybe some of the filling had soaked in??... I'd still increase the filling, no harm there!

We made this for Thanksgiving because there was a war between family members over pumpkin pie. This became the compromise and it was a smashing success with everyone, so much so it instantly became the new family tradition. By the way, we served it with Cinnamon ice cream.

The pinnacle of three holidays running, this cake is an absolute favorite. The hardest part is keeping it from falling apart after being rolled up in the towel. Mine always seem to be too moist. Doesn't detract from the taste or even the appearance, once it's covered with the sauce.

Haven't tried this but it looks tasty- however it's listed in the vegetarian section but calls for a teaspoon of gelatin- is there something that can be used instead, or can this be omitted?

This has become a holiday staple in our house. It is an elegant end to the Thanksgiving meal. It is much lighter in flavor than the cream cheese style pumpkin rolls and more elegant than the traditional pumpkin pie (which I've never been fond of). My only problem has been finding the toffee pieces... I'm thinking about making my own this year.

I MADE THIS CAKE IN 1995 WHEN IT FIRST APPEARED IN BON APPETIT, IT WAS A BIG HIT AT MY DINNER, I THINK IT IS VERY EYE APPEALING AND DELICIOUS. I WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO MAKE FOR A LUNCHEON, WHEN I REMEMBERED THIS RECIPE. IT IS GOOD

I made this one year for Thanksgiving and it was such a big hit, I made it again for Christmas! Even people who didn't like pumpkin too much thought this was a great dessert. It looks impressive and tastes as good as it looks. The filling is nice and light. It was my first jellyroll-type cake and it was fairly simple, even fun to make!
