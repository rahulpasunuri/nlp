This soup is delicious if you use 2 bags of baby carrots. It is super healthy - my family and friends love it. Do not make the mistake of using whole carrots as it is too imprecise with the varying sizes of carrots available.

I made this soup for lunch today, and have re named it "Totally unaromatic watery orange soup with a hint of carrot". There are several ways to improve this recipe; firstly add a lot more ginger and mace, halve the amount of fat, orange juice and zest, and reduce the amount of stock. I probably will not make this recipe again, as I prefer soup to be more tasty and substantial than this. Disappointing!!
