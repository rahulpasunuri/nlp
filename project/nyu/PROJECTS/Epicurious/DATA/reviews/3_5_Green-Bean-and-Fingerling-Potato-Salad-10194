As suggested by a previous reviewer, I roasted the potatoes. The herbs I used were parsley and basil. This dish is all about the fresh herbs and veg, not about the dressing. Delicious.

I did make this and it was good, but nothing amazing. However, I altered it a bit by combining it with another recipe and it was delicious! The difference is that I roasted the fingerling potatoes (at 450 for about 40 minutes, big ones cut in half, all resting on sea salt and covered with foil) and made a different dressing. The dressing had sherry vinegar in equal proportion to dijon whole grain mustard, olive oil, fresh tarragon and fresh italian parsley. I then mixed it all together and it was really good!

This is very simple and fresh tasting. I did add more olive oil than was called for.. Also cooked potatoes and beans in same pot. Cooked potatoes for 7 or 8 minutes then just added beansfor the additional 3-5 minutes.

Very boring, very bland.

While I love everything that goes into this recipe, I felt it was rather bland. Next time, I would let it sit in the fridge overnight to absorb more flavor.

I thought, "100% would make it again, this has to be good." Well, it wasn't. I followed the recipe exactly, and it was just BLAH. Somehow the lemon doesn't seem to mix well, and we are throwing out a good bit of it. Something here just didn't work.

It's the review below - see I never did this before so I somehow separated the rating and the notes. Ooops.

I saved one pot of boiling water by adding the green beans to the potatoes for the last three minutes. They were perfect! What a great way to use summer-fresh new potatoes, green beans and herbs from our garden. My husband already asked if I'd make this again this week!

This was wonderful! I made it early for a buffet, I let it come to room temp, but it was even better when it was warm

I have been making this for many years now and it is always delicious. Everyone I make it for asks for the recipe. It's a summer staple in my house.

Great, simple recipe. Couldn't find fingerling potatoes, so made it with baby yukon golds and it was very good.

We loved this recipe! I also added more lemon juice, olive oil, and a little garlic. Served this with salmon for Mother's Day lunch. It was a big hit with everyone. Will definitely make this again.

I added the juice of a whole lemon to this recipe, and more olive oil. I also added a minced clove of garlic. This was a real hit at Passover dinner - "bitter herbs" were appropriate. I will be making this again for summer barbecues.

Used purple potatoes, it was a beautiful presentation. However, it was a bit dry. I ultimately ended up using slightly more olive oil, the zest from one entire lemon along with the juice from the entire lemon and lots of pepper.
