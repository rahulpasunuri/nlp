I loved the corn flakes! I did sprinkle a little parmesan cheese on them after flipping and skipped the salsa. My five picky teenagers feasted on them for breakfast.

My first time eating green tomatoes -- I sliced the tomatoes about 1/4" thick, used cornmeal instead of flakes, and skipped putting them into the oven - they were great!

I live in the Bay Area and green tomatoes are impossible to get this time of year (Derby Season). Is there anyway I could substitute for ripe ones or tomatillos?

I think most replys where on track, thinner slices, lightly salt the tomatos before starting the dredge and use cornmeal or breadcrumbs, I found to top with a bruschetta is simply divine

Being a Yankee, I had no preconceived notions relative to cornstarch vs. Corn Flakes, and I thought this recipe was delicious! The salsa made it even better. I did it just like the recipe says, including slicing the tomatoes into 1/2" slabs. A great appetizer or Monday Night Football snack!

lordy, never cornflake crumbs--part flour & part cornmeal-never sugar for me---i soak salted & peppered GREEN tomatos in milk--pick up & dredge in the flour-cornmeal mister & DEEP FRY--just started the deep frying & they are wonderful-heretofore, my oil wanted to burn before i got them all fried--tried the deep frying ---wonderful

I too prefer cornmeal to cornflakes ... but I also wanted to suggest much THINNER slices. A quarter inch at most, 1/8 inch is even better! Battering and frying a 1/2 SLAB of green tomatoe is just icky in my opinion ... a nice thinner slice is much better!

My rating is based on the input of another reviewer who suggested corn meal instead of corn flakes. I also trippled the cayenne pepper.

I just wanted to say, I don't think you can make this dish with red tomatoes - they would get mushy. The idea is to soften and sweeten green (unripe) tomatoes to use them up at the end of the season when garden tomatoes might not turn red. If you don't like this dish, you might like green tomato gratin.

I too am not an afficianado of green tomatoes. I am wondering if you could use red tomatoes instead of the green.

I have to agree, it has to be cornmeal not cornflakes for fried green tomatoes, and you DO use flour and egg wash for them, a little salt and pepper in your flour & corn meal and fry. DELICIOUS!

NO NO NO NO NO. one does not use flour in a fried green tomato recipe. or if you do use very little, and no cornflakes. that just is wrong. use cornmeal and i don't even use the egg wash unless the tomatoes are dry. most often i just dip them in cornmeal and fry them up

I have yet to actually like fried green tomatoes, and now I'm starting to wonder if it isn't the recipe, but rather my palate! Maybe there just isn't a recipe I'll ever like. Although I wouldn't make these again, I will say that they were wonderful crispy and very easy to make. I was impressed at the texture, if not the taste.

Very good. Be sure not to let the tomatoes get mushy.
