I've made this so many times and it always gets rave reviews. I use grape tomatoes and cut them in half before roasting; they are never soggy. I've also substituted wild mushrooms for the tomatoes and it is still fantastic!

It was a very simple and flavourful dish. I brought it to a picnic and people thought it was a yummy "pizza"... yes, they thought of it as a pizza, which I didn't agree. I was surprise that the crust didn't get soggy.... I enjoyed it!

Nice easy recipe. When I first pulled it out of the oven, I realized it looked remarkably like pizza. However, my guests loved it and assured me that it was nothing like pizza. I divided the pastry in two squares and had no trouble with a soggy crust.

This is an excellent summer appetizer. I try and remove as many of the tomato seeds as I can after I have roasted them.

My guests couldn't stop themselves. The flavors of the roasted tomatoes and garlic are stupendous and the light flaky crust is wonderful. Easy to assemble and irresistable!

I've found the crust was also soggy if recipe prepared as written. My solution is to cut the puff pastry into serving size portions and baking. Remove the puffed pastry from oven and use a serrated knife to cut in half horizontally. Place bottom half on serving plate. Just before serving, scoop the tomatoe and herb "filling" onto each bottom and then place a top on each portion. Serve immediately. This guarantees a crisp pastry and hot filling.

Soggy crust: I used DuFour puff pastry (made with butter) - and roasted the tomatoes about 10 minutes longer. Result was delicious - crust not soggy at all! Great summer taste!

The tomatoes and cheese are flavorful but the juice really makes the crust soggy...any crust at that...so my suggestion is to prebake the crust, continue to cook tomatoe and garlic mixture to make a nice thick mixture . Cool both, fill with tomato/garlic mixture, garnish with gruyere....bake at a high temp for a few minutes until golden brown...serve immediately That should do it...alternatively you could drain the mixture prior to filling and use the tomato jus as the base for a sauce...with herbs...who knows! All good...

What if you brushed egg wash on the crust before you prebaked it? I (and others) have the same problem with the Wild Mushroom and Gruyere Tart from this site. Others said it worked if you cut the puff pastry into individual sized pieces.

I would give this a "4" if only the pastry crust would remain crisp! The roasted tomatoes and herbs are marvelous summer flavors. I have made this several times now -- I prebaked the pastry for 10 minutes but the crust was still mushy in the center. The flavor is worth the texture diffuculties. Any ideas?
