Bland, dry, and dense. Without kneading, the dough never really formed the right texture.

Thank you so much for posting this recipe. I have been looking for a recipe that would match a Portuguese Bread we have every year in Florida and couldn't find it. I made it according to the recipe (except all bread flour) and it came our PERFECTLY!!! Absolutely delicious. Also, I made it by hand, no bread maker or mixer and tested with and without (much) kneading. The best one was the no knead one. I was shocked and disappointed because I love to knead bread, but nonetheless, I have to concede to the better bread. Thank you again - LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!! Makes great toast!!!

Ah-mazing. I did slightly alter using bread flour instead of semolina (didn't have any) with AP flour as written. Added about a quarter cup of peroni beer and a tablespoon of sugar to just after yeast/water/flour rising step. Came out delicious. Excellent crumb and crust for non-starter yeast bread. 5 forks! Super easy and fast (barring rising time).

I've never made bread before and was a little nervous truth be told. Baking mystifies me. But this bread was super yummy! And it wasn't difficult. I, too, used a kitchenaid and hand kneading like the other reviewer. The only problem was stopping myself from eating the whole loaf when it came out of the oven!

Wonderful bread but I did deviate from the recipe. I did not use a food processor but instead my kitchenaid mixer with paddle then dough hook and then old fashioned kneading. I also used bread flour and only about 2 cups. I would add the salt in earlier as this is exceptionally stiff dough. But the crust was wonderful - thick and chewy like European bread and the inside was a little dense but had good flavor and texture. Really enjoyed it and will definitely make it again.
