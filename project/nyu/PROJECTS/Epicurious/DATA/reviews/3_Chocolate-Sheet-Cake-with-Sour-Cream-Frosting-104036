Not a fancy party cake, but a good weeknight dessert or take-along to a potluck. If the thought of using NesQuick sickens you, try Ghirardelli Sweet Chocolate and Cocoa. I used pecans since I did not have almonds. The sour cream icing was a nice tart contrast to the sweet richness of the cake.

I wasn't happy with this cake -- it tasted like NesQuik. There are definitely better scratch recipes out there that are as simple as this one.

This is really good and comes together very quickly. I needed a sheet cake for a cake-decorating class, and this one fit the bill nicely. I used Ghiradelli Double Chocolate chips, which are just wonderful in this. I didn't make the sour cream icing as I had to use decorating icing, but this cake was still good with the sugary decorations on it. Kids would like this cake a lot, I think.

Simple and very rich. Would be good served with vanilla ice cream.
