Very easy to pull off. I've always made these with just chocolate, but the hazelnuts are a great addition. I baked them for 10 minutes so they would stay soft.

Outrageously delicious! Easy recipe but need time. Omitted the hazelnuts this time but will use another time. Instead added about a 1/4 cup mint chocolate chips(fine chop Andes mints) to half the batter. Delish! The trick to keeping the sugar coating is to roll in granular sugar first, then powdered. Will be making these often.

I really wasn't a huge fan of these cookies. They certainly didn't bake as flat as they appear in the picture, but rather stayed in a ball. they had a crunchy shell when baked and the icing sugar didn't stick to the outer coating so you could see the chocolate underneath. It uses a lot of ingredients and really isn't all that worth it in the long run. Try another cookie when trying to impress.

Good cookies - found if I cooked any more than 12 minutes they were dry. Had to substitute half the hazel nuts for almonds and found the nut taste a little strong. Make sure to cover with as much icing sugar as possible otherwise the sugar melts. Not sure whether this is related to not enough sugar but about half of my cookies cracked very little (other half with lots of sugar looked exactly like the picture).

These cookies are beautiful and delicious! There are a few steps involved, but it's worth it. I also wish the hazlenut came through a bit more, so next time I might try not roasting them or adding some extract.

Sweet and nutty and salty and crispy and chocolatey. So good. They have just the right consistency of soft and chewy with a crispy crust and they're beautiful to look at. Only downside of making them is that they use a lot of dishes, are labor intensive, and take a while to even make the batter, plus refrigeration time, which isn't necessary. Overall great taste.

I enjoyed this cookie very much. Not too sweet, and they crinkled perfectly, just like the picture. Definitely need to chill the dough before forming the balls. I only wish the hazelnut flavor was a little stronger. Perhaps next time I will experiment with an extract.

I agree with the reviewer who said that the hazelnut flavor is there but subtle. Great looking cookies although mine did not look as crinkly or as iced with sugar. I was glad to have chilled the dough for 3 hours because it is hard to manage when softer. The 'roll it out into balls' confused me; I formed balls with my hands and flattened them slightly. Will definitely make them again.

They look and taste fantastic. I made as written and they puffed and cracked perfectly. I wound up cooking them for 16 minutes and it was spot on. Use a good cocoa powder and chocolate. It makes a big difference. The hazlenut flavour is quite subtle, but I like it. It's kind of like a little surprise that you discover as you are taking your first few bites. I definitely recommend these!

This is a delicious and unusual cookie that looks great without having to decorate them! They turn out better when made larger (roll them at about a 1.5" diameter) and roll them generously in powdered sugar.

Rating: 3
Good, but not amazing. I had expected a rich, moist cookie. These baked up lighter and drier than I'd anticipated. If you're like me and you like your chocolate cookies rich and mouthwateringly moist, I'd suggest the Chocolate Toffee Cookies on this website, which are much easier to make and, in my opinion, much MUCH better.

Rating: 3
Really, really good... but can't detect the hazelnut flavor, even though I added 3/4 tsp hazelnut extract with the vanilla. Texture and chocolatiness is perfect, though. I will definitely try them again, but next time I'll add 2 tsp hazelnut extract.

Excellent cookies with great flavor. They turned out just like the photo. My daughter enjoyed them so much she's helping my make another batch this week.

These were great. Perfect texture. Beautiful presentation. Fun to make. Subtle flavors. Next time I'm going to try to add more hazelnuts (or add some kind of liqueur) to increase the nutty flavor.

This is an amazing recipe. I will totally make it again. I made it for a holiday party and they were a hit! The all came out perfectly crinkled and the center was perfectly moist... You can make the cookies as small or large as you wanted them to be, and they still come out perfect. Don't over bake or they might be too hard in the center.

Made the recipe as written. They looked exactly like the picture, absolutely beautiful! But the hazelnut flavor was not as pronounced as I would have liked. They were good, but not Must Make Again cookies.

Rating: 4
Super simple to make. I made a 4x batch for Christmas treats, and the only trouble I had was mixing the dough -- it is very stiff! I just used raw hazelnuts in the food processor, the skins weren't noticable, although I'm sure toasting the nuts first would have brought out more flavor. I think it's okay to skip this step if you're crunched for time. Chilling the dough is a must, it makes them much easier to roll into balls. The un-baked rolled balls can be popped in the freezer until you're ready to bake them, just let them thaw for a bit on the cookie sheet before baking. These will be a new holiday tradition!

just made these (with some changes to accommodate some favorite flavors) to put in our xmas grab bags. made the following changes: left out hazelnuts, added zest from one orange and 1 tsp cardamom. they were more delicious than we expected and had a wonderful texture.

Cute and tasty lil cookies! The hazelnut flavor is subtle but lovely - these impressed many-a noisette loving frenchmen at a party last night! Next time I might even amp up the chocolate a bit... Definitely recommended.

Rating: 3
Though they were tastey, I'm not a fan of toasted hazelnuts, it appears. Instead, I think that I would enjoy them more if the nuts weren't toasted. Also, peeling the skin off of the hazelnuts was way too labor-intensive and not something that I want to do again. That said, they really look beautiful when they come out of the oven. And I had no problems with the icing sugar the way the recipe directed. They look exactly as shown in the picture, which is a very satisfying feeling. If only they tasted as good as they looked . . .

I was looking for a more adult chocolate cookie. The hazelnut flavor was not pronounced. I thought perhaps an additional extract or flavoring - such as almond, hazelnut or a strong liquer might help. (Then, I noted the Chocolate Sambuca Crinkle Cookies on this site!!) The dough just needed more of an adult zing! The cookies themselves are very brownie-like. I wasn't sure they were worth the effort for just a brownie. They are quite pretty. I found the recipe DID make 84+ cookies, but I was sure not to exceed the 1" balls, and perhaps erring under 1". I might try again; but I'd review the Sambuca cookies first.

Rating: 3
There is NO way that this recipe could possibly make 84 (7 dozen) cookies. I stuck to the 1" ball as closely as I could and got about 45. That said the results are very good and I would make it again....just not expecting a large batch.

Rating: 3
I just made these and used toasted pecans rather than hazelhuts. The advice to put the dough in the fridge, roll, then in the fridge again, then roll in the sugar seemed to work very well. The taste is very brownie like. Great with milk and the kids like them.

Made these cookies for a gathering last weekend, and they were a huge hit! I followed the recipe exactly, and they came out perfectly---lovely texture, didn't "soak up" the powdered sugar as I feared they might (although I was perhaps a bit too generous with it)... My guests would have given them 4 stars, but I'm going to stick with 3 until I can tinker with this and coax out a bit more hazelnut flavor. Right now, they taste to me like a really delicious chocolate crinkle cookie (which is what I was looking for in the first place, I guess), but I feel like the recipe aims for them to be a bit more...special. This one is definitely staying in my go-to cookie repertoire, though. My husband is already asking for another batch!

I cannot find my other crinkle recipe I tore out of a paper so I made this instead. I substituted ground pecans and they came out good. Not geat bc the powdered sugar didn't look so good on the cookie the next day, but I would try again.

These were good, but not the classic chocolate crinkle cookie flavor that I was craving.

Rating: 4
Very good and quite a nice presentation. I didn't have hazelnuts, so I used toasted pecans and the result was still good. Chilled the dough overnight and the next day formed the dough, refrigerated the balls for a couple of hours before rolling in the powdered sugar and baking for a total of 15 min. I tried the suggestion of first rolling in granulated sugar, then confectioners, but the result was too sweet. Simply rolling in a generous amount of confectioners sugar was sufficient.

I made two dozen this morning, and I felt they were somewhat dry and too sweet. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception that I use half hazelnuts and half almonds. With that being said, the cookies looked beautiful, crinkled just like picture. The "chill the dough, make the balls, chill again, then coat with powdered sugar" method worked great. I spooned out the dough using a melon baller and baked for 13min. I would probably make them again, but substitute half of the semi-sweet chocolate with 100% cocoa chocolate and go easier on the brown sugar to reduce the sweetness. Looking at all the other reviews where the cookies tasted better after sitting, I'm hoping for the best (I still have about 8 dozen cookies' worth of dough left. The batch is really big).

Rating: 4
I wasn't that impressed with these cookies when they first came off the cookie sheet, but after sitting for 12 hours, I felt like the taste and texture had settled into itself a little bit better. The more I ate them, the more they grew on me! The bittersweet chocolate was RICH and MOIST and great paired with a glass of port wine or a creamy stout beer. This is a very "adult" cookie and a great addition to anyone's holiday spread.

These cookies are exceptional. They transcend the 'cookie' category - I prefer to think of them as 'individual desserts in bite- sized servings.' :) Everyone I've served them to absolutely raves...actually, they don't use words at first, they just moan (especially if I serve them warm and gooey in the middle). I used Sharffenberger semisweet chocolate, which is 62% cacao, and Dagoba cocoa powder - they're both pricey, but using high-end chocolate turns these cookies into art for your tastebuds. I made a double batch, which if using a 1" cookie scoop, is equivalent to 120 cookies. To make the powdered sugar stick and not melt into the cookies, I chilled the dough in the fridge then scooped out the balls and formed them, then stuck them in the freezer in an airtight baggie overnight. Then, I put a whole bunch of powdered sugar in a huge ziplock bag and coated the dough balls, about 5 at a time (working very, very quickly), and cooked them for about 14 minutes. Pure perfection. While they were baking, my husband (who doesn't even really like chocolate) hovered around the oven like a shark during a feeding frenzy. They're THAT good. They're so good that I gave them out as gifts for friends and neighbors, and they all called me to tell me how insanely good the cookies were. Enjoy!

We are in the midst of baking the 3rd batch - and have already tried the first. These are incredible cookies!! The flavors are perfectly subtle, the texture chewy and just right. Not a super chocolate flavor, but enough to really satisfy and adds a great hazelnut flavor and crunch. You have to toast the nuts just right - overtoast and you might have bitter cookies, undertoast and it might not be enough flavor. Taste the nuts before you add them to the batter - if you like the taste, you will likely love it in the cookie. The recipe is a bit time consuming, everything is worth it. We made the dough yesterday, refrigerated, and let it sit at room temperature for a bit before making the balls. Used a mixture of low fat milk and half&half, otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Will be making again for sure!

I have a hard time believing bad reviews on this cookie. Mine turned out perfectly and delicious. I agree with a previous reviewer that rolled the balls and refrigerating them again before applying the powdered sugar. You also need to be generous with the powdered sugar. If you roll the dough with your hands and the balls are sticky and melty, the powdered sugar won't do right. I had to clean my hands off and dry them several times during the ball making process, but it was worth it for beautiful, delicious cookies. If you use good quality ingredients, they have a nice rich delicious flavor, almost like a hazelnut ferraro rocher candy. Loved them!

I've made a lot of cookie recipes, and this has got to be the worst one I've ever tried. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used almonds instead of hazelnuts. I used good quality cocoa and chocolate. The cookies were heavy, and the next day when I brought to a cookie swap, dry and tasteless. I've had wonderful crinkle cookies; these are not. Not worth the effort.

I don't have any hazelnuts, do you think almonds would work? (with a little almond extract too to enhance the flavor perhaps?) And all I have is skim milk...I wonder if I can substitute something for the whole milk...I can get some whole milk though. These look great, I can't wait.

I just made these and they did come out looking just like the photo. The key is to cover them in a thick coating of powdered sugar. The taste is just ok. I'm not blown away. Reminds me of a brownie with hint of expensive hazelnut, but not as yummy.

These are great. I followed the recipe to the letter, except that I used almond extract instead of vanilla (I was out) and half and half instead of milk (same reason- we're in the midst of a snowstorm, so I'm working with what I have). I rolled the cookies in granulated sugar before rolling them in powdered sugar- they look gorgeous and are a little crisp on the outside.

I am not allowed at my in-laws for Christmas without these cookies in tow. They are not overly sweet, but they're very chocolate-y. The first time, I made them as directed, and couldn't get the powdered sugar to stay on (or stay white). The second time, I made the dough a week in advance, formed the dough into balls, and froze the dough. When it was time to bake the cookies, I dumped them from the freezer into the powdered sugar and onto the baking sheet. Perfect!

Delicious elegant cookies that make a big batch. Those who weren't "wowed" by the recipe were likely looking for something gooey whereas these are more European in taste. The combination of chocoate and hazelnuts is very German.

To make them even better, when you take them out of the oven put a hershey hug on the top. Canadian living magazine calls them Zebra cookies. (The chocolate hug is striped) and they are so good! Better make lots!

These are really yummy cookies. With all the steps involved in making the dough and forming the cookies, not to mention clean-up, I would not believe the "30 min active time" it said in the magezine. Do use a generous amount of powdered sugar, as it does melt into the cookie during backing. I would definately make again, crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside, super rich, and super yummy!

I LOVE this recipe and make them each Christmas. I would not advise making them without the roasted hazelnuts. I tried it before and they lose a lot of flavor. I like to put a couple chocolate chips in the middle.

Rating: 2
great flavour, but I had a difficult time getting them to look like the photo. I think the key is for the dough to be really cold. Otherwise it sucks up the icing sugar and and the effect is lost. I kept the dough in the fridge and only took it out to make a new tray of 12 or so cookies per time.

my mother makes this same recipe(almost) except without the hazelnuts every christmas...since it makes so many cookies, she usually keeps the dough in the fridge and then makes a couple dozen at a time to give away at a time then they are fresh when she gives them away. it keeps in the fridge for a good 3-5 days as long as it is in a sealed container.

Delicious, rich and sophisticated. Only problem I ran into was getting the skins off the hazelnuts - toasted them and rubbed in a towel, but only about 20% of the skins came off with any ease. Definitely use a lot of confectioners sugar on each cookie, otherwise they lose the white color of the sugar. Overall, lovely.
