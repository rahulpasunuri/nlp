This was good and even better on the presentation. I did not poach the scallops as I wanted it to be a true ceviche. Everyone was very intrigued when they were served.

I would like to try this over a bed of baby greens. The pasta was a little flat tasting. The rest was delicious.

I gave this recipe to a member of our dinner club to bring to our last party. It was a huge hit thanks to the fabulous combination of flavors and textures. As suggested by other reviewers, she made it without poaching the scallops (isn't "cooking" seafood in citrus juice what makes ceviche ceviche?) and used plain pasta instead of black pasta, which wasn't available. It was still a great looking and tasting dish. The pasta cakes would be an excellent base for other canape toppings.

This was a beautiful dish, but a bit salty...I would cut salt in half next time. Didn't poach scallops as that seems to defeat the purpose of seviche. I made tiny pasta cakes and served canape style. Very dramatic presentation with black pasta.

Only made the salsa portion of this recipe. Really excellent. I drained a lot of the juices from the tomatillos and tomatoes and will again.

Do not poach scallops. We prefer not to overpower the sweet, delicate flavor of the scallops with so much cilantro.

I prepared this recipe as a ceviche, without cooking and it was great. I couldn't find the black pasta, but found green spinach pasta and it worked and looked fine. About an hour of preperation, but well worth it.

Why would you want to poach the scallops? Ceviche, by definition, is seafood that is NOT cooked with heat, but by the action of the acid in the citrus juices. Tastes much fresher and velvety if you leave out the poaching.....

this I think is going to be my favorite dish from now on it was a dish beyond compare.All my customers love it.It would be the dish of the day if it were up to me but I share the restaurant with my brother.But be careful when you make the pasta cakes because the are very clingy and stick together.

I made these for a Christmas party and everyone loved them! They were so unusual, nobody had ever seen anything like them. Be careful when making the pasta cakes because they are very clingy and stick together. And I reduced the amount of jalapenos in the salsa. One of my guests was allergic to shellfish so I made some with ahi tuna and they were delicious, too.
