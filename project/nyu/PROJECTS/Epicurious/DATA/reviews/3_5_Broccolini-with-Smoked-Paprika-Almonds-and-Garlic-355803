Quick, easy & delicious. I used beef stock (because I had an open box in my fridge) instead of water. Very flavorful. It's a keeper.

This wasn't as delicious as I thought it would be. A lot of broccolini nowadays, like the kind I got, is not that thin and tender, so it actually takes longer than 4 mins to cook, and as a result the boiling method isn't the tastiest. Next time I'll take the advice of the prior reviewer to roast it.

This recipe is a good start to a great broccolini dish. I thought it lacked any real stand out flavor; it needed another ingredient or two to give it a "wow". I added a bit of chopped jalapenos and sweet red pepper for some contrast.

Overall ,this was the least favorite dish at Christmas dinner. It tasted better right out of the pan, but still the paprika was much too strong. Lots of leftovers.

I thought the smoked paprika was too strong a flavor for a strongly flavored vegetable.

Oops...That review was for Roasted Almonds with Fleur de Sel... As an aside, the broccolini I got was outrageously bitter but I will try it again. The almond/paprika/garlic seasoning was excellent, at least what came through.

An easy stand-by! I used marcona almonds and also substituted smoked fleur de sel, lemon sugar and lavender. I wasn't sure if it would work but it totally did. I think this is one of those things that you can really tinker with and have it turn out great. I added extra cayenne for more kick and they still weren't that hot. Cooking time seemed long but it's easy to tell when they are done enough to your liking.

I tried this the other night in hopes it would work as a Thanksgiving side dish to take to friends. Oh my goodness - it's fantastic. I loved the smokey flavor of the paprika with the almonds. I made the recipe exactly as written. It's wonderful.

For Thanksgiving, I decided to try this recipe substituting brussel sprouts for the broccolini. It was exceptional! Even those who insisted they did not like brussel sprouts gobbled these up!!

If you're trying to save a few bucks, this would be just as good with regular old broccoli but is a bit more elegant w/ the broccolini. It's really delicious. Do yourself a favor and, instead of boiling the brocc in a skillet, lay it all out on a baking sheet, drizzle it with a bit of olive oil (less than a Tbs.), a bit of kosher salt and roast @ 425 for 12-15 minutes. You'll get better flavor and it will make your life easier -- especially if serving this for a dinner party, as I did. Make the almond topping in advance and prep the broccolini just before your doorbell rings, then all you need to do is roast it, flop it on a serving dish & top w/ almond mixture.

You really don't need that much oil... you can get by with less. I followed directions and it was rather heavy on the oil. I was not a big fan of the paprika - just my personal taste. Other than that - good.

After the excellent reviews, I was suprisingly disappointed with this recipe. It tasted like a barbeque version of broccolini. I would consider trying it again with regular paprika instead of smoked.

I really liked this recipe but found the cooking time on the broccolini to be a bit short. Mine was a bit "woody" after 4 min. Flavors were wonderful, but I changed it a bit. Made 1 lb of broccolini and added 4 lg cloves of garlic, 2 tsp smoked paprika (spicehound.com-love the freshness!), 2 tsp Sherry vinegar. Definitely a keeper!

Yum! Broccolini is so good, and I enjoyed it with the extras. Smoked paprika is pretty strong, I might use less next time. The almonds were tasty, but the leftovers ended up being primarily almonds. This was probably just a serving issue. Would make again, it was fast and a nice elevated vegetable side. Very class-ay.

note to "a cook" - next time put the almonds in a small plastic bag and pound gently with a meat hammer or heavy spoon. takes seconds, and gets the same results.

Very tasty, but I agree that there could have been more paprika. Also, I expected this to be a rather easy dish but found that the act of coarsely chopping the almonds by hand made it almost more complicated than it was worth.

Very, very good! The combination of toasted almonds, smoked paprika, and garlic was delicious, and the touch of sherry vinegar put really elevated & melded the flavors nicely. Even my broccoli-hating children loved it...that's huge!

I made this for Christmas with Broccoli that I sliced thin through the stalks of the tops. It was wonderful...can't wait to try it with Broccoli Rabe!

Rating: 3
This was good, but I couldn't really taste the smoked paprika in the finished dish, and I didn't think that the almonds meshed that well with the rabe. I liked it because I like all of the main ingredients, but I can't say it was a standout dish.

Delicious except I changed a few things. I used green beans instead of brocollini and did not use the Sherry wine vinegar, since I didn't have any. It came out delicious. The smoked paprika adds all the spice you need. I only added water as necessary to cook the beans to avoid draining any off.

I love this recipe. I've made it several times and it's always a hit even with broccoli skeptics and kids! I find that because of the wonderful intensity of the smoked paprika it's best not to overwhelm the palette with a complex main course. Roast chicken was my favorite main with this side.

Used regular broc, and added 1/2 cup garbanzo beans while steaming. Topped the whole business with feta. So good!

Such great flavor! I did find Broccolini and we enjoyed it, but I agree that this could be substituted with green beans or even brussel sprouts with delicious results. I served it alongside a slow roasted Pork Shoulder with salsa verde (also on Epicurious) and polenta. My family loved it.

This was really good. Although I had to go to 3 grocery stores to find broccolini but it was worth it. Its a keeper.

The broccolini in my store was yellow and past its prime, so I opted to use string beans. I blanched them for about 5 minutes in salted water, then shocked them in ice water the day before. The last minute prep: sauteeing the nuts, garlic, and adding paprika and sauteeing the beans was quick. I used malt vinegar as I did not have any of the sherry variety. The vegetables were tasty. The smoked paprika adds a lovely flavor.

Made for dinner tonight. I liked it, but the sigO found it a bit overwhelming and heavy. Didn't agree initially, but at the end found that the smoked paprika can be a little much. The almonds are a nice addition, but do make it a "heavier" vegetable dish. I'd make this again, but maybe cut back on the paprika and almonds a bit.

Made this for a small dinner party recently. EXCELLENT. Very delicious, easy, and updated with the smoked paprika.

My sister made this for dinner to accompany spicy baked fish. It was delicious. She used regular Broccoli Florets and it came out tasty, balancing well the spicy fish. The combination of the flavored crunchy almonds, with the sweetness of the broccoli and slight sherry flavor, was excellent. There were no leftovers.

absolutely amazing. i'm the first one to try out new low cal and healthy salads so this one didn't disappoint me at all. i absolutely loved the mix of broccolinis and almonds tastes.
