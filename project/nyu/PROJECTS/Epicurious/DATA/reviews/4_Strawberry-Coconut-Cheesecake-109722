Nice texture, but I found it far too sweet.

I cannot believe who yummy this cheesecake was. I made it a day early for a BBQ and my family ate it before we even made it to the BBQ and I had to make another one! They were hovering around the kitchen and eating any piece that happened to fall. This will now be the most requested dessert for all special occasions.

Have made this cheesecake many times. I have eliminated the strawberry topping all together. The topping makes cake soggy, cake is fantastic all by itself. Friends beg me to make this cake all the time. Best if you make couple days ahead of time. The crust is THE best part!

Made this cheesecake for my father's birthday party and it was a huge hit! I followed the recipe exactly as written and the cheesecake came out perfect. Only thing, I found the cake part a little sweet (especially with jam on top) so will reduce amount of sugar in the cake by 1/4 cup for the future.

I made this for my friend's bday and everyone flipped out. People who don't like cheesecake loved it. I made the mistake of using a springform and won't do that again. And I chilled it for an extra 3 hours which helped. So worth all the weird ingredients.

I have made many cheesecakes in the past and this was one of the worst. I was tempted to try adding coconut extract, but after tasting it, I knew it would be too much. I absolutely love coconut and was so excited, but the flavor with the Coco Lopez was just too artificial tasting and too strong. I cooked it almost an extra hour, and it was still too jiggly after cooling for hours in the fridge. With so many other beautiful cheesecake recipes in the world, I would absolutely not make this one again.

Creamy with a special hint of coconut. My only watch out: I too used a spring form pan (they're for cheesecakes, right?). I did not wrap enough aluminum foil around the bottom, so the crust got wet (which is also why it took atleast 3 min longer than suggested cooking time). When I make again, I will use the cake pan suggested in the recipe. For sure, will make again.

Fabulous! A mild coconut flavor that was kicked up by serving with toasted coconut on top and coconut rum. Highly recommended for cheesecake lovers.

I will definitely be making this cheesecake again! Every time I make it, I get asked for the recipe. Like others of you I do bake it for an additional 15 minutes. I also like a little bit more coconut in my crust so I do add a bit more than the recipe calls for.

It is a keeper! I used low fat Neuchatel cheese but itherwise followed the recipe to the letter. Turned out amazing!!! Guests could not stop raving.

This was an absolutely wonderful cheesecake. I used an aluminum foil wrapped springform pan. Instead of graham crackers, I substituted chocolate wafers. Using low fat cream cheese, I also added about one third cup of toasted coconut to the batter. I have made cheesecakes for years and never added butter into the batter, but the result was smooth and very flavorful. I baked it in my convection oven and had to bake it almost 15 minutes more than the written time. I was worried it would be dry but the cake was still moist. Additionally, I made it the same day as it was served. Instead of using jam on the top, I mascerated sliced strawberries in some malibu rum and then decorated the top with those strawberies. The recipe is a keeper!!!

Another Winner from epicurious! I, as other reviewers suggested, added abit (1/2 teaspoon)of coconut extract to the batter...which along with the CocoLopez gave a mild coconut taste. Excellent!

This was AWESOME! Made it for Easter after grilling some lamb and asparagus. What a meal and what a finale. Used gingersnaps instead of graham crackers for the crust. Also took another reviewers suggestion and macerated the strawberries with a little sugar and rum. Topped each slice of cake with strawberry mixture and some toasted coconut. You must make this!

Very rich, but not dense. The women I served it to loved it. I used a 9 1/2 inch springform pan wrapped with heavy-duty (long) aluminum foil for placing in water bath. I used sweetened shredded coconut and used 3/4 cup sugar rather than 1 cup. I made about 3 layers of sliced strawberries on top, then mixed the left over jam sauce with the left over strawberries and used as a topping when cake was sliced and plated. It definitely needed another spoonful of strawberries to cut the richness of the cake. It is a recipe worth making again.

Cheesecake recipes don't come any better than this one. It is sublime, love that it doesn't need to sit for a day or two for the flavors to properly marry...serve it the day after you make it and it doesn't get any better, stays perfect. I do add toasted coconut to the batter at the end and use oreo cookie crust instead of graham crackers because I love chocolate crusts.

Great cheesecake recipe...I've tried several times to make a good cheesecake but they have never turned out great until this one. Mine are usually dry and heavy but this one was fantastic! I did use the waterbath and thanks to the cook from North Bend, Wa I didn't overbeat the batter. Some people were wondering why this recipe calls for cornstarch...it is not used as a thickener in this recipe. Cornstarch added to recipes makes them smoother and creamier. I really liked the coconut in the graham cracker crust and since I couldn't find unsweetened either, I just cut back on the sugar a little and it came out great. The only thing that was a little disappointing about this cheesecake is that it didn't have as much coconut flavor that I thought it would...I can understand why some cooks added the extract to the batter. However, since many people don't care for coconut, I think it appeals to more people they way the recipe is written. This will be the only cheesecake I make from now on.

This recipe is wonderful. It reminds me of my favorite drink found here in the islands: the Lava Flow (a Pina Colada with swirls of pureed strawberries). I have made this many times and it always gets devoured. The only thing I changed was that I added a little coconut extract to the batter because I like the coconut flavor to be very pronounced. But that's just a personal preference. It's an excellent cheesecake.

I've never made cheesecake before, and never really liked it either, but my mom was having a barbecue, and I wanted to make something kind of light. Well . . . this got rave reviews, from everyone, and I was pretty darn proud of myself, I felt like a star chef, and people were like " You should have a restaurant", lol, seriously. I didn't have an electric mixer on hand, so I had to mix it by hand, I didn't manage to get out all the lumps so I poured the filling through a atrainer. It turned out awesome. The texture was smooth, just wonderful

Something that should be mentioned regarding preventing cracks in the cheesecake is not to overbeat the cheese cake mixture. Overbeating adds air and volume to the product, causing it to puff and then deflate and crack. Also try reducing your oven temp and increase cooking time. Alway use a water bath or a very slow, low oven temp...wise words from my Pastry Instructor.

A co-worker summed up this cheesecake perfectly in one word - Orgasmic! I did use sweetened coconut flakes and added 1 1/2 teaspoons of coconut extract. For the topping I chopped the strawberries and then macerated them in some sugar and 1/4 cup coconut rum and served it on the side w/ toasted coconut.

This was great! I've never received so many compliments - someone at Thanksgiving said it was better than the Cheesecake Factory. I didn't alter the recipe at all except I used sweetened coconut because I couldn't find unsweetened and I was too lazy to go to a nicer market. I baked it in the oven for 65 minutes in the springform tart pan and let it cool in there as another reader suggested. It only had one small crack in it, but this is a covered cake anyway, so I'm not sure what the big deal is. I will make this a regular recipe.

I've made this recipe a couple of times with a few alterations, and great results: I make it in a springform pan, and I just use a graham cracker crust, no shredded coconut (imo - nasty stuff!). For the filling, I omit the cornstarch, as the cake thickens without it, and I can think of no other reason it would be included in the recipe. For the topping, I've used just plain sliced strawberries, or strawberries sliced and macerated with a little brown sugar and coconut rum. The strawberries are such a nice complement to the cake!

Really good cheesecake. My husband thought it was great, and he's not a cheesecake fan. My variations: I used chocolate graham crackers and pecans in the crust, and topped with Bing cherries. Also, didn't bake in the water bath; bake about 65 min, then open oven door & let cool in oven for about 1 hour. Next time I would use less sugar in the filling though, as I thought it was a little sweet.

This recipe is excellent! Easy to follow and the results are outstanding. I brought a few slices to work and people have not stopped asking for the recipe. I have made numerous cheesecakes in my day and this one not only has a terrific flavor- I enjoyed the creamy texture. I did not top with berries because I didn't have any on hand and it was still a hit with everyone who tried it.

first time I tried it i brought it to a block party and didnt tell anybody what kind of cheesecake it was not many were able to taste the coconut milk in the cheesecake they all loved the crust but felt the cake even tho it was good you really couldnt pick up the coconut flavor so I made it again the following week but this time I added coconut extract to the cake. what a diffence it complemented the crust and everybody loved it

I used a 10" cheesecake pan from Williams-Sonoma that is sealed so that the water will not seep into the pan. I also recalculated it at 1 1/2 times to fill the pan. Don't top it until just before serving it because mine got watery after 5 hours of refrigeration. However, my Birthday Club of 9 amazing cooks said that it was truly the best cheesecake that they had ever eaten!

Hey Santa Barbara - we don't need you to be our fat conscience. If you want to eat diet cheesecake go right ahead. That said, sasn't crazy about the flavor of this cheesecake - something almost chalky about the coconut flavor. I much prefer the coconut fudge cheesecake also on this site, and I suppose you could put strawberries on that one instead of hte fudge topping, although I didn't like the strawberries, either. But that is probably personal preference. Plus the strawberries get kind of yucky the second day.

This was delicious and I will definately use the crust with other cheesecake fillings. I baked mine in a water bath and it still cracked :( What did I do wrong?

The flavor and texture was wonderful. I didn't do the water bath and it cracked pretty bad. I used a bowl of water and let it cool in the oven. It was fine because of the strawberries, but still hated that it cracked! But, oh what a flavor. yum.

Haven't made, but wanted to second the recommendation below of a separate dish of water instead of the water bath (I too always had trouble with seepage before). This crust sounds great - will look forward to trying it!

Liked the crust alot on this one and probably will use it on another cheesecake. Didnt feel cream of coconut added much flavor to the body of the cheese cake or that the addition of butter was necessary. Probably will stick to my old favorite from Joy of cooking and use this crust.

Terrific recipe. Thought people were going to hold me hostage until I made another one. I wouldn't change a thing.

No matter how much I wrap the pan in foil, I always have some seepage when I use a water bath: either batter leaks out or water leaks in. No matter; this was an excellent cheesecake. It didn't get brown after the first hour in the covered pan, but neither did it crack and the flavor was terrific. I especially enjoyed the crust.

I did not have the coconut rum so tried almond extract like another reviewer suggested. Would not do this again--it tasted like an amaretto cheesecake, not coconut. Next time will definitely hold out for the rum.

I made this for a dinner party and it got absolutely rave reviews. My husband is a coconut addict and he has already asked me to make it again for the next party. To the cook from San Francisco ... I skipped the parchment paper but water baths always produce the perfect cheesecake. I would not miss that step as it really does yield perfect results.

Rating: 0
To Cook From San Francisco~I never use pan of water. To prevent cracking, when the cheesecake is finished (should quiver slightly in the centre)turn the oven off, leave the cheesecake in the oven with door open until it is completely cooled. I have made countless cheesecakes with never a failure.

Dear Cook from San Francisco, To answer your questions, 1) parchment paper--you only have to do this if you want the cheesecake off the bottom of the springform pan when you serve it. Since I transport my desserts mostly, I leave it in the springform and when I get to my destination I just take the sides off and serve it from the bottom (hint--I've even taped the bottom of the springform to a cake plate so that is doesn't slide). 2)--Water bath--this is necessary if you want no cracks in the top of your cheesecake. The good news is, with this cheesecake, you completely cover the top with sliced strawberries, and this would cover the cracks. So if you want to go without the water bath, you will see cracks and then just cover them with the strawberries. No one will ever know. If you do the water bath, I always ALWAYS put heavy-duty foil (or 2 layers of non-heavy duty foil) around the outside of the springform so that water doesn't seep in the bottom of the springform. Hope this helps!

This sounds absolutely delicious, but for the people who have made it: did all of you go through the whole parchment/foil/water bath procedure? seems like a lot of extra work, and am wondering if it really is necessary. thanks!

I made this (as well as 3 others)for a large annual gathering at our home this summer. It is wonderful, with a very intense coconut flavor; I was surprised at how many loved it, because a lot of people don't like coconut. The cornstarch gave it a bit more body, and it was easier to cut into neat pieces than most other cheesecakes.

I made this for my Mom's birthday party - they love strawberry shortcake, but I wanted to do something a little different. I used 1 tsp. almond flavoring in place of the rum, since I was out. Also used a 10" springform pan. (Note: when using a water bath with a springform pan, don't forget to wrap the outside of the pan in foil to prevent water from seeping in and making the crust soggy, like I did!). Even so, everyone loved this dessert. The consistency is a little creamier than is my preference, but the coconut flavor is outstanding.

Wonderful!!! I did it last weekend for my uncle birthday, he's a cheesecake and coconut lover. We love the flavor and texture, eventhow I'm not a big fan of coconut. I also, add 1/4 cup of grated almond to the crust .. excellent!! I'll do it again.

I made this away from home and did not have a regular cake pan so I used a springform pan which could not accommodate all of the batter. I had to skip the whole water bath routine. The cake did crack on top but the cracks were disguised by the berries and glaze. Definitely will make again.

WOW! A great cheesecake! I have a 10-inch, 3" high cheesecake pan, so I increased the ingredients by 50% and had a nice, tall, delicious cheesecake! I used my own crust recipe (vanilla wafers, sliced almonds, toasted coconut -- all in food processor with melted butter). I question whether all that added butter in the filling is necessary -- I added it anyway but will probably make it again without it just to see. Takes a *long* time to bake in such low heat in a water bath, but my cheesecakes never crack that way. Also served strawberries on the side.

This is one of the best cheesecakes I've ever tasted!! I've made it twice for large gatherings and folks were licking their forks. I did not alter the recipe at all. I'll be making this again and again. The recipe is a keeper.
