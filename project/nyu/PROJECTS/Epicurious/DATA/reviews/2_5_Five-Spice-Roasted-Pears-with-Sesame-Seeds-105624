This was a perfect dessert for Chinese New Year instead of kumquats. My family thinks the ratio of water to sugar is too thin and that a thicker sauce would be better, keeping the 5 spice and lemon, sesame finish.

I think my pears were either to large or not ripe enough, but I was unhappy with this one, The flavor didn't really infuse into the fruit the way i would have liked.

Nothing outrageous, but really good with Vanilla Honey ice cream.

A very flavorful, sumple dessert. Preparing this dish also gives me the opportunity to use a flavoring agent I don't always use (five-spice powder), and provides a bit of a change from the same ol', same ol'.

Argggg!!! I have never given a 1 before and would have given a zero if it were available.

Fabulous, elegant, and presents beautifully. I first made this for dessert at a dinner for my boyfriend's entire family, and it was a huge hit. It's sweet, but not overly so, and has a clean, rich flavor. Be sure to leave the stems on, and to drizzle the extra cooking liquid around the fruit--it looks beautiful on the plate. Wonderful, and now a stand-by dessert for me.

Really quick and easy, great presentation, leave the stems on. I served it hot with vanilla ice-cream. Next time I will also add some type of liquor.

A nice, light desert.
