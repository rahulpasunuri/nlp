This recipe is just what it is, fresh, simple and delicious! Have made this several times, and am now an okra lover!

I didn't know okra could taste so good. I stuck to the recipe except to add a some red pepper flakes. We'll look for more okra at the farmers market next week. Yum.

In response to A Cook from Princeton NJ, I tried the recipe today with your additions minus the cheese and it was delicious! I will definitely continue to use this recipe in the future

Maybe I'm missing something, but I didn't love this recipe like everyone else did. The Worcetshrie sauce was a very good addition (I doubled up the quantity), but it still needs more spices (I added adobo and oregano). I liked that I added some chicken (to make it a main dish). I'll make it again (when the co-op gives me okra) because it's easy and satisfying, but it's nothing to rave about.

I typically love to spice things up, but was amazed at how delicious this was with just Worcester sauce. I added extra corn, extra tomatoes, and threw in some zucchini that I had. It was delicious.

I tried this recipe, but a la Puerto Rican style. Added a can of tomato sauce, recaito, adobo, sazon, oregano. It was heavenly.

My neighbor dumped a bag of fresh picked okra on me, fresh from their garden. I pawed through my recipes and didnt find anything so I came here and found this one. In short, I made it for my parents and I and it was great as is. Let my neighbor try and they are asking for the recipe now. Can't wait for the next bag of okra to try some of the ideas ya'll had!

I made a lot of changes to this recipe, some inspired by comments of other reviewers, some by a desire to use up ingredients from my CSA that are begging to be used, and some by my desire to make this into a main course. First, used 1 15 oz can of stewed tomatoes in place of the fresh tomato, frozen corn instead of the fresh corn. I added a chopped green pepper along with the onion (used a large onion), and added about a cup of frozen Edamame along with the frozen corn. used some corriander to spice it up as well a chopped chipotle with a little bit of sauce. Finally, added a couple of chopped chicken suasage left over from the previous night and served topped with cilantro and a touch of shredded cheese. Yummy and quite easy. Served over brown rice and my husband and 12 year old son loved it. As revised, recipe made enough to serve 3. Next time I'd double to get more leftovers!

I love this simple, delicious recipe that lets vegetables be themselves. I added a small handful of slivered fresh basil at the end, and the result was very memorable. I will definitely make again. I love fresh okra, and am happy to find a recipe that does not involve frying

Wonderful with farmer's market veggies. I've made it 3 times in the last 2 weeks. A keeper.

We really loved this. It was my first time cooking okra and it turned out great. The fresh flavors of the vegetables really came through when seasoned with just Worcestershire sauce. I tried to use olive oil instead of vegetable oil, but it turned out to be a big mistake as the olive oil burned too quickly. Maybe my heat was up too high?

This was delish! I don't think I've ever eaten okra, and have definitely never cooked it. My neighbor gave me some so I decided to see what all the fuss was about. Like, why bother with this slimy mess? But I browned it really well and it was lovely. Tweaked this a little with extra corn I needed to use up, and used a splash of chicken broth in place of the water.

This is a good beginner okra recipe that you can easily modify to your personal taste. I used the freshest ingredients but thought the result was a little bland. So I toasted some cumin and corrainder and added those along with a teaspoon of garlic and some extra chili flakes. Good side dish for lamb kababs.

I prepared the recipe exactly as directions indicated, and thought it was excellent. My husband thought it was "beyond compare" I like the idea suggested by another to add tempeh for a complete easy meal.

My husband and I enjoyed this mix of summer vegetables. I thought it might be a bit bland, so I added a diced red bell pepper and one clove of garlic, minced, to the onions. I let the whole thing cook a bit longer than suggested, because the corn wasn't tender. I also added about 1/4 tsp. chipotle pepper. I might try tobasco next time.

This was a very favourful and fresh recipe. Great for a change from the usual vegetables. I used frozen okra and sliced the okra half-frozen. An excellent dish! Happily cooking in Oakville, Ontario, Canada

Very good. I had never cooked okra before, but it was looking so good at the farmer's market I had to try. And I was hard pressed to find a non fried recipe. All the flavors really went well together. Here are some adjustments I made and would make it this way again in a second. 1. I used canned tomotos. (Fireroasted & whole) so used a less water since the tomoatos had a lot of liquid already. 2. I wanted to make a full meal out of this and since I'm a vegetarian, I added slices tempeh as well. I cooked the tempeh with the onions so increased that cooking time a little. Enjoy

This recipe was quick and easy, but I altered it a bit. I stir fried the okra, onions, tomatoes, and corn using a teryaki ginger sauce from Trader Joe's and served it over brown rice. It was an entire meal. Yum!

who knew such a simple combination would turn out so well? it's not anything gastronomic, but for such little effort, it's delicious, light, and eye-appealing! apprehensive, non-okra-fan father was pleasantly surprised (i had to put some in his bowl - he'd never reach for it himself). i made two batches - one as written, and the other with the addition of some thai basil thrown in at the end. great for the summer.

What a lovely combination of flavors and textures. It is low fat and can be spiced up according to your taste. I made it exactly as directed, but used frozen corn, because that's what I had on hand. My husband loves okra and was very pleased with the dish. Thanks, it will be made often.

Very flavorable and tender-crisp. A beautiful vegetable accent with numerous entrees. Used Imperial Okra from home garden. Plan to recommend it to my niece in Montana.

I am rating this recipe (something I rarely do) because since I found it, we have made it constantly. It's our favorite veggie side dish. Unlike the other reviewers, I haven't had an okra slime problem. Of course, I was raised on okra, so perhaps I'm just used to it. But the "slime" really creates a nice binding quality, and I believe that's intentional in this recipe since it's sauteed. (If you want crispy okra, the traditional choice is to bread it in cornmeal and fry it.) In any case, the combination of flavors in this dish is outstanding. We just love it.

Wonderful dish even for those who claim to not like okra. Saute the okra in a very hot pan to reduce the slime and do not stir it a lot. I like to carmalize the onions to add some extra flavor. I only use the fresh white corn for a crisp texture. Everyone I have served this dish to loved it, and they were not all okra fans. To help reduce the slime Do not cook it after adding the okra, remove the pan from the heat and stir in the okra. Reheating in a microwave will also help keep the slime factor down on leftovers.

This is a quick & easy vegetable dish which looks nice & colorful and tastes pretty good. I used canned corn instead and it worked out fine. The onion really picked the dish up so don't skimp on that. Next time I may blanch the okra first or crisp it a little on high heat to reduce the gouey inside.
