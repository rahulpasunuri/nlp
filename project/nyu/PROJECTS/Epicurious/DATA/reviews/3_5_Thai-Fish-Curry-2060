Excellent recipe with the perfect balance of spices. If you want it hotter, just add more red pepper. The sauce was delicious and reduced quickly for me. I will make this many times!

Like other reviewers, found this to be a little lacking in spice. I used double the dried pepper, plus added a few whole dried peppers to the curry when it was cooking, still didn't have the right heat level. Was more watery vs saucy even after trying to cook down the curry... probably won't be doing this one again.

Loved this. I read this recipe and was going to pass it by because I didn't want to take out the food processor, but after reading the reviews I thought I would give it a try. I will be making this again. I could not find clam juice so I took advice from another poster and used the juice of two fresh limes and 2tsp of fish sauce. I also used 1 1/2 tsp of crushed red pepper and the heat was between mild and medium. I might add a bit more the next time I make it. I would recommend this recipe to anyone who likes Thai food and fish.

Agree with other comments that not enough heat (and I usually order Thai/Indian food "mild" in restaurants). I added 3 tablespoons of the paste instead of 2 (had no idea it would make so much) and 1/4 tsp more dried chilies. Didn't have clam juice so added a can of canned clams in water. Dice the lemongrass as small as possible before adding to blender. I also added potatoes & baby carrots (boiled beforehand) & mushrooms. Needed lots more salt. Otherwise a great recipe.

This was a good and easy weeknight meal. I did what all the other reviewers said and used all of the paste, subbed 2 T fish sauce for clam juice, added the zest of one lime and quadrupled the heat and it was just the right amount of hot. I didn't have lemongrass but added some sliced carrots and mushrooms, and served it over saffron rice.

Tasted great for both parents and children. The paste was tricky to make - it never became a paste for me (not with the processor nor handheld drink mixer). It was just chopped ingredients and therefore the lemongrass was still a bit stiff.

Pokler Guys say 3 forks for this one.

made a great dish with yellowtail snapper, and a very easy curry to make. As directed it IS too bland. I used all the paste instead of the scant 2T it calls for. I also added a dash of sambal for some added heat. Lastly, I added nuac mam (maybe 1/4C) at the end as it finished reducing. Oh, I also used powdered ginger, as we were out of fresh. A squeeze of lime as a garnish was the finishing touch. (Kaffir leaves would be a good thing to try, I agree.)

Great midweek meal. It is missing a little something but my family still enjoyed it. My two year old loved it-and she doesn't like very much. I am keeping the remaining curry paste in the freezer for another time.

Yum, we really enjoyed this. With a few modifications it was a delicious simple meal. I took to heart other reviewer's suggestions to bring the heat level up. My family likes spicy, so I added 2 seeded jalapenos to the paste. Since I didn't have time to buy lemongrass I left it out. I also didn't have clam juice so like another reviewer I used 2 Tbs. fish sauce instead. Later while the coconut milk sauce was reducing I added a few kefir lime leaves and galangal to offset the lack of lemongrass. (I keep them frozen in the freezer for just such occasions.) I've made this twice: once with white fish (bassa) and once with chicken. Super tasty. I'll make this again and again.

I agree with NYC--not spicy enough, even for mild US standards. I don't know what type of curry paste they're trying to imitate, but try this recipe: Thai Masaman Curry Paste 3 Dried red chilies 3 tb Chopped shallots 2 tb Chopped garlic 1 t Chopped galangal (or you can sub. ginger) 1 1/4 tb Chopped lemon grass 2 ea Cloves 1 tb Coriander seeds 1 t Cumin seeds 5 ea Peppercorns 1 t Shrimp paste 1 t Salt Directions Soak dried chilies in hot water for 15 minutes and deseed. In a wok over low heat put the shallots, garlic, galangal, lemon grass, cloves, coriander seeds, cumin seeds and dry fry for about 5 minutes, then grind into a powder with mortar and pestle (or throw in blender). Into a blender, put the rest of the ingredients except the shrimp paste and blend to mix well. Add the shallot-garlic-galangal-lemon grass-clove-coriander seed-cumin seed mixture and the shrimp paste and blend again to obtain 1/2 cup of a fine-textured paste. This can be stored in a glass jar in the refrigerator for about 3-4 months. Add a tablespoon or two of this to the broth and you'll have quite an authentic Thai fish curry. Add basil leafs or kaffir lime to the simmering broth to up the ante.

I would like it if it were a little more spicy. That would have given it four forks. Next time i'll add more red pepper, i guess, though not sure what spice actually makes Thai curry spicy. Also, i'm sure this base (the part in the processer) would be great with chicken.

So simple to make - yet the delicious sauce retains the complexity of a Thai dish. I'm going to make this again with chicken tonight with the leftover paste. Of note, I decreased the cumin to 1/2 Tbs - didn't miss a thing.

This was a wonderful recipe, I love thai food! For more flavor, I added 2 Kaffir Lime leaves to the sauce and took them out when the sauce was done. It added a slight lime flavor to the sauce.

Served it over steaming jasmine rice - excellent! I had lots of leftover sauce so I reheated it the next day with some added bouillon and had an excellent soup.

Even a child friendly recipe!! Very tasty. I made the recipe without the chilis and my two year old loved it. And my husband thought it was great too without the extra spice. I didn't have any clam juice, so I diluted the coconut milk with a little water and added approx. 2T of fish sauce.
