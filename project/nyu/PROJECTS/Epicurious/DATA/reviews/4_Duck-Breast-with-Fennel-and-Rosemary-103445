SO easy and SO delicious, it is now a staple in my mid-week repertoire! Males a great change from the usual and never fails to satisfy.

Easy and absolutely fabulous ... tender, not greasy, and with great flavors. I used a magret duck breast (a cross between Pekin and Muscovy) from D'Artagnan, and the quality was superb. Made it for my girlfriend as a Boxing Day treat ... She pronounced it the best meal she'd had in years, and immediately insisted that I should make it again for Valentine's Day, and again for her birthday in March ...

Without any fennel seed, I just used the garlic & rosemary, plus a healthy dose of salt & pepper. Using a bit of the duck fat left over from making confit, I seared them for about 3 minutes per side then baked as directed. Fantastic! I cut each breast into slices at an angle, and served them atop wild mushroom polenta. It's totally foolproof, and I will do it again for sure!

Amazing results with barely any effort. Will make it again and again. Used duck fat to brush slices of fennel on the grill, and the rest was used to fry some garlic and previously cooked potato cubes sprinkled with rosemary. (It was a very nice Ramadan meal shared by the husband and i a few hours ago) .

This was a fabulous recipe with a few modifications of our own. We toasted the fennel seeds before crushing, to bring out a bit more intense flavor. I grilled the duck breasts on a kettle charcoal grill - first searing on all four sides, then moving them off the heat with the dome on and roasting until internal temp was about 135 for medium rare. Also, grilled sliced, fresh fennel bulb as a side. Served with rosemary polenta and a Central Coast Zinfandel.

I made this with duck legs, and just pressed the herb mixture onto the duck skin and meat. It smells divine and really comes out delicious. Got a lot of compliments. Served with arugula salad and some lentils.

I really liked this recipe. Made with a single 1 lb duck breast cut in half (for 2 people). Tender and flavorful -- good flavor combination. I love duck when it is not greasy and thought this was great. Served it with lentils -- to do again I would have cooked the lentils in some of the duck fat.

So easy and SO delicious! I made this for a first time duck eater to rave reviews. It was super simple and very flavorful, and a refreshing change from all the duck/fruit sauce recipes out there (although I love those too). I followed the recipe except that I took a little more time to render the fat in the skillet and roasted for a little less time. Next time I will reduce the cooking time even more, however, as I prefer my duck on the rare side. Also, do NOT discard the fat! Reserve it to use the next time you roast potatoes - divine!!!!!!!!!

Before this recipe I was not very fond of duck but thought I would give it another try. This recipe changed my mind!. I would serve this again, it was excellent.

Great dish, and really easy. Like some of the other reviewers, I was relieved to find a duck recipe which did not include fruit. Tonight I am going to try it with cumin seeds in place of the fennel seeds.

As I'm a duck lover to begin with, I had to give this one a try. My friends and I liked it very much. It's nice to find a duck recipe that's not loaded with sweet fruit sauces. It was delicious and eyecatching too. Would definately make again.

Very, very good but I recommend shortening the cook time somewhat. The duck ended up a bit dry.

Easy, delicious, made with simple (and not sweet) ingredients. Yummy. Served with couscous made using the poured off duck fat and dried cranberries. Will make again and again.

Simple simple simple. Most duck recipes have lots of fruit and/or sweetness, but this is interesting and different. Very Italian and classic.

Serve it with new potatoes & lemon, I will remember the recipe eventually.
