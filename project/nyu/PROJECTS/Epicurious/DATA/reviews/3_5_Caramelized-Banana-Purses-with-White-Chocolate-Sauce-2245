Underwhelming. The hazelnut crunch was yummy (and there were lots of leftover bits) but the banana filling was bland; it tasted better before the purses were baked. I used a dark chocolate sauce instead of the white, which made for a nice presentation. I wouldn't make this again, though.

Instead of the banana filling, I substituted the caramelized apple recipe from epicurious. Omitted the heavy cream, used half light brown sugar, half white sugar, added cinnamon and toasted walnuts and pistachios. Served with ice cream on the side. Fantastic.

Sorry to be the voice of dissent, but I was underwhelmed by this. I didn't like the flavor of the bananas - I prefer the rum, brown sugar & banana combo of Bananas Foster. The crumble, I thought, was not anything special. The bundle idea is a great one, just not with the filling... Sorry!

I make this every year for a Christmas Eve "champagne and dessert" party. Every year when I send out party invitations, I get several people asking, "Are you making the banana thing again... you have to!" A real crowd pleaser! I make the choc. sauce and crumble 1 day in advance.

Fabulous and gourmet stuff, my husband's words. So, a keeper. I do agree with the other reviewer that the butter can be cut down a lot both in the filling and in the phyllo dough. I added 1.5 cups or a little more of the crumble in the filling because it seemed very liquidy, which in turn gave me 16 of the purses/packets. This also could be because it was my first time with the phyllo dough. Once again, a terrific dessert!

This was wonderful. Made it last night. To see how to make filo purses, go to athens.com--they give directions and drawings. Tried it as directed in recipe, but folded too small, so used 3 sheets layered on each other and folded in each side to make a square, then gathered together to make a purse. Next time I will use 4 sheets as a few of mine tore and some of the filling leaked out. Also used a chocolate ganache instead of the sauce in recipe. Lastly, tasted the filling before baking and did not like it, but after baking the flavors just meld beautifully. Like bananas foster in fillo. Will definitely make again.

Whoo-eee! This would be a great entertaining recipe -- very impressive, and you can make ahead. Lime juice added an interesting flare to the dish -- I wouldn't leave it out. Served this with dark chocolate sauce (homemade) and it was really great. Definitely not sure what a "purse" is -- I tried different shapes and a "packet" seemed to work best, with all four corner folded flat, into the center.

This was one of the best desserts I've ever made (and I'm a serious dessert chef). They looked beautiful and tasted wonderful! I served them with a mango sorbet and some slices of fresh kiwi and the combination was excellent!

Oh wow, this was just too yummy for words!! Make sure you use ripe bananas to get that great banana flavor. For all of you looking at the amount of butter in this recipe & cringing, you can cut waaay back. Since it was my first time through I made it as directed, but still did not use all of the butter on the phyllo. Next time I will use less for the sauce as well. Make sure you spread out the hazelnut crumble as much as possible on your cookie sheet, I didn't and mine ended up too thick. I would also chop the hazelnuts more than "coarsely". Had a ton of hazelnut crumble leftover, would be great over ice cream. To the cook who wants to use pineapple in this, I am thinking that would be too juicy and messy inside the phyllo. Everybody at my dinner party thought this was fabulous, even people that weren't big desert eaters.

This recipe is great and very impressive. Your guests will think you spent all day on it. I love recipes that you can make in advance and then just pop in the oven.

These "caramelized banana purses" came out very well! And the recipe really isn't as time-consuming as it at first appears to be. Especially since making the White Chocolate Sauce is trivial. They serve up pretty - though I could have used a photo to see what exactly a "purse" of phyllo dough looks like. There was a little too much tang from the lime juice for my liking, especially since the bananas have a fairly mild flavor by the time that they're baked. Next time, I'll use less lime juice. I wasn't sure about the hazelnut crumble flavor, but it ends up pairing very well with the white chocolate sauce. The tang from the lime juice makes me think that these would work well with fresh pineapple -- leave out the lime juice, and combine pineapple with the caramel??
