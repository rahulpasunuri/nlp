I really liked these. Increased the applesauce to 1 1/8 C and also added 1/2 t cinnamon as others suggested. Nice, plump and moist. Took the whole 25 minutes baking time for me.

A tasty, easy-to-make recipe. I looked at the review and also added a little extra applesauce, did 1/2 cup wheat flour and 1 cup flour, and added cinnamon and cloves (forget exactly how much)--which was brilliance, by the way. My kitchen smelled like Christmas, and the spices just added savoryness. Mmm. For the cereal I used Post cranberry almond bran cereal, and instead of apples I used mostly blueberries and some more dried cranberries. So it sounds like I pretty much completely changed the recipe, but I guess it goes to show that you just use what you have and out of the oven comes something fantastic. But yeah, definitely check these at 15 minutes. Delicious!

These are SO simple to make, and tasty!! I put in 1.5x the applesauce, and they were nice and moist. But definitely check after 15 - 20 minutes!! Mine were done in 20. I substituted raisins for apples because that's what I had, but I'll try apples next time, with a little cinnamon, too.

These are a hit in my family, given their healthy profile. I have been making these for years now, and agree that paper liners stick too much to the finished muffin. I prefer bran flakes and add walnuts for a little crunch.

I split the flour with whole wheat and used 3/4 cup blueberries instead of dried apples. The blueberries added a little more moisture and the whole wheat flour gave the muffins better texture.

I've yet to make a bran muffin that I would consider "delicious. " This recipe is good. I used 1 Cup cake flour and 1/2 Cup Wheat flour. I also used sweetened, chunky applesauce and a 1/2 tsp. cinnamon. I used dried cranberries in place of the apples. Oh, and I greased and floured the muffin tin. They slid right out. This is a good recipe.

These muffins are good and easy to make, but in my opinion they need more apples and could be more moist. After making them once before, I doubled the dried apples and the applesauce and added a 1 tsp cinnamon and a little extra brown sugar to compensate for the bitterness of the cinnamon. I also cut the baking time by at least 5 minutes so they would be more moist. They came out really great.

Used 1 cup flour and 1/2 cup wheat flour instead. Also substituted dried cranberries & pecans for the apples. I thought it turned out very tasty!

These came out yummy, but with a few very important modifictions! I used one cup all purpose flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat, 1/2 cup dried apples and 1/4 dried cranberries, and I added 1 tsp ground cinnamon and a couple of dashes of ground cloves. MOST IMPORTANT THOUGH, check these after 15 minutes!!! They baked very fast and started smelling done way before the 25 minute time in the recipe! I had a few with burt bottoms, but saved the rest with my accurate sense of smell! Give them a try, I loved them and so did my kids.

This is a simple and satisfying muffin. I used dried cranberries and apricots instead of the apples. The result was wonderful. They freeze well.

Taste was OK; not too sweet, which I liked. Texture was a little rubbery, and they burned on the bottom.

It was tasty enough to make them once. But the bran cereal was just kind of gummy and the overall eating experience was nothing to write home about.

These muffins were very moist and tasted great despite being pretty healthy! After reading the reviews, I added a tps of cinnamon, used two fresh apples and added about 1/3 cup of finely chopped pecans which added a lot of flavour! I used muffin paper cups and the muffins stuck pretty badly- next time, I think I will just put the batter directly into a greased muffin pan. These do freeze well for a great mid-week reheat breakfast!

Great basic recipe! I think these taste great and are very healthy. I was out of dried apples so I used equal amounts dates, dried cranberries, and dried apricots, and they were still a hit!

Very good-- I've made these many times. I added currants and a dash of cinnamon for more flavor and texture. Sometimes, if I'm not concerned with the calories, I'll add chopped nuts & about 2 Tbs. molassas--YUM!

Easy to make recipe, very tasty and you can hardly tell it's good for you! Great change for breakfast or chilly afternoon snack with hot tea...

This was a successful treat for our family. It was nothing incredible, just really good. I've got a very finicky five year old who ate it with no complaint and normally hates muffins. The toddler got into the plate of muffins and ran off with one to chow down on as I was typing this. I did add a bit more brown sugar and no bran cereal. The recipie was very easy to make. It's taste is simple and good. I think these are well on their way to being a household favorite.

I followed the recipe because it was the 1st time I was making these muffins. I substituted the apples for dates and baked in a 7 x 12 in. pan. I sprinkled the top with walnuts and chocolate chips (not so low fat anymore...). The texture is fine, but the dough is somewhat bland. The next time I make it, I will add orange peels and spices, as well as more brown sugar.

These make a great breakfast-on-the-run. I make these on a regular basis at our house. They are nice and moist, but don't bake a minute over the recommended time like I accidentally did once. They don't taste as well over-baked!

It was wonderful you could not even tell it was low-fat

Somewhat bland. Needs something else.
