Excellent and easy recipe. I added a few twists. I used peach nectar instead of apple juice. I also added some honey and cut down some of the sugar. The peach nectar and honey added some nice, complex flavors.

Easy and delicious. I made this to give to friends along with some homemade cranberry sauce and pear butter. It is easy, simple and delicious. Excellent with turkey and all the accompaniments.
