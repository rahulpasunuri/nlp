Alas, I agree with other reviewers--TOO MILD, especially for a recipe that looks like it will have some kick. Too much work and time in the kitchen for something I could barely taste.

Sorry, friends, I can't agree with the 3 1/2 average fork rating! In my opinion, this was a real waste of a good piece of wild salmon. I definitely do not agree that salmon is rich and meaty enough to stand up to this very assertive rub! Would be much better on chicken or pork.

I make this all the time now. Even the kids (7 and 5)gobble it up. I wipe the spice paste off theirs, but leave a thin layer on for the adults. Great!

The flavors were good, but the rub flaked off a lot during grilling. If I make it again I might try to make it into more of a baste than a rub, but that's just my taste.

I used the chili and sage rub on shrimp. They were delicious. I used white wine instead of verjus. I left the rub on for about an hour, threaded the shrimp onto skewers and cooked them a couple of minutes per side in a ridged grill pan. I look forward to trying the rub with salmon.

This is a fabulous recipe especially if you like spicy food. I used chipolte chili powder, which gives it a smoky flavor. What a great way to spice up a dish! And, so easy to make.

this recipe sounded better than it was. first of all, 1 tablespoon oil isn't enough to cook all the spices listed. it ended up being a gooey mess until i added the juice. i've had far better salmon recipes, but it's always good to try something new.

I made this recipe with a few variations. For the chili paste, I didn't have sage, so I didn't put any, and used cranberry juice and raspberry vinegar instead (all I had in my pantry) and it turned out great! Also, I made it on salmon and a pork chop. I have to say the pork chop came out absolutely great! while the salmon was good, I would def use the paste on pork chops next time.

I love this recipe; I'm a salmon nut, always scouring for new ways to prepare it. With one bite, this has become one of my favorites. You can tinker with the spices if you don't have enough or all of them in stock, but I find that following the recipe here yields a sure-fire product. Just delicious with saffron or wild rice or wasabi smashed potatoes.

A bit too mild. I made it two different ways, just like on the site and the second, I spiced it up a little by adding Cayenne pepper to the salmon AFTER I wiped the rub off and served it with some roasted chiles and garlic. That did it. By popular vote, everybody chose the spicier one. Otherwise, very simple and quick

I made this with apple juice in the rub. I also agree that it was too mild. Next time I will marinate overnight instead. The fish was cooked just right, and I don't know how to cook fish properly, so that means a lot!

Rating: 2
Like other cooks, I thought the taste was mild compared to what I had anticipated from making the rub. Kind of disappointing, but I'm not giving up on it. Next time I will try cooking it in the oven with the rub on, as others suggested.

I experimented on some friends with this recipe and I must say that it was a big hit. They were over as I cooked the paste, and I used apple cider vinegar instead of verjus, and it stank up the house--HOWEVER the finished product turned out to be SO delicious that they cleaned up the salmon, it was really great and a different tasting recipe, which is always refreshing, and it also had room to experiment. Definitely will make it again!

The heady aromas coming from the oven were just a preview of the wonderful tastes to come. I didn't completely remove all of the chili paste before cooking, but next time will leave a little more on. Cooked a 1.5" thick filet in 7 minutes at 375C using convection. Moist and delicious! Looking forward to preparing this recipe again next summer during wild salmon season.

This is a wonderful. Everyone that ate it loved it.

Fabulous! Served it over Coyote Cafe's Black Bean and Corn Salsa--the competing spices complimented each other beautifully and the champagne was the perfect finish.

I'm really not sure what the hype is about. I found this fish to be really boring. I'm sure that the taste has a lot to do with the chili powder you use, since chili powder can vary so much brand by brand.

So good.

A deliciously different taste for salmon! We used a 1 1/2 piece of fillet with the skin on. Cooked it skin side down on foil - on the grill. (easy clean up!). Incredibly moist. Following the queue of another reviewer, we also served it up with Southwestern Corn Pudding (on this website), and the Roasted Zucchini with Lemon( on this site). A great match.

I am an Alaska resident and I made this dish w/ fresh caught natural red salmon. I did not have vergus so I substituted w/ half apple cider vinegar, half apple juice. I also added 2 tablespoons of brown sugar to the chile paste. It was awesome. I paired this dish w/ the fresh corn pudding recipe on this site and my own stuffed zucchini recipe w/ diced roasted bell peppers and monterrey jack. It made an outstanding Southwestern themed menu that is now a permanent part of my salmon recipe collection.

The gravy for this recipe was beyond fragrant so I was very excited about this dish, however the finished product didn't deliver on the aroma! I think next time I'll grill the salmon rather than cook in a skillet. Also, I think I'll up the kosher salt. I refuse to give up on this recipe because I live by salmon!

I left the skin on the salmon and made this on the barbeque over indirect heat. It was great!

Excellent!

A few ingredient variations and baking without removing the paste and this dish was awesome! I didn't have fresh sage (or even dried, as it turned out) so I used poultry seasoning. I didn't know what verjus was, so I used white wine and a little cider vinegar. Then, after spraying a glass baking dish with cooking spray, I alternated fresh spinach leaves and sliced red bell pepper rosettes under and around the salmon, covered with foil and baked at 300 for about 30-40 min. Served with steamed cauliflower and a brown/wild rice medly. Beautiful colors and the most incredibly moist salmon I have ever tasted!

This is the second time I have made this recipe for Salmon with dinner guests, and it continues to be a big hit. The combined flavors of chili, fresh sage, cumin, and coriander make this dish one of our favorites...I served it with potatoes au gratin and a green vegetable (broccoli) and a waldorf salad! Huge success.

Both my husband and I thought this recipe tasted delicious. Because I prefer to follow a recipe exactly the first time I make it, I scraped the paste off and cooked the fillet in a skillet as instructed. The salmon was superb. I can see, however, that this recipe would probably do well with the paste left on and baked in the oven as other posters have done.

i used oj instead of cider (that's all i had) and it was still great!

I cooked it in the oven and left on the rub. The rub isn't too spicey but it was gritty. I think next time I'll wipe it off before cooking. It was good but not fabulous. I'll try it next time and grind my own coriander and cumin from the seed and use the New Mexico chile powder, maybe that will make it fabulous

Don't do what I did: I applied the rub, then cooked it the next night. Pheaugh.

I agree with leaving the rub on -- that was good advice. It also shortened the marinade time, making it a good weeknight meal. Well done!

i am a beginner cook, and this turned out really well! so i might be biased by my surprising success - but i really thought it was great, and so did my girlfriend. i left the rub on because i like a lot of flavor, and i am glad i did. it didn't overpower the salmon at all.

Excellent!

Good. Used apple cider, as did not have trendy verjus. Left on chili paste (why wipe off? It certainly wasn't too strong). Baked in 300° oven, as suggested in tester notes. Came out perfectly cooked and moist - much easier preparation and saved on fat, which I used in the garlic mashed potatoes I served as a side dish (yum).

I used prepared chili paste from an Asian supermarket with a little white wine. Cooks beware: the chili paste when cooked in a skillet smells BAD and good ventilation is required. It becomes a little like pepper spray as it heats. However the taste is really great, especially if you cook the salmon rare. Cornbread is a great side dish.

I thought this was good. I used apple cider vinegar instead of verjus. The rub was a little hard to wipe off before cooking so it got burned while cooking. I cooked it in a skillet, but I think it would be better broiled or BBQ'ed.

Yum!!! This is an excellent recipe. I made several changes to it: the biggest substition was the verjus. Verjus is hard to find, so I used 1/4 cup of lemon juice and 1/4 cup of white cooking wine for the chili paste. I did not marniate the salmon for 2 hours and remove the excess rub; in lieu I marinated for half an hour and left the rub on. This proved to be wise -- the rub did not overpower the taste of the salmon, but gave it instead the kick that I was looking for. Sweet cornbread and roasted vegetables made an excellent accompaniment.
