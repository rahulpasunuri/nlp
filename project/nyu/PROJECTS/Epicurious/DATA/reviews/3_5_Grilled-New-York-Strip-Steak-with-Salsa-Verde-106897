I found this to be okay, but slightly weird. The bread gave the "salsa" a weird texture. If I made it again, I would leave out the bread. But, I won't be making it again.

I purchase fine quality strip steaks which are normally cooked simply and served seasoned only with salt and pepper - why mess with a good thing? So I messed with a good thing, dressed the wonderful steaks with this salsa and made a good thing even better. Now if only Epicurious would shed these horrid 'Iceberg' ads...

This recipe is extremely simple and delicious!!! I made veggie kabobs and white rice along with the steaks and I sopped up as much sauce as I could with the rice and veggies. You could definetly impress friends with this recipe.

This was simple to make, very flavorful, and is beyond the ordinary.

My best steak experience ever! My only mistake was in using packaged bread crumbs instead of making my own. Also, this amount of steak fed two of us without any complaints. Regardless, this was wonderful and I'll make it again and again.
