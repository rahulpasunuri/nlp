i didn't have enough beans, so I also included onions and green pepper to make up the difference...it was AMAZING!! I really loved it, although I would say it makes 2 servings, not 4. no way would i split that between 4 people. it was way too delicious!

i used olive oil instead of butter, reduced the water to about 1/2 cup, used haricots vert and put all in a zip-lock to marinate for a couple of hours. very easy/very tasty.

I've made this recipe several times. I reduce the amount of butter and put all the ingredients in the pan at once to make for an even easier, healthier dish.

I've made this dish twice. The second time I liked it better because I parboiled the beans before transferring to pan. Diverging a bit from the recipe, I omitted the water. This allowed the spices and flavor to stick better to the beans. I also cooked them until they were a bit browned from sauteeing.

A simple but great change from plain old green beans. Jazzes them up with the curry and just a little butter. An easy weeknight side dish.
