Okay, I made a couple of substitutions, most notably kale for the watercress, canned beans instead of frozen and forgot the Kalamata olives so I used canned black ones. Still, I don't think this recipe suits my palate. My vegetarian daughter will enjoy it though, so it wasn't a complete waste. I just don't think adhering to the recipe would have changed my opinion. The corn, however, turned out great and I will use this method to grill corn (as opposed to in the husk) from now on.

This the ultimate summer dish-we LOVED it. Used all Farmers Market fresh vegetables. I did make a few substitutions: used spinach in place of watercress; used smoked farmers cheese in place of parmesan. Awesome dish--will definitely make again and again! Oh yeah- I also made the roasted red pepper sauce, as suggested--it is fabulous too. Great on grilled shrimp, which accompanied our salad.

Excellent side dish for your summer cook out. I used edamame beans and spinach instead of lima beans and watercress. Used good quality freshly grated parmesan cheese to make this salad really tasty. Grilled corn in their husks is also recommended:) Don't leave out the roasted red pepper and tomato sauce because it really does compliment the salad and is easy to prepare.

Fabulous! Every time I make this salad I am asked for the recipe. If I can't find watercress I use baby spinach.

I followed others suggestion and used edamame and this is a family favorite. I wouldn't skip the sauce because it really complements the recipe. This is a great dish for potlucks. People think I'm a great cook when I bring this; and with two young kids... "easy" is the key.

This was very good. I used edamame instead of lima beans. I also used the miso dressing from another salad. But I really enjoyed the flavors.

I tripled the recipe for a dinner party we had this weekend. The salad is fantasitic. We used goat cheese as opposed to parm, but I imagine either would be great... Definately worth trying. Easy to do with great results.

This salad was MARVELOUS! It tastes like summer! I made it without the red pepper/tomato sauce and just added a little more oil and vinegar. The only addition I might make would be a little Italian parsley.

This salad is fabulous. My husband says, "You can make this again!", his seal of approoval. I did use sweet soybeans instead of limas in my effort to incorporate soy into our diets.

We are a family of six children are ages two to 16. Everyone loved the dish. It is sort of "soupy" So good though. Wow.

I brought this dish with me to a work BBQ last Sunday & it was an absolute hit! I've had several people ask for the recipe. I used the goat chz, which I felt was a nice compliment to the olives.

A great summer salad! Wasn't sure about the lima beans, but a nice texture and color to the dish. Next time, I'd leave out the olives. They were a little overpowering and their color didn't add anything positive to the presentation. The red pepper sauce was great!

Wonderful summer salad. Instead of removing the corn from the cob, try slicing the cob into six pieces. It gives the salad a beautiful presentation, and still has the fun appeal of eating corn from the cob. The dressing was a little too oily, so I doctored it up a little with more vinegar and fresh herbs. I also skipped the cheese and it was still a great salad.

My rating and review are for the Gazpacho which I have made from the recipe in the magazine. Excellent! Would love to have you correct the mistake and give us the right recipe for our recipe box.

I thought this was a very nice and summer-y side dish. I completely forgot about the red-pepper sauce so will try that next time; but it was fine without it. We paired the salad with the cowboy rub (from the July issue) on porterhouses and it was delicious. Oh, add the shallot dressing as you go and it will keep for a day ot two in the fridge if you aren't feeding 8...yum!

Does anyone from Epicurious "management" monitor the rating situation? I almost passed over the recipe because it said at the top that only 50% would make it again. That seemed a little odd, since the recipe sounded good. So for a change (I don't usually spend time on poorly reviewed recipes) I scrolled down and discovered that there were only two reviews, and both loved this dish. What's up?

This was delicious with the smothered pork chops. We used goat cheese with great success. we also made the zucchini with cilantro cream to go with it all as we're trying to stay away from most starches, Superb!

I'd give this a 3+ actually, and I don't give those very often. This dish was sooooo good, attractive, and the red pepper sauce complimented it wonderfully. Would be great w/out the sauce too. The only change I made was to use (frozen) edamame (boiled till crisp/tender) instead of lima beans, but they look similar and I prefer the taste of edamame to lima beans (probably healthier to boot?) I didn't make the cowboy steaks (on the cover with this salad) so I'm interested to hear reviews on that recipe. I served this with grill ribeye steak with a roquefort/port/shallot compound butter. EXCELLENT!
