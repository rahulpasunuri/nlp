I was expecting a sweeter bread. Flavors were blah. I would have added more salt.

This bread was much to salty and if I were to make it again I would omit the salt because there is enough in the baking soda. The orange and molasses flavors didn't come out as much as I was hoping.

This bread is not a dessert bread, despite the molasses, etc. My brother-in-law, a dyed-in-the-wool molasses lover liked it but said it tasted "healthy" and he would prefer to eat it toasted for breakfast rather than a treat. Nothing wrong with any of those comments, just not what I was expecting.

Although its name led me to expect a sweet, cake-like taste, I was pleased by the old-fashioned hearty flavor of this bread. It was quick and easy to prepare, and the combination of the two flours and cornmeal gave it a nice texture. I did not have aniseed so I left it out, and I squeezed 2-3 Tbsp. of orange juice into the batter along with the peel. This bread would serve as an ideal accompaniment to an earthy winter stew or soup.
