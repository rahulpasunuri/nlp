I did 3.5 tablespoons jasmine tea leaves to get the flavor more intense. Lovely amuse bouche to cleanse palet between courses

used Two Leaves and a bud tea (www.twoleavesandabud.com). They are a local tea company and talk about high-quality tea!! The sachets worked really well for me and I think next time I will try the sorbet with their Earl Grey

A recipe is not a step by step instruction, only a basic way to setup a food. It requires some imagination, and the idea that you already know something about the food you are cooking and its ingredients. One should always use filtered water. NEVER boil or use boiling water when making tea. You want to steep it rather than cook it. Cooking tea makes it bitter. Always use a ceramic pot to steep your tea. metal is reactive and can make the tea taste metallic, not a good thing when using an ingredient as delicate as tea. Never forget to taste your product along every step along the way. if what you are cooking doesn't taste right fix it.

The quality of the tea makes all the difference. Using tea bags and the like will not give you satisfactory results. I can recommend adagio.com - you get whole leaves, which unfurl and release tremendous flavor. They recommend a specific water temp. and steeping time for maximum results. I used a melon black tea, and will try green tea next week. A friend and I are going to serve this as a twist on a High Tea. We found this interesting and refreshing, although I may use a little less sugar and see how that works. Fresh herbs would also be fun - a good use for the applemint taking over the backyard!

This didn't freeze well in my ice cream maker and I ended up with big ice crystals -- a granita, as another reviewer put it. I thought this was overly sugary, but I sprinkled with some fresh mint which gave a nice contrast and cut the sweetness. The idea is interesting, but it's a lot easier to serve hot (or iced) green tea.

This sorbet had a very bitter, unpleasant aftertaste. I will not be using this recipe again, but if I was, I would steep the tea for 3 minutes, drain the tea, and then add the sugar. Green tea usually gets bitter very quickly...

This recipe _can_ be successfully adapted to other kinds of tea like Earl Grey-- the trick is to know your tea, and use high quality whole leaf tea as suggested in the recipe. The recipe doubles the strength of the tea, but to make tea stronger, you can't just let it steep twice as long-- you have to double the amount of leaves, and steep only for the usual amount of time. For Tazo teabags, which have a fine dust-like tea in them (flavor is released quicker the finer the leaf size), this means you want about 6-7 teabags to steep for no longer than 2-2 1/2 minutes.

Hey, here's a thought... if you don't use any of the ingredients called for in the recipe, you can't complain when it doesn't come out tasting right! GET A GRIP, PEOPLE.

I tried to make this using Tazo Earl Grey (two bags), and it came out far too strong and sugary. I will try again with Jasmine. I put it in an ice cream maker, but the texture isn't very sorbet-like.
