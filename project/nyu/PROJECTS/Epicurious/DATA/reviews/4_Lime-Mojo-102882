Our favorite use for this is on grilled Mahimahi fillets. I make extra each time, using it as both a marinade and (with a less oil) as sauce. My wife, who is not a fish lover, asks for this regularly.

I used this as directed for the pork loin with lime mojo. The dish was great, largely due to this delicious sauce. I heated the oil to 170 and took off heat. (No oil splattered as someone else reported. Their oil was too hot.) I only used 1/2 cup of oil, per suggestion below. After adding the other ingredients, the amount seemed small. I made the mistake of adding cold oil to the mix. DON'T DO THAT! It wouldn't mix in. I used that for the marinade anyhow. It was fine. It would have been bad to serve with the meat, however. Even with 1 cup of oil (only short 1/2 cup) I only had 1 1/2 cups of mojo. I had to repeat the process the next day to serve with the dish. As the reviewer from Calgary suggested, double this recipe. NOTE: I only used 1/2 cup of oil for the second batch to serve with the meat. That was perfect. More would have been too oily.

Have used this marinade for chicken and pork. No need to heat the oil or use as much oil as the recipe calls for (1/4 cup oil should be plenty.) Simply toss all of the ingredients together and marinate your meat in a bowl or ziplock bag. Enjoy!

This is a great recipe and the flavour is fantastic! The only thing I did not like about this recipe was that the measurements are off. I followed this recipe exactly and it only yielded 1 1/2 cups of mojo, which is far from 2 3/4 cups. If you are making this mojo for the slow roasted pork recipe then you'll need to double your ingredients.

Excellent marinade!! Added juice from three oranges for a citrus twist, turned out wonderful. Marinated a london broil for 24 hrs +, then grilled over charcoil.....yum! Can't wait to use if for chicken and pork loin.

CAUTION: Today after adding the vinegar directly to the hot oil it began to bubble and then it exploded sending hot oil all over the room and my arms! This did not happen the first time I made it. The only explanations I can think of is that the oil was too hot and/or I should have added all the ingredients to the oil in the order specified. I will make it again though

This is amazing. Have put it on everything since we had the dinner party. Maybe use a bit less oil, but it is just really, really good.

Would this sauce work with chicken or fish or is it too robust? We don't eat meat, but the reviews are so positive that I'm intrigued.

Served this at a party of 60 last week, with the slow-roasted Cuban pork, Cuban black beans, saffron rice and the Green Salad with Orange Vinaigrette. Many requests for all recipes - some said the best meal they'd had in years.

Fabulous. If you can not get a reservation at Patria this is what you should make.

Excellent sauce on any pork cut; I first made it with a pork butt roast slow-baked in a cast iron dutch oven -- tender, juicy, and just the right bite! I didn't have jalapenos, so I substituted dried chipotle chile peppers, and it added an excellent contrast to the spice rub.

No one told me that you need to wear some type of gloves when cutting and seeding jalepeno chilies. My hands were on fire for two days after preparing this marinade! Also, I eliminated the cilantro because it's the only herb that I cannot abide.

My husband loves sauces with a kick to them. This one really fits the bill. It makes a delicious dipping sauce as well as a really nice marinade for pork. I loved it as a condiment served at the table. Definitely a keeper. I'll use it often.

Wonderful flavors. This is the marinate for Slow-roasted pork (January 2000 Bon Appetit)and the sauce that is served with it. This is going to be a keeper recipe.
