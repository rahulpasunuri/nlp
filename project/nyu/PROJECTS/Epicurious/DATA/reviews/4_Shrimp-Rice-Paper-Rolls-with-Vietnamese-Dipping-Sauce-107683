Delish! I am weary of people who make subs and don't like it AND I made subs and it was still great! Had Tofu instead of shrimp and big wide rice noodles rather than the Maifun. It was still all good. The sauce is a perfect accompaniment!

Okay, these tasted great, but did anyone have trouble with the rice paper? Mine were STICKY and really hard to peel off the dish towels. Tried soaking for less time and that did not make a difference. Any suggestions? Love them, other than the fact they were not very pretty.

This is ridiculous. All 66 reviews are from the same person. Will someone at epicurious please fix the review process so that one person does not keep submitting his/her review repeatedly; otherwise the rating percentiles and fork ratings are meaningless and unhelpful -- as in this case.

This is a really great basic Nuoc Cham recipe but there are few different tweaks you can do. For one, adding a half cup of brown sugar and reducing it for 20 minutes will give it a molasses like consistency that really goes great with fried fish. You can check out more recipes and applications http://www.getsauceynow.com. Vietnamese food and Nuoc Cham is really easy to make and versatile to use.

This is so good, so good for you. Don't worry if you dont have everything for the rolls themselves  fine to make with a few less items. used carrots, cabbage, shrimp, cukes, rice noodles and that was plenty. make the sauce as directed but with less sugar per other reviewers  more like 2 tbs. Perfect summer dinner for two if you make about 1/3 of the recipe (4 big rolls per).

a MUST do recipe! Made these for a recent Thai dinner party I had and my guests all raved about the dipping sauce. The sauce looked like one you would find in a great restaurant. Will make this again and again.....

These are AWSOME. I modified the dipping sauce -- I added sesame oil & grated ginger to taste. My family thinks I am truly a wonderful mother, at least when I make these for dinner. GREAT idea for left over meats: just marinate left over meat in the dipping sauce for at least a half hour before using.

The dipping sauce in this recipe is for deep fried spring rolls, and not the cold salad rolls. The Vietnamese restaurants that I have gone to always serve the cold salad rolls with Hoisin sauce.

This is a great recipe. The sauce is excellent. I change the ingredients inside each time depending on what we have on-hand and how much time I have to make it. Even my 5-year old eats it - It's fun to make the wraps by herself.

This is exactly what I was looking for. Dipping sauce is excellent (I added less sugar but still yum). My mung beans hadn't sprouted in time, so I added bean sprouts instead. Loved the trip of fresh herbs (I used thai basil) and though I bought cucumber, I forgot to add it! Didn't miss it though. I would also shred the carrots next time since they tended to poke holes in my rice paper wraps! Need more practice on wrapping but great recipe!

This was a delicious recipe! Be sure to let the dipping sauce sit for AT LEAST half an hour to let the flavors develop. It was slightly too sweet for my taste, next time I will reduce the sugar by a Tbs. Despite its sweetness, the sauce is light and refreshing! The rolls are also wonderful. The herbs can be adjusted to fit personal preference (I left out the mint). Next time I will shred the carrots because my knife skills are not amazing and my carrots ended up a little too chunky for the rolls.

I beleive the great sauce debate can only be answered if one clarifies as to whether they are referring to Northern or Southern Vietnam as the taste varies. Overall, wonderful dish! I have seen saland rolls served with either sauce and love them both. Nuoc mam is my favorite, wonderful job!

Having traveled extensively in Vietnam, I have never seen fresh spring rolls served with Hoisin sauce. This is exactly the kind of sauce served with these rolls in Vietnam.

I want to thank A Cook who on 4/1/08 pronounced this recipe terrible without ever tasting it. It seems that most other reviewers gave it a 3 or 4 tine rating. Stop being so busy with what you expect and enjoy what you've got. I made this recipe for a group of international friends who all found it outstanding. Make these and ENJOY!

The sauce is delicious! I bet it would be good with Asian dumplings, too. I just threw together some spring rolls with veggies I had on hand (fresh basil, celery leaves, lettuce, spring onion and strips of carrot and kohlrabbi) and used this sauce. Instant appetizer for Friday nite cocktails before dinner!

We all enjoyed this though we used smaller rice papers, which was good as I don't think that I would have wanted to try to cut them. I made 1/2 with and 1/2 without the mushrooms and am not sure that they really added anything.

Wait, this doesn't make sense. I've never seen this type of spring roll served with this type of sauce. Fresh spring rolls are usually served with hoisin sauce. If you make this for your Viet friends, be warned that they will look at you funny for making this pairing! (Fried spring rolls go with this type of sauce).

Next time when writing a Vietnamese recipe, why not use the Vietnamese word for fish sauce (nuoc mam) instead of the Thai word? This recipe is for Vietnamese cuisine, after all, and it's annoying to see it referred to by a Thai name.

These are very good and taste very fresh and healthy. They are a lot of work but most of it can be made ahead of time which is something to take advantage of. There's a lot to stuff the rolls with so overstuffing will make them very difficult to roll and handle. I ended up only cutting them in half instead of in thirds and they were hard to dip without all the stuff falling out. I would use crushed garlic instead of minced next time for the sauce. I just think it would blend better and would taste better. But the sauce is nice even the way it is. I didn't realise how much work these rolls would be but after having made them I now know in future if I made them again I would make them in advance.

loved it. Taste very similar to the rolls I purchased from Chop Chop - a small takeaway store in Sydney Australia - www.chopchop-online.com.au . the Chop Chop rolls were the best I have tasted anywhere.

Loved this, perfect for a hot summer night. I made this dipping sauce as well as a orange and red pepper salsa also available at Epi- my husband loved it all.

The sauce was just what I was looking for, however I used less sugar and less lime juice - because I only had one lime - it was fine. I also used snow pea spouts in the rolls instead of mung beans/daikon and left out the rice sticks - aiming for a more low carb recipe

A fantastic and healthy dish. I like to make this for small dinner parties but leave the assembly to the guests. Arrange all the filling ingredients on platters and have a couple bowls of warm water for dipping the rice paper, that way people can add what they like and it's much more fun. I usually serve this with a noodle soup and it is always a big hit.

Ya know, these are the best things ever! Had a roommate from Vietnam and we reviewed the ingredients in the wraps and sauce and she (and I) wouldn't change a thing! Rice paper can be hard to work with if you leave it in the water too long, so just dunk it til wet and lay on flat surface and rub excess water in. That way, you can wrap with ease and it won't fall apart. (make sure the rice paper is white and fresh, not yellowed = tough). People-pleaser recipe.

Ran out of time making appetizers for a party, so just put this together as a "slaw" without using the rice paper wrappers or noodles. Everyone liked it; had several requests for the recipe.

I was happier with the rolls than the sauce. I don't think the rolls were conduscive to a toothpick-appetizer style, as when I cut mine the fillings really didn't stay in well (even on my better rolls!), which meant that it was hard to get an acceptable amount of the sauce on the roll. My favorite sauce for these is hoisin anyway, so perhaps I'm biased. Regardless, the sauce was fun and different, and the rolls were fabulous. The ten second rule is great advice, though some will require about 15 seconds.

A bit labor intensive, but well worth it. Dipping sauce was excellant...fresh lime juice is a must!

I make these all of the time, our pantry is full of, (what the neighbors call "different"), spices, etc. so on the spot making is a breeze for me. I have also found that the 6 P's come into play with this dish. Prep all the steps ahead of time or you will be tired by the time you serve. Make the dipping sauce that morning and serve it tonight. The one addition I would make is to sprinkle chopped fried shallots in the roll. The product comes in a jar and is easy to find in most any Asian market. Very enjoyable, (!) and true to the culture.

Fabulous! We did the whole wine pairing using the other recipes from Bon Appetit February 2003 and it turned out great. Everyone loved this dish.

This is THE recipe that got me hooked on Asian cooking. I've made them several times, always to rave reviews. The sauce is to die for, and I've used it in other dishes as well. They're fun to wrap! The fresh herbs make the flavors complete. I agree with the earlier review that fewer noodles make them easier to roll and tastier as well. I usually make two additional sauces - a peanut sauce and a soy/oyster/chile/garlic sauce with a touch of honey. With the trio of sauces, the rice paper rolls make a truly impressive appetizer on a buffet or as a passed item. Bravo!

Although the recipe is time consuming, most of the preparation can be done in advance. The dipping sauce is delicious. I had no problem with the rice paper - I only soaked the sheets about ten seconds each. They are rolled up just like a burrito. My kids didn't care for the basil and mint, but otherwise the recipe was a hit!

This was great-- I made it to bring to a party and it got rave reviews. At first, I was worried about how these would hold up if made several hours ahead, but decided to take the plunge after reading all of these glowing reviews.... I'm glad I did. A few tips-- after making a couple precisely according to directions, I decided to reduce the amount of noodles in each roll a bit-- the rolls seemed clunkier, harder to roll, and more prone to breaking with the full amount. I also cut the rolls in half instead of thirds-- they seemed easier to manage as cocktail fare with one closed end-- and because I had reduced the noodles, they weren't too big this way. As for the wraps-- after working with a few, I learned that if I took them out of the water just before they seemed really ready, that sitting on the damp cloth the few hard spots would soften up as I assembled the fillings and I could always apply extra water to any that didn't. This made the rolls much stronger as I rolled them, and much easier to roll tightly. I found that if the wraps had soaked a bit too long, they would not roll easily and were more prone to splitting. Once I figured out these few things, these were a breeze to assemble, and came out looking and tasting wonderful.

Absolutely delicious. Made them for the 3rd time yesterday for a crowd of 70 and it was a favorite. Dipping sauce is a riot of flavor. Haven't made them yet with shrimp and shitakes--have always made them with shredded chicken and no mushrooms--but next time I'll try it as written. Make ahead note: if you wrap each roll loosely in damp paper towel, and then again in plasic wrap, they taste JUST as delicious and fresh 24 hours later; all the veggies are crunchy and bright and the wraps are moist with a chewy bite AND they're much easier to slice, too.

This review is mostly on the dipping sauce, which was perfect! Exactly what I was looking for. I altered the rolls a bit to match my menu more closely - added scallops, and pan seared both after marinating them for a few minutes in a tablespoon or so in the dipping sauce. They were excellent this way. Didn't use the maifun noodles and altered some of the vegetables (no cucumber, added red bell pepper - however, I would not substitue the use of shitakes, as they were excellent!). On the rice paper sheets- I found that only a few seconds in water was needed, and I used 2 for each roll as the vegetables tended to poke through - this didn't make them too thick. Also live in the bay area and yes, rice paper sheets are hard to find!

Great recipe. Got the rice paper in a Japanese store and had the cashier ask me whether I knew what to do with them! My co-cook didn't like cilantro, so I left it out, and the rolls were great without as well. Also, I tried to emulate the Vietnamese peanut sauce that usually comes with it and it was more popular than the fish dipping sauce - which was great as well.

I made this but left out the mushrooms and basil upon the advice of a Vietnamese co-worker. Everyone loved them and wanted the recipe - all were eaten. The rice papers are hard to find even in S.F. CA chinatown! For the rice papers use water that is only slightly warm. And 30 seconds is way too long. Just submerge in and out, just enough to get wet. It will continue to soften out of the water. I put the rice paper on a plastic cutting board and gave it one quick blot with a cotton towel (not terry). When putting them on a platter, do not let them touch or they will stick together.

This is the best spring roll (+ sauce) recipe I have found! I know others change things, but my husband and I absolutely love them just the way they are. The biggest challenge for me was trying to find a grocery store that carries the rice papers. Excellent as an appetizer or I make them as dinner along with spicy tuna hand rolls.

These were excellent, but a lot of work. The dipping sauce was perfect. Next time I make them I will save time by grating the cucumber and carrots, and could easily leave out the mung bean sprouts and/or mushrooms, if they are not your favorite. The rice paper was not bad to work with once I got the hang of it. Yummy and very impressive appetizer to take to a gathering!

Served these rolls last night at a party to rave reviews. This is a very versatile recipe; don't fret if you can't find or don't like one of the ingredients. I added mint, serrano chiles and Thai chiles to the sauce and also made it several hours in advance (I think this diminishes the off-putting fishy smell of the fish sauce). The rolls are labor-intensive but worth it in the end!

Clean, full of texture & taste - this recipe is aWEsome. I've since modified the [awesome] sauce by blending a whole lime (skin & all) with proportionate garlic cloves (i'm a garlicaholic), jalapeno & the remaining sauce ingredients. This makes the sauce more substantial, less soupy. And then just for the convienence of travel i put this mixture right into the rolls. No dipping required. YUM.

This is the Vietnamese Spring Roll Recipe I have been looking for. I usually don't change ingredients on a recipe the first time I try it, but this time I did. The spring rolls that we get in local restaurants have only cilantro in them, no mint or basil. I left these ingredients out and my search for an authentic spring roll has ended. Thank You! I would recommend this recipe enthusiastically.

These were a huge hit! Everyone asked for the recipe! A few things...I used grilled chicken instead of shrimp and it tasted great. I had trouble getting the rice paper to roll tightly without ripping, so they were a little loose. As a result I only cut each roll in half rather then thirds so that the filling wouldn't fall out. The recipe is simple to make but labour intensive-- it took me about an hour from start to finish to put everything together--but well worth it. Enjoy!

This recipe is awesome. The dipping sauce is so good. I had to use red chile paste instead of the jalapeno and I had to leave out the cucumber and rice sticks from the rolls, but it was excellent. My mother and brother said it was like a party in your mouth, so many nice flavors. Definately worth the effort and I have made the sauce three times already - it tastes good on rice.
