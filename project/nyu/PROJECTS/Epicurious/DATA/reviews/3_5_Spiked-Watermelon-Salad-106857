Please, if you replace an ingredient then hate the recipe: do not rate it. People like me usually look for recipes with 4-fork reviews before we try something out. To the person who substituted key lime for lemon, no wonder it tasted weird. This is a fabulous, elegant summer dessert and the flavors are spot on. Highly recommended as a dinner party dessert for dairy allergic friends.

The cassis took this to delicious! Who knew?! A friend, not knowing about the fact that I made this, brought a non-spiked watermelon salad and everyone was happy!

I used Chambord because I couldn't find cassis in the grocery store. I tried to chop up the mint as fine as possible. Still, I was definately not a fan of the pieces of mint on my watermelon, thus the 2 forks.

This was great! I actually made it into a blender drink for a pool party. I followed the recipe exactly and just put the finished product in the freezer and then put it in a blender. HUGE hit.

This recipe is awesome and so very easy to prepare. The one negative reviewer stated that she followed the recipe exactly, however, admitted in the same comment that she subsituted key lime juice for fresh lemon. (????????) There is a difference. This dish will always recieve rave reviews.

I have made this salad several times (for July 4th BBQ, picnics/cookouts, a bridal shower, etc). Everytime it is a HUGE success. Everyone loves it. The other great thing--it's easy to make.

Great and SO easy. I left out the creme de cassis (didn't have any) and still got rave reviews. Perfect for a buffet--can eat it as a fruit salad or refreshing dessert.

I can't believe I am the first negative review. I followed the recipe exactly, except for substituting about 1/4 cup of key lime juice for an equal amount of lemon juice. The finished product just wasn't particularly good and the creme de cassis gave it an odd flavor. Plain watermelon chunks would have been better.

I made this for a "bring whatever you want" sort of party, and the hostess had done a watermelon with just vodka. No comparison! Also this was pretty with the mint leaves, and I carved the melon into a basket using instructions from "fabulousfood.com." Easy! If you screw it up you can just ditch that and use a bowl, but it really wasn't hard to do. Looked great! Tasted yummy!

A great way to use less than perfect watermelon. So refreshing.

Ridiculously easy, and just delicious. Ingredient proportions are just right, and even the teetotalers among us loved this. Tastes like far more work went into the dish than actually did!

I just made this for my family for my daughter's going away to college dinner. My family raved about it. I couldn't find creme de cassis, so I used vodka kurrant(sp?). I had no leftovers. I will definitely keep this for a summer recipe.

Super-easy, and if you don't think about the booze, it feels downright healthy. I brought this to a BBQ and the guests raved about it and took seconds, and thirds. We acted like we were at a frat party with a spiked watermelon - what fun! The mint is the perfect complement to the fruit. This DOES NOT store well, so eat up and enjoy!

This is such a refreshing summery dessert, and a unique presentation of watermelon for your party friends who don't mind a little spiking--it really isn't that strong.

A quote from one of our guests "This watermelon salad alone was worth the 30 minute drive"

This is fabulous! The perfect ending to any summer meal. I made melon balls instead of cutting it in squares for a nicer presentation. Served it in a glass goblet. It was great paired with a brownie. I will be making this repeatedly this summer.

This was so excellent. I made it for a birthday BBQ for my husband's birthday. After the melon was gone, he ended up drinking the juice/booze straight from the bowl!! Mikey liked it! I would definately make it again.

My family, which considers themselves epicurians raved about this and all of them called me for the recipe later. This one will surprise you!

A great picnic or cottage dessert or treat. Very refreshing and not too boozy. Don't skip the mint, it's wonderful. Can't wait to make this one again.

What an outstanding way to serve watermelon. We served this as dessert for a light summer dinner and it was a HUGE hit. A great treat and an excellent way to encourage fruit consumption!
