The carrots in this recipe are exceptional. I have never loved a cooked carrot this much in my life-- the combo of the smoky heat from the chipotles, the sweetness of the honey, and the tang of the feta is simply wonderful. The chicken is nothing special, but works to serve alongside (if you have a better grilled chicken recipe, go for it).

Bleh. Not worth the effort.

This is really 4 stars for the carrots, and 2.5 or 3 for the chicken. In the chicken's defense, I used skinless breasts, because that was all I could find. The flavor of the chicken was good, just not particularly memorable. The carrots, on the otherhand, were amazing. I found myself wishing we had just made twice as many carrots and not the chicken. The carrots were smoky, a little sweet, and rich from the feta. One note: I didn't serve the meal on a platter, and instead sprinkled the full amount of feta on the carrots. I think it may have been a bit too much this way. We're already thinking about other things to serve these carrots with, and I think pollo asada may be a nice contrast. Yum!

Carrots with chipotle were great. I left out the feta cheese because it seemed, well, weird. But maybe I'll muster the courage to include it next time.

Awesome. Used cotija cheese instead of feta. The carrots make this meal!

Made this last night, holy crap! Who thought carrots could be so awesome. This recipe uses simple ingredients to make a delicious, complex flavor, and the feta cheese is the icing on the cake. I don't have a grill so I broiled them together in the oven. Also, I used normal sized organic carrots, because my market didn't have the larger ones. I will definitely be making it again, my husband loved it too!
