Not special in any way, even though I used more garlic, cilantro, coriander and tumeric than called for. No real taste and will not make again.

I substituted chicken breasts for the game hens and I think that was a mistake. The marinade was WAY to lemon-y as a result, maybe the amount of lemon juice is appropriate for game hens, though. At least it was easy.

This turned out beautifully and my guests loved it. The skin was crispy and the meat flavorful - cornish hens are often blah. Served it with the cumin-scented rice elsewhere on this site.

This is a great recipe, although I must admit to a substitution: fresh rosemary in the place of cilantro (one of my guests hates the stuff). I used three tbsp fresh rosemary leaves (and double the lemon) in the marinade. I placed a sprig of fresh rosemary under each of the hen sections (to smoke) while the birds were on the grill. Served with Saskatchewan wild rice and broccoli. Met with rave reviews. I'll definitely do this again!
