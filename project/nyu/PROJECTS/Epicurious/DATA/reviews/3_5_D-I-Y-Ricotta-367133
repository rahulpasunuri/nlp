Really, how is this different from the Indian paneer? I was expecting a recipe with less fat. For paneer, we bring the milk to a boil, add lemon juice or plain colorless vinegar, and boil a few more minutes until the whey separates. Then we immediately pour it through a fine cloth, tie it up and hang it a for a few hours. Cut into pieces and use in curries.

Makes Excellent Cheese! The whey also is an excellent medium for making stocks for soup. The milk protein that go with the whey are used that way!

I've found this homemade ricotta recipe from Russ Parsons to be easy and never-fail. I'll often substitute half&half for some of the whole the milk as I never worry about fat. http://www.latimes.com/features/food/la-fo-california-cook-20100930,0,7506847.story

I'm curious too, as Penny5, can we use skim milk and low fat cream? Or what about using condensed milk instead of cream? Just wondering ... often condensed milk is used as a substitute to cream

I'm looking with interest at this recipe and can't wait to try it, but want to know if you can use skim or lowfat milk instead of whole. How about light cream instead of heavy? I prefer to use lowfat products when I can, but if it would alter the recipe too much I may as well splurge!!!

The ricotta recipe I've been happily using all summer has similar proportions to this one (three and a half cups milk to one half cup cream, salt to taste, and 3 Tbs lemon juice) but leaves the lemon juice out until after the milk is heated (and just under boiling, to 190 degrees). After you remove the milk from the heat, gently stir in the lemon juice. You'll immediately see curds begin to form, but let it sit for 5 minutes before pouring it through 3-4 layers of cheesecloth sitting in a sieve. A long drain (one hour) will result in a creamier consistency. This has been foolproof for me, hope it is for others!

I am not giving this 4 fourks because it needs some changes to work. Firstly stir milk (because milk burns quickly) and cream overlow heat until it starts to boil. Remove from heat. Add the lemon gendly stiring. In a few minutes the curds appear. Make sure your collander is lined with a few layers of cheese cloth or even better with one layer of t-shirt material otherwise you will not have any ricotta!

I was expecting more dramatic curds to form--so I did a lot of boiling, simmering and adding of lemon juice. I added the juice of 2 lemons which was probably unnecessary. I ended up putting the whole thing in the fridge undrained for a while and then putting it through the cheesecloth--it made a lot of cheese and was really delicious! Now that I know that the curds are really quite small, I won't fuss with it so much the next time.

I've made homemade ricotta before with great success but this recipe was a total bust. I wasted 4 cups of milk and one cup of cream...ended getting about 2 Tbsp of ricotta because the curds never formed. How much lemon juice can you add before you get LEMON RICOTTA? I'll go back to my old recipe which was more fattening (more cream) but was failproof. Very disappointing.

I made the cheese following the advice from A Cook from Fort Collins, and it turned out just wonderfully. Will certainly make this again.

This recipe is a 4-fork one if you make a few changes. I tried not stirring and letting it sit on the counter for 15 mins. and nothing happened. I even added more lemon and nothing happened. So, I tried it again and instead of not fussing with it, I brought the milk, cream and salt to a rolling boil over medium heat and stirred every few mins. Then, I added the lemon juice, and reduced the heat to a simmer and stirred constantly until it curdled, about 5 mins. I then poured the entire pot into the cheesecloth/sifter, very slowly. Within 10 mins. the cheese was ready to eat. I think the trick was letting the cream, milk, salt and lemon simmer.

It was delicious, but it never thickened to what I would expect. It wasn't really usable. We just slurped it up right out of the bowl the next day. I would appreciate some suggestions as to how to make it thicker. Would love to try again.

This is an excellent and easy recipe for homemade ricotta. We love it over crostini as an appetizer and with honey and almonds breakfast.

Interesting, but it seems you're preparing paneer (Indian cheese) rather than ricotta!

I made this recipe as written, draining it on the countertop, then overnight in the fridge. The resulting product was quite "wet," so I continued to squeeze moisture through the cheesecloth. The resulting "ricotta," while tasty, was the consistency of blue cheese dressing. It made for a nice pasta sauce, but I was hoping for something thicker. Any tips, cooks?
