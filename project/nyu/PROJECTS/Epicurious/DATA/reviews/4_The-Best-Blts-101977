Best BLT ever. I used sourdough bread, but otherwise followed the recipe. My favorite sandwich.

I've made these at least a couple times every summer since that issue of BA came out, my family can't wait for tomato season and these sandwiches. I double the bacon on each sandwich and we prefer sourdough bread. We call them BLOATs...

In a word, Fabulous!! Make the mayo a few hours or more before making the sandwich to allow the mixture to thicken.

This recipe is simple but superb. The mayonnaise is out of this world. Everyone thought so. Quality slab bacon is key. I recommend sourdough instead of white bread, and you MUST toast it! Trust me on this. I'm surprised that the recipe didn't call for it.

My hubby raved about this BLT; I thought it was just OK because the ingredients competed with each other. I used just two paper-thin slices of onion per sandwich, and that worked well. I love basil, but the basil and bacon together overwhelmed the flavor of even our home grown Rutgers and Brandywines. I couldnt taste the avocado at all, although the texture was pleasant. I tried this a second time without avocado, and didn't miss it. I might try this without bacon but with avocado, to see if that combo plays better with the basil mayo (a nice option for blistering hot days when you dont want to use the stove). I like the consistency of the mayo/butter blend over straight mayo, and will use it for other applications.

Yes, the basil adds a very nice touch. However, the recipe made one fatal error. The bacon goes on first then the tomato and last the lettuce on top. The bacon and the lettuce provide moisture barriers to protect the bread from the juicy tomato. Additionally, the tomato is apt to slip and slide around on the greasy mayo whereas the coarse texture of the bacon sticks pretty well. There are so many options to make a BLT, but the tomato must always go in the middle. You should use four slices of bacon. Cut one third off of each bacon strip. The two thirds length piece will be just the length to cover the bread. Place three of the two-thirds length pieces parallel to each other on the mayo covered bread, then place the remaining two-thirds length piece perpendicular across the three. Place the one-third length pieces end to end to complete the second layer of bacon. Most people do not slice a tomato correctly when making a sandwich. If you have a very large firm tomato it is acceptable to cut it horizontally, taking only two or three slices from the middle. Trim these dowm to the size and shape of the bread. Most of the time the tomato will not be this large. When using a smaller tomato, cut it vertically. The slices should be very thin on one edge and one-quarter inch thick on the other. Trim out a small triangle to remove the stem core from the two or three slices at the center. When placing the slices on the sandwich, overlap the thin sides to create a fairly even coverage of tomato. Now how one eats the sandwich is important. The bacon side should be on the bottom when you bite into the sandwich. This places the more flavorful bacon closest to the taste buds on your tongue. Yes, it does affect the taste.

Excellent! Made with 4 slices each of Morningstar Farms Veggie "Bacon" Strips. Crispy when pan fried on a flat pancake skillet. Brushed pan with safflower oil. So flavorful.

Fantastic! Bringing comfort food up to a new level for adults. Yes, I agree that extra bacon per sandwich is more realistic, but these are so good it's worth going for a 1-hour walk afterward!

Fantastic flavor - the Basil Mayo was great will make again. The only down side was that you could barely taste the avacado.

Perfect picnic food - unbelievable sandwich!

I will agree that these were the best BLTs ever. That basil mayo was something else. I suggest adding more than two slices of bacon to each sandwich, however, as two was definitely not enough for us. A minimum of four slices is what I recommend, especially when you are using thickly sliced bread. I took other reviewers' suggestions and broiled one side of the bread so it would be partially toasted, but not too well-done. I plan to make these again as soon as our bodies recover from the first ones! They aren't the healthiest sandwiches, after all, but worth every bite.

Halved the recipe to make 3 sandwiches. Used Kaiser rolls instead of bread, and increased the bacon to 4 slices of lower fat turkey bacon per sandwich. Used fat-free mayo, and, since it is sweeter than the regular, only used 1/4 cup of dried sweet basil leaves for my 1/2 recipe (this eliminated the processor step). I thought it still turned out too heavy on the basil. Next time I would only use 3 Tbs. of the dried basil. Made the mayo mixture well in advance of serving and had to thin it a bit with a little milk. Had about 1/3 of the mayo mixture leftover. The basil is an interesting twist to an old classic! These were GOOD!!!

I loved this recipe. I used turkey bacon instead of pork bacon and it was still wonderful. I also used light mayo and cut back on the red onion. I agree with one of the previous reviewers that the onions were totally overpowering. In half of the sandwiches I didn't use any. By far, the best thing about this recipe was the basil mayo.

I have made this blt recipe for many years, I always make it in the summer when I have vine ripened home grown tomatoes, it is superb. I also toast the bread. I love the avocado in it.

This recipe was absolutely wonderful! We used turkey bacon instead of pork and it was still really great... This has become a staple in our home.

Halve the recipe for two people. Very good - certainly lives up to its billing.

These sandwiches were delicious. I cut the mayo/basil dressing in half and had plenty.

Loved this recipe. Simple, full of flavor and interesting. I even made "mini" versions as an hordouvre that were a big hit and looked beautiful. The combo of basil and avocado is a surprising treat!

A most excellent variation on the traditional BLT. The basil really makes all the difference! The only thing I changed was toasting the bread abit, other that that a perfect combination for the perfect BLT.

Absolutely yummy!! It's become a favorite at my house. I grow lots of basil every summer and this sandwich is an excellent use of it!

I made these for myself and a friend for a light lunch by the pool. We both thought they were the greatest BLT's we'd ever had. Great for a light lunch!

This was the best BLT I have ever had! The basil mayonnaise was superb. I had leftover mayo for sliced meat sandwiches. My family loved it.

These really are the "best" BLTs I've had. Toasting french bread with the basil mayo on it is delicious. These are often requested at my house!!!

Considering that I am not the most experienced cook (I burnt the bacon for this recipe the first time around), the combination of the ingredients and the basil sauce resulted in a rather tasty sandwich. Although there is no substitute for the original, if you are looking for a BLT that's a bit more posh, this is your sandwich.

This was definitely a great rendition of the classic BLT. Adding paper thin slices of red onions along with the basil mayonnaise added such a refreshing and delicious touch. We also tried it on a French Baguette and preferred that over the regular bread. Perfect for a light summer dinner or lunch!

Great version of the BLT. The basil/mayo mixture made more than enough. I will cut the recipe in 1/2 next time.

Excellent...my husband really liked the "sauce". I agree about the onions though-- even a few slivers of red onion seemed to overwhelm the other flavors. That mayo is awesome; could probably be used for other stuff too.

Good and easy. I made a recipe for 2 but used 3 slices of bacon per sandwich and I toasted the bread. You definetly need to be a basil lover.

Rating: 3
I would definitely use a mild onion with this, otherwise the flavor of the basil mayonnaise is completely masked. Also, the thick-sliced bacon really shrunk a lot when cooked. I would recommend using more bacon than just 2 slices per sandwich.

SO MY BOYFRIEND AND HIS BUDDIES WENT TO NAGS HEAD FOR A WEEKEND, I SENT THEM OFF WITH 12 OF THESE BLTs AND I HAVEN'T HEARD THE END OF IT! IT'S A GREAT BLT

I toasted the bread. If you want to make just one, cook only the bacon you need. The basil/mayo mixture has kept very well in my fridge for several days. Wonderful change from blt's!

Simply magnificent. Used vidalia onions. Simply the answer to what one may ask for as a last dinner! Wash down with a chilled bottle of chablis or Dortmunder Union beer. Ahhh...
