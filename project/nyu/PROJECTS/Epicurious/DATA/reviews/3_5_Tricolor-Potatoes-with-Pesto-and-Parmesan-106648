Loved this recipe!! I used three different kinds of potatoes from my CSA box (purple, red and yukon). Amazing! Perfect touch on the pesto, I actually forgot the parm at the end and it didn't matter. Cooking was less for me as well but only because I roasted on convection. So it was about 20 minutes the first round and back in for 10. Would do well for a summer dinner party or a weeknight.

Since I had on hand red potatoes, that's what I used. I sliced them thin so they roasted quickly and crisped nicely. The basil/shallot combo with parmesan added at the end of cooking was delicious-- i enjoyed the potatoes very much, great for summer cooking.

A good recipe with a colorful presentation. Flavor-wise, it is good but not a wow! The cooking times are way off about half.

Mine looked nothing like the photo and was not tasty at all. A total waste of time and ingredients.

i was interested in this recipe but was in the mood for a layered potato dish so here is another way to prepare this recipe. i sauteed 8 scallions then i used the cuisinart to slice the four varieties of (homegrown!) potatoes. i tossed the potato slices with melted butter, the sauteed scallions and grated parmesan cheese. poured these into a dish and baked for 30 minutes. they started to turn golden and i dumped a cup of traditional pesto and more parmesan on top and baked another 15 minutes. baking time will depend on how thick the potato layers are. i also tried to keep my purple potatoes separate and in their own layer but once everything was baked it was hard to identify a true purple layer (waste of time). it was yummy and easy and just a different preparation of this recipe.

This was easy and absolutely delicious! Will do it again and again!

I was a little disappointed in the color and flavor but that's because I roast potatoes all the time with rosemary and they are so good. Next time I think I'll try smooshing them and adding the pesto right before serving to preserve the bright green color.

I served this as a chilled salad. Sliced potatoes into rounds, dressed while warm. Used only half the garlic to make the pesto dressing. Add a grind of sea salt and served over arugula. Also great topped with crisp bacon or proscuitto. Perfect served next to grilled chicken or a lobster salad.

This recipe was delicious and easy to make. I will definitely make these potatoes again.

Really tasty. Used locatelli instead of straight parmesan.

This is my new favorite way to make potatoes. Easy to do with any kind of potato as it can be difficult and expensive to find heirloom varieties. Make up extra batches of pesto to freeze and use year-round.

This recipe is excellent. I ate these potatoes at a friend's Thanksgiving dinner. Everybody loved them. I asked my friend the recipe and then I made it for an important lunch at my home and again, everybody got crazy with them and then, I was the one who was asked for the recipe. I only didn't use the Parmessan cheese due to lactose allergies of one guest. I'll do it again and again...

I was really disappointed with this recipe. The potatoes didn't retain their color and they were in my opinion rather boring. Since I had several potatoes left over, I mashed them the next day and they tasted better that way.

It's definitely easy and tastes just fine, but I wouldn't rate it as 'outstanding'. A nice twist on roasted potatoes.

Brilliance. Sheer brilliance... and use whatever potatoes you have lying around. A keeper!

I made this with organic yukon gold potatoes and some leftover pesto. Potatoes and pesto...what a fabulous idea! I had some difficulty getting the pesto to coat the potatoes evenly and the roasting process took about 10 minutes longer than what the recipe decribed. Not as pretty without the tricolor effect but still tasty.

Absolutely wonderful, perfect for parties with trio of potatoes

My husband loved it. I pre-boiled the potatoes for about ten minutes then roasted as recipe suggested.

This was just okay. There are better potatoe recipes out there.

Pretty & tasted good. Easy as well. However, upon tasting the pesto for seasoning, I just about died. Since it lacked the nuts or cheese, it was BITTER. I added a few tablespoons of my complete pesto that I had left over. Still turned out great, especially because I added more cheese than called for at the end.

This is an excellent side dish! Make sure you salt the potatoes good in the beginning, and don't forget the shallots in the pesto. They add a really nice flavor.

This is the greatest side dish! Very yummy! (Just don't forget the shallots.)

Average potatoes. W/ following directions, exactly, they were too dry when they came out of the oven. The outside of the potatoes were good, but really just average as far as the rest is concerned. I've made MUCH BETTER potato recipes from this website. Won't make again.

This has become a favorite around our table. I have made it with only red or Yukon potatoes, but the children get a kick out of the purple potatoes. This is definitely a keeper.

Made these for a family birthday dinner to go with some grilled salmon and asparagas. Mighty fine. I used some of the leftover potatoes the next day chopped coarsely for my potato salad. Not bad!!!
