this was BRILLIANT. i have a lemon verbena plant in the garden and had no idea what to do with it. the flavor and aroma of lemon verbena normally puts me off as it reminds me of furniture polish - however, this recipe has made me a big fan of the herb! and yes - it makes 6 small ramekins worth of custard - the ramekins i use are around 4.5 ounces each. finally - a word about lemon verbena... it is the perfect counterbalance to the heaviness of cream, and served to make the custard feel light and taste fresh.

this is excellent. about the portions: yes, it's supposed to be six servings of 1/2 cup each. come on people, the recipe only uses 2 1/2 cups of liquid and a little sugar and egs-- how do you think you're supposed to get six cup portions out of that? plus, do you really want to eat six cups of a mixture of whipping cream/ yolks/sugar for dessert? yeesh!

pots de creme are usually served in very small portions as they are quite rich. I believe it's a typo in the recipe and should say 6 1/2 c. portions. I haven't made this yet, but plan to this weekend.

I agree with the other reviewer in that it didn't make nearly enough for the recommended ramekins. However, the flavors were amazing; the perfect balance between sweet and tart. Didn't use the Verbena leaves but don't know that it would have made that much difference. It was wonderfully light and subtle and I would definitely make again...doubling the recipe of course.

Simple dessert to make. Very fresh and clean taste. But it only makes about 3 cups of custard not nearly enough to fill 6 2-cup ramekins. I used 3 1-cup ramekins and would double the recipe in the future.
