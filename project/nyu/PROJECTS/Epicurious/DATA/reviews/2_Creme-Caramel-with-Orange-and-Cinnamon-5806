Not bad for a low-fat recipe.I used almond essence(1/2 tsp) instead of the orange peel th esecond time i made it..came out much better.Also used Eggbeaters instead of 1 large egg to further reduce calories.

I didn't find half an hour for soaking the cinnamon sticks to be too long at all - on the contrary, it was the orange peel that I found to be overpowering. It also wasn't evenly distributed - I had bites where I felt as though I was chewing on a citrus air freshener, and other bites with no orange taste at all. If I make this again, I'll try a bit of orange extract instead of the peels, as I believe it would make for better flavor and more balance.

Use low fat (or skim) EVAPORATED milk to create richness to this recipe.

My family dubbed this "Creme de Close-Up Toothpaste". The cinnamon is way too strong. I would guess that leaving the cinnamon in the milk for 5 minutes would be more than enough.
