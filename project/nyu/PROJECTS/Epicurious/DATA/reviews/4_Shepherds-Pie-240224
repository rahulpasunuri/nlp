my mother used to make sheperd's pie at least once a month when we were growing up in the 60s. This is the closest recipe to the way she'd make it. Four Forks! Hurrah! Brought back happy memories. We used left over leg of lamb from easter put it through the 1890s food grinder and pulled all the rest out from our freezer from last summer's garden (peas, carrots, onions, potatoes) and in just a little while comfort on a plate!

This recipe worked fine as basic template for a shepherd's pie, but if prepared exactly as written, a little bland and lacking in substance. As others have noted, it's pretty bland unless some seasoning tweaks are made. I also found the idea that this would serve 6 people, assuming we're talking about average sized adult humans, absurd. I more than doubled the ingredients in the recipe (making close somewhere between a 2.5X and a triple batch), and ended up with 8 modest (French onion soup bowl) portions. Had I divided these to get the 15 or so portions suggested by the recipe, the dish would not have sufficed as a main meal. I think it would be helpful if Epi changed the servings to 4, or even 2-4.

Excellent. I would like it a bit thicker and will add more veggies next time but it stand up well on its own.

This was delicious! Not sure why others thought it was so bland, but I stuck pretty close to what was written and it turned out great! I think I used more carrots than called for, and I added some worcestershire and nutmeg to the "gravy" as others recommended (loved the worcestershire, but honestly couldn't tell much of a difference with the nutmeg). For the potatoes, I only used about 2T butter, and maybe more like 3/4 cup milk, and they were perfect. Yes, I could have used the full amount of butter, but I really didn't think any flavor was sacrificed by not doing so. All in all, a very successful dinner. It was pretty fast, too! My hubby loved it. I think I'll make this more often. :o)

SO GOOD! Made some changes though. Used all ground turkey, doubled vegetables & herbs, added mushrooms, worstershire & nutmeg as suggested. Also used half potato & half cauliflower with milk, 2 tbsp butter & parmasean cheese in potatoes. Truly was the best meal!!!

I made so many changes it's hardly fair to rate it, but it was good! I used beef instead of lamb, and added a couple of cloves of garlic, fresh thyme, and salt and pepper instead of parsley and rosemary (using what I had). I added cinnamon, cumin, and nutmeg with the broth, etc, and first deglazed with 1/3 cup red wine. I added sliced mushrooms and cauliflower with the peas. I also used buttermilk in the potatoes, boiled with garlic and a bay leaf,reduced the butter to 2 Tbs, and added fresh dill, and topped with shredded Romano.

This is a keeper for sure. To make it kid friendly, I made a few changes. For the mashed potatoes, I added a carrot or two, like she said, and used sour cream (abt 1/4 c) heavy cream (abt 1/4 c) butter (4 T) and Parmesan cheese (abt 1/2c). For the meat, I added a pint of baby bellas put through a food processor, so the kids wouldn't find them, a whole can of tomato paste, and corn because I didn't have peas. At the end, I topped w shredded cheddar, again courting kid approval. And they did like it! :)

Awesome Shepherd's Pie recipe. I changed it (quite) a bit by adding nutmeg, a bit of cinnamon, increasing veggies considerably (1.5 cups each of celery, mushrooms, onions, carrots and peas), half lamb/half beef, Worcestershire sauce, smoked paprika, cumin, cayenne pepper and reducing butter by 50%. Turns out great - hearty and satisfying but you don't feel gross and heavy. Used a Kitchen Aid on low for the mashed potatoes.

This turned out very good. I added some diced turnips (I had used them in an old recipe I used to make). The vegetables needed a little more time to soften than the recipe states.

This was very easy and so delicious, thanks to the other reviewers' suggestions! I went through them and picked what sounded best to me. So, I: - Used 4 carrots instead of 1; - Added a few splashes of Worcestershire; - Used a bit more rosemary than the recipe calls for; - Added some nutmeg; - Added 2 cloves of garlic, pressed; - Added a splash (maybe 1/3 cup) of red wine; - Used beef stock and then added some chicken stock for more liquid (if I'd had beef, I would have used it); and - Thickened the sauce at the end by making a quick roux by putting 1 tbs of butter in the microwave and mixing in 1 tbs of flour. I also had enough so that I could do one big pie and three little ramekins. They were so cute, and everything was delicious!! I will definitely make this again!

I know everyone hates it when someone makes changes, but I did, and I think it would have been bland without, which is why I gave it 3 forks. I used elk instead of lamb, seasoned with s/p and garlic powder, added shallots, ketchup because I didn't have tomato paste, deglazed the pan with red wine, threw in fresh thyme from the garden, used Yukon gold because I had it instead of Russet potatoes. It was delicious and satisfying. Even my 19 month old twins gobbled it up!

This recipe is definitely a keeper. I took suggestions of other readers and added some minced garlic cloves, garlic powder, a little nutmeg, and salt and pepper when browning the lamb. Also added a splash of white wine and used Yukon gold potatoes instead of Russet. I also cut way back on the butter for the potatoes - 1 tbsp was plenty. My husband loved this and I will definitely make it again!

Making this started out with having to use up extra store bought mashed potatoes. I added mushrooms and not peas. I also use Worcester sauce, and some cooking sherry. Skipped the broth and tomato paste. There was just enough liquid and was very rich tasting.

This recipe is a staple at our house. We make it all the time! You can easily make changes to it- adding extra veggies to the filling, making the mashed potato topping dairy free with chicken broth and olive oil instead of butter and milk - but it is also great as written. It also freezes very well.

This recipe is one of my staples. I've been making it a couple times per month over the last year. It's delicious as is. I don't find it to be bland at all. In fact sometimes I find it a little to flavorful. Way better than any shepherd's pie I have ever had in any Irish pub. I use only ground beef because I always have it on hand. I usually make this with left over mashed potatoes and frozen peas and carrots for a quick midweek meal.

I would have to agree with JCWToronto; I also found this to be bland. I had to doctor it up quite a bit.

This was delicious! I didn't make it exactly as the recipe called but with my changes it was still amazing. In lieu of the tomato paste I used one medium diced tomato and some worcestershire sauce and a tiny bit of barbeque sauce. I also decided to add some sliced mushrooms, paprika, and fresh ground pepper. I wanted the meat to have a more gravy-like consistency so I added about 1/4 cup milk and 3 tablespoons of goat cheese after the stock had simmered and reduced. I also mixed some garlic and chive into the mashed potatoes. I think this is my favorite way to use ground beef. This is a great recipe that seeing from other comments can accommodate a variety of changes. Amazing!

This was truly spectacular. I fried everything in bacon fat, used ground turkey (that's what we had in the fridge), and used a beer + stock combination instead of stock alone. On paper, this doesn't seem like it would be that remarkable, but it really was. Enjoy :)

I have made this several times over the past few months and everyone loves it. I have done it exactly as the recipe calls and changed it. I've used Beef, Venison, Lamb and Turkey. So far the venison and turkey are my favorite. Still a nice meat protein, but a lot less fat. I allow the carrots and onions to really cook and carmelize, get all nice and brown before I do anything else. I think this adds a lot of rishness to the flavor than just a quick saute. I also use red wine, about a 1/2 cup and let is simmer down for the stock, I use better than bouillon rather than a box of chicken stock, probably gives it a richer flavor as well. The last time I made it, I went 40% potatoes and 60% mashed cauliflower mixture for the top and the family loved it

Simply wonderful! I wouldn't make any changes. Don't leave out the rosemary - it's essential for the flavor combination.

Made this last night for St. Pat's as written, only we subbed in Champ (from this site) for the mashed. One guest noted this is lighter and better than other Pie recipes. We also made a vegetarian version using about 6 large portabella caps and veggie broth instead of the meat and beef broth, and otherwise following the recipe verbatim. Veggie version was a big hit!

took this to Grange Pot luck for St. Patty's Day. Everyone loved it and I will continue to make for my Husband as well. I did use ground beef and added slash of Worcestershire,used 4 carrots,added 2 stockes of celery and doubled peas, tomato past and beef stock. I did top with chedder cheese, it was just like my Grandma.

Very good recipe. Like other cooks, I added some extra ground pepper and salt to the filling. I also thought it looked a bit runny, so I added a tablespoon of flour mashed up completely with a tablespoon of soft butter and it thickened up nicely. Also, in response to one reviewer, I think shepards do watch flocks of sheep, not herds of cattle, so lamb is very appropriate. I live in cattle country, however, so I made this with ground beef and it was great.

I made "cowboy pie" instead of shepherd's pie (I had ground beef, not ground lamb) and it was great. I added an extra 1/2 cup of beer but it was still a little dry, I might add more stock next time. Am embarrased to say I fogot to add the peas (these things happen if the cook decides to finish the rest of the beer bottle) and it still was good. Even with changes, the proportions here are the best part. Works great.

Excellent recipe! Modified the meal with previous suggestions: doubled parsley, added fresh 1 tsp. thyme, was out of paste used ketchup instead, added 1 large minced garlic clove to meat, reduced butter to 3 tbsp, added 1 tbsp worchestershire sauce to meat, used 3/4 cup beef broth and 1/4 cup red wine and used reduced fat sour cream for milk. Reduced the liquid in the meat until there was a very small amount left. One last change was I bought ground veal by mistake and the meal was perfect. Will make recipe again today with chopped lamp ( will cut up into smaller pieces) with some ground beef mixed in , double the garlic, more carrots and olive oil for the oil. Any recipe is the starting point for your own personalized creation. It took me 20 years to realize this.

This recipe was a big hit; I made only a few changes. I used ground beef instead of lamb, and I was out of rosemary, so I used thyme & a pinch of basil. The recipe did not call for any thickening agent, and so it wouldn't be too soupy, I added 2 TBSP corn starch. The recipe didn't call for any added salt, and since my beef broth was salt free, I added 1 tsp. salt. I will definitely save this to my recipe box and make it again!

Oh my lord. This was wonderful. I modified the recipe to what I had on hand as follows: 1lb 99% fat free ground turkey instead of lamb. I was worried that it wouldn't have the saucieness that you need for good Shepard's Pie, so I didn't drain the meat and veg. I added 2t Better Than Bullion beef base, and 1 1/2 cps of water. I didn't have any parsley, but I did have fresh thyme so I combined that with chopped dried rosemary. I did add about a tablespoon of worcestershire sauce, and I only had whipping cream, so I used that in my potatoes. This was absolutely fantastic.

I'm English and a stickler for real Shepherd's Pie. No beef! Only dif between this and the real McCoy, leftover lamb from Sunday's "Joint" was used. A touch of Worcestershire is nice and I love a half cup of grated cheddar on top. My wife and I gorged ourselves on this! Thanks for the recipe. I get peeved at people who rate with tweaks, but I added parsnips instead of peas, just because they were handy.

I tried the original recipe agree that the recipe can be on the bland side. To make it sublime, you need to reduce the broth by a 1/3 or 1/2. I double the broth, add some cognac (or try red wine), simmer with carrots, garlic, onions, and rosemary (strain and discard afterwards) and reduce by half. This makes for a beefier and more well- rounded flavor -- tasting like it was long simmered rather than the quick 10 min on stovetop. This makes it rustically delicious, with a beautiful developed and robust flavor. I make and assemble this in individual ramekins, one day ahead, so I can pop it in the oven right after work for the family dinner (Next time I will try with turkey meat to reduce the fat content.)

This dish was our supper last night and was perfect for a chilly autumn evening. We used ground beef instead of lamb, because it's what we had on hand, but I can imagine the amazing, rich flavour the lamb would add. If using beef, I'd definitely recommend a dash or two of Worcestershire sauce in the meat to boost the flavour. Otherwise we were pleased with the seasoning. We also used some leftover filling from a recent perogy pinching session, so the added cheese blended in with the potatoes made for a lovely flavour addition. I'd highly recommend a bit of cheese blended into the potatoes and/or sprinkled on top (we used an old cheddar). We'll be using this recipe again, for sure!

I prepared this dish for supper last night, with a few adjustments. There are just two of us to cook for so I like to make individual servings, and freeze extras for when one of us is out of town. I used mini pie tins and this batch made four servings which was perfect. I also tasted along the way and added a good bit of salt as the beef was a bit bland for my taste. I also chose to substitute one large mashed sweet potato for the russet, as that is what was available fridge. This meal is one I will keep in my arsenal for when I do not feel like grocery shopping!

Perfect use for leftover mashed potatoes! I added a lot of extra seasoning at the suggestion of others...salt, pepper, extra rosemary and parsley. I used Better Than Boullion beef base and added an extra teaspoon of that to "Beef" up the flavor too. Added corn and red pepper and put some cheese on top. VERY delicious!

Make sure you use regular (not low-salt) broth or else this may be on the bland side. Just taste the meat mixture before you cook it to make sure it's not bland (if it is, add some salt and pepper). I've made this a bunch, always makes my boyfriend very very happy. This is the first time I followed the recipe for the mashed potatoes (I usually just wing it).. OMG - that's a LOT of butter. Very creamy, almost runny. It's in the oven now - can't wait to see how it comes out with the potatoes the way it was intended.

When I read the list of ingredients, I worried that this would be another bland casserole recipe. So I changed the recipe based on what I had on hand, and thought it was pretty good. But I made a few changes... I like a moist casserole. I'll add more liquid next time, or maybe even layer the potatoes & meat/onion mix so the potatoes can get some o that great gravy. I hate carrots, so I skipped those & used Brussel sprouts instead. I think this would be great with green beans, or different root veggies. I recommend, if you use ground lamb, you use 2-3 lbs because by the time you brown & drain fat from the lamb there's not a lot of meat left. I seasoned the meat with garlic, a bit of Lawry's seasoned salt, & McCormick's Worcester pepper. Also added a couple dashes of Cholula hot sauce (not too hot, but great flavor). If I'd had it on hand, I would have added Cheddar cheese. This recipe has a lot of potential for American diners, with a little tweaking!

This was a big hit with my family of teenage boys and husband. I used half ground turkey and half ground beef, added 1/4 C red wine, doubled the tomato paste, added garlic salt to both meat and to the potatoes, as well as 1 C frozen corn (got to sneak those veggies in somehow!). I wanted to cut down on the fat in the mashed potatoes, so used only 1 T butter, and 1/2 C fat free half and half. Creamy and yummy!

I really enjoyed this recipe, but I had to make a few modifications. They don't include seasoning the meat and vegetables with salt and pepper which without it, it would be bland.

This was excellent. I modified it a bit, and was very pleased. In addition to the rosemary and parsley, I also added in a bit of ground thyme. I used red potatoes and parsnips, leaving some of the skin on the potatoes to add a bit of extra color to the topping. I ended up using ground beef (lean) and was very delighted with the outcome. I would totally make this again, but next time I think I would add a bit more tomato paste than the recipe calls for, and maybe a tablespoon of worchestershire when seasoning the meat.

Excellent! Here was my method: Mashed potatoes: 1 mesh bag of red bliss potatoes, added sauted garlic, milk, and 1 T butter after they were boiled. Veggies: sauted onions, then carrots, then mushrooms added 1/2 t boullion cube. Put aside in another bowl while beef browns. Beef: saute garlic, add beef, when browned add 1/2 cup white and red wine, 1/2 cup chix broth, 2 T tom paste. Lastly, add thyme, parsley, and worchestershire saute. YUM!

We had variety of meats fondue on Thanksgiving eve and I ended up with a large piece of leg of lamb left uncooked. This was the perfect recipe. I used chunks of lamb instead of ground lamb. There was also about 1/2 a Boursin cheese round left over, so I put it into the potatoes left from Thanksgiving dinner. Not traditional but WOW was it good.

Great! I had formerly used Alton Brown's recipe for shepherd's pie but disliked it; this simpler recipe yields a much better, healthier-tasting, more subtly flavored pie. I cut back a little on the tomato paste (I didn't want too much sweetness or red tint), added a little minced garlic and some fresh thyme (in addition to the other fresh herbs) when cooking the lamb mixture, and added some buttermilk to the mashed potatoes -- all changes I'd recommend. Use good lamb that your butcher grinds for you if possible, and definitely drain the fat thoroughly after it has cooked.

I've been making a family shepherd's pie recipe for years (25+), but wanted to try something different. I was born in England, so didn't make this decision lightly. My family enjoyed this new recipe - the four of us (2 adults, 2 pre-teen kids) ate the whole thing. I used ground sirloin rather than the ground lamb (only because it's what I had on hand and what I would normally use. I should have omitted the rosemary and replaced it with basil or oregano. I didn't care for the rosemary with the beef. I also added some mushrooms. This was a delicious recipe, but I'll probably go back to my family recipe. :-)

This is great, I do it as is...just adding worcestershire sauce when I add the paste. I make the mashed potatoes my own way (usually adding sourcream, creamcheese, boursin, whatever's handy). And I just bake the pie in the dish I cooked it in (to cut down on dishes). So goood

I must say, my potatoes were awesome! I used whole milk, 4 tablespoons butter (instead of 6), and coarse garlic salt instead of kosher salt. As for the rest of the recipe, I improvised and Americanized the recipe as many of the other reviewers did. I halved the peas, and instead threw in button mushrooms, corn, and a Roma tomato from my garden. I used baby carrots instead of chopping a large carrot, which worked out just fine! For the meat, I used half ground beef and half ground turkey. I sauteed the meat in garlic, salt, pepper, ground mustard, and Worcestershire sauce. The next time I make it, I would use a little more Worcestershire sauce and garlic. Overall a good and easy recipe, and very fun to experiment with.

Made this for St Pat's last march because my half Irish wife wanted a traditional dish.

Traditional recipe and very good. The origin of the dish is from England/Scotland in the 18 century. Potatoes are a New World Food and not introduced to Europe until the 1500's. The Spanish brought back potatoes from Peru. Peruvians are very proud of the 100's of varieties of potato. The Brits make fun of Americans who add cheese to this dish.

This was great - easy and delicious. I made it with the help of my 8 year old daughter, who was very proud of the result. Only thing she'd change in the future would be the quantity of peas.

I couldn't have Americanized this dish any more!! I used ground bison, Vidalia onions, a mixture of veggies including corn, peas, carrots and turnips (any way I can get more veggies in my kids is a good thing!!), yukon gold potatoes, and topped it with Wisconsin cheddar. I too added fresh garlic and a variety of herbs, and since I had no tomato paste on hand, threw a can of stewed tomatoes, a little water and a dollop of beef soup base in the food processor for the paste and broth. It was far from fancy, but made an absolutely delicious, very nutritious comfort food dish.

Well I also 'colored outside the lines' after reading the reviews. I added a few more carrots, a little cubed zucchini (with seeds removed), and some mushrooms. Added salt and pepper and also dill and thyme. Added one clove of garlic to meat and a little paprika-- cooked meat and veggies separately. Also a splash of white wine. Delish! Don't worry--won't refer to it as shepherd's pie! I am surprised this makes enough for 6 servings--not a high veggies-to- meat ratio...

This is a great "go to" shepherds pie recipe. I make this all the time. Personally, I much prefer the ground lamb rather than beef for this. I like getting the mash potatoes started first. Herbs and garlic add to the flavor.I add a good splash of Worcestershire sauce. I like a sprinkle of grated very sharp cheddar on the top of the mashed potatoes.

Loved this recipe! I am rather amused by all the people who have tried to make it more flavorful! Evidently they don't really want Shepherd's Pie, they want a casserole. Shepherd's Pie is supposed to be on the bland side. Most recipes for this dish don't even call for the celery and carrots and peas. You're missing the whole idea when you add lots of flavorings, mushrooms, etc.. You can do that if you like, and it's probably very good, but then you shouldn't present it to anyone as being Shepherd's Pie.

At the suggestion of other reviews, I added garlic to meat. I also added S&P, as the recipe doesn't call for it. Finally, I mashed Yukons and sweet potatoes for the topping. WOW! Huge hit at dinner table an certainly zero shortage of good flavor. Two notes: I boiled Yukons separate from sweet potatoes as they cook at different speeds. Then mash. The TIP at the bottom of the page is good: use a cast iron skillet to prep the meat, carrots and all, then put mashed roots on top and into the oven in the cast iron skillet. Great presentation. Nice meal.

I thought this recipe was in desperate need of flavor!! I added some celery salt, some thyme, some lawry's, a bit of thyme and some paprika. Then I scrounged around and found some malbec and tossed a bit in. Then I added a hearty dose of Worcestershire. Half a pound of sliced mushrooms and doubled the beef stock and then simmered down. THEN it tasted great. Should've tried a bit of a roux to thicken, but I needed to keep this gfcf and had no potato or corn starch on-hand.

I used to work at a nice English restaurant in NY where they would serve us this for staff meal now and then. Most meals were memorable only because they were on the "inedible" rather than the "must eat more" end of the spectrum. This, however, was always well done, so I was eager to try one out on my own. I had a couple sweet potatoes I wanted to use, so I decided to throw them into the mix and WOW - super delicious. I wouldn't make this again without them. Other amendments to the recipe were the addition of mushrooms and garlic to the meat mix (I used ground pork and beef), and probably a third of the butter to the potatoes. Very easy and very yum.

I like this recipe. I like to get as much flavour as possible out of ingredients without being indulgent. I used less butter and I DID use full fat milk and 1 TBS of heavy cream for the mash. Half mince beef and half mince lamb was a very nice combination. I also added freshly ground nutmeg to the potatoes, did not use the parsley but substituted marjoram instead. I definitely layered and cooked in layers in well. I also sauteed the meat with garlic and Merlot to reduction before adding the paste and other ingredients. I had to leave off the peas because I forgot about them, but I did make the first layer of carrots, onions and parsnips and I loved the sweetness of the parsnips/celeriac. I also mixed in about an ounce of parmesan and a little cheddar and then layered it all, baked it and finished it under the broiler for about 5-8 minutes which made it all perfect! Note: Serve it with a Guinness!

I made this for my boyfriend for our Valentine's Dinner (nothing says love to an Irishman like this and Guinness). He absolutely loved it! It was so good and easy to make. I used ground turkey instead of lamb and only one half an onion. Now I've been requested make this more often!

So delicious. I used thyme rather than parsley and rosemary (but not a big fan, so I'll skip it next time). Used lean ground beef, added celery, mushrooms and red pepper crushed chilies and garlic in the beginning with the onions. Perfect for a Canadian winter.

Just made this tonight and it was great, a keeper...I followed some of the suggestions offered by others. I added half a zuch and half a summer squash chopped, a cup of chopped criminis and 3 cloves of garlic. I also used some worchestershire and more rosemary than called for. Salt and pepper of course and everything else as called out in the recipe. I was able to purchase some lamb raised by a local Amish farmer, so no hormones or drugs...all natural with only a few hymns to sing it to sleep in the evening. Fabulous flavor and not too strong. For the spud topping I use about 2/3 yukon golds and 1/3 parsnips. 3 roasted garlic cloves, 2/3 cup sharp white cheddar an 1/2 cup parm cheese. Butter as specified and heavy cream for the milk. These I'll make by themselves for holidays in the future! For those that say it is a bland dish, since everything is cooked ahead, you have plenty of opportunity to "adjust the seasonings" so there's really no excuse. Make it! You'll love it

My 15 year old son made this for our entire family as a cooking project for a culinary class in school. It was absolutely delicious! Light, very flavorful and perfect seasoning. We have had many shepherd's pies at restaurants and this was one of the best we have tasted. Even better because it was homemade. He substituted beef for lamb. The potatoes were rich and browned lightly on top. Left a nice crust. Highly recommend as a keeper!! Now I must make the dish too.

I made a few alterations myself: 1) I added chopped celeriac (celery root) and chopped celery. 2) I used a LOT of spices and extra vegetable (instead of beef) broth. 3) Left out tomato paste and 4) substituted corn for peas 4) I used red potatoes and mashed them very loosely, leaving large chunks. Which I mashed with goat's milk yogurt. Served with mushroom gravy http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Mushroom-Gravy-12013?recipename=Mushroom%20Gravy&saved_to_box=y

Very nice basic recipe. I had a pound of ground venison, so I used that (more of a "hunter's pie" than shepherd's pie). I sauteed mushrooms, onions, and carrots and put them in the bottom of the casserole. I sauteed the meat with roasted garlic,added some merlot to the sauce, and used that as the second layer. Layering it looked nicer than just "brown mush." I also added some grated asiago cheese to the potatoes. It was really tasty.

Great recipe..I thing some corn would go good in there also. Plus I think I may add a little cornstarch to the meat mix before I top it with the potatos. The pie pieces will be more solid and not ooze on the plate. Think its also better the next day.

This generally had a good flavor, though I used Yukon gold potatoes instead of the russet (I prefer the creamy texture) and added garlic, salt and pepper to punch up the seasoning, but I definitely suggest using half lamb and half ground beef or some other meat. A family of lamb lovers, we nonetheless found the ground lamb gamey - just a little strong for the dish.

Hands down, the absolute favorite winter dish in my house. I now use frozen peas and carrots in place of just the fresh carrots - faster and more flavorful.

This turned out so well! It was a fun Sunday meal that my husband and I made together. We added some things after reading the reviews. Instead of vegetable oil, we used olive oil and 1.5 t minced garlic. After browning the meat, we added 1 cup white wine and reduced it before adding the tomato paste, broth, herbs, etc. Added 1T worchestershire before draining the fat and 1/2 T after draining it. As for the topping, we went with the other recipe here: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Shepherds-Pie-with-Parsnip-Topping-237036 and had the creamy parsnip topping. We only had red potatoes but they worked well, and we left the skins on. No one could tell visually, but they added a little something to the dish. What wonderful flavors!

Rating: 4
Forgot this part. I used Yukon Gold potatoes and a quarter of a cauliflower cubed and steamed so they would cook quick and not lose flavor. I also added some of the scrapings sans the fat to the sauce. No butter in the mashed potatoes, and I used unsweetened soy milk instead of real milk...no difference that anyone could detect. I also used fresh edible pod peas instead of regular peas. Switched out regular onion for scallions...more mild. Very, very tasty!!!

Definate make again. I used pork roast that I cooked the same day...chopped fine...really good flavor! Fresh rosemary...perfect...not too strong.

A solid recipe for a cold winter's night. We followed suggestions for Worcestershire sauce and garlic, plus some fresh ground pepper and salt. We cooked the meat and final pie in a dutch oven, which saves dirtying another dish. We'll definitely make a double batch next time and add some cheese -- Pecorino romano -- to the potatoes for some extra flavor.

I prepared exactly as written using ground lamb. The meat mixture seemed a bit bland so I added salt, pepper, another tablespoon or two of tomato paste and about a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce and that seemed to help. I wouldnt get crazier than that, its supposed have more subtle flavors. Good comfort food, just needs to be jazzed up a bit.

Rating: 3
This is one of my favorite comfort foods, a fantastic recipe. I added about 1 c white wine to the meat before the tomato paste and let it reduce. I know the clasic way is with lamb being shepherd's and all, but I have done it with both beef and turkey and it turns out well with either. I also add frozen corn with the peas, and use red b's instead of russets becasue I like the texture of the skins in it.

I think this is a good base recipe, but I don't think following it exactly is a good idea. I too thought it looked too bland, so I added extra veggies (mushrooms, parsnip, turnip, green beans, and corn), used red wine for part of the liquid, used dried herbs de province, and added cheese on top of the potatoes. It turned out delicious! I definitely wouldn't use anything other than lamb, and next time I think I will follow the suggestions and add an entire can of tomatoe past and maybe even some chopped tomatoes. Maybe even some nutmeg and top it with a combination of sharp cheddar and jarlesberg...

this is very similar to the recipe we've come to. still haven't used lamb, but bison does make a great hearty flavor. frozen peas and carrots or even frozen veggie mix(green beans, lima beans, carrots, corn) make for an easy and quick addition. i look forward to the day when my girlfriend will let me use tabasco when cooking it. i usually eat too much, but it's so good.

I used a bag of frozen mixed veggies and nearly an entire small can of tomato paste - the paste provides extra nutrition and does not change the consistency of the meat mixture. I also used dried mixed Italian herbs instead of fresh Italian parsley. Making this dish with lamb makes such a huge difference in the taste! This is a favorite in my house.

I followed the spirit of the recipe, if not the letter... I used grass-fed beef instead of lamb and used a whole package, which is 2 cups, I think, of mixed veggies (baby carrots, peas, corn, and green beans) instead of just the peas, and I really liked the extra amount. Next time I will probably not bother with the parsley and use more rosemary. I'd also put a can of crushed or diced tomatoes in, use beef broth or Better than Bouillon instead of the chicken broth I had on hand to make a little more of a sauce. I sprinkled a layer of sharp cheddar on top of the meat mixture, but didn't use enough to tell the difference. My British husband made gravy from granules he brought back from his last trip over and put cheese on top of his and stuck it under the broiler for a couple of minutes. I tried it and had to admit the cheese was good, but I can do without the gravy. I found that because I drained off the fat when cooking the meat, a lot of my salt got away, so I ended up needing salt even after I seasoned it before putting it in the dish to bake. This filled a 2.2 qt. pyrex perfectly.

Okay. My husband was salivating as he walked in the house & smelled this dish! I did read the reviews first, and here's my take on it, as I wrote in my notes; "Add a layer of roasted zucchini under the potatoes, and a layer of shredded cheddar & parmesan cheese on top of the zucchini. Toss the peas, add sauteed mushrooms. Add tobasco sauce. And wine. Cook potatoes with beef bouillon. Use heavy cream with the potatoes." Amazing.

This is an exceptional comfort food recipe. I used half lamb, half beef and added worcestershire sauce. Easy and quick. A keeper.

I must add to the chorus of raves for this dish. The whole adds up to more than the sum of it's parts -- it is rich in flavor and texture, the perfect comfort food. I took the suggestions of other reviewers and added thyme, more carrots and onions, brown gravy mix, red wine,and a whole can of beef broth. We like lots of gravy,and the flavor and consistency was perfect. I also used instant mashed potatoes, which worked well and cut down prep time. By all means, use lamb in this recipe. It makes all the difference in the flavor of this dish.

Yummy!! I added corn and peas to this, as well as increasing the amount of tomato paste and throwing in some worchestershire sauce... Not bland at all! Also, I seasoned the meat (pork and beef) as it was browning.

This recipe is very true to any traditional shepherd's pie that you'd be served in the UK. It definitely tastes best with lamb, but substituting half with a leaner meat like turkey also works really well. One thing I do differently is to use game stock from the local butcher instead of chicken or beef broth - it adds a lot of richness to the taste. It is also really important to add a layer of sharp cheddar between the potatoes and filling. Overall, a great basic recipe that adapts well to substitions. I'll definitely continue to use this recipe in the future!

Since my wife does not like lamb, I used ground beef. I threw in some garlic powder with the meat mixture before assembly. This is super easy and makes a great serving size. It was, however, a little bland. I put some A-1 sauce (or any other spicy steak sauce) over it and it was great. This will be a regular in my recipe book!

I made this with leftover leg of lamb roast (lamb was already seasoned with rosemary and garlic). I followed the rest of the recipe fairly closely. The lamb was already cooked so I did the onions and carrots and then just added the cubed lamb at the end to heat through. I didn't have frozen peas so used frozen green beans instead. Also, I didn't peel the potatoes for the crust. Delicious! My husband loved it and I had to agree it was yummy!

Having had a British Mum, I have been looking for a recipe for Shepherd's Pie since her death in '97. This recipe is authentic, tasty and merits the 4 fork rating. I made the dish with beef, veal and pork last night. I doubled the beef broth,carrots, tomato paste, and herbs. I used 4 or 5 carrots to add more color to the dish, as the first time I made it I felt it needed more carrot. I will make it with the mashed carrot, parsnip and potato crust as suggested in these reviews next time. Fast, tasty, a real comfort food.

Rating: 4
I agree with other posters, this is a simple, yet delicious recipe. I made a few additions to the basic recipe based on what other reviewers suggested. I added garlic and red and green peppers when sauteeing with the onions, carrots and meat. I also added corn along with the peas. I used 2 lbs of lean ground beef (not my favourite, but I accidentally bought it without reading the label, duh!), more vegetables and tomato paste, but left it at the suggested amount of mashed potatoes. I also added soya sauce along with the beef broth. My whole family devoured it, even my picky 5 year old daughter. This recipe along with my additions, made enough for two meals (in 2 2.5 litre baking dishes). I will definitely make this again.

Made this for my husband. He's British and enjoyed it alot. The leftovers we easy to heat up and we're just as tasty.

I don't really eat meat - but have to say this was the most delicious smelling meal ever. This one is definitely a keeper.

My husband does most of the cooking and I am in charge of printing out recipes. He thought that this was going to be too hard but I convinced him to try it.

We made this a couple of nights ago & have adopted it as our 'house' shepherd's pie recipe! We used beef instead of lamb, but I'd try lamb another time. We also added about a half tsp. Worstershire & deleted the peas. The best part though was serving the roast beef gravy (from a previous dinner) to laddle over top! Easy & good, and the flavours were exactly what I'd look for with this dish.

I am starting to try my hand at more cooking, and I really enjoyed this dish. Simple, tasty, nutritious (we upped the veggie count), and easy. We had a vegetarian in our group, so we added mushrooms and made half just veggie and have veggie and meat. Overall thoughts from the group I was cooking with were that it was a little bland. We did use chicken broth and will try beef next time, and also thought about adding an actual tomato. Will def. try again.

I really enjoyed making and eating this! It made a lot more than I thought it would! I would advise adding some salt to this recipe and I added mushrooms just for the heck of it.

Reheats well and you don't need really anything else to accompany it. Enjoy!

This recipe was a great way to use leftover vegetables and mashed potatoes from Christmas dinner. I added about a 1/4 cup of red wine to the broth mixture and added about 1 extra cup of broth when I transferred the meat and vegetables to the baking dish so it wouldn't dry out in the oven.

Really good, simple, and would definitely make again. Suggest 1.5 lbs lamb (1 lb leaves a little too much potato to meat). Also used 2 small leeks instead of onions, and 2 medium carrots (one red and one yellow). Left out the peas and parsley, but used almost 2 T fresh rosemary. Salt a bit before assembling, and definitely use a healthy dash of worcestershire. Add the potatoes Gordon Ramsey style with a pastry bag to make uniform dollops, definitely helps the presentation.

This was really good! I wouldn't necessarily call it a Quick & Easy recipe (with emphasis not on the quick part) as it took about a 1 1/2 from start to finish...kind of long for us on a week night.

A humble cold-weather supper. I added parsnips (which are mentioned in the intro but not in the recipe), omitted the peas, and substituted fresh thyme for the parsley, and a leek for the onion.

Great, but pumped it up with more herbs and spices, hot pepper and mint too....

I made this for a weeknight dinner. It was very easy and I used ground beef, pork, and veal. Otherwise it was made as is and everyone enjoyed it. It fell apart when we cut it but the taste was delicious regardless. I used corn and peas. Yum!

Bland as written - I added worcestershire sauce and a bit of thyme to make the gravy more savory. Otherwise ok.
