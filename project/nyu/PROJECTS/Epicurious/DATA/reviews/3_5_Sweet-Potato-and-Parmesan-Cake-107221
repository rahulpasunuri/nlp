I gave the recipe 3 forks but I havent' made it yet.... When do you add the Parmesan? I gues I'll just sprinkle it over the layers?

Easy (if you use a food processor to slice the taters) and wow-yummy. We baked ours in a round glass dish (instead of the prescribed metal pie pan) without any obvious ill effects.

Delicious! We always do A mashed potato and a sweet potato dish for holidays, and I'm not a big fan of the super-sweet-and-drippong-with-butter sweet potato recipes because we all get enough dense calories from the other foods. This recipe is light, savory and well-textured. The crunch factor combined with its flavoring from parmasan (and I used Romano cheese as well), it doesn't compete with the garlic mashed potatoes with pungent flavors or the fresh herbs in the stuffing. This dish fit right in!

My husband asked for thirds! Delicious! I peeled the sweet potatoes while watching television and it didn't seem so time consuming. Overall, the recipe was quite easy.

I made this to accompany Grilled Maple-Brined Pork. Since it was just for my husband and I, I wasn't terribly careful about arranging the potato strips and it still turned out fine. I thought it was good, not great, but my husband raved about it. If fixing for company, I'd probably slice the potatoes into rounds (a la Pommes Anna) for a prettier presentation and maybe use melted butter instead of olive oil for a richer mouthfeel.

This is an excellent dish, although it seemed to take forever to peel the sweet potatoes into strips. But the effort was well worth it. Not only did my guests love this dish -- including my 16 year old daughter who would never eat sweet potatoes in the past -- but everyone also commented about the "interesting" way the dish was prepared. There wasn't an ounce left. This is a keeper for the fall holiday season.

It takes some time, so you have to plan out the rest of your meal accordingly. But well worth it! I have made this about 4 times since first trying it when the magazine came out in late summer. Most recently served it to family over Chirstmas holiday - everyone asked for recipe!

This is a winner. Followed the recipe and couldn't believe how tasty it was considering the level of effort.

A delicious side dish. I sliced the potatoes using the thin slice wheel on the food processor. It was easier and faster than hand slicing. It made no difference to the recipe since sweet pototatoes have a soft (mashed like) texture when cooked. This was simple and very tasty.
