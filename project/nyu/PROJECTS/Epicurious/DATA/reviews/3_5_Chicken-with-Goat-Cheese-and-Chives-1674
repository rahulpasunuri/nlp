Recipe is great except it leaves out the white wine and broth in the directions. Tastes great as I've made it before but then I had the complete instructions for making it with the wine and broth.

I altered this a bit, so it would be easier. It came delicious! I slit a pocket in the side of the chicken breast & stuffed it with Boursin shallot & chive cheese. Next, browned it, transfer to baking dish & finished in the oven for 15-20 minutes, while I prepared the sauce in the pan. Made some rice, poured the sauce over the chicken. Turned out great!

Great, easy recipe. Does take longer to cook than mentioned, but was still pretty quick. Pretty foolproof, as I made some changes without incident: added lemon juice, used turkey instead of chicken, and dried chives instead of fresh. My family loved it.

This chicken was delicious- I would agree with the other cooks that it took longer to cook than prescribed, but I bet if you used a scallopini- type breast that it would work out as planned. I liked the mixture of flavors, however I did leave mine in the pan on the stove covered, so the breast didn't dry out- as a result, I think it was a little too moist and did not contrast well enough with the goat cheese in texture.

I've been making this one for years now. Instead of flattening the chicken, it seems to work best to slice a pocket in the breast, then roll the cheese mixture in an elongated ball, and put inside the pocket. Use a little more cheese for proper proportion with larger chicken breasts (you may be able to share). Easy enough for my college-age daughter to make for dinner.

Made this pretty much as written (except cooking time was more like 12 minutes). Quite good!

This recipe was so tasty, my fiance actually licked his plate! To make the sauce, it needed closer to 5 minutes to reduce enough (not 2 minutes).

I love this recipe. It's fast and tastee. It's a good way to serve more reasonable portions to because a half of a smashed chicken breast doesn't look puny.

This is quick, easy and very flavorful. The only change would be the cooking time - eight minutes would kill you it is so raw! I had to cook the chicken, covered, for over twenty minutes.

I added mrs. dash; green chili's, garlic & cilantro with the cheese & chives. I heated up the mixture for 10-15 seconds. Spread on flattened chicken then added more chopped chives & chili's. I then added a layer of Raspberry Jam (or any jam that you like). Roll it up, toothpick it. Put in baking dish, add Luna Di Luna Merlot-Cabernet; more chives,chili's & pepper to taste. Bake at 350 for 45 min.(until sauce is thickened). Put chicken in frying pan with a little olive oil (the lighter olive oil the better); brown, then put on plate, add sauce over top of chicken. I served with grilled squash, and egg plant (was soaked in butter, fresh garlic (Roasted & minced) & olive oil for while you get chicken ready. Squash & Eggplant go good with the sauce also.

I'm glad I followed my instinct and added juice from half a lemon, and thickened the sauce with 1/2 Tbls. each of cornstarch and water. Then it was four forks.

Lots of helpful reviews for this recipe -- thanks to all. I used several of the modifications suggested by other cooks: 1) added red pepper and shallot to the "filling," 2) added mushrooms and a little heavy cream to the sauce. I also browned the chicken over medium-high heat for a few minutes and then finished it in the oven -- I think it's less messy that way. A very nice dish!

I was a bit scared off by prior reviewers claims of bland-ness, and my wife doesn't like an overpowering taste of goat cheese, so here's what I did. I used cilantro instead of parsley (ironically, that's what I had to work with). I took about 1/4 cup of finely chopped red bell pepper, a little less chopped shallots, and 2 minced garlic cloves and sauteed them for about 7 mins. Cool that a bit and throw that into the cheese mixture. Fantastic!

This was delicious and quick. One of the myriad chicken breast recipes I've tried that I will definitely make again. I think my mom, who's coming to visit and isn't that familiar with goat cheese, would really enjoy this. In fact, if you needed a quick dinner for company, this would be a nice one. I served with sugar snap peas and a B&G chardonnay.

This has become my boyfriend's favorite dish. He likes to use Boursin cheese instead of montrachet. We also find that it's easier and less messy to bake the chicken than to cook it in a skillet. Once the chicken is cooked, we pour the juices into a skillet with white wine and reduce it.

I got rave reviews from my family for this one. Even my picky kids liked it and ate it up without being cajoled to eat like we normally have to! I made a few additions to this recipe. I added 2 cloves of garlic chopped and 1 tablespoon of chopped sun dried tomatoes to the cheese stuffing. I also deleted the parsley and cooked in the oven with some white wine. I added sliced mushrooms sauted to sauce. What a hit.

My husband and I felt it was good, but nothing special. But, did not have any real chicken stock on hand so used instant stock, which does affect quality of the sauce. Would use more cheese filling as well. Has possibilities with some additions however, and deglazing sauce with addition of mustard and bit of cream proved an amazing sauce instead.

I really liked this dish, and it was pretty easy to prepare. I added some sun-dried tomatoes and garlic to the goat cheese mixture, and it added a little zing. Very yummy.

The Chicken with Goats Cheese and Basil found on this web site is far superior. I didn't like frying the chicken..it made a mess.

I'd rather make this recipe in the oven and using a breast with a pocket. The frying takes away all the moisture. Otherwise, it's yummy.

I didnt have chicken breast so used thighs instead. Quite good! Probably better with the breast because more space for filling. Delicious left over the next day too.

Ignore cooking time in this recipe--unless you pound the heck out of the chix breasts, it's hard to tell w/the goat cheese stuffing if the chix is really cooked. Cook chix breast for 15+ minutes per side. I would recommend not to skimp on the brand of chix broth--I found that the no name brand that I used didn't work well in the sauce and I had to add more wine, let it really cook down for longer than I would have thought and then I added more salt. Go heavy on the pepper before cooking the chicken--the more the better! Overall...this entree is delicious and very, very easy...and looks so elegant. Previous review is correct in that it's a great after work meal on the run!

I found that the cooking time was not accurate. I had to cook it a lot longer than the recipe indicated.

If you are a fan of goat cheese, this is a winner. Cooking time is off - give it a good 15-18 minutes. Otherwise great recipe

Easy to make. I love the goat cheese and chicken flavor. Next time I'll add a little more cheese.

Previous reviewer are correct, there is a missing step after browing the chicken you must cook it a bit more. I threw it in the oven while I made the glaze. The second time I made it I saved a bit of effort by using herbed goat cheese instead of addind the chives and parsley which worked fabulously. Easy Easy Easy and very impressive. Great work-day dinner.

I really liked this and so did my guests. Make sure the chicken breasts are flattened enough!

This is a great recipe, but the instructions are missing one step. After you brown the chicken, add the wine and broth, cover and reduce heat to med.-low and cook about 8 minutes, until chicken is cooked through.

This recipe is fantastic! Not only is it very easy to prepare, but it's delicious and impressive to guests as well. It is a rich entree, so to complement the dish, I chose "simple flavor" accompaniments -- rice pilaf and steamed asparagus. Serve an oaky chardonnay and you're done! The meal was quite a treat and one I highly recommend.
