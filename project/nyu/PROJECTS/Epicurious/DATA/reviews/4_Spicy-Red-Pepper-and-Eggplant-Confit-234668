The best! Loved the roasted red peppers. Used fresh tomatoes, didn't need much oil. Delicious!

I also doubled the garlic and red pepper and used 1/2 the olive oil. I think the amount of olive oil depends on how much eggplants you have - you should have everything coated without being overly greasy. I roasted my batch for an extra 8 minutes - I thought this added to the caramelization and really released the sugars of all the vegetables. In the end, I served this on bagel chips with just a drop of aged balsamic for the perfect bite.

Very tasty dish, and not at all difficult. Way too much oil, though. Next time I'll use half the recommended amount. Also, use a lot more pepper flakes, if you like food spicy. The recipe amount didn't provide any kick at all.

Great dish! I've made it 3 times in the past month, but would definitely recommend using less olive oil.

Very yummy on crackers.

This dish was fantastic!! Instead of it being an appetizer I turned it into a main like another reviewer suggested. For me I doubled the garlic, added half an onion, tripled the red pepper flakes, added some oregano, and 3/4 cup olive oil. Roasted everything together then pureed it. Separately I browned some ground turkey then combined the meat and sauce in a pan to simmer. The sauce was to thick for pasta so I added some low sodium V8 juice and a bit of balsamic. Put over pasta with some romano cheese and it was delicious!!!!!! I love recipes that you can easily take them and turn them into something else, this one is a great foundation for so many yummy dishes.

very tasty. I doubled up the red pepper flakes and ate this on some triscuits. SOO GOOD.

Excellent summer dish. So versatile - be sure to drain tomatoes well, otherwise it can be watery and vegetables don't roast as well. I added a lot of extra garlic, some whole cloves some finely chopped. Also increased red pepper flakes as we like the kick. Next time might even add poblano peppers to the mix. Enjoy!

It was OK. My guests enjoyed it more than I did. Guess I prefer the old traditional eggplant caviar, although I did like the slight kick to this one.

I followed the recipe to the letter but once the sauce was finished roasting I pureed it. Then I finely chopped cooked, skinless chicken turkey sausage in my food processor and threw that in the mix and sliced kalama olives and added those as well. I served it over pasta. It was a very thick sauce but I used a little pasta water to thin and my dish turned out just perfect. My dinner guests could not stop talking about it. Will deffinately try this again and give the recipe to foodie friends.

This is sooooo good! And, so versatile. Good over spaghetti, in an omelet, on toast . . . I've made it both with all the oil and with half, it is better with all but still excellent with half.

Served by host who never reviews. She says a bit too oily, drained some off. It turned out too salty. But that is good.

This was YUM. I used about 1/3 cup of olive oil. Next time I will leave out the roasted peppers, which didn't add much. I'd use even more garlic though. This was delicious cold on crackers and warm tossed with pasta. Love that it's cheap, easy and vegan.

Utterly luscious. I served it with thinly sliced and toasted bread (spread some of the oil left in the pan on the bread before toasting it)and grilled rosemary lamb chops and dolmas (stuffed grape leaves) for an elegant fireside dinner. Add a bottle of red wine and you are set.

Quite yummy. Easy, quick. Followed recipe as is with the exception of cutting olive oil by half - I couldn't figure out why you would need a full cup. Served with ciabata bread and herbed gluten-free flat bread. Worked warm or cold. Was also tasty with some kalamata olives. Next time I will add another bell pepper and increase red pepper flakes as I didn't really notice much spice.

Loved this recipe. Took it to work for a buffet. Served crackers and toast points on the side. Got raves from all.

made it to near exact specifications except for red pepper flake...used a little extra black pepper and a touch of chili powder...best appetizer ever! Used it in omelets, pizza, on bread and on a spoon!

One more thing, thank you to whomever suggested fresh tomatoes. So glad I didn't use canned. Took the seeds out, but I'm not convinced that I needed to.

Took the suggestion from the intro to serve it on bread. crackers or whatever. Here's what I did: Added sweet yellow onion, chopped in a crescent shape. Used TJ jarred roasted pepper to save time (thanks for the suggestion). Also, as someone suggested, I only used enough oil to coat everything as I stirred it up before roasting. It was NOT a cup of oil, that's for sure. Roasted for 20 minutes. Got TJ's pizza dough and prepared it for the roasted veggies. Sprinkled the dough with a thin layer of finely grated parm. then the roasted veggies. Added a light layer of shredded fontina/parm. (Don't over cheese!) Baked at 400 for 15 minutes, then broiled until top was golden brown. Served it up. Fresh, fresh flavor. Drag. Nothing left for lunch tomorrow.

I love this recipe! I used well drained bottled roasted red peppers for convenience. This is also a wonderful side dish for any roasted or grilled meats and great on pasta! The flavors that develop from the slow roasting are incredible!

I am making a double batch of this today to put in the freezer (lots of eggplant to use up!) It is fabulous- we've had it on crackers, bread, or over pasta with sausage or kilbasa slices. Use 1/2 the oil- it is plenty. Used fresh tomatoes instead of canned because I had them- works fine.

This was FANTASTIC! Friends of ours brought it over for a dinner party and since then I've made it twice on my own. I did only use half the oil and it was just fine. We served with crusty bread. It's great over leftover pasta too.

Outstanding. My wife and I made a pizza out of this. After making the dough, we grilled it and tossed the Confit on top of the pizza dough with fresh mozzarella.

Delicious and so easy. I usually serve it with cevaps, little Serbian sausages, pita & feta. But I've also used leftovers on eggs, crackers, or potatoes. To make it even quicker, I've substituted jarred roasted red peppers and chopped San Marzano tomatoes. Just throw it all in a pan - and end with a dash of balsamic vinegar just before serving to make the flavors pop.

Excellent! Cut the oil by 1/2 and don't bother to roast the red pepper. It is fabulous on it's own, but we also put it on top of fresh pizza dough and topped it with fresh mozzarella.

We cut the oil in half (even a little less), and it turned out perfect. Definitely something we'll make again.

I made this for a party last week, it was so easy & so delicious. The only thing I did differently was that I did not pre roast the bell peppers. It worked out just fine. I will cut the oil down next time, it could do with a little less. Very good recipe.

Loved it. I used the grill for the whole process; I liked the smokiness that came through. I cut down the oil but found that if you grill uncovered, you'll end up adding some liquid or oil anyway.

This is fabulous! The only change I made is I reduced the olive oil by half. I put the confit over sliced toasted olive bread with kalamata olives and feta cheese on top. Yummy!

This was really great. Served it as an appetizer along with a spicy carrot salad and crusty bread as part of a Moroccan meal. Cut olive oil down to 1/2 cup. Wonderful!

Great flavor with slight modifications. I only used 1/2 c of olive oil, added about 1 tsp of cumin, 1/2 tsp of coriander, and 1/4 tsp of black pepper. I put the end result in the food processor. I'd like to try adding some kalamata olives next time.

We had this with sausage. It was very good. Not too rich, but a nice combination of flavors. I'm starting to enjoy eggplant for once!

Delicious, but way too much oil. I reduced it to 1/2 cup and lined the baking sheet with foil.

This was a big hit, with some very good cooks. One guest who didn't care for eggplant was prevailed upon to try it and wound up loving it. I made it a day ahead of time and at first it had quite a noticeable kick. By the second day it had calmed down and was really delicious. I agree that there was a lot of oil, but it seperated out and was easily pored off just before doing the final mix and then serving.

I love eggplant, hence we cook it many different ways. My husband went absolutely wild for this recipe - definitely a keeper. Served with toasted pita triangles. Wouldn't change a thing!

This was absolutly delicious. People who insisted they HATED eggplant ate most of it. The small amount leftover was used over pasta and was excellent!!

I made this appetizer for a family gathering and they all loved it. I found that the oil could be cut in half and if you wanted to save time, you could use roasted red peppers from a jar.

An eggplant dish for those who think they don't like eggplant. Serve with pickles and kalamat olives.

I am no where close to being an expert cook, but with the ease of preparation combined with the remarks on how well it tasted make this recipe a keeper. I actually pureed the mixture when it was done and cooled and I used low-fat, low-carb fresh tortillas for dipping.

This was so easy and delic. I served it w/crusty bread. Great the next day as well.
