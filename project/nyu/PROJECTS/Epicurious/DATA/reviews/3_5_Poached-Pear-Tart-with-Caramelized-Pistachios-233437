This was so not worth the time. It also grossed me out using cornstarch for the pastry cream because it caused the pastry cream to become this solidified goo that I had to soften up with more cream before I put it in the shell. Lots of other fabulous recipes out there to choose from. Saving grace was that the leftover wine syrup was fabulous with added sauteed shallot and rosemary on pan-fried rib eyes the following night.

This might be the best thing I've ever tasted in my life. Easy, but time consuming. Completely worth it!

Delicious. Worth the time to do (not difficult, just a bit time-consuming). Only mistake I made was to freeze it because right after it thawed the crust was very soggy.

Loved this delicious tart, worth the effort. Only made the mistake of freezing it - when it thawed out the crust turned soggy so beware!

Pears & pistachios? Love this combination! Did you know the fat in pistachios are the good fats like mono- and poly-unsaturated fats, which are recommended for heart health and circulation? check out www.orandiranch.com, pistachios handcrafted with Himalayan Pinksalt! Great Stuff!!!

Excellent! Lovely presentation. The wine reduction was delicious! A bit of work but well worth it!

The desert was just OK - my only deviation from the recipie was that i bought a pre-made pie crust (which was a mistake, because it wasn't tasty at all); my main issue was with the filling - while tasty, it was too sweet and a bit runny; the pears themselves turned out great. maybe next time, i'll serve them in a big martini glass with a bit of filling in the bottom.

I love this recipe though I have modified it quite a bit. My wife asked for a tart with pears and chocolate. This was the closest I came to. I didnt do the pistachios but substituted ground almonds instead which worked great. I then poured a layer of melted chocolate onto the pastry and let it cool before pouring in the pastry cream. It is delicious and always gets great comments

My wife wanted a pear and chocolate tart for her birthday. I took this recipe as a base and modified it rather successfully. I used the pastry base which was great, added a think layer of melted dark chocolate, made the custard sauce but used ground almonds instead and then the pears in that. The result got a 9.2/10 from my wife! It all worked very well and was suprisingly easy and fool proof to make

not too hard to make with the result being both impressive visually and in flavor

Made this dish for my grandfather's retirement party and people loved it. A very nice delicate balance of flavors. Ran into one problem: my wine syrup turned solid after I reduced it... Too long a cooking time? Anyone else have this problem? The tart was still yummy without it though.

Wow! An amazing holiday dessert. Time consuming to make, but so well received that it is worth the effort for a special occasion.

Great Holiday Dinner dessert. I made this as a complement to the Black Forest Torte from the same issue of the magazine. I took the advice of previous reviewers: mulling spices (yum), firm pears, etc. I also used dry roasted pistachios--couldn't quickly locate raw nuts. The trick is to prep all the day before and assemble as your guests arrive.

this was incredible. while it was a lot of work, it was completely worth it. be sure to not add the pistachios until right before you are about to serve it or else they will lose their delicious crunch and become dull mush.

Honestly I didn't think that this dessert was too much work. Certainly it wasn't any more effort than most special treats, plus a lot of the cooking is done ahead of time. It was beautiful and tasted great. The pastry cream was wonderful -- delicious and a beautiful green from the pistachios. My only change was to strain the milk/pistachio mixture before tempering the eggs. We tried it as written, but then the pastry cream was too gritty for our taste (maybe we didn't grind the pistachios finely enough). I thought it was worth the effort.

I am torn on this one - it had alot of interesting steps and was fun to make, but I wasn't 100% convinced the end result was worth it. I also thought the tart size was off. I think a 10" size pan would work better. The pears sure were gorgeous!

This was excellent, even with forgetting to put the pistachio brittle pieces on the tart; they are being enjoyed by themselves now! I made everything ahead of time and assembled right before my dinner guests arrived. I did cut my pears in half prior to poaching, but cored them after the poaching and after letting them sit on paper towels for about four hours. There was still a lovely red and white contrast. I received comments on how the delicious the crust was, unlike a previous reviewer that felt it was too heavy. Will definitely make again.

A great recipe. I didn't do the caramelized pistachios. And I added a few mulling spicesn(one whole star anise, three cinnamon sticks and a few whole cloves) to the poaching liquid. The spices really made it taste christmasy and it was gorgeous. But I defiitely wouldn't core and slice the pears until the end. If they were sliced at the beginning, they would be red all over and you'd miss that lovely red and white contrast that makes it look like a rose. The balance between the acidity of the pears and the heaviness of the pastry cream was perfect.

Made for Christmas dinner. Beautiful presentation. The flavor is great too. I thought the crust was too thick/heavy but not a reason to not do a repeat. Very time consuming preparation but worth it for a special occasion. I followed the recipe exactly.

Great dessert with a great presentation. I too am not a baker, but this desert got rave reveiws from everyone at Christmas dinner. I would not core the pears until I poached them (but be sure to start with semi-ripe ones). If you never have made a tart crust, you may want to put some beans on the crust while it cooks to keep the crust down.

Amazing! however next time I would cut and core the pears prior to poaching

First a confession, I'm a chef, not a baker. Tart looks great, but taste only fair. This dish was far too time consuming for the results. Christmas guests were kind and said it was "ok".

The best tart I have ever made. A little time consuming, but you make everything the day before so you can just put it together a few hours before I am ready to serve it. It was such a hit at dinner parties.
