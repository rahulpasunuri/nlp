I add red bell pepper per Alton Brown and before the lime juice, salt the whole mixture and let it weep for about 5 hours in the fridge.Then pour off excess water. Then only take the portion you are going to eat and add fresh lime juice to it. That way you can have fresh pico for about 5 days, just add the lime juice as you go.

I make this Pico recipe over and over for parties and even my true Mexican friends LOVE it. Its simple and TASTY. I usually skimp on the garlic or omit it all together and always use kosher salt, and in a word -- AMAZING. I have to quadruple the recipe and get chips for an army. Sometimes I wonder why I make any other apps :) Enjoy, I mean OLE' :)

Very good on fajitas, but agree with Bill that garlic doesn't belong. My recipe uses about half the tomatoes & no garlic. I will go back to that.

Great recipe. I added half an anaheim that had gone orange-red. Perfect!

I agree that this is a great basic pico de gallo recipe. As for some personal additions and preferences, I like to use a bit of mild garlic like elephant garlic, or substitute the white onion for vidalia or even shallots to get a more mild flavor. Salt is necessary; a bit of black pepper , chili powder, and especially cumin is great to add too. A bit of virgin olive oil can add a touch of richness. And lastly, a bit of fresh oregano adds a nice green spicy aspect to it.

I used Anaheim peppers instead and added some salt and it was great. Even though I doubled the recipe, my roommates had eaten it all in under an hour!

I cut down on the jalapenos, and next time I'll be using gloves to cut them. They burned my hands, but it was really worth it.

Great basic recipie, you can get a little fancier and add different peppers. I like to add some salt to the finished product and omit the garlic.

We made this to go with our sweet corn tamales for Christmas dinner. I left out the garlic and did use lime juice. We let it sit overnight. It lasted in the refigerator for two weeks. We loved it!

I made this late at night. It was relatively quick. Ingredients were easy to find. Tastes good- I added salt. My Dad decided it was too chunky and put it in the food processer- very small.

A favorite of ours when we are in the midst of being overwhelmed with tomatoes in August and September. Great on steak.

Loved Bill's simple recipe (below). Made it for July 4th, added tortilla chips, watched it vanish. The serranos didn't have quite enough punch for my taste, so next time I'll make it with jalapenos. Thanks, Bill!

Want the authentic pico de gallo? I lived in Mexico (Baja) for years and surfed (and ate) in Baja as a kid. Pico de gallo has five ingredients roma/plum (8 diced)tomatos, (1/2 diced) white onion, (1 1/2 TBLS minced)cilantro, (1 to 2 minced)serrano (I prefer them over jalepeno, but jalepeno will work), (to taste)sea salt (or the regular kind, sea salt tastes better to me) and good 'ol H20. Now this receipe may vary from region (although slightly) to region in Mexico is the basic pico de gallo. Please do not add garlic to pico de gallo, garlic is good on a lot of things but not on this. Lime sometimes is called for in pico de gallo but I feel you already have the acid from the tomatoes, but adding lime isn't spelling disaster:)

I found this recipe to be on the bland side inspite of adding more jalapeno and garlic. I am in search of a really flavorful Pico De Gallo recipe like you get in Mexico. This wasn't it - too much work for the outcome.

Pico de gallo is my favorite thing in the world to eat. This recipe isn't too spicy for my taste. I have had trouble with the heat in other recipes in the past. This is perfect.

We have made this receipe 4 times since it came out in the July issue of Bon Appetite. Not only is it wonderful on steaks it is as good on grilled chicken.

A favorite mexican restaurant in Burbank, CA prepares this special for my husband and I. Tastes great with a few finely diced serrano chilies and some fresh diced avocado. The longer it sits before serving the more the flavors marry.
