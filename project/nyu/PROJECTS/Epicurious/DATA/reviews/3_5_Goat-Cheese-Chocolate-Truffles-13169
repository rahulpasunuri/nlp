Oh, wow! These truffles were absolutely delicious. I made sure I got fresh, local goat cheese, and the mix of chocolate and cheese was divine. If you want to see the process of preparing them or how they turned out for me, just go to my blog's link! HappyLifewithFood http://wp.me/pVc4r-1Q

Wow, these are really different but delicious. They kind of remind me of a chocolate icing that has sour cream...but better! I've been doing a lot of experimenting with chocolates and didn't want to start off with expensive chocolate so I only used Baker's. This definitely got the go ahead for a Scharfenberger!

Wonderful, easy recipe for very decadent treats. I substituted fresh grated lemon rind for the extract and it worked beautifully.

These are spectacular. I make goat cheese and having fresh cheese is definitely part of the success. I use Chambord and other liquers at times and vary the coatings from cocoa, espresso powder, cinnamon and chipotle. Love 'em with a big bold glass of red wine.

The goat cheese and chocolate compliment each other in an incredible way. The texture of these truffles is also a bit different from the standard ganache truffles, but in a good way. They have a bit more tooth and substance to them. This is now my usual truffle recipe and to change it up I just switch out the vanilla for other flavorings.

I'll give this recipe the benefit of the doubt and figure that I did something wrong. I did not care for these at all and I am a HUGE goat cheese fan. I thought the cheese overpowered the chocolate in a very unflavorful way. I may try this again-although there are too many other truffle recipes in here that I love.

These are special... deliciously speaking. Make sure to use fresh goat cheese, as the use of cream goat cheese will give a too powerful "goaty" taste. If you can't find fresh goat cheese, then use cream goat cheese but cut it with fresh cow cheese... I also added lemon zest and used lemon juice instead of lemon extract. Another personal touch: I dipped half of each truffle in melted white chocolate then covered the other half with cocoa powder. It gives a very original look to it AND it is delicious.

I adore these and make them often. Sometimes I carmelize a little lemon zest and throw that in, too! I also dust them in a 1:1 of cocao powder and confectioners' sugar, not too mixed (they acqire a beautiful spotted pattern). Delicious.

I had such high expectations for this recipe because of my love for both chocolate and goat cheese. I know I followed this recipe to a 'T', but the 1:1 ratio of chocolate to goat was too much. The goat cheese overpowered everything else, and most of my guests couldn't even finish one truffle. Shoot. So, maybe the combo is a 'required taste', and I hope you like it, but now you've been duly warned if you don't. :)

These truffles were amazingly easy to prepare. Everyone at the Valentine's Day party loved them. The smooth texture and tang of the goat cheese provides an unexpected experience. Next to the boxed "gormet" chocolate truffles, I most deffinetly prefered these. Next time, and there will deffinetly be a next time, I will try coating them with melted chocolate to give each truffle more of a punch. In which case, I plan on refridgerating them for longer than half an hour. All in all, this desert was divine.

I was excited to try this recipe because a friend of mine brought me blue cheese truffles from Quebec a while back and they were amazing. I use Vermont Butter & Cheese Co. goat cheese. It is smooth and delicate. So many goat cheeses in the stores now are of inferior quality and have too much bitterness - the Vermont cheese is terrific (on salads too!). One cooking note: when initially combining ingredients, have your goat cheese at room temperature in order to combine properly. Mine was cold and when I combined the goat cheese mixture with the chocolate, it firmed the chocolate immediately, making it difficult to combine. These are great - lots of friends loved them!

This recipe, to my taste, is rather extraordinary. However, it is definitely for a cultured palate, and does not appeal equally to all tastes. I've made this several times, and while most of my guests like these, I'd say only about 20% really like them, and about 20% find the complex combination of bittersweet chocolatte, bitter cocoa and goat cheeze to be simply overpowering. I like to use an aged goat cheeze, but to make the dish more appealing to a broader range of tastes, use a fresh goat cheeze.

These were different and good, but the goat cheese tang was a little too pronounced for my taste. I may try making again, substituting mascarpone for half the goat cheese.

These are divine. We served them at our wedding and every fancy party we've thrown since and they always disappear at once. Not overly sweet - definitely an adult dessert - but a truly decadent one.

I've been making truffles for several years, and this recipe sounded odd but I figured I'd give it a try. I found the goat cheese gave the truffles a tangy sour flavor that I didn't like much. I guess I like my truffles to taste like a dessert.

Wonderful flavor contrasts and texture. I coated with chocolate and decorated with white chocolate and served with a good bottle of port wine.

This recipe was incredibly easy and truly delicious. The texture and flavor of the truffles were just right: the goat cheese gives the flavor a twist. Also, these are truly for savoring, not gobbling: the after-taste was wonderful!

This sounds odd, but it is delicious. Very creamy with just a hint of the goat cheese flavor and the bit of citrus. If the idea of combining these is putting you off, plunge in! You'll be glad you did when the first truffle melts in your mouth. Note: work fast and keep ingredients cold.
