This was good when served soon after removing from oven. I put it under a broiler for about 15 seconds, and sure enough, it got a little curdled, something I didn't notice till I tasted leftovers the next day, cold. I think the all-chocolate bread pudding, with the chocolate melted into the custard mixture, is better, but I did like the cinnamon and nutmeg flavor, which I will add to another recipe.

I made this with japanese white bread. I think it worked very well with the recipe. I was a bit disappointed by the recipe because it was a bit lacking in sweetness. I would add a bit more sugar to the custard next time, or use a sweeter chocolate (I used 66% bittersweet chocolate). In addition, I couldn't figure out how to caramelize the top with a blowtorch without burning the bread. I ended up with a burnt top.
