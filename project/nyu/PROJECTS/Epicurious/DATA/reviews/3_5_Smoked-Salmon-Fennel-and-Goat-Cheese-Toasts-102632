I have made these beautiful and tasty crostini's at lease two dozen times and they never disappoint.Such a beautiful presentation. Use good quality salmon and it is best if you do not toast the bread ahead of time.The combo of goat cheese and fennel is wonderfully paired.

Made these for husband's 50th birthday. They went VERY quickly. Love the fact that you can prepare the spread the day before so are really easy and quick to assemble last minute if necessary.

Delicious and so simple to make! The fennel added such a wonderful depth to the appetizer and using good quality smoked salmon is definitely important. I added a little drizzle of olive oil and a little extra black pepper after topping the salmon. Overall we loved it!

This is a sure hit and very easy to make. I have made it a dozen times and gets ohs and aahs from my dinner guests. It makes a nice bring along for a pot luck dinner. It is delicious!

I've made this for two events now and everyone loved it...including me! The tarragon is delicious with the smoked salmon and goat cheese. I don't recommend using lox...it's not as good as whole smoked salmon.

I've made these for parties several times, and they always disappear quite quickly. The key is getting the really good salmon.

I love this appetizer. I have made it a dozen times and everyone loves it! Use good quality smoked salmon. A beautiful sophisticated presentation. Do not prepare toasts to far in advance because they tend to get "chewy".

This was just okay. It was just a way to fancy up some Goat Cheese - which would have been fine on it's own. I found it to be too lemony. I was a bit disappointed because the other reviews made it sound wonderful & it was just okay.

These were wonderful. I have been dreaming about them since I made them for my New Year's party. They present so well, place them on a plain white platter, as the salmon color, combined with the fennel and lemon peel garnish looks great. They get a little soggy if you prepare them too much in advance, so try to put them together at the last minute. Very elegant.

Excellent. My family and friends love it. Be sure to make everything, except the toast a day in advance. Quick and easy....

I really liked this dish. The goat cheese combination was very tasty and I would make just that again for crackers even if I didn't add the smoked salmon. I really liked the slight licorice flavor that these had.

Everyone like these and the display was beautiful. I wasn't crazy about them, I thought the cheese spread was a little tart.

This was really good. I couldnt quite taste the tarragon, and might skip it next time. Also, beef up the amount of black pepper. But it looked so special, and is the perfect coctail party food.

This was easy, elegant and delicious. I served these at Thanksgiving, to a family of cooks, and everyone could not stop talking about them. The flavor is unique, complex, and I agree that they would taste wonderful with a glass of champange.

I made these for a Sunday brunch and they were delicious. I used some herbed goat cheese as well as plain. I did the toast points ahead of time, but would recommend doing them as close to serving time as possible. I'll definitely make them again!

Wonderfully unusual and very popular. With fennel and tarragon it can be very licorice-ish, but the lemon zest seems to counteract it well. Salmon should be strongly flavored (or piled on) to compete.

Everyone at my house loved this recipe. We are going to use it for my husbands 40th birthdayparty.

This was a huge hit at a recent dinner party. I brushed the baguette slices with lemon-flavored olive oil. I used leftover smoked salmon and goat cheese in scrambled eggs the next morning!

Served these for Thanksgiving and there were none left by the time I got to them! They were also very easy to prepare ahead and assemble as guests arrive.

This is always a crowd pleaser in our home especially when accompanied by champagne or French 76 champagne cocktails. I usually add lemon juice (to taste) to the goat cheese mixture.

I made an assortment of tartine-like appetizers for a small cocktail party and these were the first to go! Everybody absolutely loved them and the presentation was beautiful. Easy to prepare ahead of time (half-hour or so) and delicious. I am not even that crazy about salmon, but I ended up falling in love with this recipe anyway.

Delicous and beautiful! The fennel, lemon, tarrgon goat cheese spread was a wonderful marriage of flavors alone but when topped with the salmon superb!

This may be my favorite recipe on the whole site. Be sure to use fresh tarragon and a mild goat cheese and let the mixture sit in the fridge for a few hours.

This recipe was a hit and easy to make. The combination of fresh tarragon, crushed fennel and lemon zest was especially nice although I did minimize the fennel by a wee bit. Fresh ingredients seemed to be essential. I can't imagine the taste being equivalent with dried tarragon. Presentation was easy and elegant.

although it was easy to make, it was a little too time consuming for something not that great in taste. however, it was very pleasing to the eyes which helped in the presentation.

I've never made the recipe with the fennel, but substituted herb de Provence from Dean and Deluca, and have received great reviews from my guests. The combo of lemon zest and the goat cheese is fantastic.

This is a fabulous appetizer - served with good, dry Champagne and gone in minutes at Easter dinner! Perhaps the people who didn't care for the goat cheese flavor used one that was too stong. Some are pretty "goaty" tasting. Try the mildest kind next time. Also be sure to use the best smoked salmon you can afford. It makes a big difference. The tarragon was really good, but would be great with fresh fennel or dill instead.

I have made this dish on numerous occations and it has always been a big hit. I never seem to have time to make the toasts so I use small round melba toasts instead.

I made these for a potluck and people seemed to like them. However, I thought the lemon and the fennel flavors were overpowering. Not worth the effort. I prefer cream cheese or Neufchatel. I would also use other herbs.

I made these twice during the holidays. This is a very flexible recipe---a winner in every way. I could never find tarragon so I searched for a substitute that would have a licorice flavor. The first time, I used a shot of Pernod---excellent. The second time I used fresh chervil---more subtle but still excellent and pretty. The first time I made them I didn't have time to assemble them, so I mixed up the cheese and let guests assemble their own. I didn't even make toasts---just set out a baguette. All of it was devoured.

I used fresh fennel fronds on top instead of tarragon. All of my guests enjoyed it very much. also very attractive and easy.

One of our New Year's Eve Appetizer's! Everyone loved them - gone in a flash. We cut the fennel to 2/3's. DELICIOUS!

Delicious. If you make the spread a day ahead, it really adds to the flavor...the fennel and spices have time to really meld with the cheese. Family and friends could not get enough. Great for dinner or as a Sunday Brunch treat. Easy to make and everyone raved...what more could you ask for.

The lemon was overpowering.

My husband and I made these for Christmas dinner. The guests seemed to like them as all but one were eaten. One guest in particular raved about them but I personally would have preferred cream cheese or Boursin with the salmon instead of the fennel goat cheese. I don't think that I'll make them again because I don't think that they're worth the work involved in making them or the expense of fresh goat cheese.

We made them as appetizers for Xmas eve dinner ; it was a phenomenal success. Since I don't like fennel, my husband which is the one who cook during holidays, used celery seeds. It works very well.

Couldn't find fresh tarragon, so we left it out. Still tasted great. Very easy to prepare and a nice presentation.

I made this for my annual Christmas luncheon and I loved them. It was great to be able to toast the baguette slices as well as make the goat cheese spread two days ahead to save time that morning. I needed to warm the goat cheese a little to make it easier to spread on the toasts.

This was a wonderful appetizer that got gobbled up by my guests while sitting around with glasses of wine before dinner. The addition of fennel & lemon to the goat cheese was delicious with the combination of smoked salmon on top. Very appealing to the eye also. Great that it can be made ahead of time and just assemble once your guests arrive.

I've made this recipe twice, as it's that special. The bit of lemon & tarragon on the top made each bite really POP! Toasts, sliced very thin, stayed crisp...great for doing ahead.

I made these for a dinner party last night. The cheese spread had a wonderful flavor. Made some with baguette slices and some with crackers--the crackers were better and less work.
