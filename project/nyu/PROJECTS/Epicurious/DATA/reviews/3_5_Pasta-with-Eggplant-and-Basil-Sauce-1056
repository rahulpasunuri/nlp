This dish is awesome. Although we some flavorful additions (venison sausage and roasted tomatoes) I am confident that the wonderful combination and proportions of the herbs and rich flavors with the fresh veggies will be just as satisfying when I try it again without the additions. Except for the additions, I followed the recipe and was very happy happy with the flavor and spice. It didn't require additional salt and pepper on the table!

I give this recipe 3 forks but that is after my alterations! Lots of reviewers said it was tastless so I sauteed 4-5 slices of bacon to start. Then I made it as suggested using fresh herbs. When it was done it was really dull. I added 2-3 spoonfulls of tomato paste, dried chillies and salt. It ended up as very tasty. Next time I would use more bacon.

instead of broth I used white wine and butter. This intensified the flavor. I also added a scotch bonnet pepper which gave it the zip it needed. A very healthy dish.

I agree with other reviewers that it's bland and needs red pepper and salt. I used pecans as no pine nuts available. Would not serve to company as it's not visually appealing.

I read the reviews of other cooks and thought this will be a good dish. But to my utter dismay,..it was YUCK! I wasted so much of my time chopping and cooking but all in vain. I will never make this dish again!

Pretty good. I made with extra pine nuts, extra broth(a whole can) and extra salt (it needed it). Agree it could have used the crushed red pepper; was a little bland without. I too used fresh herbs and would do the same again. Served with garlic bread and a tossed green salad with blue cheese and strawberries. Yum!

This is a wonderful vegetarian dish that I have made several times for company. My only criticism is that it is slightly too dry, so I add a bit of extra broth.

Fabulous!!! It needed more broth to saute than originally called for and I used fresh not dried herbs (3 tsp fresh = 1 tsp dried) I also cut the pasta down to 1/2 pd as my husband and I tend to like additional sauce. I used walnuts instead of pine nuts (it's what I had available) Will make it again for company the same way. FABULOUS!! Tasty!! Great dish.

This dish was fantastic and healthy! I added chicken breast and would suggest maybe adding some crushed red pepper for added flavor. It also needs quite a bit of salt. I will make this again soon!
