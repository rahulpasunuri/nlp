We all loved the flavors in this one. After reading other reviews I cut sugar by 25%. Next time I will cut it in half instead.

Good but not great. Very tart.

Used a combo of this and the Spiced Cranberry sauce recipe from this site for an advance recipe for this Thanksgiving and if my guests love it as much as I do, I will be very happy, and so will they!

This was just terrific. Will definitely make again. I also reduced the sugar to 3/4s cup of sugar and added 1 tablespoon of brandy!

Wonderful! The comments were that this cranberry sauce was worthy of being dessert. The smell of cloves in the kitchen is reason enough to make this!

This is awesome. Every year my office and family request this cranberry sauce and it's so easy to make.

I submitted the first review for this dish and I'm now reporting back after serving it at Thanksgiving. It was a huge hit; everyone raved and even the pickiest kid had seconds. I used 3/4 cup sugar instead of a full cup and I think that improved the taste, as the original recipe was just a tad too sweet. This one goes in my permanent recipe file!

My dad loves basic cranberry sauce (made from the recipe on the bag!), but he announced that this was the best cranberry sauce he's ever had. I actually used ground ginger, rather than fresh, but the ginger flavor was still apparent. This will probably become a regular on my holiday table.

This was so yummy...I used 4 cups cranberries (vs. 3 cups) and cut the sugar back to 3/4 cup. It was tart, but the spices offset it for a really great combo. I ended up not using the fresh ginger...when I make it again, I'll add it in, but will probably cut it back to no more than 1 tsp.

This was easy and really good. It's a little sweeter than the other cranberry sauce versions I've made, but the spices give it a lot of flavor and I think the kids will really like it this year. I'll report in again after Thanksgiving.

This was easy and really good. It's somewhat sweeter than the version I usually make with port and dried figs, but it's very refreshing, and I'm sure the kids will love it. I'll report again after Thanksgiving.
