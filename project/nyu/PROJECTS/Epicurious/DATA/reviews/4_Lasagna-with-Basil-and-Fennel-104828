This is my go to recipe with some adjustments to make it vegetarian. I use veggie sausage from GoLean, a veggie based broth and add a lot more fennel seeds. I tear the basil as I also find the whole leaves less appetizing. I boil lasagna noodles before I assemble as like the taste better and cook for about 30-35 minutes. For a guest who didn't like sausage flavor, I added kidney beans instead, processing them to a coarse puree.

An excellent, tasty, warming dish for any autumn evening. I added about 4 cloves of garlic - What the hell spaghetti seasoning sauce is, is a total mystery on this side of the Atlantic so that went out the window. I also gave a little squeeze of "easy chili". Have the left overs for dinner tonight... Man up on the basil, use plenty it makes the dish

Great taste and an easy lasagna to make. I only used 1 packet of spaghetti seasoning and it was enough. I also added 1/2 lb of ground turkey as we like a meaty lasagna. Will definately add to my winter dinner rotation!

I really liked the parmesan/ricotta/mozzarella filling in this lasagne recipe. Wasn't huge on the whole basil leaves, as I found the texture disconcerting. I'd make it again after tweaking it a little.

The only thing I changed was to substitute pork sausage for beef, and to use a bit more basil than recommended. The recipe is really wonderful, and tastes much richer than the time invested.

This was a great recipe for a no-boil lasagna. However, I think it's too much fennel, I would cut the fennel in half next time. I had crushed the seeds up, then added my own Italian herbs instead of the spaghetti spice packs. I will make this again with modefications.

This lasagna is great! I made it exactly as written for the first time for company and they raved. I was hesitant to use the spaghetti seasoning but they had it at my grocery store and it didn't have MSG so I tried it...very tasty - I think it had a little extra kick than just using italian sesasoning. Don't skip the basil or fennel - they are what makes it! Next time I am going to try with red wine instead of white.

I love this recipe! I've made it twice for larger gatherings, and have received only raves. With both dinners, I substituted ground turkey for the ground beef, and I think it tasted the same as if I'd used ground beef. And, as the recipe states, using the no boil noodles does cut down on the prep time. I made two pans of this recipe for the first gathering, and that was a little crazy, but it wasn't very time consuming the second time, when I only cooked one pan. I can not recommend this recipe highly enough!

I had to modify this recipe as my husband is lactose intolerant. I replaced the ricotta cheese with a bechamel sauce (lactose free milk, flour, romano and goats cheese & roasted garlic. I substituted mozzarella with lactose free Lappi (very close to mozzarella but with a bit more of a bite) and the parmesan with romano (sheeps cheese). I too was not comfortable with the packets of seasoning so I simply made a zesty tomato sauce with crushed tomatoes, garlic, oregano, etc. As well, I used whole wheat noodles instead of no-boil. Other than the modifications above, I followed the recipe as written (grin). My guests could not believe that this was lactose free!!! It was devoured with compliments a plenty! Great recipe. I normally don't modify this much and publish, but maybe this can help another lactose free family...

This, by far, is the best lasagna recipe I ever prepared. The fresh basil leaves is what makes it sooo good. As per some other reviewers, I substituted the spaghetti sauce seasoning with 3 Tablespoons of Italian seasoning. This one is a keeper. I suggest serving it with "Garlic Bread with Pecorino Romano Butter" also on Epicurious.

This was delicious! I added a can of tomato sauce and a little bit of honey to the recipe. I used 2 packets of spaghetti sauce seasoning (following the recipe) but I thought that it came out too salty. Next time, I will only use 1 packet.

I requested this for Father's Day from a family that mostely relies on me for the cooking. Turns out even an amateur can turn it out deliciously using this recipe. And regarding the conversions: we couldn't get fresh basil, and dumping 22x5gram packets of spaghetti seasoning seemed patently ridiculous, so I told my family to use two tablespoons of basil, one tablespoon of oregano, and two teaspoons of marjoram. No problem! The only funny thing about this recipe is at the end, to reserve extra sauce for another use?? We increased the meat in the sauce by 50%, and still barely had enough. Upping the meat though, and upping the fennel seeds just a bit, this recipe is fantastic.

I loved this lasagna. The onlyproblem for me was converting the measurements into french. I made this two times each time it was excellent but the initial stress of converstion was almost enough to quit.I'm so happy I didn't give up. My french friends are shocked when they learn there are three cheeses. They loved it. Even the french chef in our group.

This was excellent! All of my dinner guests loved it, and one guest ate 4 or 5 large pieces! The basil is what really makes it, but I also love that this recipe calls for no-bake noodles and lean ground beef rather than fatty Italian sausage. I found 3 types of spaghetti sauce seasoning at my local Pick n Save (in the aisle w/all of the seasoning PACKETS--not the regular spice aisle), & I believe the brand this recipe is referring to is McCormick's Italian Style Spaghetti Sauce Mix Flavored w/Mushrooms. I cut up the basil (the recipe doesn't call for that) and I used red onions, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I was skeptical about using "spaghetti sauce seasoning," but the results were irrefutably delicious. I will definitely make this one again!

fyi- this is pretty meaty and not very saucy. no bake noodles are important to soak up the juices. used ital seas. instead of spag sauce seas.

This was a great lasagna recipe! I had it once before, but on this time around I substituted some Pecorino Romano for the Parmesan. That added a bit more saltiness, but was just about right for my taste. The fresh basil will always be a must have in future lasagnas.

I don't see what the big fuss is all about. Really, the only thing that made this half way interesting was the fennel and a decent amount of fresh basil.

Well, after four grocery stores, I've decided there's no such thing in Massachusetts as "spaghetti sauce seasoning with mushroom flavors", so I substituted jarred spaghetti sauce with mushrooms instead of the mix/canned tomatoes. Made the rest of the recipe exactly as written, BUT substituted soy crumbles for ground beef. NO ONE COULD TELL. This recipe is just delicious, and was a tremendous hit with the family.

This has been my standby lasagna recipe for years - it always receives great reviews. The only change I make is to use a tomato cream sauce seasoning packet instead of that with nushrooms as called in the recipe. The first time I made it I couldn't find the seasoning packet called for and bought the tomato cream instead. It received such rave reviews I have used it since.

It was my first time making lasagna and this recipe is terrific. Based on my experience and the prior reviews, this recipe can't be screwed up. My glass baking dish was too small so I had to make the recipe with only two layers of noodles and less of all the ingredients, and I was out of white wine so I used red, and I had no spaghetti spices (whatever the heck those are) so I used 4 Tbs of grocery store Italian dried herbs, and the thing still turned out great. I made it for a friend -- she was insanely impressed and now thinks I'm supercook. P.s., You might want to try my version, it turns out very light for a lasagna with more ricotta mixture and basil versus less meat and noodles. Sort of a ladies' lite version, and very tasty.

Make this &. don't skimp on the basil use italian sausage instead of grnd.beef and also use at least 3tsp of fennel. I agree w/ others use italian seasoning about 3-4 tbs. I am not shy with spices. It's very good. Enjoy

I followed this recipe exactly with one exception. I also substituted italian seasoning for the spaghetti sauce seasoning. Very cheesy and not dry at all. Next time, however, I will reduce the cheese and add a little more tomato/tomato sauce to suit my family's taste. Everything else will stay the same...great flavor!

I added italian spice instead of the 2 packets of seasoning and used some dried porcini mushrooms in the sauce. All in all a very good recipe and relatively easy to make. The fennel and basil definitely add to the intersting flavors.

I made this lasagna as the recipe indicates, except for making an extra half for the crowd over on Superbowl Sunday. I found the amount of parmesan a little overwhelming, making it a little salty. The fennel and basil were not noticeable due to the sharpness of the cheese. I will cut down on its amount next time and try adding red wine to the sauce, rather than the white as recommended by other reviewers. Otherwise, it had a good consistency and the "oven ready" noodles worked out great!

this was the best lasagna recipe I have ever used! the only changes I made were omitting the fennel and using italian spices and seasonings in place of the spaghetti seasoning packets. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly and it turned out great. The basil added an awesome kick and the sauce was thick and hearty.

This lasagna had wonderful flavor. The basil really makes it. I made this last weekend during the football playoffs and even the kids wanted more!If you are searching for a lasgna recipe with an unique, but sensational, flavor, look no further.

This is VERY good. I have a catering company and was asked to make a vegetable lasagne for 2 nights of the boat parade, so I used this recipe omitting the ground beef (obviously) and used italian seasonings instead of the packaged sauce seasoning mix. I followed the rest exactly but chopped zuch and yellow squashes, tossed in olive oil and a little kosher salt and oven roasted for 45 mins at 400, stirring frequently, sauteed mushrooms and used all the veggies instead of the meat. The guests RAVED and even the men came back for seconds. I also offered a meat lasagne and while that did go faster, this was a HUGE hit. The fennel seed adds alot and shouldn't be omitted. I will use this ricotta mixture in other lasagne recipes as well. But with meat I add freshly ground nutmeg to it and omit the fennel from the sauce. Try this, you'll be very pleased.

I made this lasagna for a dinner party, and it was a huge hit. The fennel adds a dimension of flavor that most lasagna recipes don't have. Quite a few of my guests - all college students like myself, and not necessarily inclined to notice such things - asked me what it was, and all said they thought it was delicious. I'm going to make this for another dinner party in a few days.

Tasty, easy and a big crowd pleaser. I found this recipe to be a hit. I used red wine instead of white and found the sauce to be really tasty. Leaves a decent amount of sauce left over as well which can be fun.

This was my first attempt at lasagna, and it was an absolute hit. The fresh basil was wonderful. I used red wine instead of white (can't really imagine it with white, actually). At the request of my boyfriend, I made half of the pan with mozzarella, and the other half with pepper jack cheese. I was worried the flavors would clash, but it turned out surprisingly great - the pepper jack half tasted like I had just added red pepper - it was spicy-good! I also cooked the meat sauce, uncovered, about 5 minutes longer than it said, and I was able to use all of the meat sauce in the lasagna. The meat sauce is good enough to be eaten by itself over pasta. Yum!

I enjoyed this recipe very much, I chose to leave out the meat and substitute it with about a pound of fresh sliced mushrooms and a few layers of fresh spinach. I had guest over and one actually asked what type of sausage I had used, the fennel seed had tricked her into thinking that there was sausage in the Lasagna since fennel is often a seasoning in sausage. I also seasoned my sauce with salt, 6 cloves of garlic, and fresh ground pepper in addition to the fennel and onion. It was just as easy as using a seasoning packet and allows for a more personal touch. In addition, I ran low on sauce and I was worried about the dish being dry so I added an additional cup of white wine at the last minute, just poured it on top. This will be a regular dish from my kitchen!

I have been an avid Epicurious follower for years but have never before bothered to submit a rating even though I've tasted dozens and dozens of fabulous recipes. I am also not a lasagna lover. However this dish was hands down fabulous! Everyone is still raving! Didn't change a thing - except that I was about a cup short on basil. Unbelievable nevertheless-and very easy. A must try!

This was an excellent recepie. It's different from most lasagne's. I liked the fresh basil and the fennel seeds, along with white wine. I also added a few more spices to pep it up. I have made this so many times and everyone who I give the recipe too, say it was a hit with their guests as well! That's definitely something I will make again!!

I have never been a huge fan of lasagna. (or any other heavy Italian food) However, this is my favorite lasagna recipe. I made this for a party of 40 this summer and am going to make it this weekend for a group of seven. It's a welcome change from the old stand-by.

I made this for our Christmas Eve gathering and it was a hit! I used the no-boil noodles which I believe bake firmer, but still get a little soft. The sauce mixture really makes this dish with the basil and fennel and fresh tomatoes. I can't wait to make it again.

Okay, who is the wise guy who invented the "no boil" noodles?! Now I have absolutely no excuse to stay away from making lasagna and this delicious recipe! The ONLY thing I changed is that I used Zinfandel red wine because I was also making the Zinfandel Salad Dressing at this site, which is also wonderful, by the way... I love the combination of fennel seeds and basil in this and I'm afraid I feel myself growing into another dress size! Enjoy! KIMBER

I loved the subtle fennel flavor in this dish! I made a couple of adjustments to the recipe - italian style canned tomatoes and canned tomato sauce, large wonton wrappers in place of lasagna noodles and ground turkey breast in place of beef. It was the best lasagna I've ever made.

This is a great find! I used 2 bottles of prepared spaghetti sauce rather than the pkgs and canned crushed tomatoes--it worked out well. The fennel and basil are wonderful -- quite a nice, subtle change from everyday boring lasagna. Try it -- it's a keeper!
