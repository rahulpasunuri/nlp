Very good and had extra cheese mix I used to stuff sweet peppers the next nite.

Tasty. Made exactly per recipe and the components were all excellent and it rolled and presented nicely. Should have read the comments about heating after rolls made. I didn't like the cold temperature of the filling. Would make a gain but heat before serving.

I use Trader Joe's frozen marinated grilled eggplant and zucchini. I add spinach and garlic to the cheese and make the rolls. Lay them in a pan, pour the sauce over, shred some parm on top and bake for about 30 minutes to make sure it's heated through. The perfect weeknight dinner.

This was a good solid recipe. Like others suggested, I added some spinach to the cheese mix and heated everything in the oven for about 5 min to heat the cheese mixture. Overall, I liked the recipe but thought it was a little too much work for the outcome.

So simple. So yummy. This may be my new go-to sauce.

Flavor was great. I found this hard to keep warm. Maybe it could be reheated before serving. I sauteed eggplant because my grill wasn't working.

I grilled the eggplant on a gas grill and after rolling them with the cheese, I set them on the top shelf to warm while the rest of dinner grilled. Excellent. Could have made a whole meal (well, almost)of just them.

I agree about the skin which my husband loves. It is tough to roll without it, but it does remove easily once it is rolled.

I stuffed mine with ground turkey, once browned (didn't stuff well) and once with trukey formed into small rolls and added sauted spinach. Delicious!

I broiled the eggplant slices as others have done and it worked just fine. I used a homemade tomato sauce (my grandmother's recipe) and baked in the oven after stuffing and rolling the eggplant. Tasted much better with the ricotta warmed. My husband, the carnivore, loved it and didn't even notice there wasn't any meat in it! I have to admit it is a light dish and definitely needs an accompaniment.

Great side dish (especially when your avoiding carbs). I added a bit more pepper flakes because I wanted a truly spicy sauce. I also stacked (rather than rolled) the eggplant and cheese blend before popping them in the oven for a few minutes. Delicious!

This is a great refreshing and light change from the normally heavy feeling of an eggplant Parmesan. We didn't have the traditional eggplants. Our were more round. But the recipe worked really well by just stacking up three slices with filling.

An OK alternative to the breadcrumbed eggplant parm, but for me it didn't pack a ton of flavor. Would maybe try seasoning the eggplant more or adding some cooked spinach to the cheese mix. A good healthy version nonetheless.

I'd recommend adding an egg to the cheese mixture, as well.

Fantastic recipe. Next time I would remove the skin completely, in my opinion there's just no good way to avoid the toughness. When I did make this, I tweaked the seasonings to my tastes in both the filling and the sauce, baked them in a lasagna dish with a light layer of Mozz and chopped basil on the top. Really the finest use of eggplant I've come across.

My sister is visiting for the weekend. She's a foodie and I'm a vegetarian so I wanted to make something that the two of us could enjoy for dinner. This meal was deelish! I would definitely make it again. This was the first time that I have ever cooked eggplant and I'm so pleased with the turnout.

Rating: 3
As others mentioned, it should be heated a bit after assembling because of the cold ricotta filling. We did make our own sauce with hot pepper, italian parsely, basil, garlic, oregano, currants (for fun and because we omitted the sugar), salt & pepper. Eggcellent use of eggplant!

I love grilled eggplant and was not disapointed with this recipe. The only change I made was to add a clove of roasted garlic to the filling (because I had it leftover and wanted to use it). The only thing I would have liked was less of a contrast between the warm egglplant and cool filling. Might try to warm it in the oven as others have done.

This was really yummy. It was served at a "gourmet club" dinner party as an appetizer. Everyone loved it. It would make a great main meal.

That was exceptional in taste and looks. I preferred to eat it while the eggplant was still warm. I didn't found it very filling though.

I made this for the first course. International guests and they all raved about it. Serve eggplant at room temp with warmed sauce. I garnished plate with balsamic glaze for additional component.

Standard side for our summer BBQs. Have subbed various tomato sauces depending on what's in the garden/fridge. All good.

Literally unedible. Also, the "spicy" tomato sauce is quite bland.

I was so excited to try this because I love eggplant, but this is the first time I have been disappointed with a recipe from epicurious. I used a grill pan and I thought it made the eggplant have a funny taste. It also created a lot of smoke. Thought the filling was bland even though I added spinach and garlic to it. It looked so pretty, and took a long time to prepare. Will keep searching for a good eggplant roll.

I used canned tomato sauce instead of making it from scratch, which saved a lot of time. I don't have a grill, so I broiled the egglplant slices in the oven for 10-15 minutes. Very simple recipe, although it makes a better appetizer or side than a main course.

Rating: 4
This recipe was delicious and easy. I got enthusiastic good responses from my family. I used a George Foreman grill (because I don't have anything else) and it took FOREVER to grill all the eggplant, but it was worth it because the rolls were incredible. I will definitely make this again, although I may wait until I have a larger grill!

My husband and I aren't lovers of eggplant, but I decided to try this recipe because of the positive comments. It was delicious! I will definitely make again. I did decide not to roll the slices up. I layered it. It worked out great that way. I also warmed it up in the oven after adding the cheese mixture, although the sauce was hot enough that that would not have been necessary. Would be perfect for guests, great for diabetics (of which, I'm one); and for those who are vegetarians or for those who are like me and just want to eat more vegetables and less meat.

This is fantastic! I grilled the eggplant on the Foreman with some non-stick spray, then layered with the cheese and my favorite prepared tomato basil sauce for a fast meal.

This was great! The hubby didn't like it, but he doesn't like anything that might be good for you. It will be made again.

This was wonderful. I walked outside to my garden, plucked an eggplant, several plum tomatoes and basil, and dinner was ready in 30 minutes. What a great dinner in a pinch. I didn't have ricotta on hand, so I used reduced-fat cottage cheese, and layered the eggplant instead of rolling. Somehow I don't think this would be as delicious in January.

Broiled the eggplant slices, used sauce from a jar, and baked briefly in the oven to warm the cheese. Had some cheese left over so did some zuke and cheese sandwiches too. Easy delicious dinner.

This is a great quick dinner/first course. I have made several times and each time turns out great. Am going to try this using both zucchini and eggplant and assembling like lasagne instead of the rolls, which do tend to unroll.

This is a quick and easy dish. It makes a great main course with a salad on the side. I loved it!

Oh, it's so good! I made it becasue I'm 9.5 months pregnant, and eggplant is supposed to be a natural inducer of labor. I wans't expecting to actually like it! Both husband (very anti-eggplant) and I loved it, and agreed we'd make it again, pregnant or not. I added some left-over chicken breasts to the sause, and got a little crazy with the garlic and pepper flakes, again to encourage the bambino to rock on out. I'm so happy we have left-overs for tonight. I broiled the slices, and put it together more like a lasagna, and baked it at 400 for 20 minutes. Excellent, low-carb yumma yumma.

Tasty. Better when heated after assembled. I'd make it again, but I'd cut the eggplant a little thicker.

Easy and very tasty. Addes a slice of prosciutto on the eggplant. Yum.

This is a fast, easy, elegant vegetarian meal with a side salad. Two to three large-ish rolls per person is perfect. I've made it twice and once I used half ricotta/ half cottage cheese. Stick to the ricotta! - it doesn't melt all over the place when you warm up the rolls in the oven.

Tastes fabulous...a little finicky to roll since my slices were a little thin.

I saved calories by using part-skim ricotta and preparing the eggplant in my George Forman grill without the oil. It was still a great dish.

This is a keeper! Wouldn't change a thing in the recipe. Great sauce and the whole combination of flavours went really well together. My husband doesn't like eggplant but he really enjoyed this! A 4-forker for sure!

I agree with another reviewer. We loved this dish as a starter only I used double the amount of pepper flakes. It did not make the tomatoe reduction too warm, it was perfect. I also used double the amount of basil and more than double the amount of parm cheese because the fresh ricotta is so mild, it worked and is a wonderful starter! I think it's a bit rich to be a main dish. Finally, it is important to heat the whole dish once put together in the oven to melt the ricotta.

My husband and I loved this recipe, and I plan to make it as long as my tomatoes keep coming in. I was really surprised that I liked this as much as I did. I made with low-fat ricotta, making this a relatively low-calorie dinner, which nevertheless left us feeling satisfied. Also, it's very easy and makes a pretty presentation (just like the picture).

This recipe was a good idea but could use some tweaking. The sauce was not spicy, and pretty average. You'd be better off just using your favorite sauce or sauce recipe and adding the pepper flakes if you want it spicy. But more pepper than the amount indicated - it was NOT spicy. The eggplant would probably benefit from being peeled as the skin was a little tough to cut through with a fork. I broiled the eggplant slices rather than grilled and it was fine. But I will try grilling sometime. I assembled the rolls in a baking dish and topped it with the sauce and some venison meatballs. Pretty good carb-free meal for my diabetic husband, but next time will be better!

I loved this recipe but thought that the cold cheese mixture sounded odd (like other reviewers). So, I followed the recipe as listed excpet I layered the grilled eggplant with the cheese mixture and sauce in a dish and heated it through. It was delicious!

Perfect for a weeknight dinner. We definately heated in the oven. 400 for about 15-20 minutes. Served with spicy Italian sausage.

I liked this a lot. I grilled the eggplant slices after brushing them with a mixture of olive oil and minced garlic. I, too, warmed them in the oven after topping with my own sauce. It was a little soupy, so I would do 300 for 5-10 min. next time. My husband thought it was bland, rather than delectably subtle. Would anyone make them ahead and reheat the next day??

We enjoyed this dish very much. I grilled the eggplant slices then substituted cottage cheese for the high fat ricotta and used a favorite prepared tomato sauce to which I added garlic and fresh basil. I also baked it for about 10 min. to have it warm throughout. A delicious and simple vegetarian meal.

Nice, light recipe using ingredients fresh from my garden. Very quick, although I did warm the rolls in the oven a bit before serving. The thought of cold ricotta sounded a bit odd. Looking forward to leftovers tonight!

Easier than it looks.You can use good-quality canned tomatoes if no fresh are available.You can broil the eggplant.Don't worry if the cooked eggplant gets torn and the filling comes through.Once the sauce is over it,it's not noticeable.The ricotta can even be part skim.Just be sure you use freshly grated imported Parmigiano Reggiano cheese,and fresh basil.Outstanding!
