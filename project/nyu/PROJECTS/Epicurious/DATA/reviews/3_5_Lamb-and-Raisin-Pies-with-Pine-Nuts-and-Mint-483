I made these last night as part of a mediterranean themed dinner party. Lamb, to me, has a "gamey" taste so I cut half the ground lamb with ground beef, so 3/4 lb. lamb and 3/4 lb. beef. It was fantastic. This recipe was easy to make and absolutely delicious. I also substituted the brown raisins with golden raisins, and added 1/4 c. extra pine nuts to the mix. Instead of plain diced tomatoes I bought two cans of fire roasted tomatoes. Not sure if that made a difference overall, but the end result was fantastic. Will definitely make these several more times in my life! My dinner guest also recommended adding celery, since celery, raisins, and pine nuts are commonly used together.

As a vegan, I made these with French Puy lentils as a substitute for the ground lamb. I pre-cooked and drained the lentils, and added them after browning the onions and garlic. Everyone loved it! Four at the dinner table, and there is none left!

Rather than stuff puff pastry, which would probably be delicious, I've used this to stuff sweet peppers. I then roast them in the oven, on a rack with some liquid in the bottom of the pan. This works pretty well!

This was a wonderful recipe, and easily adaptable for a vegetarian meal. Instead of lamb, I used one package of Yves Veggie Ground and added the suggested cinnamon. Also, I recommend tasting the filling before wrapping it in the pastry dough to check the seasonings. I knew then to add more allspice to my taste.

I stuck to the recipe other than adding in cinnamon as per a previous reviewers advice. I actually was a bit disappointed ... I love all the ingredients but somehow the end result seemed a bit bland. Having said that, everyone else seemed to enjoy them and there was nothing left over. Going to try to make miniature ones next :)

We loved this dish! Substituted currants for raisins. Easy to prepare filling in advance. Highly recommend it.

These are great! They were a huge hit at my last party. A few variations: I made them in 3" x 3" squares, and somehow used more pastry dough than the recipe called for--buy an extra packet in case. I found currants worked better than raisins, adding a quarter tsp. of cinnamon really is nice, and it makes a big difference to grind allspice fresh rather than use an old batch. For a more casual, easier meal, spread the meat stuffing on a large pita, heat for 10-15 minutes, slice like a pizza and serve for an appetizer -- still really great.

Made this recipe for an all-appetizer holiday party, so I made them much smaller. They were one of the first appetizers to go; everyone loved them. I plumped the raisins in boiling water then drained them before adding. These would also be good in the same form substituting pastry crust instead of puff pastry.

My husband and our dinner guest raved about this one. We are into mediterranean fare, particularly lamb, and this was one of the winners we've made at home. We served it with Roasted vegetables on the side.

This is a pretty decent recipe, although I don't think it is a "MUST TRY." I cooked it all up and seasoned it accordingly, but it still seemed like something was missing. So I added some cinnamon to the meat mixture and it REALLY made a difference--try it! Take a little biteful of meat mixture and sprinkle some cinnamon and taste the difference. But, it is a very good recipe, and I would make it again. :)

YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS!!! Reduced the size to smaller rectangles and made 35. I added a whole cup of Baking Raisins, they add nice moisture to everything I use them in. After each person took their first bite, their eyes got huge and all responded, "Oh, my God!" Everyone loved them. I served them with a platter of Brie, grapes and a bottle of Zinfindel. Thank you for another terrific recipe. The printed recipe went home with one of my guests!!

Have made these several times--they're wonderful. I usually substitute currants for raisins and often make smaller pies and serve them as appetizers.
