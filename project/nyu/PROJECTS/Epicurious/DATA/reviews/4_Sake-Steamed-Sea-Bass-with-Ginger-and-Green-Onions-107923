This is a great and easy recipe. I used chilean sea bass and it was fabulous. Did not have clam juice on- hand, but had all the other ingredients, including medium grain rice. I think the clam juice would make the sauce too salty, but did add a small amount of water to make-up for addional liquid. This is an absolute keeper!

I used Chilean sea bass and it was awesome. The flavors are perfect for this recipe. I'm thinking this would be great on Salmon too with soba noodles.

Black Cod is not only delicious, but a more environmentally sound substitution: it is one of the "best choices" on the Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch Guide. We are supposed to avoid buying Sea Bass.

This is an excellent recipe. The only change I have made is using Black Cod (Sable Fish) in place of the Sea Bass. It is a very moist large flaking fish that steams perfectly in the sake broth.

I have been making this for years. It is really an elegant dish. It is also very easy to make. I usually serve it with sauteed spinach. The sauce from the fish tastes great with it too!

There is no question that the flavours here are subtle. If you're looking for some heavy and rich sauce on your fish, go and try the Pan Seared Tuna with Ginger-Shiitake Cream Sauce on this site. But fattening rich sauces are not for every night. This makes for a delightful dish. I didn't have a rack that would go in a skillet and didn't really understand why it was needed anyway - I used a steamer in a traditional pot. Started with some diagonally-sliced carrots in the steamer and after five or six minutes added the fish. It's a good recipe, and of course, unlike the other reviewer below, ADD THE SAUCE TO THE FISH when you're done with it!!

This recipe made the house smell incredible! I agree with an earlier poster and had to fish out the garlic from the sauce but wouldn't mince since flavor would probably be lost. Also, I forgot to buy sake when at the store so had to substitute mirin. Probably made it a little sweeter than the original but still amazing. I will be making again with proper ingredients.

Excellent recipe for a quick and easy meal. Next time, I will add a hot pepper ilo ginger as my family likes to spice it up. May add more soy sauce upon serving and try a shrimp fried rice.

Made this as described- beautiful! Really brings out the flavors. I generally avoid "healthy" foods, but this was nice!

This is wonderful light dish. I love seabass as it is and I'm always looking for new ways to serve it. This one is a definite keeper.

I really screwed this dish up and it was still excellent. Couldn't find bass around here right now so I used Tilapia. I came home and when I started cooking I forgot to buy clam juice so I used beef broth and I used Mirin instead of sake. It was still incredible. My husband couldn't get enough of it. I will definitly make it again with my minor changes.

I will make this again and again. It is so easy and the flavor is perfect. I served it with napa slaw and rice.

Have made this numerous times-quick, easy and tasty. We continue to enjoy it.

Quick and easy. I used cod instead because I'm a poor student, and it didn't come out as well as I hoped. I prefer some of the other sake-marinated recipes I've found on Epicurious.

p.s. the guy below is "stupid." you are supposed to pour the sauce on the fish.

excellent. did not use the clam juice (boyfriend has shellfish allergy.) so, the sake actually seemed to infuse the fish. do generously sprinkle the fish w/ pepper. we served it w/ steamed kale and edamame. will do again.

We loved this dish. I don't understand some of the reviews here saying this dish is bland. Follow the directions, and its a wonderful light dish.

My partner & I sat down to this enthusiastically because it looked great on the plate, but when we took a bite we were both surprised to find it amazingly bland. The flavors simply did not infuse into the fish. After a couple more disappointing bites, I took it back to the kitchen, reduced the sauce and poured all of it over the fish. Call me stupid for not having done so in the first place, but what a difference!

We enjoyed this dish at a friend's home last night. It was delicious I will definitely make this recipe myself. She served this with half sticky white rice and half black rice (side by side in bowl), green salad, asparagus, and rolls. Delicious!

Recipe turned out good, but the flavor did not infuse itself into the fish...probably because I had sea bass steaks that were about 1" thick. Also the flavor did not stray far from a typical "teriyaki" sauce.

This is a great recipe; very easy to make and delicious. My husband loved it and he is not a fish lover. I modified the recipe a slight bit. I had 2 - 1/2 lb pieces of Chilean Sea Bass that were vert thick, thefore, I cooked the fish for about 15 minutes until it was flaky. I also rubbed the pieces with chili paste before putting them into the steamer to add a little kick and I eliminated the salt to reduce the amount of sodium in the recipe. The sauce was very thick and yummy due to the extended cooking time therefore, I did not have to add anything else to thicken it. I will definitely make this again but I will probably try it with another fish, such as Halibut, since sea bass is expensive ($18/lb at a gourmet grocery store) and I just read that it is being over fished.

Surprisingly full of flavor for such a low-fat dish.

i have made this recipe 3 times, each using halibut instead of sea bass. i think this recipe is a fantastic, light way to cook fresh fish. i like to serve the fish on a bed of steamed baby bok choy. the best part is, you can just throw the bok choy leaves over the fish part-way through cooking and it will have the same lovely flavor as the fish and you don't mess up another pan!

I bought the sea bass and cooked one large filet instead of four small ones. It took forever to cook the fish and the taste was less than desirable in the end. I would not cook this again.

I wasn't blown away by this recipe but it was good and easy to do. The things that I would change is mince the garlic instead of flattening it. I was fishing out large chunks. I also following the advise of a little brown sugar and corn starch.

3+ forks. I try not to rate a recipe that I've made changes to, but this was good. I used rock fish which had but one recipe on this site. the recipe said if you don't have rock fish use sea bass, so I did a sea bass search and came up with this. I added some lt. brown sugar and corn starch per a pervious review. I made this again last night using Murin and a tsp of corn starch. The result was an extra good low fat meal that I'll make again. I guess this dish will work with a variety of fish which is the point of this review.

I couldn't find bass so I used cod and it was still delicious. The sauce is so good that it would work with any mild fish. And the recipe was so quick and easy, I will definitely be making it again!

I didn't have clam juice, so used BtB's Lobster base..it worked great. If you don't have a rack to fit in a skillet, try using crumpled pieces of aluminum foil twisted and laid in the pan like the bars of a rack to hold the fish above the liquid. You could also use a bamboo steamer!

Excellent - it disappeared - even fussy fish eaters loved it and it's easy. Made the recipe according to directions and it was excellent - but the sauce was watery so next time I will try the brown sugar/cornstarch suggestion.

Didn't have pure sake, so I substituted mirin, which has sake in it. It is sweet, so I also added the juice of half a lemon. I poached the sea bass in the liquid (since my steam racks were to big to fit in my pan.) Also, once I removed the cooked fish, I reduced the sauce until it was thick. It was incredibly delicious, and everyone loved it. Served it with jasmine rice and sugar snap peas stir-fried in a little peanut oil and soy sauce. Definitely will make again.

Thanks to Franklin, TN - thought your sugar advice made a big difference - made the recipe from a 3 to a 4.

YOu need to boil longer in the beginning. (Boil 10-15 minutes to decrease alcohol taste).This recipee was good, but it was EXCELLENT after adding 2 tlbs.brown sugar,and 1/4 cup water mixed together with 1 tsp. starch to the sauce and cooking one minute more before serving. The sauce was really awesome after that. My kids loved it after I did that as well. This recipee is very impressive to serve for guests. I served with sugar snap peas.

I had to substitute halibut for sea bass as the nass was unavailaable. The halibut took longer to cook and therefore the liquid reduced more than I expected. If I were to use halibut again, I would double the liquids.

This is wonderful. I can't wait to make it again! I got sea bass from the "collar" of the fish, and it was incredibly tender. The sauce is really great- reduce it down to get it really syrupy. Thank goodness I found a great fish recipe that is healthy! I can't believe how good it was.

This recipe is wonderful. It is easy to make and is delicious! However, I did not add the clam juice and minced the garlic clove so that I could add it on top of the fish at the end. This is a very good recipe if you're looking to make a very crowd-pleasing, yet simple dish.

we made this dish exactly the way it was stated, however, i would recommend not adding salt to the sea bass as the soy sauce gives it the additional salt. i served it with coconut rice and accompanied by nice riesling. This is a keeper and we already plan to entertain and serve this dish.

I subst. halibut once and used sea bass the second time- loved it both times - I did add 1 tbl of sambe olek (chili paste) to give it a kick and I add 1 tbl cornstarch to thicken the sauce a bit. Very tasty.
