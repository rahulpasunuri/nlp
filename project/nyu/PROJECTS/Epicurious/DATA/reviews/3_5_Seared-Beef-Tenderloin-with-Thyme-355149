I have not prepared this dish so I'm not going to rate it; however, after reading the previous reviews-which I often do to help make the decision about whether to try a dish or not- I feel the need to point out that NOWHERE in this recipe as written does it say that the beef is cooked in the full amount of oil. It states that the beef is rubbed with the oil and spices prior to cooking; the rest is used to dress the meat and the greens prior to serving. My husband and I have prepared a tuscan steak recipe many times which is similarly dressed with olive oil and lemon juice after cooking and I would say that a little more olive oil would not be amiss! My suggestions- read the recipe more thoroughly AND don't knock it until you try it!

This recipe is similar to 'Sliced Steak with Arugula' which uses a similar amount of oil (1/3 C) but in this recipe you are supposed to use a ridged skillet which minimizes contact with the meat. I love this method of preparing steak with the thyme, it's delicious. I wonder who jbrownsv from Colorado is calling you people? Deciding proper quantities of ingredients isn't exactly creative cooking.

Do you people really follow these recipes exactly? If so... try being a little creative and interpret the recipe to your own needs.

"A Cook" is wrong about the amount of oil. 7 TBS is a scant half cup; there are 16 TBS in a cup. In any case, I think one could get by using only 5 TBS. I haven't prepared this dish, but would certainly try it.

7 tablespoons of oil is excessively much. That is almost 1 cup of oil. 7 oz of tenderloin is not enough to feed four people unless it is suppose to an appetizer.

Ok, the salt error was corrected but has anyone noticed that 7 tablespoons of oil will have this dish swimming in fat? It just shows that their recipe review process is somewhat lacking in quality control.

I'm reading it as 1/2 TBS salt & 12 black peppercorns. Not 12 TBS salt.

Perhaps they changed the recipe - it now says 1/2 tablespoon of salt (not 12).

The original recipe is 1/2 Tbs salt! Obvious transcription error.

Is there truly 12 Tablespoons of salt in this recipe? That seems like a lot.
