We loved the sauce, etc, but I think next time we will use a softer tofu. It came out tough, but maybe that's the way husband cooked it! I'm the prep person.

an easier way of doing this recipe. Prepare sauce: mix 2 - 3 tblsp. prepared black bean paste, tsp. sugar, tblsp. tapioca powder or corn starch in a bowl, add 1 1/2 cups water or chicken stock slowly to blend. set aside. In medium high pan, add tblsp. peanut oil and fry 1 pkg. fine chow mein noodles, which have been rinsed with hot water and drained, until crisp and golden on both sides. Place on serving dish or bowl. in same pan add tblsp. oil and soft tofu, cut into 1/4 to 1/2 inch slices. fry til brown and crispy on both sides. add 2 chopped scallions to pan with tofu. Add sauce to pan and let boil 1 - 2 min. until thickened. Add water if necessary. Pour on top of noodles and serve.

Made with ingredients as written, including the Chinese fermented black beans, and liked it very much. Simmered the sauce a bit longer than called for, to make it a little thicker. Next time I may either cut the tofu into small cubes, so as to have more surface area for the sauce, or marinate the tofu beforehand in ginger, garlic, and soy, to give it a little more flavor. Will definitely make it again.

I was looking for a recipe that would help me use up some leftover incredients in the fridge. I made a loose- interpretation of this combined with Epicurious' recipe for Crusted Tofu with Kale and Sweet Potato. I say loose, because I used steamed spinach instead of kale... and I brushed the sweet potato with a teriyaki sauce. This was a quick, easy vegan dinner that is sure to become a part of the weekly rotation. For the sauce: Start by frying shallots in pan. Then add 1/3 can of black beans. Add 2 tbspoons of maple syrup. 1 teaspoon of black bean sauce to thicken sauce. Add a dash of lime juice. Dash of sesame oil. Serves 2 -- quick easy sauce...

This is a new staple around our house! The sauce is savory and versatile. I like to add a couple of drops of sesame oil to the vegetable oil when cooking the tofu to add another dimension of flavor. Also, pressing the tofu works even better when you use tea-towels (lined with paper towels to avoid lint!) and add a good weight. Check out my tofu-pressing technique at http://texaslocavore.com/index.php/recipes/tofu-three-ways/tofu-101/, if you like!

I love this recipe for its ease and deliciousness. It may not be "authentic" but it sure tastes good. The maple/vineagar combo gives this sauce some nice depth. I agree with the previous reviewer who cut back on the cornstarch: you can use half and simmer the sauce longer to avoid to gelatinous texture that comes with cornstarch.

I don't know why all of these people didn't like this recipe. it's super easy and the black bean sauce is wonderful. i cut down on the amount of cornstarch in favor of simmering it down longer. fabulous. and you can pour it over anything.

Boring. I liked the sauce but the tofu was boring.

I stopped at this recipe out of curiousity while searching for something else, and I'm dismayed at the comments by St.Louis. Of course maple syrup and cider vinegar aren't used in China, but brown soy vinegar and 100-year-old eggs aren't typical of N. America either. Duh!..maybe the chef is trying to make it easier on you by using more common ingredients? The (substituted) ingredients and cooking method are true to Chinese cooking, right down to doing everything separately and combining it all at the finish.

"Chinese" black bean sauce with maple syrup and cider vinegar? Get real - no tofu lover can be this desperate.

A major bore. I followed the recipe exactly, using authentic fermented black beans, carefully drained tofu (clean dish cloths work better, and weight the covered slices with a heavy chopping block or something similar.) Too bad, I am always on the look out for good tofu recipes.

This dish was only okay-- I liked the way the tofu was cooked, but the preparation was too complicated. You have to cook the tofu, the sauce, the rice, and the vegetable separately, which ends up being a lot of work.

I couldn't find fermented black beans, so I used miso paste. It still worked quite well!

This was yummy! I fried the tofu in olive oil. The sauce us fabulous - could be used as dipping sauce for many oriental treats. I would make this again and again. I am experimenting with a lot of tofu recipes and this is a "keeper" as we say in Homer - the Halibut capital of the world.
