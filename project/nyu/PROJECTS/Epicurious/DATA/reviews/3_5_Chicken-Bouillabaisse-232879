Delicious. I read the reviews so I made some alterations. I used skinless/boneless thighs and browned them with salt/pepper/thyme/paprika before starting the onion. I also soaked the saffron in a small amount of fresh orange juice and added it all in at the appropriate time. I added 2 bay leaves, doubled the thyme, and 12 small clams. My husband loves Bouillabaisse, this was a great dish since I don't like seafood much. It was easy, amazing, and will be a guest dish for sure.

Excellent! Great comfort food, great for weekday meal. Have made it several times now.

There is barely any resemblance to a bouillabaisse, and so much liquid that I would have needed several loaves to mop up the sauce.

The broth is delicious, and the chicken is fall-off- the-bone perfect (and flavorful). I don't know who could call it bland. I used fresh thyme and powdered saffron because had them around, plus a little paprika along with the s&p on the chicken and it was delicious. Next time I'll try the rouille. Best part is, this was really really cheap to make. If I have any dinner parties this winter, it will be on the menu.

I saw this on the site and was skeptical-- thought it would be bland. Then my friends prepared it for a dinner party and I found it was delicious-- perfect for a cold winter's evening. I am cooking it tonight and will add some hot pepper flakes too, since I like a bit of spice.

This dish was kind of bland. Although easy to make for a weeknight meal, I thought it lacked flavor.

Best recipe I've used from Epicurious. Great flavor! I recommend doubling the amount of faux rouille.

This was easy and tasty...if I could I would give it a 2 1/2 star rating...it was Good.

I liked this recipe because it was easy to make and quite good. As another reviewer recommended, I added a Bay Leaf and doubled the Thyme. GREAT TIP: Add a tablespoon of Pernod as well. The soup turned out EXCELLENT! But the chicken was still a bit on the bland side. I substituted sour cream for mayonnaise in the roux, added a bit more paprika and lemon juice, and it was great.

I was listening to some back issues of Bon Appetite's podcasts and was literally drooling when they discussed this recipe. It is really quite excellent. highly recommended.

I love this recipe. The only thing I did different was to use boneless chicken thighs because that is what I had on hand. My entire family, even my 8 yr old loved it. I don't need the recipe anymore for this and it is one of my fall backs. Last night I served fresh sliced tomatoes and the fried potatos and oregano with it. The potatoes were yummy with the juice.

This recipe was very easy to prepare. We liked our supper this evening but we prefer a much more spicier meal. If we were to make this again, we would use garlic with the onions, while adding salt and pepper with onions and garlic to enhance their flavor. We would probably use a bay leaf and much more fresh tyme. I would probably add a red chile pepper for greater spice. I might even dredge the chicken thighs in salt, pepper, and flour then searing them before adding to the tomatoe/chicken stock. We really like the mayo sauce. The mayo gets better the longer it marries. If no changes were made this recipe is a perfect supper for children and less adventuresome diners. My girlfried would probably say, "This supper hit the spot!" Happy Dining! Devin

Only had chicken thighs in the freezer but other than that followed the recipe exactly. Thought it was very good and will make again. Reminded me of a sauce piquant. Added a bit of Tabasco at the end but that is just a personal preference. Served with fresh green beans and steamed rice. Easy and tasty.

Absolutely delicious and very easy. The sauce is really good. Instead of drumsticks and thighs, I used chicken breasts on the bone, removed the skin and cleavered them in half (leaving bones intact). I drank the last of the wine on hand, so used extra dry vermouth instead. I cooked it about 30mins longer, so the meat was very tender and just falling off the bones, so it was also easy to remove the bones. I served this with a rice pilaf and steamed green beans, but still made the rouille which was also a delicious accompaniment. This dish is really good comfort food. I'll definitely be making this again!

Blah!! always trying new receipes but very disappointed. It was probably the orange strips combination with the saffron that didn't do it.As I was making I new the chicken was going to lack flavor and it did. will not make it again.

the entire family absolutely loved this...a delicious, healthy, heartwarming fall dinner easy enough for a weeknight.

Very tasty & very easy on a weeknight, even if it takes awhile to cook (very little "hands on" time). Chose it because it used up other things already on hand. Excellent broth to soak up with nice crusty bread. We made the rouille -- absolutely worth the effort, it really adds to the dish. Also, I had the chicken in the oven only for about 30 min then removed it to the stovetop for the last 15 min to simmer there. Turned out lovely and tender; I'll definitely make this again.

Excellent recipe. The only one thing I did differently was adding some capers at the very end. I will definately make this again.

Easy to make and tasty dish. Next time I will put a small amount (maybe a tbls.) of the rouille on the side of the dish instead of in it. It works with the dish but can easily overpower it.

Just made this, and it was excellent! Wonderful flavor that improves on the second day - if there are any leftovers. KHill4 should know that the very best bouillabaisse recipes almost always have orange peel as an ingredient, and I wouldn't make bouillabaisse without it.

Super, fabulous...it didn't sound that good on paper, but what a treat: hubby and I both loved it! It didn't sound like KHill from PA tried this one, so it's a shame s/he voted twice with the one fork rating, bringing the average down...this one's a keeper!

Awesome and simple to make. VERY flavorful. Used a Chardonay for the wine-nice touch. The rouille was a very nice balance. Great recipe!

Unique flavor, quick and easy, healthy and delicious! Love the faux rouille. I was a caterer for many years and I wish that I had this recipe then! KHill4, do yourself a favor and try this. Orange peel is a great way to take the edge off of the acidity of tomatoes and really enhanced the saffron. Thanks to all the reviewers who gave such positive responses--I'm really happy to add this to my recipe file.

This one rated a best dish from my boyfriend. I made this twice, and the buillabaisse made all the difference. I made half the portion for the two of us, didn't buy boneless chicken, added some steamed broccoli and served over rice.

So as I read the other reviews I wonder ...So, KHill4 from NJ/NY/PA - did you actually make the recipe?

Rating: 4
This was FANTASTIC! Served it to my IL's and the FIL who doesn't really like chicken much actually had seconds. I was sooooo disappointed that there were no leftovers. The rouille was just right. Another time I make it I will add some small veggies - but really it was virtually perfect as written. MAKE THIS!

This was very good considering how easy it was. I would definitely make it again for a weeknight meal. The rouille made all the difference in flavor.

REALLY easy. I also made this in my dutch over. I used skinless boneless chicken thighs and vermouth for the white wine. Leftovers were even better a few nights later. The orange peel was delicious in this. I would double the rouille next time.

Very tasty! I cooked this in my Dutch oven, adding baby bella mushrooms for the last 20 minutes. Great flavor. Next time I'll add carrots.

12 reviews now gets a recipe from 2 issues ago into Buzz Box?????? Wow, epicurious must really be hurting for active participants -- or else, pushing certain recipes. It didn't catch my attention in the issue, and it stuns me to see it here. Doesn't add up for me. I'm also bothered by the unformattable format ("ingredients" includes cooking directions), and since when does orange peel belong in 'bouillabaisse?' Now that I think about it, this must be some BA minion's idea of a Halloween hoax. sigh.

This dish was easy to prepare and wonderful to eat. The combination of saffron thread, oranges and dry white wine was pleasing. I would definately make this dish aagin. There was not as much "sauce" as I would have thought but made a great presentation.

Really delicious with surprising blend of flavors. My husband and kids loved this, and I served it inside a hollowed-out, cooked pumpkin for Halloween dinner. We will be making it again before next Halloween!!! I actually used chicken breasts, and then vermouth for the wine, otherwise followed the recipe exactly--such a great dish, and great for entertaining!!!

I was skeptical but this turned out to be very, very good. My only deviation was to use 1 tbsp of chopped fresh thyme. I might add garlic next time in addition to using the rouille, but the recipe is pretty darned good as is.
