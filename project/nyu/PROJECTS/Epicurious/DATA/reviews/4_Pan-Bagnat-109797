Used red wine vinegar instead of lemon juice, added a few hard boiled eggs and YUM. A perfect make-and-carry for the cooler, on our way to a summer concert in the park.

Absolutely fabulous. As a huge fan of anything olive oil, kalamata olive and tuna, this was like hitting the trifecta. Be sure to use crusty French bread (read "hard crust") in order to avoid sogginess - don't worry, it'll soften up enough for easy eating. I regular water-packed white albacore tuna and mixedin a bit of extra olive oil. Served with fruit on the side and it was a hit with everyone.

This is one of my go-to recipes when it's too hot outside to even think about cooking. It's 96 in Chicago today & I have the tuna salad portion of this chilling in the fridge for dinner tonight. I add some capers to the mix & a little fresh ground pepper. I like to make the salad ahead of time so the flavors can meld, but I wait until an hour or so before dinner to assemble the sandwich so the bread doesn't get soggy.

I agree with the other reviewers that it will get soggy if left too long. I made it about 4 hours before serving and it was already getting soggy. Easily double the basil and I added red vinegar and sliced hard boiled eggs. Delicious!

I made this for a picnic with friends. It was delicious. I made it the day before, so I drained some of the oil from the cans to avoid the bread from becoming too soggy. I also lined the bread with the basil leaves (top and bottom parts) for the same reason. I think I could have easily doubled the amount of basil. This was much tastier than the grilled chicken version of pan bagnat (also from this site).

Living on the French Riviera, I know about Pan Bagnats ;o), the recipe originates from Nice. If you can get your hands on a round flatish french bread bun, it's even closer to the real thing. Ingredients that are usually added are: anchovies, sliced hard boiled eggs, lettuce, vinegar instead of lemon juice, sliced red peppers. Actually the ban bagnat is filled with ingredients from the Salade Niçoise. I think I'll make some tomorrow ! ;o)

This is a fabulous recipe. So simple and such complex flavor. I make this often when I'm having company for lunch.

yum. LOVE pan bagnat. you can actually get similar sandwiches in various locales across the mediterranean (contrary to what calvin trillin said about it being only in nice...) my favorite kind i had in cafes in tunisia: along with the ingredients listed in this recipe, there was a selection of a variety of pickled and grilled vegetables to add to the sandwich, such as cornichons, capers, etc; grilled eggplant, zucchini, peppers, and other goodies. and also sliced boiled eggs, and harissa (tunisian chili paste). the grilled veggies in particular took the sandwich from simply great to absolutely mindblowing and memorable (i can still remember the taste of the sandwich now, 5+ years later). mmm...!

this was a fast, healthy dinner for a warm night and got rave reviews at the table. i added some arugula and a few extra olives--both great. can't wait to make this one again!

As sandwiches go, this is 4 forks. I sustituted grape tomatoes as their flavor is nice even in February. Also (in keeping with other pan bagnat recipes I've seen) added a few capers and substituted red wine vinegar for a small portion of the lemon juice. Finally, I omitted the additional olive oil (using only that in the undrained tuna) and found not only was the flavor fine without it, I also avoided the sogginess issues some of the other posters described.

I didn't have tuna in olive oil so I just drained the water and let the tuna soak in olive oil while I prepped everything else. I stuck the bread in the oven for about 5mins so that it would have a slightly cripier texture. What can I say? It was awesome! It was the perfect picnic dinner for a warm summer night! I served this w/ ensalada caprese (tomatoes, mozarella, basil) and a nice bottle of pinot grigio. It was terrific! One of my fav picnic recipes for sure!!! :)

this was really good but mine was a little soggy. maybe day old french bread would be better than fresh. you must have the fresh basil, it is wonderful.

So good! And a great way to use semi-dry baguettes, they re-hydrate when filled and pressed.

This is an excellent sandwich. I would definitely make it again. It's simple to make and very elegant. Make sure you find really good french bread. Makes all the difference.

This was a hit at our house on a warm summer evening -- tasty yet easy. High quality olives are well worth it as is the higher end tuna. Liked the artichoke heart idea below and will try that next time.

Picked up the ingredients to make this on the way home from work. Very tasty and easy. I added the artichoke hearts, because it sounded like a good idea. Had friends over so it actually "marinated" for over an hour. The bottom got a bit soggy, which didn't affect taste, but made it hard to pick up. looking forward to making it again.

I recently prepared this recipe and my family loved it. I usually prepare a new recipe the first time exactly as printed, however, I did have another recipe for Pan Bagnat that included artichoke hearts, which I combined. The taste was exellent, easy to prepare and worthy of making many more times.

This is SO good - first read about these in Calvin Trillin's book FEEDING A YEN which he claimed you could not find outside of Nice and was delighted to see a recipe for it. This is how we make tuna sandwiches from now on, it is so much better than the usual tuna-w/-celery and mayo. Brighter flavors, better for you too. Bon appetit!
