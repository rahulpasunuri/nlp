i only made the hearts of palm salad but it was amazing. So simple to make and it was delicious. Will definitely make this again and often.

how is this a recipe? a box of plantains? a bottle of sauce? these aren't hard things to make with real ingredients, so what's up, Gourmet?

This is not a review but an FYI on plantains. My husband is Cuban and we eat plantains a lot. I cannot imagine that frozen plantains are very good because of the starchy nature of the plantain. Ripe plantains are a little sweet like bananas. They will be sold in any Latin market. You want to choose yellow plantains with lots of black spots (just as you would bananas for banana bread.) Peel the plantain and cut 1/2" slices on the diagonal. Fry them in 350 degree canola (or similar oil) until sugars start to caramelize. The edges will get crispy and deep brown (5 to 10 minutes)

This recipe was only okay. The Salad was the best part by far. The plantains were okay but it would have been the same difference to use potatoes instead (I used fresh plantains and fan fried them in butter). The pork didn't have any time to soak up the Jerk seasoning so I ended up adding BBQ sauce on top at the table. Overall, not a memorable dish.

This is wonderful. The brand Walkerswood Traditional Jamaican Jerk Seasoning is a must. They have a website and I ordered thru them. It was cheaper than buying at a local store here. I used the thin pork chops and they were great. I would not use thick porkchops as they would not be as tender. The salad it what really makes the dish. The two flavors are great together. Only use the amount of seasoning as stated or the dish will be toooooo hot to eat.

Very quick and easy, and so tasty too. The jerk paste of course makes the pork, but the salad makes the dish. I'd happily have the salad with something else, or even on it's own.

I made this with grilled thick pork chops - much better than the thin dry ones I think. The hearts of palm salad is great, but the frozen plantains were a nonstarter. I will make again with fresh plantains though.

Excellent. The palm salad is particularly good -- very much like ceviche.

This brand of jerk sauce is so tasty and easy to prepare. It was definitely the best part of this trio of dishes.

Aside from overcooking the pork (my fault), this dish was fantastic. We're lucky enough to live in a place where frozen cooked plantains are easy to find (three different varieties even) so this dish was super easy for a weeknight. I'd never prepared hearts of palm at home before, but the salad was absolutely amazing! I kept looking for more!
