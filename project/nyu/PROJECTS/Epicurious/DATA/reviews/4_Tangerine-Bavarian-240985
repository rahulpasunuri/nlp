Licked the plate clean. This is my new fave dessert. It is light but can be made decadent. I made a salted dark chocolate sauce. Planning on experimenting with other fruits and sauces. If you skip the candied peel, it is much faster prep. Just awesome!

I have made this several times and it's excellent. I made it with tangerines, but also with blood oranges and regular oranges. My favorite was with blood oranges. Candied peel is not to be skipped, it's really wonderful and it adds a whole another dimension to the dessert. I always make a sauce too, but even without it it would still be a great dessert.

This recipe was unbelievably good. It was about 4 hours of hands-on work (not including chill time) to make the bavarian, the peel garnish and the sauce, but it was totally worth it. I used a 9" pan and didn't adjust the recipe and it was fine.

made this for thanksgiving and am planning to make it again for xmas - this time in ramekins. Candied peel takes the longest and for flavour you could do without it but it adds the wow factor.

I found this to be an exceptional recipe. If someone wanted a result that looked more like the picture I would suggest a little more gelatin. My end result could have been firmer for presentation purposes but everyone agreed it was one of the best desserts they had ever tasted.

Made this twice during the winter, with great result. Looking at it now (late summer) to adjust with oranges for the tangerines, and garnishing with Amish peaches and raspberries.

While time consuming, this dessert along with the caramel syrup and the candied peel are worth the effort. The caramel explodes with many nuances of flavor and the peel adds the the taste as well as the visual.

Very good, light desert. I made this for Christmas dinner and had rave reviews. It is so different from what is usually on the menu for holiday deserts...it was a welcome change. The candied peel and syrup are WELL worth the effort. Especially the peel!!! It makes the cake.

This recipe would get four forks for presentation -- it's impressive when you set the plated desserts before your dinner guests. Mine oohed and aahed. There were many compliments also as they ate it. The bavarian by itself is easy and quick. However, preparing the suggested accompaniments, which are what "make" the presentation, is time consuming. I will make it again, but with the candied tangerine peel and (to a lesser extent) the tangerine caramel sauce, it's too sweet for my taste. So I will cut the sugar in the bavarian itself in half. By the way, if your springform pan is 9" instead of 8" as called for, make 1 1/2 times the recipe. The height of the bavarian will be perfect and it will easily serve 12.

Delicious, light and festive. Worth the effort to make the candied tangerine peel, which adds crunch, and the tangerine caramel sauce, which adds a deeper flavour. It's going to be the dessert I make for Christmas this year.
