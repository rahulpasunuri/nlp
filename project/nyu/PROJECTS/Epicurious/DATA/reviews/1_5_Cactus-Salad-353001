My Granddaughter saw cactus leaves in the market and wanted to know what they tasted like. We all enjoyed the recipe after we got over the 'slimy' texture, the cactus looked and had the favor of canned roasted bell peppers. The salad was colorful. I thnk it would be nice served with a spicy Mexican dish. Very easy to prepare.
