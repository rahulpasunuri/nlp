This was pretty good. Not sure I put in enough squash et al. since I don't have a scale. The seeds were chewy and totally not worth the trouble.

I also used chicken stock instead of water.

Really easy and very tasty. I omitted the seeds, I roasted them and decided I wanted a snack while I was cooking. I didn't miss them when I ate the soup. an immersion blender makes this even easier.

Spicy and delicious! I left out the coriander (because I didn't have any on hand) and doubled the rest of the spices. I also used vegetable broth instead of water, and did not add extra and kept it thick. I liked the spice but my dining companion thought it was too spicy. We accompanied the chowder with a piece of homemade whole wheat, hearty-seed bread, and it was great! Would definitely make again

This is a tasty soup with some adjustments depending on your flavor preferences. Needs stock instead of water, I personally doubled the spices and topped with greek yogurt and cilantro. I also addded more salt, but the stock or broth would help that. Overall unique and delicious!

Loved it! And got rave reviews from my Indian husband. It was good and spicy, I used 5 cups of broth and 1/2 a cup of water for the liquid. I also used a hand-blender, so it still had some texture.

Initially, I wasn't very impressed with this soup. It seemed fairly boring, despite all the spices used (and I didn't cut back, even on the cayenne). It lacked depth of flavor and nuance. So I added the juice of one lime, as I recalled that my mulligatawny soup, uses lime to kick it up a notch. That did the trick. Made it far more interesting. Despite that, I think I'll stick with the Butternut-Corn Chowder recipe here that has chipotles and that I've been making since it was printed. However, it is not vegetarian (chicken stock and pancetta). Look it up. A much better use for butternut squash and corn.

I discovered squash later in life and it never ceases to amaze me how wonderful it is. Weight watchers: this sweet and spicy soup is core! Once the squash is pureed this soup has a lovely velvety smooth quality (almost like baby food but this is no baby food). This soup is super spicy (and I loved it). I added more spices and ground sea salt to heighten the flavor. The pumpkin seed step seemed too fussy to me so I skipped it. I added more corn in the end to increase the crunchy finish. This is a lovely soup.

Very good. I used 2 packs frozen winter squash to save time (instead of roasting butternut), and 2 teaspoons garam masala to replace the spices. I used my immersion blender to puree (if you don't have one of these, I highly recommend you get one). Overall, a good vegetarian winter soup.

Next time I make this I will use much less cayenne pepper. It was so spicy I had to use one part store bought butternut squash soup to tone down the cayenne, and yogurt. My boyfriend who loves hot food even found it too hot to handle. Beneath the cayenne I could tell there is a tasty soup in there.

I thought this was a little too spicy. Too much cayenne.

I've been making this every year since it was published in '97. It has become an autumn mainstay for me. It's also a much-requested item at pot lucks and dinner parties. Even from people that don't usually like squash-based soups. I love that it's sweet and a little spicy, and especially that it's a creamy soup w/o the cream. And it's really easy to make. It's just perfect for the colder months, A+

I like this recipe very much, and have made it several times at Thanksgiving. A couple of changes which I think improve both the taste and texture: Used chicken stock instead of water,only added about 5 cups of stock with the squash, and then added cream at the end to adjust the consistency. Reduced the amount of cayenne and cloves slightly as well. It's a terrific autumn soup.

Yummy!!!! I followed the recipe exactly and am very pleased with the chowder. It is comforting, but light, too! Served with toasted flour tortillas with black bean confetti salsa for a tasty vegetarian supper!

Sounded like it'd be really tasty, but mostly what I tasted was the cayenne. 1/2 tsp is a lot. I don't know, maybe my other spices were on the old side. I also don't think the squash/corn combo makes much sense. I like squash/apple better, e.g., and corn/potato.

What a treat! The only mistake I made was halving the recipe, and no leftovers to look forward to. I substituted chicken stock for water, and because of my limited spice rack had to use a spice blend from Penzeys Spices called "Garam Masala" which has coriander, cardmom and cloves and added some extra flavors. My 7 year old loved it and even my bland husband asked for seconds. I'd echo previous suggestions and serve it with a good crusty bread and salad. We didn't care for the roasted squash seeds in it, and liked that the potatoes weren't overcooked and had a little bite left in them.

This was a great recipie. I also used ginger instead of cardomom as well as chicken stock. It was hearty and very flavorful. I had a group of friends that dropped by and ate my whole pot of this, raving all along. Very tasty.

I roasted 2 heads of garlic along with the squash, added to a combination of broth (1 quart) and water (1 pint). The seasoning was spicy, the texture pureed was creamy. It was very satisfying, kept well and was easy to reheat and eat!

This is a hearty, very flavorful soup. It's quite easy to make. I made a couple of small substitutions - I didn't have cardomon so I used ginger, and I used stock instead of water. I also used about 6 1/2 cups instead of 7. I had some leftover mashed potatoes, so I used about a half cup of those. The spice flavors really complement the taste of the squash, and it's rich and thick without being a cream soup. It's terrific with a salad and some nice whole grain bread. I will definitely make this again.

I really thought this would be full of intersting flavor with all the great spices, but I found it very bland and watery. Too sweet, not enough of a sweet/spicy balance. Tried to make it richer by adding cream and moe pureed roasted squash, but still no good. Very disappointing....
