We love this recipe! I have made it 3x now and it's been great each time. The last 2x I didn't have buttermilk so I added some freshly zested lemon peel to plain milk which was lovely alone or with fruit on top. I used my garden raspberries and blueberries, unsweetened and thawed from the freezer. I am allergic to egg yolks so this completely satisfies my pudding cravings.

Easy and very tasty. I wasn't sure I would like the cinnamon-caramel sauce, but it was a real hit. I will make this again this holiday season.

though i love the silky texture of the pannacotta, the flavor didn't really send me. it was good, but didn't make me crazy in love. the caramel sauce on the other hand...OMG is wonderful & so easy. i will make the sauce again & again. i need to rush out & buy some vanilla ice cream to go with it, NOW!

This recipe was pretty easy to follow and all the ingredients were easily procured. The buttermilk did complement the caramel perfectly and was a desert enjoyed greatly by all my friends who tried it.

Maybe I did something wrong, but the pannacotta didn't set and the cinnamon-caramel sauce had good flavour but didn't come together well. Too bad because I recently ate something similar to this that was sublime at a restaurant called Domus in Ottawa. So I was eager to try this.
