Really enjoyed the flavor of this salad. Made with only 1 pound of potatoes. Made all dressing although didn't use it all to dress the potatoes. I took previous reviewers' recommendations and reduced oil to 1/3 C and cider vinegar to 1/4C -- perfect. Will definitely make again.

Absolutely delicious with a tri-tip roast. After tasting the salad, I added more lemon and more Maytag blue cheese. I think I'll also add some diced celery next time.

We were just in Iowa and stopped in Newton at the Maytag dairy, and have been looking to use Maytag blue cheese in everything. This cheese is particualarly good in potato salads! I omitted the shallots and chives (forget to get them), and the hard-boiled egg. It's great without them. I'll definitely make this recipe again, and plan to try it with the shallots and/or chives, but think it doesn't need the egg at all.

Tasty. Straightforward and easy. People loved it. I used Stilton and found it a bit too much for this recipe. Next time I would try Gorgonzola or Maytag.

Loved this potato salad! I too made the dressing in the blender, combining everything except the green onions, and adding some blue cheese to the dressing. I then added dressing to potatos, seasoned, crumbled the blue cheese and bacon over potatos, and sprinkled with green onions. I omitted the eggs because I was serving deviled eggs, and didn't bother serving over lettuce. This is a definite keeper to my recipe folder.

I've made this more times than I can count--I'm famous for it. I add more honey, because I find the vinaigrette too tart. However, the most important thing that I changed is the way I made the dressing. Put the vineger and the mustard in the blender, and pour the oil into the blender in a thin stream as if you were making mayonnaise. This will emulsify the vinaigrette and it won't seem grease. Then mix in the rest of the ingredients and correct the seasonings.

Every single time I make this, it gets eaten to the bottom. Such a nice break from mayo based potato salad's. Do not change a thing, and every ingredient is integral.

This was awesome! I made a bunch of mods, including using green onions instead of shallots, omitting the lemon and egg, and I doubled the recipe but only used 2/3 cup of olive oil. I also added grated purple onion. It was a big hit.

This was fabulous! I used hickory smoked bacon & Maytag blue cheese. Especially loved the lemon zing to the vinaigrette--a fresh addition! People, at the BBQ that I took it to, raved.

I would give this dish 2.5 forks, if possible. I think it has a lot of promise, but, next time, I would cut way back on the vinegar, and increase the blue cheese a bit. It was just too sharp for my tastes.

We've made this recipe since 2000 & it is excellent! I would not change a single thing. We use gorgonzola because it's milder, but regular blue cheese is good as well. The bowl is always emptied & compliments abound when I serve this.

Omitted the bacon and the egg topping and added shaved red onion -- fabulous! As the instructions state, be sure to use a very nice Blue.

I'm not sure how much oil I added because after reading the other reviews, I decided to add based on what looked good. Because I cut back so much on the oil, I found the vinegar to be a little over-powering but that is of course a matter of personal preference.

Excellent flavor, but far too much oil.

Rating: 3
Very rich and delicious, previous reviewers hit the oil issue right on. I doubled the recipe and used only 1 cup oil, and still found too oily. Next time I will use 1/3 cup single, 2/3 cup for doubled batch. Definitely make a day ahead to let that dressing saturate the spuds. I used pepper bacon, overall this recipe is a keeper with these changes.

This dish has become a staple in our household in the summer. It's the best potato salad I've ever had! Better than those gooey mayonnaise concotions you find at picnics. Plaese try it- you'll love it!

I have made this a few times a summer since the recipe was published, and everyone, including me, a self-proclaimed fusspot, loves it. The lemon makes it special (that and the yummy blue cheese, bacon, and chives). Tastes much more complex than it is to make.

I had high hopes for this dish after reading all the great reviews, but I too was sorely disappointed. Judging by the (lack of) reaction from the guests at my 4th of July party, apparently no one else was overwhelmed by it either. I used very fresh ingredients and excellent quality blue cheese, but the ingredients just didn't seem to meld all that well together. The dressing was great by itself and holds promise for another potato salad with other elements, but I will not be making this one again.

Don't believe the one vote of dissension! This is fantastic. Making it again today for the third picnic this year - everyone requests it now! Agree with cutting back on the oil to about 1/3 cup.

This is delicious. I loathe potato salad made with mayo, and this was the perfect solution to that. Followed to the letter, however doubled the egg and bleu cheese and omitted the bacon. I will try this with bacon when I'm not serving vegetarians...

I was looking for an alternative to the traditional potato salad, and this will surely replace the old. I would suggest cutting down on the oil/vinegar as it is a bit too much. Instead of bacon, I crisped up diced prosciutto and minced fresh rosemary in place of other herbs. Lends itself well to variation. Not much on this site that has disappointed!

Couldn't find blue cheese, so used feta, and used bacon bits instead of bacon, and it was very tasty! I think i will cut down on the oil and leave out the egg next time to make it a little healthier.

O.K. you all have to trust me on this....We are the party house of the neighborhood....We LOVE to cook and ALWAYS try new recipes on our "victims". Our victims were totally in love with this salad.....we were too!!! Make it the day before then make A LOT of the Blue Cheese, EGG and BACON. Stir half of it in, and garnish the top with the other half!!! BEST POTATO salad I've ever had!!

Excellent!! Much better than regular potato salad. Doubled the recipe except for oil - just used 2/3 cup oil for double other ingredients. Made the night before cookout so everything would blend. Everyone loved it. A keeper!

We thought it was better with only one teaspoon of grated lemon peel. If the potatoes are not really small, cut them up into more pieces.

As with all recipes, you need to use your own judgement and add your own flare! Much less oil, a little more shallots and FRESH parsley, and I use creamy dijon. Then at the end, another egg, and butter leaf lettuce looks much more presentable.

I read all the reviews and I agree that you can cut the oil and vinegar. I also cut the lemon zest by half since I'm not a huge fan. I thought it was a beautiful looking dish and a good barbecue dish. My only advice would be to make it a day ahead- the flavors will blend.

I made this for a barbeque and the results were underwhelming. I was disappointed after reading about the raves that everyone received after making this recipe - no one said a thing! Admittedly, I did not serve this to the most adventurous group of eaters but it didn't seem too far out to me! It was a great blend of flavors but it needed something with more oomph than a vinagrette - I think it would be better with a creamier consistency. Maybe a little mayo or less oil next time.

My mom made this for my Grandma's birthday party. She makes a wonderful mayo based salad. I guess the guests were expecting a salad comparable to that one. This is definately a different salad and is the most adventurous one we've tried. No one really raved. All said that there was too much vinegar and that the lemon was to heavy. I'll make it again because I thought it was much better the next day and I love the potato-cheese-bacon combo.

Very delicious. We made this for the first time for a picnic after our softball game. We did the "base" the night before and allowed it to "set" and absorb the flavors. Then just before serving, we added the blue cheese, bacon, hard-boiled egg, and chives. Everyone really loved it.

I've made this twice in the last four days, and my family have called for a repeat performance. This is terrific. Add the cheese while the potatoes are warm; when it melts, it tastes even better. I thought the lemon was great-- not too strong at all. Much tastier than a mayo based potato salad, in my opinion, and another plus is that it doesn't swim in dressing-- it's the perfect amount.

Maybe my expectations were too high because this salad missed the mark with me. I found it too lemony, my husband found it too bacony, our guests were too polite to say anything but they didn't clean their plates. On the other hand, my 10-month old ate all the leftovers!

Yummy! I made this dish exactly except that I couldnt find any red potatoes in all of Caracas, Venezuela. I used small regular potatoes instead. The dressing was great. It was however a little oily. My guests raved about it. I kept the bacon bits on the side as there were a few "vegies" present. I also added a little chopped red bellpepper to give it that extra color. Overall it was different.

I only gave this recipe 2 forks, not because it was bad (my husband LOVED it) but because I found a simpler and better tasting Bleu Cheese Potato Salad recipe. I thought that the flavors just didn't blend that well in this recipe. I would recommend using the potatoes while they are still warm and stirring in a dressing that is a combination of mayonnaise, cider vinegar, chopped chives and the bleu cheese - it all melts and melds together and I think has a better taste.

This is very much like German Potato Salad. If someone does not like it, they will not like this one as they will think there is too much vinegar. I loved it and have made it twice already. By mistake I added the 1/4 cup of chives to the potatoes and then topped it with the remaining tablespoon. I think this worked better. Also, 4 strips of bacon seems to be enough. People seemed to like it, it was very colorful, and looked just like the cover photo. I warmed up leftovers in the microwave and served them as a warm potato side dish. This was also very good.

Loved it! Made this for a BBQ and even the picky eaters went back for seconds. Great the next day too. Mine wasn't as beautiful as the cover, but very tasty. I think a should have added the garnish at the very end and mixed more gently. A great, lighter change to the heavy mayo version.

My husband, sister and I all loved this recipe! It was very easy to make. I mixed the warm potatoes with the dressing the night before, then actually mixed in the garnish ingredients before serving. Also instead of quartering small red potatoes, I diced up larger reds into bite-size pieces. This shortened the cooking time and also divided out the flavour onto more potato surface. When I make it again I will eliminate some of the olive oil and vinegar as I felt it had a little too much oil.

This salad looked so gorgeous on the cover of Bon Appetit, and sounded so delicious, that I made it for a family tea. Unfortunately, it just wasn't as good as the ingredients that went into it -- it seemed too "busy," with too many competing ingredients, and the different flavors in it somehow just didn't work well together. Too bad -- it still looked gorgeous, though!

I brought this salad to a cottage weekend gathering and it was a definite hit! The combinations of flavours is fabulous, and as already noted, the lemon is a totally tasty touch. Because I made the salad ahead, the potatoes weren't warm when I added the cheese, so next time I would likely add the bleu cheese at an earlier stage, even if making ahead, so that it would soften. This one's a keeper!

As soon as I saw the photograph of this salad on the cover of Bon Appetite I had to make it!! I prepared this dish twice-once for my husband, and another time for a friend's wedding rehearsal dinner. It was a hit on both occasions. The lemon zest in the dressing adds a nice zing to the salad and the bleu cheese definitely compliments the potatoes. I will make this again.
