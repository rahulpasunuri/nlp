Just a question: Should I really roast at 500? I usually roast at 425-450. Why so much hotter for this?

I thought this was good. Definitely not the most interesting thing I've ever eaten, but a good alternative recipe for zucchini.

This is a very good dish, surprisingly the zucchini isn't overpowered by the lemon, it was just right. I served this along with rack of lamb with pesto crumbs also from this site. The zucchini was a great compliment to the lamb.

This was a great new way to prepare zucchini. I will be making this again!

I didn't goof with lemon slices, used a little extra lemon juice, and just mixed the sugar into the oil/lemon juice mixture. After tossing the zucchini in the oil/lemon mixture, I coated the slices with Italian breadcrumbs. Then I roasted the slices as the recipe dictates. This was very good if you are in love with zucchini. I would not make it again, though, as I think that zucchini is better if used in cakes, breads, soups, and stews.

Very wonderful! Very nice way to prepare this veggie. I didn't bother with the rosated lemons - I was out of steam by then. I cut lemons into slices and garnished the plate with them.

Would rate this 2.5 forks. Think that it would be just as good sauteed in a red hot pan. Less clean up. Would also add minced garlic. Won't bother with the lemon slices next time. Too sour to eat. Better to garnish with lemon wedges to drizzle juice over.

Really liked this dish. I should have roasted it for longer. Some of the bigger pieces were mushey. My mistake.

I made this recipe as a side dish and everyone loved it. I did however change a few things.I decided to use chile seasoning instead of pepper and it turned out great. I am not a big zucchini fan,but I even liked it.

A little more work than just zapping the zucchini, but it looks and tastes great. I was really impressed how the zucchini took on that roasted color. I would add more lemon slices, and a lot more lemon juice -- but none the less, it was good stuff. Even the dogs liked the few slices leftover!

My Dad normally turns up his nose at zucchini but he had seconds and then thirds of this! Next time I'll allow for 1 zucchini per person. Also used more lemon slices since had the lemon and thought they'd be pretty: they were.

This IS a good idea! I roasted the zucchini in the oven, cut lengthwise, with red and green peppers and then topped a veggie pizza with them. V. good.

Adventurous Cook from New Port Richey: To Sutton-try adding sesame seeds to that sauteed zuchhini. Adds an interesting flavor. K

Question: have any of you tried slicing the zukes lengthwise. I am assuming this is fine, but I just wanted to make sure... esp. when doing it on the grill

Yum! I hadn't thought of combining zuke and lemon like this, and it was very easy and tasty. When I make it again, I'll use more lemon slices and cut them thicker - mine fell apart and 5 slices of lemon wasn't enough to garnish all that zuke.

Neat combination! I'm a very experienced cook-- and I LOVE recipes like these because it makes you aware of flavor combos you might not have thought of otherwise! This is a very good starting point-- transfers well to the grill, and goes WONDERFULLY with salmon.

Roasting is one of my favorite ways to cook just about anything. The zucchini turn out perfectly because the recipe has the timing right. A nice light side dish for summer (though heating the oven to 500 degrees won't keep your cooling costs down!). A truly good cook is always open to new ideas.

I agree with Portland...NYC needs to lighten up. I have been cooking for over 20 years, and I'm always open to new ideas. In fact, I recently started cooking my zucchini differently due to a "simple" recipe: Cut the zucchini into spears, add to an uncovered saute pan containing about a cup of water, 2 T olive oil and 2 T butter. "HEAT." The water boils off and the oils will provide a lovely glaze. Give it four or five minutes and let a nice browing occur. Best zucchini I've had in a long time. Try adding a fresh herb or spritz of lemon. Good food is not always complex....and lighten up.

A Cook from NYC on 04/30/03 really needs to get over themselves. While some of us are experienced cooks looking for more elaborate recipes, others are new cooks seeking to learn a simple preparation. As far as the recipe itself, it's a good basic starting place for zucchini and I've found that it also transfers well to the grill.

This "recipe" (roasted Zuc. w/lemon), is another one of those "non-recipes". This is just "take food and add heat." I think we can figure this one out on our own.
