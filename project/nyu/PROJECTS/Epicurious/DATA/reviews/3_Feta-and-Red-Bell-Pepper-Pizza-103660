LOVE THIS! I tweaked this some though. I sauteed the red bell peppers with the garlic and onion also. Used a pre-made thin crust, brushed the crust with olive oil then topped with the veggies, sprinkled the feta on top and topped with italian seasoning, baked for about 12mins-DELICIOUS!

Just a tip to those who have a hard time with pizza crust. I buy Gattuso Pizza Crust Mix and I mix up two packages for a large pizza. Works Great. L.

The purchased pizza dough was horrible. My crust also got burnt to a cinder even though I watched it very closely. I think the key is to cook on one side turn then put fillings on top while the bottom cooks. The toppings themselves were very good. I did add onions and grilled sausages to make it a bit heartier. Next time I will try the toppings on a boboli.

This was very unique. Used a gas grill and crust got a little overcooked. We will definately try this again. A few other veggies would go very well, too. Grilled onions, etc.
