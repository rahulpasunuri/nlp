This was really lovely for dinner. I actually brought a rotisserie chicken, shredded the meat and added it. I also mixed 2 tablespoons flour with the heavy cream, skipped the potato and added carrots. Instead of serving with a dome of puff pastry, I rolled out crescent roll dough baked it as a sheet and served along side. I have class everyday, so this was a really great/fast way to make dinner. Tomorrow night we'll have the leftovers with a crusty baguette!

Good base recipe, but really needed some 'oomph'! Using 6" ramekins, I cut a circle of puff pastry dough for each bottom, baked for 15 minutes, filled with turkey mixture, placed a larger puff pastry round on top, and baked another 15-mins. For the mixture, I added mushrooms, carrots, celery, leeks, potatoes and SHERRY was the key ingredient. A little corn starch was necessary to thicken the filling. Having individual 'meals' made serving this much easier and leftover ramekins in the frig will last several days.

This recipe is great with chicken or turkey. If pre-cooked turkey is utilized (eg. Thanksgiving leftovers) it should be placed into the recipe as the potatoes are added so as to not overcook it and also because the turkey would most likely be pre-chunked at this point. If the turkey or chicken is somewhat dry I have found that the reduction step may be omitted. Please ensure that if you do not reduce the mixture, you do not cover the pan. Enjoy this fabulous recipe!

Very easy. I have made many times with different variations. Best one so far, is: cook up a one or two strips of thick cut bacon, then saute veggies in bacon grease (double veggies). Added 2 Cloves of garlic. Always have added corn, which is a great touch. I use 1% milk and then do 1 T of butter/flour roux after potatoes have cooked up. Still tastes great and has less fat. Skip the bouquet garni and add your favorite dried or fresh herbs. Keep it simple! Very good.....

I made this several times, a big hit with teens and adults. I too added baby carrots criminin mushrooms and three clove garlic. Find that Pilsbury is better than pepperidge farm pastry. I also thikened the broth. Yummy a big hit.

Am making this tonight for the second time and cannot wait! I tweaked the recipe a bit, adding carrots, rosemary, and corn, and reducing it all like mad. But overall I think it's perfect as-is. Creamy, warm, and comforting. Perfect winter fare!

I made this dish two nights in a row (one was Christmas eve), both delicious (the first with the addition of carrots; the second with an addition of both carrots and mushrooms). If you're looking for gross, thickened broth, don't do this. You should absolutely add more vegetables-carrots, mushrooms, extra peas--and use less cream; I think the trick to having a less runny broth is to let it reduce. Everyone asked for seconds (and I saw some plate-licking) on both tries, and it's a lovely recipe which I will definitely use again, soon.

I found that serving this was a bit of a challenge, as the hot filling just oozed out all over the plate. But after refrigerating it and cutting a slice for lunch the next day, I found that, even after microwaving, the piece stayed together and the filling was nicely congealed.

I added 20 cloves of garlic and a cup of baby carrots. I used regular pastry dough made in my Cuisinart (their recipe) for the top and bottom. I used a can of potatoes to cut the work down. All the herbs were fresh from my garden including rosemary. It was way yummy.

I used my thanksgiving leftovers to a great advantage. Creamed onions, left-over pastry, sage, chicken broth and half & half. No potatoes or shallots, perfect! My husband and I loved it

I followed the recipe carefully and added parsnips to the ingredients, but despite the bouquet garni and the salt and pepper seasoning, I found it to be very, very bland. I would not make it this way again.

Delish b/c I doubled the veggies. Ok to skip the bouquet garni and add a bayleaf and a splash of apprpropriate dried herbs. Add an onion or two with the shallot and celery sautee. Add a few thinly sliced carrots with the potatotes. I used individual ramekins 5 1/2" wide and 1/6 of a puff pastry sheet. Even tho the puff does not cover entirely this is plenty even for a man. I let my guests salt and pepper their own b/c the canned/boxed broth already has a lot of salt. GREAT dinner party entree!

I added steamed carrots and butter/flour mixture to thicken sauce. Puff pastry dough was great to use. Overall it was delicious. Will make again.

Made with turkey - very good. I, too, added thyme and parsley which made the sauce very fragrant and flavorful. To lighten it up, I used half and half instead of cream - next time might try fat free half and half.

Delicious. Based on the the other reviews, I made a few changes: Sauteed onion, garlic, mushrooms and carrots with the celery and instead of putting the herbs in a cheesecloth i chopped up fresh thyme and parsley and added it with the broth. Added 1T butter/flour roux after the potatoes cooked and it was plenty thick, not watery at all. Added frozen corn with the peas too. This was very easy and a crowd pleaser. I think i will try in individual ramekins next time.

4th time I make it - for my family before, for friends and family tonight. Always great raves from all. Make it as is with all fresh ingredients - not overcooking chicken as called by recipe. My only change, add 1/2 onion, omit potatoes and add fresh cut carrots/ semi cooked before.

Per emcm from Philadelphia, I did make a roux and thought the consistency of the filling was fine. I would have prefered some sort of a bottom crust, or maybe making this in individual ramekins would have made it more traditional feeling than a 13 x 9 top-crust casserole. The chopping took a LONG time for a pretty good/kinda mediocre dish. I might make it again. I would definitely make it a two-crust dish though.

This was my first chicken pot pie and it was great. My husband and grown up sons just loved it. I followed the recipe and added finely sliced carrots and 1/2 onion. I will do this again, over and over.

Great recipe! I left out the potato, since I figured we didn't need extra starch. But the method for the chicken and resultant sauce is fantastic.

Rating: 3
We liked this recipe and are likely to do it again. I used turkey instead of chicken and I roasted the turkey rather than poaching it. I used the cream cheese pastry from another epicurious recipe since I wanted a denser crust instead of the puff pastry. Despite all of these changes I think the core recipe would probably make a fine pie too.

okay, the way i made it. i started by improving on the canned ckn stock i used by simply simmering one of the very large cans of swanson brand broth a half hour or so with a sliced carrot, a chopped celery stalk, some crushed garlic, a quartered onion, the bouqet garni, and my own poultry seasoning consisting of 1T each fresh marjoram, fresh sage, toasted coriander and toasted white peppercorns; straining and reducing to about 1/2c-1/4c; reserve. i then sauted out the mirepoix of shallot, carrot and celery with about 1T each extra-virgin olive oil and unsalted butter, added about 1T sliced garlic and the peas; reserve. i poached the breast in the VASTLY improved stock, added the vegetables and the cream. brought to a simmer and stirred in a bit of simple blonde roux, simmered to thicken and continued as above using all butter puff pastry. for me it is imperative to build layer upon layer of flavor. let me tell you, everybody raved about this dish. please forgive my shorthand.

Okay, Don't laugh, but I made several variations that made this recipe even easier. (I was in a huge hurry!)Instead of using the chicken breast, I just bought a rotisserie chicken, removed the skin and shredded it up. Use the juice from this chicken as your stock, plus a can of broth. This adds flavor due to the seasoning from the rotisserie chicken. I used about a cup of southern style frozen hashbrown potatoes instead of the fresh one. (The frozen ones are already cut and cooked.) And, instead of the frozen peas, I used frozen mixed vegetables. I did away with the bouqet garni, and used just a couple sprigs of fresh thyme. Brush the top of the puff with egg wash for sheen. Sorry to ramble. Hope it can help. P.S. My extremely picky brother raved about this dish!

I've made this recipe numerous times since I saw it in Bon Appetit and it's the best chicken pot pie I've ever had. Everyone I've served it to agrees. The fresh herbs really make the dish. I don't mind that the liquid isn't very thick (I serve it in shallow bowls). The only change I make is to add carrots with the potatoes.

After reading the reviews, I was prepared to add cornstarch to thicken the liqued, but in the end, didn't need to. I may have let the potato cook down more than called for which may have caused the thickening. I also used chopped broccoli instead of peas and added about a Tbsp of dijon to the sauce. A keeper for this family

This is really tasty and satisfying to make. Thanks, henryxchung, for the suggestion to make a roux: After removing the cooked potatoes from the cooking liquid, I poured the liquid into a dish, made up a roux of 1 T. butter and 1 T. flour, then mixed the liquid back in.

This is a fabulous recipe. It's my boyfriend's favourite and he always insists that I make it. I do agree that the sauce is a bit thin, but that's how the recipe is intended to be. It's not meant to be the traditional thicker sauce. The flavour of the bay leaves and celery leaves is lovely!!

I had to make too many changes to say I would make THIS recipe again. Making the Veloute sauce first then adding cream helped to thicken it, but not enough- so I added a beaten egg. It was bland so I added garlic and more thyme. As inspiration, though, the recipe works.

Yummy! I've adapted this recipe to a vegetarian version and have tried it several times now. Mmmmmm! For the veggie version, use TVP, vegetable broth and unflavored soy milk in place of chicken, meat stock and cream. In a previous review, someone mentioned adding an onion. I would highly recommend it, and maybe throw in some diced carrots, too. The first couple of times I made this, it was much too loose and watery. I would definitely recommend either making a rue or adding cornstarch to thicken the sauce. I've tried it both ways and both work equally well to bind it all together. It's recipes like this that shows once again that the simplest recipes can make the most delicious meals.

I have made this recipe several times now and it is a family favorit. I have followed the recipe exactly several times. Just as the other cook said. I have also, used biscuits (Bisquick) insted of Puff pastry and whole milk insted the whipping cream. My family likes both.

Rating: 3
I modified this recipe by adding sauted mushrooms and substituting biscuits for the pastry and light table cream for the whipping cream. Some of the liquid gets soaked up into the biscuits. I have made this three or four times and it is a family favorite.

This recipe needed some serious modification, it took me two tries. Most important: Add onions. I also recommend carrots, corn. One really nice touch is allspice - always a great spice with chicken. I also removed the whipping cream. Of course after doing all that the recipe has basically been decimated, so in it's current form it really isn't very good.

I have made this recipe several times, each time being a real success. I have another recipe that is similar, but more work. In order to make the sauce a bit creamier, I have needed to add approximately 2 tablespoons of flour.

Should direct the cook to make a veloute sauce from the chicken broth and cream. Veloute is just a bechamel made with broth instead of milk. If you make one first, then add the cream, the mixture won't be thin.

I made this recipe with 1/2 butternut squash soup (in the box from the store) and 1/2 chicken broth instead of all chicken broth since I ran out by mistake. Yummy! A great variation!

Next time I will double the vegetables (I used mixed veggies instead of just peas). The sauce was not creamy, but watery. Maybe add a bit of cornstarch next time. However, we liked this dish best as a leftover. It was very easy for me to prepare.

We liked this recipe very much. It was quite easy to prepare, especially with frozen puff pastry. The only change I made was to make and serve it in individual ramekins. Since it was self contained and I was not trying to dish out servings, I may not have noticed that the mixture was loose. I definitely will make it this way again.

I made this 'easy' chicken pot pie and was very disappointed. It was not hard but it was time consuming. It did not have a lot of taste and I doubled the vegetables and still too much chicken for my liking. But the real problem was that the sauce was like water. It was as if the cream separated and became just water. It needed some kind of thickener. I would not make it again. Not worth all the work.
