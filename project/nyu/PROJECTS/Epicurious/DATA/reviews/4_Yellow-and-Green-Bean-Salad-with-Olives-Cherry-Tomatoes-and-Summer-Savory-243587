Just made this for 4th of July gathering. Yum, yum. Used what was in the fridge, so no olives or feta. Substituted goat cheese for feta, added toasted almonds. Used almond oil in the dressing along with a little grainy mustard, Kewpie mayo (Japanese, so good!), tarragon and parsley. None left!

Great for summer. The mint worked really, really well -- great recommendation.

Well I couldn't find any yellow beans so it didn't have as much color but still looked nice. As recommended by other people I used mint instead of summer savory. Couldn't really taste it though and I was afraid to put too much in. I had doubled the recipe though since I was making it for a healthy eating class and I think all my measurements got thrown off. Everyone at the class loved it. It was refreshing but I, myself, was not a huge fan. I think next time I will try substituting the olives for feta and maybe try a balsamic dressing instead of the oil and vinegar.

I can't stress how excellent this tastes - perfect all summer long with a variety of different main dishes. We keep making it and never tire of eating it! A real keeper (and so, so easy).

Could not have found a more perfect summer salad. Yummo! Everyone raved and wanted the recipe. I used heirlooms too, added the feta used mint instead of s.savory and used balsamic instead. Took it camping, which worked great with a little pre trip prep work and steaming the beans before I left. Will add to my list of must haves for summer. Thank You Epi!

This is a fantastic summer recipe. I used a mix of heirloom cherry tomatoes in different colors, which made the salad very pretty. I also used mint, but not feta. Very light and easy!

Excellent recipe. Very light tasting. I added 2 shallots diced, used feta and substituted savory for fresh mint leaves. Will be making on a regualar basis.

Great summer salad! I added kalamata olives as well as feta as some suggested and it was perfect.

Thanks to the previous reviewers for the suggestions of feta and mint instead of summer savory. We took this salad as a side to a grill out party. There were many foodies there and all of them raved and were surprised at how simple this salad was to create. The mint was a really interesting fresh flavor for this salad. It will be a go to recipe in the future, for sure!

Utterly delicious. I had large green olives, which I pitted and cut up, instead of kalamata olives. I also added feta. I used raw apple cider vinegar instead of red wine vinegar. I loved it!

Great salad! I added some diced blood orange on top of each serving and it added just the right amount of citrus...delicious!

This is delicious. I didn't swap the olives for feta, I used both! baby heirlooms here, too. Really great.

I made this and substituted the olives for feta, mint for summer savory and baby heirlooms for the cherry tomatos. It was delightful!
