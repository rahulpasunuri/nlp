Just a note: Egg whites never contain salmonella; it´s the matter of yolks. So you don´t need to be afraid.

Fantastic. To make it look even better, I did what my mum used to do when we were kids. Tip brandy over the finished dessert and set alight with a match - turn out the lights first! Loads of oohs and ahhs!

For me, this recipe was no more than the sum of its parts. It tastes exactly like you think it will. Yes, it looks wonderful, but the inside is a bit dull.

This is such a simple dish to make and always makes a great impression. I first made it for a dinner party to many oohs and aahs, and it's in the oven right now for Valentine's Day dessert - can't go wrong for any occasion!

Impress your guests with this dessert. It looks elegant,tastes oh so good, and is incredibly easy to make. I've used coffee and chocolate ice cream when I've made this. I don't know what is wrong with the nameless reviewer who gave this one fork!

Wonderful dessert and A+ on presentation! I use angel food cake instead of pound cake and it works great, plus it's much better for you. The only reason I am giving it a three fork rating is it's a pain to cut.

Fabulous!! I have made this numerous times, always to rave reviews! But I do make my own sponge or chiffon cake in a 9-inch layer pan--it fits without trimming into a 9-inch pie plate. No crumbs, no waste--perfect!! Try this--your guests will be impressed! And it isn't hard at all. You can assemble the cake layer and ice cream several days ahead, and throw together the meringue and bake it during your party!!

I would definitely make this again! I made it for Easter and my family loved it. It is incredibly simple to make, yet looks fancy. The sliced cake pieces do fall apart when serving, though, so for a really fancy occassion you may want to bake a full cake for the bottom.

Absolutely fabulous with a dramatic presentation that doesn't stop delivering after the oohs and ahhhs subside.The meringue is rather quick to brown so watch it like a hawk and have the tin foil ready to pop on top loosely The only suggestion I would make is that, instead of cutting up the pound cake to fit the pie plate, bake your own cake base and trim it to fit. All those loose little hunks detract from the overall enjoyment - picture huge crumb chunks on your plate. A simply first rate and EASY recipe!

Super!! I served this at a dinner party and got wonderful compliments. I had always been afraid to try it, but had no problems and it was pleasing to the eye as well as the tongue!!
