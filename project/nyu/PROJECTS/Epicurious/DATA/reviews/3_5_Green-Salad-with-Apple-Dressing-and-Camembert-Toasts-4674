This was super easy, and the flavor combinations were great. I would not recommend making this dressing in a different salad, as it was very vinegary, so it really needed the cheese toast pairing to make it work. But this exact recipe is lovely.

I have made this salad a number of times and each time I wonder why I don't make it even more. I think it is great the way it is. I have made it with the toasts and without. I have added toasted walnuts or not. I like it any way I do it. I do not find it bland at all.

I made this salad for thanksgiving everyone loved it. I did not make the camembert toast, instead I crumbled some gorgonzola cheese on top. This added some bite to it. Will do this one again for sure. I did not find it bland at all.

I soaked leafy green lettuce leaves with the apples, drained, filled with the apples, a little chopped walnut and a few dried cherries. Make a bundle and secure it to the bread and cheese with a toothpick. All liked it so much I was asked if I had any reserved.

Nice presentation, but I too found the dressing a bit bland. I added toasted walnuts, but it didn't jazz it up enough.

I have to say that, although the presentation is lovely, I really didn't much care for this salad. I found the dressing to be very bland, even a little weird (maybe because I'm more used to a vinaigrette). If you are going to make this for a dinner party, I would try it out beforehand (as I did NOT do last night!).

This was a big hit with 3 adult men and one female. The only suggestion is that perhaps walnuts would be a good addition. It was great! We loved the apples marinated in the dressing. Gave them a wonderful flavor.

Everyone loved this recipe. The walnut oil in the dressing gave it a unique taste!

This salad is so easy to make! Found the dressing to be a bit dull so I added herbs and spices! But otherwise it is good!

I have also used sesame oil with this, but because of its strong flavor used 1 Tbsp. plus the rest extra virgin olive oil. Not too traditional, but a very nice flavor!

I'm living in Normandy and finding a local recipe on your site was... interesting! I never spreda Camembert myself on bread. I just serve it on a plate.

I love this salad! It is so simple and so pretty and tastes great. I now serve it regularly at dinner parties after the main course. I was unable to find walnut oil, so used hazlenut oil instead, with great results.
