I couldn't be happier with the receipe. My children and husband loved it. I used apricot preserves because I had it on hand. It was quick and easy.

So easy to make and delicious! I always struggle with using the second half of a pineapple (after I've eaten my fill of it straight). Plus, this dish takes me away from winter - for an evening at least.

We make this dish regularly. Even my 2 year old LOVES it (minus the spicy mayo). I've also drizzled the chipotle mayo on fish tacos.

We made this dish for a dinner party for 10. Everyone loved it!! I will make it again but add a bit more heat to the Spicy Chile Sauce.

Neither my husband nor I liked the idea of mayonnaise on the fish, so I added the chipotles to the pineapple salsa. After my 11 yr old son got over the shock of spicy pineapples, he gobbled it down. I'll definatley make this again!

I am having some guests over for dinner and decided to give it a try. It turned out delicious and will certainly prepare it for my dinner party next friday. Thank you for excellent recipes. Carola Diaz
