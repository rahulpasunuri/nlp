I used a classic smokey BBQ sauce and it was very overpowering - will not be making this again.

If you expect your coleslaw to taste like bbq sauce, then this recipe is fine. Served on top of the pulled pork sandwich it's better, but alone, it simply tastes like bbq sauce.

Just...ok. The bbq sauce might have thrown me off. I'll spend my energies on another recipe next time.

Great match for the pork shoulder sandwiches on this site. Adds the perfect amount of "crunch". However, I omitted the bbq sauce (would rather let people add their own at the table) and added a red cabbage for colour. I think it's also important to make sure you use a whole egg mayonaise (Not Miracle Whip) as it doesn't have any added sugar or vinegar. Otherwise it will end up too sour/sweet.

This is so easy to prepare and the kids like it. I do add some grated carrot to enhance it's appearance.

I especially liked this coleslaw on top of the Carolina Barbecue pork and for that I give it a 3. On it's own, a 2, I'm not as excited about it and like other recipes better.

Although the associated barbecue recipe is out of this world, this slaw recipe is just so-so at best. The color is a bit off putting and the flavor is lacks depth or any excitement. There are far better coleslaw recipes in the world. Won't waste the time to make again.

BEST COLESLAW I'VE TASTED. I MADE HALF OF THE RECIPE AND STARTED EATING IMMEDIATELY. MADE IT WITH PULLED PORK (GAIL'S RECIPE SWAP), BARBEQUE BAKED BEANS (EPICURIOUS), RICE AND PORTUGUESE CORNMEAL WHITE BREAD. EVERYONE RAVED.

I am confused on all the negative comments for this recipe. I have taken this to many occasions and have left with an empty bowl each time. I work with the dressing until it is just right. I add a carrot and do half green/ half purple cabbage to make it present better. This is a good recipe.

I'm picky about my cole slaw and this one is a winner. I made it using homemade barbecue sauce and added more than the recipe called for. If using a very sweet sauce, you might want to add a bit less sugar depending on how you like your cole slaw.

I didn't find this recipe very thrilling. It is not a beautiful dish, as you can imagine, and was only picked at at a party I recently had. All in all, blech.

With a food processor this recipe was very easy to make. I'm not sure why, but some people say it tastes of horseradish! This could use some grated carrot. Makes a LOT of slaw!

An outstanding recipe that perfectly matches the pork barbecue sandwiches receipe.
