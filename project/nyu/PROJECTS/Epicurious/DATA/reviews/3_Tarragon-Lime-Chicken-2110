A summer staple at our house, I always use fresh tarragon, finely chopped.

This was pretty bland. It needs "something", maybe some garlic or zest. Although this is an easy recipe, I won't be making it again. One fork from me.

The first time I tried this recipe, I used the original ingredients. Then I tried it with orange and ginger upon the suggestion of one of the cooks. It was even better!! I'll use it again and again!!

It's good and it's simple. And you can change it completely by substituting another citrus and herb - for example lemon and rosemary or orange and ginger (the last was oddly good!) But Pittsburgh - your variation is a different recipe entirely. Basically breaded chicken which is good but some people don't want that much fat (those breadcrumbs soak up the oil, baby!)

This was ok, however, if you like tarragon and chicken, I have a much better recipe. For 2 1/2 to 3 lbs. boneless chicken breasts that have been pounded and cut in thirds: Mix 2 cups unseasoned breadcrumbs with about 3 to 4 tbsp. minced fresh tarragon, salt and pepper to taste. Beat 3 to 4 eggs, and dip chicken in eggs then dredge in breadcrumb mixture. Allow to sit for at least 1/2 hour. In large skillet, melt 2 tbsp. butter with 2 tbs. olive oil. Brown chicken in batches on each side, about 1-2 min ea. side. Drain on paper towels. Serve with wedges of lime to squeeze on top. Excellent and easy.

Quick, Simple, Delicious. Perfect for anyone that doesn't have a lot of time to cook. My husband and my 20 month old son loved it. This one's definetly a keeper.

I don't know what went wrong here because after reading the other reviews, I thought this would be delicious. I even let it marinade overnight. I found the flavours to be underwhelming. Overall, it was o.k. but I don't think I would rush to make it again.

Tarragon and grilled chicken just seem to go together. The Foreman grill pales in comparison to cooking over (or under) an open flame. Try this grilled and you won't be disappointed.

Very flavorful, and very easy to put together. I marinated it for a couple hours in the fridge and cooked it on a Foreman grill. The taste of lime is not overpowering, and it's very tangy and refreshing. We will definitely make this again since it's so simple and we have all the ingredients on hand.

This was very easy to prepare and tasted good, but not great. It would be a good dish to make if you're pressed for time since it calls for so few ingredients.

A basic, quick, every-day kind of dish. I think it's a little excessive in the dried spice category; fresh herbs might be better. Good, but not spectacular.

Best grilled over the barbecue verses broiling.

Excellent combination of flavors - the chicken was exceptionally moist and each bite revealed the wonderful tarragon and lime blend. Easy to make for those in a hurry. Will definitely make again.

Was very good, but grilling time needs to be longer to insure doneness. Served with a southwestern style rice with black beans. Will fix again.

Delicious! And so simple to prepare. Tasted like I was eating out!
