This was wonderful as is. I used all criminis as they are my favorite. The flavors in the filling were outstanding. If you let the strudel rest for a few minutes, you'll have no trouble slicing it. The pesto was a very nice addition that complemented the flavors. A perfect first course.

The flavors were good but the amount of mushrooms turned out to be overwhelming. I will cook this again but reduce the amount of mushrooms, at least by 20 percent.

Delicious! I'm vegetarian and I made this for my mother and myself for dinner. She was skeptical, but she loved it after one bite. I didn't bother making arugula pesto from scratch; I bought regular pesto and put it in the blender with some arugula and it was an excellent accompaniment. It was really dainty, though, so next time I'll do as others suggested and use a couple of extra sheets of phyllo.

Excellent. A lovely lunch dish or first course. Thanks for the suggestions of chopping the mushrooms, adding more seasoning and phyllo sheets, and scoring the top before baking. I served it with Sage Pesto (Bon Appetit recipe) since I happened to have it on hand. It was delicious.

I've made this several times, each time a hit. I make two strudels, 5 sheets each, skipping the thyme between layers, and also score them before baking. I don't bother with the arugula pesto. I mix a couple tablespoons bottled pesto (basil) with about 3/4C cream, warm in sauce pan and drizzle over each sliced strudel. Garnish with a little extra sun-dried tomato for color.

what this recipe needs is a good port wine sauce! I made a similar recipe, using Philo dough a few weeks ago. The mix of mushrooms works, but the port wine sauce makes the recipe!. Use about 4-5 sheets of philo in each layer, buttered in between each sheet.

Sorry to be the one to break the 100% favorable review, but my husband and I didn't like this at all. It was boring and had no flavor. We will not make it again...

Excellent addition to a vegetarian spread. Flavors came together beautifully. Yes, I would make this again.

We really took our time and followed recipe carefully -- and took note of some other great user tips: made sure to score strudel to make it easier to cut (worked like a charm), and used an extra layer (2) of phyllo. It was wonderful. We ate as main course with salad, and still have leftovers! Worth the effort, especially if you love mushroom dishes like we do!

I haven't made this specific strudel, but I've worked with phyllo lots. It really helps if you score the strudel before you bake it. This way it won't all crumble when you slice it after it's baked.

Yummmm. Definitely one to make again! I had trouble with presentation, though. My strudel slices fell apart when I slice it. Maybe I didn't roll it tightly enough? If you have any thoughts on this, please post them! I'm thinking that next time I'll make "Wild Mushroom Purses" -- see the recipe here for "Caramelized Banana Purses" for the technique. I could take or leave the arugula pesto. I had leftover strudel today for lunch, and didn't really miss the pesto.

This is a "company quality" recipe - although I didn't like the arugula pesto. I would make it with a roasted pepper coulis instead. I've made this twice, the first time it came out a bit bland so make sure you season the mushrooms well.

I changed the pesto...its almost impossible to find arugula in Victoria - go figure! As a note for next time...I'd use 4 sheets of philo pastry and slice the mushrooms MUCH thinner..chunky mushrooms break through 2 sheets of philo when you're cutting it.

Excellent first course for a dinner party. I served it alongside a tiny bit of dressed mixed greens. The pesto is indeed plentiful, but the leftovers were wonderful the next night tossed with hot penne pasta! Recommended.

VERY FLAVORFUL. I LIKED THE DIFFERENT TEXTURES. I HAVE MADE IT TWICE AND BOTH TIMES IT WAS A SUCCESS. I CONCUR REGUARDING THE PESTO.

The mushroom strudel was excellent and fairly simple to make. When I made the arugula pesto I must have overpacked the arugula as it turned out too thick. It also seemed to make more than was needed for the one strudel.
