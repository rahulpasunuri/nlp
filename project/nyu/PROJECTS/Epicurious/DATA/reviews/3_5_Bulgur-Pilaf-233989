This was delicious and simple to make. My 9 year old loves it too. I left out the almonds and I used ground coriander from a jar rather than crushing the seeds. This was simpler but I would love to try crushing the seeds when I have more time. This recipe has become a favorite of mine already--easy, healthy and delicious.

Really nice. It's great to have a recipe so simple that you can taste the, as is stated in the intro, "lovely floral note" of the coriander. It's true! Super easy and filling, so add this to your weeknight, ugh, we've eaten too much meat this week repertoire.

We loved this! I added some diced carrot. It was nice, flavorful, and fluffy. Good texture.

This is a staple for our house. Its so easy, so tasty and so healthy. It goes really well with another of my favorite easy recipes - chicken, grated beets, beet greens and orange butter. Every time I make it I cant get enough of it.

I made this to accompany Chicken Marbella and it rocked! The crunchiness of the almonds, grains, and coriander seeds was a wonderful contrast to the soft texture and sweet taste of the chicken. This was my first time cooking bulgur and I used what I think was coarse bulgur (bought in bulk), rather than fine. It was delicious and felt really healthy. I'll try the Near East bulgur next time.

I just made this with bulgur, chicken stock (instead of water) and the crushed coriander. G-R-E-A-T.

I made this as a side for straccetti di manzo. I found it easier to lightly pound the coriander seeds with a mallet. Toasting almonds is absolutely necessary. I used near east wheat salad mix without the seasoning packet, but forgot not to use the entire package of bulgar; The recipe only calls for a scant cup. It turned out okay (added more water). This may be good with lemon zest or dried fruits added.
