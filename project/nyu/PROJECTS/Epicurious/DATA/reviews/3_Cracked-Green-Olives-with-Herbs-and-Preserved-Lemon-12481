I made preserved lemons last week for this recipe. The recipe for preserved lemons was as poorly written as this one! Someone tried to sun-dry and then oven dry the lemons before preserving! Now this is calling for 1/2 preserved lemon skin. Does this mean 1/2 of one lemon wedge called for in the recipe, 1/2 of the entire amount of lemons called for in the recipe, or 1/2 of one lemon of 8 wedges..i.e 4 lemon wedges????? If you have no idea what I'm talking about, click on the Preserved Lemon recipe above. I am personally going to just 'wing it,' but wish it was more clearly stated. I have never seen, made, tasted or used preserved lemons before and I doubt that many of us have. It would be nice for the recipe writer to keep that in mind..."Peel of 1/2 preserved lemon," hmmmmm???

I couldn't find brine-soaked green olives, but the relatively bland, cracked green olives that I used were delicious once they had marinated in preserved lemon and herbs. Great flavor!
