Hey, Good veal is not common in this grcery stores in my area. So when I found some fresh veal I gave this one a try. A winner I would cut back on the salt a little next time.

Nancy Pelosi and left wingers to the side( I agree w/ Nancy's agenda and don't believe being "left" is wrong;)) Great start up recipe. Using lemons over vinegar works best in my world as well :).

I halved this recipe for a smaller family. Used balsmic vinegar AFTER the capers were nicely browned and crisp. Then I added a bit more olive oil so as to have a gravy .Served over picolino farfale

I did not have lemons, so this was a quick, easy and delicious alternative. I used most of the butter but had no parsley.

This was super easy and better than similar dishes we've had at restaurants. I couldn't find veal at our grocery so flattened some thin pork cutlets which worked perfectly. For our sides we had green beans with sauteed mushrooms/thyme/shallots/toasted almonds and pasta with a sprinkle of parmesan reg. Yummy!

I made the whole recipe mostly with olive oil and only a tiny pat of butter for flavor. Much better for those watching their cholesterol. And it was great.

My husband made this recipe and accidentally used green peppercorns instead of capers. It was delicious!

Good recipe but it's only as good as the veal scallopini that you can purchase. Agree with others who subbed lemon juice for the vinegar.

I used chicken because I didn't have veal or pork on hand but it was still fantastic. It would be even more decadent with veal.

As I had pork cutlets on hand, but I bet veal would be fabulous also. I substituted lemon juice for the vinegar, as recommended by others. I LOVED it, glad I was home alone so I could lick the plate. Felt like I was at a 4 fork restaurant, & it was so inexpensive to makeas I got the pork at $1.29 a pound. Will definately entertain with this one!

As a former Walnut Creeker and a SF Bay Area native, I have to agree with Chefboyami here, Angiemon. Don't cook the veal too long... its really not a horrible thing to eat veal. If you prefer, go for the Whole Foods veal... organic, very good. Try this recipe, you'll LOVE it!

It's recipes like this that make me want to open a restaurant. This was so easy and so tasty. The veal was perfect and I purchased marked down packages because they were close to their expiration date. To Angiemon in Walnut Creek, I think you need to relieve yourself of any guilt about veal and trust and understand that what plays well in San Francisco is pretty funny to the rest of the country. This veal is fully cooked in the time mentioned in the recipe. Keep in mind, no matter what your neighbors or the left coast tells you, killing young calves and producing their meat for the masses is a wonderful thing. The meat is very tender and tasty, the land does not support keeping the calf until it becomes cow by eating more feed and grain and taking some of this food away from those who need it. Tender young veal is a good thing and Nancy Pelosi is a farce.

For some reason, it took MUCH longer for the veal to cook, and it ended up being pretty tough. It was not awful; the flavor was good, it was just the texture that was severely lacking. Now, as a girl from the California Bay Area, I am more than a little aware of how ethically and morally loaded eating veal is. If I am going to go ahead and eat it, I want it to draw ecstatic noises from me with each bite- any advice on how to get it swallowable in less than three minutes per bite?

Like other reviewers, I used 1.5 T lemon juice instead of red wine vinegar. Excellent meal.

Took some suggestions - I used lemon juice instead of vinegar and since I didn't have capers in the house I used green olives - it's a keeper! Very easy weeknight meal. I served it with steam cauliflower and mashed potatoes. Yum!

Quick, easy, and excellent! I used white balsamic instead of red wine vinegar, and very thin chicken breasts instead of the veal. It was done in about 5 minutes, and my girlfriend thought it tasted like a gourmet dish! She loved it! A definite keeper.

Love this quick dinner- my husband AND kids asked for seconds! I like to use lemon juice instead of the vinegar, and top each piece with a slice of Gruyere. Yum!

One of my all time favorite dishes! Really easy to prepare. Get the best capers you can find. You can also substitute lemon juice for the vinegar and chicken or pork for the veal.
