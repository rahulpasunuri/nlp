I make this all the time with great results. I'm delighted to hear the curry analogy b/c I often use whatever herbs I happen to have on hand -- some recipes call for small amounts of fresh basil, parsley, cilantro, oregano, what have you . . . and I can't bear seeing leftovers go to waste so I just whirl them all up into this chimichurri. It's always good and we all love the bright, fresh flavors.

not sure if it's "authentic" or not, but it's good. I served this over salad greens, grape tomatoes, green onions. Used sauce as dressing and garnished with a few sprigs of cilantro.

I am also from Argentina and I'll have to agree with A Cook from Buenos Aires about the ingredients we use for the chimichurri. In a way, this dressing is like Indian curry, almost every family "asador" has their own recipe! The recipe shown on video was OK but not the real one. What's more, we usually use dried herbs to make it, which in combination with the high proportion of vinegar it takes (3 parts of vinegar per 1 part of oil) you can keep in the fridge for quite a while and enjoy it with other meat AND chicken recipes.

I am argentine and I must say you that ingredients of chimichurri are oregano, parsley, garlic, cayenne, vinegar and corn oil mixed to taste. Thanks.

It was as good as the chef promised in the video. The only change I made was to lower the amount of vinegar slightly as my husband is not a vinegar fan. I am and it was still wonderful. Everyone was right, the sauce was great with all the veggies I served.

hadeshnds from Saratoga, CA: There IS cayenne pepper in the original recipe, bottom ingredient. I haven't made this yet, but I want to because of the rave reviews! Can someone tell me if the cilantro flavour comes through really strongly? I'm really not a fan, and I only tolerate it in small doses in salsa. Do you think it would still be tasty without?

Help me out here. A ton of reviewers are adding that they added extra red pepper flakes, that they doubled the cayenne, that they "saved extra sauce" after marinating etc. I'm sure I just haven't read enough of the reviews. But there are no red pepper flakes or cayenne in the original recipe, nor does it call for you to rub the chimichurri itself on the meat! It would be great if the reviewers would add that this was their particular change or that they had followed the notes of other reviewers, rather than making it seem like it was part of the original recipe. Having blithered on about all of that, this IS great and easy. I doubled the recipe because I have a large family, and there really didn't seem to be enough rub to cover the meat-any thoughts on that from other cooks?The sauce is awesome-do grill your meat on the barbie if at all possible.And yes, more garlic!

I make this all the time in the summer on a grill pan. Awesome! The chimichurri is fantastic. We just grill some peppers and onions and make fajitas with it.

This is just so, so, so simple and good. I can't wait to make it again! The only change that we made to the recipe was adding a second garlic clove. We prepared it on our George Foreman since that's all we've got!

Loved the chimichurri sauce. Served it with grilled ribeyes and can't wait to try it with flank steak next time. I did use two garlic cloves and substituted sherry vinegar for the white. Super easy and delicious served with baked sweet potato, arugula salad and grilled peppers. Yum!

My wife's favorite dinner. We make this all the time. Cilantro makes the sauce extra special, but dried cilantro or bottled will work in a pinch. This is even good without the sauce, but is still good without. Highly, highly, recommended.

Very good and easy. The only places we strayed from the recipe were to use red pepper flakes instead of cayenne, and to grill the steak instead of broil it. I will definitely make this again.

Rating: 4
Wonderful and easy. After reading the reviews, I added a second clove of garlic, a little coriander and cumin, and a pinch of sugar to the chimichurri. I also used sherry vinegar instead of white and reduced the amount to 3 tablespoons. I mixed a little of the chimichurri with the spice rub, added enough olive oil to make a paste, and rubbed that all over the steaks about 8 hours before grilling them. Big hit, great sauce!

Rating: 3
The steak was phenomenal. However, I found the chimichurri to be way too full of vinegar, and heavy on the parsley. Next time I will increase the cilantro in place of some parsley. Also might use significantly less vinegar. Everyone else is raving about the chimichurri though so perhaps i just really blew it.

This recipe was very good. I plan on making it again

Rating: 4
Very good recipe. I used more cilantro and less parsley. In stead of cayenne I used red pepper flakes. I made the chimichurri the night before and used some to marinate the steak in overnight. I felt that this infused the steak more with garlicly goodness of the chimichurri and it smelled delicious as it was under the broiler. The key to serving this steak is slicing it very thin on an angle against the grain. After drissling some chimichurri on top before serving it was a great presentation! Great recipe.

great--added a bit of lemon juice to the sauce. 6 minutes per side was too long to broil for medium-rare. I did 4 min per side. Adjust according to meat thicknes

The chimichurri is easy and delicious! I used less oil and more cilantro than called for, and it worked out fine. Had leftover meat and sauce, so I ground them together in the food processor and used it as taco filling - delicious!

Nice fresh flavor in the sauce- I added another clove of garlic, which was perfect. The rub on the steak was good too- just the right amount. Served with wilted spinach and corn on the cob, this was fast, easy and delicious.

This was just delicious. I made it for my mom & she insisted that I make her the exact same dish for her birthday the next week. I thought the chimichurri sauce might be too strong - but it was the perfect complement to the steak. My only modification was adding more garlic.

I make this dish frequently for my family and we love it. It is particularly good for busy weeknights because you can make the sauce in the morning and marinate the meat in the fridge all day (reserving a bit of sauce for dipping). We usually grill the steak rather than broiling it, but otherwise follow the recipe as printed.

Rating: 4
the chimichurri sauce is amazing. Two people ate almost the whole batch of sauce, over steak and mixed into crushed potatoes and celeraic. It is vibrant green with bright, refreshing flavors. Much better than chimichurri that I've had at inexpensive argentinian steakhouses in new york where it's been sitting on the table for a couple days. The chimichurri would go great with any steamed or boiled root veggie or grilled or blackened meat or fish.

I realized that I had reviewed the wrong recipe! I made steak and chimichurri toasts, also from this web site. After I submitted my review, I read the other reviews and said, "Hmm, why is everyone talking about cilantro when the recipe calls only for parsley?" Oops! Sorry, folks!

I made this for a large family dinner to rave reviews. I served it as an entree - didn't toast the bread or put the meat slices on the toast. Marinated the flank steaks with a little of the sauce, and then grilled them, serving the chimichurri on the side. I doubled the garlic & the red pepper flakes for the sauce. Everyone loved the chimichurri, and sopped up their bread in it, as well as putting it on their meat. My stepdaughter & brother-in-law both requested the recipe. A real winner!

Rating: 3
This is probably closer to 3.5 forks -- if you make it with some modifications. You have to punch up the spices. Gotta get more garlic in there. Add some ground black pepper and more cayenne; also add ground coriander seeds and cumin to the chimichurri sauce, plus sneak in something for just a whisper of sweetness. Authentic or not, the base recipe is a solid foundation for experimentation, and will yield nice results....

We don't eat a lot of beef, but sometimes nothing else will do. I had another recipe for chimichurri with more garlic, red wine vineger, and additional red pepper flakes, so I adapted. I think next time I will rub the beef with lime juice before the dry rub, and maybe replace some of the vinegar in the sauce with lime juice. This was really easy, would make a great week-night supper, but is a little fancy too.

This is a good recipe... I found I liked the chimichurri sauce a lot more when I added more garlic (4 cloves) and upped the olive oil amount to about 1/2 c. Also, I'm not a big cilantro person, so I like to do more parsley than cilantro. That said this is great... have made it at least a half dozen times so far, since getting the recipe at the beginning of summer!

When I lived in Mexico City my favorite restaurant was called La Mansion. Although the name was French, the cuisine was typically Argentinian. One of my favorites was their Tenderloin a la parrilla. Beef grilled over open flame [wonderful smoky flavor] with Chimichurri sauce. The sauce was simple. It was olive oil, red vinegar, garlic and tarragon -- lots and lots of tarragon! Things like coriander and cumin would never be used. Oregano? I don't remember if it was used. I make it at home and used it with quesadillas also. I must hasten to add that this recipe was tasty -- just not authentic.

The first time I made this it was for a large party. Almost everyone asked for the recipe! Since then when some of those same guests have come over for dinner they have requested I make it again! The cilantro sauce I've used in a variety of other dishes as well....adding a bit to potato salad...as part of a vinegrette for sliced cucumbers and tomoatoes... I always make extra so that I can have cold steak and sauce sandwiches! I make this dish once a month now.

This recipe is very good,but not authentic;we argentinians do not know what coriander or cilantro is,and don't use any kind of pepper,EVER. Basically,chimichurri is a mix with all the spices you find in a argentine kitchen with oil and vinegar,but diferent cooks have diferent recipes. But this recipe,I repeat is not bad,at all.

I served this sauce for a dinner party along with filet mignon which was grilled on BBQ. I loved the tangy yet subdued flavors and the fact that it was very different than the typical BBQ sauce or steak sauce. I like garlic and used 3 cloves, which really was a little too strong (next time I'll use 1 or 2). I did substitute red wine vinegar (a few other chimichurri recipes I researched called for it) instead of white vinegar. Everyone loved the tangy taste. I'll definitely make it again!

I'd really like to give this a 2 1/2 forks. I can't believe that I didn't read the instructions regarding prep. I was just looking for a marinade. I combined all of the ingredients in a zip lock bag & added sliced beef. Let it all marinade for 24 hrs. Sauted with onions & peppers (yellow, green, & red). Wrapped in spicy tomato tortillas. Corn on the side. Simply prepared with salt & pepper. A few tostito chips. Easy weeknight dinner. Will make again.

Oue steaks were only 1/2 inch thick so I reduced the cooking time to 5 minutes a side. The sauce was excellent and very easy to prepare.As an option , I would consider substituting red wine vinegar or lime juice for the white vinegar. Mexican oregano seems a natural addition here with /or without reducing the cilantro.Fresh mint in place of cilantro would also be interesting.
