I made this for a big crowd at someone else's home and was going to give it a poor review, until I made a smaller dish with leftover ingredients a few nights later and realized that you must use cream and not skimp on the amount or substitute half and half as I did. Couldn't believe the difference. The struesel topping, by the way, keeps nicely and is very versatile. I combined it with crushed pecans and used it as a topping for baked northern pike, with outstanding results.

This recipe is all about the homemade breadcrumbs. I used 3 slices of stale white bread, lightly browned at 170F in the oven. Once throughly dried, it was popped in the food processor to roughly chop. Add that to the melted butter mix. Delicious.

I realize it's not super sophisticated, but this is exceptional for a broccoli side dish. Made exactly, but can easily see how streusel can be manipulated.

This was just ok. Hubby wasnt crazy about it either. followed all the tips and it was still dry. Now, I did love the streusel-doubled the recipe and saved half of it for another use. Just wasnt thrilled.

We loved, loved, loved this recipe. Seemed like a lot of mustard when I was making the topping, but it was perfection. Used the leftovers as a filling for fried wontons (processed them in the food processor) and they were to-die-for good.

This is a family favorite! I do, however, make some small changes which keeps my casserole from being dry. First, I steam the broccoli florets rather than boil them - so I avoid having to drain and dry them. I also cut down on the amount of broccoli florets to 2 pounds. I increase the amount of cream to 3/4 cup. The crumbs (which I like to make from rosemary bread) are already quite salty from the shredded Parmesan/Romano/Asiago mix I use, so I omit the additional salt. I use 3/4 c. Parmesan/Romano/Asiago total - 1/2 cup in the crumb mixture and 1/4 cup in the sauce. Lastly, I have found that cooking time can be reduced to 20 minutes - depending on how well your broccoli was cooked while steaming. Overall, I agree with other reviewers that you need to cut the broccoli or add more sauce or both for this to work well - but I also think that these changes make for a great recipe. People who don't normally like broccoli love this and ask for seconds! I also agree that these crumbs are delightful, and would be excellent on top of a macaroni and cheese casserole... :-)

If you like crumbly topping and home-style flavor, this dish is perfect. I would like to have a bit more moisture next time, such as adding more cream or melted cheese. The breadcrumbs and parmesan soaked up quite and bit of moisture when baking. But all in all delicious, and I would make it again.

Good, but not earth-shaking. Just broccoli topped with seasoned crumbs. I thought it needed some lemon or capers or something like that to brighten it up. But the garlicky, mustardy crumbs are really good. I'll probably use them on macaroni and cheese next time to give that dish a lift.

We made this and two of us ate almost the entire thing. It has a nice old fashioned comfort food quality. I used regular breadcrumbs, added sliced mushrooms to the topping, and did not have the cream. I also used the broccoli stalks, peeled and sliced.

An excellent way to eat broccoli, everyone loved it. I used double the onion, 2T butter and sprayed the top with butter PAM. You must use FRESH breadcrumbs and parmesan, as well as top notch mustard. As to the reviewer who prefers the Cooking Light recipe - it is kind of the difference between an Oreo and flourless chocolate tart - both good but the tart may not appeal to everyone.

I have made this a number of times and each time someone asks for the recipe. The topping is delicious. I used a French wheat bread last time, with the crusts trimmed.

The breadcrumbs were way too dry and abundant -- it was like dumping a bucket of sand on the poor broccoli (and I only used half!). Not sure why the proportions are so wonky in this recipe; I certainly won't be trying it again.

Rating: 0
This was awful, dry, and tasteless. It is not worthy of a rating. I blanched the broccoli so it wouldn't be overcooked (as others suggested). That was the only good this about it. The breadcrumb topping was like emptying your toaster crumbs on your broccoli. You could barely taste the mustard flavor. Hardly any zip.

I was a little worried about this recipe, but it turned out to be a nice surprise. Everyone (including kids) ate it and thought it was a nice change to all my other broc recipes. A little time consuming...I est approx 1hr if you start the water boiling for the brocoli BEFORE you start the streusel. I made this for Thanksgiving dinner, and will definitely add it to my cookbook.

I was in such a hurry when I decided to change plain ol steamed broccoli to this more enticing kind. My husband actually ate it. I just used some progresso bread crumbs and 1% milk. It had lots of flavor and perfect consistency. I kept running back to my computer for reference. I'm sure I barely measured anything.

I thought this was terrible. Very dry and kept getting clumps of mustard in my mouth. Do not think of this as a creamy casserole, definitely just steamed veggies with a crusty top. Gross. Much better recipe on Cooking Light website, a broccoli chedder casserole that is out of this world! I should have made that one again.

I served this for the first time for Easter and it was such a hit that I had to pass out the recipe to everyone present. It was decided that this should become a standard addition to our yearly Easter meal.

Substituted 1/2 and 1/2 for the cream - and added about 2-3 TBSP of left over goat cheese from a salad. I ground up old croutons for the breadcrumb mixture. I didn't pre-cook the broccoli - I just covered the pan with foil for around 15 minutes - then removed it so it could crisp up.It was YUMMY!

A crowd pleaser, even with people who are not big broccoli fans. Recipe is delicious, though a bit heavy with all the butter and cream.

I made some changes...I steamed the broccoli and used panko...only about 3/4 of a cup for half of a recipe. I omitted the butter and used olive oil instead. I cut back on the cream and used some 1% milk...just a splash of each. I also used a mixture of muenster and parmesan cheese as that's what I had on hand. I used flavored olive oil to "butter" the pan. Instead of mixing the cheese into the streusel, I sprinkled it on top of the broccoli and then put the streusel over it. Also, I just covered the broccoli with the streusel. There was plenty left over. I feel as though I've been stuck in a rut with steamed broccoli, so this is a great alternative!

I love this dish. And you can make it healthier without sacrificing flavor. I tripled onion and doubled garlic and dry mustard, as I like a zippier mustard flavor. I used 7-grain in place of sourdough for breadcrumbs. I also used about half the cream and butter. Couldn't have been better.

This is great!! The subtle mustard flavor combined with the crispy crumb topping and bright green brocolli is a bit addictive!

I would make this dish again, but will definately only pre-cook the broccoli for a minute. And then make sure not to overcook it in the oven either. I also think that it was way too many breadcrumbs, will cut back next time.

I thought it was really, really good. The only thing I'll do differently next time is put the parmesan only in the custard part - the crumbs were delicious before the parmesan, but it got kind of dry once I added the cheese. (And of course the broccoli was a little mushy, but that was my own fault for using frozen.)

This is my husband's favorite! You can't go wrong. Even my 5 year old liked it.

I too found that I had way too much bread crumbs...maybe I did something wrong. I toasted the bread in the oven, put the bread in the cuisenart and only used less than 2 cups rather than the 2 1/2 it required. And, even then I ended up adding another 2-3 tbls of butter to moisten the bread crumb mix. That all said, it was good and easy so I'll definetely make this again. Oh...and I also took someone's advise and only boiled the broccoli for 1 minute rather than the 3 suggested in the recipe and it was perfect - not too mushy

Delicious, Delicious, Delicious. My husband and I loved it. I followed the recipe exactly - you don't want to over steam the broccoli. It's definitely not a cheesy dish or a casserole dish, think steamed veggie with great breadcrumbs.

I suppose if you are used to a broccoli-cheese casserole then this would be too dry, but since my family is used to plain broccoli, it was plenty moist and the dijon flavoring was spot-perfect. Many compliments at the dinner table (and easy to prep the day before).

This is an easy and delicious recipe for a crowd. Made it at Thanksgiving for two years now. Always a big hit. I usually alter recipes but didn't do a thing to this one. It was good just as is.

Hmmm. I don't know what happened, but there seems to be way too much bread crumb topping and it's pretty darn dry. I may have sauted the crumbs too long in an attempt to get them as crispy as the recipe recommends. The broccoli is also a bit dry. I will make it again, but I will add more butter and cheese to the crumbs and more cream to the broccoli.

I planned to make this for a woman that I cater for, and at her request for a "broccoli cheese casserole" I swallowed my pride and started looking up recipes. When I came to this one it seemed that it would be easy enough to create a unique and upscale spin on her desired dish, so I carefully read all th reviews and here is the delicious dish that resulted: -used broccoli rabe, and did not pre-boil -sprinkled broccoli generously with Kosher salt before cooking -added 3 additional ounces of parmesan to the streudel -Added 1/4 C finely chopped shallots and finally, -one extra clove of garlic. Also cook for less time in the oven, but finish off with a broil for about 1 minute to make sure that the topping is extra crunchy

Why add all these carbs to fresh broccoli? Skip the bread crumbs. Saute onion and garlic and add to mustard/cheese mix.

This recipe is very good when made with a few additions and corrections. Add 1/3 cup minced shallots in with the garlic and 1/4 teaspoon cayanne pepper. The important part is to put the blanched broccoli into an ice water bath after it is cooked for 3 minutes. If you don't you will end up with soggy broccoli. Have made it several times with rave reviews

I made this for Thanksgiving, and it was the hit of the table. We usually make the same dishes every T'giving and Christmas. I wasn't sure how a new dish would be welcomed. As I said, it was a hit and my hubby has even given it the green light to be added to the "usual" menu!

I decided at the last minute to scale down this recipe, as my family typically has plenty of side dishes at Thanksgiving. But all I cut was the amount of broccoli -- in half. I kept the original amount of streusel and cream mixture. Everyone willing to eat broccoli especially loved the abundance of crunchy, mustardy topping. When I make it again, I will increase the mustard-cream mixture by half, since the broccoli soaked it up and still was just a little dry.

My family realy liked this...even three non-broccoli eating kids. It wasn't mushy at all, and I realy despise mushy veggies. Just make sure you only boil the broccoli for the three minutes called for and then run it under cold water to stop the cooking. We'll definately have this again.

by boiling the broccoli, then baking it, it was more than the broccoli could stand. The flavor was good, consistancy of the broccoli was mush. Try not pre-cooking first.
