My girlfriend literally devoured this entire dish! A few comments though: 1) I used a deep frier, since I didn't have a wok, and it worked out spectacularly... I suspect that might be even easier than trying to fry the shrimp in the wok! 2) I didn't have sea salt, so I used regular salt - I'm not sure if that's the reason, but the dish came out on the saltier side of delicious. When I make the recipe again I'll probably cut it down a bit. 3) For those of you who can't find Chinese 5-spice, it's a mixture of cinnamon, anise, fennel, ginger, clove, and licorice root. (I know, that's 6 spices. Don't ask.)

Sorry, folks, but I can't see how this was simple! The clean-up alone is taking days (for the hot oil smell to dissipate). I also found it time-consuming to prepare the shrimp, and kind of scary to deep fry. And in the end, there was something very odd about the flavor -- maybe it was the Chinese Five Spice, or maybe the fact that I had to use some peanut oil mixed with the veg oil because I didn't have six cups on hand. By the way, six cups seemed like overkill. Did I do things wrong or just not like this recipe?

So good, once you eat one you can't stop. I substituted the five spice powder with chinese chili oil and brought it to a potluck. It was the first dish to go.

I have made this dish twice in the last few weeks. Everybody loves it. It is also very easy if you buy shrimp already deveined. However, a few observations. I love salt, but found this to be too salty. Keeping the oil at 400 is also very important, and between batches you do need to wait a while for the temperture to go back up. Don't rush this step if you want to get the shells realy crisp. And last, but not least, smaller shrimp, which are also a lot cheaper, worked better than the big shrimp, and were more fun to munch on.

Made this as one of several appetizers for a NY eve party. It was a HUGE hit! I used a combo of black peppercorns and had Szechwan peppercorns, also a dash of fleur de sel and a pinch of sugar. Also sprinked sliced scallions at the end for a little color. I have had this in Chinese restaurants and loved it so now I plan to make it again and again! Most people ate them shells and all except for the tail itself. Faboulous and fast and easy.

I actually have been making salt and pepper shrimp long before I even saw this recipe. (Comes from being Chinese) I noticed the note on the SzeChaun pepper. While it's unfortunate that it's banned from the US for now, try ground white pepper for a little different flavor. I also tend to use white more than black pepper in Chinese dishes because that's just what I grew up with.

i live in chinatown, nyc- this is one of the first asian dishes i've made for myself and its SO SIMPLE! i agree with the chef below to cook shrimp in the spice a bit longer- also this is the second time i've made this and after i fry the shrimp i mix the spice in a bowl with the shrimp before i put them back in the wok- the spice seems to cover easier and doe not seem to stick or begin to burn in the wok as it did the first time

easy, fast and good. Good shrimp in oil and spices a little longer. Next time, add more spices and cook in spice longer too. also, maybe pull shells back a bit more so spices seep into shrimp.

This was surprisingly good and had a unique taste to it! Not only that, they'r equite pretty when done. I don't know how anyone could get "bland" out of all the seasoning.

it wasn't bad, but i can't say it was good, either. it struck me as being a little on the bland side but when i thought about increasing the amount of seasoning, i knew we'd lose the flavor of the shrimp entirely...
