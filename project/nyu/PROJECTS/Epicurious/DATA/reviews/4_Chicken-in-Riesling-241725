I used boneless breasts of chicken and chardonnay wine instead of riesling and this was fantastic! Love the sauce. Definite keeper!

I omitted the potatoes because I was making a scalloped potato recipe already. Yes, the chicken was boring by itself. But with the other ingredients, it was most and tasty. Next time, I would marinate the chick overnight in some spices. I did add fresh minced garlic as well. Was well received.

Excellent meal. So glad I ignored the bad reviews. I made this meal for one, so I cut the recipe in half. I did add a teaspoon of poultry seasoning and topped the meal off with a little asiago/parmesan/romano cheese. Will most defiantly make this again. Loved it !!

Made this with 3 lbs of chicken breasts (cut in two), drumsticks and thighs and added shredded garlic scapes and a few thyme springs. It was tasty and easy, but was much more liquidy than I expected based on the picture and the chicken skin was flabby. I think the chicken needs browning to a deep golden color for longer than the 10 minutes the recipe called for. Also, only cooking the amount of chicken that will fit in one layer in your pot would help it cook more evenly. The vegetables released quite a lot of liquid in the oven, diluting the flavor of the sauce. Also, it seemed like a lot of potatoes. It's a good one pot meal, but I'd probably just make Gourmet's regular coq au vin blanc next time.

I agree with the previous reviewer... big disappointment. Bland and tasteless.

Disappointing! This was very bland. I used boneless chicken and reduced the cooking time. It still came out overcooked. I don't think you should add the chicken when you are boiling the liquid to reduce it. If I ever try this again, I would reduce the liquid first, then add the chicken; and add some spices.

Tripled and made for a dinner party. Came out really well and was enjoyed by all. Though I do think there was more cream that I personally care for so next time, I'll probably cut the cream in half.

Wow. Such an elegant and simple meal. A perfect dish to serve in the Spring. The only change I made was I roasted my potatoes using duck fat and then served them along side the chicken and juices. Delicious and a meal I will make again and again.

Possibly my favorite way to prepare chicken. Easy enough for a weeknight and distinctive enough for company. I used chicken thighs instead of an entire chicken and really think the dish benefited from their richness.

I made this dish last night and it was just fabulous. I took other reviewer's advice and added a clove of garlic and a handful of mushrooms [I used cremini]. I also added more lemon [we love lemon]. These additions made it bang-on. Take the time to find a good, fruity riesling. It's worth it. We had leftover bbq'd potatoes and with a bit of butter, made those into a "smash" to serve alongside. This dish was unexpectedly deeeelicious!! I'd absolutely serve this to guests and I may just have to do it soon. I'm already craving more!!

One of my all time favorite epicurious recipes. It's sometimes hard to go back to recipes you've tried when there are so many untried ones on the horizon. But Chicken in Riesling? I crave it. It's such an adaptable recipe, too. I've made this true to recipe (ok fine my dry Riesling was from Oregon), but I've also made a "poor man's" version with an onion instead of leeks and shallots, an inexpensive white (not a riesling), and not splurging on the creme fraiche. I'd never claim it tastes the same, but it still hits the right notes. I prefer to use whole mushrooms over the potatoes, but either way it's wonderful.

Rating: 4
AMAZING! Made this for a holiday dinner with my mom and family and it was a definite success. In retrospect, I would have ditched the idea of carving up a whole chick and just bought wings, thighs and breast pieces ready to go. The Riesling gravy was to die for- literally still dreaming about it. Try this recipe!!

I made this for my husband on New Years Eve. He absolutely loved it! Since we both prefer dark meat, I used chicken thighs instead of a whole chicken. I also heavy creme & baby carrots (which I sliced diagnally in half) & added while cooking the leeks & shallots to assure they were tender. This is definately a dish I'll be serving again

I made this dish as directed, but left out the creme fraiche to make it a bit lighter and ate with brown rice instead of potatoes (not as delish, but more healthy :-/). Pretty good. The lemon definitely improved the dish. I can see how some people think this is bland. The flavor was very light and clean, which is how (I think) it's meant to be... but the flavor doesn't really jump out and grab you. I'd definitely make again if I had some reisling in the house, but I'd follow the suggestion of other reviewers and add garlic, lemon zest, tarragon and maybe some fresh thyme.

Outstanding! I made this with onion and garlic instead of leek and shallots, and pasta instead of potatoes since my fiancée hates potatoes. I used boneless chicken breast as well.

Great recipe . . . even if you have to make a few substitution. I thought I had white wine but discovered I didn't after the chicken was underway. So I used sherry in place of the wine. I also added mushrooms when I added the carrots to the recipe. My husband doesn't generally like chicken but even he said it was superb. If I was doing this for company -- and it's certainly company worthy-- I'd use boneless chicken.

Excellent recipe, one of my favorites. I've even substituted green onions for leeks when I couldn't find leeks at the store and the flavor is still superb. I like to use the multicolor fingerling potatoes to add color and I sprinkle on some fresh chopped parsley after it's dished out, otherwise it's pretty even toned.

Rating: 4
I don't understand how anyone can find this bland. As someone who loves spicy and heavily seasoned food, this is one of my favorite chicken dishes. Be sure to use the full 2 cups of leeks and don't neglect the creme fraiche. I double the wine and throw in a bay leaf, tarragon and a few springs of fresh thyme while braising. After braising, I recommend removing the lid and broiling on high for about 10 minutes to crisp the skin. A very easy, stunning meal.

Rating: 3
Absolutely scrumptious!!! Will be making this over and over. But I don't know who epicurious is timing when they come up with their active/total time numbers. Maybe I just don't understand but who can wash & finely chop 4 leeks, butcher a chicken, finely chop shallot and peel and cut carrots in 30min. Not me!! Also the idea you could reduce by half the amount of liquid in 4 minutes is laughable. However, no need for fine chop on the leeks - a rough chop IMO would actually make for a better final texture. Also let the butcher earn his money and cut up the chicken for you. With those changes I would say prep time would be around 30min and total time more like 1hr 15min.

Rating: 4
I have made this several times and agree with the comments about good Riesling and creme fraiche. Generally, I make this dish with chicken thighs, and the only other thing I have added was some fresh tarragon chopped up with the parsley. I love the flavor of tarragon and think it adds an interesting dimension to the existing flavors.

Great recipe, and relatively simple to prepare. Aside from piecing the chicken, there isn't too much labor involved here, which makes this a dish I would probably make again for its simplicity and simple flavors. And though it was definitely flavorsome, is lacked a certain oomph and wow-factor. No changes to note... just decent straight-forward food :)

To all of the cooks who called the receipe bland, please use a high quality Riesling, not the American sweet version. 99% of the German or Alsace Rieslings available in the US would never be drunk by someone from Alsace or Germany, they are sweet, a dry Riesling should never be sweet. Even a "Trimbach" is manufactured specifically for the American export. I have made this recipe many times and it was never bland.

I was so looking forward to making this recipe after reading all the review but found it very bland.

Rating: 4
This is a fantastic dish, a four star by any standard. However, several details are absolutely crucial: You must use creme fraiche--cream, sour cream, our whatever people have been substituting just won't cut it. Use a quality chicken and Riesling (duh). Also, deglaze the pan with a healthy glug of cognac or brandy and add a bouqet garni. Finally, after the chicken is through braising place it on a sheet pan and broil for a few minutes to crisp the skin. This does wonders for the final product.

I made this dish last night with a couple of changes. I had only chicken part thighs, boneless breasts and legs and so I made it with each of those. Also had leeks in the garden but they were small so I did not get the whole amount. Despite that it turned out great. Very tasty and definately a keeper but not an "OMG this is awesome" type recipe. One tip: use really good Riesling.

I just finished cooking and eating...it was delicious! After reading the reviews, I added a few items from another french braised chicken recipe and adjusted the ingredients for two servings. First, I used boneless and skinless thighs, one tblsp olive oil, 2 tblsp butter, one leek, one shallot, 2 garlic cloves, baby carrots, 1/2 btl dry riesling, 1 tblsp basil, 1/3 cup of sour cream mixed with a 1/3 cup of heavy cream, one cup chicken broth and about 1 tblsp of lemon juice. Added rock salt and pepper to chicken. After the braising, I removed the chicken from the pot and allowed the sauce to reduce about 1/2 before adding the cream and lemon, then add the chicken back and serve. This recipe turned out very nice. I think next time I will use less butter, maybe one tblsp and one teaspoon for olive oil. I had to adjust the time for searing the chicken since boneless cooks faster. I think the total cooking time was about 30 to 40 minutes including the added reduction time for the sauce after braising. I served it over rice. I am so full!!

Rating: 4
I pre salted the chicken under the skins and added tiny squares of butter under there too, before I browned them- I also added a little sprinkle of Old Bay Seasoning to the chickens while they were browning ( based on another persons review of the dish being slightly boring) I addes some parsnips which were a huge hit. It's a great dish to make when you want to enjoy your dinner party and not stuck in the kitchen when guests arrive, I made everything ahead of time and put it in the oven when the guests arrived, then added the Cream Fresh etc...and served. Everyone loved it!

Rating: 4
As a beginner cook, I was very impressed with how this turned out. The only changes I made was that I did not use leeks or carrots. I ended up placing a few quartered baby bok choy and fresh mushrooms atop the chicken/Riesling mixture in the pot and let those cook for the duration of 20-25 minutes (I did not pre-cook them per the leek portion of the recipe). The result was tender, wine infused mushrooms and bok choy- I'm not a fan of cooked carrots. I will definitely make this again- it's just me at home, so it will make for a couple of days of delicious leftovers!

Rating: 4
Fantastic and easy recipe! Followed the recipe and used a Chateau St.Michele Riesling and the whole family including the little kids loved it. We served it with a baguette to soak up the delicious sauce. Since we're not big potato fans, I think I'll leave them out next time and serve with either rice or a baguette, but keep the parsley since it adds a nice flavor.

Very, very yummy. I substituted unpeeled baby Yukon Golds, Sauv blanc, and a slightly reduced amount of sour cream instead of crème fraiche, but otherwise stuck to the recipe. Mr H and I agreed it was a great dish. Though I often enjoy heavily seasoned dishes, I found the flavor subtle and satisfying - both spring-y and comfort food-y  rather than bland. I used a pasture-raised chicken and this recipe allowed the richer flavor of the bird to really shine. I took a chance and doubled it as the chicken I used was much bigger than called for, and both of us are looking forward to enjoying the leftovers!

Wow, this recipe was delicious - homey comfort food that tasted great. The whipping cream made a delicious savory gravy. My husband loved it. We used chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken and would do the same next time. The only thing I would change is to leave out the potatoes. I didn't feel like they added much. Next time I'll just do rice on the side. Be sure to serve with a delicious bread to mop up all the delicious savory sauce. We'll definitely make this one again.

Oh yes, this is heavenly comfort food alright, and another chicken dish to add to my absolute favourites. Used all half breasts on the bone with skin, cleavered in half again.

Agree with the lot that this is a great dish for guests/company. Easy enough to prepare and very filling. Though, I changed it around based on what I had. I ended up sauteing the vegetables and sauce on the stovetop whilst a full chicken was roasting in the oven. Once the chicken was about half way roasted I transferred the veg mix to the roasting pan and let them all cook together. And I skipped the cream fraiche so it was just a wine based sauce. Also added the button mushrooms and extra lemon. Served it with mashed potatoes, lemony garlic string beans, and riesling wine. It was a little "autumnal" for March but maybe that had more to do with what I served with it. You could play around with that.

Rating: 3
Very good. Used Chablis instead of Riesling, heavy cream instead of cream fraiche, added a *few* cloves of garlic, probably added 1/2 cup (at least) of parsley. Half of the potatoes were peeled - then I got lazy. Otherwise, made as described. The estimated cooking/prep times were bang on. Actually, there wasn't too much prep work at all - started and finished all my chopping/peeling during the time (20 min) the chicken was browning.

Great and easy recipe. We did not cut the chicken "French style" because we couldn't figure out how to do it, even after consulting Julia Child's cookbooks. I also used light heavy cream in an attempt to cut some of the calories.

I was looking for something new to try out on some friends who were coming to dinner. I knew that I wanted to make a chicken dish and after a quick search, I decided on this one. I am so glad that I did! This dish was absolutely delicious, and easy to prepare as well. I decided to use thighs and drumsticks only and I also added mushrooms to the pot when I added the carrots.

I made this last night--it was delicious. I had two friends over and they both wanted seconds. I used more wine and more lemon juice than the recipe calls for, and I added sauteed white mushrooms before braising--an excellent addition. I used chicken thighs, Alsatian riesling, and regular table cream. The leeks nearly disappeared in the lovely, rich sauce. I served it over linguine. Wonderful--I will make this again when I want to IMPRESS. Great recipe!

I made this recipe for two, using a cut-up half a free-range chicken, (I included the back for flavor and pulled it out before serving), 1 leek, two shallots, big chunks of carrot,(skipped the potatoes) a cup of leftover chardonnay, two sprigs of thyme and a little cream and chopped parsley at the end. Divine! Classic french at it's best! I served it with rice. Using good quality chicken is key here.

This turned out beutifully, with a few modifications. After browning the chicken and sauteing the leeks and shallots, I layered the chicken, the baby carrots, the unpeeled potatoes, and the leek and shallot mixture in a cast iron covered braiser and baked it at 300 degrees for about two hours, adding the creme fraiche and the lemon juice at the end of the cooking time. This left me free to spend time with my guests, and gave me a lovely one- dish meal to bring to the table.

The only thing that prevented me from giving this four forks is the inconvenience of having to cut the meat off the bone the first time you serve it. I always do that before putting the leftovers away, and enjoy it more the second time. The sauce is wonderful. You might try steaming the carrots a bit ahead.

I have made this recipe multiple times. It is a comforting dish with great flavor. My favorite aspect of this dish is its simplicity and every ingredient stands on its own while melding well together. The first time I made this dish I used a whole chicken. Since then I have used thighs and legs.

This is a wonderful recipe. I was doubtful when I first made it for my picky husband, but he loves it, and has requested it for Xmas dinner. The only thing I do differently is to use dry vermouth instead of riesling. Hubby likes it that way, maybe one of these days I will try the riesling. Also, if creme fraiche is not available where you live (like me) homemade (2tbs buttermilk with one cup of whipping cream, and you need to place it in a warm place for at least 12 hours) works wonderfully. The addition of this fat seems to make the dish lighter. Wish me luck @ Xmas, when I told my daughter we were having chicken, she was obviously disappointed, but I am hoping this dish will change her mind about the little bird. I would rather have this moist, lovely chick than a boring turkey anyday (and I am!!).

For me, this deserved 3 forks but my husband would definitly give it 4. He wanted it again for Christmas Eve but he's not going to get it! (I'll be make the Cornish game hens with thyme and double cranberry sauce, from this site). I used chicken thighs with bone and skin. The skin browned so nicely but turned grey, soft and yucky after being in the oven. I'm conflicted about how to do it next time...whether to use skinless thighs or to remove the skin after cooking. I'm afraid using the skinless would affect the flavor. I didn't peel the potatoes and didn't feel they needed it. One change I would make is to use larger (and less expensive) red potatoes and just quarter them. I used baby carrots and they were perfectly done when the chicken was. I do plan to try this recipe again.

I made this chicken dish using a Washington State Riesling. My supermarket in the country didn't carry crème fraîche so I just used the heavy cream. I also forgot parsley and used dried instead. And just a cut-up chicken (but split up the breasts). Oh, I also forgot the little potatoes so I just cut up some larger ones. Despite these substitutions, It was still earned four forks! I cooked it while by myself just to see how it would taste--but I'll definitely make it again for my family!

Like other reviewers mentioned, the carrots and chicken were not cooked at the end of the 20 - 25 minutes. It took 40 minutes for the chicken, but the carrots still weren't done. I would recommend tossing them in with the leeks and shallots or cutting them into smaller pieces if they are on the larger size to make sure they are cooked. Honestly, it tasted more like a good base for a potato leek soup.

Made this recipe for a small dinner party at my house and thought it was delicious. I even forgot to add the cream! Didn't realize it until we were almost done but I almost preferred it without. Used crusty bread to soak in the broth. I also didn't think this was too much work at all. In fact, it was nice to do a "one-pot" meal and just cut up some bread. It was all we needed! I will definitely make it again and again.

I tried this recipe twice, once withe a whole (butterflied) chicken and once with boneless skinless breasts and boneless skinless thighs. The whole, butterflied chicken was amazing beyond compare--sauce was rich, creamy and zippy with the lemon juice and zest. A most definite four forks. The boneless skinless version was a major disappointment, probably one fork. Definitely bland. So, do yourself a huge favor and unless dietary restrictions prohibit, make this with chicken that has bones and skin. You can always remove the skin after you cook it.

I've been meaning to try this recipe since it appeared in Gourmet last year - and I'm so glad I finally did. What a delicious combination! I left the skin on the potatoes, and also added a splash of Riesling to the sauce at the end (3-4 Tbsp) along with the lemon juice to brighten it up a bit. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I combined this recipe with the "Chicken, Mushroom & Leek" recipe. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and used Vermouth in place of the Reisling.

A from Oakland, if you got that many leeks you probably used the green parts, and if your carrots were not cooked, something went wrong. If it was bland, it probably needed more salt. This is one of the more delicious recipes chicken I have had (when done properly.) Highly recommended.

I agree with the reviewers who said that this recipe is too much effort for a very bland result. I'm perplexed by all the wonderful reviews. I won't be making this again.

Made it as written except for adding mushrooms and using half-and-half in lieu of heavy cream. Delicious, but time-intensive. I was on my feet for 90 minutes, chopping, cutting up the chicken, doing the initial browning in two batches, prepping the potatoes . . . Cooked it in the oven for 40 minutes and the carrots were still undercooked. I'd recommend presteaming them a bit. If I make this again, I'm going to use chicken parts.

I made this with heavy cream and used baby carrots and fingerlings. It was delicious! Next time I would use sour cream or more lemon juice. The addition of a bay leaf sounds good too. This recipe is a keeper and I can't wait to make it for company.

Good treatment of chicken--a little bland at first, but some more lemon and a splash of cognac vinegar deepened the flavor. I deboned the leftovers and turned those into stock. The leftover chicken and veggies tasted much better the next day. Not a showstopper, but certainly a good weeknight meal.

Very good and a bit different. I made it as is and my whole family liked it - including 2 of my 16 year old son's friends who ended up crashing for dinner. Not a lot of work - except for peeling the little potatoes. I will try with noodles next time since my son thinks everything is better with noodles!

This recipe was delicious. I followed the recipe as written and loved every bite. As others stated, I also added more carrots, steamed fingerling potatoes, and made my own fraiche. Lemon juice is a must. Definitely a keeper.

I made this for my family last night. I was underwhelmed. The chicken was nice and moist but the sauce was really bland. I even added some sour cream and upped the lemon, etc. when I tasted it, but nobody wanted extra sauce. Very disappointing.

This recipe was wonderful. I made it on Saturday for my boyfriend and I and made it on Sunday for my parents; just to share the goodness. Everyone loved it, the sauce is simply amazing. It certainly isn't a throw it in a pot and go type of recipe, but it's worth the little bit of extra effort.

This was delicious! I used the driest Reisling I could find on the spur of the moment (which was Yellow Tail). You definitely need something to sop up the sauce, like slices of baguette!

Great recipe, I will definitely make it again! I used heavy cream instead of the creme fraiche so if it tastes better when made with the creme fraiche I will be even more impressed. The chicken becomes very moist and really soaks up the flavours. I did find it a bit time-consuming to make but that was partly because I doubled the recipe.

Rating: 4
Wonderful dish. I added about a cup more Riesling and all the leeks, carrots, shallots I could muster. Also after pulling it out of the oven to add the cream and potatoes, I mixed them in and put it back in the oven for about 10 minutes. I plan on making it again and perhaps adding some dill next time!

I also found this recipe in Gourmet Magazine in March. It is the best recipe I have ever found in a magazine. As far as other reviews saying not worth the work, well I guess it is a matter of personal taste. I own two restaurants and went to culinary school and I think it's simplicity is its genius. It does take some time to prepare and that is why it is perfect for those who love to cook. Everyone who I have made it for has asked for the recipe. It is definitely the kind of dish to prepare for those you love on a Sunday night.

This recipe is why I bought the March edition of Gourmet (of course now I see it on epicurious and am kicking myself!). It is fantastic. I've made it twice, without any modifications to the recipe, for dinner parties and it is a HUGE hit.

I've made this dish several times and it's absolutely delicious. As I've usually made this for just two people, I've not yet used a whole chicken. It has, however, worked out just great with both chicken thighs (with skin and bone), and boneless and skinless chicken breasts. I like the addition of mushrooms and rosemary, and agree with the comments regarding the necessity of adding the creme fraiche and lemon. Super yummy!

Rating: 4
I absolutely love this dish. I've made it a few times, and each time it has been delicious. It also reheats well. I use Trimbach Riesling, and random chicken pieces (bone-in, skin-on) if I can't find a pre-butchered whole bird. Definitely a crowd pleaser, and a perfect one-pot dish for a chilly night.

I made this with skinless, boneless chicken breasts, but otherwise followed the recipe. It'd not bad, but it's also not really worth all the work. Very edible, but also very disappointing.

This recipe is the reason I finally became a member of Epicurious...I just had to review it! This is one of my favorite recipes of all time, and I'm sure I will make it many times in the years to come. I've made it three times so far and it gets a little quicker and easier every time. It's well worth the effort if you stick to the basic recipe and don't skip ingredients--the lemon juice and the cream are essential! (Half-and-half works for the cream, though). My husband loves this dish and my guests raved, too. To save time, don't bother peeling the potatoes and buy chicken parts, not a whole chicken. If it's just family, serve with crusty bread and nothing else. Perfect Sunday dinner. Enjoy!

Recently laid off Citbank employee so I cut some costs: I used Gallo Chardonnay, I skinned the chicken to reduce fat, only used two leeks (store was out), no scallions and used 1/2 & 1/2., only 1 T butter and roated unpeeled red potatoes in a seperate dish. Very good. I de-boned the leftovers. Agree with previous review; sauce is so good, DOUBLE IT!!

Rating: 0
This dish was a hit at my house. I used thighs and drumsticks, no breasts and the meat was very moist and juicy. I did not do the potatoes. Instead, I roasted red potatoes to serve as a side....very tasty with the sauce. Great as leftovers too. Will certainly make again.

Rating: 4
I skipped the creme fraiche and it was still a lovely dish. Much more than the sum of its parts. One note - if you cook the potatoes together with the chicken in the oven, be sure to add them to the pot before you bring everything to a boil. Otherwise, it will add about 20 minutes to your cooking time in the oven.

Rating: 4
Much better and much easier than we thought when we first read the recipe. We've read the many reviews and learned from them. The first time we made the recipe we used potatoes, and the second time we omitted the potatoes and served the chicken over basmati rice - we much preferred the rice. Next time we will double the sauce, including the leeks, in order to have plenty for the rice. I've been cooking for over 45 years, and never heard about how to "French cut" a chicken - loved it, especially cutting the breasts in half.

Rating: 3
I gotta say this was ALOT of work and took awhile for it just to be OK. I can't say that I would make it again due to how long it takes and how labor intensive it was. Next time just put chicken in a roasting pan and call it a day. Tasted good.

Rating: 4
This dish is fantastic! Instead of the added step of boiling the potatoes, I put them in with the chicken (adding a bit of chicken stock for additional liquid). I added dried parsley and a little dried thyme to the liquid before putting it into the oven. I also used boneless, skinless chicken breasts for less fat and calories. This will be a one pot wonder for the entire winter!!

Fantastic. This is simplicity at its best. Not only do all of the ingredients go well together, but you can taste each one come through beautifully. On top of it all, this is a complete meal. No need for anything else except maybe some bread to sop up the juice and a nice crisp white wine.

This is fabulous. I was tired of chicken until I tried this recipe. It is fun to make and truly reminded me of the French countryside.

My 5 year old son and I made this last night. He peeled the carrots and potato and helped mix in wine etc. We didn't have the reisling but used another dry white wine and I didn't plan this meal ahead so I didn't have leeks so I used a yellow onion instead with the shallot. I turned off the oven to keep it warm about an hour until we were ready for dinner. The chicken was wonderfully tender. We had a baguette which was great for soaking up the sauce. My son is usally a picky eater ate everything up. We all loved it.

Rating: 4
Easy and tasty. Perfect for a casual Sunday dinner. I heated up heavy cream the night before, added a Tbs or so of buttermilk and let the cream sit over night in a jar on the counter. Inexpensive creme fraiche or crema. I also used the white wine that I had on hand which was a sauvignon blanc. Next time I'll get a riesling. Don't forget the lemon. I served this with a big green salad w/ a mustartd vinaigrette, sourdough bread, and peaches for dessert.

I made this recipe the first time for vry sophisticated diners and it was a smashing success. The recipe did not indicate that it could sit a bit and be rewarmed. It rewarms as well as any stew.

For all the time it took to make this dish, I expected better. The chicken didn't turn out bad, per se -- it just wasn't anything special. It might be due to the fact that I used heavy cream, rather than creme fraiche. I'd be willing to try it again using the real deal.

Excellent, sophisticated and delicious. Actually did not add the cream because I did not have any on hand. The dish was still creamy even without the cream. Made it for a dinner party and got rave reviews. No leftovers.

I used 3 lbs of boneless, skinless chicken thighs, which worked well. After I had braised the chicken (for about 40 mins) I lowered my oven to the 'warm' setting and kept in the oven covered for another two hours (solely for convenience to keep it hot for dinner which was a few hours away). When I took it out after 2 hours, the leeks and shallot had completely dissolved into the sauce, reducing the color of the overall dish but more than making up for it in the flavor of the sauce, which was amazing. The chicken fell apart (to an almost stew- like consistency) but was so incredibly flavorful and moist. I used heavy cream, and probably only about 1/4 cup, because that's all I had - but would not add more the next time. 1/4 cup was perfect for bringing the sauce together without making it too heavy. Also, I did not boil the potatoes, but halved them and steamed them in their jackets, which helped them hold their texture. Lastly, given the simple ingredients in this recipe, if you use the highest quality items you can find (organic chicken & vegetables, and a great wine that you would enjoy drinking by the glass) - I really don't think you will be disappointed in this dish. I would imagine that a sweeter Riesling could impart a very different flavor, so always taste wine before you cook with it to make sure it suits your personal taste. If you don't like it out of the bottle, chances are you will like it even less when you cook with it. Enjoy!

This was so good! I found the braising process took longer than 20-25 minutes though. Carrots would have been undercooked otherwise.

My entire family, including two small children, liked this dish. The prep was manageable, tho I must have had huge leeks because two of them made more than 3 cups chopped. I didn't chop the leeks as fine as was called for, and I did flour the chicken before browning as another reviewer suggested. Also added a few sprigs of rosemary along with the wine. I didn't think the sauce was terribly thin, and the taste was fabulous.

Delicious and easy. I didn't have leeks and used mushrooms instead which worked out just fine.

Rating: 4
Amazingly tasty, considering the whole sauce is basically Riesling and creme fraiche. Baby carrots and unpeeled fingerling potatoes make this much easier than you'd think. I left the skin on but did not cover the dish while braising, and the skin remained crispy while the sauce reduced nicely. I'll definitely make this one again - but you must use creme fraiche, not heavy cream. It makes all the difference.

The only change I made was using herbes de provence in place of parsley (didn't have any). My French bf LOVED this recipe! I also had a fresh baguette on hand, which he used to clean every last drop of the sauce from his plate. Definitely a keeper!

I followed this recipe more closely than some. I had to get a strangle hold on myself not to add some thyme or something, and I was glad I didn't. The changes were chicken thighs and drums, and half and half instead of cream, which I cooked down a little at the end. This was just yummy!!

I agree with the reviews regarding the weak consistency of the sauce. Nothing about this dish was memorable, except that the chicken was very moist. A very high quality wine might have improved the flavor, but I'll most likely save myself the money and the trouble and just roast chicken next time.

Pretty bland. The sauce is definitely too thin and chicken is more cooked than braised so you end up with sort of chicken soup. Do not cover during braising would be my advice.

Rating: 3
I thought this was a very good recipe, though I did make some modifications. After reading comments about the thinness of the sauce, I coated the chicken with seasoned flour prior to browning--I think the flour residue had a slight thickening effect. I also added a generous quantity of mushrooms and extra leeks (one of my favourite flavour combinations) and a couple of pinches of herbes de Provence. Served with a crusty herb bread, it was lovely stuff, and even better as leftovers.

Rating: 3
Easy recipe. I doubled the wine and added broth to increase the sauce and added mushrooms. I browned chicken thighs then pulled off skin and tossed it. I let it sit in fridge for 2 days before eating. Delicious! Served it over mashed potatoes rather than adding boiled new potatoes. Wanted something to soak up that wonderful sauce!

Excellent. I increased everything I liked (wine, shallots, leeks, carrots) and added mushrooms. Also removed skin from chicken first. Weeknight meal so I just used dried parsley and cream-- I'm sure would be even better with fresh parsley and creme fraiche.

Good but not "to die for". The carrots did not seem to cook thoroughly during the braising, and the sauce was a little thin for my taste. I'll try it again but with modifications.

This was very good, and was very easy to make (not sure why some reviewers indicated it took so long...). I did everything to the letter, except for the quantity of chicken since I was making this for two and because I didn't have a pot big enough. I left vegetable quantities the same and used ~2#s thighs and drumsticks. Next time I will also reduce the potatoes down to a little less than a pound. The sauce is delicious - especially with the leeks. I used creme fraiche after reading the other reviews, and I have to agree - it makes the dish. Don't forget the Italian parsley - also a must-have. I used unpeeled fingerling potatoes.

I knew from the second I saw this in the magazine a) that it would be delicious and b) that I was going to love it. We used cream instead of cream fraiche and it was delicious. It made so much I had it for 2 days for lunch afterward, and I think it got better with age. I'd only suggest putting in more carrots (if you like the carrots) because they're delicious. I won't say more. I'll just keep saying it's delicious.

I was actually astonished at how terrific this was - we rarely have chicken for a dinner party but one guest had diet restrictions. Ooh la la! We used Chateau St. Michelle dry riesling and cream, since I used up the creme fraiche making the pear & almond tart (March 08 Gourmet). Using baby carrots was also a good idea. We made 1 1/2 times the recipe and had plenty for 6 adults with leftovers.

This was pretty good. By the spoonful, the sauce was totally divine, but with the veggies and chicken, it lacked enough spark and did not seem to pull everything together. Also, we did not have enough sauce, so I would make more, and concentrate it, and perhaps add a bay leaf or some thyme or something. I used part cream and part creme fraiche, but would use all creme fraiche next time. The potatos were tasty, but I couldn't really taste the parsley in the meal, which was a shame, maybe more? Certainly more leeks, and maybe not cut up so tiny, jeez. This is too much work for a weeknight meal (not hard, just more time consuming than it looks for sure!), but yet lacks the punch or wow factor for company. Oh yes, and I would cook it without the lid, so the chicke is crisper instead of soggy. That said, everyone seemed very pleased with the dish. It is a subtle, sophisticated comfort food item, but one that could certainly be improved.

Rating: 4
This is an absolutely fabulous recipe. Even though this was easy to prepare, I knew I would be rushed for time on the day I planned to serve it, so I went as far as completing the braising of the chicken and put it in refrigerator overnight. The next day, I boiled the potatoes and added the crème fraîche and final ingredients. Suggested presentation: Large shallow bowls with wide rim, sprinkle entire dish with chopped parsley and black pepper. Voila! It was delicious and the leftovers were even better. My husband is already asking when I will make this again.

This was delicious. I used cream and about half a lemon. I'm sure the creme fraiche whould have been marvelous, but I didn't have it in the fridge. I also used baby yukon gold potatoes and did not peel - tender and delicious. BTW... the kids (4 & 5) liked it as much as we did.

This was fabulouso! I didn't have my reading glasses on and thought it said "preferably Australian" on the wine instead of "Alsatian". I used Yellow Tail Australian Reisling, which is dry, crisper and not as sweet as Alsatian Reisling, and it still came out great! Instead of peeling and cooking the potatoes separate, I just threw them into the dutch oven with everything else. (Used chicken thighs, skin off) I didn't bother putting this in the oven, just simmered, covered over low flame for about 1-1/2 hours. Used the creme fraiche...it's what makes this dish "pop", also the splash of lemon juice. Simple, delicious, elegant.

This recipe is so easy to make with such a delicious outcome. The changes I made were small. I used chicken thighs and legs since that is what I had on hand. I also did not use a riesling, instead I used a white blend that was already open. I also did not add the potatoes since I served it over rice. I think the creme fraiche is a must. My husband and I loved it and it will be a regular dinner in our house.

This dish was very delicious! I think next time I will use even more leeks (they were very good) and perhaps after browning the chicken I will remove the skin. My only complaint was that the sauce wasn't as thick as I would have liked. I don't know if I didn't reduce the wine enough or if that is just how the sauce is supposed to be. Any suggestions? I also used Chateau St. Michele Dry Riesling which was excellent, especially for the price!

This recipe was excellent. I cook only for my boyfriend and myself so I halved the recipe - it turned out very well. The only thing I did differently was that I didn't peel the baby potatoes - the skin was so thin and I can never be bothered peeling baby potatoes - there is no point as the skin is so tender that it makes no real difference to me. It was still great. A nice, lighter alternative to the more common and heavier red wine coq au vin and perfect for late winter/early spring when you still want something sustaining but want to start having less heavy food.

This recipe is delicious!!!Even the picky kids LOVED it! Made exactly to the recipe, and I can see where the creme fraiche is essential...added amazing flavor! I used a viura/sav blanc wine blend instead of riesling (all I had on hand).And by the way, EASY to make, just pre-chop the shallots, leeks and parsley. Great comfort food...very yummy.(I think this recipe can feed 5 people easy.)

This was terrific. I used heavy cream (not creme fraiche) and didn't think it negatively affected the taste. It's nice to have an alternative to the usual coq au vin made with red wine. Read my full review at www.spoonforknyc.blogspot.com.

I added a tub of mushrooms and sauteed them to remove their moisture before adding the leeks and shallots, and also added 4 rosemary springs when adding the wine. I also used creme fraiche since I like its flavor. I thought the sauce was a little too watery so either the mushrooms added too much liquid, or I didn't boil down the wine mixture enough. If that happens next time I'll add some beurre manie if necessary to thicken. Also, thin skinned tiny potatoes really don't need to be peeled. Very tasty one pot dish.

I read the reviews and went to a specialty to store to buy the creme fraiche. I believe it made all the difference. The combination of the chicken, potatoes, sauce, and carrots was great. It did take quite a bit of prep time, but it was worth it. Next time I'll add more potatoes and carrots (and use baby carrots instead).

EXCELLENT! I do love stews, so this recipe was destined to become a favorite. I didn't add potatoes, but rather served the coq au vin on a starch (grits). I also threw in some fennel. As several reviewers have noted, creme fraiche definitely adds to the flavor, as does a squeeze of lemon. We enjoyed it with an insanely fruity Gruner-- a match made in heaven. YUM! I will certainly make this again.

Not as quick as some might lead you to believe.. I had a second person chopping my leeks and shallots, and start to finish this still look a good hour and a half, possibly longer. Those baby potatoes are a PAIN to peel! Very delicious though, sop up the sauce with a nice rustic bread. It's too good to let any go to waste!

Excellent! Made this exactly as written. Very french, very delish. Must use the creme fraiche though -- you can taste the slight sourness coming from the creme fraiche that you would lose with the heavy cream. Also, I used baby carrots (so not exactly as written, I confess) without any incident.
