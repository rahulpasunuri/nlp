My mother has been making this for as long as I can remember - Maybe 35 years or better and although this was very good, I prefer her version with coffee ice cream.

I made this recipe this last weekend and absolutely adored it. Thought the flavor combination was fabulous and look forward to making them again soon. Great presentation and looks much more complicated than it is. They were a hit !!!!

This is a refreshing dessert for adults. Served after a small dinner gathering or after a night out to the movies with friends, it is the perfect nightcap. Very well suited for the summer months. Easy to make.
