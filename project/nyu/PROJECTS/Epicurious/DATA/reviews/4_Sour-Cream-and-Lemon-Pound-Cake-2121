I used Meyer lemons, but since I like a "lemony" taste, I increased the juice to almost 3/4cup and tripled the zest (soaked in juice). I made 2 loaves and added a thin Meyer lemon glaze. The texture was good, moist (even better the next day). But, there was a bit of an "eggy" taste. I will reduce the eggs next time to 5 (or maybe even 4). The sour cream I think is essential!

I have only one word for this cake recipe: YUM!!! After years of searching for a pound cake recipe that could come close the outrageously good pound cakes made from scratch by my southern relatives, I was delighted to have finally found one; this is a rich, dense and super moist cake. I made if for the first time this Thxgiving (with lemons from the tree in my own front yard) and it was awesome. Can't wait to try it without the lemon as a plain butter pound cake.

Basic lemon pound cake. I used the juice of 2 large lemons - I also used the lemon bits from the juicing - I think it added the extra zing. Used all of the zest too from the two lemons. I don't like to waste and one or two extra tablespoons of juice/zest doesn't hurt. Made a simple lemon juice/powdered sugar glaze. Crumb is very fine and lighter than traditional pound cake, but still delicious. Baked it in 2 loaves - baking time 1 hr. 10 mins.

I made this cake today in loving memory of my partner's grandmother. I must say, it was divine! It brought back so many memories for me as a child, as well as, made a wonderful desert to your small dinner. I recommend this recipe to anyone who like to make cakes for special occasions.

we baked this yummy cake and it was our best cake. We used twice as much lemon juice + lemon rind, and less sugar, and we used whole milk yogurt instead of sour cream.

Followed other reviewers advice and doubled the lemon juice and zest ( also soaked the zest in the lemon juice for 10 min.). Reduced sugar by 1/2 a cup. Had rave reviews at work. Everyone thought the cake had a very fresh and clean lemon taste. Had requests for the recipe. Will make it again. A great Easter cake.

Wow! This cake is fantastic! I didn't have cake flour, so used 1C-2T of regular flour, and then I sifted it. The texture is wonderful and the lemon flavor is just right. I made this to go with a trifle, but am so glad that I won't have to use it all so we can enjoy it on its own. It's the perfect spring fix!

Lesson # 1: Do NOT under any circumstances, place large Channukah (because you cannot find birthday) candles in the cake when it's only been out of the oven for 15 minutes. DUH!!! My fat Channukah candles melted into the caked and infused the surrounding area with wax. GROSS! I was lucky that I had some straws that are beveled and are about a half inch diameter and I was able to dig the wax out (which left huge craters) flip the cake over and re-glaze the other side. What was I thinking???? As for the cake - AMAZING!! I made the following changes: 1.75 - 2 cups sugar (because I glazed it) 3 TBSP meyer lemon zest, a little over .25 cup meyer lemon juice. I like SUPER lemony cake and this wasn't lemony enough for me but it was still really, REALLY good. The texture was amazing. I used King Arthur Cake flour this time (versus Softasilk) and it was FAR superior to the latter. Texture, crumb, everything. I make a lot of cakes.... I baked for 1 hr 15 minutes and it was just a hair underdone but the cake tester came out clean. But I'd rather err on the side of underdone than over - dry cake is NASTY. I also dusted the pan with flour and super fine sugar and boy the outer texture - CRAZY! YUM!! I glazed with a meyer lemon (we have a zillion on our tree now) and rose water glaze. About 2-3 cups powdered sugar and almost a TBSP rose water (I like Sadaf brand) and the rest meyer lemon juice to get the texture I want. I like to glaze the cake while it's still hot - makes for an interesting texture when the cake cools. The hint of rose was astounding. I raise hens for eggs and our eggs' yolks, with these winter grasses are the brightest orange you can imagine so the cake had this deep, rich, yellow color and the taste was great. The sour cream really makes a difference. YUM YUM YUM!!! In the summer I will make this with regular old lemons, use all the sugar and serve with berries and fresh, unsweetened whipped cream. (Strauss, of course)

good cake... i used the zest of 2 lemons (looked like about 3 Tb.). was not as dense as regular pound cakes but i really didnt miss the density. ended up dusting the pan with sugar and a little bit of flour, added a nice texture on the outer edge of the cake. i used the glaze from ina garten's lemon cakes (about 4 Tb. lemon juice and 2 cups powdered sugar... i added some zest). poured the glaze over the cake while it was still warm... a really delicious summer cake!!!!

I used AP flour, sifted 3 times, reduced the sugar to 1 1/4 cups, replaced the peel with 1/4 cup lemon zest, added 1 tsp. baking powder for a lighter cake, and I reduced the baking time to an hour. The result...absolute perfection!

This is nice cake, would make a great base for fresh berries. Per suggestions, I added more zest (about 2 tablespoons total) and it had a nice lemon flavor, but not over the top. It was not eggy as some had suggested and I see no reason to reduce the eggs. To the previous reviewer, Anoa. All I can think is that maybe your ingredients were not at room temp, so things did not blend as well as they should. I am an experienced baker and on occasion I have a total failure for reasons I can rarely determine.

I made this cake a year ago and it was fantastic. However this time it was just the opposite which is a first for me. I extended the lemon zest and juice just like I did before. Other than this alteration, everything was according to instruction. I removed it from the oven about 7 minutes earlier than the suggested hour and a half bake time because it looked done to me and passed the tooth pick test. When I cut it I found that about half and inch on the bottom was more like a gummy lemon bar. I don't know if leaving it in the last seven minutes would have made a difference. Pound cakes are my specialty. First time screwed one up. To add insult to injury, the lemon glaze I poured over the top crystalized turning into hard candy that could not be cut with a knife. This is very interesting to me because I felt really good about this cake when I popped it into the oven. I would never had guessed that I would be tossing the entire thing into the trash which is what I did. If anyone has an idea as to why this got so fracked up I'd appreciate your thoughts. Not so much about the glaze but more about the cake.

Absolutely Delicious! I am not crazy for lemon cakes, but one a snowing day as I was stuck in the house I found this recipe and decided to try it. I used regular flour instead of cake flour, salted butter instead of unsalted and key limes instead of lemons. I was a little concerned because I didnt have the exact ingredients, but decided to take the risk anyway. I am so glad I did! This cake is so moist and perfect. I made a key lime glaze and spread it on the cake after it cooled off and it added an extra touch. I am always baking cakes and this one is definitely a keeper!

Easy and tastywhat more could you ask for? I actually used this recipe to make petit fours, so only made 2/3 of the batch and baked it in a 12 x 17 x 1" pan for 35 minutes. Knowing it would be filled with jam, then covered in marzipan and icing, I reduced the sugar proportionately by half. I also doubled the zest for added flavor. Cake came out perfectly moist yet dense enough to withstand splitting into the finest of layers. Simple and wonderful on it's own, and a delight when made into petit fours with blackberry jam and lemon icing.

This is the first Epicurious recipe that has let me down a little. The cake isn't bad, but it didn't knock my socks off, which I was expecting it would do after reading the reviews. I added a little extra lemon zest and juice, based on observations that it needed more lemon, and that was a good idea. But I found the cake quite dry even though I baked it 15 minutes less than called for. The taste was pleasant, not amazing, and the texture was okay but again, not wonderful. Rather than continue to tinker with this one I will keep looking for another lemon pound cake recipe.

Excellent recipe and my new favorite pound cake! I only made a few small changes. Added the zest of 4 lemons (3 heaping tablespoons), added 1 tsp lemon oil and covered the cake with a thick glaze made of powdered sugar and lemon juice. Use a stand mixer and beat for as long as suggested. Terrific texture.

After reading the reviews, I used the zest of 2 lemons and 1 lime and soaked it in the juice of one lemon. I only had a loaf pan, so the recipe made two loafs. I baked it for 60 mins and the cake was perfect. Very moist with just enough hint of lemon. I havn't iced it yet as it just came out of the oven and we couldn't wait to try it. Perfect pound cake and extremely easy to make.

After reading the reviews, I also tripled the zest and added an extra tablespoon or so of juice. I used a basic lemon glaze (a few tablespoons of juice, some zest, and a little over a cup of icing sugar). Even so, I think when I make this again I will use even MORE juice and zest and may try that Cooks Illustrated zest-soaked-in-juice method that someone else mentioned. That said, I think this is as much a personal taste issue as it is an issue with the recipe. The vast majority of the lemon pound cake recipes I've seen use this amount of lemon zest/juice or less. I think other reviewers and I just prefer a more lemony cake.

I needed my go-to cake for a fundraiser and came back here to print out a new copy of the recipe. I browsed down the reviews because I seemed to remember using more lemon juice and zest. I was amused by those whose cakes didn't quite come up to snuff. Then I read further that some are changing ingredients, using less eggs or sugar, evap. milk, etc. A slight tweek such as a little more lemon juice or zest is something most recipes can absorb. But in my opinion, when you start making numerous changes with a recipe you are setting yourself up for disappointment. If your oven bakes hotter than normal like mine (I use an oven thermometer for accuracy) then by all means reduce the time of baking, as do I. When I first try a recipe, I make it as directed. If it doesn't turn out just right, I make the choice of trying it again with slight changes or simply moving on to a different recipe.

The best and now my favorite pound cake!!! I didn't save it when I made it for the first time a few days ago and when searching for it again, I left out the lemon in the title(lousy search engine here, BTW)and it gave me 500 cakes that had nothing to do with pound cakes...finally found it, saved,...Anyway, Perfect in every way and the only change was to reduce the sugar to half, as I always do in my baked goods...everybody likes them better!! Now I am making this recipe into mini muffins. I know it will be great because the first time, I made a sample and it was better than the cake!!!I think sour cream is key to the wonderful texture...will make it again and again.

Wonderful. It's everything I love about pound cake. Beautiful crunchy top, dense and moist inside, with a light and refreshing lemon flavor. Definitely worth the squeezing and grating of lemons, don't cheat with extract. My oven also has it nicely done in 1 hr., 15 minutes. Have made this several times and always receives rave reviews. "Best pound cake ever." Lightly dust with confectioner's sugar.

Very nice cake. I left the lemon juice and zest as in the recipe and the lemon flavor was very subtle but fine for me. I used less sugar, 2 1/4 cup (460 g) and for my own taste could be decreased to 2 cups. I also used creme fraiche instead of sour cream. In my oven was done in 1 hour and 15 minutes.

I love lemony desserts, so I tripled the lemon and the zest, like many reviewers. I also didn't have very much sour cream, so I mixed it with this fresh local cheese (something like a smooth version of cottage cheese, similar to creme fraiche) and I used over a cup of the mixture. Absolutely delicious! I am about to make it again to welcome a visiting friend. I've also made a less lemony version with yogurt for friends who are not as huge lemon fans, and served it with tea. Fabulous.

I did not have sour cream so i substituted it with evaporated milk (I don't believe it made much difference). Used 5 eggs instead of 6. Also added 1 tsp of vanilla extract and 1 tbsp of lemon extract in addition to the lemon peel and juice. i baked it for 1 hr 10 min and it was already dark brown on top but it was nevertheless moist with a nice crumb/texture. Very yummy!

I made this cake for Father's Day. It wasn't overly complicated but still came out really well and impressed everyone. I doubled the amount of lemon juice after reading some other reviews and got a nice, subtle lemon flavor. Definitely use an electric mixer, I didn't have one and now my arms are quite sore. I also iced the cake with homemade lemon icing.

I was really disappointed with this recipe. I took others' suggestions and used 5 eggs and 1/3 cup lemon juice, and found the flavor balance to be good (I also reduced the sugar to 2 1/4 cups). However, instead of the dense, moist texture of a pound cake, mine had a greasy, dry interior (but nice crust). Very disappointing. I baked them in 2 loaf pans, the middles sunk a bit and perhaps I erred on the side of slight overbaking (just a few extra minutes) to compensate. Still, didn't explain the strange texture despite following the method exactly.

For those who want more lemon flavor, you might want to try the following, which is a method I picked up from the Cook's Illustrated Lemon Bundt Cake recipe. Zest 3 lemons and mince the zest (almost to a paste). Juice the lemons, and soak the minced zest in that juice for at least 15 minutes. I put the entire amount of zest and juice in the cake, but you could use less. This makes for a wonderful lemon flavor. The cake would also be great with the Cook's Illustrated glaze, which uses lemon juice, buttermilk and confectioner's sugar. For my first time with the recipe, I simply served the cake with strawberries and blueberries. I thought the texture of this pound cake was spot on. I will definitely make this again.

This is an excellent recipe. I used all purpose flour and meyer lemons from my garden. Even with 1/2 cup of lemon juice it was not overly lemony - I would add more zest next time. I used all 6 eggs and baked in a tube pan. It came out beautiful and crisp on top and was done in 1 hour 15 mins in my oven. I did not use a glaze but would add it next time for a party. It's really an easy cake to make.

Wow. What a great recipe. This will be my new standard for potlucks. Light, moist, and delicious. Easy to make, too. Only change I made was using two loaf pans instead of a tube pan. It was done in about 60 minutes instead of 90. Served it with some homemade mixed berry coulis and whipped cream.

Unlike most, I followed the recipe and didn't reduce anything. However, I did increase some of the seasoning based on other reviews. I don't like a strong lemon flavor so I was content with the subtlety others mentioned. There's nothing worse in my opinion than those bright yellow lemon cakes you get at the store. If I wanted that much lemon I'd go buy one. So, I doubled the lemon juice called for to a half cup (fresh, not bottled), and also added some vanilla. This was still a subtle lemon flavor but the vanilla added a little more depth. If not overbaked, it is moist and spongy. I'm serving this with a raspberry sauce and vanilla custard. The raspberry sauce recipe is also from epicurious -- 2 containers of raspberries (room temp), a quarter cup of raspberry liquor (I used Chambord), 2 teaspoons of lemon juice, a cup of powered sugar, food processed together the strained. It's not terribly thick but will soak nicely into the cake and further enhance the flavor. Berries and lemon marry well together -- raspberries and blueberries too. I'm curious if anyone has put lemon and pears together -- they're in season right now and I have a ton of them sitting on my counter ready to eat!

Yum! I mostly followed the directions and also the advice of some reviews: 5 eggs, tripled the fresh lemon juice & zest. Also, I only had 1/2 cup sour cream, so I suplimented with vanilla yogurt. It was so so delicious! My convection oven only needed to bake it to a golden brown for 1 hour 10 min. But during baking the sugar and lemon crystalized on the crust for a great texture/taste. The inside was so moist! I finished it with berries and a whipped lemon cream (lemon pudding folded with whip cream). Great presentation, perfect summer dessert!

After reading the other reviews, I decided to take some advice. First, I only used 5 eggs (although one of the users suggested just 4). Second, I added a half cup of lemon juice in order to enhance the citrus flavor. I liked the one less egg; I did not like the half cup of lemon juice. It actually needed more! There was no flavor to this cake, although it was quite moist. I baked it in two 8 inch cake pans instead of the tube pan and it only needed to bake for 35 minutes. It was quite good but there really wasn't much flavor. I can't stress it enough how bland this cake was. Next time I make this, I will either add lemon extract for more zing or vanilla for some actual flavor.

I've been looking for the perfect lemon pound cake for weeks, and I have finally found it! This cake has just the right density and texture. And thanks to the sour cream, it was nice and moist. Because I love lemon, I used almost 1/2 c. lemon juice and several tablespoons of lemon zest. I had too much batter to fit in my bundt pan, so I baked the rest as cupcakes (cut the time almost in half) and they came out perfect as well! Fantastic recipe!

I've been searching and testing for the perfect lemon pound cake recipe and this is it! I read the reviews first so based on everyone's advice, I added more zest; it's definitely a must. Lemon glaze is uneccessary to add a more lemony flavor; but because I wanted a nice sheen on the crust, I added a marmalade glaze. This is definitely a keeper and highly recommended for lemon cake lovers!

After perusing the other reviews, I made this with three cups of all-purpose flour (tapped through a wire strainer), the juice of two limes and a meyer lemon (about 1/3 cup), and two sloppy cups of sugar (in which I always keep a half-dozen vanilly beans), and omitted the zest. I baked the batter in two pyrex loaf pans (4.5x8.5 inches), for 1:15. Fresh out of the oven, the cake was a disappointment. While the lemon/lime flavor was lovely, it was still too sweet, and the texture was thin and a little greasy. The next day, however, it was marvelous - dense, rich, and buttery, with just the right amount of sweetness to offset the lime, and a slightly sweeter and crunchy crust on top. I will definitely make this again. And I will let it sit for a day before eating it.

One gloomy Christmas Day in Warsaw eight years ago, oppressed by low-hanging grey clouds and a lack of snow, I made this cheerfully sunshine-yellow cake for my friend, whose birthday it was that day. It was really very nice, lemony and moist - we enjoyed it thoroughly, and I've come back to search the archive for the recipe today so I can make it again, since my old typed-out recipe is somewhere in my Warsaw kitchen, and I am stranded without it here on the other side of the Tatras. I see someone else complained that this recipe was a disappointment: it's clear the person must've done something wrong, because this simple cake harbors nothing but fond (and delicious) memories for me.

Wow, I had high hopes for this cake based on the reviews -- tried it twice because I had messed up the first time. I thought it was too greasy and the texture was just off -- a bit too loose for a pound cake. The only aspect I liked was that the cake baked up with a nice, slightly crisp crust on top, probably because of all the sugar.

I don't know what the problem was with this recipe (or me), but it was a complete disaster. I noticed after that my cake flour was self-rising, so that my have contributed to the absolute failure of this cake. I prepared it according to the recipe, and after an hour when I checked the cake, it had risen and fallen and was a soupy mush. Whatever the problem here, this cake is not worth figuring out. There are ample simple to prepare, delicious pound cake recipes in the world. I used this one, because I didn't want to dig through my recipe files, but I have learned my lesson. Again, the problem may have been the "cake flour" that I used, but I have made many delicious pounds cake that were oh-so-easy to prepare. Don't bother with this recipe.

The texture of the cake was good but I thought it wasn't moist enough and the cake didn't have a strong lemon flavor. To fix that, I added 1/2 cup of powder sugar and 1 1/2 tablespoons of lemon juice and poured it right on the cake top. Before you pour, make sure to poke little holes in the cake so the inside of the cake can absorb the syrup too. It really made a huge difference!

I just made his in a 10 cup star bundt pan. There was more batter than needed for the pan so I baked the rest in a loaf pan and got to try it before I serve it tonight. Wow, this is lemony, well, if you double the lemon zest like I did. I tried it a half hour ago and my mouth is still tingling with lemony-ness. It's not as heavy as i would expect from a pound cake but the texture is very fine which is nice for a pound cake. It's just moist enough. I also decreased the sugar by about 2 tablespoons just because Iread one of the other reviewers' remarks. It's just a matter of personal prefernece. i was going for a lemon zinger taste and I got it. It's still sweet enough, though. This will be dessert for Chicken mole and tamales so the tartness will be very refreshing after the spicy dinner. I've seen alot of commentary about reviewers who review a recipe they changed. Some people don't appreciate them. I do since i often use the suggestions to gauge whether I need to alter the recipe based on my experience with the ingredients and method involved. What also helps are the people who review a recipe based on the recipe exactly as is. Between the two review methods I always end up with a dish that I am satisfied with.

After making this, I threw the recipe out. I thought the taste/flavor was boring, boring, boring. I did not make any changes to the recipe. I LOVE pound cake but I guess I prefer a stronger flavor.

Another old favorite is the maple pound cake found on this site.

This cake had one of the best textures i've ever made, dense but still spongy, and it held the texture great over the few days it lasted, it was on the sweet side however, and lacked any serious lemon kick, I might try to alter it a bit, but will defintitly be making it again!

Very easy, luscious, and a crowd-pleaser. I baked it in a bundt pan, added just a touch more lemon juice and zest, and only cooked it for 1 hour, 15 mins. I'd recommend it for seasoned or novice cooks. A scoop of Ben&Jerry's vanilla is a good accompaniment.

Awesome cake!!! I used all-purpose flour, margarine instead of butter, no lemon zest, half the lemon juice, and a little bit of milk - and it still came out great! I also found that it only took an hour to bake. I served this with blueberry topping: frozen blueberries mixed with blueberry jam and sugar, allowed to sit at room temp. until the berries released juice. The pound cake soaked it up and made it into an incredible desert!

Well I made the cake with All purpose flour instead of cake flour and it came out dry. I personally like dry cake, but if you guys do the same and don't care for dry cake add some more sourcream or milk (about a 1/2 cup more). I also added 1/3 cup of poppyseeds and 1.5 tsp of vanilla. I made a lemon syrup to go along with the cake.(1/2 cup lemon juice with rind and 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar mix well) It was great! I recommend it.

Ditto the cook from Chicago. I would only add that mine cooked in 1 hour 15 minutes, so I recommend checking it after it after about an hour to prevent overbaking.

One of the best pound cakes I've ever made/eaten. Springy, moist, dense, full of flavor. Added a little extralemon juice, but otherwise followed exactly. Big hit.

Great texture - moist and dense. Halved the recipe and used a loaf pan - baking time was just under an hour. Followed some previous reviewers suggestions by doubling the lemon juice and peel and cutting back a bit on the sugar - perfect! Next time will try the glaze that some reviewers have suggested. This recipe is a winner!!

This recipe is good. I did add a glaze of powdered sugar and lemon. Do be careful and watch the oven temperature. My first attempt was totally overbaked in 59 minutes.

I made this cake yesterday and followed the recipe exactly. I found it didn't really take that long to bake, and I think it could benefit from more zest. The texture is wonderful, though, and the cake is much better today! Moist, dense, delicious, although certainly not the best I've made. I need to play around with this one.

Taking the previous advice, I used 2 cups sugar, zest of 2 lemons, and added a glaze using powdered sugar and lemoncella (lemon liquor). My husband said it was "perfect". Would now give 4 stars using these modifications. Thanks for the suggestions to use less sugar and add a glaze.

Very good. I made it the first time with lemon zest/juice, them tried it again with grapefruit! Even better! It's a nice dense cake and works well with fondue. Highly recommended.

This cake was delicious, despite several modifications from a novice baker. I cut the recipe in half so I could use a regular loaf pan, reduced the sugar slightly according to previous reviewers' advice, and used all-purpose flour (no cake flour on hand), and it still came out great. The only complaint was that it wasn't lemony enough -- despite the lemon juice/powdered-sugar glaze I added as it cooled. Next time I'll double the amount of lemon zest.

Made this for friends who requested it as their next holiday gift! What a great recipe! Added a glaze of lemon juice and confectioner's sugar - delicious!!!

This cake really was excellent. I gave it three forks instead of four because I found it a bit too sweet. Next time I'll use less sugar.

I have been making pound cakes for years and this is one of the best recipes I have found. I first tried this for a friend's birthday and topped with lemon cream cheese frosting and everyone raved about it, devoured it, but instead of asking me for the recipe, people asked me to make it for their bdays! I may just throw out my other recipes as this one is so adaptable. Definitely, do try this at home.

I made this recipe exactly according to the recipe only taking it out of the oven 5 minutes early. It was very moist and flavorful, a big hit for my friend's birthday topped with a lemon glaze.

Really moist, and the lemon gives it a nice little zip. Would try with orange maybe too.

Rating: 3
Easy, fool-proof, with a pefect rise and consistent texture throughout. I would make this again without question. Seems to have an excellent flavor and texture for use as a wedding cake. I am going to try it with a glaze next time because I think it would benefit from the added zip. Judging by the comments here and my results, it seems like a recipe you can fiddle around with and not risk destroying it.

I slightly changed the recipe by using 2/3 lemon zest and 1/3 lime zest, doubling the amount called for and glazed it with a lemon-lime syrup. It won 1st place at the 2001 Sonoma County, California Fair!

This pound cake was very moist and had good lemon flavor. I will make it again and use 2-2 1/2 cups of sugar because I found it to be a little sweet for my taste. This was the first pound cake that I have ever made and I think I started with a real winner!

For a family of consummate chocolate lovers, we were really thrilled with this segue from our usual desserts! The pound cake was very moist, and a lemon glaze was just the right touch to spruce up the lemon flavour. I doubled the lemon zest and juice. I should also mention that I made it on a rainy day, and the cake still doubled in size! This is definitely a keeper!

The best poundcake I have ever had! The second time I made it, I substituted non-fat lemon yoghurt for the sourcream and the cake was still great. This is now the only pound cake I will ever make.

I have been hunting for this recipe for so long. I cut it out of your magazine and made it upon demand for my Mom & Brother. Since I lost the recipe, I've never made it again. Its Mommy's Day & I'm gonna surprise my mom! Thanks So Much. I need to renew my subscription ASAP.

This cake is absolutely FOOLproof. I made it with all purpose flour and salted butter, then my 7 yr old helper spilled the fresh lemon juice and I had to use concentrate. The flour mixture was DUMPED into the wet mixture, and some lost in the process (thanks to my helper). The result was a perfect cake... Absolutely gorgeorus, and wonderfully delicious. I can't imagine it being any better!

Yummy. I have made this a few times and agree with the others who feel it needs a bit more lemon peel (1&1/2-2TBL). I always drizzle it with Lemon Glze too. It usually doesn't take 1&1/2 hours to bake, more like 1hr&15-20 mins.

This was a great cake that turned out really nice. I was out of lemons and had a new bag of tangelos on hand. I substituted orange for the lemon, doubling the amounts of juice & rind. Added an orange glaze, was fabulous.

I cut this recipe in half and baked in a small bundt pan for about one hour - attractive and nice texture. I wanted the cake to shout LEMON, so I added more rind (probably doubled) and lemon juice to taste. An addition my husband and I agreed made it fabulous was a glaze made with powdered sugar and lemon juice. Mix lemon juice into sugar to a thick but pourable consistency, and pour over cooling cake. Let cake cool and glaze harden. I might try adding even more of the glaze as a layer in the batter, since we loved that addition.

Great cake. Followed the recipe exactly, (maybe adding some extra lemond rind) and it turned out great. Everyone loved this cake.

This cake wasn't any better or worse than other pound cakes I've tried. I wouldn't cream the sugar and butter for five minutes, instead of being light and fluffy, the mixture turned to a lump of clay. Otherwise, the cake came out fine; it rose nicely and had a good texture

It is super moist and near perfection. We discovered that a dash of rosewater made this pond cake absolutely superb. For birthdays around our house, it is an annual request!

I have my own custom cake business, and a client requested sour cream pound cake with cream cheese filling.Yes! Cream cheese filling! I had no recipes in any of my cookbooks, so i found and Used this one, omitting the lemon and using vanilla instead. The pound cake was very good,keeps well, and is delicious plain or with other fillings.Thanks for bailing me out!

Made the pound cake on a rainy day and it was a disaster, it fell. Noticed when I added the lemon juice, to the eggs and butter, the volume decreased significantly. I will try again in the near future on a sunny day.

I make a lot of variations of pound cakes and this one is one of the best!

I made this cake for the first time 2 years ago and it is now a staple in our house. I make it for gifts at Christmas. Try adding flavored syrups, such as blackberry, raspberry or Grand Marnier just before you put it in the oven. Just pour a bit on the top of the batter and swirl it in. (My wife's idea!)Check it carefully as it bakes...it can become overdone quickly.

Very yummy. Try adding a quarter cup of poppyseeds, too, for texture, or basing it on oranges instead of lemons. Works great!

This cake was the hit of the party. I had people begging to take what little was left home with them. I did find that it took longer than 1 1/2 hours to bake. In my oven it was closer to two. Everyone loved it and I will make this again and again.

I have to add my praise for this recipe to all the others'! It's fantastic! I mixed about 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice with about 1/4 cup 10-X sugar and poured this over the top of the cake as soon as it came out of the oven. I let it cool completely in the pan then, and turned it out. It makes the cake a lot moister, but is probably not really necessary. This is one divine cake, folks.

A freat standard, I've never been disappointed. It's always requested by friends, family and co-workers. I also like to add more lemon peel and like the idea of a lemon-sugar galze. No, it's not a traditional pound cake, but it is one darn good cake!

This is a fine cake.I made it for my birthday -- lemon pound cake is my favourite and this one did not disappoint me. I used a little more lemon peel in the cake and glazed it while warm with old fashioned lemon juice and sugar glaze. Just excellent. I expect yoghurt could be substituted for the sour cream in a pinch and will try that one of these days.
