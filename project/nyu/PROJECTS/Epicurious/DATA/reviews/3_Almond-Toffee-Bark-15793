I followed the advice, used a candy thermometer and it came out just fine. There's no way without a thermometer so just get one ($6 at the grocery store). I ommitted lemon juice and replaced with 1 Tbl water. Did not like the amount of almonds in first batch, seemed like more almonds than candy, and the recipe didn't fill the baking sheet. So I doubled the recipe, everything except the almonds the second time. Much better! I decorated the finished product before breaking with thin lines of white chocolate melted and then squeezed through a small whole cut in an icing decorator bag (could use a regular plastic bag).

I cant believe this recipe was written omitting the use of a candy thermometer! For shame Epicurious! No wonder there were negative reviews. Please, fellow cooks, as others have suggested, use a candy thermometer and pull the pot of sugar/butter from the stove when the temp reaches 300 degree. This will becomes a no fail recipe resulting in an absolutely tasty, addictive treat. My suggestions are as follows: omit the lemon juice; if you make 1½ times the recipe it will fit very nicely in a standard metal cookie sheet with edges and will give the perfect thickness to the toffee; while still warm put a bag of bittersweet chocolate chips on the top and spread gently as they melt; put the reserved almonds on immediately after topping with the chocolate and shake the pan to distribute evenly. I have made this with Turbinado sugar (which I prefer). It creates a more caramel like flavor to the toffee and the toffee become a wee bit chewier than when using the white sugar. Yum!

I am not the best cook in the world. So, maybe I missed something that a more experienced cook would catch? The recipe seemed simple enough, yet I am not sure what went wrong. Recipe ended up gooey and was quite disappointing.

This is a great recipe. Very easy as long as you pay close attention the whole time you're making it (monitoring the toasting almonds so they don't burn, keeping a close eye on the toffee so you remove it from the heat at the right time, melting the chocolate carefully). I skipped the lemon juice. And to ensure a hard crack (302 degrees), I used a candy thermometer (for the first time in my life) and the toffee came out perfectly! Great for holiday gifts.

Easy and so good. Makes for a great gift for the holidays. A candy thermometer helps..when it reaches 300 it is perfect.

THIS stuff is awesome! I skipped lemon juice, per the suggestion of another reviewer. First time I chopped the almonds. Second time around I used whole toasted almonds and melted a 12 oz bag of milk chocolate chips. Very easy to make. you will definitely impress your gifters.

I cooked the toffee to 300 degrees on a candy thermometer and it turned out perfect! It's thin and crisp and delicious. This recipe is a keeper.

After reading others' comments, I decided to make this, but to be certain to cook the mixture 'til golden. I cooked it over twice as long as instructed to by the recipe and still, it never bacame bark, just tasty, but flexible toffeeish stuff. And the lemon flavor was too pronounced. Bummer!!

This is a terrific recipe for a very special candy that's more exotic than fudge. Was very easy to make. I kept it in the freezer for a few days before breaking it up and "gifting" it. Also, you have to work quickly with the toffee because it sets quickly. Will definitely make again.

This was a mess and a dentist's dream. I threw the whole thing in the garbage. It was so chewy there was no way anyone could eat it and carry on a conversation. I would not make it again, unless I ate it straight out of the freezer. But if you give as gifts, there is no way to ensure that.

I would have given this to more people as gifts but my husband ate most of it! Using Valrhona chocolate really added to the outcome.

I think this candy was really good. I have made toffee for several years using a different recipe. This one is not as good. The time stated isn't enough for the syrup to reach the "hard crack" stage. If the candy isn't eaten "cold" it is very "sticky" and not appealing to the tooth! The best toffee recipe in in Gourmet "TOFEE MCGREEVEY". Try it and I guarantee you will agree!

Toast the almonds very slowly and stir often or they will burn. The quality of your saucepan will make a big difference. With my heavy cephelon saucepan, this was very easy because it heats all of the mixture evenly. My sister had a hard time with this part because of that. I love this recipe. It is so easy to make.

I thought this recipe was great. I had a little problem with the boiling time, mine took about 20 minutes, so make sure to wait for the color of the mixture to turn golden. Other than that, received great reviews from all at my Christmas festivities!!

This is a great toffee, very tasty. A bit of advice for novice candy makers: you MUST achieve hard crack stage for the toffee to be crunchy. Use a candy thermometer, it is the best way to achieve consistent results.

This recipe TASTES delicious, but I had some trouble getting the toffee part to set properly in the fridge - is it supposed to be so goopy? Might have to try it again to see if I can get it right!

Make sure that you keep a close eye on your almonds while they are toasting - my started to scorch after about 7 minutes in the oven, and the bitter taste lingered in the finished toffee. Also, I would cut the amount of almonds needed in half for a more balanced consistency. I loved that there was no need for a candy thermometer, and I loved that it cooked in a fairly quick time.

This toffee was so easy to prepare and worth trying. I was making it to give as gifts, but I ended up eating half the batch myself! I have another recipe I have made from Bon Appetit, called Coffee-Walnut Toffee, and it is the best toffee recipe I have ever tasted, but it takes so much longer to cook. So I will use this recipe when I don't have the time for the other recipe.

I made this recipe as teacher's gifts this Christmas past. I've made toffee before, but this recipe is the simplest and most fool proof to date (and no dickering around with candy thermometers - a real bonus). If you've never made a confection before, this recipe provides an excellent foray into candy making.
