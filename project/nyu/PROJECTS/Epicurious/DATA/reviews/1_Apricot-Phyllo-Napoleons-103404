First of all, the phyllo needs to be baked at 400 degrees, not 350. Three-hundred and fifty degrees isn't hot enough. I bought phyllo dough, (Peperidge Farms brand)and in order to create the layerd look in the picture, don't stack sheets before baking -- one sheet per layer. The other problem I had with the recipe is that the yogurt mixture and apricots didn't mix well. Both are tangy and instead of complimenting each's flavor, it just tastes weird. For something for which you have to buy a cheesecloth and for which you have to think ahead eight hours, this deceptively simple dessert is not worth it.
