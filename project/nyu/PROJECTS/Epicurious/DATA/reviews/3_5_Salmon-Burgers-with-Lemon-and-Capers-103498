I was so, so disappointed by this recipe. I halved the recipe so maybe that was my issue, however I followed it exactly and got terrible results. The amount of breadcrumbs was excessive and made the burgers wayyyy to bready and mealy. I also thought that the caper mixture completely ruined the flavor of the salmon itself. It was inedible to say the least and my fiancee and I ended up having to throw away what would have otherwise been a nice piece of salmon.

I am totally addicted to these salmon burgers! I usually make a topping of 50/50 mayo/plain yogurt and mix in some more capers. So yummy!

Just ok... Halved the recipe and used tarragon and a bit of cilantro instead of dill, but otherwise followed the recipe as written. Underwhelming-- but good foundation for experimentation.

First attempt at making Salmon Burgers and it was easy and delicious. My father in law who is very picky even liked it!

These were on a sliders menu I did recently for a small dinner party. They were a hit. However, I tried using canned wild salmon as recommended by several other reviewers, and was disappointed with the color and consistency. I'd definitely stick with the fresh fillets. I'd also use homemade tartar sauce instead of the mayonnaise.

these were pretty easy and really good. my husband thought he hated salmon burgers, but i really wasn't in the mood for the filets i already had on hand, so i made them anyway and he is a convert. i had no fresh dill, so i added some dried as i was cooking the shallot mixture, which was good in a pinch although i bet fresh is better. i also added some parsley to the burgers before forming them. served with an easy lemon mayo on the roll: add lemon zest and juice to taste ( i use a lot) to store bought mayo (i use light mayo). added just a little more flavor and brightness.

My family really enjoyed this recipe, even my 2 year old daughter was a fan. We actually used canned wild salmon (which was great since we didn't have to chop it) we obmitted the wine and we only used 2 cups of breadcrumbs, but aside from that we followed the recipe exactly.

These burgers are very good. They certainly let the natural salmon flavor shine; but to me they needed a little kick...diced red peppers, scallions and a shake of cayenne did the trick. I served them with a simple tartar sauce of mayonnaise, sweet pickle relish and Dijon. Yum. Enjoy!

I was looking for a recipe to use cooked slamon and decided to alter this one. When it was all mixed up I pressed it into a med. size baking dish. I baked it at 350 degrees until slightly brown.

I have made this twice now and just love it. Did not change anything on the recipe. Per previous reviews they freeze amazingly well and are ready when you want a quick meal without any work! I had one leftover and the next moring had it with a fried egg and it was great. Next time I'm going to try this as an "eggs benedict" dish for breakfast.

This was simply OK. Wasn't thrilled with it as I thought it was a little bland. Have had much better salmon burgers. The salmon should also be hand-chopped to maintain the best texture.

Rating: 4
I have made this many times: my family loves it! I don't find the wine essential; when I leave it out it doesn't seem to affect the flavor at all. I always add a dollop of horseradish to the mixture for a little zip. I have also made this in "mini" sizes: they are great h'ors doeuvres (make a dill, mayo,lemon juice sauce to accompany).

I thought these were okay in that the shallot mixture provided a nice flavor. I could hardly taste the salmon. My husband liked them alot so he can eat the leftover patties that I put in freezer.

This is a great recipe....it's a tasty way to get your omega 3's....and not worry about bones from the fish.....I used spinach instead of lettuce and also melted some cheese on top....normally I can't eat alot of salmon cause it's so rich - but I ate 2 of these burgers.....yummy!

I am always looking for good and different recipes to use the wild salmon currently in season. I wanted to make burgers out of the meat along the backbone and decided to give this one a try. I followed the directions exactly with the exception of freezing the patties as soon as they are formed (my small family could never eat ten burgers in one sitting). I then grilled the frozen burgers over a medium high heat for around five minutes a side. The burgers held together well and cook up wonderfully. I know have four more wonderful meals ten minutes away!

Tasty burgers. I followed the recipe exactly and used a lemony mayonnaise. If you're not fond of lemony tastes, then perhaps cut back on the lemon. Careful not to overcook them. They just go from tastey to yukky real fast.

came to this site looking for something to dress up 100% salmon burgers from Trader Joes and found this recipe. Flavors sounded to intriguing to pass up so I made a condiment out of the shallot mixture and added dill. It tastes amazing. Served on fresh rolls with a casear salad (purists don't freak out. I didn't rate since I didn't actually make the recipe.)

These burgers are absolutely wonderful! I skipped the bun and served them with a big salad. A great summer meal.

This is delicious. My friends and family continue to ask for this. Something about the carmelized onions and caper mixture makes it mellow and heartening.

I wonder if anyone has tried to use a high quality canned salmon for this recipie

Outstanding! The Salmon burgers had incredible flavor and were juicy. I added a quarter teaspoon of hot pepper to the recipe and this added just enough heat. I substituted caper paste for capers. The results were absolutely superb! My wife and two children (9 and 6) devoured all I made. I highly recommend the recipe. This will likely become a standard in my household.

These salmon burgers are excellent. They are the equivalent of going to a poached salmon buffet with capers and dill mayo, onions etc. It's just the way you'd eat salmon, but all together in one little burger. We LOVE these, and would not change a thing.

I just made these tonight and they were such a hit! Good advice to skip the bun and highlight their taste even more. I piled a heap of rucola in the middle of the plate dressed with a simple dressing of olive oil, dijon mustard, and champagne vinger. Then threw some diced pomodori tomatoes on that and put one burger (made on the large side - 7 instead of ten) on top of that. I topped each burger with a dollup of fresh homemade lemon mayonnaise, a crack of black pepper, and voila! It was a fantastic main course with some haricots verts around the outside of the plate. And thanks for the suggestions on freezing them - I have three left in the freezer now and my husband is hinting at putting them in the fridge so we can have them for dinner tomorrow night!!

These were great. I used plain dried breadcrumbs instead of a "real" loaf of bread and they still tasted great. I also ate them without a bun. Next time I will try them with that lemon mayo from the poached salmon as well.

Very nice alternative to beef burgers. I'll make these often.

These were quite good, but certainly not fantastic. I followed the recipe exactly, except we did not eat them on a bun - just served on top of watercress greens with a yogurt dill sauce. Next time I will add 1/2 again more capers and squeeze lemon juice on top after cooking.

These are outstanding! I made a 1/4 recipe as there are only 2 of us and it worked great. To the cook from Langley, we had some left over lemon mayonise from the poached salmon recipe on this site and it was a marvelous pairing. I will preface that we had these without the bun as that sauce is a tad runny for a burger. The "salmon cake" served with some fresh fruit on baby greens was a lovely lunch! REALLY GOOD

Delicious! I don't like dill so I used dried tarragon instead. Also, I made a leek and lemon cream sauce to serve with the patties instead of putting them on hamburger buns. Will make again soon!

After reading the reviews, I decided to make this dish. I have never made salmon burgers before. They were absolutely delicious! It was much lighter than a regular burger(of course)and tasted so flavorful. I even took the advice from some others and froze a few. Hope those turn out just as wonderful! Will definitely make these again...note my husband loved it but both my 5 and 8 year olds did not care for it(even though both kids do like fish).

This is the best recipe I have gotten from this site (and that's saying a LOT!) I made this recipe for a few "meat and potatoes" guys, and when I told them what I was making, I got groans and pleas to just make "regular burgers", but after they tried them their attitude COMPLETELY changed and they told me they were the best thing they'd ever had! Now they beg me to make them all the time! As a non-meat eater this recipe is also great for me, because I love burgers and I don't miss the beef AT ALL with this recipe!!!

I bought a large fillet and made a bunch of burgers. I then froze most of them in vacuum pack bags. They are just as good as the fresh ones and I get raves from those that try them. Just right for my heart healthy mediteranean diet.

I have been making these burgers more or less following the cook in malvern, pennsylvania's composite recipe for a long time now. I make them, freeze them individually & store in small baggies. When anyone is hungry, comes in late, etc. all they do is microwave one burger on defrost for 2 minutes and saute in a pan with a little olive oil. I have teenagers with vegetarian and other picky habits - and this recipe is a family stand-by. We use ordinary buns & tartar sauce and they are still wonderful and a healthful alternative for a quick meal. I highly recommend this and suggest trying the freezer thing.

I agree with other reviewer that these are too good to be served with buns. I halved the recipe and wished I hadn't because they were DELICIUOS! Just one left me salivating for more. I served these with the "tarragon mayonaise" from another salmon burger recipe on your site-PERFECT!!

Excellent and looks great ! A followed earlier suggestions and used a bit less breadcrumbs than stated (about 3 cups) and made sure the shallot caper mixture was well drained before I added it.

Rating: 2
This wasn't bad, but I will definately make some changes next time. First, I will chop the salmon up by hand to get a better consistency (maybe it was just my processor, but mine ended up a mix of baby food with some chunks in it). This also needs a decent sauce, since I thought it was too dry, and the mayo just didn't have enough finesse. In desperation, I added some cocktail sauce, which helped a little, but I'm on the lookout for a good sauce now....any suggestions out there?

I must be missing something. I only made this because of the overwhelmingly positive reviews. We both thought that it was more about breading and than fish. It resembled those dreadful crab cakes with all the breading and not much crab. You couldn't tell that it was made from salmon.

My husband and I loved this recipe! And that's saying a lot for my husband who loves a real beef burger. It was a little bit salty for my taste, and I am generally the biggest salt lover of all. I think I will cut out the salt next time, as the capers do the trick. Otherwise, a complete hit!

This was absolutely fantastic. But I am going to serve it next time the way I would serve crab cakes. Make it much more formal than as a burger. It just needs to be presented in a better way.

as my boyfriend said, "eveything you make is great, but this is REALLY awesome!"... flavors blend very well together - didn't even use food processor - just chopped by hand.

Delicious alternative to your typical beef burger. The flavors of the lemon, dill, and capers blended well, but I think I'll try it with less capers than the recipe calls for next time. Also I'm not a big fan of mayo and didn't think the burgers needed to be served with any other condiments. They have plenty of flavor on their own.

Delicious! I left out the capers (forgot!) and used some garlic powder and more dill. We really raved over these! I also carmelized some onions and served them on top. WOW! We used onion buns too and it was great. My husband cooked them on the grill and they held together great and tasted wonderful. I sure dont miss "meat" burgers with these around!

I live in Southeast Alaska, so I eat a lot of salmon. I am always looking for ways to make it that are good and interesting. I made this recipe for a boat trip on the 4th of July and it was a big hit. Easy to make, you can make it ahead of time, and very good!

These burgers have great flavor. I halved the recipe, and instead of dill (couldn't find any fresh) I used some prepared horseradish instead. Next time, I think I will use a little less breadcrumb, and I might try broiling them (hope that works).

There are 4 salmon burger receipes on this site. I took the best of them all and combined. I am so truly happy with the result. They stayed together, were moist and DELICIOUS!!!Here goes: 1 TBL Oil, 1/2Cup shallots, 1/2Cup Wine 2 TBL Lemon juice, 1 TBL capers, 1.25 LBS salmon, 1 Cup Breadcrumbs, 1 egg, l 1/2 tsp dill, 1 tsp salt 1/4 tsp pepper, tsp dijon, 1 tsp ground ginger. Follow instructions for first 5 ingredients (saute, reduce, cool). Add Salmon and next 7 ingredients. Mix well. Shape into 6 patties. This fed my husband (who had 2)and 2 teenage daughters with another l for my lunch tomorrow. Serve with Tarragon Mayo: 1/2 C Mayo, 1/8 C Sour Cream, l TBL Capers, l TBL lemon juice, 2 tsp tarragon, 1 tsp dijon, 1 tsp horseradish, 1 tsp soy. (about 3/4 cup). Serve on fresh toasted rolls with tomato and lettuce. It is really, really, good!

We all loved this recipe, even my 9 year old. I did use green onions instead of shallots, and halved the recipe. I served it like a salmon pattie with dilled new potatoes and sugar snap peas. This menu will be repeated often at our house!

I made these burgers for my husband and some of our friends. Everyone loved them and many took a second burger. The consistency is almost like a crab cake, so they were a bit fragile. But the flavor was amazing! I will definitely make again next time I need something nicer than hamburgers but more casual than a full dinner.

I substituted Ahi Tuna for the Salmon and alleviated the dill. Instead of capers, I had green peppercorns in brine on hand and used a small amount a little more than a T. The burgers turned out great! I put the extras in the freezer for the cook who wants to know how they freeze, I will let you know.

I thought the end result was very good but would have prefered that the recipe had been written with smaller proportions. I feel that it puts some people off of trying a recipe if it is for 10.

I agree, I may never go back to beef burgers again. Everyone enjoyed them and they will become a regular item on my dinner table. I found one egg sufficient since the mixture was fairly moist and they still held together during cooking.

This recipe at first seems overwhelming but it was actually easy to prepare. My husband and I really enjoyed the salmon burgers. I left out the capers since my husband is allergic to them and I didn't miss them.
