Great, super easy appetizer recipe. Depending on how thickly you spread, this recipe can go a long way. I make it quite frequently and sometimes use a bit of regular onion if I don't have scallions in, sometimes no onion at all. Sometimes use locatelli instead of parmesan. It all comes good. No brainer.

This was very well received at a wine tasting get together. Making the topping the night before gives time for the flavors to marry. I broiled them up just before taking them to the event and they traveled very well. My favorite kind of recipe, fast, good and easy!

These are good, but you have to have them before they get cold, or else.....YUCK!

This was a disappointment. It didn't have much flavor.

Absolutely delicious and easy to make, especially since the mixture can be made in advance! Homemade mayonnaise and freshly ground Parmesan cheese make a difference. I like the sourdough baguette, but have used English Muffins in a pinch!

Wonderful! These are so easy and delicious. The first time I made them for guests, two folks were late and nearly missed out entirely! Change them up with chopped roasted red pepper or capers.

What a great quick and easy hors d'oeuvres! Kudos to the reviewer who suggested having the bakery dept. slice the bread. I'm not a fan of olives but loved this recipe.

These were very yummy and so fast and easy to prepare. I think I'll add another green onion next time for a little more punch. The sourdough baguette makes a nice flavor combination.

This recipe was ok. I was a bit disappointed with the results after reading all the reviews. Instead of using regular pitted black olives, I used kalamata pitted olives. I'm not an olive expert but I was told that kalamata olives were good olives. I thought the mixture of this was too overpowering for my taste. I served this during a Christmas dinner for a party of 6 and only 1 guest enjoyed this recipe.

This recipe is great. Even easier if you ask the grocery to slice the sourdough baguette with their bread cutting machine. I burned the crust the first two times and found broiling on one of the bottom racks necessary with my oven.

The pickiest eater in THE ENTIRE world asked for this recipe...enough said!

So so easy and tasty - guests always ask for the recipe. Have tried it using Boboli pizza crust instead of the sourdough baguette, and it just wasn't the same. The Boboli must have some spices etc. in it that detract from the taste. A fresh sourdough baguette works best.

i substituted 1/2 of the mayonaise with ricotta cheese. It was delicious and less fattening!

An incredibly fast and easy appetizer to prepare! They were a big hit with my guests, and in the future, I'll be sure to make more than a single recipe's worth.

I've made this appetizer for three different dinner celebrations - each time, this is the appetizer that went first and everyone wants the recipe. A quick, easy winner.

I loved these. I served them with soup but will make them again and serve them at a coctail party. I thought they were tasty hot, room temperature, and cold out of the refrigerator. This is a keeper.

These toasts were very quick and easy, as well as tasty. Surely worth making again.

My dinner guests finished these off in the same amount of time it took to prepare them...5 minutes!!! This is a great appetizer for almost any occasion, and it's very inexpensive to prepare. ANYONE can make this recipe and come off looking like a gourmet chef!

Easy, Fast, and Great Tasting don't always go together but in the case of this recipe - YES! My guests inhaled and of course asked for the recipe.

I made these as an appetizer for New Year's Eve and they were perfect. What an easy recipe with great results!

Fast is an understatement (5 minutes to prepare...tops). Even faster when you buy the pre-chopped olives. Delicious and interesting taste...doesn't taste like the typical quickie starter.

Unbelievably simple and they disappeared in seconds! They literally take a few minutes to prepare and 2 minutes to broil.

This recipe is a MUST for hors d'oeuvres at an elegant party or a tv night. SO easy to make and delicious. I brought it to a pot-luck party where everyone brought appetizers and this dish was highly rated - in fact, mine was the only dish that people asked for the recipe.

This is very easy and has a wonderful flavor. Everyone I have served it to thinks it is great. I always keep a small tin of chopped black olives in the cupboard to make it even faster to prepare.
