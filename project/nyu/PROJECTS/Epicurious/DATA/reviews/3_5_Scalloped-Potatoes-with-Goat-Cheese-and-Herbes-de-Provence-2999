I have been making these potatoes to go with our Christmas prime rib since 1996.They are delicious and there are never any leftovers! Just follow the recipe and they are perfect every time!

OH MY GOSH!!!!! We LOVED these the night I made them and they were also fabulous reheated.....all week long. I made TOO much so we had them for a while. I am doing them again tonight!!!! I LOVED them with the wine but I am staying away from alcohol for health reasons now....so I am going to try sautéing some mushrooms for a different flavor.

Amazing! Follow the recipe -- it was great. Just make sure that you cover and coat all the potatoes -- that was the key. Very rich and delicious. Made it for Thanksgiving, but this can be even better if paired with a tenderloin.

Rating: 3
Quite good. Followed the recipe accurately. Dotting the top with extra cheese is redundant and unnecessary. The dish is quite rich and very tasty. It looked fantastic just browned and I should have not bothered with the extra cheese at that point. Use a decent goat cheese (but not the most expensive!!)

This was outstanding, added some blue cheese as well.

This was just ok. My only deviation from the recipe was a dusting of freshly grated parmesan. Too starchy flavor/texture (maybe if I skipped the simmer step or maybe I let it simmer a moment too long... not sure, but I love scalloped potatoes and "starch" is not a complaint I've had before... seems the goat cheese accentuated the starchiness - I LOVE goat cheese too so was uber disappointed this wasn't more of a hit for me or the dinner party.

Fantastic flavors. Didn't have herbs de Provence on hand but used marjoram and tarragon. Left out the garlic (by accident). Used 2 1/2 lbs of Yukon Gold potatoes and left the skin on. Everyone raved about the dish.

Rating: 3
I used 1 1/4 cup whipping cream and 1/4 cup non fat milk. I used low sodium chicken broth. I didn't have enough shallots so used red onion to fill in. I used 1/2 log of cheese when I cooked it, and added a tiny little bit when it was done cooking. I was worried that there was too much liquid but by the time it cooked 50 minutes and then rested, it was perfect. It was nicely browned on the top and very impressive. I only had 3 lbs of potatoes and it was plenty. I served 6 people with at least 3 servings left over. It is very rich, so you don't need a lot.

I've made this recipe several times over the years, and it is so good. I found the reviews here to be helpful for my most recent version. I agree that adding the full amount of goat cheese to the sauce is the best way, and I also added a bit more shallot, garlic, and salt. I cooked the potatoes and then took them out of the oven in order to cook my roast. I returned them to the oven an hour later to warm them, and at that time I added a layer of parm-reg on top. Yum! Oh, and I cooked them in my 6 qt. Staub pot on the stove and then just put the whole thing in the oven. I don't think you need to bother with a separate dish to bake unless you want to for presentation.

Rating: 4
I made this exactly as written, to bring to a potluck. The recipe made a large amount but was pretty easy to follow. These potatoes were a huge hit and a couple people asked for the recipe. I did find that the added goat cheese on top was almost unnecessary, as there is good goat cheese flavor even without it. Next time I may sprinkle a little parmesan for more dimension but it's still an excellent dish.

Rating: 3
I use 1/2 goat cheese and 1/2 good quality sharp cheddar. The flavor of the goat cheese becomes intriguing...Otherwise, all goat cheese, the flavor is too strong...Anytime I serve this dish, the potatoes are a hit! The dish goes very well with the Herb and Spice Roasted Beef Tenderloin with Red Wine Shallot Sauce.

This is a simply a lovely recipe for scalloped potatoes. I made my own Herbes de Provence and leaned a little more heavily on the lavender and rosemary and less on the oregano to give it more of what I imagined a French flair. Whether that would be true or not, it worked. Mr. Fox had requested that I cook them with pork chops as his mother did when he was a little boy -- I browned those in a reduction, a glaze (? something like that) of olive oil, a lot of balsamic vinegar, a tiny bit of garlic, and a heap of rosemary and added them toward the end of the baking time. It was gorgeous!! Like the other cooks that have reviewed the recipe, I want to rush to its defense as well. It's not bland at all, it's just delicious and elegant. But it does taste differently than scalloped potatoes made with a sharp cheddar.

Delicious. I sliced the potatoes with a Mandoline which saved lots of time and ensured even, thin slices. I was surprised when the recipe called for simmering the potatoes with the cream mixture, but in the end I think the starch in the potato thickens the sauce a bit. It's definitely not bland with the tang of goat cheese - maybe it depends on the goat cheese you use, or the previous reviewers forgot the salt or used old herbs? I made the recipe exactly as stated and it was great.

Oh my! I needed a potluck dish on Saturday and had all the ingredients for this on hand. I didn't have enough shallots so I used part red onion. I sauted the onion and garlic before adding the other ingredients and used more garlic than the recipe called for. Oh my! They were so good! There was luckily just enough left over to bring for lunch today. I will definately make these again and again.

If you love potatoes and goat cheese you will LOVE this recipe! Also the herbs de provence are not for your average meat and potatoes dick or jane but anyone who loves bon appetit recipes will love this! You can use half and half to lessen the fat and substitute half the goat cheese with cream cheese- less rich but just as yummy!

I've made this dish 3 times since it came out in the magazine. It's fantastic compliment for red meat or lamb. After reading some of the reviews below, I would say to you, if you don't like goat cheese, then don't make this dish! It's very rich, primarily because of the goat cheese. If you do like it, you and your dinner guests are in for a treat.

I have been making this recipe every year at the holidays for about ten years now. It is so simple, and so delicious. Everyone raves over it. Last night i made it using lowfat cream cheese rather than goat cheese, because I didn't want to run out to the store in the winter storm we were having. I also substituted milk for the heavy cream. It lacked the incredible rich flavor of the goat cheese, but it was still a better-than-average scallopped potatoes dish. I would make it again without the goat cheese and cream (as it was considerably cheaper, and lower fat), but for the holidays I would definitely make the recipe as is - rich and delicious.

Made these potatoes for Easter and they were a nice accompaniment to sugar glazed ham and asparagus. The goat cheese and wine gave the dish a little tartness. I combined all of the liquid ingredients and the herbs the night before, which I think really helped infuse the herb flavors into the sauce. I distributed half the goat cheese on top, and it helped to create a darker golden topping.

I have to say, I was a little disappointed with how these potatoes turned out - pretty bland and just not that special. The ingredients are just lovely and my expectations were high, but the results were just not as dazzling as I'd have liked. I took the advice of previous reviewers and added all the goat cheese to the sauce, and would highly recommend it. My husband loved them, but the rest of my Christmas guests didn't seem as thrilled as I had wanted. Unfortunately, given the cost of this dish, I probably won't go back.

On the basis of reviews recieved from those sitting around the dinner table, I'm giving this two forks. Left to my own devices, I'd give it a big, fat zero. While my spouse and guests thought the flavors were fine, all I tasted was an overwhelming tartness, which I attributed to the white wine. I'll make the dish one more time, but I'll either reduce the wine to 1/4 cup, or omit it altogether.

Rating: 3
I agree with the reviewers that the cheese added at the end doesn't really add anything -- I would add it all at once to the sauce next time. I also left the skins on and like it that way -- not as pretty for company maye, but I like the texture and flavor it adds.

A staple at our holiday table. This is the 4th Christmas dinner where they have been on the menu and there is about one serving left in the fridge this morning. I made them the day before and cooked them for 30 minutes. And on Christmas day, I cooked them an additional 40 minutes. A perfect side dish even for the picky people who "hate goat cheese." I just tell them the cheese is a new form of cheddar just so they'll try them. My experience is that people who don't like goat cheese have never tried it!

We've made this recipe several times for holiday meals and it's delicious. Plus you can put it in the oven, and not worry about it while you're preparing the rest of your meal. One substitution we usually make is replacing the russet potatoes with skin-on yukon gold potatoes. It reduces the cooking time by about 10 minutes, and the flavour is fantastic!

This has been a family request for Christmas dinner for many years now, even my pickiest eater who would never think of eating "goat cheese" loves them!!! The first year I made them, the store was out of plain goat chesse, so I used the herbed kind and reduced my spices abit. The third year I didn't use herbes de Provence, because I didn't want the lavender in the receipe instead I used "Fines Herbs" by Spice Island. Each receipe has been a success!! In the words of Dr. Seuss, try them, you'll like them! You'll like them a lot, my mouh just waters thinking of them!!!

Known affectionately as the "Goatherder's Special", this recipe has become a family favorite. As a child, my husband had a bad experience with homemade goat cheese and was quite hesitant to try this but he was won over! I wasn't able to find herbes de Provence at my grocery so I tried to add the individual herbs listed in the intro paragraph. They come out just fine. Also, the sauce can be made the night before. The next day, reheat the sauce, add potatoes and slide in the oven. Very very good!

Used ste-maure goat cheese (log) which i cut into pieces; I put all in at once. I fished out the pieces of rind with my whisk -- cutting it off would have wasted cheese and been messy too. My guests did not leave a scrap!

The first time that I made this dish, I was worried that my "pickier" guests would not care for the goat cheese or the herbes de provence - everyone loved it and I have served it for several years. I have also frozen some of it (since there are never left overs) to bake just for us at a later time and it comes out fine. This one is worth a try-if they like it, they really like it. Like others, I don't bother dotting the cheese on top, it does nothing for the dish.

I increased both the simmering and covered baking times and they turned out perfectly. And I, too, found it much simpler to add all of the cheese to the sauce, instead of dotting later. This dish is definitely going into my file of holiday favorites!

We served these potatoes for Christmas dinner. They were decadent and wonderful and we will be having them for many future special occasions. The only change I may make would be to either pipe the reserved cheese on top or replace it with some grated gruyere. Or even leave it out entirely. The "dotted" white blobs of cheese were not the most attractive presentation and did not add significantly to the overall taste of the dish.

This was the best scalloped potatoes recipe I've tried thus far. I increased the amount of shallots and garlic and it was delicious!

This dish was quite good, and would have been spectacular if I'd followed the recipe. I had no cream on hand and so substituted skim milk. The potatoes lacked richness and the color was "greyish" with skim milk. Therefore I will definitely move up half and half or whipping cream next time. With that upgrade the dish will undoubtedly be fit for company.

Served this New Years Eve with a Prime Rib. This was heavenly! I made them early in the day and reheated them 30 minutes beforehand.

No leftovers whatsoever (dang!) I'll definitely try it with goat cheese, but it works well with other cheeses, too. Dee-Lish!

To those who have already added this dish to their "wow the guests" repertoire, a variation: I substituted beets for half of the potatoes, and it came out fabulous.

Good variation of an old standard, but I'd make sure you and your guests like goat milk cheese before making it. The flavor of the cheese definitely permeates the dish. I used all fresh herbs and it worked nicely. My only complaint is that I cooked the potatoes FOREVER and they still were a little too tough. I don't know whether I didn't slice them thin enough or used too deep of a dish. Will definitely make again, although NOT for finicky eaters.

The next time I make this dish I won't bother dotting cheese on top. I think it would be better with all cheese mixed into the cream. Also, I'm surprised there weren't any comments about cooking temp. I have a thermometer in the oven to monitor temperature and 400 is too high. The potatoes on the bottom burned a bit. I would recommend 350 for the same time, or reduce the time at 400. Definitely a keeper however. Everyone loved them.

Nice twist to traditional scalloped potatoes -- with sprinkled flour, onions and cheddar as I recall from my childhood Toll House Cookbook. I noticed a lot of commentary on the expense of goat cheese. Look around! At my local Ralph's (a SoCal chain) they carry a reasonably priced and tasty brand. If you're not in Europe, anything really expensive is probably not worth it anyway! A very rich dish and great complement to, say, broiled fish.

This was an excellent dish. Very tasty and easy to make. I prepared the dish the day before and left the last 20 minutes left of cooking time for the evening of my dinner party. I highly recommend using real herbs de provence. I also do not feel you need to let cool for 15 min. The potatoes would have been cold by the time people ate them - serve right away.

This was wonderful and very easy! We had it with grilled salmon and a big green salad and it made the perfect complement to the meal. It's very rich, so I wouldn't recommend pairing with other rich sauced foods. We only used 3 T. herbes de provence, which we thought was plenty, and substituted half and half for the cream, which seemed to work well. We'll eat this again and again.

Delicious! Although,I would limit the Herbes de Provence to 3 teaspoons. At 4 teaspoons, it is a bit strong.

I loved it!! The goat cheese is a great ingredient, and light cream makes it very mild and tasty. Don't omit the crumbled cheese on top, it gives it a great crunchy-smooth feeling. It goes perfectly with roast meat or steak.

This was a huge hit! Everyone raved about the rich, deep flavor! My friends will demand that I make it again!

I've made this recipe twice. Once for my in-laws-to-be (I'm engaged) and another time for my brother who is a chef, I got rave reviews and passed on the recipe to both groups!

A friend made this for Xmas eve dinner with a roast beef tenderloin. It was fabulous. I have never made it before but I am putting it out for Easter Brunch with salmon and asparagus. I hope it turns out as good as hers.

This has become a family favorite. It's traditional at Christmas, with the wonderful tenderloin, and this year I'm making it for Easter too. I think it will be great with marinated lamb. It always gets raves--and usually gets finished off in one meal!

I absolutely loved this recipe. I have made it several time for dinner parties. It is very easy and quick to make. I also added all of the goat cheese to the sauce and did not dallop on top.

This recipe is incredibly delicious. I added all the goat cheese to the sauce and did not dot any on top. I was going to roast some meat to go with this, but since they had different cooking temps and I have only one oven, I put these in first. After one taste, I forgot about the meat and roasted some asparagus to go with them. I think I moaned while I was eating them.

I was a little concerned that my husband would not like this recipe because of the goat cheese so I used half the amount of cheese called for (I omitted the cheese at the end). He absolutely loved this dish (and so did I). The flavor is incredible. I've made it twice so far. The second time I used another kind of goat cheese (don't remember the name -- but it was hard, like cheddar) and it was even better.

I prepared them as another person suggested--mixing all of the cheese into the sauce instead of dotting some of the cheese on top--and they were superior. I served them for Christmas and everyone raved over them. A nice change from similar recipes.

I was disappointed, not as much flavor as I expected.

I couldn't find herbes de provence so i improvised with rosemary, thyme, parsley, oregano mixture. The flavor was amazing. The goat cheese makes this dish - and I love goat cheese. Easy to prepare too. I served with Filet Mignon with Merlot elsewhere on this site. Sensational.

We loved it, but then again, we love potatoes, goat cheese, herbs de provence and anything fattening! We had it aside grilled lamb chops and it was a nice accompaniment. May I ask how the other reviewers reheated it? I tried the oven the following day, however, it seemed to dry out a bit. I don't like the microwave very much, but would it have been better in this case? Thanks for any ideas!

These were some fancy potatoes. They were delicious. But my guests couldn't handle more than one helping. I loved the flavor the herb mix gives the dish. A great side dish for a special occasion. It went nicely with the beef tenderloin with roasted shallots, bacon and port.

I loved the creamyness and the flavour of the goat cheese. The herbes de Provence really made it. The kids liked it as well.

excellent side dish, made it last night with grilled lamb and had rave reviews from all guests! Easy to make, I also added the cheese all at once. The only problem was that it bubbled over the casserole dish, but the smoke cleared before anyone arrived!

This was easy to make and tasty. I followed one cook's advice and add all the cheese at once. It worked fine. Mild and creamy, it was a nice accompaniment for the beef tenderloin.

Great variation on a scalloped potato casserole. I served this dish to guests along with Basil-crusted Veal Chops (BA12/99) and Green Beans with Mushroom-madeira Sauce (BA9/99) - great menu. I substituted evap. non-fat milk for the cream and forgot to sprinkle the remaining cheese on top. Maybe that would work for the reviewers that thought the goat cheese was too strong. I will make this again and use all the goat cheese just to compare.

I cooked this for the first time for Christmas dinner, it was delicious. I served leftovers the next day and it was still deliciuos. I have already passed the recipe on to friends. It is worth the effort.

This is wonderful- especially with the tenderloin. It makes for a flavorful and elegant meal, which usually gets rave reviews. I have made this once every winter for the past three years and each time served it for a different occasion. The recipe is easy to follow, and the flavor (with the herbes de Provence) is truly unique. Loved it loved it loved it- wouldn't change a thing!

This was excellent. I needed to cook the potatoes a little longer than the recipe states, however.

Made this with the Beef Tenderloin. Per other recommendations I used a mild, good quality goat cheese but found it a little overwhelming. The herbs were great but I think I would replace some of the goat cheese with a bit of cream cheese to mellow it out. Also a hearty red wime is a must! Rec: Rosemount Estate's Cabernet-Shiraz

Everyone loved this! It went great with the tenderloin! I would not change a thing!

As so many others have said, it was okay, just not worth all the raves. I used Herbs de Provence with the lavender included, and thought the taste was too much for the potatoes to stand up to. Next time, I'll stick with my recipie for potatoes au gratin with white wine, garlic, thyme and cream. Now those are yummy!

This went nicely with the herbcrusted tenderloin with red wine shallot sauce but any good scalloped potato recipe would have been fine. Nothing special.

A friend of ours brought this to our New Year's dinner and it was a huge hit. I'm printing off the recipe now. Re-heated the left-overs in the oven with a little added cream.

This is a fantastic dish. I've made it for company a number of times and everyone has seconds and wants the recipe. The combination of herbs, wine and goats cheese make this dish a gourmet experience to remember!

Blaah! Too cheesy. I agree with the previous review. It smelled very nice during the preparation but when I served it for New Year's Eve...I noticed most of it was still on the plates of my guests!! I was disappointed and wished I had just stuck to my old standbye from Betty Crocker.

I threw away the leftovers. The potatoes were okay, but nothing great. There are too many good potato gratin dishes to waste the effort on this receipe. Try the gruyere potato gratin instead, or your favorite scalloped potato recipe.

I was a little nervous about making these since I'm not a goat cheese fan, but these were some delicious potatoes. They were creamy and very rich. I served them with the beef brisket with portobello mushrooms and dried cranberries for xmas eve dinner, and the two dishes went very well together. Just as good heated up the next day as leftovers.

Great dish. We cut the recipe in half for a smaller crowd. I would recommend leaving the potato skins on for a little texture.

Great recipe, one I would make again for special occasions. I used a mild goat cheese which I think was a large part of this recipes success - a strong cheese would be overwhelming.

I've made this dish twice for dinner parties, and the men in particular seem to love it. Make sure to use all the cheese it calls for or it will turn out a little dry.

Teens did not enjoy the flavors as much as the adults.I would make it again for an adult party.I mixed all the cheese together instead of setting aside half for the topping.I used the 15 X 10 X 3" glass pan and glad I did. It may have been too full and boiled over while baking if I used any less of a pan.I served this with a Ham..I thought the flavors blended very well.

Made this last year and was rather disappointed, as we love goat cheese and thought it would be fabulous. It was only so-so. Maybe the strong goat cheese and herb flavors would contrast better with a beef dish.

I thought this was very good, but not spectacular. I have had many potato dishes that were better! This recipe was followed to the letterwith the exception of adding the cheese all at once as had been reccomended. The herb-spice-roasted beef tenderloin with red wine-shallot sauce was superb on a pork roast which I happened to have on hand. My family also rated this dish the same as I did.

Amazing! This is a must do.I think the recipe is fine as is, though I found no need to sprinkle the remaining goat cheese on top. I just added it all to the sauce.

I was really nervous serving this at a dinner party without having tried it first. The goat cheese almost made me go with something else. However, this came out delicious and was almost as big a hit as the spiced roast beef with herb shallot sauce (that was beyond compare).

This is a delicious variation on basic scalloped potatoes! I served it at Thanksgiving with glazed ham and all 16 guests loved it. Several asked for the recipe.

This recipe was wonderful. I made it along with my normal cheese potatoes for a dinner party. The guests were known to not go for "different" cheeses. Needless to say, this recipe was gone long before my "normal" cheese potato dish.

A wonderful recipe that never fails to please. It has done well with glazed ham and lamb. I have passed on the recipe several times. I find there is a tendancy to dryness if the foil is removed after 15 minutes. I do the opposite. Leave the foil on for 40 minutes and take it off for the remaining 20 minutes.

I have made this for both sides of my family, accompanied by a pork loin roast. My family, who love just about everything imediately asked for the recipe. The real shock was that my inlaws who have very little adventure raved about it as well

I was VERY apprehensive about the goat cheese in this recipe, but ended up LOVING it! I made the potatoes to go with the tenderloin as recommended and they complemented each other well. I think that the next time I make these, I'll put all the cheese in at the same time (in the sauce) instead of some at the end. I couldn't find the herbs de Provence, so I used an all-purpose herb mix that was similar. Really loved the mild creamy taste of the goat cheese!
