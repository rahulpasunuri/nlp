This is lovely, lovely, lovely!! I broiled the fish and it turned out wonderfully. I make the Caesar Vinaigrette at least once a week. If I don't use it all on a salad, you can catch me in the kitchen dunking french bread in the remains. Delicious!

I used honey instead of the dark brown sugar. Unfortunately, I did not read the reviews to lessen the pepper. If you make this recipe, that is the single most important tip you can take away from the reviews. Otherwise, this is an easy recipe to prepare and it plates up beautifully. I did add parmesan shavings to the salad as previously recommended. The tuna is superb.

Watch the 2 mins per side. The tuna coks FAST! My wife said it tasted like teriyaki beef jerky!

The first time I made it we found that the tuna was too peppery. Reduce the pepper, you still have that spiciness which the caesar takes away (I'd reduce the amount of oil used in this). Fantastic either bbq-ed or on the stove top with a gridle.

An excellent way to grill tuna--a new staple in our kitchen. Definitely make the ceasar salad to go with it!

Fantastic recipe. Be careful not to overcook the tuna, which cooks quickly, and also don't overdo the peppercorn crust if you reduce the recipe. My husband and I had quite a spicy tuna salad!

This was delicious and so easy! It took just a few minutes to whip up the dressing and the marinade. I didn't have anchovies but it was fine. I also reduced the amount of olive oil, and next time would add a bit less lemon juice. But the superb taste for such little effort was amazing - great recipe!

I had a single serving of tuna, and, with the few ingredients this salad calls for, was able to enjoy a tasty salad. I didn't think it was a "dish beyond compare". It was certainly quick and easy to make, healthy and tasty. I used some wasabi mustard in the dressing and cut back on the lemon juice, as other reviewers suggested. The salad ingredients are pretty meagre, so I added some tomato and red onions, plus some Parmesan shavings. I would make it again, and think I'll try the maple syrup suggested by another reviewer next time.

Have made this dish a number of times and the diners always rave. Please do not overcook the tuna. Excellent.

Excellant as a lunch or light snack. I served the tuna without the salad, and it was perfect!

Fantastic as written. I will make this again.

This was outstanding, one of the best seafood recipes on this site. I was afraid that all that pepper would be overwhelming, but it was perfect, somehow becoming more mellow as it grilled and in conjunction with the soy sauce and brown sugar. The salad dressing obviously is not a true Caesar, but it is tasty nonetheless. I used romaine lettuce to make it a bit more like a Caesar salad. As excellent as all this was, I disagree with the wine suggestion, as unless tuna is overcooked, I think it goes better with red wine than with white. In this case, due to the pepper, I served it with a pinot noir, although I think it would also go well with a Sonoma zinfandel.

The quality of the tuna is what's gonna make or break this dish. The marinade is excellent. I used fillets from freshly caught tuna and let them soak for about an hour, then fired 'em up on the grill. I used the dressing from An Even Greater Caesar's Salad, also from this site, the absolute best caesar's dressing I've ever had. Will try this marinade on yellowtail next time.

Guess I'll join the bandwagon on this one. Every once in awahile, my husband will tell me that this is one of his favories. I use my own dressing recipe that is the best caesar dressing I have EVER had.

Very quick and easy recipe. I let the tuna marinate for an hour or so in the shoyu mixture and pan sear instead of grilling. I put the peppercorns in a resealable bag and pound with a mallet. I also add shaved parmesano reggiano for a nice touch. We generally prefer beef and a starch for dinner but this has become a regular for us.

The overall impact was just too much for us being used to fine quality grilled tuna. I should have paid more attention to all of the reviewers changing the receipe before I made this one.

I replaced the brown sugar for locally made maple syrup and WOW what a fabulous tuna! Lovely on fresh baby spinach instead of mixed spring greens as well. Note: 100% REAL maple syrup, not Aunt Jemima's or whatever. Gigantic difference.

I love this recipe. It is so easy and yet very tasty. My husband works late hours and this was perfect for a quick dinner that didn't sit heavy in our stomachs.

There's not much to be said about this recipe that hasn't already been said - it is fantastic and easy. It is very much an impressive casual dinner for a nice summer evening with guests and a feisty white wine on the deck. Is there anyone who found a truly outstanding wine pairing on this? We have yet to find the perfect compliment. Definitely willing to continue the quest... ;) I would mention to those new to working with peppercorns that if you don't have a mortar and pestle, you can put them in a coffee grinder or mini-processor and they are soooo great compared to getting them pre-cut from the store.

The tuna is a great mixture of sweet from the sugar and spicy from the pepper - but I would experiment with different dressings - that part was tasty but not standout.

Simple & outstanding mix of flavors on a caesar salad. My husband & I have this probably every other week. We love it!

Great and easy recipe. I would put less peppercorns next time, it was too spicy and I love spicy food. My bf devoured it, thought it was a restaurant quality dish.

I found this recipe easy and delicious! I added a couple of extra anchovies to the top of the salad and some shaved parm. reggiano cheese. We love tuna,and with the dressing drizzled over top,you won't miss the wasabi!!!

Easy, attractive and delicious. Great for busy nights as well as company. Add halved grape tomatoes and anchovies (for anchovie lovers). Great the next day cold with thin sliced red onion. Have made this several times. A real winner.

I made this recipe for my husband and I and it was fantastic and sooo easy to prepare. Quick and company worthy presentation. You must drizzle the vinaigrette over the tuna before serving.

I've made this delicious dish twice now, both times to rave reviews. It's definitely been added to my regular repertoire of recipes. I served it with toasted sourdough bread as suggested but topped the bread with chopped and seeded tomatoes, fresh basil, olive oil and salt and pepper. What a great summertime dish!

So easy and incredible! Just like an appetizer we often order at restaurants. We left it sushi-rare on the inside and it was amazing. Will definitely make this on a regular basis, especially for guests.

For a dish that takes so little effort, it's a winner. I pan-fried rather than grilled the tuna (for about 3 minutes) and it still tasted delicious.

I made this salad Saturday for a cookout, with the sun dried tomato burgers and the grilled corn with chipotle butter. It was a real bon Appetit party! I made the salad with raspberry vinaigrette instead of caesar dressing since it is a more summery salad. It was terrific!

This is a great recipe. It is now one of our favorite summer meals.

I used swordfish in place of tuna. Swordfish can be very dry but this method made the moistest swordfish. The dressing was awesome.

Delicious! Adjusted the recipe for two servings and it was fantstic. The tuna was awesome and the dressing is very good-I will use it for other salads as well.
