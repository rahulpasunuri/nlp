I made my first batch per written recipe, except - used a combo of white corn syrup & molasses since my boyfriend didn't have any dark corn syrup on hand......and I semi-melted the butter by mistake trying to get it to soften faster (not intended). I let logs refrigerate for 3 days, then sliced by 1/4 inch, sprinkled sugar and baked between 10 & 12 minutes per batch. Spectacular! Not sure which change kept them chewy, but they were and we all loved them!

Lovely, I mixed the dough the night before, chilled them as logs and cut them up and baked them the next day making sure I didn't burn them. One of the two best cookies from Christmas.

Wow..... Haven't baked them but the cookie dough is unbelievable!

I make these cookies weekly for my gingersnap loving husband. We were buying commercial cookies till we realized high much sodium was in them. These can be made with no salt at all (though I do add about 1/4 t.). Like a lot of other reviewers, I use molasses instead of corn syrup--it just gives it more flavor. I also use a lot more fresh gingerroot and add chopped crystallized ginger so mine are very gingery cookies. As others have said, it's really important to chill these cookies for at least 24 hours. I've cooked them with less chilling time and they just aren't as good. It's definitely worth the wait for the taste to mature. After eating these both my spouse and my grandkids swore off the store bought ones.

I made these for my father-in-law last Christmas and he was floored by how good they were. He wouldn't even share! I did use molasses for the corn syrup and took other reviewer's advice to use crystallized ginger and brown sugar (1 1/4 cups). Amazingly delicious!

hi WildMushroom - they're gingersnaps, so they are designed to get super crispy right away - try the soft ginger cookie recipes for cookies that stay soft.

Wow Ginger! This cookie is pretty delicious. I've just continued to bake them at every opportunity since making the batter. That sleepover in the fridge is important (prior to that, it seemed like the ginger would be overpowering). I just wonder, and perhaps you experienced bakers out there can tell me, how I can get this cookie to retain its softness a bit longer. It becomes british-biscuit like rather fast.

Very easy and very tasty. Based on other reviewers I too substitued 1/4 c. of raw sugar for granulated sugar, and molasses for dark corn syrup; and I threw in some chopped crystalized ginger. My only concern was that I was making it for a cookie swap and needed 60 cookies. Recipe said it would make 80. I literally used a yardstick, measured my logs and sliced into 1/4 inch thickness. I just barely made 64 cookies, and that was with slicing some of them thinner just to make certain I got 60 cookies. Will definitly make again.

These were yummy but I prefer the Ginger Spice cookie recipe from this site. I will make them again however.

Wow, what a great cookie! My husband is Swedish and gingersnaps (pepparkakor) are one of his favorites. He likes them crisp and this recipe fit the bill with a few changes: I substituted 1/4 cup of turbinado sugar for 1/4 cup of the granulated sugar, used "Gourmet Garden" ginger spice blend in the squeeze tube for the gingerroot (I didn't have gingerroot on hand, but this worked well), and substituted dark molasses for the dark corn syrup. For crisp, flatter cookies, I cut them in 1/8" slices. Because I live at high altitude (8200 feet), I baked them at 375F for 11-12 minutes using insulated cookie sheets lined with parchment paper. Great results the first time!

I am still searching for recipe for the greatest gingersnap cookie I have ever had. I am a perfectionist so I changed this a bit. Used the molasses and brown sugar and crystallized ginger and lots of cayenne - I like it hot and spicy. I like it to look perfect rather than cut it from the roll I roll it out very thin (on sugar- both side so does not stick) and cut with 1 1/2 inch cookie cutter so perfect circle and bake. They look beautiful and can't keep them away from my family.

best ginger cookie i have ever tasted. i exchanged sweet molasses for the karo syrup and i added finely chopped candied ginger(can buy at world market or even grocery store) just fabulous cookies and have given them for gifts with rave reviews. the amount of candied ginger is to your taste. i added a generous 1/3 cup to dough. heavenly.

Just love this recipe. The last time I made it I melted the butter first and found it much easier to mix the ingredients and form the logs. The cookies turned out great and were softer and spread more in the pan.

A surprisingly delicate tasting cookie for so many spices. I substituted molasses for the corn syrup, aded some salt and used salted butter. Next time I shall use way more brown sugar and will try the cayenne pepper. I love the technique: no more rolling little balls of dough around in sugar!

These are a family favorite. I make them every year for a cookie swap and of course to keep for us, but I substitute dark molasses for the corn syrup.

Rating: 4
These cookies are excellent. I have found my best success when substituting brown sugar and adding a dash of cayenne pepper (per previous suggestions). The cookies taste better with each passing day and the convenience of being able to refrigerate the dough and bake them as needed is fabulous. Thanks for such a great recipe!

I basically used huberh's variations plus I added approximately 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper. Spicy! Best ginger snap recipe ever!

This is a great recipe and I have made these many times with great results (and great comments!) I normally add extra orange juice (I just don't measure it, I normally squeeze a half of an orange or a whole tangerine if that is what I have on hand to get the zest from), I use chopped, crystallized giner instead of fresh, and have used both molasses and dark corn syrup with great results. This dough refrigerates great and I normally roll it into a log and chill it in waxed paper, then slice the log (as indicated) and roll each slice into a ball, put on the baking sheet and sprinkle with sugar. I do not flatten the balls. These stay slightly soft if kept in an air tight container - though they rarely last more than a few days around my house!

I've made these before and they're wonderful but they're even more wonderful with the following changes: substitute molasses for the corn syrup, omit orange juice and zest and substitute 1 T. water, substitute 1 1/4 cups firmly packed brown sugar (I didn't have white in the house and it turned out so flavorful), add 1/2 c. chopped crystallized ginger to the wet ingredients. I also added an extra teaspoon dry ginger and doubled the fresh ginger. I rolled tablespoon size scoops of dough tinto balls. If you're going to roll them in sugar, making ginger sugar is especially nice-Grate fresh ginger into about 1/2 c. of white sugar. Shake, meld for a day or so (or use right away) then strain and roll the cookie dough before flattening the balls. An excellent ginger experience.

I select recipes from this site based on reviews, boy was I mislead on this one! We love zesty ginger cookies, but my batch of cookies tasted more like the orange zest than ginger even though I added more ground ginger, candied ginger and fresh ginger root. Worst, there is way too much butter in this. Most disappointed.

Perfect gingersnaps--taste exactly how they should. I did not find that the fresh ginger gave the cookies a super-strong ginger taste--just right.

Very good gingersnaps. Use molasses instead of dark corn syrup. A winner!

These cookies are absolutely divine. I used lemon instead of orange and I can't imagine anything better. The fresh ginger does it!

Excellent - I'm going to try to freeze one of the logs so I can always make some for tea. Cookies came out crunchy with just a little bit of chewy-ness. I added chopped crystallized ginger per the other reviews.

I too added 1 cup of chopped candied ginger and it really added a nice burst of flavor in each cookie. Grating the fresh ginger was a bit of a challenge since I was working with a small piece, but it was worth it. Makes a large batch, easy to work with.

I made these for my 82-year-old ginger-loving grandmother and she said these were the best she'd ever had. I agree! I used tangerine for the orange- a sweet subsitution I would use again.

wonderful recipe. the second time I varied it by using a small amt. of orange marmalde,about 3 tsp, and apricot preserves, about 3 tbsp. and made some juice by adding about 2 tbsp. water. I deleted the orange juice and orange peel . the results were even more delicious.my family loved them both.

This is a wonderful recipe. I add 1 cup of Australian cristalized ginger to the recipe so every so often you get a piece it - delicious! I keep the logs in the fridge and bake them fresh every day. Everybody loves them.

My son LOVES these cookies. I replace the corn syrup with molasses to darken the colour and add a bit more flavour. I also roll them and cut out shapes for more kid-interest too!

I was asked to make ginger snaps by a coworker who says they are his favorite type of cookie. This recipe, he said, was the best he ever had. I didn't have time to let them cool all night, so I stuck them in the freezer for an hour, then the fridge for 2 hours. Still excellent.

I am a personal chef and a client asked me to bake 5 dozen gingersnap cookies for a cookie swap that she was going to (She LOVED them), I had left over dough so I baked some for another client. The other client asked me to make them again because they loved them so much! Time consuming, but well worth it.

I LOVE these cookies!! And so has everyone for which I've made them. I add a pinch more of all the spices to give it some zip. They've become my specialty. Even my 18 year old step-son raved about them. Now that's saying something!

Plenty of ginger in this recipe!

This is the only sufficiently gingery gingersnap recipe I've ever encountered. Hurrah! I would, however, recommend slicing them thinner than 1/4-inch for the true gingersnap texture; otherwise, they tend to be a little soft in the middle.

These are definitely winners. Be sure, though, to note that they are to be spaced out on the pan. They spread out quite alot during the baking time. I served mine on the side of creme caramels, and the guests seemed quite content.

A wonderful ginger cookie. I substituted molasses for the karo syrup and pressed the cookies into a dish of coarse sugar for the top. The large sugar grains sparkle a little and give the cookies a nice crunch - they are available through The Baker's Catalog.

Gingersnaps are my mothers favorite cookie so I wanted to make some for her birthday. I found this recipe and started to make them. I didnt realize I had to make the dough and refrigerate for hours and hours,so instead I improvised. I put in the freezer for 1/2 hour and sliced after that. They came out great. My mom loved them and I will definately make again. Good dunking cookies.

My kids (who have never really liked any cookie other than Toll House) said they were the best cookies they've ever had and asked me to a batch on hand at all times. They even love the name! I've been keeping a log rolled up in wax paper in the fridge at all times to slice off and bake (We make the cookies fairly large). Once I accidentally left out the corn syrup and they were still terrific - just different. Thanks, Bubbee.

Rating: 4
Excellent because they don't become soggy when it is humid, and they freeze superbly. A much easier way to make them is to keep the dough in a bowl, refrigerate for a day or two, then dig out small amounts - a heaping teaspoon for small cookies, straight from the bowl, a cookie at a time, to the cookie sheet. Forming the logs is messy, because the dough is very soft and the end results are identical.

These cookies were easy to make and the fresh gingerroot and orange zest and juice gave them a very fresh flavor. They are crisp without being hard. Kids love them
