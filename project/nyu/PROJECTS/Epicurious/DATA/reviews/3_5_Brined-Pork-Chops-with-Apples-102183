Whoops, sorry, folks, I was reviewing another recipe -- squash rings with curry and apples.

Rating: 3
Made this last night and since I'm not a huge curry fan, went with the Chinese five spice (and Craisins rather than currents) that another reviewer suggested. Very good and a great way to use squash. May make it again tomorrow for friends.

I was looking for a recipe to use after a weekend visiting apple orchards for a weekend. This recipe was amazing. I was a bit worried that the sauce might come out a little sweet, since my husband hates sweet sauces with meat, but it was perfect! I used cranberries instead of raisins , and brined the pork for 3 days, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I will make this again.

Great Recipe! I did not have brandy so I had to leave that out, and I substituted dried cranberries for the raisins. This recipe was delicious!

Sorry. Forgot the forks.

I've used this recipe many times, but only once with the sauce. I find the meat too good to cover. Always used Kosher salt and thick chops (must ask butcher). Was a little salty once when I didn't rinse. Usually sear chops then finish in oven.

Delicious! and really not all that much work. I, too, was hesitant about the mustard but it really adds depth. Made a great fall dinner with butternut squash.

Rating: 3
Prepared as written. I brined the pork for 15hrs and had no trouble with saltiness, but my pork was still kinda chewy. Possibly an error in my ability to sear and simmer that did it? The onion/apple/raisin business was fantastic. My guests loved the sauce. Would definitely make again, but might tinker with my pork cooking process.

I am not a huge fan of pork chops, and I wanted something that would tenderize the meat. This recipe really fit the bill - Easy to prepare, and a huge hit with everyone, including the kids. I followed the recipe exactly, except omitted the onion, as I discovered at the last minute that I was out! I marinated for 24 hours, and did not find the meat overly salty.

I brined both pork chops and chicken breasts, separately. And prepared both per the recipe. Both were very tender and delicious. I plan to experiment with brining and hope to incorporate that step into many other recipes.

Delicious - I used a pork tenderloin vs. chops. I also left out the mustard in the sauce - this was a hit! A perfect fall dish.

Rating: 3
this was a very nice fall dish. I did make some changes due to what I had on hand. I used pork tenderloins (cut into 3inch portions) that I didn't brine since they were already packaged in solution. I brushed them with cidervinegar and dijon then browned them in a skillet. Followed the recipe for the apples, added some sliced fennel for extra bite. I did this all about an hour before my dinner guests came. When they arrived I popped the whole thing into a 350 oven for 25 minutes to finish it. Great not to have to stand over a stove when friends are visiting. Served with garlic mashed and roasted broccoli. A keeper.

This was an excellent recipe. Such a perfect fall meal accompanied by sweet potatoes and braised cabbage. I made it with fat free half and half.

We are chop fans here and this recipe fit the bill. Dfntly worth the fixin time.

Rating: 4
Found this recipe to be excellent all around. I only made half the amount of brine and soaked for about 4 hours. No issue with salt. Served it with sweet potatoe mash and a salad of wild greens, fresh apple, and blue cheese. A fruity merlot helped bring out the flavor complexities of the dish. I was hesitant about the mustard, but the small amount really does add something special without being overwhelming.

I'm not as big a carnivore as my husband but I loved this dish. My toddler gobbled it up too! DEFINITELY use kosher salt. Mortons or other brands of table salt will cause the dish to be much too salty. Kosher (and sea) salt have less saltiness (sodium) per gram so you can use more. I put the pork chops in the brine 24 hours before I planned to eat them but then took them out of the brine and patted them dry a little after about 10 hours (less work in the morning). Definitely didn't notice any excessive saltiness. Keep in mind that for those wanting to soak overnight, you can put less salt in and soak longer (have done this with the thanksgiving turkey for years!).

Another great recipe along these lines is Cider-Brined Pork with Apples and Creamed Leeks: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/105545 Simple and delicious.

Rating: 3
Made this for a dinner party and I got rave reviews. I was worried about the salt given the prior reviews, so I cut the amount of salt down to 1/3 cup and brined it for only about 10 hours. It came out delicious - moist and juicy and almost ham-like in texture. Served it with roasted red potatoes. I'm guessing that the thickness of the pork chops is important. Most stores do not sell chops as thick as the recipe calls for, so I asked my butcher to cut them for me.

This dish is delish-enjoyed the creamed leeks, also. The combination -leeks,brined pork and brandied apples almost melted in the mouth. It was not hard to make, but extremely impressive for company.

never brined before and this was wonderful-- pork can sometimes seem dry, not so with the brine-- had wonderful flavor of the apples.

Rating: 4
absolutely delicious. brined the pork for 2 days. rinsed in a bowl of water before patting dry. as soon as it hit the pan, the kitchen smelled like delicious apple goodness. served vertically with garlic mashed potatoes and fresh-baked bread.

I was a little hesitant to make this based on the diverse mix of reviews but it turned out fine. I used kosher salt for the exact amount called for, brined for 1+ day and did not find it salty at all. I will definitely make again, though maybe scaling back on the cinnamon in the brine...a smidge too much for my personal taste.

The toppoings where good, but my pork was totally tough! I followed the directions to a T. Won't make again

Absolutely wonderful recipe. Could that be a typo on the amount of salt? I only used enough to season (didn't have kosher salt) and it came out wonderful. My fiancè didn't care for the fruit/meat combination, but everyone else loved it. Will definitely make again.

Terrific!!! We loved this dish. I used pork tenderloin, marinated 10hrs. I will marinate it longer next time. Rinse and dry pork, rub with Paul Prudhommes Pork Magic. After browning I cut the tenderloin in 3-4 inch slices. Cooked to pink and then slicing in serving size. My husband is still talking about this wonderful dish. That was my review from 10/18/02. Last week I had 70 women over for a Spring Luncheon. Used tenderloins. Same recipe. Same GREAT response!

Pork (not the sauce) was too salty (I used Kosher salt). I brined for 4 hours (minimum suggested in recipe). The sauce was not salty so know it was the brining solution. Have other brining solutions that do not contribute so much salt to the pork.

Rating: 3
Yummy. Left in brine for approx. 6 hours, then rinsed. Not salty at all. The chops didn't come to temperature as quickly as the recipe reads, but it could have been user error. Will make again, and may experiment with leaving out the cream. Any suggestions?

I halved the recipe for the brine and it worked fine. The meat really absorbed the brine and had a nice "appley" flavor!

Made this simple and delicious dish for Christmas eve dinner. It will most certainly become part of my repertoire. I brined the chops for approx. 8 hours, and they were tender and juicy as could be.

Very good. Not spectacular and brining the chops is time consuming and probably not worth it, however everyone liked it.

Made this yesterday for 10, so I doubled the recipe. It was a great success. I did rinse the brine before cooking. Also made minor substitutions: dried cranberries instead of raisins, mcintosh instead of granny smith apples, fresh sage rather than dried. Enjoyed thoroughly.

Rating: 4
previous reviews indicated this recipe could be salty so I did not add as much salt. They were perfect. I loved the apples. Next time, I would double the amount of apples. I did not have apple brandy or Calvados so I added plain brandy and they were still great. My family is not a fan of pork chops and they really liked these. Definately a dish I would serve to company.

Rating: 4
OUTSTANDING! We love the combination of pork and apples. The brining was perfect. But yes, I have learned you must use Kosher Salt. I did as recommended by previous cooks and rinsed the pork chops. I also only brined 4 hours. The flavors were perfect....will now plan a dinner for guests using this receipe. Also noted, it did take a little longer to get the pork to the right temp. than 6 min.

Delicious! I doubled the recipe for a dinner party, and so found that the timing was off - everything took longer, of course, but well worth the effort. Everyone asked for the recipe!

I have made this dish since it first came out in Bon Appetit, and it is always great, never too salty. I do use Kosher salt as many cook recommended. I also use very thick pork chops.

The sauce was very delicious, but the pork was just too salty! We couldn't finish it. It was such a shame because it was really tender and juicy and the sauce was so yummy, but it was just too salty to eat. I was forwarned about the saltiness, and as per other reviewers, I used kosher salt and thoroughly rinsed before cooking, but the salt was in the meat, not on it. I've brined whole turkeys before (Cooks Illustrated, very wonderful) and that recipe states (for a whole turkey) never to brine more than eight hours, no matter how big the bird is. Well, this recipe said brine up to two days, which I did, and that may be why it's too salty. I will definately try this dish again, but will only brine for 2-3 hours. Will let you know how it turns out.

Very good pork recipe. I hunt and fish alot and smoke my own foods. When brining fish or meat don't reduce the salt required. Instead use kosher salt and always, always rinse with cold fresh water after brining or dry curing and pat dry before cooking or smoking.

Rating: 2
I'm no stranger to brining meat - I subscribe to Cook's Illustrated and they are obsessed with the concept - but this particular brine was far too salty. We liked the flavors of apple, raisins and ginger, but this recipe was too much work for just a so-so dinner.

I use the brine for all of my pork dishes (grilled pork chops, smoked pork tender, babyback ris) I also add a little DR Pepper to tenderize the meat

The pork should be *rinsed* after it is brined and before it is cooked. This will reduce the saltiness without compromising the brining effect.

Rating: 0
I noticed many complained of it being too salty. When brining you should use Kosher salt. Add it and the seasonings to HOT water to draw the flavour out of the seasonings. Then you have to let it cool completely before adding the meat. I sit it in the fridge for an hour of so. When using common table salt, by all means, use less.

This is a keeper. Moist, tasty and easy. I put in in my recipe box and will make it again!

I loved this recipe -- very elegant and tasteful. I too decreased the salt amount to about 1 tablespoon and it was just fine. Great presentation too -- looks fancier than it really is.

I goofed. I tried to make the dish in advance of my company coming, and while sitting in the warm over waiting to be served, it got ruined. The pork was overdone, and dry. I'll try this recipe again when I don't need to make it ahead of serving time. By the way, my parents (the brisket lovers) loved the dinner. It was right up their alley and they took home the leftovers. My husband and I could barely eat it. But I will try again.

My husband really liked this dish. I thought it was o.k. It does make a good use of the apples and cider I always seem to have around this time of year. I didn't think it was too salty. I use kosher salt -- that may be the secret.

This dish was excellent! The only adjustment I made was to drastically reduce the amount of salt called for. It seemed to me that 1/2 cup of salt is excessive. I used 1/8 cup and it turned out great.

I was looking on line for a recipe for stuffed pork chops, came across this, so I tried to adapt it. Given the time, I would have opted for the brining process, but instead I combined the recipe ingredients, minus the salt and cream (season to taste) stuffed the cavity of 2" pork chops with the apples, raisins and gorgonzola cheese and braised the thing, covered, for an hour and fifteen minutes in a 325 oven, adding the cheese in the last fifteen muinutes. I'd do it again, but I'm not that much of a pork fan. The secret to pork is slow cooking at a lower temperature for a longer cooking time.

Surprisingly excellent recipe and elegant in presentation. I would serve this dish at any formal dinner party. My husband commented, "I normally don't like pork but this is excellent!" The ultimate compliment.

The first time I used a pork tenderloin instead of porkchops and it turned out wonderful, the second time I made it with porkchops..it turned out way too salty. I think the thicker the cut of the meat you use the better. But the sauce is delicious.

This was a great dish. Easy to make. Great for a special occasion. Most can be readied ahead and then put together, so you can spend time with your guests. Great with Pumpkin dumplings.

This was great, but I tried a major variation because I was pressed for time. I prepared the brine and let the pork chops marinade for 2 hours. Next, I sprinkled onion and garlic seasonings on the chops and threw them on the grill. Omited the rest of the recipe, but the chops were terrific!
