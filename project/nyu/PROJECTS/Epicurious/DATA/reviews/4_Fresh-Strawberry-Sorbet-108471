Very good and strawberry!! Next time I make this as a ice pop for the kids, instead of buying the fruit bars.

Easy, tasty. Used less sugar mixture and added more lemon for more tang. Would have been nice with lemon zest too.

This is a wonderful sorbet and it's a snap to make. Next time I might add a little more lemon juice to give some tang.

This was such an easy and and refreshing sorbet! I was really suprosed by how creamy the texture was! The orange juice was not noticeable but it really helped with the consistancy. Wonderful and easy dish. I followed it to the T EXCEPT for adding less of the sugar mixture.

EXCELLENT! Combined some suggestions of others - used lime juice instead of lemon juice, a bit less sugar, less orange juice and added orange zest..and added a splash of orange liqueur. Light and delicious - a great way to top off 4th of July party!

Very nice indeed! I like to add a little orange zest and about 1/4 C. of Grand Marnier, also. Since I don't have an ice cream freezer, I freeze it in an 8" cake pan until firm, then return to a food processor to whip it up. Return to the cake can and re-freeze. Makes for a bit little, arier sorbet.

Loved this - a nice light dessert. I added a bit of orange zest, so next time I would reduce the amount of oj

Loved it - will definitely make again, but will cut back some on the sugar syrup or add additional lemon. Found it just a little too sweet. Check out the cantaloupe sorbet on this website, too -- heavenly!

I made this dessert for my girlfriend for Valentine's Day (she loves strawberries), and she said it was heaven. Very simple to make, and an easy way to impress your date!

This was very refreshing. I used half strawberries half raspberries. I also just froze the mix in a pan which worked well. I wish berries were in season year round, just so I could make this!
