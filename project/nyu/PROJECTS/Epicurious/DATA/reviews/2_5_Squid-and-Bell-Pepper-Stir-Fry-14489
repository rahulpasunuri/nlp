Not bad... I added snow peas. I think I might add some chile flakes and ginger next time to add a little heat. I would make it again.

I just wasn't too sure about this recipe. I think it tasted better the second day when I had it for lunch. The sesame seeds and oil are the stars in this dish. I added four tbsp. of seeds and I think the more the better.

Maybe I went wrong somewhere, but I had to toss this out. It was not only bland, it was actually inedible. It was really sad to have to waste perfectly good squid like that, but blech! I have no suggestions for how to fix this recipe, except DON'T.

Very good recipe. I used 1/4 cup of the rice vinegar. The sesame oil and the sesame seeds make this recipe.

I bought fresh squid and shrimp at the wet market in the morning and served this dish with Shrimp Fried Rice (Gourmet April 1998) and stir-fried spinach with garlic and oyster sauce for dinner. A real treat!

Squid doesn't work in this recipe- shrimp or scallops would be better.
