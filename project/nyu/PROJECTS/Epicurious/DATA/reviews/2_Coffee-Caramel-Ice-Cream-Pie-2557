The combination of ingredients sounded great but I needed a jack-hammer to slice the pie. The carmel also hardened to the thickness of a World War II helmet!! I've found far better recipes with results which did not require my electric knife.

The only "problem" with this recipe was that the melted chips on the bottom of the crust made it very hard to cut the pie to serve. Otherwise it was really yummy. I used ben and jerry's vanilla instead of coffee (allthough it would probably be really good with the coffee) and I also melted additional chips and drizzled them on top of the ice cream before freezing - it looked nice. This recipe was great because it was very easy to prepare in advance :-)
