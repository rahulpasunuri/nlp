That´s the problem with many veggie soups... i believe this recipe would be much much better if a good veal stock would have been used instead of veg. Even chicken stock would have made a difference...

I agree with the other reviewers that the recipe as written isn't worth making again. But, I looked at a lot of other Rick Bayless recipes and got this to "very good" by adding the following: 1 tablespoon sugar, juice of 2 key limes (about 5 teaspoons), 2 teaspoons cider vinegar, ½ teaspoon dried thyme (not ground), ½ teaspoon dried Mexican oregano, crumbled, and 2 bay leaves I didn't add any salt at all because the vegetable broth that I was able to buy already had more than the 4200 mg. of sodium that would come from the 1¾ teaspoons of sugar. If you don't need a vegetarian dish, you can ge a greater depth of flavor by using homemade turkey stock.

An update: much better the second day, and with the addition of some leftover sauteed bell pepper and portobellos, and some balsamic vinegar. But still not worth the effort.

The flavor lacked depth - it tasted like it was missing something. I actually checked the recipe to make sure I hadn't left anything out. We ended up putting in some crushed pineapple that happened to be on the table (don't ask), and even that was an improvement. It was OK, but not worth the effort as written.

Very good but not as great as I expected. Although I'm not a big meat eater, I thought this begged for a little topping of shredded chicken, beef or even turkey. I strained the first batch of puree but found it was more of a nuisance. The second batch I pureed until very smooth and that turned out fine. As is, it's a nice, healthy fall meal.
