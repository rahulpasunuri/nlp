We made this dish to the letter. The presentation was bland at best. The taste...kind of boring. For the work of deboning the legs, pounding the meat, making the compote....the end result is not worth a bit of the effort.

This dish was an amazingly huge success. You could cut it with a fork it was sooo tender. It was alot of work to debone the legs, in the future I would ask the butcher to do it.
