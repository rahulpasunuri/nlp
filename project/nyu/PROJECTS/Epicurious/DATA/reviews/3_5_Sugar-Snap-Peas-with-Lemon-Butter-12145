This recipe is to die for! I never knew that I could like peas this much. If you can use organic, and I wanted extra lemon taste so I added some of the juice as well. Fabulous!

Delicious, simple meal that I make at least once a week. I use no more then 1/2 Tbsp butter, softened and mixed with the peel from one meyer lemon. The end result always highlights the freshness of the sugar snap peas, without overwhelming them. Another tastey alternative would be 1/2 tbsp of lemon-infused olive oil, perhaps with an additional bit of lemon zest on top. When I come home starving and do not want to wait for my dinner, I toss in a chicken apple sausage and make the entire meal as one serving.

I liked it ok, but the butter left to much oil...and I didn't taste as much lemon as I expected. Maybe I'll try again with less butter and more lemon.

We made this recipe with frozen sugar snap peas for Thanksgiving. It was a bright addition to the usual starchy veggies. I can't wait to try it with fresh sugar snaps in the spring- so easy!

This is a good, simple recipe. I would cook the peas just a little longer and add more lemon zest and maybe some fresh lemon juice. All in all, a simple, easy, quick recipe.

Good way to quickly cook these peas. My children loved them. I would suggest a bit more lemon.
