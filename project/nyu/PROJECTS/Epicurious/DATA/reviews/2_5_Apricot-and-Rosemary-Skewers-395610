Saw a pretty display of apricots the day after I read this recipe - so had to give it a try. Subbed Amaretto for the peach liqueur and broiled them rather than light the grill just for dessert. I liked the aroma of roasting rosemary and these looked very nice. Simple to make, the sauce reduced in about 15 minutes. They did however taste a bit strong - a little harsh on the throat. I served vanilla ice cream with them which helped, but I'd recommend a glass of water too. I may make this again with apricots but will definitely try it with peaches.

Does anyone have more information on how to cook this recipe? I'm assuming you grill these but it just say cook over high heat. Also do you brush the apricots with syrup as you are cooking?
