I had a guest on Christmas Eve who can not eat chocolate. A Buche de Noel is a tradition so I was pleased to find this recipe. It turned out great. Followed as written. My husband asked me to make sure I did not donate leftovers to care packages we sent home with guests.

made this recipe and, granted i did make a few adjustments to a few of the proportions, it was absolutely fantastic. made it for my class and everyone died for it. HIGHLY recommend this recipe.

I should really give this three forks because my mother absolutely loved this but it wasn't my favorite. The cake was good, but the frosting's big taste sort of overwhelmed it.

This is a good cake - I gave it an extra fork because it worked so well. The cake rolled up nicely without breaking, it froze well so I could do all but the icing ahead of Christmas dinner, and it's a nice change from chocolate yule logs. It is sweet - think carrot cake. And with some imagination - bundling the orange rind to look like pine needles, chocolate shavings, powdered pistachio or edible glitter - it makes a pretty, snowy looking log. Since I was doing it ahead, I needed a crumb coat and used thinned Nutella which looked pretty under the light frosting. This is a good recipe that you can use to dress up your Christmas buffet.

I tried this for a change from our standard orange and chocolate version. My husband and I didn't care for this at all. The cake was bland and the frosting was very, very sweet. I like almost any dessert - and didn't finish my piece of this. Though we didn't like it our guest really enjoyed it so we sent her home with all of the leftovers. I highly recommend the Chocolate-Orange Buche de Noel that can be found on this site, instead of this one.

Absolutely wonderful variation on the chocolate yule log and not so rich. Not difficult to make but make it the day before your event, primarily to let the candied orange peel dry. Could cut down on the amount of frosting used which is also delicious.

This Orange Buche de Noel came out great. More cream cheese can be added to the frosting along with more orange juice, but other than that, delicious.

Takes time, but worth it. Have made the Buche De Noel in chocolate and it was great, this is even better. Will try Orange Chocolate Spice the next time.
