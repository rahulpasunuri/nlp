Wonderful!! Make sure to salt and pepper. I substituted Provolone for the Fontina & it got rave reviews.

I did not think this was "saucy" enough and found the flavor bland.

I really enjoy this recipe, the only change that I make is I add ham.

One word: AMAZING. Be prepared for the kick unless you tone down the cayenne, but I liked it.

I was underwhelmed by this dish. It presented beautifully, but was a bit bland, despite my use of expensive strong flavored cheeses. Too much nutmeg and cayenne for my taste. Some notes: Pasta sauce mixture will be VERY saucy when mixed, but it firmed up perfectly once baked. could not find directions for sourdough croutons, so I sliced 4 slices into tiny squares and baked. I then crumbled about 1/2 of the croutons, and added 1/4 cup chicken broth to moisten the mixture.

This disappeared from my guests plates. They had seconds and thirds. It was fantastic. I substituted one cup of dark beer for one of the cups of milk. It was fantastic!

One of the best I've had. Next time, I will reduce the cayenne and add bacon. A bit too hot for my taste, but a dab of sour cream on top made it just right. Brought it to work and everyone wanted some.

The best Macaroni & Cheese recipe I have found. I wouldn't change anything either.

Made this for our annual block party and it was a huge hit! (No changes to recipe.)
