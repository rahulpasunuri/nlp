I changed the filling completely to somwthing I had used before, marscapone cheese with a little stilton crumbles folded in. The syrup was much better than what I had previously used,and I think the marriage of the two recipes is fabulous.

I just made this dish but found it a bit bland like the other reviewer. Instead of serving it as a stand-alone item, I paired it with some roasted persimmons and candied tangerine slices, topping all with a reduced cranberry sauce. The tanginess of the cranberries helped to bring out the pear's natural flavor. Also, I substituted Forelle (sometimes spelt Fiorelle) pears for bosc, they have a firmer texture and are about 2/3 the size of a common pear, making the dessert a nice novelty item.

I was going to make this for Thanksgiving and gave it a trial run. The white wine combined with lemon juice is so light as to make the pear itself quite bland. I substituted guava paste for quince (where in the world do you find quince paste?). Overall, not a crowd pleaser. I think I will make for Thanksgiving but use Marsala wine, add cinnamon and double the vanilla. May even leave out the guava as it was quite sweet in conjunction with the syrup. I also tried to make the parmesan cloaks. No go. Will just use parmesan shavings or mascarpone. I do like the innovation though! Congrats!
