Retro and yummy! I made it just as directed with the exception of lime juice instead of lemon. After reading the other reviews, I made the dressing immediately before serving. Something this simple should not be this good!

I must be the voice of opposition. We did not like this recipe. I normally love Blue Cheese dressing, but this one had a weird flavor. Was it the lemon? The brand of mayo I used? I don't know. This tasted like exactly what it was, some mayo with lemon juice and tabasco with blue cheese chunks. Maybe I should have split the mayo with sour cream or yogurt. We ended up throwing it out. Very sad. Will keep looking.

My husband loves this.If you use light mayo DON'T make the dressing too far in advance as it ends up as lumpy runny disgustingness!

Same problem as another reviewer-I used light mayo and dressing was runny the next morning.Probably is somewhat pointless using light mayo with 1/2lb bacon and a cup of blue cheese but that is what I had!

This was awesome! Dressing was out of this world! Highly recommended.

I haven't bought or eaten iceberg lettuce in over a decade, but for some reason I had a mega craving for a wedge salad with blue cheese, so when I found this one with bacon (LOVE!), I just had to try it. This recipe is perfect. I wouldn't change a thing! The presentation is fabulous, it's super easy, reeeeally fast, and the flavours are wonderful. I'm not even a huge blue cheese fan, but the lemon juice in the dressing gave it an awesome kick. Will definitely make again!

REALLY good!! I used half low fat mayo and half lite sour cream and 1/2 teaspoon of tabasco. You can add as much blue cheese as you like. The dressing needed thinning so I used a little half and half that I had on hand. I sprinkled some chopped tomatoes over the top of each wedge. I agree that this outshines any store-bought version of blue cheese dressing.

I am so tired of subpar bottled blue cheese dressing....I just made this - did not thin it out....fabulous! I will never buy bottled again.... it's not only fresher but cheaper to make as well!

My husband and I absolutely love this dressing. I have made it twice and it has been delicious each time. I have sent a copy of this recipe to my friends and family.

This dressing didn't work for me, not sure why. I made it a day ahead of time, so it would be all ready for my Valentine's Day meal. When I got it out of the fridge to serve, it was very thin and runny, and I couldn't get it back to the perfect thickness it was the day before. Perhaps I shouldn't have used low-fat mayo. I also thought there was too much pepper, it was overpowering. By the next day, it was like lumpy water so we had to throw it away.

Really easy, delicious, and elegant. This is a great salad for a special occasion. As other reviewers have mentioned, even better with some sweet cherry tomatoes...I like to marinate mine.

So good and so easy...did not have lemon- so I used lime and it was terrific. I used the dressing as a component for buffalo chicken paninis.

My search is over for the perfect blue cheese dressing...have tried several from this site but until now nothing blew my socks off. My husband made dinner the other night and found this...voila! I'm not sure if it's the hot sauce that takes it up a notch, but whatever, it was so delicious that we had it 2 nights in a row. The only change I made was to use regular milk to thin it down a bit. I couldn't see the point in buying a quart of buttermilk that would go unused. Make this...a real winner. Oh, we also garnished with tomatoes.

This is where Iceberg lettuce shines! Such a simple salad to throw together with a few simple ingredients! I fried shallot rings in the bacon grease to give it a little extra something. The blue cheese dressing was excellent! I had no idea that there is truly nothing to it! My only mistake was not thinning it down further. It really thickens up after it is chilled. Instead of 2 tablespoons of liquid, I'd add at least 1/4 cup to thin it down some more. Got rave reviews by all around! We will be seeing more Iceberg lettuce in the future!

This is the best dressing ever for a wedge salad. Just work with add the buttermilk to get desired consistency. People are still talking about it.

Easy to make. I usually do not like bleu cheese but this one is a winner! Especially if you like a milder bleu cheese and can find Clemson Bleu Cheese. (Clemson, South Carolina) Click on their website and it will take you to the page where you can order this cheese.

We used a very high end routefort(sic) cheese and added a little buttermilk. This was so easy and so unbelievably delicous. Everyone said it was the best blue cheese dressing they ever had.

Yummy! This is back in style in a big way, and for good reason. The dressing and lettuce combo pairs really well with the crunchiness of the iceberg. I have also topped the wedge with a few diced tomatoes with great success. To "olivetwistful"... we eat this wedge using a fork and steak knife, just cutting into smaller pieces - but I think you'd still have a good salad with cut up the lettuce, if it's easier.

I have spent my adult life mocking iceberg lettuce. This recipe changed me--not because I think iceberg lettuce now tastes good, but the architecture of this salad enhances the overall event. Plus it tastes good. I took a cue from the low-cal world and replaced most (but not all) of the mayo with greek yogurt, and the dressing still tastes rich and tangy. For full disclosure, I made it for a Mad Men retro dinner party, but I can envision making this for less themed occasions.

I like this recipe because the ingredients were simple and it was easy to prepare, but it's not one that you want to be making too often unless you're trying to gain weight.

Very yummy, very easy and quick to make (the bacon should probably be done ahead of time--my boyfriend was cooking bacon for about 30 straight minutes). The crisp lettuce pairs perfectly with the dressing. But... how do you eat this? I made this as an hors d'oeuvre for a party and had guests at a loss for how to cut into the wedge and making a mess over their plates and faces. Perhaps this would be better as a simple (though less aesthetically interesting) salad of bits of iceberg rather than a full, ungainly wedge. Still, it drew a lot of compliments from dressing-coated lips.

Wonderful, reminds me of the 1950's but much better.Used water to thin out and small diced plum tomato. Hubby couldn't stop raving about the recipe. thanks

Excellent, but I would prepare the bacon ahead of time as it will slow down the rest of the meal. Make certain that the bacon is crismy.

very easy to make. I made it for my boyfriend who loves blue cheese. I'm not a fan of it; he said it was good. I used cream and a bit of half and half to thin it out.

My favorite posh restaurant serves an iceberg wedge with thick blue cheese dressing. I modified the dressing by adding cream and a bit of milk to thin. Also topped with a balsamic reduction. No onions or bacon, but did add some chopped cherry tomatoes. Beautiful and unique presentation. Everyone devoured. Served with stew. Lovely comfort food meal.

This was a super recipe. One of the things I find a little troubling about iceberg wedge salad is that it is rather plain - a wedge with some dressing drizzled on- but this recipe is really beautiful. The wedges look so wonderful with the salad dressing, onions and bacon - I added some small tiny tomaoes too. The taste was great and very refreshing. Everyone loved it!

What a Classic ~ great recipe that I tend to have for lunches. I agree that adding halved grape tomatoes only makes this better.

Surprisingly good. I added one extra ingredient based on a reviewers comment and drizzled a balsamic vinegar reduction over the final product. Can't wait to try it out on company.

Only 2 of us would eat this, so I cut it in half. Love it! So happy to have found a GOOD blue cheese dressing! Definately used buttermilk to thin it out. A restaurant in town does a similar salad and also adds a drizzle of balsamic vinegar that has been boiled down to a thicker consistency. It adds a nice extra tangy flavor and it looks special.

I've never been the blue cheese dressing fan that my husband is, but this is really good. I used light mayo and you would not know the difference. This is a really good alternative to the field greens we usually have for a salad.

Made this for New Year's Eve dinner party and everyone loved it. I wanted something different from the currently popular salads with apples, pears etc. Looking forward to making it again. Made the dressing ahead and used pre-cooked bacon which I heated in the microwave, then crumbled.

Used a German deli smoked bacon and a Maytag bleu...the bacon was a great addition to this salad, though I would use a more pungent bleu next time, the Maytag seemed a little tame. Got rave reviews from the dinner club members for serving an updated classic.
