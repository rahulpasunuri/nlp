I thought this soup was really good but I do agree that it is tons of work. I didn't even puree all the veggie and add them back into the stock and I still felt like I was making this soup forever.

WAYYYYYYYYYYY too much work! Tastes great, very flavorful but you can get the same result with another recipe in less than half the time!

I followed the recipe exactly and thought it too much work for the result, which was just okay. My family said they would eat it again, but would not miss it if I did not make it. Perhaps it would be a good base.

A great foundation to expand upon. I've added escarole, dried mushrooms (the water you used to reconstitute is a great addition), campanelle instead of the beans, i've used it as my foundation for chicken noodle as well. All are amazing. Quite a few people have suggested adding parmigiano-reggiano to the final simmer. While I would totally recommend this, if you happen to purchase your cheese in a wedge, or another fashion that includes the "rind", I would suggest adding that to the final simmer. You get a concentrated parmesan flavor, without adulterating the clarity of the broth.

While I used this recipe as a good fondation to built upon and it worked out great, I'd like to specify that Pistou is not Pesto - it is tomato based and does not have pine nuts or cheese. In Provence you are likely to taste this wonderful soup with the addition of cut green beans (french beans) and diced green and yellow zucchinis. A pistou can be made with 6 medium garlic cloves, 6 ripe tomatoes, 4 to 6 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and 30 fresh basil leaves. It is pureed in a blender with enough oil to make a smooth, thick but fluid paste. Some of the Pistou can be added to the soup, while the rest can be passed around in a bowl for eveyone to season to taste.

One of my first 'keepers' from Epicurious a couple years ago. It's hard to get a completely vegetarian soup that meat-eaters love - this is it. I've always pureed the stock, upped the garlic content, used a red bell pepper in the stock (gives it a sweetness that it needs), and made my own pesto. Two things that make or break this soup: the thyme (HAS to be fresh) and the olive oil. French or northern Italian (low acid, less than 0.5%) oils are great, but go Greek or southern Italian and the flavors don't meld. Another alternative to giving the soup more richness is to add a old Parmesano-Reggiano rind to the stock. It thickens, salts, and gives it some 'oomph'.

I gave this recipe four forks because it is the best vegetable soup I've ever made. I did, as previous posters suggested, puree all the veggies from the stock. I also added salt along the way and finally, I added a bit of parmesan cheese for people to put on top. Delicious but time consuming.

This soup is fine, but no better than any other bean and veggie soup, onto which you might dollop some pesto.

Definitely add the pesto, it makes the soup! I also pureed all the vegetables. Added salt and pepper. Also put a parmesan rind in for the final simmer (45 mins) to help add flavor.

I made this for my vegan sister, the only thing I changed was to not add the cheese to the pesto, I made my own did not use premade. It was easy and delicious!

Very tasty & very easy. I, too, pureed all of the stock veggies with an immersion blender, then continued with the recipe. I did add salt & freshly ground pepper. I had my own pesto that I made previously from a Mario Batali recipe. I found that I needed to go light on the pesto so it didn't over power the soup. I thought the soup was great even without the pesto. I served it with a spinach salad & some great crusty whole grain bread. Yum! By the way, I doubled the recipe on the stock, froze 1/2 half of it for later, then made a single recipe of the actual soup. There was enough soup for three hungry people one night, two the next night, & there's still enough left over for at least two more servings.

This soup makes a wonderful base from which to make other dishes; you know, have something practical in the freezer and be able to dress it up however you like-- it's healthy and satiating. I did read the reviews other readers posted, so I added carrots, red peppers and a dash of cinamon to the base. I also pureed all of the vegetables for a heartier, thicker, healthier soup, but only used about half the final stock/puree mixture and saved the rest for another dish. I also left out the parsley purposefully, to allow for versatility-- see serving suggestions. In regards to salt and pepper, note that there is no indication on the recipe. The best thing to do is salt and pepper as you go, layer by layer in order to develop your base. TO SERVE: chopped italian parseley (1.5 tbspns) and 1.5 tbspns of basil at the bottom of your bowl. Serve hot soup over the bowl/herbs and perhaps some more red pepper flakes. This should do it for more pronounced flavor. I actually had some tonight with chopped up haas avocado and slivered red onions.

A wonderful, hearty soup. I agree with other posters that it was a good idea to purify all of the stock vegetables after cooking to give the broth more body. I also added chopped leeks with the second batch of vegetables and sundried tomato- basil flavored chicken sausage at the end. A great soup I'll make again.

An excellent soup to add to my collection. It definitely needs some salt. Because my son likes very brothy soup, I used the entire batch of pureed vegetables with a large can of chicken broth and the extra tomaotes & juice for a "second" soup. Also used just one can of cannelini beans and added 4 links of a veal and spinach sausage from Whole Foods (browned them with the soup portion veggies and then simmered in soup before cutting into slices. Yum!!

Very good soup, I agree with the tip to add some salt however. Definitely serve with the basil pistou, it made the dish.

This is a great soup recipe. This recipe may be my all-time favorite soup. If I could, I would give the recipe 10 forks. I did make one change to the recipe. The recipe calls you to reserve only half of the vegetables from the stock, and then pureeing them. I reserved all of the vegetables, making for a slightly thicker soup, which I enjoy.

Very flavorful - an addition of salt enhances the flavor. On the second night of this soup we added chicken-turkey sausage (Basil and Pesto flavor), and the soup became a keeper.

I'd give this 3.5 forks if possible. Very easy and delicious. I did cheat and add a little salt for flavor.

This was a wonderful light but warming soup, and easy to put together. Make sure to saute the vegetables long enough (for the soup, not the stock) - mine were still a bit too hard after 10 minutes of saute and 45 minutes of simmering.

Delicious!! I was hesitant to try this as the other Soupe Au Pistou recipe on this site received a negative review. I made the stock in the morning (so glad I decided to double it so I'll have it in the freezer next time) and the soup was a breeze to throw together later. I've never used fennel before and the aroma was a wonderful experience! The flavor of this soup is incredible. I drizzled with the olive oil instead of pesto and served with French bread. And for my non-vegetarian family members I added a few chunks of chicken. I'd definitely recommend this!!!
