This is without doubt the best bread and butter pudding recipe that I have ever tasted. I halved the recipe and used vanilla essence. The whole family loved it.

I've got the book this recipe was first printed in, 'Rhodes Around Britain'. In there, it says that you put the dish inside a roasting tray three-quarters filled with warm water, then bake it. I've done it with and (by mistake) without the water - with is so much better, a much moister result.

sounds great, but certainly not budget- minded with whipping cream, 8 egg yolks & a vanilla bean

I made this pudding against my better judgement. It is a pretty standard English recipe. I use ordinary sandwich loaf slices cut in half to create triangles. I stack the bread slices vertically, one point up then one point down in a small bread pan (to make about half this volume) but I spread a dollop of ginger marmalade on each slice first. When the pudding comes out of the oven, the top points are brown and toasted- the bottom is gooey and in between the bread is chewy. Also I find the presentation value of the vertical slices more appealing than the curled up top layers in the horizontal layering.

This was a big hit! I tried a banana bread pudding from Whole Foods and it was dissapointing so I thought I'd try my own to cure my craving. I used a day old french bagette- dried to crouton status- cut into chunks. I also simplified it a bit- I don't care for raisins so I didn't do any layering- just dumped it all together in a large glass baking dish. Used a liberal amount of real vanilla extract. Hardly took any time and was very much worth it!

I made this for a non-demonstrative Scottish man and got a thumbs up! Enthusiastic praise...believe me! I used Pepperidge Farms Sandwich White Bread (America's Test Kitchen's recommendation) and substituted dried cherries and chocolate chips for the raisins (from another bread pudding recipe on this site). I served it with Bailey's Cream Sauce (from this site) but it doesn't need it. It was even better the next day!

After an extremely disappointing bread and butter pudding I had at a 5 star hotel one evening, I decided to look for a recipe and try to make one myself to satisfy myself. I found this recipe, tried it, and LO and BEHOLD!! I realised I have found a gem! I have made it many times since then and still find it irresistable. I added a little cognac and soaked the raisins in them too before putting them into the pudding...it gives it a very warm taste. Thank you Gary.

this was my first time making a bread and butter pudding. simply delicious. everyone loved it and rightly so. i am usually poor at making desserts and i think i have found one that is easy to make and tastes great.

This is the best bread pudding I've ever eaten much less made myself. We had this for New Year's Eve, the tail end of days full of good food and desserts, many from this site(the Inside-out-German-Choc-Cake was the best). I left the crusts on the bread and added cinnamon, sugar and nutmeg between one of the layers of bread. I added salt to the custard and used only golden raisins. Room temp. cream drizzled over the top of each bowl was a good addition. Buttering both sides of every piece of bread must be a sin somewhere, but if it is...take me there now!

This is one of the best desserts ever. My fiance asks for it all the time! Yesterday I substituted nuts (pecans) for raisins (which I don't like very much) and it was delicious. Best with whole cream poured over it fresh out of the oven

Great when raspberries are substituted for raisins.

Very creamy and rich but a little bland. My second attempt with a few adjustments was tastier: Keep crusts on for more texture and chewy-ness. Soak raisins in brandy or sherry etc with nutmeg and cinnamon. Retain this liquid and mix into the sugar for the topping.
