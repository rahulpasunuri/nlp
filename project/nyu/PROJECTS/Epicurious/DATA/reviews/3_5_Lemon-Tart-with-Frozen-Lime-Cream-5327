It's a little blah. Neither sweet nor tart. I would also add little more lime juice to it. Won't try it again.

Tarts can be a nightmare for me. This one worked out great! I was looking more for a strawberry tart, so I made the following modifications: I had a 9.5 inch tart pan, so I increased the amount of ingredients in the crust only slightly. Despite pricking with a fork, it was still necessary to weight the crust during baking. For the filling, instead of the called-for amounts of lemon juice and lemon peel, I just used the juice of one small lemon and the peel of 1/2 of that same lemon. Because I am at high altitude (8,200 ft), I increased the oven temperature to 375F. I topped the cooled custard with a cooled mixture of 16 oz sliced fresh strawberries cooked down for less than 10 minutes with about 3/4 cup sugar and about 1 Tbsp. granulated tapioca mixed in. Very well worth the effort!

This was soooo good! I opted to skip the frozen cream and instead used some whipped cream and topped the tart with some fresh raspberries. Everyone loved it! You may want to put the tart pan on a cookie sheet when you bake the filling as mine leaked out a little from under the tart pan. Definitely worth the effort!

Quite hard to prepare, best make it only for special occasions and when you are not in a hurry. But WOW, it is delicious and well worth the effort. Use fresh squeezed juices and freshly grated zest for great results that I got, you won't be disappointed.

I found the crust on this tart was heavy and doughy, not flaky. The lemon filling was not very creamy. The frozen lime cream was not the best either. I hope to find a better recipe.

I have made this dessert probably 5 times and it always turns out beautifully and impresses anyone who eats it. I find that it is very easy to prepare (so nice to not have to roll out the crust) and it looks beautiful when done. Just be sure you leave yourself enough time because the crust has to cool before you fill it, and then it needs to be refriderated. I highly recommend this.

This recipe's preperation takes a little longer than most tart desserts, but the outcome is well worth the effort.
