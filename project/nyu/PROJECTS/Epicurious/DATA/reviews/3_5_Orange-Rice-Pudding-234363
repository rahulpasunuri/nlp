I thought this recipe was simple and it's flavors subtle but so delicious! It was not overly sweet and a great end to dinner. I used a more conventional (sweeter) orange marmalade as suggested by a couple of other reviewers and it worked beautifully.

I loved this recipe. I made it x8 for a potluck. It ended up cooking like a risotto for me (the cover and cook didn't work so well). I used a bit less sugar. After reading the other reviews, I decided to use a conventional sweet orange marmalade rather than the Seville I was going to use. Tasty.

I was so disappointed with this recipe because it smelled heavenly- but tasted atrocious- we threw it out! I think that the marmalade was over the top (used gourmet Tiptree-English maramalade) -what a waste. I might try it again but I agree with the reviewer that said to omit the jam.

I loved this recipe--it was super easy and tasted great. I loved the unique twist of using the orange zest. I think this is a good one for entertaining as well. I think the marmalade can be passed if need be in that the zest added plenty of flavor on its own (I took every bit of zest off the orange). Lastly, it says it is for 4 servings, but I think they are pretty small servings. May be more like three servings.

Delicious and easy! If the pudding gets too thick in the fridge, just beat more milk into it. I added a tablesppon of vanilla paste, which worked well.

This pudding is really excellent and very easy. I used a tart Dundee Marmalade which my husband likes but when I amke it again (which I will as you can make it very quickly) I will use a more conventional sweeter marmalade.
