This was not very good, though it might have been better if the eggplant was grilled and presented as in the picture. Peeling the longer one was a major pain and it looked anything but appetizing slightly on the diagonal. Now, if you sliced the skin off afterwards and cut the flesh into cubes, just 5 or 6 small ones, then dribbled the sauce over and the bonito flakes, it would probably be much better. All in all, I wished I had grilled the eggplants longer and made a nice babbaganoush.

It could be that I only like eggplant when it's smothered with cheese, but this was about as bland as food can get. The so-called sauce couldn't save it, either. Just not much there in the way of flavor. Yuck.

Fabulous. A keeper. The sauce was also good on the grilled asparagus and pan fried tilapia that I served with it.

In response to the first 4 comments; the recipe says to use whole eggplants, not chunks. The photo is beautiful, but slightly misleading.

Grammar/spelling: eggplant is a singular noun...with rare exception Japanese ingredients: Bonito is like tuna...but Katsuobushi flakes need more definition for non-Asians or those unfamiliar with Japanese ingredients...markets

The recipe came out great. I did substitute a teaspoon of sesame oil for the olive oil just because I love the taste. My husband is a vegetarian and this is a great recipe that holds up well on the grill. Also he asked me to sprinkle them with some red pepper flakes (he likes spicy food) For those of you complaining about the photo (really) - mine looked just about like that photo, only I used longer skewers. There are different variations on Japanese eggplants. I am lucky to have an Asian market near me and i saw light purple eggplants, dark purple and even white ones. Meanwhile the recipe would work just as well using regular eggplants as well.

I agree with L Zinger, the photo matches the recipe perfectly. Can't see the problem here. Sorry I'm on here and not actually rating the recipe. I just wanted to point that out. I love Grilled Eggplant though and this does sound good.

Please Google Japanese eggplant and search images - you'll see that Japanese eggplant are long and narrow.

I agree; I don't want to try a recipe where the picture is obviously some other recipe!

So how come the picture doesn't match the recipe instructions?
