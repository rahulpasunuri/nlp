I just made this. Delicious! And quite easy. Very nice flavors. Based on the other reviews, I upped the spices. So although I halved the recipe, I kept the spices about the same: 1tsp garam masala, 1 tsp coriander, 1 tsp turmeric, 1 tsp curry. I definitely salted and peppered liberally- when cooking the onions, when blending the marsala, and then at the end. This does make a lot of sauce. I didn't use all of it, and could have added some spinach too to the dish and still had plenty. I'm not sure if it's because I was using lite coconut milk, but that kind of watered it down a little too much for my taste. Maybe next time, I'll use full fat coconut milk or use a little bit less of the lite. I'm also not sure if the lemon added much because it's a little sour anyway from the yoghurt. Could probably do without that. But I'll definitely make this again!

There is a recipe for garam masala on Epicurious. If you substitute the one you combine yourself, freshly ground and in larger quantity than the 1.5 tsp masala from a jar mentioned in this recipe, believe me, you will not consider this a bland recipe. Reduce the coconut milk and use clarified butter NEVER oil in Indian recipes.

Just made the masala. The trick is, as always, have fresh spice (though the pan helps revive the old stuff hiding in the back of the cupboard). I used "heaping" portions when measuring out the spice and added cardamon, just because I love the seeds from the pods I did throw in some pepper and a few pinches of fleur de sel---made a world of difference. I also used 0% greek yogurt. Just enough tang and lots of body, with the tomatoes. I was a little low on onion so chopped some carrots to get to my 2 cups. I am going to use it on cauliflower, potatoes, other veggies. Will definitley make it again as I am so pleased i got so much flavour from a "simple' recipe.

Absolutely loved it! I'm trying to cut out salt in my diet, so I did not add salt. And I also can't stand cilantro, so I omitted that as well. I can't believe how many people are saying it was bland with all those spices mentioned. I admit, it made a lot of sauce and didn't have enough shrimp, but that's easily fixed. But, the flavors were all there and it tasted like I was at my local Indian restaurant. Will definitely make this again!

Delicious. It did make a ton of sauce. I think that anyone complaining of blandness missed the directions to add salt and pepper taste. I made the sauce as directed, used chicken instead of shrimp (because that is what my family requested), and added asparagus.

I was also disappointed with the bland flavour. It made a lot of sauce so I used half on the shrimp and will the other half with some goat/mutton next time and maybe add some more spices to liven it up and maybe some potatoes. Got some roti to go with it and I added some cauliflower to bulk it up. Would make again with some tweeking

I made this for a dinner party recently and after hearing that one of my guests was vegetarian, I decided to make it with baked tofu instead, which worked beautifully. Everyone raved about it and no one seemed to miss the shrimp. I have tried to make decent curry before and this was by far the best attempt coconut milk AND yogurt brilliant. I love that this recipe makes so much sauce so easy to use the sauce for other things later on in the week just about any veggie will be delicious simmered in this stuff. I'm thinking some frozen peas, potatoes, some spinach, but it would work just as well with, chickpeas, okra, cauliflower. . .

I've been making this recipe faithfully since it came out in 2001, and it's great every time. I brought it to an Indian-themed dinner party once and the guests commented it was "better than an Indian restaurant's." I make it as is, although I add a bit more spice and only about 3/4 can coconut milk. Adding the whole can is probably why some reviewers find this recipe bland. Even 1/2 can would be enough. Also, it really makes a difference to prepare the masala a few hours ahead. I've done it both ways, and the flavors are more developed when made in advance.

Excellent! The recipe does make a lot of sauce, so I added a head of steamed cauliflower and a can of Goya chick peas to the recipe. I served it over rice, and mixed the extra rice in for leftovers. Will definitely make again.

I was getting a little worried as I was finishing this up. Just didn't seem like it was going to taste like anything.

I've been craving curry since I went to an Indian wedding a couple months ago. This is one of the best curries I've ever had! The sauce was perfection. Just the right amount of spice and flavor.

I would make this again but I would consider making a few changes to cooking the shrimp. I would saute the shrimp and any other vegetables you're going to use first and then remove them. Don't cook the shrimp all the way through because they will continue to cook when you take them off and will cook more when you add them back in. I would then add only the coconut milk (1/2 or the full can) and reduce it. After it has reduced for a good while, add the masala mixture and reduce a bit more. When everything (else) is almost done, add the shrimp (and veggies) back in to reheat them and then... serve.

My husband loved this recipe and it was my first attempt at indian cooking. Although it took time to prepare, the recipe made a lot of masala and had seconds a few nights later. Does anyone know if this freezes? Next time will add a few easy vegetables like frozen peas.

I've followed this recipe exact & it was good. Since then, I've doubled the spices in the masala (when you later add the coconut milk, the spiciness is diluted). I like to make a triple batch of masala, and freeze the extra masala in separate containers for quick, delicious future meals (freezes extremely well). Chicken is a great option for the shrimp, I also like to add cauliflower and frozen peas.

I wasn't overly impressed with the masala the night we cooked it, but the leftovers did develop a nice flavor after being allowed to sit overnight. I would recommend making the masala one day ahead for maximum effect. I would also add a bit more cayenne as it seemed a little bland.

My husband and I have different taste buds. He doesnt like tomatoes, garlic, onions, and cilantro and i dont like shrimp. Thats why i was a bit hesitant to do this. But hey it was worth the risk! My husband loves it! He gave me a 5 out of 4 score for this! IT IS DELICIOUS!!!

I was in the mood for something a little different when I came across this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly, but opted to use goat milk yogurt on the spur of the moment.

Wow - fantastic! However, I was very heavy handed on the addition of all spices as I usually find that these recipes are far too conservative. Also, this makes a LOT of sauce. Might consider halving the ingredients next time, although found the leftover sauce was wonderful with leftover pork I had on hand. Liked it with shrimp, will try with chicken next time. Also, agree with others that some vegetables would be a nice addition. Lastly, this is a sauce that improves with a bit of age. The flavors were more intense the next day.

Rating: 2
We doubled up the spices and used chicken per other reviewers' recommendation. We also added a little sugar to cut the acid of the tomatoes. All the work didn't pay off; there was just something missing. In short, it wasn't bad, but we probably won't make it again.

I followed the recipe, except used pressed tofu instead of shrimp and added a drop of sugar to help the onions caramelize. Delicious, but I felt like it needed some vegetables.

I love the masala and like it with the shrimp but prefer it with chickpeas and cauliflower. The masala as directed is great but in a pinch have substituted fat free evaporated milk for the yogurt which is also very good. I typically double the masala (it freezes really well), and add 4 cans of chickpeas and a head of cauliflower, instead of the shrimp. Then put it all in a crockpot on low until the cauliflower is cooked through, usually a few hours. Then I serve it over basmati rice. I have tried it this way with and without the coconut milk and haven't notice much of a difference either way. Its a hit with my very carnivorous husband.

This dish is awesome. I use "Muir Glen Organic Fire Roasted Crushed Tomatoes", "Stoneyfield Farms fat-free French Vanilla Yogurt", and slightly- heaping spoonfuls on the spices and it comes out wonderful. I like it best over jasmine rice, although that's not as "authentic". I've made it with shrimp and with chicken and have received big-time compliments from everyone I've served it to. I definitely recommend making the masala the day before so the spices have time to mix. Also, the amount of shrimp could be almost doubled, as others have said.

It is true that you need to really spice up this dish - I used 1.5 times the recipe amount of the spices and it did the trick. Shrimps are just too expensive, so I used 1/3 shrimp, 1/3 tofu, and 1/3 mixed veg and it was great. I liked the variety rather than just shrimp. I cooked the tofu in the pan that I cooked the onions in, the tofu picked up the extra spices that were left in the bottom of the pan.

This recipe was pretty unexciting and I kept trying to figure out why. I removed a third of the tomato/yogurt mixture before adding the onion spice mixture in order to preserve some of the intensity of the spices. At the last minute I ended up throwing in a good amount of Instant India garlic/ginger chutney, but it still remained bland. I think the best thing would be to make the masala sauce the day before and let the flavors intensify. I won't know for sure since I won't be making it again.

We have a large Indian/Pakistani population here in Dallas and lots of excellent Indian restaurants. Plus, I cook a lot of Indian food, as we love the flavors. This recipe was okay...it has possibilities. I thought it was too tomato-y. Next time, I will increase the spices, double the yogurt and forget about the coconut milk. Simply saute the shrimp, add masala and simmer til done.

I made this recipe with chicken and served it with the Indian Baked Rice recipe (awesome!) from this site. I cooked the sauce much longer (25-30 minutes) but kept the amount of spices as is. This recipe makes a LOT of sauce. Plenty of leftovers, but that's not a bad thing b/c the sauce actually tasted better leftover. I guess it benefits from having the time to have the flavors blend.

After I read all the reviews I was all set to double the spices after adding the coconut milk, but this was near perfect as written. Tasted like the Tikka Masala recipe that I have been on the quest for some time now... Can't wait to try it with the chicken!!

Rating: 3
I just don't see how anyone could not like this. It is fabulous, and I would have given it 4 stars if I hadn't needed to double the spices. The masala seems to be spiced to perfection before it's added to the coconut milk... It gets significantly weaker once it's added to the final mixture.I've made this with both chicken and shrimp, and I really prefer the chicken. I cut it into rather small cubes and let it simmer in the sauce for about 20 minutes. This helps the chicken to really absorb the flavor, and it's something that can't be done with the shrimp, because they'd obviously be too tough if they cooked for that long.A few reviewers suggested draining the tomatoes or leaving some of them whole... I wouldn't recommend this. The recipe is of the perfect consistency when made as-is, and the tomatoes and their sauce are a vital part of the flavor of this dish, as are the ground coriander, lemon juice, and cilantro. If you omit any of these ingredients, you're doing the recipe a serious injustice. Make sure you use good quality curry powder, and, most importanly, enjoy this amazing Indian dish!!

Rating: 4
Fabulous. This will definitely become a regular recipe around our house. And SOOOO EASY! I took reviewers tips: I immediately stored half the masala for use later with chicken. Then, for a smaller family, I added only a pound of shrimp. I forgot to halve the coconut milk though. The result was a bit soupy, still VERY tasty, but with lots of unnecessary fat, so I'll definitely reduce coconut milk next time. Left cilantro, green onion and lemon juice portions unchanged. Mmmmm.

I made this with chicken and veggies (per other reviewers' suggestions. Sauce was great as is, did not add extra spices, but had a ton of it left over.

This is a wonderful dish. Previous reviews of this recipe were helpful. Here's what I learned: 1.) The recipe makes A LOT of sauce (masala). I made all the sauce & used only 1/2 for dinner. I froze the other half. 2). To finish the recipe, I used one of the smaller cans of coconut milk (to go with the 1/2 sauce). 3.) I increased the spices, with the exception of the cayenne (which I actually decreased by half). 4.) One reviewer suggested using chicken instead of shrimp - I have to agree. The sauce is so intensely flavored that you really can't taste the shrimp. 5.) Other reviewers commented on the ease of preparation. They are right! Once you make the masala, the last part of the meal is basically a brief saute, addition of all pre-prepped ingredients, and heating. Make sure you have something to do in your kitchen for the 20-30 minutes it takes to brown the onions in the masala.

Thank you to the other reviewers. I took their suggestions and increased the spices, used some chopped whole peeled tomatoes (w/o juice), and added green beans and peas. Very tasty. I also cut the fat by using lowfat yogurt and light coconut milk, and it was still delicious. Yes, it's a little Thai-like, but that's ok with me.

This is the most delicious dish I have EVER eaten & found some other versions of this recipe very dissapointing. This recipe, however is nearly identical in flavor and consistancy to that of Sargam. I do like it spicier and hotter, as this version is pretty mild. Next time I make it I will play with the spice levels & will buy some hot Indian curry rather than what I had in my spice rack.

Outstanding! Be sure to make loads of rice or have bread on hand to sop up the delicious sauce. This would only feed 4-6 people, as it is so delicious everyone will want more. I cut the recipe in half and my husband and I finished it all.

The dish was very falvorful and easy--if a little time consuming--to make. I plan to cut the cilantro portion in half next time.

This was tasty. Making the sauce ahead of time really improves its flavor. Don't add the shrimp until the last minute, though-- they'll become rubbery if they're reheated. Very simple recipe, with yummy results. I served this with white basmati rice.

This recipe is really wonderful. Making the masala sauce the day before makes it a snap for entertaining, as it's very quick to prepare. I've made it twice with lite coconut milk (unsweetened) and with brown basmati rice - rave reviews!!!

This is a great recipe. I have made it twice. The first time I used the regular unsweetened coconut milk, which (I think) has a high fat content. The second time I made it with lite coconut milk, brown rice and even cut back on the oil a bit. It was still great.
