We liked this very much. Couldn't find pea tendrils/sprouts (hey, it's a Boston winter, what do you want?!) so we had to make do with just the snap peas, but the flavors came together really nicely. The fish was cooked perfectly and had that lovely flakiness-meets-rare style that I so love. Our only complaint was that the sauce was rather viscous which I think would be alleviated with either a) a better quality Asian sweet chili sauce (fiance disagrees) or b) using just chili sauce and making the dish slightly spicier (she agrees). Either way, something that I would definitely make again.

This recipe was amazing. Everyone in my family loved it and it was so easy to make. If you prep ahead of time, you can have dinner in 20 minutes. A few changes: one 8oz fillet for my husband and three - 6oz fillets instead of the 6-6oz-ers. I cut the sugar snaps into thirds, just for easier, one-bite handling, added red onions and at the end, some arugula just until wilted. I plated the same way as the picture, but over Basmati rice. The rice was great because it cooled any of the too-spicy bits that can come from the chili sauce. My husband gave it the "Restaurant Quality" rating. This would be great for a dinner party!

This recipe is excellent!! I've had people RAVE about it and say it's be best salmon dish they've ever had. I would have to agree with them. Because it is simple flavours, I strongly recommend splurging on a nice piece of salmon from a proper fish market. You won't regret it - the textures and flavours are excellent! Broiling it with the glaze gives it a nice lightly crunchy exterior. AMAZING!

Loved this. Next time -- and there will definitely be a next time -- I would use sockeye or coho salmon, a thinner filet that would allow the marinade to penetrate more than it did with my thick filets of king salmon. But even with the marinade a little whisper-y, this was a fabulous dinner. Do NOT skip the sugar snaps and sprouts; a bite of salmon and veg together is really delicious.

Really delicious. Followed recipe except I had extra pea snaps and I forgot the seaseme oil drizzle. I used Sherry as I ran out of rice wine.

We have made this recipe twice in the 2 weeks we have known of its existence. Most recently made it for a dinner party of 10 people and it was so easy and delicious. With in 2 days 4 of the guests had already made it themselves at home; they couldn't get enough of it! We haven't found pea tendrils and have tried using other sprouts, but from now on we'll just leave them out. I am gluten free so we use a gluten free soy sauce and the rest is naturally gluten free. It's a great gluten free and dairy free recipe. We bake it at 350 for 20 minutes or so to keep it juicy. This is a great recipe and will definitely add it to my dinner rotation!

Loved it! I followed the recipe as written, but I didn't have rice wine when I went to prepare this, so I subbed vermouth. Any dry white would probably work, as long as it isn't too florally or something. The pea tendrils were fantastic in this preparation. If I didn't have them, I would have subbed some baby bok choy maybe. An oily salmon works well with this. I used Loch Duart Scottish salmon ... perfect for this recipe.

This was hands down one of the best meals I've ever made. Not to mention that the recipe is SO EASY to follow, it's essentially foolproof! A sure thing for salmon lovers! I made a few minor adjustments to the recipe: I used EVOO instead of vegetable oil, green beans instead of the snap peas/sprouts, and I substituted red wine and a bit of sugar for the Chinese rice wine. Worked great.

I really enjoyed this dish. It was easy to make and tasty. I did not have snap peas or pea tendrils, so I used green peas and bok choy instead... very good!

This has become one of our favorite ways to prepare salmon--so easy and delicious. I usually serve it with arugula rather than the pea tendrils.

tasty, I had to use red pepper jelly and it turned out good. Skipped the pea tendrils.

We followed the recipe and it was easy and v. good. Just a note, I always add my garlic near the end and not at the beginning, much less likely to burn this way. (learned this in the kitchen of hard knocks!)

Followed the recipe exactly. I was worried about not having enough heat but I used Thai sweet chili sauce and it was perfect. A do over for sure.

Very, very, very good glaze!!! We used this for our grilled salmon and stir-fry veggie dinner. 3 stars...but only because we would have liked a little more heat in the sauce....but overall will definitely make again. We usually go out to a fancy restaurant for a dish like this - not anymore! This could be a weekly spot on the dinner rotation at my house!!!!

This was really good. They had pea shoots at my farmer's market!

The sauce on the salmon was amazing. I fully plan on trying it with some shrimp or chicken. I wasn't a fan of the pea tendrils, but I'm not entirely sure I did them correctly. The peas themselves were very good.

It's all about fresh ingredients and improvising where necessary. I could not find the Asian chili sauce and used Franks sweet BBQ sauce (wing sauce) since it was in the cabinet. I highly recommend it! The marinade was great. My experience is to always overdo the ginger to help with flavor. You can't go wrong. We had fresh New Zealand salmon and snap peas both from the farmer's market yesterday. Superb and simple! We have an antique oven so we had to bake the salmon for 6 minutes because it was too thick and didn't cook through.

Wow, not a fan at all. Made this exactly by the book and sorry guys, both my partner and I agreed, this is not our cup of tea. Surprising since everyone else liked it and we usually swear by a four forks rating. Not this time.

My favorite (and my boyfriend's) salmon recipe on Epicurious so far! (and basically Epicurious is my cookbook).

This was really delicious. I couldn't find sweet chili sauce, so I added sugar to a spicey chili sauce. I used less oil all around and cooked the pea tendrils a little longer based on other reviews which was good. Just broiled salmon as recipe called for. Served it with a wild rice pilaf

This is delicious! I used snow peas and spinach. Perfect, except I would watch how much oil I use next time. I sauted the veggies in peanut oil and added the sesame at the end, as the recipe called for, but will try it differently next time. Served with short grain brown rice. I am not used to cooking with that much ginger, but it was fabulous. Will make this again,for sure. So easy, healthy and tastes great.

Delicious, easy to make, a beautiful presentation and way better than eating out! I couldn't find the snap pea tendrils so I used spinach, and it was a wonderful substitute!

Don't have an oven or broiler and cannot BBQ so I improvised. To pan broil place the salmon skin side down in saute pan and cooked for three minutes on medium high heat (depending on the tickness of the filet). Turned once to cook on other side for 2 minutes and then added twice the sauce to pan to heat through and absorb the salmon juices. (Added sliced and sauted red and yellow peppers to the sauce for color and texture-they go great with this type of asian glaze.) Served skin side down on plate with sauce over the top. Substituted green beans for Pea tendrils as they also work well with the dressing. Super fast and easy.

Made this yesterday using sugar snap peas and tendrils from my garden and sockeye salmon. It was excellent and easy and a big hit for Father's Day lunch. Did not care for the tendrils even though they came straight from the garden I thought they were tough. Next time I will use only the very tips or blanch the tendrils before stir frying.

The glaze is easy and delicious. I broiled one piece of salmon as directed with no problem. No pea tendrils or sprouts in the store though. Did not like alfalfa sprouts nor bean sprouts as substitutes. Enough flavor that a simple jasmine rice was just fine.

Let me tell you, this is BANGIN...have friends that don't like salmon? Yeah, have them try this. I've made it twice, two different ways. #1. Each piece of salmon in its own individual foil packet, pinched and rolled at the top, and grilled. #2. Broiled in the oven. Each time I served it with short-grain brown ride and sambal oelek (hot Thai chili sauce) on the side. Pea tendrils are in season I guess because I see them in Wegmans now but didn't a few months ago, so I used broccoli sprouts. Served with pinot noir. Fantastic!

I made this for two tonight and it was a great success. I could not find pea shoots but added mixed peppers to the stair fry. I served it with saffron rice and the light flavours worked well together.

Made this evening with Sockeye salmon. Very tasty. The cut of fish was a bit thin, so I cooked it at 400F for 11 min - it came out great. I thought that the pea tendrils were a bit hard to eat, but my husband loved them.

Yea, way good. Cooked salmon on a Weber Kettle in one big piece indirect method with a few wood chips. Served with almond rice pilaf garnished with chopped cilantro. Could not find pea tendrils so julienned snap peas which seemed to work fine.

Absolutely delicious way to cook salmon. I served on rice with roasted broccoli. No sugar snaps available fresh.

The 4 forks is for the glaze - fabulous on the salmon. We grilled the salmon. Did not make the sugar snap peas and pea tendrils because I couldn't find tendrils or sprouts and think the recipe needs to be complete to make it. When I do find them I will try the whole recipe.

I made this recipe as per instructions, except baked the salmon at 400 deg F for about 20 minutes as did many earlier reviewers. This is now officially my favorite way to have salmon, and possibly my favorite meal! However, be warned that pea shoots are different than pea tendrils and require 2-3 cooking time instead of 1 minute. Next time I'll add my pea shoots along with the sugar snap peas, and then cover and cook both together for 2-3 minutes as the 1 minute cooking time specified for pea tendrils is not long enough for pea shoots (which is all I could find at my farmer's market).

I have tried many salmon recipes and this was fabulous. I could not find pea tendrils so served it with fresh roasted asparagus. Also added some chopped pickled ginger to the marinade.

This was great, quick, and easy. The only alterations I made were omitting the pea tendrils (couldn't find them anywhere) and using the one teaspoon of sesame oil to saute the snow peas (omitted the veg oil). Like others, I baked in the oven at 400 for 16 mins. Thinner salmon filets will allow more flavor I think. All in all, it was enjoyed.

Rating: 4
Loved it! It was extremely easy to make. The tendrils give this dish that extra something special. I used one large piece of salmon rather than the individual fillets. My rather picky husband enjoyed it as well!

Great dish, the peas by themselves would compliment many dishes. Had no trouble with the broiler, the last minute of cooking I turned the heat off so the salmon would not burn and it continued to cook.

Loved the salmon! Didn't get a chance to prepare the greens. Marinated the salmon for 1 hr in a baggie at room temp and cooked as others suggested - 17 mins at 400. So good I actually enjoyed leftover fish for lunch the next day. Will make it again and again!

Lovely receipt! It comes together in a snap and with the exception of the Salmon, Sugar Snap Peas, and Pea Tendrils (which are delicious BTW), the ingredients are already around the house. Who knew a weeknight meal could be so delicious, interesting, and easy!

Great salmon recipe! I think snow peas would also work great. My supermarkets (and I checked three) didn't sell Sweet Chili Sauce, so I purchased a sweet asian rib sauce with chili peppers in the ingredients. I know it probably wasn't accurate to the recipe, but it worked fine.

Fantastic dish...wouldn't change a thing!!

Great sauce for Salmon - except we had a large, thick fillet so broiling took too long (sugary sauce charred on pan creating smoke!) and I switched to baking to finish - For thick fillets I recommend baking first for 6-10 minutes then broil for last 2 minutes. Also, could have marinated in a ziplock for more flavor (so good!). I will make again for sure.

I would rate this as very good, not excellent. The chile sauce which has sugar tends to burn. Therefor, if I were to do this again, I would bake at 450 for 10 minutes then finish with a one minute broil. Nice presentation with the greens. We served this on a bed of rice noodles.

It's a beautiful dish, looked just like the cover picture...but I thought it looked better than it tasted. I love sweet chili sauce but I thought it overwhelmed the salmon. The peas and greens were a bit oily (even in the picture) but the sesame oil did give them a nice flavor. With cooking then in vegetable oil then adding the sesame at the end, it was just too much. I'd skip the vegetable oil and just cook them in the sesame if I was going to make this again. But I'm not...I like to be able to taste my salmon.
