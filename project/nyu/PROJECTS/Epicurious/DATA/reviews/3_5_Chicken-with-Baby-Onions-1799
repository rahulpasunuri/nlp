Excellent chicken recipe. Agree with other reviewers that that bay leaf needs to be reduced to 2. I also think 2t thyme is enough. I use more onions since my husband and I really like them.

I made this for dinner tonight and we LOVED it! We did make some modifications: I substituted breasts for thighs, normal for low-salt chicken broth, and red onions cut into wedges for the pearl onions, which we caramelized like other reviewers suggested and the results were delicious! The chicken was sooo moist and tender and we didn't have any of the problems with the lack of flavor some other reviewers mentioned. We also made gratin dauphinois to go with the chicken and had a feast!

Great! Used skinless thighs and carmelized the onions. Definitely a simple and delicious recipe.

I did find this bland.....even using regular chicken broth instead of lo-salt, and adding some garlic, the sauce still seemed on the flavorless side. (I crumbled half a chicken boullion cube in at that point, which was an over-correction but not by as much as you think). Anyway perhaps the differing reviews are just a matter of taste, but I wouldn't do again.

This was very tasty, but we found it to be a little too fatty / greasy. Next time I will either take the skin off the thighs, or use skinless breasts. I browned the onions first, as suggested by other reviewers.

So incredibly delicious and simple! I've made this dish many times and every time it's received raves from my family and guests. The key is to carmelize the baby onions. I like to serve it with garlic or herbed mashed potatoes and roasted carrots. Very, very good.

An absolutely delicious, company-worthy dish. I made this recipe several years ago when I saw it in the magazine. I had lost the recipe and was thrilled to find it again on this website. I, too, caramelized the onions first, then added another podge of butter and browned the chicken. I actually used shallots because there were no baby onions at the market, and they worked fine.

The meat certainly is tender, but this dish is really fatty unless you carefully cut off any fat remaining on the thighs. I too caramelized the onions, but in the end I felt the 4 bay leaves totally overpowered every other flavor in the dish. I would drop the number of bay leaves to two, at most. All these criticisms aside, my husband really liked how tender the meat was. I guess I might make it again, as long as I get rid of all the fat.

Yummy - This is so easy, it will be a regular for us for basic everyday and for casual entertaining. Just be careful that the sauce doesn't separate.

My husband just loved it!

I loved this recipe because it was so SIMPLE! The prep time took about 3 minutes, then you browned the chicken, which took less than 10, then I let it go to simmer while I made a salad. Very low-maintenance recipe with a high return. I made it with chicken breasts instead of thighs, and I think next time I'll add some ingredients and caramelize the onions, but all in all I give it very high marks. The thyme flavor is to-die-for and it left my whole apartment smelling as good as it tastes.

what a delicious and very easy recipe. i did change a few things because i didn't have all the ingredients on hand. instead of the low-sodium chicken broth, i used regular chicken broth and used unsalted butter (hoping to balance the salt from the broth). i also added sliced mushrooms as suggested by another reviewer, during the last few minutes of simmering. this is my first time cooking this recipe and i will definitely add it to my favorites.

Although easy to make, this was bland, even with the extra steps recommended by previous cooks it didn't seem like something to rave about. My husband, who is very easy to please, actually said "please don't keep this recipe." !

This dish was delicious and simple. i carmelized the onions and pounded boneless skinless chicken breast thin. Next time i will dredge them in flour to thicken the sauce a bit. i love the flavor of white wine in sauce so i reduced he chicken broth and upped the wine.

This was an excellent recipe, actually much better than I expected and it is now our new favorite from this entire web site. I took the advice of the other reviewers and caramelized the onions longer than the recipe calls for -- I think it made a huge difference in the depth of flavor (I caramelized the onions over medium-low heat, then after about 10 minutes increased the heat to medium, added a bit more butter then browned the skinned thighs. Followed the rest of the recipe per the instructions). I, too, served it over herbed mashed potatoes and alongside glazed carrots...it was a lovely combination. I plan to serve it for guests -- it was quick, easy, absolutely delicious and presents beautifully. A winner!

I also used Lemon Thyme and yes, it was wonderful. I cooked the thighs longer, getting a more carmalized flavor to the chicken before adding the broth. Don't miss out on this one, so easy.

A great recipe. The longer you simmer the more tender the chicken thighs get. I serve it with mashed potatoes too.

I've made this dish several times, and served to company. It's always been a hit! I always serve it with a side of lots of herbed mashed potatos. The potatos are great for soaking up some of the wonderful thyme sauce.

I wanted a simple recipe for chicken thighs. This recpe is simple but it is not very good. The sauce is too watery. I added two tablespoons of cornstarch and it was still too watery. Also, it calls for too much thyme. Even with those two factors corrected I would not recommend making this dish.

This is a simple yet elegant recipe, I have made this many times, and everytime it comes out perfect. Added sliced carrots and mushrooms - my husband rated it a keeper, and asks for it again and again.
