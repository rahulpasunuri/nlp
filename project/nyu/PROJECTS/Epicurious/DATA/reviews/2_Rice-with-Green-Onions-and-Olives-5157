The flavors in this recipe don't marry each other. The olives are too sour and so is the lemon, even if you are careful enough to only remove the peel and not the white part. I suspected these flavors woudn't work together upon reading the recipe but was looking for an alternative to a basic side-dish of fried rice with onions and rosemary, which is always great... what a mistake.

I thought olives were a bit overpowering. Could be becuase I didn't have a lemon so I used a lime instead which did not provide much flavor.

THe olive/lemon combination make it bitter. I would use less lemon and not leave it in as long. i would also use a plain black or green olive added at the very last minute. It is a very pretty dish.
