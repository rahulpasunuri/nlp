I made this recipe recently for a dinner party for 4. I made all of the components separately the day before and put them together in the baking pan after reheating (to room temp) each in the microwave. It was incredibly easy, delicious, and allowed me to spend time with my guests. Next time I'll add some parmesan or truffle oil (or mushroom soaking liquid, like another reviewer suggested) to the sauce for a little added flavor. And make sure you get a good quality smoked ham and have it sliced so it isn't super thin-- it provides a lot of contrasting flavor to the mushrooms, so don't skimp.

I added sage and arugula to spice up the dish. I also used mini-portabella mushrooms.

I made the crepes with a standard size crepe pan, and I only got six crepes. The mushroom filling was just enough for those six crepes. I had WAY too much bechamel sauce. I thought the sauce was bland, and needed salt. My husband, however, loved them. He said they were good comfort food.

Agree with other reviewers that it is a lot of work with a so so outcome. Very bland.

I was searching for "low fat" recipes and this is what came up! Ha! Ha!

Made this for a brunch. It was well received, but a LOT of work for something that I really didn't love. It was really rich - maybe I just wasn't up for something so heavy. One crepe was more than enough for me. Also, the amount of parmesan was way more than necessary to "sprinkle" over the top.

Pretty good. Substituted portabello mushrooms for the porcini mushrooms and it tasted ok. The sauce wasn't my favorite - it lacked something. Overall, a tasty dish, but not really worth the effort in my opinion.

I made the entire dish the day before using mushrooms and spinach, no ham. I served this for brunch with a Roasted Asparagus salad with Tangerine Dressing.It was perfect together!

Sooo yummy! I served it for brunch, making the crepes the night before, and stuffing in the morning. Also added some wilted spinach for colour and texture. This recipe will definitely stay in my brunch repertoire.

We used chicken instead of ham and the crepes came out great! A wonderful dish I will definetly prepare again soon.

Served this for a Sunday brunch with a field green salad and a fresh fruit. It was a big hit. Used smoked ham and added spinach with the mushroom saute. Very filling and great presentation.

This recipe is right on with that of L'Osteria del Forno's. Tastes just like it. Definately a keeper and despite the ingredient list and instructions, not very hard to make.

We liked very much however I used leftover baked ham and ground it in the food processor Also I used straw mushrooms and shitaka mushrooms in place of the porcini which I did not have. I will make it again. Using a different recipe for the crepes. I didn't care for the crepe recipe

i eliminated the porcini mushrooms and increased the button mushrooms, used leftover ham, and came up with a beautiful, elegant , and delicious dish i would be proud to serve to anyone. while it was a bit of work, all the ingrediants could be prepped in advance and assembled at the last minute for a dinner party that doesn't tie you to the kitchen when you would rather be socializing. excellant served with a simple salad with a simple viniagrette, and some fresh fruit on the side.

It seemed a shame to waste flavorful porcini soaking water, so I poured it through a strainer covered with two layers of paper towels to remove the grit, and then used it to make the sauce, adding just a little milk to make up the difference. You could use half-and-half or cream if you want it to be rich. Also, I have made this using diced leftover baked ham instead of sliced ham. Either way, it's great!

I was disappointed in this recipe. Other reviewers were right, the ham was overpowered. I thought the whole thing rather bland. I might try a variation by using thicker slices of ham, adding a few herbs and maybe some parmesan to the sauce.

Following a previous reviewers comments and with the suggestion of my local deli, I tried using Westphalian ham in this recipe since I was concerned about the porcini overwhelming the ham but this proved to be the wrong choice - the ham was too strong. Nevertheless I will try this again; I think that with the right choice on my side it will be a rich and delicious dish

I changed this recipe completely but it was wonderful. I made the Bechamel sauce and to that I added cooking sherry and 12oz of lump crab meat. I filled the crepes and served it right away (no additional baking with cheese).

This was very good, but I'd use prociutto next time, the ham taste was over powered by the procinis

This is fabulous. I wouldn't change a thing. I made this for our gourmet club "French night". Everyone was just in pure bliss. I made the crepes a week ahead of time and froze them. I 'm sure they would have had a better consistency if I had made them the day of.

A little time consuming, but worth it. Made a great dinner served with some greens.

beautiful! absolute restaurant quality. the sauce was lovely and i can use it in other recipes. quit time-consuming, but relatively easy for me (a 15-year-old) to make. i would definitely make this again; it's become my mother's favourite! perhaps substituting bacon for the ham would be interesting as well.
