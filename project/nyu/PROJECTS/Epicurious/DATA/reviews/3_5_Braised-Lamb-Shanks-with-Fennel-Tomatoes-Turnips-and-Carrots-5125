Made 1/3 of the recipe for my wife and I. The flavors were incredibly rich and the recipe easy to prepare. Did not use the current jelly for the final reduction, but did for the marinade. The sauce over the very tender and flavorful lamb with the topping sprinkled over the entire shank made for a memorable dinner with the vegetables absorbing the cooking flavors and adding their own tastes and textures. I'm getting hungry just thinking about the meal.

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner. I prepared it the day before. I was happy to have all the prep done ahead of time. It did require an extra hour of cooking time.

Nice tastes, the topping added great extra flavors. I made it exactly as noted and felt it could have had a bit more bang. I've got some leftovers and wonder how it will be as a "next day" dish. Next time, I'll try another recipe.

Will make this one again.. Didnt use lamb shanks used some other sort of lamb cut but made exactly as it said with the exception of the jelly... had mint jelly instead and it was fantastic! The tunrips were great... they really soaked up the flavour.... Served with baked baby pumpkins and gave peope the choice of baked potatoes or couscous

I'll definitely make this again. I solved the "needs more cooking" problem by putting the browned shanks and all the other stuff into a crockpot and letting it simmer all afternoon. My husband loved it. I did make, er, a lot of changes. Didn't have any fennel, so left it out. Used more garlic and more herbs than specified, and left out the currant jelly entirely. Used swede (US:rutabaga) rather than turnips. And served it with couscous. It was really, really good, and completely free of added salt, which is a plus. Tonight we're having the leftover veg and sauce with butter beans (simmered separately, because the veg has been cook enough, y'know?) added for protein, as a sort of stew, and it smells fabulous.

WE followed the recipe but added more currant jelly by mistake and I think that gave it more flavor. We also cooked it a bit more than the recipe called for. Everyone thought it was delicious.

Awful! Terrible! I had the misfortune to make this for my future in-laws last night. What dreck! I cooked it to the right fork-tender consistency, but the complete lack of flavoring, and the bland overcooked vegetables, paired with a bland gravy made it an embarrassing dish for me to serve. I can't believe everyone here thought it was good. At least I can save the two leftover shanks and make a nice ragu pasta sauce with it. I cannot overestimate how disappointing and flavorless this dish was. The one good thing was the white bean side dish found as an accompaniment to another lamb shank recipe on epicurious.

I rarely find a dish that my four school-aged children ALL agree is delicious. This was it. The topping makes it more than just another stew; it's a highly unusual melange of flavors. Now that my "guinea pigs" approve, I'll make it for friends before winter is over.

I agree, cook it longer. Then let it cool completely so the fat is easy to remove. I found the veges tasted the same after so long cooking (= a bit bland) - but other people liked this. Maybe add them a bit later. The turnips are good.

This dish was fabulous and very simple if started a day ahead. I agree with the longer cooking times recommended by others. The gravy is so superb I saved all the extra for the future! I might replace the turnips with new potatoes in the future.

I agree with the cook who said it should cook longer. Next time, I'll probably let it go for about 3 1/2 hours. But, at 2 1/2 hours it was very tender, just not falling off the bone. I made this for dinner guests and it was delicious!

Prepared this dish for a dinner party of six...all gave rave reviews, from "falling off the fork delicious!" to "WOW, what a wondeful blend of flavors." Used your suggestion for wine, an Australian Syrah provided a delighful complement to the lamb and vegetables. Thanks Bon Appetit!

I served this dish last night to nine people to great acclaim....lovely sauce with gentle sweetness and nice balance of vegetables. The gremolata topping added a freshness and zing to the overall flavour. Cold nights in the southern hemisphere from now on mean Ill be cooking this winter warmer again.

This recipe was fabulous, a welcome change from the usual braising in wine and broth. The topping really adds something special even though it sounds weird. Next time I would cook the lamb a little longer, maybe 2 1/2 hours. After 2 hours it wasn't quite "fall off the bone" tender.

After having a wonderful braised lamb shank plate at One Market in San Francisco, I searched for a recipe that would be just as delicious. This is definitely it, and is probably better! It's also pretty easy!

Absolutely fantastic presentation. The flavors blended beautifully. It's definitely worth the effort.
